And thanks to Linode for literally putting gas in our tank.

00:16.000 --> 00:22.000
This summer we set out on an epic road trip and there are so many stories we could share.

00:22.000 --> 00:26.000
Today, we'll give you a little taste of some of them.

00:26.000 --> 00:30.000
It's been about a season since we were out there.

00:30.000 --> 00:32.000
That's a good form of measurement.

00:32.000 --> 00:34.000
So Brent and I have had time to think about this.

00:34.000 --> 00:39.000
I was the RV pilot and Brent was the chase pilot in the car behind us.

00:39.000 --> 00:44.000
It was a full crew operation. My wife and three kids and our dog was along.

00:44.000 --> 00:49.000
We were making content along the way, meeting people, doing a series of micro meetups.

00:49.000 --> 00:51.000
And we had two big meetups.

00:51.000 --> 00:55.000
We had one in Salt Lake City and then a really big one in Denver.

00:55.000 --> 00:58.000
There's a lot of stories, though, between Seattle and Denver.

00:58.000 --> 01:00.000
So we wanted to just start there.

01:00.000 --> 01:04.000
And really, I thought, for something like this, Brent,

01:04.000 --> 01:10.000
one of the things that was the most fun for me was watching you take in your first RV road trip.

01:10.000 --> 01:15.000
It's true. I did divulge to you that this was kind of the first real trip in an RV.

01:15.000 --> 01:17.000
And I knew I had a lot to learn.

01:17.000 --> 01:20.000
Brent, would you like a tour of the outdoor shower?

01:20.000 --> 01:24.000
No, please. I'm feeling a little sticky.

01:24.000 --> 01:27.000
It's wet, it's hot, and it's smoky.

01:27.000 --> 01:30.000
I like to call it my spiciness.

01:30.000 --> 01:33.000
So you could go by the one that has a little bit of pittle underneath it.

01:33.000 --> 01:35.000
Do you have a leak?

01:35.000 --> 01:38.000
Yeah, there's a slight leak right now.

01:40.000 --> 01:43.000
And so this is the shower here.

01:43.000 --> 01:46.000
This is your notch for on, off.

01:46.000 --> 01:49.000
You can leave the handles on, but then you can notch it here.

01:49.000 --> 01:53.000
But the only thing that's kind of tricky is I think the hot and cold might be backwards.

01:53.000 --> 01:57.000
Oh wait, it doesn't matter because we haven't had the hot water on for a while.

01:57.000 --> 01:59.000
It's all hot water right now.

01:59.000 --> 02:01.000
It's lukewarm water right now, really.

02:01.000 --> 02:05.000
So it doesn't really matter which one's hot or cold because of that.

02:05.000 --> 02:07.000
But Chris, where do I hang my towel?

02:07.000 --> 02:09.000
All over the door there.

02:09.000 --> 02:11.000
Oh, you're hot glass over here.

02:11.000 --> 02:14.000
And you can put your soap right there if you want it. It's up to you.

02:14.000 --> 02:16.000
It depends on how you do it. But there you have it.

02:16.000 --> 02:18.000
What about privacy?

02:18.000 --> 02:20.000
Well, glad you asked.

02:20.000 --> 02:24.000
For that, you open the other door.

02:24.000 --> 02:31.000
And now, at least from two sides, people can't see you.

02:31.000 --> 02:34.000
Oh God, that's pretty good.

02:34.000 --> 02:36.000
Pretty premium, right?

02:36.000 --> 02:37.000
There you go.

02:37.000 --> 02:41.000
We could use the indoor shower, but then we'd have to give up all that precious storage space.

02:41.000 --> 02:43.000
Yeah, and storage space it was.

02:43.000 --> 02:46.000
There were groceries in there and beds in there and all sorts of stuff.

02:46.000 --> 02:53.000
And I got to say, as funny as that outdoor shower tour was, that initial time,

02:53.000 --> 02:59.000
there's something really beautiful and wonderful about showering outdoors in the fresh breeze.

02:59.000 --> 03:04.000
Unless you're doing it at a welcome center right as the staff are arriving for their morning shift.

03:04.000 --> 03:06.000
That was my first experience.

03:06.000 --> 03:10.000
And so I dove right into the kind of risky RV life.

03:10.000 --> 03:12.000
But I don't know. It was great.

03:12.000 --> 03:13.000
You handled it well.

03:13.000 --> 03:14.000
I wound up to it a little bit.

03:14.000 --> 03:15.000
You definitely handled it well.

03:15.000 --> 03:19.000
And it's just the kind of things you do when you got six people on board.

03:19.000 --> 03:23.000
I will say, yeah, that was actually some of the most private moments,

03:23.000 --> 03:27.000
despite being quite open to the environment.

03:27.000 --> 03:28.000
It really is.

03:28.000 --> 03:30.000
It really is basically all you get.

03:30.000 --> 03:33.000
So before we talk about going on the road, it's notable.

03:33.000 --> 03:35.000
This was months of planning, right?

03:35.000 --> 03:38.000
It was we haven't been able to do any events,

03:38.000 --> 03:44.000
and we just wanted to reconnect with the audience and get outside the social media bubble

03:44.000 --> 03:46.000
and really reconnect with the audience.

03:46.000 --> 03:50.000
And after months and months of planning,

03:50.000 --> 03:53.000
it kind of just came down to like a couple of days of a blur

03:53.000 --> 03:58.000
where we did all the final prep, you flew into Seattle,

03:58.000 --> 04:03.000
and then it seemed like the next thing you know, we were on the road.

04:03.000 --> 04:04.000
And we're off.

04:04.000 --> 04:05.000
You got this.

04:05.000 --> 04:08.000
Now you just be my, you be eyes on my ass and let me know if there's anything going on

04:08.000 --> 04:10.000
that I need to worry about back there.

04:10.000 --> 04:14.000
Maybe help me defend me from people who want to ride my butt for going too slow.

04:14.000 --> 04:15.000
That's your mission.

04:33.000 --> 04:36.000
Now you didn't come to be our chase driver,

04:36.000 --> 04:40.000
but we ended up not being able to tow the car for various reasons.

04:40.000 --> 04:42.000
And so it worked out pretty good.

04:42.000 --> 04:44.000
And I think that ended up being an advantage actually,

04:44.000 --> 04:47.000
because I remember a few times throughout the trip you were saying,

04:47.000 --> 04:50.000
Oh gosh, am I ever glad we're not towing the car behind

04:50.000 --> 04:54.000
because it changes how accessible the RV is.

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
Backing up for number one, you can back up.

04:56.000 --> 04:57.000
You can't back up when you're towed.

04:57.000 --> 05:00.000
And that's nice when you're at a gas station.

05:00.000 --> 05:04.000
But it also you could go you could you could go over preemptively into a lane

05:04.000 --> 05:08.000
and you could make an opening for me and then I could move the RV over.

05:08.000 --> 05:11.000
Well, the RV is it's 37, 38 feet.

05:11.000 --> 05:14.000
And in rush hour traffic, that was like an essential tool.

05:14.000 --> 05:16.000
Then we coordinated over the radios.

05:16.000 --> 05:18.000
That worked really, really well.

05:18.000 --> 05:22.000
And ironically, but not unexpectedly,

05:22.000 --> 05:25.000
some of the worst traffic was here in Washington

05:25.000 --> 05:26.000
that we dealt with the entire road trip.

05:26.000 --> 05:27.000
I did not expect that.

05:27.000 --> 05:31.000
I thought for sure we would hit traffic out of the road.

05:31.000 --> 05:34.000
But I don't know, a few hours in, it was like, Oh gosh,

05:34.000 --> 05:37.000
we're stopped on the middle of the highway.

05:37.000 --> 05:39.000
You know, though, I am pretty proud of us, though.

05:39.000 --> 05:43.000
We despite the traffic, we made it out of Washington in the first day.

05:43.000 --> 05:45.000
And that doesn't always happen.

05:45.000 --> 05:48.000
It's day two and we're hurting children and dogs,

05:48.000 --> 05:50.000
which is a sign of success, really.

05:50.000 --> 05:54.000
It means we've actually survived and we made it all the way to Oregon.

05:54.000 --> 05:56.000
There's a lot of driving.

05:56.000 --> 06:00.000
Yeah, I think we're just I could see the border just right there.

06:00.000 --> 06:01.000
So we just just made it.

06:01.000 --> 06:03.000
But it feels great.

06:03.000 --> 06:05.000
Feels like a really nice milestone.

06:05.000 --> 06:07.000
And what are we looking forward to today, Chris?

06:07.000 --> 06:09.000
Getting to Idaho, really.

06:09.000 --> 06:12.000
But I'm curious to know what it's like for you to drive in the States,

06:12.000 --> 06:17.000
to drive in Washington, to go from probably not very many people around,

06:17.000 --> 06:21.000
I would imagine, when you're driving to we were really in the thick of it yesterday.

06:21.000 --> 06:23.000
Yeah, yesterday was a little hairy.

06:23.000 --> 06:28.000
I will say it was nice to have you in front kind of kind of directing the thing.

06:28.000 --> 06:31.000
But it was neat to be strategic together, you know,

06:31.000 --> 06:34.000
have me take command of some lanes to let you in and stuff.

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
But it was hairy there for a while.

06:36.000 --> 06:41.000
There was some accidents and stuff and that just led to some high density,

06:41.000 --> 06:43.000
very high density and people pushing and shoving.

06:43.000 --> 06:48.000
So but we got through it and then it was really quite relaxed and wonderful actually.

06:48.000 --> 06:51.000
Yeah, there was moments where we were just stopped on the road.

06:51.000 --> 06:53.000
We were just stopped, just going to be stopped for a while

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
and we were just going to have to be OK with it.

06:55.000 --> 06:57.000
There was nowhere we were going.

06:57.000 --> 07:01.000
But it was worth it because we got to Oregon, even despite the traffic.

07:01.000 --> 07:03.000
And we had our first night here.

07:03.000 --> 07:08.000
We're parked in a welcome center off grid, the Umtia or something.

07:08.000 --> 07:11.000
I caught the name at one point, Welcome Center, and they allow RV parking.

07:11.000 --> 07:14.000
So we got a spot where there's there's a little road noise.

07:14.000 --> 07:18.000
You could probably hear it in the background, but there's no big truck noise.

07:18.000 --> 07:19.000
It's just us.

07:19.000 --> 07:21.000
So we have the whole place to ourselves.

07:21.000 --> 07:24.000
The kids got to run through their sprinklers last night.

07:24.000 --> 07:26.000
Brent got to go for a nice long walk.

07:26.000 --> 07:27.000
Yeah, that walk was beautiful.

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
This is the Columbia River, I believe.

07:29.000 --> 07:31.000
That's what you told me.

07:31.000 --> 07:35.000
Apparently, I'm supposed to know all about it, but, you know, I'm new here.

07:35.000 --> 07:38.000
But yeah, I walked down by the river and just sort of took it in.

07:38.000 --> 07:44.000
And it made me realize, yeah, we're on a sort of cross America tour a little bit.

07:44.000 --> 07:47.000
You know, we're not doing the whole thing, but we're getting chunks of it in.

07:47.000 --> 07:50.000
And so that really hit me last night when I was walking around.

07:50.000 --> 07:53.000
Yeah, getting a good portion of the West Coast in.

07:53.000 --> 07:55.000
And Columbia River is a big deal around here

07:55.000 --> 07:59.000
because it's what separates the jerks from Oregon from the jerks in Washington.

07:59.000 --> 08:02.000
So, you know, it's a land border.

08:02.000 --> 08:05.000
But now we're going to go pack up and hit the road and see if we can't make it to Idaho.

08:05.000 --> 08:09.000
The traffic was so thick coming out of Washington that Brent ate soup

08:09.000 --> 08:12.000
while we were going down the road just out of the can.

08:12.000 --> 08:13.000
It's true.

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
I had a can in my lap of the spoon.

08:15.000 --> 08:16.000
It worked fairly well.

08:16.000 --> 08:17.000
No dripping too bad.

08:17.000 --> 08:22.000
This portion of the West Coast that we were driving through for the rest of the day into the next day is

08:22.000 --> 08:24.000
it's a lot of farmland.

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
There's not a lot going on.

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
But we did manage our first micro meetup,

08:28.000 --> 08:33.000
and Brent got a real good taste of some of the more interesting aspects of American farm life.

08:33.000 --> 08:36.000
I've never been here before, and I got to say I like it.

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
We made it to a Cracker Barrel.

08:38.000 --> 08:43.000
We also just had our first micro meetup, which turned out great, about five people.

08:43.000 --> 08:48.000
And on our way in, we had an opportunity for Brent to ride Copilot this time.

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
He wasn't driving the entire time.

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
We saw a bunch of really cool things.

08:52.000 --> 08:56.000
One thing I think that stood out for me was we were driving down the highway.

08:56.000 --> 09:02.000
I think we were still in Oregon at that time, and right on the side of the road,

09:02.000 --> 09:09.000
like right juxtaposed with the highway, was this, it was a crop duster.

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
And I had never seen a crop duster.

09:11.000 --> 09:16.000
But the more we, you know, we kind of saw it from a distance sort of doing these tricks that they do.

09:16.000 --> 09:21.000
This little tiny plane just kind of doing all the loop-de-loops that they do is really impressive.

09:21.000 --> 09:26.000
The closer we got, the closer he got to the highway, or she, you know.

09:26.000 --> 09:31.000
And it was super impressive to see the maneuvering, the quick pacing,

09:31.000 --> 09:34.000
and them trying to keep track of where they've already done.

09:34.000 --> 09:41.000
And just as we were like crossing where the plane was working, they banked towards the highway,

09:41.000 --> 09:43.000
and just like that made it.

09:43.000 --> 09:45.000
That was a super highlight for me.

09:45.000 --> 09:47.000
Maniac up in that airplane.

09:47.000 --> 09:50.000
Looked like that's probably the funnest job in farming, I had to think.

09:50.000 --> 09:55.000
So now tonight's game is balancing heat with cooling with power,

09:55.000 --> 10:01.000
because we're doing another night off-grid, and it is hot, and we have to run the air conditioning,

10:01.000 --> 10:04.000
so we have a lot to balance tonight with all of us on board.

10:04.000 --> 10:08.000
So we're going to manage that for a bit, and that's going to be the end of day two.

10:08.000 --> 10:26.000
And then tomorrow we head off towards Utah.

10:26.000 --> 10:31.000
We stayed up really late that night sitting outside just cooling down.

10:31.000 --> 10:36.000
We even let the kids stay up a little late that one because it was so hot you couldn't sleep.

10:36.000 --> 10:39.000
And then you remember how a couple of us would break off onto a walk,

10:39.000 --> 10:43.000
and we'd go explore the shopping area, because this was like the Boise area we were in.

10:43.000 --> 10:47.000
Yeah, I didn't see that shopping area, but I think I'm the only one who didn't see it actually.

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
I don't know what was going on.

10:49.000 --> 10:54.000
But you guys saw some pretty neat stuff there, and it was something we didn't expect, right?

10:54.000 --> 10:59.000
It's funny, some of these stops, like this one we parked at a Cracker Barrel, right?

10:59.000 --> 11:04.000
And it's just really a clear, nice memory, because we sat outside,

11:04.000 --> 11:07.000
we got the outdoor television going that's on the side of JOOPS,

11:07.000 --> 11:13.000
and then after the sunset we decided to just kind of go walk around the shopping area,

11:13.000 --> 11:16.000
and it was just, we had it all to ourselves.

11:16.000 --> 11:21.000
I remember there was another camper there, but they were totally quiet,

11:21.000 --> 11:26.000
and we were trying to be respectful, but at the same time we just sat around in those chairs

11:26.000 --> 11:31.000
and took in the night, and it was super fresh and nice to not be moving in a vehicle anymore,

11:31.000 --> 11:33.000
to be on solid ground.

11:33.000 --> 11:35.000
Right, there's so many pieces that we're managing, right?

11:35.000 --> 11:37.000
Because there's still the JB stuff going on.

11:37.000 --> 11:42.000
Production continues, business operation continues, there's kids, right?

11:42.000 --> 11:46.000
There's just feeding ourselves, and there's the actual function of driving down the road

11:46.000 --> 11:53.000
and navigating and managing traffic, and it's a lot every single day just to be just baseline stuff.

11:53.000 --> 11:56.000
And I think that's why it was kind of frustrating the next day

11:56.000 --> 12:00.000
when it just wasn't as productive as we thought it was going to be.

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
We didn't make it to Salt Lake City like we thought the next day.

12:02.000 --> 12:05.000
In fact, we didn't even make it to Utah.

12:05.000 --> 12:06.000
Where are we, Brent?

12:06.000 --> 12:09.000
I think we're in a place called Twin Falls, Idaho.

12:09.000 --> 12:13.000
We think because we didn't intend to stay here.

12:13.000 --> 12:18.000
As we were driving, first of all, we stopped to take care of some business.

12:18.000 --> 12:19.000
I don't think I'll say what.

12:19.000 --> 12:28.000
Let's just say I had some business to attend to, and then we realized, gosh, it's getting kind of windy.

12:28.000 --> 12:31.000
And then we parked and got some gas, and we thought, you know, it's getting real windy.

12:31.000 --> 12:40.000
We checked the forecast, and we saw wind speeds that just were ridiculous, especially for a 40-foot wind catcher.

12:40.000 --> 12:47.000
Yeah, I saw the predictions taking us to 25 mile per hour gusts, which means it's not consistent.

12:47.000 --> 12:52.000
They just kind of come and go and shake the RV all over even while we're just parked here in the parking lot.

12:52.000 --> 12:58.000
So easy in the focus for me, but not so easy on you, is it, Chris?

12:58.000 --> 12:59.000
Gusts in a way are harder.

12:59.000 --> 13:06.000
If it was consistently 25 miles per hour, I could just turn her into the wind, you know, and just point her down the road and crank the wheel.

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
That happens.

13:08.000 --> 13:18.000
But the gas, the gusts, that's tricky because it just hits you, and at 25 miles per hour, it in the past has actually pushed the RV into the other lane.

13:18.000 --> 13:25.000
So that's when I realized, well, I'm going to have to slow it way down to prevent that from happening, which is fine.

13:25.000 --> 13:32.000
I don't have any problem doing that, but it's a little tricky here where we're at in Idaho because the speed limit's 80 miles per hour.

13:32.000 --> 13:39.000
So when you've got a jerk on the road doing 45-50 in an 80 mile per hour zone, people don't like that.

13:39.000 --> 13:46.000
And so you combine all of that, it just doesn't seem worth it to make it for a campsite reservation.

13:46.000 --> 13:53.000
When we've got everything we need, we can park, we can watch movies for the night, we'll be fine.

13:53.000 --> 13:54.000
We might even get a little work in.

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
Can you imagine that?

13:56.000 --> 13:59.000
I have been meaning to catch up on some emails.

13:59.000 --> 14:01.000
What a night that was.

14:01.000 --> 14:04.000
The wind, the wind wasn't too bad.

14:04.000 --> 14:08.000
It was nice that gas station, there was a spot we could tuck away and we could park at.

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
Dylan came down with an infected tooth.

14:10.000 --> 14:11.000
Oh, yeah.

14:11.000 --> 14:13.000
Oh, man, what timing.

14:13.000 --> 14:17.000
So while we were there, we realized we had to take him to emergency dental care.

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
That was crazy.

14:19.000 --> 14:25.000
But you know what's funny, despite all of that, the unintended stop, the wasted time,

14:25.000 --> 14:31.000
the crazy windstorm, Dylan's infected tooth, that still managed to be one of my favorite nights of the road trip.

14:31.000 --> 14:32.000
Really?

14:32.000 --> 14:39.000
Yeah, because it was such a great example of what's nice about RVing and that is you have your things with you.

14:39.000 --> 14:46.000
And we had a grill with us, a griddle, and we have our fridge and all of our stuff.

14:46.000 --> 14:47.000
And there was a grocery store you and I walked to.

14:47.000 --> 14:48.000
That's true.

14:48.000 --> 14:49.000
I do remember this.

14:49.000 --> 14:50.000
Yeah, that was fun.

14:50.000 --> 14:51.000
Yeah.

14:51.000 --> 14:56.000
And then we came back and we made amazing fish tacos that night.

14:56.000 --> 14:57.000
And we just we had fish tacos.

14:57.000 --> 15:01.000
And we again, I think we watched like some show with the kids or something.

15:01.000 --> 15:09.000
And we put out the chairs and we just sort of we had a great time and it was totally unplanned.

15:09.000 --> 15:11.000
It was even even down to the fish tacos.

15:11.000 --> 15:12.000
It was all impromptu.

15:12.000 --> 15:17.000
But because we had our resources and our things and we could just go to the grocery store and get the fish

15:17.000 --> 15:24.000
and you know, we just had we made a night out of it like it was a campground or something because we had everything we needed.

15:24.000 --> 15:27.000
And I thought that was so nice and it was such good food.

15:27.000 --> 15:34.000
One thing I actually really appreciated about that stop is that was the first time that it made me really realize

15:34.000 --> 15:42.000
that you guys are a well oiled machine when it came to getting the whole rig ready.

15:42.000 --> 15:49.000
But in times when you didn't expect it and also just psychologically being OK with plans changing.

15:49.000 --> 15:50.000
Oh, yeah, sure.

15:50.000 --> 15:52.000
I've traveled with some people and they are not OK with that.

15:52.000 --> 15:53.000
Right.

15:53.000 --> 15:56.000
I think you've got a master plan and we've been planning this for months.

15:56.000 --> 15:59.000
And if you don't hit the milestone, then there's something seriously going to go wrong.

15:59.000 --> 16:06.000
But I think partly my lifestyle made it that I seek that kind of activity out.

16:06.000 --> 16:14.000
But that night when everything felt like it was going wrong, we just switched into this mode and we're like, OK, we're not going to make it.

16:14.000 --> 16:18.000
But here's what we can do. We can do this, this, this and change our plans slightly.

16:18.000 --> 16:19.000
And we had an amazing night.

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
Yeah. And Dylan turned out fine.

16:21.000 --> 16:26.000
He did recover really quick and he wasn't in pain after he got back that night.

16:26.000 --> 16:29.000
And so we all were just in good moods.

16:29.000 --> 16:33.000
And you're right, because we weren't stressing about the fact that, well, we didn't make it to Salt Lake City today.

16:33.000 --> 16:36.000
Yeah, we got to cancel a reservation or maybe we had to eat the cost.

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
But I'm glad we did it.

16:38.000 --> 16:42.000
A 25 miles per hour in itself is not an impossible feat.

16:42.000 --> 16:47.000
But like I said in the clip, when you got the 80 mile per hour roads, that's a little different.

16:47.000 --> 16:48.000
That's for sure.

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
We did get a slow start.

16:50.000 --> 17:03.000
And like I kind of hinted at, there is every now and then the business aspect of RVing that we have to take care of.

17:21.000 --> 17:27.000
Okay, Chris, what are we doing here? What are we doing today? This is our first little adventure. What's going on?

17:27.000 --> 17:31.000
This is the glory part of being the pilot. I got to dump everybody's poop.

17:31.000 --> 17:37.000
So right now we are pulled over in a graciously provided public dumping area by the state of Idaho.

17:37.000 --> 17:42.000
And we're going to leave our poops from Washington and Oregon and Idaho right here.

17:42.000 --> 17:45.000
It's glamorous. It's part of living the road adventure.

17:45.000 --> 17:48.000
So this is like multi-state poop is what you're saying.

17:48.000 --> 17:52.000
Yeah, from a lot of people, although that end over there doesn't look so secure, Brent.

17:52.000 --> 17:55.000
We could have poo all over the place if we're not careful.

17:55.000 --> 18:00.000
See, I've never done this, so we're going to see how it goes.

18:00.000 --> 18:01.000
Everything's connected securely.

18:01.000 --> 18:03.000
Hashtag van life, right?

18:03.000 --> 18:18.000
Oh man, did I ever learn that day?

18:34.000 --> 18:40.000
We didn't flinch and the air flows such that thankfully we don't have to sit around in the stink.

18:43.000 --> 18:48.000
We actually after that, after that delay from the wind and whatnot, we made really good time.

18:48.000 --> 18:49.000
We got down to Salt Lake City.

18:49.000 --> 18:58.000
We stopped at a campground that was absolutely slammed because it was literally right next door to a Post Malone concert.

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
I forgot about this. That was great.

19:00.000 --> 19:03.000
It sure brought a lot of characters to the campground, too.

19:03.000 --> 19:05.000
Yeah, this was the Salt Lake City KOA, wasn't it?

19:05.000 --> 19:07.000
Right. And you know, we were correct.

19:07.000 --> 19:12.000
We were packed in there and that I think that concert went to like midnight.

19:12.000 --> 19:16.000
I remember it being quite late to the point where like, all right, guys.

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
Yeah. Yeah. But you know what?

19:18.000 --> 19:21.000
I did. I did get one opportunity to leave the campground.

19:21.000 --> 19:24.000
One opportunity the entire time we were in Salt Lake City.

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
And you bet it was to go to a meetup.

19:26.000 --> 19:30.000
The sun is setting on day four and we are officially in Salt Lake City.

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
We started in Jerome, Idaho.

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
Last night, we didn't even know where we were.

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
I still kind of don't know where I am.

19:36.000 --> 19:39.000
Yeah. And it all probably blurs together for you, I would imagine.

19:39.000 --> 19:42.000
But we just in a rush, you know, we got parked.

19:42.000 --> 19:43.000
We got settled.

19:43.000 --> 19:44.000
We woke up this morning.

19:44.000 --> 19:50.000
We actually woke up a little late because I think my stupid watch app that I have is like still stuck in Pacific time.

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
So it woke me up an hour late.

19:52.000 --> 19:57.000
But the drive was so pleasant this morning that we made up time in the drive.

19:57.000 --> 19:58.000
So we actually did pretty well.

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
We got here pretty good.

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
It was a beautiful drive, too.

20:02.000 --> 20:07.000
Other than the, you know, general smokiness, we saw some pretty neat things.

20:07.000 --> 20:11.000
There's like these long sites with sort of outlined mountains.

20:11.000 --> 20:14.000
Usually I think you could probably see them, but they were just like these subtle mountains.

20:14.000 --> 20:15.000
Hints of a mountain.

20:15.000 --> 20:17.000
Yeah, it was gorgeous in its own way.

20:17.000 --> 20:23.000
But no wind and the drive was smooth and it does seem like the smoke is following us, though.

20:23.000 --> 20:28.000
The smoke is, in fact, Salt Lake City has some of the worst air quality in the entire world right now.

20:28.000 --> 20:31.000
Number two, I think, in the world right now for worst air quality.

20:31.000 --> 20:33.000
Yeah. And then it moves to Denver.

20:33.000 --> 20:34.000
So the smoke.

20:34.000 --> 20:35.000
Of course.

20:35.000 --> 20:36.000
Yeah, it's cool.

20:36.000 --> 20:37.000
Good planning, guys.

20:37.000 --> 20:39.000
But, you know, we still have fun.

20:39.000 --> 20:40.000
That's all right.

20:40.000 --> 20:41.000
The KOA here is pretty busy.

20:41.000 --> 20:42.000
It's loud.

20:42.000 --> 20:46.000
If it's as loud as it is today, I'm going to have to go somewhere else to record.

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
But a listener offered me their studio potentially.

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000
Wow, really?

20:50.000 --> 20:51.000
Yeah, at the meetup.

20:51.000 --> 20:56.000
Our meetup at Squatters Pub Brewery, not to be confused with a brew pub, was great.

20:56.000 --> 21:00.000
Twenty five-ish people showed up and we had all types there.

21:00.000 --> 21:01.000
Yeah, it was really fun.

21:01.000 --> 21:03.000
I had a bunch of conversation.

21:03.000 --> 21:08.000
I didn't quite get to talk one on one with everyone, but there was some engineers there,

21:08.000 --> 21:12.000
some software developers and some security analysts.

21:12.000 --> 21:13.000
Yeah, it was really neat.

21:13.000 --> 21:15.000
A great varied group.

21:15.000 --> 21:19.000
And of course, some people traveled from far away.

21:19.000 --> 21:23.000
Wyoming, Montana, Idaho, you know, four-hour drive.

21:23.000 --> 21:26.000
There's a lot of locals, too, but some four-hour drives in there.

21:26.000 --> 21:27.000
So it was really neat.

21:27.000 --> 21:28.000
And then the swag was a hit.

21:28.000 --> 21:29.000
You were a swag master.

21:29.000 --> 21:30.000
Well, thank you.

21:30.000 --> 21:31.000
You got to sell the stuff.

21:31.000 --> 21:32.000
Well, I guess we didn't sell it.

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
No, no, we probably could have, though.

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
It was such a hit.

21:36.000 --> 21:39.000
The other thing I noticed was Dax, who brought a challenge coin.

21:39.000 --> 21:40.000
Right.

21:40.000 --> 21:43.000
The last challenge coin, he busted that thing out immediately, too.

21:43.000 --> 21:47.000
And a total fail on our part because you and I had discussed bringing the challenge coin

21:47.000 --> 21:51.000
earlier and then forgot to bring the challenge coin.

21:51.000 --> 21:52.000
I'm embarrassed, you know.

21:52.000 --> 21:56.000
In a way, Salt Lake City is kind of a dry run for Denver, not that it wasn't a great meetup,

21:56.000 --> 21:57.000
because it was.

21:57.000 --> 21:59.000
And maybe it might even be the better of the two because...

21:59.000 --> 22:00.000
It was intimate.

22:00.000 --> 22:01.000
Yeah, it wasn't too big.

22:01.000 --> 22:03.000
Whereas Denver is going to be a much bigger affair.

22:03.000 --> 22:06.000
But I look at that and I think, okay, now here's what I'm going to do differently.

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
Next time I'm going to bring the challenge coin with me.

22:08.000 --> 22:12.000
I'm going to have a few more anecdotes to share, you know, just in case the conversation runs dry.

22:12.000 --> 22:13.000
And that kind of stuff.

22:13.000 --> 22:15.000
But thankfully, everybody was a talker at this one.

22:15.000 --> 22:17.000
So there was no lack of conversation to be had.

22:17.000 --> 22:21.000
And I saw a bunch of people sort of exchanging contact info and they're going to meet up in the future.

22:21.000 --> 22:24.000
So I think we left a little impact here today.

22:24.000 --> 22:29.000
Yeah, we also had a treat of having Bill join us at the campsite.

22:29.000 --> 22:32.000
I don't think he was quite able to make the meetup.

22:32.000 --> 22:35.000
But then I think he got a really nice personal meetup.

22:35.000 --> 22:38.000
Yeah, we got to hang out and we did a little grilling.

22:38.000 --> 22:45.000
And, you know, what's great is it was an opportunity to put faces to people we see in the community all the time.

22:45.000 --> 22:49.000
That was really nice about this road trip is I connected with several people in the community.

22:49.000 --> 22:53.000
And now I have a really good, like, you know, picture in my mind of who they are.

22:53.000 --> 22:56.000
And it's like takes it to another level.

22:56.000 --> 22:59.000
You know, what I noticed, Brent, is going through all of this.

22:59.000 --> 23:05.000
There's a lot that happened between Salt Lake City and Denver.

23:05.000 --> 23:08.000
And so we're going to compress time a little bit here.

23:08.000 --> 23:14.000
And there's just so much to cover that we're just going to compress time because there was a lot of suffering in the heat.

23:14.000 --> 23:20.000
Oh, yeah, I remember. So a lot of what we were doing was moving and just trying to keep the air conditioning going.

23:20.000 --> 23:29.000
We were really kind of going by just the seat of our pants because we were completely off our plan at this point because of the between the reroutes and the closures.

23:29.000 --> 23:32.000
We were really making it up as we went.

23:32.000 --> 23:40.000
And so the best we could figure is maybe what we should do is find a spot we can park the RV for a few hours,

23:40.000 --> 23:43.000
even though it's legitimately like one hundred and ten degrees.

23:43.000 --> 23:48.000
And when the RV stops, it's like it's like, you know, you're baking inside a car.

23:48.000 --> 23:53.000
We could maybe find a spot. And we did. We found that we found the Nebraska Welcome Center.

23:53.000 --> 24:00.000
And then what we thought is we'll head out in like a scout mode and go do some reconnaissance and find a spot where we can camp for a couple of days.

24:00.000 --> 24:03.000
Just kind of get a moment to catch our breath.

24:03.000 --> 24:11.000
We've made it to the Oliver Reservoir in our little expedition, our reconnaissance mission, but it is packed, isn't it?

24:11.000 --> 24:15.000
Like it's just like we thought it was going to be isolated and desolate.

24:15.000 --> 24:20.000
I basically made a prediction. I said it's either going to be absolutely packed or it's going to be absolutely empty.

24:20.000 --> 24:25.000
I was really hoping for the empty reason. The reason being, really, I want to record.

24:25.000 --> 24:31.000
I'm very selfish. I want a podcast. I know it's not everybody's objective in August at a campground.

24:31.000 --> 24:34.000
I didn't see any reviews on the sites about recording either.

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
Yeah, I don't think anybody's tried it.

24:36.000 --> 24:40.000
You know, our little reconnaissance mission was fun at first,

24:40.000 --> 24:45.000
but I remember it feeling like it was going to take a little too long.

24:45.000 --> 24:50.000
But we're totally desperate now. We are just kind of driving down the road,

24:50.000 --> 24:56.000
scouting for places to pull off or anything that's clever. I'm looking at every dirt patch we can find.

24:56.000 --> 25:00.000
We're going to go look at the next town. We're just desperate to find a quiet area.

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
And Brent's a man on a mission.

25:02.000 --> 25:07.000
I'm trying my best to make things better, but I can't will these spots to just appear.

25:07.000 --> 25:11.000
And he's also rolling the tunes for us. He's our tune master.

25:11.000 --> 25:18.000
I admit it was a last moment of inspiration that I had while we were going down the road.

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
Literally, I was having a text conversation with the wife.

25:20.000 --> 25:25.000
She's like, why are you guys still driving? We're roasting. Just give up already.

25:25.000 --> 25:33.000
And right as that all was coming together, it just sort of it struck me, you know, like I was inspired.

25:33.000 --> 25:37.000
We found a golf course and it looks like they allow RVs.

25:37.000 --> 25:43.000
To park here and camp here. It's quiet. It's beautiful. And that's a cell tower right there.

25:43.000 --> 25:48.000
Sure. It's like 200 feet that way. So hopefully we're walking in right now.

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
We're going to go ask them if they're cool with us parking.

25:50.000 --> 25:55.000
You know, I'm not Mr. Like talk to strangers social guy, but after a long day on the road.

25:55.000 --> 25:57.000
Yeah, I was desperate.

25:57.000 --> 26:06.000
Hey there. I'm a Harvest Host member and I saw that you guys are part of that program.

26:06.000 --> 26:09.000
Yeah, I've got a rig. I wouldn't mind parking here. Just want to check with you first.

26:09.000 --> 26:14.000
Yeah, of course. See what that what the deal is. So can I get a name?

26:14.000 --> 26:19.000
Yeah. Chris Fischer. F-I-S-H-E-R.

26:19.000 --> 26:22.000
It's a good phone number.

26:22.000 --> 26:29.000
I'll give you my wife's because that's probably the truth. Which you think I'd have memorized.

26:32.000 --> 26:34.000
Well, I think that's going to work freaking perfect.

26:34.000 --> 26:36.000
It's just when I thought we were out of luck.

26:36.000 --> 26:39.000
I know. It was just we were going down the road and I'm like, you know what?

26:39.000 --> 26:42.000
I'm going to open up the Harvest Host app and check our location and just see what pops up.

26:42.000 --> 26:48.000
And it was five minutes down the road from where we were at almost the point of just giving up.

26:48.000 --> 26:49.000
That's perfect.

26:49.000 --> 26:54.000
Yeah, this is going to work, though. And it's going to be quiet. We should be able to record land. No problem.

26:54.000 --> 26:55.000
Look at us solving problems.

26:55.000 --> 26:58.000
Four.

26:58.000 --> 27:02.000
What was that? Oh, that's just a golf ball hitting juice.

27:02.000 --> 27:03.000
No big deal.

27:03.000 --> 27:11.000
You know, I would describe this golf course as an island in the middle of just nothing but brown Nebraska farms.

27:11.000 --> 27:16.000
And in August, the farms are brown and it was just squares of brown everywhere.

27:16.000 --> 27:22.000
And then in this one spot was this patch of green and trees.

27:22.000 --> 27:26.000
And it was like this shining beacon and it was literally at the top of a hill.

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
It was our salvation, Brent.

27:28.000 --> 27:30.000
The views from there, too.

27:30.000 --> 27:39.000
I think we you know, once we came down from the stress of the drive and we parked jupes and kind of got out.

27:39.000 --> 27:40.000
The views really hit us.

27:40.000 --> 27:50.000
It was it was one of my most memorable nights, again, just totally unintentional because we had this huge, giant field we could play in.

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
The kids could run and run and run and run.

27:52.000 --> 27:56.000
We did chase you. They did. And they needed that.

27:56.000 --> 28:04.000
And so did Levi. Right. And I got to break the drone out and do my fly in and capture, which was truly one of the most special sunsets of the road trip.

28:04.000 --> 28:07.000
It was this guy was doing some crazy stuff that night.

28:07.000 --> 28:19.000
And then all night long, we were treated to this U shaped or a horseshoe shaped, I should say, thunderstorm that was going on around us.

28:19.000 --> 28:21.000
We were we were sort of in the middle of it.

28:21.000 --> 28:24.000
And it was just like it was lightning constantly.

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
But there was really not a lot of thunder.

28:26.000 --> 28:27.000
So it was really pleasant.

28:27.000 --> 28:32.000
Yeah, it's like despite where we were, we weren't getting hit by the rain that I imagine.

28:32.000 --> 28:37.000
Right with that, although we were able to take it all in along the entire horizon, it seemed.

28:37.000 --> 28:40.000
Yeah, you could you could just sit there and look all around you.

28:40.000 --> 28:42.000
And you just saw all these lightning storms in the distance.

28:42.000 --> 28:47.000
And then after the storms faded, it was a clear sky.

28:47.000 --> 28:52.000
And it was one of those special moments where I was out there with the kids and we saw a shooting star.

28:52.000 --> 29:02.000
It was like sort of came up so small you can see and then it got big and then it was so fast and then it got suddenly small.

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
And then it was gone. Yeah, it was just gone.

29:04.000 --> 29:08.000
But it had like orange at the end. Did you wish for anything?

29:08.000 --> 29:11.000
Yeah. What? It's a secret.

29:11.000 --> 29:13.000
All right. I understand.

29:13.000 --> 29:14.000
I still don't know what she wished for.

29:14.000 --> 29:16.000
Well, we'll have to see if it comes true.

29:16.000 --> 29:19.000
Something tells me it wasn't cheap gas prices for dad.

29:19.000 --> 29:28.000
I could have stayed. You know, I really I found it to be a peaceful kind of, you know, find my Zen again spot.

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
But the show had to go on.

29:30.000 --> 29:35.000
I just had to take one more walk to just soak in this Nebraska view.

29:35.000 --> 29:38.000
You know, online, people have been mocking Nebraska for being flat.

29:38.000 --> 29:41.000
But I'd say it's kind of roly poly where we're at.

29:41.000 --> 29:43.000
Lots of hills. It's beautiful.

29:43.000 --> 29:46.000
And in the evenings, it's just incredible.

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
I mean, the temperatures today were we're harsh.

29:48.000 --> 29:55.000
I think it may have gotten up to one hundred and twenty degrees in my front cab where I was recording Linux action news today.

29:55.000 --> 29:58.000
But it's so much better now.

29:58.000 --> 30:02.000
And we're packing up to head into Denver.

30:02.000 --> 30:07.000
I could have waited an extra day here here in our golf course.

30:07.000 --> 30:10.000
But we do have to press on.

30:10.000 --> 30:12.000
We have much to do.

30:12.000 --> 30:15.000
Denver is going to be very busy.

30:15.000 --> 30:18.000
We're going to pull together and do an evening drive as a crew.

30:18.000 --> 30:25.000
It'll probably be dark by the time we get to Denver, but might mean the roads are clear.

30:25.000 --> 30:31.000
The roads were clear, but they were rough.

30:31.000 --> 30:34.000
They were memorably rough.

30:34.000 --> 30:42.000
We actually damaged the RV, which we wouldn't discover until later in the road trip, and it would end up stranding us in Tucson.

30:42.000 --> 30:50.000
But that is a story for another episode, because what happened after that clip, if you take out the bad stuff, was very special.

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
We got into Denver.

30:52.000 --> 30:57.000
We spent a couple of days at the System 76 parking lot reconnecting with the crew.

30:57.000 --> 31:08.000
Then eventually we went and parked in a residential area and spent time with Emma and her family, which was the highlight of the entire trip.

31:08.000 --> 31:16.000
Once we were established, and had been there for a couple of days, we had the crew fly out.

31:16.000 --> 31:21.000
We got an Airbnb for everyone, and they all got to come out.

31:21.000 --> 31:25.000
They could either stay in a hotel if they wanted to, or stay in the Airbnb.

31:25.000 --> 31:30.000
Hadi and I remained in the RV, because we have to keep the systems maintained and manned.

31:30.000 --> 31:31.000
Not to mention it's your home.

31:31.000 --> 31:33.000
Yeah, that's the benefit of having our home there, right?

31:33.000 --> 31:35.000
We don't have to stay in a hotel or an Airbnb.

31:35.000 --> 31:38.000
Although the Airbnb was great.

31:38.000 --> 31:41.000
We still were like, it was funny.

31:41.000 --> 31:44.000
We just lived somewhere else and had a different commute, right?

31:44.000 --> 31:47.000
We would just commute to you guys, which was great.

31:47.000 --> 31:51.000
It was time to go see System 76, so I had to go collect the crew.

31:56.000 --> 31:57.000
Well, good morning, Brent.

31:57.000 --> 31:58.000
Hi, Chris.

31:58.000 --> 31:59.000
Hey, Dale.

31:59.000 --> 32:00.000
Levi.

32:00.000 --> 32:01.000
How did everybody sleep?

32:01.000 --> 32:02.000
Excellent.

32:02.000 --> 32:03.000
This place is great.

32:03.000 --> 32:08.000
That was a great strategy, too, I think, instead of getting individual hotel rooms for everybody,

32:08.000 --> 32:10.000
because we don't get to spend a lot of time together.

32:10.000 --> 32:17.000
And having an Airbnb that has a washer and dryer and a kitchen, and it had three different levels,

32:17.000 --> 32:21.000
so you could have people socializing in one area, the kids could be downstairs,

32:21.000 --> 32:27.000
and there were bedrooms upstairs, and I just think it just really hit the sweet spot for us.

32:27.000 --> 32:31.000
And it turned out to only be like 10 minutes away from System 76, too.

32:31.000 --> 32:32.000
Yeah, it was great.

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
Lots of walking areas.

32:34.000 --> 32:39.000
I remember I walked down there with the kids, maybe one of them was on my back at the time,

32:39.000 --> 32:43.000
and we just ran into Wes, because he was out for a walk, too.

32:43.000 --> 32:44.000
That was really nice.

32:44.000 --> 32:49.000
And there's something, too, about the whole crew being under the same roof.

32:49.000 --> 32:51.000
There's just a magic that came with that.

32:51.000 --> 32:53.000
Yeah, and just the different conversations going on,

32:53.000 --> 32:56.000
and then the times where the whole group would come together, especially in the kitchen.

32:56.000 --> 32:57.000
That happened a lot.

32:57.000 --> 33:02.000
But then you'd have some people in the living room and some people outside on the back porch,

33:02.000 --> 33:04.000
because, of course, the weather was just absolutely beautiful.

33:04.000 --> 33:06.000
It was just a great time to be there.

33:06.000 --> 33:10.000
And we had an amazing tour at System 76.

33:10.000 --> 33:17.000
As you can probably tell by the noise, we are at the CNC machine and the powder-coating dust machine.

33:17.000 --> 33:19.000
This is probably my favorite part of the tour.

33:19.000 --> 33:26.000
These are some serious machines, you know, $500,000 machines, and they work like non-stop.

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
And it's always something.

33:28.000 --> 33:32.000
Parts to hold up a PCI card, to the base of the launch keyboard,

33:32.000 --> 33:36.000
to just a simple bracket that holds on a logo.

33:36.000 --> 33:42.000
It all goes through here, and it's an impressive set of machinery.

33:42.000 --> 33:46.000
We're going to have to do an entire episode on that tour, because we got a lot of audio.

33:46.000 --> 33:50.000
That tour was magically eye-opening

33:50.000 --> 33:56.000
and a real opportunity to get into the minds and hearts of the people who are making stuff at System 76.

33:56.000 --> 34:00.000
And I have to say, we were really looking forward to it, but it was even better than that.

34:00.000 --> 34:02.000
Oh, beyond our expectations.

34:02.000 --> 34:07.000
They really spent the time to walk us through the genesis of the launch keyboard

34:07.000 --> 34:10.000
and really understand their process they went into there.

34:10.000 --> 34:16.000
They also took the time to show us their Q&A, both their software Q&A,

34:16.000 --> 34:22.000
but also their physical Q&A that they actually do to the hardware devices, like the endurance testing.

34:22.000 --> 34:27.000
And I think it's at such a bigger scale than people realize,

34:27.000 --> 34:29.000
so we got to tell that story separately.

34:29.000 --> 34:30.000
But it was great.

34:30.000 --> 34:36.000
They also gave us an audio booth that we could produce a Linux unplugged out of live, which was really amazing.

34:36.000 --> 34:40.000
And then, of course, we had our meetup there in Denver at Pindustry.

34:40.000 --> 34:46.000
And I don't know, I probably lost count at like 125.

34:46.000 --> 34:49.000
It was so crazy.

34:49.000 --> 34:53.000
I remember walking in a little later than most people.

34:53.000 --> 34:57.000
I think I just needed a little time to myself, and it was bumping.

34:57.000 --> 35:01.000
Like, there were so many people in there, and you could tell it was just our kind of people

35:01.000 --> 35:05.000
because there were conversations happening in every little tiny corner of this place.

35:05.000 --> 35:07.000
Tons of people playing games and just having a great time.

35:07.000 --> 35:08.000
Giveaways.

35:08.000 --> 35:09.000
Giveaways, of course.

35:09.000 --> 35:12.000
And I still remember everybody I met there.

35:12.000 --> 35:15.000
That's really what so stands out for me.

35:15.000 --> 35:20.000
And when they come on like the Mumble Room now and stuff like that, it's like, oh, how you doing?

35:20.000 --> 35:21.000
But I know why you were late.

35:21.000 --> 35:23.000
I know why you strolled in late.

35:23.000 --> 35:25.000
You don't remember?

35:25.000 --> 35:26.000
I recall.

35:26.000 --> 35:27.000
No, I don't actually.

35:27.000 --> 35:30.000
It's because for some reason, the hosts, like the podcast hosts,

35:30.000 --> 35:33.000
we ended up being the ones to go get all the extra donuts.

35:33.000 --> 35:34.000
Oh, my goodness.

35:34.000 --> 35:35.000
Why was that the case?

35:35.000 --> 35:38.000
And we had to go downtown, and there was traffic.

35:38.000 --> 35:39.000
That's true.

35:39.000 --> 35:41.000
And I was driving, and it was mildly stressful.

35:41.000 --> 35:42.000
Yes, it was.

35:42.000 --> 35:43.000
Yes.

35:43.000 --> 35:44.000
Man, I don't remember that.

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
I remember they couldn't find our order.

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
Somehow it was like 500 donuts.

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
And there was this huge stack of donuts.

35:50.000 --> 35:53.000
And we're like, we're pretty sure those are our donuts.

35:53.000 --> 35:55.000
Yeah.

35:55.000 --> 35:56.000
I mean, there was so much.

35:56.000 --> 36:01.000
And we got a bunch of great chats with community members.

36:01.000 --> 36:05.000
We had an opportunity to fly in a listener, Cessna, a listener, Mike.

36:05.000 --> 36:08.000
And that was really incredible to be able to see Denver at that perspective.

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
You know, when you finally arrive somewhere

36:10.000 --> 36:14.000
and then be able to get that high-level perspective, that was really great.

36:14.000 --> 36:17.000
But there were so many things that we could say about the trip

36:17.000 --> 36:20.000
that I thought it'd be fun to end it with the kids' perspective on the trip

36:20.000 --> 36:23.000
because, you know, the kids, they observe the darnedest things.

36:23.000 --> 36:25.000
Well, today is go-home day for you.

36:25.000 --> 36:26.000
Mm-hmm.

36:26.000 --> 36:28.000
How you feeling?

36:28.000 --> 36:29.000
Excited.

36:29.000 --> 36:30.000
Epic road trip?

36:30.000 --> 36:31.000
Uh-huh.

36:31.000 --> 36:32.000
One of our most epic?

36:32.000 --> 36:33.000
Yeah.

36:33.000 --> 36:34.000
You think so?

36:34.000 --> 36:35.000
Yeah.

36:35.000 --> 36:36.000
What was your favorite part?

36:36.000 --> 36:39.000
I liked the Colorado meetup.

36:39.000 --> 36:43.000
And I liked the party that we had at Enno's place.

36:43.000 --> 36:44.000
Parties.

36:44.000 --> 36:45.000
Two nights.

36:45.000 --> 36:47.000
Like two nights before.

36:47.000 --> 36:50.000
And?

36:50.000 --> 36:51.000
Carl's Tesla.

36:51.000 --> 36:53.000
Oh, yeah, Carl's Tesla.

36:53.000 --> 36:54.000
That was awesome.

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
That was awesome.

36:56.000 --> 36:57.000
You can sit down.

36:57.000 --> 36:59.000
Okay.

36:59.000 --> 37:00.000
Did you have a good road trip?

37:00.000 --> 37:01.000
Yeah.

37:01.000 --> 37:03.000
What was your favorite part?

37:03.000 --> 37:05.000
The Airbnb?

37:05.000 --> 37:06.000
Yeah.

37:06.000 --> 37:07.000
Yeah.

37:07.000 --> 37:08.000
You liked it here, didn't you?

37:08.000 --> 37:09.000
Yeah.

37:09.000 --> 37:10.000
And the Tesla.

37:10.000 --> 37:11.000
Yeah.

37:11.000 --> 37:12.000
Carl's Tesla.

37:12.000 --> 37:13.000
Yeah.

37:13.000 --> 37:14.000
By making people fart.

37:14.000 --> 37:15.000
Hello, Abigail.

37:15.000 --> 37:16.000
It's the last day of the road trip.

37:16.000 --> 37:17.000
Yeah.

37:17.000 --> 37:18.000
I'm excited and not excited.

37:18.000 --> 37:19.000
Yeah?

37:19.000 --> 37:20.000
What do you mean?

37:20.000 --> 37:25.000
Well, I'm excited to go back to school and see if it's actually going to be fun

37:25.000 --> 37:32.000
and see my own room and have my own privacy,

37:32.000 --> 37:35.000
but I don't want the road trip to end,

37:35.000 --> 37:39.000
because then we have to leave and go back to Washington.

37:39.000 --> 37:40.000
Regular old life.

37:40.000 --> 37:41.000
Mm-hmm.

37:41.000 --> 37:43.000
Was it an epic road trip for you?

37:43.000 --> 37:44.000
Yeah.

37:44.000 --> 37:45.000
What was your favorite part?

37:45.000 --> 37:46.000
A lot of it.

37:46.000 --> 37:48.000
I really liked the meetup.

37:48.000 --> 37:49.000
Yeah.

37:49.000 --> 37:50.000
Last night's meetup?

37:50.000 --> 37:51.000
Yeah.

37:51.000 --> 37:52.000
Yeah.

37:52.000 --> 37:53.000
Do you even remember?

37:53.000 --> 37:54.000
Remember how we did one in Salt Lake City, too?

37:54.000 --> 37:55.000
Yeah.

37:55.000 --> 37:57.000
I feel like forever ago.

37:57.000 --> 37:59.000
So your favorite part was the meetup.

37:59.000 --> 38:01.000
What was your second favorite part?

38:01.000 --> 38:04.000
I really liked the Airbnb.

38:04.000 --> 38:05.000
Oh, yeah.

38:05.000 --> 38:06.000
This was a great Airbnb, huh?

38:06.000 --> 38:07.000
Yeah.

38:07.000 --> 38:09.000
I thought you were going to say Carl's Tesla.

38:09.000 --> 38:10.000
Oh, yeah.

38:10.000 --> 38:11.000
Carl's Tesla was really awesome.

38:11.000 --> 38:13.000
I'm not singing about buying a Tesla.

38:13.000 --> 38:15.000
We should talk her into it, huh?

38:15.000 --> 38:16.000
Yes.

38:16.000 --> 38:21.000
Like I say, they observed the darnedest things in Carl's Tesla.

38:21.000 --> 38:23.000
That was a big moment for them.

38:23.000 --> 38:27.000
It was an incredible road trip, and coming up really soon in the extras feed,

38:27.000 --> 38:31.000
Brent and I have a special on the tech we used to make the road trip possible.

38:31.000 --> 38:35.000
We sure do, and as you can imagine, it's quite the combination of different technologies.

38:35.000 --> 38:39.000
And thank you to Linode for making the road trip possible, the reunion.

38:39.000 --> 38:42.000
Go to ColonyTracker.live to get $100 in Linode credit.

38:42.000 --> 39:01.000
Keep it bookmarked for the next road trip.
