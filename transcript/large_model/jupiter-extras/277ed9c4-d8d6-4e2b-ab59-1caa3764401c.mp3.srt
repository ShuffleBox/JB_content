00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,120
Hi everyone, Joe here with another User Error Extra. This time it's a conversation that

2
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:14,700
I didn't want to put in the main show. It was a conversation that we kind of needed

3
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:21,340
to have and we're going to have regardless and I thought let's record it and see how

4
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:27,320
it works out and maybe release it as an extra. I didn't want to put current events in User

5
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:31,360
Error. That's not what the show is about. The show is supposed to be entertainment and

6
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:37,240
it's supposed to take your mind off things. But I knew that if we didn't have this conversation

7
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:43,840
before we recorded the main show then the current events would slip into the show somehow.

8
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:47,960
I didn't actually tell Dan and Poppy what my plan was. I just asked them the question

9
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:52,120
once we'd started recording and kind of had in the back of my mind that maybe it'd work

10
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:58,200
as an extra and so that's why at the beginning of a recent episode you heard Dan say that

11
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:02,000
they'd been tricked into recording an extra but I checked with them and they said it was

12
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:09,000
fine to put it out. So without further ado, let's hear it.

13
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,420
What do you think is going to change as a result of all of this virus business? Is working

14
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:19,160
from home going to become the norm? Is that going to be the answer to climate change or

15
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:22,840
are people just going to go back to normal when it gets back to normal?

16
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:27,440
I think a lot of people will go back to normal but I think people will have that realization

17
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:33,520
that actually is technically possible for a lot of people. Yes, I know some people can't

18
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:38,840
but a lot of people can actually technically work from home and also the fact that the

19
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:46,480
kids can be schooled from home. I know some people school from home already but my kids,

20
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:54,280
Sam has been sat there with iPad out and being set work and normally he'd be sat in the classroom

21
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:58,560
with a bunch of his mates but he's actually in his bedroom working.

22
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,680
But isn't school about interacting with other kids and learning life lessons rather than

23
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:07,520
learning the actual school work? Well, it's a bit of both really. I think what it might

24
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:13,120
end up being is people realize that a proportion of work can be done remotely. It doesn't have

25
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:20,000
to be 100% on site. Maybe one day a week they stop going to school and maybe they work from

26
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,000
home. There's 20% of your carbon footprint knocked on the head in one go.

27
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,260
Yeah, definitely would be interesting to see if more people are just straight up working

28
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:32,160
from home or if there's more of like a hybrid approach.

29
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:36,280
I think you're probably right that hybrid approach will be what it is and it might be

30
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:43,440
half and half maybe and you'll schedule days that you need to work together or whatever

31
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:48,640
and it'll be, I don't know, maybe it'll be the norm to mostly work from home because

32
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:53,080
what I'm wondering is who is going to be the first office to say, right, everyone come

33
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:57,360
back in then. No one's going to want to be that firm, are they?

34
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,840
No, I think they'll all do that.

35
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:01,720
Yeah, I think they will too. They won't give a shit.

36
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:06,960
But I do think there's the possibility that this is going to be beneficial for the employer

37
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:13,040
as well because those days that someone might stay at home when the gas man is coming or

38
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:18,960
when they need to have their boiler serviced or whatever it might be, rather than taking

39
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:23,280
a day off and not being able to do any work because they're at home, maybe they'll organise

40
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:27,720
it so actually you can work from home on the day when you have to be there, like whatever

41
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:35,160
the life thing is that you have to do and the employee benefits because they don't have

42
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:39,480
to take a day off to do it and the employer benefits because you're not losing a day's

43
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:43,160
productivity out of someone. Yeah, okay, it might be slightly different productivity and

44
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:47,760
they can't come into meetings and stuff but there will be proof that it manifestly is

45
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,520
possible because for months we'll have been doing it.

46
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:57,640
Yeah, I wonder how many people will not be taking sick time or PTO when they just don't

47
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:00,960
want to come into the office and be like, you know, I'm feeling a little bit under the

48
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,600
weather today, I'm just going to work from home today.

49
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:09,400
I think companies will certainly enact policies. I think it will be employee-led, there will

50
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:15,120
be employees pushing from the bottom and innovative companies will push from the top and say,

51
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:20,000
hey, it really works during coronavirus, we're going to do a sea change. I mean, they could

52
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,120
reduce their office size, they can reduce the infrastructure that they need inside those

53
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:29,920
offices and reduce their carbon footprint, all the things that people want to do, reduce

54
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:34,600
their costs, you know, if they've got an expensive office in a central city. There's so many

55
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:41,260
things about working remotely that even if you only do it half the time, everyone benefits.

56
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:46,320
How wild would it be if more offices just like rented a co-working space every once

57
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:50,480
in a while, you just kind of had a rotating schedule and one company shares, you know,

58
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:53,920
an office building with five other companies and they just each go in one different day?

59
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:58,960
Yeah, I don't doubt that those companies that run those type of places are going to be showing

60
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:05,160
research after all this calms down that, you know, co-working places are the best way to,

61
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:09,120
you know, optimize your homeworking, you know, strike that balance between someone working

62
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:13,420
at home and working in an office because you get the benefit of being in a room with other

63
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:19,840
people and you're not traveling a long distance into the office maybe. I don't know. I think

64
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:20,840
you're right.

65
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:25,880
What's that going to mean for the price of rents and property, commercial property in

66
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:31,740
central locations? If there are fewer people working in those locations, then each office

67
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:36,240
will scale down or be looking to scale down or share spaces or whatever. So there'll just

68
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:40,760
be less demand. So does that mean that the price will go down and therefore will housing

69
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:43,360
go down as well closer to the center?

70
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,360
Possibly.

71
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:51,440
I don't know because I feel like that there's so many places that are just vacant even before

72
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:57,120
all this, where the landlords didn't want to lower the rent and they were like, well,

73
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:01,400
we think we can get this much for it. And they're just vacant for like years. It's weird.

74
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:05,160
You'd think they would just lower the prices, but they just like hold out.

75
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:09,360
Not in the UK because they brought in a law that says that if you are the landlord of

76
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:16,240
a commercial premises and it's vacant, I think if it's vacant at all, you have to pay the

77
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:21,120
business rates, which is like one of the taxes you have to pay for a business. And so that's

78
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:25,880
normally paid for by the tenant. But if it's empty, then the landlord has to pay it. So

79
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:30,200
not only are they not getting income, it's actually actively costing them money. And

80
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:34,960
so that is the incentive to lower the rents and get businesses in there.

81
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:41,440
So one of the things Canonical did in London is we downsized the head office. We had like,

82
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:48,120
I don't know, a half of a floor in a building. And because some people work from home and

83
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:54,920
then some people left and maybe weren't replaced, then we had a lot of people quite spread out

84
00:06:54,920 --> 00:07:00,780
in half a floor of a fairly sizable building. So they squished everyone up a little bit.

85
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:05,640
It's not like super compact, it's like reasonable space. But they squished everyone up a little

86
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:11,480
bit, got rid of a few meeting rooms and carved off a chunk. And that's I don't know, legally

87
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:14,560
how they've done it, whether it's sublet or they've given it back to the building. But

88
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:18,680
there's now an additional company now in that building in central London. So maybe that's

89
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:24,120
the way you do it. Because you downsize your company, move to another office or shrink

90
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:28,480
the office you're in and either sublet it out to somebody else or turn that into co-working

91
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:32,960
space. And other people could come and maybe your or some of your people could use that

92
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:37,440
as co-working space. But also you could have other people coming in and using it as co-working

93
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:42,000
space. So I don't necessarily think that the downsizing will necessarily be a bad thing

94
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:47,680
for rent because people will still want spaces to meet with people, I think.

95
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:55,320
And maybe people who otherwise couldn't afford big offices in town, they can afford a smaller

96
00:07:55,320 --> 00:08:02,560
one. So maybe it'll work. I still think that there will be, instead of a premium on premises

97
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:08,840
and houses in town, I think the premium will start to shift towards decent internet and

98
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:14,320
infrastructure and house prices. I'm not saying it'll be the only factor, but I think that

99
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:20,560
going forward, people will be seriously looking at the potential internet speed of houses.

100
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:25,300
And before it was just, oh, it's got broadband, that's fine. If that was 20 megabit, now that

101
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:28,960
they'll be thinking, well, that's not good enough. I only want to live somewhere that's

102
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:35,240
like 50 or 100 plus. And maybe that will now be a factor on the cost of housing.

103
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:39,040
I don't know anyone who doesn't factor the speed of their broadband into-

104
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:44,880
Yeah, because you work in IT. But normal people just, you know, has it got internet? Has it

105
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:48,920
got broadband? Yeah. Okay. And then they, you know, they just deal with like six or

106
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:51,680
10 megabit DSL or whatever.

107
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:56,440
Yeah. I definitely think I agree with Joe that I don't think the majority of people

108
00:08:56,440 --> 00:09:04,520
really understand how much bandwidth is or what things require or like, I don't even

109
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:09,500
really know anything about like, what does a reasonable latency? Like, I don't know.

110
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:14,520
So I think that that's not something that people really understand. And I don't know

111
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:20,180
if this will necessarily get them to understand. They'll just be like, well, it didn't work.

112
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:21,860
The internet's not good.

113
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:27,800
Maybe the internet providers, the broadband providers will have a work from home package

114
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:34,040
that like optimizes zoom and hangouts and, you know, video chat stuff, optimizes that

115
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:39,840
traffic. And, you know, during the during the day and Netflix during the evening or

116
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:44,960
something like that, you know, maybe, maybe they'll start marketing towards those people

117
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:50,880
who are looking to work from home and have their little office. Maybe people will start

118
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:59,120
advertising, you know, better office equipment for home, like tailored for home that has,

119
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:02,960
you know, a nice laptop desk and you know, that stuff that is already there, but they'll

120
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:09,920
be marketed directly towards people who want to work from home. I think we'll probably

121
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,720
see more of that as well.

122
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:15,600
You know, what I'm really interested to see is how many people just absolutely blow through

123
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:21,600
their data caps, like every month, because that's the thing that not so much here, but

124
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,240
in America, that's pretty standard to have a cap, isn't it?

125
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:29,080
Yeah. And luckily, the provider that I have doesn't have a cap. But when I had Comcast,

126
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:36,080
like we had, I don't know, three, four people using it, and we would be at or, or above

127
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:40,160
our data cap, like almost every month and had to start telling people like, hey, okay,

128
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:44,240
like we need to figure out how to not, you know, watch as many movies or whatever is

129
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:47,240
going on, because we're going to get charged pretty quick here.

130
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:51,880
Yeah, I have read that that is surely going to happen that they're going to have to lift

131
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:57,680
those caps, at least temporarily. It's interesting how all the things that you think are set

132
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:06,840
in stone in life have suddenly been changed. Like, I think yesterday, I saw a tweet from

133
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:15,280
the transport minister that the annual motor vehicle testing, because people can't leave

134
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:19,320
their house and can't take their car to a garage and have it tested, that's just going

135
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:26,640
to be extended for six months. So if your car after 30th of March is due for its MOT

136
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:32,520
test, then you just get extended for six months. Mine's due on the 28th of March. So I'm a

137
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:34,160
little bit salty about that.

138
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:38,600
I'm a little confused personally about what to do with my residential parking permit,

139
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:44,320
because the Department of Revenue is closed. So I can't go in to submit my documents to

140
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:49,920
get a new one. And it expires at the end of the month. So I have no idea who the hell's

141
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:53,080
going to come around and give you a ticket. There's like nobody working. It's not like,

142
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:57,760
I don't know, is a traffic enforcement officers out in the street? I don't know. I mean, that's

143
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:01,800
the question is like, there's been no statements. There's not even information. They didn't

144
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:06,240
even say on the website that we're going to be closed. It's weird. So it's like, I don't

145
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,760
know what's going to happen. Am I just going to get tickets all of a sudden and then have

146
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:12,200
to be like, Oh, okay. Well, you weren't even open. How am I supposed to get a pass? We're

147
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,200
living in weird times.

148
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:19,120
That's what I mean. It's like, everything's up for grabs. Everything can be changed. Suddenly

149
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:24,240
my wife gets furloughed from work. She just gets an email that says, Hey, you've been

150
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:29,520
furloughed. Stay at home. Don't come in. You'll be paid 80% of your salary up to two and a

151
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:35,080
half thousand, whatever, whichever, you know, and that's it. Like she's been knocking around

152
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:38,840
the house thinking, what the hell am I supposed to do? I, you know, I was working last week.

153
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:44,720
I was going to work and now I'm sat at home and the house is tidier than it's ever been.

154
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:47,600
I can tell you. So yeah, that's quite good.

155
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:52,880
It's really weird for me. Like I'm just stuck in the house all the time, just making podcasts

156
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:57,320
and sitting on my ass drinking and occasionally going out for a walk at night. It's my life

157
00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:01,760
has just been turned upside down by this.
