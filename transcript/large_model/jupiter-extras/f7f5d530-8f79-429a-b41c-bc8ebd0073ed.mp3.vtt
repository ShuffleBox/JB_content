00:00.000 --> 00:05.680
How you doing Brent? So we were talking on telegram earlier about upgrading your wi-fi

00:05.680 --> 00:10.560
and your router and your firewall and stuffs and things and things and stuff.

00:11.360 --> 00:13.680
So tell me what's going on man?

00:13.680 --> 00:18.320
I mean you have a small part in this. We've been upgrading some of my devices.

00:19.280 --> 00:25.280
So I got an axe 250 and it seems I'm just taking all my legacy devices and getting fancier. So I

00:25.280 --> 00:30.160
was thinking geez that router I've got in the closet over there is pretty darn old.

00:30.160 --> 00:34.800
It's an old WRT-54G which were pretty classic what like 10 years ago.

00:36.000 --> 00:40.240
It's got some custom firmware and all that stuff which is super great but it's,

00:41.360 --> 00:45.120
I think it's time. It's feeling really slow on the wi-fi.

00:45.120 --> 00:46.960
What are you running on the firmware side?

00:47.840 --> 00:53.840
I'm running tomato on that thing. It hasn't been updated maybe in two years.

00:53.840 --> 00:55.120
Some say tomato.

00:55.120 --> 01:03.360
Tomato. Some say tomato and router. So I'm just feeling like I don't know it seems like

01:03.360 --> 01:07.520
the time to start upgrading everything. At least I've got some momentum so I thought geez

01:08.080 --> 01:11.680
you might just be the perfect person to ask. So I don't know what I'm doing

01:11.680 --> 01:16.080
and I'm quite stale on the hardware side so I need some recommendations.

01:16.080 --> 01:18.560
I can certainly help you spend some money if that's what you mean.

01:18.560 --> 01:21.120
Oh well I wasn't that wasn't at the top of the list.

01:21.120 --> 01:26.000
I'm good at that. Let's not make it too formal like you must have some idea of what your

01:26.000 --> 01:33.520
requirements are like low power or something. Open source preferably that kind of stuff right?

01:33.520 --> 01:39.120
Yeah I would say at the top of the list if I'm trying to do it prioritizing I would say

01:39.680 --> 01:48.400
open source all the way. I would say low power is always nice but a higher priority than that

01:48.400 --> 01:55.760
would be you know things like stability and for me honestly the most practical thing would be

01:55.760 --> 02:01.520
some really reliable Wi-Fi. Other than that I'm pretty open you know so you know as low of budget

02:01.520 --> 02:06.080
is great but I would rather look at options that would last a long time. I'd rather do this once

02:06.080 --> 02:09.760
and have it be really kind of flexible so that's my preference.

02:09.760 --> 02:13.520
Sounds like Wi-Fi is the primary driver here is that right? Is that fair?

02:13.520 --> 02:15.120
Yeah ethernet's easy.

02:15.120 --> 02:23.200
Yeah so your current router firewall situation have you ever felt that the

02:23.920 --> 02:28.160
the ingress egress kind of performance is not where you need it?

02:28.160 --> 02:34.640
Well I have quite low needs I would say you know the needs that you have may be a little

02:34.640 --> 02:40.880
bit more sophisticated than mine so at this point I'm just you know I'm probably more like your

02:40.880 --> 02:47.760
regular old user than I am sort of a power user. Now I would love to change that but in terms of

02:48.320 --> 02:55.040
my sophistication I would say I don't know any better so I would love to gain access to local

02:55.040 --> 02:59.280
stuff because you and I are probably going to have another one of these chats to set me up with a

03:00.560 --> 03:05.360
local NAS and stuff like that to do some fancy things and I am container uninitiated so there's

03:05.360 --> 03:11.360
a lot that can happen here so I want to put in a solution that can accommodate all that you know.

03:11.360 --> 03:15.200
That's quite literally Pandora's box you're opening here you do realize that right?

03:15.200 --> 03:16.640
Hey man bring it on.

03:16.640 --> 03:22.960
So I'm a huge fan of separating my firewall from my Wi-Fi and there's a few reasons for that but

03:22.960 --> 03:30.960
the primary one is that I can reboot my firewall and all of my Wi-Fi devices don't freak out for

03:30.960 --> 03:38.080
10 minutes whilst they find the Wi-Fi again. So about five years ago I bought some uh it was a

03:38.080 --> 03:45.120
pair actually of UniFi AC dual radio pro access points. I was on the fence at the time about

03:45.120 --> 03:49.600
buying the pro version because everybody told me it was overkill and you won't need it and blah

03:49.600 --> 03:56.080
blah blah but here I am several years later and I don't feel any need to replace or upgrade my Wi-Fi

03:56.080 --> 04:01.280
so that's the first benefit. The second benefit is that if I want to switch out my firewalls

04:01.280 --> 04:08.480
for any reason so let's say I decided I wanted to switch from my ISP provided router to PF sense

04:08.480 --> 04:17.200
or ViOS or monowall or whatever else it is a UniFi security gateway even it makes the entire solution

04:17.200 --> 04:22.240
a lot more modular. So kind of what I'm thinking might work well for you in this situation is I'm

04:22.240 --> 04:27.280
not hearing any complaints about the throughput or routing performance of your current router

04:28.240 --> 04:34.480
that basically your firewall seems like that's doing the job that you need it to do where it is

04:35.200 --> 04:41.440
failing for you seems to be the Wi-Fi. So the obvious solution to me at this point would be to

04:41.440 --> 04:47.840
get a hundred dollar or so UniFi access point plug that into one of the ethernet ports on the router

04:47.840 --> 04:57.200
and then just use the UniFi SSID that broadcasts and the modern AC Wi-Fi standards and then if and

04:57.200 --> 05:04.160
when you ever decide that that tomato based router isn't doing what you need it to do maybe you could

05:04.160 --> 05:10.080
look at a PF sense box or something like that. That's not even a solution I thought of was just

05:10.080 --> 05:14.880
breaking out the Wi-Fi into into its own little category. Now I've heard a lot about these UniFi

05:14.880 --> 05:21.840
access points and fairly positive things but does that check the open source part of it? I believe

05:21.840 --> 05:27.920
these are closed source no? So it doesn't look like UniFi is actually open source completely.

05:28.480 --> 05:32.560
There are certain portions that they want to open source but apparently there's some FCC

05:34.480 --> 05:41.040
restrictions around open sourcing software defined radio stuff. Oh that's curious. It's a bit beyond

05:41.040 --> 05:46.480
my pay grade that kind of thing but unfortunately it doesn't look like UniFi is the open source

05:46.480 --> 05:51.280
panacea that you want. I don't know of a good solution that is. I know that you can self-host

05:51.280 --> 05:58.160
the UniFi controller. Okay. These access points are designed to be deployed at scale. They connect

05:58.160 --> 06:04.480
back to a central controller. Now you can buy off the shelf from UniFi something called a cloud key

06:04.480 --> 06:11.360
which hosts this controller software and is stupid simple to set up. You literally just power it on,

06:11.360 --> 06:15.200
look at the IP address on the little OLED screen on the front and off you go. But those things can

06:15.200 --> 06:21.600
be expensive. Easily running into the one to two hundred dollar range which you know if you're

06:21.600 --> 06:27.920
deploying a hotel's worth of Wi-Fi might be worth it but in your apartment it's probably not. So

06:27.920 --> 06:33.920
I've run for the last few years out of a docker container the UniFi controller software and this

06:33.920 --> 06:40.240
might be a good in for you into the container world. One other nice thing about these UniFi

06:40.240 --> 06:48.000
devices is that they're powered through PoE. So installation of them is really really easy. You

06:48.000 --> 06:55.920
just have what's called a PoE injector between the ports on the back of your router and the

06:55.920 --> 07:01.040
access point. So if you want to mount one of these things on the ceiling it's really easy. All you

07:01.040 --> 07:05.920
have to do is run a network cable to that location and then at the other end of that cable is where

07:05.920 --> 07:10.560
you have the plug socket that actually provides the power. That's actually brilliant. It makes it

07:10.560 --> 07:17.120
so simple right? Really simple and when you start scaling these things to having four, five, six,

07:17.120 --> 07:25.120
seven or more on a single site you can actually get PoE switches which are really easy to use.

07:25.120 --> 07:33.120
Which have eight ports, 16, 48 port switches that are all powered so you can run IP cameras over PoE.

07:33.120 --> 07:39.280
You can run the access points and only ever have a single source of actual power plugged into the

07:39.280 --> 07:45.520
wall. So that means you can run your Wi-Fi quite easily on a UPS even. So there's a lot of nice

07:45.520 --> 07:52.800
small things you can do to really upgrade the network just simply by having the Wi-Fi separate

07:52.800 --> 08:00.560
from the router. What a great idea. I never even considered that. As always Alex your insights are

08:00.560 --> 08:05.920
very valuable so thank you. Your wallet can thank me later. So what do you think you're going to go

08:05.920 --> 08:14.240
for? Does that sound like a reasonable solution? And so this seems like an easy answer that you've

08:14.240 --> 08:19.520
been testing for a long time. Is there anything else I should even consider? Probably not.

08:19.520 --> 08:28.560
Okay. Not to toot my own horn but this has worked flawlessly for years and it's transported with me

08:28.560 --> 08:34.320
across one, two, three, soon to be a fourth house and I've not had to reset the Wi-Fi up. In fact

08:34.320 --> 08:40.240
when my mum came to stay with me this summer her phone connected to my Wi-Fi and she was like,

08:40.240 --> 08:44.400
oh wow this is amazing. Last time I was on your Wi-Fi it was in London and now I'm in America.

08:44.400 --> 08:54.000
I'm like yeah. That is so cool. If I'm not mistaken too these are deployed at the studio

08:54.000 --> 08:59.920
as well the JB studio and haven't been thought about for a while. They just kind of work.

08:59.920 --> 09:06.800
They just do the job yeah. Now the other thing to consider is that in my situation I manage my

09:06.800 --> 09:14.400
family's Wi-Fi and when when doing that remotely that can be a challenge but these access points

09:14.400 --> 09:20.640
at my parents houses both connect back to my central unify controller which I run on a droplet

09:21.360 --> 09:26.640
and so I'm able to control their Wi-Fi and fix any Wi-Fi issues they've got remotely

09:26.640 --> 09:33.840
which is really nice. And so can we talk about my router for a moment? It's quite old and I'm just

09:33.840 --> 09:38.480
wondering if that's something I need to worry about. I guess maybe the hardware as a plain old

09:38.480 --> 09:44.080
router might just be fine if it's not you know if it's disjointed from the Wi-Fi and so if I just

09:44.080 --> 09:50.720
update that thing maybe with a new like OpenWRT software that might just be fine. Do you even

09:50.720 --> 09:55.920
need to? You know I suppose that stems from the question of can it do some of the fancier features

09:55.920 --> 10:00.160
like allowing me to connect in with WireGuard and that kind of stuff. You know you could spend

10:00.160 --> 10:06.480
easily 100 bucks on a new router or you could spend 30 on a Raspberry Pi and do it on that

10:06.480 --> 10:13.440
instead and it's still low power. Interesting this might be the first implementation of my very first

10:13.440 --> 10:19.520
single board computer in some infrastructure. Yeah now that Pi could run WireGuard it could run the

10:19.520 --> 10:25.200
unify controller software it could run Home Assistant if you wanted to get into that as well

10:25.200 --> 10:32.720
maybe. You know the Pi 4 is super powerful. So is the Pi good enough for like set and forget though?

10:32.720 --> 10:39.200
Yeah I think so. If you were to get the Pi 3b plus that boots over USB so you just get a USB

10:39.200 --> 10:45.440
hard drive whereas the Pi 4 currently doesn't yet support USB boot but I believe it's coming

10:46.000 --> 10:53.440
air quotes soon. We'll see. So with regards to whether you should replace your current router

10:53.440 --> 11:01.040
or not like what's your what's your upload and download look like? I don't have very large needs

11:01.040 --> 11:08.880
I think I'm getting five no I've got fiber so I'm on the lowest fiber and it's 10 down it's like

11:08.880 --> 11:16.480
five up or something like that and that's plenty fast for what I'm doing you know I'm never needing

11:16.480 --> 11:22.560
to do anything very quickly on a time schedule so I'm uploading lots of photos and stuff like that

11:22.560 --> 11:28.960
to a you know a server that I can serve to clients but it's never on like a I don't need it immediately

11:28.960 --> 11:33.280
kind of basis so that's been working just fine for me. So if your current route is working just

11:33.280 --> 11:40.240
fine I would I would leave that alone and then save save that money and spend it on as good a

11:40.240 --> 11:48.160
wi-fi on your LAN as you can afford and then store your files locally connected to a Pi or maybe a

11:48.160 --> 11:54.240
Pi or maybe a cheap x86 box. I have a few of those. I sent you a link in telegram to my

11:54.240 --> 11:59.760
PFSense build which is a it's a hundred and one hundred and sixty dollars or so I spent on this

11:59.760 --> 12:08.400
thing and it's got an i5 low power version in it i5 3470T it's got an Intel motherboard that's got

12:08.400 --> 12:13.840
dual Intel NICs and I spent a hundred and sixty three dollars on this thing and it it would make

12:13.840 --> 12:21.760
a fine base for a NAS system. So you know I think realistically you're going to look at spending by

12:21.760 --> 12:28.880
the time you've done the wi-fi and have some kind of a local system that can run WireGuard a minimum

12:28.880 --> 12:35.040
of 150 US but you could spend obviously you know the sky's the limit but you you know you could

12:35.040 --> 12:42.160
spend 250 and have an x86 box that's always on low power that kind of thing as well as really great

12:42.160 --> 12:47.120
wi-fi and then start scaling the system up from there really. So I have some things to think about

12:47.120 --> 12:52.720
sounds like. Always it's always a trade-off in terms of how much money do I want to spend how

12:52.720 --> 12:59.120
little do I want to eat this month. I eat quite a bit. I know I know you do. I feel like those are

12:59.120 --> 13:04.320
really great options. I'm gonna have to think a little bit more if I want to tackle this all at

13:04.320 --> 13:10.480
once or or split it up but at least those are two sound forks in the road right. Well that is the

13:10.480 --> 13:15.600
beauty of a modular approach right you don't have to necessarily do all of these things all at once

13:16.400 --> 13:20.240
you know you can just upgrade the wi-fi this month and then in a couple of months time you

13:20.240 --> 13:25.760
can then tackle the WireGuard situation and just keep building slowly but surely and

13:26.320 --> 13:32.640
eventually after time you'll have built a really quite sophisticated system that if any one thing

13:32.640 --> 13:37.120
fails you've only got to replace that one thing and not the whole thing. You know there's something

13:37.120 --> 13:42.480
kind of beautiful about that approach. I always say have backups to backups so it feels like if

13:42.480 --> 13:47.840
one little section breaks it's easy to switch it out so tempting. Thank you for your insights that

13:47.840 --> 14:07.920
sounds amazing. All right you do realize you've jumped the Ask SSHQ by doing this right.
