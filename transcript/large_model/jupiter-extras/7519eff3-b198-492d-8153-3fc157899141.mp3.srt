1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,360
Well, hi, Jill, hello, Brent. I'm so excited.

2
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:22,700
So this is another Brent with Brent and you have been wonderfully excited to be on. And

3
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:28,800
so I should introduce you a little bit more. So I'm joined here today by Jill Bryant Reinecker

4
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:34,880
and Jill, I would love for you to just give us a little taste of what you do.

5
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:42,320
So I am a co-host on Linux Weekly Daily Wednesday with Linux Game Cast on the Linux Game Cast

6
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:49,700
network. And I do game streams with them. And I'm also the community organizer, otherwise

7
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:58,000
known as the morale czar. That's what they named me. And I'm so I do lots of podcasts

8
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,400
and I love joining in with Linux Unplugged and yeah, regular guests there. That's how

9
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:08,720
we got to kind of meet for the first time. Yeah, that was awesome. And the Friday stream,

10
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:16,360
which I do miss. Many of us do. Yeah, for sure. And then I'm also in part of the Big

11
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:23,800
Danny Linux community as well. And just was interviewed by Rocco, too. I should also mention

12
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:31,000
there's Linux Checks LA in there as well. Oh, yes, yes. Very, very important. Yes. I

13
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:37,700
just want to point out that I gave a listen to your Linux spotlight with with Rocco, which

14
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:44,040
came out very recently. And, and it was an amazing conversation. So I would encourage

15
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:48,760
everyone to go give that a listen. It was I was laughing throughout, I was smiling,

16
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:54,760
I learned a lot about you. So I'm going to try not to sort of repeat that because I think

17
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:59,680
it's it was a really great conversation everybody can enjoy. So I'm here, I think with you and

18
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:05,960
I were just going to dive into a whole bunch of other stuff informed by that. So one thing

19
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:14,000
I want to start with actually is how come you have such a bright and wonderful personality

20
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,440
that's so contagious. That's one of the things that just like, was immediately apparent to

21
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:25,460
me. And it seems like you're always smiling. You know, for for those of the podcasts that

22
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:30,180
have a little bit of video and do you get that a lot? Like people are just like attracted

23
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:36,160
to you for that energy. It seems like a really great gift. Yeah. Oh, thank you. Yeah, I get

24
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:44,000
that a lot. And I've just always my glass has always been half full. Yeah, that's such

25
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:50,500
a nice way to look at the world. Right? Yeah. Yeah. Tell me a little bit about podcasting.

26
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:56,380
So I know you've been doing it for a long time now. And so give me a little taste of

27
00:02:56,380 --> 00:03:01,260
how you first got into it and where you think it's going. And I know you wanted to mention

28
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:07,220
Chris in there. Yeah. So Chris Fisher, you're the one who inspired me to get into Linux

29
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:15,620
podcasting. I had been wanting to do this for so long. I've had years of broadcasting

30
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:25,140
experience. In fact, I did produce and DJ my own show for almost 16 years in my 20s.

31
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:31,660
Tell me more about that. That sounds really fascinating. So I did it. It was a what we

32
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:38,700
call synth music or crowd rock music, electronic music show. And because it's it's not the

33
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:43,980
genre music that is typically heard here in the United States, but it's a very part of

34
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:48,220
the European art scene and an experimental scene. And how did you first get connected

35
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:54,700
to that music then? Well, I had been a listener for years on another radio show. And this

36
00:03:54,700 --> 00:04:03,700
is this is, you know, years ago in the 80s. And I started co-hosting on a radio show here

37
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:09,100
in Los Angeles at Loyola Marymount University on a show called Alien Air Music. I love that

38
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:15,940
title. Yeah, that's great. Pat Murphy was the first to play this genre in music. And

39
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:21,260
then I decided to do my own show where I played, you know, different music than he did some

40
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:27,940
of the same overlap, but different. And, you know, there were also no ladies into this

41
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:35,380
genre in music. And that was that would be that was really interesting because a lot

42
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:40,340
of the the musicians and artists who would contact me and send me music to play on my

43
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:47,460
show thought I was a guy. Interesting. Yeah. Because Jill is Gil in, you know, a lot of

44
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:53,020
the European countries and Russian. That's fascinating. Yeah. So they just assumed they

45
00:04:53,020 --> 00:05:00,660
were talking to a guy. Oh, that's hilarious. That's like maybe a strange advantage, actually,

46
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:07,600
like a pen name. So that's really funny. Yeah, it was. In fact, I taught one of the

47
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:13,820
artists from Russia. His name is Edward Artemiev. He's done quite a few soundtracks. And I got

48
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:23,180
to talk to him in on the phone and he was asking, you know, is is is Gil Bryant at the

49
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:29,620
residence? And I think my dad answered the phone and, oh, she's here. And I started talking

50
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:35,900
and he's like, oh, my gosh, this is like a lady. This is a girl. I've been communicating

51
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:45,580
with a girl. It's like Linux and my all my other hobbies and that I'm into. It's it's

52
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:50,660
male dominant. And I'm just used to that. Well, and I want to ask you a little bit more

53
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:57,360
about that, actually, because, you know, women in tech is certainly a totally great thing.

54
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:01,480
And I'm a huge, massive supporter of it. For those who have listened to the episode with

55
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:06,340
Elle, there's a whole bunch on that topic. Oh, yes, there, which was really great. But

56
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:11,980
you know, does that has that felt discouraging at any point? Like it sounds like in the music

57
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:15,740
in this music scene and also in the Linux scene, you're you're surrounded by a bunch

58
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:21,660
of men, which, of course, can be totally fine. But has there been some challenges there,

59
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:26,740
too? There has. But, you know, it was in the beginning, like in the early years of Linux,

60
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:32,740
I'd gone to I'd gone to a lug and didn't feel welcome. Really? And I was just not even

61
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:38,580
I they didn't even acknowledge me. Oh, that's so sad. Yeah. I was going up to introduce

62
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:47,100
myself and say who I who I am. And and I didn't get acknowledged. And that was, yeah, really,

63
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:51,140
you know, that really depressed me. And then I found out it turned out that my brother

64
00:06:51,140 --> 00:07:00,700
had worked with the person who ran that particular lug and said, oh, he's a bad seed. Oh, wow.

65
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:05,260
It sounds like it wasn't about you is more about him. No, it just I guess he's just like

66
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:10,540
that to everyone. But all the people that were part of that community were really nice.

67
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:15,740
I wore one of my first Linux shirts, which was user been girl from ThinkGeek, you know,

68
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:20,380
years ago. And I wore that and I got a lot of comments from the community there. But

69
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:28,700
I just it was really I felt like, you know, it was very standoffish. That's too bad. And

70
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:32,660
my brother said, Yeah, he was really hard to work with. So that was your one of your

71
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:37,140
first experiences with that. But as far as I understand now, for instance, with like

72
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:41,220
Linux checks and things like that, there's there's a whole positive spin to it, right?

73
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:46,100
Yeah. And then after that, you know, I went a couple years without, you know, I was, you

74
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:53,140
know, I've always been a huge Linux user and had been using it. And, but, and, you know,

75
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:59,500
I started using it and literally 93. So, and I wanted to get involved more in the community.

76
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:06,020
And that was, that was really sad. But things changed. Yeah. So this user is group. Did

77
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:11,760
you go that one time and then feel kind of turned off and not go again? I did go again.

78
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:15,540
And I still felt, you know, I figured, well, let me give it another chance. Good for you.

79
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:21,780
Yeah. And I still felt not comfortable. So not your place, then not your kind of people.

80
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:30,140
Yeah. And but then a few years later, I wanted to attend scale, the Southern California Linux

81
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:36,460
Expo and purposely sought out the Linux chicks of Los Angeles, because I know, you know,

82
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:44,500
they were like minded ladies in the field. And I had seen their meetings posted on the

83
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:50,740
internet and the articles about the different conventions and the Linux chicks that were

84
00:08:50,740 --> 00:09:00,340
in the Linux journal, our favorite Linux journal is gone now. But I, I knew I wanted to connect

85
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:08,180
with them. And that was one of my main reasons for going to scale. And that was scale 5x.

86
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:13,660
And the first place I went after I registered is the, the gentlemen, the workers there were

87
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:22,060
nice. Then it was Gareth Greenaway, and Ilan Rabinovich. And Gareth actually directed me

88
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:28,180
straight. He, he, he took me straight to the Linux chicks LA booth. And I would have gone

89
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:33,320
to scale the previous couple of years. But I was a little nervous. I thought, well, maybe

90
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:38,400
I just I'm not as good enough in Linux, you know, did you feel like you might have had

91
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:42,980
that same initial experience then? Yes. And there was a little bit of that too. I was

92
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:49,140
a little a little nervous about that. But it was exact opposite. I went to the booth

93
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:54,980
and they had they had a questionnaire on what apps you use on Linux. And I named, named

94
00:09:54,980 --> 00:10:06,340
all my favorites, of course, the GIMP and, and Inkscape then and Blender, and Xterm,

95
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:07,340
you know, everything.

96
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:10,140
So it sounds like you're well versed for sure.

97
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:17,460
Yeah, I wrote down like little like 50 apps I use. And then then my favorite window managers,

98
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:18,580
you know,

99
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:20,340
you put an S on that, which I love

100
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:27,780
window maker, you know, flexbox, openbox, TWM, the whole nine yards. And they were just

101
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:33,780
kind of blown away. They're like, Oh, my gosh, you you you know, all the stuff you've been

102
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:36,780
using Linux for so many years.

103
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:42,540
Well, that's what I love is is like, there's many of us who are just kind of like, before

104
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:45,860
we get introduced to the community, the greater community, there's a lot of us doing some

105
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:50,820
cool stuff kind of just in the shadows a little bit, right. And I think for you and I now

106
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:55,440
it's our job to kind of invite them out and say, Hey, come on out here. Like, it's pretty

107
00:10:55,440 --> 00:11:00,380
friendly out here. So but please continue the Linux chicks story. That's great.

108
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:05,580
Yeah. So what was what was so amazing, it was one of the best days honestly, of my life

109
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:12,300
going to that first dance scale. Wow, that is huge. And then then going to Linux chicks

110
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:17,580
booth and within literally 20 minutes, they're like, they're like, they just give me gave

111
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:24,200
me hugs. And it was exact opposite of what I experienced before in the whole scale community,

112
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:30,780
you know, it was just a big if you're a Linux user, you got a hug. And they're inviting

113
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:34,620
me and I'm like, Oh, come come behind the booth, Jill. And then I started helping them

114
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:40,500
with their booth. And we were best friends forever. From that point. Wow, that sounds

115
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:45,820
like a really powerful experience for you. It was and that was, you know, early 2000s.

116
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:53,440
So and so you were a big Linux fan before going there. But I imagine having this experience,

117
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:58,020
you were just a fan for life after that, all of a sudden, I was part of the community.

118
00:11:58,020 --> 00:12:02,540
And that just, that's, that's what did it was my, my scale family and my Linux chicks

119
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:08,100
delay family. That's awesome. And that family continues up to today. Like you're still quite

120
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:14,620
a bit involved. Tell us a little bit about that. Oh, yes. So. So it didn't take just

121
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:19,180
literally that day. And they made me you know, they're Sharon's like, she was the president

122
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:23,620
at the time. And within a few days, she's like, Jill, you're now a co organizer of the

123
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:33,720
Linux chicks. Wow, that's awesome. So there's three of us that are co organizers. So it's

124
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:41,600
an amazing organization, you know, basically to, to, you know, help get not only ladies

125
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:50,980
in into Linux, and diversity in Linux, but men also, you know, we were not gender exclusive.

126
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:57,040
So we have just as many men in our group as woman, which is great. I, I really applaud

127
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:05,740
that sentiment of trying to be inclusive to everyone. And not necessarily leaving anybody

128
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:10,420
out, right? I think that's super important, even if you come at it from from sort of a

129
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:14,580
different angle. So yeah, kudos to you guys. That's really important work. I think that's

130
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:20,020
great. In fact, at our meetups, we do hands on workshops teaching how to install Linux

131
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:26,140
on raspberry pies and on computers. And we encourage, you know, new users, you know,

132
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:32,180
of anyone to come. And usually we have more men than than than woman. But that's kind

133
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:39,400
of normal. So there's just more, more, you know, men getting into it than women. So

134
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:45,820
and how do you think, for yourself, how do you like, what, what led you to being just

135
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:50,060
hooked on computers? Because I know, from what I've learned recently, that you have

136
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:55,100
a number of them behind you and all of that stuff. But I know you had a brother who was

137
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:59,500
interested in it. And what was this an older brother? Yes, yes. He's four years older.

138
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:04,620
His name is Jack. So it's Jack and Jill. Yes. Oh, interesting. I have an older brother named

139
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:09,580
Chris, who's four years older, who got me into computers. So it's really similar, actually.

140
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:15,740
Oh, that's awesome. Brett, we have something in common. We have tons in common. Yeah. Oh,

141
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:21,340
yes. Yes, we have everything so much in tech. And so I imagine Jack had a huge influence

142
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:28,500
on you. Yes, definitely. He was one of the the first people to get into it in the 80s,

143
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:32,740
you know, and that was before most people even had computers at home. So and we had

144
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:39,820
just about everything at home. And he had an ad elite BBS. It was truly lead. In fact,

145
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:45,660
he ended up getting jobs working directly with Bill Gates and Steve Jobs because of

146
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:53,420
that BBS. Yeah. Wow. That that sounds amazing. And and your grandparents, too, had some kind

147
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:59,860
of connection there as well, right? Yes. Apollo. Yeah, they were because here I live in the

148
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:05,060
middle. That's that's why I grew up here is because of aerospace. You know, we have JPL

149
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:12,860
and SpaceX and and Northrop Grumman and which was TRW and International Rectifier and all

150
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:18,860
the big this is the think tank area where where a lot of the products are made that

151
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:25,300
go into space. That sounds so fascinating. I want to know so much more. My grandparents

152
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:31,540
were both top top secret with Apollo. So I just I grew up with that and my grandfather

153
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:36,540
worked. Grandmother both worked, built tubes for the very first computers. So it's just

154
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:40,860
been part of my family. Right. So how could you not be influenced by that? Yeah, it sounds

155
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:45,900
like there's a real there's a real trade of that being handed down throughout your family.

156
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:51,100
So that's a kind of an amazing history, actually. Yeah, I'm very, very proud of it. My give

157
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:57,060
you a little bit. My grandmother was the one who built the engine that brought Apollo 13

158
00:15:57,060 --> 00:16:03,940
home. Oh, man. That was her engine. It wasn't intended. It was intended for the the the

159
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:09,100
lamb not to bring them home, but it had enough power and was built so well that it could

160
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:15,380
bring them back to Earth. That's unbelievable. She got a medal from the president and everything

161
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:24,180
for that. So that's so cool. Wow. Yeah. I just got a pause for a moment. There's there's

162
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:27,780
it sounds to me. So you started at a very young age being interested in computers then

163
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:33,900
and and so that has brought you all the way to today where you that hasn't given up in

164
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:39,420
any way. It seems like right. You're still you seem like a tinkerer at heart and just

165
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:44,580
a voracious learner for sure. Yeah. And you know, my brother always says, Well, it wasn't

166
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:49,660
just that we had it had it around in the house and you had access. You wanted to do it. You

167
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:55,220
had the drive to learn how to build computers. You know, I took our Apple two apart, which

168
00:16:55,220 --> 00:17:00,680
much to my parents chagrin as long as you put it back together. I put it back together

169
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:07,820
and got it working. And then the first computer I really built was my 286. So and I did animation

170
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:16,100
on it and led to my becoming an animator later in life. So I want to dive into that a little

171
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:23,220
bit because I think as you know, I'm a photographer and I do all my stuff on Linux. And cheese

172
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:30,860
does some design work, some of it on Linux. And so I want to jump in a little bit about

173
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:35,700
sort of how you feel about the creative community using Linux because as far as I understand

174
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:40,860
this, that's a relatively new thing. Of course, you're maybe a bit of an exception to that.

175
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:46,180
But give me a give me a little bit of your perspective on that. Well, you know, originally

176
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:51,100
in the eighties, you know, I was using a PC at home to do animation because I couldn't

177
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:57,580
afford the, you know, fifty thousand dollar Unix. Of course. Yeah, right. You know, and

178
00:17:57,580 --> 00:18:04,380
the, you know, software that they were using for animation at the time. So the industry

179
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:10,480
honestly is particularly with film, not so much broadcast TV, which is still predominantly,

180
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:16,260
you know, Mac and Windows, but still Linux on the back end for rendering. But the film

181
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:26,340
industry really they just moved to directly from Unix to Linux. And one of the the pieces

182
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:31,440
of software that brought about that change was Maya. Originally, it was alias Wavefront

183
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:39,740
for Unix, and then it moved over to Linux. And as soon as that started happening, all

184
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:45,980
the software's proprietary proprietary and open source started moving to Linux, not just

185
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:50,900
for rendering, but for creative content. Do you have any idea what was the original impetus

186
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:57,060
for them to make that switch price cost? Because in the film, see in TV, they actually have

187
00:18:57,060 --> 00:19:03,620
more money to spend on their productions in film. You know, they have like a two year

188
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:09,140
span and they can only spend a certain amount. And that's what it was. It was it was the

189
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:15,060
ability to have not just free software, but maybe even more important to that to be able

190
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:21,060
to develop the software that they wanted, you know, with an open operating system. So

191
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:26,900
they can add like, for instance, Pixar and Disney, they have software they developed

192
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:33,660
under Linux just for doing like underwater scenes and finding Dory and finding Nemo.

193
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:41,120
And all that development was done on Linux. They use, you know, they use Maya and Blender

194
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:47,420
and a lot of different software packages together as well as proprietary. But Disney is in the

195
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:52,720
process. They've been open sourcing a lot of their animation software. And what was

196
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:58,820
really cool is recently, actually, two years ago at Seagraph, the big international computer

197
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:06,060
animation convention, someone in the audience had asked one of the developers of the software

198
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:10,900
they were using for finding Nemo if it was going to come to Windows. And they said, we

199
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:19,340
don't need to bother. We're using Linux. And I was just like, yeah, that's so awesome.

200
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:25,540
And they even had system 76 laptops on stage. It was awesome. That makes me smile because

201
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:29,860
that's exactly how I feel about it. Right. It's like, why would we translate the software

202
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:34,900
to Windows when that feels like a downgrade? Right. Yeah. And and that Linux is available

203
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:35,900
to everyone.

204
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:40,900
And then another thing is with recently, it's just over a year old. The Academy Software

205
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:47,740
Foundation has been incredible because it's it's helping all these companies and businesses

206
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:53,580
who want to start using open source software, not with just usability, but the licenses

207
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:57,900
and everything they need. And it's specifically made for Hollywood. And, you know, Blender

208
00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:01,720
was the forefront of that movement back in the early two thousands. I've been using it

209
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:07,660
since then. And so do you have any personal experience with that foundation then? No,

210
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:12,400
but I am thinking of becoming a little bit more involved. And I did get to talk to the

211
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:20,940
executive producer at the Open Source Summit recently in San Diego. There was a long, long

212
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:27,340
line of people to talk to him after he did a talk talking about, you know, doing an introduction

213
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:31,740
about the Academy Software Foundation and and what it's doing in the industry. It was

214
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:36,660
a, you know, a learning tutorial for new people who didn't know. And so most of the people

215
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:43,380
that were in line were young students who want to get in the animation industry. So

216
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:47,780
I came up to him. I was at one of the I was the last person to talk to him and I said,

217
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:53,820
oh, no, I'm a podcaster and I've been talking about the Academy Software Foundation since

218
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:59,180
the beginning. I do, you know, Linux pod news podcast. And I said, I've been working in

219
00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:05,620
the industry for years. The companies I work for, we've had, you know, multiple awards,

220
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:12,940
everything from from Webby's and Telly's to Emmy's. And I've been in it for many years.

221
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:16,900
And he was just like, oh, Jill, I want to talk to you. He was really he was so excited

222
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:22,700
to talk to someone that was in the field, you know, at the Linux convention instead

223
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:27,820
of just students. And so did you guys go for coffee or something or did you keep chatting?

224
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:33,180
No, he had to he had to take a plane home. Time constraints. That's always the challenge.

225
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:38,900
Yeah. But he talked with me a good half hour. We had had a nice chat. That must have been

226
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:44,060
great. Yeah. So that was really nice. And I got to tell him, you know, my experience

227
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:50,580
and and how it's it's changed. It's, you know, not just Linux on the back end anymore. It's

228
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:56,740
it's in the development and creative now. So on the front end, yeah, on the front end,

229
00:22:56,740 --> 00:23:03,140
which is so nice to hear, like, from my perspective, with photography, you know, we're using similar

230
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:09,820
tools but a little bit different. And so I've watched even in the last Oh, gosh, I guess

231
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:14,180
it's almost eight, nine, 10 years, something like that. I've watched the software grow

232
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:19,260
quite a bit and enable many of us to do it full time with the tools that are available

233
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:24,340
in open source, as opposed to the commercial stuff. And so it sounds like the transition

234
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:31,380
that animation and film made many years ago, seems to be just happening now.

235
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:35,620
It's so true, you know, now the graphics are arts just in photography, it's really starting

236
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:41,500
to, to come of age now. So that's, yeah, I've been really awesome.

237
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:47,780
Of course, I'm biased, but that's very exciting. And I hope it can reach as wide an audience

238
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:51,180
as it as it has in in your world, really.

239
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:55,720
Yeah, I think I definitely know it will. I mean, you've got, you know, programs like

240
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:59,620
dark table that are really, you know, taken off and then you have, you know, critter and

241
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:05,980
GIMP and photopea and all the open source software that you can use now in Inkscape

242
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:10,820
under Linux, that's really, you know, taking over. And now we also have the proprietary

243
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:16,300
have DaVinci resolve, which has taken over the Adobe suite in the industry, because it's,

244
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:20,580
you know, it's its premiere and after effects all in one.

245
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:24,220
You mentioned something that I want to go back to a slight for a slight moment. You

246
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:28,460
mentioned during your experience in film, you worked with a whole bunch of businesses

247
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:33,020
that that got a whole bunch of awards. Can you tell me a little bit more about that time

248
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:34,020
in your life?

249
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:41,580
Yeah, no problem. So it was after I graduated. I was the very first computer animation graduate

250
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:46,420
from the Cal State system. I was what was called a special major, I created my own,

251
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:51,100
I combined communications, fine arts and computer science.

252
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:53,700
Oh, cool. That's such a great combination.

253
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:58,460
Yeah. And, you know, it took a year to get it approved, but they were all so impressed.

254
00:24:58,460 --> 00:25:02,980
Like this is the future. This is, you know, back then we called it the information super

255
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:07,300
highway, you know, the future of the creativity.

256
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:15,020
So that was in fact, I had to do a talk in front of the director of the Cal State system.

257
00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:20,780
And that was the big term was the information super highway was going to bring creativity

258
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:24,860
to a new level.

259
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:25,860
And has it?

260
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:30,780
Yes. Oh, yes. We don't call it the information super highway anymore.

261
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:31,780
Right. Things have changed.

262
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:39,620
Things have changed. But yeah, so I had created my own major. So what had happened is after

263
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:43,900
I graduated, you know, I was real a nervous student, you know, wanted to get into the

264
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:50,220
field, but I'd already had worked most of my life doing animation all back, you know,

265
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:56,300
through the apple too, when I was a little kid and work really, really hard.

266
00:25:56,300 --> 00:26:03,460
And then I got connected with a freelance animator and who had a studio and did quite

267
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:10,500
a bit of work for him starting in the, in the mid nineties and on. And we, he had contracts

268
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:17,740
actually, you know, cause we worked together for a long, quite a few years and we had contracts

269
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:29,540
with, with Fox and Warner Brothers, Disney, ESPN, Electronic Arts.

270
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:37,620
And yeah, so one of the first pieces I worked on, my very first animation was of all things

271
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:44,740
a commercial for the Russian hockey team that was going to be viewed on ESPN. So whenever

272
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:48,700
they traveled and they were, you know, one of the top teams at the time. So wherever

273
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:55,620
they traveled, the commercial ran and I saw it for like five years after I had done it.

274
00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:58,220
That's funny.

275
00:26:58,220 --> 00:27:00,060
That got nominated for an Emmy.

276
00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:02,820
Wow. That must feel pretty good.

277
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:12,140
Oh God. My very first piece I had ever done for the industry gets nominated for an Emmy.

278
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:17,140
And Kevin, my other animator, we worked together. He's like, Jill, he goes, your career is set.

279
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:25,660
You have Emmy on your resume. It's like Emmy, just even being nominated. Cause at the time

280
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:32,140
it was the, it was 1998 and that was the first year that a commercial that was all computer

281
00:27:32,140 --> 00:27:42,100
graphics was, was one of the topics for nomination. So the first CG commercial. And so that was

282
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:48,020
a big deal. And there were, you know, like over 500 submissions and uh, yeah, that was

283
00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:49,020
a big deal.

284
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:52,060
Does that feel a bit surreal at this point? Like revisiting that?

285
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:56,500
Yes. Yeah. I watch it and I said, Oh gosh, it looks so amateur. But at the time it was

286
00:27:56,500 --> 00:28:06,380
high tech, you know? And that actually the other significant thing about that piece is

287
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:14,420
one of the reasons that the studios give freelancers their work is, um, is that they don't have

288
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:19,380
time to do it in house. And so you have a major deadline, you know, we're staying up

289
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:25,620
for four days without sleep to get, get, get it rendered and which can take time. So after

290
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:31,300
you create it, then you have to have time to render it. Well, we didn't have enough

291
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:37,100
power to, to make that final render, to get it to them in two days. So I actually stayed

292
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:42,740
up all night that first night as you know, I created the, my animation I need to and

293
00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:48,420
my model modeling and I stayed up all that night and built another computer, which was

294
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:57,180
a 46 at the time to, so I could render. So I'd have three computers I could render with

295
00:28:57,180 --> 00:29:02,180
that home. And then that started my render farm, which later grew into a Pentium, you

296
00:29:02,180 --> 00:29:07,980
know, dual processor, Penny and pro to, to, uh, quad processors, eons and deck alphas

297
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:14,300
and, and, and the whole nine yards. But yeah, I, and what was really neat is he told the

298
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:19,300
company he goes, he goes, my animator built an extra computer just so that we can get

299
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:26,100
this job done. Wow. That's dedication, isn't it? Yeah. There's something about having a

300
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:32,700
need that just drives you. Yeah. So, yeah. So I did that piece and then, you know, we,

301
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:39,100
there got like 20 tellies and Webby's and then, um, and Emmy in the future, but that

302
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:46,100
was kind of what launched that. And I could, I could tell you one other project I'm really

303
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:53,860
proud, proud of. Sure. Please do put it out into the world. It sounds great. Oh my God,

304
00:29:53,860 --> 00:30:01,020
I'm telling the world. You don't have to know, but this is, I, I, I'm it's, it's time. Cause

305
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:08,780
this was very special. Um, yeah. So we actually ended up doing the editing on the trailer

306
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:14,780
for the perfect storm, right? Which, which many of us probably have seen. Yes. And most

307
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:21,500
people have seen it. So a lot of people have seen my work, but the really cool thing is

308
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:27,060
we worked really hard, not just on the editing, but we created our own effects for that final

309
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:32,220
wave scene. Cause we didn't, we didn't like what the studio gave us and we didn't think

310
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:40,340
it looked kind of real enough. So then at the time the studios, um, water is what we

311
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:47,180
call caustics has always been hard to render. And we didn't know, there was no one piece

312
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:52,820
of software that did water really, really well. Um, it would do the mass like an ocean

313
00:30:52,820 --> 00:31:00,060
mass or mask, a mass or a lake, but it was not good at doing splashes and waves where

314
00:31:00,060 --> 00:31:04,900
there's a lot of different details and reflections and all that movement. Yeah, exactly. And

315
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:08,860
studios were able to do a lot of that, but they achieved that with, you know, really

316
00:31:08,860 --> 00:31:12,900
like hundreds of people, you know, trying to get this right. And it was just me and

317
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:20,780
one other animator. So, um, not as many resources, not as many resources and darn it. And one

318
00:31:20,780 --> 00:31:24,560
reason I wanted to bring this project up is because darn it, I wish we had open source

319
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:30,700
software then. So this is, you know, 2000 and we just didn't have that. So we had to

320
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:39,860
combine, I combined, um, uh, some effects from 3d studio, um, release R4 for dos. This

321
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:45,780
is before, you know, I did that on windows and a light wave. Um, we had some Maya in

322
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:52,740
there and, um, I had to write a script that would go from one program to another to get

323
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:57,020
the effects that we needed because one program would have the part of the effect and the

324
00:31:57,020 --> 00:32:04,260
other program would have the other. So, so to make this, the splash look real, you know,

325
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:07,900
we had to use several different programs of different particle systems from different

326
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:15,020
programs. And then I would script it and we added chaos to it. And, um, that ended up

327
00:32:15,020 --> 00:32:22,580
on the final splash of the wave. And the big deal there was that the studio was so blown

328
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:29,820
away with what we had done that that's what was part of the original film. Oh, wow. That's

329
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:34,980
cool. Yeah. So it became, uh, so that was one of the first films that we had worked

330
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:40,640
on. That's unbelievable. Instead of just a commercial, for instance. Yeah, exactly. Wow.

331
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:45,460
You must feel super proud about putting that work in and then having it be recognized.

332
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:51,940
Yeah. And it was just, it was a lot of, it was so much just thinking about it. I remember,

333
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:57,060
you know, going to Kevin's house and we were just, you know, pounding our heads like, how

334
00:32:57,060 --> 00:33:00,820
are we going to achieve this? You know, it was just cause we didn't, you know, the tools

335
00:33:00,820 --> 00:33:05,420
weren't available and we didn't have access to those at home, you know, at our own, in

336
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:12,860
our own studios like Warner Brothers did and Pixar, you know, so, but then we were able

337
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:18,140
to do something that they were having a hard time achieving. So that was a proud. So two

338
00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:24,560
people beat a hundred people. Yeah. That's so cool. Good for you. And thank you for sharing

339
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:29,140
that story. That's amazing. That's a really amazing. Yeah. Oh my gosh. I'm sharing it

340
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:35,840
on the internet. Cool. No, it's out there. It's so funny cause that's what's unique also

341
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:40,940
about podcasting. I've been behind the scenes most of my life, you know, except for, you

342
00:33:40,940 --> 00:33:46,500
know, doing my, my teaching and teaching computer animation and motion graphics with my students.

343
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:51,920
And they've seen, you know, we, you know, instructors show the students our work after

344
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:55,780
they've been taking the class a while so they can see what you can do and it helps them

345
00:33:55,780 --> 00:34:01,060
get them inspired. But I've never put this out really on the, on the internet too much

346
00:34:01,060 --> 00:34:08,260
except talking with Ven and Pedro on LWW and the pre-show and after show with our, our,

347
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:15,580
our patrons and chat. So I've shared some with them, but not in an interview or chat.

348
00:34:15,580 --> 00:34:20,020
Well, thank you for sharing it. I feel like a lot of people would love to, are going to

349
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:25,740
love that story. So that sounds amazing. How do you think that open source would have changed

350
00:34:25,740 --> 00:34:30,860
that story a little bit? Oh boy. Well, I would have had, I could have had tools more like

351
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:37,220
blender at that time. You know, we could have hired a software developer to, you know, help

352
00:34:37,220 --> 00:34:41,420
us do these special particle systems, you know? So you feel like it would have made

353
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:44,860
it easier than trying to daisy chain and pull like little pieces from all these different

354
00:34:44,860 --> 00:34:49,500
tools and have them create the effect that you needed, right? And now, you know, a lot

355
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:54,500
of the freelancers that are left do have a lot of developers cause in the animation industry,

356
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:59,900
half of it is, you know, we need coders and developers to create, create the software

357
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:05,800
needed. Well, I love the juxtaposition between technical creativity, which would be the developers

358
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:11,740
who are trying to achieve a vision and the actual, like the visual creativity as well.

359
00:35:11,740 --> 00:35:19,580
And how those two now these days, um, are, are such a cool place that, that technical

360
00:35:19,580 --> 00:35:23,440
people who traditionally haven't been seen as creative can really show their creativity

361
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:29,380
in many ways. Yes, definitely. And yeah, as you know, it's just as much technical as it

362
00:35:29,380 --> 00:35:35,940
is, um, creative and artistic. And especially in the freelance world where you kind of,

363
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:41,860
you've got to know everything. You gotta be a Jack of all trades or a Jill of all trades.

364
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:47,860
Yeah. And I encourage that in my students because a lot of times, you know, they want

365
00:35:47,860 --> 00:35:55,760
to be character animators or do textures or do sound or do lighting. And I try and give

366
00:35:55,760 --> 00:36:00,320
them as broad experience. I, you know, want them to create their own movies with all these

367
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:06,740
elements together so they get to learn a little bit of everything so they can see what emphasis

368
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:12,260
they would like to, what area they'd like to focus on, but also set so that they're

369
00:36:12,260 --> 00:36:18,460
well rounded for the industry. Cause I want my students, you know, I want them to not

370
00:36:18,460 --> 00:36:23,100
just learn character animation. Um, a lot of the other schools, that's what they, they

371
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:28,660
just churn out students learning, you know, character or materials, but they don't focus

372
00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:36,120
on the whole person and the whole, you know, area of knowledge. And I even, um, not only

373
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:41,860
of course teach them Linux, but also, um, I always do a session on how to build a computer

374
00:36:41,860 --> 00:36:46,740
because that has helped me. And it's good for them to, to know how it all works.

375
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:50,140
And do you feel like the students are responsive to that these days?

376
00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:54,540
Oh yes. They're coming to me knowing that this is the field they want to get into. Most

377
00:36:54,540 --> 00:36:58,500
like half my students want to get into the field. So they're willing to learn and they

378
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:04,260
understand that they need to need to know a lot of this for, to be relevant in the,

379
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:10,480
in the industry. And, uh, so they not only coming in with that art background with,

380
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:16,820
with life drawing and years of drawing and painting and sculpting and color theory and,

381
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:24,060
um, uh, computer graphics with, with, um, Photoshop or GIMP or Inkscape and you know,

382
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:28,620
all those skills, but they also need to know the technical, very important.

383
00:37:28,620 --> 00:37:34,740
Well, and I totally associate with your giving them like a rounded view of the industry and

384
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:40,660
then allowing them to jump into a niche. Um, because I feel like, um, the same is true

385
00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:44,780
with podcasting, right? Is that if you, if you, if you know all of the pieces that go

386
00:37:44,780 --> 00:37:51,220
into sort of the whole pipeline, um, then you have this perspective, uh, that even if

387
00:37:51,220 --> 00:37:55,500
you're only working on a little piece of it, um, you have this perspective that makes your,

388
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:59,580
your work sort of fit in, in a different way or, or allows you to solve different puzzles,

389
00:37:59,580 --> 00:38:01,220
right? With that creativity,

390
00:38:01,220 --> 00:38:06,940
Exactly. Solve different problems. You realize, okay, well I'm doing, I'm working like if

391
00:38:06,940 --> 00:38:11,540
they're doing materials, I'm working on this material. Well, how can I help help the people

392
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:14,240
that are animating these materials?

393
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:19,000
Also thinking of the impact later on in the process. Oh, that's really fascinating.

394
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:24,220
That's always been a goal is to make sure they're really well rounded and, um, you know,

395
00:38:24,220 --> 00:38:28,180
that, that also that they have learned to have a really good work ethic cause the hours

396
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:35,580
are grueling. So can be grueling in anything you love it. It is. Yeah, for sure. Yeah.

397
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:39,940
And anything you love, you know, whatever you're doing.

398
00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:43,260
The cool thing I've noticed is when you're working on something so passionately, you

399
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:48,540
kind of forget about time and you forget about, um, you know, that staying up all night is

400
00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:50,100
kind of crazy, right?

401
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:56,340
Yes. It's happening to me right now with podcasting. Oh really? In what way? Well, just doing all

402
00:38:56,340 --> 00:39:01,620
the research for it. I try and get to bed at a halfway decent time, but ended up staying

403
00:39:01,620 --> 00:39:08,460
up sometimes till two and three in the morning, reading Linux news stories for my show and

404
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:12,380
listening to all the podcasts cause I love all the Linux podcasts and I listened to them

405
00:39:12,380 --> 00:39:13,840
all.

406
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:17,080
Pretty soon you're going to have, there's going to be too much content for you to possibly

407
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:18,660
take in, right?

408
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:23,260
Yeah. And it's already kind of coming to that cause there's, there's new shows coming out

409
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:28,900
and I'm just like, I can't keep it up, but I try to.

410
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:35,620
You can just play it while you're sleeping. I've heard it gets in your brain anyways.

411
00:39:35,620 --> 00:39:41,060
And I just love it. I'm just living it. In fact, I'm not doing much watch, watching other

412
00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:46,520
content than YouTubers and Twitch streamers and, and podcasts. It's been pretty much my

413
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:51,840
life cause I've just loved it and just going, you know, putting myself all into it and I

414
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:54,780
love it. I love all the communities.

415
00:39:54,780 --> 00:39:59,780
Does that feel like a big treat for you now? How when you were first starting, maybe it,

416
00:39:59,780 --> 00:40:07,460
the community or Linux wasn't spoken as publicly and that now it's sort of everywhere.

417
00:40:07,460 --> 00:40:16,540
Yes, we have a bloomed, the flower has spread forth. Yeah, it's about time. And this is

418
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:22,220
what we've needed. For me, it's a continuation of the community we have at scale and the

419
00:40:22,220 --> 00:40:27,220
Linux conventions and the lugs. You know, this is a continuation of that. The podcasting

420
00:40:27,220 --> 00:40:32,180
is, you know, online lugs like Linux Unplugged, one of my favorite shows.

421
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:38,660
Well, thanks. Yeah. The Linux Unplugged, I think as I've mentioned before, is the reason

422
00:40:38,660 --> 00:40:42,860
I'm even here. And it sounds like that was a huge impact for you as well.

423
00:40:42,860 --> 00:40:47,700
I started watching Jupiter Broadcasting in the beginning since it was the computer action

424
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:53,640
show and not the Linux before it was the Linux action show. And I was listening to Jupiter

425
00:40:53,640 --> 00:41:01,380
at night and stoked and I'd always wanted to become involved in the Jupiter Broadcasting

426
00:41:01,380 --> 00:41:06,180
community. But at the time I was really busy with my, you know, my animation career and

427
00:41:06,180 --> 00:41:08,700
had, I already had so many hobbies.

428
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:12,340
I've heard you have a few.

429
00:41:12,340 --> 00:41:20,620
I've been collecting vintage computers. I have several hundred. So when I started podcasting

430
00:41:20,620 --> 00:41:25,720
with Linux Gamecast and I knew that was the community I wanted to start with because that's

431
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:32,580
the one I became friends with everyone and because it had a graphics end to it. It was

432
00:41:32,580 --> 00:41:39,940
Linux Gamecast. It was gaming on Linux. And I had done some work in the field. I'd worked,

433
00:41:39,940 --> 00:41:45,700
as I mentioned earlier, a little bit for, actually a lot for Electronic Arts, doing

434
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:52,700
game development and 3D models and artwork. So in Linux Gamecast, Linux gaming was my

435
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:59,280
passion and this is, you know, the days before Steam, before we had Proton and all that.

436
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:04,100
You know, after I started with Linux Gamecast, I've been full time with them now a year

437
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:10,540
and a half and I knew it was time to start giving back to the Jupyter broadcasting community

438
00:42:10,540 --> 00:42:16,420
because of all the wonderful Linux content that Chris has worked so hard and all of you

439
00:42:16,420 --> 00:42:28,180
work so hard and who he has given us so much in the Linux community and over the years

440
00:42:28,180 --> 00:42:34,840
and I just wanted to give back and that's one of the reasons I wanted to get involved

441
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:41,280
in Jupyter broadcasting. So I wanted to help give back to the community that Chris worked

442
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:46,860
so hard to create and just it's my thank you to him.

443
00:42:46,860 --> 00:42:52,580
Wow. Well, I'm sure he'll listen to this and I'm sure that means a heck of a lot to him

444
00:42:52,580 --> 00:42:58,500
for sure and it does to me as well as purely a member of the Jupyter broadcasting community.

445
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:05,100
I feel like, you know, if we all have gained so much from it and continue to gain so much

446
00:43:05,100 --> 00:43:11,380
from it and it's that giving back somehow, whether it's just coming to say hi at a conference

447
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:16,820
or something like that, all of those little gestures make a huge difference, right? And

448
00:43:16,820 --> 00:43:22,740
of course you've showed up quite a bit in the mumble room when we're doing Linux Unplugged

449
00:43:22,740 --> 00:43:30,480
on a weekly basis live, which anybody can join and it's been so nice to have someone

450
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:36,060
like you there because it just adds to the diversity of all the people that are included

451
00:43:36,060 --> 00:43:41,940
in that group, right? And I know you and I sometimes after the show we just end up just

452
00:43:41,940 --> 00:43:45,620
chatting for no reason and just having a really good time.

453
00:43:45,620 --> 00:43:52,420
Oh, I love all you guys, you Brent and Cheese Bacon and Wes and Joe, you all, you know,

454
00:43:52,420 --> 00:43:57,220
everyone in the Jupyter broadcasting community and Elle, I love Elle. I was so happy to

455
00:43:57,220 --> 00:44:03,980
see another, see another lady in Linux podcasting after I started, you know, I'm like, oh, good,

456
00:44:03,980 --> 00:44:05,780
Chris has Elle now. Yay.

457
00:44:05,780 --> 00:44:10,340
Yeah, for sure. And Angela, I think she's been behind the scenes, which is kind of a

458
00:44:10,340 --> 00:44:13,140
thing you mentioned, right? Like there's a lot of people behind the scenes that don't

459
00:44:13,140 --> 00:44:14,140
always get seen.

460
00:44:14,140 --> 00:44:20,100
Yeah. And I loved her, her a woman in tech, a podcast she was doing and the Faux show

461
00:44:20,100 --> 00:44:25,980
and Angela has been amazing driving force in a Jupyter broadcasting. So I've always

462
00:44:25,980 --> 00:44:28,960
looked up to her too, a lot.

463
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:35,480
That's great. And, um, you mentioned some of the earlier shows, it sounds like, um,

464
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:38,860
you know more about the history of Jupyter broadcasting than I do in many ways. Cause

465
00:44:38,860 --> 00:44:40,820
I came to it a little bit later.

466
00:44:40,820 --> 00:44:47,460
I was just a ravenous listener, you know, I was so quiet other than, you know, I donated

467
00:44:47,460 --> 00:44:51,660
and you know, I've been a patron of Jupyter broadcasting since the very beginning, but

468
00:44:51,660 --> 00:44:55,300
I've been, you know, I was buying the t-shirts and I have the challenge coin and

469
00:44:55,300 --> 00:45:01,340
Wow. You're outdoing a lot of us, I think.

470
00:45:01,340 --> 00:45:07,340
Yeah. And so I wanted to give back and also because of Ed Stone, the producer of Linux

471
00:45:07,340 --> 00:45:10,900
game cast got his start because of Jupyter broadcasting.

472
00:45:10,900 --> 00:45:18,420
Oh, cool. I'm learning all of these things is really cool. Yeah. I like the idea that,

473
00:45:18,420 --> 00:45:22,700
you know, there are a lot of communities now and you're part of a lot of them and that

474
00:45:22,700 --> 00:45:26,780
we all have our, you know, concentrated time. It's like, okay, Tuesdays at, at whatever

475
00:45:26,780 --> 00:45:30,000
time it is in your local time, there's Linux unplugged and then you can bounce to another

476
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:34,500
one somewhere else that has a bit of a different crew and some overlapping, um, community members

477
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:41,140
to and go be a part of that community as well. Right. I just love that. I think you're totally

478
00:45:41,140 --> 00:45:47,900
going to agree with me. Um, in that it's really special how it's okay to be a part of all

479
00:45:47,900 --> 00:45:51,340
of them and that there are all these connections that have been between all of them, like a

480
00:45:51,340 --> 00:45:57,140
web of, of really neat interconnections, right. And that, that we all grow because of it.

481
00:45:57,140 --> 00:46:01,900
Yeah. We all grown, we all, all learn, you know, in different points of view. Like for

482
00:46:01,900 --> 00:46:09,180
instance, I'm doing, you know, LWDW is a Linux news show. Well, of course, Jupiter broadcasting

483
00:46:09,180 --> 00:46:16,340
has lots of Linux news shows, including, uh, Linux unplugged and Linux action news and

484
00:46:16,340 --> 00:46:21,180
all the other shows, but we all cover different things. We have our uniquenesses and, and

485
00:46:21,180 --> 00:46:29,460
the way as in, uh, not in just, uh, the stories, but, and how we, we, uh, produce them and

486
00:46:29,460 --> 00:46:35,420
how we talk about them. So, you know, we all, all learn from each other. We all share, you

487
00:46:35,420 --> 00:46:40,620
know, knowledge, we're sharing knowledge. Yeah. Which is, is that's open source, right?

488
00:46:40,620 --> 00:46:46,260
Is, is sharing all of it. Exactly. I appreciate in the podcast that there's different perspectives

489
00:46:46,260 --> 00:46:52,980
and different ways of presenting the information. Like, as you know, as a teacher, not everybody

490
00:46:52,980 --> 00:46:56,060
learns the same and not everybody connects with information in the same way, right? So

491
00:46:56,060 --> 00:47:01,100
to have it be presented in all these different ways is a huge asset and, and, and kudos to

492
00:47:01,100 --> 00:47:07,300
open source for, um, keeping that spirit of, of sharing and, and the collaboration, right?

493
00:47:07,300 --> 00:47:12,420
That's what's just so amazing. I love it. We've spread that to the internet, the Linux

494
00:47:12,420 --> 00:47:17,380
community and all their, you know, we used to be, you know, these quiet lugs and commit

495
00:47:17,380 --> 00:47:24,640
conferences are now spreading that love online. It's spreading everywhere. That's awesome.

496
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:28,180
Tell me a little bit more about, um, some of the other conferences cause you mentioned

497
00:47:28,180 --> 00:47:33,020
scale, but it sounds like you bounce around a little bit more too. Yeah. So, oh gosh,

498
00:47:33,020 --> 00:47:37,460
I want to go to Linux Fest Northwest cause it's the next big one that I haven't been

499
00:47:37,460 --> 00:47:42,180
to yet that I've been wanting to go. It's amazing. I'm totally biased because that was

500
00:47:42,180 --> 00:47:46,060
my first experience with conferences, but it would be great to see you there. Oh, I'd

501
00:47:46,060 --> 00:47:51,880
love to go. So I'm going to work on that. But I do, we've been having, uh, here in Los

502
00:47:51,880 --> 00:47:57,460
Angeles, uh, quite a few, um, open source summit, uh, conferences as well, which are

503
00:47:57,460 --> 00:48:01,740
fun. They're not quite as community based, but they're, they're growing a little bit

504
00:48:01,740 --> 00:48:06,580
more in that way, but it's, it's, it's more, you know, big business, but I, you know, I

505
00:48:06,580 --> 00:48:13,700
go for, um, the hallway track, you know, so it's the best place to be. It's the best part

506
00:48:13,700 --> 00:48:20,260
of a convention anyways, really the talks are wonderful expo halls, incredible, but

507
00:48:20,260 --> 00:48:25,700
it's those connections that you make in the hallway track that I love. That's what's really

508
00:48:25,700 --> 00:48:35,580
memorable. I find. Yeah. Tell me, I, I'm interested a little bit more in, um, some of your teaching.

509
00:48:35,580 --> 00:48:40,180
Oh, um, because you mentioned it sort of in some of your stories, it was the, it was some

510
00:48:40,180 --> 00:48:45,260
key aspects in some of your stories, but, um, what inspired you to move from kind of

511
00:48:45,260 --> 00:48:49,940
being the professional doing stuff behind the scenes to sharing that knowledge? You

512
00:48:49,940 --> 00:48:57,660
know what? I always was, I actually started out, um, in the nineties as a, uh, a tutor

513
00:48:57,660 --> 00:49:03,100
in the animation department. And then I went to TA and then ended up being on the board

514
00:49:03,100 --> 00:49:11,180
of directors for the department. And, and so I had always been doing that, um, uh, through

515
00:49:11,180 --> 00:49:16,820
my college years. And, um, that helped me get a lot of connections actually, you know,

516
00:49:16,820 --> 00:49:22,580
because I was doing that and had that experience, um, that helped me with my work experience,

517
00:49:22,580 --> 00:49:28,860
uh, getting into freelance work. So yeah, I ended up doing the teaching first. Yeah.

518
00:49:28,860 --> 00:49:31,860
And then both things I just said at the same time, and I feel like that's the real gift

519
00:49:31,860 --> 00:49:37,300
of, of, of, of a teacher. Sometimes you see, um, and maybe now I'm starting to speak about

520
00:49:37,300 --> 00:49:41,300
my personal experience, but you're sometimes you see teachers who were in the industry

521
00:49:41,300 --> 00:49:45,740
and, um, either have retired or decided to get out for some reason and they teach and

522
00:49:45,740 --> 00:49:49,940
they don't, they don't always have the same perspective as someone who's working in it,

523
00:49:49,940 --> 00:49:54,100
uh, alongside the teaching. Right. And so I really appreciate how you were kind of doing

524
00:49:54,100 --> 00:49:58,240
both. And that's the best benefit for the students, right? Is that you're, you're teaching

525
00:49:58,240 --> 00:50:00,740
them exactly what's happening in the industry today.

526
00:50:00,740 --> 00:50:04,660
And I get that actually from my students cause they, you know, know a lot of their other

527
00:50:04,660 --> 00:50:10,060
instructors, you know, used to, to do their profession, you know, and they're, they're

528
00:50:10,060 --> 00:50:16,380
now just teaching. And so I get my students are always amazed and you're still doing this.

529
00:50:16,380 --> 00:50:22,140
And they're, they're thrilled that I'm doing podcasting too. And they like that. I'm, I'm

530
00:50:22,140 --> 00:50:29,980
what we call it, Twitch tubing, Twitch tuber. And they're like, cool. My teacher is a Twitch

531
00:50:29,980 --> 00:50:40,700
streamer. But yeah, just, just, uh, you know, being able to, to share that enthusiasm with

532
00:50:40,700 --> 00:50:47,180
them and all the areas that I love. And then I'm still continuing to do work and, um, just

533
00:50:47,180 --> 00:50:48,180
love that.

534
00:50:48,180 --> 00:50:52,640
You're giving back to the community in so many different ways, you know, from teaching

535
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:58,180
to, um, some of the podcasts stuff that you're doing and even just showing up at conferences

536
00:50:58,180 --> 00:51:03,700
and Linux checks. And so, uh, thank you, I will say from the community for your, your

537
00:51:03,700 --> 00:51:07,900
big, big heart and your giving back. It's, it's really meaningful.

538
00:51:07,900 --> 00:51:12,900
Oh, it's been an honor to do it. It really has. This community is amazing.

539
00:51:12,900 --> 00:51:17,820
Yeah. And it's, it's growing and it's continuing to be even more amazing, which is, which is

540
00:51:17,820 --> 00:51:18,820
such a treat.

541
00:51:18,820 --> 00:51:23,420
And what's really been just really exciting for me is a lot of my students who end up

542
00:51:23,420 --> 00:51:28,420
getting work in the industry and becoming, you know, producers and animators and whatnot

543
00:51:28,420 --> 00:51:31,260
are part of the Linux community now and part of the Linux checks.

544
00:51:31,260 --> 00:51:34,420
You're seeing them evolve in your footsteps almost, right?

545
00:51:34,420 --> 00:51:39,860
Yeah. They, in fact, they call, they call themselves Jill Siples.

546
00:51:39,860 --> 00:51:44,420
That's awesome. You have a following.

547
00:51:44,420 --> 00:51:52,060
Yeah. So it's so funny cause at scale when I was introducing all the Linux game casts,

548
00:51:52,060 --> 00:51:56,540
all our hosts who, um, a lot of people at scale, they're like, Oh, is another student,

549
00:51:56,540 --> 00:52:02,540
another student, another former student, you know, yay, bringing them in.

550
00:52:02,540 --> 00:52:07,660
Well that must mean you're doing some good work. That's good feedback. I want to say

551
00:52:07,660 --> 00:52:12,500
thank you so, so much for chatting. I know you and I will continue to have these kinds

552
00:52:12,500 --> 00:52:17,120
of conversations and maybe we can share some of them in the future as well. Um, but thank

553
00:52:17,120 --> 00:52:20,940
you so much for your time. And this was really, really fun.

554
00:52:20,940 --> 00:52:27,180
Thank you so much for having me, Brent. This is an honor. And I can actually say, you know,

555
00:52:27,180 --> 00:52:31,420
it's kind of a dream come true. I've always wanted to get involved in Jupiter broadcasting.

556
00:52:31,420 --> 00:52:37,680
So here you are. Thank you so much for, for, for being involved in many ways. Um, is there

557
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:42,500
anywhere that you'd like to send people if they want to get connected with you or just

558
00:52:42,500 --> 00:52:51,180
hear you giggle or those kinds of things? Uh, so, um, I get several places. One is,

559
00:52:51,180 --> 00:52:59,500
um, at Twitter at Jill underscore Linux girl and at Mastodon at Jill underscore Linux girl

560
00:52:59,500 --> 00:53:10,140
at mast.linuxgamecast.com and on email it's Jill at linuxgamecast.com.

561
00:53:10,140 --> 00:53:15,540
I wondered if you had an ask of the community, um, either like, uh, something you'd like

562
00:53:15,540 --> 00:53:18,500
them to do or explore or try.

563
00:53:18,500 --> 00:53:25,940
Yeah. So I actually have two things. Okay, great. Bring it on. One is a current news

564
00:53:25,940 --> 00:53:32,060
story that's been happening. Please help support the gnome foundation and fighting the shot

565
00:53:32,060 --> 00:53:36,580
will image app patent troll and help send a message to patent trolls everywhere that

566
00:53:36,580 --> 00:53:43,060
they should never target free software. This, this is scary. This can be very scary, especially

567
00:53:43,060 --> 00:53:47,860
it's Ross child that's behind it and it's not good.

568
00:53:47,860 --> 00:53:51,380
The implications are huge, right? And so if we, if we can kind of get together and make

569
00:53:51,380 --> 00:53:54,180
a difference, I think, uh, that speaks volumes.

570
00:53:54,180 --> 00:53:58,820
Yeah. And you know, I had donated the first day I found out about it immediately. And,

571
00:53:58,820 --> 00:54:04,180
um, and if you can't donate monetarily, just spread the word on social media and on the

572
00:54:04,180 --> 00:54:11,060
internet, you know, all it takes is one person to spread the word and a hundred people will,

573
00:54:11,060 --> 00:54:16,420
will hear it and see it and they may contribute. So we're going to help them.

574
00:54:16,420 --> 00:54:19,820
Yeah. So let's get, get everyone's eyes on it for sure.

575
00:54:19,820 --> 00:54:27,780
Yeah. And the other thing is there are so many wonderful Linux podcasts and video casts

576
00:54:27,780 --> 00:54:33,780
out there, whether it be an RSS feed on YouTube, on Twitch or all three, like we've talked,

577
00:54:33,780 --> 00:54:39,780
been talking about, um, I encourage everyone to go find and watch them. You never know

578
00:54:39,780 --> 00:54:44,260
what amazing communities you will discover and learn from, and you just might become

579
00:54:44,260 --> 00:54:47,420
one of the contributing members yourself.

580
00:54:47,420 --> 00:54:50,100
Which has happened to both you and I, right?

581
00:54:50,100 --> 00:54:51,100
Yeah, exactly.

582
00:54:51,100 --> 00:54:54,820
Um, members of the community. And then you get a little closer and a little closer and

583
00:54:54,820 --> 00:54:59,220
all of a sudden one day you find yourself in the chair. So, um, I agree completely.

584
00:54:59,220 --> 00:55:05,540
Yay, Britt. If you can show up, you know, if it's at a conference, if it's at scale,

585
00:55:05,540 --> 00:55:09,300
if it's at Linux Fest Northwest or any other conference that catches your attention.

586
00:55:09,300 --> 00:55:11,020
Yeah. Get involved.

587
00:55:11,020 --> 00:55:14,940
For sure. Um, even, even in the online communities, you know, there's, there's all these telegram

588
00:55:14,940 --> 00:55:21,440
groups and live podcasts that get recorded every week. So, um, just show up. You never,

589
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:26,340
you never know what's going to happen. Well, thanks Jill. I hope to connect with you really

590
00:55:26,340 --> 00:55:30,580
soon and, uh, thank you so much for your time and for connecting. This was really fun.

591
00:55:30,580 --> 00:55:34,720
Thank you, Brent, so much. You're one of my favorite people in the community and I can't

592
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:37,660
wait to give you a hug when I see you in real life.

593
00:55:37,660 --> 00:55:43,740
Oh, thank you. Yeah, we did just figure out that, um, we're both going to be at this coming

594
00:55:43,740 --> 00:55:44,740
scale.

595
00:55:44,740 --> 00:55:46,740
Yeah. Yay.

596
00:55:46,740 --> 00:55:51,340
Um, can you remind, uh, some of us when that is coming up?

597
00:55:51,340 --> 00:55:59,100
Yeah. So it'll be, uh, March 5th through 8th of 2020, uh, scale 18x. Amazing.

598
00:55:59,100 --> 00:56:05,740
That sounds great. Uh, I am, I think in for a treat. It's going to be my first scale experience.

599
00:56:05,740 --> 00:56:06,740
So.

600
00:56:06,740 --> 00:56:07,740
Oh, I'm so excited.

601
00:56:07,740 --> 00:56:12,140
And I really look forward to meeting you there in person too. That's going to be great.

602
00:56:12,140 --> 00:56:13,140
Yay.

603
00:56:13,140 --> 00:56:14,140
Thanks Jill.

604
00:56:14,140 --> 00:56:18,660
Thank you so much, Brent. Love you community. Love everyone.

605
00:56:18,660 --> 00:56:21,860
Yes. Lots of love to the community. Thanks everyone.
