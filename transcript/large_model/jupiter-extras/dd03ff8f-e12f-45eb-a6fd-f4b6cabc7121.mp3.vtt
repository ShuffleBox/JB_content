00:00.000 --> 00:16.680
Well, hello, everyone. Welcome back to Brunch with Brent. I'm super excited today. I'm tempted

00:16.680 --> 00:21.640
to say extra excited today to be joined by Peter Adams. Peter, how are you doing?

00:21.640 --> 00:24.960
I'm doing great, man. Thanks for having me. Super excited to chat with you.

00:24.960 --> 00:31.960
Great. Welcome. Welcome to Brunch. I am extra excited, like I was saying, to have you join

00:31.960 --> 00:38.100
me for this conversation. You're bringing together two of my very deep passions. One

00:38.100 --> 00:45.260
is open source technologies and ideas, and the other one is photography. And of course,

00:45.260 --> 00:50.480
we're going to dive into how that comes into your life. You know, I'm just talking about

00:50.480 --> 00:55.880
those two juxtapositions, and it's making me smile like crazy. So, thank you for being

00:55.880 --> 01:00.920
the embodiment of that excitement.

01:00.920 --> 01:04.480
Happy to embody that. Two of my favorite things as well, so.

01:04.480 --> 01:10.800
Yeah, which is really cool. And the way I discovered some of your work was that Cheese,

01:10.800 --> 01:16.080
one of our friends and host at Jupiter Broadcasting, he mentioned one of your projects, which was

01:16.080 --> 01:21.120
the Faces of Open Source, which is a photography project that you're doing and have been doing

01:21.120 --> 01:23.800
for a while. Could you tell us a little bit about that?

01:23.800 --> 01:35.120
So I started that project back in 2014, 2015. And it's a portrait project, just basically

01:35.120 --> 01:41.520
photographing and exploring the open source community, people in the open source community.

01:41.520 --> 01:49.040
And my whole feeling was that open source often kind of gets relegated to these bizarro

01:49.040 --> 01:52.280
program names or acronyms.

01:52.280 --> 01:54.080
There are a few of those, right?

01:54.080 --> 02:01.920
Yeah, there's a couple million acronyms in the open source world. But finding the faces

02:01.920 --> 02:09.320
of the people and bringing a human element and really sort of seeing the community visually

02:09.320 --> 02:13.400
is not something that's super easy to do. It's super easy to browse GitHub pages. It's

02:13.400 --> 02:18.040
super easy to get on a mailing list. It's very hard to put a face with a name. And as

02:18.040 --> 02:26.280
a photographer, that really bugged me. So I just dove in and started doing portraits

02:26.280 --> 02:35.860
of notable and unsung faces in the open source community. Some people I sought out are fairly

02:35.860 --> 02:44.320
well known, but many of them are not. Many of them are new to open source. Many of them

02:44.320 --> 02:50.120
have played a critical role but have been a little bit more unsung in the history books.

02:50.120 --> 02:56.960
And so I really wanted to sort of create a collection that was representative of the

02:56.960 --> 03:05.600
community and that people could see who the faces that are creating this amazing community

03:05.600 --> 03:12.800
and this amazing software, who they were. And so I started that in 2015 and we're up

03:12.800 --> 03:17.640
over 100 portraits at this point. I think it's 120 something.

03:17.640 --> 03:25.720
What a wonderful feat. 100 portraits for any professional photographer who's really put

03:25.720 --> 03:30.360
their heart into a single portrait. Doing 100 is no small thing.

03:30.360 --> 03:38.740
Yeah. It's been a great journey and it's a project that I have to fit in between other

03:38.740 --> 03:44.280
work and other projects. And sometimes I get lucky and I'll go to a conference and there's

03:44.280 --> 03:48.620
a whole bunch of people that I'm wanting to photograph that are at that conference. But

03:48.620 --> 03:55.440
oftentimes it's me loading the car and showing up at somebody's backyard or somebody's living

03:55.440 --> 03:57.680
room or somebody's front yard.

03:57.680 --> 03:58.680
Really?

03:58.680 --> 04:07.440
Yeah. Or office, cram all the gear into a conference room and just kind of go from there.

04:07.440 --> 04:12.600
And that's been the hardest part of the project is just the logistics of getting people scheduled

04:12.600 --> 04:20.200
because there's a good concentration of people in California where I am, but a lot of people

04:20.200 --> 04:25.080
are all over the map. And I get to New York a lot and we've done a lot of shoots in New

04:25.080 --> 04:32.280
York as well for people. But I have to try to time when people are traveling to the US,

04:32.280 --> 04:36.660
maybe they're going to be in the same city I'm going to be in, or maybe I can extend

04:36.660 --> 04:42.680
a trip on another project to photograph them for this project. So the logistics part has

04:42.680 --> 04:51.040
really been the hardest part of getting to 120 plus people at this point. And last year

04:51.040 --> 05:00.480
we did I think 18 or 19, the year before that I did 30. So it really depends kind of on

05:00.480 --> 05:04.680
how logistics and schedules kind of align, how many more people we had.

05:04.680 --> 05:11.000
And do you have someone kind of helping you both on the logistics end, connecting with

05:11.000 --> 05:15.280
people and also on site when you're actually taking the photographs?

05:15.280 --> 05:24.320
Well on site, if I can, I'll have an assistant with me, but oftentimes these are fairly simple

05:24.320 --> 05:30.520
shoots and it's just me and a car full of equipment. If we're shooting in a studio,

05:30.520 --> 05:39.120
I'll tend to have an assistant help with set up or things like that. But it's really just

05:39.120 --> 05:45.760
me. I mean, logistically I'm approaching people, reaching out, writing people. Everybody gets

05:45.760 --> 05:51.400
a random email from this random photographer saying he's doing a project.

05:51.400 --> 05:56.560
But actually at this point, a lot of participants have been really great because they're referring

05:56.560 --> 06:00.580
me to other people or they've been really gracious with their time and they've kind

06:00.580 --> 06:06.560
of opened their Rolodex. So they make introductions to other people in the community on my behalf.

06:06.560 --> 06:11.680
And that's been really helpful and really, really amazing that people are willing to

06:11.680 --> 06:16.800
do that and see the project grow and be successful through those introductions.

06:16.800 --> 06:23.540
It has been so cool for me to see some of these portraits. I've mostly taken them in

06:23.540 --> 06:31.480
from your website and it's true what you're saying. We know maybe a handful of popular

06:31.480 --> 06:37.780
faces, the Linuses and such, but there are so many sort of intriguing looking people

06:37.780 --> 06:43.600
there that you just kind of want to click on and learn their story as well. I have really

06:43.600 --> 06:51.440
appreciated that connection of the visual and the sort of people side of things connected

06:51.440 --> 06:57.100
with the story where you're a little bit more familiar with the code they wrote or the project

06:57.100 --> 07:02.280
they worked on for decades or something like that. And has it kind of surprised you sometimes

07:02.280 --> 07:06.840
when you get to meet some of these people? Like, oh, they're not the image that you may

07:06.840 --> 07:12.320
have made in your mind because we all do. Or how has that experience been sort of meeting

07:12.320 --> 07:13.320
all these people?

07:13.320 --> 07:18.160
I mean, the experience of meeting everybody has been amazing. It's been phenomenal. Just

07:18.160 --> 07:25.000
being able to spend time. I mean, sometimes I get an hour with somebody. Sometimes I only

07:25.000 --> 07:33.700
get a few minutes with somebody. But all the times I do, before every shoot, I do my research

07:33.700 --> 07:40.800
and I get online and I read extensively about what they've done and their history and their

07:40.800 --> 07:47.760
background and if they've done any other interviews. So I research, I kind of know something about

07:47.760 --> 07:54.880
the person, at least their public persona by the time they show up on my set. But you

07:54.880 --> 07:59.280
never really can get a handle on somebody's personality until they're in front of your

07:59.280 --> 08:07.320
camera and you're face to face. And in some cases, yeah, I've been pleasantly surprised,

08:07.320 --> 08:16.880
you know, 99% of the time, you know, a couple of curve balls here and there. But for the

08:16.880 --> 08:21.000
most time, everybody in this community has been really wonderful and really gracious

08:21.000 --> 08:28.280
with their time and really excited to participate in a project like this. And I think that,

08:28.280 --> 08:33.120
you know, at this point with it going on for a number of years now, I will get, you know,

08:33.120 --> 08:38.240
I will get notes, you know, from past participants that have been following, you know, the project

08:38.240 --> 08:43.360
for a few years or people that have just, you know, have seen it kind of evolve over

08:43.360 --> 08:50.640
the years. And people have been really encouraging, you know, encouraging me to keep going and

08:50.640 --> 08:56.480
are really appreciative that there's a documentation of this community because there really hasn't

08:56.480 --> 09:01.520
been. And that was something that was so fascinating to me when I was doing the research on, you

09:01.520 --> 09:06.400
know, on this project was that this is such an important thing. Open source is such an

09:06.400 --> 09:14.120
important phenomenon. And there's just, there's very little photographic documentation of

09:14.120 --> 09:18.120
the people, you know, that have created this. I mean, you know, there's, there's tons of

09:18.120 --> 09:26.040
photos of Tim Berners-Lee and Vint Cerf and, you know, all, you know, the, the, the mega,

09:26.040 --> 09:31.800
you know, stars of, of the, of the, you know, internet and the web and, you know, these,

09:31.800 --> 09:38.080
these massive, you know, projects. Of course. And Linus has a lot of photos. There's actually

09:38.080 --> 09:40.440
a funny story about Linus when I photographed him.

09:40.440 --> 09:45.200
Well, I like funny stories. I'll never forget it because, you know, I

09:45.200 --> 09:49.400
was, you know, I was concerned, you know, Linus is, you know, you know, Linus is Linus.

09:49.400 --> 09:55.360
He's larger, larger than life figure in the, in the community and, and, and confrontational

09:55.360 --> 10:00.160
at the same time, you know, or controversial, I should say, maybe confrontational on, on

10:00.160 --> 10:04.200
mailing lists, but, you know, slightly controversial. And I just, you know, I had never met him

10:04.200 --> 10:08.920
before and, you know, I didn't, I didn't really, you know, how sensitive he was going to be

10:08.920 --> 10:13.600
to, to be photographed, but he agreed, you know, very, very quickly and was very, was

10:13.600 --> 10:20.600
very happy and accommodating, you know, for, for our sitting. And, you know, at the end

10:20.600 --> 10:25.440
I make everybody sign a, sign a release, you know, a photo release as I'm sure you do when

10:25.440 --> 10:31.120
you do your shoots. You know, I asked him if he had any issue signing that and his,

10:31.120 --> 10:40.840
his, his note, his, his response to me was, have you seen the pictures of me on the internet?

10:40.840 --> 10:46.020
And I was like, oh man, that's so, it's, it's so refreshing that, you know, most people

10:46.020 --> 10:52.560
are so concerned with, with images and their photography is being used. And, you know,

10:52.560 --> 10:56.320
I had done the photo research of him and, you know, there's, there's, you can just go

10:56.320 --> 11:01.480
to Google images and see some, some pretty funny pictures of him, you know, giving the

11:01.480 --> 11:05.920
finger to people and all sorts of stuff. I mean, it's, but he was super accommodating

11:05.920 --> 11:12.240
and, and really, really generous with his time at a busy conference, you know, to take,

11:12.240 --> 11:15.960
take the time and do a sitting with me. So that was, that was really fun.

11:15.960 --> 11:21.600
Yeah. I think as, as you certainly know, since you've been doing photography for a long while,

11:21.600 --> 11:27.840
and I certainly know cause I am a professional photographer as well. There's this real opportunity

11:27.840 --> 11:33.520
when you get to do a portrait of someone it ends up, you know, if no one's ever had a

11:33.520 --> 11:41.480
professional portrait done it's quite an intimate experience. And if you're with a great photographer,

11:41.480 --> 11:46.640
they will make that intimate experience a positive thing, you know, make you feel the

11:46.640 --> 11:55.320
most comfortable you possibly can. And that can lead to some really fast connections,

11:55.320 --> 12:01.360
some really deep connections as well within, you know, five, 10, 15 minutes. So I imagine

12:01.360 --> 12:09.380
for you and, and maybe even for those you're photographing that it's kind of nice to have

12:09.380 --> 12:13.480
some of those discussions, you know, at a busy conference, but you're, you're, you're

12:13.480 --> 12:18.840
going away into, I'm assuming a room or something like that and just having a bit of a breather

12:18.840 --> 12:24.200
and a, and a really important connection. So has that been a nice portion of it, of

12:24.200 --> 12:27.480
it for you, just like having that intimate time with some of these people?

12:27.480 --> 12:32.000
Oh yeah. I mean, and, and what an honor to be able to get that. I mean, you know, most

12:32.000 --> 12:38.680
of these people are on planes, you know, 24 seven and you know, between projects and their

12:38.680 --> 12:44.000
day job and then, you know, the conference circuit. I mean, the life of an open source

12:44.000 --> 12:49.760
advocate is, is quite, is quite busy actually. It's what I've learned. You know, I never

12:49.760 --> 12:55.080
know, you know, some, some people it's taken me years to schedule. We've literally, I have

12:55.080 --> 13:02.300
email threads, you know, that go for multiple years trying to find the overlap and schedules

13:02.300 --> 13:06.720
and you know, trying to get somebody to be in the same place that I'm going to be or

13:06.720 --> 13:11.040
for me to be in the same place they're going to be. And it's, it's very difficult. So when

13:11.040 --> 13:14.760
I do get them in front of the camera, you're, you're absolutely right. It is an intimate

13:14.760 --> 13:20.520
thing. And I think most people have not had their portrait done before. And I always ask

13:20.520 --> 13:24.600
people when I photograph them, if they've had their portrait taken before, you know,

13:24.600 --> 13:28.940
not like a, not a corporate headshot type portrait, but like, have they ever really

13:28.940 --> 13:35.040
been in a portrait sitting? And, and it's, it's very rare for somebody to have had that

13:35.040 --> 13:39.640
experience. And I think, you know, as you know, it takes a little while to get past

13:39.640 --> 13:45.680
the, you know, the discomfort of being in front of a camera. And my sets tend to be,

13:45.680 --> 13:50.420
you know, pretty elaborate. I mean, if we're shooting in a, in a studio, you know, it's

13:50.420 --> 13:57.040
a full on photo studio and you know, these, these are, these are all portraits on white.

13:57.040 --> 13:58.040
So it's, you know,

13:58.040 --> 14:00.920
So you're shooting with more than one light sort of thing.

14:00.920 --> 14:07.240
Yeah. It's, it's six lights and five C stands and flags and, you know, it's a whole, it's

14:07.240 --> 14:13.920
a, it's an involved, it's an involved lighting setup to do these portraits. So, you know,

14:13.920 --> 14:17.360
I think, and some people have never been on, you know, professional photo shoot before

14:17.360 --> 14:22.220
they've ever been on set before. So, you know, it takes a little while to try to, you know,

14:22.220 --> 14:24.840
get people into the zone and, and have them settle.

14:24.840 --> 14:27.640
Yeah. That setup alone can be intimidating, right?

14:27.640 --> 14:33.160
Yeah. It's just, you know, it's, it's, it's a lot for somebody to just walk into if they've

14:33.160 --> 14:38.880
never, if they've never experienced it before. But then, you know, you know, then people,

14:38.880 --> 14:44.600
you know, typically, you know, relax and, and you find, you find the rhythm and you

14:44.600 --> 14:49.240
find the flow and, and you develop the connection and, and the photos come from that.

14:49.240 --> 14:55.400
Well, you know, you made me smile and laugh actually when we first connected on the phone

14:55.400 --> 15:00.680
to set up this conversation because one of the first things you did, and I bet you didn't

15:00.680 --> 15:06.840
even consciously realize you did this. But one of the first things you did was ask me

15:06.840 --> 15:13.000
about five to seven questions about me, just to kind of, you know, we're developing a connection,

15:13.000 --> 15:17.160
which is important, but I was like, ah ha, this is exactly what I do to other people

15:17.160 --> 15:21.480
when I'm, you know, setting them up for a portrait or, but that's just become my personality

15:21.480 --> 15:26.480
is I've become really curious about people. And you were doing that to me. And I was like,

15:26.480 --> 15:30.920
oh, I see where two photographers in the same room here.

15:30.920 --> 15:33.520
It's like, if people are going to listen to this and like, I didn't get one answer on

15:33.520 --> 15:37.680
either of them because they were so busy asking each other questions. No, that's just what

15:37.680 --> 15:41.160
we have to do. I mean, that's, that's how you learn. I mean, I think, I mean, for me,

15:41.160 --> 15:46.800
at least that's why, that's why I pick up the camera, you know, is to have that experience

15:46.800 --> 15:53.600
to, to connect with somebody, to learn something about another person and, and to have that

15:53.600 --> 15:58.440
connection. And of course the art that comes out of it is, is very satisfying, but the

15:58.440 --> 16:03.640
process of getting to that art and learning about the person and learning about their

16:03.640 --> 16:10.040
experiences is, you know, I think that's why a lot of people become photographers because

16:10.040 --> 16:12.880
that's what they, that's what they want to be doing with their life. They want to be

16:12.880 --> 16:15.920
learning in a continual, continually learning essentially.

16:15.920 --> 16:17.280
You're describing me right there.

16:17.280 --> 16:19.680
Yeah, exactly. I know it.

16:19.680 --> 16:27.320
And photography certainly for me, and I imagine for you as well, has allowed me to spend time

16:27.320 --> 16:32.320
in environments that otherwise I would never ever have access to. Right? Like for instance,

16:32.320 --> 16:38.220
for you, this project is allowing you access to people you would likely otherwise never

16:38.220 --> 16:40.720
talk to in, in a hundred years. Right?

16:40.720 --> 16:41.720
Totally.

16:41.720 --> 16:49.440
There's something about photography's ability to connect people and allow you to experience

16:49.440 --> 16:55.120
other people's lives in a deep, meaningful way for an afternoon or, you know, a few minutes

16:55.120 --> 16:59.400
even. That is one of the most exciting things to me.

16:59.400 --> 17:05.560
Yeah. It's, it's definitely a passport, you know, that a, a, a secret kind of passport

17:05.560 --> 17:11.720
that, you know, not everybody has and, you know, it gives you that entree, you know,

17:11.720 --> 17:18.400
just into these experiences that you're looking to have or you're looking to, you know, get

17:18.400 --> 17:24.800
access to. And it's amazing, you know, I, you know, I do a lot of personal projects

17:24.800 --> 17:30.360
and I'm always shocked, you know, when I come up with an idea for a personal project, you

17:30.360 --> 17:36.440
know, like, like faces of open source or another one of my projects. And, you know, when you're

17:36.440 --> 17:40.080
first doing the research, you're always thinking to yourself, Oh man, am I, am I, is this ever

17:40.080 --> 17:45.960
going to happen? Is, is, is anyone ever going to say yes to this project? Are they really

17:45.960 --> 17:51.720
going to let me in there with my camera to do X, Y, and Z? And I always think, you know,

17:51.720 --> 17:56.000
there's no way it's never going to happen. And then you write the email and somebody

17:56.000 --> 18:00.840
comes back and they're like, yeah, yeah, I'll do that. Or yeah, I'll give you that access.

18:00.840 --> 18:06.420
And it's amazing how many, how welcoming people are. Um, you know, with the right project

18:06.420 --> 18:12.700
in the right context, um, the camera is really a sort of a passport into, into these other

18:12.700 --> 18:14.000
worlds and situations.

18:14.000 --> 18:18.800
And yet with that passport comes a lot of responsibility, right? If you're given this

18:18.800 --> 18:24.420
access and you kind of don't respect it, that does a real disservice to everyone. And so

18:24.420 --> 18:30.560
I feel like you, you kind of take on this really important role in, in nurturing the

18:30.560 --> 18:36.260
people you're also running into. That's clearly gotten you more and more yeses as you dive

18:36.260 --> 18:37.880
into people's networks, right?

18:37.880 --> 18:42.960
Yeah, no, I totally agree with you. I mean, it's a, it's a huge responsibility. And, and,

18:42.960 --> 18:48.420
and I think that's also where the, the perfectionists, you know, a lot of photographers I find are

18:48.420 --> 18:52.940
perfectionists as well because you know, when then you get this access, you've, you've done

18:52.940 --> 18:59.320
all this, this legwork to get to the place where you can photograph somebody and you

18:59.320 --> 19:05.780
want to do the best job that you could possibly do every single photograph, every single sitting,

19:05.780 --> 19:11.480
every single subject, you want to make sure that you're doing your best on behalf of that

19:11.480 --> 19:17.360
person and doing the sitting justice because the photographs are, are hopefully going to

19:17.360 --> 19:23.520
live on. And you know, this is, this is a super important, you know, topic or project

19:23.520 --> 19:27.080
that you're spending time on. You want to make sure it's the best that it could ever

19:27.080 --> 19:34.800
be. So you go the extra mile and you knock yourself out every time because that's the,

19:34.800 --> 19:41.240
that's the quid pro quo of, of getting access is that you're going to give it 150% every

19:41.240 --> 19:42.240
time.

19:42.240 --> 19:45.520
I'm sitting here nodding profusely at all your words like, yep, that's how you need

19:45.520 --> 19:51.400
to do it. And so now that you have, you know, a hundred plus photographs, uh, under your

19:51.400 --> 19:57.680
belt for this specific project, um, I guess, what are you, where are you hoping that they

19:57.680 --> 20:05.240
live longterm? You know, is there a place you'd like to give the greater public access

20:05.240 --> 20:10.600
to them or some kind of access from the open source community? Like what, what do you see

20:10.600 --> 20:11.600
as the end goal?

20:11.600 --> 20:17.280
Well, I, you know, I, I think originally when I started the project, I thought, um,

20:17.280 --> 20:23.680
you know, if I can get access to, you know, a representative enough group of the, you

20:23.680 --> 20:29.840
know, within the community that it would be, it would be a great book. And so I'm, I've

20:29.840 --> 20:36.200
been trying to get a book, you know, together and design a book and, and get it out, you

20:36.200 --> 20:41.600
know, seriously for the last year. And, you know, it's just been lots of life getting

20:41.600 --> 20:42.600
in the way of that.

20:42.600 --> 20:46.240
Yeah. And a book is no small thing to do. Well, you know,

20:46.240 --> 20:52.080
Exactly, exactly. So ultimately I really do want to do that. I think that, you know, being

20:52.080 --> 20:57.800
able to sit down with a book and look at the photographs, um, you know, in person and in

20:57.800 --> 21:06.180
a, in a large size as well is really appealing and impactful. And yeah, I think that that's

21:06.180 --> 21:10.680
going to be the most accessible way for people to physically get kind of get their hands

21:10.680 --> 21:15.960
on the photographs. I, but I think, you know, because it's open source and so much of open

21:15.960 --> 21:22.120
sources, I mean, online and it's just, the website is going to be really the focal point

21:22.120 --> 21:27.680
of the project over time. I have done some exhibits like this last year, we exhibited

21:27.680 --> 21:32.000
all the photos at OSCON in the OSCON conference in Portland.

21:32.000 --> 21:33.000
Nice.

21:33.000 --> 21:37.960
Um, you know, these are, you know, sort of, you know, short exhibits in the sense that,

21:37.960 --> 21:42.560
you know, OSCON is really, you know, a little less than a week. So we do these digital exhibits

21:42.560 --> 21:49.200
on, you know, these, on, you know, monitors and a portrait orientation and, and it looks

21:49.200 --> 21:53.560
really good and it's really, it's really impactful. And it's an, it's a nice way to do very short

21:53.560 --> 22:01.040
term exhibits. Um, I would like to exhibit the prints just because I do all the prints

22:01.040 --> 22:07.160
myself and I, I love printing. So, um, you know, be an excuse to, to be able to sort

22:07.160 --> 22:13.720
of hunker down and, and, you know, do some, some exhibition quality printing, but that's

22:13.720 --> 22:17.480
a, that's sort of a major undertaking. I have to find the right, it has to be the right

22:17.480 --> 22:24.360
venue and it has to be a long enough term exhibit to justify the expense of doing something

22:24.360 --> 22:25.360
like that.

22:25.360 --> 22:29.600
Yeah. Traveling with prints is no small, you know, that's, that's quite a feat.

22:29.600 --> 22:34.560
Yeah, exactly. I mean, you know, typically you have, you're, you're mounting them and,

22:34.560 --> 22:40.440
and then shipping them mounted and, and these are all, you know, fairly high resolution,

22:40.440 --> 22:47.200
you know, these are all big, big files. So I, they, they print life size essentially.

22:47.200 --> 22:52.760
And so it's just, it's costly to move stuff around. Um, but I, you know, I hope to do

22:52.760 --> 22:58.260
a real physical exhibit of the prints at some point. Um, maybe in conjunction with launching

22:58.260 --> 23:02.640
the book, we'll see that, that that's probably going to be the right time to do it. But in

23:02.640 --> 23:09.000
the meantime, um, conferences will invite me to come and, you know, exhibit the photos

23:09.000 --> 23:13.440
digitally, you know, on monitors and, and that has been a really nice way to get the

23:13.440 --> 23:19.680
community to see them and interact with them, you know, beyond just them being on the web.

23:19.680 --> 23:26.000
There's nothing like seeing a print in person, you know, uh, either through a book or, or

23:26.000 --> 23:31.840
my favorite, which would be as large as possible, right. Um, and in person, especially if the

23:31.840 --> 23:37.160
artist is there, uh, there's just, there's just something about that human connection

23:37.160 --> 23:44.120
that you just can't get on the web as wonderful as the web is. Um, so yeah, yeah, no, I agree.

23:44.120 --> 23:49.480
The definition of the prints is, and I've, I've printed all of, all of these portraits.

23:49.480 --> 23:54.360
You know, I have, you know, I have all the work prints that I do because the printing

23:54.360 --> 24:00.360
is actually part of my editing process with, um, especially with black and white. Um, you

24:00.360 --> 24:05.880
know, it's, you can, you can only get the photograph to be, you know, so far on the

24:05.880 --> 24:10.840
computer and then, you know, I have to, you know, I have to print it and sit with it.

24:10.840 --> 24:15.600
And, you know, sometimes I tell people, I say, it may be, it may be a month or two before

24:15.600 --> 24:19.360
you hear back from me on this just cause I'm traveling or something like that. But also

24:19.360 --> 24:25.680
it's, it's not a quick, it's not a quick edit. You know, these, the portraits take some time

24:25.680 --> 24:30.880
to really sit with and, and you kind of have to marinate in the portrait, if you will,

24:30.880 --> 24:35.760
and put it up on the wall and, you know, make sure you've got the tonality right. And, you

24:35.760 --> 24:40.120
know, come back to it in a day or two and, you know, really just make sure it's, it's

24:40.120 --> 24:45.380
dialed in right. And then these faces are so, you know, the faces of the, of the subjects

24:45.380 --> 24:52.520
on that project are, are so awesome that it's just, it's so nice to be able to get kind

24:52.520 --> 24:56.560
of right up to it. Whereas with a monitor, you know, you're not, you're not really going

24:56.560 --> 25:00.140
to get right up to it the way you can with a print.

25:00.140 --> 25:04.360
Nor will it necessarily do the photographic work any justice. Right? I mean, monitors

25:04.360 --> 25:08.600
are pretty good, but yeah, it's just, it's not the same. It's not the same. I love hearing

25:08.600 --> 25:13.000
a little bit about your process there. It sounds to me like you're really bringing a

25:13.000 --> 25:20.280
lot of your heart and your attention to showing every single person and every single face,

25:20.280 --> 25:26.940
I guess, bringing them to their very best for the experience that you had. So, I feel

25:26.940 --> 25:33.800
like that's a real, that's a really important thing to do for people. And I love hearing

25:33.800 --> 25:38.560
sort of that, that depth of attention that you're bringing to it. So, thank you for doing

25:38.560 --> 25:43.040
that for, for everyone you're photographing, you know, it feels like we've all got stories

25:43.040 --> 25:49.400
to tell and, and, and, and capturing people that way is a real gift, really.

25:49.400 --> 25:54.560
Yeah. I mean, it just goes back to the 150%, you know, if you're going to get somebody

25:54.560 --> 26:00.200
to show up in front of your camera, you're going to go all the way and beyond just to

26:00.200 --> 26:05.380
make sure that that's the best portrait. You know, and an, and an honest portrait too,

26:05.380 --> 26:12.920
you know, you know, of them and, and that's, you know, as a, as a portrait photographer,

26:12.920 --> 26:18.800
you know, that's a, that's always a balance you're trying to strike, which is making an

26:18.800 --> 26:23.880
authentic, you know, sort of honest portrait of somebody that reveals something, you know,

26:23.880 --> 26:27.360
that you get a little bit of a, of an idea of who the person is or something about their

26:27.360 --> 26:38.000
personality through, through the, the portrait as opposed to a highly stylized, you know,

26:38.000 --> 26:45.240
you know, rendition of somebody that may not really be, you know, how you saw the person

26:45.240 --> 26:48.560
in that moment. So that's always a balance you're trying to strike.

26:48.560 --> 26:56.740
Ah, the life of photography. Yeah. It's such a great one. Can I ask you how you originally

26:56.740 --> 27:01.280
got into photography? Like what was it about photography itself that kind of grabbed you

27:01.280 --> 27:02.960
and wouldn't let go?

27:02.960 --> 27:10.740
So I, you know, first picked up a camera really in high school, started with high school photography

27:10.740 --> 27:18.160
and I would say I was pretty much hooked, you know, within the, you know, my, the first

27:18.160 --> 27:20.240
photography class I ever took in high school.

27:20.240 --> 27:21.240
You got the bug, right?

27:21.240 --> 27:26.520
Yeah. And my high school was really good. It had like a really good, uh, it had a lot

27:26.520 --> 27:33.520
of photo lab and it had a really good, uh, set of staff and teachers. And it had like

27:33.520 --> 27:39.100
multiple levels, you know, had like the photo one and the photo two and the photo three,

27:39.100 --> 27:45.700
you know, courses. So you could really over, you know, the course of high school, you could

27:45.700 --> 27:51.640
be doing photography all through high school and continually learning new stuff, you know,

27:51.640 --> 27:58.720
the entire time. And, you know, I just, you know, I just got hooked in it and, you know,

27:58.720 --> 28:02.680
I would show up on the weekends to use the lab and the teacher would give me the key

28:02.680 --> 28:08.120
and, you know, she, she trusted me to, you know, be in there and yeah, this is all film.

28:08.120 --> 28:12.280
So you were, you know, you were basically developing your own black and white film and

28:12.280 --> 28:14.320
then doing your own printing in the dark room.

28:14.320 --> 28:18.740
And which is such a special experience. If you've, if anyone's ever had that experience,

28:18.740 --> 28:19.920
it's like nothing else.

28:19.920 --> 28:26.440
Oh yeah. It's, I mean, I spent so many hours in the dark room, you know, in my teenage

28:26.440 --> 28:32.200
years and in my twenties, um, I don't miss it at all now just cause it's such a, yeah,

28:32.200 --> 28:35.320
we're lucky now. Right. But you know, that's when I sort of first got into it and I had

28:35.320 --> 28:40.000
a couple of friends that were really into it as well. So that really helped. And I was

28:40.000 --> 28:44.040
going to go to school after, you know, I was going to go to, um, after I graduated from

28:44.040 --> 28:49.960
high school, I, um, became a teaching assistant at the international center of photography

28:49.960 --> 28:56.920
in New York and TA'd, you know, a few classes in exchange for getting access to their dark

28:56.920 --> 29:03.000
rooms. So I would, I would print there and then I would be a TA for visiting photographers

29:03.000 --> 29:08.160
that would do their classes at ICP. And I just thought, Oh man, this is the greatest

29:08.160 --> 29:12.920
thing in the world. This is what I want to do. And, and when I went off to college, I,

29:12.920 --> 29:18.480
I almost went to art school. I kind of thought about it and, and, um, I wound up going to

29:18.480 --> 29:24.640
college and, and, um, at Trinity college in Hartford, Connecticut, and their photo lab

29:24.640 --> 29:31.400
was just, it was just abysmal. So I petitioned the student government for a bunch of money

29:31.400 --> 29:38.360
and, and actually was able to build a new photo lab for them. Um, when, when I was an

29:38.360 --> 29:39.360
undergrad there.

29:39.360 --> 29:40.360
Good for you.

29:40.360 --> 29:45.080
Yeah. And then, you know, like I just, you know, this is what I was kind of, I was going

29:45.080 --> 29:53.160
to do, you know, I was just like total photo nerd, total dark room nerd. And then I started

29:53.160 --> 30:00.360
to get into computers, uh, cause at that point I went, you know, Trinity was one of the first

30:00.360 --> 30:08.600
schools in the country that had wired their, um, residential dorms with ethernet. So every

30:08.600 --> 30:16.160
student had ethernet jack in their dorm room and the school was hooked up to the internet

30:16.160 --> 30:20.840
via T one, which at the time was pretty good, you know, pretty good bandwidth back. This

30:20.840 --> 30:26.200
is the mid nineties, early and mid nineties. So I had started getting into computers cause

30:26.200 --> 30:32.440
my best friend was at Dartmouth and we, Dartmouth, you know, had this very forward thinking email

30:32.440 --> 30:36.760
system. They had developed their own email and the whole campus was electronic and everybody

30:36.760 --> 30:42.400
used email to communicate up there. And we wanted to send email back and forth to each

30:42.400 --> 30:48.600
other, you know, from, from Trinity to Dartmouth. So to do that, I had to get an account on,

30:48.600 --> 30:55.480
on the Vax, uh, you know, as this, you know, you know, basically mainframe that was in

30:55.480 --> 31:01.280
the computer center. Right. And to do that, I had to learn, you know, Unix commands, you

31:01.280 --> 31:07.040
know, cause the Vax ran, I don't remember what variant of Unix, but, um, you know, maybe

31:07.040 --> 31:12.640
a system five or whatever it was. I see. So I can see how this is where it all begins.

31:12.640 --> 31:17.440
You can see this is exactly where it all begins. So, you know, I log in, you know, you know,

31:17.440 --> 31:24.240
I've got a Mac and I'm using, you know, uh, telnet or, you know, telnet program to log

31:24.240 --> 31:31.260
into this Vax and type in, you know, these commands to change directories and open up,

31:31.260 --> 31:36.160
you know, um, the mail program, which at the time was, I think it was pine was what I was

31:36.160 --> 31:41.840
using to start. And I just had to learn these Unix commands and, and I would get stuck and

31:41.840 --> 31:45.040
I would screw something up and I would have to go down to the computer center and I would

31:45.040 --> 31:51.280
have to bug the mail administrator to show me how to, you know, flush my mail queue cause

31:51.280 --> 31:56.000
I had screwed something up. And, you know, um, so I started to learn all these commands

31:56.000 --> 32:01.640
and, and these funny programs and he would give me these one liners, you know, these

32:01.640 --> 32:07.420
one line shell commands, you know, with pipes and stuff that would, you know, grip my mail

32:07.420 --> 32:12.960
spool and output it to a text file so I could read it cause I had screwed something up and

32:12.960 --> 32:17.060
pine wasn't recognizing it or I don't remember what it was at this point, but I had to learn

32:17.060 --> 32:21.400
all these programs. And I remember at that point thinking like, who the hell comes up

32:21.400 --> 32:27.440
with the names, all these things. I mean, all said, of course, pine, what the hell,

32:27.440 --> 32:31.680
like what does this all stand for? You know, like what is, what is all this? And it, I

32:31.680 --> 32:35.760
didn't, I kind of, you know, I, I mentally, I look at that now as like, yeah, I remember

32:35.760 --> 32:40.640
having that thought and then I kind of put it out of my mind and you know, then, you

32:40.640 --> 32:46.200
know, 20 years later and I come back to this project, the faces of open source, I'm photographing

32:46.200 --> 32:54.480
you know, Al Aho of awk and Peter Weinberger, you know, like the people that created awk,

32:54.480 --> 33:00.280
the people that wrote said the people that, you know, Ken Thompson, you know, you know,

33:00.280 --> 33:05.200
you know, the, the people that came up with the algorithms behind grip and you know, send

33:05.200 --> 33:09.800
mail and all these Unix programs that, you know, I first interacted with, you know, just

33:09.800 --> 33:12.400
when I, you know, kind of got into the internet.

33:12.400 --> 33:18.640
What's most interesting to me about that as a tiniest side is that like most computer

33:18.640 --> 33:26.840
users these days never, ever interact with any of those, right? Although they were just

33:26.840 --> 33:33.360
so important for the timeline of computers and timeline of, you know, Unix and the open

33:33.360 --> 33:38.760
source and all of that. So, so it's great for you to have a little bit of that personal

33:38.760 --> 33:43.600
history and now, you know, a few years later, you're getting to meet some of these people

33:43.600 --> 33:48.040
that that must feel really cool. It was, it was cool. And in fact, with this project,

33:48.040 --> 33:53.720
that's kind of where I started. I started with the, the Unix, um, the folks at bell

33:53.720 --> 34:01.880
labs, um, that wrote Unix and I started with that community. And then I started photographing

34:01.880 --> 34:07.440
from there. I started photographing the BSD community and then the Linux community. And

34:07.440 --> 34:11.960
I kind of went through operating systems and then I, you're like tracing history almost,

34:11.960 --> 34:16.640
right? Exactly. Exactly. I figured I'll start at the, I'll start at the beginning and then

34:16.640 --> 34:22.440
kind of work my way down the family tree, um, and then out to these other communities.

34:22.440 --> 34:26.660
And it's been, it's been, it's been really, really cool to sort of retrace some of my

34:26.660 --> 34:31.840
own personal computing history through this project and then meet, meet some of the people,

34:31.840 --> 34:37.720
you know, who, who are behind all this, this tech that we, you know, I mean, as you say,

34:37.720 --> 34:43.140
most people don't even interact with it anymore, but what's amazing and what's totally astonishing

34:43.140 --> 34:49.420
to me and, and it's so wonderful is that all of this tech is still living in their computers

34:49.420 --> 34:55.720
right under the glossy gooey, you know, if you're on a Mac, you know, it's, you know,

34:55.720 --> 35:03.560
you've got BSD in there and, um, people are, or, or iOS or Android, you have Linux and,

35:03.560 --> 35:09.540
you know, all of this open source, all this tech and all of that fundamental Unix goodness,

35:09.540 --> 35:14.960
the design and the, the core programs that have since been rewritten with the GNU project

35:14.960 --> 35:19.400
and all this stuff, they're all living on everybody's computer. They may not be interacting

35:19.400 --> 35:23.840
with it directly, but they're all still there. And that's, that's such a cool, that's such

35:23.840 --> 35:30.160
a cool thing. I find it really cool and fascinating, but at the same time, there's a hint of like,

35:30.160 --> 35:35.040
it's a bit tragic in some ways because it, it doesn't often get celebrated in the ways

35:35.040 --> 35:41.560
that perhaps it, it should, you know, uh, maybe it's unfair to expect every single computer

35:41.560 --> 35:45.800
user to want to celebrate, you know, the, the simplest of tools, uh, that make everything

35:45.800 --> 35:51.120
run. But, uh, wouldn't it be great if we could just all say, thanks. I totally agree with

35:51.120 --> 35:55.440
you. I mean, and I think, you know, when I, when I started doing this project, you know,

35:55.440 --> 36:00.680
I think that was really one of the driving forces for me behind the project more, you

36:00.680 --> 36:05.280
know, in addition to the personal interest of just meeting a lot of these pioneers that

36:05.280 --> 36:10.360
have developed this was, you know, how do I get, how do we get this story out there?

36:10.360 --> 36:18.200
Right. Because without all of this technology and without all, all of the software specifically,

36:18.200 --> 36:22.920
you know, most of which is open source at this point, we wouldn't have any of this stuff

36:22.920 --> 36:29.460
that we're, we're relying on now. And, and you're absolutely right that most people don't

36:29.460 --> 36:36.040
know it's there. They don't know that they're every time they log into a website, they're

36:36.040 --> 36:41.540
relying not just on the open source nature of the web, the protocols that run the web,

36:41.540 --> 36:47.640
but they're using hundreds of open source programs. Every time the page is rendered,

36:47.640 --> 36:52.120
you know, there's hundreds of open source programs, you know, you know, tens of thousands

36:52.120 --> 36:57.600
of lines of code, you know, at work, open source code at work, bringing that webpage

36:57.600 --> 37:05.080
to them, pulling down that next email you know transferring that file, you know, up,

37:05.080 --> 37:10.760
you know, to, to, to the cloud. All of that is open source. And without that, you know,

37:10.760 --> 37:16.680
this would be a, we'd be in a very different world, right? Oh yeah. I really felt like

37:16.680 --> 37:22.860
it was important to get that story out there. And, and my thinking is, you know, as a photographer,

37:22.860 --> 37:29.440
what can I do? I can try to bring that story to life through photography and, and specifically

37:29.440 --> 37:35.000
through the people, you know, and the human, the humans behind all this amazing code and,

37:35.000 --> 37:40.120
and put that on display so that people realize, Hey, all this, I am relying on this. This

37:40.120 --> 37:46.800
is an amazing phenomenon that has, that, that is responsible for getting us to where we're

37:46.800 --> 37:50.840
at today. And it should be celebrated. It should be acknowledged and celebrated. And,

37:50.840 --> 37:55.160
and hopefully the photography, you know, helps do that. That's, that's, that's the goal of

37:55.160 --> 38:00.880
the project at this point. Yeah. It's your way of giving back with the gifts that you

38:00.880 --> 38:07.720
have to open source, which is a really beautiful thing. Yeah, totally. And so I wanted to jump

38:07.720 --> 38:11.960
back to your history a little bit. You were, you were driving us through, you know, a little

38:11.960 --> 38:17.800
bit of your history early with some of the Unix stuff. And I know that a lot of that

38:17.800 --> 38:24.120
leads into your discovering open source. So I wanted to kind of, if you can walk us through

38:24.120 --> 38:29.240
that a little bit more. So you were just telling us, you know, that you were discovering Unix

38:29.240 --> 38:36.840
and playing with email, you know, the deep depths of email. I was on the VAX sending

38:36.840 --> 38:45.880
email to Dartmouth. You know, I got very interested in the internet, just being able to transfer

38:45.880 --> 38:52.040
information and being able to disseminate information. And, you know, I started to discover

38:52.040 --> 38:57.160
this thing called Usenet, which is, you know, again, most people today, you know, wouldn't

38:57.160 --> 39:00.920
know what that was if they're just kind of getting familiar with the internet. But, you

39:00.920 --> 39:08.920
know, essentially the, you know, worldwide discussion, you know, news system, you know,

39:09.480 --> 39:13.880
with topics on everything in the world, sort of the precursor to the web, if you will.

39:15.000 --> 39:25.800
And I started discovering that. And then this thing called NCSA Mosaic showed up. And I

39:25.800 --> 39:32.840
immediately saw, wow, this is really interesting. And the first time I saw it, and the first time

39:32.840 --> 39:39.160
I saw a webpage, I thought, oh, this is going to be a great way to show my photography.

39:42.760 --> 39:48.280
So I was like, oh, this is great. I can't wait to put my photography up on a webpage because

39:48.280 --> 39:53.320
up until that point, you know, I mean, and you know this, you know, if you wanted to share your

39:53.320 --> 40:01.160
photography with somebody, you're in the darkroom making prints for people. And the way that I

40:01.160 --> 40:06.840
print, you know, and used to print and print today, even still, is it's very elaborate.

40:06.840 --> 40:12.120
But back then in the darkroom, it's not about just putting the paper underneath and exposing,

40:12.120 --> 40:16.520
you know, exposing the paper and, you know, out comes the print like you're at a drugstore

40:16.520 --> 40:22.600
getting a print done. You know, it's an involved process of dodging and burning and manipulating

40:22.600 --> 40:27.400
the light as it comes out of the enlarger and doing contrast masks and, you know, all the stuff

40:27.400 --> 40:32.440
today that you do in Photoshop, doing that on an analog way, waving your hand in front of the light.

40:33.000 --> 40:41.000
And you could never, I could never really truly get prints, you know, two prints to be identical.

40:41.000 --> 40:45.800
I mean, you would try, you would write down your instructions, but it would take a phenomenally

40:45.800 --> 40:50.120
long time. And every print was kind of a one of a kind piece of art. So if you wanted to

40:50.120 --> 40:55.240
give a print to somebody, that was a big deal. If you wanted to share your photography and show it

40:55.240 --> 41:00.040
to somebody, you had to print it out. And wow, that could be an elaborate, really time consuming

41:00.040 --> 41:06.440
process. So here comes the web and I'm thinking, great, I'll just scan in the print and I'll make

41:06.440 --> 41:12.280
a webpage and I can just send the webpage to people and they can look at my photography that

41:12.280 --> 41:15.320
way. And I was like, this is going to be the greatest thing in the world.

41:15.320 --> 41:22.040
You were right. So I started talking to some friends about it and they're like,

41:22.040 --> 41:27.880
wow, we could do a lot of cool stuff with this. We could like, you know, provide information,

41:27.880 --> 41:35.560
you know, poetry and writing. And we kind of got the idea to do a little magazine,

41:36.200 --> 41:42.120
sort of like a student magazine. I was at that point doing photography for the newspaper

41:42.120 --> 41:49.160
periodically as well, being photo geek. But, you know, we thought, well, we could get the,

41:49.160 --> 41:54.600
we could get a whole magazine up on the web and we could get submissions from all of our friends

41:54.600 --> 41:59.960
at other colleges via email, because now that we know how to use that, they could just send

41:59.960 --> 42:05.080
in writing periodically and we could then publish this thing on the web. And, you know, I look back

42:05.080 --> 42:08.920
on that now and I'm like, wow, that was like, you know, maybe one of the best ideas I ever had at

42:08.920 --> 42:12.760
that point in time. It sounds kind of bold too at the time, right? Yeah. At that point in time.

42:13.320 --> 42:17.800
And we developed this, this little magazine that went up on the, that was the first

42:17.800 --> 42:25.960
magazine on the web. That's awesome. And we would get contributions from all over the internet and

42:25.960 --> 42:30.760
we would publish this on, sometimes we put our photography up and sometimes it would be, you

42:30.760 --> 42:37.160
know, reported stories from journalists, students, and, you know, it would just be a mix of different

42:37.160 --> 42:42.440
things and we're having a good time with it. And, you know, all this while I'm figuring, well, I'm

42:42.440 --> 42:49.080
going to, I'm going to graduate from college and go back to New York and maybe I can get a job

42:49.080 --> 42:53.720
assisting somebody and, you know, start my photography career. So like the traditional

42:53.720 --> 42:59.640
photography path, I suppose, right? Yeah. I mean, I think that was, that was always in the back of

42:59.640 --> 43:04.520
my mind was, you know, I want to have my own studio. I want to live in a loft and be a photographer

43:04.520 --> 43:11.800
and, you know, you know, go down that, that New York city photographer path. But I, one day I got

43:11.800 --> 43:20.680
an email from out of the blue from this guy who was the head of an ad agency in Silicon Valley,

43:21.240 --> 43:26.840
a guy by the name of Dave Karlik, who's a dear friend now. And it's been a mentor to me since,

43:26.840 --> 43:35.080
since that first email. And he wrote me saying, Hey, I saw, you know, some of my guys sent around

43:35.080 --> 43:41.000
this magazine that you're doing. We're an internet, we're an ad agency that does all

43:41.000 --> 43:48.280
the internet work for the white house and Netscape and, you know, Chrysler. And, you know, this is in

43:48.280 --> 43:54.840
sort of the mid nineties when nobody had a website, everybody was trying to get on board. And he was

43:54.840 --> 44:01.800
in Silicon Valley and it was a small agency. It was a small sort of cutting edge boutique agency

44:01.800 --> 44:09.720
that was doing all of this really early web work. It's an agency called Poppy Tyson. And he said,

44:09.720 --> 44:13.400
you know, we have, you know, this group in Silicon Valley doing this, but you know,

44:13.400 --> 44:18.920
you're in New York and I want to set up a whole New York operation. You know, can you come in and,

44:18.920 --> 44:26.680
you know, can we talk? Wow. And so I go to go in New York, I go in for this interview and

44:27.640 --> 44:33.000
we're talking and he's like, okay, show me your, you know, show me your, show me your website.

44:33.000 --> 44:36.920
And of course, you know, I couldn't, you know, of course, you know, anytime you're doing a live demo,

44:36.920 --> 44:41.240
you can't get anything to work. So of course, yeah, I couldn't, I couldn't pull up the website.

44:41.240 --> 44:46.040
So I'm just, oh no. Right. So I'm just like describing it to him and I'm like, this is what

44:46.040 --> 44:50.280
it is. And this is how it is. And, you know, we'll look at it later, but, you know, for some reason

44:50.280 --> 44:55.400
we can't get it on the computer anyway. So he's like, well, this is really great. He's like,

44:55.400 --> 44:59.960
you know, I want to hire you to come in and do all this interactive stuff. And, you know,

44:59.960 --> 45:04.040
you're an ad agency and it's this creative environment and, you know, I think you really

45:04.040 --> 45:10.840
love it. And I was like, oh my God, wow. Somebody wants to pay me to do creative work on this new

45:10.840 --> 45:15.080
platform called the internet, which is like going to be, you know, at that point I was just like,

45:15.080 --> 45:19.720
this is going to be the biggest thing in the world. And I was like, absolutely, this sounds,

45:19.720 --> 45:26.600
this sounds great. And so I, you know, I went for an interview there when, you know, I thought,

45:26.600 --> 45:32.440
well, maybe I should interview somewhere else. And I had gotten another email from the guys at

45:32.440 --> 45:38.600
time at a time ink, cause they were an early, they had an early internet presence. And I,

45:38.600 --> 45:43.240
I went into interview there and I didn't really like, you know, I didn't really like the,

45:43.240 --> 45:49.320
the folks over there as much as, as Poppy Tyson and, and I'm working for Dave. And so I

45:50.120 --> 45:55.000
took this job working for, for Poppy Tyson, doing this early internet work in the early

45:55.000 --> 46:04.840
nineties. And that just took me on this, this whole different trajectory. And I spent 20 years doing

46:04.840 --> 46:11.960
internet tech ventures and photography was kind of on, on the side where I could fit it in.

46:11.960 --> 46:17.240
And so I, I described to my, you know, and that was up until, you know, a little over 10 years ago,

46:17.240 --> 46:22.200
I decided it was time to get back to photography. So I always joke to people that photography is my

46:22.200 --> 46:30.600
first love and, and second career having spent, you know, 20 years doing start internet and

46:30.600 --> 46:37.560
technology startups in, in New York and Silicon Valley. And that's really where I got really

46:37.560 --> 46:43.320
inundated with open source. That's really, you know, kind of the first, the, my first exposure

46:43.320 --> 46:51.000
to open source was, was after I left Poppy Tyson, I, I, in the, the heyday of the.com bubble,

46:52.280 --> 46:59.560
I had started a company, you know, that did, you know, analytics, web analytics, very similar to a

46:59.560 --> 47:04.840
cert, you know, sort of a, an online SAS service, very similar to what Google, Google has now with

47:04.840 --> 47:09.960
Google analytics. It sounds like you were a bit earlier than they were. Yeah. Way, way earlier

47:09.960 --> 47:15.400
than Google. No, there was no Google at that point. And it was in the sort of heyday of the bubble.

47:15.400 --> 47:20.760
And we raised a bunch of money and, you know, this was going to be, you know, this big,

47:20.760 --> 47:26.280
this big thing. And I was really into, you know, the data and how people were using these websites.

47:26.280 --> 47:30.360
And that was really fascinating to me. So we started this company and we're trying to get

47:30.360 --> 47:35.560
this thing off the ground. And yeah, this was in 99, you know, literally like, couldn't have been

47:35.560 --> 47:39.880
like, it was the best timing to raise a bunch of money, but then it was the worst timing in the

47:39.880 --> 47:45.880
world to operate a company. And, you know, there was no cloud, there was no nothing. I mean, to

47:45.880 --> 47:52.280
get these businesses off the ground back then, you literally needed tens of millions of dollars in,

47:52.280 --> 47:57.960
in capital to purchase hardware, stick it in a data center. I mean, luckily at that point,

47:57.960 --> 48:03.080
the co-location model of co-locating, instead of building out your own data center,

48:03.080 --> 48:08.200
you could just rent some space and co-locate your equipment in someone else's data center.

48:08.200 --> 48:12.840
So luckily, like we didn't need, you know, a hundred million dollars to build a data center

48:12.840 --> 48:18.840
network. We could just co-locate, but you still needed tens of millions of dollars to purchase

48:18.840 --> 48:27.400
storage from EMC and servers from Sun and database licenses from Oracle and, you know, all of this,

48:27.400 --> 48:33.320
this huge iron to, to crunch these numbers and to do data processing at that point.

48:33.320 --> 48:38.120
So we raised this money and we purchased all this equipment. And then when the

48:38.120 --> 48:42.920
dot com bubble burst and we needed to raise more money, you know, we couldn't and, you know,

48:42.920 --> 48:49.320
we kind of wound up having to sell, sell the business which we, we, we wound up doing that

48:49.320 --> 48:55.800
and sold it to a company called a search engine, ironically enough called LookSmart out in San

48:55.800 --> 49:01.320
Francisco. But you know, the, the, the funny story I always tell about my first exposure to open

49:01.320 --> 49:08.040
source was while we're building this web analytics company, we, we purchased all this big iron from

49:08.040 --> 49:13.400
Sun. We purchased literally like this thing that looks like, you know, I mean, I'm sure you've

49:13.400 --> 49:18.440
seen Star Wars or, you know, those movies or any of the Star Wars movies, they all have the same

49:18.440 --> 49:24.760
thing where, where Obi-Wan Kenobi goes and like has to shut off the, the, you know, force field

49:24.760 --> 49:29.320
of the Death Star so that Luke Skywalker and the crew can come in and blow it up.

49:30.120 --> 49:35.640
And he goes out on like, you know, this parapet and there's this big like monolith thing and he's

49:35.640 --> 49:42.040
got to pull these latches, you know, on like four sides and it's this hulking like tower.

49:42.840 --> 49:47.560
Yeah. We had, we, we had to buy one of those, you know, I always joke like that's what we had to

49:47.560 --> 49:52.280
buy to run that business. Did you have a Death Star to put it into as well? It was literally,

49:52.280 --> 49:56.520
it looked like a Death Star. It looked like the control panel of the Death Star. It was this

49:56.520 --> 50:04.600
Sun's biggest computer, their E-10K, its infamous computer. It was so big. It required a forklift to

50:04.600 --> 50:09.640
get it into the, you know, the, the data center. And, you know, it was just massive and we bought

50:09.640 --> 50:15.480
it because, you know, it was like at that point, you know, running lots of small computers and,

50:15.480 --> 50:23.720
and clustering them, you know, wasn't as, you know, that wasn't an obvious, easy pattern to

50:23.720 --> 50:29.080
use at that point. It was much easier for us to just have one big computer with lots of CPUs.

50:29.720 --> 50:35.160
So we decided we would buy this big computer, lots of CPUs and we'd run Oracle on it. And

50:36.040 --> 50:42.120
Oracle had promised through their software, they had that their database, you could do,

50:42.120 --> 50:48.520
you could run a query across multiple CPUs, this product they had called Oracle parallel query,

50:48.520 --> 50:52.200
which probably cost us 50 grand just to purchase the license for that thing.

50:52.200 --> 50:52.840
Oh man.

50:53.960 --> 50:57.720
In hindsight, it's all so funny. I'm just shaking my head as I tell this story.

50:58.520 --> 51:02.680
You know, we're thinking, oh, great. That's, that's how we're going to get the throughput

51:02.680 --> 51:08.840
we need for these data warehousing queries is we'll run this Oracle, you know, software across

51:08.840 --> 51:13.240
all this multiple CPUs and this big sun box. And we'll have enough power to do all the data

51:13.240 --> 51:15.160
warehousing queries we need to do to run the business.

51:15.720 --> 51:20.040
That must've seemed pretty exciting at the time. Cause it sounds like you're combining some pretty

51:20.040 --> 51:23.400
high tech of the time, right? Is that the feeling you got?

51:23.400 --> 51:28.520
It was, it was, it was super exciting. I mean, you know, to be able to put all this tech to work and,

51:28.520 --> 51:33.720
you know, in service of, of running a, what was, you know, would later be called

51:33.720 --> 51:40.040
SaaS, a SaaS product, you know, instead of like shipping people CDs and having them install it,

51:40.040 --> 51:43.880
we would run all the hardware and they would just ship us. The data would come to us and we would

51:43.880 --> 51:48.200
do all the processing on our end. So it was like a, it was a lot of new stuff. It was like a whole

51:48.200 --> 51:52.840
new world of the internet. It was a whole new world of, of analyzing websites, all sorts of

51:52.840 --> 51:58.520
new technology. And we were so excited and we had all this money from venture capitalists and all

51:58.520 --> 52:04.120
this stuff. And we get all this stuff in the data center and we install the software and

52:04.840 --> 52:08.920
we start running it through its paces and we just can't get it to work.

52:10.520 --> 52:16.680
It's just the Oracle software, just, it won't use more than one CPU per query.

52:16.680 --> 52:19.560
So the promise they've made isn't coming true.

52:19.560 --> 52:24.680
The promise they made is not coming true. And of course, you know, we've paid more money than

52:24.680 --> 52:30.440
God for a support contract. So, you know, our, my CTO is on the phone and we're trying to work with

52:30.440 --> 52:36.920
them and we escalated and escalated and escalated through their system. And, and ultimately it just

52:36.920 --> 52:41.640
comes back to like, yeah, that's a bug. That's a bug. We're, we're going to have to get a fix for

52:41.640 --> 52:46.920
that, you know, out to you. And we're like, okay, great. When, when can we expect, you know, how many

52:46.920 --> 52:52.520
days will that take? And they're like, Oh no, no, no, no, no, no. We're not talking that's the wrong

52:52.520 --> 52:58.200
days is not the right metric, you know, the right, the right way to measure this, you know,

52:58.200 --> 53:03.640
like, Oh no, this will come out in the next release cycle. And, you know, that could be,

53:04.280 --> 53:08.200
you know, weeks, it could be, it could be months. And we're like, what, you know, like,

53:08.200 --> 53:13.480
are you kidding me? Like we've got our whole stack is you guys promised us this would work.

53:13.480 --> 53:17.560
And we bought all this stuff. And, you know, of course we're just like this naive, you know,

53:17.560 --> 53:20.840
group of 20 somethings trying to make this all make all this work.

53:20.840 --> 53:24.680
But it sounds like your business was sort of relying on that function.

53:24.680 --> 53:29.320
We're like, Jesus, what are we going to do? Like we're, we're kind of screwed on this now.

53:30.120 --> 53:34.920
So my CTO is like, okay, look, this isn't going to work. We're not going to be able,

53:34.920 --> 53:38.440
we're going to have to use the Oracle database differently. We're going to have to do the data

53:38.440 --> 53:44.200
processing off of this thing. You know, I've started experimenting with this thing called Linux.

53:44.200 --> 53:48.840
And I think we could just get some, you know, at this point we'd spend all our money on the C 10 K.

53:48.840 --> 53:49.160
Right.

53:49.160 --> 53:53.480
So we're like, okay, well we could just get some really inexpensive computers

53:54.040 --> 53:59.240
and try to use Linux in a cluster to do the data processing.

53:59.240 --> 54:04.440
When he first suggested it to that seem like kind of depressing because you've, you know,

54:04.440 --> 54:08.520
focused all your attention on this dream product and here you are maybe putting together a few,

54:08.520 --> 54:12.680
like it's, it sounds like clearly lesser computers.

54:12.680 --> 54:16.280
Well, if you know, it was more like, Oh my God, I hope that works.

54:16.280 --> 54:21.800
Right. It was more like, Oh, I, my fingers are crossed. Like, you know, this is,

54:21.800 --> 54:26.440
this is of course also like, I'm like, well, how much is Linux going to cost us? You know, and

54:26.440 --> 54:30.280
you know, all this and he's like, no, no, no. Linux is Linux is free. It's, it's open source.

54:30.280 --> 54:34.120
And you know, we don't have to pay for that. And I'm like, Oh, okay. I'm like, but is it going to

54:34.120 --> 54:40.280
work? You know, it's a, it's a valid question. Right. And his answer to me and, you know,

54:40.280 --> 54:45.720
I'll never forget it was, you know, if it doesn't, we can fix it. And I was like, Oh, right. I'm like,

54:45.720 --> 54:52.040
right, right. Cause we're screwed waiting for Oracle here. And so that's what we did. We,

54:52.040 --> 54:58.680
we bought a bunch of, you know, commodity, you know, com you know, commodity computers

54:59.400 --> 55:06.360
and Intel computers and we ran Linux on it, you know, and, and we did our data processing that

55:06.360 --> 55:14.600
way. And we, we used one CPU at a time in this big hulking desk star of a, of a sun computer for,

55:14.600 --> 55:20.920
for running the, for, for the database. And, you know, the, the ironic thing about that entire

55:20.920 --> 55:27.000
experience as, as kind of crazy and depressing as it was, as we're, you know, as the bubble is

55:27.000 --> 55:31.880
bursting all around us and we're realizing, God, you know, we've like, you know, we, we can't raise

55:31.880 --> 55:36.760
more money for the business and, you know, it's costing hundreds of thousands of dollars a month

55:36.760 --> 55:40.920
to run, you know, we're going to have to, we're going to have to sell the, sell the company and,

55:40.920 --> 55:45.960
you know, you know, you know, because of the.com had had burst at the, the bubble had burst at

55:45.960 --> 55:52.600
that point. And I remember we're, we're, it was the last couple of days of closing down our office,

55:52.600 --> 55:58.520
which was down on wall street. And we're just, you know, kind of tidying everything up and,

55:58.520 --> 56:01.720
you know, getting the space right, you know, getting all of our stuff out of the space.

56:02.520 --> 56:09.720
And this FedEx guy comes and, and starts knocking on the door. And I'm like, Oh, I wonder what this

56:09.720 --> 56:13.560
is, you know, like, I wonder who's, you know, we haven't ordered anything, you know, we're like

56:13.560 --> 56:18.280
days away from just turning out the lights on this office. Cause we had sold the company to,

56:18.280 --> 56:23.080
to look smart in San Francisco and all the operations were moving out to San Francisco.

56:23.080 --> 56:28.840
And I'm like, Oh, what's this? I wonder what this FedEx is. And I go and I sign for the FedEx and,

56:28.840 --> 56:39.640
and I open it and it's literally a 25 CD-ROM patch kit from Oracle with the, with the fix

56:40.760 --> 56:45.640
for the parallel server bug that we had filed eight months before.

56:47.240 --> 56:49.400
Well, it did come as they promised.

56:50.280 --> 56:56.440
It finally came, you know, it was like, it was like so little, so late, so irrelevant,

56:56.440 --> 57:03.240
like we had moved on so far beyond that, but it was just so ironic that here we are, like,

57:03.240 --> 57:08.520
we couldn't get the tech to work. We're waiting and waiting. We have to give up on it. We go to

57:08.520 --> 57:14.040
open source. And like one of the last days of the history of the company, eight months too late,

57:14.040 --> 57:19.800
the bug fix comes from the commercial software provider. And I just remember thinking I'm

57:19.800 --> 57:24.200
holding this stuff in my hand right before I threw it in the garbage. And I'm saying to myself,

57:24.200 --> 57:31.960
I will never, ever one make, you know, buy Oracle software again, but two, I just won't ever make

57:31.960 --> 57:37.720
that mistake to be beholden to a commercial software vendor for running, for running anything

57:37.720 --> 57:44.360
on my business because you literally, you can, you could go bankrupt. Like it could bankrupt you. It

57:44.360 --> 57:50.760
could be like the fatal flaw in your technology stack. And you could then be, you know, completely

57:50.760 --> 57:56.040
handcuffed on dealing with it. And that was a hard lesson to learn. You know, it all worked

57:56.040 --> 58:01.960
out in the end. We sold the company and it was all fine, but wow, what a lesson. And that was

58:01.960 --> 58:07.800
the beginning of, you know, another 15 years of running everything on open source, every venture

58:07.800 --> 58:14.280
I ever did, every company I ever worked for after that, it was all open source and, you know, me

58:14.280 --> 58:19.000
convincing people, no, we're not going to renew that Oracle license. No, we're not going to buy

58:19.000 --> 58:25.320
more sun equipment, you know, and it was like, I was like Dr. No for 10 years in these companies,

58:25.880 --> 58:31.400
getting people weaned off of this commercial proprietary software, you know, and into,

58:31.400 --> 58:35.560
into using open source. So that was, that was how I got into it. That was my, that was my,

58:37.000 --> 58:39.320
that was my indoctrination by fire, if you will.

58:41.160 --> 58:47.400
What a powerful moment and turning point for you. Right. And I could see why it's such a deep part

58:47.400 --> 58:56.040
of you now in trying to both celebrate it and, and, and sharing it with others. That's an amazing

58:56.040 --> 59:02.040
story. Well, listeners, we're going to take a tiny break here for now. Stay tuned for part two

59:02.040 --> 59:06.920
coming later this week, where Peter and I explore more topics like open source photography workflows,

59:06.920 --> 59:21.480
artificial intelligence, and the future of photography.
