00:00.000 --> 00:06.860
Well, we got something special because elementary OS 6.1 landed yesterday and Danielle Fore is

00:06.860 --> 00:07.860
joining us.

00:07.860 --> 00:09.700
Danny, welcome to the show.

00:09.700 --> 00:12.740
And it sounds like it's more than just a number.

00:12.740 --> 00:14.060
There's a lot in 6.1.

00:14.060 --> 00:19.940
Yeah, it's actually, you know, I think it's the most we've ever packed into a point release

00:19.940 --> 00:21.920
in a short amount of time.

00:21.920 --> 00:27.460
Like our release blog post for this point release is nearly exactly as long as our original

00:27.460 --> 00:30.360
release post for like the 6.0 proper.

00:30.360 --> 00:31.360
OK, help me.

00:31.360 --> 00:32.920
How do I say the name?

00:32.920 --> 00:35.200
Is it Jolner?

00:35.200 --> 00:38.040
So that's the fun part is none of us know how to pronounce it correctly.

00:38.040 --> 00:42.680
I think it's like Yulnir, like Yuletide, I think, maybe.

00:42.680 --> 00:45.140
OK, I should have gone that you're right, right?

00:45.140 --> 00:46.140
I should have gone that direction.

00:46.140 --> 00:47.140
You're right.

00:47.140 --> 00:48.140
That's obvious when I think about it.

00:48.140 --> 00:49.300
OK, so what happened?

00:49.300 --> 00:51.260
Why is dot one just loaded up with stuff?

00:51.260 --> 00:55.500
Is it things that were kind of on track for dot o and just didn't quite make it?

00:55.500 --> 01:01.000
Well, I mean, we've got a ton of feedback from people from the release of OS six.

01:01.000 --> 01:04.320
And so one of the big things that we like to concentrate on is, you know, wrapping up

01:04.320 --> 01:08.080
all that feedback and trying to address the things that people have told us like as soon

01:08.080 --> 01:09.080
as possible.

01:09.080 --> 01:14.260
But we've also, you know, been really revamping a lot of our processes like internally and

01:14.260 --> 01:17.140
taking more of a project management approach to things.

01:17.140 --> 01:22.000
So we've gotten like a really good system for kicking out new updates and just really

01:22.000 --> 01:25.860
prioritizing things and just getting features hammered out.

01:25.860 --> 01:27.060
Mm hmm.

01:27.060 --> 01:28.060
That sounds great.

01:28.060 --> 01:30.740
Like so some internal improvements that have just led to a more streamlined development

01:30.740 --> 01:31.820
process.

01:31.820 --> 01:33.660
And this is sort of the fruits of that labor.

01:33.660 --> 01:34.660
Exactly.

01:34.660 --> 01:35.660
Oh, that's great.

01:35.660 --> 01:36.660
Congratulations.

01:36.660 --> 01:40.100
That sounds like that's going to be an investment that'll, you know, pay dividends for a while.

01:40.100 --> 01:48.140
I know a lot of people had mixed opinions on the available apps at launch of OS six,

01:48.140 --> 01:51.060
but it sounds like now there's over 90 curated apps in the App Center, at least.

01:51.060 --> 01:54.180
And things are coming along and now there's is there also a flat hub integration as well?

01:54.180 --> 01:55.180
Yes.

01:55.180 --> 02:01.260
So as of this morning, we have 97 apps approved in App Center with a few more in the queue.

02:01.260 --> 02:07.940
And then kind of what we've done is we've worked really hard to make sure that people

02:07.940 --> 02:15.300
know that sideloading is like expected and an important part of the flow and like show

02:15.300 --> 02:20.020
them in our welcome map and on App Center if they like get a search result that doesn't

02:20.020 --> 02:23.820
return anything, like let them know that, like, hey, you know, all these flat packs

02:23.820 --> 02:28.240
on flat hub are compatible with elementary OS and you can easily just go download them

02:28.240 --> 02:30.780
and double click and install like anything you want.

02:30.780 --> 02:36.600
So even if something is even if somebody doesn't publish their app in our store, like you still

02:36.600 --> 02:41.500
have the complete open availability to download these apps for Linux.

02:41.500 --> 02:43.140
That's I mean, that's what people love to hear, right?

02:43.140 --> 02:45.900
They want to know that's going to be the case.

02:45.900 --> 02:48.020
This is sort of an odd one to talk to you about.

02:48.020 --> 02:53.660
But it struck me like a lot of times when you get a new update to how something as fundamental

02:53.660 --> 02:59.780
as alt tab behavior works, it's it's honestly like it's really glitzy, right?

02:59.780 --> 03:00.780
It does a lot.

03:00.780 --> 03:06.580
But you guys have almost kind of simplified the alt tab process now in a little bit.

03:06.580 --> 03:10.860
Tell me about that, because it's kind of gone from a very visual swapping where you could

03:10.860 --> 03:15.180
tell what the active application was by watching the doc.

03:15.180 --> 03:16.620
And now it's something a lot simpler.

03:16.620 --> 03:21.260
You know, when we first designed the alt tab switcher, we kind of had all these things

03:21.260 --> 03:25.360
about like, you know, well, let's throw everything out the window and like come up with something

03:25.360 --> 03:31.380
really unique and different and like what, you know, could we possibly do with like the

03:31.380 --> 03:33.700
tools that we have?

03:33.700 --> 03:38.780
And over the past several years, really, we've got a lot of feedback from different people

03:38.780 --> 03:44.240
that they didn't really like the solution we came up with and that the animations were

03:44.240 --> 03:49.340
too flashy and can be disruptive and didn't really fit into how most people actually use

03:49.340 --> 03:50.980
those kind of switchers.

03:50.980 --> 03:53.960
So we tried to gather up a lot of feedback.

03:53.960 --> 03:57.240
We worked with a bunch of members from the community.

03:57.240 --> 04:05.700
We even got design input from somebody who does some UX work for like Google services

04:05.700 --> 04:11.040
that was just happened to be like in the community and wanted to give their thoughts.

04:11.040 --> 04:16.240
And so we came back to this like really just simple switcher that was like, you know what,

04:16.240 --> 04:18.380
this is this is what the people want.

04:18.380 --> 04:19.740
You know, they don't want the flash.

04:19.740 --> 04:20.800
They don't want the whiz bang.

04:20.800 --> 04:23.700
They want just the thing that does the thing.

04:23.700 --> 04:26.860
And so that's you know, that's what we did is give the people what they want.

04:26.860 --> 04:29.280
I mean, it's not a common approach.

04:29.280 --> 04:30.820
Usually it's more glitz, more glamour.

04:30.820 --> 04:32.860
But this one, it's it's back to the basics.

04:32.860 --> 04:34.680
But I think it works really well.

04:34.680 --> 04:39.540
And is it accurate to say that six dot one is really the release where the dark style

04:39.540 --> 04:42.640
is fully implemented and looking good now?

04:42.640 --> 04:43.640
Yeah.

04:43.640 --> 04:46.840
So, you know, when we first implemented the dark style as something that was very specific

04:46.840 --> 04:51.520
to how it was working on elementary OS, but we've been working a lot with three desktop

04:51.520 --> 04:53.960
and the gnome community in particular.

04:53.960 --> 04:57.920
And so the version of the dark style they're shipping right now is compatible with the

04:57.920 --> 05:00.120
new free desktop standard.

05:00.120 --> 05:04.400
So apps that are built for gnome 42 will be compatible with it.

05:04.400 --> 05:10.680
And I believe the upcoming KD version, I can't remember the version number of KD that's going

05:10.680 --> 05:11.680
to be compatible with it.

05:11.680 --> 05:17.080
But it's it's like something that's going to work for every app you get from everywhere.

05:17.080 --> 05:21.120
And like right now, it doesn't necessarily support that because people are still updating.

05:21.120 --> 05:24.960
But like we're there, we're ready for the next generation of, you know, that free desktop

05:24.960 --> 05:25.960
spec.

05:25.960 --> 05:26.960
I love that.

05:26.960 --> 05:32.000
It means it works across gnome, it works across elementary apps and sounds like future plasma

05:32.000 --> 05:33.000
apps, too.

05:33.000 --> 05:34.000
That's that's good.

05:34.000 --> 05:37.440
But now that it's, you know, a free desktop spec that we can get buying in from electron

05:37.440 --> 05:41.200
and maybe from, you know, Google and Mozilla and stuff like that, too.

05:41.200 --> 05:42.200
Yeah, right.

05:42.200 --> 05:46.120
I mean, hopefully, you know, I'm looking through some of this stuff.

05:46.120 --> 05:50.600
And it's like a lot of really nice stuff to see some stuff around display scaling.

05:50.600 --> 05:54.560
And she's that that whole UI around that looks so great.

05:54.560 --> 05:59.320
But the burning question really, when it comes to that area in our chat room is, what are

05:59.320 --> 06:02.000
your thoughts about whaling down the road?

06:02.000 --> 06:07.080
Because it's, it's, you know, near and near is the groundwork being laid for that?

06:07.080 --> 06:12.560
Or are you looking at kind of what needs to happen to make that transition or things more

06:12.560 --> 06:13.960
further along than I realize?

06:13.960 --> 06:14.960
Yeah, absolutely.

06:14.960 --> 06:18.380
Like we've had a whaling project up for a while and kind of just like picking issues

06:18.380 --> 06:20.080
off it here and there.

06:20.080 --> 06:24.940
But we really are trying to make whaling a big goal for OS seven.

06:24.940 --> 06:32.080
And Cassidy actually has been doing a UI study recently related to some components that we

06:32.080 --> 06:35.540
need to rewrite to work properly with Wayland.

06:35.540 --> 06:42.000
So we're really like, aiming for first class Wayland support when the next release, that's

06:42.000 --> 06:43.000
a huge goal for us.

06:43.000 --> 06:46.880
And then this last kind of question I have that's an area I don't, I don't really understand

06:46.880 --> 06:51.240
because honestly, some of the aspects of flash packs still kind of are complicated to me.

06:51.240 --> 06:57.540
But is there now an elementary OS flat pack platform based on the six one release now

06:57.540 --> 07:03.320
that that can be used as a flat pack platform for others to build and distribute apps on

07:03.320 --> 07:04.320
now?

07:04.320 --> 07:05.320
Yeah, yeah, that's great.

07:05.320 --> 07:11.640
So when we redid our app center completely based around flat back for OS six, we had

07:11.640 --> 07:17.080
a flat pack runtime, there are six versions, and now we have a 6.1 version out.

07:17.080 --> 07:20.540
But yeah, developers can build their apps against the elementary runtime.

07:20.540 --> 07:22.720
And that's what we use an app center.

07:22.720 --> 07:28.760
And you know, it's built off of the free desktop SDK and the gnome SDK.

07:28.760 --> 07:31.320
So it's compatible, you know, across other distros.

07:31.320 --> 07:34.440
So if you write your app against the elementary runtime, you know, you could download the

07:34.440 --> 07:36.400
flat pack and run it on whatever distribution.

07:36.400 --> 07:43.180
Okay, so if I'm following you, it's sort of like when you do a major update, now, there's

07:43.180 --> 07:46.200
going to be a update to the flat pack platform as well.

07:46.200 --> 07:47.200
Yeah, that's right.

07:47.200 --> 07:50.880
Because it contains, you know, all the libraries that we're building against and like the latest

07:50.880 --> 07:54.920
versions of granite and our style sheet and like, you know, all the little utility functions

07:54.920 --> 07:57.120
for the latest HP eyes and everything.

07:57.120 --> 08:00.680
Okay, that's okay, then I got a random one for you.

08:00.680 --> 08:08.080
Because I know that there are six 64 bit arm versions of a lot of the apps in the app center.

08:08.080 --> 08:10.700
And I know you guys tested on like the pine book and stuff like that.

08:10.700 --> 08:16.080
But now I've got I've got a generic arm 64 box, I just want to run elementary on is that

08:16.080 --> 08:17.400
going to be something that's doable soon?

08:17.400 --> 08:21.440
Like, will there just be an arm ISO that people will be able to download in the future?

08:21.440 --> 08:26.800
Yeah, so right now, if you go to build stop elementary.io, we have arm images and early

08:26.800 --> 08:27.800
access.

08:27.800 --> 08:34.440
So you can download and test those out, we're still kind of ironing out a crude good kernel

08:34.440 --> 08:39.600
that we can like know that it's well supported so that we can have like an officially well

08:39.600 --> 08:41.580
supported release.

08:41.580 --> 08:45.600
But that is available in early access for you to play around with the caveat that you

08:45.600 --> 08:47.920
know that, you know, it's it's still kind of experimental.

08:47.920 --> 08:48.920
Yeah, okay.

08:48.920 --> 08:49.920
All right.

08:49.920 --> 08:50.920
Good.

08:50.920 --> 08:51.920
That's great, though.

08:51.920 --> 08:53.680
Sounds like so it does sound like work is underway.

08:53.680 --> 08:58.240
I know my Raspberry Pi 400 is gonna love that too.

08:58.240 --> 09:01.660
There's so much we could talk about like just alone with the app center, we could fill a

09:01.660 --> 09:02.660
we could fill a whole episode.

09:02.660 --> 09:06.840
So is there anything else you wanted to draw attention to or mentioned before we wrap up?

09:06.840 --> 09:11.560
Yeah, actually, you know, another huge focus for us has been making sure that we can get

09:11.560 --> 09:14.020
elementary OS shipped on devices.

09:14.020 --> 09:16.800
So we have, you know, our partners, our retailers.

09:16.800 --> 09:21.920
So if you go to store dot elementary dot IO, you can see there if you're in the market

09:21.920 --> 09:28.280
for a new computer, we have, you know, laptops and mini desktops from laptop with Linux.

09:28.280 --> 09:33.220
We have the desktops, laptops and minis from slim book and all in ones also.

09:33.220 --> 09:38.920
And then star labs makes some really, really slick computers, really cool notebooks.

09:38.920 --> 09:41.320
Okay, I'll have to check that out.

09:41.320 --> 09:44.200
Man, it just really impresses me this release.

09:44.200 --> 09:45.200
There's so much in there.

09:45.200 --> 09:48.280
So I'll put a link in the show notes to the release announcement.

09:48.280 --> 09:53.840
This if you want to if you want to go to school on how to write a post that covers updates

09:53.840 --> 09:57.280
to your OS, you can go to class with this post, we'll have a link to that in the show

09:57.280 --> 09:58.280
notes.

09:58.280 --> 10:13.360
Thank you so much for joining us.
