1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,880
G's here and I've recently been falling in love with ThinkPads again. I've owned a few over the

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:12,240
years and specifically used ThinkPads and how you can get more value for your money out of a use

3
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:16,880
ThinkPads. And so the one and only person that I could think to bring on to talk about ThinkPads

4
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:22,080
is of course Alan Pope. Many of you know him as Popey. So how are you doing Mr. Popey?

5
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:27,120
I'm doing very well. Thanks for asking me on. I'm not the world's biggest expert on ThinkPads,

6
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:29,520
but I think you could class me as an enthusiast.

7
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:33,600
Yeah. So how did you originally get into ThinkPads? Like what was your first one?

8
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,160
Was it a hand-me-down or a work machine or what was it?

9
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:42,560
So I used to do IT support for companies years and years and years ago. And I think I came

10
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:48,720
across ThinkPads at some point. I worked for one of the big six accountancy firms and some of their

11
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:57,280
accountants had ThinkPads. And I liked them then because as an IT support person, you know, if you

12
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:02,080
had to do any maintenance, they were easy to work on. You could take them apart easily. You could

13
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:09,280
swap out the battery, the hard drive. They were just really easy machines to work on. And so that

14
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:16,960
set it in my mind that ThinkPads are always this high bar for laptops from a maintenance point of

15
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:26,240
view and reliability as well. And I never really owned one back then. That was in the mid to late

16
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:33,920
90s. I never had one until working through IBM. And obviously everyone who worked through IBM

17
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:40,560
got a ThinkPad. And so I got one given to me, well, you know, on loan while I'm working there.

18
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:45,360
And that's when I properly fell in love with it because I installed Ubuntu on it

19
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:52,160
and everything just worked. And it just felt super reliable and robust. And, you know,

20
00:01:52,160 --> 00:02:01,600
I could lob it in my bag and it just felt like the perfect laptop for me for all of the reasons,

21
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:06,720
you know, robustness, ease of maintenance, everything worked. And so it just ticked all

22
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:10,240
the boxes as soon as I got that one workstation ThinkPad.

23
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,360
Aaron Alexander Excellent. So

24
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:17,280
do you remember what model it was or what the specs were on that first ThinkPad? Because this

25
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,040
would have been in the late 90s then?

26
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:24,080
Jason Vale No, this one would have been quite a bit later. So this would have been in the 2000s,

27
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:31,680
around about 2004, 2005. No, later than that, about 2006, something like that. And that would

28
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:38,960
have been a W series. So for those who don't know, the ThinkPads have like the first letter

29
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:45,520
defines the series of ThinkPad and the W's are the workstation ones. So it was a workstation

30
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:52,000
of some kind. I know it had an NVIDIA GPU. So it was it was quite chunky. And it was mostly

31
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,560
sat on my desk at work. But yeah, that was that was the first one. So I actually went in high.

32
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:02,160
I didn't get an entry level one. I got a really decent spec machine as my first one, which I think

33
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:03,680
probably helped.

34
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:06,720
Aaron Alexander Yeah, I would imagine that that would help. So

35
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:14,880
the workstation series, is that still the series that you kind of go along with? Do you is there

36
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:18,960
is there a series that you gravitate to more on your personal buys?

37
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:22,800
Jason Vale Yeah, it really depends. And I mean, I have

38
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:30,480
a number of ThinkPads and they're a mixture, but they're a mixture between the X series,

39
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:38,240
which are the kind of lightweight workstation, the one that's a little bit thinner, a little bit

40
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:42,800
narrower. So the keyboard generally goes right to the edge of the machine. There's not like a big

41
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:53,280
gap either side. Whereas the T series are more the corporate desk-bound laptops, and those are

42
00:03:53,280 --> 00:04:00,240
slightly wider. And then the workstation ones are the higher end ones. So I mostly got X series

43
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:06,000
laptops and T series laptops, but some of them are so old that they predate that naming scheme.

44
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:14,320
So they're, you know, they're R90 or R something. And most of the ones I've got are that I actually

45
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:19,520
use are relatively modern, like within I say relatively modern, we're talking within the last

46
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:24,560
eight years. And but I've got a bunch that are much older than that. And those are kind of the

47
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:31,040
retro ones that don't fit that naming scheme. But currently, it's mostly X series and T series

48
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:31,520
machines.

49
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:34,560
Aaron Alexander Right. Yeah, I've actually got one that I

50
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:40,320
when I purchased a vinyl cutter from a friend of mine, they gave me an old ThinkPad that was running

51
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:45,360
I think Windows 95 or something that actually still has a parallel port because that's what

52
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:51,520
the printer needed. So I'd have to dig it out to see what it is. But it currently isn't in use.

53
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:58,000
I probably will never use it again, in fact. So how many ThinkPads do you own now?

54
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,120
Jason Vale That's a good question. Is it bad that I

55
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:01,520
don't know?

56
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,200
Aaron Alexander No, it's not.

57
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:06,800
Jason Vale So my main machine that I'm sat talking to

58
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:14,000
you on is a T450. And that's the one I use all the time. And that's the one I sit in a docking

59
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:19,760
station and I run it with three displays. And I've upgraded the drives in it and I've upgraded

60
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:24,480
the RAM. And that's my main workhorse. I've even replaced the display with a better display. So

61
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:31,600
it's like, that's the one I'm sat looking at all the time. The previous ThinkPad I had was an X220.

62
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:43,360
So that dates from around 2012. My general guide is, when you're looking at the X series and the

63
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:50,640
T series, the middle digit equates to the year of manufacture roughly. So if you're trying to

64
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:58,320
think how old a machine is, a 220 was made in 2012. And a 230 was made in 2013. So that gives

65
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:02,080
you an idea of how old it was. Mine dates from around 2012, my X220.

66
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,600
Aaron Alexander Okay, yeah, I was actually

67
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,560
looking at some of the X220s in the X series myself.

68
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,160
Jason Vale They're great. They're really great.

69
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:14,160
I mean, all of them have their flaws. None of them are perfect. But then no laptop is.

70
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:22,960
I've got a couple of X61s. And the X61s are even more compact. And they've got a four by three,

71
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:29,520
they're much older. They've got dual core CPUs. And they've got four by three aspect ratio display,

72
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:36,000
no webcam. But they're perfectly serviceable. I've got one running Ubuntu Mate. And the desktop,

73
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,440
once you get the desktop up and running, everything's fine. And I've got another one,

74
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:44,960
which is a command line only system has no GUI on it. Because you can.

75
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:51,680
And those both work really well. And they've both got six gig of RAM. So you know, it's not like

76
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:57,360
they're starving for memory or anything. They've got enough oomph to work.

77
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,960
Aaron Alexander So we're counting up to like,

78
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,920
six or so at least that you have in use?

79
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:04,880
Jason Vale Well, that's one, two, three, four. That's

80
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:14,400
four in use. There's an X1 Carbon, which is the Ultrabook style, which my wife uses as her

81
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:20,960
main machine. And the handy thing there is because my T450 and my wife's X1 Carbon have the same

82
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:26,000
charge port, this rectangular yellow port. It means that when we're sat on the sofa,

83
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,400
we just hand each other the cable. Like, so I don't have to have two chargers underneath the

84
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:35,840
sofa. I can just, she has the cable for a bit and I have the cable for a bit. And then the rest of

85
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:45,440
them are really somewhat older, crustier, kind of Windows 98, Windows 95, Windows XP era kind of

86
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:52,800
ThinkPad. So I've got a T43, which is the last model of ThinkPad that was made before IBM sold

87
00:07:52,800 --> 00:08:01,200
off the laptop line to Lenovo. And I've got a super thick one that's got speak, front firing

88
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:08,320
speakers, like grills on the front of the laptop. It's really, really thick. And that's got Windows

89
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:14,880
98 on it. So yeah, I've got a range of them. But the main ones that are actually in use on a daily

90
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:21,360
basis are the X61, the X220 and the T450. Excellent. And the T450, you said you have

91
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:26,320
three displays hooked up to that. Are you running those out of the DisplayPort, Jack?

92
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:31,920
So I've got it sat in a docking station. I picked the docking station up on eBay.

93
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:38,160
And I just slammed the thing into the docking station. And there are two external displays

94
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:44,960
plugged in. One's via DisplayPort, one's via HDMI. And as soon as I slam the laptop in,

95
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:50,480
I use the internal panel as the main screen. And then the other two displays are sat above

96
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:56,640
and behind as I use the secondary and tertiary display. But thankfully, you know,

97
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:02,960
GNOME and KDE and all the modern desktops remember the layout. So when I yank the laptop out,

98
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:07,200
everything just reduces back to one screen. And then when I plug it back in again,

99
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:11,360
everything opens up to three screens and I can rearrange my windows a little bit

100
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:18,000
and carry on. So yeah, my day-to-day machine has three displays, the laptop and two externals.

101
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:24,000
That's pretty awesome, man. You know, talking about these and have you purchased any of these

102
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:30,000
new or do you mainly purchase them used? If someone was kind of looking to buy their first

103
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:36,080
ThinkPad, is there a suggestion you would give them to look for pre-owned or buy new?

104
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,120
What would you suggest?

105
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:41,520
Yeah, they're quite expensive, like relatively speaking. And one of the pitfalls you can fall

106
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:47,520
into is buying the, there's a consumer grade ThinkPads, which are the E-series and I would

107
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:53,360
avoid those. I mean, if you're on a budget and that's all you can afford, then, you know,

108
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:57,680
fair enough. But they're nothing like what I would call proper ThinkPads. The E-series ones are

109
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:04,560
consumer grade and it shows they're not as easy to upgrade. They just don't feel as robust and

110
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,640
they don't have the same components.

111
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:11,600
Yeah, I can attest to that because the first ThinkPad that I ever purchased outright was the

112
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:22,240
X120E, which was the AMD GPU or APU rather. It was not great. But I mean,

113
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,400
it did the job for what I was using it for.

114
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:31,760
So I think that's the thing is that if you've got the budget and you can buy one new,

115
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:38,160
that's great. But I personally have only ever had one from new, other than the one I had when

116
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:45,600
I worked at IBM. I personally bought the X220 myself from new and I was contracting at the

117
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:53,360
time. So it was a business expense, my own company. And I paid 45 pounds, I think it was,

118
00:10:53,360 --> 00:11:02,560
on top of the cost of the laptop for on-site warranty. And I had to use it, I think three times

119
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:08,320
in the three years that that warranty was valid. And I had to have the motherboard replaced once

120
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:12,240
and I can't remember what else, but I had other components replaced and the guy just turns up to

121
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:17,440
my house and, you know, sits at my dining room table and repairs my laptop right there in front

122
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:21,840
of me. It's great. It's a lovely service, not having to return to base and be without your

123
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:28,480
laptop for, you know, who knows how long. It was really valuable. That 45 quid was the best 45

124
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:33,840
quid I ever spent on that laptop. But most of them I've bought secondhand, either through eBay,

125
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:39,520
or there are various resellers that, you know, refurbish laptops. And if you can find a reputable

126
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:45,920
one that's got good reputation through, you know, other people or has got good online scores or

127
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:50,640
whatever. But I bought them on eBay and they've been fine. I've not had any problem with buying

128
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:54,960
ThinkPads on eBay. And there's so many of them because, because ThinkPads are so popular as

129
00:11:54,960 --> 00:12:01,600
business machines and then businesses churn and get rid of hundreds of them. The market is full

130
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:06,560
of them. So there's, there's tons of these X series laptops on the market and they don't

131
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:11,920
particularly hold their value. They're not like Apple laptops where they command a high price

132
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:15,760
secondhand. You can pick one up for a couple of hundred dollars pretty easily.

133
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:22,160
Well, and it seems like from just my research recently, whenever I purchased, my latest

134
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:28,320
purchase was, was a T440S that a lot of these machines are off lease machines. So you'll find

135
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:36,960
that the seller has 150 of these machines. They've sold, you know, 40 or so. So I can attest to,

136
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:43,200
you know, buying from eBay and, and so far I've had a good experience. But I think you're right.

137
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:48,800
I think you just need to do your research and kind of determine if the seller is reputable

138
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:56,400
enough to buy from them or not. When you're shopping for a pre-owned ThinkPad, is there

139
00:12:56,400 --> 00:13:03,520
a particular model you would say that you should look for nowadays? Is, is there, you know, a

140
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:10,480
particular combo mill per se that you should look for? I know that on my 440S, the track pad is

141
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:16,960
probably the worst track pad I've ever used. So immediately I replaced that. But is, is there,

142
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:20,880
are there any tips or tricks that you would give people out there if they're looking to buy one?

143
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,080
Maybe which model?

144
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:26,640
So I would start, if you're looking for ones that are going to be a usable workstation,

145
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:31,360
it really depends on what your use case is. Do you want something for, you know, retro fun,

146
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:36,800
maybe installed DOS and Windows 98 and Windows XP and stuff like that to play old retro games and

147
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:42,880
have a bit of nostalgia as a like spare machine? Or do you want it as a, an active usable machine?

148
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:52,240
And if we, if we talk about the, the latter, then I would say the X220 is okay, but it's a bit long

149
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:57,920
in the tooth now. The CPU is Sandy Bridge. It's usable and you know, you can install a modern

150
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:05,920
desktop on it and it works perfectly reasonably. But you might, you might get a good deal on a

151
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:14,800
230 or 250. I would probably skip the 240, which has the dodgy keyboard as well.

152
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:21,280
So some of them have, Lenovo went through a weird phase where some of the models had a strange

153
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:26,880
keyboard, which had the function keys along the top were a little bit weird, like touch buttons

154
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:34,160
and generally nobody likes those, but it's down to personal taste. You know, what your personal,

155
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:39,440
some people prefer those keyboards. Most people don't, they prefer the traditional Lenovo keyboard

156
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:46,320
and the X220 has, I think is the last one that has the older generation of ThinkPad keyboard.

157
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:51,200
And then they went to the chiclet style and then they went downhill, I think with the 240

158
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:55,920
and the 440 and then they came back with the 450 and that's the one that's good.

159
00:14:55,920 --> 00:15:03,680
So if you get a good deal on a 450, so a 2015 era machine or a 250, they're both the same age,

160
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:08,080
same kind of internals, or you want something a little bit cheaper and a little bit older,

161
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:12,800
probably the 230 would be a good one to have if you want something low price and they do show up.

162
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:17,200
One of the pitfalls with the X series is a lot of them have, because they've been

163
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:25,920
low cost corporate machines, they have 1366 by 768 resolution. For some people that's okay,

164
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:29,200
that's good enough if you're just going to be browsing the web a little bit, but if you want

165
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:39,280
it as a workstation, generally you probably want 1080p and the 450s come with 1080p screens and

166
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:44,960
more modern ones do, but it's hard to find older ones with a 1080p screen than mostly

167
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:50,320
the 768, which is a bit awful. It's usable, but it's not so good.

168
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:58,000
The other thing that's worth noting is some of the T series ones have an interchangeable battery.

169
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,240
In fact, most ThinkPads have an interchangeable battery. You can just like yank it out and put

170
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:06,160
a different one in, but the difference with the T series is they have an internal battery as well,

171
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:09,680
so you can actually take the external battery off while the system is running.

172
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:17,280
And for me, I love that. I have four spare batteries for my laptop in my laptop bag,

173
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:22,400
and when I'm out, if the battery runs low, I'll just pull the battery out while it's running

174
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:25,600
and put another battery in and it will just carry on working. I don't have to shut down,

175
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:30,400
I don't have to plug it into the mains, it just carries on working because it

176
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:33,360
keeps running on the internal battery while you pull the external one out.

177
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:41,280
And that's quite a selling point that not many laptops have. But if battery endurance isn't the

178
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:44,640
main factor for you, then that might not be interesting to you. You might want something

179
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:48,720
thinner, light, so you might go for the X series, which doesn't have that feature.

180
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:55,680
Yeah, and I've noticed with that 440 that I have, I think it's a three cell internal battery, and

181
00:16:55,680 --> 00:17:00,560
it's great, man. I love that ability, just like you said, to be able to swap batteries. I've yet

182
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:05,440
to purchase additional batteries, but I'm sure that that will happen, you know, next pay period,

183
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:11,040
whenever I can offset that so that my wife doesn't get too mad that I've been purchasing all the

184
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:16,400
ThinkPad parts and pieces. Yeah, that's the downside. It can be a bit addictive. You can

185
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:22,480
find yourself, well, you know, I could just buy this docking station and I could buy this ThinkPad

186
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:26,800
branded mouse that goes along with it. And, you know, I could upgrade the keyboard and it's very

187
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:32,000
addictive. Exactly. And the one thing for me that I was looking for whenever I purchased the 440

188
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:39,920
was the 1080p IPS display, because one of the things I noticed with the earlier X120e that I

189
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:46,720
had was that it had the 1366 screen, but the viewing angles were horrible. Like you had to

190
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:53,840
get it just perfect to get that kind of, you know, best viewing angle possible. And with that IPS

191
00:17:53,840 --> 00:18:00,480
display, it's been phenomenal. But I purchased that. And then after purchasing that, I purchased

192
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:09,520
because it came with the i5 4300, I believe it is, immediately bought another motherboard. I bought

193
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:16,720
the i7 motherboard, found that for like 40 bucks or so, bought the 450 trackpad, found that for 20.

194
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:24,640
And then there was also an available M2 slot where I guess normally a 3G or cellular modem

195
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:30,560
would go. So I purchased like a 120 gig M2 drive just to kind of work as my boot drive.

196
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:38,480
Are there any sort of upgrades that you commonly do to these machines or do you try to buy it

197
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,560
all loaded out as you see?

198
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:45,600
Yeah, that's a great question. So you can get a good deal on one that's got like only

199
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:51,520
four gig of RAM or something and spinning rust hard drive, and then you can just replace those.

200
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:56,640
Because you could be confident with certain models, anything other than the carbon,

201
00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:02,960
the X1 carbon, you can change the RAM, change the hard drive. And the hard drive on most of them is

202
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:09,680
is on the X series, it's usually a case of undoing one screw and the drive just slides out the side.

203
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:16,000
With others like the T series, you have to take the whole backplate off, but it's like 12 screws

204
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,560
that get retained in the backplate so you don't lose them. And then you could just pop the drive

205
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:25,760
out. It's not it's not super hard. It's not difficult. So definitely storage. And yes,

206
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:30,640
the fact that some of them have an M2 slot, like some of my ThinkPads, I have dual boot.

207
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:37,280
So for example, I've got my X220, I've got Windows installed on the M2 drive for when I want to test

208
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:46,160
out stuff like WSL on Windows. But yeah, storage is an easy one to do. In the X220,

209
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:51,920
I've upgraded the hard drive in that, I don't know, five times in the eight years I've had it,

210
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:57,440
or seven years I've had it. So it's, it's very easy to do. And the fact that it's easy to do

211
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:02,960
means I don't, I have confidence that it doesn't matter if the if the drive goes bang, I'll just

212
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:07,440
put another one in there. Or if I want more storage, I'll just swap it. It's I feel confident

213
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:14,080
I can do that. The other thing that's a bit more tricky, but you can do is replace the screen.

214
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:21,840
And so my T450 came with a gloss screen. And it took me a while before I figured out actually,

215
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:28,320
I could just replace this. And there are companies that will sell the right screen for your laptop

216
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:33,360
that has the matte coating or a different resolution. You have to be a bit careful because

217
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:37,120
some of them have different connectors and different interfaces. But in general, it is

218
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:41,520
possible to replace the screen. So if you really, you know, you like the laptop, but the screen is

219
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:44,800
getting you down, it is possible to just upgrade that component.

220
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:47,840
Now are these third party screens?

221
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:48,560
Yeah.

222
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:54,400
Okay. So from my research, that's really what I found mostly is, you know, a third party seller

223
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:58,960
that's that's basically, you know, selling a display that will work with a ThinkPad,

224
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:02,000
but not necessarily the OEM replacement.

225
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:07,600
And that gave my my 450 my T450 a new lease of life because I was getting to the point where

226
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:12,240
the screen was starting to annoy me. And I thought, you know what, I should just go and

227
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:17,360
buy another laptop because this one's yeah, I'm resisting using it outside. Like sometimes I'll

228
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:21,680
go and watch my son play football. And I'll take a little chair and I'll sit while he's playing and

229
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:26,320
I'll get my laptop out tether to my phone and I'll start working on my laptop. But if it's a

230
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:33,760
bit sunny, the glare makes it almost impossible to use. Whereas now I can I've replaced the screen

231
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:39,760
and it's now suddenly more usable again. And the other thing to note on upgrades is sometimes

232
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:49,280
the manual is wrong about how much RAM a machine can take. So the spec for my T450 says that it

233
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:54,880
can take 16 gigs of RAM, but it's lying, it can actually take 32. And I know this because I bought

234
00:21:54,880 --> 00:22:01,520
two 16 gig sticks and put them in and I've now got 32 gigs of RAM. So there are certain online

235
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:07,280
resources I'd recommend the the best one actually I found is this there's one website which is

236
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:14,160
this there's one website which is think wiki. And I think think wiki.org and it's got all the specs

237
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:20,160
of everything pad. And the other one is on Reddit, there's a subreddit called ThinkPad,

238
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:26,480
slash our ThinkPad. And in there, you'll find plenty of conversations of people just showing

239
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:32,560
off photos of the new ThinkPad. But people also having discussions about I want to do this hardware

240
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:37,360
upgrade or, you know, is this the right amount of RAM for this machine? Is there anyone else who's

241
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:42,320
got this particular model and has upgraded in this particular way? And it's a really friendly,

242
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:47,200
nice community. It's a nice bunch of people and most of the people in there seem to run Linux.

243
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,560
So that's also nice.

244
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:52,960
Well, yeah, and that's we were recently having a conversation about ThinkPads in the

245
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:58,560
Jupiter Telegram channel. And one of the things that we were talking about, you know, someone was

246
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:04,000
like, well, this machine only supports 16 gigs of RAM. And I was like, Are you sure? And so I just

247
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:10,720
looked up the specs for the CPU that was in it. And it can support up to 32. And, you know, I

248
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:15,280
couldn't see his eyes bulge wide open. But he was like, Oh, my God, dude, I never I never thought

249
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:19,680
that this would work. I was like, you might as well give it a try. I mean, at the price of

250
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:25,760
of RAM, I mean, it's it's a pretty inexpensive upgrade. And he now has RAM on order. So I'm

251
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:30,880
looking forward to whenever he pops back in and he says this ThinkPad now has 32 gigs of RAM.

252
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:37,600
I was really lucky this T450 takes RAM I couldn't swap out of any other machine because most of them

253
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:45,600
are older than this. But on eBay, there were two different vendors selling the same 16 gig

254
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:51,120
stick at the same time. And so I bought one from each of them. And they both arrived within a day

255
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:54,960
of each other and I put them both in the machine and they're basically a matched pair. They're

256
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:58,960
exactly the same. I put them both in and now 32 gigs. It's awesome.

257
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:07,840
Yeah. And with that 440 s a little disappointing, but four gigs was soldered on. So in theory,

258
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:12,640
you know, I could so I've got the four gigs that are soldered on and then an eight gig stick in

259
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:18,640
there. So in theory, I could upgrade and throw a 16 gig stick in there, but I'm likely only going

260
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:25,280
to get the 16 gigs, not the 16, not the full 18 gigs that would be in the machine. Wouldn't it go

261
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:31,120
to 20? Would you not get 20 with 16 plus four? Yeah, my math is horrible. Thank you. Thank you,

262
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:36,560
poppy for correcting my math. But yes, so I wouldn't I wouldn't be able to get, you know, the

263
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:42,080
full RAM that would be in the machine. So I'm kind of teetering on if that's an upgrade that I want to

264
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:51,280
do or not. And I have noticed too that like the gets the 440 p model actually has a socketed CPU.

265
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:57,680
So you can swap the entire CPU out without actually having to do a motherboard swap, which

266
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:02,720
I found to be, you know, pretty inexpensive way to upgrade a machine as well.

267
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:09,600
Yeah, the only thing to watch with CPUs on ThinkPads is their thermal design isn't perfect.

268
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:17,600
And my X220, I bought the i7. And a colleague at the same time bought the i5 version, identical

269
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:26,160
in every way, just different processor. And mine overheats quite a bit. And it overheats,

270
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:33,280
we think because the thermal design doesn't allow the ThinkPad to get the hot air out fast enough.

271
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:39,360
So you know, if you're going to be using it for like compiling code constantly, and you want it,

272
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:46,560
you never want the processor to scale back the frequency, then you might want to consider that.

273
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:53,680
The other problem is my 450 in a docking station, this is an official docking station from Lenovo.

274
00:25:54,560 --> 00:26:00,800
The bit on the left hand side where there's a key lock and a button to power on and the eject button

275
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:07,440
to pop it out of the docking station actually obscures part of the vent. So it's the thermal

276
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:13,040
dynamics on this thing are worse when you put it in a docking station than when you don't.

277
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:16,960
So my laptop overheats more when I'm sat at my desk. Now part of that is going to be because

278
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:21,760
it's driving three screens. So there's more pixels to push around, for sure. And there's

279
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:29,200
more applications on and active at any one time. But still, it's a bit rubbish designed to have

280
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:37,040
half the vents blocked by the docking station that it's sat in. It's not great. I don't know

281
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:41,600
if the modern ones do that as well. But this is the most recent one I have.

282
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:49,840
I see. Well, not the best engineering design decision, it seems. So of all these machines,

283
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:54,880
and obviously you run Ubuntu and other variants of Linux on most of these machines,

284
00:26:54,880 --> 00:27:05,920
BIOS updates. If your system doesn't have LVFS support, is there a way that you go about updating

285
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:10,080
the BIOS, flashing custom BIOS? Have you tried any of those?

286
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:18,240
So I haven't tried any custom BIOSes. I'm always wary of bricking machines with BIOSes. So I'm

287
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:26,240
pretty careful in that regard. I have seen that one of the downsides of Lenovo devices is they

288
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:34,240
sometimes have whitelists in the BIOS for things like the wireless card. So you can't always just

289
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:38,400
open it up and replace the wireless card with a better, faster one because there's a whitelist in

290
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:43,760
the BIOS that won't let you. And that also happens with the battery sometimes as well. If you

291
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:49,680
plug in a non-OEM battery, it can detect that and say your battery is dead, your service center or

292
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:56,160
whatever, which is not very pleasant. And I don't like that. But thankfully, I've got none where I

293
00:27:56,160 --> 00:28:01,600
have wanted to do that. But I can understand if people have wanted to do that. And it's frustrating

294
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:08,480
that you're blocked by some flag in a BIOS somewhere. But there are guides that I've seen on

295
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:13,040
Reddit, on our ThinkPad, where people have talked about what they've done to overcome these issues.

296
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:17,600
And yeah, patching a BIOS is one thing. For the standard BIOS updates that come from Lenovo,

297
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:23,200
the two main machines, I mean, most of my machines, as I've said, are ancient. And so

298
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:29,920
they're never going to get BIOS updates ever. So I don't really care. But the main ones that I use,

299
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:37,840
I generally also don't care because I don't know, they currently work. It's only if there was some

300
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:43,920
issue that I discovered that I actually had to do a firmware update for. If I was experiencing,

301
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:50,560
then I'd go and look for one. But I'm a pretty BIOS cautious person. I'm not like an arch user

302
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:55,840
who always wants the latest version of everything and the latest number in the BIOS boot screen and

303
00:28:55,840 --> 00:29:02,720
all that. However, that said, I do have Windows on both of them, both of my modern ones as dual boot

304
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:12,080
on the M2 drive. Now, one thing that can be useful to do, whenever I receive a Lenovo ThinkPad,

305
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:18,000
I always boot from Clonezilla on a USB stick, and I clone the hard drive before I touch it,

306
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:22,160
so that in the event that I ever do need to boot back the original operating system,

307
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:26,880
I can put it back on the drive. Or I might pull the drive out and put a different drive in. I'll

308
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:34,080
always replace a spinning rust with an SSD. And so having the old drive kicking around or an image,

309
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:40,560
you know, on a server somewhere or on a USB drive via Clonezilla, means if I really urgently wanted

310
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:46,240
to do it, I could restore the original image, do all the updates, and then do the firmware update,

311
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:50,480
and then take it out again. But other than that, I don't really care.

312
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:54,800
But I personally, I haven't been hit too badly with that.

313
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:59,600
Okay. Yeah. And that's, you know, the same for me. I'm very much one of those guys,

314
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:05,600
if it's not broken, you know, don't fix it. Right. So and I don't want to run the risk of,

315
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:10,960
you know, flashing the BIOS and having some unforeseen issue and breaking my machine.

316
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:20,480
I had considered flashing the BIOS or patching it, rather, to create a Hackintosh out of the 440s.

317
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:24,480
Because of that reason that you spoke about the the white listing of wireless cards,

318
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:28,080
you know, if you wanted to put a wireless card in that would be supported for

319
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:32,240
Mac OS, you would basically have to go in and patch the BIOS for that.

320
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:38,560
Which is not something that you have to do, because you can always just get a wireless

321
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:43,680
adapter that plugs into USB and you're off to the races. So not a huge problem there.

322
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:51,840
You know, that now that we've been talking about these ThinkPads, and, you know, I run Linux on

323
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:57,440
mine, obviously, you run Linux on yours and dual boot it with Windows. Are there any features

324
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:03,840
that we can expect to work or not work? I've noticed recently with the latest version of 1910.

325
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:12,640
And I don't know if that's just part of the GNOME 3.34 package or not, but the fingerprint reader

326
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:16,560
in mine works flawlessly, which is super awesome, something I didn't expect to work.

327
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:23,120
But is there is there anything that that, you know, doesn't work really on these ThinkPads?

328
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:30,640
So yeah, the fingerprint reader works for me as well on my 450 and my X220.

329
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:39,120
I think on more recent ThinkPads, I think from about a 470, 480 onwards, I think it might be

330
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:48,000
broken. And I believe it's broken because the the necessary driver for the fingerprint reader is

331
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:55,760
proprietary. And the people who do the fingerprint stuff on the Linux side, don't want to interface

332
00:31:55,760 --> 00:32:02,560
with proprietary blobs. And so that's a bit of a blocker. However, I'm told there are people

333
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:07,600
working on some kind of magic voodoo shim or something that will enable that to work in the

334
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:14,400
future. So I would imagine in the next six to 12 months, the fingerprint readers on more modern

335
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:20,800
ThinkPads should start to work as well, where if they don't already, they should work. But yeah,

336
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:25,600
I've got 1910 on both of mine and the fingerprint reader works. But I think that's because

337
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:33,200
they're sufficiently ancient. I mean, my T450 dates from 2015. So it's not that ancient,

338
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:39,200
but it's still like a four year old laptop. And it works there. But no, I don't know. I don't

339
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:48,160
know of anything else that I've not had working. All the ports work as expected. One of my laptops

340
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:57,920
also has a GSM modem in and that works. So yeah, I suspend works and more importantly resume works

341
00:32:57,920 --> 00:33:06,240
as well. The camera works. Yeah, I can't think of anything that doesn't work. All the media keys

342
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:11,280
work so you can, you know, turn the brightness up and down the volume up and down and all that kind

343
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:16,800
of stuff with the function keys. The only thing that might be interesting to look at on newer

344
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:22,560
models is Thunderbolt support. I've not looked at that because I just don't have a modern enough

345
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:28,560
ThinkPad that has Thunderbolt ports. But that might be worth a look to investigate if that's

346
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:33,360
something that's important to you plugging in external GPUs or other Thunderbolt devices. I

347
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:38,160
don't know how well supported that is. Yeah, and I've had great luck. You know, we talked about the

348
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:44,240
dual batteries, the onboard battery and the detachable battery. I've also noticed that both

349
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:52,400
of those report fine in Ubuntu. I haven't had any issues with those. I like to see that whenever I

350
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:58,000
am running low on the detachable battery that, you know, I can see the power level that I have left

351
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:04,560
in the onboard battery, which is super convenient so that you never really run the risk of being in

352
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:10,880
a position where you can't power down or save your work or swap another battery in. So, I mean,

353
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:16,720
overall, I've had a great experience with this recent purchase. One of the questions that Chris

354
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:24,320
wanted me to ask is he's talking about upgrading Dylan's laptop. Is there a particular ThinkPad

355
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:29,200
that you think is good for kids? Do you hand any of your ThinkPads down to your kids?

356
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:41,280
Oh, God, no. I guess, as always, it comes down to what do they want to do with it. And I know Sam

357
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:49,520
has used my X220 in the past and his primary use case back when he was using it was Minecraft.

358
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:58,960
And the GPU in the Sandy Bridge processor in the X220 is a bit gutless. And you have to

359
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:07,680
lower the render distance and drop the detail. And so for gaming, these older ThinkPads are not

360
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:13,360
really up to it. But something like a 230, 240, once you start getting a little bit newer, like

361
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:21,600
2015 era laptops, they can run some of the more basic games. I mean, Minecraft, I wouldn't

362
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:29,040
necessarily say is basic, but you know, it's not Skyrim and Fortnite. But yeah, I think

363
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:36,080
the robustness of a ThinkPad is helpful for a kid. Like, you know, kids are like,

364
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:41,520
they can, you know, drop them, have them on their lap and, you know, spill stuff on them.

365
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:48,720
I don't know if you've ever noticed, but there are drip holes on the bottom. If someone spills

366
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:55,120
a drink on the keyboard, the idea is that the liquid is routed around the motherboard rather

367
00:35:55,120 --> 00:36:00,800
than onto it and through and should just drip straight out the bottom. There's a fun video I

368
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:06,480
think Lenovo made a few years ago where someone just dumps an entire litre of water over a running

369
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:10,720
ThinkPad and it just runs straight through and the laptop carries on running. It's not something I

370
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:14,800
would recommend anyone tries and I'm certainly never going to do it on my laptop, but it's nice

371
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:22,080
to know that that's a test they do. And so for kids, like my own son has dropped a cup of juice

372
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:30,480
over a laptop before my mother-in-law's MacBook Air and so it was ruined. Whereas you would like

373
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:37,760
to hope that the ThinkPad would survive that kind of abuse pretty well. So yeah, I think the other

374
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:42,080
nice thing about ThinkPads is, I mean, I go back to the repairability and the maintenance. If

375
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:48,720
something does break, if the plastics break, you'll always find someone on eBay selling

376
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:56,000
the plastic shell or the palm rest or the underside or something or the memory slot cover.

377
00:36:56,720 --> 00:37:01,200
There's spare parts for these things all over the place. So even if something does break,

378
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:04,480
there's a chance to get it fixed.

379
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:11,280
Right, right. And that's one thing that I've noticed that they do have really good documentation

380
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:15,520
and repair manuals, you know, freely available. It's not like you have to go through some

381
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:21,280
loops to try and say that you're a dealer or a vendor or something to get these repair manuals.

382
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:27,440
So that's one thing that I really like about Lenovo. And it makes sense, in my opinion,

383
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:32,720
for them to have drain holes for drinks. I mean, if I'm thinking about this as a business class

384
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:38,560
machine, I'm sure several people have knocked over a cup of coffee or something into their

385
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:43,040
keyboard. So yeah, it's easily done. It seems like it's a wise decision on engineering's part

386
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:48,000
to try and help mitigate that. You know, thanks for coming on and thanks for talking to me about

387
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:54,080
all this. No worries. Are there any closing suggestions or some sort of advice that you

388
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:58,560
would give people if they're looking at picking up a ThinkPad? Yeah, so we've mostly talked about

389
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:06,320
like the modern era, like from year 2000 onwards. But there's still a whole bunch of older laptops

390
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:13,840
that, you know, predate year 2000 that would have come with DOS and Windows 98 and XP.

391
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:19,760
And they're tremendous fun to play with as well. Especially if you want to try, you know, playing

392
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:25,760
old DOS based games and stuff like that and live that retro life if that's something that's

393
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:33,280
appealing to you. But one warning I would give you is there are some models of ThinkPad which

394
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:40,720
have BIOS passwords in them that you absolutely can't remove. And if you're looking for second

395
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:48,080
hand older ThinkPads on eBay or Gumtree or whatever, do make sure that you've got assurance

396
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:52,960
from the vendor that you can actually boot directly to an operating system and that there's no password

397
00:38:52,960 --> 00:39:00,400
lock. Because I made the mistake of buying a ThinkPad and it has a password on the BIOS and

398
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:06,160
I absolutely can't get into it. And I've had to buy a complete replacement motherboard for a 15

399
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:12,720
year old ThinkPad just so that I can get the thing to boot. So that's one thing to watch out for I

400
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:19,360
would say is make sure the thing boots. You know, get some good photos of what it looks like when

401
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:26,240
it's booted. But the nice thing is they're mostly super repairable and, you know, easy to maintain

402
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:32,640
and they're fun to use. And despite their, you know, 1980s industrial design that looks like

403
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:50,160
it came out of a, you know, Russian military, they're delightful machines. I love them.
