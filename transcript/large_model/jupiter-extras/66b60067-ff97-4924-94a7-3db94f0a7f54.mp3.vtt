00:00.000 --> 00:15.280
Hello, everyone. This is Brunch with Brent. I'm so pleased to be joined today by Elizabeth

00:15.280 --> 00:19.640
Kate Joseph. Liz, how are you doing today? Thank you so much for joining me.

00:19.640 --> 00:21.120
Yeah, I'm doing good.

00:21.120 --> 00:25.760
So for those who don't know you, you're currently a developer advocate at IBM. And I think you've

00:25.760 --> 00:28.240
been there a little while now. Is that right?

00:28.240 --> 00:33.440
That's right. I started at the end of April last year, which means for me, I've been there

00:33.440 --> 00:37.840
a little while. But whenever I talk to other IBMers, they're all like, Oh, you're new.

00:37.840 --> 00:38.840
Okay.

00:38.840 --> 00:43.200
It's all about, you know, how you like I know some people move around quite a bit. It sounds

00:43.200 --> 00:49.440
like you've done that. And I will bring us into a little bit of your history. You've

00:49.440 --> 00:54.280
touched a lot of different things, which we'll dive into. But for others, yes, sit and sit

00:54.280 --> 00:59.320
and sit tight. I guess IBM has a reputation for that. You know, having been in the same

00:59.320 --> 01:02.560
place for a decade is not unheard of right at the IBM crew.

01:02.560 --> 01:08.300
Yeah. And I wouldn't say I've moved around a lot, like every two to four years, really.

01:08.300 --> 01:13.940
So I get myself like settled in. And maybe I'll stay with IBM for longer. But yeah.

01:13.940 --> 01:17.340
That sounds pretty reasonable. Like there's something about seeing different cultures

01:17.340 --> 01:25.300
and different ways that projects and corporations and companies run things that I think is really

01:25.300 --> 01:31.280
a wonderful way to inform the work that you're doing. So I'm, I'm not against jumping around

01:31.280 --> 01:33.720
at all. Well, says the freelancer.

01:33.720 --> 01:38.660
Yeah. And since I work on a lot of open source software, it's been interesting to be able

01:38.660 --> 01:42.920
to work on different projects. And some of it I do for fun. And some of it I do for paid

01:42.920 --> 01:47.880
work. So it's been interesting to be able to mix that up a bit as I go through my different

01:47.880 --> 01:48.880
roles.

01:48.880 --> 01:53.000
Right. Could you walk us through then some of the things that you've done for fun?

01:53.000 --> 01:59.320
Yeah. So I have like this sort of stereotypical like nerd in high school, I had my own computer,

01:59.320 --> 02:06.880
I started like saving up my like my little work jobs I had as a kid, like, I'd save up

02:06.880 --> 02:10.620
my money, and I'd buy a new computer and I'd play around with it. And I wasn't really doing

02:10.620 --> 02:16.560
programming at the time. But that's kind of what got me into the space of playing around

02:16.560 --> 02:22.640
with computers and eventually into my career. So I'd say like, the first interesting thing

02:22.640 --> 02:30.200
I did was like, I built an IRC server. And then I was this was like the geo city days.

02:30.200 --> 02:34.120
So I was like building my own websites. And one of the things that building my own website

02:34.120 --> 02:39.840
in the late 90s showed me is that HTML is all open source, like on websites. And so

02:39.840 --> 02:45.480
I was able to look at source code on websites and then build my own website. And those of

02:45.480 --> 02:50.080
us who were building websites at the time, this was very common. We were totally just

02:50.080 --> 02:54.040
like stealing each other's codes all the time, as soon as we found some new cool one. And

02:54.040 --> 02:58.000
of course, I was like, in high school. So it wasn't cool. It was like, I don't know,

02:58.000 --> 03:04.520
blinking and Java and like really weird things. But that sort of like was a segue into me

03:04.520 --> 03:10.540
starting to get involved with open source. So I did my first open source project commit

03:10.540 --> 03:17.200
in like, probably around 2004 or so. And it was to an instant messaging gateway called

03:17.200 --> 03:24.360
Biddlebee. And I instant messengers, you know, from back in the day, like ICQ and AOL instant

03:24.360 --> 03:29.240
messenger. They were huge back then, right? They were like how we spoke to each other.

03:29.240 --> 03:34.840
Oh, yeah, I remember that it was massive. Yeah. And Biddlebee put all of those protocols

03:34.840 --> 03:40.080
into your IRC client, because I was using IRC a lot. And I still do. So it's kind of

03:40.080 --> 03:44.160
aggregating all of those technologies in one place. Yeah. So all my messages came to my

03:44.160 --> 03:49.920
IRC client. And it was so great. That's so lovely. Do you remember what that first commit

03:49.920 --> 03:55.580
was like was actually just documentation. So what I had done is I joined the IRC channel

03:55.580 --> 04:00.320
for that project. And I sat there for like a month, like, because I was very shy. And

04:00.320 --> 04:06.380
I was scared of contributing. And the project leader was like, we need to update the Quick

04:06.380 --> 04:13.160
Start. And I was like, oh, how hard can that be? Okay. Turns out it was written in doc

04:13.160 --> 04:20.240
book. And it was really hard. And I like doubled the length of the Quick Start. And he's like,

04:20.240 --> 04:25.680
Liz, this isn't so quick anymore. And I'm like, I know, I'm sorry. But I put it in.

04:25.680 --> 04:30.960
And like, that was my first insight. I didn't actually do like, there wasn't like GitHub

04:30.960 --> 04:34.940
or anything at the time. So I really just like emailed my patch to the project lead.

04:34.940 --> 04:38.280
And then he put it in. And then he put my name in the readme for the next release. And

04:38.280 --> 04:46.080
that was like, the most proud moment of my life up until then. I was like, that's me.

04:46.080 --> 04:54.280
Yeah, that must feel so cool. I strangely admit that I haven't had that feeling yet.

04:54.280 --> 04:58.600
Because I haven't had that experience. And now you're making me want to go chase it.

04:58.600 --> 05:03.020
It meant a lot. And I mean, going on from there, I ended up meeting the project leader.

05:03.020 --> 05:06.460
He worked for Google, actually. And my husband, who was my boyfriend at the time, was working

05:06.460 --> 05:11.000
for Google. So he was meeting him in the office. And I was like, oh, I need to go and meet

05:11.000 --> 05:16.240
him. And now we're friends. It's just been since forever. And that's really a key part

05:16.240 --> 05:20.220
of my open source journey, too, is the relationships that I've built along the way.

05:20.220 --> 05:27.800
Well said. I feel like open source is relationships. There's no way any of it could happen without

05:27.800 --> 05:34.760
relationships. And you've seen that repeatedly since 2004. So it sounds like, yeah, that's

05:34.760 --> 05:41.920
a huge part. And so in terms of relationships, how do you feel like those sort of get established?

05:41.920 --> 05:46.060
Like for someone who is just starting out maybe with their first commits or those kind

05:46.060 --> 05:49.120
of things, what's the best way to kind of develop those?

05:49.120 --> 05:55.240
Yeah, it ends up just happening organically. So I eventually started working in the Debian

05:55.240 --> 06:00.520
project and the Ubuntu project as well. And these were still things I was doing for fun.

06:00.520 --> 06:05.720
Debian sort of became part of my job at some point. I was developing packages and putting

06:05.720 --> 06:11.280
together packages to be included in Debian as part of my paid work when I got my first

06:11.280 --> 06:18.760
sysadmin job. So in those roles, I would work with mentors in the community to do my technical

06:18.760 --> 06:22.760
work. And eventually, they sort of became friends because you talk about your packages

06:22.760 --> 06:26.880
and you talk about your work. And in these days, it was a lot of IRC. Today, you may

06:26.880 --> 06:33.440
be using some other chat protocol. But as you're working through technical things, you

06:33.440 --> 06:39.400
also talk about your cats and you talk about your dogs. And then you just start getting

06:39.400 --> 06:42.880
to know, oh, and sorry, my kid had to be in this video call. And then they're like, oh,

06:42.880 --> 06:49.120
you meet their kids. And so over time, one of the things that I started doing is going

06:49.120 --> 06:54.840
to events. So in the Ubuntu community, we used to have an Ubuntu developer summit, which

06:54.840 --> 07:00.040
was twice a year. And at these events, we would all get together in one city, community

07:00.040 --> 07:03.840
members and people who worked for Canonical. And that's really how we got to know each

07:03.840 --> 07:09.120
other. So we'd work on things all day long, and then we'd go out and have dinner together

07:09.120 --> 07:15.880
and just enjoy each other's company. And through that, I made a lot of friends who I still

07:15.880 --> 07:19.200
hang out with today and still communicate with, even though we've all gone our separate

07:19.200 --> 07:26.480
ways, essentially, we still are socially friendly. So for one, yeah, just like being social in

07:26.480 --> 07:31.760
chat, and two, going to the in person events, of which there are actually more of them now

07:31.760 --> 07:32.760
than when I started.

07:32.760 --> 07:38.560
Yeah, there are so many of them now. And, you know, I think maybe this is on everyone's

07:38.560 --> 07:45.560
minds. But I was I was just took a peek earlier at at your website, which is PrincessLeia.com,

07:45.560 --> 07:49.880
I think, which is great. And we'll talk about that maybe a little bit. But on there, you

07:49.880 --> 07:55.040
have a list of the events you're you're attending this year. And I noticed that you now have

07:55.040 --> 08:02.160
a bunch of them crossed off for this whole virus thing that's going around. And I would

08:02.160 --> 08:04.400
imagine that feels kind of sad to you.

08:04.400 --> 08:10.720
Yeah, it's it's been hard. I mean, partially, it's because my job is mostly going and speaking.

08:10.720 --> 08:17.480
And now I have like two months where I get to stay home, which is very unusual for me.

08:17.480 --> 08:21.400
And in some ways, it's sad because I'm going to miss those events. I'm going to miss connecting

08:21.400 --> 08:26.820
with people in that way. In other ways, I have my huge backlog of stuff that I'm really

08:26.820 --> 08:33.160
excited just to sit home and work on now like blog posts, and like video tutorials and some

08:33.160 --> 08:37.360
code patterns. And I'm like, Oh my gosh, I can finally get to my backlog because I'm

08:37.360 --> 08:41.480
not out speaking all the time. So it's kind of a mixed bag, honestly.

08:41.480 --> 08:42.960
Yeah, both can be true.

08:42.960 --> 08:47.560
Yeah, but it's I mean, it's all for the best. And I hopefully this passes quickly.

08:47.560 --> 08:53.040
Yeah, we'll see what happens. But I agree with you completely. Like, and I've mentioned

08:53.040 --> 08:58.640
that before how meeting people, you know, through some of these technologies, you know,

08:58.640 --> 09:06.320
that we have to sort of meet online through video, audio, you know, all the text forms,

09:06.320 --> 09:12.080
but there's nothing like meeting in person. And so if anyone hasn't had the opportunity

09:12.080 --> 09:15.440
to do that with anybody, even like a group of three people who meet in your town who

09:15.440 --> 09:20.000
are interested in Linux, like, I think that's probably what's been really great for you,

09:20.000 --> 09:25.320
right? Is that those those developers and people in the community that you met just

09:25.320 --> 09:32.800
by being involved, necessarily all have something in common. And so then, it's my experience

09:32.800 --> 09:36.960
at least that it's easy then to connect with some of these people, because you've already

09:36.960 --> 09:42.960
got some similar philosophies and, and things in common. So it's really lovely that that

09:42.960 --> 09:43.960
way.

09:43.960 --> 09:48.800
And I got my start at Linux users groups, which are much less popular these days, because

09:48.800 --> 09:53.840
there's so many meetups of all kinds of things. But that's Linux users group is where I gave

09:53.840 --> 09:58.600
my first talks. And because the audience is like, it's not a conference, it's not a big

09:58.600 --> 10:03.160
like fancy thing where you submit a call for papers, like, in a log or most meetups, honestly,

10:03.160 --> 10:07.880
you just like, email some person and say, Hey, I want to give a talk on this. And if

10:07.880 --> 10:11.440
you're upfront about like, I've never given a talk before, like, it's fine. I'm like,

10:11.440 --> 10:17.440
for most meetups, they'll be like, that's okay, like, we'll be kind to you. But like,

10:17.440 --> 10:22.160
starting with that, like, like, just a user group where there's like, maybe 20 people,

10:22.160 --> 10:26.000
it's still super stressful. And my first few talks, I know, were terrible. And I was super

10:26.000 --> 10:32.040
nervous. And like, my voice was all jittery. And I said, I'm too much. But that's true

10:32.040 --> 10:37.840
of everyone, isn't it? Right? We all start there. Yeah, yeah. But it was nice to be able

10:37.840 --> 10:43.520
to do that around like people I sort of knew in the community, rather than like at a conference

10:43.520 --> 10:48.900
where I don't know anyone, and I'm already scared. Yeah, some of those conference rooms

10:48.900 --> 10:55.560
can be pretty big, filled with strangers, or future friends, maybe. Right. Do you remember

10:55.560 --> 11:05.840
what that first talk was? I am pretty sure my talk was about communication via the command

11:05.840 --> 11:12.160
line. So I think I was talking about like text based chat things. So I was actually

11:12.160 --> 11:16.000
I talked about Biddlebee in that because that was the IM gateway. And I talked about a bunch

11:16.000 --> 11:22.280
of different like chat clients, like, or see and whatever else was available at the time.

11:22.280 --> 11:26.760
Yeah. And I don't think I had slides. Because when I looked back at it a few years ago,

11:26.760 --> 11:31.480
like all I did was like link to some resources, like I linked to some like, things on my website.

11:31.480 --> 11:35.760
And I was I think I talked about screen and SSH and like ways you can keep your chat client

11:35.760 --> 11:44.160
running forever and stuff. Yeah. I will say that you're fairly prolific in your talks.

11:44.160 --> 11:48.280
Like you list them, you actually do a beautiful job of listing. I was gonna say all of them,

11:48.280 --> 11:52.240
but I don't know if they're all there. But quite a few of them that you've given on your

11:52.240 --> 11:57.080
website. So if people want to check those out, there's quite a lot of them. I did lend

11:57.080 --> 12:05.360
my ear to one of them. I think it was at Linux Conf Australia, entitled Why Linux System

12:05.360 --> 12:10.580
Mims Should Care About Mainframes, which is some of what you're doing now. And maybe that's

12:10.580 --> 12:16.240
a nice segue. That talk, I would definitely say people should check out to get a sense

12:16.240 --> 12:20.760
of definitely your personality and the kind of stuff you're working on. But you know,

12:20.760 --> 12:25.660
in about 25 minutes, I learned a heck of a lot of stuff. But there's the word mainframe

12:25.660 --> 12:31.920
in there. And I know that's a lot of what you're talking and working about these days.

12:31.920 --> 12:38.160
I think you were mentioning that the story of where how you went from a small container,

12:38.160 --> 12:43.160
sort of startup to going into mainframes was an interesting story. So maybe you can guide

12:43.160 --> 12:49.400
us through that. Yeah, so I mentioned that I worked on Ubuntu and Debian for a while

12:49.400 --> 12:55.080
and that was like a hobby. From there, actually, one of my contacts through the Ubuntu community

12:55.080 --> 13:02.800
hooked me up with opportunity at HP to work on OpenStack. So that led into me working

13:02.800 --> 13:07.000
on distributed systems. So I worked on the OpenStack infrastructure team for about four

13:07.000 --> 13:11.360
years. And in that role, I started playing around with containers because the infrastructure

13:11.360 --> 13:16.020
team for OpenStack, one of the things we were testing out is running jobs in containers

13:16.020 --> 13:21.880
for our CI-CD pipeline. And so I was playing with containers a lot. And then when I left

13:21.880 --> 13:27.600
HP, I joined a container startup in San Francisco. And so that was a lot of fun for a couple

13:27.600 --> 13:33.600
of years. But at the end of that, I was like, all right, what am I going to do next? And

13:33.600 --> 13:37.320
I started reaching out to people in my community and figure out what I want to do for my next

13:37.320 --> 13:43.680
job. And that's when someone from IBM came over and said, hey, you want to work on mainframes?

13:43.680 --> 13:52.200
And immediately, I'm like, I think you have the wrong person. Because in my head, mainframes

13:52.200 --> 13:58.480
were this obsolete technology. And it felt like my job for the past six years had been

13:58.480 --> 14:04.220
trying to replace them. Because working on distributed systems and building up reliability

14:04.220 --> 14:13.660
and redundancy and resiliency and all the R words on cheap x86 hardware was the goal

14:13.660 --> 14:20.640
of the future. And that mainframes were just not really applicable. So I ended up having

14:20.640 --> 14:26.440
a few calls with them anyway. And I talked to some of the engineers. And one of the things

14:26.440 --> 14:32.320
that they they impressed upon me was that not only are mainframes actually modern hardware,

14:32.320 --> 14:36.200
but there's a lot of really interesting open source stuff happening on them, including

14:36.200 --> 14:40.800
work with containers. So the reason that they reached out to me was because I was already

14:40.800 --> 14:45.920
like an industry person giving talks on containers and in the Linux space. And I was reaching

14:45.920 --> 14:52.780
Linux sys administrators like myself, who they wanted to reach and change their mind

14:52.780 --> 14:57.400
like they changed mine. So it it's still a little weird being on the mainframe team with

14:57.400 --> 15:04.600
my background, just because my I don't know anything. I mean, I do now. But when I started,

15:04.600 --> 15:09.020
I was really just a Linux sys admin. And it's been this like learning journey over these

15:09.020 --> 15:15.240
past several months since I joined of discovering things. And I think the most fun I've had

15:15.240 --> 15:19.780
is talking to people who are in the mainframe space, and show it sharing with them my discoveries.

15:19.780 --> 15:23.640
And they're like, why don't people know about these things? Like mainframes, they don't

15:23.640 --> 15:28.960
go down, they can survive earthquakes, like, how did you not know these things? I'm like,

15:28.960 --> 15:34.040
I don't know, but I'm pretty representative of a standard Linux sys admin. So if I didn't

15:34.040 --> 15:38.720
know, this is the message I need to be delivering to people. Plus, it's really cool hardware.

15:38.720 --> 15:40.840
So that's been fascinating.

15:40.840 --> 15:46.800
I would agree with you completely how there's this gap, right? Like many of us, most of

15:46.800 --> 15:54.280
us, I would say I've heard the word mainframe, but usually associated with either a 90s animated

15:54.280 --> 16:00.960
series that I really love. So with thought and matrix and all this, but joking aside,

16:00.960 --> 16:07.560
like it is usually something from the past, something, you know, pretty popular in the

16:07.560 --> 16:13.280
90s, maybe, but these days, nobody really thinks of that. And so the talk that I mentioned

16:13.280 --> 16:20.240
earlier that you gave really reinforced to me that like, there's a real gap here. And

16:20.240 --> 16:26.020
it sounds like you're taking it upon yourself to really try to fill that gap and to inform

16:26.020 --> 16:32.280
pretty much everybody on the value of mainframes in today's sort of environment. Because as

16:32.280 --> 16:38.000
you described there, there are quite a few. Could you maybe give a few here so that people

16:38.000 --> 16:40.480
can get nicely curious?

16:40.480 --> 16:43.340
I think if you Google for like ode to the mainframe or something, there's like this

16:43.340 --> 16:48.960
montage of like all these mainframe mentions in pop culture, and it's hilarious. It's funny

16:48.960 --> 16:52.560
because you're like, oh, mainframe, but also like most of them don't make any sense, like

16:52.560 --> 16:56.780
hacking the mainframe. And like, there's all kinds of like hilarious things in pop culture.

16:56.780 --> 16:59.880
And I was reading like a comic book there. I think it was like Wonder Woman or something.

16:59.880 --> 17:04.040
And they're like, there was like some strange quote about like, I am the cybernetic brain

17:04.040 --> 17:09.920
of the mainframe or something. I'm like, what is this even? It's hilarious of what people

17:09.920 --> 17:10.920
think.

17:10.920 --> 17:16.800
And so why are mainframes special today, then? Like, why is it worth reviving the concept?

17:16.800 --> 17:21.360
Yeah. So one of the statistics I learned recently that was actually surprising to me was that

17:21.360 --> 17:25.360
IBM sells more mainframes today than they did in 1990.

17:25.360 --> 17:28.640
Okay. Wow.

17:28.640 --> 17:33.360
So in spite of the public perception, like there are actually more of them out there.

17:33.360 --> 17:37.440
And if you think about like going about your day-to-day business, every time you swipe

17:37.440 --> 17:43.200
a credit card, chances are your transaction is hitting a mainframe somewhere. All of the

17:43.200 --> 17:47.400
airlines pretty much use mainframes still, except for like one of them. And again, like

17:47.400 --> 17:53.320
most of the banks, most insurance companies, most healthcare, it still all runs on mainframes.

17:53.320 --> 17:58.420
So one of the things that we like to talk about is that like, if Facebook went down,

17:58.420 --> 18:02.920
or even if Google went down and you didn't have access to your email, like, or search,

18:02.920 --> 18:10.280
like that would be a bad day. But if the mainframes in the world all went away, it would be catastrophic

18:10.280 --> 18:16.120
because flights would stop, banking would stop. And what happens when all of that happens?

18:16.120 --> 18:17.920
Like things get very bad.

18:17.920 --> 18:19.840
Those are the essentials.

18:19.840 --> 18:24.680
They're really like fundamental to our life. And they're all backed by mainframes at the

18:24.680 --> 18:28.380
end of the day. Like maybe you've got these microservices in front of them and all this

18:28.380 --> 18:32.760
stuff running on cloud, but they're still going back to a backend at some point that

18:32.760 --> 18:38.640
is backed by the mainframe. And so it's really essential that they are still working and

18:38.640 --> 18:45.400
that we have the talent to continue keeping them running. So part of that has been bringing

18:45.400 --> 18:51.020
in new people on the Linux side, because Linux runs on mainframes, it has for like 21 years,

18:51.020 --> 18:57.060
but also ramping up the college students who are learning the ZOS and the other proprietary

18:57.060 --> 19:01.040
operating systems that run on the mainframe, because that's where a bulk of this content

19:01.040 --> 19:05.560
is like people are still writing COBOL. And they're still writing assembler for mainframes.

19:05.560 --> 19:10.400
And we need new developers working on that. So there's like this DevOps on Z, because

19:10.400 --> 19:15.520
that's what the mainframes are called IBM Z. So I'm on the IBM Z team. So they call

19:15.520 --> 19:20.640
it like Z DevOps, where we're bringing like Jenkins and Git and a lot of the tooling around

19:20.640 --> 19:25.040
DevOps to the mainframe world. And that's been a lot of fun, actually.

19:25.040 --> 19:30.460
Yeah, it sounds like a real niche opportunity, really. Because it sounds like what you're

19:30.460 --> 19:37.640
saying is, we need developers here. And it's really cool technology. And it's essential

19:37.640 --> 19:43.040
for it to run everywhere. So it's not it's not going away anytime soon. So it seems to

19:43.040 --> 19:47.080
me like there's a real opportunity there for, you know, some people who might want to skill

19:47.080 --> 19:52.560
up or try something new, something different. And I suppose that's exactly what you did.

19:52.560 --> 19:57.240
Yeah. So and it's really been interesting being like the Linux person on the team, because

19:57.240 --> 20:01.480
there's definitely that happening in organizations where there's a mainframe team. And they bring

20:01.480 --> 20:06.400
on the Linux people to run Linux on the mainframe, too. And there's a lot of cross training happening.

20:06.400 --> 20:10.300
So I'm teaching my mainframe peers how to do everything. And I'm teaching them about

20:10.300 --> 20:16.120
like SSH and moving files and Linux. And the Linux talent is actually really valuable in

20:16.120 --> 20:25.080
this space. And it doesn't hurt that it pays pretty well. So yeah, that's that's helpful.

20:25.080 --> 20:29.800
Nobody minds that. So my team, we like do university outreach. We also have this program

20:29.800 --> 20:33.760
called Master the Mainframe that we run every year from September to December, which is

20:33.760 --> 20:39.520
specifically for students, college students. We do a contest, we give out prizes. And what

20:39.520 --> 20:42.880
they have to do is go through a series of challenges. So we give them an account on

20:42.880 --> 20:47.720
the mainframe, not Linux, but ZOS. And then they work through these challenges to learn

20:47.720 --> 20:54.080
the basics of how to navigate the UI and write some basic programs. And it's really amazing.

20:54.080 --> 20:58.320
We had 25,000 students sign up for the program last year.

20:58.320 --> 21:07.240
Oh, that is a lot. And, well, I guess if you want to bring in some new, fresh, young talent,

21:07.240 --> 21:11.160
then that's kind of the way that you need to do it. But that's a that's a lot of that's

21:11.160 --> 21:13.160
a big cohort for sure. Wow.

21:13.160 --> 21:18.440
Yeah, for sure. And one of the really interesting things is that the students don't like, I'd

21:18.440 --> 21:23.600
say like people my age, like late 30s, we have this idea of a mainframe in our head.

21:23.600 --> 21:26.520
But the younger students, they don't, they don't know what a mainframe they've never

21:26.520 --> 21:27.520
even heard of one.

21:27.520 --> 21:32.440
Right. And they don't know that 90s sort of cliche word, right?

21:32.440 --> 21:38.000
Exactly. So, so to them, it's like this big, super powerful computer. We did a hackathon

21:38.000 --> 21:44.160
or actually a data-a-thon with some data scientist students at UC Berkeley a few months ago.

21:44.160 --> 21:48.880
And they didn't even know what IBM stood for. The company was just not on their radar at

21:48.880 --> 21:55.320
all. Like my first computer was an IBM 8086. But IBM doesn't make computers for normal

21:55.320 --> 22:01.200
people anymore. So if anyone's listening and doesn't know what IBM is, it's international

22:01.200 --> 22:03.240
business machines.

22:03.240 --> 22:09.680
Thank you for filling that in. That's funny. Gotta include everybody. Yeah, there's a lot

22:09.680 --> 22:17.240
of history there, right? And many of us, you know, I'm sort of young 30s. So I remember

22:17.240 --> 22:22.440
the IBM ThinkPads, and those have quite a reputation, right? But as far as you know,

22:22.440 --> 22:27.480
you just don't see IBM in the sort of end-user space anymore. And for good reason, they focused

22:27.480 --> 22:32.800
on some really cool stuff. You mentioned some educational stuff. I know you've done some

22:32.800 --> 22:40.640
cool things with the Linux Foundation around the Open Mainframe project. Can you tell us

22:40.640 --> 22:44.360
a little bit about that? Because that seems like two worlds colliding as well in a really

22:44.360 --> 22:45.800
beautiful way.

22:45.800 --> 22:51.280
So the Open Mainframe project is a Linux Foundation project that's built around a bunch of open

22:51.280 --> 22:58.120
source software products focused on the mainframe. So a lot of them are focused on interactions

22:58.120 --> 23:03.120
between like the older proprietary operating systems, which when I say older, it just means

23:03.120 --> 23:07.480
they have a really long history. They're actually really modern in like they're still being

23:07.480 --> 23:14.320
developed and features are added all the time. So just saying that. But the older operating

23:14.320 --> 23:19.480
systems providing modern interactions with them that are open source. So there's a project

23:19.480 --> 23:25.640
called Zoe, which allows you to have a graphical interface that's run in a web browser. So

23:25.640 --> 23:30.120
you don't really need to install any software on your computer, like on your laptop, but

23:30.120 --> 23:36.120
you can interact with the workloads and all kinds of things that are running on the mainframe.

23:36.120 --> 23:43.080
There's also connections to your modern IDEs. So if you're using Visual Studio code, there's

23:43.080 --> 23:48.480
a plugin for Z that allows you to edit code and run different things directly through

23:48.480 --> 23:53.640
an IDE that you're familiar with. So you don't need to work in all the guts of the mainframe

23:53.640 --> 23:57.480
and be like logged into a terminal. And all of that's been enabled through Zoe as well.

23:57.480 --> 24:01.920
It uses an API to connect through it. And so the Open Mainframe project, it's actually

24:01.920 --> 24:07.520
one of the things that convinced me to join IBM and take this role was because I believe

24:07.520 --> 24:12.480
in Linux and the Linux Foundation and the Open Mainframe project. I was like, listen,

24:12.480 --> 24:16.940
IBM is putting some real money and real resources towards open source software on the mainframe

24:16.940 --> 24:23.480
these days. And so that was fascinating to me. So there's a bunch of companies, Broadcom,

24:23.480 --> 24:29.200
Rocket, who are all like invested in the Open Mainframe project. So we're having our first

24:29.200 --> 24:34.360
Open Mainframe summit, I think in September. Call for Papers is open now.

24:34.360 --> 24:36.200
That's great.

24:36.200 --> 24:39.240
And it's really just about gathering more projects.

24:39.240 --> 24:40.240
Where's this summit happening?

24:40.240 --> 24:41.240
Actually, I don't know.

24:41.240 --> 24:48.040
Oh, well, we got to go find out. That sounds cool. And, and I could see why that would

24:48.040 --> 24:52.160
be a bit of a tipping point for you. Like, you know, just hearing the Linux Foundation's

24:52.160 --> 24:56.600
name is like, oh, yeah, that's familiar. I know they do good work, that kind of thing.

24:56.600 --> 25:01.760
But connected to some of the mainframe stuff, seems like, okay, well, these are, you know,

25:01.760 --> 25:07.900
that with IBM is someone I trust. So let's, let's dive in and dive in you have, right.

25:07.900 --> 25:13.120
But it also sounds like there's kind of some cool, you know, you're sort of like trailblazing

25:13.120 --> 25:18.240
in many ways, that that area, which sounds kind of cool, too.

25:18.240 --> 25:23.520
Yeah. Since I know that the Linux Foundation has such a high bar for like approving projects,

25:23.520 --> 25:26.520
I knew that it was a serious investment when I knew they were involved.

25:26.520 --> 25:33.040
Which is always a good thing. Can I ask you about what you're running at home? Because

25:33.040 --> 25:38.520
that piqued my interest, too. What are you running on your computer over there?

25:38.520 --> 25:45.400
On my desktop, which I just rebuilt with this like brand new i7 processor and like, lots

25:45.400 --> 25:49.800
of RAM, it's, I use the same case because it's beautiful. Anyway, I moved, I moved my

25:49.800 --> 25:55.280
hardware hard drives over, so I didn't reinstall, but I'm running Zooboon 2. And I still contribute

25:55.280 --> 26:00.840
to that project. That's one of the ones that I do for fun. I don't do that much. Technically,

26:00.840 --> 26:06.920
I'm the marketing lead. But that's because I know how to use Twitter. Like a high bar

26:06.920 --> 26:08.040
on our team.

26:08.040 --> 26:10.080
But someone has to do it, right?

26:10.080 --> 26:15.680
Yeah. So yeah, so I use Zooboon 2 on my desktop. And then I still run a bunch of servers. So

26:15.680 --> 26:19.260
like, even though I'm a developer advocate now, I still play around with servers a lot.

26:19.260 --> 26:22.480
So I've got a couple servers sitting behind me in my office here. They're both running

26:22.480 --> 26:28.780
Debian, like my media and my backup server. And then where my website runs, that's actually

26:28.780 --> 26:33.840
a Linode virtual server. And that's running Debian as well. And then I run a bunch of

26:33.840 --> 26:38.280
community servers for the Ubuntu community is still and I put Ubuntu on those because

26:38.280 --> 26:43.680
I thought it would be bad to run Debian on them.

26:43.680 --> 26:45.680
Maybe

26:45.680 --> 26:53.960
amusingly for work. IBM treats Red Hat Enterprise Linux as a first class citizen, as far as

26:53.960 --> 27:01.200
as desktops go. So when you join IBM, you can request Windows, Mac, or Linux. And so

27:01.200 --> 27:06.440
everyone on my team picked Mac, except for me. I wanted the Linux one. So it was great.

27:06.440 --> 27:11.320
They like shipped me this ThinkPad, like a really awesome ThinkPad. It's like a T480

27:11.320 --> 27:18.020
and it's got like 32 gigs of RAM and i7 processor. It's a really dope machine. And it had Red

27:18.020 --> 27:24.980
Hat Linux already installed on it. And it works with the VPN and all Slack and everything's

27:24.980 --> 27:30.080
already all set up on it, which is awesome because when it's my work laptop, I don't

27:30.080 --> 27:33.560
want to have to be fiddling around with the VPN and stuff. So everyone's like, Oh, don't

27:33.560 --> 27:38.280
you want to install Ubuntu on it? And I'm like, not really. I mean, kind of, but then

27:38.280 --> 27:42.120
I'd have to set up all that stuff myself and I wouldn't be able to call tech support if

27:42.120 --> 27:46.080
like the VPN breaks because they'll just like, Oh, you're using something that's not on our

27:46.080 --> 27:50.640
approved list. So it's been fine.

27:50.640 --> 27:55.880
Well, and it sounds as well to me like you have a real interest in dipping your toe in

27:55.880 --> 28:00.520
a whole bunch of different distributions. You know, you just mentioned some of the computers

28:00.520 --> 28:07.140
and software and servers that you're using just for fun, and they kind of span a big

28:07.140 --> 28:13.560
collection there. So why not gain a little bit more experience with Red Hat in there

28:13.560 --> 28:18.200
as well, right? It's there's, there's similarities and just enough differences that you can skill

28:18.200 --> 28:19.480
up in that area too.

28:19.480 --> 28:23.540
Yeah. The only, the only sort of family of Linux distros I don't really have represented

28:23.540 --> 28:27.880
here is a SUSE, which is a shame because I have a lot of friends over there.

28:27.880 --> 28:34.880
You mentioned being involved in Zubuntu. Uh, I think you mentioned to me that you, your,

28:34.880 --> 28:41.760
your current machine is sort of an upgrade path from 804. Uh, so you've been running

28:41.760 --> 28:46.680
that one for a while and it sounds like it's working pretty well. Um, I started, uh, my

28:46.680 --> 28:52.180
journey on Zubuntu. So that, um, hit really close to home for me and was kind of a nostalgic

28:52.180 --> 28:57.200
to hear you were running it too. Um, but to hear your involvement there, uh, continued

28:57.200 --> 29:04.560
involvement as well as your sort of deep involvement in, in, in Debian and Ubuntu as well, uh,

29:04.560 --> 29:07.840
really puts a smile on my face because it sounds like you've been doing it for a long

29:07.840 --> 29:14.200
time and that you're not stopping anytime soon. Uh, I guess you probably don't have

29:14.200 --> 29:21.000
any reason to stop considering you're so, uh, kind of, I guess in love with it. Right.

29:21.000 --> 29:28.000
But I heard as well that you were, uh, involved in the Ubuntu community council for something

29:28.000 --> 29:29.880
like six years. Is that right?

29:29.880 --> 29:33.320
Yeah. So that's, um, the Ubuntu community council. There's like two governing boards

29:33.320 --> 29:38.240
of the Ubuntu project. There's the technical board and then there's the community council.

29:38.240 --> 29:42.880
Um, and so the tech board, they're mostly people who work at Canonical cause they're

29:42.880 --> 29:49.280
the ones who have enough time to do all the technical work, um, and make like smart technical

29:49.280 --> 29:53.280
decisions. Um, the community council is more about like community logistics and making

29:53.280 --> 29:58.080
sure that people had all the resources that they needed in the community. Um, so I sort

29:58.080 --> 30:03.920
of did it like during like the golden age of Ubuntu community.

30:03.920 --> 30:06.360
And what do you call the golden age then?

30:06.360 --> 30:10.480
One of the things that happened with Ubuntu is it like everyone was super excited when

30:10.480 --> 30:15.920
it came out. So we're talking like 2008 to like 2014, it was going to revolutionize the

30:15.920 --> 30:20.940
desktop. We were going to have it on our phones and our TVs and everything. And then something

30:20.940 --> 30:26.480
really interesting happened was that it actually took off really significantly in the server

30:26.480 --> 30:33.120
space because for once you had a, an operating system that was backed by a company and was

30:33.120 --> 30:37.040
free. Um, because you know, you always had Debian, which was really stable and great

30:37.040 --> 30:42.200
and it's what Ubuntu is based off of, but Debian was not really equipped because it,

30:42.200 --> 30:45.680
there was no company behind it. Um, I did work for a company that would, that would

30:45.680 --> 30:50.200
support Debian, but it just wasn't in the big way that Canonical was supporting Ubuntu.

30:50.200 --> 30:54.280
So just the server side took off and that's really the direction that Canonical has taken

30:54.280 --> 30:58.520
it in. So the community is much smaller these days, but when I was working on it, yeah,

30:58.520 --> 31:01.720
it was like all about the phone and all these exciting things that they were going to work

31:01.720 --> 31:05.920
on. And a lot of that has really dropped off, which was sad to see. Um, but there's still

31:05.920 --> 31:10.240
community efforts doing all that. Like there's the Ubu ports project, which is still supporting

31:10.240 --> 31:15.200
the Ubuntu on phone dream and doing good things around it too. Yeah. And I still have one

31:15.200 --> 31:19.760
of the Ubuntu touch devices. They actually released one from a Spanish company. So when

31:19.760 --> 31:25.080
I, when I finished the, the most recent edition of the official Ubuntu book, that was like

31:25.080 --> 31:31.120
my present to myself as I bought myself an Ubuntu tablet. It was so sad. We added a chapter

31:31.120 --> 31:34.920
about tablets and things in that, in the ninth edition of the official Ubuntu book. And that

31:34.920 --> 31:39.880
was like a new chapter. We, we wrote that from scratch. And then a couple of years later,

31:39.880 --> 31:43.280
they discontinued, Canonical discontinued their effort. And I'm like, Oh, I just wrote

31:43.280 --> 31:47.280
a chapter about all of this. It's so sad.

31:47.280 --> 31:52.120
Yeah, but it was, it was really exciting being on the community council. Um, cause we worked

31:52.120 --> 31:57.640
with Mark Shuttleworth very closely. He was a member of the council as well. And it was

31:57.640 --> 32:00.880
an interesting time. I mean, definitely some trying times as we, you know, we, we were

32:00.880 --> 32:04.880
also the arbitrators of the code of conduct. And one of the things I was really proud of

32:04.880 --> 32:08.840
is Ubuntu is one of the first projects that had a code of conduct. I think it may have

32:08.840 --> 32:13.340
even coined the term code of conduct in the software space. And it was one of the reasons

32:13.340 --> 32:18.100
I was drawn to the project because I had been working in Debian, which can sometimes be

32:18.100 --> 32:25.760
a bit abrasive. And, uh, the Ubuntu community was just so friendly and helpful and amazing.

32:25.760 --> 32:29.360
Do you think that explains much of why it's gotten to where it is? Cause it sounds to

32:29.360 --> 32:33.360
me like that's repeated almost everywhere is that community is great. Community is great.

32:33.360 --> 32:37.360
Very welcoming. That was one of my first contributions like that I hear all over and over and over

32:37.360 --> 32:38.360
again.

32:38.360 --> 32:42.420
Yeah, absolutely. I mean, I see a lot of in, in the more successful open source projects

32:42.420 --> 32:47.200
that have contributors from elsewhere, I see a lot of things repeated. So I mentioned that

32:47.200 --> 32:51.860
we had these Ubuntu developer summits where we got together in person that was repeated

32:51.860 --> 32:56.400
in the open stack community and the open stack community. I wasn't the only one from Ubuntu

32:56.400 --> 33:00.780
there. Like there were a lot of people who put a lot of effort into recreating that developer

33:00.780 --> 33:05.540
summit and turning it into the open stack design summit. So every six months we all

33:05.540 --> 33:10.160
got together. Um, and now if you look at Kubernetes, they have contributor summits. And again,

33:10.160 --> 33:14.880
it's like some of the same people coming along and taking lessons from going into the past.

33:14.880 --> 33:20.320
So I'm really proud of how influential, um, that all ended up being, um, for projects

33:20.320 --> 33:26.040
even today, even though Ubuntu doesn't do them anymore, you know, like the lessons have,

33:26.040 --> 33:28.760
have modernized and come to the latest projects.

33:28.760 --> 33:34.140
That's a really nice way to put it that, that pride that you have in sort of helping develop

33:34.140 --> 33:40.200
those. Um, and now you're seeing sort of those six months sprints almost everywhere, like

33:40.200 --> 33:44.600
internally for some companies that have a lot of remote people. Um, you know, we just

33:44.600 --> 33:49.800
did one with Jupiter broadcasting a little while ago. Are they ever powerful to just

33:49.800 --> 33:53.600
get ideas happening and get people connected for the next six months. And there's just

33:53.600 --> 33:59.280
magic that kind of gets rejuvenated when that happens. So good on you for helping make that

33:59.280 --> 34:00.280
happen.

34:00.280 --> 34:05.040
Yeah. And so my, when I was working on OpenStack, my whole team was remote. Um, and we actually

34:05.040 --> 34:09.160
worked for different companies. So a bunch of us were at HP, but we also had some Red

34:09.160 --> 34:14.200
Hat and Rackspace and all kinds of other companies around working on the project infrastructure.

34:14.200 --> 34:18.040
And so the sprints were really essential because there was, we couldn't get into an office

34:18.040 --> 34:21.680
together. I mean, we ended up sometimes doing that, but it was someone's office that we

34:21.680 --> 34:26.920
went to, right? Because we were distributed not only remotely, but across different companies.

34:26.920 --> 34:27.920
What a challenge.

34:27.920 --> 34:32.040
Yeah. And there's, there's no way we could have done it fully, fully remote a hundred

34:32.040 --> 34:36.840
percent of the time. We had to get together for those every six months first for like,

34:36.840 --> 34:40.600
like social cohesion. Um, but it was also important to get into a meeting room together

34:40.600 --> 34:45.000
and hash out some of the big issues because sometimes things would just get out of hand

34:45.000 --> 34:49.960
and we couldn't deal with them over chat, right? Like we needed to get into a room with

34:49.960 --> 34:55.080
a whiteboard and all sit down together. So when I talk to people about remote work, that's

34:55.080 --> 34:59.280
one of the things I stress as well. I'm like, listen, like you can only do so much when

34:59.280 --> 35:04.040
you're in different places. Like I love remote work. I've been doing it for like over a decade

35:04.040 --> 35:11.480
now, but I need to get in a room with my teammates, like on some sort of cadence, you know, socially.

35:11.480 --> 35:16.960
Of course, remote work does not mean a hundred percent remote, right? I think that's a fallacy.

35:16.960 --> 35:21.160
Most people, when they first hear about remote work and they haven't experienced it themselves,

35:21.160 --> 35:24.280
that's often what they think, but that's not quite true, nor does it work.

35:24.280 --> 35:31.800
Yeah. And plus it's a great way to, okay, sometimes there's arguments between people.

35:31.800 --> 35:37.000
And if you get them together, oftentimes those are going to be worked out like in person

35:37.000 --> 35:43.120
because like people hold resentments and tone doesn't get communicated effectively. Even

35:43.120 --> 35:47.240
if you're talking over a video chat, like sometimes it's just not there. But if you

35:47.240 --> 35:53.800
get them together, get some tea, get some biscuits and hang out and just have fun together,

35:53.800 --> 35:57.840
like you can work through most problems. And there have definitely been personalities I've

35:57.840 --> 36:02.120
worked with who like people just like butt heads, but as soon as they get together, they're

36:02.120 --> 36:05.480
like, okay, you're actually a reasonable person. You're kind of cool. And I understand where

36:05.480 --> 36:10.600
you're coming from. I still disagree with you, but we can work together and it's okay.

36:10.600 --> 36:13.920
Like that wouldn't happen if we didn't get them in a room together.

36:13.920 --> 36:19.840
Of course. And, and yet, you know, once you get that resolved, there's some beautiful

36:19.840 --> 36:25.340
things that can happen when you bring together people who have different perspectives and

36:25.340 --> 36:30.120
have different backgrounds and that kind of stuff. So really, really fascinating. That's

36:30.120 --> 36:34.760
what kind of worries me about this, this coming year. And so we'll just sort of have to see

36:34.760 --> 36:40.380
how all of this sort of social isolation stuff shakes out, but I hope we can find a way,

36:40.380 --> 36:44.240
you know, to keep those connections strong because they're sort of the lifeblood of all

36:44.240 --> 36:45.240
of this.

36:45.240 --> 36:50.400
Elizabeth, if you wanted to put a question out to the community, what would you want

36:50.400 --> 36:55.240
to send out there? It could be, it could be something you want them to go see, something

36:55.240 --> 37:01.720
you want them to try, maybe something to think about. What would you like to put out there?

37:01.720 --> 37:05.280
So I want to encourage anyone, if they haven't contributed to an open source project and

37:05.280 --> 37:11.920
they want to give it a try, just like pick a project or actually you can even reach out

37:11.920 --> 37:14.560
to me and I might be able to help you find one.

37:14.560 --> 37:17.160
We'll spin the wheel and pick a project for them.

37:17.160 --> 37:21.680
Yeah. Or maybe even like have a quick call and talk through what you're interested in

37:21.680 --> 37:27.800
and maybe we'll find a place for you, but just give it a try. It's terrifying, but only

37:27.800 --> 37:34.360
at the beginning. I love telling this story. I was at the OpenStacks, one of the OpenStacks

37:34.360 --> 37:39.120
summits and I was on a panel and I was talking about code reviews. And in code reviews, people

37:39.120 --> 37:47.600
comment on the coding patch that you proposed. And that's really scary because everyone is

37:47.600 --> 37:52.080
self-conscious about their coding skills. And so whenever anyone critiques their coding

37:52.080 --> 37:56.600
skills, it can be scary, especially when it's some stranger on the internet. So I mentioned

37:56.600 --> 38:02.400
that I had a patch that I put up and it had like 47 back and forth with me uploading new

38:02.400 --> 38:06.680
versions and people leaving comments. And it ended up being like 47 changes, right?

38:06.680 --> 38:11.880
It was huge. And so I mentioned this during the panel and for the rest of the conference,

38:11.880 --> 38:17.240
everyone was telling me their bigger numbers. So they're like, I had a patch that had like

38:17.240 --> 38:23.400
150 revisions. It was the funniest thing. And people I totally respect and think are

38:23.400 --> 38:28.840
brilliant. They're like, I'm like, you had that many? So I want to say it's terrifying

38:28.840 --> 38:34.380
to contribute to open source, but we've all made mistakes and been there. And I'm hoping

38:34.380 --> 38:38.560
people are friendlier with reviews, but if you don't get a friendly review, it's okay.

38:38.560 --> 38:43.560
It's not you. And it happens to everyone. Totally unrelated.

38:43.560 --> 38:52.160
But I give away VMs on mainframes running Linux. So if you Google search for Linux one

38:52.160 --> 38:57.400
community cloud, for 120 days, you can get a free Linux VM on a mainframe and you can

38:57.400 --> 39:02.700
like show the CPU stats to your friends. It's a different architecture from x86. So that

39:02.700 --> 39:06.760
can be fun to play around with, like toss your software on there, see if it works. The

39:06.760 --> 39:11.440
first thing I did when I logged into one is I like logged onto IRC and like shared the

39:11.440 --> 39:20.480
CPU stats with my friends. Like I am so cool. Do you want to try that out? Yeah, it's out

39:20.480 --> 39:24.240
there. We do it to encourage development on the platform.

39:24.240 --> 39:27.120
That's lovely. And did you say 120 days?

39:27.120 --> 39:28.120
Yep.

39:28.120 --> 39:29.520
That's a reasonable amount of time.

39:29.520 --> 39:32.680
Yeah, just for playing around. And if you're an open source project, who's serious about

39:32.680 --> 39:37.200
building on the architecture, I can hook you up with like a VM that you can add to your

39:37.200 --> 39:38.680
CI system forever.

39:38.680 --> 39:47.440
Nice. Wow, local hookups. That's good. What is another sort of thing that you might suggest

39:47.440 --> 39:52.200
that people can try if they if they want to give that a shot? I know you mentioned I was

39:52.200 --> 39:57.740
plugging into IRC. But what's something kind of real world that might be fun for people

39:57.740 --> 39:58.740
to give a shot?

39:58.740 --> 40:03.560
So the biggest thing I since I work with open source projects, I just try to compile something

40:03.560 --> 40:09.920
on it. So whether it's your project or the your favorite application, but see if it works

40:09.920 --> 40:14.100
and then see the weird compiling errors that come out if it doesn't work. Because the big

40:14.100 --> 40:20.760
difference between the mainframe architecture and x86 is that x86 is little endian. And

40:20.760 --> 40:26.200
the mainframe architecture is one of the last big endian architectures out there. So I've

40:26.200 --> 40:31.440
learned so much in the past year. I mean, I've only ever really I mean, I've played

40:31.440 --> 40:37.160
around with like spark and arm and other things. But those are all little endian. And like

40:37.160 --> 40:41.360
mainframe is a whole different world. So if you want to compile some software, that's

40:41.360 --> 40:42.360
it's fun.

40:42.360 --> 40:48.640
Wow, that sounds like such a gift. So thank you for offering that. That's huge. If people

40:48.640 --> 40:52.800
wanted to get connected with you and get in contact, say hi, maybe reach out to you for

40:52.800 --> 40:55.120
a VM, where can they reach you?

40:55.120 --> 40:59.040
You can just head over to princessleia.com. I've got my email address on there and everything

40:59.040 --> 41:04.800
l y z at princessleia.com. If you're want to connect with me on the professional side,

41:04.800 --> 41:11.360
it doesn't matter. I check my email everywhere. But I'm also l y z at IBM.com. And I'm on

41:11.360 --> 41:18.440
Twitter at PLA to pretty much on everything is PLA to so easy to find.

41:18.440 --> 41:23.600
I think I would people would probably get after me if I didn't ask you about your domain

41:23.600 --> 41:28.720
name. I read that you've had it for quite a while. Princess Leia, I would imagine you're

41:28.720 --> 41:32.440
a bit of a Star Wars fan. Is that? Am I off there?

41:32.440 --> 41:38.960
When I first got online, my first chat room was a sci fi chat room.

41:38.960 --> 41:39.960
That makes sense.

41:39.960 --> 41:44.600
Yeah. And I wanted to be Princess Leia on there. But that one was taken. So I was Princess

41:44.600 --> 41:52.600
Leia 2. And that's the PLA to my Twitter handle and on my license plate and like everywhere.

41:52.600 --> 41:56.800
That's lovely. And I think many of us can relate to that, like finding the name that

41:56.800 --> 42:03.600
you want, whether it was on, you know, ICQ or whatever kind of follows you, right?

42:03.600 --> 42:10.720
Yeah. And it's it's so funny because it's so unprofessional.

42:10.720 --> 42:11.720
And yet here we are.

42:11.720 --> 42:16.080
Yeah. But my husband, my husband's like, Oh, you should definitely like separate your work

42:16.080 --> 42:20.200
stuff away from the Princess Leia stuff because it's not very professional. And I'm just like,

42:20.200 --> 42:24.480
I don't want to work for a company that doesn't appreciate it.

42:24.480 --> 42:30.000
There you go. Yeah. And I find the reality actually, is that so many of us are interested

42:30.000 --> 42:34.440
in that kind of thing, no matter where you're working or how high up the ranks you are,

42:34.440 --> 42:39.760
right? Like, how many Star Trek fans have you met that are anywhere within those those,

42:39.760 --> 42:45.800
those ranks? So I think that's a good filter. If someone doesn't want to work with me because

42:45.800 --> 42:51.120
I'm having fun, then that's maybe not a place where I want to be. Right. So. So kudos to

42:51.120 --> 42:56.480
that. Well, Liz, thank you so much for chatting. I really appreciate it. And thank you so much

42:56.480 --> 42:57.480
for your time.

42:57.480 --> 42:59.520
Yeah. Thank you so much for having me. This is fun.

42:59.520 --> 43:16.080
Yeah, you're welcome.
