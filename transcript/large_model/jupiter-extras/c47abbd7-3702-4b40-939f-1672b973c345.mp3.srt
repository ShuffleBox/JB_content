00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Welcome to part two of my conversation with Jason Spizak.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
If you haven't had a chance yet, take a moment and go listen to part one.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
It's really great.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Don't worry, we'll be right here when you get back.

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
And now, for side two.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:22,000
[â™ª Music playing in the background for the rest of the video.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
So, you use Linux to do your VoiceOver stuff.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Oh, I do.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Wait, let me back it up a little bit.

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
You do a bunch of VoiceOver stuff, so much.

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
You know, this isn't one of your first experiences, but so much that you had to,

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
you know, we had to keep agreeing to move this date a little bit,

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
because you're doing a bunch of cool projects, so.

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I did, I did.

15
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,000
They just released the trailer for Gears Tactics, which is a new Gears of War game.

16
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:55,000
It's actually a tactical, which is awesome, but it also has really great story and cinematics.

17
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
So, it's like a tactical with cinematics.

18
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
It's so fun.

19
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I've been working on it for about a year and a half, and I play UConn,

20
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
who is the inventor of all the Locust weaponry.

21
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
It's a prequel, the game is.

22
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
And he's in the comics, actually, UConn is.

23
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
And so, he's a seven-foot tall lizard creature who sounds nothing like me.

24
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
But you sound like him.

25
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
That's the interesting thing.

26
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
That was just announced, I think yesterday or the day before.

27
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
The trailer for it is wicked awesome.

28
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Oh, cool.

29
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
And, you know, so I do a lot of voiceover.

30
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
And so, you may have a few studios.

31
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I do.

32
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
We're riding down the Brunch with Brent freeway, and we're taking the Segway.

33
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I have a studio in Los Angeles, and it's just a closet, a converted closet.

34
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I'm not going to say I got my studio in Los Angeles.

35
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Those are the best.

36
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
You should see what I'm sitting in right now.

37
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Right.

38
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
It's a closet.

39
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I rent a place in Pasadena, and the landlord has been kind enough

40
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
to let me just have the closet be a converted studio

41
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
that I can, by the way, take down at any time

42
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
because it's made out of PVC and moving blankets, and it's very cool.

43
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
That's a build for another day.

44
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,000
And then at my home in Phoenix, outside of Phoenix in Mesa,

45
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I have a converted closet there, too, that I'm in right now.

46
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
And it's super simple.

47
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I have a monitor on a stand that's attached to the wall,

48
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
and above that is my microphone.

49
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I've got a Scarlett.

50
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I think it was an i2.

51
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Yes, this is a two-port i2 with an XLR jack plugged into it.

52
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
It's USB connected to my Linux box.

53
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:44,000
My Linux box is running KDE Neon, and I use Audacity.

54
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
So because in my business you don't need to produce your auditions,

55
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
you really shouldn't, they frown upon that.

56
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
You would heavily produce your auditions with music and transitions.

57
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
They really just want to hear what your voice sounds like.

58
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
You'll still use compression and normalization and everything,

59
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:04,000
but they want to hear what your natural voice sounds like,

60
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
or the voice you're creating sounds like without any shenanigans.

61
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:17,000
And I use Audacity, and I do, let's see, 20 auditions a week easily.

62
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I'm in my studio for hours and hours every day,

63
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
and I have three waiting for me that are due on Monday.

64
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
You've got work to do.

65
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:31,000
And everything from Taco Bell's new Nachos Party Packs ads to Toyota.

66
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I've got a Toyota spot that's running, and two video games, animated series.

67
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I'm on DC Super Hero Girls.

68
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I'm on Young Justice.

69
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I play Forager and Kid Flash, Wally West on Young Justice,

70
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:52,000
which was brought back by the internet after it was canceled on Cartoon Network.

71
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,000
So yeah, I do a lot of voiceover, and I love my job.

72
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I've always done cartoon voices ever since I was a kid, imitating Mel Blanc and stuff,

73
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
you know, sitting too close to the TV.

74
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I went out to L.A. to be an on-camera actor, and they were like,

75
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
no, no, no, we don't need you on camera.

76
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
But you sound great, and you can do voices.

77
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
It's just what I ended up making.

78
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Making money was the only way.

79
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
It's the thing that I ended up supporting myself with.

80
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Well, you're in good company, I mean, us podcasters.

81
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
We feel much the same, I think, right?

82
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Oh, sure.

83
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Oh, the renaissance of radio is amazing.

84
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
It was dying a hard death with corporate control,

85
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
and this is truly the renaissance of radio.

86
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
And because our commutes are longer now,

87
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
you can listen to long-form things like Brunge with Brent.

88
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:46,000
If our commutes weren't this long, nobody'd listen to this.

89
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Thank you, Exoburbs.

90
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:54,000
But I feel like podcasts, in so many ways, are what radio never was.

91
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
In many ways, they're not commercially controlled.

92
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
At least a lot of the podcasts that are out there

93
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
have much less corporate control,

94
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
and some of them have ads and things like that,

95
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
but the person reads the ad, and then they move on.

96
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
They're not spending a lot of time in their brain

97
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
thinking about their advertiser, per se, right?

98
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Or worrying if they're going to cancel the podcast.

99
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Some may be, but there's a lot that aren't,

100
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
that are, you know, free as in freedom,

101
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
in addition to being free to download.

102
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Yeah, so I love listening.

103
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I have a drive from Phoenix to L.A. that's six hours,

104
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
and I make it once a week.

105
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
So you listen to a thing or two, I would imagine.

106
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Right.

107
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Which is, in fact, how I found Linux Unplugged.

108
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
It was the last one on my list.

109
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I'd listen to every podcast in the world first.

110
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
And then there it was, sitting there, and I'm like,

111
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
oh, should I listen to this one?

112
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I don't know. I don't know about that icon.

113
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I don't know.

114
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Then cheese bacon changed the icons, and I'm like,

115
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
oh, yeah, I'll listen to that.

116
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:56,000
The reason you and I even have run into each other

117
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
is because you were so kind as to email JB and say,

118
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
hey, guys, been listening for a while.

119
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
But how long have you been listening,

120
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
and why did you even reach out in the first place?

121
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Are you asking me why I'm stocking the boards here?

122
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
You know, it feels like a real treat that you did,

123
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
but, you know, why are you and I sitting

124
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
in the same virtual room right now?

125
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I like that you're calling me out for lurking

126
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
on the boards right now.

127
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
He's like, yeah, so, Jay, how long have you been lurking?

128
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Be honest.

129
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Oh, yeah.

130
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Well, I've been lurking for, what, a month?

131
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I've been trying to tell stories here

132
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
of some of our JB community, right?

133
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,000
And I'm constantly being pleasantly surprised

134
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
by the great variety and huge reach

135
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
of some of that community.

136
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Are you mean we're not all assholes?

137
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Except for me.

138
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,000
We have a really great group of people, I think,

139
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
that surround the open source community,

140
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
and I'd like to think that we're special in that regard.

141
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I don't know if we are because I'm not as deep

142
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
a member of many other communities,

143
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
perhaps the green building community,

144
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
and those guys are all pretty cool, too, generally.

145
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,000
But just the community feel of the podcast

146
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
where Chris goes around the mumble room

147
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:20,000
and where the podcasts on the Jupiter Broadcasting slate

148
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
just have this easy going,

149
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
we have some people on sometimes,

150
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
sometimes another person's a host feeling about them,

151
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:32,000
and it's just a relaxed way

152
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
of dealing with your audience

153
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,000
that is very palpable and enjoyable.

154
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
And I think that's one of the reasons

155
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
why it's all so fun to listen to.

156
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I'm interested in the topic also.

157
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
That helps.

158
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Your human interest podcast is also super cool.

159
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
It's not strictly about Lennox, you know?

160
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Because ultimately it's the human story that interests people.

161
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Well, it turns out that most of us are human.

162
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Except me. That is correct.

163
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
You are correct, or you were.

164
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
I am dating Alexa.

165
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I guess what I'm trying to get to is

166
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
it feels like such a treat to be sitting

167
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
in this same conversation with someone like you

168
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
who obviously you have a breadth of experience

169
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
that I don't because I'm a little bit younger

170
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
and I've taken a completely different path

171
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
doing photography stuff.

172
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,000
But we have many similarities, right?

173
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Yeah. I mean, you're human.

174
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
And so am I.

175
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
And you have a thirst for knowledge.

176
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I mean, there are some people

177
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
who don't have a thirst for knowledge

178
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
and they're not very exciting to talk to.

179
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
I feel like when you said photography,

180
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I'll bet there's stuff that you could speak to

181
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:46,000
about doing high-end professional photography here

182
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
that I would be like, holy moly.

183
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I mean, I understand that workflow

184
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
partly from just because photos are files perspective.

185
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
But yeah.

186
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I mean, you have knowledge to share just the same as me.

187
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Yeah. And I feel like that's the real beauty, right?

188
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Is that we all have these very individual experiences

189
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,000
that make us a unique being with unique gifts

190
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
because of the intersections of all of our interests.

191
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
So for instance, like you've always had an interest

192
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
in this voiceover stuff.

193
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:21,000
And yet you've also had an interest in Linux.

194
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
And in your studio, those two are intersecting

195
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
on a daily basis.

196
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
So what a cool place to put that, right?

197
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Yeah. And I'm fortunate in that regard

198
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
that Linux has come so far

199
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
that I don't have to drop into N-curses

200
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
to try and enable my Sound Blaster,

201
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
and it gets all messed up.

202
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
So you've been there.

203
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Oh, I'm about to preach to you.

204
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,000
But I feel like Linux is coming of age

205
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
to where it's useful for so many things

206
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:55,000
in so many ways that it just wasn't before,

207
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
even a decade ago.

208
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
But just look at the Raspberry Pi.

209
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
It's good for so much.

210
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Is it a great computer? No.

211
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Is it a great computer for a lot of the stuff it's used for?

212
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Maybe not.

213
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
But it's the fact that there's so much sharing

214
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
going on involved with the ideas,

215
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
and I can just take a Raspberry Pi and do this.

216
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
It's an enabler.

217
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Again, it's the microcosm of what's it like

218
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
to share human knowledge.

219
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
And wow, look how effective that is.

220
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Really effective when there's no restrictions on it

221
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
and everybody's scratching their itch with it.

222
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
It's incredibly powerful and fast.

223
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
The level of innovation that's capable of,

224
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
we're capable of achieving as a species is incredibly fast

225
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
in time scales.

226
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
It's just nutty when we work together.

227
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
And my Linux studio is just an example of that.

228
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I mean that, and I love KDE.

229
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
I'm so glad that Neon came out because for the longest time,

230
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
KDE was trying to find its way,

231
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
and then Frameworks 5 came out,

232
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
and then it was the red-headed stepchild of many distros

233
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
because it wasn't quite, you know,

234
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
the transition to 5 wasn't effective

235
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
because a lot of people were still using 4

236
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
and they didn't want to switch,

237
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
and are you going to do to me what 3 did to me?

238
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Don't do that to me, you know, and I want KDE 3 better.

239
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Eventually, I feel like KDE Neon,

240
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,000
which is a stable base of Ubuntu LTS

241
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
with the latest sauce of KDE because the project

242
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
in general puts out some really great software,

243
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
is a wonderful combination,

244
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
and it works for me on a daily basis.

245
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,000
And I have had so few problems with it

246
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,000
that coming from 1997 to today,

247
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I'm blown away that I have less problems with this

248
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
than I have, like, with a Mac.

249
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
And having used a Mac for a long time,

250
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
I'm so grateful for that

251
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
and that everybody whose time and effort goes into that,

252
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
and if I file a bug report here or there,

253
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I don't have any to file.

254
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
I mean, that's crazy

255
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
because my use case is pretty flat.

256
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:59,000
I mean, it's turn on Firefox, turn on Audacity, record,

257
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,000
and then I take that file that was recorded

258
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
and I send it somewhere in the browser.

259
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I mean, like, I use two pieces of software,

260
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
and if you count the file manager, three,

261
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
like, from a user use case perspective,

262
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
and it's just a tank.

263
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,000
I hit update, I put all my updates in frequently

264
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
without any trouble. It's crazy.

265
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Now, part of that is because I know

266
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
to buy the right hardware to begin with.

267
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
So, let me preface that for everybody listening

268
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:31,000
that I use the Focusrite Scarlett i2

269
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
because I know it shows up as a device under Linux

270
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
that is going to be Linux-friendly to the sound system.

271
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
It's going to be friendly to Linux's sound system.

272
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:46,000
I use the hardware, my little NUC that I use,

273
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,000
I use it because I made sure that the hardware inside

274
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
was well-supported under Linux.

275
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Like the Wi-Fi, for example.

276
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Like, it's Intel Wi-Fi.

277
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
It works the best because it's Intel Wi-Fi.

278
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,000
And if you just come to the table

279
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
with a little bit of that knowledge,

280
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
there's a lot more choices out there

281
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
than just buying from somebody pre-installed, you know,

282
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
because it's so easy to install Linux today, brain dead easy.

283
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
And then I just don't have any issues.

284
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
I may have to create them, you know, like you guys.

285
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Like, hey, right before this recording,

286
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
I'm going to hit just upgrade and, you know,

287
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
I'm going to force it just because I want to see

288
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
how awesome I am.

289
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Keep things interesting, right?

290
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
You're going to bend to my will right before this podcast

291
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
and I'm going to hit upgrade.

292
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
I'm going to change my whole profile around

293
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:39,000
and then you will do my bidding and record this podcast now.

294
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
I've been there.

295
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Because, you know, in a sense, we like,

296
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
I'm sure that's an exercise of our power,

297
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
aka our knowledge.

298
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:51,000
We want to feel like we're a little bit, you know, capable.

299
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
And so we test it that way.

300
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
And that's silly.

301
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:59,000
But also it's this way of never stopping to learn, right?

302
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Sure, it is.

303
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,000
But why do we pick the learning right before we have to use it?

304
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
That's just dumb.

305
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Forget it.

306
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Because that's the most exciting time, clearly.

307
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Everybody listening to this, everyone who's been on this show,

308
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:17,000
except for two or three people, have done that.

309
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
And it's dumb.

310
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Don't do that in production.

311
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:24,000
But what do you say to somebody who hasn't seen Linux yet

312
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
or hasn't even, you know, is looking for some hardware

313
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
and maybe is like, I don't know,

314
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
like maybe now is the time for me to explore that?

315
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Yeah, but you have to think about that sentence you said,

316
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
is there's probably not a person in the developed world

317
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
who hasn't seen Linux yet.

318
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
They just don't realize it.

319
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
That's the real trick, though.

320
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Right?

321
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
So if you're talking about desktop Linux,

322
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
proper desktop Linux,

323
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
because if they're using Android or they're using a Chromebook,

324
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
I mean, where in the developed world have you, you know,

325
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
I've never seen Linux.

326
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Well, that's not true.

327
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
You have.

328
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,000
I suppose I should be clear about what I mean about Linux.

329
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Yes, desktop Linux.

330
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
And I think what I mean about desktop Linux

331
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
is actually some of the philosophies you and I

332
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
were talking about earlier,

333
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,000
which is to have some of that feeling of digital independence

334
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:15,000
and some onus in what's happening with your data

335
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
and those kind of topics, right?

336
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
And so how do you get someone to transition to that?

337
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
You can convince them pretty easily

338
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
that Linux is the right choice for some of those things

339
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
if they care about those things.

340
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
I think the biggest challenge is getting people to understand

341
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
why those things matter.

342
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Because if I've got a person who doesn't know Linux

343
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
and they're unfamiliar with it at all,

344
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
but they come to me and they go,

345
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
you know what, I found this cool thing, Home Assistant,

346
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
because I am sick of my data getting sent.

347
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
I'm not going to use Alexa.

348
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Dude, they're in my house spying at me.

349
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
My buddy Brandon, who's the producer of Young Justice,

350
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
is this way.

351
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
He's like, uses a Mac and everything,

352
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
but he's like, I'm not using Alexa.

353
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
I'm not using Google, you know, to spy on me.

354
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
I don't want hockey pucks with, you know,

355
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:03,000
voices coming at me and knowing that every word I say to my children

356
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
is going out the other end.

357
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:11,000
That person is a little easier to work into the desktop Linux fold

358
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,000
because they've already shown that they care some about digital independence,

359
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:20,000
you know, and there's plenty of people who don't.

360
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
You know, and we just have to understand that,

361
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
that desktop Linux and in general, open source software

362
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,000
isn't the answer to a problem that someone doesn't have.

363
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Well, what's interesting there is they don't even realize

364
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,000
that there is a choice or a problem.

365
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
I mean, there's a lot of people who just don't care.

366
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Yeah, but do they not, I guess that's my question is,

367
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:46,000
do they not care because they just don't even know it's happening

368
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
or do they not care by choice?

369
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
I have to be honest, the people that I've pressed that issue on,

370
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
and this is just anecdotal evidence,

371
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
the people I've pressed that issue on think it's futile.

372
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Hmm, that's, what an awful feeling.

373
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
They really think that so much goes through Amazon

374
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,000
and so much goes through Google that even if you were to do all the things

375
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
you think you're doing, Jason, you're not private.

376
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
You're carrying around an iPhone right now.

377
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
They know where you are.

378
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Yeah, but I use Apple Maps on my iPhone, not Google Maps.

379
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,000
I use DuckDuckGo and not, you know, whatever.

380
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,000
And, you know, there's mitigations to give them less data.

381
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,000
I don't use Facebook. I don't use Twitter. I don't use Instagram.

382
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Well, aren't you boring?

383
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
You're very boring then. Goodbye.

384
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:32,000
I am worried that it's not the reason that people wouldn't be interested in Linux

385
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:37,000
is because if they knew those reasons, they'd say, what's the use?

386
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,000
That's the part that really has me worried.

387
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,000
And there are some people who really, they just don't care.

388
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Most of the people that I've introduced to it are fascinated by it, if anything.

389
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:53,000
And then I run up against the application firewall

390
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:58,000
where their work doesn't work with it, their university didn't work with it,

391
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:03,000
their whatever, they don't like LibreOffice because it's just not Microsoft Office.

392
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:09,000
And whatever the reason is, paper cut here or there, and they abandon it.

393
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:14,000
But the irony of that is that I haven't had a single person I've handed a Chromebook to yet,

394
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,000
except for one person whose school would not let them use a Chromebook,

395
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,000
online university, stop using it.

396
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,000
So this is a Linux converted Chromebook, yes?

397
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
No, no, no. This is just Chrome OS.

398
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Just a regular old vanilla, yeah.

399
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Just Chrome OS because they were so into the Google Apps.

400
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:35,000
So that data point is like, why is that?

401
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Why can I hand someone a Chrome OS laptop and they got no problem with it?

402
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:43,000
But when I've handed them Linux laptops in the past, I've run into wrinkles.

403
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
What's the difference there?

404
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Because you and I both know it's just a matter of a few things

405
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:54,000
because Linux, I can make something run like Chrome OS tomorrow.

406
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
I really could.

407
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:59,000
I could because I could literally download Chromium OS and Gallium, whatever.

408
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:03,000
I could make it run like that.

409
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
What's the reason?

410
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Where does the paper cut slide in there?

411
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Or that they don't like it?

412
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
I don't know.

413
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Or why are you afraid?

414
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,000
There are some people who are like you and me who are like,

415
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,000
I don't know about Jim.

416
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:23,000
I just don't think I could give him Linux and he'd be okay with it.

417
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,000
I just, ooh, I'm a little afraid of that.

418
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,000
They're either a little too needy or whatever, I don't know what.

419
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:33,000
But there are sometimes reasons in the back of your mind for certain people also.

420
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Well, and those become some of those barriers for us trying to share

421
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:43,000
the things we know are good for us, which would be also good for them.

422
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:49,000
That sentiment you were sharing earlier of like just wanting to spread it widely.

423
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
But those are some of the roadblocks, right?

424
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,000
And I'm not sure we understand them quite enough.

425
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
I don't know.

426
00:19:55,000 --> 00:20:04,000
It's very possible my worries are that if I introduce Linux at the wrong time,

427
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
they'll never do it, right?

428
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Because I have a way and you have a way of fail, try, try again.

429
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:17,000
And not everybody's wired this way, especially when it comes to the black magic

430
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
pixie dust box called the computer.

431
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:24,000
And if I try at the wrong time or if I broach this subject and they're not

432
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,000
interested in what they're seeing over my shoulder on my screen or whatever,

433
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,000
and then have a bad experience, I've just ruined it.

434
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:36,000
I've just ruined it for them and for me and for open source.

435
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
And so I got to feel that out.

436
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Got to be a little careful about that.

437
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Otherwise it gets a bad name.

438
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
That may be part of it also.

439
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:49,000
That we are careful not to put it in a place that doesn't belong anymore

440
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
if we've been burned.

441
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Like the young Linux lover might be like, I'm going to share this with everybody.

442
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Oh yeah, check it out.

443
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Everybody loves Linux.

444
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,000
And then pretty soon after you get burnt once or twice, you're like, okay,

445
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
everybody might like Linux.

446
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,000
You know, try it again and Linux is pretty cool.

447
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
What do you think?

448
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:14,000
And I think that could be coloring my perception is because I've used it for

449
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:21,000
so many years and I may have a bit of an antiquated view because Linux is so much

450
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
better now than it's ever been.

451
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,000
And I'm on guard against that, but it's possible.

452
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Well, you've likely had that conversation with users more than many of us

453
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
of trying to introduce Linux.

454
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,000
I mean, you've created a few businesses, right?

455
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Yeah.

456
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
My mom doesn't use Linux.

457
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
My dad doesn't use Linux.

458
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
My wife doesn't use Linux.

459
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Like, and these are the people that are closest to me and I love them so much.

460
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Of course.

461
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,000
My dad is an SAP programmer.

462
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:55,000
I mean, Windows is where he spent his entire life.

463
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
You know, so forget that.

464
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,000
And so who are you to convince him that his tool was not good enough?

465
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:07,000
And my mom always gets his old laptop and my mom is not tech savvy in the least.

466
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,000
But if there's a problem, he can help her.

467
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,000
She's right down the hallway from him.

468
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
I'm not.

469
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,000
I'm in a studio 400 miles away.

470
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:23,000
I can't get a text from my mom when I'm recording Gears of War and like help her out.

471
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:27,000
So I'd have to feel like it's worth this.

472
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:31,000
And I just recommended my mom get a Chromebook for the first time,

473
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:35,000
even though in the back of my mind I'm like, eventually that's going to look just

474
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:39,000
like a Chromebook, but it's going to have Core Boot and it's going to have KDE Neon

475
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,000
to make it look like, and she won't even know the difference and won't she be happy

476
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
because she doesn't know.

477
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,000
But then part of me thinks, is it worth it if they don't know?

478
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Is it worth it if the person running your Linux box doesn't know what they have

479
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
and it's not?

480
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,000
So now I have the mountain to climb of, do I educate them?

481
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
What will that take?

482
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Will they accept it?

483
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Will they even understand it?

484
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:09,000
My mom's in her just about, she's, oh God, I can't say her age on the air.

485
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,000
She'll find me and hunt me down and kill me.

486
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
She'll boil me in acid.

487
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
She's older than me.

488
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:23,000
And since she's older than me, by just a small amount, ever so slightly,

489
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:28,000
it's sometimes difficult to explain things like this technologically and educate her

490
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
on why this makes a difference.

491
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Now she would just blindly trust me, probably.

492
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:37,000
But is blind trust in the person who gives you the Linux machine any different

493
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
than trusting Microsoft or Apple?

494
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:43,000
It feels much the same, considering you don't know what's actually happening

495
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
either way, right?

496
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,000
She may not have the understanding of what the underlying software is doing,

497
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
but we do.

498
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Well, and that's the fight, is that open source is really valuable

499
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
to those people who know.

500
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,000
But there's a whole bunch of people who don't and don't care

501
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,000
or don't have the capacity to know and understand that.

502
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,000
So do we just give it to them and say, ask me questions if you want,

503
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,000
but you don't need to know what's going on behind the curtain.

504
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,000
It's too idealistic for me to think that I can explain what's going on

505
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
behind the curtain to everybody who touches it.

506
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:18,000
So then should we not create something like Chrome OS that's completely open

507
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
and super simple?

508
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,000
You know, is that what gallium is?

509
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Do we ship that on hardware?

510
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,000
Do we all get behind one project?

511
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:32,000
I mean, what's the best way for Linux on the desktop not to be Chrome OS?

512
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Very good question.

513
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:39,000
I've been around every corner of that idea in 22 years,

514
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
and I don't have the answer.

515
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
And I'm of above average intelligence.

516
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
At least that's what the IQ test said when I was a kid.

517
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
You said you were so good at connecting dots.

518
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Oh, yeah.

519
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
Sort of relying on you here.

520
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:55,000
So you've been listening to this podcast, and this is the big reveal.

521
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Jason's going to solve the problem of desktop Linux.

522
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Next week on Brunch with Brent.

523
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:12,000
So for you then, where do you take that energy of just wanting to dive into Linux

524
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
every single day?

525
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Where do you put it now knowing you're up against some of these challenges?

526
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,000
I built a home assistant system for my dad.

527
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
I gave it WireGuard.

528
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:32,000
My oldest nephew, Kai, is a wonderful young man who has a thirst for knowledge

529
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:36,000
when it comes to computers and has ever since he was like five.

530
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
He's eight now.

531
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,000
I've given him a Linux computer, a Raspberry Pi,

532
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:44,000
helped him install on his computers over Thanksgiving.

533
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,000
His task was to take this Linux computer where the hard drive had died.

534
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
We put in an SSD together.

535
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
He's eight.

536
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
We put in an SSD together.

537
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
I watched him.

538
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
He did it himself.

539
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
That's so awesome.

540
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
He put the OS on there.

541
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,000
He goes, I go, Kai, which OS do you think we want?

542
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
And he goes, hmm.

543
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Well, XFCE is okay, but it's not as capable as KDE, I think.

544
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,000
KDE Neon is really capable.

545
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
And I love the way it looks.

546
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,000
I can customize it really well.

547
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
So let's go with KDE Neon.

548
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,000
Okay, buddy.

549
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,000
Let's download the image onto this USB stick here.

550
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Okay, good.

551
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:28,000
We're going to use DD and get that on there because we only rock the old school crap

552
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
when I'm training people.

553
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:32,000
And I'm like, okay, let's go.

554
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
Put it in the side.

555
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Make sure it boots from the stick.

556
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
You know how to make sure it boots from the stick?

557
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:39,000
Yeah, you just go in the BIOS and you switch it to make sure if it's not already booting from that.

558
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Okay, buddy, go ahead.

559
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
And this is old hat to him.

560
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
He's eight.

561
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,000
This is old hat.

562
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Like, yeah, dude, why are you asking me that?

563
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
It's the BIOS.

564
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
That's so awesome.

565
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
And then we boot into the OS.

566
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:53,000
He watches the KDE Neon install, you know, clicks the reboot, pulls the USB stick out

567
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
and everything, and he's just tooling around in there.

568
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:59,000
He goes, you know, I like the desktop with a little bit of a darker theme than this.

569
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:03,000
It comes with this light theme, and I'm not sure that's for me.

570
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:07,000
So he goes into the system settings and pokes a few and goes to the dark breeze theme, you know.

571
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:16,000
And I just walk away with a big smile on my face because that's a future CEO or software engineer or kernel contributor.

572
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:20,000
And so the answer is I do what I can.

573
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
That's all any of us can be expected.

574
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Share it to those who want to listen, yeah.

575
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,000
You do what you can.

576
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:30,000
You find the avenues, find your strongest soldiers and advocates, give them the weapons necessary,

577
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,000
and then, you know, you can help other people along the way.

578
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
What's wrong with giving somebody a Chromebook?

579
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
It's Linux and it's also Linux compatible.

580
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:41,000
And just make sure you send it to Matt so he can do the firmware before you give it to your mom.

581
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,000
I mean, come on, let's all be realistic.

582
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
Thank you, Matt.

583
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,000
Right?

584
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,000
I mean, come on.

585
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Yeah, for sure.

586
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
But that's the way to think, right?

587
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:56,000
The way to think is if I can't get you to be my software engineer and I can't get you to understand all of this,

588
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:01,000
how can you help your grandson?

589
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
You can help in this way.

590
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Linux is the disease that will never leave me.

591
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
It's the bug, isn't it?

592
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,000
It is, man.

593
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:14,000
One of my first mentors in photography said, oh, geez, Brent, I think you got the bug.

594
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
Yeah.

595
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
And it's hard to get rid of it.

596
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
It sure is, isn't it?

597
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Because the reason is because you see a task before you and you immediately think how best to solve it

598
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:30,000
is the open source toolkit that includes Linux and Friends.

599
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:39,000
Because your eyes have now seen this path, you can't go, yeah, well, I'm just going to buy some commercial piece of crap

600
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,000
and turn it on.

601
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:46,000
Your brain is like, well, this could so much be better solved this way.

602
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:51,000
And oh, I'm running into the limitations of this piece of hardware that's not really a hardware limitation,

603
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,000
it's a software limitation.

604
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Ugh, I needed to do this or whatever.

605
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:02,000
And pretty soon, if you've had exposure to the open source world, you're going to ask questions.

606
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,000
You're going to go out there on the internet, you're going to ask people, you're going to see what the thing is,

607
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:11,000
and then pretty soon you start working backwards from that and you only start buying hardware that's open source friendly

608
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
because you don't want to run into a wall.

609
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:21,000
Or when you do, you want to be able to rebuild the wall or stucco the wall or put a door in the wall.

610
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:25,000
It's not the wall that bothers us, it's the inability to tear it down.

611
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Or to do anything with it but stare at a wall.

612
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:33,000
Yeah, I think you've likely described the motivations for many of us listening.

613
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:40,000
You were telling me earlier that you were recently at Comic-Con, which is a huge thing, and I've never been,

614
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:45,000
and you hold a special place there for some people, which is, I'm sure, a nice feeling.

615
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:52,000
This is San Diego Comic-Con, we're talking about, like, I had been hoping for many, many years to play the Joker.

616
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:57,000
And Mark Hamill plays the Joker in a lot of video games and animated series.

617
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:06,000
And Mark was very busy with Star Wars and a few other things, and he just was like, well, he gets the first shot at playing it.

618
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:13,000
And he did not want to play that role for this particular animated series.

619
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:19,000
He was either a little too busy or he wanted to do another project or whatever as an actor, you know, he has a lot of things on his plate.

620
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:26,000
And so Warner Brothers turned to me and asked, will you be the Joker in Batman Hush, which is an animated movie?

621
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,000
And I was like, that's awesome.

622
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
Yeah, don't mess this up, Spezac.

623
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
And so I did.

624
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:40,000
I asked them if they wanted me to do something similar to Mark or what is the vein of the Joker because the Joker can be different stylistically.

625
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
Like, I also play the Lego Joker in movies.

626
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:47,000
I also play the Lego Joker.

627
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:50,000
I saw the scene with the spoon, which made me laugh.

628
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
Oh, Spoonie, tell me I'm the best.

629
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
You're the best Joker.

630
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Oh, yes.

631
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Yeah, so I play Lego Joker, but not in the theatrical release.

632
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:10,000
That was a guy from Saturday Night Live or I can't remember the actor's name.

633
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:23,000
But yeah, in a lot of the direct DVD movies and one or two games, the serious Joker, the animated movie Batman Hush Joker,

634
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:34,000
was a little closer to a cross between probably the Joker in The Dark Knight and Jack Nicholson somewhere in between those two.

635
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:40,000
There's a little bit of Cesar Romero thrown in there sprinkled because I grew up watching Cesar Romero as the Joker on the Batman TV show.

636
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
I'm old!

637
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
But not the goofy type.

638
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:53,000
There's this way of seeing what Cesar Romero is doing as kind of just unhinged and frightening in a way that can be construed goofy,

639
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:58,000
but I wanted to bring some of that unhinged menace.

640
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
Like, whoa, where's this guy going with this?

641
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:06,000
So yeah, I got to do, I got to be the Joker.

642
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
Oh, hello bats.

643
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
That sounds so frightening in my ears.

644
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
It was a lot of fun.

645
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,000
It was so fun.

646
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:18,000
There's a scene in Batman Hush where he's in the alley and it's famous in the comics.

647
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:26,000
Batman Hush, it's adapted from a comic graphic novel series and there's a scene in the alley where Batman,

648
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:32,000
I'm not going to spoil it for people who haven't seen it, almost breaks his code because the Joker has,

649
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
he thinks the Joker has done something.

650
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:42,000
And it was one of my favorite scenes ever as an actor to act because, you know, it's just wild and unhinged.

651
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:48,000
And there's this wild fight between the Joker and Batman where Joker's not really fighting.

652
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,000
Batman's just literally beating him up within an inch of his life.

653
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:57,000
And it's just, it was a very intense scene to do as an actor.

654
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:00,000
Yeah, and it was so great. It was just so great. Yeah.

655
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:05,000
It's so fascinating to me that you get to live all of these various characters.

656
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:11,000
Like you have to kind of become them, at least in your own rich imagination, right?

657
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:14,000
And to then tell their story.

658
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
Yeah, I have to.

659
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,000
I don't have a, I mean, there are some people who probably could,

660
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:22,000
I know a few of them that can just throw up, spin up a voice.

661
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,000
And I tend to do a lot of physicality.

662
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:30,000
I tend to do a lot of, you know, certain, hold my body a certain way

663
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:38,000
and move my hands and my face and everything because it's all linked together to me

664
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:42,000
to fully inhabit something because my job is to get you to never not hear Jason.

665
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:48,000
My job is to just have you not see anything or hear anything but the character.

666
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,000
And...

667
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:54,000
So when I do Forager on Young Justice, you can hear Forager's voice.

668
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
You're not hearing Jason anymore.

669
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:00,000
When you're watching this bug with six arms on Young Justice,

670
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,000
that's just what your brain is processing.

671
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:08,000
You're like, that's what a bug with six arms from New Genesis sounds like.

672
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:15,000
And the closer I am to me, the more imagination it takes

673
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:20,000
to definitely imagine that person in a circumstance that's different than mine.

674
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,000
It's different than me, right?

675
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:24,000
Like, it's a Wally circumstance on Young Justice.

676
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
His voice is pretty similar to mine.

677
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:30,000
You can hear his voice when I'm, you know, when my voice is going on a lot,

678
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,000
just my normal voice, you can hear intonations of Wally in there.

679
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:42,000
And it is difficult to explain but to make sure it sounds like Wally

680
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,000
and not Jason because they're different.

681
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,000
It's actually more work.

682
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:50,000
It's actually more difficult than to sound like something that sounds nothing like me.

683
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,000
Hey, inches above sizzling death, I'm entitled to speak my mind.

684
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:59,000
You know, Wally has a lot of energy and he's a lot, you know, very present

685
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:02,000
and, you know, goofy, a lot of the ways that I'm goofy.

686
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
And you bring yourself into every character.

687
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
I mean, even in The Joker, as frightening as that sounds,

688
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:10,000
you have nothing but your own psyche to process the imaginary circumstance

689
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:13,000
and so you have to do that.

690
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:17,000
You know, ultimately, it's coming through your AI running in your brain.

691
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,000
Next question.

692
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,000
I'm just kidding.

693
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,000
Next.

694
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:25,000
It just, I imagine that you don't ever run out of different voices.

695
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,000
Me?

696
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
Because of the rich imagination that you have.

697
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,000
No, no, no.

698
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:33,000
Yeah, my imagination has always been one of my greatest assets, thankfully.

699
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:39,000
There's no corner to which I don't love to retreat and pull up some wonderful sauce

700
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:42,000
and bring it with me in a bucket to the next moment.

701
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:49,000
I also feel like when I was young, I went on a trip to Disney World, Florida

702
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,000
to Epcot Center.

703
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:56,000
This was in seventh grade and it's really the first big trip outside of, you know,

704
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
close to my house I'd ever been on.

705
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:04,000
And we went to the Epcot Center and there's this little place,

706
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,000
I'm not sure if it's still there, I haven't been in a long time,

707
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:11,000
where it's like the Imaginarium, I think it's called.

708
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
And they were singing this song,

709
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:16,000
Imagination, and you're like, oh.

710
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:25,000
And as a kid, it was celebrating the aspect of your personality that can create,

711
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:30,000
that can become whatever you want, that can alter reality to become

712
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,000
what you'd like it to be, to make the world a better place.

713
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
All you need is your imagination.

714
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:39,000
And that's true. That really is true.

715
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
That's why it's so powerful is that it's true.

716
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
And yet also so often lost.

717
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
And I never forgot that.

718
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:50,000
It reinforced me at just the right time, maybe through luck,

719
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:55,000
to understand that my greatest power is my ability to imagine

720
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:59,000
things that are not yet here or things differently than as they are.

721
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:04,000
And it's a useful tool. It's a useful tool.

722
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,000
That's the seeds of innovation, isn't it?

723
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
I think so. I think so.

724
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:12,000
I'm also a fan of meditation.

725
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:15,000
For the last four years, I've been doing mindfulness meditation.

726
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:20,000
And it has helped me a lot, you know, to just be in the moment

727
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:24,000
and not treat anything as negative, whether your foot is sore

728
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:28,000
because you've been standing here talking to Brent in your studio

729
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:34,000
and you feel the walking down the street, the breeze against your fingertips.

730
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:40,000
And to be in that exact moment without your brain going anywhere

731
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:44,000
but right here has helped me focus.

732
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:47,000
It has helped me a lot to not get lost in thought,

733
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
some of which can be negative.

734
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:54,000
And instead, if the thought enters your brain, to not dwell on it

735
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:58,000
and to let it leave just the same way that it appeared,

736
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:01,000
it offers me a great freedom.

737
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:06,000
I have much more control over my emotions and a situation

738
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,000
and I'm okay to see where things go.

739
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:12,000
I don't have to think, oh, well, I feel super uncomfortable right now

740
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
and have to deal with the uncomfortableness.

741
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
I can just say, oh, well, I feel super uncomfortable right now.

742
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
I wonder what's about to happen next.

743
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:22,000
And it's really changed my outlook on life.

744
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,000
I would like to think that it's made me a better actor

745
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:28,000
and a better father and a better human being.

746
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:32,000
But yeah, so I'm a big fan of mindfulness meditation actually.

747
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:37,000
What a gift to you as a person to do it for yourself, right?

748
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
To impact all of those areas.

749
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:43,000
I was listening to Sam Harris and he's big into mindfulness meditation

750
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
and I was like, oh, that's interesting. Maybe I'll give that a shot.

751
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:50,000
And I didn't do it through his app or anything like that.

752
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
I had some, I have nasal polyps.

753
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:55,000
So you can hear that my natural voice has a little bit of a nasal tonality to it

754
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:59,000
when I'm not trying to get around that.

755
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:03,000
You can hear that my voice has a very nasal tonality to it when I'm not trying.

756
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:06,000
And that's because I have nasal polyps.

757
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:09,000
It's a genetic condition where the inside of your sinuses has growth.

758
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
Einstein had it, for example. Bill Clinton had it.

759
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:14,000
It's just a genetic condition.

760
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
So I had to have surgeries to cut them out.

761
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
So they use a laser endoscope to go up there.

762
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
They cut holes in my bones the very first time I ever had the surgery

763
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
and they just cut the growths out.

764
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:25,000
And I just need to keep having them cut out because they keep growing.

765
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:28,000
That's just part of my genome.

766
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:32,000
And the fourth time I had this surgery, I was in a lot of pain

767
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:36,000
and I just decided to take a little break from life, you know, just two weeks

768
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,000
because I'm bandaged up and I'm healing.

769
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:44,000
I read the Dalai Lama's Art of Happiness and I'm not a Buddhist,

770
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:47,000
I'm not a religious person at all, but there was a lot of stuff that spoke to me in there

771
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:50,000
and I was like, huh, he's been meditating since he's four.

772
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
He has these really cool perspectives.

773
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:55,000
Maybe I could try meditating. Maybe it will help me.

774
00:39:55,000 --> 00:40:00,000
And so I just began my practice and there was just no way for me to get my brain to stop.

775
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:05,000
I mean, shit, I can't even get my mouth to stop and I'm talking to you for four hours

776
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:10,000
and people are falling asleep and they've gone to go get coffee and make popcorn

777
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
and then they've come back and they're like, Jesus, Jason's still talking.

778
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:15,000
In that one sentence, there's no commas.

779
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:19,000
And I thought, how am I going to do this?

780
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:24,000
My brain, my thoughts are just always intruding on the present moment

781
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:27,000
and they're powerful, powerful imagination.

782
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:30,000
I'm very intellectual. I like to learn things.

783
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:34,000
And just gradually, the same way that you open a door

784
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:37,000
so that you won't make a creaking sound when a baby's sleeping,

785
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:40,000
you're like, I'm going to open the door just a little

786
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:43,000
and then just a little bit more and just a little bit more

787
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
and eventually the door is all the way open.

788
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:48,000
I think my door is half the way open.

789
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:53,000
First it was just seconds and then it was 10 seconds of peace

790
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:56,000
and then it was 30 and then it was a couple of minutes

791
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
and then it was, I can only do this when I'm walking.

792
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:01,000
And now it's like, oh, I can do this when I'm driving.

793
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
Oh, I can do this when I'm standing in line.

794
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
Oh, I can do this when this person's yelling at me.

795
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:12,000
It's just an eventual place that your mind, you make a space in your mind

796
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:22,000
and initially I likened it to like a gap, like if you ever watch an arc,

797
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:26,000
a spark, an arc between two contact points

798
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:30,000
and the further that gap is, the further the electric arc goes.

799
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:34,000
And I likened to the fact that the beginning of my practice,

800
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
the two contacts were very close together.

801
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:39,000
What would happen in the world would immediately happen in my head

802
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:42,000
and it would immediately come out and that could be thoughts.

803
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
That could happen to the world and I immediately have these thoughts

804
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
and I'd immediately embroil in these thoughts.

805
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:49,000
I was just widening that gap.

806
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:54,000
So what happens to me, I feel it, understand what's happening

807
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
and then I let it go.

808
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
I don't hold on to it.

809
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
I'm not holding on to this thought.

810
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
It's not circling in a spiral in my head.

811
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:05,000
I'm like, okay, that's interesting.

812
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
Now I created like a gap, a mini gap.

813
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:11,000
Well, huh, I wonder if I keep doing this, the gap will get bigger.

814
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
Well then eventually there's not really a gap.

815
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:16,000
What you're doing is something comes on,

816
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:21,000
it stays for as long as it stays like a sound, like a bell ringing.

817
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
When the bell stops ringing, the sound is gone.

818
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
You can't hold on to the sound any longer than that in your ears.

819
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:30,000
It's gone and it leaves.

820
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:37,000
So eventually it was more about going from a tiny little gap

821
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:40,000
between the outside world and my thought process and everything else

822
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:43,000
to letting it go completely.

823
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:46,000
Like there's no other contact

824
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:49,000
instead of there being two contacts really close together.

825
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
That's the only metaphor.

826
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:54,000
That's the only metaphor I have for what meditation did for me.

827
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:58,000
Yeah, but it puts it in a visual way that is helpful.

828
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:02,000
I've certainly dabbled in some meditation

829
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:07,000
and have known that it's one of the things I should probably do for myself regularly

830
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:10,000
that would help me the most.

831
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,000
How did you try?

832
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:15,000
I mean, did you do walking meditation, sitting?

833
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:19,000
What was that like, the attempt to practice?

834
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
I generally hyperfocus quite easily.

835
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:26,000
What I mean by that is like I can dive into something for three hours when I'm learning it

836
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
and then I forget about the world.

837
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:33,000
So I think that helps me to be able to sit still.

838
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:38,000
And so I have tried those kind of simple methods of just like, okay,

839
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:43,000
just sitting and watching whatever's happening on the inside.

840
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:48,000
And the first few times I did it, it went from, huh,

841
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:51,000
this is really curious to the second time I did it

842
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:55,000
or maybe not exactly the second time, but I remember distinctly one of the times I was like,

843
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:58,000
well, this is a really scary place.

844
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
I don't even know what's going on today, right?

845
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:05,000
And it was fascinating to just pause.

846
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
And that's what I found to be the most powerful.

847
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:11,000
Even if I can't pause my thoughts, I can watch them and it's like, okay,

848
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:16,000
that is a reflection of the state of being that I'm experiencing currently.

849
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:21,000
And even just getting that far was like, oh, okay,

850
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:27,000
this is telling me a lot about myself that I did not know when I'm just busy and busy and busy and busy.

851
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:33,000
I think the idea of examining the state is one that programmers can probably understand.

852
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:38,000
And anybody listening to this that you can relate to that, yeah, we are.

853
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,000
We're like just a big state machine.

854
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:44,000
And there's this idea that we're moving from one state to the next

855
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:49,000
and that your brain somehow comes along for this ride

856
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:52,000
and then it's changing the condition that it's under.

857
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:57,000
And that the driver of the car, you know, the thinker of the thoughts,

858
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:00,000
somehow is participatory in the machine state.

859
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:05,000
And the most interesting thing about meditation for me is there is no driver of the car.

860
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:11,000
There is no, there doesn't have to be, that does not have to participate in the state.

861
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,000
The state is just what it is.

862
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:19,000
And that was really weird to get to that realization and to see that or feel that

863
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:26,000
where the loss of self, even however temporary in my young practice of only like three or four years,

864
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:32,000
to feel the sense of self disappear and all that's left is the state.

865
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:35,000
People hear that and they go, you're just lying.

866
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
You're just, you're making shit up.

867
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
You want to sound like you're important.

868
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:43,000
You want to sound like you're cool and smart and doing something other people don't do

869
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
and whatever, hipster.

870
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:48,000
And I, it's the only way I can describe it.

871
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:53,000
Well, and if you speak to anyone who's done this for any significant length of time,

872
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:56,000
that's a theme that comes up over and over and over and over.

873
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:00,000
So it's like, well, you haven't all got in a room and agreed to lie about this thing.

874
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,000
There's something real going on here.

875
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
Maybe, or we all just share the same lie.

876
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:07,000
I mean, it could be that, you know, your brain's being convinced that that's what you're feeling

877
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
when you're not and yourself is leaving.

878
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:15,000
But there's super small and easy tricks you can do to focus your attention.

879
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:20,000
And then when your memory, like the thing that's running in the background,

880
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:24,000
remembering all your memories, whatever that's called, hippocampus.

881
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,000
I don't even know what the word is, whatever.

882
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:30,000
But whatever it's doing, you realize that you don't quite have a memory of anything else

883
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:33,000
but the sense of the sensation of whatever that was.

884
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:37,000
You don't have the memory of the fact that you were meditating.

885
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:41,000
Like, you do remember before, when you started meditating,

886
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:45,000
and you do remember before that moment when you were feeling comfort, whatever.

887
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:50,000
But then after, you remember what it was like to catch yourself and be like,

888
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,000
wait, what?

889
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:58,000
Your memory like takes us just a little, like it goes offline for a minute or two?

890
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:01,000
That can be very interesting.

891
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:06,000
I'm not saying that happens all the time to me, but that also is very interesting.

892
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
That's super rare.

893
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:13,000
You know, a really interesting metric that I've noticed for myself is that

894
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:17,000
I remember every single place that I've sat down to meditate,

895
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:20,000
whether it was for five minutes or 30 minutes.

896
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:26,000
It's that those experiences, as simple as they may seem from the outside,

897
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:32,000
become really powerful to the point where they're significant enough to remember.

898
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
Well, and that's funny because I do remember.

899
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:37,000
Like, I remember I was sitting in the car and I was driving to Phoenix

900
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:40,000
and my arms were right in front of me.

901
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:43,000
And I had this experience where I was just looking at my arms,

902
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:47,000
but they were no longer my arms, and I wasn't taking, you know, MDMA,

903
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:50,000
and I wasn't, you know, doing any fungus.

904
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:57,000
I was just like, not out of body, in body, that they were arms,

905
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:01,000
but they were not belonging to a person.

906
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
And it was really weird.

907
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:08,000
And I remember it because when I was like, I came out of it or whatever,

908
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:12,000
but I couldn't tell you anything else that was happening.

909
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:15,000
I couldn't tell you what was on the radio.

910
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:20,000
I couldn't tell you anything else about the experience except for that I know

911
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
that this happened.

912
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
You know, it was just weird.

913
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
Because I have a semi-photographic memory.

914
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
It's one of the ways I remember lines.

915
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:32,000
And so, my short-term memory is off the chain.

916
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:37,000
And, like, if I walk into a place and I can tell, like, what people are dressed as,

917
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:41,000
and if the cop interviews me, like, 10 minutes after it, I can be like,

918
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:45,000
this is exactly what everything looked like, and it's pretty darn close.

919
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:49,000
But give it a couple of weeks, man, does it start to fade away.

920
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:52,000
And then years, my brother has to remind me of something.

921
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
And I'm like, oh, yeah, I did that. I was there.

922
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:58,000
So that helps learning lines because I can look at the lines.

923
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
I can know what I'm about to say.

924
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
I can put the paper down and say it.

925
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:06,000
Super helpful in my line of work, right, on the motion capture stage

926
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:09,000
where you have to wear the motion capture helmet.

927
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:12,000
Like golemses, you have to wear the helmets.

928
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:15,000
And then you have to say, yes, precious.

929
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:19,000
And you're hopping around like a creature.

930
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,000
You can't have the script in your hand.

931
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:25,000
So, you have to memorize it.

932
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:29,000
So, lucky that that's just a benefit of the way my brain is constructed.

933
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:34,000
And it gets better with practice, but I've always had a memory good at it.

934
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:42,000
And it's interesting that that tends to sort of get fuzzy and weird in those moments.

935
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:46,000
Even minutes after, I should have been able to know what everything was going on.

936
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:49,000
So, there's a part of my consciousness that's online.

937
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:52,000
And when I'm meditating, it goes offline.

938
00:49:52,000 --> 00:50:00,000
That is linked to the perception data of that I'm collecting everything around me

939
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:05,000
to the point where I can tell you, yeah, well, she raised her hand just five minutes ago.

940
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:08,000
And didn't you see she had a bracelet on and she's wearing a pink sweater?

941
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
Yeah, she's right behind that guy, blah, blah, blah, blah.

942
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
And like you turn around and that's the case.

943
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:19,000
I've heard often that those who meditate often feel almost like it's a nap of sorts.

944
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:23,000
You know, the way we describe a nap to like go get a tiny boost of energy.

945
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:27,000
But it's like a totally different approach.

946
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
And what you're describing reminds me of that.

947
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:34,000
It's like, okay, all of these systems that are active 100% of the time that your eyes are open during the day

948
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:37,000
are just kind of shutting down in a very helpful way.

949
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
Yeah, I guess I never really thought it like that.

950
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
Like systems offline.

951
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:45,000
Jason's visual perception system offline.

952
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,000
Jason's memory system offline.

953
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,000
Conserving energy in suspend.

954
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,000
Loss of self.

955
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:54,000
But not only conserving energy, but going to a completely different place,

956
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
which is the fascinating thing.

957
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
I don't even know if this would be beneficial to anyone else.

958
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:02,000
I talk about it, I say these are the benefits that I have derived from it.

959
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:07,000
And even if it's psychological trickery and somehow I've managed to trick myself into this state of flow

960
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
while doing nothing.

961
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:12,000
State of flow while not flowing, while not doing something.

962
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:15,000
Except for concentrating really hard on not doing anything.

963
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,000
That it's different than flow.

964
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:23,000
And being that I derive this benefit is a fact to me.

965
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:26,000
Whether it's true or not, I guess, right?

966
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
It's just so weird.

967
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:32,000
I mean there's scientific studies on the brains of meditating people

968
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:36,000
and they have different wave patterns and they have different permanent states

969
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:40,000
that are different than the states of the brain of people who don't meditate.

970
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
So I mean there is scientific evidence for that.

971
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:45,000
I don't know the efficacy of the studies.

972
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,000
I don't know how the peer review has been.

973
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:52,000
But I imagine it would be neat to continue to study it.

974
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:56,000
To see if there's anything scientifically we can gain rather than just AI feel better.

975
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:59,000
Because there are people who put crystals all over themselves and feel better.

976
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,000
I'm not one of those people.

977
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,000
And I'm not one of the people who think, yeah, that's going to work.

978
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,000
They're all different tools, right?

979
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:12,000
Anytime you gather data about something, then you have at least a reasonable surety

980
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:18,000
that another human who engages in a given practice can get a similar outcome or result.

981
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:24,000
And so if you're hoping to help people, that can only help to have the data.

982
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:28,000
No knock on people who just love to put crystals all over themselves.

983
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:32,000
You don't have to give me the hate mail because I'm not on social media.

984
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:35,000
I'm not on Twitter or Facebook or Instagram.

985
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:38,000
I dumped all that stuff a year ago and I'm so much happier.

986
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:44,000
Could you think of one tip for someone who wanted to just kind of try meditation?

987
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:51,000
Not necessarily dedicate to it, but just give it like a quick try just to see?

988
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:55,000
I think Sam Harris's Waking Up app is actually pretty darn good.

989
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:59,000
I mean, I've used it also.

990
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:05,000
I shared it with my brother and my friend Nathan and they've gotten good results.

991
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:08,000
It's difficult to continue the practice.

992
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
There is no tip for beginning.

993
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:16,000
Yes, you can follow the first couple episodes and he's a great guide for it.

994
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:19,000
The trouble with like, show me how to work out.

995
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:20,000
Okay, great.

996
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:24,000
I put my bicep here, I lock it at my hip and I do a curl like this.

997
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:27,000
Okay, I make sure that when I do my shoulder press that the weight doesn't go too far behind my head.

998
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:28,000
Okay, great.

999
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:29,000
He showed me how to work out.

1000
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:35,000
Now, getting my ass to work out, that is a totally different story, baby.

1001
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:36,000
That's the hardest part, isn't it?

1002
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
I know how to work out.

1003
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:43,000
I don't know why I'm not working out because it's difficult.

1004
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:52,000
It's hard even though I do see some result when I do work out and that's the long tail of meditation.

1005
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:56,000
You know, I said it often that showing up is like 50% of the work.

1006
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
It is.

1007
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:05,000
And the cool part is you can meditate anywhere with just even seconds so you don't really have an excuse.

1008
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:08,000
You don't have to get your workout clothes or your yoga outfit.

1009
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:09,000
You don't have to do anything.

1010
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:14,000
You don't even have to be a quiet place really because you can start mindfulness by listening to horribly noisy things.

1011
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:20,000
So really, if you're looking at barrier to entry, it's low.

1012
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:25,000
I only need to buy a Fitbit and the right shoes and I can meditate tomorrow.

1013
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:35,000
So I feel like it's easy to begin and probably difficult to continue.

1014
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,000
Like all good things.

1015
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:47,000
Jason, if you wanted to put out a question to the community or even something you'd like them to try or think about,

1016
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:50,000
is there anything you want to throw out there for those who are listening?

1017
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:56,000
I would like to see people try to assess their digital independence.

1018
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:59,000
I would like for them to understand what it means.

1019
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:08,000
When the United States was formed and many representative republics, the idea behind it was the opposite of tyranny,

1020
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:15,000
was we are sick of being told everything that we can do, we can say what we can believe or whatever.

1021
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:26,000
And I really would like it if we could have some independence and interact with each other on humans as close to a level playing field as possible.

1022
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:30,000
Now, I'm fully aware that our country was founded by slaves.

1023
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:33,000
I'm a third generation American, so I wasn't even here for that.

1024
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:43,000
But the idea that our Constitution was written by people who were experiencing tyranny and wanted to escape that.

1025
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:50,000
That if you could say to yourself, well, we're increasingly living in a world that does not have boundaries.

1026
00:55:50,000 --> 00:56:01,000
I mean, the great firewall of China is there, but the internet exists and the ability for us to get from one place to another via plane and talk to each other and it's pervasive.

1027
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:05,000
So those type of boundaries are becoming less important.

1028
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:20,000
What's more important now is your digital freedom, your freedom to move ideas, your freedom to move value around without gatekeepers and arbiters and tyranny.

1029
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:33,000
It's so valuable as our species steps into the next millennium and things get increasingly away from using natural resources of the earth to move things around and just using ones and zeros.

1030
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:51,000
If you can explore the idea, the mental exercise of living in a world where your digital independence is as constricted as it would be in a world without a representative republic, a way to vote.

1031
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:56,000
Even though a lot of people think that may not have an effect, it does.

1032
00:56:56,000 --> 00:57:07,000
You're an incumbent and a whole bunch of people vote for someone else in the primary and you ended up not representing your party because they picked a different person from your party and they did what they incumbent did you.

1033
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:10,000
They primaried you. There's a fear there.

1034
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:14,000
There is a fear from the elected official that they could get voted out.

1035
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:15,000
Still exists.

1036
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:21,000
What would it be like in a world, a digital world, where those freedoms are gone?

1037
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:26,000
You don't have any choice what to use, what to think or read.

1038
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
It's being fed to you.

1039
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:40,000
You don't have a way to escape it because you have to do your banking and it's required and you have to do your job and this is required and you can't get away.

1040
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:48,000
Yeah, I mean, those sound like extremely powerful perspectives and a little bit scary in many ways, right?

1041
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:51,000
Yeah, I went all serious.

1042
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:58,000
I went 100% serious and then people are listening to that and they're like, well, I'm getting out the scissors now for a little self-mutilation.

1043
00:57:58,000 --> 00:57:59,000
Thanks, Jason.

1044
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:02,000
You're really great and I have to up my Zoloft dosage.

1045
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:05,000
I really appreciate your podcast.

1046
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:11,000
Mr. Spizak, just wait till I show up at your door with my unholstered rifle.

1047
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:15,000
Yeah, unfortunately, I don't mean it in a depressing way.

1048
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:18,000
I mean it in a just think about that.

1049
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
You don't want that.

1050
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:23,000
Like all of a sudden, I was like, don't think about that.

1051
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:24,000
You don't want that.

1052
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:27,000
You'd like to live in a world where you have some choice.

1053
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,000
Digitally, you have a choice.

1054
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:34,000
And right now, you think you have choices like in consumer products and everything.

1055
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:43,000
But once you get down to only a few handful of companies controlling everything, I mean, ask people who live in an area where they can only get Comcast Internet.

1056
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:49,000
And just magnify that times whatever products or services that you have to access.

1057
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:58,000
And believe me, every company wants a monopoly, even though it's really the worst way to do business and bad for a lot of things.

1058
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:04,000
They can be much more profitable if they don't usually, but it's easier not to compete.

1059
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
It just is.

1060
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:11,000
And open source has a way of ruining everybody's party.

1061
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:22,000
I mean, if you're a capitalist, if you're a capitalist in a monopolist or you're a corporation and you've got an open source competitor, you're like, ah, I can't get rid of this.

1062
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:23,000
What do I do?

1063
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:24,000
Sue them?

1064
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:25,000
What do I do?

1065
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:29,000
Well, look, nobody would use it if you were not a turd.

1066
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:32,000
So, you know, don't be a turd.

1067
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:57,000
Yeah, one thing I really appreciate about like throwing your mind in those imaginations, you know, to take them way over here, you know, to stretch them as far as they can is that it gives you the sort of energy or the perspective or the will to say, oh, OK, well, maybe we're not that far, but we sure are going down that road.

1068
00:59:57,000 --> 01:00:06,000
So what can I do in my own personal choices to turn that around to things that I actually believe in much more?

1069
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:18,000
I find that change requires energy and deriving energy from yourself and your own motivations is a talent and a personality trait.

1070
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:24,000
But I find that deriving energy from helping other people is almost universal.

1071
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:29,000
So there are many self-starters, there are many people who can just be like, I want to change.

1072
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:30,000
I want to change tomorrow.

1073
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:31,000
I'm going to do that.

1074
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,000
And they do that.

1075
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:51,000
But they're almost universally, if you're helping someone and the two of you are doing it together or the three of you or the 20 of you and you feel like you're not alone in this endeavor and you might be doing someone else good and helping them.

1076
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,000
For some reason, change isn't so hard then.

1077
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:57,000
I mean, you just described open source projects with the collaborations that happen.

1078
01:00:57,000 --> 01:01:10,000
It's like, OK, well, we may have met a few of the people that we're interacting with to create these projects or but there's this sense that you just want to make us all better in the process of collaboration.

1079
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:14,000
And as we've seen that that certainly happens.

1080
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:15,000
That's what you would hope.

1081
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:19,000
So if you're looking for the energy to change, do it for a fellow human being.

1082
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:20,000
It'll help.

1083
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:25,000
Thank you so much for bouncing all these ideas around and sharing your perspectives.

1084
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:30,000
And I've really I was really looking forward to doing this conversation.

1085
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,000
And the occasional silly voice.

1086
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:33,000
Yeah, yeah.

1087
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:40,000
And if you would give us one more silly voice of your choosing, it doesn't have to be silly.

1088
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:43,000
Would you have something in mind?

1089
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:44,000
I need to give you some context.

1090
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:49,000
I know I could do a really good Ollivander from Harry Potter.

1091
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:52,000
I remember every wand I've ever sold, Mr. Potter.

1092
01:01:52,000 --> 01:02:00,000
It's curious that you should be destined for this one when its brother gave you that scar.

1093
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:07,000
Oh, we do not speak his name, but he who must not be named did great things.

1094
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:11,000
Terrible, but great.

1095
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:14,000
Whatever. And I think it's clear we can expect great things from you anyway.

1096
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:15,000
Whatever that. Yeah.

1097
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:17,000
So I do a pretty good Ollivander.

1098
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:19,000
Do I pause now?

1099
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:20,000
No, you can do whatever.

1100
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:23,000
I mean, I could do just I could do voices forever, man.

1101
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:24,000
I love it.

1102
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,000
Of course. Well, I mean, it's it's it's in you.

1103
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,000
You can't get rid of that, I think, right?

1104
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,000
No, I'm possessed.

1105
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:36,000
Thank you so much for connecting with us in the first place, for sitting down with me and having a chat.

1106
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:37,000
I really appreciate it.

1107
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:40,000
And it's so great to know you're out there listening.

1108
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:41,000
That's that's for sure.

1109
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:42,000
So thank you.

1110
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,000
Yeah. So you better do a good job.

1111
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,000
Yeah, thanks.

1112
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:49,000
Can you give us a little outro to something real quick?

1113
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:51,000
Let's see.

1114
01:02:51,000 --> 01:03:00,000
You have been listening to Brunch with Brent, an incomparable smorgasbord of intelligent conversation and wit.

1115
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:13,000
If you desire to have more programs of this height of excellence, just log into Jupiter Broadcasting and you will find a plethora of such treasures.

1116
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:30,000
Till next time. Adieu.
