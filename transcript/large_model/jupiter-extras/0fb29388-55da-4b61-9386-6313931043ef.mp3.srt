00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,320
You ready? You ready? Here we go. I'm going to spin the wheel of topics for the live stream.

2
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:12,760
Hello, if you're watching. We are just hanging out here on a Tuesday, because we're not doing

3
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:16,600
LEP today, and so we're just hanging out with everybody. We have a Jitsi room open and our

4
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:22,200
mumble room is open if you'd like to hang out in the On Air channel with us. And Takalak

5
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:26,160
liked the orange one. He's just joined the mumble room. Hello, the orange one. How are you?

6
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:32,480
Hello. Hello. It's orange today, it's lovely. Yes, so we're going to spin the wheel of topics

7
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:46,760
and it is open to discussion for everyone. Here we go. And the winner is... The Ubuntu

8
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:51,320
Wag Remix. What is this? Well, we got a piece of feedback, I think it was two weeks ago,

9
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:55,360
someone saying, hey, have you guys heard about this? Have you played with it? Do you know what's

10
00:00:55,360 --> 00:01:01,520
going on with it? As far as I understand, there's a bunch of sort of web sites. Web

11
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:07,000
Remix. Yes, there's a typo in there. Web Remix. Yes, I am familiar with this a little bit.

12
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:14,080
And I just know it slightly and have dabbled in reading sort of the headlines on it. But

13
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,720
I think it would be interesting to dive in and see what it's all about. It sounds like

14
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:20,760
there's a small niche of people that are that are really getting around it. I know there's

15
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:25,840
some websites that are trying to tie into this, too, but that's the end basically of

16
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:32,960
my knowledge in it. Hmm. Hmm. Yeah. So it's got a fancy, it's got kind of a fancy look

17
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:39,320
to it. It's trying to find the name of the person who created it. But it's kind of you

18
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:42,800
could think of it as like an alternative to Chrome OS, I suppose. I think I have a screen

19
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:48,080
cap so I can put it up on the... Yeah, there we go. This is a nine to five Linux article

20
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:53,680
here. And you can kind of see it's got some some serious kind of it's like I guess it's

21
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:58,080
going on. It looks like GNOME Shell to me. From what I understand, the underpinning is

22
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:03,440
a bunch of web apps, right? Seems so. Yeah. Seems that's their deal. But they're sort

23
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:09,000
of as far as I understand, optimized to be used in this way. I could definitely see it

24
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:16,000
being appealing on a Chrome OS style machine. You know what I mean? I can see that. I was

25
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,640
just looking at their they got a they got a pretty simple website. Check this out. It's

26
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:32,120
at Ubuntu dash web dot org. And this is it. That's it. And this is like certified canonical

27
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:35,840
stuff, right? I don't know about that. No, I don't think so. Well, would they let them

28
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:43,360
use the name? Well, let's see. Would you want to be the company that goes around playing

29
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:48,160
whack-a-mole with haven't they done that in the past? I thought I think they're hoping.

30
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:52,700
So basically, I think the way it kind of I don't know for sure. But I think unofficially

31
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:58,920
the way it kind of works is if you're working towards becoming an official flavor. I don't

32
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:03,600
think they're going to raise this thing. I see. OK. But if you are out there popping

33
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:09,120
off and, you know, calling shuttle worth a bully or something like that, then they might

34
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:13,760
have a problem with it. So here's a little video of their it's like micros. Look, they

35
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:19,480
got a little button there to install the office three city five. You know, it's funny they

36
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:24,360
show that first. Well, it's it does make a point, doesn't it? It does make a point. And

37
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:28,040
then I guess they must add it to the launcher. Yeah. So now there it is in the launcher,

38
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:36,800
which is slightly cut off on the stream version. And I kind of I actually think that's a pretty

39
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:43,480
good demo, really. I don't really, for me personally, want this. Well, what's the use

40
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:50,240
case here? Well, low, low operating devices like low spec devices. Yeah. Or even older

41
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:56,280
laptops. I mean, if you think in terms of like it is, it is my wife's workload. Web

42
00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:02,200
apps are probably 90 percent of what she does use. Right. So for people that maybe do that.

43
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:13,200
Like I hate Web apps, so I minimize I minimize my usage as much as possible. Yeah. I don't

44
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,960
know, but I think it's a great project for that kind of use case since probably more

45
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:20,160
users like that than like you. Right. But I thought at least it would be interesting

46
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:24,600
to know it exists, wrap our head around a little bit and maybe have a look every six

47
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:30,200
months. Sure. Yeah, we should definitely check in. So Sab's asking in the chat room if we

48
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:40,200
have any thoughts on a product manager and hiring a gaming product manager. I think it's

49
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:45,640
a really interesting sign from Canonical. Yeah, we did talk about it briefly, I think

50
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:51,080
in the pre-show. Was it the pre-show of last year's Unplugged on Sunday? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

51
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:58,880
And we've been talking about it since a little bit. And I don't know, I wonder if it's like

52
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:03,000
the description itself seems a little bit like it's written by two different departments.

53
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:10,320
Yeah. And so I wonder if it's a small pilot project that they're doing to try to maybe.

54
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:14,880
My first reaction was like an OEM partner probably wants to ship a gaming laptop or

55
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:18,400
something. That makes sense. But how long would they be willing to wait for Canonical

56
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:24,720
to put their stuff together? They will wait sometimes. Hello, MiniMac. No, we're not recording.

57
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:29,400
We were just sort of since we're live, we're just riffing. We went in the on air channel,

58
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:36,160
but yeah. Can we join? Yeah. The other ones are in the lobby. Sure. Okay. Sure. So we

59
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:41,000
will. All right. Oh, do they usually sit in the lobby then? Yeah. Yeah. For the for the

60
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:50,720
upload. Yeah. Okay. Hey. Hello. Hello. Hi guys. Hi. So Brent made us a wheel of topics.

61
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:54,680
We were just kind of going through and talking about like a wheel of fortune style, prices

62
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:58,520
right style wheel that you spin. And you can send in your suggestions for other things

63
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:03,880
to do. Oh yeah. Does anybody want to add a that's a great idea. Anybody have a suggestion

64
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:10,400
for the topic, the wheel of topics? We should have put the gaming one on there. Oh, I heard

65
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:15,640
a bling. What was that? That's somebody in the thing with the that's always got it. Whenever

66
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:23,360
there's a sound, it's always gypsy that you can count on for sure. All right. So anybody

67
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:28,240
in the chat room or even the number of them have a topic. Let's add it to the wheel. Yeah.

68
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:35,120
I had my first experience with pipe over now. I just added by bio to my Ubuntu installations

69
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:40,920
and all in all, I'm really happy. And I, as others suggested when it comes to Bluetooth

70
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:47,920
connections with headsets, a paper is a huge, huge improvement. You can't imagine it's really

71
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:53,280
good. Some quality is better and connection problems are gone. So really good. Really

72
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:57,960
good. I think that right there is the reason it did so well in the taxis is a lot of people

73
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:06,600
are doing virtual meetings now. And, uh, my co-host Mike from Koda radio had, uh, had

74
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:12,400
a sales call where he had it got, he, you know, and he's using pulse audio and it disconnected

75
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:17,440
his Bluetooth headset in the middle of the sales call. And he's like, that's it. I'm

76
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:22,920
not using this ever again. I will only use the Mac for my sales calls. That's very embarrassing,

77
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:31,120
isn't it? Yeah. Um, but there is one thing. So if I go to Cody, I have somehow wonky sound.

78
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:39,960
So, uh, well, not that it is, um, stable, but it is like, Whoa, it's really wonky for

79
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:46,660
some reason. I don't know if it is the PVR plugin I use or didn't have extensive testing

80
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:52,120
now with movies I have on Cody because it was at the second residence. I will do some

81
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:58,280
tests here, but that's the only major flaw I see because Cody is a software that I use

82
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:04,440
daily here. And if I have that problem also here in my, I will stay in post audio in fact.

83
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:10,940
So here's what I've done is, uh, I've added things that Linux does great and things that

84
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:15,560
Linux sucks at that to the topic. Oh, I like this. Yes. So we'll have to talk about this

85
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:23,040
is like the daily conversation around here. Yeah. You got any other, uh, any other suggestions?

86
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:30,280
Any other suggest I, you know, I haven't, I haven't tried, uh, I haven't tried pipe

87
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:35,560
wire yet. And I wonder for those listening and myself included, what would be the easiest

88
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:41,720
way to kind of jump in and play with it without necessarily committing, um, fedora. Ah, of

89
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:48,880
course. What I can tell you, if you have open to LTS or even recent open to stare is some

90
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:55,600
three step procedure where you can in fact, install Piper along with pulse audio. And

91
00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:01,320
then it's like two, three command where you can switch back to post audio. It's basically

92
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:08,520
you install the components and then you turn off post audio with system CTL and mask the

93
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:15,640
post audio driver. And then you enable and load the pipe driver and that's all. So you

94
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:18,320
can switch with three commands and then you're back.

95
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:22,680
It sounds like you can even just script that into an on off button. Oh, sure.

96
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:29,440
Uh, yeah, basically yes. But I, the thing is that you have system components that are

97
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:34,780
loaded during boot and then you have to use the sessions. So it could be that you have

98
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:40,200
to log in, log out to make the pipe hour session or the policy was a post audio session booking.

99
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:46,000
I don't know if, if just a post audio dash K does work or if there is something similar

100
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,240
for pipeline, you know, pulse dash K is one of the best ways for me to get a Barry White

101
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,240
going on.

102
00:09:51,240 --> 00:10:00,760
Uh, so I managed to get the video feed piped into the gypsy room. So that's cool.

103
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:02,960
I'm fascinated by how it's backwards for us.

104
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:08,320
Yeah. You know why is because people are so used to looking in mirrors. It throws them

105
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:12,160
off. It's the selfie look. So they flip it around. So that way our little human brains

106
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:15,960
can deal with it. But when you're displaying texts, it sure is strange for us. But yeah,

107
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:18,840
so if you go in the gypsy room, you can hang out there too. If we're having problems with

108
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:22,760
mumble again and I'll have the video feed. So we've got, I put, I was just putting the

109
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:26,360
wheel of topics up. Should I give it a spin?

110
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,360
Yeah, I think she should go for it.

111
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:32,040
All right, here we go. Let's see what we're going to talk about. The wheel of topics.

112
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:42,960
Feel free to submit one, giving it a spin now. All right. And we have landed on things.

113
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:52,040
Linux does great. And I'll now remove that from the list of possibilities and we'll spin

114
00:10:52,040 --> 00:11:00,200
it again here in a moment. But things. Linux does great. You want to start? I got a few.

115
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:06,400
I have a trolly answer for you. All right. What is it combined? Use lots of power around

116
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:14,000
the world. Oh, all the cloud servers. Oh gosh. Yeah, we better ban that Linux. Right. It's

117
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:21,320
using too much power. You know, I really, I still to this day just love that you can

118
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:26,040
pick a Linux where you can have something that's just super quick to install or you

119
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:30,200
can have something that lets you define if a firewall launches and if you have SSH and

120
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:34,600
you have all these kind of little configuration options you can do. And I find that nice because

121
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:37,840
I do want to set all those things. And I like that there's distributions that give me that

122
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:41,800
choice. So I think we do really well at that. And then the other thing I think we're particularly

123
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:46,080
good at, in fact, I think we're way better than any of the commercial operating systems

124
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:54,600
at is we are willing to revisit plumbing and rewrite it like like system D, like firewall

125
00:11:54,600 --> 00:12:01,320
D, like pipewire, like Wayland, like all the new back end compositor stuff that the different

126
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:06,720
projects are having to write to support Wayland. Like we're willing to plumb that stuff again

127
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:12,840
and retrench where Windows just builds on top of legacy code in that anti code base

128
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:18,760
and layers and layers and layers and layers over it and builds simultaneous subsystems

129
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:24,680
and all kinds of just crazy wonky ass legacy spaghetti code. And while we're not immune

130
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:31,080
from it, I think we're way better about addressing that than Windows and also the Mac OS.

131
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:37,120
I think that might be a subtle weakness only in that it's up to us to stay current all

132
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:43,520
the time. Sure. I wonder if there's a lifelong if you're an AWS customer or you're consuming

133
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:48,880
rail and deploying it every five, six, seven years. It's not that bad, right? It's more

134
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:52,800
like if you're sitting in the position where we're at. Yeah, I suppose we have a unique

135
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:57,220
kind of look on this to strap in. Anybody in the mumble room have something that Linux

136
00:12:57,220 --> 00:13:05,600
is better at than all the other platforms? Well, yeah, no kidding, right? Yeah, I would

137
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:13,920
throw in as a user updates, upgrades and migration procedures. Right. I mean, we are really strong

138
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:22,480
with that. I mean, I just migrated a system and I can have a package lists and my repository

139
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:28,560
keys, copy them over and then do an installation procedure. And in like five minutes, I find

140
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:35,240
myself with the same system I have on the other side, just read a few commands and procedures

141
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:43,760
normally, normally the same. So keep on also keeping your system clean. I mean, yeah, DNF

142
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:51,540
and apps are really cool now with auto removing packages that are not needed anymore and everything.

143
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:56,120
So to maintain the system when it comes to packages and software, I mean, we are far

144
00:13:56,120 --> 00:14:02,200
better than than at least Windows. I have no clue for my for my for Max. I feel like

145
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:05,360
it's better. I feel like, you know, I have this neon install that's like from twenty

146
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:11,200
eighteen and it's still it runs just as good as it did the day I installed it. And same

147
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:15,680
with my arch box upstairs. It's from like twenty eighteen, twenty seventeen. And I don't

148
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:20,240
feel like it has like registry creep or anything like that. It still runs really good. Also

149
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:23,560
a mini Mac, just kind of doubling down on what you said from like a desktop standpoint.

150
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:30,640
I know I mentioned this just recently, but. When you boot up Windows or Mac, if you haven't

151
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:35,520
used it for like a week plus, man, you just get slammed with all these background processes

152
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:41,360
that are like checking for X and updating Y and indexing this, and it's just like a

153
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:44,880
shit show on your machine, especially the Mac, like the Mac has gotten really bad about

154
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:49,040
this because there's cloud photo stuff they got to do. And, you know, it's just gotten

155
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:54,880
really bad on Linux. Like, worst case, you boot up a desktop that you haven't used in

156
00:14:54,880 --> 00:15:00,840
a week plus and it for forty five seconds is going to update the package cache. I disagree.

157
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:07,460
Yeah, I have recently run into a bunch of times when. So I have a. I have pretty bad

158
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:12,400
Internet from modern standards at my place, so I notice these things. It's sort of like

159
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:16,320
when you're in the RV. Are you implying that I don't? Well, I'm implying that sometimes

160
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:20,760
when I'm in the RV with you, we don't. Yeah, I mean, there are times, but yeah. OK, go

161
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:27,400
ahead. And so I've noticed a trend towards the same thing that Mac and Windows are doing.

162
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:32,800
So if you look at unattended package upgrades, those are enabled by default. Oh, you're using

163
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:38,520
snaps. Yeah, no, not only on snaps, apt as well has unattended stuff going on, at least

164
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:44,160
on. Yeah, but not on any of my systems. That is that is combined with the software manager

165
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:48,920
package. And you can disable that. I know you can disable this, but I'm suggesting that

166
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:53,240
it's what I would say beyond that. But I would say beyond that, though, I guess I still consider

167
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:59,840
that not even really comparable because the difference there is it's it's like a unified

168
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:05,760
update mechanism versus every app you've ever installed has its own built in updater. Fair

169
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:10,120
enough. And that's just madness because there's no coordination. Like they're all competing

170
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:14,520
for resources at the same time. Right. So you're right. You do have more automatic updates,

171
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:20,880
especially with snaps and snaps is a separate process. But like say you're on the flat pack

172
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:26,280
GNOME software train. Right. That's all just getting updated by GNOME software or or the

173
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:30,520
command line. That seems better to me. You could update flat back separately and stuff.

174
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:34,600
But you're right. We do have more, especially with snaps and flat packs, more automatic

175
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:39,880
updates. But I don't mean any of my systems auto update just because of bandwidth. I have

176
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:44,640
to turn all that on. What I can tell you, I have a dual boot system on my laptop where

177
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:51,120
from like every month or so I boot up Windows 10 and there I have my hard drive spinning

178
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:58,320
for without acceleration for like 20 or 30 minutes and I'm doing nothing. I'm just watching

179
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:04,640
the blinking led of my hard drive spinning and I have no clue. I have no clue what that

180
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:09,520
thing is doing because I have no information at all. I have nothing. It's just spinning

181
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:17,280
and just blinking. And even though if you have to automatic the unattended upgrade running

182
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:22,160
on Ubuntu, that takes like five minutes and then you get that pop up windows. We have

183
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:27,200
these updates and then it does the updates and then after let's say 10 minutes you're

184
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:33,840
done and then your system runs cool again and your van is not vanning like hell. And

185
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:36,880
so we are much better when it comes to that.

186
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:42,120
One of my most frustrating experiences that happens regularly unless you know you turn

187
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:46,760
it off is, you know, you're in the middle. Okay, you're setting up for a show, Chris.

188
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:49,380
You're doing all this research. You know, it's like two hours before you're putting

189
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:53,360
all the things together. You're just in a flow and you're setting everything up. Sure.

190
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:58,600
And all of a sudden Firefox says, oh, we can't load the pages anymore. You have to just reboot

191
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:03,000
to apply all of the updates we did in the background. That's a thing. It's a thing.

192
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:07,920
Oh, my God. I've run into that in a few on a few systems now and it drives me insane

193
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:13,920
because I'm the kind of person who just hyper focuses. So if it takes me a bit to get into

194
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:16,840
something, but once I'm in there, I could spend hours and I free. And you got it. You

195
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:22,320
also have to off ramp. Yeah. And but then it's like this. Bam. No more. That's sort

196
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:25,920
of that's what happened to me this morning. Oh, it's the worst. I didn't get an off ramp.

197
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:33,080
So you know what I'm talking about. What? No, I'm in the flow. I'm in the flow. No.

198
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:35,600
Yeah. No, I totally. Wow. I got to say, I have not hit that with Firefox, but I could

199
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:40,680
understand why because it's doing like some sort of update thing. And but why can't they

200
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:44,960
just let the with the worst case you get with Chrome is it just gives you a little badge

201
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:50,320
that says you need to restart the browser to get the update, but you don't have to restart.

202
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:56,800
That is better. I would want it to suggest that and not make it so that my browser that

203
00:18:56,800 --> 00:19:01,480
I tend to have like a hundred. Is it not getting updated through app? Is it updating? Well,

204
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:06,840
I wonder if it's updating the and someone might know this more than I do, but I wonder

205
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:12,640
if it's updating all of the extensions. And because those have updated, they're kind of

206
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:16,520
in in this funny state now that, you know, when you load a new page, they're reaching

207
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:20,840
out the extensions. Like, isn't that something else, too? You can have applications that

208
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:24,720
are doing self updates in their components. That's what I mean. Yeah, it's getting a little

209
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:28,440
out of hand. It is. It is. And so you can turn that off. You know, you go about config

210
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:31,560
and turn it off. But the default is can we just mention this is another great reason

211
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:35,840
why it's nice not to have all of your damn applications in a web browser. Yeah, I'll

212
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:40,560
agree with that. Not to mention the overhead and CPU usage and memory usage and stuff.

213
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:46,500
OK, so last call. Does anybody have a like something Linux is great at compared to the

214
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:52,640
other OSes before we spin the wheel again? I think modularity. That's like, yeah, how

215
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:57,040
did that not come up? I feel like you just made it such a success, like in the marketplace

216
00:19:57,040 --> 00:20:03,720
as you can use the computer. That's like a huge, huge aspect. It seems maybe in hardware

217
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:10,600
for sure. What was that one? Lower, lower and lower in hardware. Oh, yeah, sure. Yeah,

218
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:15,960
right. It is great for breathing life. Just look at the pie. Has anyone tried to run windows

219
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:22,080
on a pie? Well, nobody does it, right? Because it's so awful. That's what I mean. Yeah. If

220
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:29,200
I can say something, it's great for music. All right. I think it's great for podcast

221
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:34,200
production, so I'll I'll get behind that. You mean for music production? Yeah, for music

222
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:43,960
production, because because I've got like I'm using Ubuntu and running Bitwig and a

223
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:51,240
host of other applications and through the jack through this jack subsystem for audio,

224
00:20:51,240 --> 00:21:00,480
we all work nicely together. Yeah. Yeah. What we can do with Jack and our mixer is unbelievable.

225
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:06,840
It's nice. It's like this mixer is just an extension of our Linux box. It's incredible.

226
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:11,880
And if this mixer ever died, I just buy another one, even though it's years old now. I just

227
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:17,440
buy an exact replacement because it's just it's wild that I can I can I can route the

228
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:24,520
audio in and outs in the mixer using Jack. I can wire my mixer using Jack. And it's just

229
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:29,000
and then the fact that Reaper also natively speaks, Jack. So any of the inputs and outputs

230
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:34,640
we create in Jack show up as audio inputs and outputs in Reaper. It's just you couldn't

231
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:38,240
even do it on other. It's what you were wishing about. Yeah. You just couldn't even do it

232
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:46,720
on a Mac or on Windows. Did you have this mixer before talking about mixers? I find

233
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:53,080
the mixer of our door. Oh, yeah. OK. Yes, I bet. I bet. I've heard it's really great

234
00:21:53,080 --> 00:22:00,360
for music. Yeah. I've never really given a proper spin, but I should. All right. You

235
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:06,000
know what time it is, then we have the Behringer X 32, but Behringer makes a whole line. So

236
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:11,360
if you don't need something as big as the X 32, you could like they have a 12 and eight,

237
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:24,120
I think, which this is the amount of inputs. All right. Let's spin the wheel. Oh, almost

238
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:30,880
went to Brent Stocker, right? But we have to. So this originated from another piece

239
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:34,680
of feedback that we got saying, hey, I think it might be really interesting to dive into

240
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:40,320
cubes. And I many years ago read about cubes and the calories and stuff when I was getting

241
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:46,200
interested in that. And I sort of forget what it does. So can anybody like refresh me on

242
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:49,840
that? I'll give you a super high level because I've used it like a grand total of twice.

243
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:55,040
So that's more than me. I'm no expert, but it is designed for the very super security

244
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:59,280
paranoid to isolate different applications and aspects of your desktop into their own

245
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:04,560
dedicated VMs. And then cubes tries to make that all usable. So like Firefox would have

246
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:12,560
its own VM and just total machine isolation. So you don't have to worry about, you know,

247
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:16,040
people stealing your data's. We should go look at their what their description is on

248
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:20,480
their website. I don't know. Is anybody in the mumble room giving cubes a proper or Jitsi

249
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:25,480
given cubes a proper? You should show that to to the Jitsi room there. What's that? This?

250
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:33,240
Yeah, the cube site. Sure. Edwards Nodin says, if you're serious about security, cubes OS

251
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:39,120
is the best OS available today. It's what I use. Does he really? I want to go ask him.

252
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:44,360
So, yeah, they're using Zen underneath Fedora, Debian or Windows. I didn't know about Windows.

253
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:51,320
Oh, yeah. Windows VM. Sure. Sure. Didn't you say that about Tails? Yeah, he may have changed

254
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:57,040
his opinion. Maybe he uses both. All right. So what is cubes OS? Well, there's the diagram

255
00:23:57,040 --> 00:24:04,560
for your brand. Oh, it's nice and simple. So you got an admin VM, you got your GUI VM

256
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:08,520
and then you got your template VM to launch different like built in distro options or

257
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:14,940
applications. Cubes OS is a free open source security oriented operating system for a single

258
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:21,760
user desktop. It leverages the Zen based virtualization to allow for the creation and management of

259
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:29,880
isolated compartments called cubes. So that's where the name comes from. Got it. Yeah. Cubes,

260
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:34,400
which are implemented as virtual machines, have specific purposes like a predefined

261
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:40,400
set of one of many isolated applications for like personal use or project use. Maybe you

262
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:47,360
need a specific network stack, something like that. It has what it calls natures. I don't

263
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:52,200
know about that. A full fledged stripped down virtual machine. Levels of trust from complete

264
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:57,160
to non-existent in terms of trust. All the windows from the applications or from the

265
00:24:57,160 --> 00:25:04,560
VMs are displayed in the unified desktop environment with an unforgeable color coded window border.

266
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:09,280
So the different security levels are easily identified. Oh, that's kind of nice though.

267
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:13,660
That is nice. Yeah. You know, this is a dangerous one and then they have down here at the bottom

268
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:19,920
of the diagram, they have the different colors of trust. And so I wonder if there are default

269
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:25,160
levels of trust that cubes defines on these apps. For some reason, trust it more or less.

270
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:29,320
You can modify that default. I mean, imagine if you're like a Bitcoin billionaire, right?

271
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:32,880
You're probably going to be pretty careful every time you open up that wallet. Have you

272
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:40,360
heard of split GPG? Utilizes split GPG to keep your private keys safe. Yeah. Is it like

273
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:50,800
a split GPG? I wonder if it's a GPG wallet of sorts. I don't know. Let's go look. Split

274
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:55,600
GPG implements a concept similar to having a smart card with your private GPG keys. Oh,

275
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:59,720
that's cool. So it's like something you know, something you have kind of thing. It reminds

276
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:05,480
me of those little devices. You have one upstairs in the closet kind of buried in there. I think

277
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:10,400
the YubiKey kind of thing. Yeah, the YubiKey. This is software based, I take it. Yeah, I

278
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:21,040
guess so. Yeah, that's interesting. So it says here that the idea is that one not so

279
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:27,280
trusted domain, like, for example, one where Thunderbird is running, can delegate all of

280
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:33,960
its crypto operations, such as decryption or encryption and signing to another more

281
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:41,720
trusted network isolated domain. Are you following this? Trying. So Thunderbird, which is probably

282
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:45,200
a risky app, right? Because it connects to a bunch of different places. And you're downloading

283
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:50,880
emails that contain malicious URLs or whatever like that, right? So Thunderword's in your

284
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:58,680
work email VM. Then when you go to use it to do a GPG operation, like say sign an email,

285
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:04,840
which I wish we all did as a matter of practice to tell you the truth. Yeah. It will use this

286
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:12,440
split GPG system to actually conduct the signing and cryptographic operations in a separate

287
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:16,400
VM that is more isolated and more trusted, which from the color. Yeah, I could tell it's

288
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:20,440
trusted. They've even color coded the little diagram there. That is nice. That is nice.

289
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:27,040
Cool. I mean, that is really slick. You got to admit that's a pretty clever solution.

290
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:32,440
It sounds well thought out. Yeah. And I wonder, I can't, I'm getting interested in wondering

291
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:36,280
how this might be to run. I mean, this seems like your speed to be honest with you. Okay.

292
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:41,480
When I'm traveling, I just kind of like, right. I have a USB key and I run this, huh? Yeah.

293
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:47,920
Especially if you get a fast one, fast USB. Has anyone tried this? So I think it's too

294
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:52,520
much work. I think people worry it's too much work, but what they're attempting to do is,

295
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:56,480
is to make it built in and kind of work out of the box, right? That's the whole idea.

296
00:27:56,480 --> 00:28:02,560
You could build this yourself. I'm imagine, but that would be an undertaking. I mean,

297
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:06,000
it's an amazing piece of engineering, but I think you have to be as smart as Edwardson

298
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,760
to really run it correctly. So I'll be just fine is what you're saying. Yeah. I wonder

299
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:14,720
if silver blue is a better in the, in, you know, middle ground maybe. I don't know. Mini

300
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:19,600
Mac asks a good question and that is how do the app updates work? Like do you update a

301
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:24,200
whole VM to get Thunderbird up to date? Like how does that? Yeah, that, that was my thing

302
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:30,080
because, uh, you talked about, uh, Brent talked about Firefox updating itself, which is a

303
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:36,360
security problem. Sure is. So are these VMs read only? So if you put that up, do you know

304
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:43,440
that the applications that no one can change in fact that VM and you only have a part of

305
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:48,040
your home directory where you have all your data or how does that work? I guess if you

306
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:53,960
got really nitty gritty, you could have almost like firewalls in each VM that only let through

307
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:59,600
trusted, uh, domains. This seems like an opportunity for you to like, you know, try this and let

308
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:05,640
us know, you know? Oh, I see. I see. I'm just saying I'd like to know. I remember when,

309
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:12,280
when it comes to security, the early Linux days, we sat, burn yourself a not big CD rom

310
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:18,340
and put that one over, you know, that there is no access to the applications. Nothing

311
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:25,280
can be changed on the operating system. Yeah. Good point. Yeah. The, uh, the good old days

312
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:30,960
in optics, you're gonna, you're gonna use quick MU right now to, to launch a cubes VM

313
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:36,360
and just try it out. Right. How deep down can we go? Right? Um, anyways, that's a topic

314
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:43,320
that I think is worth maybe it could be playing with. It's maybe more on the technical fun

315
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:49,160
side of things and less on the useful everyday. So things, but I think worth keeping Brent

316
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:54,640
visits cube OS land and we find out, should I go to Quebec to visit cubes from, from quick?

317
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:59,920
No, you didn't have to do that, right? No, it's, but I'm in Quebec city. All right. You

318
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:04,080
know what? Oh, you know what that music means? Wait, before spinning, do we have any other

319
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:08,840
suggestions? Oh yeah. Anything else we should add to the wheel? We can't let the wheel get

320
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:13,320
empty. Well, we could in the streams done, you know, like when they went, we'll run out.

321
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:16,960
There's incentive. The more you suggest the longer we're on. Yeah. If you've got an idea

322
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:21,760
for the wheel for a topic for us to discuss, it could be about anything I suppose. Yeah.

323
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:32,680
Um, and we're done. Yeah, there it is. Although hopefully there will be one day. All right.

324
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:35,520
We're going to spin it, but you can drop a, you can drop a suggestion in the chat room

325
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:58,000
or remember to see. Here we go. Here we go. Oh, oh, oh no. Okay. Bitcoin node set up.

326
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:03,300
So let's see, Jesus, the background deleting this one off this, right? So you can run your

327
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:07,600
own Bitcoin node. What, when, what that is, is basically it's like a transaction processor

328
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:11,400
and you can have, it's a great way to kind of bypass having to pay heavy fees, but it

329
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:17,240
also helps decentralize the Bitcoin network. But what I was coming across recently is a

330
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:25,600
really neat open source project called umbral, uh, and umbral, which is get umbral, get a,

331
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:33,880
which is spelled G E T U M B R E L dot com. Am I saying that right? Probably. It is both

332
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:43,580
a personal server deployment platform and a self hosted Bitcoin wallet and Bitcoin node.

333
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:48,920
So one of the things you can do is you install it. Uh, they distribute it as either a raspberry

334
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:55,240
pie image or a setup script that is pretty much really only usable on Ubuntu or Debian.

335
00:31:55,240 --> 00:32:01,400
But when you get it set up, which is pretty easy and pretty quick, it creates a Docker

336
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:08,720
environment that is using nginx to do a proxy. And then inside that Docker environment, there's

337
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:13,160
the master image of umbral. And then it has an app store of open source free software

338
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:18,440
where you can install things like next cloud or photo prism or a bunch of really nice Bitcoin

339
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:25,080
uh, data exploit exploration tools because as a node, it actually maintains a copy of

340
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:31,520
the Bitcoin blockchain. And so you get to use some of the open source software to generate

341
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:36,860
interesting analytics and charts and your own data on that. It also allows you to install

342
00:32:36,860 --> 00:32:43,000
things like, um, a wallet, a web wallet. So you could create family wallets on here. You

343
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:48,040
can generate reports from the blockchain. Uh, you can install pie hole home assistant.

344
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:51,120
It gives you access to all of that. And what it's doing in the background when you install

345
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:56,760
these quote unquote apps is it is deploying a container and it's managing that container

346
00:32:56,760 --> 00:33:00,400
for you. So that's why you have to use their setup script and either use the raspberry

347
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:06,500
pie image or use it on like an Ubuntu or Debian box. I tried it on tumbleweed system and their

348
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:11,160
script just makes too many assumptions about a Debian system and doesn't work. But once

349
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:18,160
it's up and running, it's all basically engine X and Docker. What was impressive to me was

350
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:23,520
how it was linking all of those apps, right? Yeah. And it knew that you're running a node

351
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:27,200
and it was pulling the information from there. So it seemed really well integrated from what

352
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:33,480
we saw so far. Yeah. Everything is set up to use your own node as the source of truth

353
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:38,640
for information about the Bitcoin network. And that is really nice and fast too. And

354
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:41,760
they're all aware of like where its status is and stuff like that. But the other thing

355
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:47,800
that's neat is there's a series of cryptocurrency wallets out there that allow you to define

356
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:53,280
your own Bitcoin node too. So they'll use that for their transactions and whatnot. So

357
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:58,880
it lets you deploy like a handful of really common self-hosted applications like next

358
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:05,280
cloud with a handful of probably some of the best Bitcoin web based management tools. I

359
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:09,800
saw Home Assistant on there. Yep. Home Assistant is on there. Matrix is on there. Element is

360
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:14,280
on there. I don't think I saw a Bitwarden. Bitwarden I think is actually on there. I

361
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:17,580
think it might be. Yeah. It seems like it should be. So why do you think they decided

362
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:23,440
to build sort of a VM deployment platform on top and then... Container deployment platform.

363
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:29,060
Yeah. Okay. Fair enough. And also to focus on these applications instead of using something

364
00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:34,600
that was already out there. Well, I think job one is to be a Bitcoin node, right? And

365
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:38,280
so that's where it started. And then they realized because their environment was basically

366
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:42,760
a series of containers that it'd be pretty easy to just pull in these other containers.

367
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:45,960
And they're just pulling in like the Home Assistant's projects. It's not like their

368
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:49,680
own... Fair enough. It's not that much work. Yeah. I mean, it's probably some for the integration,

369
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:54,880
but it's not a ton. And then the other thing it does is if you want, it connects to the

370
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:59,680
Tor network and gives you your Tor URL. So essentially you could leave it behind a NAT,

371
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:03,920
leave it behind a firewall, but still connect to it to see what's going on over Tor or over

372
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:12,080
your LAN. And then they monetize the project by selling this really nice looking little

373
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:20,880
all aluminum Umbral server with a little display on the front of it. And if I had stupid money,

374
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:24,140
I'd probably want one of these. Because I tell you, I decided to take a look at this

375
00:35:24,140 --> 00:35:30,040
just this last couple of days and I'm very, very impressed by it. It's really a nice little

376
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:34,120
package they have. So I'm sure their little server would be pretty great too. Oh, look

377
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:39,320
at that too. You can get it in different colors. Nice. That's kind of neat. How about an orange

378
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:47,040
one? I'm having a hard time. Are those... Those are just kind of graphics, right? They're

379
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:51,920
not actually devices. Like it's not a photo. It's a graphic that they made. I can't quite...

380
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:57,480
Probably. It's hard to tell. But now that I walk up to it, I've got some, let's call

381
00:35:57,480 --> 00:36:04,880
it photo investigational work for you. You ready? Sure. All right. So this was taken

382
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:11,120
on not a great camera. I am zoomed in quite a bit. I know. That's fine with me. But it

383
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:16,800
also has some artifacts that give it away. So I will point them out for you. Okay. Here

384
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:24,800
we go. So to the left. I gotta yell a bit because I don't have a microphone here. But

385
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:30,200
to the left, you see where my mouse is right here? This is a piece of dust on the sensor.

386
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:34,760
So they're using a DSLR. And there's another one just over here. See, it's like a smudge.

387
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:38,800
They didn't even bother to take that out. Total amateurs. Another one there. Another

388
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:46,440
one there. So... It's also like a little dirty spot on the... On the actual... Unit right

389
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:52,200
there under the umbrella. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So it's a dirty camera. Dirty photo.

390
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:57,480
Very dirty photo. But it's a real device, I think. So that's kind of cool. I wouldn't

391
00:36:57,480 --> 00:37:01,520
mind one of these if I was really into the whole, you know, like having a family wallet

392
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:06,040
and all that kind of stuff. I'd love a banana to figure out how big that thing is. It does

393
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:14,720
need a banana scale. I don't know. Sorry about the stream. I, you know... Things broke. I

394
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:21,640
guess I just... What happened? You seem all deflated now. I am because you can put so

395
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:25,040
much work into this kind of stuff and then just something else breaks later. So you get

396
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:30,680
one thing fixed and then something else completely... Isn't that the theme of the day? And I just

397
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:34,120
find a little deflating. Do you want to spin the wheel then? Yeah. I think that'd make

398
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:56,960
me feel better. I think a different topic. Okay. Things Linux sucks at. Hmm. Okay. Things

399
00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:04,280
Linux sucks at. What do you think? What do you think Brent? I'm tempted to say cohesion.

400
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:11,960
Sure. Sure. Sure. Yeah. Yep. Consensus. Sucks at consensus. That's a difficult one though.

401
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:17,200
Yeah. Because it's also partly its strength. If there isn't consensus, a bunch of people

402
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:22,040
go out and try to solve the same problem in different ways. And in the end, I think we

403
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:26,040
end up with a better solution typically. Maybe not always. Yeah. It's a messier process.

404
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:32,360
Yeah. Right. But yeah, definitely. I don't know. Mumble room or jitzy room. Anybody have

405
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:39,240
a suggestion for things Linux sucks at? What does Linux suck at? Transitions. I've got

406
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:45,560
the Wayland session. It's just... True. It's getting there. But everything, if you compare

407
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:50,880
it to say Apple and all the file system, they make a decision and it just seems to just

408
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:58,080
go through basically your comments that you've had on the whole Apple stuff. Like when you

409
00:38:58,080 --> 00:39:03,160
stop and you look at how long will it take before Mint is on Wayland and Pipewire? What's

410
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:07,760
that timeline going to look like? It's going to be a while. Do you have any predictions?

411
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:13,360
I think a couple of years minimum. Sucks at supporting fingerprint readers. That is often

412
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:19,080
a problem. On my ThinkPad, I'm happy to report on my ThinkPad X1, it has been very good now.

413
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:22,880
So it is getting better there. Also, you can suggest a topic for the wheel. We're getting

414
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:27,560
down to the final three topics. So if you want to put something on there to keep the

415
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:34,200
stream going, suggest in the chat room or in the jitzy mumble room. Things that Linux

416
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:40,520
sucks at. Things that Linux sucks at. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, this drives me crazy. Multiple

417
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:43,640
external monitors at different resolutions and refresh rates. Have we not figured this

418
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:47,240
out yet? It just stinks. Just stinks. Are there any distributions that are better at

419
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:52,920
this than others? No, there are window managers that are better at this. I just have to mention

420
00:39:52,920 --> 00:40:00,960
enlightenment as always. I didn't see that coming. I didn't think you'd say that. Oh

421
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:10,720
man. Yeah. I just tested that one. I was at my second residence and they have a USB 2 monitor.

422
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:17,000
And then I have to connect that one. I need a little script to make it run. But with GNOME

423
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:23,320
three, it doesn't run at all with enlightenment. It just pop ups. It pops up a second screen

424
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:32,040
and you can configure it easily and it remembers your configuration. It just works. That does

425
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:39,240
sound nice. That does sound nice. I will have to eventually break down and give it a go.

426
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:44,360
Things that Linux sucks at things that Linux sucks at. Video editing. Okay, yeah, sure.

427
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:53,080
Go ahead. Deep learning on NVIDIA cards. Oh, interesting. I thought that was actually kind

428
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:59,760
of a big area. You just saying it's bad at it. Well, once you get the NVIDIA card working,

429
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:05,360
but then every update, you know, it just breaks. Right. Yeah. I feel like it's NVIDIA that's

430
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:13,160
the problem there. Yeah, right. Right. I mean, GPUs in general. Anything GPU with NVIDIA.

431
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:17,560
Yeah. I mean, that's a big point. Like, why? Why is it so terrible at GPUs? It's kind of

432
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:23,880
not our fault, maybe. Well, here's where we so here's where we get stuck a lot. I could

433
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:29,360
be wrong about this, but I think a lot of times it's there's a bigger ecosystem that's

434
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:34,400
pushing people to use these tooling and we're just not particularly good at it. Like CUDA

435
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:40,960
is an ecosystem. It is a whole frickin thing. It's one of NVIDIA's most, I think, savage

436
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:46,640
moves in the industry is really building out dependency on CUDA because CUDA only works

437
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:50,480
on NVIDIA cards. And so I think that's got to play a role. Right. If you don't if you

438
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:54,840
don't have first class CUDA support, then you're kind of SOL if your CUDA support is

439
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:59,640
fragile like the Mac has no CUDA support. And so you have entire industries that just

440
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:05,600
avoid buying Macs because of that. It's that kind of kind of an ecosystem. Well, I can

441
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:11,720
say something to that. I mean, I'm a software developer and I've done implemented CUDA numerous

442
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:22,160
times. The CUDA libraries per se on Linux work first class in any with any programming

443
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:29,920
language I've used. It's just the it's just the driver support and NVIDIA's policy on

444
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:40,040
pushing up, pushing updates which just break everything. That is frustrating, isn't it?

445
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:46,160
I just set up my son's laptop on Fedora over the weekend and then did an update and it

446
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:50,840
broke his NVIDIA driver and he had to leave and I just didn't get it working before he

447
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:56,920
got before he had to go. And so he has it. It's as a you know, a nice Ryzen integrated

448
00:42:56,920 --> 00:43:04,320
GPU, so he's fine. But it's frustrating because it was working and then it broke there at

449
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:10,160
the end and I ran out of time to fix it. And I don't know, you know, and it's particularly

450
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:16,440
rough on Fedora because historically their NVIDIA GPU supports been bad. And so as a

451
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:24,840
result, there's 50 different ways and a thousand different guides on how you should install

452
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:29,680
the NVIDIA driver. And they are all very version specific. So and it's different with the later

453
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:33,840
versions and it is the older versions. But there's so much momentum on that stuff. So

454
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:37,460
that's maybe an area that Linux sucks at there is and that's something the Linus Tech Tips

455
00:43:37,460 --> 00:43:43,680
videos touched on, too, is like. There's thousands of guides out there and most of them are no

456
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:49,200
longer applicable, but yet they're still relevant in Google search. And then there's also just

457
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:54,680
like tons of blogs and like distro rundowns and shootouts that are just nonsensical and

458
00:43:54,680 --> 00:43:58,160
totally not based on reality. And that's a problem, too.

459
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:01,120
I have another one. Monetization.

460
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:05,920
Yep. That's definitely an issue which leads to developer burnout. It leads to people having

461
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:10,240
to get other work and it leads to our best talent getting basically sucked into large

462
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:15,160
corporations that can pay people. And then it's corporate controlled and centralized.

463
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:19,440
Not to mention how precarious it is to have these projects be on the brink of failure,

464
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:22,440
financial failure, and they're propping everything else up.

465
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:29,040
And think about how stressful that is on a person over five, 10, 15 years to live that

466
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:36,720
long in a financially precarious position, feeling like you have this community to support

467
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:42,800
and people using your software and a responsibility to that plus your name, but also at the same

468
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:49,720
time not getting enough to actually financially thrive and just to have to kind of barely

469
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:54,880
get by. It can be rough on a person and we don't have a solution for that and it keeps

470
00:44:54,880 --> 00:45:00,820
biting us in the ass in sometimes really large ways like log4j and sometimes in really small

471
00:45:00,820 --> 00:45:06,400
ways that we don't even really realize. It just sort of gets priced into the desktop.

472
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:10,800
Feels like every six months we see the same story come up just with a different project.

473
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:15,240
And mini Mac, of course, there's a classic area where Linux is weaker at.

474
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:21,560
Yeah, that's my general approach. So if people switch to Linux, the first thing they see

475
00:45:21,560 --> 00:45:27,720
is that there are missing apps they have to adapt their workflow because they can't do

476
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:33,080
things like they're used to do it. But after time it becomes a strong part of Linux because

477
00:45:33,080 --> 00:45:39,040
you can adapt your workflow exactly the way you want to do it because on the Windows normally

478
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:45,720
you just have some apps and you combine these apps for your workflow and then really working

479
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:51,520
over your workflow and adapting it to Linux becomes a strong part in the end and then

480
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:58,000
often you're faster and you're getting used to it and you don't want to go back. But it

481
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:02,600
takes some time. It takes some time. You really have to dig into it for the first month and

482
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:07,240
then you start smiling and you never stop smiling, right?

483
00:46:07,240 --> 00:46:12,600
I wouldn't say that's necessarily a downside to the Linux ecosystem itself because let's

484
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:15,960
say you reverse things and you were on Linux and you got a new job and you had to move

485
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:21,920
to Windows, which has happened to me. It's just as painful. I would argue it's more painful

486
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:25,520
to try to find the things you need in that ecosystem.

487
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:32,600
Yeah, I was going to say that because I started using Windows for work after 10 years.

488
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:40,800
I'm sorry. I started using Windows for work after 10

489
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:49,840
years and it's really hard on me. I mean, you really need to work yourself again.

490
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:54,520
We need a Windows support group. You know, the dangerous thing about Windows

491
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:59,720
is I have to really reinforce this with Dylan whenever it goes into the Windows side of

492
00:46:59,720 --> 00:47:03,840
his install. It's like you really need to be careful what you're downloading because

493
00:47:03,840 --> 00:47:07,960
he goes to like download stuff from Minecraft and three out of the four links are scams.

494
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:10,920
It's a landmine everywhere. I forgot about that.

495
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:15,120
That's bad. So anyways, moving on. Now that we've come

496
00:47:15,120 --> 00:47:19,040
complete circle and gotten back to what Linux is good at, let's spin the wheel again. I

497
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:21,400
added a last minute topic. Did you really?

498
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:24,960
Yeah. I hope this is the last one, but we'll see. It's why Linux will win at all at the

499
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:29,520
end, like 20 years down the road. Well, okay. When that comes up, I'll get right into it.

500
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:33,000
All right. So are we ready to spin it again? I feel ready.

501
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:37,500
Okay, here we go. I want to mention one thing. One overarching

502
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:43,200
theme is that Linux just sucks at running proprietary software in general. You're complaining

503
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:48,800
about people not being able to use certain applications or the Nvidia proprietary drivers

504
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:53,640
terrible that kind of seem to be the overarching theme is Linux isn't great at running proprietary

505
00:47:53,640 --> 00:47:56,060
software. It's true, but that's not always true. Like

506
00:47:56,060 --> 00:47:59,800
reapers running just fine. Yeah, some user land stuff. It's better in the user land.

507
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:04,800
The deeper into the stack it goes, the more trouble it causes. All right, here we go.

508
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:15,800
Oh, I'm going to spin it again. I want to save that one for the end. I want to end on

509
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:31,440
the day. Here we go. Here we go. Come on. Keep it going. Oh, you're looking at me like

510
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:35,600
why did we have this? No, no. I mean, I'm sure people have written in and asked, right?

511
00:48:35,600 --> 00:48:40,960
Well, yes. And also it inspired me last time when we were talking flat packs and just to

512
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:47,400
hear I was William was his name. I forget now, but he was running. He's the software,

513
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:51,280
the head software guy at Endless. Do you remember we had an interview with him and he was saying,

514
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:58,640
oh, I'm running 174. Yep. Yep. I read a lot about Endless, but maybe like four years ago.

515
00:48:58,640 --> 00:49:03,120
And it sounds like they've done some interesting technological choices to help them achieve

516
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:11,480
their goals. And it just got me interested. Like I didn't expect them to be so front of

517
00:49:11,480 --> 00:49:15,520
the technology stack maybe is the way to put it. But it sounds like it's really working

518
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:20,680
for them. So I just got really curious into how far they've come in some of what they're

519
00:49:20,680 --> 00:49:24,680
trying to do. And I've known some people who've known some people who've worked there and

520
00:49:24,680 --> 00:49:28,840
I've said some really nice things. So I thought, hey, let's dig in. I know I've noticed in

521
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:34,920
like the GNOME and GTK commits that there's almost always several Endless staff, one or

522
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:38,280
two Endless members. That's good to know. Yeah. They're pretty active contributors.

523
00:49:38,280 --> 00:49:45,340
Nice. They seem to get they seem to be getting fairly along fairly well with GNOME developers.

524
00:49:45,340 --> 00:49:51,360
That's an achievement. Yep. And I've never really gone more than 15, maybe 20 minutes

525
00:49:51,360 --> 00:49:56,160
with it. When they first came along, they were first very hardware focused. OK. And

526
00:49:56,160 --> 00:50:00,540
now they've kind of pivoted to the software. And I think that's a good idea. When I first

527
00:50:00,540 --> 00:50:03,680
interviewed them, they were actually really kind of pitching at schools and prisons. I

528
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:10,360
remember that. Yeah. But I kind of feel like now that they've now that they've had this

529
00:50:10,360 --> 00:50:14,280
new focus for about a year, it's probably time for a revisit. But what I can't what

530
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:18,960
I can't suss out is if there's interest in the audience or not. I can't tell. I'm not

531
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:25,660
sure it's focused on us as an audience. And though I wondered, could it be focused on

532
00:50:25,660 --> 00:50:30,520
some of our children, for instance? So I recommended to my co-host on Coder Radio, Mike, that he

533
00:50:30,520 --> 00:50:33,840
was looking for a Linux OS for his kid. And I said, well, if you're not going to go with

534
00:50:33,840 --> 00:50:38,360
the desktop OS that you use, you know, which is pop, then I think maybe you should consider

535
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:43,520
Endless. I'd say my first choice would be go deploy whatever OS you're comfortable using

536
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:48,920
and use the most often. And then my second would be something like Endless or another

537
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:54,280
OS that's that's really kind of curated like this. So I think it's it's another one like

538
00:50:54,280 --> 00:50:56,960
along with cubes, we should really give it a go.

539
00:50:56,960 --> 00:51:03,760
You know, I remember, I'm remembering now when I was looking up brunch guests, that

540
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:07,400
they now I don't want to get this too wrong, but I'm just gonna throw it out there. Maybe

541
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:13,400
we could someone can have a look. I remember that there was a project that was focused

542
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:22,360
on sharing coding experiences with kids, sometimes even toddlers. And it was connected to Endless.

543
00:51:22,360 --> 00:51:25,860
Sure. Yeah, there's a bunch of tools that ships with like that. Yeah, I would imagine

544
00:51:25,860 --> 00:51:29,240
there's a nice partnership there. And it makes a lot of sense because like one of the first

545
00:51:29,240 --> 00:51:33,120
images they have on their website is a bunch of kids looking at a laptop. So that sort

546
00:51:33,120 --> 00:51:38,760
of makes sense to me. Look at their download images here. Desktop computer, virtual machine,

547
00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:48,760
Raspberry Pi, Pinebook Pro. That's what I mean. It seems like they're really tied into

548
00:51:48,760 --> 00:51:52,320
what's going on. There's a Pinebook Pro behind you. We could put it on. Oh, hello. We should

549
00:51:52,320 --> 00:51:58,200
try it. We should try it on the Pinebook Pro. All right. You know, it needs a good job.

550
00:51:58,200 --> 00:52:03,040
Pinebook Pro is almost in that sweet spot for me, but not quite, you know. Any other

551
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:08,320
thoughts on Endless from anybody in the virtual lugs before we go? Virtual lugs? The thing

552
00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:14,000
that might not make it great for children is that computing is really social for them.

553
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:17,760
That's true. I mean, you could put it on the Internet, right? You could get it. You're

554
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:23,840
thinking like applications or games? Applications and games. Like I moved in with my significant

555
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:27,120
other who has two kids. I'm like, oh, I'll switch the kids to Linux. And then I realized

556
00:52:27,120 --> 00:52:31,000
all they do is play games that run terribly on Linux.

557
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:38,880
Yeah, yeah, yeah. And of course, like Microsoft's a big part of that. I mean, like Bedrock is

558
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:45,840
so you can you there. There was a way to get it running on Linux, but the maintainer of

559
00:52:45,840 --> 00:52:53,280
the Flatpak for Bedrock Edition just bailed, just noped out. So that's gone now. They pulled

560
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:54,600
it from Flat Hub. What is it?

561
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:57,560
Well, I'm just browsing their website here while you're talking and I found some cool

562
00:52:57,560 --> 00:52:58,560
stuff.

563
00:52:58,560 --> 00:52:59,560
What is it?

564
00:52:59,560 --> 00:53:00,560
You closed the website.

565
00:53:00,560 --> 00:53:01,560
Oh, I did. I was going to move on.

566
00:53:01,560 --> 00:53:07,280
They also have this experiment that is exactly what I was talking about called the Hack Computer.

567
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:13,880
And it's both building the hardware and the software. So they have it sounds like what

568
00:53:13,880 --> 00:53:18,600
they call an endless key. Hack is included within the new endless key USB project. Offline

569
00:53:18,600 --> 00:53:23,040
kids can plug in the key and they're ready to play hack. So hack, I think, is like a

570
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:27,080
gamified version of learning.

571
00:53:27,080 --> 00:53:28,080
Is this what you're talking about?

572
00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:30,360
I think it might be.

573
00:53:30,360 --> 00:53:34,960
So hack is included in the endless key product. The complete hack experience now comes on

574
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:41,440
the new endless key USB. So offline kids can plug in and they're ready to play hack.

575
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:44,200
There's hack-computer or try-hack-computer.

576
00:53:44,200 --> 00:53:53,440
That's where I'm at is I'm right now at hack-computer.com. What is hack?

577
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:55,680
Go to try.hack-computer.com.

578
00:53:55,680 --> 00:53:58,520
Try, okay, what now?

579
00:53:58,520 --> 00:54:05,000
Try dot and then just the URL you're at.

580
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:11,880
Try dot. So instead of www, try.hack-computer what? Then what?

581
00:54:11,880 --> 00:54:12,880
Then just nothing.

582
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:20,520
Oh, okay. Of course. And survey says load. Oh, there it goes. What are these, NFTs?

583
00:54:20,520 --> 00:54:21,520
How did you know?

584
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:22,520
What am I looking at?

585
00:54:22,520 --> 00:54:26,320
I don't know. It says like pick a dimension to explore. And so just, I don't know, look

586
00:54:26,320 --> 00:54:30,880
like you got processing, sidetrack, web tech, engineering, endless OS, terminal T.

587
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:38,240
I'm going to pick endless OS. Who we got there? Who is that? Who's coming in right now?

588
00:54:38,240 --> 00:54:39,240
Is that Nancy?

589
00:54:39,240 --> 00:54:43,520
It might have been hack-computer. This is too much, man. I'm already bored.

590
00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:48,720
All right. Well, it's not targeted at you clearly. Oh, I see.

591
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:53,280
Hack laptop. The laptop that allows kids ages 10 plus to learn to code by hacking their

592
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:57,960
own device. A high-performance award-winning laptop. The hack utilizes a 14-inch ASUS

593
00:54:57,960 --> 00:55:03,560
E4060MA laptop to deliver the world's only completely hackable computer. Note that this

594
00:55:03,560 --> 00:55:05,800
computer must be purchased through the hack to access the hack experience.

595
00:55:05,800 --> 00:55:11,080
Okay. This is more disappointing than I thought. It's just a bunch of links to a bunch of projects.

596
00:55:11,080 --> 00:55:12,080
They make it look good though, right?

597
00:55:12,080 --> 00:55:15,160
Well, they had me. They definitely had me.

598
00:55:15,160 --> 00:55:20,460
I mean, they got a good look going. I think they're worth taking more seriously or spending

599
00:55:20,460 --> 00:55:21,460
more time with.

600
00:55:21,460 --> 00:55:22,460
Yeah, I agree.

601
00:55:22,460 --> 00:55:25,440
I just haven't got a good strong sense of the audience's interest, but maybe they'll

602
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:26,780
let us know.

603
00:55:26,780 --> 00:55:30,400
Any other EndlessOS thoughts before we spin the wheel?

604
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:37,440
Well, the EndlessKey, that is just a USB drive that you can plug in any computer.

605
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:38,440
That's what it looked like.

606
00:55:38,440 --> 00:55:39,440
Yeah.

607
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:40,440
Yeah.

608
00:55:40,440 --> 00:55:41,440
Yeah.

609
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:42,440
Yeah.

610
00:55:42,440 --> 00:55:43,440
And play hack.

611
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:44,440
All right. Okay.

612
00:55:44,440 --> 00:55:45,440
EndlessOS.org slash key.

613
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:52,280
I mean, it's a 128 gig USB drive and there's something there.

614
00:55:52,280 --> 00:55:53,920
Hey, maybe it's high quality and it's branded.

615
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:55,960
It says high quality in the description. How'd you know?

616
00:55:55,960 --> 00:56:03,880
Hell, I had a sense, man. I had a sense. All right. Just a few more topics on the Wheel

617
00:56:03,880 --> 00:56:06,480
of Topics today and then our stream is going to be over.

618
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:08,740
So what are the options before you turn it?

619
00:56:08,740 --> 00:56:10,240
Brent's Docker Jellyfin Beginnings.

620
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:11,240
Oh, here we go.

621
00:56:11,240 --> 00:56:15,200
Cloud Virtual Desktops and why Linux will win it all in 20 years.

622
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:16,200
You ready?

623
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:21,200
This is going to be fun.

624
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:22,200
Spinning.

625
00:56:22,200 --> 00:56:27,480
I wanted to save that one, but we'll just do it now because there's just no avoiding

626
00:56:27,480 --> 00:56:35,080
it. There's no avoiding it. Why Linux will win it all. This just proves you can't control

627
00:56:35,080 --> 00:56:36,080
the wheel.

628
00:56:36,080 --> 00:56:37,080
I think the wheel is rigged.

629
00:56:37,080 --> 00:56:42,680
You can't control the wheel. All right. So why Linux will win it all in 20 years. What

630
00:56:42,680 --> 00:56:46,880
do you think? What is it about Linux that means it's going to make it so it'll win it

631
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:48,440
all in 20 years? What is it?

632
00:56:48,440 --> 00:56:54,440
OK, well, I see it is also still remote change. It will always exist.

633
00:56:54,440 --> 00:56:58,440
Is that right? There's no commercial interest. It's going to be like, well, we didn't make

634
00:56:58,440 --> 00:57:01,840
enough in the Linux division this year. That's never going to happen.

635
00:57:01,840 --> 00:57:04,880
So when all the economies crash, it'll still be around. That's what you're saying.

636
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:10,520
I've always felt like over time, companies will focus on something else. Their attention

637
00:57:10,520 --> 00:57:16,320
will be diverted and like things like Windows and Mac OS will be around for a while, but

638
00:57:16,320 --> 00:57:20,240
not forever. They'll be these companies will eventually do something else like Nintendo

639
00:57:20,240 --> 00:57:25,240
used to be a trading card company 100 years ago. Right. And Linux will be here when those

640
00:57:25,240 --> 00:57:29,660
companies decide they're leaving the market and it'll just be better than ever. Whenever

641
00:57:29,660 --> 00:57:36,200
that happens, I think it's sort of like how in the very early days, in the late 70s, in

642
00:57:36,200 --> 00:57:43,640
the early 80s, they already had TCP IP figured out. It was already known, but you still had

643
00:57:43,640 --> 00:57:51,720
IPX. You had net buoy. You had Apple talk. You had all these other standards and protocols

644
00:57:51,720 --> 00:57:58,000
that came out that were not TCP IP. They were corporate owned and they survived for a while.

645
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:03,080
Like there were a mini IPX networks and a lot of Apple talk networks and some net buoy

646
00:58:03,080 --> 00:58:09,960
networks unfortunately. And the reality is TCP IP ate it all. Eventually those vendors

647
00:58:09,960 --> 00:58:14,720
had other strategies. They wanted to participate in the Internet. Their corporate strategies

648
00:58:14,720 --> 00:58:19,280
changed and all of a sudden they needed networking protocols that could route that could go out

649
00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:24,080
to the public Internet. And so they transitioned from having their interest in these proprietary

650
00:58:24,080 --> 00:58:32,640
protocols to using the open standard that is TCP IP. And I think that same kind of just

651
00:58:32,640 --> 00:58:39,360
it just makes business sense kind of thinking will eventually cause Linux to consume everything.

652
00:58:39,360 --> 00:58:45,200
It is the Borg. Resistance is futile. You can you can delay it, but it will come for

653
00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:51,200
you. I love that. That's my thoughts. It feels like we're on a trajectory and you can kind

654
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:59,500
of see it trending quite heavily in some areas. So I'm curious if you're going to predict

655
00:58:59,500 --> 00:59:02,400
what's going to happen in the next 20 years, you kind of got to look at what's happened

656
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:08,360
in the last 20 years. Sure. So I know on the server side of things, it's gone fairly well,

657
00:59:08,360 --> 00:59:13,440
but like 20 years in the desktop space, a heck of a lot has changed. Yeah, I mean, I

658
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:19,920
think it's sort of as markets change, Linux gets used in a spot where it wasn't used previously.

659
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:28,060
So if you look at the world before Android, it was all kinds of different OS's and real

660
00:59:28,060 --> 00:59:32,440
time OS's and attempts at that. And there was all kinds of different solutions for that.

661
00:59:32,440 --> 00:59:36,820
Some made by the chip makers themselves, some that were made by community, some that were

662
00:59:36,820 --> 00:59:41,920
made by that hardware manufacturer and just use specifically on their own devices. And

663
00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:47,680
then there's the post Android world and Tivo world where you just start with your device

664
00:59:47,680 --> 00:59:51,960
using Linux. That's the base operating system, because when you use Linux, the kernel, you're

665
00:59:51,960 --> 00:59:55,680
also going to get networking, you're going to get device driver support, you're going

666
00:59:55,680 --> 01:00:01,880
to get hardware platform support, SOC support, you're going to get all these all these things

667
01:00:01,880 --> 01:00:05,600
now that it takes to run a tech stack that you would have to implement yourself, that

668
01:00:05,600 --> 01:00:11,040
it just becomes a literal impossibility. So you just use Linux now and you build on top

669
01:00:11,040 --> 01:00:18,480
of that. And that's sort of that wasn't true 11 years ago. And now it's a universal truth.

670
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:22,800
And I think that is what will happen in other markets and other areas just as that same

671
01:00:22,800 --> 01:00:27,960
exact thing is what happened on the server. You know, when I started in the industry,

672
01:00:27,960 --> 01:00:34,040
Linux was looked at as a risk. It was considered an IP risk. The people that built Linux were

673
01:00:34,040 --> 01:00:37,520
freeloaders, hippies that likely weren't going to stick around with anything. These distros

674
01:00:37,520 --> 01:00:42,480
were fly by nights that could disappear on you at any moment. You would be silly to deploy

675
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:49,240
anything but something like Windows or Solaris. And and it was considered an amateur thing

676
01:00:49,240 --> 01:00:52,960
that you would never use on a server. Now it's the de facto server operating system

677
01:00:52,960 --> 01:01:00,600
around the world, so much so that even companies like Microsoft and Apple deploy it themselves

678
01:01:00,600 --> 01:01:05,400
in their own servers. So it just shows you how things can change over time. And I imagine

679
01:01:05,400 --> 01:01:11,380
the desktop, the reason why it hasn't, the reason why it hasn't conquered the desktop

680
01:01:11,380 --> 01:01:14,940
is because the market doesn't need it to right now. The business interests don't need it

681
01:01:14,940 --> 01:01:20,880
to. Like it's not until businesses acting in their own self-interest align with using

682
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:23,940
Linux. Like look what happened with Microsoft and their adoption of open source. It was

683
01:01:23,940 --> 01:01:29,480
Linux is a cancer until all of a sudden they realized, well hold on, we want to be big

684
01:01:29,480 --> 01:01:33,080
in the cloud and we want to be big with developers. Now we love Linux. Now look at all this stuff

685
01:01:33,080 --> 01:01:37,200
we're open sourcing. Now our terminal is open source. Now we're doing this in open source.

686
01:01:37,200 --> 01:01:43,120
Look at our subsystem, right? It's like it's not, it's not, it wasn't an ideological shift.

687
01:01:43,120 --> 01:01:46,000
It was a business shift that caused the adoption.

688
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:52,320
Yeah, we've talked some in the past and even I think in predictions a few years ago about

689
01:01:52,320 --> 01:01:58,460
Windows running Linux under the hood. And that feels to me like it is a real possibility

690
01:01:58,460 --> 01:02:02,360
and could make business sense for them in some ways.

691
01:02:02,360 --> 01:02:08,720
Especially if it was basically a thin client platform that connected you to a cloud desktop

692
01:02:08,720 --> 01:02:14,640
that they run on Azure. And they charge your business $5 a month for you to get access

693
01:02:14,640 --> 01:02:16,080
to it or $10 a month.

694
01:02:16,080 --> 01:02:19,720
That'd be an interesting place for them to actually test that without needing to drop

695
01:02:19,720 --> 01:02:21,280
Windows right away actually.

696
01:02:21,280 --> 01:02:26,200
All right. Does anybody else have a reason why Linux will win it all in 20 years?

697
01:02:26,200 --> 01:02:32,140
The switch to services revenue. So you can't make money selling an operating system anymore.

698
01:02:32,140 --> 01:02:37,600
So why would you spend all the man hours to maintain it? So if Windows could make that

699
01:02:37,600 --> 01:02:42,560
compatibility layer, why wouldn't they just maintain or help maintain Linux rather than

700
01:02:42,560 --> 01:02:48,100
have to maintain the 30 years of technical debt that is Microsoft Windows?

701
01:02:48,100 --> 01:02:55,360
Flip that around for a moment. Imagine that Apple or Microsoft hasn't invested 35 years

702
01:02:55,360 --> 01:02:59,440
in a desktop platform and they were launching as a business today and they wanted to get

703
01:02:59,440 --> 01:03:05,120
into Azure or iCloud or services, Apple wanted to be a TV company and a phone company. Would

704
01:03:05,120 --> 01:03:06,600
they even fucking bother?

705
01:03:06,600 --> 01:03:09,200
No, that would be crazy, right?

706
01:03:09,200 --> 01:03:14,980
Yeah. The only reason you would actually, you might roll your own kind of distro because

707
01:03:14,980 --> 01:03:18,120
you need some things that it doesn't provide.

708
01:03:18,120 --> 01:03:23,720
But you would end up with a lot more things like Amazon Linux.

709
01:03:23,720 --> 01:03:25,520
Yeah, for sure, for sure.

710
01:03:25,520 --> 01:03:29,280
Minimac, you think maybe it won't actually make it to the 20 year milestone it sounds

711
01:03:29,280 --> 01:03:30,280
like?

712
01:03:30,280 --> 01:03:37,080
Well, the question is, will there be Linux in 20 years? Will there be a successor like

713
01:03:37,080 --> 01:03:45,800
a running hood kernel? So I think Linux already won in regard that the new system and open

714
01:03:45,800 --> 01:03:54,240
source and projects around that have Linux opened the way to these and these will survive.

715
01:03:54,240 --> 01:04:00,760
But maybe we will have another kernel, a different kernel, just a different base and we will,

716
01:04:00,760 --> 01:04:09,000
I mean open source and Linux using open source has changed the world. Now, I can live with

717
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:15,960
another kernel base, but the open source environment, the new system, everything like that, that's

718
01:04:15,960 --> 01:04:22,160
the most important thing. And that's what I depend on and that will survive, I think.

719
01:04:22,160 --> 01:04:25,280
And so I say Linux has already won in some regard.

720
01:04:25,280 --> 01:04:26,280
Nice.

721
01:04:26,280 --> 01:04:31,800
It's true. It's now we just got to sit back and watch it all happen. All right. Two more

722
01:04:31,800 --> 01:04:35,600
topics on the wheel. You ready, Brent? Should we spin it?

723
01:04:35,600 --> 01:04:43,760
I think I'm ready. Go for it. That sounds different. Okay, you touched on this just

724
01:04:43,760 --> 01:04:44,920
briefly here with Microsoft.

725
01:04:44,920 --> 01:04:51,280
I did. This is kind of perfect, isn't it? So cloud virtual desktops. Are they actually

726
01:04:51,280 --> 01:04:52,280
useful?

727
01:04:52,280 --> 01:04:56,880
That's the real question. So I got kind of curious about this maybe a month ago. If you

728
01:04:56,880 --> 01:05:01,560
remember, there was a slight period of time there where my internet was just total crap.

729
01:05:01,560 --> 01:05:05,560
It's gotten slightly better and I don't know why. And I'm fine with that.

730
01:05:05,560 --> 01:05:06,560
The moon.

731
01:05:06,560 --> 01:05:07,560
Right.

732
01:05:07,560 --> 01:05:08,800
That's what I blame it on.

733
01:05:08,800 --> 01:05:09,800
It's tides or something.

734
01:05:09,800 --> 01:05:13,400
Yeah. How did that work? How do they work?

735
01:05:13,400 --> 01:05:18,760
And so I know this on the surface may sound like a non solution for me because like if

736
01:05:18,760 --> 01:05:25,840
you have bad internet, a cloud hosted desktop doesn't make any sense. But I have some competing

737
01:05:25,840 --> 01:05:31,360
priorities here because for me, I don't really have any super performant computers that I'm

738
01:05:31,360 --> 01:05:36,720
willing to use on a daily basis. I have a few laptops that I've bought and probably

739
01:05:36,720 --> 01:05:42,680
the newest one is an x250. But it's kind of loud. I don't like that. And so

740
01:05:42,680 --> 01:05:46,560
That's not necessarily the best time to pick up new hardware either.

741
01:05:46,560 --> 01:05:54,040
No, definitely. And so there's I got really curious about offloading hardware expenses

742
01:05:54,040 --> 01:05:59,720
on to this is basically a subscription hardware service really if you look at it that way.

743
01:05:59,720 --> 01:06:06,840
But I wondered I saw a few other resources talking about oh yeah, this is great. Like

744
01:06:06,840 --> 01:06:10,240
you can totally do this. It's good for people who don't have that much money to put on hardware

745
01:06:10,240 --> 01:06:16,600
etc etc. But I just wondered is this more of a toy and not something people can actually

746
01:06:16,600 --> 01:06:23,040
use someone like me like maybe corporate stuff. It makes a lot of sense because they can orchestrate

747
01:06:23,040 --> 01:06:28,240
this in a really seamless way. But for someone like me who just sort of wants to get some

748
01:06:28,240 --> 01:06:36,760
things done. Does it make any sense? Right. Yeah. And because there are some clear advantages.

749
01:06:36,760 --> 01:06:40,640
One of them is price I think. Well and the other thing that's always lovely about them

750
01:06:40,640 --> 01:06:44,800
is they're generally in a data center. So they have just like a screaming internet connection.

751
01:06:44,800 --> 01:06:47,900
Well OK fair enough. That's that's why it got interesting to me in the first place was

752
01:06:47,900 --> 01:06:54,200
like maybe I could just download or upload you know my flax from there and just have

753
01:06:54,200 --> 01:06:57,880
them. Yeah. Then you would never complain to me about my drop connections and such.

754
01:06:57,880 --> 01:07:04,160
But see that's where they're also very weak is I think the number one issue is latency

755
01:07:04,160 --> 01:07:09,460
in the remote screen updates. They've they've gotten it really good but you know it's still

756
01:07:09,460 --> 01:07:13,400
not the same. And then and especially when you're looking like a waveform that's scrolling

757
01:07:13,400 --> 01:07:17,200
across the screen that's an area where it's going to be particularly bad. Or your mouse.

758
01:07:17,200 --> 01:07:22,480
I know you're sensitive with your mouse. Sure. But the other thing is is like very few of

759
01:07:22,480 --> 01:07:26,480
them are going to come back and like take a local USB device and bring it forward to

760
01:07:26,480 --> 01:07:30,040
a cloud connection. Some of them will but those are the nicer more expensive ones. Generally

761
01:07:30,040 --> 01:07:35,320
they're using Windows. But that seems essential to me. Like if you couldn't plug in a keyboard

762
01:07:35,320 --> 01:07:41,680
or like OK maybe keyboards bad example but something like an audio device like. Yeah.

763
01:07:41,680 --> 01:07:45,120
Maybe it's just our audience. I think we plug in. We try a lot of things that most users

764
01:07:45,120 --> 01:07:49,680
don't. But well that's also the only demographic I could see who's been willing to try this.

765
01:07:49,680 --> 01:07:56,080
I feel like it's getting worked out now. I think in a way like these cloud gaming services

766
01:07:56,080 --> 01:08:01,840
are doing us a solid in that they're sorting out how do I bring a USB input device forward

767
01:08:01,840 --> 01:08:08,400
in a low latency way and how do I get this really high performance application down to

768
01:08:08,400 --> 01:08:16,040
them as fast as possible with the lowest latency. And if I could use the NVIDIA GeForce streaming

769
01:08:16,040 --> 01:08:21,880
service just to get a desktop I probably would. So you know they're legitimately on the GeForce

770
01:08:21,880 --> 01:08:26,120
now streaming service. They're spinning up Windows VMs loading steam or they have like

771
01:08:26,120 --> 01:08:30,000
a Windows VM image with steam pre-installed. But sometimes there's updates that need to

772
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:35,440
be applied. Then you log into your steam account like it brings you in you log into steam and

773
01:08:35,440 --> 01:08:39,760
then it downloads the frickin game in their data center nice installs it on that VM they've

774
01:08:39,760 --> 01:08:45,200
just created and then launches the game. So you can see how there are clearly some advantages

775
01:08:45,200 --> 01:08:49,080
and it's very tempting. But then there are these subtle roadblocks that I think we need

776
01:08:49,080 --> 01:08:53,200
to get over before that's even useful. I wish they would just I wish they would sell you

777
01:08:53,200 --> 01:08:59,280
a desktop service. They've built it for gaming but they clearly could deliver a desktop experience

778
01:08:59,280 --> 01:09:04,080
because you're often in a desktop experience until the game launches. And I'd love like

779
01:09:04,080 --> 01:09:07,880
we wanted to figure out a way to run OBS in the cloud. Yeah right. So we all just connect

780
01:09:07,880 --> 01:09:12,320
into that. I thought that'd be really great. All right I see we have a few takes in there

781
01:09:12,320 --> 01:09:16,160
Mini Mac I wanted to let you jump in first and then we'll get to Rob and then Gerald

782
01:09:16,160 --> 01:09:22,040
so go ahead Mini Mac. Yeah I think I don't have anything to add you just nailed it. I

783
01:09:22,040 --> 01:09:26,520
mean I mentioned cloud gaming I mentioned cloud gaming I think this is to stop if you

784
01:09:26,520 --> 01:09:33,040
have cloud gaming you can have a virtual desktop and everything just have a an application

785
01:09:33,040 --> 01:09:40,640
on your system that loads in that cloud instance and then you can use your computer in a cloud.

786
01:09:40,640 --> 01:09:48,400
Yeah that would be great. Gerald did you want to jump in on oh development in the cloud.

787
01:09:48,400 --> 01:09:55,640
That's a good idea. Yeah thanks. So I lead a software development team at the company

788
01:09:55,640 --> 01:10:05,040
and we so so for onboarding new developers it always takes like ages to till they have

789
01:10:05,040 --> 01:10:11,320
their IDE stuff set up and so on. Sure. So I was I was really like thinking like if we

790
01:10:11,320 --> 01:10:18,800
could have we could just say okay we do our business in in our own cloud right. So here's

791
01:10:18,800 --> 01:10:27,640
our standardized desktop. Here's you work on a thin client thing and what and your IDE

792
01:10:27,640 --> 01:10:34,920
is in the desktop and it's already auto configured anything the build system is auto configured

793
01:10:34,920 --> 01:10:42,520
right. That would be like great. Like I looked into something like I don't know you mentioned

794
01:10:42,520 --> 01:10:51,800
it once on last guacamole. Oh yeah sure. Yeah that's all. That's exactly pretty much all

795
01:10:51,800 --> 01:10:59,720
I we where I work that was possibly sort of like DevOps team to build it. We have because

796
01:10:59,720 --> 01:11:06,160
of a bunch of requirements and networking issues that we can't install stuff on our

797
01:11:06,160 --> 01:11:14,520
own laptops. We have base images in AWS that basically spin up a full death and violence

798
01:11:14,520 --> 01:11:20,480
bit of guacamole magic. So you think client in and we can get a developer from running

799
01:11:20,480 --> 01:11:28,000
within an hour generally. And yeah everything's set up for them. The yes code of all the plugins

800
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:35,080
that we require. Browsers with all the accessibility plugins that we need to do accessibility testing.

801
01:11:35,080 --> 01:11:41,640
There's quite a lot otherwise it would have taken day by each developer days to set up

802
01:11:41,640 --> 01:11:46,040
the various Docker configuration stuff that's needed. Sure because it's all right with services

803
01:11:46,040 --> 01:11:51,600
in fact we can just do it in base images use guacamole as a thin client. It has its issues

804
01:11:51,600 --> 01:11:58,520
it's not the most performance I would love to get more forms but it's better than nothing

805
01:11:58,520 --> 01:12:05,920
or some crazy three hot process of RDP connections which is just insane when it sounds like this

806
01:12:05,920 --> 01:12:09,440
is solving an actual problem. I was just trying to dream up problems that this could solve

807
01:12:09,440 --> 01:12:17,280
but this is one problem. Thanks for your input. All right we've got one left on the wheel

808
01:12:17,280 --> 01:12:21,080
should we do it. I mean we you got to spin it though. Right. Yeah I'll spend. I mean

809
01:12:21,080 --> 01:12:23,600
it's only one topic so we know where it's going to land. It's not going to make any

810
01:12:23,600 --> 01:12:30,280
sound I don't think because there's no divider. Let's find out. Oh it doesn't. You're right.

811
01:12:30,280 --> 01:12:36,480
It's they actually they actually wrote that in. Beep. Beep. Nicely done. All right. Our

812
01:12:36,480 --> 01:12:46,440
last topic on the wheel is Brent's Docker jellyfin beginnings. Jellyfin beginnings huh

813
01:12:46,440 --> 01:12:49,840
Brent. Well here we go. And now the wheel is empty so this is our last topic. So you're

814
01:12:49,840 --> 01:12:57,200
jumping into jellyfin. Well I would more say I've jumped. Oh. And so a few weeks ago if

815
01:12:57,200 --> 01:13:05,680
you all remember we did a jellyfin kind of dive. We all walked away fairly impressed.

816
01:13:05,680 --> 01:13:14,580
I know even Alex was like oh he tried to convince Kat to. It didn't go so well. And so I got

817
01:13:14,580 --> 01:13:19,520
inspired by that you you let me kind of tap into the jellyfin server you had here in the

818
01:13:19,520 --> 01:13:25,600
studio which was fun. But then I thought hmm. So I've never set up Plex. I've played with

819
01:13:25,600 --> 01:13:30,520
Cody a little bit over the years but I've never been organized enough to bring all my

820
01:13:30,520 --> 01:13:36,520
media into one place and to have it hosted even locally in that way. But I thought. What

821
01:13:36,520 --> 01:13:40,620
are you running it on? Yeah. That's where it gets interesting. I thought you'd like

822
01:13:40,620 --> 01:13:47,200
this adventure. All right. So what has also happened was that over the last few years

823
01:13:47,200 --> 01:13:53,040
I've been lucky enough to find a great many ThinkPads at the local landfill. Sure. Where

824
01:13:53,040 --> 01:13:57,440
I was living. So you've adopted some ThinkPads. You have a few stray ThinkPads. I want to

825
01:13:57,440 --> 01:14:02,280
have some that I've used for years that I are really beloved to me and that I just have

826
01:14:02,280 --> 01:14:09,040
upgraded and now I'm like what the heck do I do with this thing. So what I have my trajectory

827
01:14:09,040 --> 01:14:14,880
is so I've got my parents who live in a different city. I've got my brother who lives on the

828
01:14:14,880 --> 01:14:21,120
same property as me but in a different building. Right. And I've got my place which has pretty

829
01:14:21,120 --> 01:14:31,520
bad Internet. So what I'm doing is I'm building three systems that are pretty similar. OK.

830
01:14:31,520 --> 01:14:39,440
Building three systems using old laptops. So one of them is a T61 which is very ancient.

831
01:14:39,440 --> 01:14:46,160
The other one is an X440 where the screen is broken. And the one I'm using is an X220

832
01:14:46,160 --> 01:14:53,520
with a dock. So lots of USB inputs. And do they all need storage? Do they all have the

833
01:14:53,520 --> 01:15:00,640
same storage? The idea is that for instance. Airplanes. I know. That's a loud one. Yeah.

834
01:15:00,640 --> 01:15:04,800
Don't they know what we're doing. Come on. Gosh. We're down here podcasting. We didn't

835
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:12,000
tell them the schedule changed and they're just. So the idea is most of these people

836
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:16,880
have USB drives you know that they've collected over the years. A whole bunch of different

837
01:15:16,880 --> 01:15:22,480
sizes different ones and most of them are USB compatible. Hardly any internal drives.

838
01:15:22,480 --> 01:15:27,520
I've got probably the most out of all these people. And but I wanted to implement a solution

839
01:15:27,520 --> 01:15:34,240
that I could test on my own and distribute to my parents and my brother for instance

840
01:15:34,240 --> 01:15:40,840
or anybody else who wants to in a fairly straightforward way that you know whatever is running at my

841
01:15:40,840 --> 01:15:45,840
place is so similar over there that I don't need to relearn like the topography and all

842
01:15:45,840 --> 01:15:53,740
of that topology. So the question is is this crazy to plug in a whole bunch of USB drives

843
01:15:53,740 --> 01:15:59,880
into like a quasi laptop franken server and to have it do some cool things. I guess it

844
01:15:59,880 --> 01:16:09,640
depends on your tolerance for outages. I think it's high. OK. Because. Well no I say it's

845
01:16:09,640 --> 01:16:20,080
not crazy. If I could if I could wave a magic wand and do it one way only it would be to

846
01:16:20,080 --> 01:16:23,480
probably like lay down ethernet or something between you and your brother's place and then

847
01:16:23,480 --> 01:16:28,460
have all of it and at least in the case of those two have all of it pooled in one spot

848
01:16:28,460 --> 01:16:33,160
so you have one large set of this and only one system to manage instead of two. Yeah

849
01:16:33,160 --> 01:16:38,520
I hear you. Currently the connection between us is he's got a just a home router at his

850
01:16:38,520 --> 01:16:45,120
place that controls also the Internet coming in and I think it's a ubiquity like very directional

851
01:16:45,120 --> 01:16:55,160
Wi-Fi that just pointed at my cabin and it's pretty slow and unreliable I'll say. So yeah

852
01:16:55,160 --> 01:16:59,240
ethernet somehow would be nice but that requires a hundred foot ditch. I mean really you both

853
01:16:59,240 --> 01:17:03,800
are gonna want. Yeah I mean if it's that kind of connection you're probably gonna want them

854
01:17:03,800 --> 01:17:09,160
on your ends so that way you don't have buffering and stuff like that. Yeah I mean now that

855
01:17:09,160 --> 01:17:13,240
it's not crazy it would be nice to have a way to manage all of it centrally that's where

856
01:17:13,240 --> 01:17:18,920
things like. It would be nice to have it have a good skill set in Ansible but it's which

857
01:17:18,920 --> 01:17:25,360
I'm willing to learn so this is also. It's a lot that's like that's like saying that's

858
01:17:25,360 --> 01:17:29,060
like saying you got to learn like a whole other category before you can start even doing

859
01:17:29,060 --> 01:17:35,400
something in another category you know it's a big dependency not necessarily a bad one

860
01:17:35,400 --> 01:17:41,240
but. So that's the background that's the hardware. Okay. And so the idea over Christmas I thought

861
01:17:41,240 --> 01:17:47,880
was well I'm just gonna jump in a jellyfish and I know my brother and his wife they watch

862
01:17:47,880 --> 01:17:52,920
a ton of TV they got a like a giant pile of DVDs that they love and never watch right

863
01:17:52,920 --> 01:17:58,040
you know how that is and because of the bad internet to that place sometimes streaming

864
01:17:58,040 --> 01:18:02,840
services just. Are not really great. No that's it you know like 80% of the time it's fine.

865
01:18:02,840 --> 01:18:09,200
Yeah. But there's sometimes it's not. So I also took it as an opportunity to jump into

866
01:18:09,200 --> 01:18:14,600
Docker which I had never done and I heard you know a few people in our chat room over

867
01:18:14,600 --> 01:18:19,320
the last several episodes have said that they haven't dove in either. And so I thought well

868
01:18:19,320 --> 01:18:26,000
jellyfins actually a nice low stakes way to try stuff right. That's a good way to start.

869
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:30,440
And I didn't quite figure out Docker compose yet so maybe you'll have to give me a once

870
01:18:30,440 --> 01:18:37,920
over. Sure. But it was fun. I had so much fun and I have to say it worked really well

871
01:18:37,920 --> 01:18:43,280
and so now jellyfins up and running. Nice. Which is very cool. Oh good. Mostly at my

872
01:18:43,280 --> 01:18:51,280
brother's place because I don't know we watch most of the content over there. I say you

873
01:18:51,280 --> 01:18:59,560
know the nice thing about doing it in Docker compose is that when you revisit it in three

874
01:18:59,560 --> 01:19:05,440
to three months to a year you have this readable file that tells you oh this is where I store

875
01:19:05,440 --> 01:19:09,720
the config at this is where the application data is at and these are the networking ports

876
01:19:09,720 --> 01:19:16,400
it use. It's just it's a really readable yaml. It's really a readable format. It's just also

877
01:19:16,400 --> 01:19:22,160
very anal about how you format it. Yeah. Well I'm using I guess it's called the Docker command

878
01:19:22,160 --> 01:19:26,640
line and so you're just running a script and it looks almost as readable to me as all the

879
01:19:26,640 --> 01:19:29,600
same options just slightly different formatting from what I can tell. I mean it's a simple

880
01:19:29,600 --> 01:19:34,960
application and I'm not doing anything fancy with it. Yeah sure. Yeah. Yeah that could

881
01:19:34,960 --> 01:19:40,480
be really nice too. So I think we're when you're talking just one application I don't

882
01:19:40,480 --> 01:19:45,000
think it really matters. Okay. You know like if you have a like a stack of applications

883
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:55,400
like maybe jellyfin and a Usenet or torrent downloader or a audiobook manager or something

884
01:19:55,400 --> 01:20:02,280
like something I like a lot is I haven't used it. What is it called? I haven't used the

885
01:20:02,280 --> 01:20:07,080
fork of it but the project was called subsonic but there's several forks of it now and it's

886
01:20:07,080 --> 01:20:13,000
essentially like a self-hosted music library media library where you can have your music

887
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:17,320
and your playlists and podcasts and internet radio streams and stuff like that and everybody

888
01:20:17,320 --> 01:20:21,280
can have their own on there and so it's kind of nice when you've got you know just a small

889
01:20:21,280 --> 01:20:26,020
land and people want to have centralized jukebox stuff like that. When you start having multiple

890
01:20:26,020 --> 01:20:32,560
applications it's nice to it's nice to manage all that in a compose file because it acts

891
01:20:32,560 --> 01:20:37,960
as both documentation but also it's a method to update them and stop them and start doing

892
01:20:37,960 --> 01:20:42,720
it got it all that kind of stuff. So it's nice in that way. So like for in my case all

893
01:20:42,720 --> 01:20:48,480
of my all of my server-side applications that are related to multimedia in some way are

894
01:20:48,480 --> 01:20:52,740
all in their own Docker compose file and so I go into that directory and if I do a Docker

895
01:20:52,740 --> 01:20:57,700
compose pull it actually ends up date updating like eight applications for me nice with one

896
01:20:57,700 --> 01:21:02,040
command nice and they all yeah they all stay up to date and that way it's and I can separate

897
01:21:02,040 --> 01:21:06,080
it out like that so I think it's handy in that regard. It's also a really nice way to

898
01:21:06,080 --> 01:21:11,480
share your setup with people or communicate to someone else what your setup is so you

899
01:21:11,480 --> 01:21:14,640
know if you were to show me your Docker compose file I'd pretty much understand exactly how

900
01:21:14,640 --> 01:21:19,020
you have it set up even if I never saw the command you launch it so that kind of thing.

901
01:21:19,020 --> 01:21:24,040
So one of the questions I have I guess I have two questions. One of them is what should

902
01:21:24,040 --> 01:21:30,680
I run next? And the other question is is Docker the thing to be learning right now or do we

903
01:21:30,680 --> 01:21:35,080
have other technologies that maybe? Yeah I think so. No I think that is probably the

904
01:21:35,080 --> 01:21:39,720
most the most prominent I mean there's Podman but you know you look at like this Bitcoin

905
01:21:39,720 --> 01:21:43,580
node thing I was doing the entire thing is written assuming you're using Docker. That

906
01:21:43,580 --> 01:21:49,560
seems like the case isn't it? Yeah. Minimac has a jellyfin solution. Tell us about it.

907
01:21:49,560 --> 01:21:55,440
Well I'm working with that solution and as some of you know I have a second residence

908
01:21:55,440 --> 01:22:02,720
and I have an Android TV there and I was looking for solutions to have access to all my library

909
01:22:02,720 --> 01:22:08,680
via jellyfin on that Android TV but all of a sudden I thought to myself and maybe I don't

910
01:22:08,680 --> 01:22:14,080
want all the other people visiting that second residence having access to all my library

911
01:22:14,080 --> 01:22:20,820
so my solution would be Chromecast. So having a jellyfin instance on my phone and just Chromecast

912
01:22:20,820 --> 01:22:26,400
my library to the TV so I can take my phone whenever I go. I can go to a friend if he

913
01:22:26,400 --> 01:22:31,680
has an Android capable Chromecast capable device I can just stream my library to their

914
01:22:31,680 --> 01:22:38,260
TV and they're very good so I have everything I want and I can decide if people have access

915
01:22:38,260 --> 01:22:42,640
to the library or not. You know that would be great for hotel rooms. I had to stay in

916
01:22:42,640 --> 01:22:50,960
a hotel room on my way here and I quickly got reminded how awful cable TV is. Oh boy

917
01:22:50,960 --> 01:22:56,920
it's so bad. Yeah that's actually why I own an Amazon Fire Stick because the Amazon Fire

918
01:22:56,920 --> 01:23:03,880
Stick is one of the few portable set top TV boxes that A you can install a Plex or jellyfin

919
01:23:03,880 --> 01:23:10,120
app on and B supports Wi-Fi hotel captures. Very nice. You got to have a device bring

920
01:23:10,120 --> 01:23:15,200
up like an embedded Firefox. Yeah of course. And most of the TV set top box things do not.

921
01:23:15,200 --> 01:23:20,160
Yeah Pi Crash you had a note on Libre Speed that could be a great app for Brent to try

922
01:23:20,160 --> 01:23:27,800
out you're right. Yes so if you got Libre Speed you could actually set okay test your

923
01:23:27,800 --> 01:23:35,320
connection between your house and your brother's house and now you know okay my connection

924
01:23:35,320 --> 01:23:40,400
is failing between myself and my brother's house or the connection is failing with the

925
01:23:40,400 --> 01:23:45,720
internet with fast.com or something like that. Yeah that's a good idea. That does sound like

926
01:23:45,720 --> 01:23:48,960
a great idea. I've always wanted a little bit of a history to see what the bottleneck

927
01:23:48,960 --> 01:23:54,440
is or who I can yell at next. And there is a I believe a Linux server image so it's really

928
01:23:54,440 --> 01:23:59,040
easy to get up and going no flash required just a lightweight speed test in JavaScript.

929
01:23:59,040 --> 01:24:02,480
This is the first time I hear about this. Oh yeah we've mentioned it on self-hosted.

930
01:24:02,480 --> 01:24:06,560
I should pay more attention. It has come up but it's probably just been a quick mention.

931
01:24:06,560 --> 01:24:10,420
It's a simple app I think but I do think that's a great one for you to try. Nice I'm writing

932
01:24:10,420 --> 01:24:14,320
that down. Libre Speed and it's another one of those nice standalone applications you

933
01:24:14,320 --> 01:24:20,280
know that's it's good too. So when you go look at when you go say like a Linux server

934
01:24:20,280 --> 01:24:24,400
IO and you look at their Docker hub pages they'll have the Docker compose file there

935
01:24:24,400 --> 01:24:27,720
that they recommend. If you read through it you'll see like oh I just changed this to

936
01:24:27,720 --> 01:24:32,240
my time zone. I changed this to my paths and then it's just a it's just a matter of you

937
01:24:32,240 --> 01:24:38,120
make a file called docker-compose.yml and it needs to be formatted exactly like they'll

938
01:24:38,120 --> 01:24:43,920
have it on the Linux server page and then you can just do docker compose up and it'll

939
01:24:43,920 --> 01:24:47,720
start up the container for you. Well that's what I so I did explore this and I tried to

940
01:24:47,720 --> 01:24:52,600
get that up and running and making sure everything was cool but I actually had a hard time getting

941
01:24:52,600 --> 01:25:00,640
the docker-compose command to even work. There were some dependencies or something. Yeah

942
01:25:00,640 --> 01:25:04,840
okay so it may not have been installed. Yeah it doesn't install with the standard docker

943
01:25:04,840 --> 01:25:09,040
package. Yeah which I realized. It's just so dumb it will in the future that is a thing

944
01:25:09,040 --> 01:25:12,960
that's changed. How is that not a thing yet? They decided to they hadn't decided to make

945
01:25:12,960 --> 01:25:16,680
it part of the official docker command line tools but they have now. So now it's gonna

946
01:25:16,680 --> 01:25:22,520
be docker-space-compose instead of docker-compose. So you may also be hit by that transition

947
01:25:22,520 --> 01:25:27,320
depending on when it lands in your distro. Perhaps perhaps. I'll look more into it but

948
01:25:27,320 --> 01:25:30,720
I don't know it seems like it should have been a little bit easier considering how useful

949
01:25:30,720 --> 01:25:35,520
it is. I'm so glad you got it going. Well yeah it's a whole adventure. Yeah it is we

950
01:25:35,520 --> 01:25:38,440
can work on it some more while we're here. I'm deploying apps right now on our new server

951
01:25:38,440 --> 01:25:47,560
that's Podman. And how's that going? Slow but good. Slow not great but good. All right

952
01:25:47,560 --> 01:25:53,040
well mumble room it's time for me to go eat. It is that time. Thank you for joining us

953
01:25:53,040 --> 01:25:57,640
though both virtual lugs. Appreciate you guys. Yeah it was cool hearing that conversation

954
01:25:57,640 --> 01:26:02,440
go between both of them. Yeah it was really fun. Thanks for joining us for Linux Sunday

955
01:26:02,440 --> 01:26:10,920
on a Tuesday. We will see you on Sunday and we'll see you again next Tuesday too. How

956
01:26:10,920 --> 01:26:15,840
we do it. Thank you. Come back right here either mumble room or gitsy. We had them both

957
01:26:15,840 --> 01:26:21,120
running today. Worked out pretty good. Yeah great hearing some familiar voices. Yep. Goodbye

958
01:26:21,120 --> 01:26:27,800
everybody enjoy the rest of your day. Thank you. Bye bye Chris. Bye now. Cheerio. Goodbye

959
01:26:27,800 --> 01:26:33,920
goodbye goodbye goodbye. Also thank you for all of you watching live. Those in the chat

960
01:26:33,920 --> 01:26:58,920
room. Have a great rest of your day. See you next Sunday.
