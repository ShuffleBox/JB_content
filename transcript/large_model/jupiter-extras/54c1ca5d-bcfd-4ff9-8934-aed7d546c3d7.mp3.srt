00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,400
Well, hello, everyone. This is Brunch with Brent. I'm joined today by Jim Salter. Jim,

2
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:17,880
thanks for joining me. How are you doing?

3
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:19,560
Doing good, Brent. How about you?

4
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:23,880
I'm doing pretty well. It's such a treat for me to have you on because you and I haven't

5
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:28,280
necessarily had the chance to connect that much, even though we're both doing some pretty

6
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:34,240
cool Jupyter broadcasting content on a regular basis. But I wanted to give some people a

7
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:40,640
little bit of a background on some of what you do. Many will know you as a tech reporter

8
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:47,440
at Ars Technica. Most will know you probably as being co-host of TechSnap with Wes. You've

9
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:50,520
been doing that for a little while now, haven't you?

10
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:55,120
I think we're closing in on a year. I'm not sure. I did several as a guest before they

11
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:57,920
brought me on, so it gets a little hazy.

12
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:02,200
But has that deep kind of thinking always been a part of you, or is it something you've

13
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:04,400
developed out of necessity?

14
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:11,320
I think that's pretty much always been me. I was the kid that before the internet would

15
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:16,600
literally just start reading random things out of Encyclopedia Britannica and going from

16
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:23,760
volume to volume and to see that, to see the other. I want to absorb information, and I

17
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:30,960
want to think about what you can do with it and what it really means and new things you

18
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,080
might be able to do.

19
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:38,640
Understanding a concept deeply allows you to interact with it in a way that allows you

20
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:46,600
to be more creative. I've noticed that certainly, because I tend to be quite slow and deep as

21
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:53,040
well when I commit to learning something. And I've noticed that it allows me to kind

22
00:01:53,040 --> 00:02:00,040
of make all these connections that I wouldn't if I didn't give it that time. Do you find

23
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:06,040
that too? Like connecting a whole bunch of different ideas is what keeps you deep diving?

24
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:11,280
So there's like a really seminal moment in my own personal career progression, right?

25
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:17,520
So I'm about to turn 48 years old, so obviously there was no internet when I was a kid. Some

26
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:23,920
people had computers at home, but that wasn't particularly common either. I was kind of

27
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:27,560
lucky that way, and a lot of people didn't necessarily believe yet that computers were

28
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:31,440
ever really going to matter much to most people, as weird as that might seem now.

29
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,880
It does, yeah.

30
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:39,240
But I had been, I mean my hello world was at like age, I don't know, maybe six on a

31
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:44,200
trash 80. So it didn't take me that long to figure out that I thought computers were

32
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:50,520
seriously cool. And when I discovered that there was a job, a computer programmer, and

33
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:56,040
it paid well, I'm like, well, this is obviously going to be my life. And it didn't necessarily

34
00:02:56,040 --> 00:03:00,280
work out all that cleanly.

35
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,640
Life never does, right?

36
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:09,480
No, it doesn't. But one way or another, I assumed for a good long time that my life

37
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:17,200
is going to be about writing code and programming computers. But I enlisted in the Navy at age

38
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:23,760
17, don't recommend, not a good idea. And I thought that I was going into a real high

39
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:29,760
tech field. I enlisted to be a reactor operator and discovered to my great dismay that that's

40
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,480
not really this amazing high tech thing.

41
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:37,660
I don't know if you know this, but a nuclear reactor is basically a giant Zippo water.

42
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:43,440
It gets hot and it boils water. You run steam turbines with that. The same way you would

43
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:48,160
have it with a coal boiler and a black gang in the late 1800s. You know, they called them

44
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:52,640
black gangs because all the coal dust and they were literally shoveling chunks of rock

45
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:59,040
into a fire. That's what a reactor does. And I don't want to get too deep into my deeply

46
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:04,920
weird Navy career, but like even that didn't end up sticking. And I wound up a whole tech,

47
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:10,320
which basically means like a welder with some other stuff thrown in and that didn't actually

48
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:13,080
suit me, but that was my rate and there was no getting around it.

49
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:23,600
So then I end up in a repair planning department on a large ship and they had IBM PCs in there.

50
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:28,320
Several of them that they would plan jobs on. The PCs weren't networked. You know,

51
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:32,880
they were just individual, not connected to any network at all type stuff up on it and

52
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:39,000
be done. And they ended up needing a pretty massive upgrade that they had no idea how

53
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:44,880
to accomplish because the repair manual for the Navy had upgraded. It went from the repair

54
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:50,480
manual mark one to the repair manual mark two. And the folks, the Frank Cable had been

55
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:58,800
provided this program that somebody had written at the behest and you know, with the money

56
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:04,640
invested of the Navy that would just barely allow you to design a repair job according

57
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:09,720
to the repair manual mark one. But this thing, I mean it was terrible. It was like a fill

58
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:16,220
in the blank kind of a thing. You couldn't copy and paste. You couldn't even non-destructively

59
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:23,920
backspace. It was horrible and there was absolutely no way to make this limited thing, you know,

60
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:28,460
output a job that was planned according to the repair manual mark two.

61
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:32,140
So the repair department is flummoxed. Like they're starting to get yelled at because

62
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:36,400
their repair jobs aren't compliant with the latest regulation. But they're like, you know,

63
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:42,000
we can't because our tools only allow us to do the mark one stuff. And the word gets around

64
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,960
is the word, you know, tends to that, you know, this guy, Petty Officer Salter, he's

65
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:52,000
real good with computer. And so at some point without, you know, no longer knowing what

66
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,400
the hell else to do, these folks asked me, they're like, so if we asked you to, could

67
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:03,640
you write a program like this one that would allow us to, you know, design these jobs in

68
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:09,240
accordance with the brand manual mark two? And I took a very careful look at it and I

69
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:18,080
thought for a day about my answer and I told them the next day, I can, but I shouldn't.

70
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:23,400
Here's what we should do instead. And I got them on board with a plan instead to use the

71
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:28,320
MS-DOS version of WordPerfect. I think it was 5.1. And I said, you know, look, we can

72
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:34,440
design these jobs in WordPerfect. You have all the modern features of writing a document.

73
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:39,040
You do it basically free form, but you adhere to what you're supposed to do. And I said,

74
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:44,720
you know, then further, we have a local network file server that everybody's connected to

75
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:50,840
and we have two drives that everybody can access. We have a working drive that everybody

76
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:55,200
can read and write to. And then we have an approved job drive. So every time a job has

77
00:06:55,200 --> 00:07:00,320
been done being designed and it's been approved and it's ready to go, then the shop supervisor

78
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:05,760
copies that over to the approved drive that everybody can read, but nobody but the supervisor

79
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:11,400
is able to write to. And they know I can copy an old job out of that, know that everything

80
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:17,480
in that is completely kosher, and I can edit that and adapt it to a new job that's similar.

81
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:22,940
This basically tripled shop throughput. It allowed them to get jobs done far quicker,

82
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:26,760
you know, the design phase, than they had been able to do with the old system, as well

83
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:31,520
as, you know, do it in accordance with the repair manual mark one. And I remember thinking

84
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:35,420
to myself, you know, after the dust had settled and I had, you know, designed this network

85
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:40,400
with no kidding, you know, coax in between the machines, you know, old 10 base teeth

86
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:46,360
in that all this kind of thing. And we, you know, we'd had a month or two and I saw how

87
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:53,040
well everything was working. Anyway, I remember very specifically thinking to myself, this,

88
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:57,920
this is how you get things done. You don't just sit down and write a program. Anytime

89
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:01,960
there's something you want to do, you need to have an awareness of what software is out

90
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:08,280
there already and what the actual best way to deal with your real workflow is. And it's

91
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:12,760
not usually going to be right in code from scratch. So that was basically the day that

92
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:19,040
I knew. No, my ideal job was not computer programmer. It was a sad man.

93
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:25,460
That also sounds like the beginnings of the, cause I know you're a big open source fan

94
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:30,840
and it sounds to me like just the way you approached that particular problem took some

95
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:36,960
of those ideas in there. I don't know if you knew open source at that time, but it sounds

96
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:40,640
to me like it was like, okay, well some of these tools already exist. Why are we trying

97
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:46,720
to rewrite them? Maybe we can just implement them in a different way that solves our problems

98
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,880
in the present and also in the future.

99
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:56,200
It's definitely an adjacent thought process, but I was not aware of open source then. Open

100
00:08:56,200 --> 00:09:02,640
source existed, but not very many people really had it on their radar at this point. This

101
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:09,600
would have been, I want to say like 1992, maybe 1993. It was definitely not 94.

102
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,120
Yeah, right.

103
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:18,840
So I wasn't aware of open source. I was familiar with the older, like there were programs that

104
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:24,080
were in the public domain or then later on there was shareware. Open source hadn't reared

105
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:28,840
its head to me personally yet. I do know that when a few years later I did discover open

106
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:36,000
source when I was a civilian again in the mid to late nineties, very rapidly I was like,

107
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,060
this is important. This really means something.

108
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:49,360
Because the difference between I have to go get approval from a boss to get say Photoshop

109
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:55,760
or Microsoft Office or whatever, not only for myself, but for any other people that

110
00:09:55,760 --> 00:10:02,560
I want to enable to do something as a computer person, that's frequently a lot harder than

111
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:07,120
teaching the people or enabling them or getting the thing done, right?

112
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:11,760
That's why you have so many shadow IT departments where people just surreptitiously do whatever.

113
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:17,640
But I'm like, when you've got a program, like say compare GIMP to Photoshop, there

114
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:23,240
are things that Photoshop does considerably better than GIMP, but GIMP is really important

115
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:28,840
even when it's not as good as Photoshop because it's accessible to everybody. When you can

116
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:34,960
do the same thing in both programs and you know how to do the same thing in both programs,

117
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:38,920
that knowledge in GIMP is really important because you can take it with you anywhere

118
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:43,360
and you can use it anywhere. You don't have to get somebody else's approval to use it.

119
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:47,940
You don't have to get somebody else's approval to teach somebody else how to use it. It's

120
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:53,920
just like the whole freaking human race has this thing now and that's amazing.

121
00:10:53,920 --> 00:11:01,320
Yeah. And lowering that barrier of entry is so important for like future creativity and

122
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:07,100
future sort of thought processes too in someone, especially young people, but anybody who's

123
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:08,600
learning something new, right?

124
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:12,880
Yeah, it is. And you know, I mean, there are other awesome things about open source and

125
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:18,680
I bought onto all of those pretty early as well. You know, once I encountered the concept

126
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:23,100
of, you know, like the BSDs and I learned about how, you know, at the time the largest

127
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:28,080
website in the world or the most heavily trafficked, you know, ftp.cdrom.com, I was like, you know,

128
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:31,800
this is running on commodity desktop machines, running a free operating system and it's

129
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:38,160
literally serving more traffic than anything in the world. I'm like, okay, I need some

130
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,160
of that.

131
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:40,560
There must be something here, right?

132
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:44,160
Yeah. So, you know, then when I read, you know, from the other side of the open source

133
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:49,480
camp, Eric S. Raymond's, The Cathedral and the Bazaar, you know, his arguments about

134
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:54,680
how open source produced better code, you know, because of the greater visibility and,

135
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:59,880
you know, peer review and this and that and the other, I was perfectly willing to believe

136
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:04,940
and buy into all that. And, you know, I still do. I think it's very true. I also have the

137
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:12,920
experience of having written proprietary code for purpose myself versus whether it's starting

138
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:19,200
out to write open source code or converting, you know, what had been a proprietary project,

139
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:24,120
you know, into something open source and, and, you know, thinking even before anybody

140
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:29,440
else says anything, just to myself realizing people are going to see this crap I wrote.

141
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:36,480
It needs to be professional. It needs to be good. Just it works, you know, with the thing

142
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:43,000
that you do it for that day is not good enough. And, um, I think it's really hard to get that

143
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:49,160
without open source, you know, I mean you can, you can Institute code reviews within a company

144
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:55,320
for proprietary code, of course, but I don't really see how over the course of time you

145
00:12:55,320 --> 00:13:00,200
don't eventually end up having standard slip a little bit and they may not get all the

146
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:04,040
way down to like, well, this is good enough for me. It's the thing I do and it, you know,

147
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:08,000
doesn't really break off enough to piss me off. Like you can, you can get north of that,

148
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,920
but I don't see how you keep from slipping down to the point where you have this little

149
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:16,960
insular community and well, it just needs to be good enough for this little insular

150
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:21,700
community standards. You don't have to be worried that literally anybody in the world

151
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:26,880
can take a look at this thing that you did that granted it works, but they're like, what

152
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,200
did you do?

153
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:33,040
I think some of the coolest things that happen with open source is when someone takes a project

154
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:40,800
and uses it in a completely different way than originally intended and yet still a plausible

155
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:44,840
application, right? And like perhaps when you wrote the code, you had a certain intention,

156
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:49,760
but could never imagine its other uses. And how much of a gift is that?

157
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:54,460
That is a definite gift. Um, you know, that's also, again, that's, that's one of those things

158
00:13:54,460 --> 00:14:00,840
that leads you to writing higher quality code. When you, you really realize people are liable

159
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:05,880
to use this in ways that I didn't intend. It forces you to write a lot more defensively

160
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:13,760
and consider a lot more use cases. And sometimes that consideration can lead you to avoid errors

161
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:18,400
and what would have been a lot of unnecessary rework because you're thinking from the start

162
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:24,600
with like, okay, how do I make this the most broadly functional and not just functional

163
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:29,080
in this one specific use case that I have for it?

164
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:34,080
So what about the challenges then of taking that approach? I would imagine there are some

165
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:40,400
like that sounds like perhaps more work or more intentional work. What would you say

166
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,360
are the, are the downsides if any?

167
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:49,960
I don't think there are downsides. I mean, it's, it's quote more work unquote, but you

168
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:55,000
know, that's like saying, yeah, it's, it's more work to do a job right than to do it,

169
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:01,400
you know, crappy and half ass. So it's just, it's forcing you to do it right. That's more

170
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:06,480
work than having done it half ass, but you didn't half ass it. So.

171
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:14,340
And so take us back to when you are on that ship. Um, like that was clearly a changing

172
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:18,040
moment for you, but how did things progress for you from there?

173
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:23,060
That's kind of a rough story. So this was the Navy, um, in the early to mid nineties

174
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:29,240
post tail hook era. And I'm still very young. And to understand some of it, you have to

175
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:33,600
understand a little bit of background on like how the Navy works and specific rates work

176
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:39,280
in the Navy. So I went in as a reactor operator, which the base rate to that as ET electronics

177
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:45,000
technician, right? And the reason that I was no longer a reactor operator, it boils down

178
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:50,280
to I pissed off the wrong people. Don't get me wrong. I, I truly meant well and I was

179
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:57,280
a very earnest person as a young man. Like I wanted to do the right thing as a, as a

180
00:15:57,280 --> 00:16:03,840
person, as a soldier for the Navy, as a whole, my unit, the whole mind, but I wanted to have

181
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:07,960
a little bit more input into that process than you're really supposed to have is, you

182
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:15,200
know, like a 19 year old enlisted dude. And that didn't fly. And, um, I disagreed with

183
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:20,800
some of the things that some of the brass were doing in the, uh, in the prototype, the

184
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:27,960
reactor prototype that, um, I was completing my two year Naval nuclear power training pipeline

185
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:32,000
in. And as a result of that, they found a way to get me out of the program to make a

186
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,680
long story short. And I assumed, okay, well I'm going to go to the fleet as an electronics

187
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:41,440
technician, but that's okay. I'll be out of most of this politics that will probably

188
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:45,640
suit me better. It'll be electronics. My dad was a broadcast engineer and I always, you

189
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:49,560
know, like really dug the hole, like, you know, he's over there soldering on circuit

190
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:52,760
boards and whatever. So that's going to be me now. And I had that a school as part of

191
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:57,840
my training, so it's going to be great. It'll be fine. But the Navy decided to cross rate

192
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:02,440
me involuntarily to whole tech, which like I said, is mostly welder. It's a very blue

193
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:10,200
collar thing. And, um, advancement in the enlisted Navy is based first and foremost

194
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:16,160
on how well you take written tests. So what do you think? Does the typical welder do a

195
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:21,200
great job taking written examinations? I would imagine that's not their forte. It is not

196
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:27,640
their forte. Um, it was my forte, which is, you know, the majority of the reason why at

197
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:33,400
not quite 20 years old, I was an E five. So that's the rate that was the rank that I got

198
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:37,120
cross rated into as a whole tech. And I went to a whole tech a school, you know, which

199
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:43,720
is all of like seven weeks of, you know, learned to weld. And then I'm, you know, unleashed

200
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:50,000
on the fleet as an E five, you know, theoretically whole tech, but a real HD two, you know, whole

201
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:55,440
tech second class, that's E five, a real HD two typically started welding, uh, when they

202
00:17:55,440 --> 00:18:00,020
were in high school or junior high school was already really good at it before they

203
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:05,880
ever joined the Navy. Uh, and then because they're not typically good at all at written

204
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:10,960
examinations, they'll end up having to retake the tests and, you know, get more points just

205
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:14,400
for time and service to the point that there probably won't be 30 by the time they hit

206
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:20,900
E five, but they're pushing 30. So now here's me. I literally just had my 20th birthday

207
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:27,420
in a school and you know, I'm, I'm an HT two and that does not fly with whole tech.

208
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:32,400
So that's what gets me into the, you know, the shop with all the computers in it, which

209
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:37,320
was whole techs and machinist mates, but there's computers here. That's also why finally getting

210
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:41,320
to answering your, your, your real question, you know, how did things go from there? So

211
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:46,620
I did this awesome thing and you know, made the, the, uh, planning and repair shop way

212
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:51,500
more efficient. How'd that go for me? And the answer is I got absolutely terrible performance

213
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:56,840
valuations because although I had done this great thing with the computers, that wasn't

214
00:18:56,840 --> 00:19:00,320
my job and I wasn't much of a whole tech.

215
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:07,600
Oh, and so do you feel like that is a problem with such hierarchical structures of that

216
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:12,960
sort? Is that if you didn't do the specific thing you were designed to do, even though

217
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:16,800
it was for the greater good that it's seen as a negative?

218
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:23,820
I think that's a problem that a lot of really capable people have and any, I'm not trying

219
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:29,120
to puff myself up, but a lot of the people who do go on to change the world, they're

220
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:34,160
so frequently or, you know, like college dropouts or whatever. I think the reason for that is

221
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:39,760
that really capable people frequently don't fit well in organizations. You know, organizations

222
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:45,080
are specifically trying to avoid needing really unusual people because they want to be able

223
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:50,840
to replace personnel as they retire or leave for a different job or whatever.

224
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:57,120
So when you have somebody who's really capable, who shows up, if you're running that organization,

225
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:01,120
if you're an exceptional leader, maybe you can figure out something great to do with

226
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:08,260
that person and you can figure out kind of a transition in and a transition out where

227
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:14,960
you use this exceptional person to do an exceptional thing that lasts and can be carried on, you

228
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:19,000
know, by the people that you can find day in and day out.

229
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:24,720
If you're not an exceptional leader, then one of two things happens. Either that person

230
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:30,480
ends up making those changes anyway, but doing it, you know, outside the scope of the organization

231
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:35,160
and they basically become, I mean, they're kind of a cancer. You know, you ever work

232
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:40,600
someplace where you're like, oh, you know, you got to talk to Joe back in the back. Like

233
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:44,000
he's the only one that knows how to do, you know, half these things.

234
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:49,840
Well, so on the one hand, Joe's probably a really capable person, but on the other hand,

235
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:53,840
he's cancer to that organization because what happens when Joe's out sick or what happens

236
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:59,860
when Joe retires or dies or moves on or whatever, the organization's kind of screwed, right?

237
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:06,440
So you either end up with a Joe and, you know, your people don't really know how to get the

238
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:11,940
mission accomplished. Or, you know, if again, you know, you're not the great leader and

239
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:17,000
you don't know what to do with a Joe, Joe just ends up getting fired. You know, you

240
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:23,400
yell at him all the time. You, you piss him off. Maybe you fire him, maybe he quits, but

241
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:27,160
you know, it doesn't work. You didn't find a place for Joe in your organization because

242
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:33,000
there's this like inherent mismatch, right? Yeah. One of you is really bad for the other.

243
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:37,500
So moving it back to me, I mentioned, you know, I got, uh, the worst eval of my Navy

244
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:44,200
career immediately after tripling the throughput of this shop. Wow. You want to hear about

245
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:49,680
the best eval I got in my Navy career? I could just imagine, I'm going to guess at it probably

246
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:54,800
when you just didn't do very much and wasn't very inspired or. Oh, it is so much more colorful

247
00:21:54,800 --> 00:22:00,240
than that Brent. Oh, please give it to me. So, uh, you know, fast forward a couple of

248
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:06,020
years and I'm no longer stationed on board Frank Cable. Um, now I'm on the Charleston

249
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:11,160
Naval base, uh, and the repair division of SEMA, the shore intermediate maintenance activity.

250
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:15,640
I'm still fixing boats, but now I'm doing it from a building rather than another boat.

251
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:23,520
And I end up in their, um, automated reports and retrieval system maintenance document

252
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:29,880
collection. So the acronym doesn't matter. What really matters is what the job of ours

253
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:36,240
Medco was is, uh, everybody's using these AT&T 3B2 mini computers. Uh, actually they're

254
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:39,480
not using the mini computer directly. They've got dumb terminals in every shop and on the

255
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:45,400
dumb terminal, they have an application that they log in, uh, all the, the personnel hours

256
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:50,600
that were worked on these repair jobs for each shop. Right? So, uh, maybe you got three

257
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:57,560
E4s and an E5, uh, your shop will be budgeted a certain amount of personnel hours and you

258
00:22:57,560 --> 00:23:01,760
document how you spent them, whether it was on this job or that job or the other job or

259
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:07,420
training or they took leave. You, you, you enter all this stuff in. So this goes to ours

260
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:14,000
Medco and ours Medco's job is to analyze this and look for trends, either good or bad,

261
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:19,900
which ultimately usually just turns into an exercise of the higher ups who direct ours

262
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:25,480
Medco tell us, look for this particular statistic and we will come down like the hammer of God

263
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:30,320
on anybody that has too high a number on that statistic. Okay. You remember the, the cartoon

264
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:33,720
way back in the day, Bugs Bunny with the dam and like he keeps sticking his finger in the

265
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:38,880
hole and then another hole pops open and the water comes out of there. Yeah. So, I mean,

266
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:42,320
this is what goes on, right? Like, you know, you've got your bad stat of the week. So all

267
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:47,040
the shops lie about that bad stat of the week because they've heard which one it is. Um,

268
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:52,200
and meanwhile they camouflage, you know, all the evidence of not a whole lot of efficiency

269
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:58,280
going on in something else. So we got all this stuff going on. Uh, the brass doesn't

270
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:03,880
really have much of any genuine idea of how efficient all the shops are, but everybody's

271
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:07,720
doing all this active stuff and rah, rah, rah, I'm doing my part to, you know, make

272
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:14,920
sure everything's efficient. So part of this job, uh, was we would have to take these reports

273
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:20,560
that were printed out on, you know, wide format, uh, tractor feeds paper, you know, the old

274
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:25,200
school like alternating green and white rows. Um, all this stuff would be physically printed

275
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:33,600
out from the 3B2 and in order to analyze it, we would then have to type it back in to a

276
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:44,840
different application on the same dumb terminal connected to the same 3B2. Oh no. Yeah, it

277
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:50,120
was fabulous. Um, so, so, you know, we're, we're doing this as what it boils down to.

278
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:54,800
Um, and you do this at night. Uh, it's like a swing shift, you know, after the normal

279
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:57,620
working hours are done for all the shops, you get all their time for the day and you

280
00:24:57,620 --> 00:25:02,560
enter their time in one night I'm working with this guy, petty officer Baron. He's also

281
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:09,680
a second class and an E5 and he's on his way out of the Navy in theory, um, on a, a medical

282
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:16,720
discharge because his shoulder got hurt. And, uh, Baron was one of these sailors who you

283
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:23,800
have to demonstrate to him that he has to do something or there will be bad consequences

284
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:26,520
or he's not going to do it. He's not going to take your word for it. There's going to

285
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:30,560
be bad consequences. You know, you're going to have to go through the whole cycle with

286
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:35,400
this guy. So putting him on swing shift with another junior enlisted person and no other

287
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:42,720
supervision is not the best answer. And, uh, everybody else has left. It's like five o'clock.

288
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:47,320
Um, people have only been gone for like half an hour. We've got another three, four hours

289
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:51,600
worth of work, you know, for the two of us together to get done before we can be done

290
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:56,960
and go home. And, uh, Baron just looks at me and says, well, that's it. I'm done, man.

291
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:04,000
You look, I'm out. And I'm like, what? No, you're not. You got to do your half of this

292
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:10,360
crap. Um, and, uh, so Baron just tries to head for the door and, uh, I have already

293
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:15,880
informed him. Yes, I will physically prevent him from leaving. So we get in a knock down

294
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:23,960
drag out fight. This is not a fist fight. Nobody threw a punch, but I will say that

295
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:29,280
I left a dent in the office coffee maker, the exact size and shape of his skull. And

296
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:33,800
it finally ended up, uh, I will admit he was bigger than, than I was. And, uh, it ended

297
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:38,880
up with him bending me backwards over a table with one arm behind me and a hammer lock.

298
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:42,860
And as his thumb went down toward my eyeball, I told him, if you touch my eye, you're going

299
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:48,840
to have to kill me. And then he let go. And we sat there just like coffin for a few minutes.

300
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:53,000
Like, have you ever really gotten in a hard fight for awhile? And like, you're just coughing

301
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:57,120
afterward because you've been exerting yourself. Yeah. So it's that. Wow. So I was a little

302
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:01,820
bit, I was in considerably better shape than he was. So I was like recovered quicker than

303
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:05,920
he was. Um, he still kind of, you know, breathing heavy and coughing and he said, all right,

304
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:09,920
well I'm out of here. And I said, no, you're not. And he's like, what are you talking about?

305
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:18,960
I won the fight. I said, you ready to do it again? Man, F you Salter. And so we finished

306
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:26,400
out the night, but you know, in the course of this like 15 minute, uh, barrage of physically

307
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:30,280
throwing each other around the office, we have shredded like half the paperwork, you

308
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:35,040
know, under the wheels of the rolling chairs. Like I said, I left a clearly skull shaped

309
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:40,520
dent in the coffee maker. Um, you know, and you can imagine the rest of the damage, although

310
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:47,340
we didn't break any equipment to the point of unusability, but it's very obvious. Some,

311
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:53,240
some crap has gone down the next morning. And, uh, when I roll in at, uh, you know,

312
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:58,960
about, uh, noon, because again, I'm working the swing shift doing this stuff. Uh, the,

313
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:03,160
the chief petty officer who also was my chief on board the Frank cable and gave me the terrible,

314
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:07,860
you know, evaluation there. Oh yeah. Uh, he was like, you know, Salter, what the hell

315
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:14,440
happened in here last night? And I'm like, Oh man, cause you know, there, there was a

316
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:21,680
time, uh, that just brawls between sailors and the Navy were openly to be expected. But

317
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:28,080
that time was in the Vietnam era. It was not post tail hook. And I'm just like, you know,

318
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:35,100
once I tell chief Millie this, it can't be untold. So I look at him and I maintain eye

319
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:41,160
contact for a second and say, are you sure you want me to answer that question chief?

320
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:46,440
And, uh, he is just spit man. He's like, you know, you're, you're F and D and blah, blah,

321
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:50,960
and right. I want you to answer that question, Salter. And I said, I need to close the door,

322
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:55,600
chief. He said, all right, everybody out. And the couple other people that were in there,

323
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:59,880
you know, eagerly anticipating, they, they file out disappointedly. And I go close the

324
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:03,600
door and I sit back down and I, I explained the whole thing to him. I tell him, you know,

325
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:10,960
everything that went on. And, uh, he says, all right, I said, so am I okay chief? And

326
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:16,720
he said, yep, you're fine. Good job. Glad you made him do his work. And I'm just like,

327
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:23,640
okay. So that eval period, I got a four, four Oh is a perfect eval in the Navy. I got four

328
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:29,880
Oh across the board, including in leadership, which is a, a, a step that is not normally

329
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:35,200
measured for an E five. Like that's an optional and it's not normally actually evaluated until

330
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:39,100
you know, you hit E six. Yeah. I got four Oh across the board, including leadership

331
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:44,080
for bashing Baron's head into the coffee maker and leaving a debt of that is great. I, I,

332
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:49,120
I thought maybe this story was going to go into some kind of like efficiency, uh, section,

333
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:55,200
but clearly you were, uh, enforcing your own dismay with apparently what I was actually

334
00:29:55,200 --> 00:30:04,600
doing is finally I was fitting into the organization. Oh, interesting. And when did you realize

335
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:09,840
that like for yourself, when did you say, Oh shit, now I actually, I'm one of them.

336
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:15,520
I don't know if I ever articulated it before right now, honestly, but you know, like I've,

337
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:20,560
I've had, uh, I've had the thoughts before about how, you know, an inordinately capable

338
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:25,720
person in an organization can easily end up becoming a cancer to the organization and

339
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:32,040
how, you know, I have been cancer to organizations in the past myself. And so, you know, just

340
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:35,160
saying all those things to you at the same time, it's like, it's kind of obviously you'll

341
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:40,120
okay. Yeah. It was, it's, it's a funny story. And that's what got me the four Oh evals,

342
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:44,520
but it also fits, you know, into the whole context we've been talking about. I finally

343
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:48,960
fit into the organization and did it really well. The organization needed me to make this

344
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:54,280
recalcitrant petty officer do his job. And I did that. And you know, there you go. Here's

345
00:30:54,280 --> 00:31:01,800
your four Oh, interesting. I did notice earlier today, uh, and this will be a slight aside

346
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:07,080
was totally connected. I ran into a word twice this morning. Uh, and then I was like, okay,

347
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:11,880
I got to go research what the heck this word means. And so I was looking at, um, a brain

348
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:18,960
pickings article about Martha Martin Luther King and, uh, the word in specific was gadfly.

349
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:24,360
And I ran into that word again in your Twitter description. And I was like, all right, I

350
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:29,200
gotta go look this up. Cause it wasn't a term I had run into. Uh, can you give us a quick

351
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:35,760
like what a gadfly is? And I think that might just tie into this story a little bit.

352
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:41,080
A gadfly is just, it's a constant irritant that you just can't quite get to leave you

353
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:46,140
alone. That just keeps causing problems and you swat at it and swat at it. But you know,

354
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:48,040
it's still there, still buzzing in your ear.

355
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:53,520
Yeah. So I, I was doing a deep dive on this word cause it ended up really speaking to

356
00:31:53,520 --> 00:32:00,760
me. And, um, I grabbed that it actually, the first mention of it in that context was from

357
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:06,600
Socrates. And he said, you know, just to paraphrase stinging people into fury in service of the

358
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:12,560
truth. And I thought, Oh, that is interesting. And when you were telling this story, I was

359
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:16,080
thinking about that thinking, yep, that's pretty accurate.

360
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:21,480
Yeah. Yeah. It's, it's, uh, it it's me.

361
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:28,320
At least I feel like we need people who are pushing some buttons and asking the hard questions

362
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:32,800
and doing the deep dives where other people maybe aren't, aren't willing to.

363
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:39,200
I mean, the positive way to look at being a gadfly is, uh, you know, it's contextual.

364
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:47,640
It's you need one when you have a negative complacency that needs to be disturbed. And

365
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:52,400
that's something that, uh, you know, like it or not, I'm really well suited to, I am

366
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:56,200
that guy that comes into the like, Oh, well, you know, everything's normal and this is

367
00:32:56,200 --> 00:33:01,400
fine, but it's not fine. And just won't leave you alone about like, no, no, no, actually

368
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:06,960
pick your head up and look around you. This is not good. There are better ways or at the

369
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:12,040
very least, this is not good. And we need to think about it. I'm, I'm that guy, whether

370
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:16,800
I like it or not, whether you like it or not, I am that guy. So I might as well find, you

371
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:18,640
know, positive ways to do it.

372
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:25,920
I feel like having people like you is definitely a good tool, uh, in keeping everybody in check

373
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:30,820
to those people looking and looking over our shoulders to keep us doing the good work and

374
00:33:30,820 --> 00:33:38,640
not the bad work. Uh, so thank you from the community for doing that kind of stuff.

375
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:43,440
You don't always get thanks for being the irritating fly buzzing, but, uh, you're welcome

376
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:44,600
and thank you.

377
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:49,440
And that's kind of what's captured in, in that word, right? Is like you're an irritation,

378
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:57,600
but with the greater good in mind. And that's kind of a tough position to play because you're

379
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:59,920
the bad guy and the good guy all at once, right?

380
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:00,920
Yeah, it is.

381
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:02,600
Does that ever put you down?

382
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:07,200
Well, to, to, to answer a different question that you didn't actually ask, um, you know,

383
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:12,320
GADfly is one of those things that for me, it feels comfortable to call myself that because

384
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:17,000
I feel like there is some humility in it. You know, like you're not saying, Oh, you

385
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:22,680
know, I'm this awesome person. I'm this great leader. You know, I'm this, uh, influencer.

386
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:26,920
You're just, you know, I'm the irritating fly that's buzzing around in your ear. I feel

387
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:31,360
like it's okay to say that about yourself. And then you kind of let everybody else judge

388
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:36,240
like, okay, well, you know, is this a good irritant or a bad irritant?

389
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:40,400
That distinction is actually important.

390
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:43,120
It gets, um, productive irritant.

391
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:47,360
So like you can strive to be a productive irritant, but I think it's, it's fair to

392
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:52,920
say I'm an irritant and it's, it's certainly fair to say I strive to be productive, but

393
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:56,520
you let everybody else judge that. You don't, you don't get to make that call about yourself.

394
00:34:56,520 --> 00:35:03,000
I mean, if you do, that's how you become the person in need of a GADfly yourself, right?

395
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:07,640
Cause you've sunken into that unproductive complacency of just like, Oh, you know, I'm

396
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:08,640
awesome.

397
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:13,200
You know, there's this trope about, uh, you know, Roman emperor supposedly had somebody

398
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:18,100
on hand, like at all times beside them to just occasionally throughout the day, lean

399
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:23,640
over and murmur into their ear. You too are mortal. You will die. Uh, you know, to keep

400
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:28,840
them grounded in the idea that, you know, I am just a person, I'm not a God, you know,

401
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:30,800
here at the head of the Roman empire.

402
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:40,300
We all need a, that and B to do what we can ourselves to avoid really obviously needing

403
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:41,300
that.

404
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:45,660
Yeah. It sounds to me like there's a little bit of stoic philosophy in there that you

405
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:52,560
just threw in there is like, we all have faults and all need to be reminded of that and that

406
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:59,080
we're mortal. And, uh, I guess sometimes it's important to remember that our time here is

407
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:04,040
pretty short and we should try to do the, the best possible things we can with that

408
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:08,120
time or those efforts, even if it's a bit challenging.

409
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:12,360
And also, you know, that we're, we're all part of a society. If you want to talk, you

410
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:17,720
know, philosophy, then now we're getting into John done, but yeah, no, no person is an island.

411
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:23,560
We are all part of a greater society and we need to fit into it and we need to be good

412
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:27,680
and be productive with and for one another as well as for ourselves.

413
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:31,840
You know, as you were saying that, I was thinking, Oh, doesn't the Navy fit into that too? You

414
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:36,800
know, there's this interconnected web of people that you don't get to choose those people.

415
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:42,040
Well, I suppose the Navy does, but true of our greater society too, right? Like we all

416
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:47,340
have to find a way to create an excellent environment that we all want to be a part

417
00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:48,340
of.

418
00:36:48,340 --> 00:36:55,480
It's, it's so easy to veer into uncomfortable, you know, political directions, but how many

419
00:36:55,480 --> 00:37:01,640
people do you know who aren't wall street stock brokers who just wax enthusiastic about

420
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:07,240
how lucky we are to have like wall street, you know, stock players among us who are just

421
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:12,360
flinging around, you know, these stocks several times a day and you know, pocketing changes

422
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:14,480
in value as they move them around.

423
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:20,020
Um, you know, I hear arguments about, you know, technically why that supposedly creates

424
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:26,440
fluidity that, you know, assists business and happening, which all sound kind of dubious,

425
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:30,520
but uh, you know, at the end of the day, it's like, okay, what are you really doing for

426
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:38,440
the world? And I feel like if you don't have a clear and cogent answer as to what your

427
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:43,960
career is doing positive for the world, and it doesn't have to be like amazing, right?

428
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:50,600
I mean, if you're working at a fast food place and you're making sandwiches, you are accomplishing

429
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:55,880
a real good for the world. You know, I mean, you are a necessary part in a system that

430
00:37:55,880 --> 00:38:00,960
freaking feeds people. That's great. You go home and you hold your head high, but you

431
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:04,360
know, if you're making a ton of money, but you're having a lot of trouble putting your

432
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:10,600
finger on like, okay, you know, what's the thing I do that makes people's lives better?

433
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:14,760
What's the value you're providing? Yeah. What's the value you're providing? Like if you can't

434
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:22,540
really answer that solidly, if you can't feel it in your bones, I don't know how to wrap

435
00:38:22,540 --> 00:38:28,240
that up exactly. Other than, you know, that's, it's not, it's not good. So it sounds pretty

436
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:32,040
important to stop every once in a while and take a look at what you're doing and measure

437
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:36,800
whether the value you're providing is the kind of value you want to be injecting into

438
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:41,680
the world. Absolutely. For you, like some of your writing that you're doing, cause you're,

439
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:47,000
you're clearly doing some for Ars Technica and I think in a few other places, um, what

440
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:51,760
would you say is like the main motivator then for that kind of writing? What are you trying

441
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:56,280
to achieve with it? That literally just came up in a comment thread. Give me a second.

442
00:38:56,280 --> 00:39:04,360
Let me look that up. Really? Okay. So, uh, Ars Reader, VFRX wrote, first read through

443
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:08,880
Jim's articles really seems targeted to techie prosumer people. I'm not saying it's a bad

444
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:13,240
thing and I'm not saying the sysadmins don't read this site, but this conversation section

445
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:18,000
and they're referring, you know, to the comments on that article has rarely left me thinking

446
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:23,640
I'm talking to adults or professionals. So it struck a chord with me and I had to sit

447
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:27,040
down, like I had to put the phone down and sit down at a computer and apply to it because

448
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:31,260
I had an answer for that. I'm like, I've actually given some serious thought to this.

449
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:37,880
My own personal strictly techie blog is focused purely on it professionals or seriously advanced

450
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:43,040
prosumer types. But when writing for ours, I usually intend my writing to be, and this

451
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:48,600
is a bulleted list, an appetizer for the technically minded or technically interested general audience,

452
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:54,320
a dessert for senior it people in or adjacent to the discipline I'm writing about. Finally,

453
00:39:54,320 --> 00:40:00,440
most importantly, last bullet, a hearty meal for larval form or junior it professionals.

454
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:04,360
So you know, that's, that's my biggest thing is I want to reach the people who are where

455
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:10,040
I was, you know, when I was in my teens and twenties and didn't quite know, I knew that,

456
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:13,200
you know, I wanted to do computer stuff and that computer stuff was cool and there were

457
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:19,280
all these amazing potentials. I kind of sensed out there, but I wasn't quite sure how to

458
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:25,760
get there. Right? Those are the people that I'm absolutely the most interested in reaching.

459
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:29,560
I do definitely want to reach, you know, the people who are just kind of interested and

460
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:35,440
I do want to reach and make my content valuable for my peers. But it's those junior folks

461
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:40,180
I really, really want to be like, Oh, awesome. Jim wrote about this thing and like that got

462
00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:43,600
me excited about it. And then I went and you know, started getting my hands dirty with

463
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:48,160
it. Now I can do a thing. That's, that's my big go to.

464
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:52,720
So inspiring others to, to create good in their own way.

465
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:58,040
Inspiring them to become more capable. Given what I'm writing about, it's, it's hard to

466
00:40:58,040 --> 00:41:02,840
say that, you know, particularly the technical stuff. I mean, you can talk about, you know,

467
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:07,520
the good in some ethical sense I might be doing by, you know, pissing off Linus Torvalds

468
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:11,600
when he gets too shirty. Um, but you know, for the most part, if like if I'm writing

469
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:16,760
about a VPN or, you know, some mesh networking or whatever, it feels a little too highfalutin

470
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:21,800
to say, you know, I'm helping people do good. I mean, maybe I am, but ultimately really

471
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:28,240
what I'm doing is I'm, I'm trying to make people more capable, more self-determined.

472
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:34,280
Well, maybe simply by giving them the tools, it gives them the option to do whatever they

473
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:38,520
may with them. But without tools, you can't do very much. Can you?

474
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:43,720
Without tools and you know, some, some understanding of, you know, what you can do with them and

475
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:49,240
how. So like I can show somebody what Nebula is, you know, the, uh, Slack engineering's,

476
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:53,840
uh, VPN mesh product. I can tell somebody what it is and I can tell them how to set

477
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:59,240
it up and I can, I can point out, you know, some of the like really cool general, very

478
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:04,440
broad new concepts and capabilities it brings. But like, I don't want to tell somebody like

479
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:10,480
exactly how to use it necessarily. I want people to know like what this thing is and

480
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:16,120
like, you know, what, what its shape in the world looks like and, you know, give them

481
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:19,160
an ability to start getting their hands dirty with it and, you know, really start doing

482
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:24,120
stuff. And I fully expect that, you know, lots of them will do things that I never thought

483
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:27,160
of, you know, I mean, but that's, that's the whole point, right?

484
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:30,400
That's the whole idea of leadership, isn't it? To inspire others.

485
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:35,840
Leadership and, uh, you know, open source and Unix modular design. Yeah. All of that.

486
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:39,500
Yeah. It's always been interesting to me how, and I'm not sure which comes first, but we'll

487
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:47,380
explore that here. Um, I'm always curious how the spirit of open source can be applied

488
00:42:47,380 --> 00:42:53,640
to far more than just software. And what I mean by which came first is like, are the

489
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:59,140
people who are so passionate about open source, like you and I, are they interested because

490
00:42:59,140 --> 00:43:04,080
that's where their nature is and open source is just a really beautiful way to let that

491
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:10,680
shine or is it that it inspires people to just look at things differently and to solve

492
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:12,400
problems in a different way?

493
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:16,280
I mean, it's going to be different for different people, right? I think I was just about the

494
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:21,520
most fertile ground possible for the seed of open source to reach because, you know,

495
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:27,960
the concept of empowerment and the philosophical ideals and the pragmatism of some really impressive

496
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:32,240
code, like all of that just all came together and every last bit of that is what I was looking

497
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:38,260
for, right? I mean, open source was firing on all cylinders as far as like how to reach

498
00:43:38,260 --> 00:43:42,840
and impress a larval form, Jim Salter. Right. But, um, you know, there's going to be a lot

499
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:47,040
of people that, uh, they're affected by the philosophical stuff, but they don't, they

500
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:50,920
don't really want to think about it. They don't care about it personally. Maybe they

501
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:56,160
should. They don't, it's not wrong. I mean, I feel like it's kind of a shame that everybody

502
00:43:56,160 --> 00:44:02,520
doesn't see that, but not everybody's going to see things the same way you do. And that's

503
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:06,960
okay. Right. So some people are just going to be like, well, you know, I don't really

504
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:11,200
care about GPL or MIT or whatever. I just care that, you know, here's this awesome

505
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:15,920
software and I want to use it. It's the best software for the use case. And that's okay

506
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:19,440
too. It's like the pragmatic approach. You know, you'll have people with philosophical

507
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:24,800
disagreements over, you know, whether the quote correct unquote approach to open source

508
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:31,560
is, you know, strong copy left or weak permissive. And, um, it's, it's okay to have your own

509
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:36,760
thoughts about, you know, which one is better for more things. But the most important thing

510
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:43,560
is to remember that there is no one correct answer. The world actually needs both. You

511
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:48,740
know, there's, there's kind of this waterfall when it comes to licensing and just the pragmatic

512
00:44:48,740 --> 00:44:55,480
capability of tools, right? If you have a near universal need that can be fulfilled

513
00:44:55,480 --> 00:45:01,280
by software, that need will frequently be fulfilled first by proprietary software, but

514
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:05,320
proprietary software has its hurdles, right? Like you have to pay money for it and maybe

515
00:45:05,320 --> 00:45:09,440
you don't even care about the money, but maybe dealing with that is a pain in the butt.

516
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:13,080
Like, you know, you end up, you're running a company and now you're paying somebody 65

517
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:18,080
grand to be your licensed compliance officer. And you know, it's annoying and getting in

518
00:45:18,080 --> 00:45:23,680
your way and you want to be able to do without it. And you either then are motivated to write

519
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:29,840
or to find and consume some open source product. And now you've done away with the roadblocks

520
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:34,440
that proprietary put in your place, but you're still doing the thing you wanted to do. So

521
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:40,880
there was still the proprietary software didn't fulfill all the motivations to write open

522
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:46,160
source software to do the same thing, right? So eventually somebody is going to do that.

523
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:50,480
Once it becomes trivial enough, once it's a well enough understood concept, maybe once

524
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:55,640
computing resources have become more powerful one way or another, eventually the task that

525
00:45:55,640 --> 00:45:59,340
proprietary software accomplished, somebody is going to do something open source. Now

526
00:45:59,340 --> 00:46:04,640
let's say that the person who did it open source, they wrote a GPL and that's fine and

527
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:10,040
that's good. And one of the wonderful things about the GPL is that it prevents some really,

528
00:46:10,040 --> 00:46:16,560
you know, well-heeled organization from co-opting your code and turning it proprietary and then

529
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:21,720
changing it once it's proprietary and choking out your original code base, right?

530
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:28,640
That's good, but, but it still gets in some people's way. Somebody wants to be able to,

531
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:33,240
you know, add that library into a proprietary project or a weak permissive license project

532
00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:38,640
or something that doesn't mix and match well with the GPL. To do that, they need a weak

533
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:43,560
permissive license. So even though now you've got proprietary software that does this thing

534
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:48,640
and you've got GPL software that does this thing, eventually if it's a strong enough,

535
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:53,200
universal enough need, somebody is going to be motivated to write and other people are

536
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:58,480
going to be motivated to consume a weak permissive license version of the thing.

537
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:06,160
So ultimately everything is flowing downhill towards the most permissive, least restrictive

538
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:11,920
licensed version of the thing that the absolute most of humanity can use. But there's reasons

539
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:17,480
for proprietary licenses to make sense. There's obviously reasons for the GPL to make sense

540
00:47:17,480 --> 00:47:23,800
and all my own code is licensed GPL v3. But yeah, I think you have to recognize and realize

541
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:29,460
that whatever your personal thing you got going on is, all of these are valid approaches

542
00:47:29,460 --> 00:47:30,460
to a problem.

543
00:47:30,460 --> 00:47:33,040
They all have their value in their place somewhere, right?

544
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:35,560
They do. They absolutely do.

545
00:47:35,560 --> 00:47:42,200
So Jim, if you wanted to put something out to the community, like an ask of the community

546
00:47:42,200 --> 00:47:47,280
or something you'd like them to think about, that kind of thing, what would you like to

547
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:48,740
send out there?

548
00:47:48,740 --> 00:47:57,080
It's frustrating to me to see the nonstop divisiveness and being jerks to one another.

549
00:47:57,080 --> 00:48:02,520
BSD fans say Linux is terrible and you shouldn't use Linux and you should come use BSD. Linux

550
00:48:02,520 --> 00:48:07,480
fans say BSD is terrible and you shouldn't use that and everything should be GPL or everything

551
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:13,400
should be Linux. Licensing fans argue about the licenses and sow all this hate about that.

552
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:20,200
Cut it out. Do your thing. Do a good thing. If you think the world needs a GPL version

553
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:27,880
of a tool, then develop that thing or find that thing and consume it. Add to its value.

554
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:35,120
Tell other people about it. File bug reports. Submit patches. Do positive stuff. Don't

555
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:41,400
spend all your time saying, oh well BSD license version of thing is terrible or anything written

556
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:48,640
on their cuddle is terrible. No, be positive. We got enough negative in the world. Be positive.

557
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:51,720
That's coming from a guy that calls himself a gadfly.

558
00:48:51,720 --> 00:49:00,640
Well put. Yeah, we're hearing that often now from a bunch of different people. I certainly

559
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:09,560
hope that the hope for good there can overwhelm that negativity. Of course, I'm sort of an

560
00:49:09,560 --> 00:49:13,840
optimist. I do want to make one clarification though.

561
00:49:13,840 --> 00:49:16,280
Please. Another thing that I see called for a lot

562
00:49:16,280 --> 00:49:21,320
is oh well if we just didn't have all these desktop environments. We got all these different

563
00:49:21,320 --> 00:49:26,960
things competing. That's what's keeping us down. No, no, no. That is the exact opposite

564
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:31,460
of how open source works. Open source works because you can do your thing that satisfies

565
00:49:31,460 --> 00:49:35,540
your need and other people can contribute to it and make it better and the best ideas

566
00:49:35,540 --> 00:49:42,360
rise to the top. Neither open source nor software development in general works by telling 50,000

567
00:49:42,360 --> 00:49:47,080
people your job is now to code this one piece of software the way that I want you to code

568
00:49:47,080 --> 00:49:52,720
it. That's not how it works. Please stop. If you think your thing, whether it's you

569
00:49:52,720 --> 00:50:01,360
wrote it or you use it or whatever is great, then promote it in positive ways. Don't neg

570
00:50:01,360 --> 00:50:06,480
everybody else's thing. Don't say everybody else's thing needs to go away. Just promote

571
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:07,480
your thing.

572
00:50:07,480 --> 00:50:11,800
Yeah. What I find most interesting about some open source projects and the tools that have

573
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:18,000
risen to the top is that they tend not to rise to the top because someone has paid all

574
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:22,460
sorts of marketing dollars for it. They rise to the top because they're great innovative

575
00:50:22,460 --> 00:50:29,280
ideas and because other people tend to believe in them. What better reason for that stuff

576
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:30,280
to float to the top?

577
00:50:30,280 --> 00:50:36,480
Yeah, you accrete mindshare. That's how things float to the top, especially in the open source

578
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:44,000
world is the accrete mindshare, the accrete developer mindshare, the accrete user mindshare.

579
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:48,360
They reach the attention of people who do promotion, whether it's professional promotion

580
00:50:48,360 --> 00:50:53,240
or circle of friends or whatever. That's how you get to the top. You get to the top by

581
00:50:53,240 --> 00:50:54,560
making something awesome.

582
00:50:54,560 --> 00:50:59,840
Jim, thank you so much for joining me today. I have learned certainly a lot in this conversation

583
00:50:59,840 --> 00:51:04,200

584
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:05,200
Thanks for having me, Brent.

585
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:30,240
