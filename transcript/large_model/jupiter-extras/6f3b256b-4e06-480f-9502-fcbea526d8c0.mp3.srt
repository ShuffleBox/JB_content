00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,040
Hey there, this is Cut from our Linux Unplugged pre-show from episode 426.

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:09,760
If you'd like to get content like this every week, become a member at unpluggedcore.com.

3
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:16,720
Here's what I figured we'd do. I figured we'd have a little fun right now and we'd talk about

4
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:20,080
what's going on, because I don't know if I want this in the main show or not, I haven't decided

5
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:27,920
yet. And I'm not sure if everybody is current on what's going on, but Linus Sebastian and his

6
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:33,040
cohort, what's Luke's last name? I can't remember Luke's last name, but they announced on their

7
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:38,400
WAN podcast, their WAN show podcast, that they want to do a challenge of running desktop Linux

8
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:44,800
for an extended period of time. And this came about after talking about the anti-cheat support

9
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:50,240
that's landed for Linux. Linus asked Luke if he's up for a challenge and I got a clip of that.

10
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,320
Do you want to do a challenge with me?

11
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,080
Oh, okay.

12
00:00:54,080 --> 00:01:01,600
Yes. We each borrow an SSD from the office and we both try to install Linux on our daily driver

13
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:08,720
gaming PCs. At the same time, we see who lasts longer. So there's clearly a focus on gaming

14
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:14,400
from the very beginning. That's where they're going with this. And there's going to be a

15
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:21,440
punishment for whoever blinks first. And I thought, okay, maybe this is a passing thing.

16
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:25,520
But then they doubled down and confirmed it in the following WAN show the next week that

17
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:32,720
the challenge is in fact real. So the challenge is real. The challenge is happening. Luke and I

18
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:39,760
are going to be switching to Linux on our daily driver machines. This may in fact be the last WAN

19
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:47,360
show that I broadcast on a Windows machine for quite some time. And we haven't figured out exactly

20
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:54,320
what the punishment for blinking first is going to be. But whoever goes back to Windows first

21
00:01:54,320 --> 00:02:01,120
is going to have to do something. I saw one really good suggestion. Dying your hair in four

22
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:09,440
quadrants, the Windows colors, might be a kind of fun one. It's not permanent. You're not maimed or

23
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:13,600
anything, but it's certainly... Or you'd have to run it the whole way out.

24
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:14,880
Not the best. Yeah.

25
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:18,720
You can't shave your head. It would have to be reasonable haircuts and stuff like that.

26
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:22,080
Yeah. Yeah. You're not allowed to re-dye it. That would be ridiculous.

27
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:27,920
So I'm mixed on this. I think in part it's great. And it's going to be potentially fun

28
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:33,680
for their audience to watch this proceed. And it probably means Linux is going to get a lot

29
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:39,360
of coverage on their various outlets for a few months. But at the same time,

30
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:46,960
and Linus in particular is a very, very, very busy individual and probably doesn't have a lot

31
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:56,000
of spare time to muck about with things. And he's coming at this with a real YouTuber lens

32
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:03,200
look on the Linux scene. And I'm a bit nervous by that. I'm also nervous by the fact that Linus,

33
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:06,320
and I think Luke, have never daily driven Linux.

34
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:11,200
Confession for me to make here. I have never daily driven Linux.

35
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:20,160
Not once. I think in a lot of ways, it's going to be probably not as bad as you expect,

36
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:26,800
to be completely honest. I'm not expecting it to be bad. I'm expecting it to have unnecessary

37
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:30,400
bulls**t that you shouldn't have to deal with. One of the best ways...

38
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,800
And to be clear, Windows has lots of that. Just want to say.

39
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:38,000
Yes. So maybe it's good. Maybe they have the right expectations. But Wimpy, I know you were

40
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,280
biting your tongue before we started. I'm curious to know what your thoughts are,

41
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:44,880
if this is a good thing, if this is going in the right direction, you know, that kind of stuff.

42
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:51,840
Yeah, well, it reminds me a little bit of when you did the Arch Challenge all those years ago,

43
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:59,840
right? You know, it's similar but different. But my concern is with Luke and Linus,

44
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:07,360
doing it is everyone is going to come out of the woodwork and offer their advice and their

45
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:15,520
take on it. And I feel like they are just going to get drowned in bias misinformation.

46
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:25,440
And I feel like what they should do is they should each find like a mentor to guide them

47
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:31,920
through this. So they should have like their trusted mentor each, somebody who's experienced

48
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:37,120
with Linux. I know Anthony who's on their writing staff is very experienced, but maybe they each

49
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:43,760
need a mentor in order to sort of minimize the frustrations and help climb the learning curve.

50
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:50,960
Yeah. Yeah. In fact, to your point specifically, when they were talking about this, they were

51
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:56,720
taking distro suggestions from their live chat and Gentoo was on their list. But when Fedora

52
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:01,840
came up, they mocked it. No, we're not running Fedora. Like, come on, guys, put real,

53
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:07,760
real serious suggestions. You should get extra points or something if you run Fedora and wear

54
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:15,360
a Fedora for the whole duration. Oh, good lord. And you know, that's just the YouTube lens,

55
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:21,280
right? Where Gentoo, Arch and Manjaro are all perfectly very valid and all on the list of

56
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:26,240
contenders. Yeah, they've all got cool, cool value when you don't know what you're doing,

57
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:34,240
haven't they? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. What do you think, Poppy? I was going to say similar to Martin about

58
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:41,920
the fact that this will it's like birds stamping on the ground and all the worms come up, right? I

59
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:46,560
think there's certainly going to be a lot of people coming out. I wouldn't say what Martin

60
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:51,200
did that people will come out with misinformation. I think they'll just come out with opinions.

61
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:55,680
And there's a thousand different opinions in different directions. You know, you should do

62
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:59,760
this. You should try this distro. You should configure it this way or that way. There'll be

63
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:06,800
a lot of that people spouting their opinions for sure. I think this is good for everyone. I don't

64
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:13,920
think anyone comes out of this bad, because their channel gets a whole load of eyeballs that they

65
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:19,200
wouldn't have. There's a whole bunch of Linux people who are interested. There's Windows people

66
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:23,360
who might be interested in this from the Oh, I've heard about that. But I don't know what it's going

67
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:29,520
to be like. I'll let them dog food it for me. And we'll find out if you know if it's any good. And

68
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,360
what if it's not right? Why would it not be? It would it would not be a good thing. I mean,

69
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:41,280
it would it would not be any good if certain things didn't work. But those are facts. Those things

70
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:46,800
don't work because Linus tried them. They don't work because they don't work. And if that's the

71
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:53,360
case, then maybe that will protect some of their Windows running audience from using Linux and

72
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:58,240
then finding out themselves that it doesn't work and getting frustrated. But actually, this will

73
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:05,920
shield those people. I see it sets expectations, essentially. Right. I kind of like I kind of like

74
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:10,400
that perspective. So with regards to the misinformation, I didn't mean that people

75
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:16,480
would deliberately misinform them. I just think there's a lot of enthusiastic people out there

76
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:24,880
who are not well informed. Yeah. Yeah. We'll share poor quality information. And yes, you know, there

77
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:28,640
are hard facts that some things don't work as well. Like in one of those clips, it was like,

78
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:36,400
this may be the last time I do a live stream using Windows. Well, you know, live streaming from OBS

79
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:44,800
isn't the simple process on Linux as it is on Windows, because there's a whole bunch of stuff

80
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:48,960
that you can just take for granted on Windows that is not the case on Linux that you have to

81
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:54,960
go through some extra hoops to get going. So, you know, that could be a point of pain. Right. Like,

82
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:59,440
who knows how he's bringing in his DSLR right now? He could be using the USB interface or something.

83
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:05,120
He could be using a, you know, black magic deck link or something, and then he's going to have

84
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:10,640
he's going to be in a real bad place. Yeah. Yeah, I think it I think I agree a lot with your points.

85
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:16,400
And I think there's the other element of this. I think mostly it's a positive, but I think there's

86
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:23,280
going to be people watching this that expect them to permanently switch to Linux and expect, you know,

87
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:27,680
the channel to become more Linux focused. And I think it is actually a really positive trend to

88
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:32,560
see them talking about Linux more. And the fact that this challenge is even happening means that

89
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:38,160
they think it will drive audience. That's also very telling. But I think we should keep it in

90
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:43,280
perspective. They do have an end goal in mind and they've and Linus has been very clear about where

91
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:49,120
this is going. I think it's going to ultimately be a video series. So part one, I think, has to be

92
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:58,160
like, like kind of like day one, you know, like your challenges deciding which one to get, getting

93
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:02,800
the initial setup done. I think this is something we absolutely have to both kind of submit our

94
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:11,520
experiences for and both talk about. And then past that, I think there's got to be kind of like an

95
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:17,280
update. All right, it's been two weeks and I haven't played this game that I really love in

96
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:22,720
two weeks and I'm getting the twitches, you know, like that kind of thing. And then we have to have

97
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:28,560
a conclusion where we kind of go, okay, I've settled in now. I've figured out a lot of my

98
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:32,960
workarounds. Here's where I'm at. I talked about it with James. I think he thinks it should be just

99
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:37,680
two pieces of content, but we'll see. But the point is one of the things that will be included

100
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:44,640
in the first one is a lot of hemming and hawing about which distro to use. So here's what I've

101
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:50,240
got in my list so far. And it's not comprehensive. You guys are going to help me flesh it out here.

102
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:59,040
I've got Pop, Mint, Arch, by the way, Ubuntu and Manjaro. He later adds Gentoo after the chat

103
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:02,880
room convinces him. But, you know, that's where they're going, right? That's where they're going.

104
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:08,080
They're going for a three act kind of story about trying Linux out for a bit.

105
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:12,080
And they made a decision about which distro is that is that what's going to come out in the

106
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:16,240
first episode? I'm not sure. I don't know exactly what their plans are. If you go by the poll,

107
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:22,080
it looks like Ubuntu, which I think is spelled with an O, is winning right now. However,

108
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:27,440
my bet would be they go with Pop just because I think like Wimpy said, Anthony is going to kind

109
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:32,880
of guide Linus here and Linus is going to just go with whatever Anthony says to use. I would suspect.

110
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:38,000
I think that's probably the best choice either. I think one of them should go with a distro

111
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,520
and the other one should go with a different distro. I think they should contrast their

112
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:48,480
experiences. And I think one should be Pop and one should be Manjaro personally. That's

113
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:52,640
my personal opinion is what they should use. He says, hoping the Manjaro box breaks.

114
00:10:52,640 --> 00:11:01,520
No, actually, I want this to be real world. Because look, if you go online and ask people

115
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:06,640
what I want to do gaming, what distro should I use? You will get those two answers. You'll

116
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:13,360
get some people who say Ubuntu. And then you'll get some people who are fervent Manjaro because

117
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:18,240
it's the easy arch and Pop because it's the better Ubuntu, right? You get those people.

118
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:24,800
And those those people have very loud voices. And so I think it's a good way

119
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:31,200
for Linus and Liam to show those things off because that's what everyone tells you to run.

120
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:35,360
So run them and see what they're like. I think not only do they have loud voices,

121
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:40,560
but the message that they're essentially conveying is it's the easier option. And

122
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:45,040
if you're brand new to this and you know you want to play video games, right? Hearing that it's the

123
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:49,200
easier option to play video games on Linux. It's the message you want to hear. And I think that's

124
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:53,920
why that plays a role, too. So, yeah, I could totally see that going when I think they should

125
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:58,720
do different distros. And then if it doesn't work out for him, here's where I think that's where our

126
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:03,680
role is because we're just going to watch it. Right. But how is it going to fail? What you

127
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:09,280
tell me in what is a failure mode for this? Like success is they've got loads of content

128
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:13,680
that's given. Right. Right. What's what is a what is any kind of failure of this?

129
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:18,320
Well, it's going to be for the Linux audience when they go back to Windows or when the distro

130
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:21,760
doesn't work out like when he's talking about perhaps video capture doesn't work. So I have

131
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:26,000
to switch back to Windows to do a live stream like that, I think would be considered a failure

132
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:31,760
by the community. But this is a three. If he's like a two or three episode thing, then I think

133
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:36,320
I think we should all have in the back of my mind that he's going to go back to Windows anyway,

134
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:44,240
unless yeah, unless somehow magically the timing of Battlite and EAC lines up and the planets align

135
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:48,080
and they get and they get the right GPU drivers and the right CPU and everything works.

136
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:54,960
They're going to switch back to Windows. That's a lot of stars aligning. What I would consider a win,

137
00:12:54,960 --> 00:13:01,280
what I would personally consider a win for Linux users would be if if Linus or Luke's home computer

138
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:06,400
remained Linux. I don't expect their work desktop and their laptop, whatever. But if their home

139
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:11,040
gaming PC remained Linux, I think that'd be a phenomenal outcome.

140
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:15,440
So I don't think that that will not happen. No, absolutely not.

141
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:22,560
So I think that is hopes and dreams and pixie dust. Yeah. The reason the reason for them doing

142
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:28,560
this is because they want to try out Linux gaming now before the Steam Deck becomes widely available

143
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:35,120
to sort of assess where things are. Yeah. And we need to remember that if you've watched many of

144
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:41,360
their videos, Windows is entrenched in their business workflow. There is no way they're going

145
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:46,640
to be moving away from Windows for any, you know, prolonged period of time. That's just it.

146
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:51,920
Heck, they use Windows for their file server. No, they don't. They use Unraid.

147
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:56,800
They have a Windows storage spaces server, too. And they run it for their VM.

148
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:05,920
But what what looks like success to me is if they are successful running the games that they love

149
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:14,080
on Linux and their experience is the same as or better than what they've had on Windows.

150
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:18,320
I think that's what success looks like. Just the gaming angle.

151
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:23,040
Yep. So for me, what success looks like if they pull it off is

152
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:29,600
is honestly that they don't totally hate the experience. Right. I actually kind of expect that

153
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:38,080
a good chunk of the games that they play will work. The question is, are they going to like the

154
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:45,760
process in playing them? Are they going to like, you know, how, you know, the experience as a whole?

155
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:50,080
Like, that's the one I'm more concerned about. I am because I am. I don't think they'll stay.

156
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:54,560
I am thinking it's going to it's going to be it's going to be a mixed bag. But one thing that I

157
00:14:54,560 --> 00:15:00,320
thought was pretty positive is Luke said he kind of he kind of expects it to be something similar

158
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:08,880
or analogous to iOS and Android, where you can get the same apps on both platforms, but the iOS

159
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:13,920
version is almost always better in some way. He expects it to be like that with Windows and Linux,

160
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:18,640
like you can get the game or the same app in Windows and you can get the same one in Linux.

161
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:22,880
But the Linux experience might be a little more Android. And, you know, maybe something's a little

162
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:27,120
different or you've got to go manually update it versus maybe something that's automatically

163
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:32,880
updated on Windows. And I think that's not always true because slack is slack for the most part in

164
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:36,720
that kind of stuff. Electron apps are just electron apps. But it is applicable maybe to

165
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:41,440
Proton games in some aspects of Linux. And I saw that sort of setting expectations, I think,

166
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:46,400
at the right level. And that, in my opinion, is probably the most key thing to making a transition

167
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:52,000
like this successful is setting those expectations right. I don't know if you guys caught it, but

168
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:59,040
the whole Fedora thing ended up on Twitter and Linus did respond to that thread with Matthew

169
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:04,640
Miller in it. It was pretty much an old conception. He hasn't researched that whatsoever. So he's

170
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:09,920
going to look into it more. That's the ray of hope is these guys do have industry experience.

171
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:17,520
They they know like how the Internet works. They grok that like a more niche distro has more niche

172
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:21,840
support like they are. They get those fundamentals because they're intelligent individuals who've

173
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:26,880
been using tech for a long time. So there is to that advantage. And part of why I find it

174
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:33,280
fascinating is because I feel like that's exactly the kind of user I think Linux has the best shot

175
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:38,240
with is somebody who knows what a driver is, somebody who understands that vendors release

176
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:42,480
driver, you know, like that whole the whole just basics of how that stuff works. PC enthusiasts.

177
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:46,960
Yes. You know, they've been building their own PCs for years, right? They know how PCs work,

178
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:51,840
which is that the and they do more weird hacks on Windows than you could ever hope to believe.

179
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:57,920
And they acknowledge Windows isn't perfect, too. I think I think I've got what the worst outcome

180
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:05,680
for this would be. I think given that this is a prelude to the Gabe gear coming out and this is

181
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:12,960
all like leading up to Linux on the Gabe gear, then what what would be the worst outcome is if

182
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:21,120
the guys have a terrible experience and they advocate and demonstrate when the new when the

183
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:26,560
steam deck comes out, put Windows on it. They tell you to just wipe it and put Windows. That's

184
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:33,760
the worst case scenario. Right now, the the steam deck is going to go out the door with Linux on it.

185
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:38,080
And if it's a great experience, then people will just keep it and they'll just use it like that.

186
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:43,360
But if they get signals from people before it comes out that it's going to be shocking,

187
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,160
then they may well switch and just go and find a copy of Windows from somewhere and put it on.

188
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:54,960
The other thing that Linus said was that they made it clear that like Anthony is kind of like

189
00:17:54,960 --> 00:18:00,560
their in-house Linux guy from what we can see. They are not going to be falling back on that.

190
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:04,800
They want to get the legitimate end user perspective of just being thrown into this,

191
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:08,560
have no handholding whatsoever. So it's going to be on them to do all the work.

192
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,200
I don't think that's a good idea.

193
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:17,840
They mentioned that to Matthew on Twitter and I was like, oh, my gosh, we got to we got to do stuff.

194
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:21,760
I really hope I let Anthony guide that a little bit.

195
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:24,480
Oh, I know. It's what normal people do. I'm saying that we're not ready.

196
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:29,520
And also, they're not normal. Like Linus is running a media empire. He's an extremely

197
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:34,560
busy person. And so he could probably use a little bit of support in that regard.

198
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:37,360
Well, yes and no, because this is his home PC, his gaming PC.

199
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:41,680
True. He's changing his home PC that he does the WAN show on.

200
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:46,000
Like he said in there that the WAN show will probably like going forward,

201
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:51,120
you know, as he is doing this experiment, will be streamed from Linux. That is a big deal.

202
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:52,320
Oh, interesting.

203
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:57,440
Because it's his home PC. That's what he does the WAN show on.

204
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:05,200
Yep. Well, my point was that he's a busy guy and at work. He may be busy and his own time

205
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:12,720
when he's playing games. That's like very clearly the definition of not busy because he's playing

206
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,800
games. Yeah, he's doing the not work part.

207
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:16,160
Right.

208
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:18,560
I think the whole thing is just going to be fun to watch. And I

209
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:23,520
don't see there being really any any major negatives. I think it's going to be fun.

210
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:27,840
We can express our opinions of what they're doing right and wrong,

211
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:32,480
and that will get thrown into the mix with all the other million Linux users throwing their

212
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:35,520
two pence into what he's doing wrong.

213
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,840
That's one of my concerns. It's going to be the peanut

214
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:41,280
gallery of peanut galleries, and they're going to get subjected to that.

215
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:47,440
Right. Just like game devs, like when they blog about, you know, here's a retrospective of why,

216
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:51,760
you know, what went wrong on Linux, and then people dive in and dogpile them.

217
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:57,680
Oh, you use the wrong audio library or you should have targeted all that shit.

218
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:59,760
They're going to get that times ten.

219
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:02,960
But they know how the Internet works, though. You know, they do. Yeah.

220
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:06,960
Yeah, they didn't know how the Internet works by this point. I'd be impressed.

221
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:09,760
It is going to be fascinating to watch because of all these reasons,

222
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:14,320
regardless of where it ends up. I say keep expectations low, but popcorn.

223
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:19,600
I'm just hopeful at the end of this, no matter what happens,

224
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:24,240
I'd just be really excited to see if they come out with a slightly positive outcome.

225
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,200
I just want them to not have a negative one.

226
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:30,320
That's baseline.

227
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,400
I've thought of another negative way this could fail.

228
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:42,720
What if it goes so badly that it convinces people not to buy the Steam Deck, to cancel?

229
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:47,440
They're all reservations. Then nobody's actually bought one.

230
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:50,160
They're going to be getting a call from Gabe.

231
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:50,660
Yeah.

232
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:56,000
Well, I don't know, because they're not talking about the Steam Deck here, are they?

233
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:01,520
They're talking about their own homegrown Linux experiences, which is not a curated device.

234
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:04,240
But it will influence everything.

235
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:06,720
I guess here's an example of how it could go wrong.

236
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:07,520
Here's an example.

237
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:11,200
Perhaps somehow they're convinced, for better, maybe it'd be good,

238
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:15,440
but they're convinced use Plasma because Plasma is what's going to be on the Deck.

239
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:18,960
They use Plasma, and maybe they develop some sort of problem.

240
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:21,600
They don't like it, for something goes wrong, or they don't like it.

241
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:26,240
And so then, when they're talking about the Deck in the future, they might throw in that,

242
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:27,360
yeah, but it uses Plasma.

243
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:30,800
You could see something like that, perhaps, developing.

244
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:33,060
Yeah.

245
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:35,760
If their end goal was about the Deck,

246
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:38,640
do you think one of them would be trying some kind of Arch-based distro,

247
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,480
whether it's Arch itself or Endeavor?

248
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:46,400
Oh, absolutely. Yeah, so I believe Endeavor is on the list of things, on the selection pile.

249
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,800
Yeah. Well, it was what Anthony suggested.

250
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:51,360
Yeah, Anthony and Endeavor.

251
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:55,360
We don't know what the final list of distros that they're going to select from is going to be yet,

252
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:58,160
because apparently they're just going to start over and do research

253
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,600
because of what happened over the weekend.

254
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:02,560
So, we'll see.

255
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:06,320
Way to go, Linux users. We're off to a good start.

256
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:12,400
To be fair, it was actually largely consistent commentary from almost all of the avenues,

257
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:15,280
YouTube, Float Plane, forums, everywhere.

258
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:17,600
It was like, why are you dismissing Fedora?

259
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:22,800
I told Neil, I messaged him, I was like, I've never seen r slash Linux

260
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:28,240
ever be in a holdup state consisting across the entire South.

261
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:30,080
You know, yeah, everybody was like,

262
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:34,160
I have never seen so much backhanded positivity towards Fedora before.

263
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:39,680
That's really, it's impressive, Neil, because especially after that tragedy where

264
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:43,520
every single Fedora user lost all their data because Fedora uses ButterFS.

265
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:48,240
So, I mean, I'm impressed it still has goodwill after all that data loss that happened.

266
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:51,600
Right. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

267
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:55,920
So, in Popey's first example of how it could go wrong,

268
00:22:55,920 --> 00:23:01,520
he said that they recommend installing Windows on the Steam Deck.

269
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:06,240
I think we can just take that as a given because as Linux nerds,

270
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:10,720
we buy devices with Windows and Mac OS on it,

271
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:13,840
and we're not happy until we've got it running Linux.

272
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:17,760
And it's very rare for a Windows centric group of nerds

273
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:21,680
to get a device that's running something other than Windows

274
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:25,920
and have the hack challenge of installing Windows on it.

275
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:29,280
So, I think we can say absolutely positively,

276
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:32,000
they are going to install Windows on the Steam Deck.

277
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:32,960
We should brace ourselves.

278
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:35,120
There was those challenges to get, what was it,

279
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:39,360
Windows 95 running on an iPhone like seven years ago and things like that?

280
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:42,800
It's a fair point, and we shouldn't necessarily take it as even a negative thing.

281
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:45,920
It's just natural for a Windows user to want to do that.

282
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,520
Just brace yourself, it's going to happen.

283
00:23:47,520 --> 00:24:01,360
Don't freak out, it's okay.
