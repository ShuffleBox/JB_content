Hey there, this is Cut from our Linux Unplugged pre-show from episode 426.

00:05.040 --> 00:09.760
If you'd like to get content like this every week, become a member at unpluggedcore.com.

00:12.400 --> 00:16.720
Here's what I figured we'd do. I figured we'd have a little fun right now and we'd talk about

00:16.720 --> 00:20.080
what's going on, because I don't know if I want this in the main show or not, I haven't decided

00:20.080 --> 00:27.920
yet. And I'm not sure if everybody is current on what's going on, but Linus Sebastian and his

00:27.920 --> 00:33.040
cohort, what's Luke's last name? I can't remember Luke's last name, but they announced on their

00:33.040 --> 00:38.400
WAN podcast, their WAN show podcast, that they want to do a challenge of running desktop Linux

00:38.400 --> 00:44.800
for an extended period of time. And this came about after talking about the anti-cheat support

00:44.800 --> 00:50.240
that's landed for Linux. Linus asked Luke if he's up for a challenge and I got a clip of that.

00:50.800 --> 00:52.320
Do you want to do a challenge with me?

00:53.120 --> 00:54.080
Oh, okay.

00:54.080 --> 01:01.600
Yes. We each borrow an SSD from the office and we both try to install Linux on our daily driver

01:01.600 --> 01:08.720
gaming PCs. At the same time, we see who lasts longer. So there's clearly a focus on gaming

01:08.720 --> 01:14.400
from the very beginning. That's where they're going with this. And there's going to be a

01:15.760 --> 01:21.440
punishment for whoever blinks first. And I thought, okay, maybe this is a passing thing.

01:21.440 --> 01:25.520
But then they doubled down and confirmed it in the following WAN show the next week that

01:25.520 --> 01:32.720
the challenge is in fact real. So the challenge is real. The challenge is happening. Luke and I

01:32.720 --> 01:39.760
are going to be switching to Linux on our daily driver machines. This may in fact be the last WAN

01:39.760 --> 01:47.360
show that I broadcast on a Windows machine for quite some time. And we haven't figured out exactly

01:47.360 --> 01:54.320
what the punishment for blinking first is going to be. But whoever goes back to Windows first

01:54.320 --> 02:01.120
is going to have to do something. I saw one really good suggestion. Dying your hair in four

02:01.120 --> 02:09.440
quadrants, the Windows colors, might be a kind of fun one. It's not permanent. You're not maimed or

02:09.440 --> 02:13.600
anything, but it's certainly... Or you'd have to run it the whole way out.

02:13.600 --> 02:14.880
Not the best. Yeah.

02:14.880 --> 02:18.720
You can't shave your head. It would have to be reasonable haircuts and stuff like that.

02:18.720 --> 02:22.080
Yeah. Yeah. You're not allowed to re-dye it. That would be ridiculous.

02:22.080 --> 02:27.920
So I'm mixed on this. I think in part it's great. And it's going to be potentially fun

02:27.920 --> 02:33.680
for their audience to watch this proceed. And it probably means Linux is going to get a lot

02:33.680 --> 02:39.360
of coverage on their various outlets for a few months. But at the same time,

02:39.360 --> 02:46.960
and Linus in particular is a very, very, very busy individual and probably doesn't have a lot

02:46.960 --> 02:56.000
of spare time to muck about with things. And he's coming at this with a real YouTuber lens

02:56.000 --> 03:03.200
look on the Linux scene. And I'm a bit nervous by that. I'm also nervous by the fact that Linus,

03:03.200 --> 03:06.320
and I think Luke, have never daily driven Linux.

03:06.320 --> 03:11.200
Confession for me to make here. I have never daily driven Linux.

03:13.440 --> 03:20.160
Not once. I think in a lot of ways, it's going to be probably not as bad as you expect,

03:20.160 --> 03:26.800
to be completely honest. I'm not expecting it to be bad. I'm expecting it to have unnecessary

03:26.800 --> 03:30.400
bulls**t that you shouldn't have to deal with. One of the best ways...

03:30.400 --> 03:32.800
And to be clear, Windows has lots of that. Just want to say.

03:32.800 --> 03:38.000
Yes. So maybe it's good. Maybe they have the right expectations. But Wimpy, I know you were

03:38.000 --> 03:41.280
biting your tongue before we started. I'm curious to know what your thoughts are,

03:41.280 --> 03:44.880
if this is a good thing, if this is going in the right direction, you know, that kind of stuff.

03:46.240 --> 03:51.840
Yeah, well, it reminds me a little bit of when you did the Arch Challenge all those years ago,

03:51.840 --> 03:59.840
right? You know, it's similar but different. But my concern is with Luke and Linus,

03:59.840 --> 04:07.360
doing it is everyone is going to come out of the woodwork and offer their advice and their

04:07.360 --> 04:15.520
take on it. And I feel like they are just going to get drowned in bias misinformation.

04:17.120 --> 04:25.440
And I feel like what they should do is they should each find like a mentor to guide them

04:25.440 --> 04:31.920
through this. So they should have like their trusted mentor each, somebody who's experienced

04:31.920 --> 04:37.120
with Linux. I know Anthony who's on their writing staff is very experienced, but maybe they each

04:37.120 --> 04:43.760
need a mentor in order to sort of minimize the frustrations and help climb the learning curve.

04:43.760 --> 04:50.960
Yeah. Yeah. In fact, to your point specifically, when they were talking about this, they were

04:50.960 --> 04:56.720
taking distro suggestions from their live chat and Gentoo was on their list. But when Fedora

04:56.720 --> 05:01.840
came up, they mocked it. No, we're not running Fedora. Like, come on, guys, put real,

05:02.640 --> 05:07.760
real serious suggestions. You should get extra points or something if you run Fedora and wear

05:07.760 --> 05:15.360
a Fedora for the whole duration. Oh, good lord. And you know, that's just the YouTube lens,

05:15.360 --> 05:21.280
right? Where Gentoo, Arch and Manjaro are all perfectly very valid and all on the list of

05:21.280 --> 05:26.240
contenders. Yeah, they've all got cool, cool value when you don't know what you're doing,

05:26.240 --> 05:34.240
haven't they? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. What do you think, Poppy? I was going to say similar to Martin about

05:34.880 --> 05:41.920
the fact that this will it's like birds stamping on the ground and all the worms come up, right? I

05:41.920 --> 05:46.560
think there's certainly going to be a lot of people coming out. I wouldn't say what Martin

05:46.560 --> 05:51.200
did that people will come out with misinformation. I think they'll just come out with opinions.

05:51.200 --> 05:55.680
And there's a thousand different opinions in different directions. You know, you should do

05:55.680 --> 05:59.760
this. You should try this distro. You should configure it this way or that way. There'll be

05:59.760 --> 06:06.800
a lot of that people spouting their opinions for sure. I think this is good for everyone. I don't

06:06.800 --> 06:13.920
think anyone comes out of this bad, because their channel gets a whole load of eyeballs that they

06:13.920 --> 06:19.200
wouldn't have. There's a whole bunch of Linux people who are interested. There's Windows people

06:19.200 --> 06:23.360
who might be interested in this from the Oh, I've heard about that. But I don't know what it's going

06:23.360 --> 06:29.520
to be like. I'll let them dog food it for me. And we'll find out if you know if it's any good. And

06:30.000 --> 06:35.360
what if it's not right? Why would it not be? It would it would not be a good thing. I mean,

06:35.360 --> 06:41.280
it would it would not be any good if certain things didn't work. But those are facts. Those things

06:41.280 --> 06:46.800
don't work because Linus tried them. They don't work because they don't work. And if that's the

06:46.800 --> 06:53.360
case, then maybe that will protect some of their Windows running audience from using Linux and

06:53.360 --> 06:58.240
then finding out themselves that it doesn't work and getting frustrated. But actually, this will

06:58.240 --> 07:05.920
shield those people. I see it sets expectations, essentially. Right. I kind of like I kind of like

07:05.920 --> 07:10.400
that perspective. So with regards to the misinformation, I didn't mean that people

07:10.400 --> 07:16.480
would deliberately misinform them. I just think there's a lot of enthusiastic people out there

07:16.480 --> 07:24.880
who are not well informed. Yeah. Yeah. We'll share poor quality information. And yes, you know, there

07:24.880 --> 07:28.640
are hard facts that some things don't work as well. Like in one of those clips, it was like,

07:29.280 --> 07:36.400
this may be the last time I do a live stream using Windows. Well, you know, live streaming from OBS

07:37.680 --> 07:44.800
isn't the simple process on Linux as it is on Windows, because there's a whole bunch of stuff

07:44.800 --> 07:48.960
that you can just take for granted on Windows that is not the case on Linux that you have to

07:48.960 --> 07:54.960
go through some extra hoops to get going. So, you know, that could be a point of pain. Right. Like,

07:54.960 --> 07:59.440
who knows how he's bringing in his DSLR right now? He could be using the USB interface or something.

07:59.440 --> 08:05.120
He could be using a, you know, black magic deck link or something, and then he's going to have

08:05.120 --> 08:10.640
he's going to be in a real bad place. Yeah. Yeah, I think it I think I agree a lot with your points.

08:11.920 --> 08:16.400
And I think there's the other element of this. I think mostly it's a positive, but I think there's

08:16.400 --> 08:23.280
going to be people watching this that expect them to permanently switch to Linux and expect, you know,

08:23.280 --> 08:27.680
the channel to become more Linux focused. And I think it is actually a really positive trend to

08:27.680 --> 08:32.560
see them talking about Linux more. And the fact that this challenge is even happening means that

08:32.560 --> 08:38.160
they think it will drive audience. That's also very telling. But I think we should keep it in

08:38.160 --> 08:43.280
perspective. They do have an end goal in mind and they've and Linus has been very clear about where

08:43.280 --> 08:49.120
this is going. I think it's going to ultimately be a video series. So part one, I think, has to be

08:49.120 --> 08:58.160
like, like kind of like day one, you know, like your challenges deciding which one to get, getting

08:58.160 --> 09:02.800
the initial setup done. I think this is something we absolutely have to both kind of submit our

09:02.800 --> 09:11.520
experiences for and both talk about. And then past that, I think there's got to be kind of like an

09:11.520 --> 09:17.280
update. All right, it's been two weeks and I haven't played this game that I really love in

09:17.280 --> 09:22.720
two weeks and I'm getting the twitches, you know, like that kind of thing. And then we have to have

09:22.720 --> 09:28.560
a conclusion where we kind of go, okay, I've settled in now. I've figured out a lot of my

09:28.560 --> 09:32.960
workarounds. Here's where I'm at. I talked about it with James. I think he thinks it should be just

09:32.960 --> 09:37.680
two pieces of content, but we'll see. But the point is one of the things that will be included

09:37.680 --> 09:44.640
in the first one is a lot of hemming and hawing about which distro to use. So here's what I've

09:44.640 --> 09:50.240
got in my list so far. And it's not comprehensive. You guys are going to help me flesh it out here.

09:50.880 --> 09:59.040
I've got Pop, Mint, Arch, by the way, Ubuntu and Manjaro. He later adds Gentoo after the chat

09:59.040 --> 10:02.880
room convinces him. But, you know, that's where they're going, right? That's where they're going.

10:02.880 --> 10:08.080
They're going for a three act kind of story about trying Linux out for a bit.

10:08.080 --> 10:12.080
And they made a decision about which distro is that is that what's going to come out in the

10:12.080 --> 10:16.240
first episode? I'm not sure. I don't know exactly what their plans are. If you go by the poll,

10:16.240 --> 10:22.080
it looks like Ubuntu, which I think is spelled with an O, is winning right now. However,

10:22.080 --> 10:27.440
my bet would be they go with Pop just because I think like Wimpy said, Anthony is going to kind

10:27.440 --> 10:32.880
of guide Linus here and Linus is going to just go with whatever Anthony says to use. I would suspect.

10:32.880 --> 10:38.000
I think that's probably the best choice either. I think one of them should go with a distro

10:38.000 --> 10:41.520
and the other one should go with a different distro. I think they should contrast their

10:41.520 --> 10:48.480
experiences. And I think one should be Pop and one should be Manjaro personally. That's

10:48.480 --> 10:52.640
my personal opinion is what they should use. He says, hoping the Manjaro box breaks.

10:52.640 --> 11:01.520
No, actually, I want this to be real world. Because look, if you go online and ask people

11:01.520 --> 11:06.640
what I want to do gaming, what distro should I use? You will get those two answers. You'll

11:06.640 --> 11:13.360
get some people who say Ubuntu. And then you'll get some people who are fervent Manjaro because

11:13.360 --> 11:18.240
it's the easy arch and Pop because it's the better Ubuntu, right? You get those people.

11:18.240 --> 11:24.800
And those those people have very loud voices. And so I think it's a good way

11:24.800 --> 11:31.200
for Linus and Liam to show those things off because that's what everyone tells you to run.

11:31.760 --> 11:35.360
So run them and see what they're like. I think not only do they have loud voices,

11:35.360 --> 11:40.560
but the message that they're essentially conveying is it's the easier option. And

11:40.560 --> 11:45.040
if you're brand new to this and you know you want to play video games, right? Hearing that it's the

11:45.040 --> 11:49.200
easier option to play video games on Linux. It's the message you want to hear. And I think that's

11:49.200 --> 11:53.920
why that plays a role, too. So, yeah, I could totally see that going when I think they should

11:53.920 --> 11:58.720
do different distros. And then if it doesn't work out for him, here's where I think that's where our

11:58.720 --> 12:03.680
role is because we're just going to watch it. Right. But how is it going to fail? What you

12:03.680 --> 12:09.280
tell me in what is a failure mode for this? Like success is they've got loads of content

12:09.280 --> 12:13.680
that's given. Right. Right. What's what is a what is any kind of failure of this?

12:13.680 --> 12:18.320
Well, it's going to be for the Linux audience when they go back to Windows or when the distro

12:18.320 --> 12:21.760
doesn't work out like when he's talking about perhaps video capture doesn't work. So I have

12:21.760 --> 12:26.000
to switch back to Windows to do a live stream like that, I think would be considered a failure

12:26.000 --> 12:31.760
by the community. But this is a three. If he's like a two or three episode thing, then I think

12:31.760 --> 12:36.320
I think we should all have in the back of my mind that he's going to go back to Windows anyway,

12:36.320 --> 12:44.240
unless yeah, unless somehow magically the timing of Battlite and EAC lines up and the planets align

12:44.240 --> 12:48.080
and they get and they get the right GPU drivers and the right CPU and everything works.

12:48.880 --> 12:54.960
They're going to switch back to Windows. That's a lot of stars aligning. What I would consider a win,

12:54.960 --> 13:01.280
what I would personally consider a win for Linux users would be if if Linus or Luke's home computer

13:01.280 --> 13:06.400
remained Linux. I don't expect their work desktop and their laptop, whatever. But if their home

13:06.400 --> 13:11.040
gaming PC remained Linux, I think that'd be a phenomenal outcome.

13:11.600 --> 13:15.440
So I don't think that that will not happen. No, absolutely not.

13:16.720 --> 13:22.560
So I think that is hopes and dreams and pixie dust. Yeah. The reason the reason for them doing

13:22.560 --> 13:28.560
this is because they want to try out Linux gaming now before the Steam Deck becomes widely available

13:28.560 --> 13:35.120
to sort of assess where things are. Yeah. And we need to remember that if you've watched many of

13:35.120 --> 13:41.360
their videos, Windows is entrenched in their business workflow. There is no way they're going

13:41.360 --> 13:46.640
to be moving away from Windows for any, you know, prolonged period of time. That's just it.

13:47.600 --> 13:51.920
Heck, they use Windows for their file server. No, they don't. They use Unraid.

13:53.040 --> 13:56.800
They have a Windows storage spaces server, too. And they run it for their VM.

13:56.800 --> 14:05.920
But what what looks like success to me is if they are successful running the games that they love

14:05.920 --> 14:14.080
on Linux and their experience is the same as or better than what they've had on Windows.

14:14.080 --> 14:18.320
I think that's what success looks like. Just the gaming angle.

14:18.320 --> 14:23.040
Yep. So for me, what success looks like if they pull it off is

14:23.040 --> 14:29.600
is honestly that they don't totally hate the experience. Right. I actually kind of expect that

14:30.560 --> 14:38.080
a good chunk of the games that they play will work. The question is, are they going to like the

14:39.440 --> 14:45.760
process in playing them? Are they going to like, you know, how, you know, the experience as a whole?

14:45.760 --> 14:50.080
Like, that's the one I'm more concerned about. I am because I am. I don't think they'll stay.

14:50.080 --> 14:54.560
I am thinking it's going to it's going to be it's going to be a mixed bag. But one thing that I

14:54.560 --> 15:00.320
thought was pretty positive is Luke said he kind of he kind of expects it to be something similar

15:00.320 --> 15:08.880
or analogous to iOS and Android, where you can get the same apps on both platforms, but the iOS

15:08.880 --> 15:13.920
version is almost always better in some way. He expects it to be like that with Windows and Linux,

15:13.920 --> 15:18.640
like you can get the game or the same app in Windows and you can get the same one in Linux.

15:18.640 --> 15:22.880
But the Linux experience might be a little more Android. And, you know, maybe something's a little

15:22.880 --> 15:27.120
different or you've got to go manually update it versus maybe something that's automatically

15:27.120 --> 15:32.880
updated on Windows. And I think that's not always true because slack is slack for the most part in

15:32.880 --> 15:36.720
that kind of stuff. Electron apps are just electron apps. But it is applicable maybe to

15:36.720 --> 15:41.440
Proton games in some aspects of Linux. And I saw that sort of setting expectations, I think,

15:41.440 --> 15:46.400
at the right level. And that, in my opinion, is probably the most key thing to making a transition

15:46.400 --> 15:52.000
like this successful is setting those expectations right. I don't know if you guys caught it, but

15:52.000 --> 15:59.040
the whole Fedora thing ended up on Twitter and Linus did respond to that thread with Matthew

15:59.040 --> 16:04.640
Miller in it. It was pretty much an old conception. He hasn't researched that whatsoever. So he's

16:04.640 --> 16:09.920
going to look into it more. That's the ray of hope is these guys do have industry experience.

16:09.920 --> 16:17.520
They they know like how the Internet works. They grok that like a more niche distro has more niche

16:17.520 --> 16:21.840
support like they are. They get those fundamentals because they're intelligent individuals who've

16:21.840 --> 16:26.880
been using tech for a long time. So there is to that advantage. And part of why I find it

16:26.880 --> 16:33.280
fascinating is because I feel like that's exactly the kind of user I think Linux has the best shot

16:33.280 --> 16:38.240
with is somebody who knows what a driver is, somebody who understands that vendors release

16:38.240 --> 16:42.480
driver, you know, like that whole the whole just basics of how that stuff works. PC enthusiasts.

16:42.480 --> 16:46.960
Yes. You know, they've been building their own PCs for years, right? They know how PCs work,

16:46.960 --> 16:51.840
which is that the and they do more weird hacks on Windows than you could ever hope to believe.

16:51.840 --> 16:57.920
And they acknowledge Windows isn't perfect, too. I think I think I've got what the worst outcome

16:57.920 --> 17:05.680
for this would be. I think given that this is a prelude to the Gabe gear coming out and this is

17:05.680 --> 17:12.960
all like leading up to Linux on the Gabe gear, then what what would be the worst outcome is if

17:13.680 --> 17:21.120
the guys have a terrible experience and they advocate and demonstrate when the new when the

17:21.120 --> 17:26.560
steam deck comes out, put Windows on it. They tell you to just wipe it and put Windows. That's

17:26.560 --> 17:33.760
the worst case scenario. Right now, the the steam deck is going to go out the door with Linux on it.

17:33.760 --> 17:38.080
And if it's a great experience, then people will just keep it and they'll just use it like that.

17:38.080 --> 17:43.360
But if they get signals from people before it comes out that it's going to be shocking,

17:44.000 --> 17:48.160
then they may well switch and just go and find a copy of Windows from somewhere and put it on.

17:48.880 --> 17:54.960
The other thing that Linus said was that they made it clear that like Anthony is kind of like

17:54.960 --> 18:00.560
their in-house Linux guy from what we can see. They are not going to be falling back on that.

18:00.560 --> 18:04.800
They want to get the legitimate end user perspective of just being thrown into this,

18:04.800 --> 18:08.560
have no handholding whatsoever. So it's going to be on them to do all the work.

18:10.080 --> 18:11.200
I don't think that's a good idea.

18:12.240 --> 18:17.840
They mentioned that to Matthew on Twitter and I was like, oh, my gosh, we got to we got to do stuff.

18:17.840 --> 18:21.760
I really hope I let Anthony guide that a little bit.

18:21.760 --> 18:24.480
Oh, I know. It's what normal people do. I'm saying that we're not ready.

18:24.480 --> 18:29.520
And also, they're not normal. Like Linus is running a media empire. He's an extremely

18:29.520 --> 18:34.560
busy person. And so he could probably use a little bit of support in that regard.

18:34.560 --> 18:37.360
Well, yes and no, because this is his home PC, his gaming PC.

18:37.360 --> 18:41.680
True. He's changing his home PC that he does the WAN show on.

18:41.680 --> 18:46.000
Like he said in there that the WAN show will probably like going forward,

18:46.000 --> 18:51.120
you know, as he is doing this experiment, will be streamed from Linux. That is a big deal.

18:51.120 --> 18:52.320
Oh, interesting.

18:54.880 --> 18:57.440
Because it's his home PC. That's what he does the WAN show on.

18:57.440 --> 19:05.200
Yep. Well, my point was that he's a busy guy and at work. He may be busy and his own time

19:05.200 --> 19:12.720
when he's playing games. That's like very clearly the definition of not busy because he's playing

19:12.720 --> 19:14.800
games. Yeah, he's doing the not work part.

19:15.680 --> 19:16.160
Right.

19:16.160 --> 19:18.560
I think the whole thing is just going to be fun to watch. And I

19:19.120 --> 19:23.520
don't see there being really any any major negatives. I think it's going to be fun.

19:23.520 --> 19:27.840
We can express our opinions of what they're doing right and wrong,

19:27.840 --> 19:32.480
and that will get thrown into the mix with all the other million Linux users throwing their

19:32.480 --> 19:35.520
two pence into what he's doing wrong.

19:35.520 --> 19:37.840
That's one of my concerns. It's going to be the peanut

19:37.840 --> 19:41.280
gallery of peanut galleries, and they're going to get subjected to that.

19:41.920 --> 19:47.440
Right. Just like game devs, like when they blog about, you know, here's a retrospective of why,

19:47.440 --> 19:51.760
you know, what went wrong on Linux, and then people dive in and dogpile them.

19:51.760 --> 19:57.680
Oh, you use the wrong audio library or you should have targeted all that shit.

19:57.680 --> 19:59.760
They're going to get that times ten.

19:59.760 --> 20:02.960
But they know how the Internet works, though. You know, they do. Yeah.

20:03.680 --> 20:06.960
Yeah, they didn't know how the Internet works by this point. I'd be impressed.

20:06.960 --> 20:09.760
It is going to be fascinating to watch because of all these reasons,

20:09.760 --> 20:14.320
regardless of where it ends up. I say keep expectations low, but popcorn.

20:16.080 --> 20:19.600
I'm just hopeful at the end of this, no matter what happens,

20:19.600 --> 20:24.240
I'd just be really excited to see if they come out with a slightly positive outcome.

20:25.200 --> 20:27.200
I just want them to not have a negative one.

20:29.680 --> 20:30.320
That's baseline.

20:31.200 --> 20:34.400
I've thought of another negative way this could fail.

20:35.520 --> 20:42.720
What if it goes so badly that it convinces people not to buy the Steam Deck, to cancel?

20:44.240 --> 20:47.440
They're all reservations. Then nobody's actually bought one.

20:47.440 --> 20:50.160
They're going to be getting a call from Gabe.

20:50.160 --> 20:50.660
Yeah.

20:51.600 --> 20:56.000
Well, I don't know, because they're not talking about the Steam Deck here, are they?

20:56.000 --> 21:01.520
They're talking about their own homegrown Linux experiences, which is not a curated device.

21:01.520 --> 21:04.240
But it will influence everything.

21:04.240 --> 21:06.720
I guess here's an example of how it could go wrong.

21:06.720 --> 21:07.520
Here's an example.

21:08.080 --> 21:11.200
Perhaps somehow they're convinced, for better, maybe it'd be good,

21:11.200 --> 21:15.440
but they're convinced use Plasma because Plasma is what's going to be on the Deck.

21:15.440 --> 21:18.960
They use Plasma, and maybe they develop some sort of problem.

21:18.960 --> 21:21.600
They don't like it, for something goes wrong, or they don't like it.

21:21.600 --> 21:26.240
And so then, when they're talking about the Deck in the future, they might throw in that,

21:26.240 --> 21:27.360
yeah, but it uses Plasma.

21:28.640 --> 21:30.800
You could see something like that, perhaps, developing.

21:32.560 --> 21:33.060
Yeah.

21:33.920 --> 21:35.760
If their end goal was about the Deck,

21:35.760 --> 21:38.640
do you think one of them would be trying some kind of Arch-based distro,

21:38.640 --> 21:40.480
whether it's Arch itself or Endeavor?

21:40.480 --> 21:46.400
Oh, absolutely. Yeah, so I believe Endeavor is on the list of things, on the selection pile.

21:46.400 --> 21:48.800
Yeah. Well, it was what Anthony suggested.

21:48.800 --> 21:51.360
Yeah, Anthony and Endeavor.

21:51.360 --> 21:55.360
We don't know what the final list of distros that they're going to select from is going to be yet,

21:55.360 --> 21:58.160
because apparently they're just going to start over and do research

21:58.160 --> 21:59.600
because of what happened over the weekend.

22:01.040 --> 22:02.560
So, we'll see.

22:02.560 --> 22:06.320
Way to go, Linux users. We're off to a good start.

22:06.320 --> 22:12.400
To be fair, it was actually largely consistent commentary from almost all of the avenues,

22:12.400 --> 22:15.280
YouTube, Float Plane, forums, everywhere.

22:15.280 --> 22:17.600
It was like, why are you dismissing Fedora?

22:18.880 --> 22:22.800
I told Neil, I messaged him, I was like, I've never seen r slash Linux

22:23.360 --> 22:28.240
ever be in a holdup state consisting across the entire South.

22:28.240 --> 22:30.080
You know, yeah, everybody was like,

22:30.080 --> 22:34.160
I have never seen so much backhanded positivity towards Fedora before.

22:34.160 --> 22:39.680
That's really, it's impressive, Neil, because especially after that tragedy where

22:39.680 --> 22:43.520
every single Fedora user lost all their data because Fedora uses ButterFS.

22:43.520 --> 22:48.240
So, I mean, I'm impressed it still has goodwill after all that data loss that happened.

22:48.960 --> 22:51.600
Right. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

22:51.600 --> 22:55.920
So, in Popey's first example of how it could go wrong,

22:55.920 --> 23:01.520
he said that they recommend installing Windows on the Steam Deck.

23:01.520 --> 23:06.240
I think we can just take that as a given because as Linux nerds,

23:06.240 --> 23:10.720
we buy devices with Windows and Mac OS on it,

23:10.720 --> 23:13.840
and we're not happy until we've got it running Linux.

23:13.840 --> 23:17.760
And it's very rare for a Windows centric group of nerds

23:18.480 --> 23:21.680
to get a device that's running something other than Windows

23:21.680 --> 23:25.920
and have the hack challenge of installing Windows on it.

23:25.920 --> 23:29.280
So, I think we can say absolutely positively,

23:29.280 --> 23:32.000
they are going to install Windows on the Steam Deck.

23:32.000 --> 23:32.960
We should brace ourselves.

23:32.960 --> 23:35.120
There was those challenges to get, what was it,

23:35.120 --> 23:39.360
Windows 95 running on an iPhone like seven years ago and things like that?

23:39.360 --> 23:42.800
It's a fair point, and we shouldn't necessarily take it as even a negative thing.

23:42.800 --> 23:45.920
It's just natural for a Windows user to want to do that.

23:45.920 --> 23:47.520
Just brace yourself, it's going to happen.

23:47.520 --> 24:01.360
Don't freak out, it's okay.
