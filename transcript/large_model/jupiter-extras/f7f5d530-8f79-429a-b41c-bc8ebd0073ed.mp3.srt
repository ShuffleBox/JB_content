1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,680
How you doing Brent? So we were talking on telegram earlier about upgrading your wi-fi

2
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:10,560
and your router and your firewall and stuffs and things and things and stuff.

3
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:13,680
So tell me what's going on man?

4
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:18,320
I mean you have a small part in this. We've been upgrading some of my devices.

5
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:25,280
So I got an axe 250 and it seems I'm just taking all my legacy devices and getting fancier. So I

6
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:30,160
was thinking geez that router I've got in the closet over there is pretty darn old.

7
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:34,800
It's an old WRT-54G which were pretty classic what like 10 years ago.

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,240
It's got some custom firmware and all that stuff which is super great but it's,

9
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:45,120
I think it's time. It's feeling really slow on the wi-fi.

10
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,960
What are you running on the firmware side?

11
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:53,840
I'm running tomato on that thing. It hasn't been updated maybe in two years.

12
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,120
Some say tomato.

13
00:00:55,120 --> 00:01:03,360
Tomato. Some say tomato and router. So I'm just feeling like I don't know it seems like

14
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:07,520
the time to start upgrading everything. At least I've got some momentum so I thought geez

15
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:11,680
you might just be the perfect person to ask. So I don't know what I'm doing

16
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:16,080
and I'm quite stale on the hardware side so I need some recommendations.

17
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,560
I can certainly help you spend some money if that's what you mean.

18
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:21,120
Oh well I wasn't that wasn't at the top of the list.

19
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm good at that. Let's not make it too formal like you must have some idea of what your

20
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:33,520
requirements are like low power or something. Open source preferably that kind of stuff right?

21
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:39,120
Yeah I would say at the top of the list if I'm trying to do it prioritizing I would say

22
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:48,400
open source all the way. I would say low power is always nice but a higher priority than that

23
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:55,760
would be you know things like stability and for me honestly the most practical thing would be

24
00:01:55,760 --> 00:02:01,520
some really reliable Wi-Fi. Other than that I'm pretty open you know so you know as low of budget

25
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:06,080
is great but I would rather look at options that would last a long time. I'd rather do this once

26
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:09,760
and have it be really kind of flexible so that's my preference.

27
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:13,520
Sounds like Wi-Fi is the primary driver here is that right? Is that fair?

28
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,120
Yeah ethernet's easy.

29
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:23,200
Yeah so your current router firewall situation have you ever felt that the

30
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:28,160
the ingress egress kind of performance is not where you need it?

31
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:34,640
Well I have quite low needs I would say you know the needs that you have may be a little

32
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:40,880
bit more sophisticated than mine so at this point I'm just you know I'm probably more like your

33
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:47,760
regular old user than I am sort of a power user. Now I would love to change that but in terms of

34
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:55,040
my sophistication I would say I don't know any better so I would love to gain access to local

35
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:59,280
stuff because you and I are probably going to have another one of these chats to set me up with a

36
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:05,360
local NAS and stuff like that to do some fancy things and I am container uninitiated so there's

37
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:11,360
a lot that can happen here so I want to put in a solution that can accommodate all that you know.

38
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:15,200
That's quite literally Pandora's box you're opening here you do realize that right?

39
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,640
Hey man bring it on.

40
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:22,960
So I'm a huge fan of separating my firewall from my Wi-Fi and there's a few reasons for that but

41
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:30,960
the primary one is that I can reboot my firewall and all of my Wi-Fi devices don't freak out for

42
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:38,080
10 minutes whilst they find the Wi-Fi again. So about five years ago I bought some uh it was a

43
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:45,120
pair actually of UniFi AC dual radio pro access points. I was on the fence at the time about

44
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:49,600
buying the pro version because everybody told me it was overkill and you won't need it and blah

45
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:56,080
blah blah but here I am several years later and I don't feel any need to replace or upgrade my Wi-Fi

46
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:01,280
so that's the first benefit. The second benefit is that if I want to switch out my firewalls

47
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:08,480
for any reason so let's say I decided I wanted to switch from my ISP provided router to PF sense

48
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:17,200
or ViOS or monowall or whatever else it is a UniFi security gateway even it makes the entire solution

49
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:22,240
a lot more modular. So kind of what I'm thinking might work well for you in this situation is I'm

50
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:27,280
not hearing any complaints about the throughput or routing performance of your current router

51
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:34,480
that basically your firewall seems like that's doing the job that you need it to do where it is

52
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:41,440
failing for you seems to be the Wi-Fi. So the obvious solution to me at this point would be to

53
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:47,840
get a hundred dollar or so UniFi access point plug that into one of the ethernet ports on the router

54
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:57,200
and then just use the UniFi SSID that broadcasts and the modern AC Wi-Fi standards and then if and

55
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:04,160
when you ever decide that that tomato based router isn't doing what you need it to do maybe you could

56
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:10,080
look at a PF sense box or something like that. That's not even a solution I thought of was just

57
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:14,880
breaking out the Wi-Fi into into its own little category. Now I've heard a lot about these UniFi

58
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:21,840
access points and fairly positive things but does that check the open source part of it? I believe

59
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:27,920
these are closed source no? So it doesn't look like UniFi is actually open source completely.

60
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:32,560
There are certain portions that they want to open source but apparently there's some FCC

61
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:41,040
restrictions around open sourcing software defined radio stuff. Oh that's curious. It's a bit beyond

62
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:46,480
my pay grade that kind of thing but unfortunately it doesn't look like UniFi is the open source

63
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:51,280
panacea that you want. I don't know of a good solution that is. I know that you can self-host

64
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:58,160
the UniFi controller. Okay. These access points are designed to be deployed at scale. They connect

65
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:04,480
back to a central controller. Now you can buy off the shelf from UniFi something called a cloud key

66
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:11,360
which hosts this controller software and is stupid simple to set up. You literally just power it on,

67
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:15,200
look at the IP address on the little OLED screen on the front and off you go. But those things can

68
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:21,600
be expensive. Easily running into the one to two hundred dollar range which you know if you're

69
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:27,920
deploying a hotel's worth of Wi-Fi might be worth it but in your apartment it's probably not. So

70
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:33,920
I've run for the last few years out of a docker container the UniFi controller software and this

71
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:40,240
might be a good in for you into the container world. One other nice thing about these UniFi

72
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:48,000
devices is that they're powered through PoE. So installation of them is really really easy. You

73
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:55,920
just have what's called a PoE injector between the ports on the back of your router and the

74
00:06:55,920 --> 00:07:01,040
access point. So if you want to mount one of these things on the ceiling it's really easy. All you

75
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:05,920
have to do is run a network cable to that location and then at the other end of that cable is where

76
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:10,560
you have the plug socket that actually provides the power. That's actually brilliant. It makes it

77
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:17,120
so simple right? Really simple and when you start scaling these things to having four, five, six,

78
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:25,120
seven or more on a single site you can actually get PoE switches which are really easy to use.

79
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:33,120
Which have eight ports, 16, 48 port switches that are all powered so you can run IP cameras over PoE.

80
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:39,280
You can run the access points and only ever have a single source of actual power plugged into the

81
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:45,520
wall. So that means you can run your Wi-Fi quite easily on a UPS even. So there's a lot of nice

82
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:52,800
small things you can do to really upgrade the network just simply by having the Wi-Fi separate

83
00:07:52,800 --> 00:08:00,560
from the router. What a great idea. I never even considered that. As always Alex your insights are

84
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:05,920
very valuable so thank you. Your wallet can thank me later. So what do you think you're going to go

85
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:14,240
for? Does that sound like a reasonable solution? And so this seems like an easy answer that you've

86
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:19,520
been testing for a long time. Is there anything else I should even consider? Probably not.

87
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:28,560
Okay. Not to toot my own horn but this has worked flawlessly for years and it's transported with me

88
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:34,320
across one, two, three, soon to be a fourth house and I've not had to reset the Wi-Fi up. In fact

89
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:40,240
when my mum came to stay with me this summer her phone connected to my Wi-Fi and she was like,

90
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:44,400
oh wow this is amazing. Last time I was on your Wi-Fi it was in London and now I'm in America.

91
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:54,000
I'm like yeah. That is so cool. If I'm not mistaken too these are deployed at the studio

92
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:59,920
as well the JB studio and haven't been thought about for a while. They just kind of work.

93
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:06,800
They just do the job yeah. Now the other thing to consider is that in my situation I manage my

94
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:14,400
family's Wi-Fi and when when doing that remotely that can be a challenge but these access points

95
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:20,640
at my parents houses both connect back to my central unify controller which I run on a droplet

96
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:26,640
and so I'm able to control their Wi-Fi and fix any Wi-Fi issues they've got remotely

97
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:33,840
which is really nice. And so can we talk about my router for a moment? It's quite old and I'm just

98
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:38,480
wondering if that's something I need to worry about. I guess maybe the hardware as a plain old

99
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:44,080
router might just be fine if it's not you know if it's disjointed from the Wi-Fi and so if I just

100
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:50,720
update that thing maybe with a new like OpenWRT software that might just be fine. Do you even

101
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:55,920
need to? You know I suppose that stems from the question of can it do some of the fancier features

102
00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:00,160
like allowing me to connect in with WireGuard and that kind of stuff. You know you could spend

103
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:06,480
easily 100 bucks on a new router or you could spend 30 on a Raspberry Pi and do it on that

104
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:13,440
instead and it's still low power. Interesting this might be the first implementation of my very first

105
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:19,520
single board computer in some infrastructure. Yeah now that Pi could run WireGuard it could run the

106
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:25,200
unify controller software it could run Home Assistant if you wanted to get into that as well

107
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:32,720
maybe. You know the Pi 4 is super powerful. So is the Pi good enough for like set and forget though?

108
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:39,200
Yeah I think so. If you were to get the Pi 3b plus that boots over USB so you just get a USB

109
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:45,440
hard drive whereas the Pi 4 currently doesn't yet support USB boot but I believe it's coming

110
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:53,440
air quotes soon. We'll see. So with regards to whether you should replace your current router

111
00:10:53,440 --> 00:11:01,040
or not like what's your what's your upload and download look like? I don't have very large needs

112
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:08,880
I think I'm getting five no I've got fiber so I'm on the lowest fiber and it's 10 down it's like

113
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:16,480
five up or something like that and that's plenty fast for what I'm doing you know I'm never needing

114
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:22,560
to do anything very quickly on a time schedule so I'm uploading lots of photos and stuff like that

115
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:28,960
to a you know a server that I can serve to clients but it's never on like a I don't need it immediately

116
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:33,280
kind of basis so that's been working just fine for me. So if your current route is working just

117
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:40,240
fine I would I would leave that alone and then save save that money and spend it on as good a

118
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:48,160
wi-fi on your LAN as you can afford and then store your files locally connected to a Pi or maybe a

119
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:54,240
Pi or maybe a cheap x86 box. I have a few of those. I sent you a link in telegram to my

120
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:59,760
PFSense build which is a it's a hundred and one hundred and sixty dollars or so I spent on this

121
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:08,400
thing and it's got an i5 low power version in it i5 3470T it's got an Intel motherboard that's got

122
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:13,840
dual Intel NICs and I spent a hundred and sixty three dollars on this thing and it it would make

123
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:21,760
a fine base for a NAS system. So you know I think realistically you're going to look at spending by

124
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:28,880
the time you've done the wi-fi and have some kind of a local system that can run WireGuard a minimum

125
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:35,040
of 150 US but you could spend obviously you know the sky's the limit but you you know you could

126
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:42,160
spend 250 and have an x86 box that's always on low power that kind of thing as well as really great

127
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:47,120
wi-fi and then start scaling the system up from there really. So I have some things to think about

128
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:52,720
sounds like. Always it's always a trade-off in terms of how much money do I want to spend how

129
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:59,120
little do I want to eat this month. I eat quite a bit. I know I know you do. I feel like those are

130
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:04,320
really great options. I'm gonna have to think a little bit more if I want to tackle this all at

131
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:10,480
once or or split it up but at least those are two sound forks in the road right. Well that is the

132
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:15,600
beauty of a modular approach right you don't have to necessarily do all of these things all at once

133
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:20,240
you know you can just upgrade the wi-fi this month and then in a couple of months time you

134
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:25,760
can then tackle the WireGuard situation and just keep building slowly but surely and

135
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:32,640
eventually after time you'll have built a really quite sophisticated system that if any one thing

136
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:37,120
fails you've only got to replace that one thing and not the whole thing. You know there's something

137
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:42,480
kind of beautiful about that approach. I always say have backups to backups so it feels like if

138
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:47,840
one little section breaks it's easy to switch it out so tempting. Thank you for your insights that

139
00:13:47,840 --> 00:14:07,920
sounds amazing. All right you do realize you've jumped the Ask SSHQ by doing this right.
