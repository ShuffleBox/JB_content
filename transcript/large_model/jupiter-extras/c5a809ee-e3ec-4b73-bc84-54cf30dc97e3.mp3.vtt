WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:21.920
After more than 2,000 miles, we've road tested a slew of tech and want to tell you about

00:21.920 --> 00:26.840
what held up, what failed, what we loved, and what has to go.

00:26.840 --> 00:32.440
The good and the bad of the tech, and that was Brent's best cowboy right there.

00:32.440 --> 00:33.440
You did good, Brent.

00:33.440 --> 00:34.440
Yee-haw.

00:34.440 --> 00:35.440
Yee-haw!

00:35.440 --> 00:36.440
Yee-haw!

00:36.440 --> 00:44.520
So we had some things that worked, we had some things that didn't work on this road

00:44.520 --> 00:48.400
trip, and it really was, we're stomping all over the west, and so it really does put things

00:48.400 --> 00:52.540
to their paces because we decided like idiots to do it while it's hot, too.

00:52.540 --> 00:53.540
Very hot, apparently.

00:53.540 --> 01:01.480
So I had to change even my measurement instrument kind of units of measurement to appreciate

01:01.480 --> 01:02.480
the heat.

01:02.480 --> 01:03.480
Now you know.

01:03.480 --> 01:04.480
You know now.

01:04.480 --> 01:09.320
I mean, it was, like today, it was 93 degrees, but of course the RV is a box in the sun.

01:09.320 --> 01:10.320
It's a metal box.

01:10.320 --> 01:13.520
So it gets really, really warm, so you're really constantly fighting it, and so stuff

01:13.520 --> 01:15.080
got stress tested.

01:15.080 --> 01:17.920
And we thought we'd talk about some of the things that worked.

01:17.920 --> 01:21.760
And let's start with the, we got like a couple of sections, so let's start with the tech

01:21.760 --> 01:26.440
in the RV itself, and then we'll talk about some of our podcasting tech and that kind

01:26.440 --> 01:27.440
of stuff.

01:27.440 --> 01:32.080
But the RV tech is probably the biggest area, enough so that when Brent came on board when

01:32.080 --> 01:36.480
we were still back in the Seattle area, we had to give him a tour of the tech.

01:36.480 --> 01:39.040
We have the most important thing on the tour, of course.

01:39.040 --> 01:42.980
So this one is much like the system in the studio, but a little more, so you have lights

01:42.980 --> 01:47.360
you can turn on and off, so if you were here or not, in fact, all we could do if you wanted

01:47.360 --> 01:51.000
to is you could make a bookmark on your phone, so that way you could turn off some lights

01:51.000 --> 01:53.440
up front or something like that if you wanted to.

01:53.440 --> 01:54.440
Yeah, that would be great.

01:54.440 --> 01:57.600
And then there's a lot of just quick access right here, so this has kind of been more

01:57.600 --> 02:04.200
designed for the family, so you have a little bit of weather information, temperature information.

02:04.200 --> 02:06.200
Interior temperatures, that's cool.

02:06.200 --> 02:07.200
Humidity, yeah.

02:07.200 --> 02:11.440
And then there's other weird things we can pull in here, too, like we can pull in the

02:11.440 --> 02:13.360
piehole stats and we can see.

02:13.360 --> 02:14.400
This is fun.

02:14.400 --> 02:17.880
So there's 36 active network clients right now in the RV.

02:17.880 --> 02:19.320
That's not bad for an RV, right?

02:19.320 --> 02:20.320
Yeah, not bad at all.

02:20.320 --> 02:26.000
There's not a lot going on, because most of the cameras are down, but some of the cameras,

02:26.000 --> 02:34.240
you can pull them in here, but they don't record, and they're mostly offline.

02:34.240 --> 02:36.600
Motion sensor information, but again, none of that's really all that really, what you're

02:36.600 --> 02:40.400
gonna really care about would just be good stuff on that tablet.

02:40.400 --> 02:45.320
And so you got them all labeled, so bedroom oil heater and extra heat.

02:45.320 --> 02:46.320
Little icons.

02:46.320 --> 02:47.320
Yeah.

02:47.320 --> 02:48.480
Yeah, little icons.

02:48.480 --> 02:51.960
This is basically like the same kind of tablet that we have at the studio, only just the

02:51.960 --> 02:52.960
bigger version.

02:52.960 --> 02:53.960
Yeah.

02:53.960 --> 02:54.960
And then this is just a little, turn it off.

02:54.960 --> 02:55.960
A power button.

02:55.960 --> 02:58.080
Just so we know where it is, yeah.

02:58.080 --> 03:03.240
That's all in Home Assistant, which is running on a Raspberry Pi 4, and it does things beyond

03:03.240 --> 03:06.920
just some of the basics, like it does some of our automation in the heating and cooling

03:06.920 --> 03:11.800
system, at nighttime and morning automations, temperature and humidity monitoring throughout

03:11.800 --> 03:13.040
the RV.

03:13.040 --> 03:16.040
It's sort of like the central brain of what's going on in the RV.

03:16.040 --> 03:20.120
I really loved it because I could just sort of sneak back there every once in a while

03:20.120 --> 03:24.120
when I got curious and see how all the systems are doing.

03:24.120 --> 03:28.480
And mostly I was curious about the temperature of the little compartment up here that holds

03:28.480 --> 03:29.480
all the electronics.

03:29.480 --> 03:30.480
Yeah.

03:30.480 --> 03:31.480
Yeah.

03:31.480 --> 03:32.480
Watching that as we're going down the road was tricky.

03:32.480 --> 03:33.480
And the server room, if you will.

03:33.480 --> 03:34.480
Yeah, it is.

03:34.480 --> 03:35.480
It is.

03:35.480 --> 03:38.800
Also in that server room is a Plex instance running on that Raspberry Pi, and I do a little

03:38.800 --> 03:42.720
refresh of the TV and the movies for the road trip before we go, so we put like the

03:42.720 --> 03:48.200
mummy on there that, you know, all of them and updated some TV shows for the kids so

03:48.200 --> 03:50.860
that way they'd have something to watch on the LAN when we're going through the passes

03:50.860 --> 03:52.960
where we might not have connectivity.

03:52.960 --> 03:57.020
And then another thing that I do is I run a local sync thing instance.

03:57.020 --> 04:01.120
And then, Brandon, I don't know if I've mentioned this to you before, but I also run an instance

04:01.120 --> 04:05.840
in the studio, no surprise there, and I run an instance up in the cloud on the node.

04:05.840 --> 04:10.760
And what I do is I kind of co sync stuff between those two things so I can pull down a file

04:10.760 --> 04:15.520
from the Linode server and a file from the studio server at the same time.

04:15.520 --> 04:20.240
And the way my router will balance it sometimes is I'm using different carriers to pull from

04:20.240 --> 04:21.380
different servers.

04:21.380 --> 04:26.360
So I can actually slam quite a bit of data onto and take data off of the RV servers that

04:26.360 --> 04:27.360
way.

04:27.360 --> 04:30.840
Yeah, I've been actually really impressed even in just the everyday browsing.

04:30.840 --> 04:35.800
I know I was doing a little bit of work, which usually I'm running through my, you know,

04:35.800 --> 04:41.120
cell phone and has a single source, but it was really behaving nicely.

04:41.120 --> 04:44.680
I know you've got this, well, you call it your fuse kind of tunnel.

04:44.680 --> 04:45.680
Yeah, fusion tunnel.

04:45.680 --> 04:46.680
Yeah.

04:46.680 --> 04:47.680
Yeah.

04:47.680 --> 04:51.240
Well, it all really is made possible by my PEP wave, I have a PEP wave max transit.

04:51.240 --> 04:53.440
And that's bringing in a couple of carriers together.

04:53.440 --> 05:00.460
And then it creates as an option, a bonded VPN that bonds those carriers into one connection.

05:00.460 --> 05:05.680
And then it is constantly monitoring the latency and performance of the different cellular

05:05.680 --> 05:09.840
providers and figuring out what is the best route for traffic and whatnot.

05:09.840 --> 05:15.040
And so if there is signal to be had because the antenna is mounted on the roof and it's,

05:15.040 --> 05:16.800
you know, it's a pretty strong antenna.

05:16.800 --> 05:19.800
If there is signal to be had that system will load balance it.

05:19.800 --> 05:26.600
But then another part of my philosophy around making cellular connectivity feel faster is

05:26.600 --> 05:30.960
to use little tricks whenever you can to not use the cellular connection.

05:30.960 --> 05:36.720
So if you can have something on the LAN like DNS or the files that you're looking for or

05:36.720 --> 05:40.640
a local cache, then you don't need to go out to the LTE connection.

05:40.640 --> 05:43.520
So an example of that is we have PiHole running here.

05:43.520 --> 05:47.120
We have a dedicated Raspberry Pi that just runs PiHole.

05:47.120 --> 05:52.300
And it also is the, as a function of that, it is the DHCP server of the network.

05:52.300 --> 05:58.160
And that serves as blocking at the network level, a whole bunch of like banner ads and

05:58.160 --> 06:02.960
junk and tracking scripts that we just don't need to waste network traffic with.

06:02.960 --> 06:07.440
I would imagine with the number of devices running here at any one time while we're rolling

06:07.440 --> 06:10.440
down the road, that probably saves quite a bit of bandwidth.

06:10.440 --> 06:15.120
Do you have any idea of kind of how many ads or any, any kind of metric around that?

06:15.120 --> 06:17.440
I do get a lot of metrics from the PiHole box.

06:17.440 --> 06:24.200
It's surprising because, you know, every little stinking box, every little smart box or IoT

06:24.200 --> 06:27.620
device, they all love to phone home.

06:27.620 --> 06:30.640
And the PiHole blocks a ton of those.

06:30.640 --> 06:34.920
Like so right now it looks like there are 98,000 domains on the block list.

06:34.920 --> 06:42.240
And out of the queries that we've done in a 24 hour period, it's blocked 5,499.

06:42.240 --> 06:43.240
It's working.

06:43.240 --> 06:44.240
Yeah.

06:44.240 --> 06:47.560
And that's stuff that would never have, you know, that's all, that's 5,000, that's six,

06:47.560 --> 06:50.760
almost 5,500 requests that would have gone out over the network.

06:50.760 --> 06:56.040
And can I ask why you have this on a dedicated box, a little Pi, but you have a bunch of

06:56.040 --> 06:59.880
other stuff running on a single other Pi.

06:59.880 --> 07:05.580
Network services, you know, like DHCP and DNS, I want them to be online when the other

07:05.580 --> 07:07.480
systems are rebooting.

07:07.480 --> 07:12.020
And so I can reboot the Home Assistant Pi that also has Plex and SyncThing and Duplicati

07:12.020 --> 07:17.000
and a bunch of other services that measure network latency and stuff like Smokeping.

07:17.000 --> 07:20.320
And anyways, I can run all of that on one Pi.

07:20.320 --> 07:24.520
And if I keep the network services on a separate box, then I can reboot them independently

07:24.520 --> 07:25.800
and they don't affect each other really.

07:25.800 --> 07:29.640
And so when I, and when I restart the Pi that has all of the different services on there,

07:29.640 --> 07:34.200
when it comes back online, I want DHCP and I want DNS to all be available for those services.

07:34.200 --> 07:39.360
So I've done the, I've done the power math and decided to, you know, spend the power

07:39.360 --> 07:40.480
on another Pi.

07:40.480 --> 07:45.140
And I say that quite seriously, because if you think about it, these things run 24 seven.

07:45.140 --> 07:48.640
And so even if they're only pulling, you know, 15, 20 Watts or whatever it is, it's a tiny

07:48.640 --> 07:50.900
amount for these Raspberry Pis.

07:50.900 --> 07:56.080
It adds up 24 seven and it means less runtime on our batteries.

07:56.080 --> 08:03.560
And a big special thank you to Linode for making this road trip possible, for helping

08:03.560 --> 08:06.120
with the reunion and for literally putting gas in our tank.

08:06.120 --> 08:09.960
Go to colonytracker.live to get $100 in credit at Linode.

08:09.960 --> 08:21.560
That's how we host everything.

08:21.560 --> 08:29.840
Now you mentioned, well, you didn't quite mention solar, but I think you were headed

08:29.840 --> 08:31.120
in that direction there.

08:31.120 --> 08:33.800
There was some implications of solar, I think.

08:33.800 --> 08:35.560
There was some power saving.

08:35.560 --> 08:41.000
I'm curious to know what you think, because I've kind of normalized living off grid now,

08:41.000 --> 08:42.440
as weird as that sounds.

08:42.440 --> 08:45.960
I'm used to doing like the power dance to make sure we're not using too much power and

08:45.960 --> 08:46.960
to keep an eye on the batteries.

08:46.960 --> 08:52.880
But yeah, we've got about 1300 Watts of solar up on the roof of lady jupes.

08:52.880 --> 08:56.380
That comes into 600 amp hours of battle born lithium batteries.

08:56.380 --> 09:01.240
And then there's a Victron inverter charge controller system that manages all of that.

09:01.240 --> 09:02.600
And I love it.

09:02.600 --> 09:06.600
To me, it is like one of my favorite things about the RV.

09:06.600 --> 09:11.720
You know, while we were in Denver, we were parked for eight days off grid, eight days

09:11.720 --> 09:13.800
of running off of battery and solar.

09:13.800 --> 09:20.840
Thankfully it was unbelievably hot and there was a lot of solar radiation that the RV could

09:20.840 --> 09:21.840
soak up.

09:21.840 --> 09:26.320
But I'm curious from your perspective, because I mean, not only was this sort of like your

09:26.320 --> 09:30.400
first road trip around America's West, but I imagine it's probably one of your first

09:30.400 --> 09:32.040
solar powered road trips as well.

09:32.040 --> 09:33.040
It really is.

09:33.040 --> 09:37.120
And I've been curious before, but never had the hands on experience.

09:37.120 --> 09:41.160
And I think what's interesting is that perspective you talked about, which is that you're like

09:41.160 --> 09:43.880
in the nuts and bolts of all these systems.

09:43.880 --> 09:48.160
And I'm really just coming in turnkey and operating the stuff.

09:48.160 --> 09:56.280
And so I think one thing I found really interesting was having to learn what Watts matter.

09:56.280 --> 09:59.040
I didn't really care before because I never had to.

09:59.040 --> 10:02.480
But all of a sudden, when you're on solar and when you have that fancy display that

10:02.480 --> 10:06.760
you've got there that shows sort of where all the power is routing, it was really neat

10:06.760 --> 10:07.760
to watch.

10:07.760 --> 10:10.340
But also it makes you care about what you're consuming.

10:10.340 --> 10:15.720
So we've been very, very careful about when to run the toaster oven, you know.

10:15.720 --> 10:18.720
The other thing that's been a challenge on this trip, like it was in our Texas trip,

10:18.720 --> 10:21.160
is managing the heat.

10:21.160 --> 10:27.420
Because inverting a lot of power, say to run the air conditioning, generates a lot of heat.

10:27.420 --> 10:31.560
And then where the batteries are at, which is in the lower chassis area of the RV, that's

10:31.560 --> 10:36.440
near the drivetrain, which when you're driving down the road and it's 100 degrees outside,

10:36.440 --> 10:38.120
generates a lot of heat.

10:38.120 --> 10:42.120
And so it turns out that we kept finding ourselves in these positions where we were managing

10:42.120 --> 10:44.980
temperature states way more than I'd like to.

10:44.980 --> 10:49.600
And so definitely one of the things that is on my mind now is how to get some sort of

10:49.600 --> 10:54.160
automated cooling system into that battery bay that doesn't expose it to the elements

10:54.160 --> 10:59.720
of outside and doesn't damage anything by installing it, but is a way that I can flip

10:59.720 --> 11:04.360
a switch on the dash or have home assistant kick in when a certain temperature is reached

11:04.360 --> 11:05.500
and start cooling it.

11:05.500 --> 11:10.120
Because there were times when it was 100 degrees out and we couldn't run our air conditioning

11:10.120 --> 11:16.100
because the combination of the heat outside plus the recent driving and the inversion

11:16.100 --> 11:19.280
load meant it was too much heat generated.

11:19.280 --> 11:20.280
That's a pain in the butt.

11:20.280 --> 11:24.140
You mentioned this dance that you were doing and I remember some of the stops that we made

11:24.140 --> 11:29.160
on the side of the road at these rest stops and it was almost more stressful for you to

11:29.160 --> 11:35.400
be stopped than driving because of that balance between heat from, you know, the concrete

11:35.400 --> 11:40.240
that we were on, but also the heat the engines producing, the heat the inverters are producing,

11:40.240 --> 11:44.900
the heat that's in the RV and then you got the air conditioning to try to kind of balance

11:44.900 --> 11:45.900
all that.

11:45.900 --> 11:46.900
So you were just...

11:46.900 --> 11:47.960
While the sun's beating down on you.

11:47.960 --> 11:53.040
It is a lot and when you're, at least when you're going, when you're moving, the alternator

11:53.040 --> 11:58.360
is generating some current, so it's, you're not, you're not inverting very much and you're

11:58.360 --> 12:03.260
generating power and you can turn on the dash air conditioning.

12:03.260 --> 12:06.000
So thankfully every now and then we could get somewhere, we could, we could fire up

12:06.000 --> 12:10.720
the generator and if we bypassed charging the batteries and if we bypassed inverting

12:10.720 --> 12:14.740
power from the batteries and just took it from the generator, we could run the air conditioning

12:14.740 --> 12:17.660
because there was no inversion, there was no charging, it was just straight generator

12:17.660 --> 12:22.320
power to air conditioning and that worked, but you can only do that in certain circumstances.

12:22.320 --> 12:23.440
So it was a lot.

12:23.440 --> 12:26.820
The power system overall though, in terms of what it's designed to do, which is power

12:26.820 --> 12:30.440
the RV and keep us going, it performed exceptionally well actually.

12:30.440 --> 12:34.420
I mean the temperature, the heat stuff is, I mean it's a hundred degrees outside and

12:34.420 --> 12:37.680
it's right next to the engine and the transmission and all that kind of stuff.

12:37.680 --> 12:41.680
So there are, there are things I could do to improve the thermal situation, but at the

12:41.680 --> 12:46.520
end of the day when it's so hot outside and you're inverting 3000 watts of power to run

12:46.520 --> 12:50.520
two air conditioners, you're just running into a physics thing there.

12:50.520 --> 12:53.080
As far as like those BattleBorn batteries, they held up.

12:53.080 --> 12:58.080
I mean, you know, we'd go park somewhere at night and we wouldn't really worry about it.

12:58.080 --> 13:02.360
We would just run our noise makers and have our televisions on and lights on and we'd

13:02.360 --> 13:06.160
be sitting outside in the parking lot, wherever we were at watching TV on the outdoor television,

13:06.160 --> 13:10.120
all running off of battery, pretty much knowing that the next day we'd get enough solar and

13:10.120 --> 13:12.200
drive time to charge it all back up.

13:12.200 --> 13:16.560
You know, I think, I was just thinking, I never once worried about running out and I

13:16.560 --> 13:21.160
think that just says that you guys are experts at managing all these systems.

13:21.160 --> 13:24.840
Never once did we go under like 30% or anything like that, even overnight.

13:24.840 --> 13:33.480
So I think, I think we did pretty good.

13:33.480 --> 13:36.200
Now let's talk about something you could use in any vehicle.

13:36.200 --> 13:40.640
And I think it is criminal that they're not, it's not, this information isn't just already

13:40.640 --> 13:44.200
displayed on larger vehicles, but when I'm going down the road or especially when I'm

13:44.200 --> 13:46.440
climbing passes, I'd like all the data.

13:46.440 --> 13:48.440
I want to know what my intake air temperature is.

13:48.440 --> 13:49.800
I want to know what my coolant temperature is.

13:49.800 --> 13:51.600
I want to know what my cylinder head temperatures are.

13:51.600 --> 13:53.640
I want to know what my transmission temperature is.

13:53.640 --> 13:55.360
I want to know if my engine's misfiring.

13:55.360 --> 13:57.240
I want to know what my brake temperatures are, right?

13:57.240 --> 13:59.280
I want to know all the data.

13:59.280 --> 14:04.080
And the thing is, it's very frustrating about this, is a lot of car computers have all this

14:04.080 --> 14:05.080
information.

14:05.080 --> 14:07.720
They're just not showing it to you.

14:07.720 --> 14:12.000
And that is inexcusable when you're operating a 25,000 pound vehicle.

14:12.000 --> 14:13.600
You need that information.

14:13.600 --> 14:18.200
And that's why I got this little ODB2 plug.

14:18.200 --> 14:22.860
Mine's called the VP01, the V peak, V E E peak.

14:22.860 --> 14:26.680
And you plug it into the ODB2 port of your vehicle's computer.

14:26.680 --> 14:29.440
It creates a wifi network.

14:29.440 --> 14:33.480
You join, they recommend an iOS device, but you can use an Android device as well.

14:33.480 --> 14:35.560
You join that wifi network.

14:35.560 --> 14:37.940
You're the only device on that network, right?

14:37.940 --> 14:40.960
And then you launch an app, a reader app.

14:40.960 --> 14:45.820
In my case, I use ODB Fusion, which is fantastic.

14:45.820 --> 14:48.760
And it really lets you customize the hell out of it.

14:48.760 --> 14:49.760
It connects.

14:49.760 --> 14:50.760
That app connects.

14:50.760 --> 14:54.420
It reads all the computer PIDs, all the things that the computer is capable of relaying.

14:54.420 --> 14:58.760
And then it allows you to build a series of dashboards of temperature gauges and recreate

14:58.760 --> 15:03.120
all of the stuff that should be just built into the damn dashboard.

15:03.120 --> 15:07.040
And I have an iPad Pro that mounts onto my dash.

15:07.040 --> 15:12.000
And then all of that information comes streaming into my iPad and I can monitor so much stuff

15:12.000 --> 15:16.900
with that, that it is, I think, an absolutely essential part of by driving.

15:16.900 --> 15:19.080
And it's just nuts that you don't have it in there.

15:19.080 --> 15:20.280
And so I totally recommend these.

15:20.280 --> 15:22.920
They also have Bluetooth models, depending on what you need.

15:22.920 --> 15:25.600
And those work with a wider range of devices.

15:25.600 --> 15:29.360
If you don't have anything in there now, you can plug this into your ODB2 port and get

15:29.360 --> 15:33.400
all this information, including diagnostic information, if there's ever air codes and

15:33.400 --> 15:34.400
stuff.

15:34.400 --> 15:38.920
I was really impressed when I saw this dashboard and you and I just were kind of staring at

15:38.920 --> 15:40.920
it for a while, just taking in all the information.

15:40.920 --> 15:48.640
I think for people like us who generally like Linux-y things, this speaks to us.

15:48.640 --> 15:53.360
But just that I think you would agree with this, just the more information you can get

15:53.360 --> 15:58.400
about the rig, the more you can understand how to better operate the rig and to make

15:58.400 --> 15:59.400
it last longer.

15:59.400 --> 16:00.400
Yep.

16:00.400 --> 16:01.400
Yeah.

16:01.400 --> 16:03.580
My goal when I'm driving this thing is not to be stressing out the engine a whole bunch

16:03.580 --> 16:05.400
because I want it to last.

16:05.400 --> 16:07.700
And that information makes it vital.

16:07.700 --> 16:10.520
We also have a live tracker on board.

16:10.520 --> 16:15.920
This uses OwnTrax that runs on a Linode instance, and that is where we generate the embeddable

16:15.920 --> 16:18.540
web page and it does all of the logging.

16:18.540 --> 16:23.760
And then there is an OwnTrax client that runs on my Android device that updates over HTTP

16:23.760 --> 16:29.020
any time the Android OS detects what they call significant movement.

16:29.020 --> 16:30.020
Did we define that yet?

16:30.020 --> 16:33.460
I don't think so, but I think it's basically when it gets moved.

16:33.460 --> 16:35.480
You can also turn on precise motion tracking.

16:35.480 --> 16:36.480
And that's been awesome.

16:36.480 --> 16:40.280
People have used that to track us down and we've done micro meetups as we call them with

16:40.280 --> 16:42.480
folks and they use the live map.

16:42.480 --> 16:44.880
And I just turn it on and set it and forget it.

16:44.880 --> 16:47.960
You know, as long as the Android device is powered up and OwnTrax is running in the background,

16:47.960 --> 16:50.380
it's logging our location in real time.

16:50.380 --> 16:54.840
And OwnTrax supports, you could have multiple vehicles, you could do this, everyone in your

16:54.840 --> 16:57.560
family could have that if that's your thing.

16:57.560 --> 17:00.440
You don't have to use it to actually make the information public.

17:00.440 --> 17:08.840
It's just what we do.

17:08.840 --> 17:10.120
You want to talk about audio gear?

17:10.120 --> 17:11.840
Because that's really the whole reason we're here.

17:11.840 --> 17:13.920
And I see a lot of it right in front of you now.

17:13.920 --> 17:18.780
We haven't gotten any of our failures and unfortunately, this is where the ugly part

17:18.780 --> 17:20.080
comes in.

17:20.080 --> 17:26.200
For the first time ever, our handy Zoom H4 portable recorders gave us various problems.

17:26.200 --> 17:29.960
Yeah, this was on I think night number one even.

17:29.960 --> 17:35.640
We were trying to record some stuff and thinking about how the rest of the trip would be recorded

17:35.640 --> 17:37.640
and setting ourselves up.

17:37.640 --> 17:44.040
And I think to our surprise, one of the ports was really, really, really noisy to the point

17:44.040 --> 17:47.760
where we just had to stroke it off the list for the rest of the trip.

17:47.760 --> 17:49.800
And I think you were pretty disappointed about that.

17:49.800 --> 17:50.800
Yeah.

17:50.800 --> 17:53.160
And then the other Zoom that we had was having SD card problems.

17:53.160 --> 17:54.160
Remember that?

17:54.160 --> 17:55.160
Oh, yeah.

17:55.160 --> 17:56.160
Yeah.

17:56.160 --> 17:58.840
Haven't had file system problems on SD cards in a while, but sure enough, it wouldn't even

17:58.840 --> 18:01.560
format it and we put different ones in there.

18:01.560 --> 18:02.840
It was stressful, actually.

18:02.840 --> 18:10.280
We were worried it was starting to actually wreck the SD card, but what did work out really

18:10.280 --> 18:16.120
well is once we got basically one good working by connecting the, I guess, frankensteining

18:16.120 --> 18:19.800
the two of them together, you could say about what worked really well with them was our

18:19.800 --> 18:22.240
Sennheiser MD 46 mics.

18:22.240 --> 18:23.640
They just rocked loud environments.

18:23.640 --> 18:28.520
Yeah, this is a microphone that we ended up choosing for my voice for some of the recordings

18:28.520 --> 18:33.240
that I've been doing, the brunches and all of the stuff for Linux Unplugged, but it turns

18:33.240 --> 18:36.340
out this is a really great microphone for on location stuff.

18:36.340 --> 18:40.240
And did we ever put it to its paces?

18:40.240 --> 18:48.480
We tested it in system 76 as sort of production environment, factory noises, ovens, and like

18:48.480 --> 18:52.160
loud mills and stuff, and it performed wonderfully.

18:52.160 --> 18:55.560
Not to mention the meetup that we had in Denver.

18:55.560 --> 18:57.520
I thought that was going to...

18:57.520 --> 18:58.520
I wasn't even...

18:58.520 --> 18:59.520
There was live music.

18:59.520 --> 19:04.200
There was, I mean, 90 in our group and then probably another couple of hundred people

19:04.200 --> 19:05.680
that were just there having a good time.

19:05.680 --> 19:10.940
Yeah, you and I were, our voices were super tired after that event because we had to just

19:10.940 --> 19:16.400
keep them at a high pace to try to have people hear us, but listening back to some of the

19:16.400 --> 19:21.480
recordings that we made and they're very surprisingly clear, so this microphone started shining

19:21.480 --> 19:22.480
for us.

19:22.480 --> 19:26.720
Yeah, if you ever need a mobile microphone, you can throw in your bag, you can count on

19:26.720 --> 19:29.800
it in noisy environments, the MD-46 is it.

19:29.800 --> 19:31.320
We are in a noisy environment right now.

19:31.320 --> 19:33.360
You can probably hear some of it in the background.

19:33.360 --> 19:34.360
We're still here in Colorado.

19:34.360 --> 19:38.040
We're at a campground and this is just one of the last things we're recording before

19:38.040 --> 19:39.040
we head out.

19:39.040 --> 19:41.940
And even for an environment like this, it works pretty well and Brent and I are sitting

19:41.940 --> 19:43.280
next to each other.

19:43.280 --> 19:47.160
But in the RV, that setup was really simple and effective.

19:47.160 --> 19:50.340
It's like a portable recorder and a microphone.

19:50.340 --> 19:53.560
Maybe we throw in a phone every now and then if we need to capture some B-roll audio or

19:53.560 --> 19:54.560
something.

19:54.560 --> 19:58.000
But in the RV, that's where we're doing the big shows, right?

19:58.000 --> 20:02.320
We're doing the live stream and we're doing the day to day production stuff.

20:02.320 --> 20:06.220
So in the RV, we have RE-320 microphones, although when Brent's here, he actually still

20:06.220 --> 20:08.720
uses the MD-46 because he sounds great with it.

20:08.720 --> 20:10.680
I prefer my microphone.

20:10.680 --> 20:11.680
Yeah.

20:11.680 --> 20:17.200
And I have a Rode Procaster mixer that is a really slick four channel mixer that also

20:17.200 --> 20:23.120
brings in USB, phone audio and Bluetooth in just the coolest way possible.

20:23.120 --> 20:26.160
But it has a built-in soundboard, which is a lot of fun for me.

20:26.160 --> 20:31.520
The only downside to that is the Linux support sucks pretty bad.

20:31.520 --> 20:32.520
Oh no.

20:32.520 --> 20:33.520
Yeah.

20:33.520 --> 20:37.360
You can get it as a stereo device, but for a 40 day road trip or whatever it's going

20:37.360 --> 20:42.400
to be, I'm only halfway through right now, so I'm not sure, but for a long road trip,

20:42.400 --> 20:44.120
you need something that's multi-track.

20:44.120 --> 20:48.280
So that way you're on your own track, the soundboard, remote people.

20:48.280 --> 20:55.360
And so I did all the math I could and realized, all right, for this trip, my fastest, best

20:55.360 --> 20:58.080
machine is going to be a MacBook.

20:58.080 --> 21:03.160
And this is the first time I've gone on a long trip like this where I brought my Thinkpad,

21:03.160 --> 21:06.280
but it's not set up in any way to do remote broadcast.

21:06.280 --> 21:08.080
It's just in a rough shape.

21:08.080 --> 21:12.320
The install's in a rough shape and it doesn't do the multi-track with the Rode Procaster.

21:12.320 --> 21:18.080
However, that meant that I took essentially an untested weapon into battle.

21:18.080 --> 21:23.800
I'm pausing because that makes my sort of blood boil a little bit, makes me very uncomfortable.

21:23.800 --> 21:25.680
It was a dumb thing to do, Brent.

21:25.680 --> 21:28.360
And well, how did it go?

21:28.360 --> 21:29.360
Let's start there.

21:29.360 --> 21:34.960
The first couple of weeks were really frustrating because I think the Mac, when you don't use

21:34.960 --> 21:38.060
it a lot, it does a lot of stuff when it first boots up.

21:38.060 --> 21:41.440
And when you're on limited connectivity, it doesn't have an opportunity to do all that

21:41.440 --> 21:42.440
stuff.

21:42.440 --> 21:44.640
And so it just stretched it out over days.

21:44.640 --> 21:49.140
And I would be sitting here trying to do a Koda radio or a Linux unplugged live and it's

21:49.140 --> 21:54.520
using up all of my available bandwidth, syncing stuff in the background, copying files, processing

21:54.520 --> 21:57.480
faces and photos, like just all this stuff.

21:57.480 --> 22:02.520
I just kept sitting here thinking if this was a Linux box, I could kill these processes

22:02.520 --> 22:04.360
or they just would never happen, right?

22:04.360 --> 22:05.520
It just would never be going on.

22:05.520 --> 22:06.740
And it was driving me nuts.

22:06.740 --> 22:13.920
And I ultimately ended up through a combination of removing some stuff, turning off some settings

22:13.920 --> 22:20.000
and installing a local firewall and then just denying outbound access to the bunch of stuff.

22:20.000 --> 22:21.000
Mad man.

22:21.000 --> 22:24.840
I managed to get it under control after two weeks and now it's doing pretty good.

22:24.840 --> 22:27.040
You know, it's fine.

22:27.040 --> 22:29.980
What really saves it is I can still use Reaper to record the audio.

22:29.980 --> 22:33.880
So that's really nice because that's the same app I would be using on Linux, but it gets

22:33.880 --> 22:35.380
the multitrack support.

22:35.380 --> 22:39.500
The MVP of the setup is the iPad Pro, surprisingly.

22:39.500 --> 22:43.080
Because it has its own LTE connectivity, it can do a bunch of stuff on there that doesn't

22:43.080 --> 22:44.160
affect our remote connection.

22:44.160 --> 22:46.760
And when bandwidth is tight, that really matters.

22:46.760 --> 22:49.400
Additionally, it can act as a second monitor to the MacBook.

22:49.400 --> 22:54.680
So I can actually throw windows from the Mac over there, but I can also bring up chat rooms.

22:54.680 --> 22:56.920
I can bring up our restream dashboard.

22:56.920 --> 23:01.160
I can bring up mixer controls via WireGuard from the studio mixer.

23:01.160 --> 23:07.140
And then I have this iPad mounted on a stand that puts it floating above my physical mixer.

23:07.140 --> 23:09.620
So I have my local physical mixer in front of me.

23:09.620 --> 23:14.640
And then on the iPad, floating in the air, I have a software version of the studio's

23:14.640 --> 23:16.380
mixer, which I use while we're live.

23:16.380 --> 23:21.000
And that setup has just killed it because the iPad's on its own connection, it's not

23:21.000 --> 23:25.360
taking any bandwidth, and I can use it to remotely control a mixer in Seattle while

23:25.360 --> 23:26.360
I'm in Colorado.

23:26.360 --> 23:28.720
The little buttons move in the studio, too.

23:28.720 --> 23:29.720
There's no one there to see it.

23:29.720 --> 23:33.440
Yeah, if you were there, you'd see the motorized sliders and stuff.

23:33.440 --> 23:34.600
It's so great.

23:34.600 --> 23:36.240
And WireGuard's a big part of that, too.

23:36.240 --> 23:39.280
And I know WireGuard's work has been really critical for you as well.

23:39.280 --> 23:46.160
Yeah, I, you know, in my travels, I'm always thinking about all the random networks that

23:46.160 --> 23:47.160
I'm connecting to.

23:47.160 --> 23:51.200
I will say typically, I like to connect to just one cell network, the one, you know,

23:51.200 --> 23:55.080
that I usually use a Ting SIM card in my phone.

23:55.080 --> 23:58.920
But for some reason, this trip, that has not worked very well for me.

23:58.920 --> 24:00.200
And you saw me suffer, Chris.

24:00.200 --> 24:05.200
I was trying to connect to any sort of cell towers I could, and I was just failing all

24:05.200 --> 24:06.200
the time.

24:06.200 --> 24:10.040
Now, I don't really have much equipment to do anything about that.

24:10.040 --> 24:12.920
But thankfully, there's Wi-Fi networks all over.

24:12.920 --> 24:16.760
And that makes me really nervous because I don't like connecting any of my devices to

24:16.760 --> 24:18.280
networks that I don't really know.

24:18.280 --> 24:25.020
So I have a WireGuard server that I simply use for just like this situation, VPN connecting

24:25.020 --> 24:29.760
so that I can tunnel out of somewhere into a place that I feel a little bit better.

24:29.760 --> 24:33.080
In my case, it's in Toronto, so feels close to home.

24:33.080 --> 24:38.000
And having that on all my devices and work flawlessly has been quite amazing.

24:38.000 --> 24:39.000
So thank you, WireGuard.

24:39.000 --> 24:46.600
Yeah, being able to have the same VPN on mobile and on my desktop and on my servers is just

24:46.600 --> 24:48.000
so, so great.

24:48.000 --> 24:51.440
And I'm thankful that the iOS WireGuard app is decent.

24:51.440 --> 24:55.560
And I'm thankful that WireGuard is so good on Linux.

24:55.560 --> 24:59.960
I have a WireGuard instance that runs up at Linode that I can connect to, which is

24:59.960 --> 25:04.720
what I use for browsing and just trying to like get a different online presence to avoid

25:04.720 --> 25:10.020
carrier smashing, which sometimes with some of our VoIP software, carrier smashing really

25:10.020 --> 25:11.020
messes with our connectivity.

25:11.020 --> 25:14.560
And if I route through a WireGuard tunnel up to Linode, I can get out to their general

25:14.560 --> 25:15.560
internet.

25:15.560 --> 25:16.560
And guess what?

25:16.560 --> 25:17.560
All of a sudden, it's problem free.

25:17.560 --> 25:18.560
Beautiful.

25:18.560 --> 25:19.560
Yeah.

25:19.560 --> 25:22.360
And then I have a WireGuard server running at the studio, obviously, which is how I get

25:22.360 --> 25:26.200
in to control the mixer or operate with the server there in the studio, which I connect

25:26.200 --> 25:28.360
to about once a day and do some stuff.

25:28.360 --> 25:30.520
And that has been fantastic.

25:30.520 --> 25:34.440
And then what I'll do is if it's something that's like a lot of files, I batch process

25:34.440 --> 25:35.480
that offsite with SyncThing.

25:35.480 --> 25:38.680
I don't transfer that over WireGuard like through whatever, SCP or whatever.

25:38.680 --> 25:43.580
I throw that on the SyncThing server and that takes its time as bandwidth is available and

25:43.580 --> 25:44.580
sends it all off.

25:44.580 --> 25:48.880
And, you know, that's been pretty handy because there has been times where we've captured

25:48.880 --> 25:53.160
a whole bunch of footage or a whole bunch of audio and you need a way that's reasonable

25:53.160 --> 25:58.100
to get it off of your system and offsite that doesn't crush your LTE connection.

25:58.100 --> 26:01.200
So little tricks like that have been really nice.

26:01.200 --> 26:05.420
Kind of bringing it all together has really, I think, been the secret sauce of this trip.

26:05.420 --> 26:09.200
It's a lot of moving pieces, I think even more so than all the systems that run the

26:09.200 --> 26:10.700
RV.

26:10.700 --> 26:14.760
But that's those are the systems that allow us to get the work done.

26:14.760 --> 26:18.560
And I've been impressed to watch you juggle all of those systems.

26:18.560 --> 26:19.620
Oh, man.

26:19.620 --> 26:22.780
It's been a lot for this trip just because of the heat and a lot of tearing up, tearing

26:22.780 --> 26:27.680
down and setting up stuff and a lot of moving, moving and every, you know, every few days

26:27.680 --> 26:30.280
we're moving, if not days in a row, we're moving.

26:30.280 --> 26:34.420
I think it's been a good test of your systems because you've had to tear them up or build

26:34.420 --> 26:36.380
them up and tear them down.

26:36.380 --> 26:41.800
And you've come, I think even tonight, you've come to a slightly better version of your

26:41.800 --> 26:42.800
setup.

26:42.800 --> 26:43.800
Yeah.

26:43.800 --> 26:44.800
Every time we kind of iterate a little bit.

26:44.800 --> 26:45.800
Yeah.

26:45.800 --> 26:48.920
It's one of those things like just by the time you're almost done doing it, you become

26:48.920 --> 26:49.920
an expert.

26:49.920 --> 26:50.920
Yeah.

26:50.920 --> 26:53.420
You know, there's so much more we could talk about.

26:53.420 --> 26:59.700
We have more specials from the road that we have planned soon on our West Coast expedition.

26:59.700 --> 27:03.320
Of course, Brent and I are going to wrap it up here and my road trip continues on.

27:03.320 --> 27:07.780
But we hope that you found this fascinating, interesting or at least educational.

27:07.780 --> 27:08.780
Let us know on Twitter.

27:08.780 --> 27:10.260
I'm at Chris Ellis.

27:10.260 --> 27:30.460
And I'm at Brent Jerva.
