1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,180
Well, hello, everyone.

2
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:12,420
This is Brunch with Brent.

3
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:13,420
Joining me today is Daniel Foray.

4
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:14,420
Daniel, how are you doing?

5
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:15,420
I'm doing pretty good.

6
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:16,420
How are you doing?

7
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:17,420
Yeah, I'm doing great.

8
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:19,080
It's good to hear your voice.

9
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:23,520
For those who don't know you, I think many, many do.

10
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:30,480
Daniel is the founder of Elementary OS and also a regular co-host on User Error.

11
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:35,720
For those who haven't dove into User Error yet, can you give us a bit of a sense of what

12
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:36,720
goes on there?

13
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:37,720
Yeah.

14
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:42,840
I think my favorite way to describe User Error is it's like if you got your nerd friends

15
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:47,240
and went out to the pub and then just talked about whatever random stuff you thought up,

16
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:49,860
that's kind of what the podcast is.

17
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:51,960
How could that not be lovely, right?

18
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:53,800
Yeah, it's a lot of fun.

19
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:56,160
Yeah, it seems like you guys have a lot of fun.

20
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:02,080
Joining you there is Joe Resington and Popey as well, who I've had a chat with here on

21
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:04,280
Brunch as well.

22
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:08,040
I don't know how you guys do it, but there's this dynamic between the three of you that's

23
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:10,780
just so lovely to listen to.

24
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:11,920
How does that feel on your end?

25
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,560
I appreciate you saying that.

26
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:16,280
I think it's good, too.

27
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:21,320
We've obviously met in real life before and actually had silly conversations in a pub,

28
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:27,420
so it's fun to see that we can do a show with that same dynamic and we all get along really

29
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:30,000
well and we're friends.

30
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
It's just fun.

31
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,880
It doesn't feel like work to me in any way.

32
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:36,400
That always means you're doing the right thing, I think.

33
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:39,920
I don't think I know the story of how that all started.

34
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:44,400
You mentioned that you did get a chance to be in person together and to be at a pub and

35
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,960
do kind of the same thing.

36
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:50,040
Was that before it started or after, or how did that sort of all come to be?

37
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:56,000
Yeah, so I've actually known Alan for quite a while because I've gone to a few different

38
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,720
canonical sponsored conferences.

39
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:05,040
I used to go to the Ubuntu Developer Summit when that was a thing, and then also I've

40
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:10,480
gone to a couple of the Snap events and some other things like that, and then I've met

41
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:18,080
up with him at other events like we went to Linux App Summit, and I don't remember if

42
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:22,640
I've seen him at Gwadek, but we just end up going to a lot of the same conferences.

43
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:30,040
Then I met Joe at Linux Northwest, but I've only got to see him in person once.

44
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:33,600
That I guess was the previous one last year, I would imagine, right?

45
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,600
Yeah, yeah.

46
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:37,000
I think probably you and I just missed each other.

47
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I flew in late.

48
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,680
I actually missed most of the conference last year, and I think you and I just missed each

49
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:42,680
other.

50
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:46,240
We haven't got a chance to sort of meet in person yet, which I was looking forward to

51
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:50,360
this year, but we'll see what happens.

52
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:55,680
I agree with you in that meeting in person, especially when you're co-hosting a podcast

53
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,760
together of that style, is so essential, isn't it?

54
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:04,640
Yeah, it's so different, I think, when you interact with people online and you kind of

55
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:11,040
only see their work persona, I guess, and then once you meet them in person, there's

56
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,280
just a different level of connection you have with them.

57
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:18,080
I think that's why it's so important to do these kind of conferences and things, if you're

58
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:23,140
going to work with that person in the future in any capacity, it always helps to have some

59
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:30,040
level of camaraderie with them and know that we're all working in a common interest.

60
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:33,600
I don't know if there's a lofty way to put it or anything other than just knowing that

61
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,160
you guys are cool with each other.

62
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:44,000
Yeah, that goes a long way for sharing ideas and sharing space and obviously some audio

63
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
too.

64
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,640
So yeah, I definitely support that anytime you can do it.

65
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:55,760
You did mention that you had met Alan quite a little while ago through some Ubuntu related

66
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:56,760
stuff.

67
00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:01,680
I would imagine those were some of the earlier years of elementary OS, is that sort of the

68
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,440
beginning of when you got to meet him and start all of that?

69
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:10,160
Yeah, and even before that, and I'm not sure if a whole lot of people know, but I used

70
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:16,840
to do a contract work for Ubuntu during the Unity years.

71
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:21,480
I'm not sure how much of that work still exists in Ubuntu, but a lot of the iconography and

72
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,760
things like that.

73
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:29,840
I worked with Matthew Paul Thomas on the Ubiquity design for choosing the different kinds of

74
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:34,920
installation setups and so I did a decent amount of design work for Canonical way back

75
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:35,920
in the day.

76
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:36,920
Nice.

77
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:42,040
I had no idea and I suppose that makes a lot of sense now and I would imagine informed

78
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,760
a lot of what you're doing these days.

79
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:46,720
Yeah, it's kind of interesting.

80
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:53,700
I guess in some ways it was almost the other way around where I started doing like elementary

81
00:04:53,700 --> 00:05:02,240
icons and it was at a time when Ubuntu was really looking at their major rebranding shift,

82
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:07,880
like they were going from like the whole brown and orange kind of thing and then into more

83
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:15,840
of the purple and orange stuff and one of the lead designers at the time, David Siegel,

84
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:19,720
reached out to me and he was like, hey, I like what you're doing with the elementary

85
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:20,720
icon stuff.

86
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:25,400
Do you think you could make a version for Ubuntu and propose that?

87
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:31,560
So I did and then it was kind of like through that that I ended up getting to do a lot of

88
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:35,520
work in Ubuntu and kind of like influence things a little bit.

89
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,920
Well, that sounds super fun.

90
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:44,560
It seems to me as well that it sort of fits with what I've seen as one of your personal

91
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:48,900
themes which is just rich collaboration throughout.

92
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:51,440
Does that feel like that's a thread that makes sense?

93
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,440
Yeah, definitely.

94
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:58,760
And I'm really happy to be able to be a part of a bunch of different things and like over

95
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:05,880
the years kind of getting started with like the GNOME and doki people and doing elementary

96
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:12,940
and then I've done some work, just a little bit of design work for like Martin Winpress

97
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:18,920
on the Ubuntu MATE stuff and so it's fun to just kind of get involved in different places

98
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:24,480
and I think it is kind of like, you know, everybody tries to make it that everybody's

99
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:29,280
competing with each other, but we're all kind of more of like a family and everybody wants

100
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:32,040
to work together and make everything better for everybody.

101
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:37,240
Yeah, that's what I'm learning more and more as I get a bit more integrated into our sort

102
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:43,600
of Linux and open source community is that it definitely feels massive and has a lot

103
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:49,000
of people in it and that's a wonderful thing, but at the same time somehow we've managed

104
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:54,720
to make it feel like a little close family at the same time and I find that really impressive

105
00:06:54,720 --> 00:07:01,360
and also just really cool and it sounds like you're echoing that sentiment exactly.

106
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,680
Yeah, absolutely.

107
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:10,400
I wanted to ask you a little bit more about sort of your design background because it

108
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:15,920
seems to me like that's not necessarily, you know, when we think of contributing to projects

109
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:22,260
and things like that, we often quickly go to sort of the developer standpoint, but can

110
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:25,680
you walk us a little bit through your history?

111
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:29,600
I know you're really strong in design and so where did that start for you and how did

112
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,360
that move into the software world?

113
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:38,160
I guess if I had to like really point out like the first time I started getting into

114
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:46,600
like visual design stuff, it was as a kid, my uncle was into like game development and

115
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:50,400
he loved the programming side, but he hated like sprite work and stuff like that and so

116
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:54,360
he kind of would like push it off on the me a little bit and go, hey man, you know, if

117
00:07:54,360 --> 00:08:00,080
you can come up with some cool artwork, like we can make a game together and yeah, so I

118
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:05,320
started doing some of that kind of stuff and just trying to like learn, you know, how to

119
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:13,280
do spriting for that kind of stuff and then I ended up from there kind of continuing some

120
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,760
of that like modding on different games and stuff.

121
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:22,560
There was this game called Little Fighter and it was interesting in the way that you

122
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:28,120
could easily go in and change all the sprites and everything was like scripted for all the

123
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:33,120
action so it wasn't that hard to like do custom characters and stuff like that so I really

124
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:39,960
got into that and like modding that kind of thing and then when Windows XP was kind of

125
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:46,160
the big thing then it seemed like there was a decent modding community there around like

126
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:50,440
I can't remember what all the little extensions were but there was like things for like docs

127
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:55,680
and adding shadows to the windows and like there was a bunch of Windows XP mods out and

128
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:59,800
so I was always really interested in that kind of like modding visual design kind of

129
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:09,560
stuff and then when I saw Karora Linux with the Compiz XGL demo and the 3D spinning cube

130
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:15,280
like that was for me it was like oh my god this is the ultimate playground and getting

131
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:23,840
into that stuff and then starting to see that like oh well in Windows you can kind of change

132
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:29,920
the way that stuff looks but it always acts like Windows and then in this new kind of

133
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:34,600
Linux playground like not only can you change the way stuff looks but you can change the

134
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:39,860
way it acts and that's like a whole different level because you're getting into like user

135
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:45,680
experience design and not just visual design right so that was really big for me was kind

136
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:51,800
of discovering like how flexible desktop Linux is and and getting to kind of actually move

137
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:55,320
into not just how things look but how they work too.

138
00:09:55,320 --> 00:10:00,760
It sounds like a nice gradual progression that has a lot of space to keep you really

139
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:07,340
fascinated and interested in continuing the learning curve that sounds really really great.

140
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:12,880
You mentioned sort of running into Karora there and then having Linux sort of open up

141
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,640
the world for you.

142
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:18,880
How did you first get introduced to Linux or even the open source concept?

143
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:22,960
Was it someone who shared that with you or how did that go for you?

144
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:23,960
You know what it was?

145
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:24,960
It was...

146
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:25,960
Do you remember dig.com?

147
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:26,960
Yes, I do.

148
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:32,380
Yeah, so it was on dig and I can't remember if it just popped up in like the technology

149
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:38,840
I almost called it the technology subreddit that's how like gone dig is like it was like

150
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:44,000
the technology section of dig or whatever and right and yeah it just popped up there

151
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,560
one day as like oh you could do this and you could just put this thing on a CD and like

152
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:53,880
you don't even install it or anything and you know I knew like what an operating system

153
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:58,240
was because I had technical family members and like the idea of like oh well you know

154
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:02,920
you're installing a different version of Windows or you know we knew some people had Macs and

155
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:09,340
so I got like what that idea was but I don't think I had ever heard of Linux before that.

156
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:13,160
So did you just kind of download it and throw it on a CD and you knew enough to sort of

157
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:17,000
figure that out or do you have a mentor sort of helping you out either online or off?

158
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,600
No it was totally it was just you know knowing enough to burn a CD and then popping it in

159
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:26,760
and and going oh you know this is crazy and then like kind of diving into it and then

160
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:30,640
I was reading more about it and found out that it was built on Gentoo and I was like

161
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:35,600
oh what's Gentoo and I looked into that and I downloaded the whole like Gentoo manual

162
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:40,160
and printed it out and like this big spiral binder.

163
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:44,460
That sounds pretty dedicated and to start near near Gentoo is quite the adventure as

164
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:45,460
well.

165
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:50,520
Yeah well it was you know I had no idea so I think it was such a learning experience

166
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:55,480
though to like set up a Gentoo install you know when you're starting from from nothing

167
00:11:55,480 --> 00:12:01,160
and you're like wow this is really hard but you like learn oh okay well there's so many

168
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:05,960
different components in an operating system and you're like okay I need something to manage

169
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:09,360
the network and I need something to do the login screen and I need a desktop environment

170
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:14,400
and I need a package manager and you kind of realize like oh okay like this is more

171
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:18,080
complicated than it seems on the surface and there's so many different choices you can

172
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:29,040
make and then what I actually got me into Ubuntu was finding out I was trying to work

173
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:35,720
on like an updates manager for Gentoo because I was like this is really complicated and

174
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:39,640
I didn't really have any development chops I was just kind of like trying to jam something

175
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:44,080
together in Python and I don't think I ever got very far but and then I saw that Ubuntu

176
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:47,200
had an updates manager and I was like that's it I'm switching Ubuntu I don't even know

177
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,200
what it is.

178
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:53,420
But it sounds like you kind of tripped over an accidental like initiation into really

179
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:59,580
learning the different pieces that it takes to put a distribution together and it sounds

180
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:05,960
like that happened early on for you which isn't isn't everybody's sort of path into

181
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:12,200
Linux but I would imagine that would inform what you're doing today in a really meaningful

182
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,200
way.

183
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:20,380
Because for me it was about figuring out how to put together a different operating system

184
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:27,260
it wasn't really about just using the operating system and so going through the stuff with

185
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:32,800
Gentoo was I wasn't intimidated by at all because my my goal wasn't to just like pop

186
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:36,640
something in and have it up and running it was to build something you know.

187
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:41,320
It sounds like you were looking for a playground at that time yeah absolutely and having fallen

188
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:47,800
on to a Gentoo was totally totally fine and and really fun actually I would imagine.

189
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:54,400
Yeah challenging challenging for sure but but fun and yeah it's a it's a wild world

190
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:59,480
with how how complex a Gentoo install can get.

191
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:04,960
I'll take your word for it I will say I'm uninitiated there but but everyone I know

192
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:12,260
who've who have dove into trying a Gentoo install have really have always said they've

193
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:17,760
really benefited from it so that's that's again another sort of check mark in the Gentoo

194
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:22,260
learning sphere I suppose.

195
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:26,520
What was the progression then into forming elementary because it sounds like you moved

196
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:31,400
from there to Ubuntu because it sounded easier in some ways or had some features that you

197
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:36,360
wanted but how did that evolve for you into making something of your own?

198
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:47,600
Yeah so I think from there I'm not sure how much I was doing like icons and stuff before

199
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:56,240
I switched to Ubuntu I can't really remember but I know that once I got on Ubuntu I think

200
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:03,200
that's when things really kicked off more and I was doing a lot more work with iconography

201
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:13,520
and then I got involved somehow with Gnome Dew and there was another one it was called

202
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:17,640
Gloobus or something like that and it was like a preview app.

203
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:18,640
That's a great name.

204
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:24,720
Yeah it was like there was so much wild stuff happening at that time and so it's just kind

205
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:27,880
of getting involved with different teams that were doing interesting things that were like

206
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:32,680
oh I want that app and then turns out I can talk to the people that are making it and

207
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:35,700
maybe get some things that I want built in there.

208
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:39,040
What a gift of open source right that you could reach out to the people just making

209
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,880
it I think that's really great.

210
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:47,640
Yeah it's such a wild concept and I think what's really cool is that that's still the

211
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:48,640
way it is today.

212
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:54,840
It wasn't like at that time it was kind of this weird pioneer Wild West time I think

213
00:15:54,840 --> 00:16:02,480
compared to now but I think that it's still the case that you can just kind of get involved

214
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:06,520
with stuff and start talking to people who are making things and it's always awesome

215
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:11,800
to see when you're using something like on GitHub nowadays and then the author just like

216
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:15,160
will come in and like leave a comment and be like oh you're having this problem because

217
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:18,760
you did this and if you try this configuration it's like wow that guy made that thing and

218
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:24,180
he took the time to come like comment on my thing like that is so great.

219
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:29,920
And also I think and you will obviously have more personal experience than me on this one

220
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:34,780
but I think that's an essential part of all of this as well there's I would imagine from

221
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:38,800
your perspective some close connection that you get with users that maybe you wouldn't

222
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:44,320
get if you were behind some kind of some kind of wall of you know a developer wall or a

223
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,760
designer wall.

224
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:51,120
Do you appreciate that most days that close connection from the perspective of the person

225
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,120
creating?

226
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:56,720
Yeah absolutely and you know sometimes it's overwhelming because you know there's only

227
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:02,480
one of me and like you're not scalable yeah and it's tough and there's so many people

228
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:08,760
that want really personal help that sometimes I'm just not able to provide but I think that

229
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:16,360
is super important to me to make sure that people know that like if they go through the

230
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:21,480
proper channels that it's not impossible for them to get a hold of someone who's working

231
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:25,840
on that thing and that will talk to them and ask questions and spend time to make sure

232
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:27,440
that they're having a good time.

233
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:34,440
I've had that experience and it's it seems really special when you get that kind of attention

234
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:39,760
so but I distracted you there a little bit because you were talking about sort of your

235
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:46,440
trajectory into elementary and founding elementary and how those ideas started.

236
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:51,360
Let's see so we're picking up with getting involved with some different open source projects

237
00:17:51,360 --> 00:18:00,060
and then I think it was around that time that I had like some kind of ideas about how these

238
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:07,120
things might fit together more and kind of like an idea around how a desktop environment

239
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:12,560
might look and you know it was kind of crazy at the time like I had these like sketches

240
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:19,520
where there was like three docs on each side of the screen and like this one did devices

241
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:23,680
and this one has your favorites and this one's your apps and they're all you know coming

242
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:27,640
in and out of context and then like little other pop-up bubbles and like it was it was

243
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:32,560
complicated but it was just like doing some like real exploration about like if we didn't

244
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:38,560
think about what a desktop environment supposed to look like how would we do it and I was

245
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:44,120
doing tons of mock-ups and looking at different applications and just kind of like trying

246
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:50,840
to throw away all the assumptions and make something different and one that got a lot

247
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:59,520
of attention was I did some design work related to the file browser Nautilus and I think it

248
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:05,940
was OMG Ubuntu who kind of picked it up and talked about it and then a developer reached

249
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:12,240
out to me and was like hey that's really cool let's build that and so we made like this

250
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:19,600
big patch set for Nautilus and we went to go try to push it upstream and like at the

251
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:26,000
time being like a young guy who has no idea how like software development works I was

252
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,680
kind of like I guess put off because they were like no we're not gonna merge that and

253
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:37,920
I was like why what the hell we work so hard and it was you know like ill-considered and

254
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:43,480
the patches were huge and you know it's totally understandable now from the perspective of

255
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:49,320
like an upstream maintainer why like you need to make sure that stuff you're merging in

256
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:54,640
is like good quality and has like a really well considered design direction and it fits

257
00:19:54,640 --> 00:20:02,480
in with the rest of the application and stuff like that but it was kind of like that thing

258
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:10,320
where it was kind of like okay well maybe I don't want to kind of leave it up to someone

259
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:16,400
else if they're gonna merge in that code maybe we should start working on our own stuff and

260
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:23,800
so we kind of built a little community around doing something different and building a different

261
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:31,320
desktop environment and it just kind of took off from there with the applications and the

262
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:36,680
desktop environment and then we went to like okay we have all this stuff and we need a

263
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:43,160
way to present it all together to people because these things are all made to fit together

264
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:49,840
and so doing a distro is kind of the natural progression and not necessarily an easy decision

265
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:57,160
either because there's a lot of well you really got to be committed to make a distribution

266
00:20:57,160 --> 00:21:06,360
last long term and last long term it has right I think you started that back in was it 2007

267
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:12,400
ish around there yeah that's when I started getting involved with like the design stuff

268
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:20,360
and the icons but we didn't do our first OS release for a while I think I think we're

269
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:26,880
coming up on nine years now I think it'll be at the end of this month that's still impressive

270
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:31,520
really when you think about all the work that goes into something like that I think that's

271
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:37,760
worth congratulating and you should have a I suppose virtual party to celebrate thanks

272
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:41,480
yeah I don't you know I don't even know if we were thinking about that at the time I

273
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:46,080
don't know if we thought about like how long it would take to do everything we wanted to

274
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:49,920
do I think we're just kind of like this is we want to build some stuff and then just

275
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:58,600
like kept going but it is one of those things where you see when we first registered the

276
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:03,200
App Center project on Launchpad and then how long it took from when we registered that

277
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:07,920
project to like okay now we've done all these different things and different toolkits have

278
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:13,320
come out we've migrated all our development to GitHub and and it took so long before we

279
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:19,360
actually delivered like the first version of App Center to users and I think that a

280
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:28,320
lot of people maybe don't realize that sometimes it takes years to deliver some of these products

281
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:34,720
oh man yeah but there's and you think this is probably just my assumption but there's

282
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:40,200
far more work that happens sort of on the on the background that nobody ever sees then

283
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:46,520
then what ends up sort of being shown to users right there's a lot of as you mentioned all

284
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:52,560
that setup and ideas and marketing and all this all this stuff on the back end yeah totally

285
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:58,200
and you know that's something we've tried to expose a little bit more in in blog posts

286
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:03,240
when we're doing something that's like I think the last one we did is when we did the new

287
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:11,160
design for the login and lock screen we wrote about because it took us a couple years to

288
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:17,760
finally ship it and so we wrote about like why and like all the different events that

289
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:24,880
we attended like there was a meetup with the gnome design team in London that Cassidy went

290
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:28,240
out to and started talking about all this stuff and then it was like these are all the

291
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:31,800
different branches that we've worked on and like all the different concerns about why

292
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:37,280
we wanted to do the redesign and like this is why it took us two years you know and and

293
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:43,720
this is why this is what we came up with so just kind of giving people a peek into that

294
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:49,720
process yeah is helpful both for users to understand well why does it take so long but

295
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:56,000
also to understand that they should keep sort of being excited about it because there is

296
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:00,920
stuff happening and I think the thing that at least many people appreciate about that

297
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:06,080
approach is that it seems to me like you have a really strong you know you and the team

298
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:10,720
have a really strong philosophy behind what you're doing and you kind of stick to that

299
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:16,880
and make it take as long as it takes to make it right yeah definitely and you know sometimes

300
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:21,480
there there is stuff where we're looking at it and we're going okay like the first idea

301
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:26,240
we had for this is too ambitious and we're gonna have to pivot to something smaller so

302
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:31,200
that we can deliver something sooner and and so that's you know sometimes we do that what's

303
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:36,240
an example maybe of that I would say that like App Center itself is a good example of

304
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:43,800
that because you know from the very inception of the project we had this idea of like and

305
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:49,700
this is not a novel idea at all but of you know we want developers to be able to publish

306
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:55,600
their apps to elementary OS faster than they currently can because right now we're I mean

307
00:24:55,600 --> 00:25:03,840
right now but back then we're waiting you know six months or if we're based on an LTS

308
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:07,600
we're waiting up to two years you know before users can get a new version of an app and

309
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:14,520
that's really not good but the first version of App Center that we shipped it was just

310
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:18,400
the front end it was just the package manager so it didn't have any of that publishing stuff

311
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:26,200
in it and it took us a while and a crowdfunder and a sprint and and all kinds of stuff before

312
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:31,840
we were actually able to ship the publishing back end and so and and I think we're still

313
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:38,520
kind of working towards that goal because it wasn't really until recently where we said

314
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:43,960
okay we're going all in on Flatpak and so even though we have like a publishing back

315
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:51,160
end that functions to really deliver on what we think App Center should be like we had

316
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:56,860
to wait for some new technologies to emerge and mature and and so you know it's always

317
00:25:56,860 --> 00:26:04,400
evolving and and sometimes things take a long time I think it just exposes just how difficult

318
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:10,560
some of these problems were tackling are and maybe difficult is the wrong word but it let

319
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:15,160
you know you mentioned waiting for a technology to come out to make it feel right and to match

320
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:22,720
up with where you were trying to head it seems a wild maybe that's the only way to put it

321
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:28,440
that you know we can have these visions and yet it take lots and lots and lots and lots

322
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:34,880
of effort to get there and years sometimes to see those come to fruition and and yet

323
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:38,960
still be completely worth it I imagine you guys still think it's completely worth it

324
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:44,560
oh yeah totally and you know it's funny I don't mean to talk about App Center so much

325
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:48,320
but it's just something that like it was so it's topical I guess yeah it's so involved

326
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:57,440
in and so complicated but when we were kind of going through working on like the App Store

327
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:01,260
component of it something that people kept bringing up was like well Ubuntu tried this

328
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:04,280
and it didn't work out and like why do you think you could do it you know and Ubuntu

329
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:09,680
couldn't do it and that's something that was totally different though was like the technology

330
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:16,600
landscape was different and when Canonical tried it I don't think products like stripe

331
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:21,720
really existed or certainly not at the scale that they do today so it was like just having

332
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:25,320
like some other company that made a product that allows you to build the thing that you

333
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:31,200
want to build is a completely different game hmm yeah sometimes being too early to the

334
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:36,760
game is a detriment I suppose that's where the luck comes in right coming in at just

335
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:41,440
the right time when the technologies are maybe aligning like stars and making it more possible

336
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:47,000
than it was previously even for for some people that do good work like Canonical sometimes

337
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:52,240
it's just not quite the right time yeah and and then especially in this landscape too

338
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:57,640
where something that I think all of us as far as like people who build desktops are

339
00:27:57,640 --> 00:28:04,000
kind of working towards is like Wayland and just the general theme of like sandboxing

340
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:09,560
and containerization and it's something that's been you know worked towards for years and

341
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:18,480
we get a little bit closer each year and it's it's still far off seeming but it's it's something

342
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:23,520
that if we didn't start and we didn't have the ideas of where this should go and didn't

343
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:27,880
start making that steady progress that you know it's not something that can be shipped

344
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:32,480
right away it's something that where you have to be looking far ahead so how then do you

345
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:37,880
and the team stay motivated long term knowing some of these projects you know just just

346
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:43,040
take a long time I think you gotta bounce around honestly like there are some things

347
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:48,920
where it's like you know okay I'm working on this stuff where it's it's kind of a long

348
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:55,560
game and it's it's not necessarily as exciting and so I gotta have my projects that are like

349
00:28:55,560 --> 00:29:02,560
little wins and so you know I work on those things and then I go okay now I want to work

350
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:08,880
on like a small visual design refresh or maybe some different icons or you know some little

351
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:12,820
things that are kind of exciting and fun or little bite size issues little tweaks here

352
00:29:12,820 --> 00:29:18,640
and there things that I can ship now so that way it's kind of like switching back and forth

353
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:22,000
so I'm not I'm not always just like okay I'm working on this thing and it'll be great five

354
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:26,640
years from now right because you need some immediate wins to keep I guess that energy

355
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:34,920
up and that I don't know to celebrate more often perhaps yeah and I think to keep people

356
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:42,780
engaged too because you know it was something that we ran into I think within the last year

357
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:48,600
where we'd see people on reddit go oh elementary there that's definitely dead there's there's

358
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:52,300
nothing happening over there yeah and and we were like what you know we're working every

359
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:58,600
single day on stuff and then you see like oh okay well it's because we're not shipping

360
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:08,320
that often and so we kind of changed the way our release cycle works and so now we're pushing

361
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:12,860
out little updates to things all throughout the life cycle the operating system instead

362
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:18,720
of just like delivering a product and then waiting two years and delivering another product

363
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:23,780
sounds like a really delicate balance because we were mentioning earlier you know wanting

364
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:29,280
to only send something out there when it's ready and yet I could see why that those little

365
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:34,120
sort of external blips of you know sending stuff out there is helpful how do you kind

366
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:41,000
of match those two that sounds like a challenge yeah I think the kind of way that we've dealt

367
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:47,660
with it is we have things that are like okay we know this is a long-term goal and we know

368
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:52,920
that this is something that we're going to kind of work on with the intention that it's

369
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:58,720
not being shipped this cycle and then we have other things that are like oh you know there's

370
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:04,440
no reason we can't ship this this cycle so it's just kind of like separating the two

371
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:11,680
out and knowing which one a product is it really helps there so same idea like the small

372
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:17,760
wins versus the big wins right yeah but I think a really important part of it is like

373
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:24,520
we were talking about before is kind of tightening the feedback loop from when someone reports

374
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:31,760
an issue or has a feature request and if it's something that doesn't require a whole new

375
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:37,780
technology stack to develop being able to go oh yeah you know we can push that update

376
00:31:37,780 --> 00:31:44,640
out within like a month or whatever is really big and if it's like an issue report and you're

377
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:49,040
able to fix it within like a day or two like people love that and it feels so good to be

378
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:53,240
able to like go man that's so cool that I was able to fix your thing and now you're

379
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:57,560
using it and then you know people are excited about it and like that that just feels really

380
00:31:57,560 --> 00:32:02,840
good to be able to do things really quickly I'm smiling over here and I it wasn't even

381
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:09,480
done to me so I can see why it feels good can you tell me a little bit more about the

382
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:13,560
team that you're working with regularly I mean I mean I know you have Cassidy who's

383
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:18,200
sort of close to you but there's a lot of people in the community that are putting some

384
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:24,000
time into elementary as well what has that been like yeah so you know I'm not sure how

385
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:34,080
much everybody knows but we have a couple people on payroll and we are payrolls kind

386
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:39,640
of gone back and forth we've had some people that were on part-time then moved to doing

387
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:48,640
like contracts and you know contracts come and go and then we've done bug bounties also

388
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:54,560
so it can be kind of hard sometimes to separate as far as like who's being paid for what work

389
00:32:54,560 --> 00:33:06,680
and things like that but I'd say that at any given time there's probably 20 30 active developers

390
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:13,720
in the community doing something we've got some people that are really long time contributors

391
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:21,440
like Jeremy Wooten is our maintainer for files and I think he's like one of the only people

392
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:25,800
that is like a dedicated maintainer for an app right now so it's actually really cool

393
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:31,680
to have like we know that no matter what like Jeremy's gonna keep files going and and so

394
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:39,080
it can it can be really nice to be able to count on that but then we have like Quarantine

395
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:48,880
Noel is one of our longtime desktop developers and he is like all over the place and in a

396
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:57,240
good way like you know you never you never necessarily know what he's working on because

397
00:33:57,240 --> 00:34:01,040
he is always looking at like the next thing and knows like what the new technologies are

398
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:05,280
and stuff so that's really cool because he brings that insight back in and he's really

399
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:10,960
good at working with upstreams and he's actually done a lot of work where it's like okay well

400
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:14,560
in order to have this feature in our app we need to build it in the upstream library so

401
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:18,920
I'm gonna go up there for a couple months and work on it up there and then come back

402
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:23,520
so it's really cool to have people like that in the community that sounds great I would

403
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:28,520
imagine having different types of personalities and different types of expertise and different

404
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:34,160
types of ways that people work if you can manage that can all come around to be really

405
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:40,480
beneficial yeah definitely I think that you know diversity is strength absolutely and

406
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:47,200
trying to make everybody work the same way just wouldn't it wouldn't help so I think

407
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:51,040
it's nice that people are different and they have different ideas and different concerns

408
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:56,800
and I think it really shows in the product when you have people that care about lots

409
00:34:56,800 --> 00:35:04,560
of different things I would imagine too that that can sometimes be challenging to you know

410
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:08,640
I'm just trying to think like you know you let someone go work upstream for a few months

411
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:13,200
and that's just what they want to do and you just have to have faith that they're sort

412
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:19,040
of doing the right thing does that present challenges sometimes I would imagine it does

413
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:26,000
you know I'd say not as often as you'd think I feel like that our community is really good

414
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:33,440
about building consensus and I don't know how many times that we've really had like

415
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:40,200
major conflicts or anything like that in recent history so it seems to be going pretty well

416
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:46,200
and I think that you know everybody communicates really well which is always super important

417
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:50,280
and just making sure that everything's everybody's on the same page about where we want to be

418
00:35:50,280 --> 00:36:00,240
is I think the most helpful thing and having kind of general themes or like I'm sure Cassidy

419
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:07,360
would advocate for you know like personas where you have like okay you know let's make

420
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:13,200
sure that we're keeping in mind how people who interact primarily with the keyboard think

421
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:19,280
of this thing and then let's also make sure we're keeping in mind like how this thing

422
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:25,120
will work when all the applications are in sandbox containers and you know having having

423
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:32,240
kind of these little themes that guide where we go I think helps keep everything cohesive

424
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:36,240
that's a really nice way to think about it and hadn't occurred to me before because we

425
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:44,240
sort of I don't know lean on seeing software in the way that we use it but I've learned

426
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:49,360
that repeatedly by simply you know throwing my laptop in front of someone else and just

427
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:55,480
watching how they do things is always completely different than how I do it so I love that

428
00:36:55,480 --> 00:37:02,400
idea of these profiles and I imagine that could be applied in more than just software

429
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:08,880
as well yeah I think so I imagine that people use that in in lots of everyday scenarios

430
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:15,720
and I think personas is a pretty widely used UX pattern no matter what industry you're

431
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:24,520
in mm-hmm can I ask how I don't know it just seems to me from what I know of the ways that

432
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:29,800
you and the team work and just getting a chance to talk to you guys personally sometimes and

433
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:34,440
hearing you on a variety of podcasts that you just it seems like you bring a lot of

434
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:40,080
heart to what you're doing and a lot of sort of I don't know humanity maybe to it and so

435
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:43,640
it's not it doesn't seem like it's just about the software it seems like it's more about

436
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:51,280
the collaborations and and making people feel good about every step of the way I'm just

437
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:56,920
curious how it seems like a deep part of your person but how do you how have you cultivated

438
00:37:56,920 --> 00:38:02,080
that with others and and I'm sure that gives back to you in many ways yeah I guess I would

439
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:09,320
say that is a big part of kind of the I feel like brand identity such a cold way to describe

440
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:13,520
something where like the goal is you want people to have a good time you know and if

441
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:19,420
if people aren't having a good time then like why are we even doing this and I think that

442
00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:25,480
that's something that you know we we want to be part of like when people interact with

443
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:33,080
our brand accounts that it's this definitely an idea of like okay people are having a good

444
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:37,600
time or they're having a bad time and like how can we make sure that people are having

445
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:45,980
a good time and kind of looking at things that way I think in the way that people feel

446
00:38:45,980 --> 00:38:56,200
about what they're doing helps to make those kind of decisions and leads to another another

447
00:38:56,200 --> 00:39:01,960
little Cassidy thing is he would probably say delightful moments and making sure that

448
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:07,080
things are fun or the things feel good and when you're interacting with them and whether

449
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:13,000
that's through the software or through interacting with another person in the community or through

450
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:19,600
a brand account or an email or whatever just kind of having that idea of people feeling

451
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:26,680
good is is I think important yeah I think you nailed it when you said you know bringing

452
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:32,080
heart to it it's it feels like often in our you know software is an easy place to to be

453
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:37,720
really cerebral but it feels like that the counterbalance of bringing some some heart

454
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:42,700
and some empathy to every single interaction within it I can't can't do anything but be

455
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:50,820
helpful yeah yeah definitely and you know it's it's funny like as much as we like to

456
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:56,920
think that as humans were there were so in like our frontal cortex or whatever you know

457
00:39:56,920 --> 00:40:04,440
like our we're so logical but when it really comes down to it like so much of how we interact

458
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:10,400
with the world is how we feel about it and how we feel can often override like the more

459
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:16,320
logical parts of our brain I would argue that design you know that's the very focus of design

460
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:22,680
is to make people feel good about the things they're interacting with I imagine you agree

461
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:30,440
yeah I would say that that's a big part of it and you can kind of see how if if your

462
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:37,460
design doesn't make people feel good how they'll kind of figure out a way to do what feels

463
00:40:37,460 --> 00:40:42,200
more comfortable or feels better or easier for them and I think there's like that classic

464
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:48,920
example of the photo where there's a walkway and there's some grass next to it and there's

465
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:54,200
a path that people have walked through the grass and just kind of like you know this

466
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:59,560
is your your design versus this is this is what feels natural for the user and where

467
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:06,040
they wanted to go yeah I think they call those desire paths right and I love that term because

468
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:12,240
it sort of shows well this is what people want to do naturally and so if your design

469
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:16,960
is doing something different than that then you're missing the mark yeah and I think that

470
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:23,200
you know Cassidy's been diving into that a lot recently with some user surveys and doing

471
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:32,360
a little bit of research and you know we're looking at especially at how people especially

472
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:37,440
people who are used to the Linux desktop really want to customize things and want to make

473
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:44,280
things feel their own and as software developers that could be really difficult because that

474
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:51,680
introduces some complexity and some kind of randomness or uncertainty into the software

475
00:41:51,680 --> 00:42:02,400
and so we're kind of looking at ways of okay how can we make things feel more belonging

476
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:09,120
to the person who's using the software but in a way that is a little more known ahead

477
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:15,880
of time so that we can kind of build and design around it and so we're looking at things like

478
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:24,520
different colors and making sure that we're really designing around different font sizes

479
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:31,120
and that people really want to do like a dark theme now so we're looking into like okay

480
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:37,360
well how how do we do a dark theme in a way that doesn't really mess with application

481
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:43,160
developers who are wanting to do their own unique visual design identities in their apps

482
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:48,160
and so just kind of thinking through this thing of like what we really don't want is

483
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:51,840
to end up in a situation where we've done nothing to accommodate people who want it

484
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:55,960
to feel their own and so it's the most broken it can possibly be.

485
00:42:55,960 --> 00:43:02,200
Yeah it sounds like a really challenging balance that I would imagine is not you know it's

486
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:06,240
not a certain thing to know where you should land in that balance and I would imagine taking

487
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:13,640
the approach that you are with being careful and yet listening as well is the right one

488
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:17,640
you know to tread lightly but also do things with intention.

489
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:23,600
Yeah you know something that took us I think quite a few years to articulate was when to

490
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:32,440
decide between whether something should be like a user setting or preference or not and

491
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:41,240
the most recent iteration that we've landed on is that if it's something that is a design

492
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:46,600
or engineering decision that we shouldn't leave that up to the people using the software

493
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:51,880
but if it's something that helps make the software more accessible to more people or

494
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:58,920
more palatable to more people then that's something that we want to enable people to

495
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:03,840
make things the way that they need them to be in order to use the software.

496
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:06,400
Those are nice lenses to look through actually.

497
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:10,040
If you wanted to send a question out there to the community something you might like

498
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:15,580
them to think about or something you want them to go see or maybe something to interact

499
00:44:15,580 --> 00:44:18,240
with what would you like to send out there?

500
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:26,040
You know something that that's been a really big topic for us for a really long time is

501
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:33,800
kind of challenging people to financially support open source software and you know

502
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:40,560
it doesn't have to be elementary or elementary OS either like that's not even the thing it's

503
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:47,240
you know if you really benefit from some piece of open source software then try to find a

504
00:44:47,240 --> 00:44:55,920
way to support its development to make sure that its existence is continued and so if

505
00:44:55,920 --> 00:45:00,720
you haven't thought about that before and there's something that you really love you

506
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:05,520
should you know look into that and make sure that that thing continues to exist and continues

507
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:06,740
to get developed.

508
00:45:06,740 --> 00:45:11,980
What does it mean when someone when someone does that like what are the effects that happen

509
00:45:11,980 --> 00:45:13,600
on on your end?

510
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:16,880
What does it enable maybe as a way to look at it?

511
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:24,280
For us you know when people pay for downloads of elementary OS like that becomes my paycheck

512
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:31,520
you know that's how I eat and pay rent and all that stuff so before as we were kind of

513
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:38,920
ramping the company up this was something that I could only work on after I got home

514
00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:44,560
from my day job and if I didn't have any other obligations with family or friends or anything

515
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:52,820
like that and you know I'm fortunate enough that I don't have any like really serious

516
00:45:52,820 --> 00:45:57,360
obligations as far as like family members who are ill or people that I have to support

517
00:45:57,360 --> 00:46:02,180
or anything like that but there are a lot of people out there who do have those obligations

518
00:46:02,180 --> 00:46:06,880
and they would love to work on open source software but they can't do it unless it's

519
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:15,120
a job for them and so making sure that either like organizations who are empowered to do

520
00:46:15,120 --> 00:46:22,160
some hiring or people who are struggling on the weekends to try to turn something from

521
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:27,740
a hobby into a job if we can support those people and empower them to lose the day job

522
00:46:27,740 --> 00:46:34,100
and make their career working on open source software then I think everyone benefits there.

523
00:46:34,100 --> 00:46:39,440
Does it feel like that would make encouraging people to work on open source software not

524
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:47,040
feel so much like a compromise or maybe like you know a side gig like was true for you

525
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:48,040
previously?

526
00:46:48,040 --> 00:46:56,080
Yeah and you know it's definitely so many things change when it goes from just a hobby

527
00:46:56,080 --> 00:47:06,360
to a career path and you know one of those things is like if I wanted to go to a conference

528
00:47:06,360 --> 00:47:15,960
I had to take that week off of work and so that means like do I have enough money to

529
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:19,760
pay my bills if I do that you know?

530
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:29,520
Can I actually do that financially and not only that but okay now if I can do that will

531
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:34,540
the event sponsor me because maybe I don't have enough money to pay for my own travel

532
00:47:34,540 --> 00:47:41,680
to go there and so going from that position as a hobby where it's like maybe I just can't

533
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:49,240
even participate to now I'm in a position where it's like this is my job to participate

534
00:47:49,240 --> 00:47:56,040
and so you know getting together the funds as part of the company budget and I don't

535
00:47:56,040 --> 00:48:02,680
have to worry about taking the time off work and having that ability means that I can go

536
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:08,040
interact with some people that are developing very important technologies and spend that

537
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:15,880
time to bring maybe a different perspective or to take back home a lot of knowledge and

538
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:20,400
it really changes what gets delivered in a really big way.

539
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:30,200
Sounds like a real catalyst to improving well a your you know a developer's well-being to

540
00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:34,040
not have to worry all the time about you know where they're going to spend their time and

541
00:48:34,040 --> 00:48:39,480
the compromises and and you know if they can have food on the table but also in accelerating

542
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:47,520
ideas and integrations and some collaborations and stuff so yeah what a catalyst to doing

543
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:53,520
some amazing things and if it's spread out throughout the users widely then it's it's

544
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:58,880
actually not a big hit for any one of them but yet makes a massive difference on your

545
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:00,280
end I would imagine.

546
00:49:00,280 --> 00:49:08,920
Yeah you know the the very first time that I went to Ubuntu Developer Summit I was in

547
00:49:08,920 --> 00:49:14,960
a position where I wasn't going to be able to go because that means that I would miss

548
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:22,680
a paycheck that means that I wouldn't be able to pay rent and somebody else offered to sponsor

549
00:49:22,680 --> 00:49:30,180
me to be there and he was like how much do you need to to be able to make it and so someone

550
00:49:30,180 --> 00:49:37,320
else's generosity absolutely changed my life because I think that if I wasn't at that conference

551
00:49:37,320 --> 00:49:43,000
then I don't know if I would have ended up actually doing that contract work for canonical

552
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:47,580
and having the opportunity to get more involved with Ubuntu and I think that I wouldn't be

553
00:49:47,580 --> 00:49:53,480
in the same place at all so definitely if you can if you can help somebody else and

554
00:49:53,480 --> 00:49:59,220
it doesn't have to be in such a big way you know that that's obviously a huge help but

555
00:49:59,220 --> 00:50:03,120
like you said if it's spread out between a lot of people and a lot of people do a little

556
00:50:03,120 --> 00:50:05,920
bit then you can absolutely change people's lives.

557
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:12,240
The way I sometimes try to look at it and maybe I'm in a certain position but you know

558
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:18,200
I as a photographer I'm a freelancer and I use 100% open source software for the work

559
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:29,280
that I do so that enables me to make my own living off of how I'm using these tools and

560
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:35,700
so I try to sort of mentally just set aside a little tiny piece of what I'm taking home

561
00:50:35,700 --> 00:50:40,920
to try to give back because without those tools I couldn't do the things I'm doing and

562
00:50:40,920 --> 00:50:46,800
especially not in the ways that I would like to do them so it feels to me like it supports

563
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:52,440
you know the people on the ground who are doing it but it also supports the ideas that

564
00:50:52,440 --> 00:50:57,320
we believe in and the collaborations that we think should happen more in the world so

565
00:50:57,320 --> 00:51:01,840
it feels like a really important thing so if anybody can do it that would be great and

566
00:51:01,840 --> 00:51:08,160
I'll commit actually to giving a little bit this week too before this releases so hopefully

567
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:09,400
someone else can too.

568
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:14,680
Yeah yeah and you know for anybody that thinks that you know oh I'm just one person it's

569
00:51:14,680 --> 00:51:21,560
not that big of a difference I think the last time I checked the stats we're at a little

570
00:51:21,560 --> 00:51:29,880
bit over 1% of the people who download elementary OS choose to pay anything for it so that 1%

571
00:51:29,880 --> 00:51:38,640
of people enables us to deliver it to the other 99% so your small one time contribution

572
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:44,560
is actually huge and it allows a whole lot of people to access open source software that

573
00:51:44,560 --> 00:51:46,600
they never would have been able to before.

574
00:51:46,600 --> 00:51:52,800
The thing that's interesting to me is imagine what could happen with 2% or 5% right what

575
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:54,160
would that change?

576
00:51:54,160 --> 00:52:00,040
Yeah yeah definitely be able to expand our our staff quite a bit yeah and then just some

577
00:52:00,040 --> 00:52:04,640
some great catalyst to some great things so let's let's try to make that happen collectively

578
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:11,360
for all projects really Dan if if you wanted to send people where could they go to get

579
00:52:11,360 --> 00:52:14,960
in touch with you and get connected?

580
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:27,520
You know I think I let my website expire so that's no longer a good way to go but I'm

581
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:32,800
I'm pretty active on Twitter so I think the best way is is to follow me on Twitter I'm

582
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:35,380
at daniel4a on Twitter.

583
00:52:35,380 --> 00:52:39,240
Okay great and we'll see what happens your website maybe I'll nudge you here and there

584
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:47,120
to try to get it back yeah it just proves to me that that you're human which is well

585
00:52:47,120 --> 00:52:51,200
Dan thanks so much for sitting down with me and having a chat I really appreciate it yeah

586
00:52:51,200 --> 00:53:10,240
absolutely thanks for having me on the show.
