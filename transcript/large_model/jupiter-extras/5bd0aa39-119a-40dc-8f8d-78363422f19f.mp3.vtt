00:00.000 --> 00:12.120
Hey, Wes, hello, I thought you know what that's the most ridiculous thing I'd ever heard.

00:12.120 --> 00:13.960
I mean I was bouncing in my seat.

00:13.960 --> 00:15.340
It's got a great name name too.

00:15.340 --> 00:17.680
It's called the eff up theme.

00:17.680 --> 00:18.680
You know, the eff up theme.

00:18.680 --> 00:19.680
Let's see.

00:19.680 --> 00:20.680
It describes what we're doing here.

00:20.680 --> 00:21.680
Yeah.

00:21.680 --> 00:23.360
So we thought, let's get meta for a little bit.

00:23.360 --> 00:26.300
And I would do a little Wes and Chris reacts.

00:26.300 --> 00:27.740
This is something the YouTubers do.

00:27.740 --> 00:29.280
Now we're bringing it to the podcast medium.

00:29.280 --> 00:31.480
Well, what are we reacting to ourselves?

00:31.480 --> 00:34.480
This is that's the thing, you know, like old clips of yourself and stuff.

00:34.480 --> 00:35.480
But I hate me.

00:35.480 --> 00:36.480
Oh, my God.

00:36.480 --> 00:37.480
Oh, my God.

00:37.480 --> 00:38.600
You should hear old me.

00:38.600 --> 00:40.680
It's so bad.

00:40.680 --> 00:42.360
So bad.

00:42.360 --> 00:45.600
So I thought I thought we kick it off with like a really bad one of me.

00:45.600 --> 00:49.320
So we go back in time to episode 100 of Linux Unplugged.

00:49.320 --> 00:50.440
Far back.

00:50.440 --> 00:51.440
Your first episode.

00:51.440 --> 00:53.360
What is this like 2015?

00:53.360 --> 00:58.480
Episode 100 right on the number like you just that's a pretty I mean, of course, it was

00:58.480 --> 01:01.240
because of a special event that you were there.

01:01.240 --> 01:02.240
That's pretty cool.

01:02.240 --> 01:03.240
Anyways.

01:03.240 --> 01:05.760
But this is me.

01:05.760 --> 01:08.760
This is me back then doing the introduction.

01:08.760 --> 01:11.600
You know, for episode 100, I wanted to do a meetup, but we have so much going on.

01:11.600 --> 01:14.680
We've just done a bunch of meetups and we have a couple of coming up kind of didn't

01:14.680 --> 01:16.040
really fit in the schedule.

01:16.040 --> 01:18.560
So why not just have people over to the studio and do a little cookout?

01:18.560 --> 01:21.480
We had six people RSVP and we had a pool going.

01:21.480 --> 01:22.480
I said three would show up.

01:22.480 --> 01:24.020
I nailed it.

01:24.020 --> 01:25.020
That wasn't sped up.

01:25.020 --> 01:27.160
That was going to be my question.

01:27.160 --> 01:28.720
No, it wasn't.

01:28.720 --> 01:31.960
You can tell because it's it's like a little brighter.

01:31.960 --> 01:36.560
You've got a you've got this weird eagerness sort of going forward.

01:36.560 --> 01:39.520
I was young, foolish.

01:39.520 --> 01:42.840
We were having like a big day.

01:42.840 --> 01:43.840
That was episode 100.

01:43.840 --> 01:49.640
Yeah, we were doing the old barbecue for what started as like a just sort of a spinoff from

01:49.640 --> 01:50.640
last.

01:50.640 --> 01:51.640
Yeah.

01:51.640 --> 01:52.640
Yeah.

01:52.640 --> 01:56.900
In episode 99, which would only have been one week before I said anybody in the Pacific

01:56.900 --> 02:03.480
Northwest that wants to come up and do a barbecue for episode 100, come on up.

02:03.480 --> 02:08.900
And in the back of my mind, I was thinking this would be a great way to find a new co-host

02:08.900 --> 02:09.900
for the show.

02:09.900 --> 02:11.560
Like, wouldn't that just work out great?

02:11.560 --> 02:16.360
And I thought, yeah, no, no, that's probably crazy.

02:16.360 --> 02:17.360
So we eat.

02:17.360 --> 02:19.440
Do you remember what you brought something good?

02:19.440 --> 02:20.720
Can't remember now.

02:20.720 --> 02:21.720
I don't know what I brought.

02:21.720 --> 02:22.720
I know.

02:22.720 --> 02:24.240
I mean, I know I brought beer.

02:24.240 --> 02:25.240
Yeah.

02:25.240 --> 02:29.800
You might have bought, you may have been beer brats too.

02:29.800 --> 02:31.160
That would be my style.

02:31.160 --> 02:32.160
Yeah.

02:32.160 --> 02:33.160
Something that stuck out.

02:33.160 --> 02:38.520
And so then after we ate, we all came into the studio and we did a show and it was pretty

02:38.520 --> 02:45.800
clear like right there with no prep, you were sort of like a natch co-host, check out, like

02:45.800 --> 02:48.240
we're just sitting here shucking and jiving and you jump right in.

02:48.240 --> 02:51.520
I think that's one of the best things about Unplugged is you can connect developers with

02:51.520 --> 02:53.160
the people who are actually using them.

02:53.160 --> 02:54.160
Yeah.

02:54.160 --> 02:55.160
They come into the room.

02:55.160 --> 02:56.160
Yeah.

02:56.160 --> 02:57.160
Right there.

02:57.160 --> 02:58.160
Look at me go.

02:58.160 --> 02:59.160
Right on point.

02:59.160 --> 03:00.160
Your first time on air.

03:00.160 --> 03:02.480
Like we had almost planned like that kind of thing.

03:02.480 --> 03:03.880
Had you done a podcast before?

03:03.880 --> 03:04.880
I had not.

03:04.880 --> 03:05.880
Really?

03:05.880 --> 03:06.880
No.

03:06.880 --> 03:10.160
Well, you were quick on your feet.

03:10.160 --> 03:11.160
Man.

03:11.160 --> 03:12.160
So, okay.

03:12.160 --> 03:17.440
So that was for episode 100 and we just finished recording.

03:17.440 --> 03:18.440
314.

03:18.440 --> 03:19.440
Yeah.

03:19.440 --> 03:20.440
314.

03:20.440 --> 03:21.440
Wow.

03:21.440 --> 03:22.440
Yeah.

03:22.440 --> 03:23.440
I did some digging around.

03:23.440 --> 03:29.000
There's like a big change from like from about 100 to 200.

03:29.000 --> 03:31.800
I mean, I much prefer the way it sounds now.

03:31.800 --> 03:33.840
We've changed quite a bit there.

03:33.840 --> 03:35.160
It's come a long way.

03:35.160 --> 03:36.400
So why don't we go back in time?

03:36.400 --> 03:37.880
So that was a couple of clips I pulled.

03:37.880 --> 03:42.660
You pulled a couple of clips and I don't know exactly what this one's about.

03:42.660 --> 03:45.720
It just says Gnome crashes and we are back.

03:45.720 --> 03:47.100
So Gnome just crashed on us.

03:47.100 --> 03:48.100
That's kind of ironic.

03:48.100 --> 03:49.100
I'm not joking.

03:49.100 --> 03:51.520
Summary of the show, folks.

03:51.520 --> 03:53.360
This is a bit of an awkward thing for me right now.

03:53.360 --> 03:56.580
This is my love song to Gnome because I think it's such a great desktop and I think it has

03:56.580 --> 04:00.400
such a strong future and yet I think I'm switching away.

04:00.400 --> 04:01.400
And I'm going to be talking about that more.

04:01.400 --> 04:05.020
But I just I want to continue being positive about Gnome, but I do have to acknowledge

04:05.020 --> 04:09.720
that we just had to stop broadcast and we had to stop and re-edit here and all of that

04:09.720 --> 04:11.240
because Gnome crashed on us again.

04:11.240 --> 04:12.240
Oh, man.

04:12.240 --> 04:16.760
I know that what I'm really struggling with is I am very upset, but I also am trying to

04:16.760 --> 04:19.720
be more positive because I know people work really hard on this.

04:19.720 --> 04:22.060
And the rest of the show, you're like, oh, man, it's getting there.

04:22.060 --> 04:23.200
It's really come a long way.

04:23.200 --> 04:24.200
Yeah.

04:24.200 --> 04:29.760
And I'm trying to be positive because my new outlook on this kind of thing is it just doesn't

04:29.760 --> 04:32.240
work for me, but it could be great for other people.

04:32.240 --> 04:33.240
That's my outlook now.

04:33.240 --> 04:34.240
It's a very accepting view.

04:34.240 --> 04:37.480
And so here I am in the middle of a crash during a live show.

04:37.480 --> 04:41.840
And what used to happen back then, and it's the most awkward thing for me, it's the thing

04:41.840 --> 04:47.960
I hate the most, is when Gnome Shell would go, it would take out Pulse Audio, which would

04:47.960 --> 04:49.880
leave dead air on the stream.

04:49.880 --> 04:50.880
Just nothing.

04:50.880 --> 04:54.200
Even for like 30 to 40 seconds, it's just dead air.

04:54.200 --> 04:58.440
Or sometimes we'd switch to Barry White mode where it would shift us and we'd be in the

04:58.440 --> 05:01.660
wrong phase.

05:01.660 --> 05:04.420
And for me as a broadcaster doing a live event, like...

05:04.420 --> 05:06.040
That's the whole thing you're focusing on.

05:06.040 --> 05:10.280
It's just like the Achilles heel of a crash.

05:10.280 --> 05:11.640
And nothing you did, right?

05:11.640 --> 05:13.400
You set it all up perfectly.

05:13.400 --> 05:14.400
It was rough.

05:14.400 --> 05:17.720
And I was trying in this moment to stay very positive.

05:17.720 --> 05:21.000
So we are going down a path, but...

05:21.000 --> 05:22.240
And this is a system, by the way.

05:22.240 --> 05:27.040
The one that crashes the most is the system with almost no extensions.

05:27.040 --> 05:28.040
Just for the record.

05:28.040 --> 05:32.400
The only extension it has is Dash to Dock and the ping extension.

05:32.400 --> 05:33.400
Yikes.

05:33.400 --> 05:34.880
There you have it.

05:34.880 --> 05:35.880
Yeah.

05:35.880 --> 05:36.880
Yeah.

05:36.880 --> 05:37.880
It's good times.

05:37.880 --> 05:38.880
It's good times.

05:38.880 --> 05:41.680
Do any other machines suffer from this in the studio?

05:41.680 --> 05:46.280
We have three Gnome desktops that crash every day.

05:46.280 --> 05:52.120
They're all similar hardware, NVIDIA, Arch, Core i7, like a generation ago.

05:52.120 --> 05:53.120
Yeah.

05:53.120 --> 05:54.120
It's happening quite a bit.

05:54.120 --> 05:55.120
That's kind of...

05:55.120 --> 05:56.120
Wow.

05:56.120 --> 05:57.120
I had forgotten how bad it got.

05:57.120 --> 05:59.120
Oh, it was pretty bad towards the end.

05:59.120 --> 06:01.760
Now, we have some issues right now.

06:01.760 --> 06:04.440
So I thought it would just be interesting to sort of reflect on where we've been and

06:04.440 --> 06:05.440
where we're going.

06:05.440 --> 06:07.960
Boy, I'd say the issues we have now pale in comparison to that.

06:07.960 --> 06:09.260
It's so much more stable.

06:09.260 --> 06:15.640
And so these systems have been installed for a year and a half.

06:15.640 --> 06:22.560
And the main issue we're really having probably results from switching from Plasma.

06:22.560 --> 06:27.560
We jumped on the recording computer from Plasma to XFCE because we were having video artifact

06:27.560 --> 06:32.160
issues that we thought might have just been a combination of NVIDIA Driver and Kaywin

06:32.160 --> 06:34.680
or something.

06:34.680 --> 06:39.320
However, weird video artifact issues have continued even on...

06:39.320 --> 06:40.320
They remain.

06:40.320 --> 06:41.320
Yeah.

06:41.320 --> 06:44.400
So we think it's just time to do a reload and re-swap a video card out and just do a

06:44.400 --> 06:47.120
general work.

06:47.120 --> 06:52.000
But this system, actually, like the OBS machine, which was the one that was crashing, which

06:52.000 --> 06:53.000
is not...

06:53.000 --> 06:57.400
We're not really having problems with it as long as we restart about once a week.

06:57.400 --> 07:00.840
Once we started using Jack, we had to restart once a week.

07:00.840 --> 07:01.840
But that's acceptable.

07:01.840 --> 07:03.240
We do some security updates.

07:03.240 --> 07:04.240
We reboot.

07:04.240 --> 07:05.280
Otherwise, you're right.

07:05.280 --> 07:06.280
It just works.

07:06.280 --> 07:08.120
You kind of set it, forget it, which is exactly how I want it.

07:08.120 --> 07:10.240
That's acceptable to me.

07:10.240 --> 07:11.240
You're right, though.

07:11.240 --> 07:12.640
I had forgot about that.

07:12.640 --> 07:15.020
Do you remember...

07:15.020 --> 07:20.320
We've had a conversation in a couple of forums over the years, but do you remember the conversation

07:20.320 --> 07:23.480
around submitting bugs when you're doing testing and all of that?

07:23.480 --> 07:25.480
That's something we've talked about, like when we're reviewing a distro.

07:25.480 --> 07:27.240
I mean, we all love to complain, right?

07:27.240 --> 07:31.600
But we don't all often submit bugs about things we're complaining about.

07:31.600 --> 07:35.120
Going back to Poby's argument about filing a bug, this is not one, I think...

07:35.120 --> 07:37.980
And I don't know, maybe it's my bias.

07:37.980 --> 07:39.300
I've been around for a while.

07:39.300 --> 07:43.680
This is not one I think is worth my time, because it's...

07:43.680 --> 07:44.680
Yeah.

07:44.680 --> 07:48.240
That's what I heard for six months from the people complaining about wireless on 1604.

07:48.240 --> 07:49.560
I disagree with that.

07:49.560 --> 07:54.480
I didn't actually have that problem, but that would have been one that would have been.

07:54.480 --> 07:56.320
But that's exactly the problem.

07:56.320 --> 07:57.320
Not everyone had this problem.

07:57.320 --> 08:02.960
There were people very close to you ranting about how wireless on 1604 was completely

08:02.960 --> 08:05.120
busted and everyone should avoid it on 2604.

08:05.120 --> 08:07.800
It turns out, no, it's not busted for everyone.

08:07.800 --> 08:10.000
It's not busted for anyone in Canonical.

08:10.000 --> 08:13.320
It's only busted for certain select people with certain chipsets in certain environments.

08:13.320 --> 08:14.320
That's crazy.

08:14.320 --> 08:17.480
Those f**kers wouldn't tell us what the details of that system was.

08:17.480 --> 08:19.720
If you don't tell us, we can't f**king fix it.

08:19.720 --> 08:21.040
I think this is a real problem.

08:21.040 --> 08:25.160
I think the core problem that that issue...

08:25.160 --> 08:27.800
The thing is, is I'm not going to spend my time.

08:27.800 --> 08:28.800
I'm not going to spend...

08:28.800 --> 08:29.800
I'm not going to...

08:29.800 --> 08:33.560
Like I said, if I'm working 65 hours this week, I'm not going to work 67 hours so that

08:33.560 --> 08:37.200
way I can report a bug and then watch them tell me it's an Nvidia problem.

08:37.200 --> 08:44.800
I think the thing that I would articulate or attempt to articulate now that I wasn't

08:44.800 --> 08:49.000
because I was so surprised by how fired up Popey got that I wasn't really articulating

08:49.000 --> 08:51.680
very well is the core...

08:51.680 --> 08:57.520
I was trying to play the part of this is how people feel.

08:57.520 --> 08:58.520
We're not...

08:58.520 --> 09:03.160
I, Chris, am not going to file a bug, but people who are working 65 hours a week aren't

09:03.160 --> 09:08.520
going to work an extra two hours for Canonical, who maybe they barely even like to begin with,

09:08.520 --> 09:12.560
to help out with something like this that should be caught in basic Q&A.

09:12.560 --> 09:18.240
I wasn't trying to say I don't ever want to submit bugs, but I was just trying to...

09:18.240 --> 09:23.080
I guess I was trying to have a conversation around, how do you solve that problem?

09:23.080 --> 09:24.080
Because...

09:24.080 --> 09:25.680
You're not arguing for that position.

09:25.680 --> 09:26.680
It just...

09:26.680 --> 09:27.680
It's a human problem.

09:27.680 --> 09:28.680
It's how people feel.

09:28.680 --> 09:29.680
Yeah, exactly.

09:29.680 --> 09:33.280
I don't think I did a very good job there listening back to that.

09:33.280 --> 09:35.000
And I don't know that too much has changed, right?

09:35.000 --> 09:37.480
I mean, maybe it's a little easier.

09:37.480 --> 09:42.400
GitHub is popular, PRs are okay, but it's still a lot of hoops.

09:42.400 --> 09:44.680
I think we as a team are...

09:44.680 --> 09:51.880
We participate more in funding open source projects, bug tracking, issues that...

09:51.880 --> 09:57.140
Or we'll follow issues on GitHubs for projects that we are using actively in production.

09:57.140 --> 10:03.900
So we have improved our skills there, mostly because we now have a team that has a culture

10:03.900 --> 10:04.900
of doing it.

10:04.900 --> 10:12.040
But I think if you don't have that, and you don't have a strong motivator to improve Canonical's

10:12.040 --> 10:15.040
product, you're not likely to do it.

10:15.040 --> 10:16.040
You're right.

10:16.040 --> 10:17.040
I don't think it's changed.

10:17.040 --> 10:18.040
Well, it's a culture issue.

10:18.040 --> 10:19.040
You're right.

10:19.040 --> 10:20.320
I mean, that's exactly it.

10:20.320 --> 10:24.720
I think the only way you could change it would be, I don't know, a lot of evangelism and

10:24.720 --> 10:26.800
tooling to make it as easy as possible.

10:26.800 --> 10:28.040
So, you're right.

10:28.040 --> 10:33.160
We are on the precipice tomorrow, we're reloading the studio machines.

10:33.160 --> 10:41.480
But one machine stands alone now in the studio, and that's Westpain's ThinkPad.

10:41.480 --> 10:42.480
So let's...

10:42.480 --> 10:43.480
One more Plasma thing.

10:43.480 --> 10:46.400
And I wanted to pick up from where we left off last week with you.

10:46.400 --> 10:50.360
So during the show last week, you switched over to the Plasma desktop for a little bit.

10:50.360 --> 10:51.360
Oh, that's right.

10:51.360 --> 10:57.680
I also got the state of Plasma that was posted at Netrunner-Mag.com, which we'll have linked

10:57.680 --> 10:59.260
in the show notes.

10:59.260 --> 11:06.120
So I kind of wanted to go over your experience, cover his experience, because I've been so

11:06.120 --> 11:13.320
impressed with the Plasma desktop, specifically 5.9, that I've had a hard time articulating

11:13.320 --> 11:14.800
what's wrong with it.

11:14.800 --> 11:16.240
People said, so what's not working still?

11:16.240 --> 11:21.080
And I'm having a hard time articulating it because I'm not like in review mode, I'm just

11:21.080 --> 11:23.600
like in use mode, I'm just like geek out mode.

11:23.600 --> 11:27.400
And so I haven't really had to turn on that part of my brain until I started really getting

11:27.400 --> 11:28.760
this question more and more.

11:28.760 --> 11:32.520
And so now I've slipped into more review mode of the Plasma desktop, and so I've got some

11:32.520 --> 11:35.620
observations of things that I think should be improved.

11:35.620 --> 11:37.280
But they're still not major things.

11:37.280 --> 11:40.560
And so I'm curious to hear what your experience has been so far.

11:40.560 --> 11:41.880
I've been pretty impressed.

11:41.880 --> 11:48.520
I think it's been a year or two since I really had like Plasma KD anything as my main desktop.

11:48.520 --> 11:53.000
Some things I like, like I already use Quossel and other cute applications, so it was nice

11:53.000 --> 11:56.160
to kind of have that be my native environment.

11:56.160 --> 12:01.160
But I have been approaching it very much like what you said, just install and the defaults

12:01.160 --> 12:02.160
work.

12:02.160 --> 12:04.160
I was kind of interested in exploring with that, because that's really what I do a lot

12:04.160 --> 12:08.800
of the time with GNOME, at least on like this laptop, which we refresh for the show a lot,

12:08.800 --> 12:10.740
that kind of thing.

12:10.740 --> 12:14.000
So I really just kind of installed KD or Plasma, started working with it.

12:14.000 --> 12:18.720
It took me a while to get used to some of the trivial things, just like the mouse cursor

12:18.720 --> 12:22.140
is a little bit different, plus some of the applications I use, like I have a lot of like

12:22.140 --> 12:27.120
Telegram or Slack, they didn't integrate quite as nicely or look quite as nice with just

12:27.120 --> 12:30.200
the default theme as I found that they did with GNOME.

12:30.200 --> 12:32.100
But I have not customized that much.

12:32.100 --> 12:33.800
So I'm kind of interested to hear.

12:33.800 --> 12:38.760
So another part that I like, I've been using Unity at work, mostly just because I got my

12:38.760 --> 12:40.600
desktop refreshed there.

12:40.600 --> 12:44.080
Not taking the time to customize that either, because, you know, get work done.

12:44.080 --> 12:46.680
But I have been thinking about either installing GNOME or Plasma.

12:46.680 --> 12:48.320
So now Plasma is on the list.

12:48.320 --> 12:53.340
But like one of the things I think Unity does well is imitate a tiling desktop or give me

12:53.340 --> 12:54.340
some of those features.

12:54.340 --> 12:59.160
A lot of times really what I want, and Cinnamon does this well, is just like quadrants, even

12:59.160 --> 13:01.440
just splitting half their screens, but especially quadrants.

13:01.440 --> 13:03.720
So now you're still on Plasma.

13:03.720 --> 13:05.360
That was back in 2017.

13:05.360 --> 13:06.360
Oh, boy.

13:06.360 --> 13:09.920
Could you pull up like something there to tell you what version of Plasma you're on?

13:09.920 --> 13:12.240
There's probably something in the system preferences.

13:12.240 --> 13:13.240
So you're still on it.

13:13.240 --> 13:14.240
You really stuck with it.

13:14.240 --> 13:17.900
KDE Neon 5.16 at the moment.

13:17.900 --> 13:20.220
Does that happen to say which version of Plasma desktop?

13:20.220 --> 13:21.960
Because you were in that clip, it was 5.9.

13:21.960 --> 13:23.440
Yeah, that's the same.

13:23.440 --> 13:25.560
KDE Plasma version 5.16.4.

13:25.560 --> 13:26.560
Hmm.

13:26.560 --> 13:27.560
So 2017.

13:27.560 --> 13:28.560
Wow.

13:28.560 --> 13:35.340
That's like, you're like, that's the longest running, nobody else has been stuck to one

13:35.340 --> 13:36.340
desktop that long.

13:36.340 --> 13:38.840
Well, so it wasn't that long.

13:38.840 --> 13:41.760
There was a long known period in between, I have to admit.

13:41.760 --> 13:45.800
So that's what's funny about this, because this was kind of the, I said it had been like

13:45.800 --> 13:50.720
one or two years, but that was just like trying a desktop that came with KDE as part of an

13:50.720 --> 13:52.760
other OS review.

13:52.760 --> 13:56.920
That is kind of the first time I did like a real, I'm going to use Plasma for a while,

13:56.920 --> 13:59.540
at least the modern version of Plasma.

13:59.540 --> 14:04.240
But it still feels just shallow in comparison to what I've been doing now.

14:04.240 --> 14:11.200
So I feel like change is in the wind, you guys, you're just selling me on Fedora on

14:11.200 --> 14:12.940
this ThinkPad.

14:12.940 --> 14:16.680
And you're right, like I have an ancient kernel, we've been playing with Jack, like I'm not

14:16.680 --> 14:20.800
too worried about compatibility issues.

14:20.800 --> 14:26.300
So I'm loving Plasma, I still don't know that I take full advantage of the configurability.

14:26.300 --> 14:30.320
And honestly, part of the reason it's lasted so well, and like, I don't have the same complaints

14:30.320 --> 14:33.560
is because you tuned this for me when it got set up.

14:33.560 --> 14:37.360
So it's not really the defaults.

14:37.360 --> 14:40.880
Have you ever experimented with the tiling or the quadrant stuff?

14:40.880 --> 14:43.120
Yeah, a little bit.

14:43.120 --> 14:44.600
Kwin's great.

14:44.600 --> 14:48.560
I could probably be doing a better job of taking advantage of it.

14:48.560 --> 14:50.560
Yeah, Kwin is really great.

14:50.560 --> 14:51.760
I mean, you do have wobbly windows.

14:51.760 --> 14:56.040
I have wobbly windows and exploding windows are still in effect.

14:56.040 --> 14:57.040
Yeah.

14:57.040 --> 15:01.640
I mean, you just do this and you go, yeah, no, I totally understand.

15:01.640 --> 15:06.440
I'm just looking over here at my Xfce desktop going, is it worth trying to retrofit this

15:06.440 --> 15:07.440
thing with Compass?

15:07.440 --> 15:08.440
No, no, leave it alone.

15:08.440 --> 15:09.440
Leave it alone.

15:09.440 --> 15:10.440
We don't need Compass.

15:10.440 --> 15:13.920
I mean, unless Compass fixes our weird glitches, then okay.

15:13.920 --> 15:14.920
No, you're right.

15:14.920 --> 15:15.920
We don't.

15:15.920 --> 15:17.440
It's just, wouldn't it be cool if the windows exploded?

15:17.440 --> 15:18.880
It would be cool.

15:18.880 --> 15:20.040
So one extra clip.

15:20.040 --> 15:25.700
This isn't Linux Unplugged, but Wes and I, back in the day, did TextMap together.

15:25.700 --> 15:30.400
And this is funny because it's a story arc that we did complete on Linux Unplugged later

15:30.400 --> 15:31.400
on.

15:31.400 --> 15:35.600
And we ended up replacing this install.

15:35.600 --> 15:41.480
But we did it initially on the TextNet program and then finished the job by replacing it

15:41.480 --> 15:42.760
with Fedora later on.

15:42.760 --> 15:45.920
On Linux Unplugged, amazing.

15:45.920 --> 15:50.240
After a few years of basically working seven days a week, the Jupyter Broadcasting Studio

15:50.240 --> 15:53.480
has accumulated a bit of technical debt here and there.

15:53.480 --> 15:56.760
And we've been kind of going through and cleaning it up, trying to address it.

15:56.760 --> 15:59.280
But there's one that we've been putting off because it's just worked.

15:59.280 --> 16:00.800
If it ain't broke, don't fix it.

16:00.800 --> 16:01.800
It's always the same.

16:01.800 --> 16:03.720
And this thing is essentially not broke.

16:03.720 --> 16:07.080
But the reality is we have a very old FreeNAS mini.

16:07.080 --> 16:10.000
When IX first started selling the product, I bought one.

16:10.000 --> 16:14.440
And it's even running, or it was running, a beta version of FreeNAS.

16:14.440 --> 16:17.720
And we just went to the races and never really went back and addressed it.

16:17.720 --> 16:19.320
It's been in production all these years.

16:19.320 --> 16:20.320
Yeah.

16:20.320 --> 16:25.600
And really, it's one of those things that once it's in production, you have a hard time

16:25.600 --> 16:31.240
stopping everything and taking this thing offline and interrupting everybody's workflow

16:31.240 --> 16:32.240
and upgrading.

16:32.240 --> 16:33.240
Right.

16:33.240 --> 16:36.920
It's pretty essential to the day-to-day operations of, you can't put shows out.

16:36.920 --> 16:37.920
We can't do anything.

16:37.920 --> 16:38.920
No.

16:38.920 --> 16:39.920
So it's kind of a key thing.

16:39.920 --> 16:45.160
And the other issue is that it's growing so rapidly that we're having a hard time backing

16:45.160 --> 16:48.160
it up because you can't really back it up online because we need the connection for

16:48.160 --> 16:49.160
other things.

16:49.160 --> 16:51.520
And it would just dominate our connection constantly.

16:51.520 --> 16:55.240
And I haven't gotten, Dan almost convinced me, but I haven't yet gotten like a tape system,

16:55.240 --> 16:56.960
which is kind of where I'm actually going with it.

16:56.960 --> 16:57.960
Okay.

16:57.960 --> 17:00.720
Before we get to the backup thing, I said something in that clip that I wanted to follow

17:00.720 --> 17:04.280
up with you now that we have our new system, which is based on Fedora.

17:04.280 --> 17:07.040
Everything's in containers, ZFS for the storage.

17:07.040 --> 17:10.320
The one thing I said in there is you really don't want to have to take this thing down

17:10.320 --> 17:13.360
for a long period of time and interrupt everybody's workflow.

17:13.360 --> 17:18.120
And now the team more than ever is going to rely on services on these things, especially

17:18.120 --> 17:19.120
the ones...

17:19.120 --> 17:20.120
Ain't that true?

17:20.120 --> 17:23.600
Do you feel like we solved that problem?

17:23.600 --> 17:28.120
Maybe not completely, but I think we're a lot closer, if only because we understand

17:28.120 --> 17:30.400
the system a lot better.

17:30.400 --> 17:35.340
One thing that we definitely are doing differently is we won't be taking the Nextcloud system

17:35.340 --> 17:40.080
down to upgrade the storage ever in its current configuration.

17:40.080 --> 17:42.040
So in the past, we'd have limited sets of disks.

17:42.040 --> 17:43.040
Yeah.

17:43.040 --> 17:44.520
We have a lot more expandability.

17:44.520 --> 17:47.080
We'd have to swap in a drive like animal.

17:47.080 --> 17:48.600
We wanted new storage.

17:48.600 --> 17:54.560
But this time around with our Team Nextcloud instance, we decided to use DigitalOcean Spaces

17:54.560 --> 17:56.460
as the backend.

17:56.460 --> 17:58.160
So in theory, it'll just grow...

17:58.160 --> 18:02.120
Well, in theory, it grew 50 gigs in usage yesterday.

18:02.120 --> 18:03.120
I guess I'll go check.

18:03.120 --> 18:04.120
That would be interesting.

18:04.120 --> 18:05.240
Now, it hasn't been super...

18:05.240 --> 18:09.520
It's not completely smooth, I'll admit, but that's a huge advantage.

18:09.520 --> 18:10.520
Yeah.

18:10.520 --> 18:15.080
I mean, yeah, I guess it hasn't been super smooth, but it seems like the goal...

18:15.080 --> 18:16.080
Actually, no.

18:16.080 --> 18:17.080
I'm wrong.

18:17.080 --> 18:18.080
It's been very smooth.

18:18.080 --> 18:19.080
It's been a few...

18:19.080 --> 18:20.080
Small things.

18:20.080 --> 18:21.080
Yeah.

18:21.080 --> 18:26.400
And the goal, theoretically, not having to swap in new disks every time we have like

18:26.400 --> 18:29.920
a new project that we take on, boy, that could be a game changer.

18:29.920 --> 18:31.600
You just don't have to care what anyone else does.

18:31.600 --> 18:36.600
And then because the applications are all in containers, it does really reduce the downtime

18:36.600 --> 18:41.320
of the application services because we're upgrading the OS, but the containers remain

18:41.320 --> 18:42.320
up.

18:42.320 --> 18:45.120
And when we upgrade the containers, we generally...

18:45.120 --> 18:47.160
It's just a quick take them down.

18:47.160 --> 18:49.600
Pull and stop and start the new one.

18:49.600 --> 18:50.600
Yeah.

18:50.600 --> 18:51.600
Should we continue?

18:51.600 --> 18:52.600
Yes.

18:52.600 --> 18:56.120
We need the connection for other things and it would just dominate our connection constantly.

18:56.120 --> 18:57.120
And I haven't gotten...

18:57.120 --> 19:00.400
Dan almost convinced me, but I haven't yet gotten like a tape system, which is kind of

19:00.400 --> 19:01.400
where I'm actually going with this.

19:01.400 --> 19:02.400
Oh, yeah.

19:02.400 --> 19:03.400
But I haven't gotten there yet.

19:03.400 --> 19:07.200
If I could find a good deal on eBay, I might get a tape system for it though.

19:07.200 --> 19:08.400
But I haven't yet.

19:08.400 --> 19:13.640
And so it's in production, we're using it seven days a week, and I don't have the best

19:13.640 --> 19:14.640
backup.

19:14.640 --> 19:17.360
It's not paid, but I'm working on that.

19:17.360 --> 19:20.560
So it's time for some tender loving care.

19:20.560 --> 19:24.640
We decided we needed to get this thing upgraded because the next step we have to do is address

19:24.640 --> 19:29.440
our storage, get our pool back in the right shape, and get backups working.

19:29.440 --> 19:32.440
We're going through the dependency tree to get this thing to a state where it needs to

19:32.440 --> 19:36.320
be a reliable piece of enterprise equipment again, and digging it out of its hole.

19:36.320 --> 19:41.000
And step one is getting it off of a beta release of FreeNAS, so that way we could get it on

19:41.000 --> 19:46.360
a supported version of FreeNAS that was getting maintenance, that had full features, and then

19:46.360 --> 19:49.000
we use that to readdress the storage.

19:49.000 --> 19:51.240
But in the meantime, we got to get there and we thought, well, how would the audience do

19:51.240 --> 19:52.240
it?

19:52.240 --> 19:53.240
Would they make a leap?

19:53.240 --> 19:54.640
Would they try to upgrade in between?

19:54.640 --> 19:55.640
What would you do?

19:55.640 --> 19:59.400
And so what we thought is, let's go out there, we'll go out into the Jupyter Broadcasting

19:59.400 --> 20:04.160
Data Center, aka our garage, and we'll just record the whole process and share with you

20:04.160 --> 20:14.920
how it went, so you can learn from our mistakes, or potentially our victory.

20:14.920 --> 20:16.840
So we've been looking at this, we have two options.

20:16.840 --> 20:23.480
We can either go straight to FreeNAS 11, or we can go to 9.3 and then try to go from 9.3

20:23.480 --> 20:24.480
to 11.

20:24.480 --> 20:25.480
What version are we on now?

20:25.480 --> 20:26.480
9.1.

20:26.480 --> 20:27.480
Okay.

20:27.480 --> 20:28.480
Beta.

20:28.480 --> 20:29.480
Right.

20:29.480 --> 20:31.320
And so we thought the audience would be most likely to do the graphical update options,

20:31.320 --> 20:32.320
so we're going to try that.

20:32.320 --> 20:34.320
So we've downloaded the 9.3 image.

20:34.320 --> 20:38.320
I'll go over to log in and give it a go.

20:38.320 --> 20:39.320
Yep.

20:39.320 --> 20:40.320
You ready?

20:40.320 --> 20:41.320
I think we should have a break.

20:41.320 --> 20:42.320
We'll be fine.

20:42.320 --> 20:43.680
You can hear the old server.

20:43.680 --> 20:44.680
It's so much smaller.

20:44.680 --> 20:45.680
No kidding.

20:45.680 --> 20:46.680
It's so much more low scale.

20:46.680 --> 20:47.680
Yeah.

20:47.680 --> 20:52.400
This was a fun upgrade because we really were kind of out.

20:52.400 --> 20:54.760
Both of us have managed servers for a long time.

20:54.760 --> 20:59.720
Basic storage server is not that complicated, but both of us just sort of felt out of our

20:59.720 --> 21:00.720
element with FreeNAS.

21:00.720 --> 21:01.720
Yeah.

21:01.720 --> 21:02.720
I've used FreeBSD.

21:02.720 --> 21:03.720
I've used ZFS.

21:03.720 --> 21:06.240
I've used ZFS on FreeBSD, but never FreeNAS.

21:06.240 --> 21:07.240
Yeah.

21:07.240 --> 21:08.240
That's the other thing here, right?

21:08.240 --> 21:09.240
This is a...

21:09.240 --> 21:13.200
I mean, it's not like we're not going to break it, but it's not a test system, so we would

21:13.200 --> 21:15.880
prefer to have the FreeNAS working at the end of the day.

21:15.880 --> 21:16.880
Yeah.

21:16.880 --> 21:19.440
I mean, it's so out of date because it was one of the very first FreeNAS minis, and it

21:19.440 --> 21:21.600
was a beta build, and we just never...

21:21.600 --> 21:23.480
It turns out you're running a podcast network.

21:23.480 --> 21:25.520
It went to work, and we never revisited it.

21:25.520 --> 21:26.840
It's a testament to the reliability.

21:26.840 --> 21:27.840
Yeah.

21:27.840 --> 21:31.080
But it's now, as we get to the point where we want to do a bunch of storage changes,

21:31.080 --> 21:32.800
we got to get this thing updated.

21:32.800 --> 21:34.960
Now we might want to do the save config option also.

21:34.960 --> 21:35.960
Right.

21:35.960 --> 21:36.960
Yes.

21:36.960 --> 21:37.960
I did recommend that.

21:37.960 --> 21:38.960
Yeah, we will.

21:38.960 --> 21:39.960
Yeah.

21:39.960 --> 21:40.960
So you can click here.

21:40.960 --> 21:41.960
It'll download your configuration, which is good.

21:41.960 --> 21:42.960
Perfect.

21:42.960 --> 21:43.960
And so that's step one.

21:43.960 --> 21:48.600
And then step two is you have to choose your upgrade image, which is different than their

21:48.600 --> 21:53.440
regular ISO image if you're in the 9 series and you're upgrading.

21:53.440 --> 21:54.440
So that's something to keep in mind.

21:54.440 --> 21:57.160
They've got like an XZ packed tar that you can just do.

21:57.160 --> 21:58.640
It doesn't have all the ISO stuff.

21:58.640 --> 21:59.640
Yeah, exactly.

21:59.640 --> 22:00.640
Okay.

22:00.640 --> 22:01.640
So you can select it.

22:01.640 --> 22:02.640
And hit upload.

22:02.640 --> 22:06.160
A whopping 364 megs of FreeNAS goodness.

22:06.160 --> 22:08.240
So I guess there's no step after this.

22:08.240 --> 22:09.240
You just hit apply update.

22:09.240 --> 22:10.240
All right.

22:10.240 --> 22:11.240
Let's hit it.

22:11.240 --> 22:12.240
It's uploading the firmware.

22:12.240 --> 22:13.240
It's going pretty fast.

22:13.240 --> 22:14.240
Okay.

22:14.240 --> 22:15.240
Hey.

22:15.240 --> 22:16.560
30%, 60%, 80%, 90%.

22:16.560 --> 22:17.640
It's uploaded.

22:17.640 --> 22:20.420
I think it's probably doing the checksum now.

22:20.420 --> 22:22.640
And extracting the firmware.

22:22.640 --> 22:24.360
The FreeNAS mini is in this.

22:24.360 --> 22:26.840
We're in the garage of the studio, and it's out here.

22:26.840 --> 22:27.840
So we're sitting next to it.

22:27.840 --> 22:30.240
We can start to hear it, start thinking here in a second.

22:30.240 --> 22:31.240
This is it.

22:31.240 --> 22:32.240
Extracting firmware.

22:32.240 --> 22:33.720
Do you feel like the 9.1 to 9.3?

22:33.720 --> 22:34.720
That's not a significant jump.

22:34.720 --> 22:38.320
I feel like if we can get the 9.3 pretty safely, we don't lose our configs, it should be a

22:38.320 --> 22:39.320
pretty straightforward process.

22:39.320 --> 22:41.640
And we're like a standard place.

22:41.640 --> 22:44.920
I think a lot of people probably upgraded from 9.3 to 11.

22:44.920 --> 22:46.720
And then it's storage time.

22:46.720 --> 22:50.840
Then we're redoing the entire storage setup, adding a whole bunch more storage.

22:50.840 --> 22:51.840
Excellent.

22:51.840 --> 22:52.840
Yeah.

22:52.840 --> 22:53.840
I think it needs it, right?

22:53.840 --> 22:54.840
Yeah.

22:54.840 --> 22:57.960
We're at, I shouldn't even say it, but we're at 94% capacity right now, which is, we've

22:57.960 --> 22:58.960
got to change it.

22:58.960 --> 22:59.960
Oh, file system loves that.

22:59.960 --> 23:04.000
We've got to get that down to like 80% max, which is, that's a future goal, but that's

23:04.000 --> 23:05.000
why we need more storage.

23:05.000 --> 23:06.000
All right.

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
Well, the firmware updates, I'll get our Etcher backup.

23:08.000 --> 23:13.080
Just in case this image based upgrade, they call it the graphical upgrade, doesn't work.

23:13.080 --> 23:18.640
We have a backup plan, which is to go straight to FreeNAS 11 via the ISO image and just plug

23:18.640 --> 23:19.640
in a USB port.

23:19.640 --> 23:20.640
It's faster than the iDrive.

23:20.640 --> 23:21.640
Yeah.

23:21.640 --> 23:22.640
Although if we have to plug in a USB port, we're also going to have to get a monitor

23:22.640 --> 23:23.640
and a keyboard.

23:23.640 --> 23:24.640
Oh, system is rebooting.

23:24.640 --> 23:25.640
Oh, here we go, Les.

23:25.640 --> 23:26.640
Okay.

23:26.640 --> 23:27.640
Fingers crossed.

23:27.640 --> 23:28.640
Oh, boy.

23:28.640 --> 23:33.000
Now you just wait, when you're doing these things remotely, you just wait for the system

23:33.000 --> 23:36.600
to come back up online and you're like, you're always tempted to like bring up a terminal

23:36.600 --> 23:37.600
window and start a ping.

23:37.600 --> 23:38.600
Yeah.

23:38.600 --> 23:39.600
Just run a ping.

23:39.600 --> 23:40.600
Absolutely.

23:40.600 --> 23:41.600
Why not?

23:41.600 --> 23:42.600
Should I?

23:42.600 --> 23:43.600
Okay.

23:43.600 --> 23:44.600
Sure.

23:44.600 --> 23:45.600
Yeah.

23:45.600 --> 23:46.600
You just want to know, right?

23:46.600 --> 23:47.600
Resist.

23:47.600 --> 23:48.600
I can't help it.

23:48.600 --> 23:55.040
You know what's interesting is that helped us get in the position to then move over

23:55.040 --> 24:00.780
to that super micro box, which then it really set us up to swap out the whole thing again

24:00.780 --> 24:02.980
to Fedora.

24:02.980 --> 24:07.540
But like that was the crucial piece is we needed to get the OS normalized and we had

24:07.540 --> 24:08.540
to get more storage.

24:08.540 --> 24:09.540
Right.

24:09.540 --> 24:13.500
But then we brought it over to a more general purpose system and eventually, yeah, added

24:13.500 --> 24:18.520
more storage and eventually, I mean, a Linux upgrade.

24:18.520 --> 24:23.540
That was one of those upgrades that took a really long time because it was when we were

24:23.540 --> 24:26.540
still an independent company on a very, very small budget.

24:26.540 --> 24:30.540
So I bought the drives on a Black Friday sale.

24:30.540 --> 24:31.540
Right.

24:31.540 --> 24:34.360
And they sat in storage here at the studio for a while.

24:34.360 --> 24:39.440
Then when I finally got a great deal from Unix Surplus, I got a great machine.

24:39.440 --> 24:45.080
I got that in here and then a listener of TechSnap very kindly donated some memory.

24:45.080 --> 24:46.440
That was amazing.

24:46.440 --> 24:50.440
And really put it over the top and then we were set.

24:50.440 --> 24:54.980
And it was just it all kind of just eventually came together over like a six month period.

24:54.980 --> 24:58.660
I love that that same data set just keeps chugging away.

24:58.660 --> 25:01.420
Yeah, really, really.

25:01.420 --> 25:04.700
It's really being put to the test right now because it's so freaking hot out there.

25:04.700 --> 25:08.780
So if it survives the summer in that garage, I'll be really impressed.

25:08.780 --> 25:09.780
It's the ultimate test.

25:09.780 --> 25:10.780
It's a pressure cooker.

25:10.780 --> 25:23.600
It's a pressure cooker.
