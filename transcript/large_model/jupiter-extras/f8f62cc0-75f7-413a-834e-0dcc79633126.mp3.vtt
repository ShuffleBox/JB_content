00:00.000 --> 00:13.760
Hello, everyone. This is Brunch with Brent. I'm super happy to be joined here by Joe

00:13.760 --> 00:15.760
Ressington. Joe, how are you doing?

00:15.760 --> 00:20.080
Yeah, good. A bit tired, a bit hungover, but, you know, the usual.

00:20.080 --> 00:25.440
Well, as we record, it's, you know, the holidays are just ending, and I know I've been trying

00:25.440 --> 00:30.200
to somehow gather myself after all of that, so I imagine it's much the same on your end

00:30.200 --> 00:31.200
of the pond.

00:31.200 --> 00:35.800
Yeah, and I didn't really have that much time off because I had some pre-recorded shows

00:35.800 --> 00:40.920
to do. I could do them in my own time, but I didn't have a full break, but I don't mind,

00:40.920 --> 00:47.520
really. I tweeted about it, actually, that normally Christmas for me has been this great

00:47.520 --> 00:52.840
time where I could have a couple of weeks off totally guilt-free, whereas this time

00:52.840 --> 00:59.080
I just basically did what I normally do, which is more or less whatever I want, you know,

00:59.080 --> 01:06.400
because I get paid to either play around with Linux or talk to people that I like about

01:06.400 --> 01:12.560
it and have fun chatting and have interesting conversations, or I get to do a bit of the

01:12.560 --> 01:16.380
pre-production and audio stuff, which is all the things that I love doing.

01:16.380 --> 01:18.080
So why would you want a break, right?

01:18.080 --> 01:19.080
Yeah, exactly.

01:19.080 --> 01:23.760
I guess that's a nice segue. We should give some people a bit of maybe some context or

01:23.760 --> 01:28.960
background for those who don't even know you that well. I guess if you had to introduce

01:28.960 --> 01:32.960
yourself, what would you say to someone who, you know, this is their first time running

01:32.960 --> 01:33.960
into you?

01:33.960 --> 01:40.040
I'd say I'm a full-time podcaster, and the subject of those podcasts is generally IT

01:40.040 --> 01:44.480
stuff, and then narrowed down a little bit further to Linux and open source.

01:44.480 --> 01:50.880
Yeah, in terms of podcasts, I mean, you're involved with quite a few. I was looking at

01:50.880 --> 01:56.480
OMG Ubuntu's, you know, Joey was talking about some New Year's resolutions, and in there,

01:56.480 --> 01:59.800
I don't know if you saw it, but there was a list of podcasts that he was recommending,

01:59.800 --> 02:05.440
and you were on like two of only a handful of them, or at least involved in them. He

02:05.440 --> 02:12.880
mentioned late night Linux, which you've been co-hosting for quite a while now. Linux Unplugged,

02:12.880 --> 02:18.200
you're deeply involved on the back end on that. So those were the two he mentioned.

02:18.200 --> 02:24.080
And I guess also, in terms of Jupiter broadcasting, Linux Action News, co-hosting that with Chris

02:24.080 --> 02:26.720
for what is that, like, two years now?

02:26.720 --> 02:28.880
I think something like that. Yeah.

02:28.880 --> 02:35.360
Yeah, it's, it's great. Choose Linux as well. You're there with Ellen Drew. User Error,

02:35.360 --> 02:39.560
which is a lot of people's favorite show. I'm laughing because it's definitely mine.

02:39.560 --> 02:42.320
Yeah, it's my favorite show of all the ones that I do, definitely.

02:42.320 --> 02:43.600
Oh, really? Why is that?

02:43.600 --> 02:48.880
I think because it's not all about Linux, it's something different. I do enjoy the Linux

02:48.880 --> 02:53.720
shows, but just having a chance to talk about random stuff like family arguments and how

02:53.720 --> 02:58.840
to deal with them is just a bit of fun and something different.

02:58.840 --> 03:05.480
I think the thing I enjoy about it is that it's sort of Linux related in that, of course,

03:05.480 --> 03:10.400
you guys are going to talk about Linux, since you're all deeply involved in it. And yet

03:10.400 --> 03:16.960
it's a bunch of topics that, you know, all of us have to deal with in a day to day, day

03:16.960 --> 03:24.080
to day fashion. And yet can relate even though it's not technology specific, necessarily,

03:24.080 --> 03:27.480
some of the questions you guys are answering and topics you're discussing, and yet it just

03:27.480 --> 03:31.960
comes across as deeply hilarious. So I really enjoy it.

03:31.960 --> 03:35.720
Yeah. And what's also good is that some of the questions come from the audience. And

03:35.720 --> 03:39.200
so they're just completely out of left field. And it's stuff that we've never thought about

03:39.200 --> 03:44.560
before. But I also have the opportunity, well, all three of us do, to throw in our own questions.

03:44.560 --> 03:49.000
So if there's something that we really want to talk about, we have that opportunity. So

03:49.000 --> 03:53.760
it's a pretty good balance, I think. And it's really fun working with Dan and Poppy as well.

03:53.760 --> 04:00.240
They're both pretty funny guys. I often put a little bit of kind of off air banter at

04:00.240 --> 04:08.320
the beginning. And the last one that we did, it was just completely out of context. And

04:08.320 --> 04:12.240
hilarious to me, but no one else knew what it was about. It was something to do with

04:12.240 --> 04:19.000
coins on a dance floor. And nobody wanted them back. So yeah, I won't spoil it on here.

04:19.000 --> 04:22.960
But if anyone really, really wants to know, they can ask me on Telegram or something.

04:22.960 --> 04:26.560
Yeah, that's sometimes some of the best parts are the stuff that happened, you know, just

04:26.560 --> 04:32.560
before just after a show, right? That, you know, you throw the three of you into a room

04:32.560 --> 04:36.800
and some magic's gonna happen. Each of you have a pretty great personality. So it's been

04:36.800 --> 04:40.640
fun to hear the recorded stuff. That's for sure. Yeah, well, the key to it is that as

04:40.640 --> 04:44.400
soon as we start talking, we make sure that if there's anything that we don't want recorded

04:44.400 --> 04:48.240
that we need to discuss, we get that out of the way and then we just hit record. And then

04:48.240 --> 04:53.200
just and see what happens. Yeah, just what we have the set questions and you know, the

04:53.200 --> 04:58.440
intro and everything. But otherwise, we just record a bunch before and a bunch afterwards.

04:58.440 --> 05:04.560
And we record for anything up to like an hour and 15 minutes, and then it gets cut down

05:04.560 --> 05:11.920
to about 40 ish minutes. And I just look for something I just look in the waveforms for

05:11.920 --> 05:17.680
the laughter. And okay, what was that? Oh, I remember that. Yeah, that was funny. Yeah,

05:17.680 --> 05:21.720
let's put that at the beginning. Those are the anchor points, right? Yeah. It actually

05:21.720 --> 05:25.080
now that you're you're talking a little bit about the process there, it reminds me a little

05:25.080 --> 05:30.160
bit of how I approach this show, actually brunch with Brent, like you were mentioning

05:30.160 --> 05:33.920
when we were talking just getting connected, you're like, it's so strange not to have any

05:33.920 --> 05:40.240
show notes. Because you just, you know, part of I think the magic that sometimes happens

05:40.240 --> 05:44.360
here is you just hit record and see where, you know, my brain connecting with your brain

05:44.360 --> 05:50.160
takes us sometimes into unknown territory, right? Yeah, it is very strange to not have

05:50.160 --> 05:54.440
a shower doc, I must say, but it's refreshing, refreshing. Okay, I'm glad you didn't say

05:54.440 --> 06:02.000
uncomfortable because that's not what we're after. But I guess I also need to mention

06:02.000 --> 06:07.640
late late night Linux. That's something you've been co hosting for a while. Yeah, that's

06:07.640 --> 06:12.040
something that evolved out of Linux Luddites. And it's funny that a lot of people assume

06:12.040 --> 06:17.680
that it's part of Jupyter broadcasting, but it's just not at all. It's completely independent.

06:17.680 --> 06:22.280
It's it's kind of how I attracted Chris's attention, I guess you might say, because

06:22.280 --> 06:29.720
we started Linux Luddites about five or six years ago. And that ran for a couple of years.

06:29.720 --> 06:35.080
My my brain's a bit foggy on history. But we did that for a few years. And then that

06:35.080 --> 06:41.440
stopped and then immediately late night Linux came out of that. And then that has had two

06:41.440 --> 06:47.800
incarnations. We had a kind of personnel change after about a year or so, I think. And then

06:47.800 --> 06:53.200
the last couple of years, we've had the new crew, I think just over a year. I don't know.

06:53.200 --> 06:56.160
Like I said, it all gets a bit foggy.

06:56.160 --> 07:02.600
Late night Linux reminds me of user error in many ways, except that it's Linux related,

07:02.600 --> 07:07.800
because it's just like the four of you sitting in a room. It's almost like you're at the

07:07.800 --> 07:12.240
pub just kind of chatting about the topics. And yet there's this, at least I find there's

07:12.240 --> 07:17.640
this deep insight in those conversations. So I've I've really appreciated it. It's another

07:17.640 --> 07:19.640
good mix of personalities, I would say.

07:19.640 --> 07:24.800
Oh, yeah, and experience as well. The three guys that I do that with all know loads about

07:24.800 --> 07:30.640
Linux from kind of different angles. Will was the head of the Ubuntu desktop for a few

07:30.640 --> 07:36.600
years. And you don't get to that position without being very knowledgeable. And he gained

07:36.600 --> 07:41.640
a lot of experience with their fail him, who is lesser known, you might say, but he has

07:41.640 --> 07:46.080
been a sys admin for 20 odd years. And so he really knows the stuff there. And then

07:46.080 --> 07:52.160
Graham has been in Linux publishing for a because he was the editor of Linux format,

07:52.160 --> 07:57.960
and then Linux voice. And they had their podcast go in for years. So he's got lots of experience

07:57.960 --> 08:01.360
as well. And I think that it really does just gel the four of us.

08:01.360 --> 08:06.240
Yeah, well, you're all coming at like, from different angles of Linux all into, you know,

08:06.240 --> 08:11.840
it's all intersecting in a really nice way. How did the four of you ever get connected?

08:11.840 --> 08:16.480
Like it? It feels to me like, certainly, you've got a lot of pretty deep connections in the

08:16.480 --> 08:19.840
Linux community. But how about the four of you specifically?

08:19.840 --> 08:27.440
Well, I knew Graham from just events and things really, and the fact that he was doing, it's

08:27.440 --> 08:32.160
had so many different names, I think it was called tux radar at first, and then then it

08:32.160 --> 08:36.240
was Linux lifestyle for a couple of weeks. And then it was Linux voice, and then bug

08:36.240 --> 08:43.040
report before it kind of fizzled out. And I just knew him from the scene, I suppose.

08:43.040 --> 08:48.920
And it just seemed like an obvious person to us because he had been the person doing

08:48.920 --> 08:52.560
the audio and stuff for them. And he knew really knew quite a lot about podcasting.

08:52.560 --> 08:59.000
And he was the driving force behind that podcast. And so he seemed obvious. And Will, I'd heard

08:59.000 --> 09:05.520
interviewed on the Ubuntu podcast, and he seemed like just a good personality. And so

09:05.520 --> 09:09.720
I just got in touch with him. I can't remember, it must have been through Wimpy and Poppy,

09:09.720 --> 09:15.520
and got in touch with him and asked him, did he want to do it? And he said yes. And so

09:15.520 --> 09:24.520
the rest is history, I suppose. And Phelan had met at odd camp, I think. And what stuck

09:24.520 --> 09:29.400
out to me there was that he runs Android with no Google Apps. And so we got him on Linux

09:29.400 --> 09:33.880
loadouts to talk about that. And I thought he did really, really well, and came across

09:33.880 --> 09:41.360
as this funny guy that he is and really knowledgeable. And so when it came to changing the personnel

09:41.360 --> 09:44.400
the first time, he just seemed like an obvious choice.

09:44.400 --> 09:49.560
Yeah, well, there's some magic in that combination. So obviously, it was pretty serendipitous

09:49.560 --> 09:57.480
to bring it all together. So kudos to you guys. You mentioned odd camp. I listened recently

09:57.480 --> 10:06.180
to the panel that is in the Jupiter extras of the most recent odd camp, where you sort

10:06.180 --> 10:10.800
of moderated a discussion that went in many directions that were super fascinating. So

10:10.800 --> 10:16.320
I would definitely recommend some people check that out. But do you have a closer connection

10:16.320 --> 10:19.720
with odd camp? It feels like I don't know, maybe it's close to your heart or something.

10:19.720 --> 10:27.640
Well, yeah, I've been going since I think, 2011. So nearly, I think, yeah, I went to

10:27.640 --> 10:32.880
the second or third one. Again, history is not my strong point.

10:32.880 --> 10:34.880
Yeah, me neither, actually.

10:34.880 --> 10:41.880
But I've been going to it for many years, and I've only missed one or two for just clashes

10:41.880 --> 10:47.940
with other stuff I had to do. And I'm on the organizers mailing list, but I never really

10:47.940 --> 10:57.320
do anything. I'm not an organizer. I kind of took over the panel, I think, three or

10:57.320 --> 11:03.980
four years ago. And because no one really wants to take on the organization of that,

11:03.980 --> 11:07.720
they just said, yeah, okay, and let me do it the first time. It wasn't great the first

11:07.720 --> 11:13.260
time I did it, to be honest, because it turns out that moderating a panel is not like hosting

11:13.260 --> 11:18.160
a podcast because when you're hosting a podcast, you're giving a lot of your own opinions.

11:18.160 --> 11:22.080
And it's a conversation, whereas a panel is not supposed to be that if you're moderating

11:22.080 --> 11:26.400
it. You're supposed to allow everyone their chance to speak, but not have too much of

11:26.400 --> 11:30.920
your own input. And so I did that completely wrong. Got some feedback about that.

11:30.920 --> 11:32.960
What a tricky balance, right?

11:32.960 --> 11:38.920
It's very difficult to do. It's far more difficult than it looks. And I'm still not that good

11:38.920 --> 11:44.600
at it. And that's why I want to do it because I love doing live stuff. I always have my

11:44.600 --> 11:52.160
background as a musician, which we may get into a bit later. And so I really love doing

11:52.160 --> 11:57.240
live shows. It was really daunting the first time because even though I've done a bit of

11:57.240 --> 12:05.400
stand up, and I say a bit, like three or four times, and I've been on stage in various guises

12:05.400 --> 12:09.920
in bands drumming and playing guitar and singing and stuff. But the first time I did the old

12:09.920 --> 12:15.280
camp panel, it was so daunting because it was during the day, everyone was sober, lights

12:15.280 --> 12:20.720
were bright, and it was a completely different experience for me. And so I was really nervous.

12:20.720 --> 12:26.080
But it kind of went all right. But I wanted to just get better at it because it was just

12:26.080 --> 12:32.840
this new challenge for me. And so I think I've been slowly but surely every year getting

12:32.840 --> 12:36.640
a little bit better at it. And I think this one went pretty well.

12:36.640 --> 12:42.600
The reason I asked was that it felt like certainly you had done it for more than once. And you

12:42.600 --> 12:46.960
just said for a few years there. But at the same time, the thing I appreciated was that

12:46.960 --> 12:52.160
you were aware of your involvement. And at one point, you mentioned, Okay, I'm not supposed

12:52.160 --> 12:53.640
to do this. But here's my opinion.

12:53.640 --> 12:56.920
I just couldn't resist at one point.

12:56.920 --> 13:01.520
But at least you're aware of it. So that's good. But yeah, that's, it's so interesting

13:01.520 --> 13:07.320
to me when, you know, you're, you're taking a skill that is curious to you, but you're

13:07.320 --> 13:11.640
not really that maybe that great at and you just keep persevering with it. I think that

13:11.640 --> 13:16.200
is really valuable. And it sounds like you've gotten a lot of it out of it. Do you think

13:16.200 --> 13:19.680
it's helped you in the podcast realm, even though it's a little bit different?

13:19.680 --> 13:24.880
I think so. Yeah, it's it's helped me ask more questions, I think, when I'm hosting

13:24.880 --> 13:30.520
late like Linux, I try not to give too much of my own opinion, and try and just throw

13:30.520 --> 13:35.200
it to the guys and ask them what they think about stuff. And that is, I think come from

13:35.200 --> 13:39.420
what has been influenced by doing these panels. Definitely.

13:39.420 --> 13:43.560
One thing I've noticed is sometimes you get the best information out of people by just

13:43.560 --> 13:48.040
not saying a single thing, right? If you just let them go on and go on and go on, they'll

13:48.040 --> 13:50.360
eventually get somewhere interesting that they've never been before.

13:50.360 --> 13:53.800
Yeah, especially if you're editing it yourself. And you know, you can edit out any of the

13:53.800 --> 14:00.240
boring stuff. Because that's what I am, you know, primarily an editor. And somehow I've

14:00.240 --> 14:04.560
managed to trick everyone into thinking that I'm reasonably good at podcasting, just by

14:04.560 --> 14:09.640
the fact that I know that I can edit stuff. And I can edit out whenever I say anything

14:09.640 --> 14:15.640
stupid. And whenever I have huge pauses to think about stuff or trip over my words or

14:15.640 --> 14:22.280
whatever, I know I can edit it. And a good edit, you should never hear, you should never

14:22.280 --> 14:26.440
notice. So I will probably end up editing this. And you should hopefully not notice

14:26.440 --> 14:30.720
any of the edits that have taken place in it. I don't think there'll be that many, because

14:30.720 --> 14:36.560
this is kind of more of a free flowing conversation. But something like Linux Action News, where

14:36.560 --> 14:41.340
we kind of stop to look stuff up sometimes, and we make sure that we try and say things

14:41.340 --> 14:48.160
in a proper way. That requires quite a lot of editing, but hopefully no one notices.

14:48.160 --> 14:53.760
Yeah, it's similar to your moderating that obcant panel is that if you're, if you're

14:53.760 --> 14:59.680
doing that task really well, no one will even notice that it's happening, right? There are

14:59.680 --> 15:07.520
a few professions like that. And I think they're important still to be mindful of and to congratulate

15:07.520 --> 15:11.760
because it's like, that it's not noticeable is a complete success.

15:11.760 --> 15:15.920
Yeah, well, it goes back to being a drummer, which I was for many years. If people notice

15:15.920 --> 15:19.200
the drummer, then you've done something wrong as far as I'm concerned. And this is, you

15:19.200 --> 15:23.140
know, you might notice them in flashes of, you know, a little bit here and there. But

15:23.140 --> 15:27.200
generally speaking, the drummer is not there to attract attention. The drummer is there

15:27.200 --> 15:32.440
to lock in with the bass player and be the backline and the rhythm section and allow

15:32.440 --> 15:36.200
the singer and guitarist to shine or whoever's upfront.

15:36.200 --> 15:41.520
That is so fascinating. I never really. So I tend to lean towards drumming when I enjoy

15:41.520 --> 15:47.400
songs. It's a goal of mine to get into it because I'm always tapping on stuff. So maybe

15:47.400 --> 15:52.640
I'll reach out to you for some tips there. But it's interesting to me that intersection

15:52.640 --> 15:58.760
between music and some of the podcasting and editing that you're doing. The chat I did

15:58.760 --> 16:04.860
with Catherine, she's deeply into music as well. And she had some really neat intersections

16:04.860 --> 16:11.680
between coding and music, some of the patterns and pattern recognitions and stuff like that.

16:11.680 --> 16:18.100
But I actually had no idea that you were well, you're a multi instrumentalist, I would say.

16:18.100 --> 16:24.120
But the drumming was was a new thing to me. So super curious to me to hear that.

16:24.120 --> 16:27.720
One thing about it that I should have mentioned is that I'm talking about kind of standard

16:27.720 --> 16:33.940
rock and pop type music. If you're talking about metal or jazz, then it kind of doesn't

16:33.940 --> 16:38.520
necessarily count that if you notice the drummer, like Mastodon, for example, that's all about

16:38.520 --> 16:44.680
Brand doing his ridiculous drum fills all the time, whatever. But I'm talking more the

16:44.680 --> 16:48.440
kind of music that I used to do. So I need to caveat that because people might be disagreeing

16:48.440 --> 16:49.440
with me there.

16:49.440 --> 16:54.760
Well, I think there's an exception to any, any of those style of rules, right? Can you

16:54.760 --> 17:01.080
give us a tiny bit of a bigger taste of some of the music you might have been doing previously?

17:01.080 --> 17:06.400
Well, I would just say it's this is like that follow up tweet to a viral one, check out

17:06.400 --> 17:14.360
my soundcloud because there's that represents a fair kind of spread of the music that I

17:14.360 --> 17:21.680
had done with some electronic stuff, kind of hip hop, more dance type music, and then

17:21.680 --> 17:29.660
some kind of rocky towards the harder end of rock kind of but I always kind of ended

17:29.660 --> 17:34.480
up being pulled into melodic poppy stuff. I don't I don't know why really, even though

17:34.480 --> 17:42.500
I listened to a lot more. Well, a lot less poppy stuff, I just tend to prefer a nice

17:42.500 --> 17:44.840
melody and harmony if possible.

17:44.840 --> 17:48.160
Interesting that the stuff you listen to is different than the stuff you you lean towards

17:48.160 --> 17:49.160
creating?

17:49.160 --> 17:53.880
Well, not not completely. But I'd listen to I've never understood how anyone can say what

17:53.880 --> 17:59.100
kind of music they like and say I like metal or I like country or I like reggae, whatever.

17:59.100 --> 18:03.700
That doesn't make sense to me. I like good music and it doesn't matter who is doing that,

18:03.700 --> 18:08.000
whether that is Mastodon or Taylor Swift. If it's good music, then I'm listening to

18:08.000 --> 18:09.000
it.

18:09.000 --> 18:10.000
You are a big Taylor Swift fan I've learned.

18:10.000 --> 18:15.100
I really am. I mean, I don't have albums or anything like that. But I really admire her

18:15.100 --> 18:21.720
I think is the bottom line because she has just kind of just done whatever she wants

18:21.720 --> 18:30.800
really and made herself this huge success by just doing what she wants. And not really.

18:30.800 --> 18:35.400
Maybe she is taking influence from managers or whatever, but she just seems to be in control

18:35.400 --> 18:37.760
of everything. And I really admire that.

18:37.760 --> 18:43.040
I don't know her very well. But I because of you actually decided to check out her NPR

18:43.040 --> 18:50.280
Tiny Desk concert and it just felt she just felt really genuine. Yeah, and full of heart

18:50.280 --> 18:53.760
as well. And those two combined is pretty powerful stuff.

18:53.760 --> 18:57.480
Yeah. And some of the songs she writes, I would say it's a bit hit and miss. I'm not

18:57.480 --> 19:01.600
going to say everything she writes is brilliant, but she does have a knack for sometimes writing

19:01.600 --> 19:07.080
really catchy tunes that might be only two or three chords. And that you need to calm

19:07.080 --> 19:12.960
down song is literally two chords, the whole song. And yet it was a massive success for

19:12.960 --> 19:13.960
her.

19:13.960 --> 19:15.600
Sometimes simplicity is the best thing, right?

19:15.600 --> 19:16.600
Exactly.

19:16.600 --> 19:22.680
And talent as well. Sometimes it takes talent to make something look simple. I know that's

19:22.680 --> 19:27.400
certainly true in photography, some of the stuff that I do, but even, you know, I'm getting

19:27.400 --> 19:34.960
more of an insight into what it takes to make a podcast. And there's a lot of brilliance

19:34.960 --> 19:38.240
that goes into the back end of stuff. And it looks simple from the outside, but that's

19:38.240 --> 19:45.960
not always true. I'm curious about your like, does music have an influence? Well, let me

19:45.960 --> 19:52.440
back up a little bit. I'm just broadly assuming that you were editing your own music creations.

19:52.440 --> 19:53.440
Is that a safe assumption?

19:53.440 --> 20:00.200
Yeah, well, that's kind of how I got into computers generally, really. I'd always played,

20:00.200 --> 20:06.000
ever since I was a little kid, I'd been musical. Not like Katherine, though. It's funny that

20:06.000 --> 20:12.180
she is properly musical, reading music and everything. I've always been the kind of person

20:12.180 --> 20:18.840
who plays by ear. And although I can roughly read music, I never do. So I don't have that

20:18.840 --> 20:25.960
mathematical approach to it. I'm really playing by feel. But just wanting to play and record

20:25.960 --> 20:31.320
music is what got me into computers. Because I had originally been playing with a four

20:31.320 --> 20:37.440
track, which I've actually still got, I think, which uses a tape, just an audio cassette.

20:37.440 --> 20:43.160
And you could record one thing and then dub another one over it and then mix it a little

20:43.160 --> 20:48.400
bit. But then, when I wanted to start making something that had a bit more of an electronic

20:48.400 --> 20:53.240
feel, that's when I started to get into computers. And I made friends with someone who was making,

20:53.240 --> 21:00.200
well, he was making dubstep before dubstep was even a thing really, really, really early

21:00.200 --> 21:07.800
on. And he kind of taught me how to do the basics. And because I've been so busy playing

21:07.800 --> 21:13.880
music in bands and everything, I hadn't really learned much about computers. And then I got

21:13.880 --> 21:21.740
my first one when I was 19. And because I was too poor to get a Mac, it was Windows.

21:21.740 --> 21:25.360
And because it was Windows, it broke all the time. And I was forced to learn how to fix

21:25.360 --> 21:30.440
it. And I have that kind of inquiring mind of wanting to know how things work. And so

21:30.440 --> 21:36.320
I got used to reinstalling Windows and learned about all the drivers situation and partitioning.

21:36.320 --> 21:41.700
And this was back when it was IDE hard drives, and you had to get the jumpers right for master

21:41.700 --> 21:48.680
and slave and all that kind of stuff. And that, in turn, led me into Linux because I

21:48.680 --> 21:52.560
wanted to get the most performance that I possibly could out of these machines. Well,

21:52.560 --> 22:00.520
my one desktop computer that was, it was old and rubbish even by the standards of the time.

22:00.520 --> 22:06.960
And that led me into wanting to get more performance out of it, which led me to discovering nLite,

22:06.960 --> 22:10.920
which is the thing that you can configure Windows ISOs with. And you can use that to

22:10.920 --> 22:15.920
strip out all the security stuff, which makes it run much more quickly. But it's obviously

22:15.920 --> 22:21.560
very insecure. And so I then wanted to find a way to have a secure operating system that

22:21.560 --> 22:26.200
was also lightweight. And in comes Linux and the rest is history.

22:26.200 --> 22:30.200
Did someone suggest it to you? Or did you come across it on the web? Or how did it first

22:30.200 --> 22:31.920
come in, you know, in front of you?

22:31.920 --> 22:36.560
Well, my brother had introduced me to it, and he'd given me some Mandrake CDs or Mandrake

22:36.560 --> 22:44.280
or something. And I just never bothered installing them. And then when I wanted to get into Linux

22:44.280 --> 22:49.580
again, I think I must have researched it a little bit. And Ubuntu was fairly new-ish

22:49.580 --> 22:56.680
back then. This was kind of 2007, I think. And I just heard that Ubuntu was where it's

22:56.680 --> 23:02.280
at. And I was so impressed. The thing that grabbed me instantly was that I downloaded

23:02.280 --> 23:07.520
this file, burnt it onto a CD, rebooted my computer, booted from that CD, and I had an

23:07.520 --> 23:12.520
operating system that was there and running. And then I could just reboot my computer and

23:12.520 --> 23:19.520
go back to Windows. That was just such a revelation to me because the process of installing Windows

23:19.520 --> 23:25.480
to this day to be quite lengthy. And this, it was just this mind-blowing revelation.

23:25.480 --> 23:27.240
And I was just hooked straight away, I think.

23:27.240 --> 23:29.000
There's just something about it that grabbed you, right?

23:29.000 --> 23:30.000
Yeah.

23:30.000 --> 23:31.480
And it sounds like it's still grabbing you.

23:31.480 --> 23:37.960
Yeah. And at the time, I had this P4, three gigahertz, whatever processor with 512 megabytes

23:37.960 --> 23:45.360
of RAM. And GNOME 2, it ran well, but I just thought, hmm, I wonder if there's something

23:45.360 --> 23:48.080
a little bit faster than this.

23:48.080 --> 23:49.080
And I know where this is going.

23:49.080 --> 23:54.800
Yeah. And then I discovered XFCE and then tried a bunch of other stuff as well and Openbox

23:54.800 --> 24:02.080
and everything. And although there are faster and lighter desktops than XFCE, for me, it

24:02.080 --> 24:06.520
was then and here we are 10 years later, it hasn't really changed much. It is the perfect

24:06.520 --> 24:10.280
balance for me between features and weight.

24:10.280 --> 24:17.800
And I've tried everything that you name a desktop, I have tried it, but I always come

24:17.800 --> 24:21.200
back to XFCE. And that's what I'm staring at right now.

24:21.200 --> 24:26.360
I think that's very similar to my history, actually, I would say I discovered Linux a

24:26.360 --> 24:31.000
little later than you. But I went through a similar trajectory of just trying a whole

24:31.000 --> 24:36.400
bunch of desktops. Because I didn't really know, you know, I kind of knew what the standards

24:36.400 --> 24:42.240
were at the time. And it was, you know, GNOME 2, or it might have been three at the time.

24:42.240 --> 24:47.680
And I also was using some older hardware, and I landed on XFCE. And it was the first

24:47.680 --> 24:53.760
sort of desktop that I stayed with for multiple years. And it was amazing, even back then,

24:53.760 --> 25:00.320
you know, it wasn't perfect, and nothing is. So I am right there with you. I know it's

25:00.320 --> 25:04.960
kind of a funny joke now that everybody says that you're, you know, so in love with XFCE.

25:04.960 --> 25:09.760
But there, there are some pretty good reasons, some, some deep reasons for that kind of stuff.

25:09.760 --> 25:12.400
And so I'm right there behind you.

25:12.400 --> 25:16.000
Yeah, I do like plasma as well. I think that's a great desktop. That's what you use. I was

25:16.000 --> 25:21.500
listening to you earlier today talking to Rocco on Linux spotlight. I'm only halfway

25:21.500 --> 25:27.640
through it, because it's two hours long, right? Sorry. It's okay. But you talking about plasma

25:27.640 --> 25:36.680
on there. That is a great desktop. There's no doubt in my mind. And LXQ is great. Marte

25:36.680 --> 25:43.680
is great. And I always say the one thing I love more than XFCE is choice. And if you

25:43.680 --> 25:49.000
like GNOME, I personally cannot stand GNOME. It has improved significantly. But I just

25:49.000 --> 25:54.440
can't get on with it. But I know that a bunch of people love it. And that's great. You know,

25:54.440 --> 25:59.080
crack on. Excellent. I'm happy for you. And you know, you'd be happy for me running XFCE

25:59.080 --> 26:00.520
and we'll all be happy together.

26:00.520 --> 26:05.400
Yeah, that's, that's definitely the best part is everybody has a different preference. And

26:05.400 --> 26:10.920
we've got so many desktops for everyone. So that's like the land of choice. We've, we've

26:10.920 --> 26:18.160
got it right. So we're really fortunate in that, for sure. Can we just go back to music

26:18.160 --> 26:26.680
for a little bit? So it might be true that you had that the theme song for Brunch with

26:26.680 --> 26:33.240
Brent came from your fingers and from your mind and your heart. Can you give us a little,

26:33.240 --> 26:36.800
you know, I feel honored that it's at the start and the end of these crazy conversations

26:36.800 --> 26:41.880
that I have. But you mentioned that there might be a tiny bit of a story there.

26:41.880 --> 26:50.200
Yeah, well, it came from my desire to eat Thai food. Because so it's a riff. It's a

26:50.200 --> 26:56.280
very basic thing. It's just a couple of jazzy ish chords. And it's something that I've been

26:56.280 --> 27:05.600
playing around with about 20 years ago, with a band that I was in. And then, I think this

27:05.600 --> 27:12.000
must have been three or four years ago, maybe a bit longer. My friend who does post production

27:12.000 --> 27:21.000
sound for TV, adverts, movies, that sort of thing. He texted me or called me on a Sunday

27:21.000 --> 27:26.720
and said, I need some music for a short film that I'm doing tomorrow. It only has to be

27:26.720 --> 27:33.720
short. And it's for hold music for someone holding on the phone. And I need something

27:33.720 --> 27:38.760
sort of jazzy and cheesy. And I was like, Oh, man, I've got to do the next Action News

27:38.760 --> 27:43.320
later. And I was preparing for that. And I really didn't have time. He said, Well, I'll

27:43.320 --> 27:51.120
buy you Thai Cottage, which was a really nice restaurant in on Darbly Street in London,

27:51.120 --> 27:55.960
sadly no longer there. That's a funny story, actually, I don't want to get off on too many

27:55.960 --> 28:01.120
tangents. But one day, it was sold to someone and it kind of continued. And then apparently

28:01.120 --> 28:06.440
one day, they just disappeared with no notice or anything. They just disappeared. And there

28:06.440 --> 28:11.600
was lots of speculation about what happened. And it was just there one day, and then just

28:11.600 --> 28:17.160
literally gone the next. So that was a real shame, because he used to love going there.

28:17.160 --> 28:23.040
But anyway, so I only had about an hour to do this. And so I just quickly programmed

28:23.040 --> 28:29.000
the bottom of the beat, and then the baseline, which is really simple, and then put an electric

28:29.000 --> 28:35.200
piano type thing down. And then played the riff. And I think I did it in I think I did

28:35.200 --> 28:40.760
that guitar riff in one take, but I'm not sure I may have done two. But yeah, just smashed

28:40.760 --> 28:45.920
it out made it a perfect loop so that he could use it for as long as he wanted, sent it off

28:45.920 --> 28:50.160
to him. And he said, Yeah, that's perfect. That's exactly what I wanted. And then a week

28:50.160 --> 28:55.040
or so later, ran out for my Thai meal, and even bought me some cider, I think with it

28:55.040 --> 28:57.880
as well, which is it was extra delicious.

28:57.880 --> 29:03.160
Well, I have a deep love for Thai food as well. It might be one of my number one go

29:03.160 --> 29:04.160
tos.

29:04.160 --> 29:07.680
I'm surprised with you being vegetarian because there's do you fish?

29:07.680 --> 29:13.400
You know, I try to be a pregnant because I have a few allergies, as you know, and I try

29:13.400 --> 29:19.400
to be as pragmatic as possible, especially around the vegan stuff. Because I would say

29:19.400 --> 29:25.680
the vegan option is more of a preference. So I try not to be sort of very caught up

29:25.680 --> 29:29.600
on it. But a lot of Thai restaurants I've been to will give you the option, actually,

29:29.600 --> 29:33.600
they'll take some of the fish sauce out and stuff like that.

29:33.600 --> 29:34.600
Interesting.

29:34.600 --> 29:37.640
You sometimes you just have to ask. Yeah. So yeah, Thai food is definitely my number

29:37.640 --> 29:43.160
one go to and I'm always I can, you know, the airports that have Thai food in them tend

29:43.160 --> 29:46.680
to be my favorite ones for layovers. That's for sure. So I can tell you exactly which

29:46.680 --> 29:49.560
ones have it and where to where to go to find it.

29:49.560 --> 29:55.480
Oh, I would not eat Thai food from a from an airport. I might go to his pizza generally

29:55.480 --> 30:00.880
when I'm traveling pizza because it's very hard to get food poisoning from pizza because

30:00.880 --> 30:07.640
it goes in a really hot oven. And this well, I mean, obviously is possible to get it. But

30:07.640 --> 30:12.080
I think if you're going into the realms of Thai food and stuff, that's where you could

30:12.080 --> 30:15.560
easily get food. And that is the last thing you want when you're traveling.

30:15.560 --> 30:19.700
You know, that's really logical. I would say for sure the hot oven temperatures that makes

30:19.700 --> 30:27.520
a lot of sense. You and I, you and I recently at the JB sprint actually in the late summer,

30:27.520 --> 30:32.000
went for a few walks to get some pizza, which was fun.

30:32.000 --> 30:36.920
It's just my go to because pizza generally, it's going to vary in quality, but even rubbish

30:36.920 --> 30:43.160
pizza is better than no pizza. And it's, you know, you're gonna get it wherever you go.

30:43.160 --> 30:46.800
And so just when I'm traveling, that's my go to I don't really eat that much of it while

30:46.800 --> 30:52.080
I'm at home. But I just know that it's something I can rely on no matter where I am in the

30:52.080 --> 30:53.080
world pretty much.

30:53.080 --> 30:54.080
Yeah, you'll find it anywhere, right?

30:54.080 --> 30:58.120
Yeah. And the thing is, I can eat it every day as well, because it's so delicious. Even

30:58.120 --> 31:05.920
terrible pizza, I find delicious. The worst pizza I had was at Sea-Tac. And I think that

31:05.920 --> 31:11.320
it speaks volumes that I was there twice last year, and I had a pizza twice last year at

31:11.320 --> 31:12.320
Sea-Tac.

31:12.320 --> 31:19.480
Yeah, I you know, because some of my allergies, I've got a gluten and a dairy allergy. Pizza

31:19.480 --> 31:24.320
would otherwise be my go to because I absolutely love it as well. And there are a few really

31:24.320 --> 31:28.760
amazing gluten free pizzas, but they are tough to find. Yeah, they're super tough to track

31:28.760 --> 31:31.520
that down rather than just an airport.

31:31.520 --> 31:36.920
Yeah, those those I have a text file for the ones I record where to find gluten free pizza

31:36.920 --> 31:43.440
worthwhile, because most of it isn't. There's a moment actually, when you and I first met

31:43.440 --> 31:48.800
that I will always forever stick in my mind. And I don't know if it will for you. Because,

31:48.800 --> 31:51.240
you know, when two people experience something, it's a little bit different. But you and I

31:51.240 --> 31:56.680
first met, we had the chance to meet at Linux fest, the last Linux fest that happened this

31:56.680 --> 32:02.080
past year. And I guess you had probably at that point been hearing my voice quite a bit,

32:02.080 --> 32:07.580
because you were editing Linux unplugged for quite a while. But I specifically remember

32:07.580 --> 32:12.080
when we landed at the JB studio, and you and I are in the same room, we kind of looked

32:12.080 --> 32:15.960
at each other. And we were meeting a bunch of people and said, Hey, I'm Joe. And I said,

32:15.960 --> 32:21.960
Hi, I'm Brent. And I remember specifically what you said, you said, Oh, you're not quite

32:21.960 --> 32:26.640
what I expected. And I said, Well, you're not quite what I expected either.

32:26.640 --> 32:31.840
Yeah, it's weird. You kind of have a mental image of people whose voice you hear all the

32:31.840 --> 32:35.800
time, and then you meet them. And a lot of people say that to me, they don't think that

32:35.800 --> 32:41.560
I'm going to look like this man mountain.

32:41.560 --> 32:46.880
I guess we have to do that as humans, you know, draw images in our minds of the things

32:46.880 --> 32:51.720
that we're imagining. You know, because we're only using one sense our ears to try to get

32:51.720 --> 32:56.440
this a sense of this person. But that moment, it's just hilarious to me. And it kind of

32:56.440 --> 33:02.560
set the scene for for the rest of the time and has taken us to now and I feel like you

33:02.560 --> 33:06.440
and I joke about quite a lot of really ridiculous things. And that kind of set the stage. So

33:06.440 --> 33:07.920
I like that quite a bit.

33:07.920 --> 33:11.800
Yeah, we probably shouldn't mention too much about our last physical encounter when you

33:11.800 --> 33:16.960
drove me to the airport. When I'd basically been up all night drinking and stressed because

33:16.960 --> 33:20.920
I thought I'd lost my passport. And then it turned out to be just in a pair of trousers

33:20.920 --> 33:27.320
that I'd set aside. That was tearing that hotel room apart was not fun. I tell you.

33:27.320 --> 33:34.280
It made at least for me a really good story. And gave us lots to talk about on the way

33:34.280 --> 33:41.720
to the airport. I think I started to sober up during that car ride down there.

33:41.720 --> 33:46.520
That was during the JB sprint. And and was it true that you hadn't met? Oh, I guess it

33:46.520 --> 33:51.640
was at Linux fest that you hadn't met Chris yet until that Linux fest, right? And you

33:51.640 --> 33:55.800
guys have been? Had you been doing Linux action news for quite a while?

33:55.800 --> 33:59.360
Yeah, we've been doing it for nearly a year.

33:59.360 --> 34:03.040
It's like six months or something like that, if I remember. Yeah.

34:03.040 --> 34:09.120
And I would kind of known each other a bit before then, as well. So yeah, it was weird

34:09.120 --> 34:18.660
to meet him. And it was the first transatlantic flight that I had done for 20 years, maybe,

34:18.660 --> 34:24.080
maybe more than that. 25 since I was a little kid. I've traveled around Europe and stuff,

34:24.080 --> 34:29.400
but it's been a long time, or it had been a long time since I'd done long haul. And

34:29.400 --> 34:33.480
I got off that plane and I was just like a zombie. And it was just really weird meeting

34:33.480 --> 34:40.840
everyone and just sitting around in this, like wings bar or something, or a sports bar.

34:40.840 --> 34:45.560
And it was just quite surreal, really. Once I had a good night's sleep, I was fine after

34:45.560 --> 34:50.920
that. But yeah, that was weird. And then the second time I went for the sprint, I was much

34:50.920 --> 34:55.920
more used to the long flight. And it wasn't really anywhere near as bad. But that first

34:55.920 --> 35:01.400
one, that first night there, I remember meeting Alan, her saying to me, man, you look like

35:01.400 --> 35:03.960
a zombie. And I was like, I feel like one.

35:03.960 --> 35:12.360
Oh, man. Yeah, I'm lucky enough that I don't have to travel quite as far. But that leads

35:12.360 --> 35:19.080
me, I guess, to a curiosity. How did you ever first get connected with JB and the network?

35:19.080 --> 35:23.360
That's a good question. Because the first podcast I ever listened to was the Linux Action

35:23.360 --> 35:26.440
Show. Not the Linux podcast, but the first podcast.

35:26.440 --> 35:27.440
Oh, wow.

35:27.440 --> 35:31.440
There was this thing called Groove Shark. I don't remember it. It was like free Spotify.

35:31.440 --> 35:32.960
I use Groove Shark.

35:32.960 --> 35:38.120
Yeah. And I had no idea why they got away with it and how they got away with it for

35:38.120 --> 35:44.400
so long. And eventually they got shut down. But I was listening to a lot of audio books

35:44.400 --> 35:49.680
at the time. And just getting into Linux, I suppose, and just type Linux in randomly

35:49.680 --> 35:55.600
and then, oh, what's this Linux Action Show? And then I worked out how to do the RSS feed

35:55.600 --> 36:00.800
and everything. And I think it was just when they were doing the Computer Action Show for

36:00.800 --> 36:04.920
a bit. They kind of tried that for a season and that didn't really go that well, I don't

36:04.920 --> 36:08.320
think. And so they went back to the Linux Action Show. And it was around then that I

36:08.320 --> 36:14.080
started listening. Yeah, then listened to a few JB shows and discovered Linux Outlaws

36:14.080 --> 36:19.560
and listened for a while. And then I kind of drifted away because there's so many Linux

36:19.560 --> 36:26.240
and I didn't have as much time to listen to stuff. And then I was concentrating on doing

36:26.240 --> 36:34.200
my own stuff. And then went on Linux Unplugged a little bit because my wife was away and

36:34.200 --> 36:38.260
so I could stay up late because she normally goes to bed around the time that LUP used

36:38.260 --> 36:42.920
to record. And so it was very difficult for me to go on there, but she was away. And so

36:42.920 --> 36:47.300
I went on and talked to Chris and that was around the time he was thinking about killing

36:47.300 --> 36:52.840
Linux Action Show and that he was thinking about doing this new show. And he actually

36:52.840 --> 36:58.920
asked someone else before me to do Linux Action News. I won't tell you who it is on air, but

36:58.920 --> 37:03.160
there is a person that I believe has been on Brunch with Brent, put it that way. But

37:03.160 --> 37:08.180
that person did not have time to do it. And Chris swears that he only asked that person

37:08.180 --> 37:13.760
to be polite, but I know he would have preferred that person to me. But anyway, that person

37:13.760 --> 37:18.280
recommended me knowing that I was looking to do more podcasts at the time. And then

37:18.280 --> 37:24.920
Chris and I connected and spoke for a couple of times actually for quite a long time, like

37:24.920 --> 37:28.300
over an hour, kind of thrashing out what we were going to do and whether it was going

37:28.300 --> 37:35.760
to be video and just eventually settled on not doing it live, it being audio only and

37:35.760 --> 37:37.800
focus on editing it properly.

37:37.800 --> 37:39.000
All good decisions, right?

37:39.000 --> 37:47.400
Well, I mean, that's what I went into it wanting. But I think that's what he ultimately wanted.

37:47.400 --> 37:53.480
He's spoken about how video, it was kind of all geared up towards video at one point due

37:53.480 --> 37:58.840
to broadcasting, but then he was kind of wanting to go more in the audio direction and focus

37:58.840 --> 38:05.920
on that. Because if you're focusing on video, it's very difficult to serve both audiences

38:05.920 --> 38:09.960
because you inevitably end up talking about things that are on the screen or you have

38:09.960 --> 38:14.480
visual jokes and stuff like that. And it means that the audio suffers as a result and the

38:14.480 --> 38:19.720
quality can suffer as well. So it was the direction that he wanted to go. It was the

38:19.720 --> 38:27.480
direction that I had been going and we kind of just aligned for that. And then when the

38:27.480 --> 38:36.520
Linux Academy acquisition merger thing happened, Chris took me on. And that was about 18 months

38:36.520 --> 38:42.720
ago because I got hired actually. I was the first to be hired because it's weird. Like

38:42.720 --> 38:47.040
I'm really badly organized. If you looked at my desk now, you'd just laugh at how terribly

38:47.040 --> 38:52.160
organized it is. But with some things, I'm really on it. And when it comes to that, it

38:52.160 --> 38:56.400
was like, right, let's make this happen. Let's have the contract. Let me read through it.

38:56.400 --> 39:01.400
Let's get it signed. And so I was the first of everyone to come on board. And at first,

39:01.400 --> 39:06.640
the first week or two, I didn't have all that much to do because things were still ramping

39:06.640 --> 39:12.080
up and everything. And so it was a bit weird, but it didn't take long before suddenly I

39:12.080 --> 39:17.800
was very busy once user error got going and especially then once Choose Linux got going.

39:17.800 --> 39:25.160
And so I'm now very, very busy with it. I basically work seven days a week, but not

39:25.160 --> 39:31.160
a full day every day, if you know what I mean. Well, does reading RSS feeds and news counters

39:31.160 --> 39:35.560
work? I guess it kind of does now. It's what I would probably be doing anyway, but I do

39:35.560 --> 39:37.360
at least a bit of that every day.

39:37.360 --> 39:42.920
It's almost like a lifestyle more so than a job or anything like that. You described

39:42.920 --> 39:51.080
earlier how you were kind of doing these things anyways. And so to have someone who's willing

39:51.080 --> 39:56.260
to bring you on and that's like getting paid for the things you're interested in previously

39:56.260 --> 40:00.920
and kind of diving into on your own time anyway. So it's kind of a sweet little spot to be

40:00.920 --> 40:03.600
in, I would say in many ways.

40:03.600 --> 40:09.280
So Joe, if you wanted to ask something of the community, maybe something you'd like

40:09.280 --> 40:15.600
them to do or think about, try, go and see. Is there something you would throw out there

40:15.600 --> 40:16.600
for them?

40:16.600 --> 40:24.080
One of the things, don't click on clickbait articles and videos and listicles and stuff.

40:24.080 --> 40:31.120
If it looks like clickbait, we have to vote with our mice and whatever it is that you

40:31.120 --> 40:36.120
click the clickbait with. The only way that it will ever go away is if people stop clicking

40:36.120 --> 40:41.760
on it. Now that is just a dream that will probably never, ever come true. But just stop

40:41.760 --> 40:46.680
doing that, especially in Linux content and stuff. And it's somewhat related to that.

40:46.680 --> 40:53.400
I want people to think more critically. I want people to kind of look at what is being

40:53.400 --> 40:59.720
said or what's happening and really think about it. Don't just take what some person's

40:59.720 --> 41:06.960
opinion is. If it's my opinion, don't just accept it. Think about why I'm saying it and

41:06.960 --> 41:12.360
do some research. You can't always do that, obviously, the research stuff, but you can

41:12.360 --> 41:17.040
at least think critically about why I'm saying what I'm saying.

41:17.040 --> 41:25.280
A prime example of this is the Microsoft situation. Microsoft, over the last, well, I don't know,

41:25.280 --> 41:30.080
five, 10 years, have become more and more involved with Linux and open source. Some

41:30.080 --> 41:37.440
people say M$ and are really resistant to them and think that anyone who says anything

41:37.440 --> 41:43.520
positive about them must be a shill or whatever, and there must be some motivation behind it.

41:43.520 --> 41:51.120
Whereas I find myself reporting the fact that Microsoft has been doing WSL and freeing up

41:51.120 --> 41:55.680
the ex fat patents and everything. And I asked myself, why are they doing that? Well, they're

41:55.680 --> 41:59.920
doing that to make more money because there is money to be made in Linux, especially with

41:59.920 --> 42:05.600
Azure. Driving people towards Azure is a real moneymaker for them, and they want developers

42:05.600 --> 42:12.320
and users to be using that. And it's just such an obvious thing to me. And when you

42:12.320 --> 42:18.840
see people, it's a very small minority of people saying things like people are shilling

42:18.840 --> 42:27.280
and stuff about that. Hayden Barnes, who works for Canonical now on the WSL stuff, he posted

42:27.280 --> 42:34.360
recently about some of the backlash and flack that he'd had from people calling him a shill

42:34.360 --> 42:42.680
and everything. And that really made me think about it. But also, just when people are asking

42:42.680 --> 42:48.240
for money for something, think critically about it. And I'm not going to name any names,

42:48.240 --> 42:55.320
but there are some obvious examples of this, that people are asking for money and not necessarily

42:55.320 --> 43:00.800
delivering on that. And look at people's track records or companies' track records on what

43:00.800 --> 43:08.040
they have delivered before making that decision to give them money, or give them time and

43:08.040 --> 43:13.900
talk about them. Just think more critically, try not to be as forgiving, because that's

43:13.900 --> 43:18.320
something that people who are involved with Linux and open source tend to be, at least

43:18.320 --> 43:26.880
desktop Linux, is very forgiving of what otherwise they wouldn't forgive in other areas of life.

43:26.880 --> 43:35.200
So yeah, think critically, don't click clickbait links and videos, and consider people's motivations.

43:35.200 --> 43:43.620
Yeah, I feel like that is a skill set. And, you know, part of what I really enjoy about,

43:43.620 --> 43:51.640
for instance, Linux Action News is sort of your insights there and your critical thinking

43:51.640 --> 43:55.440
on some of the news. You know, it's easy to just throw out the news on a blog post or

43:55.440 --> 44:01.520
in a podcast or something, but some of the background and the experience that you have

44:01.520 --> 44:06.280
to give context around that news feels really valuable. And so I guess the question I would

44:06.280 --> 44:13.360
put to you is, how do you cultivate critical thinking? You know, it's a skill that you

44:13.360 --> 44:14.360
need to build up.

44:14.360 --> 44:19.880
I think to some extent you do, but you need to start from a place that not everything

44:19.880 --> 44:25.280
is awesome and great and positive. And some people say, oh, you're being a negative, toxic

44:25.280 --> 44:29.600
person by saying that. But if you just take a step back and judge everything on its own

44:29.600 --> 44:35.080
merits, rather than assuming that everything is positive, then you're generally going to

44:35.080 --> 44:41.160
have more of a critical view of that and a critical not in a negative way, but a critical

44:41.160 --> 44:48.280
thinking way and judge things for what they really are rather than just everything's great.

44:48.280 --> 44:51.360
And let's just assume that it's all going to work out.

44:51.360 --> 44:56.160
Yeah, we've gotten in a lot of trouble in the world, you know, thinking it's just going

44:56.160 --> 45:02.000
to work out without putting our minds to it in a deep kind of meaningful way. So great

45:02.000 --> 45:08.080
advice. Thank you for sharing that. Joe, thank you so much for joining me. Thank you for

45:08.080 --> 45:13.960
your time. I know it's a little late for you out there as we speak. But I've really, really

45:13.960 --> 45:18.760
appreciated this. And I'm really, yeah, happy we can have a chat. So thank you.

45:18.760 --> 45:21.960
Yeah, we've been meaning to do it for a while. And we finally did it. So yeah, it's been

45:21.960 --> 45:22.960
great.

45:22.960 --> 45:40.560
Okay. Thanks so much.
