1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:21,920
After more than 2,000 miles, we've road tested a slew of tech and want to tell you about

2
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:26,840
what held up, what failed, what we loved, and what has to go.

3
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:32,440
The good and the bad of the tech, and that was Brent's best cowboy right there.

4
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:33,440
You did good, Brent.

5
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:34,440
Yee-haw.

6
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:35,440
Yee-haw!

7
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:36,440
Yee-haw!

8
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:44,520
So we had some things that worked, we had some things that didn't work on this road

9
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:48,400
trip, and it really was, we're stomping all over the west, and so it really does put things

10
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:52,540
to their paces because we decided like idiots to do it while it's hot, too.

11
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:53,540
Very hot, apparently.

12
00:00:53,540 --> 00:01:01,480
So I had to change even my measurement instrument kind of units of measurement to appreciate

13
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:02,480
the heat.

14
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:03,480
Now you know.

15
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:04,480
You know now.

16
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:09,320
I mean, it was, like today, it was 93 degrees, but of course the RV is a box in the sun.

17
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:10,320
It's a metal box.

18
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,520
So it gets really, really warm, so you're really constantly fighting it, and so stuff

19
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:15,080
got stress tested.

20
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:17,920
And we thought we'd talk about some of the things that worked.

21
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:21,760
And let's start with the, we got like a couple of sections, so let's start with the tech

22
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:26,440
in the RV itself, and then we'll talk about some of our podcasting tech and that kind

23
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:27,440
of stuff.

24
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:32,080
But the RV tech is probably the biggest area, enough so that when Brent came on board when

25
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:36,480
we were still back in the Seattle area, we had to give him a tour of the tech.

26
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:39,040
We have the most important thing on the tour, of course.

27
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:42,980
So this one is much like the system in the studio, but a little more, so you have lights

28
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:47,360
you can turn on and off, so if you were here or not, in fact, all we could do if you wanted

29
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:51,000
to is you could make a bookmark on your phone, so that way you could turn off some lights

30
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,440
up front or something like that if you wanted to.

31
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:54,440
Yeah, that would be great.

32
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:57,600
And then there's a lot of just quick access right here, so this has kind of been more

33
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:04,200
designed for the family, so you have a little bit of weather information, temperature information.

34
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,200
Interior temperatures, that's cool.

35
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,200
Humidity, yeah.

36
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:11,440
And then there's other weird things we can pull in here, too, like we can pull in the

37
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,360
piehole stats and we can see.

38
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,400
This is fun.

39
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,880
So there's 36 active network clients right now in the RV.

40
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,320
That's not bad for an RV, right?

41
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,320
Yeah, not bad at all.

42
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:26,000
There's not a lot going on, because most of the cameras are down, but some of the cameras,

43
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:34,240
you can pull them in here, but they don't record, and they're mostly offline.

44
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:36,600
Motion sensor information, but again, none of that's really all that really, what you're

45
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:40,400
gonna really care about would just be good stuff on that tablet.

46
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:45,320
And so you got them all labeled, so bedroom oil heater and extra heat.

47
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,320
Little icons.

48
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:47,320
Yeah.

49
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:48,480
Yeah, little icons.

50
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:51,960
This is basically like the same kind of tablet that we have at the studio, only just the

51
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:52,960
bigger version.

52
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:53,960
Yeah.

53
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:54,960
And then this is just a little, turn it off.

54
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:55,960
A power button.

55
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:58,080
Just so we know where it is, yeah.

56
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:03,240
That's all in Home Assistant, which is running on a Raspberry Pi 4, and it does things beyond

57
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:06,920
just some of the basics, like it does some of our automation in the heating and cooling

58
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:11,800
system, at nighttime and morning automations, temperature and humidity monitoring throughout

59
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,040
the RV.

60
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:16,040
It's sort of like the central brain of what's going on in the RV.

61
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:20,120
I really loved it because I could just sort of sneak back there every once in a while

62
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:24,120
when I got curious and see how all the systems are doing.

63
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:28,480
And mostly I was curious about the temperature of the little compartment up here that holds

64
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:29,480
all the electronics.

65
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:30,480
Yeah.

66
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:31,480
Yeah.

67
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:32,480
Watching that as we're going down the road was tricky.

68
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,480
And the server room, if you will.

69
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:34,480
Yeah, it is.

70
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,480
It is.

71
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:38,800
Also in that server room is a Plex instance running on that Raspberry Pi, and I do a little

72
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:42,720
refresh of the TV and the movies for the road trip before we go, so we put like the

73
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:48,200
mummy on there that, you know, all of them and updated some TV shows for the kids so

74
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:50,860
that way they'd have something to watch on the LAN when we're going through the passes

75
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:52,960
where we might not have connectivity.

76
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:57,020
And then another thing that I do is I run a local sync thing instance.

77
00:03:57,020 --> 00:04:01,120
And then, Brandon, I don't know if I've mentioned this to you before, but I also run an instance

78
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:05,840
in the studio, no surprise there, and I run an instance up in the cloud on the node.

79
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:10,760
And what I do is I kind of co sync stuff between those two things so I can pull down a file

80
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:15,520
from the Linode server and a file from the studio server at the same time.

81
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:20,240
And the way my router will balance it sometimes is I'm using different carriers to pull from

82
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,380
different servers.

83
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:26,360
So I can actually slam quite a bit of data onto and take data off of the RV servers that

84
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,360
way.

85
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,840
Yeah, I've been actually really impressed even in just the everyday browsing.

86
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:35,800
I know I was doing a little bit of work, which usually I'm running through my, you know,

87
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:41,120
cell phone and has a single source, but it was really behaving nicely.

88
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,680
I know you've got this, well, you call it your fuse kind of tunnel.

89
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:45,680
Yeah, fusion tunnel.

90
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,680
Yeah.

91
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:47,680
Yeah.

92
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:51,240
Well, it all really is made possible by my PEP wave, I have a PEP wave max transit.

93
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:53,440
And that's bringing in a couple of carriers together.

94
00:04:53,440 --> 00:05:00,460
And then it creates as an option, a bonded VPN that bonds those carriers into one connection.

95
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:05,680
And then it is constantly monitoring the latency and performance of the different cellular

96
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:09,840
providers and figuring out what is the best route for traffic and whatnot.

97
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:15,040
And so if there is signal to be had because the antenna is mounted on the roof and it's,

98
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,800
you know, it's a pretty strong antenna.

99
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,800
If there is signal to be had that system will load balance it.

100
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:26,600
But then another part of my philosophy around making cellular connectivity feel faster is

101
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:30,960
to use little tricks whenever you can to not use the cellular connection.

102
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:36,720
So if you can have something on the LAN like DNS or the files that you're looking for or

103
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:40,640
a local cache, then you don't need to go out to the LTE connection.

104
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:43,520
So an example of that is we have PiHole running here.

105
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:47,120
We have a dedicated Raspberry Pi that just runs PiHole.

106
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:52,300
And it also is the, as a function of that, it is the DHCP server of the network.

107
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:58,160
And that serves as blocking at the network level, a whole bunch of like banner ads and

108
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:02,960
junk and tracking scripts that we just don't need to waste network traffic with.

109
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:07,440
I would imagine with the number of devices running here at any one time while we're rolling

110
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:10,440
down the road, that probably saves quite a bit of bandwidth.

111
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:15,120
Do you have any idea of kind of how many ads or any, any kind of metric around that?

112
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,440
I do get a lot of metrics from the PiHole box.

113
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:24,200
It's surprising because, you know, every little stinking box, every little smart box or IoT

114
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:27,620
device, they all love to phone home.

115
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:30,640
And the PiHole blocks a ton of those.

116
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:34,920
Like so right now it looks like there are 98,000 domains on the block list.

117
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:42,240
And out of the queries that we've done in a 24 hour period, it's blocked 5,499.

118
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,240
It's working.

119
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,240
Yeah.

120
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:47,560
And that's stuff that would never have, you know, that's all, that's 5,000, that's six,

121
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:50,760
almost 5,500 requests that would have gone out over the network.

122
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:56,040
And can I ask why you have this on a dedicated box, a little Pi, but you have a bunch of

123
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:59,880
other stuff running on a single other Pi.

124
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:05,580
Network services, you know, like DHCP and DNS, I want them to be online when the other

125
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:07,480
systems are rebooting.

126
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:12,020
And so I can reboot the Home Assistant Pi that also has Plex and SyncThing and Duplicati

127
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:17,000
and a bunch of other services that measure network latency and stuff like Smokeping.

128
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,320
And anyways, I can run all of that on one Pi.

129
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:24,520
And if I keep the network services on a separate box, then I can reboot them independently

130
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:25,800
and they don't affect each other really.

131
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:29,640
And so when I, and when I restart the Pi that has all of the different services on there,

132
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:34,200
when it comes back online, I want DHCP and I want DNS to all be available for those services.

133
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:39,360
So I've done the, I've done the power math and decided to, you know, spend the power

134
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,480
on another Pi.

135
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:45,140
And I say that quite seriously, because if you think about it, these things run 24 seven.

136
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:48,640
And so even if they're only pulling, you know, 15, 20 Watts or whatever it is, it's a tiny

137
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:50,900
amount for these Raspberry Pis.

138
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:56,080
It adds up 24 seven and it means less runtime on our batteries.

139
00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:03,560
And a big special thank you to Linode for making this road trip possible, for helping

140
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:06,120
with the reunion and for literally putting gas in our tank.

141
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:09,960
Go to colonytracker.live to get $100 in credit at Linode.

142
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:21,560
That's how we host everything.

143
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:29,840
Now you mentioned, well, you didn't quite mention solar, but I think you were headed

144
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,120
in that direction there.

145
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,800
There was some implications of solar, I think.

146
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:35,560
There was some power saving.

147
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:41,000
I'm curious to know what you think, because I've kind of normalized living off grid now,

148
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,440
as weird as that sounds.

149
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:45,960
I'm used to doing like the power dance to make sure we're not using too much power and

150
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:46,960
to keep an eye on the batteries.

151
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:52,880
But yeah, we've got about 1300 Watts of solar up on the roof of lady jupes.

152
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:56,380
That comes into 600 amp hours of battle born lithium batteries.

153
00:08:56,380 --> 00:09:01,240
And then there's a Victron inverter charge controller system that manages all of that.

154
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,600
And I love it.

155
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:06,600
To me, it is like one of my favorite things about the RV.

156
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:11,720
You know, while we were in Denver, we were parked for eight days off grid, eight days

157
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,800
of running off of battery and solar.

158
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:20,840
Thankfully it was unbelievably hot and there was a lot of solar radiation that the RV could

159
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:21,840
soak up.

160
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:26,320
But I'm curious from your perspective, because I mean, not only was this sort of like your

161
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:30,400
first road trip around America's West, but I imagine it's probably one of your first

162
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,040
solar powered road trips as well.

163
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:33,040
It really is.

164
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:37,120
And I've been curious before, but never had the hands on experience.

165
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:41,160
And I think what's interesting is that perspective you talked about, which is that you're like

166
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:43,880
in the nuts and bolts of all these systems.

167
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:48,160
And I'm really just coming in turnkey and operating the stuff.

168
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:56,280
And so I think one thing I found really interesting was having to learn what Watts matter.

169
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:59,040
I didn't really care before because I never had to.

170
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:02,480
But all of a sudden, when you're on solar and when you have that fancy display that

171
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:06,760
you've got there that shows sort of where all the power is routing, it was really neat

172
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:07,760
to watch.

173
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:10,340
But also it makes you care about what you're consuming.

174
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:15,720
So we've been very, very careful about when to run the toaster oven, you know.

175
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:18,720
The other thing that's been a challenge on this trip, like it was in our Texas trip,

176
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,160
is managing the heat.

177
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:27,420
Because inverting a lot of power, say to run the air conditioning, generates a lot of heat.

178
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:31,560
And then where the batteries are at, which is in the lower chassis area of the RV, that's

179
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:36,440
near the drivetrain, which when you're driving down the road and it's 100 degrees outside,

180
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:38,120
generates a lot of heat.

181
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:42,120
And so it turns out that we kept finding ourselves in these positions where we were managing

182
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:44,980
temperature states way more than I'd like to.

183
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:49,600
And so definitely one of the things that is on my mind now is how to get some sort of

184
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:54,160
automated cooling system into that battery bay that doesn't expose it to the elements

185
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:59,720
of outside and doesn't damage anything by installing it, but is a way that I can flip

186
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:04,360
a switch on the dash or have home assistant kick in when a certain temperature is reached

187
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:05,500
and start cooling it.

188
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:10,120
Because there were times when it was 100 degrees out and we couldn't run our air conditioning

189
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:16,100
because the combination of the heat outside plus the recent driving and the inversion

190
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:19,280
load meant it was too much heat generated.

191
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:20,280
That's a pain in the butt.

192
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:24,140
You mentioned this dance that you were doing and I remember some of the stops that we made

193
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:29,160
on the side of the road at these rest stops and it was almost more stressful for you to

194
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:35,400
be stopped than driving because of that balance between heat from, you know, the concrete

195
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:40,240
that we were on, but also the heat the engines producing, the heat the inverters are producing,

196
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:44,900
the heat that's in the RV and then you got the air conditioning to try to kind of balance

197
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:45,900
all that.

198
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:46,900
So you were just...

199
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:47,960
While the sun's beating down on you.

200
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:53,040
It is a lot and when you're, at least when you're going, when you're moving, the alternator

201
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:58,360
is generating some current, so it's, you're not, you're not inverting very much and you're

202
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:03,260
generating power and you can turn on the dash air conditioning.

203
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:06,000
So thankfully every now and then we could get somewhere, we could, we could fire up

204
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,720
the generator and if we bypassed charging the batteries and if we bypassed inverting

205
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:14,740
power from the batteries and just took it from the generator, we could run the air conditioning

206
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:17,660
because there was no inversion, there was no charging, it was just straight generator

207
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:22,320
power to air conditioning and that worked, but you can only do that in certain circumstances.

208
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,440
So it was a lot.

209
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:26,820
The power system overall though, in terms of what it's designed to do, which is power

210
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:30,440
the RV and keep us going, it performed exceptionally well actually.

211
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:34,420
I mean the temperature, the heat stuff is, I mean it's a hundred degrees outside and

212
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:37,680
it's right next to the engine and the transmission and all that kind of stuff.

213
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:41,680
So there are, there are things I could do to improve the thermal situation, but at the

214
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:46,520
end of the day when it's so hot outside and you're inverting 3000 watts of power to run

215
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:50,520
two air conditioners, you're just running into a physics thing there.

216
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:53,080
As far as like those BattleBorn batteries, they held up.

217
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:58,080
I mean, you know, we'd go park somewhere at night and we wouldn't really worry about it.

218
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:02,360
We would just run our noise makers and have our televisions on and lights on and we'd

219
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:06,160
be sitting outside in the parking lot, wherever we were at watching TV on the outdoor television,

220
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:10,120
all running off of battery, pretty much knowing that the next day we'd get enough solar and

221
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:12,200
drive time to charge it all back up.

222
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:16,560
You know, I think, I was just thinking, I never once worried about running out and I

223
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:21,160
think that just says that you guys are experts at managing all these systems.

224
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:24,840
Never once did we go under like 30% or anything like that, even overnight.

225
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:33,480
So I think, I think we did pretty good.

226
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:36,200
Now let's talk about something you could use in any vehicle.

227
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:40,640
And I think it is criminal that they're not, it's not, this information isn't just already

228
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:44,200
displayed on larger vehicles, but when I'm going down the road or especially when I'm

229
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,440
climbing passes, I'd like all the data.

230
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:48,440
I want to know what my intake air temperature is.

231
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:49,800
I want to know what my coolant temperature is.

232
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,600
I want to know what my cylinder head temperatures are.

233
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,640
I want to know what my transmission temperature is.

234
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:55,360
I want to know if my engine's misfiring.

235
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,240
I want to know what my brake temperatures are, right?

236
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:59,280
I want to know all the data.

237
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:04,080
And the thing is, it's very frustrating about this, is a lot of car computers have all this

238
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:05,080
information.

239
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:07,720
They're just not showing it to you.

240
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:12,000
And that is inexcusable when you're operating a 25,000 pound vehicle.

241
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,600
You need that information.

242
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:18,200
And that's why I got this little ODB2 plug.

243
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:22,860
Mine's called the VP01, the V peak, V E E peak.

244
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:26,680
And you plug it into the ODB2 port of your vehicle's computer.

245
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:29,440
It creates a wifi network.

246
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:33,480
You join, they recommend an iOS device, but you can use an Android device as well.

247
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:35,560
You join that wifi network.

248
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:37,940
You're the only device on that network, right?

249
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:40,960
And then you launch an app, a reader app.

250
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:45,820
In my case, I use ODB Fusion, which is fantastic.

251
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:48,760
And it really lets you customize the hell out of it.

252
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:49,760
It connects.

253
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:50,760
That app connects.

254
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:54,420
It reads all the computer PIDs, all the things that the computer is capable of relaying.

255
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:58,760
And then it allows you to build a series of dashboards of temperature gauges and recreate

256
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:03,120
all of the stuff that should be just built into the damn dashboard.

257
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:07,040
And I have an iPad Pro that mounts onto my dash.

258
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:12,000
And then all of that information comes streaming into my iPad and I can monitor so much stuff

259
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,900
with that, that it is, I think, an absolutely essential part of by driving.

260
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:19,080
And it's just nuts that you don't have it in there.

261
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,280
And so I totally recommend these.

262
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:22,920
They also have Bluetooth models, depending on what you need.

263
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:25,600
And those work with a wider range of devices.

264
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:29,360
If you don't have anything in there now, you can plug this into your ODB2 port and get

265
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:33,400
all this information, including diagnostic information, if there's ever air codes and

266
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,400
stuff.

267
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:38,920
I was really impressed when I saw this dashboard and you and I just were kind of staring at

268
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:40,920
it for a while, just taking in all the information.

269
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:48,640
I think for people like us who generally like Linux-y things, this speaks to us.

270
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:53,360
But just that I think you would agree with this, just the more information you can get

271
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:58,400
about the rig, the more you can understand how to better operate the rig and to make

272
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:59,400
it last longer.

273
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:00,400
Yep.

274
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:01,400
Yeah.

275
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:03,580
My goal when I'm driving this thing is not to be stressing out the engine a whole bunch

276
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:05,400
because I want it to last.

277
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,700
And that information makes it vital.

278
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:10,520
We also have a live tracker on board.

279
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:15,920
This uses OwnTrax that runs on a Linode instance, and that is where we generate the embeddable

280
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:18,540
web page and it does all of the logging.

281
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:23,760
And then there is an OwnTrax client that runs on my Android device that updates over HTTP

282
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:29,020
any time the Android OS detects what they call significant movement.

283
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:30,020
Did we define that yet?

284
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:33,460
I don't think so, but I think it's basically when it gets moved.

285
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:35,480
You can also turn on precise motion tracking.

286
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:36,480
And that's been awesome.

287
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:40,280
People have used that to track us down and we've done micro meetups as we call them with

288
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:42,480
folks and they use the live map.

289
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,880
And I just turn it on and set it and forget it.

290
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:47,960
You know, as long as the Android device is powered up and OwnTrax is running in the background,

291
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:50,380
it's logging our location in real time.

292
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:54,840
And OwnTrax supports, you could have multiple vehicles, you could do this, everyone in your

293
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:57,560
family could have that if that's your thing.

294
00:16:57,560 --> 00:17:00,440
You don't have to use it to actually make the information public.

295
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:08,840
It's just what we do.

296
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:10,120
You want to talk about audio gear?

297
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:11,840
Because that's really the whole reason we're here.

298
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:13,920
And I see a lot of it right in front of you now.

299
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:18,780
We haven't gotten any of our failures and unfortunately, this is where the ugly part

300
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:20,080
comes in.

301
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:26,200
For the first time ever, our handy Zoom H4 portable recorders gave us various problems.

302
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:29,960
Yeah, this was on I think night number one even.

303
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:35,640
We were trying to record some stuff and thinking about how the rest of the trip would be recorded

304
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:37,640
and setting ourselves up.

305
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:44,040
And I think to our surprise, one of the ports was really, really, really noisy to the point

306
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:47,760
where we just had to stroke it off the list for the rest of the trip.

307
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,800
And I think you were pretty disappointed about that.

308
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:50,800
Yeah.

309
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:53,160
And then the other Zoom that we had was having SD card problems.

310
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,160
Remember that?

311
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,160
Oh, yeah.

312
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:56,160
Yeah.

313
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,840
Haven't had file system problems on SD cards in a while, but sure enough, it wouldn't even

314
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:01,560
format it and we put different ones in there.

315
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:02,840
It was stressful, actually.

316
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:10,280
We were worried it was starting to actually wreck the SD card, but what did work out really

317
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:16,120
well is once we got basically one good working by connecting the, I guess, frankensteining

318
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:19,800
the two of them together, you could say about what worked really well with them was our

319
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:22,240
Sennheiser MD 46 mics.

320
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:23,640
They just rocked loud environments.

321
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:28,520
Yeah, this is a microphone that we ended up choosing for my voice for some of the recordings

322
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:33,240
that I've been doing, the brunches and all of the stuff for Linux Unplugged, but it turns

323
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:36,340
out this is a really great microphone for on location stuff.

324
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:40,240
And did we ever put it to its paces?

325
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:48,480
We tested it in system 76 as sort of production environment, factory noises, ovens, and like

326
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:52,160
loud mills and stuff, and it performed wonderfully.

327
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:55,560
Not to mention the meetup that we had in Denver.

328
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:57,520
I thought that was going to...

329
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:58,520
I wasn't even...

330
00:18:58,520 --> 00:18:59,520
There was live music.

331
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:04,200
There was, I mean, 90 in our group and then probably another couple of hundred people

332
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,680
that were just there having a good time.

333
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:10,940
Yeah, you and I were, our voices were super tired after that event because we had to just

334
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:16,400
keep them at a high pace to try to have people hear us, but listening back to some of the

335
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:21,480
recordings that we made and they're very surprisingly clear, so this microphone started shining

336
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:22,480
for us.

337
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:26,720
Yeah, if you ever need a mobile microphone, you can throw in your bag, you can count on

338
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:29,800
it in noisy environments, the MD-46 is it.

339
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:31,320
We are in a noisy environment right now.

340
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:33,360
You can probably hear some of it in the background.

341
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:34,360
We're still here in Colorado.

342
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:38,040
We're at a campground and this is just one of the last things we're recording before

343
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:39,040
we head out.

344
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:41,940
And even for an environment like this, it works pretty well and Brent and I are sitting

345
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:43,280
next to each other.

346
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:47,160
But in the RV, that setup was really simple and effective.

347
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:50,340
It's like a portable recorder and a microphone.

348
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:53,560
Maybe we throw in a phone every now and then if we need to capture some B-roll audio or

349
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:54,560
something.

350
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:58,000
But in the RV, that's where we're doing the big shows, right?

351
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:02,320
We're doing the live stream and we're doing the day to day production stuff.

352
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:06,220
So in the RV, we have RE-320 microphones, although when Brent's here, he actually still

353
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:08,720
uses the MD-46 because he sounds great with it.

354
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,680
I prefer my microphone.

355
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:11,680
Yeah.

356
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:17,200
And I have a Rode Procaster mixer that is a really slick four channel mixer that also

357
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:23,120
brings in USB, phone audio and Bluetooth in just the coolest way possible.

358
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:26,160
But it has a built-in soundboard, which is a lot of fun for me.

359
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:31,520
The only downside to that is the Linux support sucks pretty bad.

360
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:32,520
Oh no.

361
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:33,520
Yeah.

362
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:37,360
You can get it as a stereo device, but for a 40 day road trip or whatever it's going

363
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:42,400
to be, I'm only halfway through right now, so I'm not sure, but for a long road trip,

364
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,120
you need something that's multi-track.

365
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:48,280
So that way you're on your own track, the soundboard, remote people.

366
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:55,360
And so I did all the math I could and realized, all right, for this trip, my fastest, best

367
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:58,080
machine is going to be a MacBook.

368
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:03,160
And this is the first time I've gone on a long trip like this where I brought my Thinkpad,

369
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:06,280
but it's not set up in any way to do remote broadcast.

370
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:08,080
It's just in a rough shape.

371
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:12,320
The install's in a rough shape and it doesn't do the multi-track with the Rode Procaster.

372
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:18,080
However, that meant that I took essentially an untested weapon into battle.

373
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:23,800
I'm pausing because that makes my sort of blood boil a little bit, makes me very uncomfortable.

374
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,680
It was a dumb thing to do, Brent.

375
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:28,360
And well, how did it go?

376
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:29,360
Let's start there.

377
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:34,960
The first couple of weeks were really frustrating because I think the Mac, when you don't use

378
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:38,060
it a lot, it does a lot of stuff when it first boots up.

379
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:41,440
And when you're on limited connectivity, it doesn't have an opportunity to do all that

380
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:42,440
stuff.

381
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:44,640
And so it just stretched it out over days.

382
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:49,140
And I would be sitting here trying to do a Koda radio or a Linux unplugged live and it's

383
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:54,520
using up all of my available bandwidth, syncing stuff in the background, copying files, processing

384
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:57,480
faces and photos, like just all this stuff.

385
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:02,520
I just kept sitting here thinking if this was a Linux box, I could kill these processes

386
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:04,360
or they just would never happen, right?

387
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:05,520
It just would never be going on.

388
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:06,740
And it was driving me nuts.

389
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:13,920
And I ultimately ended up through a combination of removing some stuff, turning off some settings

390
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:20,000
and installing a local firewall and then just denying outbound access to the bunch of stuff.

391
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Mad man.

392
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,840
I managed to get it under control after two weeks and now it's doing pretty good.

393
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:27,040
You know, it's fine.

394
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:29,980
What really saves it is I can still use Reaper to record the audio.

395
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:33,880
So that's really nice because that's the same app I would be using on Linux, but it gets

396
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:35,380
the multitrack support.

397
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:39,500
The MVP of the setup is the iPad Pro, surprisingly.

398
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:43,080
Because it has its own LTE connectivity, it can do a bunch of stuff on there that doesn't

399
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:44,160
affect our remote connection.

400
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:46,760
And when bandwidth is tight, that really matters.

401
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:49,400
Additionally, it can act as a second monitor to the MacBook.

402
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:54,680
So I can actually throw windows from the Mac over there, but I can also bring up chat rooms.

403
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:56,920
I can bring up our restream dashboard.

404
00:22:56,920 --> 00:23:01,160
I can bring up mixer controls via WireGuard from the studio mixer.

405
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:07,140
And then I have this iPad mounted on a stand that puts it floating above my physical mixer.

406
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:09,620
So I have my local physical mixer in front of me.

407
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:14,640
And then on the iPad, floating in the air, I have a software version of the studio's

408
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,380
mixer, which I use while we're live.

409
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:21,000
And that setup has just killed it because the iPad's on its own connection, it's not

410
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:25,360
taking any bandwidth, and I can use it to remotely control a mixer in Seattle while

411
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:26,360
I'm in Colorado.

412
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:28,720
The little buttons move in the studio, too.

413
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:29,720
There's no one there to see it.

414
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:33,440
Yeah, if you were there, you'd see the motorized sliders and stuff.

415
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:34,600
It's so great.

416
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:36,240
And WireGuard's a big part of that, too.

417
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:39,280
And I know WireGuard's work has been really critical for you as well.

418
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:46,160
Yeah, I, you know, in my travels, I'm always thinking about all the random networks that

419
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:47,160
I'm connecting to.

420
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:51,200
I will say typically, I like to connect to just one cell network, the one, you know,

421
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:55,080
that I usually use a Ting SIM card in my phone.

422
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:58,920
But for some reason, this trip, that has not worked very well for me.

423
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:00,200
And you saw me suffer, Chris.

424
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:05,200
I was trying to connect to any sort of cell towers I could, and I was just failing all

425
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,200
the time.

426
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:10,040
Now, I don't really have much equipment to do anything about that.

427
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:12,920
But thankfully, there's Wi-Fi networks all over.

428
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:16,760
And that makes me really nervous because I don't like connecting any of my devices to

429
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:18,280
networks that I don't really know.

430
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:25,020
So I have a WireGuard server that I simply use for just like this situation, VPN connecting

431
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:29,760
so that I can tunnel out of somewhere into a place that I feel a little bit better.

432
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:33,080
In my case, it's in Toronto, so feels close to home.

433
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:38,000
And having that on all my devices and work flawlessly has been quite amazing.

434
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
So thank you, WireGuard.

435
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:46,600
Yeah, being able to have the same VPN on mobile and on my desktop and on my servers is just

436
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:48,000
so, so great.

437
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,440
And I'm thankful that the iOS WireGuard app is decent.

438
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:55,560
And I'm thankful that WireGuard is so good on Linux.

439
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:59,960
I have a WireGuard instance that runs up at Linode that I can connect to, which is

440
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:04,720
what I use for browsing and just trying to like get a different online presence to avoid

441
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:10,020
carrier smashing, which sometimes with some of our VoIP software, carrier smashing really

442
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:11,020
messes with our connectivity.

443
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:14,560
And if I route through a WireGuard tunnel up to Linode, I can get out to their general

444
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:15,560
internet.

445
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:16,560
And guess what?

446
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:17,560
All of a sudden, it's problem free.

447
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:18,560
Beautiful.

448
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:19,560
Yeah.

449
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:22,360
And then I have a WireGuard server running at the studio, obviously, which is how I get

450
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:26,200
in to control the mixer or operate with the server there in the studio, which I connect

451
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:28,360
to about once a day and do some stuff.

452
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,520
And that has been fantastic.

453
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:34,440
And then what I'll do is if it's something that's like a lot of files, I batch process

454
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:35,480
that offsite with SyncThing.

455
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:38,680
I don't transfer that over WireGuard like through whatever, SCP or whatever.

456
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:43,580
I throw that on the SyncThing server and that takes its time as bandwidth is available and

457
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:44,580
sends it all off.

458
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:48,880
And, you know, that's been pretty handy because there has been times where we've captured

459
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:53,160
a whole bunch of footage or a whole bunch of audio and you need a way that's reasonable

460
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:58,100
to get it off of your system and offsite that doesn't crush your LTE connection.

461
00:25:58,100 --> 00:26:01,200
So little tricks like that have been really nice.

462
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:05,420
Kind of bringing it all together has really, I think, been the secret sauce of this trip.

463
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:09,200
It's a lot of moving pieces, I think even more so than all the systems that run the

464
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,700
RV.

465
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:14,760
But that's those are the systems that allow us to get the work done.

466
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:18,560
And I've been impressed to watch you juggle all of those systems.

467
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:19,620
Oh, man.

468
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:22,780
It's been a lot for this trip just because of the heat and a lot of tearing up, tearing

469
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:27,680
down and setting up stuff and a lot of moving, moving and every, you know, every few days

470
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:30,280
we're moving, if not days in a row, we're moving.

471
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:34,420
I think it's been a good test of your systems because you've had to tear them up or build

472
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:36,380
them up and tear them down.

473
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:41,800
And you've come, I think even tonight, you've come to a slightly better version of your

474
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:42,800
setup.

475
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:43,800
Yeah.

476
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:44,800
Every time we kind of iterate a little bit.

477
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:45,800
Yeah.

478
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:48,920
It's one of those things like just by the time you're almost done doing it, you become

479
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:49,920
an expert.

480
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:50,920
Yeah.

481
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:53,420
You know, there's so much more we could talk about.

482
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:59,700
We have more specials from the road that we have planned soon on our West Coast expedition.

483
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:03,320
Of course, Brent and I are going to wrap it up here and my road trip continues on.

484
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:07,780
