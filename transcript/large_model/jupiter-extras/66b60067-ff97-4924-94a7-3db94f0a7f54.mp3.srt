00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,280
Hello, everyone. This is Brunch with Brent. I'm so pleased to be joined today by Elizabeth

2
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:19,640
Kate Joseph. Liz, how are you doing today? Thank you so much for joining me.

3
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:21,120
Yeah, I'm doing good.

4
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:25,760
So for those who don't know you, you're currently a developer advocate at IBM. And I think you've

5
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:28,240
been there a little while now. Is that right?

6
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:33,440
That's right. I started at the end of April last year, which means for me, I've been there

7
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:37,840
a little while. But whenever I talk to other IBMers, they're all like, Oh, you're new.

8
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:38,840
Okay.

9
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:43,200
It's all about, you know, how you like I know some people move around quite a bit. It sounds

10
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:49,440
like you've done that. And I will bring us into a little bit of your history. You've

11
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:54,280
touched a lot of different things, which we'll dive into. But for others, yes, sit and sit

12
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:59,320
and sit tight. I guess IBM has a reputation for that. You know, having been in the same

13
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:02,560
place for a decade is not unheard of right at the IBM crew.

14
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:08,300
Yeah. And I wouldn't say I've moved around a lot, like every two to four years, really.

15
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:13,940
So I get myself like settled in. And maybe I'll stay with IBM for longer. But yeah.

16
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:17,340
That sounds pretty reasonable. Like there's something about seeing different cultures

17
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:25,300
and different ways that projects and corporations and companies run things that I think is really

18
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:31,280
a wonderful way to inform the work that you're doing. So I'm, I'm not against jumping around

19
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,720
at all. Well, says the freelancer.

20
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:38,660
Yeah. And since I work on a lot of open source software, it's been interesting to be able

21
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:42,920
to work on different projects. And some of it I do for fun. And some of it I do for paid

22
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:47,880
work. So it's been interesting to be able to mix that up a bit as I go through my different

23
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:48,880
roles.

24
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:53,000
Right. Could you walk us through then some of the things that you've done for fun?

25
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:59,320
Yeah. So I have like this sort of stereotypical like nerd in high school, I had my own computer,

26
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:06,880
I started like saving up my like my little work jobs I had as a kid, like, I'd save up

27
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:10,620
my money, and I'd buy a new computer and I'd play around with it. And I wasn't really doing

28
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:16,560
programming at the time. But that's kind of what got me into the space of playing around

29
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:22,640
with computers and eventually into my career. So I'd say like, the first interesting thing

30
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:30,200
I did was like, I built an IRC server. And then I was this was like the geo city days.

31
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:34,120
So I was like building my own websites. And one of the things that building my own website

32
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:39,840
in the late 90s showed me is that HTML is all open source, like on websites. And so

33
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:45,480
I was able to look at source code on websites and then build my own website. And those of

34
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:50,080
us who were building websites at the time, this was very common. We were totally just

35
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:54,040
like stealing each other's codes all the time, as soon as we found some new cool one. And

36
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:58,000
of course, I was like, in high school. So it wasn't cool. It was like, I don't know,

37
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:04,520
blinking and Java and like really weird things. But that sort of like was a segue into me

38
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:10,540
starting to get involved with open source. So I did my first open source project commit

39
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:17,200
in like, probably around 2004 or so. And it was to an instant messaging gateway called

40
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:24,360
Biddlebee. And I instant messengers, you know, from back in the day, like ICQ and AOL instant

41
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:29,240
messenger. They were huge back then, right? They were like how we spoke to each other.

42
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:34,840
Oh, yeah, I remember that it was massive. Yeah. And Biddlebee put all of those protocols

43
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:40,080
into your IRC client, because I was using IRC a lot. And I still do. So it's kind of

44
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:44,160
aggregating all of those technologies in one place. Yeah. So all my messages came to my

45
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:49,920
IRC client. And it was so great. That's so lovely. Do you remember what that first commit

46
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:55,580
was like was actually just documentation. So what I had done is I joined the IRC channel

47
00:03:55,580 --> 00:04:00,320
for that project. And I sat there for like a month, like, because I was very shy. And

48
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:06,380
I was scared of contributing. And the project leader was like, we need to update the Quick

49
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:13,160
Start. And I was like, oh, how hard can that be? Okay. Turns out it was written in doc

50
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:20,240
book. And it was really hard. And I like doubled the length of the Quick Start. And he's like,

51
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:25,680
Liz, this isn't so quick anymore. And I'm like, I know, I'm sorry. But I put it in.

52
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:30,960
And like, that was my first insight. I didn't actually do like, there wasn't like GitHub

53
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:34,940
or anything at the time. So I really just like emailed my patch to the project lead.

54
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:38,280
And then he put it in. And then he put my name in the readme for the next release. And

55
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:46,080
that was like, the most proud moment of my life up until then. I was like, that's me.

56
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:54,280
Yeah, that must feel so cool. I strangely admit that I haven't had that feeling yet.

57
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:58,600
Because I haven't had that experience. And now you're making me want to go chase it.

58
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:03,020
It meant a lot. And I mean, going on from there, I ended up meeting the project leader.

59
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:06,460
He worked for Google, actually. And my husband, who was my boyfriend at the time, was working

60
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:11,000
for Google. So he was meeting him in the office. And I was like, oh, I need to go and meet

61
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:16,240
him. And now we're friends. It's just been since forever. And that's really a key part

62
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:20,220
of my open source journey, too, is the relationships that I've built along the way.

63
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:27,800
Well said. I feel like open source is relationships. There's no way any of it could happen without

64
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:34,760
relationships. And you've seen that repeatedly since 2004. So it sounds like, yeah, that's

65
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:41,920
a huge part. And so in terms of relationships, how do you feel like those sort of get established?

66
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:46,060
Like for someone who is just starting out maybe with their first commits or those kind

67
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:49,120
of things, what's the best way to kind of develop those?

68
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:55,240
Yeah, it ends up just happening organically. So I eventually started working in the Debian

69
00:05:55,240 --> 00:06:00,520
project and the Ubuntu project as well. And these were still things I was doing for fun.

70
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:05,720
Debian sort of became part of my job at some point. I was developing packages and putting

71
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:11,280
together packages to be included in Debian as part of my paid work when I got my first

72
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:18,760
sysadmin job. So in those roles, I would work with mentors in the community to do my technical

73
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:22,760
work. And eventually, they sort of became friends because you talk about your packages

74
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:26,880
and you talk about your work. And in these days, it was a lot of IRC. Today, you may

75
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:33,440
be using some other chat protocol. But as you're working through technical things, you

76
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:39,400
also talk about your cats and you talk about your dogs. And then you just start getting

77
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:42,880
to know, oh, and sorry, my kid had to be in this video call. And then they're like, oh,

78
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:49,120
you meet their kids. And so over time, one of the things that I started doing is going

79
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:54,840
to events. So in the Ubuntu community, we used to have an Ubuntu developer summit, which

80
00:06:54,840 --> 00:07:00,040
was twice a year. And at these events, we would all get together in one city, community

81
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:03,840
members and people who worked for Canonical. And that's really how we got to know each

82
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:09,120
other. So we'd work on things all day long, and then we'd go out and have dinner together

83
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:15,880
and just enjoy each other's company. And through that, I made a lot of friends who I still

84
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:19,200
hang out with today and still communicate with, even though we've all gone our separate

85
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:26,480
ways, essentially, we still are socially friendly. So for one, yeah, just like being social in

86
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:31,760
chat, and two, going to the in person events, of which there are actually more of them now

87
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:32,760
than when I started.

88
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:38,560
Yeah, there are so many of them now. And, you know, I think maybe this is on everyone's

89
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:45,560
minds. But I was I was just took a peek earlier at at your website, which is PrincessLeia.com,

90
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:49,880
I think, which is great. And we'll talk about that maybe a little bit. But on there, you

91
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:55,040
have a list of the events you're you're attending this year. And I noticed that you now have

92
00:07:55,040 --> 00:08:02,160
a bunch of them crossed off for this whole virus thing that's going around. And I would

93
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,400
imagine that feels kind of sad to you.

94
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:10,720
Yeah, it's it's been hard. I mean, partially, it's because my job is mostly going and speaking.

95
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:17,480
And now I have like two months where I get to stay home, which is very unusual for me.

96
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:21,400
And in some ways, it's sad because I'm going to miss those events. I'm going to miss connecting

97
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:26,820
with people in that way. In other ways, I have my huge backlog of stuff that I'm really

98
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:33,160
excited just to sit home and work on now like blog posts, and like video tutorials and some

99
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:37,360
code patterns. And I'm like, Oh my gosh, I can finally get to my backlog because I'm

100
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:41,480
not out speaking all the time. So it's kind of a mixed bag, honestly.

101
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,960
Yeah, both can be true.

102
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:47,560
Yeah, but it's I mean, it's all for the best. And I hopefully this passes quickly.

103
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:53,040
Yeah, we'll see what happens. But I agree with you completely. Like, and I've mentioned

104
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:58,640
that before how meeting people, you know, through some of these technologies, you know,

105
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:06,320
that we have to sort of meet online through video, audio, you know, all the text forms,

106
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:12,080
but there's nothing like meeting in person. And so if anyone hasn't had the opportunity

107
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:15,440
to do that with anybody, even like a group of three people who meet in your town who

108
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:20,000
are interested in Linux, like, I think that's probably what's been really great for you,

109
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:25,320
right? Is that those those developers and people in the community that you met just

110
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:32,800
by being involved, necessarily all have something in common. And so then, it's my experience

111
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:36,960
at least that it's easy then to connect with some of these people, because you've already

112
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:42,960
got some similar philosophies and, and things in common. So it's really lovely that that

113
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:43,960
way.

114
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:48,800
And I got my start at Linux users groups, which are much less popular these days, because

115
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:53,840
there's so many meetups of all kinds of things. But that's Linux users group is where I gave

116
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:58,600
my first talks. And because the audience is like, it's not a conference, it's not a big

117
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:03,160
like fancy thing where you submit a call for papers, like, in a log or most meetups, honestly,

118
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:07,880
you just like, email some person and say, Hey, I want to give a talk on this. And if

119
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:11,440
you're upfront about like, I've never given a talk before, like, it's fine. I'm like,

120
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:17,440
for most meetups, they'll be like, that's okay, like, we'll be kind to you. But like,

121
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:22,160
starting with that, like, like, just a user group where there's like, maybe 20 people,

122
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:26,000
it's still super stressful. And my first few talks, I know, were terrible. And I was super

123
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:32,040
nervous. And like, my voice was all jittery. And I said, I'm too much. But that's true

124
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:37,840
of everyone, isn't it? Right? We all start there. Yeah, yeah. But it was nice to be able

125
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:43,520
to do that around like people I sort of knew in the community, rather than like at a conference

126
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:48,900
where I don't know anyone, and I'm already scared. Yeah, some of those conference rooms

127
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:55,560
can be pretty big, filled with strangers, or future friends, maybe. Right. Do you remember

128
00:10:55,560 --> 00:11:05,840
what that first talk was? I am pretty sure my talk was about communication via the command

129
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:12,160
line. So I think I was talking about like text based chat things. So I was actually

130
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:16,000
I talked about Biddlebee in that because that was the IM gateway. And I talked about a bunch

131
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:22,280
of different like chat clients, like, or see and whatever else was available at the time.

132
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:26,760
Yeah. And I don't think I had slides. Because when I looked back at it a few years ago,

133
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:31,480
like all I did was like link to some resources, like I linked to some like, things on my website.

134
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:35,760
And I was I think I talked about screen and SSH and like ways you can keep your chat client

135
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:44,160
running forever and stuff. Yeah. I will say that you're fairly prolific in your talks.

136
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:48,280
Like you list them, you actually do a beautiful job of listing. I was gonna say all of them,

137
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:52,240
but I don't know if they're all there. But quite a few of them that you've given on your

138
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:57,080
website. So if people want to check those out, there's quite a lot of them. I did lend

139
00:11:57,080 --> 00:12:05,360
my ear to one of them. I think it was at Linux Conf Australia, entitled Why Linux System

140
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:10,580
Mims Should Care About Mainframes, which is some of what you're doing now. And maybe that's

141
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:16,240
a nice segue. That talk, I would definitely say people should check out to get a sense

142
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:20,760
of definitely your personality and the kind of stuff you're working on. But you know,

143
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:25,660
in about 25 minutes, I learned a heck of a lot of stuff. But there's the word mainframe

144
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:31,920
in there. And I know that's a lot of what you're talking and working about these days.

145
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:38,160
I think you were mentioning that the story of where how you went from a small container,

146
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:43,160
sort of startup to going into mainframes was an interesting story. So maybe you can guide

147
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:49,400
us through that. Yeah, so I mentioned that I worked on Ubuntu and Debian for a while

148
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:55,080
and that was like a hobby. From there, actually, one of my contacts through the Ubuntu community

149
00:12:55,080 --> 00:13:02,800
hooked me up with opportunity at HP to work on OpenStack. So that led into me working

150
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:07,000
on distributed systems. So I worked on the OpenStack infrastructure team for about four

151
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:11,360
years. And in that role, I started playing around with containers because the infrastructure

152
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:16,020
team for OpenStack, one of the things we were testing out is running jobs in containers

153
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:21,880
for our CI-CD pipeline. And so I was playing with containers a lot. And then when I left

154
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:27,600
HP, I joined a container startup in San Francisco. And so that was a lot of fun for a couple

155
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:33,600
of years. But at the end of that, I was like, all right, what am I going to do next? And

156
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:37,320
I started reaching out to people in my community and figure out what I want to do for my next

157
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:43,680
job. And that's when someone from IBM came over and said, hey, you want to work on mainframes?

158
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:52,200
And immediately, I'm like, I think you have the wrong person. Because in my head, mainframes

159
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:58,480
were this obsolete technology. And it felt like my job for the past six years had been

160
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:04,220
trying to replace them. Because working on distributed systems and building up reliability

161
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:13,660
and redundancy and resiliency and all the R words on cheap x86 hardware was the goal

162
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:20,640
of the future. And that mainframes were just not really applicable. So I ended up having

163
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:26,440
a few calls with them anyway. And I talked to some of the engineers. And one of the things

164
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:32,320
that they they impressed upon me was that not only are mainframes actually modern hardware,

165
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:36,200
but there's a lot of really interesting open source stuff happening on them, including

166
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:40,800
work with containers. So the reason that they reached out to me was because I was already

167
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:45,920
like an industry person giving talks on containers and in the Linux space. And I was reaching

168
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:52,780
Linux sys administrators like myself, who they wanted to reach and change their mind

169
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:57,400
like they changed mine. So it it's still a little weird being on the mainframe team with

170
00:14:57,400 --> 00:15:04,600
my background, just because my I don't know anything. I mean, I do now. But when I started,

171
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:09,020
I was really just a Linux sys admin. And it's been this like learning journey over these

172
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:15,240
past several months since I joined of discovering things. And I think the most fun I've had

173
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:19,780
is talking to people who are in the mainframe space, and show it sharing with them my discoveries.

174
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:23,640
And they're like, why don't people know about these things? Like mainframes, they don't

175
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:28,960
go down, they can survive earthquakes, like, how did you not know these things? I'm like,

176
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:34,040
I don't know, but I'm pretty representative of a standard Linux sys admin. So if I didn't

177
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:38,720
know, this is the message I need to be delivering to people. Plus, it's really cool hardware.

178
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,840
So that's been fascinating.

179
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:46,800
I would agree with you completely how there's this gap, right? Like many of us, most of

180
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:54,280
us, I would say I've heard the word mainframe, but usually associated with either a 90s animated

181
00:15:54,280 --> 00:16:00,960
series that I really love. So with thought and matrix and all this, but joking aside,

182
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:07,560
like it is usually something from the past, something, you know, pretty popular in the

183
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:13,280
90s, maybe, but these days, nobody really thinks of that. And so the talk that I mentioned

184
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:20,240
earlier that you gave really reinforced to me that like, there's a real gap here. And

185
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:26,020
it sounds like you're taking it upon yourself to really try to fill that gap and to inform

186
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:32,280
pretty much everybody on the value of mainframes in today's sort of environment. Because as

187
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:38,000
you described there, there are quite a few. Could you maybe give a few here so that people

188
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,480
can get nicely curious?

189
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:43,340
I think if you Google for like ode to the mainframe or something, there's like this

190
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:48,960
montage of like all these mainframe mentions in pop culture, and it's hilarious. It's funny

191
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:52,560
because you're like, oh, mainframe, but also like most of them don't make any sense, like

192
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:56,780
hacking the mainframe. And like, there's all kinds of like hilarious things in pop culture.

193
00:16:56,780 --> 00:16:59,880
And I was reading like a comic book there. I think it was like Wonder Woman or something.

194
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:04,040
And they're like, there was like some strange quote about like, I am the cybernetic brain

195
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:09,920
of the mainframe or something. I'm like, what is this even? It's hilarious of what people

196
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:10,920
think.

197
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:16,800
And so why are mainframes special today, then? Like, why is it worth reviving the concept?

198
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:21,360
Yeah. So one of the statistics I learned recently that was actually surprising to me was that

199
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:25,360
IBM sells more mainframes today than they did in 1990.

200
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:28,640
Okay. Wow.

201
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:33,360
So in spite of the public perception, like there are actually more of them out there.

202
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:37,440
And if you think about like going about your day-to-day business, every time you swipe

203
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:43,200
a credit card, chances are your transaction is hitting a mainframe somewhere. All of the

204
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:47,400
airlines pretty much use mainframes still, except for like one of them. And again, like

205
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:53,320
most of the banks, most insurance companies, most healthcare, it still all runs on mainframes.

206
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:58,420
So one of the things that we like to talk about is that like, if Facebook went down,

207
00:17:58,420 --> 00:18:02,920
or even if Google went down and you didn't have access to your email, like, or search,

208
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:10,280
like that would be a bad day. But if the mainframes in the world all went away, it would be catastrophic

209
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:16,120
because flights would stop, banking would stop. And what happens when all of that happens?

210
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:17,920
Like things get very bad.

211
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:19,840
Those are the essentials.

212
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:24,680
They're really like fundamental to our life. And they're all backed by mainframes at the

213
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:28,380
end of the day. Like maybe you've got these microservices in front of them and all this

214
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:32,760
stuff running on cloud, but they're still going back to a backend at some point that

215
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:38,640
is backed by the mainframe. And so it's really essential that they are still working and

216
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:45,400
that we have the talent to continue keeping them running. So part of that has been bringing

217
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:51,020
in new people on the Linux side, because Linux runs on mainframes, it has for like 21 years,

218
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:57,060
but also ramping up the college students who are learning the ZOS and the other proprietary

219
00:18:57,060 --> 00:19:01,040
operating systems that run on the mainframe, because that's where a bulk of this content

220
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:05,560
is like people are still writing COBOL. And they're still writing assembler for mainframes.

221
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:10,400
And we need new developers working on that. So there's like this DevOps on Z, because

222
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:15,520
that's what the mainframes are called IBM Z. So I'm on the IBM Z team. So they call

223
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:20,640
it like Z DevOps, where we're bringing like Jenkins and Git and a lot of the tooling around

224
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:25,040
DevOps to the mainframe world. And that's been a lot of fun, actually.

225
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:30,460
Yeah, it sounds like a real niche opportunity, really. Because it sounds like what you're

226
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:37,640
saying is, we need developers here. And it's really cool technology. And it's essential

227
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:43,040
for it to run everywhere. So it's not it's not going away anytime soon. So it seems to

228
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:47,080
me like there's a real opportunity there for, you know, some people who might want to skill

229
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:52,560
up or try something new, something different. And I suppose that's exactly what you did.

230
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:57,240
Yeah. So and it's really been interesting being like the Linux person on the team, because

231
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:01,480
there's definitely that happening in organizations where there's a mainframe team. And they bring

232
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:06,400
on the Linux people to run Linux on the mainframe, too. And there's a lot of cross training happening.

233
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:10,300
So I'm teaching my mainframe peers how to do everything. And I'm teaching them about

234
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:16,120
like SSH and moving files and Linux. And the Linux talent is actually really valuable in

235
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:25,080
this space. And it doesn't hurt that it pays pretty well. So yeah, that's that's helpful.

236
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:29,800
Nobody minds that. So my team, we like do university outreach. We also have this program

237
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:33,760
called Master the Mainframe that we run every year from September to December, which is

238
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:39,520
specifically for students, college students. We do a contest, we give out prizes. And what

239
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:42,880
they have to do is go through a series of challenges. So we give them an account on

240
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:47,720
the mainframe, not Linux, but ZOS. And then they work through these challenges to learn

241
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:54,080
the basics of how to navigate the UI and write some basic programs. And it's really amazing.

242
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:58,320
We had 25,000 students sign up for the program last year.

243
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:07,240
Oh, that is a lot. And, well, I guess if you want to bring in some new, fresh, young talent,

244
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:11,160
then that's kind of the way that you need to do it. But that's a that's a lot of that's

245
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:13,160
a big cohort for sure. Wow.

246
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:18,440
Yeah, for sure. And one of the really interesting things is that the students don't like, I'd

247
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:23,600
say like people my age, like late 30s, we have this idea of a mainframe in our head.

248
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:26,520
But the younger students, they don't, they don't know what a mainframe they've never

249
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:27,520
even heard of one.

250
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:32,440
Right. And they don't know that 90s sort of cliche word, right?

251
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:38,000
Exactly. So, so to them, it's like this big, super powerful computer. We did a hackathon

252
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:44,160
or actually a data-a-thon with some data scientist students at UC Berkeley a few months ago.

253
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:48,880
And they didn't even know what IBM stood for. The company was just not on their radar at

254
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:55,320
all. Like my first computer was an IBM 8086. But IBM doesn't make computers for normal

255
00:21:55,320 --> 00:22:01,200
people anymore. So if anyone's listening and doesn't know what IBM is, it's international

256
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,240
business machines.

257
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:09,680
Thank you for filling that in. That's funny. Gotta include everybody. Yeah, there's a lot

258
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:17,240
of history there, right? And many of us, you know, I'm sort of young 30s. So I remember

259
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:22,440
the IBM ThinkPads, and those have quite a reputation, right? But as far as you know,

260
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:27,480
you just don't see IBM in the sort of end-user space anymore. And for good reason, they focused

261
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:32,800
on some really cool stuff. You mentioned some educational stuff. I know you've done some

262
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:40,640
cool things with the Linux Foundation around the Open Mainframe project. Can you tell us

263
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:44,360
a little bit about that? Because that seems like two worlds colliding as well in a really

264
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:45,800
beautiful way.

265
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:51,280
So the Open Mainframe project is a Linux Foundation project that's built around a bunch of open

266
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:58,120
source software products focused on the mainframe. So a lot of them are focused on interactions

267
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:03,120
between like the older proprietary operating systems, which when I say older, it just means

268
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:07,480
they have a really long history. They're actually really modern in like they're still being

269
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:14,320
developed and features are added all the time. So just saying that. But the older operating

270
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:19,480
systems providing modern interactions with them that are open source. So there's a project

271
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:25,640
called Zoe, which allows you to have a graphical interface that's run in a web browser. So

272
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:30,120
you don't really need to install any software on your computer, like on your laptop, but

273
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:36,120
you can interact with the workloads and all kinds of things that are running on the mainframe.

274
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:43,080
There's also connections to your modern IDEs. So if you're using Visual Studio code, there's

275
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:48,480
a plugin for Z that allows you to edit code and run different things directly through

276
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:53,640
an IDE that you're familiar with. So you don't need to work in all the guts of the mainframe

277
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:57,480
and be like logged into a terminal. And all of that's been enabled through Zoe as well.

278
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:01,920
It uses an API to connect through it. And so the Open Mainframe project, it's actually

279
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:07,520
one of the things that convinced me to join IBM and take this role was because I believe

280
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:12,480
in Linux and the Linux Foundation and the Open Mainframe project. I was like, listen,

281
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:16,940
IBM is putting some real money and real resources towards open source software on the mainframe

282
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:23,480
these days. And so that was fascinating to me. So there's a bunch of companies, Broadcom,

283
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:29,200
Rocket, who are all like invested in the Open Mainframe project. So we're having our first

284
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:34,360
Open Mainframe summit, I think in September. Call for Papers is open now.

285
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:36,200
That's great.

286
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:39,240
And it's really just about gathering more projects.

287
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:40,240
Where's this summit happening?

288
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:41,240
Actually, I don't know.

289
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:48,040
Oh, well, we got to go find out. That sounds cool. And, and I could see why that would

290
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:52,160
be a bit of a tipping point for you. Like, you know, just hearing the Linux Foundation's

291
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:56,600
name is like, oh, yeah, that's familiar. I know they do good work, that kind of thing.

292
00:24:56,600 --> 00:25:01,760
But connected to some of the mainframe stuff, seems like, okay, well, these are, you know,

293
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:07,900
that with IBM is someone I trust. So let's, let's dive in and dive in you have, right.

294
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:13,120
But it also sounds like there's kind of some cool, you know, you're sort of like trailblazing

295
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:18,240
in many ways, that that area, which sounds kind of cool, too.

296
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:23,520
Yeah. Since I know that the Linux Foundation has such a high bar for like approving projects,

297
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:26,520
I knew that it was a serious investment when I knew they were involved.

298
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:33,040
Which is always a good thing. Can I ask you about what you're running at home? Because

299
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:38,520
that piqued my interest, too. What are you running on your computer over there?

300
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:45,400
On my desktop, which I just rebuilt with this like brand new i7 processor and like, lots

301
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:49,800
of RAM, it's, I use the same case because it's beautiful. Anyway, I moved, I moved my

302
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:55,280
hardware hard drives over, so I didn't reinstall, but I'm running Zooboon 2. And I still contribute

303
00:25:55,280 --> 00:26:00,840
to that project. That's one of the ones that I do for fun. I don't do that much. Technically,

304
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:06,920
I'm the marketing lead. But that's because I know how to use Twitter. Like a high bar

305
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:08,040
on our team.

306
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:10,080
But someone has to do it, right?

307
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:15,680
Yeah. So yeah, so I use Zooboon 2 on my desktop. And then I still run a bunch of servers. So

308
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:19,260
like, even though I'm a developer advocate now, I still play around with servers a lot.

309
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:22,480
So I've got a couple servers sitting behind me in my office here. They're both running

310
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:28,780
Debian, like my media and my backup server. And then where my website runs, that's actually

311
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:33,840
a Linode virtual server. And that's running Debian as well. And then I run a bunch of

312
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:38,280
community servers for the Ubuntu community is still and I put Ubuntu on those because

313
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:43,680
I thought it would be bad to run Debian on them.

314
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:45,680
Maybe

315
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:53,960
amusingly for work. IBM treats Red Hat Enterprise Linux as a first class citizen, as far as

316
00:26:53,960 --> 00:27:01,200
as desktops go. So when you join IBM, you can request Windows, Mac, or Linux. And so

317
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:06,440
everyone on my team picked Mac, except for me. I wanted the Linux one. So it was great.

318
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:11,320
They like shipped me this ThinkPad, like a really awesome ThinkPad. It's like a T480

319
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:18,020
and it's got like 32 gigs of RAM and i7 processor. It's a really dope machine. And it had Red

320
00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:24,980
Hat Linux already installed on it. And it works with the VPN and all Slack and everything's

321
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:30,080
already all set up on it, which is awesome because when it's my work laptop, I don't

322
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:33,560
want to have to be fiddling around with the VPN and stuff. So everyone's like, Oh, don't

323
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:38,280
you want to install Ubuntu on it? And I'm like, not really. I mean, kind of, but then

324
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:42,120
I'd have to set up all that stuff myself and I wouldn't be able to call tech support if

325
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:46,080
like the VPN breaks because they'll just like, Oh, you're using something that's not on our

326
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:50,640
approved list. So it's been fine.

327
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:55,880
Well, and it sounds as well to me like you have a real interest in dipping your toe in

328
00:27:55,880 --> 00:28:00,520
a whole bunch of different distributions. You know, you just mentioned some of the computers

329
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:07,140
and software and servers that you're using just for fun, and they kind of span a big

330
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:13,560
collection there. So why not gain a little bit more experience with Red Hat in there

331
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:18,200
as well, right? It's there's, there's similarities and just enough differences that you can skill

332
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:19,480
up in that area too.

333
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:23,540
Yeah. The only, the only sort of family of Linux distros I don't really have represented

334
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:27,880
here is a SUSE, which is a shame because I have a lot of friends over there.

335
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:34,880
You mentioned being involved in Zubuntu. Uh, I think you mentioned to me that you, your,

336
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:41,760
your current machine is sort of an upgrade path from 804. Uh, so you've been running

337
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:46,680
that one for a while and it sounds like it's working pretty well. Um, I started, uh, my

338
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:52,180
journey on Zubuntu. So that, um, hit really close to home for me and was kind of a nostalgic

339
00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:57,200
to hear you were running it too. Um, but to hear your involvement there, uh, continued

340
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:04,560
involvement as well as your sort of deep involvement in, in, in Debian and Ubuntu as well, uh,

341
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:07,840
really puts a smile on my face because it sounds like you've been doing it for a long

342
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:14,200
time and that you're not stopping anytime soon. Uh, I guess you probably don't have

343
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:21,000
any reason to stop considering you're so, uh, kind of, I guess in love with it. Right.

344
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:28,000
But I heard as well that you were, uh, involved in the Ubuntu community council for something

345
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,880
like six years. Is that right?

346
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:33,320
Yeah. So that's, um, the Ubuntu community council. There's like two governing boards

347
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:38,240
of the Ubuntu project. There's the technical board and then there's the community council.

348
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:42,880
Um, and so the tech board, they're mostly people who work at Canonical cause they're

349
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:49,280
the ones who have enough time to do all the technical work, um, and make like smart technical

350
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:53,280
decisions. Um, the community council is more about like community logistics and making

351
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:58,080
sure that people had all the resources that they needed in the community. Um, so I sort

352
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:03,920
of did it like during like the golden age of Ubuntu community.

353
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:06,360
And what do you call the golden age then?

354
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:10,480
One of the things that happened with Ubuntu is it like everyone was super excited when

355
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:15,920
it came out. So we're talking like 2008 to like 2014, it was going to revolutionize the

356
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:20,940
desktop. We were going to have it on our phones and our TVs and everything. And then something

357
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:26,480
really interesting happened was that it actually took off really significantly in the server

358
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:33,120
space because for once you had a, an operating system that was backed by a company and was

359
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:37,040
free. Um, because you know, you always had Debian, which was really stable and great

360
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:42,200
and it's what Ubuntu is based off of, but Debian was not really equipped because it,

361
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:45,680
there was no company behind it. Um, I did work for a company that would, that would

362
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:50,200
support Debian, but it just wasn't in the big way that Canonical was supporting Ubuntu.

363
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:54,280
So just the server side took off and that's really the direction that Canonical has taken

364
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:58,520
it in. So the community is much smaller these days, but when I was working on it, yeah,

365
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:01,720
it was like all about the phone and all these exciting things that they were going to work

366
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:05,920
on. And a lot of that has really dropped off, which was sad to see. Um, but there's still

367
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:10,240
community efforts doing all that. Like there's the Ubu ports project, which is still supporting

368
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:15,200
the Ubuntu on phone dream and doing good things around it too. Yeah. And I still have one

369
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:19,760
of the Ubuntu touch devices. They actually released one from a Spanish company. So when

370
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:25,080
I, when I finished the, the most recent edition of the official Ubuntu book, that was like

371
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:31,120
my present to myself as I bought myself an Ubuntu tablet. It was so sad. We added a chapter

372
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:34,920
about tablets and things in that, in the ninth edition of the official Ubuntu book. And that

373
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:39,880
was like a new chapter. We, we wrote that from scratch. And then a couple of years later,

374
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:43,280
they discontinued, Canonical discontinued their effort. And I'm like, Oh, I just wrote

375
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:47,280
a chapter about all of this. It's so sad.

376
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:52,120
Yeah, but it was, it was really exciting being on the community council. Um, cause we worked

377
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:57,640
with Mark Shuttleworth very closely. He was a member of the council as well. And it was

378
00:31:57,640 --> 00:32:00,880
an interesting time. I mean, definitely some trying times as we, you know, we, we were

379
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:04,880
also the arbitrators of the code of conduct. And one of the things I was really proud of

380
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:08,840
is Ubuntu is one of the first projects that had a code of conduct. I think it may have

381
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:13,340
even coined the term code of conduct in the software space. And it was one of the reasons

382
00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:18,100
I was drawn to the project because I had been working in Debian, which can sometimes be

383
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:25,760
a bit abrasive. And, uh, the Ubuntu community was just so friendly and helpful and amazing.

384
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:29,360
Do you think that explains much of why it's gotten to where it is? Cause it sounds to

385
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:33,360
me like that's repeated almost everywhere is that community is great. Community is great.

386
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:37,360
Very welcoming. That was one of my first contributions like that I hear all over and over and over

387
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:38,360
again.

388
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:42,420
Yeah, absolutely. I mean, I see a lot of in, in the more successful open source projects

389
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:47,200
that have contributors from elsewhere, I see a lot of things repeated. So I mentioned that

390
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:51,860
we had these Ubuntu developer summits where we got together in person that was repeated

391
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:56,400
in the open stack community and the open stack community. I wasn't the only one from Ubuntu

392
00:32:56,400 --> 00:33:00,780
there. Like there were a lot of people who put a lot of effort into recreating that developer

393
00:33:00,780 --> 00:33:05,540
summit and turning it into the open stack design summit. So every six months we all

394
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:10,160
got together. Um, and now if you look at Kubernetes, they have contributor summits. And again,

395
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:14,880
it's like some of the same people coming along and taking lessons from going into the past.

396
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:20,320
So I'm really proud of how influential, um, that all ended up being, um, for projects

397
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:26,040
even today, even though Ubuntu doesn't do them anymore, you know, like the lessons have,

398
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:28,760
have modernized and come to the latest projects.

399
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:34,140
That's a really nice way to put it that, that pride that you have in sort of helping develop

400
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:40,200
those. Um, and now you're seeing sort of those six months sprints almost everywhere, like

401
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:44,600
internally for some companies that have a lot of remote people. Um, you know, we just

402
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:49,800
did one with Jupiter broadcasting a little while ago. Are they ever powerful to just

403
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:53,600
get ideas happening and get people connected for the next six months. And there's just

404
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:59,280
magic that kind of gets rejuvenated when that happens. So good on you for helping make that

405
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:00,280
happen.

406
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:05,040
Yeah. And so my, when I was working on OpenStack, my whole team was remote. Um, and we actually

407
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:09,160
worked for different companies. So a bunch of us were at HP, but we also had some Red

408
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:14,200
Hat and Rackspace and all kinds of other companies around working on the project infrastructure.

409
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:18,040
And so the sprints were really essential because there was, we couldn't get into an office

410
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:21,680
together. I mean, we ended up sometimes doing that, but it was someone's office that we

411
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:26,920
went to, right? Because we were distributed not only remotely, but across different companies.

412
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:27,920
What a challenge.

413
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:32,040
Yeah. And there's, there's no way we could have done it fully, fully remote a hundred

414
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:36,840
percent of the time. We had to get together for those every six months first for like,

415
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:40,600
like social cohesion. Um, but it was also important to get into a meeting room together

416
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:45,000
and hash out some of the big issues because sometimes things would just get out of hand

417
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:49,960
and we couldn't deal with them over chat, right? Like we needed to get into a room with

418
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:55,080
a whiteboard and all sit down together. So when I talk to people about remote work, that's

419
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:59,280
one of the things I stress as well. I'm like, listen, like you can only do so much when

420
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:04,040
you're in different places. Like I love remote work. I've been doing it for like over a decade

421
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:11,480
now, but I need to get in a room with my teammates, like on some sort of cadence, you know, socially.

422
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:16,960
Of course, remote work does not mean a hundred percent remote, right? I think that's a fallacy.

423
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:21,160
Most people, when they first hear about remote work and they haven't experienced it themselves,

424
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:24,280
that's often what they think, but that's not quite true, nor does it work.

425
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:31,800
Yeah. And plus it's a great way to, okay, sometimes there's arguments between people.

426
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:37,000
And if you get them together, oftentimes those are going to be worked out like in person

427
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:43,120
because like people hold resentments and tone doesn't get communicated effectively. Even

428
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:47,240
if you're talking over a video chat, like sometimes it's just not there. But if you

429
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:53,800
get them together, get some tea, get some biscuits and hang out and just have fun together,

430
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:57,840
like you can work through most problems. And there have definitely been personalities I've

431
00:35:57,840 --> 00:36:02,120
worked with who like people just like butt heads, but as soon as they get together, they're

432
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:05,480
like, okay, you're actually a reasonable person. You're kind of cool. And I understand where

433
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:10,600
you're coming from. I still disagree with you, but we can work together and it's okay.

434
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:13,920
Like that wouldn't happen if we didn't get them in a room together.

435
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:19,840
Of course. And, and yet, you know, once you get that resolved, there's some beautiful

436
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:25,340
things that can happen when you bring together people who have different perspectives and

437
00:36:25,340 --> 00:36:30,120
have different backgrounds and that kind of stuff. So really, really fascinating. That's

438
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:34,760
what kind of worries me about this, this coming year. And so we'll just sort of have to see

439
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:40,380
how all of this sort of social isolation stuff shakes out, but I hope we can find a way,

440
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:44,240
you know, to keep those connections strong because they're sort of the lifeblood of all

441
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:45,240
of this.

442
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:50,400
Elizabeth, if you wanted to put a question out to the community, what would you want

443
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:55,240
to send out there? It could be, it could be something you want them to go see, something

444
00:36:55,240 --> 00:37:01,720
you want them to try, maybe something to think about. What would you like to put out there?

445
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:05,280
So I want to encourage anyone, if they haven't contributed to an open source project and

446
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:11,920
they want to give it a try, just like pick a project or actually you can even reach out

447
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:14,560
to me and I might be able to help you find one.

448
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:17,160
We'll spin the wheel and pick a project for them.

449
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:21,680
Yeah. Or maybe even like have a quick call and talk through what you're interested in

450
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:27,800
and maybe we'll find a place for you, but just give it a try. It's terrifying, but only

451
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:34,360
at the beginning. I love telling this story. I was at the OpenStacks, one of the OpenStacks

452
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:39,120
summits and I was on a panel and I was talking about code reviews. And in code reviews, people

453
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:47,600
comment on the coding patch that you proposed. And that's really scary because everyone is

454
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:52,080
self-conscious about their coding skills. And so whenever anyone critiques their coding

455
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:56,600
skills, it can be scary, especially when it's some stranger on the internet. So I mentioned

456
00:37:56,600 --> 00:38:02,400
that I had a patch that I put up and it had like 47 back and forth with me uploading new

457
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:06,680
versions and people leaving comments. And it ended up being like 47 changes, right?

458
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:11,880
It was huge. And so I mentioned this during the panel and for the rest of the conference,

459
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:17,240
everyone was telling me their bigger numbers. So they're like, I had a patch that had like

460
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:23,400
150 revisions. It was the funniest thing. And people I totally respect and think are

461
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:28,840
brilliant. They're like, I'm like, you had that many? So I want to say it's terrifying

462
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:34,380
to contribute to open source, but we've all made mistakes and been there. And I'm hoping

463
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:38,560
people are friendlier with reviews, but if you don't get a friendly review, it's okay.

464
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:43,560
It's not you. And it happens to everyone. Totally unrelated.

465
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:52,160
But I give away VMs on mainframes running Linux. So if you Google search for Linux one

466
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:57,400
community cloud, for 120 days, you can get a free Linux VM on a mainframe and you can

467
00:38:57,400 --> 00:39:02,700
like show the CPU stats to your friends. It's a different architecture from x86. So that

468
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:06,760
can be fun to play around with, like toss your software on there, see if it works. The

469
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:11,440
first thing I did when I logged into one is I like logged onto IRC and like shared the

470
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:20,480
CPU stats with my friends. Like I am so cool. Do you want to try that out? Yeah, it's out

471
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:24,240
there. We do it to encourage development on the platform.

472
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:27,120
That's lovely. And did you say 120 days?

473
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:28,120
Yep.

474
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:29,520
That's a reasonable amount of time.

475
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:32,680
Yeah, just for playing around. And if you're an open source project, who's serious about

476
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:37,200
building on the architecture, I can hook you up with like a VM that you can add to your

477
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:38,680
CI system forever.

478
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:47,440
Nice. Wow, local hookups. That's good. What is another sort of thing that you might suggest

479
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:52,200
that people can try if they if they want to give that a shot? I know you mentioned I was

480
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:57,740
plugging into IRC. But what's something kind of real world that might be fun for people

481
00:39:57,740 --> 00:39:58,740
to give a shot?

482
00:39:58,740 --> 00:40:03,560
So the biggest thing I since I work with open source projects, I just try to compile something

483
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:09,920
on it. So whether it's your project or the your favorite application, but see if it works

484
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:14,100
and then see the weird compiling errors that come out if it doesn't work. Because the big

485
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:20,760
difference between the mainframe architecture and x86 is that x86 is little endian. And

486
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:26,200
the mainframe architecture is one of the last big endian architectures out there. So I've

487
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:31,440
learned so much in the past year. I mean, I've only ever really I mean, I've played

488
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:37,160
around with like spark and arm and other things. But those are all little endian. And like

489
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:41,360
mainframe is a whole different world. So if you want to compile some software, that's

490
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:42,360
it's fun.

491
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:48,640
Wow, that sounds like such a gift. So thank you for offering that. That's huge. If people

492
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:52,800
wanted to get connected with you and get in contact, say hi, maybe reach out to you for

493
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:55,120
a VM, where can they reach you?

494
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:59,040
You can just head over to princessleia.com. I've got my email address on there and everything

495
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:04,800
l y z at princessleia.com. If you're want to connect with me on the professional side,

496
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:11,360
it doesn't matter. I check my email everywhere. But I'm also l y z at IBM.com. And I'm on

497
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:18,440
Twitter at PLA to pretty much on everything is PLA to so easy to find.

498
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:23,600
I think I would people would probably get after me if I didn't ask you about your domain

499
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:28,720
name. I read that you've had it for quite a while. Princess Leia, I would imagine you're

500
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:32,440
a bit of a Star Wars fan. Is that? Am I off there?

501
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:38,960
When I first got online, my first chat room was a sci fi chat room.

502
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:39,960
That makes sense.

503
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:44,600
Yeah. And I wanted to be Princess Leia on there. But that one was taken. So I was Princess

504
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:52,600
Leia 2. And that's the PLA to my Twitter handle and on my license plate and like everywhere.

505
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:56,800
That's lovely. And I think many of us can relate to that, like finding the name that

506
00:41:56,800 --> 00:42:03,600
you want, whether it was on, you know, ICQ or whatever kind of follows you, right?

507
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:10,720
Yeah. And it's it's so funny because it's so unprofessional.

508
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:11,720
And yet here we are.

509
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:16,080
Yeah. But my husband, my husband's like, Oh, you should definitely like separate your work

510
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:20,200
stuff away from the Princess Leia stuff because it's not very professional. And I'm just like,

511
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:24,480
I don't want to work for a company that doesn't appreciate it.

512
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:30,000
There you go. Yeah. And I find the reality actually, is that so many of us are interested

513
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:34,440
in that kind of thing, no matter where you're working or how high up the ranks you are,

514
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:39,760
right? Like, how many Star Trek fans have you met that are anywhere within those those,

515
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:45,800
those ranks? So I think that's a good filter. If someone doesn't want to work with me because

516
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:51,120
I'm having fun, then that's maybe not a place where I want to be. Right. So. So kudos to

517
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:56,480
that. Well, Liz, thank you so much for chatting. I really appreciate it. And thank you so much

518
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:57,480
for your time.

519
00:42:57,480 --> 00:42:59,520
Yeah. Thank you so much for having me. This is fun.

520
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:16,080
Yeah, you're welcome.
