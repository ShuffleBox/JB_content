WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:16.060
There we go, there we go.

00:16.060 --> 00:17.060
Hello guys, are you ready?

00:17.060 --> 00:18.060
Are you ready to do this?

00:18.060 --> 00:19.060
I'm excited.

00:19.060 --> 00:20.060
We've got Brent here, we've got Wes here.

00:20.060 --> 00:21.060
Hello gentlemen.

00:21.060 --> 00:22.060
Hello.

00:22.060 --> 00:23.060
Hello.

00:23.060 --> 00:24.060
Hello.

00:24.060 --> 00:25.060
That's a great tune you chose there.

00:25.060 --> 00:28.060
That's a little Ronald Jankies classic right there.

00:28.060 --> 00:29.060
Really?

00:29.060 --> 00:30.060
Really.

00:30.060 --> 00:31.060
It's been a while.

00:31.060 --> 00:33.800
Going back to our roots with that one.

00:33.800 --> 00:37.480
We have an open mumble room too, but only just a few brave souls in the mumble room

00:37.480 --> 00:38.480
right now.

00:38.480 --> 00:39.480
Hello mumble room.

00:39.480 --> 00:41.000
How are you guys doing?

00:41.000 --> 00:43.120
Just Mini Mac, Bearded Tech in there, we've got a couple listeners.

00:43.120 --> 00:44.120
Hey, hello.

00:44.120 --> 00:46.040
Hey Mini Mac, how are you doing?

00:46.040 --> 00:48.240
I'm doing well, I'm doing well, thank you.

00:48.240 --> 00:53.000
So Bearded Tech wanted to just join us right now.

00:53.000 --> 00:56.040
He was just eating something, but he won't be here.

00:56.040 --> 00:57.760
It's dinner time for some people.

00:57.760 --> 00:58.760
It's dinner time for some people.

00:58.760 --> 01:00.040
It's some people's bedtime.

01:00.040 --> 01:03.840
On the West Coast, we're still actually an hour before it's quitting time.

01:03.840 --> 01:10.040
So we actually want to do more of these streams going forward, and we would try to do them

01:10.040 --> 01:11.240
at different times.

01:11.240 --> 01:14.640
So hopefully we'll find something that works for everybody.

01:14.640 --> 01:19.480
Now something new we're trying for this stream is we're putting the matrix chat up on the

01:19.480 --> 01:23.400
screen just as an experiment, it's just a rough test.

01:23.400 --> 01:26.840
So if you're an IRC lover, don't worry, it's not done yet.

01:26.840 --> 01:31.360
We still have more work to do before we can make that transition, but we do have it up

01:31.360 --> 01:32.560
on the screen today.

01:32.560 --> 01:37.360
So part of the Bitcoin giveaway that we're doing in a little bit will require that you

01:37.360 --> 01:39.400
join our matrix server.

01:39.400 --> 01:42.440
So hopefully that works, we'll see.

01:42.440 --> 01:46.720
It's under a lot of load because the community has been growing like crazy, but that's going

01:46.720 --> 01:47.760
to be one of the things required.

01:47.760 --> 01:53.320
So go to joinmatrix.org to get information on that, but we'll have more details soon.

01:53.320 --> 01:54.540
We have a lot to do today.

01:54.540 --> 01:59.520
We've got a special guest joining us, we've got a Bitcoin giveaway to get people started

01:59.520 --> 02:03.140
on their Boost wallets, we've got an AMA to do, all of that.

02:03.140 --> 02:06.500
So let me start by thanking Linode for sponsoring this.

02:06.500 --> 02:08.160
They made this possible, they helped out.

02:08.160 --> 02:14.260
So go to linode.com slash Jupiter, that's right, linode.com slash Jupiter, and give

02:14.260 --> 02:18.560
them a big Thursday thank you for helping us out with this live stream.

02:18.560 --> 02:22.660
Support these streams by visiting linode.com slash Jupiter, or you can do it after the

02:22.660 --> 02:25.440
fact too if you're not watching live.

02:25.440 --> 02:29.520
Linode's what we really use to run everything that we've built in the last two and a half

02:29.520 --> 02:34.160
years, and man have we been using the crap out of Linode recently.

02:34.160 --> 02:38.840
It's so great how flexible it is, we tried different storage systems, local disk versus

02:38.840 --> 02:44.180
object storage versus volumes, and we've really been throwing everything at our matrix system

02:44.180 --> 02:48.360
recently and the flexibility of Linode and the capability to do a quick snapshot before

02:48.360 --> 02:51.040
we make some kind of devastating change.

02:51.040 --> 02:56.420
It's a real peace of mind, because people take the matrix server pretty serious now.

02:56.420 --> 03:01.400
We've created a valuable community resource, and so we don't want to screw it up.

03:01.400 --> 03:05.160
And so it's really nice to have some of the flexibility of Linode's backup and snapshot

03:05.160 --> 03:09.700
and storage systems as we're experimenting with different stuff, or to be able to just

03:09.700 --> 03:12.320
add and resize disks and RAM and stuff like that.

03:12.320 --> 03:15.280
They make it all really straightforward.

03:15.280 --> 03:18.140
And the performance is always top notch.

03:18.140 --> 03:22.640
And they've been rolling out MVME storage, and I didn't even know they were doing this

03:22.640 --> 03:25.680
until I was in the Linode dashboard the other day.

03:25.680 --> 03:29.960
But they're upgrading some systems to the MVME storage for free.

03:29.960 --> 03:33.920
For total, they're just like, push this button if you want to migrate to MVME PCIe super

03:33.920 --> 03:36.640
fast storage.

03:36.640 --> 03:37.640
It's so great.

03:37.640 --> 03:41.080
Linux users, I think, really can tell that the company loves and gets Linux.

03:41.080 --> 03:43.040
I mean, that's why they got into the business.

03:43.040 --> 03:47.920
And now 19 years later, they're just the best place to host a portfolio or something that's

03:47.920 --> 03:50.800
going to be able to handle millions of users.

03:50.800 --> 03:57.160
So support this here stream, maybe help us secure future stream support, and get yourself

03:57.160 --> 03:59.640
a $100 credit to try out Linode.

03:59.640 --> 04:03.760
That's a great deal, linode.com slash Jupiter.

04:03.760 --> 04:06.440
And thanks to Linode for sponsoring this stream.

04:06.440 --> 04:09.560
All right, so we're going to do the giveaway.

04:09.560 --> 04:15.120
But there is a series of things that I want to give you time to set up, because you're

04:15.120 --> 04:16.120
going to have to get an app.

04:16.120 --> 04:17.880
You're going to have to get Matrix.

04:17.880 --> 04:21.940
And also, it's not necessarily a bad idea to get in the mumble room.

04:21.940 --> 04:29.600
Just in case a Matrix takes a cramp or something goes wrong, voice communications is always

04:29.600 --> 04:30.600
the best.

04:30.600 --> 04:34.480
But additionally, when it comes to AMA time, you can always ask your question right there

04:34.480 --> 04:35.480
in the mumble room.

04:35.480 --> 04:41.440
And it's like a super low latency, high fidelity feed of the live stream right in your ears.

04:41.440 --> 04:43.120
That's true.

04:43.120 --> 04:44.120
That's always a really good point.

04:44.120 --> 04:48.440
It's the lowest latency, highest quality audio stream you can get.

04:48.440 --> 04:51.840
Linuxunplugged.com slash mumble for the details on that.

04:51.840 --> 04:55.840
Hey, I like that, confetti effects on the chat room.

04:55.840 --> 04:58.640
Thanks, Tim.

04:58.640 --> 04:59.700
That's pretty great.

04:59.700 --> 05:05.200
So Tim there just made confetti happen in our Matrix chat room.

05:05.200 --> 05:09.400
So to get on there, you can go to, well, first, just go get the Element chat client if you

05:09.400 --> 05:12.880
don't have it yet, element.io slash personal.

05:12.880 --> 05:17.040
You can also get Element on Flathub if you've got the Linux desktop, which I hope you do.

05:17.040 --> 05:20.160
And then you can get set up and go in pretty quick.

05:20.160 --> 05:24.400
And you want to search for, I mean, I'm trying to think of the best way to walk people through

05:24.400 --> 05:28.600
this, but you want to look for our Jupyter broadcasting server.

05:28.600 --> 05:31.520
So here's what I'd like people to do is start getting set up and we'll start taking questions

05:31.520 --> 05:32.520
on how to do this.

05:32.520 --> 05:35.200
The IRC room is still being monitored, so if you want to pop in the embedded chat and

05:35.200 --> 05:39.500
ask your question before you get into Matrix, I'm going to keep an eye on that.

05:39.500 --> 05:47.320
But what I would do is I would go to element.io slash personal, and then create an account

05:47.320 --> 05:51.560
on matrix.org, and then connect to the Jupyter broadcasting.com server.

05:51.560 --> 05:53.720
And we have a JB chat room over there.

05:53.720 --> 05:55.160
Now that's a lot.

05:55.160 --> 05:59.080
So we're going to chat about a few things while you guys get that going, and then we'll

05:59.080 --> 06:01.420
check back in and see how everybody's doing.

06:01.420 --> 06:03.320
So I thought maybe we'd cover.

06:03.320 --> 06:06.840
Maybe worth just saying, too, if you don't, you know, whatever, you don't feel quite ready

06:06.840 --> 06:08.520
to invest in the whole Element client.

06:08.520 --> 06:11.800
Like there's also the Element web client, which works pretty darn well.

06:11.800 --> 06:15.400
So it's like an app.element.io, I think.

06:15.400 --> 06:17.020
Great point, Wes Payne.

06:17.020 --> 06:19.120
That is a great point, Wes Payne.

06:19.120 --> 06:20.120
That is a great point.

06:20.120 --> 06:21.120
I use that all the time.

06:21.120 --> 06:23.200
It's basically the same thing, right?

06:23.200 --> 06:26.080
It is app.element.io.

06:26.080 --> 06:32.960
And then you can actually connect to colony.jupyterbroadcasting.com and create an account if you'd like to do that.

06:32.960 --> 06:34.960
But I would actually recommend a matrix.org account.

06:34.960 --> 06:40.320
So that way, if we ever screw up our matrix server, I think you know what I'm saying.

06:40.320 --> 06:42.640
I think you know what I'm saying.

06:42.640 --> 06:47.240
So before we get to that, Brentley, why don't you share with the class some of the various

06:47.240 --> 06:52.180
things you've been working on on GitHub for Jupyter Broadcasting, you know, for like issue

06:52.180 --> 06:53.680
tracking and whatnot.

06:53.680 --> 06:59.860
Yeah, we decided to, I guess, get the community and ourselves more involved in tracking down

06:59.860 --> 07:02.720
a bunch of bugs in our various systems.

07:02.720 --> 07:05.160
But that also includes just organizing our time.

07:05.160 --> 07:10.620
And Wes had a great idea of trying this on GitHub, which I'm not that familiar with.

07:10.620 --> 07:15.080
So it was also a great opportunity for me to kind of sink my teeth into GitHub.

07:15.080 --> 07:19.200
And I gotta say, I've been sort of playing around with it that you guys must have noticed

07:19.200 --> 07:20.200
for the last few days.

07:20.200 --> 07:22.580
And there's some cool stuff happening there.

07:22.580 --> 07:29.000
So for our Nix challenge, NixOS challenge, there's a bunch of discussions happening there

07:29.000 --> 07:32.480
and screenshots being shared and stuff, which is great.

07:32.480 --> 07:38.440
But for other parts of JB, we have put in some issue trackers.

07:38.440 --> 07:45.200
I don't think we quite switched them to public just yet, mostly because I wanted the you

07:45.200 --> 07:49.720
both gentlemen to look over it before before we do that, make sure I didn't really screw

07:49.720 --> 07:50.720
something up.

07:50.720 --> 07:52.600
And I imagine we'll have a little bit of both, right?

07:52.600 --> 07:56.360
Some stuff that's public, some stuff is just like internal tracking stuff for us.

07:56.360 --> 07:58.640
Yeah, which is which is really great.

07:58.640 --> 08:01.240
And it's great for us because it's all in the same place with the same interface, which

08:01.240 --> 08:02.680
I've been really enjoying.

08:02.680 --> 08:07.080
I think the key thing is we need to put like really incendiary things in our private stuff.

08:07.080 --> 08:10.680
So that way, if we ever accidentally flip it public, it's super embarrassing.

08:10.680 --> 08:12.760
Yeah, passwords in there and everything.

08:12.760 --> 08:13.760
Right?

08:13.760 --> 08:14.960
Yeah, that's a pressure to keep it secret.

08:14.960 --> 08:16.120
You're never gonna manage to.

08:16.120 --> 08:17.120
Right.

08:17.120 --> 08:18.120
That's right.

08:18.120 --> 08:21.640
You got to make I want to be like waking up at 3am worrying about the state of the public.

08:21.640 --> 08:22.640
Yeah, right.

08:22.640 --> 08:23.640
Yep.

08:23.640 --> 08:25.960
You both sound like experts.

08:25.960 --> 08:29.320
So I think, yeah, we'll probably flick that public.

08:29.320 --> 08:31.920
I don't know, maybe even today, maybe tomorrow.

08:31.920 --> 08:37.560
And I'm hoping that we can get a bunch of stuff happening there, a lot of buzz going

08:37.560 --> 08:39.760
on and hopefully help us fix a bunch of problems.

08:39.760 --> 08:45.160
I know, Chris, you're excited about maybe having some listeners and community members

08:45.160 --> 08:51.240
help us tackle certain issues that we're having, where they might have some expertise.

08:51.240 --> 08:55.400
Definitely that or even just maybe they observe something that we don't notice because, you

08:55.400 --> 08:57.880
know, we're kind of close to the sun as it is.

08:57.880 --> 09:02.040
So we we have our own list, boy, do we have a list.

09:02.040 --> 09:04.660
But you know, we're not on the outside.

09:04.660 --> 09:08.320
So it's like we don't interface with it externally, the way the audience does.

09:08.320 --> 09:12.120
So they may catch something from their perspective that we haven't considered.

09:12.120 --> 09:16.800
Yeah, we do get quite a bit of feedback about these kind of things when they happen.

09:16.800 --> 09:21.360
I know there's been one around memberships and the boosts that has been mentioned a few

09:21.360 --> 09:24.840
times that we still have to figure out.

09:24.840 --> 09:30.560
But I think that's actually a really nice place to send people to to, I guess, key us

09:30.560 --> 09:35.480
in to little bugs that are happening for them or like jblive.fm.

09:35.480 --> 09:36.480
Did we get that running again?

09:36.480 --> 09:37.480
I don't know.

09:37.480 --> 09:39.480
Actually, I said I put a ticket in.

09:39.480 --> 09:40.960
Probably not.

09:40.960 --> 09:41.960
Probably not.

09:41.960 --> 09:42.960
Yeah.

09:42.960 --> 09:45.880
So that's probably BSD now.

09:45.880 --> 09:52.520
I put an issue in our bug tracker and I tagged Wes because I figure he can fix it and Wes

09:52.520 --> 09:53.520
fix it.

09:53.520 --> 09:54.520
Fix it.

09:54.520 --> 09:55.520
All right.

09:55.520 --> 09:59.080
So I think some people may be having problems joining Matrix, which I expected.

09:59.080 --> 10:00.320
That's why we're taking our time with this.

10:00.320 --> 10:01.880
We're not in a rush.

10:01.880 --> 10:07.920
So probably if you'd be willing to join the mumble room and help us diagnose, that'd probably

10:07.920 --> 10:10.740
be the most effective approach.

10:10.740 --> 10:15.280
So again, linuxunplug.com slash mumble for that information.

10:15.280 --> 10:19.560
And also if you're just like a total noob to Matrix and you're kind of curious about

10:19.560 --> 10:24.640
like what's the difference between running your own server versus using a matrix.org

10:24.640 --> 10:29.280
account or how do you join other rooms or all that or why even use Matrix over something

10:29.280 --> 10:35.040
like Telegram, if you've been wondering about that stuff, go to joinmatrix.org.

10:35.040 --> 10:40.280
It's a kind of recent website that's pretty concise and it kind of walks you through that

10:40.280 --> 10:45.120
basic kind of stuff that I think is pretty reasonable to ask.

10:45.120 --> 10:47.480
They call it a platform for the people, by the people.

10:47.480 --> 10:53.600
They say, imagine a place where you are welcome to be yourself, where you have control of

10:53.600 --> 10:59.320
your data and where you can talk more privately while also allowing you to socialize with

10:59.320 --> 11:00.960
others.

11:00.960 --> 11:08.000
And that's really kind of key, right, because you have these public rooms that are unencrypted

11:08.000 --> 11:12.040
and then you have these private rooms that are encrypted right next to each other in

11:12.040 --> 11:13.920
one interface.

11:13.920 --> 11:14.920
It's really great.

11:14.920 --> 11:19.280
I've been using Matrix more and more the last few weeks just because it's really grown.

11:19.280 --> 11:24.120
I think we have nearly 2,000 users, not necessarily all with accounts on our server.

11:24.120 --> 11:28.280
I think it's probably less than half the people that have accounts on our server.

11:28.280 --> 11:34.020
We haven't gotten the numbers yet, but I would guess 30% maybe create accounts on our server,

11:34.020 --> 11:35.760
maybe less.

11:35.760 --> 11:39.740
And then there's a real high mix of people that have a matrix.org account or they have

11:39.740 --> 11:46.600
created a home server that they just use for themselves.

11:46.600 --> 11:50.880
We were doing some troubleshooting and upgrading and maintenance and all manner of things to

11:50.880 --> 11:51.880
the server.

11:51.880 --> 11:56.240
And as part of that in the logs, we got to see a partial list of all the various names

11:56.240 --> 11:57.440
of the home servers connected in.

11:57.440 --> 12:04.120
It's an amazing, diverse, hilarious, clever list of host names that the audience has.

12:04.120 --> 12:05.120
Yeah.

12:05.120 --> 12:06.880
Yeah, we had a good chuckle at a lot of them.

12:06.880 --> 12:10.560
It's really funny, too, because I didn't realize it kept a list, but what were we looking at?

12:10.560 --> 12:12.800
We were looking at my login session.

12:12.800 --> 12:16.440
We were watching my login session sink down, so it's like people who have PMed me.

12:16.440 --> 12:20.800
It's not the contents of the message, but it's the domain name of their matrix server.

12:20.800 --> 12:23.040
There's a lot of really good ones in there.

12:23.040 --> 12:26.400
A lot of people, I think, are just experimenting and trying this.

12:26.400 --> 12:28.600
We've been looking at ways of adding capacity.

12:28.600 --> 12:29.600
We're trying to quickly.

12:29.600 --> 12:34.960
Wes, you've been digging into workers and all of that kind of stuff.

12:34.960 --> 12:38.880
What do you feel like is the last big change you did recently that's probably getting us

12:38.880 --> 12:40.680
the most bang for the buck?

12:40.680 --> 12:47.240
Well, for the moment, we've turned off use presence on the home server, and then we also

12:47.240 --> 12:49.120
set up a generic worker.

12:49.120 --> 12:52.520
So we've got the main Synapse process, and then we've also got a secondary worker, so

12:52.520 --> 12:53.520
they can kind of split the load.

12:53.520 --> 12:57.280
And the worker can do a bunch of the client and federation things, and Synapse can do

12:57.280 --> 12:58.280
basically everything else.

12:58.280 --> 12:59.280
Yeah.

12:59.280 --> 13:00.280
That's so sweet.

13:00.280 --> 13:01.280
That is so sweet.

13:01.280 --> 13:03.800
Now, if you're chatting, I see people are chatting on YouTube.

13:03.800 --> 13:05.280
Hello everybody, and on Twitch.

13:05.280 --> 13:06.280
Okay.

13:06.280 --> 13:07.280
All right.

13:07.280 --> 13:08.280
Good.

13:08.280 --> 13:10.560
We're going to get some people joining us in the Mumble Room in a little bit.

13:10.560 --> 13:15.120
We're not actively monitoring the chats on Twitch and YouTube, because we're trying to

13:15.120 --> 13:18.060
use the matrix chat as an experiment today.

13:18.060 --> 13:21.540
So what you see up on stream plus the IRC is what I'm monitoring.

13:21.540 --> 13:26.280
But you know, we still guide you here, even if you're not one of those chat rooms.

13:26.280 --> 13:30.120
I'll try to check in on the other chat rooms from time to time.

13:30.120 --> 13:31.120
Yeah.

13:31.120 --> 13:32.120
Wes has been working hard.

13:32.120 --> 13:40.360
We're working on our plans to basically fix the fact that we set this matrix server up

13:40.360 --> 13:46.160
mostly as a science experiment for Linux Unplugged to learn about matrix and to experiment with

13:46.160 --> 13:50.000
building a matrix server and get insights to what that's like.

13:50.000 --> 13:56.120
And well, basically, it's turned into something that's actually used in production.

13:56.120 --> 14:01.120
And yeah, so now we need to take it a little more seriously is basically where we're at.

14:01.120 --> 14:05.960
And we're going to now look at redesigning this thing and making a more production grade

14:05.960 --> 14:06.960
setup out of it.

14:06.960 --> 14:10.000
And I think we're going to chat a little bit more about that in Linux Unplugged this Sunday,

14:10.000 --> 14:13.000
so because we'll have a better idea by then.

14:13.000 --> 14:14.560
So we'll get it figured out.

14:14.560 --> 14:18.520
So just as a reminder, if you're just joining us, join our matrix system.

14:18.520 --> 14:22.520
Probably the most straightforward way would be to go to app.element.io and then create

14:22.520 --> 14:28.620
an account on matrix.org and then join the colony.jupyterbroadcasting matrix server.

14:28.620 --> 14:32.500
You can also create an account on colony.jupyterbroadcasting.com.

14:32.500 --> 14:37.480
It's just not guaranteed to be around forever.

14:37.480 --> 14:45.000
So what I started working on this week is the 2022 JB road trip plan.

14:45.000 --> 14:46.000
What?

14:46.000 --> 14:47.640
This sounds very exciting.

14:47.640 --> 14:48.640
I am very excited.

14:48.640 --> 14:49.640
Tell us more.

14:49.640 --> 14:53.280
You know, I don't know exactly where to go.

14:53.280 --> 14:54.280
So it'll be just...

14:54.280 --> 14:55.280
Oh, I have one.

14:55.280 --> 14:56.480
It'll be a little bit after the East Coast meetups.

14:56.480 --> 15:01.320
We'll have just been to the East Coast because that's coming up, but what do you think, Brent?

15:01.320 --> 15:05.680
Well, we've been toying around with the idea of going to see JPL for the last six months

15:05.680 --> 15:06.680
or so.

15:06.680 --> 15:07.680
Would that be...

15:07.680 --> 15:10.120
Could I put a vote in for that?

15:10.120 --> 15:17.160
You know, my instinct, despite the cost of gasoline and RV parks in California, I was

15:17.160 --> 15:22.000
kind of thinking California because it's been a couple of years, we'll have just been on

15:22.000 --> 15:28.320
the East Coast, there's JPL, and we could possibly time it around scale.

15:28.320 --> 15:29.320
That would be exciting.

15:29.320 --> 15:30.320
I've never been.

15:30.320 --> 15:31.320
That might make the most sense.

15:31.320 --> 15:34.000
It's like a JB road trip to scale.

15:34.000 --> 15:35.680
Oh, right.

15:35.680 --> 15:38.920
It's sort of us coming back to conferences in person, you know?

15:38.920 --> 15:39.920
Yeah.

15:39.920 --> 15:40.920
Yeah.

15:40.920 --> 15:41.920
And I think it would be after...

15:41.920 --> 15:42.920
Is scale...

15:42.920 --> 15:43.920
It's like in September, maybe?

15:43.920 --> 15:47.960
I think it could be after peak heat, but I can't recall exactly.

15:47.960 --> 15:48.960
That's what I care about.

15:48.960 --> 15:51.000
Did you write yourself notes about peak heat last year?

15:51.000 --> 15:54.000
Well, I just really don't want to make that mistake again.

15:54.000 --> 15:56.840
You were traveling in September and it was pretty bad.

15:56.840 --> 15:57.840
Yeah.

15:57.840 --> 16:00.040
Yeah, it was record breaking hot.

16:00.040 --> 16:01.040
It was...

16:01.040 --> 16:03.560
Rubik Man says, how about going to Canada?

16:03.560 --> 16:06.680
I'd love to go to Alaska, but I think I need a different rig for that.

16:06.680 --> 16:09.680
That's what I'd love to do.

16:09.680 --> 16:10.680
July.

16:10.680 --> 16:11.680
So...

16:11.680 --> 16:12.680
Oh, okay.

16:12.680 --> 16:13.680
So maybe...

16:13.680 --> 16:14.680
Do we not have this...

16:14.680 --> 16:15.680
Is this room not open?

16:15.680 --> 16:16.680
No.

16:16.680 --> 16:17.680
This room should be open.

16:17.680 --> 16:18.680
Our JB chat room should be open to folks that aren't on...

16:18.680 --> 16:21.640
There's tons of people in there that aren't from our server.

16:21.640 --> 16:22.640
But people are...

16:22.640 --> 16:25.640
Yeah, just someone scrolled by there.

16:25.640 --> 16:31.040
Some peeps be saying that they are getting like the, nah, you can't come in here, air

16:31.040 --> 16:32.040
messages.

16:32.040 --> 16:34.240
Nah, you can't come in here, air messages.

16:34.240 --> 16:39.400
But I don't see nothing in here that says nothing about nothing in regards to that.

16:39.400 --> 16:43.040
But you know, this is an experiment, as they say.

16:43.040 --> 16:45.840
I don't know.

16:45.840 --> 16:48.480
What I appreciate about this is that we're learning just as much as they are.

16:48.480 --> 16:49.480
Oh, geez.

16:49.480 --> 16:55.000
I know I'm learning more about workers than I ever wanted to, I'll tell you what.

16:55.000 --> 16:57.960
Yeah, you're going to be a Python expert soon.

16:57.960 --> 16:59.680
Oh, come on now.

16:59.680 --> 17:00.680
Who can read history?

17:00.680 --> 17:02.700
All right, I'm going to say anyone.

17:02.700 --> 17:05.180
Maybe that's what the issue is, is people haven't...

17:05.180 --> 17:06.180
Maybe it's they need...

17:06.180 --> 17:09.820
All right, so I'm changing that to anyone can read history.

17:09.820 --> 17:11.440
And perhaps that will change it.

17:11.440 --> 17:13.380
All right, continue to try it, my friends.

17:13.380 --> 17:14.380
We shall see.

17:14.380 --> 17:15.380
Uh-oh.

17:15.380 --> 17:19.000
People are now trying to just sign up to our server to try to solve their problem.

17:19.000 --> 17:21.280
We got more and more people in the old Mumble room there.

17:21.280 --> 17:22.280
Hello, Mumble room.

17:22.280 --> 17:23.280
Good to see people coming in.

17:23.280 --> 17:24.280
Hello, hello.

17:24.280 --> 17:27.600
I was just connecting to Elements again.

17:27.600 --> 17:28.600
It takes ages.

17:28.600 --> 17:29.600
Yeah.

17:29.600 --> 17:30.600
So to connect to JB...

17:30.600 --> 17:31.600
It does.

17:31.600 --> 17:32.600
Oh, it's horrible.

17:32.600 --> 17:33.600
Yeah, it's horrible.

17:33.600 --> 17:36.920
So you have to boost that server a little bit.

17:36.920 --> 17:41.440
And there is that company called Linode, you know that one?

17:41.440 --> 17:42.440
I guess that...

17:42.440 --> 17:46.720
Yeah, that's partly why we're recommending that people sign up with matrix.org.

17:46.720 --> 17:50.080
It might speed that up, right?

17:50.080 --> 17:51.080
It is.

17:51.080 --> 17:52.440
Yeah, it's just...

17:52.440 --> 18:00.860
So the short version is Synapse, the back end of Matrix, is pretty single threaded.

18:00.860 --> 18:05.660
So you can have, in our case, a six-core rig, but it's only used in one core.

18:05.660 --> 18:09.600
And then what they've done in the last few releases is they have developed this thing

18:09.600 --> 18:11.560
called Workers.

18:11.560 --> 18:14.360
And there's a lot of different workers.

18:14.360 --> 18:23.160
And each worker, there's like maybe a category for these workers, a federation syncing, all

18:23.160 --> 18:26.440
kinds of different stuff, all the things that Matrix is responsible for.

18:26.440 --> 18:28.000
And some of them have like...

18:28.000 --> 18:31.640
Maybe there's like six or seven workers you could configure for federation syncing and

18:31.640 --> 18:34.140
federation communications.

18:34.140 --> 18:39.400
And each one of those workers requires its own set of configurations.

18:39.400 --> 18:44.720
You look at it and it is very possible to split this thing up into a multi-threaded

18:44.720 --> 18:52.760
beast of performance, but you're kind of doing all of the plumbing yourself and you can mess

18:52.760 --> 18:56.360
that up on a production system and break it.

18:56.360 --> 19:03.800
But what Wes did last night, late into the night, was do some basic plumbing.

19:03.800 --> 19:04.800
And what?

19:04.800 --> 19:06.740
Do we have two workers now, Wes, or three workers?

19:06.740 --> 19:10.760
I should probably let you talk about the details, but now we have some workers in there taking

19:10.760 --> 19:12.280
the load off of the main thread.

19:12.280 --> 19:17.920
Yeah, we did kind of just start in the plumbing direction, so it's kind of like, okay, can

19:17.920 --> 19:24.080
we get from entirely just basically running a database in Synapse to having this more

19:24.080 --> 19:26.240
split out architecture?

19:26.240 --> 19:29.240
So we have not gone all the way down the path that we probably will end up going.

19:29.240 --> 19:34.200
So right now, yeah, it's the one sort of original main process that we started with.

19:34.200 --> 19:41.160
And then for a bunch of URLs that match regexes that the Synapse project provides, those get

19:41.160 --> 19:46.880
filtered out and sent to our, quote, generic worker worker, which can do a whole bunch

19:46.880 --> 19:51.000
of the various things that, as you said, that Synapse has to do to sort of implement the

19:51.000 --> 19:52.000
matrix protocol.

19:52.000 --> 19:57.040
And then one of the other things we could do is we could start doing more like specific

19:57.040 --> 20:07.280
workers to improve sync time and NGINX reverse proxies to take the HTTP load off of the main

20:07.280 --> 20:08.280
thread.

20:08.280 --> 20:13.200
I still think like the bulk of the work is probably being done by the main thread, though,

20:13.200 --> 20:14.200
but it's way better.

20:14.200 --> 20:20.160
Yeah, and I think, you know, as we can, as you said, you know, we've got some good number

20:20.160 --> 20:23.960
of processors in this box, so I think there's still some room to go in that direction.

20:23.960 --> 20:29.520
And we haven't really, you know, gotten as deep into the areas of understanding the actual

20:29.520 --> 20:33.200
performance levels of Synapse as well, like they do, you know, there's a lot of logs that

20:33.200 --> 20:34.200
come out of that thing.

20:34.200 --> 20:38.200
They've also got some Prometheus metrics that you can hook into.

20:38.200 --> 20:40.160
There's an admin UI that we want to play with.

20:40.160 --> 20:41.160
So there's like a lot of those things.

20:41.160 --> 20:45.400
So we're pretty early in the journal of understanding, like, how does this thing actually behave now

20:45.400 --> 20:47.720
that we have so many people?

20:47.720 --> 20:51.120
When there's so much conversation, you know, it's, you can kind of like, you have to just

20:51.120 --> 20:54.440
grep through a lot of stuff to even get to the point of like, can I see myself logging

20:54.440 --> 20:55.440
in over here?

20:55.440 --> 20:56.440
Yeah.

20:56.440 --> 20:59.000
Yeah, there's a lot.

20:59.000 --> 21:00.660
And so we're looking into it.

21:00.660 --> 21:03.680
And we're also going to look into like hardware changes we could do.

21:03.680 --> 21:08.000
Nav suggests that I come to Ohio Linux Fest and tempts me by saying that I could swing

21:08.000 --> 21:11.360
by and we could do some work on JOOPS.

21:11.360 --> 21:14.160
That sounds pretty tempting.

21:14.160 --> 21:19.600
Eric says that scale is July 28.

21:19.600 --> 21:20.600
That's going to be hot.

21:20.600 --> 21:21.600
That sounds hot.

21:21.600 --> 21:22.600
Sounds really hot.

21:22.600 --> 21:26.080
You could always get a passport and come here.

21:26.080 --> 21:27.080
Hey, hello.

21:27.080 --> 21:28.080
What can I bring?

21:28.080 --> 21:30.960
Hey, can I bring Lady JOOPS?

21:30.960 --> 21:31.960
Does she fly?

21:31.960 --> 21:32.960
I don't know.

21:32.960 --> 21:33.960
Yeah, it's not a real...

21:33.960 --> 21:34.960
Stick some floats on it.

21:34.960 --> 21:35.960
Are you out walking right now?

21:35.960 --> 21:37.600
Can you paint a picture for us?

21:37.600 --> 21:39.200
Yeah, of course.

21:39.200 --> 21:42.840
I'm out walking, looking for the foxes.

21:42.840 --> 21:43.840
Haven't seen any yet.

21:43.840 --> 21:45.800
It's midnight over there.

21:45.800 --> 21:46.800
So I hear sirens.

21:46.800 --> 21:48.240
I hear some sounds of London.

21:48.240 --> 21:50.720
Downtown London live.

21:50.720 --> 21:51.960
That's awesome.

21:51.960 --> 21:52.960
That's great.

21:52.960 --> 21:53.960
All right.

21:53.960 --> 21:54.960
I think we're getting more people in here.

21:54.960 --> 21:55.960
Holy crap.

21:55.960 --> 21:56.960
Look at all this.

21:56.960 --> 21:57.960
All right.

21:57.960 --> 21:58.960
Anybody in the mumble room having problems getting connected right now?

21:58.960 --> 22:01.480
I see we've had some people pile in there.

22:01.480 --> 22:03.080
Oh, good.

22:03.080 --> 22:04.080
Good.

22:04.080 --> 22:05.080
All right.

22:05.080 --> 22:06.080
Very good.

22:06.080 --> 22:07.080
Well, that's awesome.

22:07.080 --> 22:08.360
Thanks, everybody.

22:08.360 --> 22:14.480
So Eric says that he can now see the history with the Matrix account, but he can't actually

22:14.480 --> 22:16.440
get into the group and chat.

22:16.440 --> 22:17.680
Oh, we got to get in there and chat.

22:17.680 --> 22:18.680
He's very curious.

22:18.680 --> 22:21.200
I'm going to need your lightning address to send you sats, so you got to be able to get

22:21.200 --> 22:22.200
in there.

22:22.200 --> 22:23.200
Yes.

22:23.200 --> 22:24.200
I wonder what the issue is.

22:24.200 --> 22:29.880
Just for a note, I have a lot of new first-timers here in the honor room, and most of them are

22:29.880 --> 22:33.920
in fact connected to Matrix.

22:33.920 --> 22:38.360
So when it comes to Chris Last's space, mum have a good eye on Matrix.

22:38.360 --> 22:39.360
Oh, yeah.

22:39.360 --> 22:40.360
Right.

22:40.360 --> 22:41.360
Very good.

22:41.360 --> 22:42.360
All right.

22:42.360 --> 22:43.360
So we do have...

22:43.360 --> 22:44.360
So, okay.

22:44.360 --> 22:45.360
Yeah, look.

22:45.360 --> 22:46.360
Okay.

22:46.360 --> 22:47.360
I'm going through here.

22:47.360 --> 22:48.360
I'm looking at the math.

22:48.360 --> 22:49.360
And like, here's Murph in here.

22:49.360 --> 22:52.360
Murph's connected from the Matrix.org home server.

22:52.360 --> 22:53.600
I'm looking at Austin here.

22:53.600 --> 22:56.920
Austin is like connected to some custom server.

22:56.920 --> 22:58.200
He just logged off.

22:58.200 --> 22:59.200
But you know what I'm saying?

22:59.200 --> 23:00.200
Like he wasn't...

23:00.200 --> 23:01.320
Now I'm looking at Green Moth there.

23:01.320 --> 23:03.120
Green Moth, he's on Matrix.org.

23:03.120 --> 23:06.520
There's propaganda out there that you can't come in.

23:06.520 --> 23:07.760
There's propaganda.

23:07.760 --> 23:09.240
That's not even real.

23:09.240 --> 23:11.360
It may be we have some permission wrong.

23:11.360 --> 23:17.280
If any of us are an element expert, anybody an element expert that knows the UI, my problem

23:17.280 --> 23:18.960
is the damn UI.

23:18.960 --> 23:22.520
Here's the thing about Matrix, and I've got to be totally upfront about this.

23:22.520 --> 23:25.400
It is still rough around the edges.

23:25.400 --> 23:28.560
There are multiple clients in the works.

23:28.560 --> 23:31.220
Some of them are like native GTK or Qt.

23:31.220 --> 23:35.400
Some of them are Electron as well.

23:35.400 --> 23:37.040
It's not fully polished.

23:37.040 --> 23:41.480
Element is probably the most functional with the biggest team behind it.

23:41.480 --> 23:47.640
But as I have started using it more and more over the last few weeks, I've really come

23:47.640 --> 23:50.120
to appreciate the interconnected of it.

23:50.120 --> 23:53.080
I'm chatting with people on their own home servers.

23:53.080 --> 23:56.600
I'm in a chat with some Red Hatters.

23:56.600 --> 23:57.760
There's a Red Hat Matrix now.

23:57.760 --> 24:00.040
A lot of open source projects have come on.

24:00.040 --> 24:03.360
The GNOME developers are all on Matrix now.

24:03.360 --> 24:06.840
It's getting more and more popular in the free software community.

24:06.840 --> 24:09.460
It's also getting more popular in our community.

24:09.460 --> 24:14.720
And it's at that stage that, remember how Google Plus was like this for a really long

24:14.720 --> 24:20.960
time where it was like Linus Torvalds and Greg KH and really great contributors to your

24:20.960 --> 24:25.060
Google Plus feed and it was way better than Twitter once the normals got there?

24:25.060 --> 24:26.920
That's where Matrix is right now.

24:26.920 --> 24:32.560
Or it's like Twitter was back in the early days before the normals got there.

24:32.560 --> 24:35.520
It's just nerdy stuff.

24:35.520 --> 24:39.520
And it's nice too because while Telegram is really great for like mobile communication

24:39.520 --> 24:45.680
and it has served us super well and we have a Telegram group still going at jupiterbroadcasting.com

24:45.680 --> 24:52.120
slash telegram, the nice thing that Matrix can do is that Discord style or that Slack

24:52.120 --> 24:54.480
style individual channels.

24:54.480 --> 24:59.760
So like, you know, all of the Coder chat is in the Coder radio room and all of the Linux

24:59.760 --> 25:03.920
unplugged chat is in the feedback room and all the Bitcoin stuff's in the Bitcoin room

25:03.920 --> 25:08.320
and all the Nix stuff because we're doing the Nix challenge right now is in the Nix

25:08.320 --> 25:12.760
room and that's why we sent people to the Nix room and not Telegram because what we

25:12.760 --> 25:18.160
find is when we have a topic on a show, we're sitting there yucking on a show about something

25:18.160 --> 25:21.840
and then everybody just comes in and they blast the Telegram group, which fine, we'd

25:21.840 --> 25:24.760
like to hear from them, but people in the Telegram group don't necessarily like it just

25:24.760 --> 25:27.340
totally dominating the conversation.

25:27.340 --> 25:28.880
So here we can split it off.

25:28.880 --> 25:32.920
But because it's decentralized, you can have your own home server, you could be on matrix.org,

25:32.920 --> 25:36.960
you could create an account on ours and when one of them goes offline, your experience

25:36.960 --> 25:40.800
continues to go and there's not anybody that's going to shut us down or anything like that.

25:40.800 --> 25:43.920
It's just going to be us, if anything.

25:43.920 --> 25:47.320
So yeah, it's still rough.

25:47.320 --> 25:50.840
It's not great, but neither was the early internet.

25:50.840 --> 25:54.600
You know, back in my day, the best thing about the early internet was that Netscape had little

25:54.600 --> 25:58.700
stars shooting over the end and the rest of it was total junk, right?

25:58.700 --> 26:03.480
I'm telling you, like it gets better from here and they've made steady progress on element

26:03.480 --> 26:07.160
and the fact that they have the web app too, I don't know, I find that makes it really

26:07.160 --> 26:08.160
compelling.

26:08.160 --> 26:10.960
I think it makes it really nice because then you can open it up in a tab like I have today

26:10.960 --> 26:14.780
and I can just throw it up on the live stream or something.

26:14.780 --> 26:20.140
So if you can get that set up, but I'll tell you what, if it doesn't end up working, we

26:20.140 --> 26:22.120
also have the IRC's fallback.

26:22.120 --> 26:25.520
So don't worry, you'll still get some stats if you want to participate, but we are trying

26:25.520 --> 26:28.880
to do it in the matrix room because we want to experiment with that.

26:28.880 --> 26:33.280
Plus we're, honestly, I'm just curious how far we can push this thing because man is

26:33.280 --> 26:34.960
it on the edge right now.

26:34.960 --> 26:42.120
So let's see what happens when a live stream jumps on there and really bangs on this thing.

26:42.120 --> 26:48.280
And if I know one, I know one issue we've had in the past was with latency and I don't

26:48.280 --> 26:50.480
know if I'm seeing that now.

26:50.480 --> 26:53.340
So some of West's magic must have helped that it helped.

26:53.340 --> 26:54.340
It definitely helped.

26:54.340 --> 26:58.280
I know we have more work to do, but it definitely helped.

26:58.280 --> 27:05.480
I think it's one of those problems and I bet you tell me what you think West, but it feels

27:05.480 --> 27:09.920
like one of those problems where there's a couple of low-hanging fruit things you could

27:09.920 --> 27:14.680
do, but the net performance gain is going to be in finding nearly all the optimizations

27:14.680 --> 27:16.680
we can take reasonably.

27:16.680 --> 27:24.200
Yeah, you know, we just have, there's so much to learn and matrix and synapse have moved

27:24.200 --> 27:29.760
so fast in just the past few releases, the past year or two since we started deploying

27:29.760 --> 27:30.760
it.

27:30.760 --> 27:34.000
You know, workers coming online, a lot of the docs changing or practices changing or

27:34.000 --> 27:35.000
APIs.

27:35.000 --> 27:40.120
And we also really need to get familiar with like more of the database schema so we can

27:40.120 --> 27:47.960
get our database maintenance on point and figure out stuff like retention policies and

27:47.960 --> 27:50.760
what settings need to be tuned, none of which we've really explored.

27:50.760 --> 27:55.840
I mean, you know, little pieces here or there, but there's a lot of knobs to turn.

27:55.840 --> 27:59.640
As we started looking more and more into it, I was like, you know what this feels like?

27:59.640 --> 28:04.680
It feels like it's as complex as Exchange was, it's like learning Exchange 5.5 and Exchange

28:04.680 --> 28:05.680
2003.

28:05.680 --> 28:10.480
It feels like running an Exchange server, which is not necessarily a good thing.

28:10.480 --> 28:13.880
I don't know, I should probably just mention that we have the April 9th meetup just around

28:13.880 --> 28:14.880
the corner.

28:14.880 --> 28:20.460
I've actually got my bags to start packing.

28:20.460 --> 28:24.440
So that is just around the corner if you are in that neck of the woods, April 9th.

28:24.440 --> 28:26.760
Now, okay, here's the giveaway details.

28:26.760 --> 28:27.760
Here's what you need to know.

28:27.760 --> 28:33.480
You need to get in our matrix room, we have the JB chat, the general chat room.

28:33.480 --> 28:37.840
You can grab our mumble details at linuxunplug.com slash mumble if you've got any questions about

28:37.840 --> 28:38.840
that.

28:38.840 --> 28:40.980
And here's the other critical piece.

28:40.980 --> 28:43.180
You need a new podcasting app.

28:43.180 --> 28:45.840
You need a podcasting 2.0 app that has the Lightning Wallet.

28:45.840 --> 28:52.040
So you can go to newpodcastingapps.com, that's newpodcastingapps.com, and you get yourself

28:52.040 --> 28:53.520
a new podcast app.

28:53.520 --> 28:58.600
I really like Fountain FM because it has an Android client and an iOS client.

28:58.600 --> 29:06.600
But if you're just on iOS, Cast-O-Matic is great, it has CarPlay and it's iOS specific.

29:06.600 --> 29:08.320
I've been enjoying Fountain FM.

29:08.320 --> 29:15.280
It has a unique UI where they surface clipped podcasts, they really focus on the clips.

29:15.280 --> 29:17.780
And I've actually discovered a couple of new podcasts that way.

29:17.780 --> 29:20.000
So that's what I've been enjoying about Fountain.

29:20.000 --> 29:24.540
You'll get one of these apps and then you'll have a Lightning Wallet in there.

29:24.540 --> 29:29.160
In Cast-O-Matic, you have to subscribe to a podcast and you have to actually bring up

29:29.160 --> 29:34.400
the play page and in the little boost area, there's a gear icon to get your wallet.

29:34.400 --> 29:36.400
On Fountain FM, the wallet's pretty obvious.

29:36.400 --> 29:38.920
But here's what I'd like you to do is go get one of these apps, pick the one that works

29:38.920 --> 29:39.920
best for you.

29:39.920 --> 29:43.560
There's some web apps as well at newpodcastapps.com.

29:43.560 --> 29:47.880
Locate your Lightning payment address because you're gonna invoice me and I'm gonna send

29:47.880 --> 29:49.760
you a thousand sats.

29:49.760 --> 29:55.180
So you gotta get this invoicing thing figured out and then you send me it and I will pay

29:55.180 --> 29:59.360
it and that'll get your wallet set up with a thousand sats so you can start boosting

29:59.360 --> 30:03.120
podcasts that support value for value and get you going out there.

30:03.120 --> 30:06.660
So either one of those apps or the web apps can do this for you.

30:06.660 --> 30:09.560
So go get that now, newpodcastapps.com.

30:09.560 --> 30:12.040
Fountain FM is the one I've been recommending.

30:12.040 --> 30:15.480
And while you guys get that set up and you get in the matrix room, I kind of have a nice

30:15.480 --> 30:19.280
treat for us.

30:19.280 --> 30:23.600
One of those opportunities, something just kind of clicked and I got to sit down with

30:23.600 --> 30:45.440
the developer of Fountain FM, Oscar Mary, who's also in London and he joins us now.

30:45.440 --> 30:49.520
So I gotta start with what is probably the number one question on my mind.

30:49.520 --> 30:53.300
I think Fountain is one of the more exciting apps in a while.

30:53.300 --> 30:58.240
And when I started going through it, I realized this is actually a pretty complicated app

30:58.240 --> 31:01.680
that has a lot of screens, that does a lot of things.

31:01.680 --> 31:05.600
This is a huge project and I bet a lot of people who use a podcast app kind of think

31:05.600 --> 31:06.600
it's a simple thing.

31:06.600 --> 31:07.600
Oh, it's no big deal.

31:07.600 --> 31:11.960
It just pulls down the RSS feeds and plays an MP3 file, how hard could that be?

31:11.960 --> 31:16.000
Why did you want to take on a crazy project like this when there's a pretty good handful

31:16.000 --> 31:17.560
of podcast apps out there now?

31:17.560 --> 31:19.360
Yeah, it's a great question.

31:19.360 --> 31:26.440
So I think I'm a massive fan of podcasts and one of the things that I have a strong belief

31:26.440 --> 31:33.840
in is that there's incredible insight and wisdom that's locked away in podcast content.

31:33.840 --> 31:40.280
And there's a few issues with the format in the sense that number one, most people that

31:40.280 --> 31:46.320
are really into podcasts just have too many in their feed to even listen to.

31:46.320 --> 31:52.800
So I probably have about eight to 10 hours of podcast content that shows up in my feed

31:52.800 --> 31:57.700
every single day and I'm never going to be able to get to that content.

31:57.700 --> 32:01.720
But there's probably incredible stuff in there that I'd love to listen to.

32:01.720 --> 32:09.160
So one of the things we're trying to do with Fountain is actually make it easy for listeners

32:09.160 --> 32:15.920
to actually surface the best moments in the episodes and share those moments with their

32:15.920 --> 32:19.240
friends, family, or just people that they know.

32:19.240 --> 32:26.080
So what we've done is we've given the listener the ability to create and share clips within

32:26.080 --> 32:31.880
Fountain and we've done this by using the actual word by word transcripts such that

32:31.880 --> 32:36.540
you don't have to mess around editing an audio wave on your mobile device where there's not

32:36.540 --> 32:37.540
much screen.

32:37.540 --> 32:41.880
You can actually just select the text of the transcript that you want and that makes it

32:41.880 --> 32:45.120
much, much easier to actually create a clip.

32:45.120 --> 32:50.480
We also have social features on Fountain, which means that if you follow me on Fountain

32:50.480 --> 32:55.640
and I create a clip, you'll see that appear on your home screen the next time you open

32:55.640 --> 32:56.920
the app.

32:56.920 --> 33:01.240
So yeah, we're really just trying to solve the problem of allowing people to surface

33:01.240 --> 33:06.580
the best moments from podcasts just because we believe that, yeah, there's so much great

33:06.580 --> 33:08.480
content out there.

33:08.480 --> 33:11.360
Another example of this is the back catalog, right?

33:11.360 --> 33:19.400
If you discover a new show, a lot of shows have hundreds of episodes in the back catalog.

33:19.400 --> 33:23.360
How are you supposed to go back through that and figure out what a good episode might be?

33:23.360 --> 33:27.200
Well, what we also have on Fountain is clip playlists.

33:27.200 --> 33:32.160
So you can actually take clips that either you've created or someone else has created,

33:32.160 --> 33:36.200
stick them in a playlist and then people can go and browse those.

33:36.200 --> 33:39.560
If they find a clip that they like, which might be a minute long, they can then go and

33:39.560 --> 33:42.720
click through to the episode and listen to the full episode.

33:42.720 --> 33:48.280
So yeah, we're trying to make it easier to discover and share great moments from podcasts.

33:48.280 --> 33:50.240
Oh, I love that.

33:50.240 --> 33:56.840
Obviously, as a longtime podcaster, I felt like the shareability of YouTube videos really,

33:56.840 --> 34:00.760
really showed us where podcasting was lacking in a feature.

34:00.760 --> 34:05.040
And I think what you guys have done with the share feature, the clip feature is it's nice,

34:05.040 --> 34:10.120
it has the album art on there, it has waveform on there, it looks presentable like you could

34:10.120 --> 34:13.920
actually share it on social media or YouTube, or you could just listen to it in the app

34:13.920 --> 34:14.920
and I like that.

34:14.920 --> 34:18.400
But you said something in there that I wanted to ask you further about.

34:18.400 --> 34:20.880
You mentioned that you're enabling this with transcripts.

34:20.880 --> 34:23.400
So is the app doing transcript on device?

34:23.400 --> 34:25.720
Is that happening in the cloud?

34:25.720 --> 34:28.360
Is that part of the new podcasting 2.0 spec?

34:28.360 --> 34:29.720
How is that being done?

34:29.720 --> 34:32.920
Because this is one of those out there early features that Fountain has.

34:32.920 --> 34:35.880
It seems like all apps are going to want to have this one day.

34:35.880 --> 34:37.680
Yeah, 100%.

34:37.680 --> 34:42.240
So right now we are actually using a commercial transcription service.

34:42.240 --> 34:43.920
We're doing that in the cloud.

34:43.920 --> 34:48.200
And the reason we're doing that is because we need a special format of transcript that

34:48.200 --> 34:52.280
actually has the word by word timestamps.

34:52.280 --> 34:57.240
And that's what allows us to give the listener the ability to just select the bits of text

34:57.240 --> 34:58.240
they want.

34:58.240 --> 35:02.900
You can even edit out sentences if you want to make a more succinct clip, which we think

35:02.900 --> 35:04.200
is really important.

35:04.200 --> 35:11.080
Because again, if you have a two hour long podcast episode, when somebody is saying something,

35:11.080 --> 35:16.740
they're assuming that the person hearing what they're saying has heard the previous thing.

35:16.740 --> 35:19.000
So sometimes it's useful to cut up the clip a little bit.

35:19.000 --> 35:21.840
So yeah, we're using a commercial transcription service.

35:21.840 --> 35:25.800
It does cost us and that's why if you create a clip on Fountain, you will see that there's

35:25.800 --> 35:28.700
a slight delay as we process that transcription.

35:28.700 --> 35:37.280
We do hope to get the word by word timestamp format in the actual open standards such that

35:37.280 --> 35:42.200
podcast hosts can actually add that and then yeah, any app will be able to use it.

35:42.200 --> 35:44.920
Yeah, that was my next thought.

35:44.920 --> 35:48.400
If that became a universal thing and more podcast apps took advantage of that, I would

35:48.400 --> 35:53.240
start feeling compelled as a podcaster to start coming up with a way to automate transcriptions.

35:53.240 --> 35:57.400
It's something we've talked about as a group for a long time, but there's just never really

35:57.400 --> 35:59.080
been the right technology.

35:59.080 --> 36:04.460
So I love the clips and I think it was a bold choice for the app to open up to the Discover

36:04.460 --> 36:07.000
page that shows clips right away.

36:07.000 --> 36:10.840
Because I have to say as a new user at first, I was like, oh, I don't want this.

36:10.840 --> 36:12.800
I want my podcast.

36:12.800 --> 36:17.920
Until the day I actually discovered a new podcast from the clips and I was like, oh,

36:17.920 --> 36:18.920
I get it.

36:18.920 --> 36:19.920
I get it.

36:19.920 --> 36:23.680
But that's still like that's a you're really putting this clip feature and this social

36:23.680 --> 36:26.580
aspect of it pretty front and forward.

36:26.580 --> 36:27.580
What are your thoughts on that?

36:27.580 --> 36:30.960
Yeah, it's definitely a lot of users have asked.

36:30.960 --> 36:36.080
I would love to have the podcast tab as the first as the default tab.

36:36.080 --> 36:42.120
I think the way we think about it is over time as we build up the social graph a little

36:42.120 --> 36:46.460
bit right now, if you're a brand new user, you're not going to be following anyone.

36:46.460 --> 36:50.000
And you're just going to get popular clips which may not interest you.

36:50.000 --> 36:56.560
But I do think over time, it's actually fascinating to get that window into someone else's podcast.

36:56.560 --> 37:02.560
Listening because podcast listening is actually quite a you know, it's quite an individual

37:02.560 --> 37:03.560
thing.

37:03.560 --> 37:08.560
You listen to podcasts normally on your own and even your closest friends and family,

37:08.560 --> 37:13.240
you won't necessarily know what they're listening to or what they've listened to this week or

37:13.240 --> 37:14.240
anything like that.

37:14.240 --> 37:18.560
And it's actually fascinating to just get that window into what other people have found

37:18.560 --> 37:22.000
interesting that week and what they've clicked.

37:22.000 --> 37:23.000
Yeah.

37:23.000 --> 37:25.720
And there is there is just so many podcasts out there.

37:25.720 --> 37:28.760
It really makes discovering a new podcast difficult.

37:28.760 --> 37:33.400
And the best way is the best signal is when somebody you know or somebody you follow says,

37:33.400 --> 37:34.640
hey, this is worth a listen.

37:34.640 --> 37:39.320
Like that's that's the most valuable kind of endorsement in podcasting there is in it.

37:39.320 --> 37:41.140
So it's cool to see it baked in.

37:41.140 --> 37:47.440
One thing is that right now, in every single podcast app, really, the only way that you

37:47.440 --> 37:51.320
can listen to an episode is if you follow the show.

37:51.320 --> 37:56.360
And there's a lot of shows out there that I'm just not going to be interested enough

37:56.360 --> 38:00.560
in that topic to actually follow and want to see every episode that comes through the

38:00.560 --> 38:01.560
feed.

38:01.560 --> 38:06.120
But that doesn't mean that, you know, if there's one particular episode that's incredible and

38:06.120 --> 38:10.040
is about a story that actually does interest me, that doesn't mean I don't want to listen

38:10.040 --> 38:11.620
to that one episode, maybe.

38:11.620 --> 38:16.300
And by seeing the signal from somebody that you follow, but they've created a clip or

38:16.300 --> 38:21.560
maybe, you know, maybe they've boosted it a certain amount, that's a great signal for

38:21.560 --> 38:25.120
me to go and look at that episode and maybe add it to my feed just individually.

38:25.120 --> 38:27.520
Yeah, it's a whole new kind of metric.

38:27.520 --> 38:31.840
And it's way more valuable than anything else I've ever had for discovering podcasts.

38:31.840 --> 38:34.240
At first, I was sort of resistant to the whole social aspect of it.

38:34.240 --> 38:35.560
I'm like, no, this is a private thing.

38:35.560 --> 38:38.300
And I initially I just use the app that way.

38:38.300 --> 38:42.040
But then when I started telling the audience about it, and they started following me, I

38:42.040 --> 38:45.700
started realizing, oh, they might actually be interested in some of the clips I want

38:45.700 --> 38:46.700
to share and stuff like that.

38:46.700 --> 38:48.760
And so it kind of really opened my eyes to it.

38:48.760 --> 38:51.060
But you said something there I want to talk about now.

38:51.060 --> 38:55.840
The other really cutting edge feature you're doing here is value for value support with

38:55.840 --> 38:59.140
boost-a-grams and lightning payments.

38:59.140 --> 39:03.340
That actually, I think, is maybe one of the biggest leading features of Fountain because

39:03.340 --> 39:06.880
it creates a real incentive for people to start sharing the app.

39:06.880 --> 39:11.120
So did you get into Fountain with the idea to implement lightning from the very get-go

39:11.120 --> 39:13.960
or did that come along as you were looking at compelling features?

39:13.960 --> 39:17.880
Yeah, so we didn't actually have that idea at the start.

39:17.880 --> 39:22.920
We started with the problem of how do we surface the best moments from podcasts that I've already

39:22.920 --> 39:23.920
talked about.

39:23.920 --> 39:29.760
But one of the interesting things was I've been a massive believer in Bitcoin for many,

39:29.760 --> 39:32.700
many years, and I've followed it very closely.

39:32.700 --> 39:39.720
And so when we started following what Adam and Dave were doing with podcasting 2.0, as

39:39.720 --> 39:46.280
soon as we saw the value for value spec in there and saw what was happening with the

39:46.280 --> 39:51.560
lightning network, especially with the adoption that we've seen over the past couple of years,

39:51.560 --> 39:56.120
it was an absolute no-brainer for us and we made a decision very quickly to double down

39:56.120 --> 40:02.740
on it and make it like a key feature of Fountain because, yeah, we think that, I mean, personally,

40:02.740 --> 40:09.060
we believe it's the future of the world's monetary network and we've seen in the past

40:09.060 --> 40:10.060
six months.

40:10.060 --> 40:16.840
Cash App have rolled it out to all of their US users, so this thing is growing every month

40:16.840 --> 40:22.240
and I think it's something that apps, not just in podcasting, but many more apps that

40:22.240 --> 40:26.460
are on your phone are going to have some kind of lightning aspect to them in the future.

40:26.460 --> 40:32.740
If I were starting Jupyter broadcasting today, I absolutely would be really focused on this

40:32.740 --> 40:36.680
because one of the things you can do with the spec is you can do splits.

40:36.680 --> 40:40.880
So I could have a little bit of each boost go to my co-host, I could have it go to my

40:40.880 --> 40:44.360
editor, I could have it go to my hosting provider, I can have it go to the index, I can have

40:44.360 --> 40:46.720
it go to you.

40:46.720 --> 40:52.900
It's such a, A, essentially automatic system, B, fully transparent because it's all documented

40:52.900 --> 40:58.040
right there by the host, by the audience, the contract is the code, and it means that

40:58.040 --> 41:05.480
we can incentivize hosts to really spend time, like take hours out of their week to work

41:05.480 --> 41:06.480
on this over time.

41:06.480 --> 41:08.880
And I think it's going to be huge for future shows.

41:08.880 --> 41:15.180
And I wondered, have you really, Oscar, have you grasped the depth of enablement this could

41:15.180 --> 41:16.500
be for the medium?

41:16.500 --> 41:19.160
This I think is maybe bigger even than podcasting.

41:19.160 --> 41:21.120
Yeah, 100%.

41:21.120 --> 41:26.760
It's incredibly exciting and I think the splits is one of the most powerful features of the

41:26.760 --> 41:33.600
value block and it hasn't even, especially the episode level splits, haven't even really

41:33.600 --> 41:41.180
been adopted that much at this point because this is all very new, you know, to your average

41:41.180 --> 41:47.000
podcaster that maybe doesn't know much about Bitcoin or Lightning, maybe doesn't know much

41:47.000 --> 41:53.840
about tech, it's already a big ask to try and convince them to, you know, Lightning

41:53.840 --> 41:58.280
enable their show, create a podcaster wallet, like that's the first step.

41:58.280 --> 42:03.400
And then to start talking about, okay, episode level splits and, you know, different Lightning

42:03.400 --> 42:09.240
node pub keys in the splits for different guests and producers, you know, there's a

42:09.240 --> 42:15.560
lot in here, but 100%, I agree with you, over time, there's so much creative, there's so

42:15.560 --> 42:18.040
many creative things we can actually do with the splits.

42:18.040 --> 42:23.760
So for example, one of the things that I think about a lot is if you're interviewing someone

42:23.760 --> 42:28.920
on your show that has an amazing cause or an amazing open source project or whatever

42:28.920 --> 42:34.760
it is, you can actually say to your audience who you've built up all of this trust with

42:34.760 --> 42:39.080
over the years as a podcast host, you can say to them, hey guys, if you want to support

42:39.080 --> 42:44.200
this cause, you don't have to do anything different to what you already do.

42:44.200 --> 42:49.960
Just send a boost and, you know, 50%, 60% or 100% will go to that guest and support

42:49.960 --> 42:50.960
that cause.

42:50.960 --> 42:52.640
So I think there's so much we can do there.

42:52.640 --> 42:59.320
Yeah, that is, that's my dream is I believe that, and I think a lot of people who are

42:59.320 --> 43:03.440
involved in podcasting 2.0 probably see this as well, I think the podcasting landscape

43:03.440 --> 43:09.480
is shifting for independent content, 50% of weekly listeners are now consolidated into

43:09.480 --> 43:11.840
just four or five podcast apps.

43:11.840 --> 43:17.280
It's getting really, it's getting really thick out there and then you combine like some censorship

43:17.280 --> 43:20.840
issues that can crop up because things change over time.

43:20.840 --> 43:24.360
And this value for value model solves all of that.

43:24.360 --> 43:30.040
And the lightning payment system is the missing piece that I think was always kind of necessary.

43:30.040 --> 43:34.520
I have, you know, I've seen a lot of resistance to PayPal and other systems like that.

43:34.520 --> 43:37.720
So that's really exciting, but, and I think it's huge and I think it could be ginormous

43:37.720 --> 43:42.560
for free software because you imagine if the JB audience over time, you know, we get two

43:42.560 --> 43:49.520
or 3000, four or 5000 people or more on the lightning network and then the VLC app comes

43:49.520 --> 43:52.320
online or OBS comes onto the lightning network.

43:52.320 --> 43:54.400
Like they're going to immediately have support.

43:54.400 --> 43:55.480
It's going to be huge.

43:55.480 --> 44:00.840
The network effect is going to be valuable, but it seems like the tricky part is getting

44:00.840 --> 44:02.380
people on board right now.

44:02.380 --> 44:06.200
This is the number one thing that is tricky because if you've never bought Bitcoin, if

44:06.200 --> 44:10.880
you've never got into this ecosystem at all, but now you feel compelled to support, how

44:10.880 --> 44:14.140
do you even solve this problem for most people, Oscar?

44:14.140 --> 44:18.360
Because it's very complicated, it involves multiple apps and identifying yourself to

44:18.360 --> 44:23.200
some financial services in some cases, it's a thick, tricky process right now.

44:23.200 --> 44:24.200
Yeah.

44:24.200 --> 44:28.160
100% is definitely the biggest problem now that's limiting adoption.

44:28.160 --> 44:29.720
And yeah, it's a struggle.

44:29.720 --> 44:35.840
I think a couple of things, so I'll explain how we recommend you get started in a second.

44:35.840 --> 44:41.040
But first I'll just say that what gives me optimism around this problem is that it's

44:41.040 --> 44:43.080
not just fountain.

44:43.080 --> 44:45.560
It's not even just podcasting 2.0.

44:45.560 --> 44:49.960
It's not even just podcasting that's going to be trying to solve this problem.

44:49.960 --> 44:53.020
Every single app is adopting Lightning.

44:53.020 --> 44:58.760
And so yeah, Cash App just onboarded 65 million people in the US who now have access to Lightning

44:58.760 --> 45:01.860
on their main payment app.

45:01.860 --> 45:06.720
So these onboarding challenges are being solved not even by us.

45:06.720 --> 45:09.240
Every month a new company will add an integration.

45:09.240 --> 45:14.600
And so eventually we'll get to the point where someone will see a Lightning invoice in an

45:14.600 --> 45:18.000
app and they'll just instantly know, yeah, okay, I know how to do that.

45:18.000 --> 45:22.320
And the app to app integrations will start being offered as well.

45:22.320 --> 45:25.200
So you don't even have to copy the Lightning invoice across.

45:25.200 --> 45:29.680
You can just say pay with Lightning and it will just open up Cash App, give you a confirmation

45:29.680 --> 45:30.680
and you're done.

45:30.680 --> 45:33.120
And the thing I think to stress there too is it's an open network.

45:33.120 --> 45:37.360
So if you buy something, if you buy Bitcoin in the Cash App, you can move it to the Fountain

45:37.360 --> 45:40.940
App or if you want to take some money out of your Fountain App, you could move it back

45:40.940 --> 45:44.000
to another app because it's all an open protocol and an open network.

45:44.000 --> 45:45.000
Exactly.

45:45.000 --> 45:48.520
Which is the amazing thing about it, which, you know, it drives competition.

45:48.520 --> 45:52.760
It means that at the end of the day, the consumer's going to have a better experience because

45:52.760 --> 45:56.680
they can always just move their funds to any app.

45:56.680 --> 45:59.080
So it's so easy to switch between services.

45:59.080 --> 46:00.080
Yes.

46:00.080 --> 46:01.080
Oh, finally.

46:01.080 --> 46:04.560
So now how are you recommending people get on board right now?

46:04.560 --> 46:07.440
Like what has been the smoothest process that you've seen?

46:07.440 --> 46:08.440
Yeah.

46:08.440 --> 46:13.360
So right now what we recommend is so you've downloaded the Fountain App and you want to

46:13.360 --> 46:18.400
get some Bitcoin, some SATs in Fountain for the first time.

46:18.400 --> 46:24.600
What we recommend is using an app called Blue Wallet, which is available internationally.

46:24.600 --> 46:29.360
And on Blue Wallet, you can actually buy Bitcoin with Apple Pay.

46:29.360 --> 46:32.880
So that's like the easiest way to do it.

46:32.880 --> 46:38.600
Download Blue Wallet, buy Bitcoin on the Lightning Network with Apple Pay, and then you can transfer

46:38.600 --> 46:40.480
it back into Fountain.

46:40.480 --> 46:46.760
Again, it's still quite a convoluted process and we're hoping to at some point have the

46:46.760 --> 46:51.400
ability to actually, you know, what I'd love is the ability to buy Bitcoin within Fountain.

46:51.400 --> 46:56.040
But once we offer that, we go down a path of, you know, financial regulations and all

46:56.040 --> 46:58.720
of that, which at the end of the day, we are a podcast app.

46:58.720 --> 47:00.920
So I don't think we want to be doing that.

47:00.920 --> 47:04.280
Yeah, that can get pretty tricky pretty quick.

47:04.280 --> 47:08.200
And you know, the great thing about it is people could go the traditional route.

47:08.200 --> 47:10.480
You know, like you said, they could go Blue Wallet.

47:10.480 --> 47:14.080
In the U.S., I've been telling people Strike is a really easy way to do it.

47:14.080 --> 47:15.760
Those are traditional financial apps.

47:15.760 --> 47:17.680
Yeah, Strike's great in the U.S.

47:17.680 --> 47:18.680
Yeah.

47:18.680 --> 47:22.520
But you could go the route of like meet a guy in an alley and, you know, sell them some

47:22.520 --> 47:23.880
straight some cash for Bitcoin.

47:23.880 --> 47:28.240
Like there's the whole spectrum of options for ways people could go.

47:28.240 --> 47:33.360
But I personally think it would be incredible to do like either a Google Pay or an Apple

47:33.360 --> 47:35.920
Pay in the Fountain app to charge up the wallet.

47:35.920 --> 47:39.360
But I totally get, you know, maybe why you'd want to avoid that.

47:39.360 --> 47:43.840
The other thing, too, is I kind of consider a lightning wallet like a checking account.

47:43.840 --> 47:45.880
Like I don't keep very much in there.

47:45.880 --> 47:49.360
I keep like a spending amount of money in a lightning wallet.

47:49.360 --> 47:54.480
And Blue Wallet is a fantastic app because if later on you want to go to the self-hosting

47:54.480 --> 47:58.320
side of Bitcoin, maybe deploy like Umbral or something like that, it's real easy to

47:58.320 --> 48:02.240
connect that Blue Wallet app up to a self-hosted Umbral box, too.

48:02.240 --> 48:04.400
So I love it for that kind of stuff.

48:04.400 --> 48:05.400
All right.

48:05.400 --> 48:08.360
So we've talked about the clips and we've talked about the transcription that's in the

48:08.360 --> 48:11.360
clips and we've talked about boostagrams.

48:11.360 --> 48:15.160
Can we just kind of spend a minute on comments because these just recently rolled out in

48:15.160 --> 48:16.160
the app?

48:16.160 --> 48:19.880
And this is also kind of like an area of a lot of debate right now in podcasting 2.0

48:19.880 --> 48:23.640
is should we use lightning for comments or Activity Pub or whatever?

48:23.640 --> 48:27.720
And Fountain has pushed ahead and gone right to lightning comments.

48:27.720 --> 48:32.040
So now when someone sends a boost, unless they choose it to be private, that boost will

48:32.040 --> 48:35.520
actually show up in the podcast when you're listening.

48:35.520 --> 48:37.800
You can see other people's boost now.

48:37.800 --> 48:43.880
And I think this has the potential to kind of create like a new cross app comments platform.

48:43.880 --> 48:44.880
Yeah.

48:44.880 --> 48:54.640
So for me, I have a very strong belief that making boosts public, obviously with the user's

48:54.640 --> 49:01.880
consent, adds so much to the podcast listening experience for a few reasons.

49:01.880 --> 49:07.580
First off, I talked earlier about how we're enabling listeners to create clips so that

49:07.580 --> 49:14.160
you as a listener get a signal about which episodes are actually valuable to go and listen

49:14.160 --> 49:15.160
to.

49:15.160 --> 49:21.960
Well, viewing somebody else's boost is an even better signal potentially, because not

49:21.960 --> 49:28.480
only does it have a comment, probably thanking the host for the episode or, you know, asking

49:28.480 --> 49:34.640
a question or clarifying something, that's a signal about how good that episode was.

49:34.640 --> 49:40.880
But because there's a financial value attached to that comment, that's an incredibly even

49:40.880 --> 49:42.320
higher signal.

49:42.320 --> 49:49.200
So for example, if I follow you on Fountain, and I know that your average boost is around

49:49.200 --> 49:56.920
2000 sats, and then one day, I see you pull out a 50,000 sat boost on an episode, I'm

49:56.920 --> 50:01.600
going to think to myself, hold on a minute, and a really long comment saying, Oh, my God,

50:01.600 --> 50:02.600
thank you so much.

50:02.600 --> 50:03.600
This episode was incredible.

50:03.600 --> 50:04.600
I learned so much.

50:04.600 --> 50:08.320
I'm going to think to myself, okay, hold on a minute, this is an episode that I need to

50:08.320 --> 50:09.720
go and pay attention to.

50:09.720 --> 50:12.240
So maybe I'll click through to the episode screen.

50:12.240 --> 50:14.040
Maybe I'll read some of the other boosts.

50:14.040 --> 50:18.680
And that at the end of the day, is just going to drive discovery for the podcaster and a

50:18.680 --> 50:21.480
better listening experience for the listener.

50:21.480 --> 50:28.480
So that's why we believe that having boost public and allowing interaction through lightning

50:28.480 --> 50:31.280
is, yeah, that's why we think it's so good.

50:31.280 --> 50:37.000
I know there is some contention around, you know, which is the right protocol to use for

50:37.000 --> 50:38.440
cross app comments.

50:38.440 --> 50:43.960
And I would also say that we're open to, you know, trying out different things and combining

50:43.960 --> 50:44.960
protocols.

50:44.960 --> 50:50.200
I think the reason we went ahead and just, you know, put this out there was just to test

50:50.200 --> 50:51.200
it.

50:51.200 --> 50:54.160
We were testing it for a few weeks in beta and people were loving it.

50:54.160 --> 50:59.320
So yeah, I personally, I think it just makes the listener experience better and also drives

50:59.320 --> 51:03.260
discovery for the podcaster and helps them get paid more as well.

51:03.260 --> 51:07.440
Because if you go onto the episode screen and you see that the top boost is for 50,000

51:07.440 --> 51:12.120
sats, are you going to boost 500 or are you going to boost closer to 50,000?

51:12.120 --> 51:16.480
So at the end of the day, podcasters, if you publicize the top boost, you're going to get

51:16.480 --> 51:17.480
paid more.

51:17.480 --> 51:18.480
Yeah, I suppose so.

51:18.480 --> 51:19.480
I suppose so.

51:19.480 --> 51:21.320
All right, I've been I've switched over.

51:21.320 --> 51:23.220
It is now my primary app.

51:23.220 --> 51:28.020
And so now I got to do the thing where I asked for that one specific feature that I want.

51:28.020 --> 51:31.600
But I actually have heard from a couple of members in the audience to how far off or

51:31.600 --> 51:35.480
even likely is something like CarPlay support Android Auto for Fountain?

51:35.480 --> 51:39.420
Yeah, so CarPlay is actually our number one requested feature.

51:39.420 --> 51:41.320
And so it will be coming soon.

51:41.320 --> 51:44.240
We've actually done a little bit of work on it.

51:44.240 --> 51:51.840
But what we found was, what was it, yeah, I'll just say it's coming very soon.

51:51.840 --> 51:57.840
And yeah, I would also say if anyone's listening who, you know, has tried out Fountain and,

51:57.840 --> 52:01.820
you know, want something or want something changed, like we're really open to just we're

52:01.820 --> 52:03.920
going to build whatever people want, basically.

52:03.920 --> 52:05.180
So please do.

52:05.180 --> 52:08.800
We have a built in feedback tool in the app so you can use that.

52:08.800 --> 52:13.120
Or you can just send me an email oscaratfountain.fm and yeah, we've got a lot coming.

52:13.120 --> 52:17.160
But CarPlay is definitely on the roadmap and should be available soon.

52:17.160 --> 52:18.160
That's exciting.

52:18.160 --> 52:19.640
I was hoping that would be the answer.

52:19.640 --> 52:22.680
Well, Oscar, thank you so much for the hard work.

52:22.680 --> 52:23.680
Thank you.

52:23.680 --> 52:24.680
Anyone else who's involved?

52:24.680 --> 52:27.040
I'm not sure if it's a big team or not or a small team.

52:27.040 --> 52:29.000
But thank you regardless.

52:29.000 --> 52:31.880
It's been a long time since I've had a podcast app I'm this excited about.

52:31.880 --> 52:34.640
So keep up the great work and we'll be sending people to Fountain.

52:34.640 --> 52:43.600
It's great.

52:43.600 --> 52:44.600
All right.

52:44.600 --> 52:45.600
I see people getting in that matrix room.

52:45.600 --> 52:47.680
Look at everybody showing up.

52:47.680 --> 52:48.680
Excellent.

52:48.680 --> 52:49.680
Very good.

52:49.680 --> 52:50.680
All right.

52:50.680 --> 52:51.680
So get your app.

52:51.680 --> 52:54.500
I also I also have to say I really like Cast-O-Matic too.

52:54.500 --> 52:57.820
If you go to newpodcastapps.com and you filter on the boost, you'll see there's even some

52:57.820 --> 53:03.800
decent web apps, which I never really considered using to listen to podcasts.

53:03.800 --> 53:04.800
First.

53:04.800 --> 53:05.800
Oh, that's an idea.

53:05.800 --> 53:06.800
Yeah.

53:06.800 --> 53:07.800
But you know what?

53:07.800 --> 53:11.480
Like a part of it, I think I want my podcast app to have web playback because sometimes

53:11.480 --> 53:15.080
I want to finish it up at my desk, you know, that's a nice feature.

53:15.080 --> 53:16.080
Yeah, definitely.

53:16.080 --> 53:20.360
So maybe the web podcast apps do make some sense and people have been sending us boosts

53:20.360 --> 53:21.360
from the web app.

53:21.360 --> 53:22.360
So people are using them.

53:22.360 --> 53:27.080
So all the apps are listed at newpodcastapps.com but it was really nice of Oscar to take a

53:27.080 --> 53:31.600
minute to join me because it was just sort of a last minute random idea.

53:31.600 --> 53:36.520
And I did get a little scoop that CarPlay is in the works for Fountain FM.

53:36.520 --> 53:41.560
So that is coming soon to Fountain FM and I think Android Auto as well.

53:41.560 --> 53:43.560
That's the nice thing about Fountain is cross-platform.

53:43.560 --> 53:49.020
The nice thing about Cast-O-Matic, it's iOS only, but it also does things like iCloud

53:49.020 --> 53:55.840
sync and it'll import from several other podcast apps and it'll import an OPML feed too.

53:55.840 --> 53:56.840
Which Fountain does not do.

53:56.840 --> 53:57.840
Fountain does not do.

53:57.840 --> 53:58.840
Aww.

53:58.840 --> 53:59.840
I better make a request.

53:59.840 --> 54:00.840
Yeah.

54:00.840 --> 54:04.600
So Oscar is very open to ideas and like one of the things they just recently rolled out

54:04.600 --> 54:06.720
which you heard us talking about there at the end is the comments.

54:06.720 --> 54:12.760
So now the people who boost and use Fountain, you all can see your comments.

54:12.760 --> 54:16.680
If like you go look and look, there's like you know a half a dozen or a dozen boosted

54:16.680 --> 54:18.160
comments in there.

54:18.160 --> 54:21.800
So let's kick this thing off and if you'd like to join me because these are going to

54:21.800 --> 54:24.720
be up on the screen, they're going to be in the matrix chat.

54:24.720 --> 54:29.720
If you're feeling generous and you want to boost along with us, you know match my boost,

54:29.720 --> 54:30.960
go for it.

54:30.960 --> 54:33.260
So here's what I'm asking everybody to do.

54:33.260 --> 54:39.560
Go either into Fountain or into Cast-O-Matic or whatever your new podcast app is and generate

54:39.560 --> 54:43.800
me a lightning invoice and then Brent's going to keep track of them.

54:43.800 --> 54:49.360
Don't paste the graphic because I'm not using a phone here.

54:49.360 --> 54:52.040
I'm using what's called a personal computer.

54:52.040 --> 54:53.560
I'm using a desktop computer.

54:53.560 --> 54:54.560
With a mouse?

54:54.560 --> 54:55.560
Yeah.

54:55.560 --> 54:56.560
And a keyboard?

54:56.560 --> 54:59.040
And I want to highlight the lightning address and I can tell if it's a lightning address

54:59.040 --> 55:00.040
or not.

55:00.040 --> 55:02.760
I want to highlight the lightning address and I want to paste it into my thing and I

55:02.760 --> 55:04.640
want to send you some sats.

55:04.640 --> 55:08.720
So if you want to get my sats, I don't want the picture, I want the lightning address.

55:08.720 --> 55:12.280
What we're going to do is Brent's going to collect them all and we'll go through and

55:12.280 --> 55:14.320
we'll give them away until I'm out.

55:14.320 --> 55:19.200
I got a few hundred dollars worth of sats that I'm giving away and we'll just keep going.

55:19.200 --> 55:25.280
Generate a 2,000 or 1,000, either way, I'll pay it, depends, we'll see how far it goes.

55:25.280 --> 55:28.960
But I'm hoping other people might want to generate a few payments from home too.

55:28.960 --> 55:29.960
We'll see.

55:29.960 --> 55:30.960
I don't know.

55:30.960 --> 55:31.960
Maybe they won't.

55:31.960 --> 55:37.960
But remember, in some apps, you have to actually have the podcast up to get that boost button

55:37.960 --> 55:39.440
and get that payment information.

55:39.440 --> 55:43.720
So it's the best way to do it would be to subscribe to one of our podcasts because they

55:43.720 --> 55:47.880
all support lightning, except for the all shows feed, does not yet, but it will.

55:47.880 --> 55:50.400
And then you'll get the button.

55:50.400 --> 55:55.440
And you can then send us a lightning one, put it in the matrix in the JB General chat,

55:55.440 --> 56:00.160
give us the text version so that way Brent can collect it and we'll start sending them

56:00.160 --> 56:01.160
out.

56:01.160 --> 56:04.080
And while you're getting that figured out, we'll just sort of chat and hang out because

56:04.080 --> 56:05.080
we're not in a rush today.

56:05.080 --> 56:08.240
That's why we did a live stream and not a show.

56:08.240 --> 56:14.320
So you're also welcome to send us questions, join the mumble room, ask us things there.

56:14.320 --> 56:17.160
Looks like people who are having trouble though connecting were able to get in.

56:17.160 --> 56:20.960
That's kind of what the logic was with that interview, was to give everybody a moment

56:20.960 --> 56:24.680
to get it all set up.

56:24.680 --> 56:29.120
Give it a moment, give our server a moment, you know, we're just trying to take it slow

56:29.120 --> 56:30.120
today.

56:30.120 --> 56:31.120
Right.

56:31.120 --> 56:32.120
Right.

56:32.120 --> 56:33.120
Right.

56:33.120 --> 56:34.120
I'm reading the feedback coming in.

56:34.120 --> 56:38.320
We got a live boost as I'm reading this.

56:38.320 --> 56:42.240
The new podcasting apps are working on live streaming, audio live streaming in the podcast

56:42.240 --> 56:45.520
app, which is really cool.

56:45.520 --> 56:48.080
Not there yet, but it's getting there.

56:48.080 --> 56:49.080
How are you doing, Brent?

56:49.080 --> 56:52.160
Are you over there collecting lightning addresses like a madman?

56:52.160 --> 56:53.160
There's a lot of stuff coming in.

56:53.160 --> 56:58.240
I just want to put out there, if I somehow miss your address, please get in contact with

56:58.240 --> 56:59.240
me.

56:59.240 --> 57:04.440
Um, I don't know how that's going to work, but for some reason you don't see any.

57:04.440 --> 57:09.080
So I'm seeing them come in, but I know our server, you know, is missing some messages

57:09.080 --> 57:10.080
here and there.

57:10.080 --> 57:12.440
So I'm going to try my best to get everyone out, but if for some reason you feel like

57:12.440 --> 57:15.120
I might've missed you, just, uh, just DM me or something.

57:15.120 --> 57:16.120
Not now.

57:16.120 --> 57:17.120
Wait, wait a few hours.

57:17.120 --> 57:19.080
But you know what I'm going to do?

57:19.080 --> 57:23.860
I'm going to send, uh, I'm going to send some sats to Rubicamon right there, or however

57:23.860 --> 57:24.860
you say it.

57:24.860 --> 57:27.360
I have no idea how they actually say it, but there we go.

57:27.360 --> 57:30.280
We now have, I've just given away the sats so you think you get to choose how to say

57:30.280 --> 57:31.280
it.

57:31.280 --> 57:36.280
Oh, oh, oh, I like that.

57:36.280 --> 57:37.280
That's great, Wes.

57:37.280 --> 57:38.280
Man.

57:38.280 --> 57:39.280
I like it.

57:39.280 --> 57:40.280
I like the way you think.

57:40.280 --> 57:41.280
All right.

57:41.280 --> 57:42.280
So then this next one, I'm also going to butcher.

57:42.280 --> 57:44.700
I'm going to butcher this one because these are rough guys.

57:44.700 --> 57:45.700
These are rough.

57:45.700 --> 57:49.200
I'm going to send in 2000 sats to Alkarnie.

57:49.200 --> 57:50.200
That's right.

57:50.200 --> 57:51.200
I'm going to do it.

57:51.200 --> 57:52.200
I'm going to do it.

57:52.200 --> 57:53.200
There we go.

57:53.200 --> 57:54.200
I was thinking Alkarnie.

57:54.200 --> 57:55.200
Alkarnie.

57:55.200 --> 57:56.200
Yeah.

57:56.200 --> 57:57.200
Okay.

57:57.200 --> 57:58.200
Oh, now this is nice.

57:58.200 --> 57:59.200
Look at this.

57:59.200 --> 58:00.200
How about this one?

58:00.200 --> 58:01.200
Very simple.

58:01.200 --> 58:02.200
Very straightforward.

58:02.200 --> 58:03.200
I appreciate this.

58:03.200 --> 58:04.200
You know what I'm going to do?

58:04.200 --> 58:05.200
I'm going to send some sats to Jody.

58:05.200 --> 58:06.200
This is fun.

58:06.200 --> 58:07.200
I could do this all day.

58:07.200 --> 58:09.360
I'm going to send 2000 sats to Jody.

58:09.360 --> 58:10.920
There you go, Jody.

58:10.920 --> 58:12.640
You just got boosted.

58:12.640 --> 58:16.240
Now somebody in there is calling themselves Joe.

58:16.240 --> 58:18.960
Hopefully it's the actual Joe, but it could be somebody trying to get on my good side,

58:18.960 --> 58:20.640
just calling themselves Joe.

58:20.640 --> 58:22.720
But either way, you know what?

58:22.720 --> 58:24.480
I'm going to send them 2000 sats.

58:24.480 --> 58:25.480
That's what I'm going to do.

58:25.480 --> 58:26.480
Done.

58:26.480 --> 58:27.480
I'm done.

58:27.480 --> 58:28.480
Oh, boy.

58:28.480 --> 58:29.480
This is a lot of fun.

58:29.480 --> 58:31.400
Oh, okay.

58:31.400 --> 58:34.640
This next one makes me think about Prospector Chris.

58:34.640 --> 58:35.840
So I like this one too.

58:35.840 --> 58:37.560
It's also very pronounceable.

58:37.560 --> 58:42.320
The next person that I'm giving away some sats to is Yosemite Sam.

58:42.320 --> 58:50.440
Yosemite Sam, you're going to get 2000 sats.

58:50.440 --> 58:51.760
This is good.

58:51.760 --> 58:56.000
I need like a monkey in here clapping or something.

58:56.000 --> 58:57.000
I need some kind of...

58:57.000 --> 58:58.000
Here you go, everybody.

58:58.000 --> 58:59.000
That's a lot of monkeys.

58:59.000 --> 59:00.000
That's a lot of monkeys.

59:00.000 --> 59:05.880
We are the Oprah of crypto nonsense, Chris.

59:05.880 --> 59:09.360
You get a sat and you get a sat.

59:09.360 --> 59:14.040
They were under your seat the whole time.

59:14.040 --> 59:15.040
I like it.

59:15.040 --> 59:16.040
All right.

59:16.040 --> 59:17.040
You know what I'm going to do?

59:17.040 --> 59:18.040
Persistent.

59:18.040 --> 59:19.040
If that's how you say it.

59:19.040 --> 59:20.040
Probably not.

59:20.040 --> 59:21.040
You get 2000 sats.

59:21.040 --> 59:22.040
There you go.

59:22.040 --> 59:23.800
Brent, you're doing great.

59:23.800 --> 59:24.800
You're doing really good.

59:24.800 --> 59:25.640
You're keeping up pretty good.

59:25.640 --> 59:28.920
So we're just keeping an eye on the Matrix room.

59:28.920 --> 59:31.440
I can't top while keying in here.

59:31.440 --> 59:32.440
We're seeing a lot of action.

59:32.440 --> 59:33.440
I love it.

59:33.440 --> 59:34.440
Yeah.

59:34.440 --> 59:35.440
Oh, good.

59:35.440 --> 59:36.440
NorCalDad's here.

59:36.440 --> 59:39.160
NorCalDad, I'm tempted to come down to California.

59:39.160 --> 59:43.920
I wish I could do I wanted to be able to do a hell Linux fest and scale.

59:43.920 --> 59:48.600
I don't know about that problem with Ohio.

59:48.600 --> 59:53.360
I see in the chat Durban, you you've sent some looks like a part of an address, but

59:53.360 --> 59:54.360
not the whole thing.

59:54.360 --> 59:56.280
So if you want to send it again, we're looking for lightning addresses.

59:56.280 --> 59:57.280
I don't know.

59:57.280 --> 59:58.280
Maybe that's it says BC.

59:58.280 --> 01:00:01.240
So it might be a Bitcoin address.

01:00:01.240 --> 01:00:03.080
It's totally the cool thing.

01:00:03.080 --> 01:00:07.480
The cool thing about the lightning network is that it's actually being routed right to

01:00:07.480 --> 01:00:08.720
the studio direct.

01:00:08.720 --> 01:00:10.120
Yeah.

01:00:10.120 --> 01:00:15.000
And so let's send some to NorCalDad.

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:18.000
NorCalDad gets a thousand stats.

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:19.000
That's awesome.

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:20.000
Yeah.

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:21.000
So get your whole lot.

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:22.000
They're long.

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:25.500
And you know, they're a lightning address because it starts with LN.

01:00:25.500 --> 01:00:28.200
And that's how you know, LNB.

01:00:28.200 --> 01:00:32.280
And if it starts with anything other than that, it's not a lightning address.

01:00:32.280 --> 01:00:38.600
You know, while we were doing the interview, I saw somebody say, oh, I think it was Austin.

01:00:38.600 --> 01:00:43.520
Austin reminded us in the matrix room that matrix is the protocol.

01:00:43.520 --> 01:00:46.560
Matrix is like HTTP, right?

01:00:46.560 --> 01:00:47.960
Synapse is the server.

01:00:47.960 --> 01:00:49.620
That's the back end that we use.

01:00:49.620 --> 01:00:51.640
And element is the client.

01:00:51.640 --> 01:00:52.680
So it's like the web browser.

01:00:52.680 --> 01:00:54.360
That's your Firefox.

01:00:54.360 --> 01:00:58.680
And we just kind of casually say matrix server.

01:00:58.680 --> 01:01:01.400
It's you know, because I think that's just what everybody kind of refers to.

01:01:01.400 --> 01:01:02.960
You know, I don't know.

01:01:02.960 --> 01:01:03.960
Our bad, I guess.

01:01:03.960 --> 01:01:08.480
But so just to make that clear, there is like a there's like three layers there.

01:01:08.480 --> 01:01:12.120
The nice thing is, is that you can have different matrix back ends.

01:01:12.120 --> 01:01:16.400
So dendrite is another one that's being developed that solves some of the problems that synapse

01:01:16.400 --> 01:01:17.600
has.

01:01:17.600 --> 01:01:19.960
You can have different matrix front ends as well.

01:01:19.960 --> 01:01:23.720
And then you can have applications that plug into the matrix network.

01:01:23.720 --> 01:01:24.720
It's nice.

01:01:24.720 --> 01:01:25.720
All right.

01:01:25.720 --> 01:01:27.000
Let's do some let's do another set giveaway.

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:28.640
So I'm going to give GX some sets.

01:01:28.640 --> 01:01:29.640
What do you say?

01:01:29.640 --> 01:01:30.720
Let's give GX.

01:01:30.720 --> 01:01:32.720
Let's give GX 1000 sets.

01:01:32.720 --> 01:01:35.040
There you go, GX.

01:01:35.040 --> 01:01:39.720
Computer guy, computer guy, not to be confused with computer kid.

01:01:39.720 --> 01:01:40.720
It's a race.

01:01:40.720 --> 01:01:41.720
I might boost computer guy right now.

01:01:41.720 --> 01:01:42.720
Oh, are you boosting too?

01:01:42.720 --> 01:01:43.720
I'm sneaking in with the boosts.

01:01:43.720 --> 01:01:44.720
Wes is doing some generous boosts.

01:01:44.720 --> 01:01:45.720
Very nice.

01:01:45.720 --> 01:01:46.720
Nice.

01:01:46.720 --> 01:01:47.720
Look at you, Wes.

01:01:47.720 --> 01:01:48.720
Look at you.

01:01:48.720 --> 01:01:49.720
Some double boosting going on.

01:01:49.720 --> 01:01:50.720
All right.

01:01:50.720 --> 01:01:51.720
Computer guy gets 2000 sets.

01:01:51.720 --> 01:01:52.720
Uh oh.

01:01:52.720 --> 01:01:53.720
Hold on.

01:01:53.720 --> 01:01:54.720
Computer guy says it doesn't like.

01:01:54.720 --> 01:01:55.720
Oh, it says.

01:01:55.720 --> 01:01:56.720
Oh, we've already paid that one.

01:01:56.720 --> 01:01:57.720
Oh, maybe we can only pay one invoice at a time.

01:01:57.720 --> 01:01:58.720
Oh, that might be it.

01:01:58.720 --> 01:01:59.720
I guess so.

01:01:59.720 --> 01:02:00.720
Yeah, that might be it.

01:02:00.720 --> 01:02:01.720
That might be it.

01:02:01.720 --> 01:02:06.720
Now, KPVoc already got some, but did he generate a new one?

01:02:06.720 --> 01:02:09.720
If he generated a new one, Wes, you ought to try...

01:02:09.720 --> 01:02:10.720
Oh, that's just...

01:02:10.720 --> 01:02:11.720
That might just be dirty.

01:02:11.720 --> 01:02:12.720
No, let him.

01:02:12.720 --> 01:02:13.720
No.

01:02:13.720 --> 01:02:14.720
It's fair.

01:02:14.720 --> 01:02:15.720
It's fair, I think.

01:02:15.720 --> 01:02:16.720
We just have to be careful.

01:02:16.720 --> 01:02:17.720
We just got to watch it.

01:02:17.720 --> 01:02:18.720
I'm like...

01:02:18.720 --> 01:02:22.040
Now, because I have to say the names out loud, I'm memorizing them as I go.

01:02:22.040 --> 01:02:24.440
And you have them here in the doc, so we can just review them.

01:02:24.440 --> 01:02:25.440
That's right.

01:02:25.440 --> 01:02:27.180
We're keeping track of you.

01:02:27.180 --> 01:02:28.180
We're keeping track.

01:02:28.180 --> 01:02:29.180
All right.

01:02:29.180 --> 01:02:30.180
Linux tweaks.

01:02:30.180 --> 01:02:31.180
Okay.

01:02:31.180 --> 01:02:32.180
All right.

01:02:32.180 --> 01:02:33.180
Okay.

01:02:33.180 --> 01:02:34.180
Linux.

01:02:34.180 --> 01:02:36.440
Now, is that like tweaks in the sense of like you like to mess with Linux or is that tweaks

01:02:36.440 --> 01:02:40.320
in the sense of like you're tweaking out while you're messing with Linux?

01:02:40.320 --> 01:02:41.760
Either way, you're getting a thousand sats.

01:02:41.760 --> 01:02:42.760
That's right.

01:02:42.760 --> 01:02:43.760
I thought it was like...

01:02:43.760 --> 01:02:47.080
I first read Linux twerks, which is a little different.

01:02:47.080 --> 01:02:48.080
Yeah.

01:02:48.080 --> 01:02:49.080
Although probably also interesting.

01:02:49.080 --> 01:02:51.280
Ah, my new screen name.

01:02:51.280 --> 01:02:52.280
Excellent.

01:02:52.280 --> 01:02:55.060
There's probably a YouTuber out there doing that.

01:02:55.060 --> 01:02:57.800
You know, you can picture the stills already.

01:02:57.800 --> 01:02:59.520
The stills make themselves for that one.

01:02:59.520 --> 01:03:04.440
We got 20 people hanging out in the quiet listening right now, getting the low latency.

01:03:04.440 --> 01:03:05.440
Or 20 maybe total.

01:03:05.440 --> 01:03:06.440
Oh, geez.

01:03:06.440 --> 01:03:07.440
Maybe it's not actually...

01:03:07.440 --> 01:03:08.440
I'm starting to get blisters.

01:03:08.440 --> 01:03:09.440
Maybe 16.

01:03:09.440 --> 01:03:10.440
Is that what it is?

01:03:10.440 --> 01:03:11.440
Are you?

01:03:11.440 --> 01:03:12.440
Uh-oh.

01:03:12.440 --> 01:03:13.440
Oh, yeah.

01:03:13.440 --> 01:03:14.440
This is great.

01:03:14.440 --> 01:03:15.440
Keep it coming.

01:03:15.440 --> 01:03:16.440
I'll just put some, I don't know, therapeutic gloves on or something.

01:03:16.440 --> 01:03:17.440
Yeah.

01:03:17.440 --> 01:03:20.240
You know, we could have made like a whole millionaire thing out of this.

01:03:20.240 --> 01:03:25.840
We could have done the whole bit, playing up like game show music and seeing, you know...

01:03:25.840 --> 01:03:26.840
Yeah.

01:03:26.840 --> 01:03:31.000
It could be like a programmatic millionaire, you know, and then set up to just automatically

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:32.000
send payments immediately.

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:33.480
You don't have to wait to the end.

01:03:33.480 --> 01:03:35.880
It's like pays you sats as you go through the level.

01:03:35.880 --> 01:03:37.480
You know, there's some command line clients.

01:03:37.480 --> 01:03:38.840
You could probably make that work.

01:03:38.840 --> 01:03:40.840
You could probably just do it all with a nice bash script.

01:03:40.840 --> 01:03:41.840
You know what I'm saying?

01:03:41.840 --> 01:03:42.840
You could probably do that.

01:03:42.840 --> 01:03:43.840
Yeah.

01:03:43.840 --> 01:03:44.840
Yeah.

01:03:44.840 --> 01:03:45.840
All right.

01:03:45.840 --> 01:03:46.840
So I'm going to give Friar Tech.

01:03:46.840 --> 01:03:47.840
Friar Tech.

01:03:47.840 --> 01:03:48.840
Oh, Friar Tech.

01:03:48.840 --> 01:03:49.840
Oh, that's good.

01:03:49.840 --> 01:03:50.840
Friar, that's good.

01:03:50.840 --> 01:03:51.840
All right.

01:03:51.840 --> 01:03:52.840
You're getting a thousand sats.

01:03:52.840 --> 01:03:53.840
I like that.

01:03:53.840 --> 01:03:54.840
You got it.

01:03:54.840 --> 01:03:55.840
All right.

01:03:55.840 --> 01:03:56.840
Tim, you know what?

01:03:56.840 --> 01:04:01.600
A nice, easy to say, not going to mess that one up username.

01:04:01.600 --> 01:04:03.640
I can appreciate that.

01:04:03.640 --> 01:04:05.160
So boy, you know what I could do?

01:04:05.160 --> 01:04:06.640
I could send you some sats for that.

01:04:06.640 --> 01:04:07.640
Thanks, Tim.

01:04:07.640 --> 01:04:09.160
You're getting a thousand sats.

01:04:09.160 --> 01:04:11.360
Oh, looks like Wes already got to them.

01:04:11.360 --> 01:04:12.360
It's a race, Wes.

01:04:12.360 --> 01:04:13.360
No, it's good.

01:04:13.360 --> 01:04:14.360
You and I are in a race now.

01:04:14.360 --> 01:04:15.360
I like it.

01:04:15.360 --> 01:04:16.360
This is awesome.

01:04:16.360 --> 01:04:17.360
I mean, it makes the sats go further, right?

01:04:17.360 --> 01:04:18.360
So this is a good thing.

01:04:18.360 --> 01:04:19.360
True.

01:04:19.360 --> 01:04:20.360
All right.

01:04:20.360 --> 01:04:21.360
So I'm coming in now on...

01:04:21.360 --> 01:04:22.360
What do you think?

01:04:22.360 --> 01:04:23.360
Ian?

01:04:23.360 --> 01:04:24.360
Ian?

01:04:24.360 --> 01:04:25.360
Oh, you already got that one too.

01:04:25.360 --> 01:04:26.360
All right.

01:04:26.360 --> 01:04:27.360
All right.

01:04:27.360 --> 01:04:28.360
I'm going for Durban.

01:04:28.360 --> 01:04:29.360
See if I can beat Wes Payne to Durban.

01:04:29.360 --> 01:04:30.360
Okay.

01:04:30.360 --> 01:04:31.360
How are you doing this so fast?

01:04:31.360 --> 01:04:32.360
What are you doing?

01:04:32.360 --> 01:04:34.960
Oh, I think I was going from the bottom for a moment.

01:04:34.960 --> 01:04:35.960
Oh, okay.

01:04:35.960 --> 01:04:36.960
All right.

01:04:36.960 --> 01:04:37.960
Okay.

01:04:37.960 --> 01:04:38.960
Great.

01:04:38.960 --> 01:04:39.960
All right.

01:04:39.960 --> 01:04:40.960
Well, Durban, you're getting 2,000 sats.

01:04:40.960 --> 01:04:41.960
How about that?

01:04:41.960 --> 01:04:42.960
Pow.

01:04:42.960 --> 01:04:43.960
How about that?

01:04:43.960 --> 01:04:44.960
You like them sats?

01:04:44.960 --> 01:04:45.960
And pew.

01:04:45.960 --> 01:04:46.960
There you go.

01:04:46.960 --> 01:04:47.960
Uh-oh.

01:04:47.960 --> 01:04:48.960
Moving too fast.

01:04:48.960 --> 01:04:49.960
I'm seeing...

01:04:49.960 --> 01:04:50.960
Yep.

01:04:50.960 --> 01:04:51.960
Redisk.

01:04:51.960 --> 01:04:52.960
Redisk, I think it is.

01:04:52.960 --> 01:04:56.080
I don't think that's a legit address if you compare yours to everybody else.

01:04:56.080 --> 01:04:57.080
I don't know what's going on there.

01:04:57.080 --> 01:04:59.440
There's no BC before it or anything.

01:04:59.440 --> 01:05:00.560
So give it another shot.

01:05:00.560 --> 01:05:03.040
We're looking for a lightning address.

01:05:03.040 --> 01:05:04.040
You know what?

01:05:04.040 --> 01:05:05.040
Toad rocks boat.

01:05:05.040 --> 01:05:06.240
You're getting some sats.

01:05:06.240 --> 01:05:07.240
You're getting some sats.

01:05:07.240 --> 01:05:08.240
Pew.

01:05:08.240 --> 01:05:09.240
There you go.

01:05:09.240 --> 01:05:10.240
Eric, JB2.

01:05:10.240 --> 01:05:11.240
Keep rocking that boat.

01:05:11.240 --> 01:05:13.040
Now, what's with the JB2?

01:05:13.040 --> 01:05:15.500
What happened to your JB1?

01:05:15.500 --> 01:05:16.920
Why does it have a number at all?

01:05:16.920 --> 01:05:18.200
Did the first one have a number?

01:05:18.200 --> 01:05:21.720
No, that's just smart naming because you got to make break and changes sometimes.

01:05:21.720 --> 01:05:24.480
But if the first one didn't have a number, wouldn't this be one?

01:05:24.480 --> 01:05:26.160
Anyways, you're getting a thousand sats.

01:05:26.160 --> 01:05:27.160
Pew.

01:05:27.160 --> 01:05:28.160
However you want to do it, you're getting sats.

01:05:28.160 --> 01:05:29.840
It's implicit zero, Chris Zero.

01:05:29.840 --> 01:05:30.840
So what are you doing over there?

01:05:30.840 --> 01:05:31.920
Are you doing strike over there?

01:05:31.920 --> 01:05:32.920
Is that what you're doing?

01:05:32.920 --> 01:05:33.920
Yeah.

01:05:33.920 --> 01:05:37.020
Are you doing strike on the computer or are you doing strike on the mobile?

01:05:37.020 --> 01:05:38.560
Strike on the phone like a madman.

01:05:38.560 --> 01:05:39.560
Oh, yeah.

01:05:39.560 --> 01:05:41.880
You know, they do have a Chrome extension.

01:05:41.880 --> 01:05:42.880
Do they?

01:05:42.880 --> 01:05:43.880
Okay.

01:05:43.880 --> 01:05:44.880
Maybe I should try that.

01:05:44.880 --> 01:05:48.280
Uh, I'm a T-Link.

01:05:48.280 --> 01:05:49.280
Well Wes got you.

01:05:49.280 --> 01:05:50.280
So you're good.

01:05:50.280 --> 01:05:51.280
You got boosted.

01:05:51.280 --> 01:05:52.280
Okay.

01:05:52.280 --> 01:05:57.080
So by the way, if you're listening after the fact and Nev's in there again, if you're listening

01:05:57.080 --> 01:06:01.680
after the fact and you want to just get yourself some sats the easy way, strike is a great

01:06:01.680 --> 01:06:03.240
way to do it if you're in the US.

01:06:03.240 --> 01:06:06.600
And outside the US, I really like Blue Wallet.

01:06:06.600 --> 01:06:11.220
It can be a little weird because the thing is, say Blue Wallet, for example, they use

01:06:11.220 --> 01:06:13.660
moon pay and that sounds like a weird name.

01:06:13.660 --> 01:06:18.320
And because they're regulated, they're going to ask for your ID because that's the law

01:06:18.320 --> 01:06:20.520
for the US terrorism and money laundering laws.

01:06:20.520 --> 01:06:25.460
So there is that DPG boom, you're getting 2000 sats.

01:06:25.460 --> 01:06:26.460
That's right.

01:06:26.460 --> 01:06:27.460
Pow.

01:06:27.460 --> 01:06:28.460
How do you like that?

01:06:28.460 --> 01:06:29.460
I'm coming for you next.

01:06:29.460 --> 01:06:30.460
J Moon.

01:06:30.460 --> 01:06:32.580
Unless West gets there first coming in.

01:06:32.580 --> 01:06:34.300
It's as fast as the extension can load.

01:06:34.300 --> 01:06:35.420
You know, is it fast?

01:06:35.420 --> 01:06:36.420
Not that fast.

01:06:36.420 --> 01:06:37.420
But is it faster than West's phone?

01:06:37.420 --> 01:06:40.920
Yeah, so now I'm playing with the extension, so you got me distracted.

01:06:40.920 --> 01:06:41.920
Yeah.

01:06:41.920 --> 01:06:42.920
It syncs up your accounts.

01:06:42.920 --> 01:06:43.920
All right.

01:06:43.920 --> 01:06:44.920
J Moon.

01:06:44.920 --> 01:06:45.920
Guess what?

01:06:45.920 --> 01:06:46.920
You just got 2000 sats from Westpain over there.

01:06:46.920 --> 01:06:47.920
All right.

01:06:47.920 --> 01:06:48.920
Look at Westpain getting in fast.

01:06:48.920 --> 01:06:49.920
All right.

01:06:49.920 --> 01:06:50.920
You already got boosted.

01:06:50.920 --> 01:06:51.920
He's going again, isn't he?

01:06:51.920 --> 01:06:52.920
All right.

01:06:52.920 --> 01:06:53.920
I'm going to try it.

01:06:53.920 --> 01:06:54.920
I'm going to try it.

01:06:54.920 --> 01:06:55.920
I'm going to see if I can beat West to it.

01:06:55.920 --> 01:06:56.920
Now it's a matter of pride.

01:06:56.920 --> 01:06:57.920
All right.

01:06:57.920 --> 01:06:58.920
Let's see.

01:06:58.920 --> 01:06:59.920
Can I get there before...

01:06:59.920 --> 01:07:00.920
Oh, West already got it.

01:07:00.920 --> 01:07:01.920
Damn it, West.

01:07:01.920 --> 01:07:02.920
You're fast.

01:07:02.920 --> 01:07:03.920
All right.

01:07:03.920 --> 01:07:04.920
Fred Warren.

01:07:04.920 --> 01:07:07.400
I'm coming in for you next.

01:07:07.400 --> 01:07:08.400
Let's see here.

01:07:08.400 --> 01:07:09.400
I'm going to boost you.

01:07:09.400 --> 01:07:11.400
I shouldn't say it out loud.

01:07:11.400 --> 01:07:12.400
My wrists are cramping up.

01:07:12.400 --> 01:07:13.400
This is great.

01:07:13.400 --> 01:07:14.400
You're doing great, Brent.

01:07:14.400 --> 01:07:15.400
All right.

01:07:15.400 --> 01:07:18.520
Fred, you just got boosted 1000 sats.

01:07:18.520 --> 01:07:19.520
There you go.

01:07:19.520 --> 01:07:20.520
All right.

01:07:20.520 --> 01:07:22.800
Sage is asking, how do you create an invoice on Fountain?

01:07:22.800 --> 01:07:26.040
You go to the wallet section on the bottom, you go to the wallet section, and then you

01:07:26.040 --> 01:07:29.640
can somehow ask for an invoice.

01:07:29.640 --> 01:07:31.280
And I think it's like receive payment or something.

01:07:31.280 --> 01:07:32.280
Yeah.

01:07:32.280 --> 01:07:34.480
Well, when you go into the wallet, that's a great...

01:07:34.480 --> 01:07:35.480
You know what?

01:07:35.480 --> 01:07:36.480
We should probably walk through this real quick.

01:07:36.480 --> 01:07:39.640
When you go into the Fountain app, you go to the wallet section.

01:07:39.640 --> 01:07:44.520
And then if you do the hamburger menu next to the wallet entry up top, it'll bring up

01:07:44.520 --> 01:07:46.880
a little thing where you say, add funds.

01:07:46.880 --> 01:07:49.920
And then from there, you generate us an invoice.

01:07:49.920 --> 01:07:54.800
And it's like, you know, it suffers from the hamburger menu problem.

01:07:54.800 --> 01:08:01.460
But like I said with my chat with Oscar, it is stupid surprising how complex a podcast

01:08:01.460 --> 01:08:06.120
app becomes when you start thinking about every screen and every aspect.

01:08:06.120 --> 01:08:09.160
And especially the stuff they're trying to add with transcript and live streaming and

01:08:09.160 --> 01:08:12.180
boosts and comments and clips.

01:08:12.180 --> 01:08:16.240
But being able to edit the clips by text, how cool is that?

01:08:16.240 --> 01:08:17.240
That is...

01:08:17.240 --> 01:08:20.640
And I've now discovered two separate podcasts that I've listened to that I'd never even

01:08:20.640 --> 01:08:22.840
heard of before.

01:08:22.840 --> 01:08:25.120
So I like that.

01:08:25.120 --> 01:08:26.120
I like that.

01:08:26.120 --> 01:08:27.440
So is it slowing down, Brent?

01:08:27.440 --> 01:08:30.820
Because I still got more stats to give away.

01:08:30.820 --> 01:08:32.080
People just got to get in that their...

01:08:32.080 --> 01:08:33.080
Yeah, it is slowing down.

01:08:33.080 --> 01:08:34.240
I think people are figuring it out.

01:08:34.240 --> 01:08:39.600
I'm, you know, twisting my wrist to try to get the blood flowing again.

01:08:39.600 --> 01:08:41.080
So keep it coming.

01:08:41.080 --> 01:08:43.400
We didn't get you back up hands, did we?

01:08:43.400 --> 01:08:45.000
Oh, hey, guess what?

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:46.000
No.

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:47.000
We got a new boost.

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:48.000
Somebody just sent...

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:50.720
Somebody just boosted us from the reverse.

01:08:50.720 --> 01:08:51.720
You get some stats.

01:08:51.720 --> 01:08:54.440
Comes in from 412 Linux.

01:08:54.440 --> 01:08:56.880
Nine minutes ago from Turquoise Fox.

01:08:56.880 --> 01:08:59.080
I could ask for some stats, but I'll pew you instead.

01:08:59.080 --> 01:09:03.480
Let's get this party going, 2,000 stats from Turquoise Fox.

01:09:03.480 --> 01:09:04.680
That's great.

01:09:04.680 --> 01:09:05.840
Thank you.

01:09:05.840 --> 01:09:10.640
Then five hours ago, we got a bunch of boosts for Linux Action News this week.

01:09:10.640 --> 01:09:13.760
So that's nice to see.

01:09:13.760 --> 01:09:18.520
User 6485 said, thank you for your diligence on keeping us up to date with Linux adjacent

01:09:18.520 --> 01:09:19.520
news.

01:09:19.520 --> 01:09:22.960
I'm not able to boost from the all shows feed, so I switched over here so I could boost you.

01:09:22.960 --> 01:09:24.120
James from the East Coast.

01:09:24.120 --> 01:09:25.520
Yeah, we're going to get that working.

01:09:25.520 --> 01:09:26.520
We are.

01:09:26.520 --> 01:09:29.000
Oh, and just look, another boost just came in.

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:30.740
Not even related to the live stream.

01:09:30.740 --> 01:09:31.740
We just got from...

01:09:31.740 --> 01:09:32.740
Oh, no, Friar Tech.

01:09:32.740 --> 01:09:33.740
Friar Tech is listening.

01:09:33.740 --> 01:09:36.680
So Friar Tech just boosted us from self-hosted 66.

01:09:36.680 --> 01:09:39.120
Mmm, pie.

01:09:39.120 --> 01:09:40.120
That's awesome.

01:09:40.120 --> 01:09:41.840
So yeah, if you want to try boosting this, you can see if it works.

01:09:41.840 --> 01:09:44.000
Although the intention wasn't for you to necessarily send it back to us.

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:46.240
You can send it to any podcast.

01:09:46.240 --> 01:09:50.100
But while you're listening, you'll see in one of these apps, you'll see that the button's

01:09:50.100 --> 01:09:53.240
there to boost, and that means that podcast is supported.

01:09:53.240 --> 01:09:57.200
Now my thought is, oh, do we have a new one there?

01:09:57.200 --> 01:09:58.200
We do.

01:09:58.200 --> 01:09:59.200
Sage.

01:09:59.200 --> 01:10:02.480
Sage of Fredondo.

01:10:02.480 --> 01:10:05.720
What I just realized is I could possibly front run.

01:10:05.720 --> 01:10:07.200
That's what you're doing.

01:10:07.200 --> 01:10:08.200
You're front running me.

01:10:08.200 --> 01:10:09.200
You're front running me the matrix.

01:10:09.200 --> 01:10:10.200
Dirty, dirty dog.

01:10:10.200 --> 01:10:11.200
That's what you're doing.

01:10:11.200 --> 01:10:15.760
Oh, I'm waiting for the dog, and you're front running me.

01:10:15.760 --> 01:10:16.760
I see what you're doing.

01:10:16.760 --> 01:10:18.160
Why am I even doing the doc then?

01:10:18.160 --> 01:10:19.360
No, you're doing great.

01:10:19.360 --> 01:10:20.360
You're doing great.

01:10:20.360 --> 01:10:21.360
All right, all right.

01:10:21.360 --> 01:10:22.360
I'll keep doing mine.

01:10:22.360 --> 01:10:23.360
I don't know if it's just me either.

01:10:23.360 --> 01:10:24.360
I didn't do that one.

01:10:24.360 --> 01:10:25.360
Oh, okay.

01:10:25.360 --> 01:10:27.040
Sage, you just got 2,000 sats.

01:10:27.040 --> 01:10:28.040
There you go.

01:10:28.040 --> 01:10:29.040
There you go.

01:10:29.040 --> 01:10:31.360
I see Kelz is in there too.

01:10:31.360 --> 01:10:32.360
Coming in now.

01:10:32.360 --> 01:10:33.360
There we go.

01:10:33.360 --> 01:10:34.860
Sage just got some sats.

01:10:34.860 --> 01:10:35.860
Very nice.

01:10:35.860 --> 01:10:36.860
What was I...

01:10:36.860 --> 01:10:40.760
Oh, here's my thought with these new podcast apps.

01:10:40.760 --> 01:10:44.420
I don't know if I could say maybe there is feature complete as something like AntennaPod

01:10:44.420 --> 01:10:51.200
or Overcast or maybe even Pocket Cast for some, especially because Pocket Cast has such

01:10:51.200 --> 01:10:59.280
a nice web UI, but my thinking is that if these other podcast apps start seeing people

01:10:59.280 --> 01:11:03.760
leave before these features, they're going to be compelled to build these features in,

01:11:03.760 --> 01:11:06.600
and then our favorite apps will get them.

01:11:06.600 --> 01:11:07.600
We can ask for them.

01:11:07.600 --> 01:11:10.040
We can vote with our feet.

01:11:10.040 --> 01:11:11.680
It's a part of a process, I think.

01:11:11.680 --> 01:11:12.680
All right.

01:11:12.680 --> 01:11:13.680
Let's see.

01:11:13.680 --> 01:11:14.680
Let's do...

01:11:14.680 --> 01:11:15.680
Oh, Optimus Gray coming in.

01:11:15.680 --> 01:11:16.680
Optimus Gray coming in.

01:11:16.680 --> 01:11:17.680
Yeah, all right.

01:11:17.680 --> 01:11:18.680
I'll let you have that one.

01:11:18.680 --> 01:11:19.680
Yeah, you know.

01:11:19.680 --> 01:11:20.680
Optimus Gray, you should do another one.

01:11:20.680 --> 01:11:21.680
You guys go way back.

01:11:21.680 --> 01:11:22.680
Optimus should do two.

01:11:22.680 --> 01:11:23.680
Do two, Optimus.

01:11:23.680 --> 01:11:24.680
Yeah, true.

01:11:24.680 --> 01:11:25.680
Do two.

01:11:25.680 --> 01:11:26.680
All right.

01:11:26.680 --> 01:11:27.680
Optimus Gray, you're coming in right now.

01:11:27.680 --> 01:11:32.560
Get ready for some sats in your face because I am sending you 2,000 sats right now.

01:11:32.560 --> 01:11:33.840
And it's great.

01:11:33.840 --> 01:11:38.560
It happens they get the sats before they even hear me tell them on the stream they're getting

01:11:38.560 --> 01:11:39.560
the sats, right?

01:11:39.560 --> 01:11:40.560
The Lightning Network is...

01:11:40.560 --> 01:11:41.560
Yeah, it's pretty great.

01:11:41.560 --> 01:11:44.280
It's faster than the stream.

01:11:44.280 --> 01:11:45.280
That's great.

01:11:45.280 --> 01:11:46.280
And way faster than our matrix.

01:11:46.280 --> 01:11:49.400
Yeah, totally true.

01:11:49.400 --> 01:11:50.400
Totally true.

01:11:50.400 --> 01:11:51.400
All right.

01:11:51.400 --> 01:11:52.400
So, Brent, are you thumbs it up?

01:11:52.400 --> 01:11:53.600
Oh, I see.

01:11:53.600 --> 01:11:54.600
Good thinking, Brent.

01:11:54.600 --> 01:11:56.300
You're on top of this s.

01:11:56.300 --> 01:11:58.320
That was an audience suggestion.

01:11:58.320 --> 01:11:59.320
Thank you.

01:11:59.320 --> 01:12:00.320
All right.

01:12:00.320 --> 01:12:01.320
So...

01:12:01.320 --> 01:12:02.320
I forget who mentioned that, but that was a great idea.

01:12:02.320 --> 01:12:03.320
I did that one.

01:12:03.320 --> 01:12:04.320
I'm putting a little w there.

01:12:04.320 --> 01:12:05.320
Oh, I see.

01:12:05.320 --> 01:12:06.320
All right.

01:12:06.320 --> 01:12:07.320
So, K-pop round two, huh?

01:12:07.320 --> 01:12:08.320
All right.

01:12:08.320 --> 01:12:09.320
You know what?

01:12:09.320 --> 01:12:10.320
Let's do it.

01:12:10.320 --> 01:12:14.360
Round two for KP because, you know what?

01:12:14.360 --> 01:12:15.360
He took the time tonight.

01:12:15.360 --> 01:12:16.360
Here you go.

01:12:16.360 --> 01:12:17.360
Here's 1,000 sats.

01:12:17.360 --> 01:12:22.480
I'ma to link, I'ma to link number two.

01:12:22.480 --> 01:12:24.400
Second round for I'ma to link.

01:12:24.400 --> 01:12:26.280
Let's get this going here.

01:12:26.280 --> 01:12:27.880
Let's get some money in these people's pocket.

01:12:27.880 --> 01:12:29.880
Let's support some content creators.

01:12:29.880 --> 01:12:32.600
Keep an eye out because this Lightning wallet, you don't have to just use it for podcasts

01:12:32.600 --> 01:12:33.600
too.

01:12:33.600 --> 01:12:34.600
It's anything on the Lightning Network.

01:12:34.600 --> 01:12:37.920
Merchants, I'm not sending you $45 in sats though, my friend.

01:12:37.920 --> 01:12:38.920
Nice try.

01:12:38.920 --> 01:12:39.920
Nice try.

01:12:39.920 --> 01:12:40.920
But I'm checking these.

01:12:40.920 --> 01:12:41.920
I'm checking these.

01:12:41.920 --> 01:12:47.480
So, you know, the whole idea here is you almost got it, but I'm checking them.

01:12:47.480 --> 01:12:48.480
True.

01:12:48.480 --> 01:12:52.800
So, the thing is, is you can send these to anybody on the Lightning Network.

01:12:52.800 --> 01:12:55.800
So that's not just the podcasters.

01:12:55.800 --> 01:12:59.680
That's anybody like a developer.

01:12:59.680 --> 01:13:02.480
There's a new app that just launched in the App Store today.

01:13:02.480 --> 01:13:05.320
It's from the Bitcoin company, if you want to search for it.

01:13:05.320 --> 01:13:11.160
And it converts Lightning sats into gift cards for hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of

01:13:11.160 --> 01:13:12.640
different businesses and whatnot.

01:13:12.640 --> 01:13:13.640
That's cool.

01:13:13.640 --> 01:13:14.640
All right.

01:13:14.640 --> 01:13:17.120
So, I'm going to send a thousand sats right now to True Grits.

01:13:17.120 --> 01:13:19.520
A thousand sats coming to your face, True Grits.

01:13:19.520 --> 01:13:20.520
Here we go.

01:13:20.520 --> 01:13:21.520
Pew!

01:13:21.520 --> 01:13:22.520
There you go.

01:13:22.520 --> 01:13:23.840
GX round two.

01:13:23.840 --> 01:13:24.840
Is that US?

01:13:24.840 --> 01:13:25.840
Yeah.

01:13:25.840 --> 01:13:26.840
I'm on it.

01:13:26.840 --> 01:13:27.840
All right.

01:13:27.840 --> 01:13:28.840
GX, you're getting your round two of sats.

01:13:28.840 --> 01:13:29.840
Very nice.

01:13:29.840 --> 01:13:30.840
Very good.

01:13:30.840 --> 01:13:32.920
All right.

01:13:32.920 --> 01:13:34.180
Half a pint.

01:13:34.180 --> 01:13:35.440
You're going to get some sats.

01:13:35.440 --> 01:13:38.460
You want some sats half a pint, you're going to get some damn sats.

01:13:38.460 --> 01:13:39.460
He wants some sats.

01:13:39.460 --> 01:13:40.460
He's going to get some sats.

01:13:40.460 --> 01:13:41.460
That's what I'm going to do right now.

01:13:41.460 --> 01:13:43.000
I'm sending them over to you.

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:44.000
Here we go.

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:45.000
Two thousand sats.

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:46.000
Pew!

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:47.000
There you go, half pint.

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:48.000
Speculation.

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:49.360
I think your method is telling us the sats.

01:13:49.360 --> 01:13:51.240
I just get the USD amount.

01:13:51.240 --> 01:13:52.240
Oh, I'm doing the math.

01:13:52.240 --> 01:13:53.240
I'm doing the math.

01:13:53.240 --> 01:13:54.240
You're doing the math.

01:13:54.240 --> 01:13:55.240
You're doing the math.

01:13:55.240 --> 01:13:57.640
That's why it's taking you so long.

01:13:57.640 --> 01:14:04.160
I see here there's speculation that half pint is Joe Rez stacking some sats over there.

01:14:04.160 --> 01:14:05.160
Could be.

01:14:05.160 --> 01:14:06.160
I like it.

01:14:06.160 --> 01:14:07.160
I like it.

01:14:07.160 --> 01:14:09.720
He's secretly stacking sats while we do this over there.

01:14:09.720 --> 01:14:12.720
Hey, Tim is asking, he says he didn't get his 1k.

01:14:12.720 --> 01:14:14.720
How dare you accuse me of such nonsense?

01:14:14.720 --> 01:14:15.720
Uh oh.

01:14:15.720 --> 01:14:16.720
I think it's true.

01:14:16.720 --> 01:14:21.320
What were you saying, Brent?

01:14:21.320 --> 01:14:24.240
Tim says that he hasn't received your 1k that you mentioned.

01:14:24.240 --> 01:14:25.240
Uh oh.

01:14:25.240 --> 01:14:27.920
His invoice was for 2k, so he's wondering what's going on.

01:14:27.920 --> 01:14:28.920
Tim, Tim, let's see.

01:14:28.920 --> 01:14:29.920
You got to check on Tim.

01:14:29.920 --> 01:14:30.920
I will check on Tim.

01:14:30.920 --> 01:14:32.880
Tim, that was a while ago too.

01:14:32.880 --> 01:14:34.640
So yeah, you totes-ma-goats should have it.

01:14:34.640 --> 01:14:35.640
Yeah, maybe.

01:14:35.640 --> 01:14:36.640
Should we get...

01:14:36.640 --> 01:14:37.640
Is it still on the dock or do we need to repost?

01:14:37.640 --> 01:14:38.640
Yeah, I'm going to go.

01:14:38.640 --> 01:14:39.640
I can check.

01:14:39.640 --> 01:14:41.560
So the cool thing about the invoice is I can always just double check that.

01:14:41.560 --> 01:14:44.560
And of course, he could always just send us another one too, but let's double see.

01:14:44.560 --> 01:14:45.560
You're right.

01:14:45.560 --> 01:14:47.440
Oh no, it says it has been paid.

01:14:47.440 --> 01:14:48.440
Uh oh, Tim.

01:14:48.440 --> 01:14:49.720
What app are you using?

01:14:49.720 --> 01:14:50.720
Fountain?

01:14:50.720 --> 01:14:52.100
Give us another invoice, Tim.

01:14:52.100 --> 01:14:53.160
Let's give it a go.

01:14:53.160 --> 01:14:54.160
Let's see it.

01:14:54.160 --> 01:14:56.320
Let's see if we can't give it a go over there.

01:14:56.320 --> 01:14:58.920
In the meantime, I think I'm going to go get Skin86.

01:14:58.920 --> 01:15:01.560
I think I'm getting there before you, Wes, but I'm not sure.

01:15:01.560 --> 01:15:02.560
Yeah.

01:15:02.560 --> 01:15:03.560
Now that you're not...

01:15:03.560 --> 01:15:05.240
You see, you're not front running me as much now.

01:15:05.240 --> 01:15:06.240
I'm beating you now.

01:15:06.240 --> 01:15:07.240
I see.

01:15:07.240 --> 01:15:08.240
I see how it is.

01:15:08.240 --> 01:15:09.240
I see.

01:15:09.240 --> 01:15:10.240
Oh shit, Skin.

01:15:10.240 --> 01:15:11.240
Shit.

01:15:11.240 --> 01:15:15.560
I'm not going to say how much that is, but there you go.

01:15:15.560 --> 01:15:16.560
I'm not doing that for any...

01:15:16.560 --> 01:15:17.560
I'm just...

01:15:17.560 --> 01:15:18.560
Wow.

01:15:18.560 --> 01:15:19.560
Wow.

01:15:19.560 --> 01:15:20.560
All right.

01:15:20.560 --> 01:15:21.560
Mac, you want round two?

01:15:21.560 --> 01:15:22.560
We'll give you round two.

01:15:22.560 --> 01:15:23.560
Give us...

01:15:23.560 --> 01:15:24.560
Now for these round twos, you know...

01:15:24.560 --> 01:15:25.560
I'm getting Mac.

01:15:25.560 --> 01:15:26.560
Okay.

01:15:26.560 --> 01:15:27.560
Mac, you got...

01:15:27.560 --> 01:15:28.560
Oh, this is fun.

01:15:28.560 --> 01:15:29.560
This is like...

01:15:29.560 --> 01:15:30.560
Okay.

01:15:30.560 --> 01:15:31.560
Rube.

01:15:31.560 --> 01:15:33.960
I'm going to do round two for Rube, but that's cool.

01:15:33.960 --> 01:15:34.960
Let's do it.

01:15:34.960 --> 01:15:37.480
I'm going to do round two for Rube here.

01:15:37.480 --> 01:15:39.480
I effing love the Lightning Network.

01:15:39.480 --> 01:15:40.480
I love this.

01:15:40.480 --> 01:15:42.240
I love that I can tell if you guys already paid.

01:15:42.240 --> 01:15:43.840
I love how fast it is.

01:15:43.840 --> 01:15:44.840
Pew.

01:15:44.840 --> 01:15:45.840
Bow.

01:15:45.840 --> 01:15:46.840
There you go, Rube.

01:15:46.840 --> 01:15:47.840
There you go.

01:15:47.840 --> 01:15:48.840
Enjoy that.

01:15:48.840 --> 01:15:49.840
Oh.

01:15:49.840 --> 01:15:50.840
Okay.

01:15:50.840 --> 01:15:54.360
So John Tux or Jonathan Tux, it was at...

01:15:54.360 --> 01:15:55.360
Joan Tux?

01:15:55.360 --> 01:15:56.360
How would you say that?

01:15:56.360 --> 01:15:59.560
Why is that screwing with me so much?

01:15:59.560 --> 01:16:00.560
I'd say Johan Tux.

01:16:00.560 --> 01:16:01.560
Ah, that might be what he means.

01:16:01.560 --> 01:16:02.560
That's just crazy.

01:16:02.560 --> 01:16:03.560
No?

01:16:03.560 --> 01:16:04.560
I like Johan.

01:16:04.560 --> 01:16:05.560
That's what we're going with.

01:16:05.560 --> 01:16:06.560
Remember?

01:16:06.560 --> 01:16:07.560
Johan.

01:16:07.560 --> 01:16:08.560
Two thousand sats for your face, my friend.

01:16:08.560 --> 01:16:09.560
Pew.

01:16:09.560 --> 01:16:10.560
What if you don't want them in your face?

01:16:10.560 --> 01:16:11.560
Nev.

01:16:11.560 --> 01:16:12.560
How many times is Nev going to invite us?

01:16:12.560 --> 01:16:13.840
No, Nev says he hasn't actually gotten them.

01:16:13.840 --> 01:16:16.720
He says he still hasn't gotten any sats, and he included that address.

01:16:16.720 --> 01:16:19.000
So maybe it's a previous address.

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:20.000
I'll try.

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:21.000
Yeah.

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:22.000
Give it a...

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:23.000
That's your territory.

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:24.000
Give it all Booster Roo there, Wes.

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:25.000
Let's see.

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:26.000
Pew.

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:29.000
Oh, we just got 50 sats from KVoc.

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:31.040
First boost from my favorite podcast.

01:16:31.040 --> 01:16:32.040
May it never go away again.

01:16:32.040 --> 01:16:33.040
Koda Radio.

01:16:33.040 --> 01:16:34.040
There you go.

01:16:34.040 --> 01:16:35.040
Thank you, sir.

01:16:35.040 --> 01:16:36.040
Thank you.

01:16:36.040 --> 01:16:37.040
It's nice.

01:16:37.040 --> 01:16:38.040
It's nice.

01:16:38.040 --> 01:16:39.040
Well, okay.

01:16:39.040 --> 01:16:40.040
Wow.

01:16:40.040 --> 01:16:42.480
Look at that.

01:16:42.480 --> 01:16:47.940
So now here's the thing is hang out in our matrix, chat with us, you know.

01:16:47.940 --> 01:16:50.880
Don't be a stranger because you're going to have this now.

01:16:50.880 --> 01:16:51.880
All right.

01:16:51.880 --> 01:16:52.880
Fryer Tech, you ready for round two?

01:16:52.880 --> 01:16:53.880
You ready?

01:16:53.880 --> 01:16:54.880
What do you say?

01:16:54.880 --> 01:16:59.200
I feel like I still, again, this is such an opportunity for like a millionaire theme,

01:16:59.200 --> 01:17:03.720
but you know, it'd be a lot because we're sending a lot of sats out.

01:17:03.720 --> 01:17:04.720
I'm already peeing a lot.

01:17:04.720 --> 01:17:05.720
All right.

01:17:05.720 --> 01:17:06.720
2,000 sats for round two.

01:17:06.720 --> 01:17:09.240
That's a total of 4,000 sats for Fryer Tech.

01:17:09.240 --> 01:17:10.240
Pew.

01:17:10.240 --> 01:17:12.240
And then we already determined the term was Satotionaire.

01:17:12.240 --> 01:17:13.240
Yeah, you're right.

01:17:13.240 --> 01:17:14.240
You're right.

01:17:14.240 --> 01:17:15.240
It is Satotionaire.

01:17:15.240 --> 01:17:18.760
I'm going to link again with this.

01:17:18.760 --> 01:17:19.760
Come on.

01:17:19.760 --> 01:17:20.760
I got that.

01:17:20.760 --> 01:17:21.760
Boom.

01:17:21.760 --> 01:17:22.760
Booster.

01:17:22.760 --> 01:17:23.760
Okay.

01:17:23.760 --> 01:17:24.760
All right.

01:17:24.760 --> 01:17:25.760
That's what this is going for.

01:17:25.760 --> 01:17:27.280
Very nice, Wes.

01:17:27.280 --> 01:17:29.640
It's for people who like to mess with computers.

01:17:29.640 --> 01:17:30.640
That's us.

01:17:30.640 --> 01:17:31.640
All right.

01:17:31.640 --> 01:17:32.640
Dro's going for...

01:17:32.640 --> 01:17:33.640
What do you think?

01:17:33.640 --> 01:17:34.640
Oh, no.

01:17:34.640 --> 01:17:35.640
Dr. Zo.

01:17:35.640 --> 01:17:36.640
That's Dr. Zo for sure.

01:17:36.640 --> 01:17:37.640
I'm sorry.

01:17:37.640 --> 01:17:38.640
I just spot read.

01:17:38.640 --> 01:17:39.640
Could be Zoey, but who's counting?

01:17:39.640 --> 01:17:40.640
Could be.

01:17:40.640 --> 01:17:41.640
Could be Dr. Zoey too.

01:17:41.640 --> 01:17:44.920
I'm a spot reader, so I just suck at this kind of stuff, but you're getting 2,000 sats.

01:17:44.920 --> 01:17:46.400
So that probably makes it better, right?

01:17:46.400 --> 01:17:47.400
There you go.

01:17:47.400 --> 01:17:49.440
2,000 sats for you.

01:17:49.440 --> 01:17:55.080
Well, I thought maybe Linus Torvalds would stop by tonight.

01:17:55.080 --> 01:17:56.560
I mean, I don't know.

01:17:56.560 --> 01:17:57.560
I just thought maybe.

01:17:57.560 --> 01:17:58.560
It seems like a long time.

01:17:58.560 --> 01:18:01.080
You send him an invite for every one of the streams.

01:18:01.080 --> 01:18:02.080
Yep.

01:18:02.080 --> 01:18:05.400
Yosemite Sam, because I liked your nick so much, you know what I'm going to do?

01:18:05.400 --> 01:18:06.960
I'm going to send you some more sats.

01:18:06.960 --> 01:18:10.040
How do you like that?

01:18:10.040 --> 01:18:11.480
I just like that damn username.

01:18:11.480 --> 01:18:12.480
I think it's easy.

01:18:12.480 --> 01:18:14.920
So it was the first easy username of the night.

01:18:14.920 --> 01:18:15.920
So you're getting 2,000 more sats.

01:18:15.920 --> 01:18:16.920
Here you go.

01:18:16.920 --> 01:18:17.920
So desperate for an easy username.

01:18:17.920 --> 01:18:24.560
I'm going to incentivize easy usernames.

01:18:24.560 --> 01:18:26.640
What if the username includes its own phonetic pronunciation?

01:18:26.640 --> 01:18:28.960
Can it be more difficult then?

01:18:28.960 --> 01:18:31.720
So BeerDetect did that with his GitHub.

01:18:31.720 --> 01:18:37.600
If you go to his fever site, he does the phonetic pronunciation in the GitHub.

01:18:37.600 --> 01:18:39.760
Thinking about the podcasters are going to have to try to say it.

01:18:39.760 --> 01:18:40.760
It was great.

01:18:40.760 --> 01:18:41.760
I appreciate that.

01:18:41.760 --> 01:18:45.400
It was like one of the first times I've ever opened it up, and I was like, oh, God bless

01:18:45.400 --> 01:18:46.400
you.

01:18:46.400 --> 01:18:47.520
Thank you so much for that.

01:18:47.520 --> 01:18:48.520
Yeah.

01:18:48.520 --> 01:18:49.520
All right.

01:18:49.520 --> 01:18:52.960
I think we're winding down, so these last few minutes, and then I think we're going

01:18:52.960 --> 01:18:54.440
to wrap it up here.

01:18:54.440 --> 01:18:55.440
Uh-oh.

01:18:55.440 --> 01:18:57.000
We want more.

01:18:57.000 --> 01:19:01.160
Toad Rocks the Boat for number two for Toad Rocks the Boat.

01:19:01.160 --> 01:19:04.440
Going to bring it in for some sats for Mr. Rocks the Boat over there.

01:19:04.440 --> 01:19:05.440
A missus.

01:19:05.440 --> 01:19:06.440
Could be a missus, actually.

01:19:06.440 --> 01:19:08.080
They are going to get 1,000 sats.

01:19:08.080 --> 01:19:10.080
Here you go, Toad.

01:19:10.080 --> 01:19:11.080
Enjoy.

01:19:11.080 --> 01:19:12.080
Enjoy.

01:19:12.080 --> 01:19:15.360
I see persistence coming back to the well again.

01:19:15.360 --> 01:19:16.360
Very good.

01:19:16.360 --> 01:19:17.360
Very good.

01:19:17.360 --> 01:19:18.360
Very nice.

01:19:18.360 --> 01:19:19.360
Bring it in.

01:19:19.360 --> 01:19:20.360
Bring it in.

01:19:20.360 --> 01:19:21.360
We'll let Brent catch up.

01:19:21.360 --> 01:19:22.360
Sorry.

01:19:22.360 --> 01:19:23.360
I was trying to...

01:19:23.360 --> 01:19:24.360
Someone mentioned IRC.

01:19:24.360 --> 01:19:25.360
I switched over there to look.

01:19:25.360 --> 01:19:26.360
Didn't see an address.

01:19:26.360 --> 01:19:27.360
You're doing great.

01:19:27.360 --> 01:19:28.360
No.

01:19:28.360 --> 01:19:30.080
People have been really awesome about being able to get in the matrix.

01:19:30.080 --> 01:19:31.560
It's not the easiest thing.

01:19:31.560 --> 01:19:32.880
We have the best audience.

01:19:32.880 --> 01:19:34.440
They are so great about that kind of stuff.

01:19:34.440 --> 01:19:39.520
You know, part of it, too, it's like I think you guys get that if we don't use this stuff,

01:19:39.520 --> 01:19:42.880
who is going to use this stuff, right?

01:19:42.880 --> 01:19:45.720
If we can't make it work, nobody can, right?

01:19:45.720 --> 01:19:47.800
Because we are the early adopters.

01:19:47.800 --> 01:19:50.840
We are the people that love open source software and all that kind of stuff.

01:19:50.840 --> 01:19:51.840
All right.

01:19:51.840 --> 01:19:52.840
Persistent.

01:19:52.840 --> 01:19:53.840
I'm going to send you some more sats.

01:19:53.840 --> 01:19:54.840
What do you say?

01:19:54.840 --> 01:19:55.840
Because you've been so persistent.

01:19:55.840 --> 01:19:58.280
I'm sorry.

01:19:58.280 --> 01:20:00.800
So you're getting 2,000 sats for putting up with my bad joke.

01:20:00.800 --> 01:20:01.800
Oh, Wes already got it.

01:20:01.800 --> 01:20:02.800
Oh, did I?

01:20:02.800 --> 01:20:03.800
Oh, maybe not.

01:20:03.800 --> 01:20:04.800
It says it's already paid.

01:20:04.800 --> 01:20:05.800
Okay.

01:20:05.800 --> 01:20:09.440
Well, I can't argue with the lightning network.

01:20:09.440 --> 01:20:10.440
Somebody paid it.

01:20:10.440 --> 01:20:11.440
I mean, I'll try again.

01:20:11.440 --> 01:20:12.440
But it did say...

01:20:12.440 --> 01:20:15.400
Here, maybe if I hit this button that says send all of my sats.

01:20:15.400 --> 01:20:16.400
Maybe then it'll go.

01:20:16.400 --> 01:20:17.400
Yeah.

01:20:17.400 --> 01:20:18.400
Nope.

01:20:18.400 --> 01:20:19.400
It says it got paid.

01:20:19.400 --> 01:20:20.400
Maybe they need to generate another invoice.

01:20:20.400 --> 01:20:21.400
Hmm.

01:20:21.400 --> 01:20:22.400
Another invoice.

01:20:22.400 --> 01:20:23.400
Hey, Nev finally got some.

01:20:23.400 --> 01:20:24.400
Good.

01:20:24.400 --> 01:20:25.400
I was worried about that.

01:20:25.400 --> 01:20:26.400
Good.

01:20:26.400 --> 01:20:27.920
Bearded Tech taking the extra time tonight to stop by.

01:20:27.920 --> 01:20:32.640
So Bearded Tech is going to get some sats coming your way in your face, Beard.

01:20:32.640 --> 01:20:33.640
Standby.

01:20:33.640 --> 01:20:35.520
And great work on fever, by the way.

01:20:35.520 --> 01:20:36.520
Here's 1,000 sats.

01:20:36.520 --> 01:20:37.520
There you go.

01:20:37.520 --> 01:20:38.520
Well, thank you, Chris.

01:20:38.520 --> 01:20:39.520
I appreciate it.

01:20:39.520 --> 01:20:44.920
Was that your phone buzzing getting the sats right there?

01:20:44.920 --> 01:20:45.920
That's great.

01:20:45.920 --> 01:20:46.920
VBO.

01:20:46.920 --> 01:20:47.920
How about some sats?

01:20:47.920 --> 01:20:48.920
Good.

01:20:48.920 --> 01:20:49.920
I'm glad you got in here.

01:20:49.920 --> 01:20:50.920
Vabotnik.

01:20:50.920 --> 01:20:51.920
Oh.

01:20:51.920 --> 01:20:53.960
Wes, you ought to take a shot at more of these.

01:20:53.960 --> 01:20:54.960
That was good.

01:20:54.960 --> 01:20:55.960
All right.

01:20:55.960 --> 01:20:56.960
There you go.

01:20:56.960 --> 01:20:59.280
1,000 sats for your face.

01:20:59.280 --> 01:21:05.520
Sage is asking, who do we recommend that is a good other podcast that's participating

01:21:05.520 --> 01:21:08.000
in the lightning network that they can send sats to?

01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:12.040
So I mean, you know, each one of these apps actually will let you...

01:21:12.040 --> 01:21:16.600
So this is another advantage to podcasts getting on board with this is the podcast apps that

01:21:16.600 --> 01:21:22.060
support the boosts and the value for value in their discover areas are featuring the

01:21:22.060 --> 01:21:24.000
value for value podcast sections.

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:28.640
So a lot of them have like podcasts that are on lightning or podcasts that support value

01:21:28.640 --> 01:21:30.480
value, and it's a much shorter list.

01:21:30.480 --> 01:21:31.600
So a lot of them just have it all built in.

01:21:31.600 --> 01:21:34.600
I would check that out.

01:21:34.600 --> 01:21:39.820
And of course, you can go to the podcast index, too, and you can search over there as well,

01:21:39.820 --> 01:21:40.820
as well.

01:21:40.820 --> 01:21:41.820
Oh, guess what, guys?

01:21:41.820 --> 01:21:43.400
I just got a boost.

01:21:43.400 --> 01:21:50.480
This one came in from user 4007 using Fountain, next OS on my desktop, my laptop, and I'm

01:21:50.480 --> 01:21:52.560
now working on deploying it on my server.

01:21:52.560 --> 01:21:53.560
Nicely done.

01:21:53.560 --> 01:21:54.560
What?

01:21:54.560 --> 01:21:55.560
The laptop, huh?

01:21:55.560 --> 01:21:56.560
All right.

01:21:56.560 --> 01:21:57.560
I'm getting prescient again.

01:21:57.560 --> 01:21:58.560
All right.

01:21:58.560 --> 01:21:59.560
You're gonna get persistent.

01:21:59.560 --> 01:22:00.560
Very good.

01:22:00.560 --> 01:22:01.560
Yep.

01:22:01.560 --> 01:22:02.560
Very good.

01:22:02.560 --> 01:22:03.560
Thank you.

01:22:03.560 --> 01:22:04.560
Dude, I got it.

01:22:04.560 --> 01:22:05.560
Xamarin, Xamarin.

01:22:05.560 --> 01:22:06.560
Who knows, right?

01:22:06.560 --> 01:22:07.560
You can't.

01:22:07.560 --> 01:22:08.560
Who knows?

01:22:08.560 --> 01:22:09.560
You can't tell these things.

01:22:09.560 --> 01:22:11.840
Is it the open source Nvidia driver?

01:22:11.840 --> 01:22:12.840
The Navu driver?

01:22:12.840 --> 01:22:13.840
The Navu driver?

01:22:13.840 --> 01:22:14.840
The...

01:22:14.840 --> 01:22:15.840
Perfect.

01:22:15.840 --> 01:22:21.040
Barely works, I think is how I say it.

01:22:21.040 --> 01:22:22.840
I think that's how I say it.

01:22:22.840 --> 01:22:23.840
Novo.

01:22:23.840 --> 01:22:24.840
Yeah, thank you.

01:22:24.840 --> 01:22:25.840
Thank you.

01:22:25.840 --> 01:22:26.840
You know, that's what we need, Joe.

01:22:26.840 --> 01:22:29.840
We need a record recording of that just on the sound.

01:22:29.840 --> 01:22:33.640
No, we just need Joe on mumble for these things, really.

01:22:33.640 --> 01:22:34.640
Let's be honest.

01:22:34.640 --> 01:22:35.640
You can just pronounce them.

01:22:35.640 --> 01:22:36.640
All right.

01:22:36.640 --> 01:22:37.640
So Linux tweaks is gonna top off.

01:22:37.640 --> 01:22:38.640
And I think that's a good idea.

01:22:38.640 --> 01:22:40.560
Who doesn't want to top off?

01:22:40.560 --> 01:22:41.840
Let's top Linux tweaks off.

01:22:41.840 --> 01:22:43.400
There you go.

01:22:43.400 --> 01:22:44.400
Here we go.

01:22:44.400 --> 01:22:45.400
Here we go.

01:22:45.400 --> 01:22:47.360
Gonna send you some sats, Linux tweets.

01:22:47.360 --> 01:22:49.120
Thank you for joining us today.

01:22:49.120 --> 01:22:50.800
There you go.

01:22:50.800 --> 01:22:52.240
You're gonna get some damn sats.

01:22:52.240 --> 01:22:53.640
There you go.

01:22:53.640 --> 01:22:54.640
Just topped them off.

01:22:54.640 --> 01:22:57.400
Rounded them up to 2,000 bucks right there, 2,000 sats.

01:22:57.400 --> 01:22:59.520
Maybe 2,000 bucks one day.

01:22:59.520 --> 01:23:01.280
Hey, you do have at least one kernel to that.

01:23:01.280 --> 01:23:02.280
Well, that's awesome.

01:23:02.280 --> 01:23:03.280
Thank you for being here.

01:23:03.280 --> 01:23:04.280
Hello.

01:23:04.280 --> 01:23:10.720
You know, it might sound insane, but I think I would really want my app that I'm using

01:23:10.720 --> 01:23:12.560
to make the pew noise every time.

01:23:12.560 --> 01:23:14.680
It like feels a little empty without it.

01:23:14.680 --> 01:23:17.040
A couple of them do confetti and stuff like that.

01:23:17.040 --> 01:23:21.200
A couple of them do kind of like, you know, really do turn it up.

01:23:21.200 --> 01:23:22.960
Oh, we just got another boost.

01:23:22.960 --> 01:23:28.400
Another boost came back into us, 500 sats from Rubikuman.

01:23:28.400 --> 01:23:29.400
Love the show, guys.

01:23:29.400 --> 01:23:30.400
Keep it up.

01:23:30.400 --> 01:23:31.400
Sent from Linux Unplugged 451.

01:23:31.400 --> 01:23:32.400
Well, thank you.

01:23:32.400 --> 01:23:34.920
How are you doing over there, Brent?

01:23:34.920 --> 01:23:35.920
You holding up?

01:23:35.920 --> 01:23:38.720
Hey, that was our first sat receiver of the day too.

01:23:38.720 --> 01:23:39.720
Nice.

01:23:39.720 --> 01:23:40.720
I'm in the flow.

01:23:40.720 --> 01:23:41.720
Don't bother me while I'm in the flow.

01:23:41.720 --> 01:23:42.720
Sorry.

01:23:42.720 --> 01:23:43.720
Sorry.

01:23:43.720 --> 01:23:44.720
Sorry.

01:23:44.720 --> 01:23:45.720
Sorry.

01:23:45.720 --> 01:23:46.720
You're right.

01:23:46.720 --> 01:23:47.720
You're right.

01:23:47.720 --> 01:23:48.720
No, you're right.

01:23:48.720 --> 01:23:49.720
You're right.

01:23:49.720 --> 01:23:50.720
All right.

01:23:50.720 --> 01:23:51.720
All right.

01:23:51.720 --> 01:23:52.720
I think you know what we should do.

01:23:52.720 --> 01:23:53.720
I think it's time for the last round.

01:23:53.720 --> 01:23:59.480
So I'm going to get DPG for the second time because nice, simple username again.

01:23:59.480 --> 01:24:02.680
I think that always deserves some sats.

01:24:02.680 --> 01:24:03.680
You going to get Skinner?

01:24:03.680 --> 01:24:04.680
All right.

01:24:04.680 --> 01:24:05.680
Skinner.

01:24:05.680 --> 01:24:06.680
All right.

01:24:06.680 --> 01:24:11.680
We're going to send out 1,000 sats to DPG.

01:24:11.680 --> 01:24:14.280
Skinner, you're getting some sats from Wes.

01:24:14.280 --> 01:24:15.280
There you go.

01:24:15.280 --> 01:24:17.280
Sats coming your way.

01:24:17.280 --> 01:24:21.720
Hey, Preshant says he's going to set up a Numbril server he's excited to work with soon.

01:24:21.720 --> 01:24:22.720
Oh, that's great.

01:24:22.720 --> 01:24:23.720
So this is an intro to that.

01:24:23.720 --> 01:24:24.720
Neat.

01:24:24.720 --> 01:24:25.720
All right.

01:24:25.720 --> 01:24:26.720
And Nev, I think you know what?

01:24:26.720 --> 01:24:27.720
All right, Brent.

01:24:27.720 --> 01:24:29.840
You tell us when you want to pick the last one.

01:24:29.840 --> 01:24:30.840
I think we're there though.

01:24:30.840 --> 01:24:34.800
I think we're real close because I've seen a lot of number round twos and stuff now.

01:24:34.800 --> 01:24:35.800
So I feel like-

01:24:35.800 --> 01:24:37.880
True Grits just came in and he was looking to double dip.

01:24:37.880 --> 01:24:39.880
So I think that's a good place to go.

01:24:39.880 --> 01:24:40.880
All right.

01:24:40.880 --> 01:24:42.320
Let's do a little double dip there.

01:24:42.320 --> 01:24:45.200
Little dirty double dip.

01:24:45.200 --> 01:24:47.440
And Nev, I'm going to give you some there.

01:24:47.440 --> 01:24:48.440
There you go.

01:24:48.440 --> 01:24:49.760
Enjoy that.

01:24:49.760 --> 01:24:53.960
Here's what I'm thinking is if somebody is listening to this after the fact or they couldn't

01:24:53.960 --> 01:24:57.440
get it set up today because of some technical challenge, let me know on Sunday.

01:24:57.440 --> 01:25:02.260
We could do a few more giveaways during the Linux Unplugged stream after the show.

01:25:02.260 --> 01:25:05.760
And I think that would probably, you know, maybe we can catch a few people that either

01:25:05.760 --> 01:25:11.520
couldn't make it tonight because it's a work night or it's a weird hour or whatever.

01:25:11.520 --> 01:25:12.520
Literally midnight.

01:25:12.520 --> 01:25:13.520
Yeah.

01:25:13.520 --> 01:25:14.520
So we'll do this.

01:25:14.520 --> 01:25:15.520
We do Linux Unplugged.

01:25:15.520 --> 01:25:18.500
We'll do this again for a few at least on Sunday.

01:25:18.500 --> 01:25:20.120
And that starts at noon Pacific.

01:25:20.120 --> 01:25:24.440
But remember, you can always get it converted to your local time at jupiterbroadcasting.com

01:25:24.440 --> 01:25:25.440
slash calendar.

01:25:25.440 --> 01:25:27.680
Did you get true grits there, Wes?

01:25:27.680 --> 01:25:28.680
I sure did.

01:25:28.680 --> 01:25:29.680
There you go.

01:25:29.680 --> 01:25:30.680
True grits.

01:25:30.680 --> 01:25:32.360
There you have it.

01:25:32.360 --> 01:25:34.040
Someone mentioned that logic.

01:25:34.040 --> 01:25:35.040
Didn't get any.

01:25:35.040 --> 01:25:36.040
I'm not sure.

01:25:36.040 --> 01:25:40.440
So I think someone's helping out trying to get it to me.

01:25:40.440 --> 01:25:41.440
So we'll see what we can do.

01:25:41.440 --> 01:25:42.440
OK.

01:25:42.440 --> 01:25:43.440
All right.

01:25:43.440 --> 01:25:45.280
You keep me posted on that because we do have a couple of questions.

01:25:45.280 --> 01:25:48.200
We do want to do a little AMA stuff before we get out of here.

01:25:48.200 --> 01:25:50.920
We don't have a ton of these, but we do have some.

01:25:50.920 --> 01:25:52.760
So let's keep an eye on there and keep an eye on there.

01:25:52.760 --> 01:25:53.760
Let me know if there's any.

01:25:53.760 --> 01:25:54.760
Wow.

01:25:54.760 --> 01:25:55.760
That's a lot.

01:25:55.760 --> 01:25:56.760
That's a lot.

01:25:56.760 --> 01:25:57.760
Damn.

01:25:57.760 --> 01:25:59.920
We destroyed our duck.

01:25:59.920 --> 01:26:00.920
That's great.

01:26:00.920 --> 01:26:01.920
Yeah.

01:26:01.920 --> 01:26:02.920
No, that's great.

01:26:02.920 --> 01:26:03.920
OK.

01:26:03.920 --> 01:26:06.080
So I just I do want to I just want to address one thing.

01:26:06.080 --> 01:26:10.200
And that is I know some people probably nobody listening to this stream have enjoyed the

01:26:10.200 --> 01:26:12.200
crypto content as it's been called.

01:26:12.200 --> 01:26:13.840
I don't really consider it that.

01:26:13.840 --> 01:26:14.840
The boosts are new.

01:26:14.840 --> 01:26:15.840
Right.

01:26:15.840 --> 01:26:17.920
So we've been talking about it a lot right now because the boost just kind of became

01:26:17.920 --> 01:26:18.920
a thing.

01:26:18.920 --> 01:26:20.840
Podcasting 2.0 is just becoming a thing.

01:26:20.840 --> 01:26:23.000
The podcast industry is getting crushed.

01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:25.040
Like all those things are happening at once.

01:26:25.040 --> 01:26:27.280
So it's been a real trendy topic in the show.

01:26:27.280 --> 01:26:29.200
So we do have some people that have some questions about that.

01:26:29.200 --> 01:26:31.120
So I wanted to get to a couple of those.

01:26:31.120 --> 01:26:32.120
Number one came in.

01:26:32.120 --> 01:26:36.640
This has been asked a few times is if you are a member of the Jupiter Party subscription

01:26:36.640 --> 01:26:41.480
or any of the individual show subscriptions, the boost options.

01:26:41.480 --> 01:26:47.840
Don't show up for our members because those are custom feeds for each member that's generated

01:26:47.840 --> 01:26:52.640
by a back end service and they don't support inserting the value for value tag.

01:26:52.640 --> 01:26:57.000
Now, I didn't really expect people who were members would then want to turn around and

01:26:57.000 --> 01:27:00.960
boost a bunch, but it has definitely become a thing.

01:27:00.960 --> 01:27:02.600
So it's something we're thinking about.

01:27:02.600 --> 01:27:06.360
We are definitely thinking about ways to accommodate that, but it's not immediately addressable.

01:27:06.360 --> 01:27:12.120
It probably involves something big on the back end to change.

01:27:12.120 --> 01:27:14.680
There was also a question about Linux boost apps.

01:27:14.680 --> 01:27:17.720
That's probably best done with web apps.

01:27:17.720 --> 01:27:21.800
We're also looking at ways to like embed links in the web pages and the websites or something

01:27:21.800 --> 01:27:22.800
like that.

01:27:22.800 --> 01:27:28.420
There are some command line alternatives too if you want to get real nerdy about it.

01:27:28.420 --> 01:27:33.800
We do get a handful of boosts on the regular from people that are using a command line

01:27:33.800 --> 01:27:36.000
boost client, Boost CLI.

01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:41.840
And you can go grab Boost CLI on GitHub and then you don't need a podcast app or anything.

01:27:41.840 --> 01:27:43.680
You just send it from the command line.

01:27:43.680 --> 01:27:44.680
And then we'll try to-

01:27:44.680 --> 01:27:46.880
Internet connection, your bash terminal, good to go.

01:27:46.880 --> 01:27:49.920
Put it in your Guake drop down terminal, right?

01:27:49.920 --> 01:27:50.920
I mean, come on.

01:27:50.920 --> 01:27:51.920
Yeah.

01:27:51.920 --> 01:27:54.240
Does that mean the wallet is a CLI app too?

01:27:54.240 --> 01:27:55.240
I guess so.

01:27:55.240 --> 01:27:57.480
You've got to play with that.

01:27:57.480 --> 01:27:58.480
I guess so.

01:27:58.480 --> 01:28:02.480
Yeah, I guess it would must generate an address that you just send the lightning sats to.

01:28:02.480 --> 01:28:04.320
Probably should play with it.

01:28:04.320 --> 01:28:09.280
Okay, so I found Logix invoice and Lord of Bytes snuck one in there.

01:28:09.280 --> 01:28:10.280
Okay.

01:28:10.280 --> 01:28:11.280
If you guys get around to that.

01:28:11.280 --> 01:28:12.280
Are they at the bottom of the dock there?

01:28:12.280 --> 01:28:13.280
Oh, yeah.

01:28:13.280 --> 01:28:14.280
The very bottom.

01:28:14.280 --> 01:28:15.280
Scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll.

01:28:15.280 --> 01:28:16.280
Pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew.

01:28:16.280 --> 01:28:17.280
All right.

01:28:17.280 --> 01:28:18.280
You get Lord of Bytes there, Wes.

01:28:18.280 --> 01:28:19.280
What do you say?

01:28:19.280 --> 01:28:20.280
And I'll get Logix.

01:28:20.280 --> 01:28:21.280
All right.

01:28:21.280 --> 01:28:22.280
All right, Logix.

01:28:22.280 --> 01:28:28.040
We're going to send you some damn sats and Lord of Bytes, you're going to get some sats.

01:28:28.040 --> 01:28:29.040
Okay.

01:28:29.040 --> 01:28:30.040
Here.

01:28:30.040 --> 01:28:31.040
Oh, oh, oh.

01:28:31.040 --> 01:28:32.040
All right.

01:28:32.040 --> 01:28:33.040
Here you go.

01:28:33.040 --> 01:28:38.480
I'm not going to say how much that was.

01:28:38.480 --> 01:28:40.280
And Lord of Bytes, your sats.

01:28:40.280 --> 01:28:42.400
There you go.

01:28:42.400 --> 01:28:46.680
Pryor also mentioned that he stayed late at work to participate in this and that someone

01:28:46.680 --> 01:28:51.960
should call his wife, too.

01:28:51.960 --> 01:28:52.960
She has a wallet.

01:28:52.960 --> 01:28:55.840
You know, if she's got a lightning wallet, we can send her some sats to try and pick

01:28:55.840 --> 01:28:56.840
up.

01:28:56.840 --> 01:28:57.840
Totally, right?

01:28:57.840 --> 01:29:03.560
By the way, I really like if you want a lightning wallet that isn't a podcast app, BlueWallet

01:29:03.560 --> 01:29:04.560
is a great app.

01:29:04.560 --> 01:29:05.560
What a sentence that is.

01:29:05.560 --> 01:29:06.560
I know, right?

01:29:06.560 --> 01:29:09.600
It's a funny thing, but it's going to become more and more of a thing.

01:29:09.600 --> 01:29:13.320
So we're also working on getting the value for value tag added to the all shows feed.

01:29:13.320 --> 01:29:16.920
So that'll be coming soon because people are bailing off the all shows feed to subscribe

01:29:16.920 --> 01:29:18.080
to the individual show feed.

01:29:18.080 --> 01:29:19.200
So that way they can boost us.

01:29:19.200 --> 01:29:21.200
That's not necessarily what we want.

01:29:21.200 --> 01:29:24.360
So we're going to be working on that soon.

01:29:24.360 --> 01:29:27.880
And yes, and then the idea is to really not really talk about it as much in the shows

01:29:27.880 --> 01:29:28.880
anymore.

01:29:28.880 --> 01:29:31.060
That's just something that's just sort of been organically happening as boosts have

01:29:31.060 --> 01:29:32.760
been new.

01:29:32.760 --> 01:29:33.760
And here's the tricky thing.

01:29:33.760 --> 01:29:35.920
Because we get excited about it and play with it.

01:29:35.920 --> 01:29:36.920
True.

01:29:36.920 --> 01:29:37.920
True.

01:29:37.920 --> 01:29:39.680
And there is genuinely, as you can tell from tonight, there is genuine interest in the

01:29:39.680 --> 01:29:44.840
audience because the goal here, right, is to create another leg for the podcast industry

01:29:44.840 --> 01:29:47.000
so we can remain independent.

01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:52.000
And when you have this issue of centralization that's crushing us and then something that

01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:58.640
comes along that is peer to peer and completely decentralized and completely self-hostable

01:29:58.640 --> 01:30:05.940
and completely free software, if I genuinely felt after 15 years that my industry was facing

01:30:05.940 --> 01:30:09.920
an existential crisis, how could I not talk about it?

01:30:09.920 --> 01:30:11.740
So there's a little bit of that, too.

01:30:11.740 --> 01:30:13.160
That does play a factor.

01:30:13.160 --> 01:30:17.620
But I think we're going to just transition now into this is just sort of a standard practice.

01:30:17.620 --> 01:30:23.020
We're going to try to feature the most compelling boosts in the shows as a thank you, as a return

01:30:23.020 --> 01:30:24.340
of value for there.

01:30:24.340 --> 01:30:29.120
And the other thing to really consider here is there's other ways to participate, and

01:30:29.120 --> 01:30:34.080
it's for all podcasts that you really love, that demonstrate value that is not necessarily

01:30:34.080 --> 01:30:38.760
sats, you know, like Minimax shows up at all kinds of different crazy hours to help us

01:30:38.760 --> 01:30:42.040
manage the mumble room and help people check their microphones.

01:30:42.040 --> 01:30:46.400
And that makes a huge difference for our mumble room, for how it runs and the quality of what

01:30:46.400 --> 01:30:47.400
we get on air.

01:30:47.400 --> 01:30:48.400
It's huge, right?

01:30:48.400 --> 01:30:49.400
No kidding.

01:30:49.400 --> 01:30:52.320
That's more valuable than sats.

01:30:52.320 --> 01:30:53.960
It's different ways of doing things.

01:30:53.960 --> 01:30:57.480
So the whole idea, it's talent, time, or treasure.

01:30:57.480 --> 01:31:02.800
And for a lot of us who are busy, the treasure is the most reasonable and quickest accessible

01:31:02.800 --> 01:31:03.800
way.

01:31:03.800 --> 01:31:09.360
And you say, well, OK, well, why sats over, say, just some fiat by becoming a member or

01:31:09.360 --> 01:31:10.760
some other kind of thing?

01:31:10.760 --> 01:31:14.320
To that, I would say it really depends on what you are the most comfortable with.

01:31:14.320 --> 01:31:16.880
Whatever you prefer, we're great with.

01:31:16.880 --> 01:31:21.960
What we like about the Lightning Network and sats is that, A, it can be less than a dollar

01:31:21.960 --> 01:31:23.320
if you choose.

01:31:23.320 --> 01:31:28.240
That wouldn't be viable with any financial system, any bank system that JB could work

01:31:28.240 --> 01:31:29.240
with.

01:31:29.240 --> 01:31:31.480
The fees alone would be more than that $1, right?

01:31:31.480 --> 01:31:38.160
So it kind of needs to be like $3 or $5 or $20, right, because there's a chunk that all

01:31:38.160 --> 01:31:42.320
the people, Stripe takes or whoever it is, the bank takes, Visa takes, everybody gets

01:31:42.320 --> 01:31:43.320
a cut with that.

01:31:43.320 --> 01:31:47.920
But with the Lightning Network, it's stupid low fees, especially people participating

01:31:47.920 --> 01:31:49.540
in the podcast index network.

01:31:49.540 --> 01:31:50.960
The channel fees are really low.

01:31:50.960 --> 01:31:54.980
So people can send us a few cents, or people can send us $50.

01:31:54.980 --> 01:31:58.200
And that $50 is something that we would probably sit on, because I'm not really intending to

01:31:58.200 --> 01:31:59.920
spend any of this Bitcoin.

01:31:59.920 --> 01:32:04.680
And we would sit on there and use that as an asset that adds value to not only our balance

01:32:04.680 --> 01:32:08.560
sheet, but is potentially going to grow in value over time.

01:32:08.560 --> 01:32:15.640
So your $50 that you sent us maybe today could be worth $100 in a year or two.

01:32:15.640 --> 01:32:21.400
And okay, yeah, you lost out on 50 bucks plus the gains, but also your one-time $50 donation

01:32:21.400 --> 01:32:26.860
continued to work for multiple years for the podcast network that you like.

01:32:26.860 --> 01:32:29.440
And so there's multiple motivations.

01:32:29.440 --> 01:32:31.540
It could be for really cheap reasons.

01:32:31.540 --> 01:32:35.720
It can be for strategic investment reasons, but it doesn't have to be SaaS.

01:32:35.720 --> 01:32:37.080
It could be time.

01:32:37.080 --> 01:32:38.560
It could be talent.

01:32:38.560 --> 01:32:40.080
It could also be memberships.

01:32:40.080 --> 01:32:42.080
It could be using our sponsors.

01:32:42.080 --> 01:32:46.520
It could be sharing our shows with people, all of that stuff.

01:32:46.520 --> 01:32:49.400
And I think that's where we're going to kind of move the conversation in the future.

01:32:49.400 --> 01:32:53.680
So I appreciate everybody's patience as we got this.

01:32:53.680 --> 01:32:54.920
I boosted about Nyx OS.

01:32:54.920 --> 01:32:55.920
Oh, okay.

01:32:55.920 --> 01:32:56.920
That was your boost.

01:32:56.920 --> 01:33:01.040
So for the record, Nev's boost about Nyx OS on the laptop, desktop, and now on the servers,

01:33:01.040 --> 01:33:03.720
that was Nev.

01:33:03.720 --> 01:33:09.200
Keep us posted on how that goes because I am thinking it could make some nice workstation

01:33:09.200 --> 01:33:11.920
type machines.

01:33:11.920 --> 01:33:15.360
We had a tax question in here, so let's talk about that really quick because this is something

01:33:15.360 --> 01:33:19.040
that doesn't come up a lot, and I think this is something everybody needs to think about.

01:33:19.040 --> 01:33:20.040
So I don't-

01:33:20.040 --> 01:33:21.920
As you know, we are tax experts.

01:33:21.920 --> 01:33:23.160
Yeah, yeah.

01:33:23.160 --> 01:33:26.780
This is 100% always financial advice, and you should do everything that I say.

01:33:26.780 --> 01:33:27.780
And I am a tax...

01:33:27.780 --> 01:33:28.780
No, I'm not.

01:33:28.780 --> 01:33:29.780
No, of course not.

01:33:29.780 --> 01:33:31.560
That's why we turn to our Canadian friend, Brent, with an expert in our American tax

01:33:31.560 --> 01:33:32.560
system.

01:33:32.560 --> 01:33:33.560
Right.

01:33:33.560 --> 01:33:36.440
Yeah, my advice is seek advice.

01:33:36.440 --> 01:33:38.720
Nice, dude.

01:33:38.720 --> 01:33:40.960
Okay, so the tax implications.

01:33:40.960 --> 01:33:45.380
So Bitcoin is a property.

01:33:45.380 --> 01:33:46.380
It's considered by the...

01:33:46.380 --> 01:33:49.000
I know this is going to be different everywhere you're at, but it's considered by the IRS

01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:50.000
property.

01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:55.280
So there is implications if you buy Bitcoin, and then you sit on that Bitcoin, and that

01:33:55.280 --> 01:33:59.400
Bitcoin goes up in value.

01:33:59.400 --> 01:34:03.640
You have some tax ramifications there, just like if you bought anything else that's an

01:34:03.640 --> 01:34:06.240
asset that goes up in value.

01:34:06.240 --> 01:34:11.480
Now I think that exposure is pretty low when it's a couple of bucks, and then you spend

01:34:11.480 --> 01:34:12.840
it immediately, so there's that.

01:34:12.840 --> 01:34:16.200
Now I don't know for sure, but I think that means it's pretty much a pretty low exposure

01:34:16.200 --> 01:34:21.380
because you're selling it and buying at exactly the same price.

01:34:21.380 --> 01:34:27.320
So there's a whole range of questions and answers that we're all going to start getting

01:34:27.320 --> 01:34:29.640
over the next couple of years about this.

01:34:29.640 --> 01:34:34.820
Literally every major Western government is working on regulations and figuring out tax

01:34:34.820 --> 01:34:37.040
policies right now.

01:34:37.040 --> 01:34:38.500
So this is all getting sorted out.

01:34:38.500 --> 01:34:43.960
We are definitely early adopters in this area, but as somebody who has been experimenting

01:34:43.960 --> 01:34:50.420
with this for about 12 years, what I have found is it's basically quite simple.

01:34:50.420 --> 01:34:54.720
You hold the Bitcoin, and if you're going to spend the Bitcoin, you buy and spend the

01:34:54.720 --> 01:34:56.320
Bitcoin kind of immediately.

01:34:56.320 --> 01:34:59.440
And that's kind of where I think Lightning is sort of great, because you can with Strike,

01:34:59.440 --> 01:35:05.180
for example, you could buy it with USD right away, it immediately on the back end converts

01:35:05.180 --> 01:35:08.880
it to Lightning, so it's exactly at the moment of sale, and it's sent off as Lightning and

01:35:08.880 --> 01:35:09.880
it's done.

01:35:09.880 --> 01:35:12.500
So they convert it instantaneously.

01:35:12.500 --> 01:35:16.720
And I think that is probably what is going to be adopted going forward.

01:35:16.720 --> 01:35:21.840
And additionally, and when I say adopted, I mean like that kind of instant buy and spend

01:35:21.840 --> 01:35:25.560
where you're not sitting on the Bitcoin for a year before you spend it, so there wasn't

01:35:25.560 --> 01:35:26.560
like a gain there.

01:35:26.560 --> 01:35:28.380
I think that's going to become more common.

01:35:28.380 --> 01:35:31.840
But then the other thing that's also going to possibly develop, we don't know if the

01:35:31.840 --> 01:35:35.060
dollar amount is going to be yet, but again, this is US specific because that's the jurisdiction

01:35:35.060 --> 01:35:40.320
I know, is there's presently a bill in the Senate that would eliminate all capital gains

01:35:40.320 --> 01:35:46.040
tax on $600 or below, any transaction $600 or below.

01:35:46.040 --> 01:35:50.320
The number, the dollar amount is going to get screwed with, I would not be surprised

01:35:50.320 --> 01:35:53.480
if they cut it in half, so it's like $300 or something like that.

01:35:53.480 --> 01:35:57.620
But that is also something that's been, and the nice thing about that bill is it seems

01:35:57.620 --> 01:36:02.800
to be, I'd have to double check, but it seems to be there's bipartisan support behind that

01:36:02.800 --> 01:36:03.800
one.

01:36:03.800 --> 01:36:11.960
So, and last but not least, you could also, if you're not comfortable with that aspect,

01:36:11.960 --> 01:36:15.680
you could always just join a membership program like jupyter.party, and you get access to

01:36:15.680 --> 01:36:16.680
that stuff.

01:36:16.680 --> 01:36:21.440
Ultimately, ultimately, I want to get access to this kind of stuff, I want to try to figure

01:36:21.440 --> 01:36:24.840
out a system that's really integrated, but it's all new, it's all early.

01:36:24.840 --> 01:36:29.820
It's sort of like a year ago with Matrix, we weren't really sure if this was a wild

01:36:29.820 --> 01:36:34.480
science experiment, or if this was the future of how we're going to do communication.

01:36:34.480 --> 01:36:36.720
And now we're starting to lean towards the latter.

01:36:36.720 --> 01:36:41.840
And with boost and value for value, I'm starting to really think, okay, how do I want this

01:36:41.840 --> 01:36:44.320
to work for the next 15 years?

01:36:44.320 --> 01:36:47.640
So I'm beginning a 15-year journey now.

01:36:47.640 --> 01:36:51.160
You're all witnessing the beginning of the next 15 years of JB, it's something I think

01:36:51.160 --> 01:36:52.440
about a lot recently.

01:36:52.440 --> 01:36:56.200
I think in part just because I hit 40, and in part because we kind of hit the two-year

01:36:56.200 --> 01:37:01.280
mark of being independent, and also because the ad industry is changing, and also because

01:37:01.280 --> 01:37:05.160
the whole macro economy is a total shit show.

01:37:05.160 --> 01:37:12.760
So all of these things really are on my mind, and I can see a lot of similarities here.

01:37:12.760 --> 01:37:19.520
Bitcoin and the Lightning Network are about at 1997 right now.

01:37:19.520 --> 01:37:20.520
That's where they're at.

01:37:20.520 --> 01:37:28.600
You know, you're on AOL or CompuServe or whatever, and you're getting connected to old chat rooms.

01:37:28.600 --> 01:37:30.800
That's where we're at right now with Bitcoin.

01:37:30.800 --> 01:37:36.040
And if you actually overlay the Bitcoin adoption chart with the internet adoption chart, it's

01:37:36.040 --> 01:37:38.760
incredible how they sync up.

01:37:38.760 --> 01:37:43.000
The Bitcoin has the advantage of the entire network is already there.

01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:46.200
TCPIP is already in every home and every business.

01:37:46.200 --> 01:37:49.260
The internet didn't have that advantage, it had to build that out.

01:37:49.260 --> 01:37:51.080
So it's going to go even faster.

01:37:51.080 --> 01:37:56.200
But we're about at 1997, and we're starting to get things like Strike, we're starting

01:37:56.200 --> 01:38:00.580
to get things like the Cash App, we're going to start seeing Apple Pay support and things

01:38:00.580 --> 01:38:01.580
like Strike.

01:38:01.580 --> 01:38:06.800
It's going to get easier and easier as time goes on, but we're still in that early adopter

01:38:06.800 --> 01:38:08.100
phase right now.

01:38:08.100 --> 01:38:13.280
And so that's why I'm getting on board, because I was an early adopter on Linux.

01:38:13.280 --> 01:38:23.440
You know, I spent so much of my career advocating and convincing people that Linux and free

01:38:23.440 --> 01:38:26.240
software wasn't a scam.

01:38:26.240 --> 01:38:33.440
And I regret in some ways that I got out of the industry before I got to enjoy just it

01:38:33.440 --> 01:38:36.640
being the default and assumed.

01:38:36.640 --> 01:38:39.760
I never stuck around long enough to see that, because I switched over to podcasting full

01:38:39.760 --> 01:38:40.760
time.

01:38:40.760 --> 01:38:45.800
But when I switched over to podcasting full time, that was also really new, right?

01:38:45.800 --> 01:38:50.400
It was really not something that anybody in our space was doing full time.

01:38:50.400 --> 01:38:53.460
Not really any podcasters were doing it full time when I started doing it.

01:38:53.460 --> 01:38:57.960
Maybe Leo Leport by then, maybe.

01:38:57.960 --> 01:39:02.040
Maybe Adam Curry, I would assume, I mean, like just a handful of folks, right?

01:39:02.040 --> 01:39:08.200
It was really early and I think some of my very close family members still don't understand

01:39:08.200 --> 01:39:09.200
what I'm doing.

01:39:09.200 --> 01:39:10.200
And they think I'm crazy.

01:39:10.200 --> 01:39:11.200
They think I'm ridiculous.

01:39:11.200 --> 01:39:12.200
Right?

01:39:12.200 --> 01:39:13.200
It's just sort of been that way.

01:39:13.200 --> 01:39:16.000
And I think there's some of our, I think some of our audience or some of our audience out

01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:18.880
there that kind of has a little bit of an early adopter streak in them.

01:39:18.880 --> 01:39:21.240
Not all of them, but I think some, right?

01:39:21.240 --> 01:39:22.240
It's fun.

01:39:22.240 --> 01:39:23.880
It's fun to help pioneer some of this stuff.

01:39:23.880 --> 01:39:27.880
Yeah, you get to be on the ground floor to see what things work and obviously not everything

01:39:27.880 --> 01:39:28.880
does right?

01:39:28.880 --> 01:39:33.480
There's the latest new open source tech project that is really excited for two years and then

01:39:33.480 --> 01:39:35.640
the founders move on or the project gets bought or whatever, right?

01:39:35.640 --> 01:39:38.920
And it's going to be totally the same in a lot of the spaces that we get excited about

01:39:38.920 --> 01:39:39.920
with technology.

01:39:39.920 --> 01:39:40.920
Yep.

01:39:40.920 --> 01:39:41.920
Yeah.

01:39:41.920 --> 01:39:44.960
We're going to watch sort of a dot com boom and bust kind of all over again.

01:39:44.960 --> 01:39:46.000
That's pretty neat.

01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:49.560
And so now hopefully you've been armed.

01:39:49.560 --> 01:39:52.720
So we have a couple that haven't been, that haven't gotten their Bitcoins.

01:39:52.720 --> 01:39:55.100
It looks like people, a couple of people didn't get their SATs.

01:39:55.100 --> 01:39:57.180
So we'll make good on those and I think we're going to wrap it up.

01:39:57.180 --> 01:39:58.180
So Brent, where are those ones?

01:39:58.180 --> 01:39:59.440
Are they at the bottom of the dock?

01:39:59.440 --> 01:40:04.640
Yeah, I kind of separated where you guys sort of stopped talking about them at the late

01:40:04.640 --> 01:40:05.880
boost it says.

01:40:05.880 --> 01:40:09.720
So a few, a few folks there we've sent some to already, but a few folks are new.

01:40:09.720 --> 01:40:10.720
Late boost.

01:40:10.720 --> 01:40:11.720
Jupiter.

01:40:11.720 --> 01:40:12.720
How do you say that one?

01:40:12.720 --> 01:40:16.400
Do you think Brent Jupiter Barrera Barrera?

01:40:16.400 --> 01:40:17.400
Yeah.

01:40:17.400 --> 01:40:19.840
I mean, that's, that's, I mean, that's a great name.

01:40:19.840 --> 01:40:20.840
That's rad.

01:40:20.840 --> 01:40:21.840
That's really rad.

01:40:21.840 --> 01:40:22.840
Yep.

01:40:22.840 --> 01:40:23.840
Yep.

01:40:23.840 --> 01:40:24.840
All right.

01:40:24.840 --> 01:40:25.840
And Tuck's getting an error with fountain.

01:40:25.840 --> 01:40:26.840
Interesting.

01:40:26.840 --> 01:40:27.840
I haven't seen that one.

01:40:27.840 --> 01:40:28.840
But did you already get Barrera?

01:40:28.840 --> 01:40:29.840
Cause Barrera has already been GAT.

01:40:29.840 --> 01:40:30.840
I don't know.

01:40:30.840 --> 01:40:35.160
I've gotten a couple, but I, that, that name doesn't look familiar.

01:40:35.160 --> 01:40:37.840
Now, Elliot, what client is Elliot using?

01:40:37.840 --> 01:40:41.760
Because look how Elliot's address is formatted differently than everybody else's.

01:40:41.760 --> 01:40:42.760
You seeing that?

01:40:42.760 --> 01:40:44.080
It's just slightly different.

01:40:44.080 --> 01:40:45.080
It's all uppercase.

01:40:45.080 --> 01:40:46.080
Huh.

01:40:46.080 --> 01:40:48.080
I wonder what client that is.

01:40:48.080 --> 01:40:51.440
Elliot, do you, do you want to share with the class?

01:40:51.440 --> 01:40:53.680
You're getting a, you're getting a boost though.

01:40:53.680 --> 01:40:54.680
There you go.

01:40:54.680 --> 01:40:59.600
I also noticed that some addresses are longer than others, so I'm curious about how that

01:40:59.600 --> 01:41:00.600
all works.

01:41:00.600 --> 01:41:01.600
Hmm.

01:41:01.600 --> 01:41:02.600
Hmm.

01:41:02.600 --> 01:41:03.600
Should we give Tim some umbral love?

01:41:03.600 --> 01:41:04.600
What do you say?

01:41:04.600 --> 01:41:05.600
Give it a shot.

01:41:05.600 --> 01:41:06.600
I might've got that one.

01:41:06.600 --> 01:41:07.600
You might've?

01:41:07.600 --> 01:41:08.600
All right.

01:41:08.600 --> 01:41:09.600
I'll see.

01:41:09.600 --> 01:41:10.600
I'll see.

01:41:10.600 --> 01:41:11.600
I'll check.

01:41:11.600 --> 01:41:12.600
I'll check.

01:41:12.600 --> 01:41:13.600
Cause if you didn't, I'll get it.

01:41:13.600 --> 01:41:14.600
Cause that's the nice thing is it'll tell me if you got it.

01:41:14.600 --> 01:41:15.600
Nope.

01:41:15.600 --> 01:41:16.600
2000 stats going to you, Tim.

01:41:16.600 --> 01:41:18.520
There you go.

01:41:18.520 --> 01:41:19.520
There you go.

01:41:19.520 --> 01:41:23.320
I've lost track of how many times some of these people, we're not even in the double

01:41:23.320 --> 01:41:25.000
dip territory anymore.

01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:26.000
I don't think.

01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:28.240
Oh, unable to find the payment route.

01:41:28.240 --> 01:41:29.240
Okay.

01:41:29.240 --> 01:41:33.680
So, so if you just got your umbral box set up, you probably need to open up some inbound

01:41:33.680 --> 01:41:35.140
channels.

01:41:35.140 --> 01:41:37.160
What an adventure you're about to go on.

01:41:37.160 --> 01:41:38.160
Yeah, really.

01:41:38.160 --> 01:41:39.160
We had fun with that.

01:41:39.160 --> 01:41:41.960
I remember we said this was early adopter stuff.

01:41:41.960 --> 01:41:45.680
So what you want is there are a couple of different places where you can give them like

01:41:45.680 --> 01:41:50.680
some, some Bitcoin dust basically, and they'll open up an inbound channel to you.

01:41:50.680 --> 01:41:52.040
That's what you need.

01:41:52.040 --> 01:41:55.720
You need an inbound channel cause it's a, it is a peer to peer network.

01:41:55.720 --> 01:42:01.080
Now there are tools in umbral if I've never done this, but if you want to, there is an

01:42:01.080 --> 01:42:02.080
app.

01:42:02.080 --> 01:42:05.720
You can install the number that lets you bid on channels and you can buy and sell channel

01:42:05.720 --> 01:42:09.340
access and it's a little way to make a little extra money on the side.

01:42:09.340 --> 01:42:12.520
But I figured I don't need to mess with any of that.

01:42:12.520 --> 01:42:13.520
So all right.

01:42:13.520 --> 01:42:14.520
Yeah.

01:42:14.520 --> 01:42:15.520
Okay.

01:42:15.520 --> 01:42:16.520
Did you get connected to Chris?

01:42:16.520 --> 01:42:17.880
I know there's, well, podcasting 2.0, right?

01:42:17.880 --> 01:42:24.560
Yeah, and I also, I took advantage of like a send us, send us like a cup, a little dust

01:42:24.560 --> 01:42:29.680
and we'll open up a channel to you and then some listeners and I have opened up some channels.

01:42:29.680 --> 01:42:33.340
So I think I got like six channels now to our six or seven channels that come into our

01:42:33.340 --> 01:42:35.920
node now, like a bus.

01:42:35.920 --> 01:42:39.620
And I, if I, if I was really thinking ahead, I probably would be posting our node address

01:42:39.620 --> 01:42:42.960
more so we could have more channels because the more channels you're connected to the

01:42:42.960 --> 01:42:47.120
different routes, the lightning network can find and it'll, you know, always try to find

01:42:47.120 --> 01:42:49.120
the most efficient route.

01:42:49.120 --> 01:42:51.360
And then it's, you know, all set up and ready to go.

01:42:51.360 --> 01:42:52.360
It's a cool thing.

01:42:52.360 --> 01:42:53.360
It's a pretty neat thing.

01:42:53.360 --> 01:42:57.160
It is complicated, but it is also a lot of fun.

01:42:57.160 --> 01:43:00.960
Uh oh, we got one more boost before we get out of here.

01:43:00.960 --> 01:43:01.960
What?

01:43:01.960 --> 01:43:02.960
Secret last boost?

01:43:02.960 --> 01:43:03.960
Oh, we got two.

01:43:03.960 --> 01:43:04.960
We just got another boost too.

01:43:04.960 --> 01:43:11.440
Just as I, so a couple of minutes ago from a sir lurks a lot, I guess, from a self hosted

01:43:11.440 --> 01:43:14.200
67, the no container theory episode.

01:43:14.200 --> 01:43:16.440
This is my first boost, Tim from the AMA.

01:43:16.440 --> 01:43:17.440
Thanks.

01:43:17.440 --> 01:43:18.440
Well, there you go, Tim.

01:43:18.440 --> 01:43:19.440
You're welcome.

01:43:19.440 --> 01:43:23.480
And then, uh, John, that's the best username so far, I think Jonah tucks, I think is what

01:43:23.480 --> 01:43:24.480
we went with.

01:43:24.480 --> 01:43:28.680
Jonah tucks, uh, just boosted us 500 sats for the next SOS challenge.

01:43:28.680 --> 01:43:34.320
Uh, and then a turquoise Fox just sent one in, uh, says I managed to send you two payments

01:43:34.320 --> 01:43:35.640
with the same question.

01:43:35.640 --> 01:43:37.200
So enjoy the extra sats.

01:43:37.200 --> 01:43:42.680
And then I think, uh, I'm not sure if Bitcoin social is actually watching live.

01:43:42.680 --> 01:43:44.240
I think he just sent us a boost for coder.

01:43:44.240 --> 01:43:50.320
He's watching live, but, uh, he says Chris Rock can say whatever he wants.

01:43:50.320 --> 01:43:52.120
I have no idea what he's referring to.

01:43:52.120 --> 01:43:53.120
No, no idea.

01:43:53.120 --> 01:43:56.400
Uh, and then, oh, we got a question that came in via boost.

01:43:56.400 --> 01:43:57.400
I'm sorry guys.

01:43:57.400 --> 01:43:59.080
I, we just got another one.

01:43:59.080 --> 01:44:03.680
Uh, so turquoise Fox wants to know if the Jupiter Jupiter membership will ever be available

01:44:03.680 --> 01:44:06.560
via sats, uh, because I don't like the credit card requirement.

01:44:06.560 --> 01:44:07.560
Yeah.

01:44:07.560 --> 01:44:09.480
That is probably something we're going to work on eventually.

01:44:09.480 --> 01:44:10.480
That's a great question.

01:44:10.480 --> 01:44:11.480
Yeah.

01:44:11.480 --> 01:44:12.480
Yeah.

01:44:12.480 --> 01:44:13.480
Yeah.

01:44:13.480 --> 01:44:14.480
That's a great question.

01:44:14.480 --> 01:44:22.480
500 sats just came in from user 78 0 0 6 6 4 2 8 1 1 3 0 7 0.

01:44:22.480 --> 01:44:24.920
Love the show and all you do for the community.

01:44:24.920 --> 01:44:26.720
This is a great way to get us on the network.

01:44:26.720 --> 01:44:28.200
Well, thank you.

01:44:28.200 --> 01:44:29.200
Thank you.

01:44:29.200 --> 01:44:30.200
Oh yeah.

01:44:30.200 --> 01:44:32.480
I will totally plug Bitcoin dad pod.

01:44:32.480 --> 01:44:37.360
It's a what's I'm doing a weekly Bitcoin podcast with the Bitcoin dad.

01:44:37.360 --> 01:44:42.920
So you can get that at Bitcoin dad pod dot fireside dot FM.

01:44:42.920 --> 01:44:47.720
Rocks just boosted us said thanks for the content, the challenge and the channel.

01:44:47.720 --> 01:44:48.720
Awesome.

01:44:48.720 --> 01:44:49.720
Another boost just came in.

01:44:49.720 --> 01:44:50.720
Wow.

01:44:50.720 --> 01:44:51.760
You guys love the show.

01:44:51.760 --> 01:44:52.760
Thank you.

01:44:52.760 --> 01:44:53.760
Thank you.

01:44:53.760 --> 01:44:54.760
All right.

01:44:54.760 --> 01:44:55.760
We got to wrap it up though.

01:44:55.760 --> 01:44:57.520
Uh, but yeah, keep sending them boosts on the boosts.

01:44:57.520 --> 01:44:58.520
Yeah.

01:44:58.520 --> 01:44:59.520
Keep boosting.

01:44:59.520 --> 01:45:02.000
Can you send some to a, can you send a little love to Mac?

01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:04.000
I think he just finally got shirt setups.

01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:05.000
Totally.

01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:06.000
Good, good, good, good job back.

01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:07.000
I'm glad.

01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:09.120
I'm glad we were able to take our time with this cause I know some of this is a bit of

01:45:09.120 --> 01:45:12.880
a process and kind of being here with you guys while we do this.

01:45:12.880 --> 01:45:15.760
Gives us an idea of where the sticky spots are.

01:45:15.760 --> 01:45:17.760
So there you go, Mac.

01:45:17.760 --> 01:45:20.680
You just got some sets.

01:45:20.680 --> 01:45:22.200
Thank you for making it work.

01:45:22.200 --> 01:45:26.520
Well, maybe, maybe it's trying unable to find the payment route.

01:45:26.520 --> 01:45:27.560
So Mac, you might be on it.

01:45:27.560 --> 01:45:32.880
So you could tell who's on a self hosted instance because it's not working.

01:45:32.880 --> 01:45:35.320
I'll try again, but it may not work Mac.

01:45:35.320 --> 01:45:40.560
You may need some inbound liquidity or you may need to set it up in a, uh, it could also

01:45:40.560 --> 01:45:47.640
be, oh, you know, I wonder if we just used up the inbound liquidity for LN pay that which

01:45:47.640 --> 01:45:49.160
fountain uses.

01:45:49.160 --> 01:45:54.320
I wonder if we just, yeah, we might've just, cause we've been, we've been going for a while

01:45:54.320 --> 01:45:55.780
sending a lot of stats.

01:45:55.780 --> 01:45:59.440
So, um, that could totally be a thing, which is, oh, that's okay.

01:45:59.440 --> 01:46:01.360
We're going to do this again on Sunday, Mac.

01:46:01.360 --> 01:46:06.280
So if you'd like to stop by on Sunday, remind me and, uh, we'll get you taken care of.

01:46:06.280 --> 01:46:07.280
That's true for anybody.

01:46:07.280 --> 01:46:10.040
Cause it looks like we've literally, oh yeah.

01:46:10.040 --> 01:46:11.040
I'm here.

01:46:11.040 --> 01:46:12.040
Yeah.

01:46:12.040 --> 01:46:13.040
We've worn out our welcome.

01:46:13.040 --> 01:46:14.280
We have worn out our welcome on that one.

01:46:14.280 --> 01:46:15.280
Just in time.

01:46:15.280 --> 01:46:16.280
Yeah.

01:46:16.280 --> 01:46:17.280
You know what?

01:46:17.280 --> 01:46:18.920
I got to say, um, I want to do a shout out to Elliot.

01:46:18.920 --> 01:46:21.480
He says he's paying some stats for other people.

01:46:21.480 --> 01:46:24.040
So, oh, thanks Elliot.

01:46:24.040 --> 01:46:25.040
Yeah.

01:46:25.040 --> 01:46:26.040
Pretty great.

01:46:26.040 --> 01:46:29.320
I was going to say too, is that sometimes other people could get the route depending

01:46:29.320 --> 01:46:31.320
on your channels and all of that.

01:46:31.320 --> 01:46:36.120
Um, something that I'll probably learn more about as it becomes more serious, but you

01:46:36.120 --> 01:46:38.360
can also be strategic about your channels.

01:46:38.360 --> 01:46:44.080
There's some people who, uh, also are like really, really clever about who they open

01:46:44.080 --> 01:46:45.840
up channels to and how they set the fees.

01:46:45.840 --> 01:46:50.440
Uh, the Kraken exchange just started accepting lightning as a way to get Bitcoin on and off

01:46:50.440 --> 01:46:51.440
Kraken.

01:46:51.440 --> 01:46:52.440
Is that right?

01:46:52.440 --> 01:46:55.600
And that seems like one of the bigger things, you know, like the more places that really

01:46:55.600 --> 01:46:59.680
integrate into this, you know, the more liquidity in the system, that's when it could really

01:46:59.680 --> 01:47:03.120
get, you know, from like something we have to put kind of play around with this as a

01:47:03.120 --> 01:47:05.800
half toy to something that's really just useful.

01:47:05.800 --> 01:47:09.320
I think they put like 13 Bitcoin of liquidity on there too.

01:47:09.320 --> 01:47:10.320
Nice.

01:47:10.320 --> 01:47:14.680
Yeah, there's some people though, they're like connecting their channels and they're

01:47:14.680 --> 01:47:18.240
like cranking up the fees, but all that will get sorted out, you know, cause it's early

01:47:18.240 --> 01:47:19.240
days.

01:47:19.240 --> 01:47:20.240
So, all right.

01:47:20.240 --> 01:47:22.720
Well, thank you guys for being here to help us kick off the next 15 years.

01:47:22.720 --> 01:47:27.320
Don't forget if you'd like to do more of this, one way to definitely make this possible

01:47:27.320 --> 01:47:32.840
is by thanking Linode by visiting linode.com slash Jupiter, you get a hundred dollar credit

01:47:32.840 --> 01:47:33.840
on a new account.

01:47:33.840 --> 01:47:36.720
And it's a way to say thanks for supporting the live stream because they're kind of taking

01:47:36.720 --> 01:47:38.760
a gamble on this sort of thing.

01:47:38.760 --> 01:47:40.400
So it's always appreciated.

01:47:40.400 --> 01:47:45.080
And join us on Sunday where we'll do this and some Linux Unplugged, maybe that Linux

01:47:45.080 --> 01:47:46.080
podcast too.

01:47:46.080 --> 01:47:47.640
All right.

01:47:47.640 --> 01:47:48.640
Thanks guys.

01:47:48.640 --> 01:47:49.640
Appreciate you.

01:47:49.640 --> 01:47:50.640
Thank you.

01:47:50.640 --> 01:47:51.640
Bye everyone.

01:47:51.640 --> 01:47:52.640
Thank you.

01:47:52.640 --> 01:47:53.640
Bumble room.

01:47:53.640 --> 01:47:54.640
Thank you.

01:47:54.640 --> 01:47:55.640
Chat room.

01:47:55.640 --> 01:47:56.640
Come hang out in the other Matrix rooms.

01:47:56.640 --> 01:48:00.280
If you just joined the Matrix, don't forget, we've got a bunch of other channels in there.

01:48:00.280 --> 01:48:04.740
All kinds of stuff, including the Nyx nerds room for our Nyx challenge.

01:48:04.740 --> 01:48:05.740
That's in there as well.

01:48:05.740 --> 01:48:08.360
So love to see you in there.

01:48:08.360 --> 01:48:09.480
All right.

01:48:09.480 --> 01:48:10.480
That's it.

01:48:10.480 --> 01:48:11.480
Thanks everybody.

01:48:11.480 --> 01:48:12.480
Let's do it again soon.

01:48:12.480 --> 01:48:36.200
Thanks for watching.

01:49:06.200 --> 01:49:08.200
You
