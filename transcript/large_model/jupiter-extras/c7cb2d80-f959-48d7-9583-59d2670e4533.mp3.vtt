WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:21.600
It's Office Hours. With me. It's Office Hours with Chris. Right now. This moment? And Chase.

00:21.600 --> 00:27.520
Hi. Hey Chasey. You just drugged me in here. I was trying to clean out all the trash cans

00:27.520 --> 00:33.600
around the office and you're like, hey, why don't you come here? Did you know in Japanese culture,

00:33.600 --> 00:40.640
the youngest office employee comes in early to clean out the trash every day and clean up the

00:40.640 --> 00:44.520
office and make coffee? Did you know that's a real thing? And they don't really do janitorial

00:44.520 --> 00:50.440
services much? I did not, but that makes sense. But it wouldn't, you're not our newest hire though,

00:50.440 --> 00:54.520
so it wouldn't be you, would it? No, not technically, but Drew said he wouldn't do it,

00:54.520 --> 00:59.720
so I'm just taking on the duties, man. You know what I'm thinking? What's that? What are you

00:59.720 --> 01:04.440
thinking? I'm thinking next week, I'm going to do the whole week from Eastern Washington,

01:04.440 --> 01:10.760
except for Tuesday. Oh yeah? Yeah, I'm thinking like, just try to like get a little bit of summer

01:10.760 --> 01:17.480
left here on the West coast of Washington. It is nothing but rain now, but I'm thinking if I cross

01:17.480 --> 01:22.760
the mountains, it's still above mid seventies over there. I could probably eke out like another week

01:22.760 --> 01:29.000
of summer. So where would you go then on that side of the state? Like what would be the destination?

01:29.000 --> 01:36.520
Oh, I got a place. I got a place. Yeah, I got a really good place. You know, I found this spot

01:36.520 --> 01:45.320
not too long ago that is on the Methow River and it's got full signal, which is hard to get in that

01:45.320 --> 01:52.120
area of Eastern Washington. It's got full signal. It's about a two hour and 45 minute drive from the

01:52.120 --> 01:57.880
studio. That sounds like a no brainer then. Yeah. Oh, that's going to be so good. It's going to be

01:57.880 --> 02:03.480
so good. I hope it works out. We'll see. I'm going to come in a couple of times a week to do shows

02:04.120 --> 02:08.440
and then like all of like the pre show work and research and all of the office stuff I have to do,

02:08.440 --> 02:13.000
I'm going to do from my spot on the river. I'll see. That would be rad, dude. I know.

02:14.360 --> 02:20.600
We'll see how it goes. I don't know. I just, I have to like, I have to do something because

02:20.600 --> 02:24.520
it's a six days a week kind of job, often seven days a week kind of job.

02:24.520 --> 02:29.320
So I never, I never, I never get to like take advantage of all of the vacation I bank.

02:29.320 --> 02:33.080
Now as an actual employee, I could be banking vacation. I never get it. I never get to take

02:33.080 --> 02:37.800
advantage of it. So I thought, well, what I'll do is I'll just work. I'll spend a work week

02:37.800 --> 02:42.600
minus a few days from the river. Yeah. I mean, that sounds like a rational decision,

02:42.600 --> 02:46.520
you know, and I've always personally been one of those people that always struggle to take my

02:46.520 --> 02:52.600
vacation time off anyway, just getting out of the office and, you know, not being needed.

02:52.600 --> 02:58.280
And, and I'm sure obviously you have, you suffer from that same problem even more so than I do,

02:58.280 --> 03:03.720
but I know a lot of us here at the network, uh, it really is kind of a seven day a week type of

03:03.720 --> 03:10.920
job. I mean, it's just, um, we don't disconnect from telegram or IRC or, uh, Twitter or any of

03:10.920 --> 03:15.240
the other social avenues. We're always following the news. We're always checking the news multiple

03:15.240 --> 03:20.840
times a day. And that goes for like every single person that's here, uh, working with us. And I,

03:20.840 --> 03:24.760
I think that shows, uh, to some extent and allows us to do what we do.

03:25.480 --> 03:29.480
But, uh, yeah, sometimes just flipping that switch and disconnecting at all can definitely

03:29.480 --> 03:35.240
be a thing. So this is the, this is the second office hours with Chris. Um, I just think I

03:35.240 --> 03:39.480
thought maybe from time to time I do this and answer some questions. So I'm doing this one

03:39.480 --> 03:45.080
live because why not? And we got the whole like IRC thing going and bite bitten has a question.

03:45.080 --> 03:51.800
He says, uh, what is an idea you really wanted to do, but we're not allowed to, well,

03:54.520 --> 03:59.240
so not allowed to is not really, I mean, I guess that depends on what you define as allowed,

03:59.240 --> 04:06.840
uh, not allowed to right now is I'm not able, there's not enough time in the day, uh, or there's

04:06.840 --> 04:12.520
not enough money. And that's essentially what, uh, doesn't enable me to do something that I want

04:12.520 --> 04:17.080
to do. Those, that's where my limitations are right now. And it turns out you run into those

04:17.080 --> 04:22.840
a lot. So I'll, I'll give you an example. Um, every guest you hear on the show, if I, if I had

04:22.840 --> 04:29.240
a magic wand and, um, an unlimited budget, I suppose I would do each one of those interviews

04:29.240 --> 04:34.600
in person. Any interview that you hear remotely, I would, I would love to be able to do in person.

04:34.600 --> 04:38.840
I wish I could, I wish I could visit the team more often. I wish I could spend a week at

04:38.840 --> 04:43.800
Cheez's location. I wish I could spend a week near Drew. I wish I could spend a week in London.

04:44.360 --> 04:48.760
Uh, I wish I could go down to Elle's community and, uh, just spend a time with her,

04:48.760 --> 04:54.360
just spend a little bit of time with her tribe. I, I really wish I could always be on the move

04:54.360 --> 05:01.000
constantly. Um, but budget constraints and the fact that I'm a human seem to be the limiting

05:01.000 --> 05:05.880
factor. Yeah. That can definitely limit, limit you, uh, just your ability to not clone yourself,

05:05.880 --> 05:13.000
not be able to clone yourself and be everywhere at once. Damn, damn body, you know? Yeah. Stupid

05:13.000 --> 05:23.000
bodies, stupid meat bags. Um, you know, for me, something I wasn't allowed to do. Um, have I ever

05:23.000 --> 05:28.200
said no too much? An idea. Well, I mean, for me, you know, well, I'm thinking like a little more

05:28.200 --> 05:34.040
broad than that, right? Like for me, um, I had an idea to throw a party at my house and my parents

05:34.040 --> 05:40.200
weren't there, but I wasn't allowed to. It doesn't mean I didn't do it anyway, but, you know, I'm

05:40.200 --> 05:46.520
just trying to reach here for, for some things that I was maybe not allowed to do. Oh, like an

05:46.520 --> 05:51.720
old story. Well, I mean, by its, by its question is a little vague, so I'm just trying to throw

05:51.720 --> 05:57.320
another side in there of it. I think the most like break the rules thing that I did is I drove

05:57.320 --> 06:02.520
a lot before I had my license. Yeah, but I mean, you didn't get caught, right? Not by a cop. I didn't

06:02.520 --> 06:09.560
get caught by my dad, but I never got caught by a cop, but I very early took to it to driving. Like

06:09.560 --> 06:16.760
I just, to me, it was something about it. I think, I think there are personality types that get a

06:16.760 --> 06:23.480
kind of soothing and exhilaration from driving that other personality types don't. And I think

06:23.480 --> 06:28.760
people that have their crap together better than me are the people that don't. Um, for me, driving

06:28.760 --> 06:37.560
is always a drive. It's always a drive. It's never just a drive. It's a drive. And so I, I want to

06:37.560 --> 06:43.240
enjoy the drive. I'm not doing it to just drive. I'm not, I don't want to go from point A to point

06:43.240 --> 06:49.320
B. I want, I want to enjoy the process. I want to every now and then have a thrill. I want to take a

06:49.320 --> 06:53.960
corner. I want to, I want to downshift when I'm, when I, when I'm slowing down. Like there's things

06:53.960 --> 07:01.960
I just, I want to do that keep me focused, that keep me aware, that keep me really kind of in the

07:01.960 --> 07:09.320
moment. And if it's a basic kind of boring, kind of just do nothing, sit there, twiddle your thumbs

07:09.320 --> 07:16.200
kind of drive. I get distracted and I feel like I'm not as safe as a driver, not a, not a safe

07:16.200 --> 07:22.040
driver and not a focused driver. Not that I've really ever had any problems, but I kind of feel

07:22.040 --> 07:27.080
like when I'm, when I'm pushing a little bit, when I'm experiencing the drive, I'm actually more

07:27.080 --> 07:34.440
dialed in. I'm more focused. Yeah. I mean, I could see that being, um, being in the, in the car for

07:34.440 --> 07:39.480
the drive for, uh, not really just to get from one destination to the other, but to actually enjoy the

07:39.480 --> 07:46.920
ride. It depends for me. Um, sometimes I do. And sometimes it's very much a, let me just get to

07:46.920 --> 07:53.080
where I need to be because there are too many idiots on the road. Have you, have you listened

07:53.080 --> 07:57.720
to the recent, uh, brunch with Brent? I know as we recorded, it just came out this morning. So

07:58.680 --> 08:04.600
yeah, there's something in there where Brent's talking about, um, how like you might go on a

08:04.600 --> 08:08.760
walk or something around your town, or maybe you have like a route you take when you drive,

08:08.760 --> 08:12.120
you know, you got like a, you're going to go to the stores, you take your, you figured out the

08:12.120 --> 08:16.680
most efficient route that has the least amounts of things that piss you off and you just get there

08:16.680 --> 08:23.720
right away. And that's great, except for a lot of times it means you don't just take the one street

08:23.720 --> 08:29.480
over. Oh, absolutely. For me, that's, that's definitely the case. I have a route that I take

08:29.480 --> 08:35.640
to the grocery store, which goes along the side of a feeder road next to interstate 10. Um, and then

08:35.640 --> 08:40.520
back up the other side of the feeder road when I could just get on the main street and go through

08:40.520 --> 08:47.720
town. But that requires me to sit at every stoplight and it's a little less of a drive, but

08:47.720 --> 08:55.160
sure. But you also, but I mean, there's something about living in an area and always taking the same

08:55.160 --> 09:01.800
route over and over again. And then one day just taking a slightly different route. Um, here where

09:01.800 --> 09:08.440
I'm at, I have three different routes I can take to get to the junkyard, which is what I affectionately

09:08.440 --> 09:16.280
call the barnyard that I parked the RV at. And, um, I always take the interstate, you know,

09:16.280 --> 09:24.360
the most basic straight 70 miles per hour route. But there is one route that is an old highway

09:24.360 --> 09:31.560
that was built before there were interstates. So it's, it's, um, it's a little retro, but it's

09:31.560 --> 09:37.640
beautiful. And it's like the perfect example when you're in the Pacific Northwest of each season,

09:37.640 --> 09:43.320
because you're driving through trees and you're driving through farmland and it's near the coast.

09:43.320 --> 09:49.400
So you really get the full flavor of the season and I never take it because it's another 15 minutes.

09:50.120 --> 09:56.360
Yeah. But I'm sure sometimes you want to take that route just because it is an extra 15 minutes. And

09:56.360 --> 10:00.680
maybe every now and then you want to work through something in your head, you know, as you're

10:00.680 --> 10:05.320
driving and like, like you said, you know, you, you gain a level of concentration on what you're

10:05.320 --> 10:14.040
doing, almost a precise level of focus that you can then take from that moment in time when you

10:14.040 --> 10:20.360
step out of your car to kind of carry that, but on a different topic. Yeah. For me, like a really

10:20.360 --> 10:25.240
good drive is like a really good shower. Like I have the same kind of shower thoughts in a,

10:25.240 --> 10:30.040
in a really good drive. Do you ever have that? Absolutely. Um, I think you have a little bit

10:30.040 --> 10:34.040
more of an advantage though, because you have the beautiful Pacific Northwest and all these super

10:34.040 --> 10:40.440
awesome windy, uh, roads that are worth driving where I literally have nothing but flat, flat

10:40.440 --> 10:45.400
roads around here. That's it. There's six different ways to get to the store, but they're all equally

10:45.400 --> 10:51.560
as flat and equally as straight. So yeah. Yeah. I've definitely noticed that in your neck of

10:51.560 --> 10:55.880
the woods. I've definitely noticed that down there. Uh, whereas like here it's like carved out of the

10:55.880 --> 11:00.360
sides of a hill and you get these switchbacks and these nice, you know, curves and yeah,

11:00.360 --> 11:04.920
you can downshift and kind of get into it and, you know, push out of the corners and stuff

11:04.920 --> 11:09.880
like that. We don't have that here, dude. Nothing at all. You know, all we have is a bunch of

11:09.880 --> 11:14.280
frustrated people on like a, you know, eight lane highway that are all trying to get somewhere

11:15.240 --> 11:20.040
way too quick while being preoccupied with a cell phone in their hand. Of course,

11:20.040 --> 11:25.560
you know, I have a little bit of a road envy after spending some time with Alex. Oh, I bet

11:25.560 --> 11:31.400
you guys did the dragon's tail and all that, man. That's great. Yeah. We, we, uh, uh, I,

11:31.400 --> 11:35.640
so, um, I recently, I mean, talk about an opportunity. I got to fly down to, uh,

11:35.640 --> 11:40.600
Raleigh, North Carolina, where Alex and his wonderful wife picked me up from the airport.

11:40.600 --> 11:47.080
Raleigh's has a RDU. That's the airport. Great, great size. It's, it's smaller than SeaTac,

11:47.080 --> 11:51.960
which is my local airport, but it's still like an international like hub. So you can get anywhere.

11:51.960 --> 11:58.680
It's cleaner than Boston. Oh, cleaner, simpler, everything. Nice. Everything. So Alex and his

11:58.680 --> 12:03.080
wonderful wife, they pick me up right there from the airport. They take me out. They get me some

12:03.080 --> 12:07.720
North Carolina barbecue the first night I'm in town. And then they have a guest room. They set

12:07.720 --> 12:15.560
me up in, which is fantastic because a it's a place to sleep and be Alex has gigabit internet.

12:15.560 --> 12:22.040
Oh, that's wonderful. Right. I can't complain about that. Um, and then he picked a route to

12:22.040 --> 12:27.560
get us down to Lexington, Kentucky, which is where a Wendell Wilson of level one Texas from,

12:28.120 --> 12:32.760
he had this, he had a route. I really appreciate this about Alex because he didn't check with me,

12:32.760 --> 12:37.480
but he, he knew me well enough to know that it's okay to take an extra hour or two here and there

12:37.480 --> 12:43.240
for a great drive, you know, for that scenic switchback drive. Yes. Yeah. He picked a few routes

12:43.240 --> 12:50.120
that were, were wonderful. Um, I don't think he'd mind if I share this story. There is the

12:50.120 --> 12:54.360
dragon's trail, which you just mentioned or dragons, uh, or it might be actually the tail

12:54.360 --> 12:58.440
of the dragon. I don't, I think that's what it technically is. I think it's technically the tail

12:58.440 --> 13:05.800
of the dragon. Yeah. It's, it's, um, it's a really well known road for, uh, just all the different

13:05.800 --> 13:10.600
like switchbacks, like you were saying and, and hills and turns and curves. Uh, it's, it's where

13:10.600 --> 13:16.200
bikers re they really try to get their credibility. And there's even a biker bar where there's a tree

13:16.200 --> 13:22.840
of shame where bikers that have tried to take the dragon's tail on have crashed. Ooh. And so they

13:22.840 --> 13:29.880
will go pick up some of the parts and hang it from the tree of shame. That's so sad. Well, so Alex,

13:29.880 --> 13:37.080
uh, Alex, Alex likes, Alex likes to drive and, uh, Alex has driven this road before.

13:37.080 --> 13:42.920
And, uh, I discovered things that I did not know were possible in a car. I thought you'd have to

13:42.920 --> 13:48.600
have a bike to do some of the things that Alex pulled off. Um, he is a, let me just say this,

13:48.600 --> 13:55.640
he is a great driver. And I had a thought in the evening after what was quite the experience,

13:55.640 --> 14:01.160
I reviewed back, like all of the moments where we were going around a curved corner or, or a switch

14:01.160 --> 14:06.680
back that was unbelievably tight, or we came right up on a crowd or all of these moments that happened

14:06.680 --> 14:11.000
while we were going down this road. And I thought back on all of them. I thought, you know, there

14:11.000 --> 14:14.360
was not a single moment where I thought, oh, this is going to be a problem. Yeah. Well, I would

14:14.360 --> 14:19.240
s-suspect that Alex would be a pretty good driver and I've ridden with him a few times. So, I mean,

14:19.240 --> 14:24.920
I know that he is a good driver. Um, and I know that he also has gone on the track a few times

14:24.920 --> 14:30.920
for some track days in some different vehicles. So, I mean, he's, he's definitely, uh, he's a

14:30.920 --> 14:39.480
really talented at that. But I wonder too, if because he learned to drive in the UK, uh, if he

14:39.480 --> 14:46.600
doesn't have a different, a different type of, uh, way of driving, driving style. I mean, every road

14:46.600 --> 14:51.560
there is tiny, right? Every road is right. One of those things where, yeah, you're going to have like

14:51.560 --> 14:55.800
a 90 left, you know, and you're just going to have to make it go in, you know, whatever,

14:55.800 --> 15:01.880
25 miles an hour. It was like he and I had the same exact programming for driving style.

15:03.000 --> 15:09.240
He drove exactly like I drive and I drive exactly like he drives. And what's also very funny about

15:09.240 --> 15:16.920
that is we both have the same car so we can swap driving and we are both completely comfortable.

15:16.920 --> 15:21.480
In fact, on a road trip with Alex, it's great because one morning I'm, I'm up early,

15:21.480 --> 15:25.640
I'm going out to the car, right? And I got all my luggage, right? And I got Alex's keys and I'm

15:25.640 --> 15:34.120
walking up to the car and I think to myself, how nice is it that I know exactly what buttons to

15:34.120 --> 15:40.920
push on this remote to open his trunk. I know where my bag fits. I know exactly what fits in

15:40.920 --> 15:47.560
the door cupboard. I know everything about this car. It's a zero stress situation for me. And so

15:47.560 --> 15:52.200
when we traded off driving, we both just, we have the same exact driving style and we have the same

15:52.200 --> 15:58.600
exact car. His is just a lot more powerful than mine because he, he bought a used a golf GTI

15:59.480 --> 16:06.280
that has a whole after a market or like intakes and souped up a little bit, different exhaust,

16:06.280 --> 16:13.560
different programming on the computer. Yeah. So it is, it is a lot more powerful,

16:13.560 --> 16:19.400
more powerful, but it is the same exact car. And so that was really cool because not only do we

16:19.400 --> 16:23.880
drive the same way, but we actually have the same car. So he's doing things and I'm like, oh,

16:23.880 --> 16:28.600
my car can do this. Oh, that's good to know. Well, and what's really cool about you guys

16:28.600 --> 16:34.440
having the same car is that like you said, you can anticipate the way the car is going to react,

16:34.440 --> 16:40.440
right? Let's say, let's say if you had had the charger that poppy and wimpy had whenever they

16:40.440 --> 16:45.480
came up for Linux Fest Northwest and that was your daily commuter and then you got behind the wheel

16:45.480 --> 16:51.080
of the GTI or vice versa, you know, you're behind, let's say Alex had a charger and you're behind

16:51.080 --> 16:56.680
that doing the tail of the dragon, maybe not realizing where you put down too much power,

16:56.680 --> 17:03.320
where you slide the, you know, the, the tail into the car out and you end up with parts on the the

17:03.320 --> 17:12.200
tree of shame. Sure. It's something. It is what I what I learned is that car cars and technology

17:12.200 --> 17:19.320
have advanced from what I understand cars are capable of. But, you know, it that was a great

17:19.320 --> 17:25.160
experience because it was a couple of days on the road with Alex. And we were just we were just

17:25.160 --> 17:29.880
talking about the show the whole time. You know, we got to go down and meet Wendell and saw his

17:29.880 --> 17:34.840
whole studio. We did the meetup in Lexington, which was awesome. And I kind of had a realization

17:34.840 --> 17:41.160
that I felt like this would probably be the show today that I would launch if I was just starting

17:41.160 --> 17:46.600
podcasting. Oh, yeah. I mean, I love, you know, before it was level one, it was Tech Syndicate,

17:46.600 --> 17:50.520
or Wendell was that was there with Tech Syndicate. And then now it's level one. But

17:50.520 --> 17:58.120
I've always been a huge fan of Wendell. And he's he's like a walking encyclopedia of hardware

17:58.120 --> 18:04.840
knowledge and really beyond that. But I mean, you could just ask that guy any question and he's

18:04.840 --> 18:08.040
going to have a response for you. And if he doesn't, he'll be like, well, let's go put it

18:08.040 --> 18:14.440
together and see what it does right now. Yeah, he's a he's a really neat dude. I'm pretty jealous

18:14.440 --> 18:18.840
that I didn't get a chance to go hang with you guys. But I have I have faith that maybe, you

18:18.840 --> 18:23.320
know, we can convince Wendell to come up during Linux Fest Northwest next year or something. That

18:23.320 --> 18:29.160
would be great. Yeah, it'd be cool if we could get him in a JB talk room. Just kind of, you know,

18:29.160 --> 18:35.320
going off on on what he's doing, even. That's a great differences in hardware. I think it would

18:35.320 --> 18:40.840
be cool to maybe rope him in there, too, because he's such a cool dude. And he seems like he'd be

18:40.840 --> 18:45.880
a really nice guy just to hang out with and have a drink and share a meal with, too. Yeah. Well,

18:45.880 --> 18:50.920
as we did. Yeah, it was really nice because he's even nicer than he seems on YouTube. And he's

18:50.920 --> 18:58.040
even smarter than he comes across on YouTube. And the other thing that I really respected about him

18:58.040 --> 19:05.320
after meeting him is he is he is really about craftsmanship, like what he focuses his attention

19:05.320 --> 19:11.480
on. He really he cares about the craftsmanship of the work. And boy, do I respect that because,

19:11.480 --> 19:16.840
you know, that's how the whole team is here. And like, I get that about him. And I think we'll

19:16.840 --> 19:20.760
probably work with him in the future. I think there's probably areas we can work in the future,

19:20.760 --> 19:26.840
because, you know, sometimes you meet you meet people online and they turn out to be kind of

19:27.720 --> 19:34.520
not really what they pitch themselves as to be online. You know, absolutely. He was the opposite.

19:34.520 --> 19:38.840
He was even better than he he claims to be online. Like he he backs it up with you. He's even more

19:38.840 --> 19:42.760
legitimate in person than he seems to be on YouTube. Well, that's that's good to know, man.

19:42.760 --> 19:49.160
I'm really excited about Self-Hosted. I think it's a great show. So much of my free time these days

19:49.160 --> 19:52.440
is spent working on these kinds of things. Like this last weekend,

19:54.120 --> 20:00.920
this last weekend, I set up a Raspberry Pi four in my RV on the land. And because, you know,

20:00.920 --> 20:05.240
in the RV, you want something low power. Absolutely. You might be running off of batteries

20:05.240 --> 20:10.440
sometime and you don't want something that makes a lot of fan noise because RVs are small and you

20:10.440 --> 20:16.520
can basically hear it everywhere in the RV when it's a loud noise. I figured that one out. I got

20:16.520 --> 20:22.200
a system one time I had a system in there. I had a QNAP NAS and it was like low fan noise. I'm like,

20:22.200 --> 20:28.600
great. Doesn't make much fan noise in my testing here in the studio. What I didn't appreciate was

20:28.600 --> 20:33.000
how much damn noise the hard drives just made. Oh, yeah. Whining sitting there spinning because

20:33.000 --> 20:38.600
they were spinning rust, right? So, yeah, noise is a big thing in the RV. Plus, you don't want to

20:38.600 --> 20:43.160
use up a bunch of power because you're often running off of battery when you're traveling.

20:43.160 --> 20:49.640
And so if you're if you're sending a bunch of power to some server systems, well, that's less

20:49.640 --> 20:57.560
power to run your television or your fridge or lights or heat. So it really is a big, big

20:57.560 --> 21:02.600
consideration. So something low power was important. And so the Raspberry Pi worked

21:02.600 --> 21:08.600
pretty well in that scenario. And I wasn't sure if the Pi four would be powerful enough to do

21:08.600 --> 21:15.080
everything I wanted to do. But so far, it's really gotten there. So over the weekend,

21:15.080 --> 21:19.480
I set up Home Assistant again for like the third time. But this time, I think I finally have the

21:19.480 --> 21:27.320
final setup. I set up Smokeping, which is super hard to set up as a standalone application. But

21:27.320 --> 21:33.240
if you put it in a Docker image, it's not so bad. You just go ahead like the Linux over I.O. guys

21:33.240 --> 21:38.520
have a Smokeping Docker image that really makes it easy. And that gives me great data on how my ISP

21:38.520 --> 21:44.280
is performing. Right. Right. I installed DD Client, which updates DNS when my IP changes.

21:44.280 --> 21:50.600
Duplicati, which backs up my Docker configurations to Google Drive and it's encrypted. Rantero or

21:52.760 --> 21:58.760
yeah, I think it's Rantero. I'm not sure how you say it. That's an offline Markdown based notes

21:58.760 --> 22:05.160
system. Yeah. And NetData, which gives you tons of great information all on the Raspberry Pi four,

22:05.720 --> 22:10.920
all on my LAN in the RV. So it's available whenever I'm offline, whenever I'm going down the

22:10.920 --> 22:17.160
road. And I'm considering Plex, too. You know, just setting all this up now, I'll talk about

22:17.160 --> 22:21.400
it more in self-hosted after I have some experience with all of these things. But these are the things

22:21.400 --> 22:26.840
that I just work on because I want to. It's just fun. So self-host is like a perfect show for me

22:26.840 --> 22:31.240
now. Oh, yeah. Well, and I think, you know, and I've mentioned this to you before, you know,

22:31.240 --> 22:37.800
inside the network before I ever mentioned it publicly, but it's very much kind of a throwback

22:37.800 --> 22:46.200
to some of the older J.B. shows in that we've done pretty good at getting the news right.

22:46.760 --> 22:54.520
But the one part is the projects and how to set it up and the knowledge of I've failed so many

22:54.520 --> 23:00.040
times doing it this way. I would suggest you try it this way, sort of project based show.

23:01.080 --> 23:05.720
And I think a lot of people are going to enjoy it. I know I've been privy to listen to the first

23:05.720 --> 23:13.080
couple already. I thoroughly enjoy them. I think, you know, with you, obviously, with that new Pi

23:13.080 --> 23:17.640
four and wrapping all this up, which I think is such a cool idea, because obviously, yeah,

23:17.640 --> 23:22.840
you do want a super low power machine in your RV. You want something that runs pretty silently

23:22.840 --> 23:28.200
because you are going to hear it if you're in the bathroom or, you know, at the other end of the RV

23:28.200 --> 23:34.680
or something like that. What I'm curious, though, is on the setup, are you running your Pi with a

23:34.680 --> 23:40.360
fan or in a case with a fan? Or are you just running it with heat sinks on it? I have not

23:40.360 --> 23:46.600
totally sure what my final solution is. But what my current solution is, is I have it running in the

23:46.600 --> 23:51.880
Pi four case that you get when you buy it as a desktop kit. But I left the I left the top off.

23:51.880 --> 23:57.160
I left the top off for cooling. Yeah, and that's what I do as well. Because once you close the top

23:57.160 --> 24:03.000
on that thing, it heats up quick. And that's just on my Pi three. Yeah, I can only imagine what that

24:03.000 --> 24:08.920
is on the Pi four, especially if you ran it, let it run with a load with it all closed up like that.

24:08.920 --> 24:13.160
I would not doubt that you would see some sort of a warping on the bottom of the case after,

24:13.720 --> 24:20.840
you know, a month's time running it hard like that. Yeah, a little brown spot or a little

24:20.840 --> 24:25.000
divot where, you know, it's heated up right underneath the CPU a little bit.

24:26.520 --> 24:31.560
And I'm a junkie when it comes to single board computers, man, I have so many around here.

24:31.560 --> 24:36.200
I don't really use them as much as I previously did, because I've, you know, kind of merged a lot

24:36.200 --> 24:44.520
of that stuff into the cloud. Really only because my home internet can be flaky at times. So I wanted

24:44.520 --> 24:50.440
something that was reliable whenever I was outside of my network. But now seeing you guys do all of

24:50.440 --> 24:56.600
this stuff with with Home Assistant and smoke ping, I've never used it sounds awesome. The offline

24:56.600 --> 25:01.880
markdown editor, that's freaking great, especially if I could sync that up later on. And it's just

25:01.880 --> 25:06.520
notes for like me and the wife about things about the RV or warranty information or service

25:06.520 --> 25:11.080
information list or whatever. Yeah, man, absolutely. You know, and then you can pull that note down on

25:11.080 --> 25:16.440
your phone and go to go to wherever go to the grocery store and, you know, tick those little

25:16.440 --> 25:21.400
boxes in your markdown and your offline markdown. I see how that would be super awesome.

25:22.840 --> 25:26.360
So that's been really cool. The other thing that I haven't cracked yet,

25:27.320 --> 25:32.200
is I feel like the Raspberry Pi four is kind of with Home Assistant, smoke ping and DD clients

25:32.200 --> 25:37.640
and duplicati and Ontario and net data and a little bit of plaques. I kind of feel like one

25:37.640 --> 25:43.480
Raspberry Pi four is probably maxed out because if any one of those goes crazy, then all of the

25:43.480 --> 25:51.560
other services suffer. So I'm thinking like, maybe when I want to do like really CPU intensive stuff

25:51.560 --> 25:57.080
in the future, I just I just add another pie. And it doesn't all have to be a pie for like,

25:57.080 --> 26:00.600
I'm thinking about Shinobi. And one of the things I want to do with Shinobi, which is a

26:01.320 --> 26:07.480
a CT a CCTV DVR type software. So if you have a bunch of cameras, and you don't want to have them

26:07.480 --> 26:12.040
store their footage in the cloud, you can use something like Shinobi to pull it all in and

26:12.040 --> 26:16.840
and give you a web UI to review and all that. And I feel like Shinobi would be perfect for

26:17.480 --> 26:23.000
three or four cameras in the RV that I don't I don't want to use up like a my fight connection

26:23.000 --> 26:27.560
to upload to a cloud storage, but I want to have something in case when we're parked somewhere,

26:27.560 --> 26:31.800
somebody breaks in and does something. I want to have something, but it probably needs a whole

26:31.800 --> 26:36.680
new pie, right? I think if you're putting plex on top of what you've already stacked on there,

26:36.680 --> 26:41.800
if you're expecting plex to do the transcoding and stuff, that's going to be a little bit of

26:41.800 --> 26:48.840
a struggle with the current stack and plex on top of that. But if you were to say, just toss in

26:48.840 --> 26:55.160
Shinobi on top of that, I think Shinobi would run fine on your current stack. Because it really is

26:55.160 --> 27:00.840
it doesn't have there's not a ton of overhead with it. And it just pulls in the RTSP streams.

27:00.840 --> 27:06.920
So you're really just kind of gatewaying your video through a web interface, right? So it's

27:06.920 --> 27:13.000
not like it's retranscoding. And, you know, you can start and stop recording there. I've personally

27:13.000 --> 27:19.880
set it up and had it running on a pie for about, well, since we started talking about talking about

27:19.880 --> 27:26.120
it, I guess it's been a month and a half or so ago, maybe two months now. And I've got two cameras,

27:26.120 --> 27:30.200
I've got a Fox cam running on it. And I've got one of the wise cams running on it. And I'm just

27:30.200 --> 27:34.920
pulling the RTSP streams in from that. Did you do that? So you did the custom firmware then on the

27:34.920 --> 27:40.680
wise cam? Yes. Yeah, I'm going to be talking about that in self hosted too. And that's it's super,

27:40.680 --> 27:45.960
super advisable to do that, in my opinion, because you don't really lose any functionality,

27:45.960 --> 27:52.680
which I think is important. So this is something I'll be talking about more. Because I also I think

27:52.680 --> 28:00.040
I want to connect my dash cam to Shinobi. That would be great, right? Why not? Well, and then

28:00.040 --> 28:06.280
realistically, if you're traveling down the road, you could have that stream being pushed to Shinobi.

28:06.280 --> 28:12.040
And then if Adia was in the back of the RV taking a nap. And you know, she could pull it up on her

28:12.040 --> 28:16.120
phone. You're right. Or if she's like chasing me in her car, if she's like, for some reason,

28:16.120 --> 28:20.280
we want to take like the RV, and sometimes she'll follow me in her car for going to somewhere nearby,

28:20.280 --> 28:24.120
right? She could pull it up. Absolutely. And then she could see what's going on in the dash cam while

28:24.120 --> 28:28.600
she's, you know, behind you in the chase vehicle or whatever. This is why I feel like self hosted

28:28.600 --> 28:32.280
would be the show I would launch today. But this is where really my mind's at. And what's so great

28:32.280 --> 28:38.760
about it is it leverages free software. And the stack that I'm using for this is often all like

28:38.760 --> 28:44.280
container based and the storages and ZFS or some other kind of like Linux open source stack that

28:44.280 --> 28:49.880
I have to use like it all is open source and free software and the Linux stack. But it's to do things

28:49.880 --> 28:56.920
that are just so freaking cool that you would normally pay the cloud provider XYZ to do and

28:56.920 --> 29:01.400
now you can do it yourself. Absolutely. And I think that's part of, for me, that's whenever

29:01.400 --> 29:09.160
I got into Linux that that level of experimentation and learning and getting really getting your hands

29:09.160 --> 29:16.760
dirty. And then, you know, obviously that evolves into, you know, these and configuring, you know,

29:16.760 --> 29:22.280
i3 or Xmonad or trying tiling managers or just using a context system like open box or something,

29:22.280 --> 29:29.720
you know, I mean, it kind of evolves. And for me now where I'm at are these self contained,

29:30.360 --> 29:37.800
isolated instances that I can spin up in no time and then take control of various little aspects

29:38.360 --> 29:44.280
of my day to day life. I don't really want to have my home automation in the cloud, right? I'm not

29:44.280 --> 29:53.240
really a lady tube echo user, right? No, you're not. And I don't have any intention on being one,

29:53.240 --> 30:01.240
but I still want to have some of the services and some of that ease of use in those conveniences,

30:01.240 --> 30:05.240
like being able to turn off my lights while I'm laying in bed because I forgot to turn off the

30:05.240 --> 30:11.240
lights in the kitchen, right? Home Assistant is so great, man. It's so great. It's even getting good

30:11.240 --> 30:16.440
spousal approval right now. Oh, really? Yeah, yeah. I gave her there's a home assistant iOS app that

30:16.440 --> 30:20.200
she has on her phone, so she pulls it up and all of the buttons are just right there. And we all

30:20.200 --> 30:24.920
know, you know, how extremely important that is that you get spousal approval on these things,

30:24.920 --> 30:29.640
because if you don't, your projects ain't going to live long. They're going to end up in the closet.

30:29.640 --> 30:36.760
All right. So we got to talk about headlines. I can't think of anything more ambitious that we've

30:36.760 --> 30:44.280
ever done to tell you the truth. A daily show, a daily show on our anniversary week, launching with

30:44.280 --> 30:51.480
another show. It's a wow. You know, it's, it's one of those things that since I've come on board,

30:51.480 --> 30:57.400
we've been talking about, and it's one of those things that before I came on board had been

30:57.400 --> 31:04.040
talked about. People don't, I don't think people understand the level of dedication

31:04.040 --> 31:10.600
and the workflows that you need in place to make something like that happen day in and day out.

31:11.560 --> 31:18.920
And just what it takes to even vet the stories before they ever go out. Right. It's a lot of

31:18.920 --> 31:24.600
work. Yeah. Yeah. I, uh, I'm really glad you're here because I think you're going to help me

31:24.600 --> 31:27.960
kind of catch a couple of things that I might forget because I'm so close to this

31:27.960 --> 31:34.360
that it's easy for me to forget some of the important parts about this because, uh, anybody

31:34.360 --> 31:41.080
that's a parent that's listening to this, I have three children and I, I would equate this to

31:41.080 --> 31:48.920
nearly the level of responsibility of birthing a new child. It is, it is a lifestyle change. It

31:48.920 --> 31:55.320
fundamentally changes every single day of your life, just like having a child does just not quite

31:55.320 --> 32:01.960
nearly, but after three kids, I can tell you very much close to it. Um, this is something that we

32:01.960 --> 32:09.160
have tried to crack for well over a year. It's something that I experimented with a couple of

32:09.160 --> 32:16.200
times at Tech Talk today. I experimented with Jupiter at night. Um, it's been something I have

32:16.200 --> 32:22.760
taken a lot of stabs at and I was beginning to think it would never happen. In fact, I was just

32:22.760 --> 32:28.600
reaching a peace with the idea that it would never happen. Even before the merger, we were

32:28.600 --> 32:34.920
trying to figure out a way to make this happen. And I, I just, we tried internal demos and we

32:34.920 --> 32:44.040
didn't like them and we killed them. But there was a little bit of a factor that I didn't account

32:44.040 --> 32:52.040
for earlier. And that is as the team came together over the last year, we realized that there was

32:52.040 --> 32:58.920
we realized we had a new advantage that we could leverage. We realized we had a new

33:00.920 --> 33:07.240
base, a foundation that we could take advantage of a group effort.

33:08.680 --> 33:17.720
In fact, we even brought a new team member on that is off air that is doing research and fact

33:17.720 --> 33:22.760
checking across not just the headline show, but all of the shows. We realized we could take a much

33:22.760 --> 33:32.200
more holistic approach to this. So we started talking about a team based approach to solving

33:32.200 --> 33:40.040
a daily podcast. And when we got there, we had our breakthrough. When we realized that you could

33:40.040 --> 33:45.640
get the information you need to move on with your day in three minutes or less. That's when

33:45.640 --> 33:53.160
everything changed. So the team effort and the format of how to pull it all off when those two

33:53.160 --> 34:00.920
things came together, that's when we had it. And I think by having someone that can focus on

34:00.920 --> 34:06.920
getting the news and doing the research, obviously that's, that's one thing, but having a team

34:06.920 --> 34:15.720
that really eats, breathes and sleeps Linux and open source all day, you know, and like I mentioned

34:15.720 --> 34:21.960
earlier, it's very much a seven day type of a job, but to some extent it doesn't feel that way

34:21.960 --> 34:28.120
because these are things that I would be doing anyway. But I think it gives us a way that we can

34:28.120 --> 34:34.520
get that news out there to people with Linux headlines, get it to them precisely and condensed

34:34.520 --> 34:42.440
with no analysis, no opinions given. This is the news. You know, another thing that we've really

34:42.440 --> 34:49.000
thought about too, is how to do something that isn't trying to like replicate what radio does,

34:49.000 --> 34:56.440
that isn't just trying to be imitating, but is actually something that is born of the medium

34:56.440 --> 35:03.320
for the medium. And so we have something now that is perfect for RSS distribution,

35:03.320 --> 35:09.080
but it also happens to work perfectly for those flash briefings in the lady tubes and something

35:09.080 --> 35:13.480
that is, it's, it's what you need to know, but it's, it's not anything more than that.

35:13.480 --> 35:17.400
And when you want further analysis, well, we have shows for that already that have been around for

35:17.400 --> 35:24.040
years now, they're established. So it's, it's allowing us to go into areas that maybe we didn't

35:24.040 --> 35:29.320
cover in the shows where everything needs to have a conversation around it. Brent has a question

35:29.320 --> 35:34.120
here. He says, how are you going to balance the daily versus emergencies happening? What are your

35:34.120 --> 35:39.880
details on backups? It seems impossible that you could record pre-record something like this. Yes,

35:39.880 --> 35:47.800
that's Brent of the Brunch with Brent fame. So one of the things that we, we worked out with the

35:48.440 --> 35:55.080
kind of practice sessions that we did is there's backups. So in some days we'll have different

35:55.080 --> 36:00.280
backups. Like if I need to take a day off, Joe could be a backup for me or cheese could be a

36:00.280 --> 36:04.920
backup for me or Wes on a, depending on what the day is. So we have a couple of hot backups

36:04.920 --> 36:11.000
that are available, but so here's how it works is our team member working with all of us that

36:11.000 --> 36:16.360
puts together the links, does a drop at a certain time, Pacific time. That has to be dropped at a

36:16.360 --> 36:19.400
certain time because that's what, that's our go time. So that way we can make it for the

36:19.400 --> 36:26.840
East coast commute. The host that is on point that day has to do a check-in. So they check in and say,

36:26.840 --> 36:32.920
yes, I'm here. They have 15 minutes to check in. If they don't check in, the backup automatically

36:32.920 --> 36:40.760
kicks in and the next host picks up and then checks in and begins working. And that system

36:40.760 --> 36:47.800
kind of gives us both, not only kind of a peace of mind that the show will go on, but also means

36:47.800 --> 36:52.360
that even if something comes up where the host can't pre-arrange an absence for whatever reason,

36:52.360 --> 36:58.680
maybe they're in a car accident, God forbid, or they've, they've somehow ended up on a flight

36:58.680 --> 37:03.400
that was delayed and they can't make it in time for their, for their airtime. We have a system

37:03.400 --> 37:09.640
where a host automatically will kick in, but while things are running just smoothly and everybody

37:09.640 --> 37:15.960
showing up on time and everything's great in the background, guys like cheese are practicing their

37:15.960 --> 37:22.760
reads and they're getting ready to jump in if somebody were not available. So cheese sees the

37:22.760 --> 37:27.560
headlines every single week or actually that's weird. I got to get used to that every single day.

37:27.560 --> 37:33.000
She sees the, I know every day he sees what comes in and he can do a practice read through on his

37:33.000 --> 37:40.600
own. So that way, if one day I got to step out, bacon's ready to go back up bacon. And I think

37:40.600 --> 37:46.200
that that's the way we have to operate with something like this, because obviously we don't

37:46.200 --> 37:51.880
want to let any of the listeners down. We want that to be there for them every single day and

37:51.880 --> 37:57.160
for them to be able to rely on that being there every day. This is I think the best way to accomplish

37:57.160 --> 38:02.120
that. And the thing is, is it's not a really an inconvenience for any of the backups. We're

38:02.120 --> 38:07.800
prepared for that to happen. And if it does, which inevitably it will at some point, we're ready to

38:07.800 --> 38:14.760
step in and test those processes. So I think it's going to be a win-win for everyone. I'm super

38:14.760 --> 38:21.800
excited about it. I get my news from it. A lot of the things that will be covered in those news

38:21.800 --> 38:28.360
topics, if they're worthy, we will definitely bring them into the additional shows for further

38:28.360 --> 38:34.840
analysis. That's how these things operate. So I think you'll see some crossover there,

38:34.840 --> 38:39.720
but you shouldn't get upset if we're maybe a little short with this one news story and don't

38:39.720 --> 38:44.840
mention exactly what you want, because chances are we're going to cover it later in the week,

38:44.840 --> 38:50.840
or deep dive into it, or release something on extras, or we know how important all these things

38:50.840 --> 38:54.360
are to everyone. And we want to make sure that we get that news out there. And we want to make sure

38:54.360 --> 38:59.960
that we get the important news to you factually correct every time. And I think that that's what

38:59.960 --> 39:08.520
we really strive to do. And if you look at us across just any other news broadcast, we really

39:08.520 --> 39:14.840
make an effort to be independent and not judgmental on this project, or that project, or the way that

39:14.840 --> 39:20.360
these things go. We're vetting everything through the team, right? So maybe I have a bias where I

39:20.360 --> 39:24.600
think the Librem 5 doesn't have a good shot, right? But there's other members on the team that do. And

39:24.600 --> 39:30.840
so everything is sort of hashed out. Okay, get ready for it. Crack one open. Here's a deep thought.

39:30.840 --> 39:39.320
You ready for this? Today's headlines, the ones that went out for September 11th, two stories in

39:39.320 --> 39:45.320
that headlines episode would never make it in any of our other shows. Absolutely. Because simply,

39:46.040 --> 39:53.480
the headline was the story. And so there's nothing to discuss. There's no community aspect to it.

39:53.480 --> 39:58.200
So it's not going to go on Linux unplugged. And there's no way that it really like changes the

39:58.200 --> 40:04.040
landscape forever. So it's not going in Linux action news. And those are generally like when

40:04.040 --> 40:08.840
something needs real discussion, you'll hear us talk about it. But things happen like there was a

40:08.840 --> 40:14.280
there was a new raw file editor for Linux like a professional grade. Yeah, raw therapy, a

40:14.280 --> 40:20.440
professional grade, raw photo editor to take raw files right off your camera SD card and edit them

40:20.440 --> 40:28.920
on Linux. That's great. Maybe one day it could possibly maybe potentially could be a pic, maybe

40:28.920 --> 40:36.120
right. Or if Brent does just an all Linux photography software show, that would probably be

40:36.120 --> 40:41.400
on there. And I've personally used raw therapy before. So I hadn't read that headline yet. But

40:41.400 --> 40:47.160
I whenever I listened to the headline show, I was like, Oh, sweet. That's cool. Good to know. I know

40:47.160 --> 40:50.600
it's, it's funny. It's pretty, it's pretty, it's pretty good in that way. Because there's things

40:50.600 --> 40:55.640
as a desktop Linux user or a Linux on the server user where you kind of need to know like when

40:55.640 --> 41:02.920
things change, but they're not newsworthy enough to make it into the other shows. I'm pretty

41:02.920 --> 41:10.440
surprised at how well that's worked so far. It's crazy to do it every day. Having, I guess, for me,

41:10.440 --> 41:15.880
that like the most the most like emotional baggage thing that I attached to this idea is I've done

41:15.880 --> 41:22.120
this myself with tech talk today and it ground me into the ground. And so now I've got a team behind

41:22.120 --> 41:28.120
me. And I feel like we've actually got something to it. So I'm feeling much better today. It was

41:28.120 --> 41:34.920
just a press we record, which is a September 11 2019. It was just approved on the Alexa flash

41:34.920 --> 41:40.360
briefing cancel. So people can get their flash briefing. Yeah, and that's and that's awesome.

41:40.360 --> 41:45.880
Because while I'd like I mentioned earlier, I don't have any echo devices in my house. I know

41:45.880 --> 41:50.120
plenty of people that do. And seriously, man, if I can get my Linux headlines while I'm brushing my

41:50.120 --> 41:54.280
teeth and combing my hair before I step out the door to go to work, and know whenever I get to

41:54.280 --> 41:59.080
work that I need a patch this box because this vulnerabilities out there in the wild or this,

42:00.520 --> 42:06.440
you know, particular piece of software has been updated. That's great news. And I can be the guy

42:06.440 --> 42:10.600
and I can be the guy that steps into the office makes that stuff happen before anyone else gets

42:10.600 --> 42:15.080
there and be like, Oh, yeah, these new things happen. I just put it into place. We're good.

42:15.080 --> 42:20.280
Can I get mad on you for a moment? Can I just zoom out? Yeah, who else could do it? Right?

42:20.280 --> 42:27.000
Reliably with a team behind it's doing fact checking editors. Like we have like three layers

42:27.000 --> 42:31.560
right now. And we're not going to get it perfect because on a daily show, mistakes will happen.

42:31.560 --> 42:36.680
Absolutely. I totally acknowledge that. But we have three layers of checking before it goes on

42:36.680 --> 42:41.720
air. Something's happened recently. It's a great example of how it just really gets screwed up.

42:42.680 --> 42:48.280
Manjaro announced that they're creating a corporation. Right. And if you get all of

42:48.280 --> 42:53.640
your Linux news from YouTube right now, you would be under the impression that they launched

42:53.640 --> 43:01.160
a nonprofit because the YouTubers are all copying each other and they're getting the details wrong.

43:01.160 --> 43:07.320
And they're reporting that Manjaro has launched a nonprofit, which is not the case. Manjaro has

43:07.320 --> 43:13.880
launched what is essentially in the US parlance, an LLC, and they are a very much for profit

43:13.880 --> 43:19.240
corporation. And Phil, one of the co-founders of Manjaro came on Linux Unplugged. And I talked

43:19.240 --> 43:24.120
with him specifically and he said, I want to make it really clear. We're a for profit company. We

43:24.120 --> 43:28.440
want to launch like hardware partnerships and swag. Like we have all these ideas. And by the way,

43:29.400 --> 43:35.000
if we're ever going to do a nonprofit, we have to do all of these business things first before we

43:35.000 --> 43:41.160
can even apply as a nonprofit. But all of the YouTubers now are reporting it as a nonprofit.

43:42.040 --> 43:46.360
I'm not saying we're going to we're going to screw things up all the time, but every now and then

43:46.360 --> 43:51.800
something might slip through. But my goodness, if we if we don't have at least three layers of fact

43:51.800 --> 43:57.960
checking on every single episode, plus we have a now deep network of direct contacts with people

43:57.960 --> 44:04.040
that are involved in the news where we can get just direct information from them, we're in a

44:04.040 --> 44:13.800
really good position. But additionally, the cost to do a daily podcast, I mean, it's got to be a

44:13.800 --> 44:21.880
$80,000, $90,000, $100,000 a year venture, I would imagine. And so I don't know who else could

44:21.880 --> 44:29.320
afford to do it. Yeah, it's definitely it takes a lot of time to do it. And like you said, if we

44:29.320 --> 44:33.800
want to do it right, you can do it. You can have somebody who's just like jumping on Twitch or

44:33.800 --> 44:38.040
whatever a live stream and they're just, you know, shucking and jiving and reading the headlines.

44:38.040 --> 44:44.360
That's a thing that can happen for free. Oh, yeah. Well, and like you said, it's one of those things

44:44.360 --> 44:51.480
when it comes to YouTube, there quite often is that echo chamber effect, where if one channel

44:51.480 --> 44:59.160
does it, the next channel does it, the next channel does it. And so, you know, at some point,

44:59.160 --> 45:07.240
you need to step back and I think reevaluate the way that the media you consume, the way that it's

45:07.240 --> 45:13.560
created for you and what the intentions behind it are. Absolutely. And we're not, obviously, you

45:13.560 --> 45:21.640
know, our anniversary with Linux Academy comes up tomorrow. They've been super cool. They've let us

45:21.640 --> 45:28.920
do what we do. They've done this for the community. We don't even have to talk about them, but we do

45:28.920 --> 45:36.280
because we believe in what they do. So that partnership is just wonderful to have and really

45:36.280 --> 45:44.280
gives us this ability to have a team that can do shows like this and bring you content like this

45:44.280 --> 45:51.240
reliably and hopefully as factual as it can be. I mean, obviously, we're all humans. The mistakes

45:51.240 --> 45:57.240
will be made. It's just a matter of when, but we're going to really try and make an effort to

45:57.240 --> 46:03.000
minimize those. And like Chris said, we're three layers deep on this thing. And we have the team

46:03.000 --> 46:08.680
that we have together now. I feel like we have someone that's been in a little bit of every

46:08.680 --> 46:15.000
different area in the Linux ecosystem and open source ecosystem. So if there's something I'm not

46:15.000 --> 46:22.440
really familiar with, you can guarantee someone else on the team is. And so that makes for being

46:22.440 --> 46:28.360
able to fact check within ourselves almost instant. Like, no, dude, you're wrong. Here's the

46:28.360 --> 46:34.280
documentation as to why you're wrong. This is the real scenario. And then you combine that with a

46:34.280 --> 46:39.400
very fortunate position after 13 plus years of doing this, we can just email a lot of individuals

46:39.400 --> 46:44.920
and just say, hey, this is what the team's suspecting is the case. Can you say yay or nay to

46:44.920 --> 46:51.640
this? And that combined with the news pipeline we already have for all of our existing shows,

46:52.680 --> 46:57.640
it really all was just really a matter of putting it all together and having a fresh perspective on

46:57.640 --> 47:02.360
it. I'm very excited about the future of Linux headlines, Linux headlines dot show. And I think

47:02.360 --> 47:07.320
self hosted is going to be maybe one of our next biggest shows self hosted dot show. The first

47:07.320 --> 47:12.120
episodes out September 12. And then the second episode with Wendell Wilson follows two weeks

47:12.120 --> 47:17.400
after that. That's tomorrow. I wonder I wonder how Alex has taken this right now. I wonder if he's a

47:17.400 --> 47:22.360
little nervous. He's pretty stoked. He's a little nervous. Yeah, he's traveling. You know, he so he

47:22.360 --> 47:26.120
does the open shift stuff for his day job with Red Hat. And so he's traveling right now. He's

47:26.120 --> 47:31.080
had a crisis. And he's, oh, man, I can't believe the first episode shipping while I'm traveling,

47:31.080 --> 47:34.840
he said to me. But I think everyone's going to enjoy it. I think it's going to be great. I know

47:34.840 --> 47:43.240
that I'm going to enjoy it. I'm friends with Alex before he was ever even considered to be a host

47:43.240 --> 47:49.000
on the network. Yeah. Yeah, man. I really like the guy. He's a super smart guy. And it's like every

47:49.000 --> 47:54.280
time I talk to him, he's like, dude, have you tried this? Have you looked into this? This is awesome.

47:54.280 --> 47:58.440
You should check it out. All you need to know about Alex is he's got a great dog. And the man

47:58.440 --> 48:04.040
knows how to drive. Yeah. He knows how to drive cheesy. All right. Should we get out of here?

48:05.160 --> 48:09.240
All right. That's office hours, Chris. That's it. If you got a question for me, email me,

48:09.240 --> 48:14.680
Chris at Jupiter broadcasting.com or at Chris Elias on the Twitter. And to answer your question,

48:15.400 --> 48:20.200
I believe Wes had the question. My favorite cheese is sharp cheddar. A classic one, right?

48:20.200 --> 48:25.400
It's a good one. Class. All right, girl. See you later. See ya.
