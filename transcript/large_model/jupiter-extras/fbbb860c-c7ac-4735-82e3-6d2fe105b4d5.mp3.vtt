00:00.000 --> 00:13.400
It's Tuesday. Hello, guys. Looking nice, Brent and Sharp. Welcome back. You weren't supposed

00:13.400 --> 00:14.840
to be here. What the hell are you still doing here?

00:14.840 --> 00:17.960
Well, come on. I can't miss another Tuesday, especially because you're wearing your robe.

00:17.960 --> 00:19.960
Yeah, well, I had to be comfortable.

00:19.960 --> 00:23.160
Wes is looking good right there. Although, sorry, Wes. Brent kicked you out of your spot.

00:23.160 --> 00:24.600
You know, he just came in here early.

00:24.600 --> 00:28.640
I know. Between Brent and Levi. I mean, I'm just sitting on the floor at this point.

00:28.640 --> 00:33.240
Yeah, space is a premium, you know, in a recording studio. It's just how it goes.

00:33.240 --> 00:36.800
We have just started the stream up on a Tuesday, just kind of hanging out when we normally

00:36.800 --> 00:41.520
be doing the unplugged program. And the Mumble Room is trickling in. So, if you'd like to

00:41.520 --> 00:48.440
join us in the Mumble Room, come on in. And the IRC room is also open at irc.geekshed.net

00:48.440 --> 00:53.200
pound Jupiter broadcasting or go to bit.ly slash Jupiter chat.

00:53.200 --> 00:56.240
We had some good blues playing earlier, but then Brent wrecked the whole thing because

00:56.240 --> 00:59.040
somebody gave him access to the mixer.

00:59.040 --> 01:05.160
Geez. That's my bad. I also told them about FreeBSD and we've seen how that's gone.

01:05.160 --> 01:12.520
Yeah, I know, right? I tell you what. I was talking to my co-host Mike yesterday on Coda

01:12.520 --> 01:16.720
Radio and I was saying, hey, you know, I noticed something weird is going on at Blizzard. They

01:16.720 --> 01:20.800
just fired like 40 people this morning. And I was like, oh, that's interesting. I wonder

01:20.800 --> 01:25.000
what's going on there, you know? And then this morning I wake up and there's news that

01:25.000 --> 01:33.720
Microsoft plans to acquire Blizzard for $68.7 billion in cash. That's at $95 a share. It's

01:33.720 --> 01:40.800
going to go down in financial quarter 2023. And of course, the stock's up 25% on Activision

01:40.800 --> 01:47.680
side. And Microsoft is kind of pitching this as with this acquisition, Microsoft is going

01:47.680 --> 01:54.320
to give the gift of Blizzard games to quote everyone across every device. So, Microsoft

01:54.320 --> 02:00.560
is going to give you the gift of more Blizzard games if you pay for their streaming service.

02:00.560 --> 02:03.840
This is another company that they've kind of scooped up.

02:03.840 --> 02:06.960
I think that feels like a pretty smart idea though. They're kind of buying a bunch of

02:06.960 --> 02:08.320
reputation, aren't they?

02:08.320 --> 02:16.280
Boy. I mean, some of the biggest games in my life, Starcraft, Diablo, those were Blizzard

02:16.280 --> 02:17.280
games.

02:17.280 --> 02:23.200
I'm kind of interested in how the, yeah, definitely. But I'm kind of interested in how the reputations

02:23.200 --> 02:26.720
align because, I mean, I don't think Activision Blizzard was anyone's current favorite in

02:26.720 --> 02:31.120
terms of, I mean, employee treatment, just their behavior over the past couple of years.

02:31.120 --> 02:34.320
And then of course, we know that many have mixed feelings about Microsoft already.

02:34.320 --> 02:39.280
Yeah, but you're right. Activision sort of dirtied the waters a little bit when they

02:39.280 --> 02:40.280
came in.

02:40.280 --> 02:41.280
Yeah, right.

02:41.280 --> 02:48.120
It says here that through the great teams and great technology, Microsoft and Activision

02:48.120 --> 02:57.480
Blizzard will empower players to enjoy the most immersive franchises like Halo and Warcraft.

02:57.480 --> 03:03.120
The CEO is out. So even though this is going to remain as a brand, the CEO is out.

03:03.120 --> 03:08.040
The people they fired seem to have been involved in perhaps some sexual harassment issues in

03:08.040 --> 03:12.940
the company. And so the question becomes, why were they not dealt with sooner?

03:12.940 --> 03:17.080
And it seems pretty obvious that as this deal went down, they're like, these people have

03:17.080 --> 03:21.920
to be dealt with before they're Microsoft employees. Deal with your stuff.

03:21.920 --> 03:27.080
And then the CEO tweets, yeah, I'm not going to stay on, but I will be totally an advisor,

03:27.080 --> 03:31.700
which is code for I'm going to fade away, but they give me because it's like it's part

03:31.700 --> 03:35.600
of the deal because they still want to have everyone to walk away from this deal with

03:35.600 --> 03:41.120
a smile and a safe face. They allow him to claim he's an advisor, but they're not going

03:41.120 --> 03:43.080
to take any advice from him.

03:43.080 --> 03:52.640
I just don't know. Do you see a lot of Microsoft games on the Steam store? I don't. I don't

03:52.640 --> 04:00.200
go out looking for them, but I have looked for Age of Empires and I just I guess I don't

04:00.200 --> 04:04.280
feel like this is a net good for Linux users.

04:04.280 --> 04:07.880
Because it's subscription only. Well, it's going to be the access to it. I think ultimately

04:07.880 --> 04:12.400
it's about pushing. Ultimately, it's about Xbox. I would totally say so. Yeah, it's about

04:12.400 --> 04:18.680
Xbox's. It's about Xbox's. It's about Xbox streaming service. And it's, you know, not

04:18.680 --> 04:25.080
intentionally, but it will have the net effect of also continuing to cement DirectX's dominance

04:25.080 --> 04:26.880
as Microsoft owns more of these shops.

04:26.880 --> 04:32.000
Like, do we know? We should look this up. They're probably seeing some of the movement

04:32.000 --> 04:36.360
and trying to hold on dearly to it. That's what I would imagine this motivation is.

04:36.360 --> 04:42.120
So this isn't the first time somebody's Google very quickly completes gaming company's

04:42.120 --> 04:49.800
Microsoft owns when you search for that. Not good. Oh, it looks like PC Gamer has an updated

04:49.800 --> 05:00.520
ongoing page that. Oh, my God. Really? So they own Zenimax, which owns id Software

05:00.520 --> 05:06.200
where Doom comes from. Right. They have Bethesda Studios. They have more studios than I've

05:06.200 --> 05:11.400
ever even seen the names of here. This list is massive, actually. So I'll name it by games

05:11.400 --> 05:16.160
that people might recognize. They own the they own the companies behind these games.

05:16.160 --> 05:26.720
Wolfenstein, Ghostwire, Fallout 3, 4 and Fallout 76, Elder Scrolls Online, Halo, we know,

05:26.720 --> 05:34.320
of course, Psychonauts, Broken Age, Wasteland, Bard's Tale, Minecraft, South Park, the Stick

05:34.320 --> 05:40.800
of Truth. OK, that's weird. Obviously, Gears of War, Frozen Motorsports, State of Decay

05:40.800 --> 05:43.760
and like I just mentioned, Age of Empires. And that's actually not even everything on

05:43.760 --> 05:47.880
the list. Those are just games I've heard of before. There's other ones on this list

05:47.880 --> 05:54.360
I haven't heard of. But Microsoft also owns. Those are they're like the Disney of game

05:54.360 --> 06:00.160
franchises, but I'm not a gaming expert by any means, but those all sound like pretty

06:00.160 --> 06:06.600
old titles to me. Like Wolfenstein, obviously. Yeah, but they sell those all sell. There

06:06.600 --> 06:10.120
seems to be a fair amount of I don't know if you should call it sentimentality or not,

06:10.120 --> 06:14.160
but yeah, right. Like some of these franchises have a lot of mindshare. And I mean, I can't

06:14.160 --> 06:18.800
speak for gamers really, because I am a casual gamer at best. But yeah, some of these titles,

06:18.800 --> 06:22.480
you know, like there's just a lot of emotional response to them. The other thing that strikes

06:22.480 --> 06:26.680
me is if these aren't on Steam, they're pretty much a nonstarter for the deck unless people

06:26.680 --> 06:31.620
put Windows on there. And you know, we kind of yeah, we kind of joke around about what

06:31.620 --> 06:35.360
happens if people buy a deck and put Windows on it. But when you look at the games that

06:35.360 --> 06:41.200
are really popular, I think only only I don't know, but I think only a small percentage

06:41.200 --> 06:45.720
of them or at least a not a complete chunk of them are on Steam anymore. Like they're

06:45.720 --> 06:50.100
on either the Microsoft Store or the Epic store or some, you know, Blizzard has their

06:50.100 --> 06:53.460
own thing. They're all on these independent platforms sort of like we're seeing happen

06:53.460 --> 06:59.180
with streaming services. We're seeing the same thing happen with these game stores.

06:59.180 --> 07:00.180
It's the same example.

07:00.180 --> 07:03.940
Are you now saying that Steam is cable?

07:03.940 --> 07:07.560
Seems like the ultimate cable bundle. And then these other streaming services are like

07:07.560 --> 07:12.240
the add ons that you got to everybody's everything's turned into cable television, hasn't it?

07:12.240 --> 07:14.560
Maybe it already was.

07:14.560 --> 07:20.140
All right. Well, so there you go. That's what's going on today. Microsoft became the Disney

07:20.140 --> 07:26.620
of video games and now owns all of the properties. But moving on, it is I was just commenting

07:26.620 --> 07:33.740
this to the guys before we started streaming. It is frickin impossible now. It is frickin

07:33.740 --> 07:38.880
impossible now to have any kind of tech news headlines that don't have a ton of crypto

07:38.880 --> 07:44.560
stories in them, cryptocurrency stories. And so yesterday, it seems, Crypto.com, which

07:44.560 --> 07:50.900
I was just talking to Wes about, halted withdrawals on their exchange and is forcing users to

07:50.900 --> 07:56.680
sign back in and reset their two factor authentication. Research shows that they lost forty six hundred

07:56.680 --> 08:04.960
Ethereum worth about 15 million dollars in a presumed hack. Yeah, Crypto.com, which just

08:04.960 --> 08:12.740
bought that stadium, which has Ben Affleck as a spokesperson. Crypto.com tweets, quote,

08:12.740 --> 08:16.800
we have a small number of users reporting suspicious activity on their accounts. We'll

08:16.800 --> 08:22.240
be pausing withdrawals shortly as our team is investigating. All funds are safe.

08:22.240 --> 08:24.760
What's a small number? Do they state that there?

08:24.760 --> 08:30.320
What is a small number? A thousand? Five thousand? What's a small number? I don't know.

08:30.320 --> 08:34.800
It's probably number times account balance. Right. That's how that's how support prioritizes

08:34.800 --> 08:35.800
it.

08:35.800 --> 08:42.760
I think the tell in this is that they're forcing users to reset their two factor. That is interesting.

08:42.760 --> 08:47.640
Also, it appears that some people did lose funds, but Crypto.com has already covered

08:47.640 --> 08:53.080
them and made them whole. And I guess that's kind of the upshot to these centralized wealthy

08:53.080 --> 08:58.920
exchanges is when they do have something like this happen now, crypto insurance. Yeah, they're

08:58.920 --> 09:03.440
basically covering it. And what's interesting is Crypto.com does have their own token called

09:03.440 --> 09:11.680
Crow and Crow's price was completely unaffected by this news, which if you were to rewind

09:11.680 --> 09:17.560
the clock a year ago and you had news about an exchange hack, the currency would tank.

09:17.560 --> 09:20.720
Yeah. Yeah. In fact, the whole crypto market might tank that day.

09:20.720 --> 09:23.600
So what gives? Why? Why not?

09:23.600 --> 09:27.780
I think because we haven't seen any of these hacks that aren't pretty quickly contained

09:27.780 --> 09:32.200
and covered. Like the companies seem to have processes in place where they identify the

09:32.200 --> 09:37.540
issue like the day of or around then they isolate it and then they cover everything

09:37.540 --> 09:40.880
and then they pay out bounties for the bug finders.

09:40.880 --> 09:46.720
But is it also suggesting that this is just regular everyday business? Like these hacks

09:46.720 --> 09:49.320
are just like just the way it's going to go?

09:49.320 --> 09:53.960
Well, the banking system definitely has normalized them. Like, you know, my wife called into

09:53.960 --> 09:59.160
Bank of America and gave them the wrong address accidentally because she'd forgot that she

09:59.160 --> 10:03.400
had still had it at her old business address and they locked her out of her account and

10:03.400 --> 10:08.020
they told her she can't do phone banking anymore. She has to go into a branch now because fraud

10:08.020 --> 10:14.760
is so rampant that they have to do these extreme measures. I worked at a small bank and 40

10:14.760 --> 10:20.340
branches and in our operations quote unquote department where we had people who are responsible

10:20.340 --> 10:24.820
for maintaining the ATM network and helping branches with logistics and stuff, we had

10:24.820 --> 10:31.560
an entire row of cubicles. So about 13 gals that just dealt all day long their entire

10:31.560 --> 10:39.320
workday with debit card fraud because the debit card fraud is so rampant that the banks

10:39.320 --> 10:43.980
don't even make a big deal about it. They just cover the cost because to them they've

10:43.980 --> 10:47.960
done the math and they've identified that if they set X amount of millions aside and

10:47.960 --> 10:52.640
they just cover the fraud costs and just let the system operate, everyone makes more money

10:52.640 --> 10:53.640
on the net.

10:53.640 --> 10:59.040
But is that cheaper than, I don't know, getting better technology around debit cards?

10:59.040 --> 11:02.840
They have decided it is. Yeah. I think in part because they're so constrained by regulatory

11:02.840 --> 11:07.920
movements so, you know, anything they invest into is a massive five-year process.

11:07.920 --> 11:11.880
I also think it sounds worse than it necessarily is. I think that's pretty common in a lot

11:11.880 --> 11:16.560
of businesses is you just make pragmatic trade-offs, right? Like it's kind of a benefit for us.

11:16.560 --> 11:19.120
Like I don't really worry about it too much. I mean, yes, like Hadid has had a really bad

11:19.120 --> 11:23.440
experience, but by and large I feel like, oh yeah, well you've set up, this is a normal

11:23.440 --> 11:26.600
part of your workflow, you're accustomed to dealing with it, even if I don't love how

11:26.600 --> 11:27.600
you deal with it.

11:27.600 --> 11:32.880
Yeah, I agree. I think it works until it doesn't. Like for example, if the fraud, you know,

11:32.880 --> 11:37.400
were to exponentially grow, obviously they would have to figure out something quick and

11:37.400 --> 11:41.920
probably wish they would have addressed it. Like I can imagine, you know, a situation

11:41.920 --> 11:46.320
where it's business as usual and that's fine and then all of a sudden it becomes kind of

11:46.320 --> 11:51.200
a big burden. And, you know, it seems like the right move would be to invest in something

11:51.200 --> 11:53.760
and build a system and I don't know.

11:53.760 --> 11:58.960
Yeah, I agree, Wes. It's kind of the same kind of thinking though that leads to how

11:58.960 --> 12:04.080
they plan for cybersecurity attacks where they kind of just do the math and figure out,

12:04.080 --> 12:09.520
well with insurance it's cheaper for us to take a breach and maybe we take a five million

12:09.520 --> 12:14.560
dollar drawdown, but, you know, we don't have to spend ten years investing five million

12:14.560 --> 12:19.480
dollars every year for a decade to get a system that's impenetrable. We'll just spend one

12:19.480 --> 12:24.280
time five million dollars and take the loss. And so they don't invest in their cybersecurity,

12:24.280 --> 12:27.900
but meanwhile they're fine financially and it does work out for them. The insurance pays

12:27.900 --> 12:32.520
out and they get to cry cyber victim, but all of their customers' information is just

12:32.520 --> 12:36.600
once again leaked. And, you know, everybody works out, it's fine for everybody except

12:36.600 --> 12:39.960
for the customer. And it kind of feels like that's what happens with these, this kind

12:39.960 --> 12:45.320
of banking system. Like everything was fine until one day my checking account got compromised

12:45.320 --> 12:48.400
and they shut it down immediately because they're constantly dealing with this kind

12:48.400 --> 12:53.040
of stuff. So now they've just codified sort of this one size fits all approach. They shut

12:53.040 --> 12:56.860
down my checking account. Well, the next day my credit card went to go clear and my credit

12:56.860 --> 13:02.080
card payment failed. So then my credit card company deemed me as delinquent and insufficient

13:02.080 --> 13:05.620
funds at both of those things, which both went on my credit report, which I'm still

13:05.620 --> 13:11.120
dealing with. And I kind of just stop and go, well, if they just built a better system

13:11.120 --> 13:15.000
that I thought I could rely on, but it turns out I was just getting lucky. If they just

13:15.000 --> 13:19.600
built a better system in the first place or switch to something superior as it came along,

13:19.600 --> 13:22.120
perhaps something like that wouldn't happen. And if that happens to me, it's probably happening

13:22.120 --> 13:23.120
on a larger scale.

13:23.120 --> 13:25.240
I think the question is, does that exist? And I think the good banks are doing both,

13:25.240 --> 13:29.520
right? Like you have to have insurance and you have to work on your security.

13:29.520 --> 13:34.760
That's pain throwing shade on my bank, but you're probably right. Oh, I hate your bank.

13:34.760 --> 13:42.040
Yeah, it's a really moment. It's really a factor of momentum, not out of selection.

13:42.040 --> 13:44.840
Partially because I've worked with someone who used to work in their security operations.

13:44.840 --> 13:50.120
Oh boy. I've been thinking about it. You know, I have been thinking about it. Speaking of

13:50.120 --> 13:54.760
maybe unbanking. How about this one? So there's a couple of crypto stories in here. Coinbase

13:54.760 --> 14:00.200
has partnered with MasterCard to let users pay with a credit card in its upcoming NFT

14:00.200 --> 14:01.200
marketplace.

14:01.200 --> 14:02.200
Of course.

14:02.200 --> 14:08.880
Just all pain points. Buying NFTs on a credit card, that sounds like the worst possible

14:08.880 --> 14:18.920
idea. The only possible upshot is that some sucker is willing to buy the NFT at a price

14:18.920 --> 14:23.640
that outpaces your interest rate and your payments on that credit card. But that seems

14:23.640 --> 14:28.960
like a long shot. Unless you could turn it around within a couple of days. I mean, you

14:28.960 --> 14:33.120
give that market three months and then nobody's going to be interested in your stupid ape.

14:33.120 --> 14:42.040
So could you imagine buying a bored ape picture on your credit card? I mean, I'm pretty bullish

14:42.040 --> 14:45.840
when it comes to a lot of crypto technologies. And I even think the concept of NFTs is going

14:45.840 --> 14:51.120
to be very useful. We're just seeing the very first ideas around it. But this doesn't seem

14:51.120 --> 14:57.400
like a great idea. Is it just to try to enable simpler transactions via credit cards? Yeah,

14:57.400 --> 15:03.480
for sure. But yeah, that's sort of it. I think if I was assuming I didn't want to spend cryptocurrency

15:03.480 --> 15:06.680
on it, or I was just getting into the space, I think that credit card is how I would buy

15:06.680 --> 15:12.020
it. That's how I buy almost everything in my life. And if it gets stolen, then the credit

15:12.020 --> 15:15.120
card has a little bit of insurance you can bank on. Yeah, maybe it's better than hooking

15:15.120 --> 15:18.720
up your bank details to your account. Hey, credit card, I'd really like to return this

15:18.720 --> 15:24.200
NFT. Right. I bought it on accident. Here's how you really leverage it. Somehow, maybe

15:24.200 --> 15:30.200
one day there'll be like a cryptocurrency perks credit card, right? So you buy with

15:30.200 --> 15:34.560
your credit card, and you get perks and points for buying the NFT. Like right now, I get

15:34.560 --> 15:39.080
points for buying gas. Well, don't you have that Coinbase card? Yeah, you could use the

15:39.080 --> 15:45.600
Coinbase card and make cryptocurrency on the transaction. That's true. Or there's some

15:45.600 --> 15:51.920
interesting stuff like M1 Finance has as you get like rebates if you shop at a company

15:51.920 --> 15:59.080
and you own some of their stock. Oh, that's interesting. Yeah. What a system. That's a

15:59.080 --> 16:04.640
definitely know your customer set a circle to get that working. But wow, huh. Okay,

16:04.640 --> 16:10.240
we got one last one last crypto story. These are all just taken from the tech feed headlines.

16:10.240 --> 16:17.940
We didn't go out and look for crypto stories. But this one's pretty shocking, I think. Intel

16:17.940 --> 16:26.280
has announced plans for a low voltage, energy efficient Bitcoin mining ASIC. They're gonna

16:26.280 --> 16:31.800
have a session on February 23rd to talk more about it. They call it the bonanza mine, an

16:31.800 --> 16:39.040
ultra low voltage energy efficient miner. They plan to go into direct competition in

16:39.040 --> 16:43.960
the Bitcoin mining ASIC space going up against Bitmain and Microbit. And of course, a lot

16:43.960 --> 16:50.720
of the Chinese manufacturers as well. And I guess the idea here is is make a little

16:50.720 --> 16:55.880
bit of money on this thing, you know, as especially as you really I think the beam out there is

16:55.880 --> 17:00.320
that people are using graphics cards to buying Bitcoin. But the reality is, nobody's been

17:00.320 --> 17:07.800
doing that for a while. It's all on these ASICs now. And so this would give US companies

17:07.800 --> 17:12.400
a US manufacturer to pick from, which I think is a really interesting development. But did

17:12.400 --> 17:17.580
you see this coming? Like, I thought Intel was too busy throwing shade at the M1 to actually

17:17.580 --> 17:21.040
have their head above water enough to see something like this.

17:21.040 --> 17:26.440
Well, it sounds like maybe they want in the game too. And that's just their way to get

17:26.440 --> 17:32.360
in. But it does sound like maybe it also addresses the energy issue that everybody's all up in

17:32.360 --> 17:38.040
arms about, you know, if they can put some real smart heads together to try to address

17:38.040 --> 17:39.040
that.

17:39.040 --> 17:43.080
Yeah, they also I think it, it plays into some of their stuff, you know, where they're

17:43.080 --> 17:48.560
farming out more their, you know, really next gen stuff to TSMC. And so maybe this is some

17:48.560 --> 17:52.080
of their attempt to, you know, diversify their fab business.

17:52.080 --> 17:57.200
Yeah. Let's go into the mumble room. Hello, mumble room. Hey, guys. How you doing?

17:57.200 --> 17:58.460
Hello, everyone.

17:58.460 --> 18:03.280
So would anyone in here buy, let's say this is never going to happen, but let's say Intel

18:03.280 --> 18:10.000
got the price point to $1,000. You could get like a NUC sized device. You plug it in, it's

18:10.000 --> 18:15.680
lower power and it just quietly mines Bitcoin at a slow rate. But, you know, interesting

18:15.680 --> 18:17.960
rate. Would you buy one?

18:17.960 --> 18:25.000
Now, here's the advantage of mining your own Bitcoin. Number one, you could join a pool

18:25.000 --> 18:30.680
so you could make smaller amounts when anyone else in the pool mines so that you could,

18:30.680 --> 18:34.240
you know, it's not just an all or nothing thing. You could have a lower power Bitcoin

18:34.240 --> 18:38.800
miner that still makes a nice little steady income. Secondly, you're offering security

18:38.800 --> 18:44.280
to the network. But third, a very interesting reason to mine your own Bitcoin is, is then

18:44.280 --> 18:49.620
it really has no traceability because when you buy from an exchange, an exchange knows

18:49.620 --> 18:53.580
who you are. When you buy a Bitcoin, they know the address that you bought. When you

18:53.580 --> 18:57.800
send it out of their exchange to your wallet, they know what address you sent it to. That's

18:57.800 --> 19:01.000
all available. That's all available to anybody that needs to audit that, that has the right

19:01.000 --> 19:06.560
to audit that. But when you mine a Bitcoin, there's no originating address. You are the

19:06.560 --> 19:11.600
originating spot. So it's your own private Bitcoin. So there's that advantage as well.

19:11.600 --> 19:15.720
Perhaps maybe you'd want to collect a few Satoshis that are original and untraceable

19:15.720 --> 19:21.080
for whatever means. So there could be another incentive to buy yourself a cheap little miner.

19:21.080 --> 19:25.440
Would anyone do it? The thing is Bitcoin for me, it's still a

19:25.440 --> 19:33.000
black box. But yeah, maybe. I don't know. Yeah. What about you, Wes? Would you buy one?

19:33.000 --> 19:38.680
We're at a thousand bucks. A thousand bucks. Hmm. You know, I could see it. I suppose it

19:38.680 --> 19:40.880
would depend on. Yeah. What's the operating cost?

19:40.880 --> 19:45.040
I think you dropped off Mike or something fell off there. Where'd you go? Come back.

19:45.040 --> 19:48.000
We can hear you a little bit, but you just got quiet. Yeah. What's the, what's the, I

19:48.000 --> 19:51.360
think what you said is what's the run cost. Yeah. What's the run cost. What's the like

19:51.360 --> 19:57.240
time to realistically perhaps see a net return. Yeah. I mean, it does kind of sound fun. It

19:57.240 --> 20:00.720
is interesting. I think what would happen more is that you'd have the data centers that

20:00.720 --> 20:05.040
are being built out with, you know, they'd be able to say, we're, we're, we're working

20:05.040 --> 20:09.520
with us companies. We're using us renewable energy, you know, that kind of thing. You

20:09.520 --> 20:14.360
could really see that being a branding thing. I think I would buy one if I could plug it

20:14.360 --> 20:19.200
in and at the same rate that I listen to podcasts, I can invest that back into those podcasts.

20:19.200 --> 20:23.200
So it's like a one to one. Wouldn't that be something I like the way you're thinking.

20:23.200 --> 20:27.880
Okay. Then the last little, Oh, go ahead. Somebody else wants to jump in. Yeah. I was

20:27.880 --> 20:35.840
just going to say that I would possibly, if it was, would do like alt coins. I don't know

20:35.840 --> 20:40.920
about just Bitcoin itself, but I mean, I would probably pick it up either way. I'm trying

20:40.920 --> 20:45.560
to get into crypto right now. So I have another question. Um, what else could this thing be

20:45.560 --> 20:52.560
good for? Or is it so purpose built? That's the thing about a six. Yeah. They're like,

20:52.560 --> 20:58.080
they're like application specific processors. Um, optimus gray in the chat room points out

20:58.080 --> 21:04.000
that if you could maybe have it pay itself off in a year, I wonder, I don't know. All

21:04.000 --> 21:09.240
of that said, I would be shocked. It'd be stupid. It'd be really stupid for them to

21:09.240 --> 21:16.600
get into a low cost mining with the exception of pools because the difficulty rate is at

21:16.600 --> 21:21.440
an all time high right now. And in two years, I think it is, I don't remember, but I think

21:21.440 --> 21:27.560
it's two years from, from about now, the distribution rate is going to half. They call it the having

21:27.560 --> 21:31.100
the halving or whatever they call it. But anyways, it's going to have, so rewards are

21:31.100 --> 21:37.360
going to drop down in half, same amount of mining work, half the amount of rewards. Um,

21:37.360 --> 21:44.280
so that's going to make the price, the operational cost to mine Bitcoin more higher. And so you

21:44.280 --> 21:48.320
got to imagine it's going to be even less appealing to average consumers and you're

21:48.320 --> 21:53.320
going to have more of these public companies that are now Bitcoin mining companies. And

21:53.320 --> 21:58.640
the really fascinating thing that's happening there is these Bitcoin mining companies are

21:58.640 --> 22:03.280
holding their Bitcoin a because they think the price is going to go up, but B because

22:03.280 --> 22:08.200
it's an equity that looks good on their balance sheet. And so it is attractive to investors

22:08.200 --> 22:15.360
to buy their stock if they're holding Bitcoins. It's like this weird proxy way for companies

22:15.360 --> 22:20.100
to get in on the Bitcoin action via the stock market without having to actually own Bitcoin.

22:20.100 --> 22:24.960
They just buy stocks in these mining companies that are holding their Bitcoin. And yeah,

22:24.960 --> 22:25.960
that's weird.

22:25.960 --> 22:29.200
Like people buy stocks and people, you know, when you, when gold is up, people buy gold

22:29.200 --> 22:34.440
mining stocks. Sure. Yep. And they don't have to hold the gold directly. Uh, and you know,

22:34.440 --> 22:38.520
it, it, it seems like a, it seems like a way for companies to get in on the action before

22:38.520 --> 22:42.720
they can own the pure asset directly without having to go through all the hoops that large

22:42.720 --> 22:47.000
companies already familiar with that system. Comfortable. Maybe. Yeah. Are we going to

22:47.000 --> 22:53.760
see a big push in the next, you know, before that drop happens to mine like crazy? I wonder

22:53.760 --> 22:59.440
maybe it seems like a huge incentive. Yeah, I will bet. They better get on it. Just about

22:59.440 --> 23:02.560
that time. China's going to realize what a mistake they made kicking all the miners out

23:02.560 --> 23:06.360
and they're going to be, they're going to be kicking themselves. So Apple shipped an

23:06.360 --> 23:13.900
estimated 22% of the global smartphones in Q4 of 2021. Uh, which is not bad, but it's

23:13.900 --> 23:22.080
down from 23% in Q4 of 2020 Samsung is following up. So Samsung is number two at 20% Yame at

23:22.080 --> 23:28.560
12% and Oppo at 9% with Vivo at 8%. And of course, when we think about these percentages,

23:28.560 --> 23:32.320
we got to remember the insane number in the absolute term. So even the, you know, that

23:32.320 --> 23:36.600
1% down difference ends up being a lot of millions of devices. I would imagine, right?

23:36.600 --> 23:42.280
I would have to think, but it makes the iPhone the most popular smartphone during the 2021

23:42.280 --> 23:48.680
holiday quarter, which is quite the feather in Apple's cap. Yeah. That's the thing you

23:48.680 --> 23:52.760
can, you know, tout around in your marketing PR. Yeah. I wouldn't, I would imagine looking

23:52.760 --> 23:59.120
up there on stage at some point and fluff their feathers about it. Uh, oh yeah. Oh yeah.

23:59.120 --> 24:01.480
This is the last story that I thought was interesting. They want to talk to you guys

24:01.480 --> 24:06.720
about, um, and this is by the way, I'm skipping, I'm skipping the other crypto stories. There

24:06.720 --> 24:11.920
are more crypto stories in the general, but I'm just, it's enough already. Um, variety

24:11.920 --> 24:18.840
is reporting amongst others that YouTube is winding down its YouTube originals program

24:18.840 --> 24:27.680
after six years of pouring money. I mean millions and millions and millions into this hole.

24:27.680 --> 24:31.620
They're shutting it down. They're only going to fund programs that are part of its black

24:31.620 --> 24:39.720
voices and YouTube kids funds program. Does anyone remember a YouTube original? I, I thought

24:39.720 --> 24:43.780
it was, you know, the first thing they did is they tried to, they really screwed it up.

24:43.780 --> 24:49.160
They launched it with celebrities that were not native to the YouTube platform. Oh yeah.

24:49.160 --> 24:53.480
Mistake number one. Yeah. And everybody's like, but I'm on YouTube to watch the YouTubers.

24:53.480 --> 24:58.720
And so it took them about two years and then they figured out, Oh, we'll work with the

24:58.720 --> 25:03.400
most popular YouTubers. So then, you know, like MKBHD and some of the others that I follow

25:03.400 --> 25:09.080
started doing these YouTube originals, but they just sucked. They just were like, why

25:09.080 --> 25:14.720
did they suck? Cause they were, um, they were like a low budget discovery program. Like

25:14.720 --> 25:18.280
if you remember good old discovery TV, when you could learn about something. Yeah. Uh,

25:18.280 --> 25:23.800
they were like that, but worse. And, um, you know, you go to watch sometimes YouTube to

25:23.800 --> 25:28.720
see somebody that's slightly unscripted and what you get is a very flat scripted version

25:28.720 --> 25:32.160
of a YouTuber. Cause there's a committee or something that's making sure that it's all

25:32.160 --> 25:37.320
scripted. There's a whole crew there cause they're spending millions on these shoots.

25:37.320 --> 25:43.440
And so it's a giant operation with an entire crew, you know, right producers, et cetera,

25:43.440 --> 25:49.160
which is the opposite of what made YouTube successful. And it's just the most basic misunderstanding

25:49.160 --> 25:52.360
of the very own platform. It shows you that the people in charge have no idea what they're

25:52.360 --> 25:56.960
doing and now they're shutting it down. And you know, they wanted it to be the big competitor.

25:56.960 --> 26:00.080
They thought they were, they actually thought they were going to have their own Netflix

26:00.080 --> 26:05.440
on their hands. They already do. Just it's different. They could have, they just won't

26:05.440 --> 26:10.880
recognize what they actually have right now. Yeah. And meanwhile we're like, just make

26:10.880 --> 26:13.640
the platform better. And you know, some of the things you could do is just roll back

26:13.640 --> 26:18.840
some of the changes you've made. You can just undo stuff. You don't even have to make new

26:18.840 --> 26:24.040
stuff and they can't get that right. It's so sad. Just sell YouTube and they'll be independent.

26:24.040 --> 26:30.080
I mean, wouldn't that be something? Wouldn't that be, although can you imagine Wes, the

26:30.080 --> 26:38.920
operational costs of running YouTube? I mean, it has some of the best streaming, um, resiliency

26:38.920 --> 26:43.320
out of any streaming service I use. Like I can watch a YouTube video in places I can't

26:43.320 --> 26:46.760
watch any other streaming service. Well, they've been doing it pretty much everybody else.

26:46.760 --> 26:51.040
Yeah, exactly. Yeah. You're both right. Yeah. It just works and they've been doing it for

26:51.040 --> 26:55.380
a long time. They've got all these partnerships. They've got a good client that's good at adapting

26:55.380 --> 27:00.800
to different bandwidth situations. And um, I also really appreciate the shortcuts that

27:00.800 --> 27:06.720
you can use keyboard shortcuts on the videos. I'm constantly shifting sort of time speeds

27:06.720 --> 27:12.160
and going back and forth, 10 seconds and that kind of stuff. I am always craving on other

27:12.160 --> 27:16.640
platforms and can never get. Oh, it really feels like Microsoft's looming large. You

27:16.640 --> 27:20.360
know, looking back at over these stories we just talked about, the one that really strikes

27:20.360 --> 27:25.480
me as like this is going to have a long term impact on us is these Microsoft game studio

27:25.480 --> 27:29.360
purchases. And it just seems like a massive headwind against the deck. I can't, I can't

27:29.360 --> 27:32.920
help but feel some any other way about it. And maybe I'm wrong. Maybe most of the Microsoft

27:32.920 --> 27:38.200
games are on steam, but the ones I've looked up aren't. I haven't done an exhaustive check,

27:38.200 --> 27:44.800
but I think you're going to be forced to, you know, buy this deck if you like, say Age

27:44.800 --> 27:50.080
of Empires, which is one of my all time favorite games. You guys ever play it? Oh, really?

27:50.080 --> 27:55.600
Oh, man. Wes, you ever play Age of Empires? Oh, yeah, definitely. I mean, it's been a

27:55.600 --> 28:03.120
long time now, but yeah, just a classic, you know, classic. What do they call it? But you

28:03.120 --> 28:08.560
built you build up a society and you it's an RTS. Yeah, it's a real time strategy. Exactly.

28:08.560 --> 28:13.760
And I used to play Stronghold a lot. I never really played Age of Empires a lot, but I

28:13.760 --> 28:17.960
love Stronghold. So it's a similar, very similar game. OK. Yeah. Well, they own that too. So

28:17.960 --> 28:24.160
we do. I think so. I think the studio that owns that. Yeah, I'm not positive. I don't

28:24.160 --> 28:28.280
keep it. I don't keep extensive track of this. But every time I glance over it, their list

28:28.280 --> 28:32.400
of studios and you know, because part of what happened is over the last decade, a lot of

28:32.400 --> 28:37.640
these gaming studios consolidated and then Microsoft came in and bought the company that

28:37.640 --> 28:41.520
owns three or four companies underneath it. So that's why they have a bunch of game titles

28:41.520 --> 28:46.680
that we don't even realize because they've they've bought these parent companies. And

28:46.680 --> 28:51.600
I wonder if we're not going to end up in a scenario where we've got these expensive decks

28:51.600 --> 28:56.480
with these incredible AMD GPUs and these impressive feats of engineering to get the drivers inside

28:56.480 --> 29:00.840
the kernel and everything working really great and hours and hours and hours and hours of

29:00.840 --> 29:04.960
valve engineer time trying to optimize the entire graphics pipeline and make everything

29:04.960 --> 29:08.900
as possible, get just the right screen, make sure, in fact, perhaps they even chose the

29:08.900 --> 29:14.080
plasma desktop because of some of the limitations in terms of refresh rate on the GNOME desktop.

29:14.080 --> 29:19.400
And then everybody ends up loading up streaming services to play games on a Microsoft server

29:19.400 --> 29:24.120
and it's just an H2 64 video stream to the deck. That's a really sad scenario and it's

29:24.120 --> 29:27.640
not going to be the only scenario, but it may end up being like.

29:27.640 --> 29:32.000
Honestly, if I were Microsoft, I'd publish the Xbox streaming service in the Steam store

29:32.000 --> 29:36.840
and just get done, get it over with and just let everybody use their thousand dollar deck

29:36.840 --> 29:41.440
or whatever it is as a streaming device. Here's the thing. If they actually did release like

29:41.440 --> 29:48.320
the the game pass for the Steam Deck and or Linux, I would actually subscribe to that

29:48.320 --> 29:53.360
because I would do I would do I used to subscribe to it back when I was on the Expo. And when

29:53.360 --> 29:59.320
I moved to PC, I just let it expire because I didn't really have a need for it anymore.

29:59.320 --> 30:04.080
But I would subscribe to it if they if it worked on Linux because I want more games

30:04.080 --> 30:08.760
on Linux. Yeah. The reality is, if you have the Internet connection for it, streaming

30:08.760 --> 30:15.600
games is a lot like the promise of the consoles. You just turn it on and it just works. Every

30:15.600 --> 30:20.600
time it's always updated. Yep. You know, and like with the GeForce now, they're there.

30:20.600 --> 30:24.200
They've already read the graphics cards, one revision since I've been a subscriber. So

30:24.200 --> 30:28.240
I just got an upgrade in my graphics. My only issue is until I had Starlink, I'd never

30:28.240 --> 30:32.080
had service good enough at home to use game streaming. Our buddy Alex, actually, before

30:32.080 --> 30:36.880
we just got on the air sent us a video. He just set up his Windows PC headless and he

30:36.880 --> 30:41.640
set up the NVIDIA streaming stuff and he's using Moonlight. Nice. Yeah. And it looks

30:41.640 --> 30:46.000
great. It looks so good. It looks like he's running it right there on his machine. Yeah.

30:46.000 --> 30:51.160
He's got a nice high speed plan. So it does kind of make me go, oh, be cool to have like

30:51.160 --> 30:56.160
a headless Windows box. But. I'm just not ready until you start having to administer

30:56.160 --> 31:01.400
it. Yeah. Well, and what I'd really want is the ability to stream like three games or

31:01.400 --> 31:05.120
four games. So, you know, me and the kids could play and then you're really talking

31:05.120 --> 31:10.760
about a beefy box. It'd be easier just to just to do the gaming streaming service. So.

31:10.760 --> 31:14.800
We'll see. I'm sure Microsoft is going to play. You can just pay Alex to set up your

31:14.800 --> 31:19.680
own custom, you know, hosting platform. Hey, Alex, come on over. We'll do it on. We'll

31:19.680 --> 31:25.040
do it on like a prox box and two GPU pass through. And yeah, exactly. Yeah. I think

31:25.040 --> 31:31.600
it's like I'm down. I'm smiling and I can't hear my smiling. I think you're down for it.

31:31.600 --> 31:39.160
I like it. I'm down for just pushing the envelope, I think. Well, there you go. There's the headlines.

31:39.160 --> 31:44.840
That's it for today. There's a lot going on today. Tuesdays, I guess. I guess. Yeah. Tuesday,

31:44.840 --> 31:49.040
actually, we've noticed. There's a lot of times when we move the show, we didn't want

31:49.040 --> 31:54.800
a lot of news to help us make the show. It made it too easy. Well, it does give a few

31:54.800 --> 31:59.280
days to digest the news. There is that come up with a good line on it. Because, you know,

31:59.280 --> 32:04.960
your instinct really a lot of times is to just go hot on the mic with your first take.

32:04.960 --> 32:10.400
But not always the best option. Sometimes it works out. But not always the best option.

32:10.400 --> 32:14.760
And I think sometime in the next decade, you might learn that lesson. Oh, this is interesting.

32:14.760 --> 32:21.160
Unrelated, I'm sure. Just saw this pop up. YouTube's global head of original programming,

32:21.160 --> 32:26.760
Susan Daniels, is leaving in March after seven years. Well, the original program has been

32:26.760 --> 32:31.080
going for eight years. Yeah. So not only are they shutting down the program, but she's

32:31.080 --> 32:37.880
out. Hmm. That wasn't in the first headline. That came out later. Funny how that works.

32:37.880 --> 32:44.360
Yeah. Huh. I guess that, you know, in a way is actually a healthy sign. I think there's

32:44.360 --> 32:48.080
not enough corporate accountability. When, you know, a corporate initiative like that

32:48.080 --> 32:52.160
fails, they really should be looking at why and make corrective actions. I mean, it sucks

32:52.160 --> 32:54.560
to see someone lose their job.

32:54.560 --> 32:59.280
And then I guess I hope, I hope that they're actually doing that and not just, you know,

32:59.280 --> 33:03.440
acts in this position and not questioning anything further about how it went on for

33:03.440 --> 33:09.800
so long, what the incentives internally were, etc. Not that I love Google, but like they

33:09.800 --> 33:12.920
own so many things that I kind of like and or use. It'd be nice to see them get their

33:12.920 --> 33:14.480
corporate house in order a little bit.

33:14.480 --> 33:20.880
Mm hmm. That's a good way to put it. Brent Lee. Yes, sir. Why don't you tell us about

33:20.880 --> 33:26.080
why you're still here? Why are you still here? Weren't you supposed to be home by now?

33:26.080 --> 33:32.960
Yes. So. Hmm. Where to start, Chris? I guess it's tricky. I did move my flight one time.

33:32.960 --> 33:37.560
Why did I do that again? Projects. And I stole your bag so that you couldn't leave. So that

33:37.560 --> 33:43.920
didn't help. That's true. So I was supposed to fly out yesterday. But it so turns out

33:43.920 --> 33:53.440
that Washington has this kind of unadvertised testing COVID testing shortage. Yeah. And

33:53.440 --> 33:57.880
not just like a kind of a shortage. So you got to go to the next place over like state

33:57.880 --> 34:03.260
wide shortage of code of COVID testing. Right. Right. To the point where like the Walgreens

34:03.260 --> 34:08.000
and the right aides are picking up the phone and saying, hey, you've reached Walgreens.

34:08.000 --> 34:12.920
We don't have any COVID tests. Can I how can I help you? The reason that's important to

34:12.920 --> 34:17.280
me is that to get back into my own country in Canada, I need one of these before I can

34:17.280 --> 34:21.480
get on a flight. And it has to be the PCR variety has to be the PCR one, which is the

34:21.480 --> 34:26.480
one that takes a few days. It can't just be the the quick test was OK to get into the

34:26.480 --> 34:33.000
US, but it's not OK to leave. So. It's been tricky to try to line up all the ducks in

34:33.000 --> 34:39.980
a row to try to get home, really. So I think Chris and Wes are conspiring and have something

34:39.980 --> 34:46.520
to do with this. But I had to. Job one was I kicked out the sunroof in the focus so you

34:46.520 --> 34:49.920
wouldn't have a car while you were here. So that way you'd be reliant upon us for all

34:49.920 --> 34:55.640
transportation. I get that. Yeah. Yeah. That was that was me thinking. I did that like

34:55.640 --> 35:00.520
a solid three weeks before you came down. And oh, yeah, the repair place just can't

35:00.520 --> 35:05.180
get the window despite the Volvo getting a new window in like a day or two. Yeah. Yeah.

35:05.180 --> 35:09.320
This has actually been an ongoing. We have been trying to get a new sunroof for our Ford

35:09.320 --> 35:15.040
Focus for a frickin month and a half. And it's just nobody will get us at the sunroof.

35:15.040 --> 35:19.440
Like nobody has it. They just it keeps never like your tests. They don't tell you. But

35:19.440 --> 35:24.280
then it turns out when you press them. Yeah, we can't get a hold of it. Could have said

35:24.280 --> 35:29.000
that in the first place. So you ended up you ended up having to go all the way down to

35:29.000 --> 35:36.360
the airport. Yeah. Wes was kind enough to after our Linux unplugged episode last week.

35:36.360 --> 35:40.160
Sunday I always think Sundays are last week, but that's like the first day of this week

35:40.160 --> 35:45.380
for some people. Right. I don't know why I think that. So anyway, Sunday, Wes was kind

35:45.380 --> 35:50.200
enough to let me stay at his place and try to figure all of this out. But was it ever

35:50.200 --> 35:57.980
a journey? The only testing place I could find and had yet to confirm had tests was

35:57.980 --> 36:02.500
at the airport. I figured, sure enough, they have a lab set up right at the airport. They're

36:02.500 --> 36:07.700
not going to want to run out of tests. Right. Yeah. Well, and people's entire like transportation

36:07.700 --> 36:12.440
plans hinge on these damn tests. That doesn't seem important to airlines or testing places

36:12.440 --> 36:20.820
at this point. But so Wes and I figured after much consulting and exploring of options that

36:20.820 --> 36:26.400
it would be best to just go there and to just assess the situation. And of course, they

36:26.400 --> 36:30.720
have a website and of course, you can book an appointment. But it's all over the place.

36:30.720 --> 36:36.720
Like there were no appointments until after my flight should have left. So I just figured,

36:36.720 --> 36:43.120
OK, well, there's no way I'm getting on this flight with what I require. So. I had to call

36:43.120 --> 36:51.440
the airline, but the wait times are crazy, like 50 minutes. So, Wes, you can certainly.

36:51.440 --> 36:54.480
You know how long I stayed on the phone and I got kicked off. Oh, my God. I mean, it must

36:54.480 --> 37:00.400
have been like six hours of total hold time. It was ridiculous. And holy crap. Yeah. The

37:00.400 --> 37:04.200
thing that was most frustrating is the last time I did this, which unfortunately was only

37:04.200 --> 37:08.320
a week ago, they had this cool system that everybody should have where they would just

37:08.320 --> 37:11.240
call you back and say, oh, OK, the wait time is going to be like an hour and a half. We'll

37:11.240 --> 37:16.680
just call you back. No problem. But that option never showed up this time. Of course, different

37:16.680 --> 37:21.520
phone tree, different number. Who knows that stuff? Well, and really, the other thing that

37:21.520 --> 37:27.200
is sort of ridiculous is when we were in Denver, you had to go through the same process and

37:27.200 --> 37:30.840
there was plenty of testing available at Denver. I could just show up at a Walgreens, do a

37:30.840 --> 37:37.720
drive through test and it was free. Yeah. But now as time has gone on, we've bungled

37:37.720 --> 37:41.320
the system up so badly that we have less test availability and they don't want to panic

37:41.320 --> 37:45.160
people. So they're not saying anything. Yeah. And the other thing is the cost. The only

37:45.160 --> 37:49.560
test I could find at the airport, which it turns out they could do a test and I got in

37:49.560 --> 37:57.760
yesterday somehow by some miracle, is 250 US dollars. You know, basically the price

37:57.760 --> 38:03.440
of your flight home. Basically the price of my flight home. Wow. Think about that. So

38:03.440 --> 38:09.080
I actually have COVID right now. Oh, I'm sorry, man. Oh, it's all good. Very, very mild symptoms.

38:09.080 --> 38:14.320
So not really worried about it. But I thought, you know, because I found out by taking one

38:14.320 --> 38:18.240
of those at home tests because I was feeling a little bit under the weather and it came

38:18.240 --> 38:25.200
back positive. Um, but I was, I thought for work I'd have to go get a PCR test. So I was

38:25.200 --> 38:30.700
looking everywhere for them, uh, try to find one and I can't, they're out everywhere. My,

38:30.700 --> 38:35.880
the closest appointment I could find would be next Friday or this like upcoming Friday.

38:35.880 --> 38:40.880
And I eventually called work and this was like, Hey, just FYI, I have COVID. I got it

38:40.880 --> 38:46.760
from an at home test. All right. Found out from the at home test. Um, but, uh, I can't

38:46.760 --> 38:50.320
find a PCR test anywhere. They're like, Oh, we actually accept the at home test. Now I'm

38:50.320 --> 38:58.080
like, what? Well, that's good. Yeah, it is. I'm glad about that. But I was like that,

38:58.080 --> 39:02.960
that information was never communicated to anyone. Of course not until, until it's an

39:02.960 --> 39:09.200
absolute, right? They need to find it. Right. Yeah. It's kind of weird because for the PCR

39:09.200 --> 39:12.640
test, you know, it takes several days. If you go through a lab to get these results

39:12.640 --> 39:19.280
unless you pay $250 and it only takes 60 minutes, but you know, so, but what's curious about

39:19.280 --> 39:24.240
that to me is, you know, I take the test 72 hours before I'm actually flying. So what's

39:24.240 --> 39:27.960
the guarantee that I didn't pick it up in those 72 hours? So, yeah, you could get sick

39:27.960 --> 39:31.280
while somebody comes over to the studio and then you had to, I mean, I was coughing all

39:31.280 --> 39:35.080
over you or I could even get sick while I'm waiting in line to get these tests because

39:35.080 --> 39:39.480
it's these giant lineup seems very likely that you would be exposed at the airport actually.

39:39.480 --> 39:45.320
Exactly. That's what I mean. They're not thinking through the whole system. And so it seems

39:45.320 --> 39:51.600
like it might be a better idea to take several quick tests, like maybe, you know, two days

39:51.600 --> 39:55.520
before you leave the day you leave or something like that. And then, and then you have more

39:55.520 --> 40:02.080
data points. I don't know why that's not a thing. Sounds cheaper. Well, you know, this

40:02.080 --> 40:05.880
whole thing just got off, just got started. So, you know, give us a couple of years and

40:05.880 --> 40:10.960
we'll have it figured out. Oh yeah. I know it takes time. You know, here would be like

40:10.960 --> 40:17.740
have the 72 hour one, right? And then maybe while you're waiting in line at the airport

40:17.740 --> 40:24.560
to actually take off, they have you do the Binax like the, the rapid or the essentially

40:24.560 --> 40:28.160
at home test to say, Hey, I don't have COVID right now.

40:28.160 --> 40:32.960
Hey, you know, I've been, these guys have heard me say it a dozen times, but I don't

40:32.960 --> 40:38.680
think I've actually said it on air. But if fricking Joe Rogan can rapid test every podcast

40:38.680 --> 40:42.960
guests for the last year and eight months, we should be able to rapid test ourselves

40:42.960 --> 40:48.200
before we get on an airplane. I mean, it just is so silly, right? You said that on the unfilter

40:48.200 --> 40:53.920
one. Yeah. Yeah. I'm filter, but nobody listens to that. So I can say it again. Um, so I want

40:53.920 --> 40:59.600
to get a new beverage and then, um, we were going to do an impromptu brunch on the air,

40:59.600 --> 41:04.920
right? We probably, uh, we probably have a couple of minutes while I refresh. So, um,

41:04.920 --> 41:08.520
we could slip in probably one more topic. Oh, what do you think? Anything else? Any

41:08.520 --> 41:11.880
other? So yeah, basically you had to delay the flight. So that way you had time for the

41:11.880 --> 41:16.160
testing to clear, which means I get to work on a few other projects. That's true. It was

41:16.160 --> 41:21.100
really fun. So many projects. Were you impressed West when you came over and saw the state

41:21.100 --> 41:25.180
of the bathroom? Holy crap. Yeah. I can see why we're trying to trap Brent here because

41:25.180 --> 41:28.420
I mean, we can just get so much more done. I know. Imagine what I could get them to do

41:28.420 --> 41:33.800
for the RV, right? You know, one thing I discovered at West's place, cause I had the chance to

41:33.800 --> 41:39.240
stay over, which is always a great thing. West, your shower is plumbed incorrectly.

41:39.240 --> 41:46.960
Oh, the hot water and the cold water is backwards. It's a ridiculous thing. Um, I grew up in

41:46.960 --> 41:53.160
a shower like that. So it's kind of normal for me. Well, I didn't even notice. I cranked

41:53.160 --> 41:57.160
it to like, Oh yeah. Most checks, cause as you might imagine with travel, you know, most

41:57.160 --> 42:02.440
checks, I have an average of where most places. That's okay. That's a good way to put it.

42:02.440 --> 42:05.560
But I'm like, okay, a good place to start is like the three quarter mark. Cause it's

42:05.560 --> 42:09.160
generally not scalding, but if it's a little too cold, then at least he got the hot water

42:09.160 --> 42:13.360
kind of coming through. I did that at your place and thankfully I tested the water before

42:13.360 --> 42:19.280
getting in, which I don't usually do. And it was frigid. So I quickly sort of had to

42:19.280 --> 42:24.120
figure that out. I don't actually know. I'll have to warn future guests. Yeah. Right. Make

42:24.120 --> 42:28.720
a nice little sign with. The other thing is you have a lovely washroom. It's got this

42:28.720 --> 42:34.320
skylight with like daylight coming in, which is my such a luxurious way to do it. But your

42:34.320 --> 42:39.120
shower curtain, there's just a man staring at me the entire time I'm in there. Why does

42:39.120 --> 42:44.120
he have as a shower? Are you not used to that? What does he have? What does he have as a

42:44.120 --> 42:49.320
shower curtain? What is it? Is it, uh, what's the gentleman's name? Oh, he's got, he's got

42:49.320 --> 42:56.320
this hilarious Jeff Goldblum. Jeff Goldblum is like there with an ape and he's got his

42:56.320 --> 43:01.680
arm around an ape or something. And it's just see-through enough that you can also see Jeff

43:01.680 --> 43:09.520
Goldblum's, you know, mug while you're trying to take showers. So anyways, it ended up being

43:09.520 --> 43:17.400
a great experience. I'll post a link in the IRC for anyone curious. I mean, if you got

43:17.400 --> 43:21.120
a stare at something, right? Like I'd rather that than boring old color. Oh, it made me

43:21.120 --> 43:29.160
smile. So there's something to that. Um, did you ever see the, um, Jeff Goldblum had a

43:29.160 --> 43:35.080
show for a while? Um, and one episode I watched, yeah, I'd like to watch more. One of them

43:35.080 --> 43:40.560
was all about shoes and he, you know, he's got this way, but it was a fascinating exploration

43:40.560 --> 43:45.420
into the world of high-end shoes. And then I think that may have been the only episode

43:45.420 --> 43:51.040
I saw. But, um, if anyone's interested, I say dive right in. It was, it was really well

43:51.040 --> 43:57.160
produced and super funny and like kind of quirky and awkward in the way that I think

43:57.160 --> 44:02.320
most of us in this community either are like or love or have come to appreciate. So it

44:02.320 --> 44:03.320
was really nice.

44:03.320 --> 44:09.160
It's nice when he's like, um, it's always nice to see genuine curiosity and excitement

44:09.160 --> 44:13.000
about stuff, you know, and he can portray that pretty well, I think.

44:13.000 --> 44:17.400
I completely agree with that. And yet he's okay to say when he doesn't know something,

44:17.400 --> 44:18.400
which is really important.

44:18.400 --> 44:22.240
Mm-hmm. Yeah. That's the other part, right? That being, uh, being cool enough in your

44:22.240 --> 44:25.000
own skin to be like, nope, no idea what's going on with that.

44:25.000 --> 44:30.320
My frog is out today. I tell you what it is out and about, uh, we have a studio frog and

44:30.320 --> 44:34.180
he is all over the place. You know, this has been a lot of fun. We should just make this

44:34.180 --> 44:46.440
a podcast. Wouldn't this, let's just figure out how to turn this into a podcast.
