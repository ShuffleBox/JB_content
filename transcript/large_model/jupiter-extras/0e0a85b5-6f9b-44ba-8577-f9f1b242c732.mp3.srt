1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,600
Well, hello, everyone. This is Brunch with Brent. I'm Brent Jerva. And joining me today

2
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:18,360
is Sri Ramakrishna. Sri, thanks for joining me today.

3
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:19,360
Thank you.

4
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:25,120
Sri, some people will know you, well, you've been around for quite some time, I would say.

5
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:30,400
Some will know you for being quite involved with the Gnome community. How long has that

6
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:34,480
been since you've been involved with the Gnome community? I think it's been a little while,

7
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:35,480
right?

8
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:42,840
I believe I started in 1998. I'm definitely what they would call the part of the old parts

9
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:47,600
club. Affectionately so.

10
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:53,680
How has that felt to be, well, called that, but also you, one of the things I'm excited

11
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:57,800
to dive into is the perspective that you must have gained throughout that time, you know,

12
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:02,880
as things kind of shift and move in both the open source community, the Linux community

13
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:07,240
and everything surrounding that. So I would imagine you've seen some changes there.

14
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:13,520
Oh, yeah, I've seen a lot of changes over time, especially in the Gnome project and

15
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:22,920
of course, in the open source sector externally. Yeah. Plenty of things have changed.

16
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:27,200
What's something that kind of sticks out for you as either maybe something positive that's

17
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,200
kind of shifted?

18
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:36,800
At least in the desktop, or I guess I'm going to relabel that as the apps community. We've

19
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:46,640
gotten further refined in our engineering. And I think we have this idea that we have

20
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:52,800
to work much closer with the rest of the other open source communities out there. And I know

21
00:01:52,800 --> 00:02:01,520
in my personal endeavors, it's about building that relationship with the rest of open source,

22
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:10,400
the other desktop projects, all of that, because only as a singular community, I think, can

23
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:13,520
we get where we want to go.

24
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:19,520
And how would you describe then where we want to go? That's a tricky question, I would imagine.

25
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:29,360
Well, every project has their own path of where they want to go. But I think we could

26
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:39,000
all agree that we would like to increase our share of the market. And there's a lot of

27
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:45,520
great things that comes from that. With the greater share of the market, especially in

28
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:52,680
consumer space, we actually get to drive contributions in the other ecosystems, right? So if everybody's

29
00:02:52,680 --> 00:03:00,440
using a open source or free software desktop, that means consumer hardware is going to also

30
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:06,360
be forced to support those desktops, which means that good support in drivers needs to

31
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:12,440
happen in the Linux kernel. And in the past, we've always had a fairly close relationship

32
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:22,200
with the kernel people, especially during the GNOME 2 days or the KDE 3 days, because

33
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:28,600
that was the bulk of the engineering that was happening, right? In order to support

34
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:34,400
things like hardware detection or hot, hot pluggable devices, we had to engineer them

35
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,600
because it wasn't there previously.

36
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:42,880
And those are things we just take for granted these days. That kind of stuff is essential

37
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:48,800
for any of us using the software that we do now. But a lot of people put a lot of hard

38
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:54,800
work into making that possible. It sounds like collaboration was key to doing that.

39
00:03:54,800 --> 00:04:03,400
Yes, absolutely. We were working with each other quite early in the period. And one of

40
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:09,360
the changes going back to your question about what's happening in the open source field

41
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:17,720
is I think a lot of companies have been building communities, initially as silos, but to go

42
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:24,920
further, they need to start interacting with the rest, right? That is where you become

43
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:32,400
more powerful. So if you're building a config manager system, then you want to work closely

44
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:36,800
with the Kubernetes community, or you want to work with the open stack community, right?

45
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:43,040
So it's not just like using config management to do bare metal. Now you want to be working

46
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:50,560
with the cloud projects, right? So just as a corporate level open source example, in

47
00:04:50,560 --> 00:05:01,480
the same spirit, in the apps community, we want to be working together as well to build

48
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:08,520
these various standards with each other so that we can present ourselves as a singular

49
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:09,720
community as well.

50
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:16,000
You described there some early kind of collaborations. And of course, those have been happening throughout

51
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,680
the history of Linux. That's sort of the spirit of what's making all this possible and the

52
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:25,920
reason many of us are here. But do you think it's a bit of a misunderstanding then that

53
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:33,640
there are these sort of silos around certain software or communities that maybe those who

54
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:38,720
are involved deeply in the software and the hardware there are actually interacting in

55
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:44,900
the background, but that's not sort of seen by end users necessarily. And I'm thinking

56
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:51,880
to the, you know, sort of Reddit users that we all sort of despise and things like that.

57
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:55,920
So do you think there's a disconnect there between what people believe and what's actually

58
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:56,920
happening?

59
00:05:56,920 --> 00:06:04,400
So I'll make a comment about the Reddit community, which I don't want to characterize that as

60
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:12,520
being despised. But there is a high amount of tribalism that occurs in forums, right?

61
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:22,380
So Reddit or Slash That or any of these others, they think these projects that they're a part

62
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:30,880
of or they use are in contention with the others, right? So we're not really like that.

63
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:36,960
I think for the most part, we've sort of stayed in our own kind of corners, but only in the

64
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:44,800
past, I would say a year and a half or so, we've been connecting on different initiatives

65
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:56,280
that I think has spurred further collaboration. So the Linux App Summit is one. We're doing

66
00:06:56,280 --> 00:07:02,800
some things with community metrics. Some of those things are things I could talk about,

67
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:11,040
because I'm part of those projects and I'm working with the other communities for that.

68
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:21,040
In the background, we're still working with each other and there's not contention.

69
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:25,600
You called yourself sort of one of the old guys in the community, but it seems to me

70
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:31,120
like the value of long term relationships with anyone who's working on some of these

71
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:36,160
projects means that as things evolve, as the technology evolves, as the people evolve and

72
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:41,160
where your interests evolve as well, means that you have all these connections everywhere

73
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:47,160
that you can sort of build off of. So the tribalism that you sort of described is not

74
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:53,240
really useful because you may end up in the other tribe or quote unquote tribe at any

75
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:59,700
point. So it doesn't really make sense to put up some walls. And it seems to me from

76
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:05,360
what I know of you that lots of your work has been focused on breaking down those walls

77
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,520
or at least putting connections between them all.

78
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:15,080
That's right. It's interesting that this is sort of what I do for a living is to build

79
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:21,480
relationships with ecosystems and so forth.

80
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:26,280
And so that gets me thinking about, you know, you mentioned the Linux App Summit and that

81
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:31,480
was a bit of an idea of yours that has evolved and become quite an amazing thing. Can you

82
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:33,280
can you run us through that a little bit?

83
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:42,200
You know, I came up with the idea like five, six years ago that I saw that we've come to

84
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:50,400
a point technologically because we have ubiquitous applications as a technology, right? So you

85
00:08:50,400 --> 00:09:01,040
have your snaps or snap craft, you have flat pack and we now have the kind of ability to

86
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:08,280
change how applications are distributed, right? Based on a runtime of some sort. So we're

87
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:14,560
taking all the ideas from the containers that's been that's grown so popular and applied that

88
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:24,380
in the desktop. And I realized that this is something that we could take advantage of

89
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:30,400
because it's sort of like using a distribution centric model, we can do a more app centric

90
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:37,280
model. And the difference is that you could scale that, right? An app centric model is

91
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:42,960
kind of what the Windows and the app and macOS world is. If you use packaging, you know,

92
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:49,880
everything goes through this process of packaging and a distro. But the complexity involved

93
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:55,480
of building an application on Linux is so much more. And a lot of times you're not even

94
00:09:55,480 --> 00:10:04,560
in control of your own distribution. But in a flat pack snap world or ubiquitous app world,

95
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:12,760
we could build an application market. So I had presented that idea with the Gnome Foundation

96
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:19,300
board and I said, this is a great idea. Let's do this. Now, I spoke from a bit of ignorance

97
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:25,280
because I've never put on a conference before. Sometimes that's a good thing. I had told

98
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:34,400
them, oh, yeah, it won't cost us any money. And to do this conference required me to learn

99
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:41,280
a whole set of new skills. A lot of it around marketing, a lot about fundraising and be

100
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:49,160
able to put something conceptual that people can digest. And the first one was quite a

101
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:59,840
test of those abilities. But over time, we're getting better. And the people who came together

102
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:05,640
to build that team were just simply amazing people. And it's great that I get to keep

103
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:13,680
working with them every year. But yes, the first one was very exhausting because everything

104
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:20,480
is done new. Your concepts are new. You have to explain to people what this concept on

105
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:28,560
before it starts catching hold. And the next iteration is better. And then the third iteration,

106
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:34,720
now there's more people joining. It's getting more diverse. There are more stakeholders.

107
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:40,160
And so I think the best part is that we're able to keep expanding on this concept. And

108
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:47,240
I think people really get it now. And now that four years have passed that apps is important.

109
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:54,360
How does it feel now considering you had a vision four years ago? But does it feel like

110
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:58,820
four years is a long time for people to start getting it? And obviously, there were some

111
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:03,360
early adopters. But do you feel like you've reached your goal? Maybe that's another way

112
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:11,920
of putting it. We haven't reached it yet. But it's getting there. I told you about solidification

113
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:18,160
and everything else. But this is a great vehicle to bring us closer to the other ecosystems,

114
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:28,600
to the other projects. Because apps are not just desktop apps. When we say apps, we're

115
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:35,560
talking about an application that runs on the Linux platform. And that also means it

116
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:40,920
could be any applications. It could be your Kubernetes application. I don't know. But

117
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:50,200
we're not trying to make it very specific. So this allows us to reach out to other communities

118
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:53,880
around the concept of applications.

119
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:58,840
And one real success that came from the Linux App Summit, and it's changed names because

120
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:05,680
of that success, is the collaborations with the KDE community. I know you've been working

121
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:10,740
with Alish Paul, who I had a chat with here on brunch as well about that. And he touched

122
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:15,220
on it a little bit. But it sounds like, yeah, there's some real tangible successes that

123
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:18,600
are coming from bringing all of these great people together.

124
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:29,520
Absolutely. The last Linux App Summit really brought in a greater closeness and collaborations.

125
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:36,520
Not only do we work well together, we trust each other. And that's probably one of the

126
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:43,640
biggest successes to be able to do that. I consider Alish a friend of mine. All of them.

127
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:51,240
We support each other. And for me, that's a huge success because we're able to get rid

128
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:57,200
of walls and move something we're all passionate about forward.

129
00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:00,720
You said that one of the most important things was trust. And that's not something we talk

130
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:08,800
about too often. But I think you're right. That is something that's essential in working

131
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:14,800
together. And I've been lucky enough to sort of virtually meet some of the people I think

132
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:23,160
that you're talking about. We mentioned Alish Paul and I have also spoken with Nuritzi Sanchez.

133
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:28,560
We've had a similar conversation. She's pretty amazing. Heather Ellsworth as well is really

134
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:33,480
great. And all of these people come from some different backgrounds. And all of that's coming

135
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:40,560
together into some, I guess, really cool community collaborations, right? And are there a few

136
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:43,480
others you'd like to mention just to give a shout out?

137
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:52,240
I think the people working around the Flatpack, the Flat Hub, the GNOME and KDE communities

138
00:14:52,240 --> 00:15:00,680
have been working together. We're building a foundational store for both GNOME and KDE

139
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:11,120
apps or any other apps out there. I think that's another great place that people are

140
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:16,680
working on. The Flatpack, I don't know everyone around it. I know that that's a collaboration.

141
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:28,280
But there are a couple in the Chaos project that we're working on. And this is around

142
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:37,840
metrics, right? And community metrics for our communities. Because working on our projects

143
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:46,720
is a little different than, let's say, a corporate-sponsored project because we deal with the public. And

144
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:56,760
as I was telling you before by Reddit, we have a class of problems that corporate projects

145
00:15:56,760 --> 00:16:04,720
don't have, right? Because we deal with tribalism in every part. I can't speak for KDE, but

146
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:14,960
for GNOME, it appears in bug reports, feature requests, forums. It's omnipresent for us.

147
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:20,400
It sounds like an omnipresence of some negativity, right? Is that what you're referring to?

148
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:27,320
Absolutely. And also positive things too. It's just that when you're building the interface

149
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:36,840
for your hardware and something changes, it's a very emotional experience for some technologists.

150
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:42,360
Because they put so much into their workflow. It's the perfect workflow. And when something

151
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:55,000
changes, it can create rage, right? So I understand where it comes from, but abusing the project

152
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:01,120
is not a great look. Generally doesn't give the results you're looking for anyways, right?

153
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:08,880
So that's not really a sound approach. Right. Exactly. But we're building another committee

154
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:19,720
with Georg Link and Nuritzy as well and Neo from the KDE project and myself. So for the

155
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:26,880
foundational members for that group. And this is again another way to get out of our silos

156
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:33,880
and be able to show through metrics what our community is doing, how they're doing, find

157
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:41,040
out the health of our community and be able to figure, find ways to improve our relationships

158
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:46,400
with the community at large by a more data-driven approach.

159
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:52,240
Sounds fascinating and sounds like that work is really important. The more I'm getting

160
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:59,680
to have conversations with people who are all over different parts of what is our open

161
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:05,120
source software and communities, the more I'm realizing that, like you're saying, community

162
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:11,480
building and those non-developer skills are actually some of the more important things

163
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:16,640
for the longevity of some of these projects. And I mean, it sounds in many ways like you've

164
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:25,760
dedicated most of your, well, can I say most of your life at this point to making a difference

165
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:30,880
here? Certainly. You know, I was never a big coder.

166
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:43,880
So I naturally fit into this space that works for me. And I enjoy building relationships

167
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:50,960
or connecting people or any of those things. Those are things that really drives me as

168
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,160
a person.

169
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:58,960
What was it then, you know, in the beginning that kind of attracted you to open source

170
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:03,440
software in the first place and Linux and GNOME specifically? You know, what has kind

171
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,560
of grabbed you and kept you here?

172
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:18,000
So I joined GNOME because I started off just like that kind of tribalness. At the time

173
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:27,800
we started, Linux was coming up. Linux was out there being installed by systems administrators

174
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:37,400
in secret. It was like a little revolution that was happening. And these desktop projects

175
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:45,160
started coming up because they were very aspirational. We wanted to build a desktop. And when KD

176
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:53,840
came out, that was exciting. GNOME came followed after that. I, for some reason, was attracted

177
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:58,720
more to the GNOME project than I was with the KDE project. And I think part of that

178
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:06,640
was because I like C more than I like C++. I know it's really a technologist thing, but

179
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:11,020
that was kind of one of the reasons.

180
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:14,880
It's part of the preference spectrum, right? So that makes sense to me.

181
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:21,600
It's sort of funny because I think our prejudice against C++ and the project is what kind of

182
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:33,680
binds us together. The great thing about GNOME is it's always reinventing itself in some

183
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:42,440
shape or form, right? The first version of GNOME was terrible software engineering. Maybe

184
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:51,840
on a blue moon on a certain day, you can get the whole thing to compile. It was full of

185
00:20:51,840 --> 00:21:01,160
bugs and features. And then the next iteration was the real transformational change, right?

186
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:08,520
We added accessibility. We learned a lot of things. We realized that software engineering

187
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:14,240
was a really important part and put a lot of controls in, which of course made a lot

188
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:24,880
of our public upset. And so this whole meme about features being removed actually came

189
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,880
from that era.

190
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:33,920
Then you get down to the third iteration, and now we've separated the user experience

191
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:41,040
from the platform, and then we added designers, right? So primarily in the past, it has always

192
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:48,320
been coders working on it. Now you've changed the workload to add designers. So I find all

193
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:57,520
of this fascinating because how we work together and trying to build something that works is

194
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:58,520
just fascinating.

195
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:04,200
There are still some more challenges out there that kind of keep being there because the

196
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:12,520
interesting bit now is in order to continue to grow, you actually have to build your non-technical

197
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:19,960
base up, right? Because scalability is an issue. There are lots of projects that have

198
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:28,200
high complexity, but they need people to deal with the bugs, triage the bugs, maintain order

199
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:35,040
in the threads that are out there, and so forth.

200
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:46,280
I think a lot of that non-technical contributions kind of works because we moved to a much more

201
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:55,760
modern platform like GitLab, right? So I think it allows for that kind of growth of non-technical

202
00:22:55,760 --> 00:23:04,980
contributors. It's just a continual set of changes as we keep going.

203
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:12,920
It sounds in many ways like a maturing and sort of natural, organic growth in directions

204
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:19,520
that are needed, you know, not throwing away the technical, but just sort of supporting

205
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:27,000
it with all of these aspects around it that sort of create the more human connection,

206
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
perhaps.

207
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:33,280
That's right. And we want to keep evolving because there's just a lot of great stuff

208
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:40,320
that we need to take advantage of. And I know as a project, I would like to see GNOME work

209
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:46,800
closely with as many other projects as well, because there's a lot of things we can learn

210
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,040
from each other.

211
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:54,600
Are you seeing the same kind of energy and hope from other projects in the direction

212
00:23:54,600 --> 00:24:01,140
of GNOME, for instance? Like I know you're describing that sort of hope to reach out

213
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:03,920
and collaborate, but are you seeing that the other way as well?

214
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:13,360
I don't know, but when I am interfacing with them, they definitely feel excited about it.

215
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:15,120
That's a good sign.

216
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:19,000
I get around more than a lot of the other project members.

217
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:25,040
And by get around, you mean sort of traveling to other conferences, many conferences and

218
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:29,280
meeting people and sort of building sort of one to one relationships. Is that what you're

219
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:30,280
referring to?

220
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:38,800
Yes, I'm a little bit more exposed to my work, right? Or my work history. I've spent a lot

221
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:46,080
of time in other ecosystems, like the Linux Foundation ecosystems, corporate open source,

222
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:55,840
a lot of those things. So I have networks outside of the desktop space, meaning I get

223
00:24:55,840 --> 00:25:03,720
to see various perception role things by watching what other projects do. And I work with a

224
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:08,720
lot of those people too, in the open source program offices, things like that.

225
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:11,680
That sounds like a really well rounded perspective.

226
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:23,800
Yes, I suppose so. Yeah. It's interesting how ecosystem or project works. And I learned

227
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:30,760
a lot of things and how their contributions happen, how they accept contributions, how

228
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:39,720
they work and their bugs, which helps me look in and see how, you know, can we adapt some

229
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:46,440
of those or maybe the other way around? What can we adapt from GNOME or from KDE or from

230
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:56,120
the desktop projects? So it gives me an opportunity to be an interface that's bidirectional.

231
00:25:56,120 --> 00:26:02,960
It feels almost like a communication of best practices in some way that might, you know,

232
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:08,520
and you can pick and choose which might fit for a certain purpose, which, yeah, that sounds

233
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:13,680
really useful, actually, instead of reinventing sort of the processes continuously and in

234
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:16,200
these little silos, like you were referring to previously.

235
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:22,760
Right, right. You know, like the Kubernetes community has some really interesting methodology

236
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:30,600
to use labels for contributions that it looks very interesting to me as an example.

237
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:34,360
I don't know about that. Can you walk us through that just a little bit?

238
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:43,760
They have a very automated setup. You know, you put a contribution, there's a series of

239
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:53,160
steps that happen that is ushered in through various labels that tells you what state the

240
00:26:53,160 --> 00:27:00,680
contribution is at and if you've signed a CLA and, you know, all these other things,

241
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:08,320
like when a new contribution comes in. And so there's definitely a flow that is, in my

242
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:18,320
mind, deterministic, right? And it's which I think we lack in Gnome.

243
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:30,960
Now, again, going back, when you're contributing to Kubernetes, it is a very fixed set of problems.

244
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:39,800
It's not like in a desktop space where you're essentially looking at infinite ways to do

245
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:48,200
work, right? Infinite work was because, you know, people always come up with ways to use

246
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:55,800
their computer as a tool. But Kubernetes has a very fixed set of things that it's used

247
00:27:55,800 --> 00:28:04,320
for. Whereas when you're dealing with humans on our side, it's infinite, right? It's whatever

248
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:06,000
you come up with.

249
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:10,440
Sounds like humans are becoming, they are the main challenge and they're always going

250
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:13,480
to be challenging and there's nothing you can do about that, right?

251
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:20,040
They will always be challenging. Yeah. And that's one of the most interesting problems

252
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:29,960
that we have because the tribalism, you get the conspiracy theories, which, you know,

253
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:34,080
Kubernetes doesn't have that, you know.

254
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:40,040
That's funny. And yet it can also be beautiful work, right? Like there's lots to celebrate

255
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:45,720
about the human connection to the work that we do via our computers and all of that. So

256
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:48,080
I could see why that would keep you interested for sure.

257
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:49,560
It's never a dull day.

258
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:53,880
Can you tell me a little bit about where you're working now and what you're doing sort of

259
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:56,640
on your day-to-day basis professionally?

260
00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:05,300
I work for a company called ITU Renew. They are in circular data centers and my specific

261
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:15,020
role is a principal ecosystems engineer. And we work primarily with the open compute project.

262
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:24,760
So I interface with parts of the open compute project, parts of Kubernetes, parts of open

263
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:32,760
source firmware project. Because ITU Renew is a hardware company and so we use all these

264
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:39,460
open tools to create an open block, right? So part of open infrastructure.

265
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:43,880
It sounds like there are many connections there too. You said, you know, parts of this

266
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:47,520
community, parts of that community. So it sounds like, again, you're a link between

267
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:52,080
many of those to try to create some neat synergies.

268
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:58,980
And a lot of times I'm not the subject matter expert. But I'm in news meetings and I surprise

269
00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:09,920
myself from speaking up from time to time. Even though I may not know some of those things.

270
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:17,680
But you know, there's definitely contributions that I try to make when possible. But it's

271
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:25,400
challenging to be able to switch from, let's say, something on networking to storage or

272
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:39,320
to firmware and keep watch on what's happening and keep my company's interests in mind and

273
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:40,720
my employer's interests in mind.

274
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:47,120
Yeah, of course. What a balance. Shree, if you wanted to send something out to the community,

275
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:52,320
a sort of an ask, maybe something you'd like them to try, something you would like us to

276
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:57,960
think about or to go see, what would be something you would send out there?

277
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:06,720
I would encourage others to try to build an app application and sort of analyze what is

278
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:14,120
hard, what is easy, how do you distribute it, that kind of things. And maybe do a write-up

279
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:20,600
because I think those are interesting things to know what the pain points are. In the aggregate,

280
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:27,200
having that kind of information is good for us if we want, as a community, to evolve into

281
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:34,520
something better that can compete with the other operating systems, non-Linux operating

282
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:35,720
systems.

283
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:41,480
That sounds like that would necessarily build some empathy as well for the work that goes

284
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:46,800
on behind most of this software in our open source community and how that works. And I

285
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:54,180
think maybe another interesting aspect would be to challenge ourselves to shift our thinking

286
00:31:54,180 --> 00:32:02,000
paradigm into the app's perspective instead of the desktop perspective. Would you agree?

287
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:09,560
The desktop is sort of a... It doesn't have the power it used to have because in this

288
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:17,800
day and age of web apps, it almost seems like the desktop is the proof of this. And so when

289
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:26,540
people don't think the desktop is important, they don't believe that it is of interest.

290
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:33,440
But if we rebrand it as apps or applications, then everybody understands that applications

291
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:43,760
are important. And by separating an applications community on Linux, it's a much easier ask.

292
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:51,880
The thing that people should understand is the apps community build an incredible amount

293
00:32:51,880 --> 00:33:00,280
of technology that people use every day. When I was at a Linux Foundation conference, I

294
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:10,320
would take the time to go through the various booths and I would ask, oh, have you heard

295
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:17,820
of Gnome or any of these others? And they said no. And so I would bring up Geno with

296
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:25,520
D-Bus. And they would say yes. They said, well, the apps community came up with D-Bus.

297
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:32,880
The members of their community was the one who built system D. The very technology that

298
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:43,520
we build came because we had to find ways to propagate hardware events to the user in

299
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:56,840
some fashion. And so these are all foundations for all the other technologies that people

300
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:58,560
are using elsewhere.

301
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:03,560
That's fascinating. I'm sure you thank you for joining me. If people wanted to get in

302
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:09,480
contact with you to say hi or to sort of share some thoughts with you, where would they best

303
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:11,040
contact you?

304
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:18,000
You can hit me on Twitter. It's S. Ramakrishna. Or you can email me at Sri at Gnome.org.

305
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:22,840
That sounds great. Sri, thank you so much for your time and really appreciate our chat.

306
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:41,840
It's been great.
