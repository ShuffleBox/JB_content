WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:07.320
You ready? You ready? Here we go. I'm going to spin the wheel of topics for the live stream.

00:07.320 --> 00:12.760
Hello, if you're watching. We are just hanging out here on a Tuesday, because we're not doing

00:12.760 --> 00:16.600
LEP today, and so we're just hanging out with everybody. We have a Jitsi room open and our

00:16.600 --> 00:22.200
mumble room is open if you'd like to hang out in the On Air channel with us. And Takalak

00:22.200 --> 00:26.160
liked the orange one. He's just joined the mumble room. Hello, the orange one. How are you?

00:26.160 --> 00:32.480
Hello. Hello. It's orange today, it's lovely. Yes, so we're going to spin the wheel of topics

00:32.480 --> 00:46.760
and it is open to discussion for everyone. Here we go. And the winner is... The Ubuntu

00:46.760 --> 00:51.320
Wag Remix. What is this? Well, we got a piece of feedback, I think it was two weeks ago,

00:51.320 --> 00:55.360
someone saying, hey, have you guys heard about this? Have you played with it? Do you know what's

00:55.360 --> 01:01.520
going on with it? As far as I understand, there's a bunch of sort of web sites. Web

01:01.520 --> 01:07.000
Remix. Yes, there's a typo in there. Web Remix. Yes, I am familiar with this a little bit.

01:07.000 --> 01:14.080
And I just know it slightly and have dabbled in reading sort of the headlines on it. But

01:14.080 --> 01:16.720
I think it would be interesting to dive in and see what it's all about. It sounds like

01:16.720 --> 01:20.760
there's a small niche of people that are that are really getting around it. I know there's

01:20.760 --> 01:25.840
some websites that are trying to tie into this, too, but that's the end basically of

01:25.840 --> 01:32.960
my knowledge in it. Hmm. Hmm. Yeah. So it's got a fancy, it's got kind of a fancy look

01:32.960 --> 01:39.320
to it. It's trying to find the name of the person who created it. But it's kind of you

01:39.320 --> 01:42.800
could think of it as like an alternative to Chrome OS, I suppose. I think I have a screen

01:42.800 --> 01:48.080
cap so I can put it up on the... Yeah, there we go. This is a nine to five Linux article

01:48.080 --> 01:53.680
here. And you can kind of see it's got some some serious kind of it's like I guess it's

01:53.680 --> 01:58.080
going on. It looks like GNOME Shell to me. From what I understand, the underpinning is

01:58.080 --> 02:03.440
a bunch of web apps, right? Seems so. Yeah. Seems that's their deal. But they're sort

02:03.440 --> 02:09.000
of as far as I understand, optimized to be used in this way. I could definitely see it

02:09.000 --> 02:16.000
being appealing on a Chrome OS style machine. You know what I mean? I can see that. I was

02:16.000 --> 02:20.640
just looking at their they got a they got a pretty simple website. Check this out. It's

02:20.640 --> 02:32.120
at Ubuntu dash web dot org. And this is it. That's it. And this is like certified canonical

02:32.120 --> 02:35.840
stuff, right? I don't know about that. No, I don't think so. Well, would they let them

02:35.840 --> 02:43.360
use the name? Well, let's see. Would you want to be the company that goes around playing

02:43.360 --> 02:48.160
whack-a-mole with haven't they done that in the past? I thought I think they're hoping.

02:48.160 --> 02:52.700
So basically, I think the way it kind of I don't know for sure. But I think unofficially

02:52.700 --> 02:58.920
the way it kind of works is if you're working towards becoming an official flavor. I don't

02:58.920 --> 03:03.600
think they're going to raise this thing. I see. OK. But if you are out there popping

03:03.600 --> 03:09.120
off and, you know, calling shuttle worth a bully or something like that, then they might

03:09.120 --> 03:13.760
have a problem with it. So here's a little video of their it's like micros. Look, they

03:13.760 --> 03:19.480
got a little button there to install the office three city five. You know, it's funny they

03:19.480 --> 03:24.360
show that first. Well, it's it does make a point, doesn't it? It does make a point. And

03:24.360 --> 03:28.040
then I guess they must add it to the launcher. Yeah. So now there it is in the launcher,

03:28.040 --> 03:36.800
which is slightly cut off on the stream version. And I kind of I actually think that's a pretty

03:36.800 --> 03:43.480
good demo, really. I don't really, for me personally, want this. Well, what's the use

03:43.480 --> 03:50.240
case here? Well, low, low operating devices like low spec devices. Yeah. Or even older

03:50.240 --> 03:56.280
laptops. I mean, if you think in terms of like it is, it is my wife's workload. Web

03:56.280 --> 04:02.200
apps are probably 90 percent of what she does use. Right. So for people that maybe do that.

04:02.200 --> 04:13.200
Like I hate Web apps, so I minimize I minimize my usage as much as possible. Yeah. I don't

04:13.200 --> 04:15.960
know, but I think it's a great project for that kind of use case since probably more

04:15.960 --> 04:20.160
users like that than like you. Right. But I thought at least it would be interesting

04:20.160 --> 04:24.600
to know it exists, wrap our head around a little bit and maybe have a look every six

04:24.600 --> 04:30.200
months. Sure. Yeah, we should definitely check in. So Sab's asking in the chat room if we

04:30.200 --> 04:40.200
have any thoughts on a product manager and hiring a gaming product manager. I think it's

04:40.200 --> 04:45.640
a really interesting sign from Canonical. Yeah, we did talk about it briefly, I think

04:45.640 --> 04:51.080
in the pre-show. Was it the pre-show of last year's Unplugged on Sunday? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

04:51.080 --> 04:58.880
And we've been talking about it since a little bit. And I don't know, I wonder if it's like

04:58.880 --> 05:03.000
the description itself seems a little bit like it's written by two different departments.

05:03.000 --> 05:10.320
Yeah. And so I wonder if it's a small pilot project that they're doing to try to maybe.

05:10.320 --> 05:14.880
My first reaction was like an OEM partner probably wants to ship a gaming laptop or

05:14.880 --> 05:18.400
something. That makes sense. But how long would they be willing to wait for Canonical

05:18.400 --> 05:24.720
to put their stuff together? They will wait sometimes. Hello, MiniMac. No, we're not recording.

05:24.720 --> 05:29.400
We were just sort of since we're live, we're just riffing. We went in the on air channel,

05:29.400 --> 05:36.160
but yeah. Can we join? Yeah. The other ones are in the lobby. Sure. Okay. Sure. So we

05:36.160 --> 05:41.000
will. All right. Oh, do they usually sit in the lobby then? Yeah. Yeah. For the for the

05:41.000 --> 05:50.720
upload. Yeah. Okay. Hey. Hello. Hello. Hi guys. Hi. So Brent made us a wheel of topics.

05:50.720 --> 05:54.680
We were just kind of going through and talking about like a wheel of fortune style, prices

05:54.680 --> 05:58.520
right style wheel that you spin. And you can send in your suggestions for other things

05:58.520 --> 06:03.880
to do. Oh yeah. Does anybody want to add a that's a great idea. Anybody have a suggestion

06:03.880 --> 06:10.400
for the topic, the wheel of topics? We should have put the gaming one on there. Oh, I heard

06:10.400 --> 06:15.640
a bling. What was that? That's somebody in the thing with the that's always got it. Whenever

06:15.640 --> 06:23.360
there's a sound, it's always gypsy that you can count on for sure. All right. So anybody

06:23.360 --> 06:28.240
in the chat room or even the number of them have a topic. Let's add it to the wheel. Yeah.

06:28.240 --> 06:35.120
I had my first experience with pipe over now. I just added by bio to my Ubuntu installations

06:35.120 --> 06:40.920
and all in all, I'm really happy. And I, as others suggested when it comes to Bluetooth

06:40.920 --> 06:47.920
connections with headsets, a paper is a huge, huge improvement. You can't imagine it's really

06:47.920 --> 06:53.280
good. Some quality is better and connection problems are gone. So really good. Really

06:53.280 --> 06:57.960
good. I think that right there is the reason it did so well in the taxis is a lot of people

06:57.960 --> 07:06.600
are doing virtual meetings now. And, uh, my co-host Mike from Koda radio had, uh, had

07:06.600 --> 07:12.400
a sales call where he had it got, he, you know, and he's using pulse audio and it disconnected

07:12.400 --> 07:17.440
his Bluetooth headset in the middle of the sales call. And he's like, that's it. I'm

07:17.440 --> 07:22.920
not using this ever again. I will only use the Mac for my sales calls. That's very embarrassing,

07:22.920 --> 07:31.120
isn't it? Yeah. Um, but there is one thing. So if I go to Cody, I have somehow wonky sound.

07:31.120 --> 07:39.960
So, uh, well, not that it is, um, stable, but it is like, Whoa, it's really wonky for

07:39.960 --> 07:46.660
some reason. I don't know if it is the PVR plugin I use or didn't have extensive testing

07:46.660 --> 07:52.120
now with movies I have on Cody because it was at the second residence. I will do some

07:52.120 --> 07:58.280
tests here, but that's the only major flaw I see because Cody is a software that I use

07:58.280 --> 08:04.440
daily here. And if I have that problem also here in my, I will stay in post audio in fact.

08:04.440 --> 08:10.940
So here's what I've done is, uh, I've added things that Linux does great and things that

08:10.940 --> 08:15.560
Linux sucks at that to the topic. Oh, I like this. Yes. So we'll have to talk about this

08:15.560 --> 08:23.040
is like the daily conversation around here. Yeah. You got any other, uh, any other suggestions?

08:23.040 --> 08:30.280
Any other suggest I, you know, I haven't, I haven't tried, uh, I haven't tried pipe

08:30.280 --> 08:35.560
wire yet. And I wonder for those listening and myself included, what would be the easiest

08:35.560 --> 08:41.720
way to kind of jump in and play with it without necessarily committing, um, fedora. Ah, of

08:41.720 --> 08:48.880
course. What I can tell you, if you have open to LTS or even recent open to stare is some

08:48.880 --> 08:55.600
three step procedure where you can in fact, install Piper along with pulse audio. And

08:55.600 --> 09:01.320
then it's like two, three command where you can switch back to post audio. It's basically

09:01.320 --> 09:08.520
you install the components and then you turn off post audio with system CTL and mask the

09:08.520 --> 09:15.640
post audio driver. And then you enable and load the pipe driver and that's all. So you

09:15.640 --> 09:18.320
can switch with three commands and then you're back.

09:18.320 --> 09:22.680
It sounds like you can even just script that into an on off button. Oh, sure.

09:22.680 --> 09:29.440
Uh, yeah, basically yes. But I, the thing is that you have system components that are

09:29.440 --> 09:34.780
loaded during boot and then you have to use the sessions. So it could be that you have

09:34.780 --> 09:40.200
to log in, log out to make the pipe hour session or the policy was a post audio session booking.

09:40.200 --> 09:46.000
I don't know if, if just a post audio dash K does work or if there is something similar

09:46.000 --> 09:50.240
for pipeline, you know, pulse dash K is one of the best ways for me to get a Barry White

09:50.240 --> 09:51.240
going on.

09:51.240 --> 10:00.760
Uh, so I managed to get the video feed piped into the gypsy room. So that's cool.

10:00.760 --> 10:02.960
I'm fascinated by how it's backwards for us.

10:02.960 --> 10:08.320
Yeah. You know why is because people are so used to looking in mirrors. It throws them

10:08.320 --> 10:12.160
off. It's the selfie look. So they flip it around. So that way our little human brains

10:12.160 --> 10:15.960
can deal with it. But when you're displaying texts, it sure is strange for us. But yeah,

10:15.960 --> 10:18.840
so if you go in the gypsy room, you can hang out there too. If we're having problems with

10:18.840 --> 10:22.760
mumble again and I'll have the video feed. So we've got, I put, I was just putting the

10:22.760 --> 10:26.360
wheel of topics up. Should I give it a spin?

10:26.360 --> 10:27.360
Yeah, I think she should go for it.

10:27.360 --> 10:32.040
All right, here we go. Let's see what we're going to talk about. The wheel of topics.

10:32.040 --> 10:42.960
Feel free to submit one, giving it a spin now. All right. And we have landed on things.

10:42.960 --> 10:52.040
Linux does great. And I'll now remove that from the list of possibilities and we'll spin

10:52.040 --> 11:00.200
it again here in a moment. But things. Linux does great. You want to start? I got a few.

11:00.200 --> 11:06.400
I have a trolly answer for you. All right. What is it combined? Use lots of power around

11:06.400 --> 11:14.000
the world. Oh, all the cloud servers. Oh gosh. Yeah, we better ban that Linux. Right. It's

11:14.000 --> 11:21.320
using too much power. You know, I really, I still to this day just love that you can

11:21.320 --> 11:26.040
pick a Linux where you can have something that's just super quick to install or you

11:26.040 --> 11:30.200
can have something that lets you define if a firewall launches and if you have SSH and

11:30.200 --> 11:34.600
you have all these kind of little configuration options you can do. And I find that nice because

11:34.600 --> 11:37.840
I do want to set all those things. And I like that there's distributions that give me that

11:37.840 --> 11:41.800
choice. So I think we do really well at that. And then the other thing I think we're particularly

11:41.800 --> 11:46.080
good at, in fact, I think we're way better than any of the commercial operating systems

11:46.080 --> 11:54.600
at is we are willing to revisit plumbing and rewrite it like like system D, like firewall

11:54.600 --> 12:01.320
D, like pipewire, like Wayland, like all the new back end compositor stuff that the different

12:01.320 --> 12:06.720
projects are having to write to support Wayland. Like we're willing to plumb that stuff again

12:06.720 --> 12:12.840
and retrench where Windows just builds on top of legacy code in that anti code base

12:12.840 --> 12:18.760
and layers and layers and layers and layers over it and builds simultaneous subsystems

12:18.760 --> 12:24.680
and all kinds of just crazy wonky ass legacy spaghetti code. And while we're not immune

12:24.680 --> 12:31.080
from it, I think we're way better about addressing that than Windows and also the Mac OS.

12:31.080 --> 12:37.120
I think that might be a subtle weakness only in that it's up to us to stay current all

12:37.120 --> 12:43.520
the time. Sure. I wonder if there's a lifelong if you're an AWS customer or you're consuming

12:43.520 --> 12:48.880
rail and deploying it every five, six, seven years. It's not that bad, right? It's more

12:48.880 --> 12:52.800
like if you're sitting in the position where we're at. Yeah, I suppose we have a unique

12:52.800 --> 12:57.220
kind of look on this to strap in. Anybody in the mumble room have something that Linux

12:57.220 --> 13:05.600
is better at than all the other platforms? Well, yeah, no kidding, right? Yeah, I would

13:05.600 --> 13:13.920
throw in as a user updates, upgrades and migration procedures. Right. I mean, we are really strong

13:13.920 --> 13:22.480
with that. I mean, I just migrated a system and I can have a package lists and my repository

13:22.480 --> 13:28.560
keys, copy them over and then do an installation procedure. And in like five minutes, I find

13:28.560 --> 13:35.240
myself with the same system I have on the other side, just read a few commands and procedures

13:35.240 --> 13:43.760
normally, normally the same. So keep on also keeping your system clean. I mean, yeah, DNF

13:43.760 --> 13:51.540
and apps are really cool now with auto removing packages that are not needed anymore and everything.

13:51.540 --> 13:56.120
So to maintain the system when it comes to packages and software, I mean, we are far

13:56.120 --> 14:02.200
better than than at least Windows. I have no clue for my for my for Max. I feel like

14:02.200 --> 14:05.360
it's better. I feel like, you know, I have this neon install that's like from twenty

14:05.360 --> 14:11.200
eighteen and it's still it runs just as good as it did the day I installed it. And same

14:11.200 --> 14:15.680
with my arch box upstairs. It's from like twenty eighteen, twenty seventeen. And I don't

14:15.680 --> 14:20.240
feel like it has like registry creep or anything like that. It still runs really good. Also

14:20.240 --> 14:23.560
a mini Mac, just kind of doubling down on what you said from like a desktop standpoint.

14:23.560 --> 14:30.640
I know I mentioned this just recently, but. When you boot up Windows or Mac, if you haven't

14:30.640 --> 14:35.520
used it for like a week plus, man, you just get slammed with all these background processes

14:35.520 --> 14:41.360
that are like checking for X and updating Y and indexing this, and it's just like a

14:41.360 --> 14:44.880
shit show on your machine, especially the Mac, like the Mac has gotten really bad about

14:44.880 --> 14:49.040
this because there's cloud photo stuff they got to do. And, you know, it's just gotten

14:49.040 --> 14:54.880
really bad on Linux. Like, worst case, you boot up a desktop that you haven't used in

14:54.880 --> 15:00.840
a week plus and it for forty five seconds is going to update the package cache. I disagree.

15:00.840 --> 15:07.460
Yeah, I have recently run into a bunch of times when. So I have a. I have pretty bad

15:07.460 --> 15:12.400
Internet from modern standards at my place, so I notice these things. It's sort of like

15:12.400 --> 15:16.320
when you're in the RV. Are you implying that I don't? Well, I'm implying that sometimes

15:16.320 --> 15:20.760
when I'm in the RV with you, we don't. Yeah, I mean, there are times, but yeah. OK, go

15:20.760 --> 15:27.400
ahead. And so I've noticed a trend towards the same thing that Mac and Windows are doing.

15:27.400 --> 15:32.800
So if you look at unattended package upgrades, those are enabled by default. Oh, you're using

15:32.800 --> 15:38.520
snaps. Yeah, no, not only on snaps, apt as well has unattended stuff going on, at least

15:38.520 --> 15:44.160
on. Yeah, but not on any of my systems. That is that is combined with the software manager

15:44.160 --> 15:48.920
package. And you can disable that. I know you can disable this, but I'm suggesting that

15:48.920 --> 15:53.240
it's what I would say beyond that. But I would say beyond that, though, I guess I still consider

15:53.240 --> 15:59.840
that not even really comparable because the difference there is it's it's like a unified

15:59.840 --> 16:05.760
update mechanism versus every app you've ever installed has its own built in updater. Fair

16:05.760 --> 16:10.120
enough. And that's just madness because there's no coordination. Like they're all competing

16:10.120 --> 16:14.520
for resources at the same time. Right. So you're right. You do have more automatic updates,

16:14.520 --> 16:20.880
especially with snaps and snaps is a separate process. But like say you're on the flat pack

16:20.880 --> 16:26.280
GNOME software train. Right. That's all just getting updated by GNOME software or or the

16:26.280 --> 16:30.520
command line. That seems better to me. You could update flat back separately and stuff.

16:30.520 --> 16:34.600
But you're right. We do have more, especially with snaps and flat packs, more automatic

16:34.600 --> 16:39.880
updates. But I don't mean any of my systems auto update just because of bandwidth. I have

16:39.880 --> 16:44.640
to turn all that on. What I can tell you, I have a dual boot system on my laptop where

16:44.640 --> 16:51.120
from like every month or so I boot up Windows 10 and there I have my hard drive spinning

16:51.120 --> 16:58.320
for without acceleration for like 20 or 30 minutes and I'm doing nothing. I'm just watching

16:58.320 --> 17:04.640
the blinking led of my hard drive spinning and I have no clue. I have no clue what that

17:04.640 --> 17:09.520
thing is doing because I have no information at all. I have nothing. It's just spinning

17:09.520 --> 17:17.280
and just blinking. And even though if you have to automatic the unattended upgrade running

17:17.280 --> 17:22.160
on Ubuntu, that takes like five minutes and then you get that pop up windows. We have

17:22.160 --> 17:27.200
these updates and then it does the updates and then after let's say 10 minutes you're

17:27.200 --> 17:33.840
done and then your system runs cool again and your van is not vanning like hell. And

17:33.840 --> 17:36.880
so we are much better when it comes to that.

17:36.880 --> 17:42.120
One of my most frustrating experiences that happens regularly unless you know you turn

17:42.120 --> 17:46.760
it off is, you know, you're in the middle. Okay, you're setting up for a show, Chris.

17:46.760 --> 17:49.380
You're doing all this research. You know, it's like two hours before you're putting

17:49.380 --> 17:53.360
all the things together. You're just in a flow and you're setting everything up. Sure.

17:53.360 --> 17:58.600
And all of a sudden Firefox says, oh, we can't load the pages anymore. You have to just reboot

17:58.600 --> 18:03.000
to apply all of the updates we did in the background. That's a thing. It's a thing.

18:03.000 --> 18:07.920
Oh, my God. I've run into that in a few on a few systems now and it drives me insane

18:07.920 --> 18:13.920
because I'm the kind of person who just hyper focuses. So if it takes me a bit to get into

18:13.920 --> 18:16.840
something, but once I'm in there, I could spend hours and I free. And you got it. You

18:16.840 --> 18:22.320
also have to off ramp. Yeah. And but then it's like this. Bam. No more. That's sort

18:22.320 --> 18:25.920
of that's what happened to me this morning. Oh, it's the worst. I didn't get an off ramp.

18:25.920 --> 18:33.080
So you know what I'm talking about. What? No, I'm in the flow. I'm in the flow. No.

18:33.080 --> 18:35.600
Yeah. No, I totally. Wow. I got to say, I have not hit that with Firefox, but I could

18:35.600 --> 18:40.680
understand why because it's doing like some sort of update thing. And but why can't they

18:40.680 --> 18:44.960
just let the with the worst case you get with Chrome is it just gives you a little badge

18:44.960 --> 18:50.320
that says you need to restart the browser to get the update, but you don't have to restart.

18:50.320 --> 18:56.800
That is better. I would want it to suggest that and not make it so that my browser that

18:56.800 --> 19:01.480
I tend to have like a hundred. Is it not getting updated through app? Is it updating? Well,

19:01.480 --> 19:06.840
I wonder if it's updating the and someone might know this more than I do, but I wonder

19:06.840 --> 19:12.640
if it's updating all of the extensions. And because those have updated, they're kind of

19:12.640 --> 19:16.520
in in this funny state now that, you know, when you load a new page, they're reaching

19:16.520 --> 19:20.840
out the extensions. Like, isn't that something else, too? You can have applications that

19:20.840 --> 19:24.720
are doing self updates in their components. That's what I mean. Yeah, it's getting a little

19:24.720 --> 19:28.440
out of hand. It is. It is. And so you can turn that off. You know, you go about config

19:28.440 --> 19:31.560
and turn it off. But the default is can we just mention this is another great reason

19:31.560 --> 19:35.840
why it's nice not to have all of your damn applications in a web browser. Yeah, I'll

19:35.840 --> 19:40.560
agree with that. Not to mention the overhead and CPU usage and memory usage and stuff.

19:40.560 --> 19:46.500
OK, so last call. Does anybody have a like something Linux is great at compared to the

19:46.500 --> 19:52.640
other OSes before we spin the wheel again? I think modularity. That's like, yeah, how

19:52.640 --> 19:57.040
did that not come up? I feel like you just made it such a success, like in the marketplace

19:57.040 --> 20:03.720
as you can use the computer. That's like a huge, huge aspect. It seems maybe in hardware

20:03.720 --> 20:10.600
for sure. What was that one? Lower, lower and lower in hardware. Oh, yeah, sure. Yeah,

20:10.600 --> 20:15.960
right. It is great for breathing life. Just look at the pie. Has anyone tried to run windows

20:15.960 --> 20:22.080
on a pie? Well, nobody does it, right? Because it's so awful. That's what I mean. Yeah. If

20:22.080 --> 20:29.200
I can say something, it's great for music. All right. I think it's great for podcast

20:29.200 --> 20:34.200
production, so I'll I'll get behind that. You mean for music production? Yeah, for music

20:34.200 --> 20:43.960
production, because because I've got like I'm using Ubuntu and running Bitwig and a

20:43.960 --> 20:51.240
host of other applications and through the jack through this jack subsystem for audio,

20:51.240 --> 21:00.480
we all work nicely together. Yeah. Yeah. What we can do with Jack and our mixer is unbelievable.

21:00.480 --> 21:06.840
It's nice. It's like this mixer is just an extension of our Linux box. It's incredible.

21:06.840 --> 21:11.880
And if this mixer ever died, I just buy another one, even though it's years old now. I just

21:11.880 --> 21:17.440
buy an exact replacement because it's just it's wild that I can I can I can route the

21:17.440 --> 21:24.520
audio in and outs in the mixer using Jack. I can wire my mixer using Jack. And it's just

21:24.520 --> 21:29.000
and then the fact that Reaper also natively speaks, Jack. So any of the inputs and outputs

21:29.000 --> 21:34.640
we create in Jack show up as audio inputs and outputs in Reaper. It's just you couldn't

21:34.640 --> 21:38.240
even do it on other. It's what you were wishing about. Yeah. You just couldn't even do it

21:38.240 --> 21:46.720
on a Mac or on Windows. Did you have this mixer before talking about mixers? I find

21:46.720 --> 21:53.080
the mixer of our door. Oh, yeah. OK. Yes, I bet. I bet. I've heard it's really great

21:53.080 --> 22:00.360
for music. Yeah. I've never really given a proper spin, but I should. All right. You

22:00.360 --> 22:06.000
know what time it is, then we have the Behringer X 32, but Behringer makes a whole line. So

22:06.000 --> 22:11.360
if you don't need something as big as the X 32, you could like they have a 12 and eight,

22:11.360 --> 22:24.120
I think, which this is the amount of inputs. All right. Let's spin the wheel. Oh, almost

22:24.120 --> 22:30.880
went to Brent Stocker, right? But we have to. So this originated from another piece

22:30.880 --> 22:34.680
of feedback that we got saying, hey, I think it might be really interesting to dive into

22:34.680 --> 22:40.320
cubes. And I many years ago read about cubes and the calories and stuff when I was getting

22:40.320 --> 22:46.200
interested in that. And I sort of forget what it does. So can anybody like refresh me on

22:46.200 --> 22:49.840
that? I'll give you a super high level because I've used it like a grand total of twice.

22:49.840 --> 22:55.040
So that's more than me. I'm no expert, but it is designed for the very super security

22:55.040 --> 22:59.280
paranoid to isolate different applications and aspects of your desktop into their own

22:59.280 --> 23:04.560
dedicated VMs. And then cubes tries to make that all usable. So like Firefox would have

23:04.560 --> 23:12.560
its own VM and just total machine isolation. So you don't have to worry about, you know,

23:12.560 --> 23:16.040
people stealing your data's. We should go look at their what their description is on

23:16.040 --> 23:20.480
their website. I don't know. Is anybody in the mumble room giving cubes a proper or Jitsi

23:20.480 --> 23:25.480
given cubes a proper? You should show that to to the Jitsi room there. What's that? This?

23:25.480 --> 23:33.240
Yeah, the cube site. Sure. Edwards Nodin says, if you're serious about security, cubes OS

23:33.240 --> 23:39.120
is the best OS available today. It's what I use. Does he really? I want to go ask him.

23:39.120 --> 23:44.360
So, yeah, they're using Zen underneath Fedora, Debian or Windows. I didn't know about Windows.

23:44.360 --> 23:51.320
Oh, yeah. Windows VM. Sure. Sure. Didn't you say that about Tails? Yeah, he may have changed

23:51.320 --> 23:57.040
his opinion. Maybe he uses both. All right. So what is cubes OS? Well, there's the diagram

23:57.040 --> 24:04.560
for your brand. Oh, it's nice and simple. So you got an admin VM, you got your GUI VM

24:04.560 --> 24:08.520
and then you got your template VM to launch different like built in distro options or

24:08.520 --> 24:14.940
applications. Cubes OS is a free open source security oriented operating system for a single

24:14.940 --> 24:21.760
user desktop. It leverages the Zen based virtualization to allow for the creation and management of

24:21.760 --> 24:29.880
isolated compartments called cubes. So that's where the name comes from. Got it. Yeah. Cubes,

24:29.880 --> 24:34.400
which are implemented as virtual machines, have specific purposes like a predefined

24:34.400 --> 24:40.400
set of one of many isolated applications for like personal use or project use. Maybe you

24:40.400 --> 24:47.360
need a specific network stack, something like that. It has what it calls natures. I don't

24:47.360 --> 24:52.200
know about that. A full fledged stripped down virtual machine. Levels of trust from complete

24:52.200 --> 24:57.160
to non-existent in terms of trust. All the windows from the applications or from the

24:57.160 --> 25:04.560
VMs are displayed in the unified desktop environment with an unforgeable color coded window border.

25:04.560 --> 25:09.280
So the different security levels are easily identified. Oh, that's kind of nice though.

25:09.280 --> 25:13.660
That is nice. Yeah. You know, this is a dangerous one and then they have down here at the bottom

25:13.660 --> 25:19.920
of the diagram, they have the different colors of trust. And so I wonder if there are default

25:19.920 --> 25:25.160
levels of trust that cubes defines on these apps. For some reason, trust it more or less.

25:25.160 --> 25:29.320
You can modify that default. I mean, imagine if you're like a Bitcoin billionaire, right?

25:29.320 --> 25:32.880
You're probably going to be pretty careful every time you open up that wallet. Have you

25:32.880 --> 25:40.360
heard of split GPG? Utilizes split GPG to keep your private keys safe. Yeah. Is it like

25:40.360 --> 25:50.800
a split GPG? I wonder if it's a GPG wallet of sorts. I don't know. Let's go look. Split

25:50.800 --> 25:55.600
GPG implements a concept similar to having a smart card with your private GPG keys. Oh,

25:55.600 --> 25:59.720
that's cool. So it's like something you know, something you have kind of thing. It reminds

25:59.720 --> 26:05.480
me of those little devices. You have one upstairs in the closet kind of buried in there. I think

26:05.480 --> 26:10.400
the YubiKey kind of thing. Yeah, the YubiKey. This is software based, I take it. Yeah, I

26:10.400 --> 26:21.040
guess so. Yeah, that's interesting. So it says here that the idea is that one not so

26:21.040 --> 26:27.280
trusted domain, like, for example, one where Thunderbird is running, can delegate all of

26:27.280 --> 26:33.960
its crypto operations, such as decryption or encryption and signing to another more

26:33.960 --> 26:41.720
trusted network isolated domain. Are you following this? Trying. So Thunderbird, which is probably

26:41.720 --> 26:45.200
a risky app, right? Because it connects to a bunch of different places. And you're downloading

26:45.200 --> 26:50.880
emails that contain malicious URLs or whatever like that, right? So Thunderword's in your

26:50.880 --> 26:58.680
work email VM. Then when you go to use it to do a GPG operation, like say sign an email,

26:58.680 --> 27:04.840
which I wish we all did as a matter of practice to tell you the truth. Yeah. It will use this

27:04.840 --> 27:12.440
split GPG system to actually conduct the signing and cryptographic operations in a separate

27:12.440 --> 27:16.400
VM that is more isolated and more trusted, which from the color. Yeah, I could tell it's

27:16.400 --> 27:20.440
trusted. They've even color coded the little diagram there. That is nice. That is nice.

27:20.440 --> 27:27.040
Cool. I mean, that is really slick. You got to admit that's a pretty clever solution.

27:27.040 --> 27:32.440
It sounds well thought out. Yeah. And I wonder, I can't, I'm getting interested in wondering

27:32.440 --> 27:36.280
how this might be to run. I mean, this seems like your speed to be honest with you. Okay.

27:36.280 --> 27:41.480
When I'm traveling, I just kind of like, right. I have a USB key and I run this, huh? Yeah.

27:41.480 --> 27:47.920
Especially if you get a fast one, fast USB. Has anyone tried this? So I think it's too

27:47.920 --> 27:52.520
much work. I think people worry it's too much work, but what they're attempting to do is,

27:52.520 --> 27:56.480
is to make it built in and kind of work out of the box, right? That's the whole idea.

27:56.480 --> 28:02.560
You could build this yourself. I'm imagine, but that would be an undertaking. I mean,

28:02.560 --> 28:06.000
it's an amazing piece of engineering, but I think you have to be as smart as Edwardson

28:06.000 --> 28:09.760
to really run it correctly. So I'll be just fine is what you're saying. Yeah. I wonder

28:09.760 --> 28:14.720
if silver blue is a better in the, in, you know, middle ground maybe. I don't know. Mini

28:14.720 --> 28:19.600
Mac asks a good question and that is how do the app updates work? Like do you update a

28:19.600 --> 28:24.200
whole VM to get Thunderbird up to date? Like how does that? Yeah, that, that was my thing

28:24.200 --> 28:30.080
because, uh, you talked about, uh, Brent talked about Firefox updating itself, which is a

28:30.080 --> 28:36.360
security problem. Sure is. So are these VMs read only? So if you put that up, do you know

28:36.360 --> 28:43.440
that the applications that no one can change in fact that VM and you only have a part of

28:43.440 --> 28:48.040
your home directory where you have all your data or how does that work? I guess if you

28:48.040 --> 28:53.960
got really nitty gritty, you could have almost like firewalls in each VM that only let through

28:53.960 --> 28:59.600
trusted, uh, domains. This seems like an opportunity for you to like, you know, try this and let

28:59.600 --> 29:05.640
us know, you know? Oh, I see. I see. I'm just saying I'd like to know. I remember when,

29:05.640 --> 29:12.280
when it comes to security, the early Linux days, we sat, burn yourself a not big CD rom

29:12.280 --> 29:18.340
and put that one over, you know, that there is no access to the applications. Nothing

29:18.340 --> 29:25.280
can be changed on the operating system. Yeah. Good point. Yeah. The, uh, the good old days

29:25.280 --> 29:30.960
in optics, you're gonna, you're gonna use quick MU right now to, to launch a cubes VM

29:30.960 --> 29:36.360
and just try it out. Right. How deep down can we go? Right? Um, anyways, that's a topic

29:36.360 --> 29:43.320
that I think is worth maybe it could be playing with. It's maybe more on the technical fun

29:43.320 --> 29:49.160
side of things and less on the useful everyday. So things, but I think worth keeping Brent

29:49.160 --> 29:54.640
visits cube OS land and we find out, should I go to Quebec to visit cubes from, from quick?

29:54.640 --> 29:59.920
No, you didn't have to do that, right? No, it's, but I'm in Quebec city. All right. You

29:59.920 --> 30:04.080
know what? Oh, you know what that music means? Wait, before spinning, do we have any other

30:04.080 --> 30:08.840
suggestions? Oh yeah. Anything else we should add to the wheel? We can't let the wheel get

30:08.840 --> 30:13.320
empty. Well, we could in the streams done, you know, like when they went, we'll run out.

30:13.320 --> 30:16.960
There's incentive. The more you suggest the longer we're on. Yeah. If you've got an idea

30:16.960 --> 30:21.760
for the wheel for a topic for us to discuss, it could be about anything I suppose. Yeah.

30:21.760 --> 30:32.680
Um, and we're done. Yeah, there it is. Although hopefully there will be one day. All right.

30:32.680 --> 30:35.520
We're going to spin it, but you can drop a, you can drop a suggestion in the chat room

30:35.520 --> 30:58.000
or remember to see. Here we go. Here we go. Oh, oh, oh no. Okay. Bitcoin node set up.

30:58.000 --> 31:03.300
So let's see, Jesus, the background deleting this one off this, right? So you can run your

31:03.300 --> 31:07.600
own Bitcoin node. What, when, what that is, is basically it's like a transaction processor

31:07.600 --> 31:11.400
and you can have, it's a great way to kind of bypass having to pay heavy fees, but it

31:11.400 --> 31:17.240
also helps decentralize the Bitcoin network. But what I was coming across recently is a

31:17.240 --> 31:25.600
really neat open source project called umbral, uh, and umbral, which is get umbral, get a,

31:25.600 --> 31:33.880
which is spelled G E T U M B R E L dot com. Am I saying that right? Probably. It is both

31:33.880 --> 31:43.580
a personal server deployment platform and a self hosted Bitcoin wallet and Bitcoin node.

31:43.580 --> 31:48.920
So one of the things you can do is you install it. Uh, they distribute it as either a raspberry

31:48.920 --> 31:55.240
pie image or a setup script that is pretty much really only usable on Ubuntu or Debian.

31:55.240 --> 32:01.400
But when you get it set up, which is pretty easy and pretty quick, it creates a Docker

32:01.400 --> 32:08.720
environment that is using nginx to do a proxy. And then inside that Docker environment, there's

32:08.720 --> 32:13.160
the master image of umbral. And then it has an app store of open source free software

32:13.160 --> 32:18.440
where you can install things like next cloud or photo prism or a bunch of really nice Bitcoin

32:18.440 --> 32:25.080
uh, data exploit exploration tools because as a node, it actually maintains a copy of

32:25.080 --> 32:31.520
the Bitcoin blockchain. And so you get to use some of the open source software to generate

32:31.520 --> 32:36.860
interesting analytics and charts and your own data on that. It also allows you to install

32:36.860 --> 32:43.000
things like, um, a wallet, a web wallet. So you could create family wallets on here. You

32:43.000 --> 32:48.040
can generate reports from the blockchain. Uh, you can install pie hole home assistant.

32:48.040 --> 32:51.120
It gives you access to all of that. And what it's doing in the background when you install

32:51.120 --> 32:56.760
these quote unquote apps is it is deploying a container and it's managing that container

32:56.760 --> 33:00.400
for you. So that's why you have to use their setup script and either use the raspberry

33:00.400 --> 33:06.500
pie image or use it on like an Ubuntu or Debian box. I tried it on tumbleweed system and their

33:06.500 --> 33:11.160
script just makes too many assumptions about a Debian system and doesn't work. But once

33:11.160 --> 33:18.160
it's up and running, it's all basically engine X and Docker. What was impressive to me was

33:18.160 --> 33:23.520
how it was linking all of those apps, right? Yeah. And it knew that you're running a node

33:23.520 --> 33:27.200
and it was pulling the information from there. So it seemed really well integrated from what

33:27.200 --> 33:33.480
we saw so far. Yeah. Everything is set up to use your own node as the source of truth

33:33.480 --> 33:38.640
for information about the Bitcoin network. And that is really nice and fast too. And

33:38.640 --> 33:41.760
they're all aware of like where its status is and stuff like that. But the other thing

33:41.760 --> 33:47.800
that's neat is there's a series of cryptocurrency wallets out there that allow you to define

33:47.800 --> 33:53.280
your own Bitcoin node too. So they'll use that for their transactions and whatnot. So

33:53.280 --> 33:58.880
it lets you deploy like a handful of really common self-hosted applications like next

33:58.880 --> 34:05.280
cloud with a handful of probably some of the best Bitcoin web based management tools. I

34:05.280 --> 34:09.800
saw Home Assistant on there. Yep. Home Assistant is on there. Matrix is on there. Element is

34:09.800 --> 34:14.280
on there. I don't think I saw a Bitwarden. Bitwarden I think is actually on there. I

34:14.280 --> 34:17.580
think it might be. Yeah. It seems like it should be. So why do you think they decided

34:17.580 --> 34:23.440
to build sort of a VM deployment platform on top and then... Container deployment platform.

34:23.440 --> 34:29.060
Yeah. Okay. Fair enough. And also to focus on these applications instead of using something

34:29.060 --> 34:34.600
that was already out there. Well, I think job one is to be a Bitcoin node, right? And

34:34.600 --> 34:38.280
so that's where it started. And then they realized because their environment was basically

34:38.280 --> 34:42.760
a series of containers that it'd be pretty easy to just pull in these other containers.

34:42.760 --> 34:45.960
And they're just pulling in like the Home Assistant's projects. It's not like their

34:45.960 --> 34:49.680
own... Fair enough. It's not that much work. Yeah. I mean, it's probably some for the integration,

34:49.680 --> 34:54.880
but it's not a ton. And then the other thing it does is if you want, it connects to the

34:54.880 --> 34:59.680
Tor network and gives you your Tor URL. So essentially you could leave it behind a NAT,

34:59.680 --> 35:03.920
leave it behind a firewall, but still connect to it to see what's going on over Tor or over

35:03.920 --> 35:12.080
your LAN. And then they monetize the project by selling this really nice looking little

35:12.080 --> 35:20.880
all aluminum Umbral server with a little display on the front of it. And if I had stupid money,

35:20.880 --> 35:24.140
I'd probably want one of these. Because I tell you, I decided to take a look at this

35:24.140 --> 35:30.040
just this last couple of days and I'm very, very impressed by it. It's really a nice little

35:30.040 --> 35:34.120
package they have. So I'm sure their little server would be pretty great too. Oh, look

35:34.120 --> 35:39.320
at that too. You can get it in different colors. Nice. That's kind of neat. How about an orange

35:39.320 --> 35:47.040
one? I'm having a hard time. Are those... Those are just kind of graphics, right? They're

35:47.040 --> 35:51.920
not actually devices. Like it's not a photo. It's a graphic that they made. I can't quite...

35:51.920 --> 35:57.480
Probably. It's hard to tell. But now that I walk up to it, I've got some, let's call

35:57.480 --> 36:04.880
it photo investigational work for you. You ready? Sure. All right. So this was taken

36:04.880 --> 36:11.120
on not a great camera. I am zoomed in quite a bit. I know. That's fine with me. But it

36:11.120 --> 36:16.800
also has some artifacts that give it away. So I will point them out for you. Okay. Here

36:16.800 --> 36:24.800
we go. So to the left. I gotta yell a bit because I don't have a microphone here. But

36:24.800 --> 36:30.200
to the left, you see where my mouse is right here? This is a piece of dust on the sensor.

36:30.200 --> 36:34.760
So they're using a DSLR. And there's another one just over here. See, it's like a smudge.

36:34.760 --> 36:38.800
They didn't even bother to take that out. Total amateurs. Another one there. Another

36:38.800 --> 36:46.440
one there. So... It's also like a little dirty spot on the... On the actual... Unit right

36:46.440 --> 36:52.200
there under the umbrella. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So it's a dirty camera. Dirty photo.

36:52.200 --> 36:57.480
Very dirty photo. But it's a real device, I think. So that's kind of cool. I wouldn't

36:57.480 --> 37:01.520
mind one of these if I was really into the whole, you know, like having a family wallet

37:01.520 --> 37:06.040
and all that kind of stuff. I'd love a banana to figure out how big that thing is. It does

37:06.040 --> 37:14.720
need a banana scale. I don't know. Sorry about the stream. I, you know... Things broke. I

37:14.720 --> 37:21.640
guess I just... What happened? You seem all deflated now. I am because you can put so

37:21.640 --> 37:25.040
much work into this kind of stuff and then just something else breaks later. So you get

37:25.040 --> 37:30.680
one thing fixed and then something else completely... Isn't that the theme of the day? And I just

37:30.680 --> 37:34.120
find a little deflating. Do you want to spin the wheel then? Yeah. I think that'd make

37:34.120 --> 37:56.960
me feel better. I think a different topic. Okay. Things Linux sucks at. Hmm. Okay. Things

37:56.960 --> 38:04.280
Linux sucks at. What do you think? What do you think Brent? I'm tempted to say cohesion.

38:04.280 --> 38:11.960
Sure. Sure. Sure. Yeah. Yep. Consensus. Sucks at consensus. That's a difficult one though.

38:11.960 --> 38:17.200
Yeah. Because it's also partly its strength. If there isn't consensus, a bunch of people

38:17.200 --> 38:22.040
go out and try to solve the same problem in different ways. And in the end, I think we

38:22.040 --> 38:26.040
end up with a better solution typically. Maybe not always. Yeah. It's a messier process.

38:26.040 --> 38:32.360
Yeah. Right. But yeah, definitely. I don't know. Mumble room or jitzy room. Anybody have

38:32.360 --> 38:39.240
a suggestion for things Linux sucks at? What does Linux suck at? Transitions. I've got

38:39.240 --> 38:45.560
the Wayland session. It's just... True. It's getting there. But everything, if you compare

38:45.560 --> 38:50.880
it to say Apple and all the file system, they make a decision and it just seems to just

38:50.880 --> 38:58.080
go through basically your comments that you've had on the whole Apple stuff. Like when you

38:58.080 --> 39:03.160
stop and you look at how long will it take before Mint is on Wayland and Pipewire? What's

39:03.160 --> 39:07.760
that timeline going to look like? It's going to be a while. Do you have any predictions?

39:07.760 --> 39:13.360
I think a couple of years minimum. Sucks at supporting fingerprint readers. That is often

39:13.360 --> 39:19.080
a problem. On my ThinkPad, I'm happy to report on my ThinkPad X1, it has been very good now.

39:19.080 --> 39:22.880
So it is getting better there. Also, you can suggest a topic for the wheel. We're getting

39:22.880 --> 39:27.560
down to the final three topics. So if you want to put something on there to keep the

39:27.560 --> 39:34.200
stream going, suggest in the chat room or in the jitzy mumble room. Things that Linux

39:34.200 --> 39:40.520
sucks at. Things that Linux sucks at. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, this drives me crazy. Multiple

39:40.520 --> 39:43.640
external monitors at different resolutions and refresh rates. Have we not figured this

39:43.640 --> 39:47.240
out yet? It just stinks. Just stinks. Are there any distributions that are better at

39:47.240 --> 39:52.920
this than others? No, there are window managers that are better at this. I just have to mention

39:52.920 --> 40:00.960
enlightenment as always. I didn't see that coming. I didn't think you'd say that. Oh

40:00.960 --> 40:10.720
man. Yeah. I just tested that one. I was at my second residence and they have a USB 2 monitor.

40:10.720 --> 40:17.000
And then I have to connect that one. I need a little script to make it run. But with GNOME

40:17.000 --> 40:23.320
three, it doesn't run at all with enlightenment. It just pop ups. It pops up a second screen

40:23.320 --> 40:32.040
and you can configure it easily and it remembers your configuration. It just works. That does

40:32.040 --> 40:39.240
sound nice. That does sound nice. I will have to eventually break down and give it a go.

40:39.240 --> 40:44.360
Things that Linux sucks at things that Linux sucks at. Video editing. Okay, yeah, sure.

40:44.360 --> 40:53.080
Go ahead. Deep learning on NVIDIA cards. Oh, interesting. I thought that was actually kind

40:53.080 --> 40:59.760
of a big area. You just saying it's bad at it. Well, once you get the NVIDIA card working,

40:59.760 --> 41:05.360
but then every update, you know, it just breaks. Right. Yeah. I feel like it's NVIDIA that's

41:05.360 --> 41:13.160
the problem there. Yeah, right. Right. I mean, GPUs in general. Anything GPU with NVIDIA.

41:13.160 --> 41:17.560
Yeah. I mean, that's a big point. Like, why? Why is it so terrible at GPUs? It's kind of

41:17.560 --> 41:23.880
not our fault, maybe. Well, here's where we so here's where we get stuck a lot. I could

41:23.880 --> 41:29.360
be wrong about this, but I think a lot of times it's there's a bigger ecosystem that's

41:29.360 --> 41:34.400
pushing people to use these tooling and we're just not particularly good at it. Like CUDA

41:34.400 --> 41:40.960
is an ecosystem. It is a whole frickin thing. It's one of NVIDIA's most, I think, savage

41:40.960 --> 41:46.640
moves in the industry is really building out dependency on CUDA because CUDA only works

41:46.640 --> 41:50.480
on NVIDIA cards. And so I think that's got to play a role. Right. If you don't if you

41:50.480 --> 41:54.840
don't have first class CUDA support, then you're kind of SOL if your CUDA support is

41:54.840 --> 41:59.640
fragile like the Mac has no CUDA support. And so you have entire industries that just

41:59.640 --> 42:05.600
avoid buying Macs because of that. It's that kind of kind of an ecosystem. Well, I can

42:05.600 --> 42:11.720
say something to that. I mean, I'm a software developer and I've done implemented CUDA numerous

42:11.720 --> 42:22.160
times. The CUDA libraries per se on Linux work first class in any with any programming

42:22.160 --> 42:29.920
language I've used. It's just the it's just the driver support and NVIDIA's policy on

42:29.920 --> 42:40.040
pushing up, pushing updates which just break everything. That is frustrating, isn't it?

42:40.040 --> 42:46.160
I just set up my son's laptop on Fedora over the weekend and then did an update and it

42:46.160 --> 42:50.840
broke his NVIDIA driver and he had to leave and I just didn't get it working before he

42:50.840 --> 42:56.920
got before he had to go. And so he has it. It's as a you know, a nice Ryzen integrated

42:56.920 --> 43:04.320
GPU, so he's fine. But it's frustrating because it was working and then it broke there at

43:04.320 --> 43:10.160
the end and I ran out of time to fix it. And I don't know, you know, and it's particularly

43:10.160 --> 43:16.440
rough on Fedora because historically their NVIDIA GPU supports been bad. And so as a

43:16.440 --> 43:24.840
result, there's 50 different ways and a thousand different guides on how you should install

43:24.840 --> 43:29.680
the NVIDIA driver. And they are all very version specific. So and it's different with the later

43:29.680 --> 43:33.840
versions and it is the older versions. But there's so much momentum on that stuff. So

43:33.840 --> 43:37.460
that's maybe an area that Linux sucks at there is and that's something the Linus Tech Tips

43:37.460 --> 43:43.680
videos touched on, too, is like. There's thousands of guides out there and most of them are no

43:43.680 --> 43:49.200
longer applicable, but yet they're still relevant in Google search. And then there's also just

43:49.200 --> 43:54.680
like tons of blogs and like distro rundowns and shootouts that are just nonsensical and

43:54.680 --> 43:58.160
totally not based on reality. And that's a problem, too.

43:58.160 --> 44:01.120
I have another one. Monetization.

44:01.120 --> 44:05.920
Yep. That's definitely an issue which leads to developer burnout. It leads to people having

44:05.920 --> 44:10.240
to get other work and it leads to our best talent getting basically sucked into large

44:10.240 --> 44:15.160
corporations that can pay people. And then it's corporate controlled and centralized.

44:15.160 --> 44:19.440
Not to mention how precarious it is to have these projects be on the brink of failure,

44:19.440 --> 44:22.440
financial failure, and they're propping everything else up.

44:22.440 --> 44:29.040
And think about how stressful that is on a person over five, 10, 15 years to live that

44:29.040 --> 44:36.720
long in a financially precarious position, feeling like you have this community to support

44:36.720 --> 44:42.800
and people using your software and a responsibility to that plus your name, but also at the same

44:42.800 --> 44:49.720
time not getting enough to actually financially thrive and just to have to kind of barely

44:49.720 --> 44:54.880
get by. It can be rough on a person and we don't have a solution for that and it keeps

44:54.880 --> 45:00.820
biting us in the ass in sometimes really large ways like log4j and sometimes in really small

45:00.820 --> 45:06.400
ways that we don't even really realize. It just sort of gets priced into the desktop.

45:06.400 --> 45:10.800
Feels like every six months we see the same story come up just with a different project.

45:10.800 --> 45:15.240
And mini Mac, of course, there's a classic area where Linux is weaker at.

45:15.240 --> 45:21.560
Yeah, that's my general approach. So if people switch to Linux, the first thing they see

45:21.560 --> 45:27.720
is that there are missing apps they have to adapt their workflow because they can't do

45:27.720 --> 45:33.080
things like they're used to do it. But after time it becomes a strong part of Linux because

45:33.080 --> 45:39.040
you can adapt your workflow exactly the way you want to do it because on the Windows normally

45:39.040 --> 45:45.720
you just have some apps and you combine these apps for your workflow and then really working

45:45.720 --> 45:51.520
over your workflow and adapting it to Linux becomes a strong part in the end and then

45:51.520 --> 45:58.000
often you're faster and you're getting used to it and you don't want to go back. But it

45:58.000 --> 46:02.600
takes some time. It takes some time. You really have to dig into it for the first month and

46:02.600 --> 46:07.240
then you start smiling and you never stop smiling, right?

46:07.240 --> 46:12.600
I wouldn't say that's necessarily a downside to the Linux ecosystem itself because let's

46:12.600 --> 46:15.960
say you reverse things and you were on Linux and you got a new job and you had to move

46:15.960 --> 46:21.920
to Windows, which has happened to me. It's just as painful. I would argue it's more painful

46:21.920 --> 46:25.520
to try to find the things you need in that ecosystem.

46:25.520 --> 46:32.600
Yeah, I was going to say that because I started using Windows for work after 10 years.

46:32.600 --> 46:40.800
I'm sorry. I started using Windows for work after 10

46:40.800 --> 46:49.840
years and it's really hard on me. I mean, you really need to work yourself again.

46:49.840 --> 46:54.520
We need a Windows support group. You know, the dangerous thing about Windows

46:54.520 --> 46:59.720
is I have to really reinforce this with Dylan whenever it goes into the Windows side of

46:59.720 --> 47:03.840
his install. It's like you really need to be careful what you're downloading because

47:03.840 --> 47:07.960
he goes to like download stuff from Minecraft and three out of the four links are scams.

47:07.960 --> 47:10.920
It's a landmine everywhere. I forgot about that.

47:10.920 --> 47:15.120
That's bad. So anyways, moving on. Now that we've come

47:15.120 --> 47:19.040
complete circle and gotten back to what Linux is good at, let's spin the wheel again. I

47:19.040 --> 47:21.400
added a last minute topic. Did you really?

47:21.400 --> 47:24.960
Yeah. I hope this is the last one, but we'll see. It's why Linux will win at all at the

47:24.960 --> 47:29.520
end, like 20 years down the road. Well, okay. When that comes up, I'll get right into it.

47:29.520 --> 47:33.000
All right. So are we ready to spin it again? I feel ready.

47:33.000 --> 47:37.500
Okay, here we go. I want to mention one thing. One overarching

47:37.500 --> 47:43.200
theme is that Linux just sucks at running proprietary software in general. You're complaining

47:43.200 --> 47:48.800
about people not being able to use certain applications or the Nvidia proprietary drivers

47:48.800 --> 47:53.640
terrible that kind of seem to be the overarching theme is Linux isn't great at running proprietary

47:53.640 --> 47:56.060
software. It's true, but that's not always true. Like

47:56.060 --> 47:59.800
reapers running just fine. Yeah, some user land stuff. It's better in the user land.

47:59.800 --> 48:04.800
The deeper into the stack it goes, the more trouble it causes. All right, here we go.

48:04.800 --> 48:15.800
Oh, I'm going to spin it again. I want to save that one for the end. I want to end on

48:15.800 --> 48:31.440
the day. Here we go. Here we go. Come on. Keep it going. Oh, you're looking at me like

48:31.440 --> 48:35.600
why did we have this? No, no. I mean, I'm sure people have written in and asked, right?

48:35.600 --> 48:40.960
Well, yes. And also it inspired me last time when we were talking flat packs and just to

48:40.960 --> 48:47.400
hear I was William was his name. I forget now, but he was running. He's the software,

48:47.400 --> 48:51.280
the head software guy at Endless. Do you remember we had an interview with him and he was saying,

48:51.280 --> 48:58.640
oh, I'm running 174. Yep. Yep. I read a lot about Endless, but maybe like four years ago.

48:58.640 --> 49:03.120
And it sounds like they've done some interesting technological choices to help them achieve

49:03.120 --> 49:11.480
their goals. And it just got me interested. Like I didn't expect them to be so front of

49:11.480 --> 49:15.520
the technology stack maybe is the way to put it. But it sounds like it's really working

49:15.520 --> 49:20.680
for them. So I just got really curious into how far they've come in some of what they're

49:20.680 --> 49:24.680
trying to do. And I've known some people who've known some people who've worked there and

49:24.680 --> 49:28.840
I've said some really nice things. So I thought, hey, let's dig in. I know I've noticed in

49:28.840 --> 49:34.920
like the GNOME and GTK commits that there's almost always several Endless staff, one or

49:34.920 --> 49:38.280
two Endless members. That's good to know. Yeah. They're pretty active contributors.

49:38.280 --> 49:45.340
Nice. They seem to get they seem to be getting fairly along fairly well with GNOME developers.

49:45.340 --> 49:51.360
That's an achievement. Yep. And I've never really gone more than 15, maybe 20 minutes

49:51.360 --> 49:56.160
with it. When they first came along, they were first very hardware focused. OK. And

49:56.160 --> 50:00.540
now they've kind of pivoted to the software. And I think that's a good idea. When I first

50:00.540 --> 50:03.680
interviewed them, they were actually really kind of pitching at schools and prisons. I

50:03.680 --> 50:10.360
remember that. Yeah. But I kind of feel like now that they've now that they've had this

50:10.360 --> 50:14.280
new focus for about a year, it's probably time for a revisit. But what I can't what

50:14.280 --> 50:18.960
I can't suss out is if there's interest in the audience or not. I can't tell. I'm not

50:18.960 --> 50:25.660
sure it's focused on us as an audience. And though I wondered, could it be focused on

50:25.660 --> 50:30.520
some of our children, for instance? So I recommended to my co-host on Coder Radio, Mike, that he

50:30.520 --> 50:33.840
was looking for a Linux OS for his kid. And I said, well, if you're not going to go with

50:33.840 --> 50:38.360
the desktop OS that you use, you know, which is pop, then I think maybe you should consider

50:38.360 --> 50:43.520
Endless. I'd say my first choice would be go deploy whatever OS you're comfortable using

50:43.520 --> 50:48.920
and use the most often. And then my second would be something like Endless or another

50:48.920 --> 50:54.280
OS that's that's really kind of curated like this. So I think it's it's another one like

50:54.280 --> 50:56.960
along with cubes, we should really give it a go.

50:56.960 --> 51:03.760
You know, I remember, I'm remembering now when I was looking up brunch guests, that

51:03.760 --> 51:07.400
they now I don't want to get this too wrong, but I'm just gonna throw it out there. Maybe

51:07.400 --> 51:13.400
we could someone can have a look. I remember that there was a project that was focused

51:13.400 --> 51:22.360
on sharing coding experiences with kids, sometimes even toddlers. And it was connected to Endless.

51:22.360 --> 51:25.860
Sure. Yeah, there's a bunch of tools that ships with like that. Yeah, I would imagine

51:25.860 --> 51:29.240
there's a nice partnership there. And it makes a lot of sense because like one of the first

51:29.240 --> 51:33.120
images they have on their website is a bunch of kids looking at a laptop. So that sort

51:33.120 --> 51:38.760
of makes sense to me. Look at their download images here. Desktop computer, virtual machine,

51:38.760 --> 51:48.760
Raspberry Pi, Pinebook Pro. That's what I mean. It seems like they're really tied into

51:48.760 --> 51:52.320
what's going on. There's a Pinebook Pro behind you. We could put it on. Oh, hello. We should

51:52.320 --> 51:58.200
try it. We should try it on the Pinebook Pro. All right. You know, it needs a good job.

51:58.200 --> 52:03.040
Pinebook Pro is almost in that sweet spot for me, but not quite, you know. Any other

52:03.040 --> 52:08.320
thoughts on Endless from anybody in the virtual lugs before we go? Virtual lugs? The thing

52:08.320 --> 52:14.000
that might not make it great for children is that computing is really social for them.

52:14.000 --> 52:17.760
That's true. I mean, you could put it on the Internet, right? You could get it. You're

52:17.760 --> 52:23.840
thinking like applications or games? Applications and games. Like I moved in with my significant

52:23.840 --> 52:27.120
other who has two kids. I'm like, oh, I'll switch the kids to Linux. And then I realized

52:27.120 --> 52:31.000
all they do is play games that run terribly on Linux.

52:31.000 --> 52:38.880
Yeah, yeah, yeah. And of course, like Microsoft's a big part of that. I mean, like Bedrock is

52:38.880 --> 52:45.840
so you can you there. There was a way to get it running on Linux, but the maintainer of

52:45.840 --> 52:53.280
the Flatpak for Bedrock Edition just bailed, just noped out. So that's gone now. They pulled

52:53.280 --> 52:54.600
it from Flat Hub. What is it?

52:54.600 --> 52:57.560
Well, I'm just browsing their website here while you're talking and I found some cool

52:57.560 --> 52:58.560
stuff.

52:58.560 --> 52:59.560
What is it?

52:59.560 --> 53:00.560
You closed the website.

53:00.560 --> 53:01.560
Oh, I did. I was going to move on.

53:01.560 --> 53:07.280
They also have this experiment that is exactly what I was talking about called the Hack Computer.

53:07.280 --> 53:13.880
And it's both building the hardware and the software. So they have it sounds like what

53:13.880 --> 53:18.600
they call an endless key. Hack is included within the new endless key USB project. Offline

53:18.600 --> 53:23.040
kids can plug in the key and they're ready to play hack. So hack, I think, is like a

53:23.040 --> 53:27.080
gamified version of learning.

53:27.080 --> 53:28.080
Is this what you're talking about?

53:28.080 --> 53:30.360
I think it might be.

53:30.360 --> 53:34.960
So hack is included in the endless key product. The complete hack experience now comes on

53:34.960 --> 53:41.440
the new endless key USB. So offline kids can plug in and they're ready to play hack.

53:41.440 --> 53:44.200
There's hack-computer or try-hack-computer.

53:44.200 --> 53:53.440
That's where I'm at is I'm right now at hack-computer.com. What is hack?

53:53.440 --> 53:55.680
Go to try.hack-computer.com.

53:55.680 --> 53:58.520
Try, okay, what now?

53:58.520 --> 54:05.000
Try dot and then just the URL you're at.

54:05.000 --> 54:11.880
Try dot. So instead of www, try.hack-computer what? Then what?

54:11.880 --> 54:12.880
Then just nothing.

54:12.880 --> 54:20.520
Oh, okay. Of course. And survey says load. Oh, there it goes. What are these, NFTs?

54:20.520 --> 54:21.520
How did you know?

54:21.520 --> 54:22.520
What am I looking at?

54:22.520 --> 54:26.320
I don't know. It says like pick a dimension to explore. And so just, I don't know, look

54:26.320 --> 54:30.880
like you got processing, sidetrack, web tech, engineering, endless OS, terminal T.

54:30.880 --> 54:38.240
I'm going to pick endless OS. Who we got there? Who is that? Who's coming in right now?

54:38.240 --> 54:39.240
Is that Nancy?

54:39.240 --> 54:43.520
It might have been hack-computer. This is too much, man. I'm already bored.

54:43.520 --> 54:48.720
All right. Well, it's not targeted at you clearly. Oh, I see.

54:48.720 --> 54:53.280
Hack laptop. The laptop that allows kids ages 10 plus to learn to code by hacking their

54:53.280 --> 54:57.960
own device. A high-performance award-winning laptop. The hack utilizes a 14-inch ASUS

54:57.960 --> 55:03.560
E4060MA laptop to deliver the world's only completely hackable computer. Note that this

55:03.560 --> 55:05.800
computer must be purchased through the hack to access the hack experience.

55:05.800 --> 55:11.080
Okay. This is more disappointing than I thought. It's just a bunch of links to a bunch of projects.

55:11.080 --> 55:12.080
They make it look good though, right?

55:12.080 --> 55:15.160
Well, they had me. They definitely had me.

55:15.160 --> 55:20.460
I mean, they got a good look going. I think they're worth taking more seriously or spending

55:20.460 --> 55:21.460
more time with.

55:21.460 --> 55:22.460
Yeah, I agree.

55:22.460 --> 55:25.440
I just haven't got a good strong sense of the audience's interest, but maybe they'll

55:25.440 --> 55:26.780
let us know.

55:26.780 --> 55:30.400
Any other EndlessOS thoughts before we spin the wheel?

55:30.400 --> 55:37.440
Well, the EndlessKey, that is just a USB drive that you can plug in any computer.

55:37.440 --> 55:38.440
That's what it looked like.

55:38.440 --> 55:39.440
Yeah.

55:39.440 --> 55:40.440
Yeah.

55:40.440 --> 55:41.440
Yeah.

55:41.440 --> 55:42.440
Yeah.

55:42.440 --> 55:43.440
And play hack.

55:43.440 --> 55:44.440
All right. Okay.

55:44.440 --> 55:45.440
EndlessOS.org slash key.

55:45.440 --> 55:52.280
I mean, it's a 128 gig USB drive and there's something there.

55:52.280 --> 55:53.920
Hey, maybe it's high quality and it's branded.

55:53.920 --> 55:55.960
It says high quality in the description. How'd you know?

55:55.960 --> 56:03.880
Hell, I had a sense, man. I had a sense. All right. Just a few more topics on the Wheel

56:03.880 --> 56:06.480
of Topics today and then our stream is going to be over.

56:06.480 --> 56:08.740
So what are the options before you turn it?

56:08.740 --> 56:10.240
Brent's Docker Jellyfin Beginnings.

56:10.240 --> 56:11.240
Oh, here we go.

56:11.240 --> 56:15.200
Cloud Virtual Desktops and why Linux will win it all in 20 years.

56:15.200 --> 56:16.200
You ready?

56:16.200 --> 56:21.200
This is going to be fun.

56:21.200 --> 56:22.200
Spinning.

56:22.200 --> 56:27.480
I wanted to save that one, but we'll just do it now because there's just no avoiding

56:27.480 --> 56:35.080
it. There's no avoiding it. Why Linux will win it all. This just proves you can't control

56:35.080 --> 56:36.080
the wheel.

56:36.080 --> 56:37.080
I think the wheel is rigged.

56:37.080 --> 56:42.680
You can't control the wheel. All right. So why Linux will win it all in 20 years. What

56:42.680 --> 56:46.880
do you think? What is it about Linux that means it's going to make it so it'll win it

56:46.880 --> 56:48.440
all in 20 years? What is it?

56:48.440 --> 56:54.440
OK, well, I see it is also still remote change. It will always exist.

56:54.440 --> 56:58.440
Is that right? There's no commercial interest. It's going to be like, well, we didn't make

56:58.440 --> 57:01.840
enough in the Linux division this year. That's never going to happen.

57:01.840 --> 57:04.880
So when all the economies crash, it'll still be around. That's what you're saying.

57:04.880 --> 57:10.520
I've always felt like over time, companies will focus on something else. Their attention

57:10.520 --> 57:16.320
will be diverted and like things like Windows and Mac OS will be around for a while, but

57:16.320 --> 57:20.240
not forever. They'll be these companies will eventually do something else like Nintendo

57:20.240 --> 57:25.240
used to be a trading card company 100 years ago. Right. And Linux will be here when those

57:25.240 --> 57:29.660
companies decide they're leaving the market and it'll just be better than ever. Whenever

57:29.660 --> 57:36.200
that happens, I think it's sort of like how in the very early days, in the late 70s, in

57:36.200 --> 57:43.640
the early 80s, they already had TCP IP figured out. It was already known, but you still had

57:43.640 --> 57:51.720
IPX. You had net buoy. You had Apple talk. You had all these other standards and protocols

57:51.720 --> 57:58.000
that came out that were not TCP IP. They were corporate owned and they survived for a while.

57:58.000 --> 58:03.080
Like there were a mini IPX networks and a lot of Apple talk networks and some net buoy

58:03.080 --> 58:09.960
networks unfortunately. And the reality is TCP IP ate it all. Eventually those vendors

58:09.960 --> 58:14.720
had other strategies. They wanted to participate in the Internet. Their corporate strategies

58:14.720 --> 58:19.280
changed and all of a sudden they needed networking protocols that could route that could go out

58:19.280 --> 58:24.080
to the public Internet. And so they transitioned from having their interest in these proprietary

58:24.080 --> 58:32.640
protocols to using the open standard that is TCP IP. And I think that same kind of just

58:32.640 --> 58:39.360
it just makes business sense kind of thinking will eventually cause Linux to consume everything.

58:39.360 --> 58:45.200
It is the Borg. Resistance is futile. You can you can delay it, but it will come for

58:45.200 --> 58:51.200
you. I love that. That's my thoughts. It feels like we're on a trajectory and you can kind

58:51.200 --> 58:59.500
of see it trending quite heavily in some areas. So I'm curious if you're going to predict

58:59.500 --> 59:02.400
what's going to happen in the next 20 years, you kind of got to look at what's happened

59:02.400 --> 59:08.360
in the last 20 years. Sure. So I know on the server side of things, it's gone fairly well,

59:08.360 --> 59:13.440
but like 20 years in the desktop space, a heck of a lot has changed. Yeah, I mean, I

59:13.440 --> 59:19.920
think it's sort of as markets change, Linux gets used in a spot where it wasn't used previously.

59:19.920 --> 59:28.060
So if you look at the world before Android, it was all kinds of different OS's and real

59:28.060 --> 59:32.440
time OS's and attempts at that. And there was all kinds of different solutions for that.

59:32.440 --> 59:36.820
Some made by the chip makers themselves, some that were made by community, some that were

59:36.820 --> 59:41.920
made by that hardware manufacturer and just use specifically on their own devices. And

59:41.920 --> 59:47.680
then there's the post Android world and Tivo world where you just start with your device

59:47.680 --> 59:51.960
using Linux. That's the base operating system, because when you use Linux, the kernel, you're

59:51.960 --> 59:55.680
also going to get networking, you're going to get device driver support, you're going

59:55.680 --> 01:00:01.880
to get hardware platform support, SOC support, you're going to get all these all these things

01:00:01.880 --> 01:00:05.600
now that it takes to run a tech stack that you would have to implement yourself, that

01:00:05.600 --> 01:00:11.040
it just becomes a literal impossibility. So you just use Linux now and you build on top

01:00:11.040 --> 01:00:18.480
of that. And that's sort of that wasn't true 11 years ago. And now it's a universal truth.

01:00:18.480 --> 01:00:22.800
And I think that is what will happen in other markets and other areas just as that same

01:00:22.800 --> 01:00:27.960
exact thing is what happened on the server. You know, when I started in the industry,

01:00:27.960 --> 01:00:34.040
Linux was looked at as a risk. It was considered an IP risk. The people that built Linux were

01:00:34.040 --> 01:00:37.520
freeloaders, hippies that likely weren't going to stick around with anything. These distros

01:00:37.520 --> 01:00:42.480
were fly by nights that could disappear on you at any moment. You would be silly to deploy

01:00:42.480 --> 01:00:49.240
anything but something like Windows or Solaris. And and it was considered an amateur thing

01:00:49.240 --> 01:00:52.960
that you would never use on a server. Now it's the de facto server operating system

01:00:52.960 --> 01:01:00.600
around the world, so much so that even companies like Microsoft and Apple deploy it themselves

01:01:00.600 --> 01:01:05.400
in their own servers. So it just shows you how things can change over time. And I imagine

01:01:05.400 --> 01:01:11.380
the desktop, the reason why it hasn't, the reason why it hasn't conquered the desktop

01:01:11.380 --> 01:01:14.940
is because the market doesn't need it to right now. The business interests don't need it

01:01:14.940 --> 01:01:20.880
to. Like it's not until businesses acting in their own self-interest align with using

01:01:20.880 --> 01:01:23.940
Linux. Like look what happened with Microsoft and their adoption of open source. It was

01:01:23.940 --> 01:01:29.480
Linux is a cancer until all of a sudden they realized, well hold on, we want to be big

01:01:29.480 --> 01:01:33.080
in the cloud and we want to be big with developers. Now we love Linux. Now look at all this stuff

01:01:33.080 --> 01:01:37.200
we're open sourcing. Now our terminal is open source. Now we're doing this in open source.

01:01:37.200 --> 01:01:43.120
Look at our subsystem, right? It's like it's not, it's not, it wasn't an ideological shift.

01:01:43.120 --> 01:01:46.000
It was a business shift that caused the adoption.

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:52.320
Yeah, we've talked some in the past and even I think in predictions a few years ago about

01:01:52.320 --> 01:01:58.460
Windows running Linux under the hood. And that feels to me like it is a real possibility

01:01:58.460 --> 01:02:02.360
and could make business sense for them in some ways.

01:02:02.360 --> 01:02:08.720
Especially if it was basically a thin client platform that connected you to a cloud desktop

01:02:08.720 --> 01:02:14.640
that they run on Azure. And they charge your business $5 a month for you to get access

01:02:14.640 --> 01:02:16.080
to it or $10 a month.

01:02:16.080 --> 01:02:19.720
That'd be an interesting place for them to actually test that without needing to drop

01:02:19.720 --> 01:02:21.280
Windows right away actually.

01:02:21.280 --> 01:02:26.200
All right. Does anybody else have a reason why Linux will win it all in 20 years?

01:02:26.200 --> 01:02:32.140
The switch to services revenue. So you can't make money selling an operating system anymore.

01:02:32.140 --> 01:02:37.600
So why would you spend all the man hours to maintain it? So if Windows could make that

01:02:37.600 --> 01:02:42.560
compatibility layer, why wouldn't they just maintain or help maintain Linux rather than

01:02:42.560 --> 01:02:48.100
have to maintain the 30 years of technical debt that is Microsoft Windows?

01:02:48.100 --> 01:02:55.360
Flip that around for a moment. Imagine that Apple or Microsoft hasn't invested 35 years

01:02:55.360 --> 01:02:59.440
in a desktop platform and they were launching as a business today and they wanted to get

01:02:59.440 --> 01:03:05.120
into Azure or iCloud or services, Apple wanted to be a TV company and a phone company. Would

01:03:05.120 --> 01:03:06.600
they even fucking bother?

01:03:06.600 --> 01:03:09.200
No, that would be crazy, right?

01:03:09.200 --> 01:03:14.980
Yeah. The only reason you would actually, you might roll your own kind of distro because

01:03:14.980 --> 01:03:18.120
you need some things that it doesn't provide.

01:03:18.120 --> 01:03:23.720
But you would end up with a lot more things like Amazon Linux.

01:03:23.720 --> 01:03:25.520
Yeah, for sure, for sure.

01:03:25.520 --> 01:03:29.280
Minimac, you think maybe it won't actually make it to the 20 year milestone it sounds

01:03:29.280 --> 01:03:30.280
like?

01:03:30.280 --> 01:03:37.080
Well, the question is, will there be Linux in 20 years? Will there be a successor like

01:03:37.080 --> 01:03:45.800
a running hood kernel? So I think Linux already won in regard that the new system and open

01:03:45.800 --> 01:03:54.240
source and projects around that have Linux opened the way to these and these will survive.

01:03:54.240 --> 01:04:00.760
But maybe we will have another kernel, a different kernel, just a different base and we will,

01:04:00.760 --> 01:04:09.000
I mean open source and Linux using open source has changed the world. Now, I can live with

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:15.960
another kernel base, but the open source environment, the new system, everything like that, that's

01:04:15.960 --> 01:04:22.160
the most important thing. And that's what I depend on and that will survive, I think.

01:04:22.160 --> 01:04:25.280
And so I say Linux has already won in some regard.

01:04:25.280 --> 01:04:26.280
Nice.

01:04:26.280 --> 01:04:31.800
It's true. It's now we just got to sit back and watch it all happen. All right. Two more

01:04:31.800 --> 01:04:35.600
topics on the wheel. You ready, Brent? Should we spin it?

01:04:35.600 --> 01:04:43.760
I think I'm ready. Go for it. That sounds different. Okay, you touched on this just

01:04:43.760 --> 01:04:44.920
briefly here with Microsoft.

01:04:44.920 --> 01:04:51.280
I did. This is kind of perfect, isn't it? So cloud virtual desktops. Are they actually

01:04:51.280 --> 01:04:52.280
useful?

01:04:52.280 --> 01:04:56.880
That's the real question. So I got kind of curious about this maybe a month ago. If you

01:04:56.880 --> 01:05:01.560
remember, there was a slight period of time there where my internet was just total crap.

01:05:01.560 --> 01:05:05.560
It's gotten slightly better and I don't know why. And I'm fine with that.

01:05:05.560 --> 01:05:06.560
The moon.

01:05:06.560 --> 01:05:07.560
Right.

01:05:07.560 --> 01:05:08.800
That's what I blame it on.

01:05:08.800 --> 01:05:09.800
It's tides or something.

01:05:09.800 --> 01:05:13.400
Yeah. How did that work? How do they work?

01:05:13.400 --> 01:05:18.760
And so I know this on the surface may sound like a non solution for me because like if

01:05:18.760 --> 01:05:25.840
you have bad internet, a cloud hosted desktop doesn't make any sense. But I have some competing

01:05:25.840 --> 01:05:31.360
priorities here because for me, I don't really have any super performant computers that I'm

01:05:31.360 --> 01:05:36.720
willing to use on a daily basis. I have a few laptops that I've bought and probably

01:05:36.720 --> 01:05:42.680
the newest one is an x250. But it's kind of loud. I don't like that. And so

01:05:42.680 --> 01:05:46.560
That's not necessarily the best time to pick up new hardware either.

01:05:46.560 --> 01:05:54.040
No, definitely. And so there's I got really curious about offloading hardware expenses

01:05:54.040 --> 01:05:59.720
on to this is basically a subscription hardware service really if you look at it that way.

01:05:59.720 --> 01:06:06.840
But I wondered I saw a few other resources talking about oh yeah, this is great. Like

01:06:06.840 --> 01:06:10.240
you can totally do this. It's good for people who don't have that much money to put on hardware

01:06:10.240 --> 01:06:16.600
etc etc. But I just wondered is this more of a toy and not something people can actually

01:06:16.600 --> 01:06:23.040
use someone like me like maybe corporate stuff. It makes a lot of sense because they can orchestrate

01:06:23.040 --> 01:06:28.240
this in a really seamless way. But for someone like me who just sort of wants to get some

01:06:28.240 --> 01:06:36.760
things done. Does it make any sense? Right. Yeah. And because there are some clear advantages.

01:06:36.760 --> 01:06:40.640
One of them is price I think. Well and the other thing that's always lovely about them

01:06:40.640 --> 01:06:44.800
is they're generally in a data center. So they have just like a screaming internet connection.

01:06:44.800 --> 01:06:47.900
Well OK fair enough. That's that's why it got interesting to me in the first place was

01:06:47.900 --> 01:06:54.200
like maybe I could just download or upload you know my flax from there and just have

01:06:54.200 --> 01:06:57.880
them. Yeah. Then you would never complain to me about my drop connections and such.

01:06:57.880 --> 01:07:04.160
But see that's where they're also very weak is I think the number one issue is latency

01:07:04.160 --> 01:07:09.460
in the remote screen updates. They've they've gotten it really good but you know it's still

01:07:09.460 --> 01:07:13.400
not the same. And then and especially when you're looking like a waveform that's scrolling

01:07:13.400 --> 01:07:17.200
across the screen that's an area where it's going to be particularly bad. Or your mouse.

01:07:17.200 --> 01:07:22.480
I know you're sensitive with your mouse. Sure. But the other thing is is like very few of

01:07:22.480 --> 01:07:26.480
them are going to come back and like take a local USB device and bring it forward to

01:07:26.480 --> 01:07:30.040
a cloud connection. Some of them will but those are the nicer more expensive ones. Generally

01:07:30.040 --> 01:07:35.320
they're using Windows. But that seems essential to me. Like if you couldn't plug in a keyboard

01:07:35.320 --> 01:07:41.680
or like OK maybe keyboards bad example but something like an audio device like. Yeah.

01:07:41.680 --> 01:07:45.120
Maybe it's just our audience. I think we plug in. We try a lot of things that most users

01:07:45.120 --> 01:07:49.680
don't. But well that's also the only demographic I could see who's been willing to try this.

01:07:49.680 --> 01:07:56.080
I feel like it's getting worked out now. I think in a way like these cloud gaming services

01:07:56.080 --> 01:08:01.840
are doing us a solid in that they're sorting out how do I bring a USB input device forward

01:08:01.840 --> 01:08:08.400
in a low latency way and how do I get this really high performance application down to

01:08:08.400 --> 01:08:16.040
them as fast as possible with the lowest latency. And if I could use the NVIDIA GeForce streaming

01:08:16.040 --> 01:08:21.880
service just to get a desktop I probably would. So you know they're legitimately on the GeForce

01:08:21.880 --> 01:08:26.120
now streaming service. They're spinning up Windows VMs loading steam or they have like

01:08:26.120 --> 01:08:30.000
a Windows VM image with steam pre-installed. But sometimes there's updates that need to

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:35.440
be applied. Then you log into your steam account like it brings you in you log into steam and

01:08:35.440 --> 01:08:39.760
then it downloads the frickin game in their data center nice installs it on that VM they've

01:08:39.760 --> 01:08:45.200
just created and then launches the game. So you can see how there are clearly some advantages

01:08:45.200 --> 01:08:49.080
and it's very tempting. But then there are these subtle roadblocks that I think we need

01:08:49.080 --> 01:08:53.200
to get over before that's even useful. I wish they would just I wish they would sell you

01:08:53.200 --> 01:08:59.280
a desktop service. They've built it for gaming but they clearly could deliver a desktop experience

01:08:59.280 --> 01:09:04.080
because you're often in a desktop experience until the game launches. And I'd love like

01:09:04.080 --> 01:09:07.880
we wanted to figure out a way to run OBS in the cloud. Yeah right. So we all just connect

01:09:07.880 --> 01:09:12.320
into that. I thought that'd be really great. All right I see we have a few takes in there

01:09:12.320 --> 01:09:16.160
Mini Mac I wanted to let you jump in first and then we'll get to Rob and then Gerald

01:09:16.160 --> 01:09:22.040
so go ahead Mini Mac. Yeah I think I don't have anything to add you just nailed it. I

01:09:22.040 --> 01:09:26.520
mean I mentioned cloud gaming I mentioned cloud gaming I think this is to stop if you

01:09:26.520 --> 01:09:33.040
have cloud gaming you can have a virtual desktop and everything just have a an application

01:09:33.040 --> 01:09:40.640
on your system that loads in that cloud instance and then you can use your computer in a cloud.

01:09:40.640 --> 01:09:48.400
Yeah that would be great. Gerald did you want to jump in on oh development in the cloud.

01:09:48.400 --> 01:09:55.640
That's a good idea. Yeah thanks. So I lead a software development team at the company

01:09:55.640 --> 01:10:05.040
and we so so for onboarding new developers it always takes like ages to till they have

01:10:05.040 --> 01:10:11.320
their IDE stuff set up and so on. Sure. So I was I was really like thinking like if we

01:10:11.320 --> 01:10:18.800
could have we could just say okay we do our business in in our own cloud right. So here's

01:10:18.800 --> 01:10:27.640
our standardized desktop. Here's you work on a thin client thing and what and your IDE

01:10:27.640 --> 01:10:34.920
is in the desktop and it's already auto configured anything the build system is auto configured

01:10:34.920 --> 01:10:42.520
right. That would be like great. Like I looked into something like I don't know you mentioned

01:10:42.520 --> 01:10:51.800
it once on last guacamole. Oh yeah sure. Yeah that's all. That's exactly pretty much all

01:10:51.800 --> 01:10:59.720
I we where I work that was possibly sort of like DevOps team to build it. We have because

01:10:59.720 --> 01:11:06.160
of a bunch of requirements and networking issues that we can't install stuff on our

01:11:06.160 --> 01:11:14.520
own laptops. We have base images in AWS that basically spin up a full death and violence

01:11:14.520 --> 01:11:20.480
bit of guacamole magic. So you think client in and we can get a developer from running

01:11:20.480 --> 01:11:28.000
within an hour generally. And yeah everything's set up for them. The yes code of all the plugins

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:35.080
that we require. Browsers with all the accessibility plugins that we need to do accessibility testing.

01:11:35.080 --> 01:11:41.640
There's quite a lot otherwise it would have taken day by each developer days to set up

01:11:41.640 --> 01:11:46.040
the various Docker configuration stuff that's needed. Sure because it's all right with services

01:11:46.040 --> 01:11:51.600
in fact we can just do it in base images use guacamole as a thin client. It has its issues

01:11:51.600 --> 01:11:58.520
it's not the most performance I would love to get more forms but it's better than nothing

01:11:58.520 --> 01:12:05.920
or some crazy three hot process of RDP connections which is just insane when it sounds like this

01:12:05.920 --> 01:12:09.440
is solving an actual problem. I was just trying to dream up problems that this could solve

01:12:09.440 --> 01:12:17.280
but this is one problem. Thanks for your input. All right we've got one left on the wheel

01:12:17.280 --> 01:12:21.080
should we do it. I mean we you got to spin it though. Right. Yeah I'll spend. I mean

01:12:21.080 --> 01:12:23.600
it's only one topic so we know where it's going to land. It's not going to make any

01:12:23.600 --> 01:12:30.280
sound I don't think because there's no divider. Let's find out. Oh it doesn't. You're right.

01:12:30.280 --> 01:12:36.480
It's they actually they actually wrote that in. Beep. Beep. Nicely done. All right. Our

01:12:36.480 --> 01:12:46.440
last topic on the wheel is Brent's Docker jellyfin beginnings. Jellyfin beginnings huh

01:12:46.440 --> 01:12:49.840
Brent. Well here we go. And now the wheel is empty so this is our last topic. So you're

01:12:49.840 --> 01:12:57.200
jumping into jellyfin. Well I would more say I've jumped. Oh. And so a few weeks ago if

01:12:57.200 --> 01:13:05.680
you all remember we did a jellyfin kind of dive. We all walked away fairly impressed.

01:13:05.680 --> 01:13:14.580
I know even Alex was like oh he tried to convince Kat to. It didn't go so well. And so I got

01:13:14.580 --> 01:13:19.520
inspired by that you you let me kind of tap into the jellyfin server you had here in the

01:13:19.520 --> 01:13:25.600
studio which was fun. But then I thought hmm. So I've never set up Plex. I've played with

01:13:25.600 --> 01:13:30.520
Cody a little bit over the years but I've never been organized enough to bring all my

01:13:30.520 --> 01:13:36.520
media into one place and to have it hosted even locally in that way. But I thought. What

01:13:36.520 --> 01:13:40.620
are you running it on? Yeah. That's where it gets interesting. I thought you'd like

01:13:40.620 --> 01:13:47.200
this adventure. All right. So what has also happened was that over the last few years

01:13:47.200 --> 01:13:53.040
I've been lucky enough to find a great many ThinkPads at the local landfill. Sure. Where

01:13:53.040 --> 01:13:57.440
I was living. So you've adopted some ThinkPads. You have a few stray ThinkPads. I want to

01:13:57.440 --> 01:14:02.280
have some that I've used for years that I are really beloved to me and that I just have

01:14:02.280 --> 01:14:09.040
upgraded and now I'm like what the heck do I do with this thing. So what I have my trajectory

01:14:09.040 --> 01:14:14.880
is so I've got my parents who live in a different city. I've got my brother who lives on the

01:14:14.880 --> 01:14:21.120
same property as me but in a different building. Right. And I've got my place which has pretty

01:14:21.120 --> 01:14:31.520
bad Internet. So what I'm doing is I'm building three systems that are pretty similar. OK.

01:14:31.520 --> 01:14:39.440
Building three systems using old laptops. So one of them is a T61 which is very ancient.

01:14:39.440 --> 01:14:46.160
The other one is an X440 where the screen is broken. And the one I'm using is an X220

01:14:46.160 --> 01:14:53.520
with a dock. So lots of USB inputs. And do they all need storage? Do they all have the

01:14:53.520 --> 01:15:00.640
same storage? The idea is that for instance. Airplanes. I know. That's a loud one. Yeah.

01:15:00.640 --> 01:15:04.800
Don't they know what we're doing. Come on. Gosh. We're down here podcasting. We didn't

01:15:04.800 --> 01:15:12.000
tell them the schedule changed and they're just. So the idea is most of these people

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:16.880
have USB drives you know that they've collected over the years. A whole bunch of different

01:15:16.880 --> 01:15:22.480
sizes different ones and most of them are USB compatible. Hardly any internal drives.

01:15:22.480 --> 01:15:27.520
I've got probably the most out of all these people. And but I wanted to implement a solution

01:15:27.520 --> 01:15:34.240
that I could test on my own and distribute to my parents and my brother for instance

01:15:34.240 --> 01:15:40.840
or anybody else who wants to in a fairly straightforward way that you know whatever is running at my

01:15:40.840 --> 01:15:45.840
place is so similar over there that I don't need to relearn like the topography and all

01:15:45.840 --> 01:15:53.740
of that topology. So the question is is this crazy to plug in a whole bunch of USB drives

01:15:53.740 --> 01:15:59.880
into like a quasi laptop franken server and to have it do some cool things. I guess it

01:15:59.880 --> 01:16:09.640
depends on your tolerance for outages. I think it's high. OK. Because. Well no I say it's

01:16:09.640 --> 01:16:20.080
not crazy. If I could if I could wave a magic wand and do it one way only it would be to

01:16:20.080 --> 01:16:23.480
probably like lay down ethernet or something between you and your brother's place and then

01:16:23.480 --> 01:16:28.460
have all of it and at least in the case of those two have all of it pooled in one spot

01:16:28.460 --> 01:16:33.160
so you have one large set of this and only one system to manage instead of two. Yeah

01:16:33.160 --> 01:16:38.520
I hear you. Currently the connection between us is he's got a just a home router at his

01:16:38.520 --> 01:16:45.120
place that controls also the Internet coming in and I think it's a ubiquity like very directional

01:16:45.120 --> 01:16:55.160
Wi-Fi that just pointed at my cabin and it's pretty slow and unreliable I'll say. So yeah

01:16:55.160 --> 01:16:59.240
ethernet somehow would be nice but that requires a hundred foot ditch. I mean really you both

01:16:59.240 --> 01:17:03.800
are gonna want. Yeah I mean if it's that kind of connection you're probably gonna want them

01:17:03.800 --> 01:17:09.160
on your ends so that way you don't have buffering and stuff like that. Yeah I mean now that

01:17:09.160 --> 01:17:13.240
it's not crazy it would be nice to have a way to manage all of it centrally that's where

01:17:13.240 --> 01:17:18.920
things like. It would be nice to have it have a good skill set in Ansible but it's which

01:17:18.920 --> 01:17:25.360
I'm willing to learn so this is also. It's a lot that's like that's like saying that's

01:17:25.360 --> 01:17:29.060
like saying you got to learn like a whole other category before you can start even doing

01:17:29.060 --> 01:17:35.400
something in another category you know it's a big dependency not necessarily a bad one

01:17:35.400 --> 01:17:41.240
but. So that's the background that's the hardware. Okay. And so the idea over Christmas I thought

01:17:41.240 --> 01:17:47.880
was well I'm just gonna jump in a jellyfish and I know my brother and his wife they watch

01:17:47.880 --> 01:17:52.920
a ton of TV they got a like a giant pile of DVDs that they love and never watch right

01:17:52.920 --> 01:17:58.040
you know how that is and because of the bad internet to that place sometimes streaming

01:17:58.040 --> 01:18:02.840
services just. Are not really great. No that's it you know like 80% of the time it's fine.

01:18:02.840 --> 01:18:09.200
Yeah. But there's sometimes it's not. So I also took it as an opportunity to jump into

01:18:09.200 --> 01:18:14.600
Docker which I had never done and I heard you know a few people in our chat room over

01:18:14.600 --> 01:18:19.320
the last several episodes have said that they haven't dove in either. And so I thought well

01:18:19.320 --> 01:18:26.000
jellyfins actually a nice low stakes way to try stuff right. That's a good way to start.

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:30.440
And I didn't quite figure out Docker compose yet so maybe you'll have to give me a once

01:18:30.440 --> 01:18:37.920
over. Sure. But it was fun. I had so much fun and I have to say it worked really well

01:18:37.920 --> 01:18:43.280
and so now jellyfins up and running. Nice. Which is very cool. Oh good. Mostly at my

01:18:43.280 --> 01:18:51.280
brother's place because I don't know we watch most of the content over there. I say you

01:18:51.280 --> 01:18:59.560
know the nice thing about doing it in Docker compose is that when you revisit it in three

01:18:59.560 --> 01:19:05.440
to three months to a year you have this readable file that tells you oh this is where I store

01:19:05.440 --> 01:19:09.720
the config at this is where the application data is at and these are the networking ports

01:19:09.720 --> 01:19:16.400
it use. It's just it's a really readable yaml. It's really a readable format. It's just also

01:19:16.400 --> 01:19:22.160
very anal about how you format it. Yeah. Well I'm using I guess it's called the Docker command

01:19:22.160 --> 01:19:26.640
line and so you're just running a script and it looks almost as readable to me as all the

01:19:26.640 --> 01:19:29.600
same options just slightly different formatting from what I can tell. I mean it's a simple

01:19:29.600 --> 01:19:34.960
application and I'm not doing anything fancy with it. Yeah sure. Yeah. Yeah that could

01:19:34.960 --> 01:19:40.480
be really nice too. So I think we're when you're talking just one application I don't

01:19:40.480 --> 01:19:45.000
think it really matters. Okay. You know like if you have a like a stack of applications

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:55.400
like maybe jellyfin and a Usenet or torrent downloader or a audiobook manager or something

01:19:55.400 --> 01:20:02.280
like something I like a lot is I haven't used it. What is it called? I haven't used the

01:20:02.280 --> 01:20:07.080
fork of it but the project was called subsonic but there's several forks of it now and it's

01:20:07.080 --> 01:20:13.000
essentially like a self-hosted music library media library where you can have your music

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:17.320
and your playlists and podcasts and internet radio streams and stuff like that and everybody

01:20:17.320 --> 01:20:21.280
can have their own on there and so it's kind of nice when you've got you know just a small

01:20:21.280 --> 01:20:26.020
land and people want to have centralized jukebox stuff like that. When you start having multiple

01:20:26.020 --> 01:20:32.560
applications it's nice to it's nice to manage all that in a compose file because it acts

01:20:32.560 --> 01:20:37.960
as both documentation but also it's a method to update them and stop them and start doing

01:20:37.960 --> 01:20:42.720
it got it all that kind of stuff. So it's nice in that way. So like for in my case all

01:20:42.720 --> 01:20:48.480
of my all of my server-side applications that are related to multimedia in some way are

01:20:48.480 --> 01:20:52.740
all in their own Docker compose file and so I go into that directory and if I do a Docker

01:20:52.740 --> 01:20:57.700
compose pull it actually ends up date updating like eight applications for me nice with one

01:20:57.700 --> 01:21:02.040
command nice and they all yeah they all stay up to date and that way it's and I can separate

01:21:02.040 --> 01:21:06.080
it out like that so I think it's handy in that regard. It's also a really nice way to

01:21:06.080 --> 01:21:11.480
share your setup with people or communicate to someone else what your setup is so you

01:21:11.480 --> 01:21:14.640
know if you were to show me your Docker compose file I'd pretty much understand exactly how

01:21:14.640 --> 01:21:19.020
you have it set up even if I never saw the command you launch it so that kind of thing.

01:21:19.020 --> 01:21:24.040
So one of the questions I have I guess I have two questions. One of them is what should

01:21:24.040 --> 01:21:30.680
I run next? And the other question is is Docker the thing to be learning right now or do we

01:21:30.680 --> 01:21:35.080
have other technologies that maybe? Yeah I think so. No I think that is probably the

01:21:35.080 --> 01:21:39.720
most the most prominent I mean there's Podman but you know you look at like this Bitcoin

01:21:39.720 --> 01:21:43.580
node thing I was doing the entire thing is written assuming you're using Docker. That

01:21:43.580 --> 01:21:49.560
seems like the case isn't it? Yeah. Minimac has a jellyfin solution. Tell us about it.

01:21:49.560 --> 01:21:55.440
Well I'm working with that solution and as some of you know I have a second residence

01:21:55.440 --> 01:22:02.720
and I have an Android TV there and I was looking for solutions to have access to all my library

01:22:02.720 --> 01:22:08.680
via jellyfin on that Android TV but all of a sudden I thought to myself and maybe I don't

01:22:08.680 --> 01:22:14.080
want all the other people visiting that second residence having access to all my library

01:22:14.080 --> 01:22:20.820
so my solution would be Chromecast. So having a jellyfin instance on my phone and just Chromecast

01:22:20.820 --> 01:22:26.400
my library to the TV so I can take my phone whenever I go. I can go to a friend if he

01:22:26.400 --> 01:22:31.680
has an Android capable Chromecast capable device I can just stream my library to their

01:22:31.680 --> 01:22:38.260
TV and they're very good so I have everything I want and I can decide if people have access

01:22:38.260 --> 01:22:42.640
to the library or not. You know that would be great for hotel rooms. I had to stay in

01:22:42.640 --> 01:22:50.960
a hotel room on my way here and I quickly got reminded how awful cable TV is. Oh boy

01:22:50.960 --> 01:22:56.920
it's so bad. Yeah that's actually why I own an Amazon Fire Stick because the Amazon Fire

01:22:56.920 --> 01:23:03.880
Stick is one of the few portable set top TV boxes that A you can install a Plex or jellyfin

01:23:03.880 --> 01:23:10.120
app on and B supports Wi-Fi hotel captures. Very nice. You got to have a device bring

01:23:10.120 --> 01:23:15.200
up like an embedded Firefox. Yeah of course. And most of the TV set top box things do not.

01:23:15.200 --> 01:23:20.160
Yeah Pi Crash you had a note on Libre Speed that could be a great app for Brent to try

01:23:20.160 --> 01:23:27.800
out you're right. Yes so if you got Libre Speed you could actually set okay test your

01:23:27.800 --> 01:23:35.320
connection between your house and your brother's house and now you know okay my connection

01:23:35.320 --> 01:23:40.400
is failing between myself and my brother's house or the connection is failing with the

01:23:40.400 --> 01:23:45.720
internet with fast.com or something like that. Yeah that's a good idea. That does sound like

01:23:45.720 --> 01:23:48.960
a great idea. I've always wanted a little bit of a history to see what the bottleneck

01:23:48.960 --> 01:23:54.440
is or who I can yell at next. And there is a I believe a Linux server image so it's really

01:23:54.440 --> 01:23:59.040
easy to get up and going no flash required just a lightweight speed test in JavaScript.

01:23:59.040 --> 01:24:02.480
This is the first time I hear about this. Oh yeah we've mentioned it on self-hosted.

01:24:02.480 --> 01:24:06.560
I should pay more attention. It has come up but it's probably just been a quick mention.

01:24:06.560 --> 01:24:10.420
It's a simple app I think but I do think that's a great one for you to try. Nice I'm writing

01:24:10.420 --> 01:24:14.320
that down. Libre Speed and it's another one of those nice standalone applications you

01:24:14.320 --> 01:24:20.280
know that's it's good too. So when you go look at when you go say like a Linux server

01:24:20.280 --> 01:24:24.400
IO and you look at their Docker hub pages they'll have the Docker compose file there

01:24:24.400 --> 01:24:27.720
that they recommend. If you read through it you'll see like oh I just changed this to

01:24:27.720 --> 01:24:32.240
my time zone. I changed this to my paths and then it's just a it's just a matter of you

01:24:32.240 --> 01:24:38.120
make a file called docker-compose.yml and it needs to be formatted exactly like they'll

01:24:38.120 --> 01:24:43.920
have it on the Linux server page and then you can just do docker compose up and it'll

01:24:43.920 --> 01:24:47.720
start up the container for you. Well that's what I so I did explore this and I tried to

01:24:47.720 --> 01:24:52.600
get that up and running and making sure everything was cool but I actually had a hard time getting

01:24:52.600 --> 01:25:00.640
the docker-compose command to even work. There were some dependencies or something. Yeah

01:25:00.640 --> 01:25:04.840
okay so it may not have been installed. Yeah it doesn't install with the standard docker

01:25:04.840 --> 01:25:09.040
package. Yeah which I realized. It's just so dumb it will in the future that is a thing

01:25:09.040 --> 01:25:12.960
that's changed. How is that not a thing yet? They decided to they hadn't decided to make

01:25:12.960 --> 01:25:16.680
it part of the official docker command line tools but they have now. So now it's gonna

01:25:16.680 --> 01:25:22.520
be docker-space-compose instead of docker-compose. So you may also be hit by that transition

01:25:22.520 --> 01:25:27.320
depending on when it lands in your distro. Perhaps perhaps. I'll look more into it but

01:25:27.320 --> 01:25:30.720
I don't know it seems like it should have been a little bit easier considering how useful

01:25:30.720 --> 01:25:35.520
it is. I'm so glad you got it going. Well yeah it's a whole adventure. Yeah it is we

01:25:35.520 --> 01:25:38.440
can work on it some more while we're here. I'm deploying apps right now on our new server

01:25:38.440 --> 01:25:47.560
that's Podman. And how's that going? Slow but good. Slow not great but good. All right

01:25:47.560 --> 01:25:53.040
well mumble room it's time for me to go eat. It is that time. Thank you for joining us

01:25:53.040 --> 01:25:57.640
though both virtual lugs. Appreciate you guys. Yeah it was cool hearing that conversation

01:25:57.640 --> 01:26:02.440
go between both of them. Yeah it was really fun. Thanks for joining us for Linux Sunday

01:26:02.440 --> 01:26:10.920
on a Tuesday. We will see you on Sunday and we'll see you again next Tuesday too. How

01:26:10.920 --> 01:26:15.840
we do it. Thank you. Come back right here either mumble room or gitsy. We had them both

01:26:15.840 --> 01:26:21.120
running today. Worked out pretty good. Yeah great hearing some familiar voices. Yep. Goodbye

01:26:21.120 --> 01:26:27.800
everybody enjoy the rest of your day. Thank you. Bye bye Chris. Bye now. Cheerio. Goodbye

01:26:27.800 --> 01:26:33.920
goodbye goodbye goodbye. Also thank you for all of you watching live. Those in the chat

01:26:33.920 --> 01:26:58.920
room. Have a great rest of your day. See you next Sunday.
