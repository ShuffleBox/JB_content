WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:10.180
Well, hello, everyone.

00:10.180 --> 00:12.420
This is Brunch with Brent.

00:12.420 --> 00:13.420
Joining me today is Daniel Foray.

00:13.420 --> 00:14.420
Daniel, how are you doing?

00:14.420 --> 00:15.420
I'm doing pretty good.

00:15.420 --> 00:16.420
How are you doing?

00:16.420 --> 00:17.420
Yeah, I'm doing great.

00:17.420 --> 00:19.080
It's good to hear your voice.

00:19.080 --> 00:23.520
For those who don't know you, I think many, many do.

00:23.520 --> 00:30.480
Daniel is the founder of Elementary OS and also a regular co-host on User Error.

00:30.480 --> 00:35.720
For those who haven't dove into User Error yet, can you give us a bit of a sense of what

00:35.720 --> 00:36.720
goes on there?

00:36.720 --> 00:37.720
Yeah.

00:37.720 --> 00:42.840
I think my favorite way to describe User Error is it's like if you got your nerd friends

00:42.840 --> 00:47.240
and went out to the pub and then just talked about whatever random stuff you thought up,

00:47.240 --> 00:49.860
that's kind of what the podcast is.

00:49.860 --> 00:51.960
How could that not be lovely, right?

00:51.960 --> 00:53.800
Yeah, it's a lot of fun.

00:53.800 --> 00:56.160
Yeah, it seems like you guys have a lot of fun.

00:56.160 --> 01:02.080
Joining you there is Joe Resington and Popey as well, who I've had a chat with here on

01:02.080 --> 01:04.280
Brunch as well.

01:04.280 --> 01:08.040
I don't know how you guys do it, but there's this dynamic between the three of you that's

01:08.040 --> 01:10.780
just so lovely to listen to.

01:10.780 --> 01:11.920
How does that feel on your end?

01:11.920 --> 01:13.560
I appreciate you saying that.

01:13.560 --> 01:16.280
I think it's good, too.

01:16.280 --> 01:21.320
We've obviously met in real life before and actually had silly conversations in a pub,

01:21.320 --> 01:27.420
so it's fun to see that we can do a show with that same dynamic and we all get along really

01:27.420 --> 01:30.000
well and we're friends.

01:30.000 --> 01:31.000
It's just fun.

01:31.000 --> 01:33.880
It doesn't feel like work to me in any way.

01:33.880 --> 01:36.400
That always means you're doing the right thing, I think.

01:36.400 --> 01:39.920
I don't think I know the story of how that all started.

01:39.920 --> 01:44.400
You mentioned that you did get a chance to be in person together and to be at a pub and

01:44.400 --> 01:45.960
do kind of the same thing.

01:45.960 --> 01:50.040
Was that before it started or after, or how did that sort of all come to be?

01:50.040 --> 01:56.000
Yeah, so I've actually known Alan for quite a while because I've gone to a few different

01:56.000 --> 01:58.720
canonical sponsored conferences.

01:58.720 --> 02:05.040
I used to go to the Ubuntu Developer Summit when that was a thing, and then also I've

02:05.040 --> 02:10.480
gone to a couple of the Snap events and some other things like that, and then I've met

02:10.480 --> 02:18.080
up with him at other events like we went to Linux App Summit, and I don't remember if

02:18.080 --> 02:22.640
I've seen him at Gwadek, but we just end up going to a lot of the same conferences.

02:22.640 --> 02:30.040
Then I met Joe at Linux Northwest, but I've only got to see him in person once.

02:30.040 --> 02:33.600
That I guess was the previous one last year, I would imagine, right?

02:33.600 --> 02:34.600
Yeah, yeah.

02:34.600 --> 02:37.000
I think probably you and I just missed each other.

02:37.000 --> 02:38.000
I flew in late.

02:38.000 --> 02:41.680
I actually missed most of the conference last year, and I think you and I just missed each

02:41.680 --> 02:42.680
other.

02:42.680 --> 02:46.240
We haven't got a chance to sort of meet in person yet, which I was looking forward to

02:46.240 --> 02:50.360
this year, but we'll see what happens.

02:50.360 --> 02:55.680
I agree with you in that meeting in person, especially when you're co-hosting a podcast

02:55.680 --> 02:58.760
together of that style, is so essential, isn't it?

02:58.760 --> 03:04.640
Yeah, it's so different, I think, when you interact with people online and you kind of

03:04.640 --> 03:11.040
only see their work persona, I guess, and then once you meet them in person, there's

03:11.040 --> 03:13.280
just a different level of connection you have with them.

03:13.280 --> 03:18.080
I think that's why it's so important to do these kind of conferences and things, if you're

03:18.080 --> 03:23.140
going to work with that person in the future in any capacity, it always helps to have some

03:23.140 --> 03:30.040
level of camaraderie with them and know that we're all working in a common interest.

03:30.040 --> 03:33.600
I don't know if there's a lofty way to put it or anything other than just knowing that

03:33.600 --> 03:35.160
you guys are cool with each other.

03:35.160 --> 03:44.000
Yeah, that goes a long way for sharing ideas and sharing space and obviously some audio

03:44.000 --> 03:45.000
too.

03:45.000 --> 03:48.640
So yeah, I definitely support that anytime you can do it.

03:48.640 --> 03:55.760
You did mention that you had met Alan quite a little while ago through some Ubuntu related

03:55.760 --> 03:56.760
stuff.

03:56.760 --> 04:01.680
I would imagine those were some of the earlier years of elementary OS, is that sort of the

04:01.680 --> 04:05.440
beginning of when you got to meet him and start all of that?

04:05.440 --> 04:10.160
Yeah, and even before that, and I'm not sure if a whole lot of people know, but I used

04:10.160 --> 04:16.840
to do a contract work for Ubuntu during the Unity years.

04:16.840 --> 04:21.480
I'm not sure how much of that work still exists in Ubuntu, but a lot of the iconography and

04:21.480 --> 04:22.760
things like that.

04:22.760 --> 04:29.840
I worked with Matthew Paul Thomas on the Ubiquity design for choosing the different kinds of

04:29.840 --> 04:34.920
installation setups and so I did a decent amount of design work for Canonical way back

04:34.920 --> 04:35.920
in the day.

04:35.920 --> 04:36.920
Nice.

04:36.920 --> 04:42.040
I had no idea and I suppose that makes a lot of sense now and I would imagine informed

04:42.040 --> 04:43.760
a lot of what you're doing these days.

04:43.760 --> 04:46.720
Yeah, it's kind of interesting.

04:46.720 --> 04:53.700
I guess in some ways it was almost the other way around where I started doing like elementary

04:53.700 --> 05:02.240
icons and it was at a time when Ubuntu was really looking at their major rebranding shift,

05:02.240 --> 05:07.880
like they were going from like the whole brown and orange kind of thing and then into more

05:07.880 --> 05:15.840
of the purple and orange stuff and one of the lead designers at the time, David Siegel,

05:15.840 --> 05:19.720
reached out to me and he was like, hey, I like what you're doing with the elementary

05:19.720 --> 05:20.720
icon stuff.

05:20.720 --> 05:25.400
Do you think you could make a version for Ubuntu and propose that?

05:25.400 --> 05:31.560
So I did and then it was kind of like through that that I ended up getting to do a lot of

05:31.560 --> 05:35.520
work in Ubuntu and kind of like influence things a little bit.

05:35.520 --> 05:37.920
Well, that sounds super fun.

05:37.920 --> 05:44.560
It seems to me as well that it sort of fits with what I've seen as one of your personal

05:44.560 --> 05:48.900
themes which is just rich collaboration throughout.

05:48.900 --> 05:51.440
Does that feel like that's a thread that makes sense?

05:51.440 --> 05:52.440
Yeah, definitely.

05:52.440 --> 05:58.760
And I'm really happy to be able to be a part of a bunch of different things and like over

05:58.760 --> 06:05.880
the years kind of getting started with like the GNOME and doki people and doing elementary

06:05.880 --> 06:12.940
and then I've done some work, just a little bit of design work for like Martin Winpress

06:12.940 --> 06:18.920
on the Ubuntu MATE stuff and so it's fun to just kind of get involved in different places

06:18.920 --> 06:24.480
and I think it is kind of like, you know, everybody tries to make it that everybody's

06:24.480 --> 06:29.280
competing with each other, but we're all kind of more of like a family and everybody wants

06:29.280 --> 06:32.040
to work together and make everything better for everybody.

06:32.040 --> 06:37.240
Yeah, that's what I'm learning more and more as I get a bit more integrated into our sort

06:37.240 --> 06:43.600
of Linux and open source community is that it definitely feels massive and has a lot

06:43.600 --> 06:49.000
of people in it and that's a wonderful thing, but at the same time somehow we've managed

06:49.000 --> 06:54.720
to make it feel like a little close family at the same time and I find that really impressive

06:54.720 --> 07:01.360
and also just really cool and it sounds like you're echoing that sentiment exactly.

07:01.360 --> 07:02.680
Yeah, absolutely.

07:02.680 --> 07:10.400
I wanted to ask you a little bit more about sort of your design background because it

07:10.400 --> 07:15.920
seems to me like that's not necessarily, you know, when we think of contributing to projects

07:15.920 --> 07:22.260
and things like that, we often quickly go to sort of the developer standpoint, but can

07:22.260 --> 07:25.680
you walk us a little bit through your history?

07:25.680 --> 07:29.600
I know you're really strong in design and so where did that start for you and how did

07:29.600 --> 07:31.360
that move into the software world?

07:31.360 --> 07:38.160
I guess if I had to like really point out like the first time I started getting into

07:38.160 --> 07:46.600
like visual design stuff, it was as a kid, my uncle was into like game development and

07:46.600 --> 07:50.400
he loved the programming side, but he hated like sprite work and stuff like that and so

07:50.400 --> 07:54.360
he kind of would like push it off on the me a little bit and go, hey man, you know, if

07:54.360 --> 08:00.080
you can come up with some cool artwork, like we can make a game together and yeah, so I

08:00.080 --> 08:05.320
started doing some of that kind of stuff and just trying to like learn, you know, how to

08:05.320 --> 08:13.280
do spriting for that kind of stuff and then I ended up from there kind of continuing some

08:13.280 --> 08:15.760
of that like modding on different games and stuff.

08:15.760 --> 08:22.560
There was this game called Little Fighter and it was interesting in the way that you

08:22.560 --> 08:28.120
could easily go in and change all the sprites and everything was like scripted for all the

08:28.120 --> 08:33.120
action so it wasn't that hard to like do custom characters and stuff like that so I really

08:33.120 --> 08:39.960
got into that and like modding that kind of thing and then when Windows XP was kind of

08:39.960 --> 08:46.160
the big thing then it seemed like there was a decent modding community there around like

08:46.160 --> 08:50.440
I can't remember what all the little extensions were but there was like things for like docs

08:50.440 --> 08:55.680
and adding shadows to the windows and like there was a bunch of Windows XP mods out and

08:55.680 --> 08:59.800
so I was always really interested in that kind of like modding visual design kind of

08:59.800 --> 09:09.560
stuff and then when I saw Karora Linux with the Compiz XGL demo and the 3D spinning cube

09:09.560 --> 09:15.280
like that was for me it was like oh my god this is the ultimate playground and getting

09:15.280 --> 09:23.840
into that stuff and then starting to see that like oh well in Windows you can kind of change

09:23.840 --> 09:29.920
the way that stuff looks but it always acts like Windows and then in this new kind of

09:29.920 --> 09:34.600
Linux playground like not only can you change the way stuff looks but you can change the

09:34.600 --> 09:39.860
way it acts and that's like a whole different level because you're getting into like user

09:39.860 --> 09:45.680
experience design and not just visual design right so that was really big for me was kind

09:45.680 --> 09:51.800
of discovering like how flexible desktop Linux is and and getting to kind of actually move

09:51.800 --> 09:55.320
into not just how things look but how they work too.

09:55.320 --> 10:00.760
It sounds like a nice gradual progression that has a lot of space to keep you really

10:00.760 --> 10:07.340
fascinated and interested in continuing the learning curve that sounds really really great.

10:07.340 --> 10:12.880
You mentioned sort of running into Karora there and then having Linux sort of open up

10:12.880 --> 10:14.640
the world for you.

10:14.640 --> 10:18.880
How did you first get introduced to Linux or even the open source concept?

10:18.880 --> 10:22.960
Was it someone who shared that with you or how did that go for you?

10:22.960 --> 10:23.960
You know what it was?

10:23.960 --> 10:24.960
It was...

10:24.960 --> 10:25.960
Do you remember dig.com?

10:25.960 --> 10:26.960
Yes, I do.

10:26.960 --> 10:32.380
Yeah, so it was on dig and I can't remember if it just popped up in like the technology

10:32.380 --> 10:38.840
I almost called it the technology subreddit that's how like gone dig is like it was like

10:38.840 --> 10:44.000
the technology section of dig or whatever and right and yeah it just popped up there

10:44.000 --> 10:48.560
one day as like oh you could do this and you could just put this thing on a CD and like

10:48.560 --> 10:53.880
you don't even install it or anything and you know I knew like what an operating system

10:53.880 --> 10:58.240
was because I had technical family members and like the idea of like oh well you know

10:58.240 --> 11:02.920
you're installing a different version of Windows or you know we knew some people had Macs and

11:02.920 --> 11:09.340
so I got like what that idea was but I don't think I had ever heard of Linux before that.

11:09.340 --> 11:13.160
So did you just kind of download it and throw it on a CD and you knew enough to sort of

11:13.160 --> 11:17.000
figure that out or do you have a mentor sort of helping you out either online or off?

11:17.000 --> 11:21.600
No it was totally it was just you know knowing enough to burn a CD and then popping it in

11:21.600 --> 11:26.760
and and going oh you know this is crazy and then like kind of diving into it and then

11:26.760 --> 11:30.640
I was reading more about it and found out that it was built on Gentoo and I was like

11:30.640 --> 11:35.600
oh what's Gentoo and I looked into that and I downloaded the whole like Gentoo manual

11:35.600 --> 11:40.160
and printed it out and like this big spiral binder.

11:40.160 --> 11:44.460
That sounds pretty dedicated and to start near near Gentoo is quite the adventure as

11:44.460 --> 11:45.460
well.

11:45.460 --> 11:50.520
Yeah well it was you know I had no idea so I think it was such a learning experience

11:50.520 --> 11:55.480
though to like set up a Gentoo install you know when you're starting from from nothing

11:55.480 --> 12:01.160
and you're like wow this is really hard but you like learn oh okay well there's so many

12:01.160 --> 12:05.960
different components in an operating system and you're like okay I need something to manage

12:05.960 --> 12:09.360
the network and I need something to do the login screen and I need a desktop environment

12:09.360 --> 12:14.400
and I need a package manager and you kind of realize like oh okay like this is more

12:14.400 --> 12:18.080
complicated than it seems on the surface and there's so many different choices you can

12:18.080 --> 12:29.040
make and then what I actually got me into Ubuntu was finding out I was trying to work

12:29.040 --> 12:35.720
on like an updates manager for Gentoo because I was like this is really complicated and

12:35.720 --> 12:39.640
I didn't really have any development chops I was just kind of like trying to jam something

12:39.640 --> 12:44.080
together in Python and I don't think I ever got very far but and then I saw that Ubuntu

12:44.080 --> 12:47.200
had an updates manager and I was like that's it I'm switching Ubuntu I don't even know

12:47.200 --> 12:48.200
what it is.

12:48.200 --> 12:53.420
But it sounds like you kind of tripped over an accidental like initiation into really

12:53.420 --> 12:59.580
learning the different pieces that it takes to put a distribution together and it sounds

12:59.580 --> 13:05.960
like that happened early on for you which isn't isn't everybody's sort of path into

13:05.960 --> 13:12.200
Linux but I would imagine that would inform what you're doing today in a really meaningful

13:12.200 --> 13:13.200
way.

13:13.200 --> 13:20.380
Because for me it was about figuring out how to put together a different operating system

13:20.380 --> 13:27.260
it wasn't really about just using the operating system and so going through the stuff with

13:27.260 --> 13:32.800
Gentoo was I wasn't intimidated by at all because my my goal wasn't to just like pop

13:32.800 --> 13:36.640
something in and have it up and running it was to build something you know.

13:36.640 --> 13:41.320
It sounds like you were looking for a playground at that time yeah absolutely and having fallen

13:41.320 --> 13:47.800
on to a Gentoo was totally totally fine and and really fun actually I would imagine.

13:47.800 --> 13:54.400
Yeah challenging challenging for sure but but fun and yeah it's a it's a wild world

13:54.400 --> 13:59.480
with how how complex a Gentoo install can get.

13:59.480 --> 14:04.960
I'll take your word for it I will say I'm uninitiated there but but everyone I know

14:04.960 --> 14:12.260
who've who have dove into trying a Gentoo install have really have always said they've

14:12.260 --> 14:17.760
really benefited from it so that's that's again another sort of check mark in the Gentoo

14:17.760 --> 14:22.260
learning sphere I suppose.

14:22.260 --> 14:26.520
What was the progression then into forming elementary because it sounds like you moved

14:26.520 --> 14:31.400
from there to Ubuntu because it sounded easier in some ways or had some features that you

14:31.400 --> 14:36.360
wanted but how did that evolve for you into making something of your own?

14:36.360 --> 14:47.600
Yeah so I think from there I'm not sure how much I was doing like icons and stuff before

14:47.600 --> 14:56.240
I switched to Ubuntu I can't really remember but I know that once I got on Ubuntu I think

14:56.240 --> 15:03.200
that's when things really kicked off more and I was doing a lot more work with iconography

15:03.200 --> 15:13.520
and then I got involved somehow with Gnome Dew and there was another one it was called

15:13.520 --> 15:17.640
Gloobus or something like that and it was like a preview app.

15:17.640 --> 15:18.640
That's a great name.

15:18.640 --> 15:24.720
Yeah it was like there was so much wild stuff happening at that time and so it's just kind

15:24.720 --> 15:27.880
of getting involved with different teams that were doing interesting things that were like

15:27.880 --> 15:32.680
oh I want that app and then turns out I can talk to the people that are making it and

15:32.680 --> 15:35.700
maybe get some things that I want built in there.

15:35.700 --> 15:39.040
What a gift of open source right that you could reach out to the people just making

15:39.040 --> 15:40.880
it I think that's really great.

15:40.880 --> 15:47.640
Yeah it's such a wild concept and I think what's really cool is that that's still the

15:47.640 --> 15:48.640
way it is today.

15:48.640 --> 15:54.840
It wasn't like at that time it was kind of this weird pioneer Wild West time I think

15:54.840 --> 16:02.480
compared to now but I think that it's still the case that you can just kind of get involved

16:02.480 --> 16:06.520
with stuff and start talking to people who are making things and it's always awesome

16:06.520 --> 16:11.800
to see when you're using something like on GitHub nowadays and then the author just like

16:11.800 --> 16:15.160
will come in and like leave a comment and be like oh you're having this problem because

16:15.160 --> 16:18.760
you did this and if you try this configuration it's like wow that guy made that thing and

16:18.760 --> 16:24.180
he took the time to come like comment on my thing like that is so great.

16:24.180 --> 16:29.920
And also I think and you will obviously have more personal experience than me on this one

16:29.920 --> 16:34.780
but I think that's an essential part of all of this as well there's I would imagine from

16:34.780 --> 16:38.800
your perspective some close connection that you get with users that maybe you wouldn't

16:38.800 --> 16:44.320
get if you were behind some kind of some kind of wall of you know a developer wall or a

16:44.320 --> 16:46.760
designer wall.

16:46.760 --> 16:51.120
Do you appreciate that most days that close connection from the perspective of the person

16:51.120 --> 16:52.120
creating?

16:52.120 --> 16:56.720
Yeah absolutely and you know sometimes it's overwhelming because you know there's only

16:56.720 --> 17:02.480
one of me and like you're not scalable yeah and it's tough and there's so many people

17:02.480 --> 17:08.760
that want really personal help that sometimes I'm just not able to provide but I think that

17:08.760 --> 17:16.360
is super important to me to make sure that people know that like if they go through the

17:16.360 --> 17:21.480
proper channels that it's not impossible for them to get a hold of someone who's working

17:21.480 --> 17:25.840
on that thing and that will talk to them and ask questions and spend time to make sure

17:25.840 --> 17:27.440
that they're having a good time.

17:27.440 --> 17:34.440
I've had that experience and it's it seems really special when you get that kind of attention

17:34.440 --> 17:39.760
so but I distracted you there a little bit because you were talking about sort of your

17:39.760 --> 17:46.440
trajectory into elementary and founding elementary and how those ideas started.

17:46.440 --> 17:51.360
Let's see so we're picking up with getting involved with some different open source projects

17:51.360 --> 18:00.060
and then I think it was around that time that I had like some kind of ideas about how these

18:00.060 --> 18:07.120
things might fit together more and kind of like an idea around how a desktop environment

18:07.120 --> 18:12.560
might look and you know it was kind of crazy at the time like I had these like sketches

18:12.560 --> 18:19.520
where there was like three docs on each side of the screen and like this one did devices

18:19.520 --> 18:23.680
and this one has your favorites and this one's your apps and they're all you know coming

18:23.680 --> 18:27.640
in and out of context and then like little other pop-up bubbles and like it was it was

18:27.640 --> 18:32.560
complicated but it was just like doing some like real exploration about like if we didn't

18:32.560 --> 18:38.560
think about what a desktop environment supposed to look like how would we do it and I was

18:38.560 --> 18:44.120
doing tons of mock-ups and looking at different applications and just kind of like trying

18:44.120 --> 18:50.840
to throw away all the assumptions and make something different and one that got a lot

18:50.840 --> 18:59.520
of attention was I did some design work related to the file browser Nautilus and I think it

18:59.520 --> 19:05.940
was OMG Ubuntu who kind of picked it up and talked about it and then a developer reached

19:05.940 --> 19:12.240
out to me and was like hey that's really cool let's build that and so we made like this

19:12.240 --> 19:19.600
big patch set for Nautilus and we went to go try to push it upstream and like at the

19:19.600 --> 19:26.000
time being like a young guy who has no idea how like software development works I was

19:26.000 --> 19:30.680
kind of like I guess put off because they were like no we're not gonna merge that and

19:30.680 --> 19:37.920
I was like why what the hell we work so hard and it was you know like ill-considered and

19:37.920 --> 19:43.480
the patches were huge and you know it's totally understandable now from the perspective of

19:43.480 --> 19:49.320
like an upstream maintainer why like you need to make sure that stuff you're merging in

19:49.320 --> 19:54.640
is like good quality and has like a really well considered design direction and it fits

19:54.640 --> 20:02.480
in with the rest of the application and stuff like that but it was kind of like that thing

20:02.480 --> 20:10.320
where it was kind of like okay well maybe I don't want to kind of leave it up to someone

20:10.320 --> 20:16.400
else if they're gonna merge in that code maybe we should start working on our own stuff and

20:16.400 --> 20:23.800
so we kind of built a little community around doing something different and building a different

20:23.800 --> 20:31.320
desktop environment and it just kind of took off from there with the applications and the

20:31.320 --> 20:36.680
desktop environment and then we went to like okay we have all this stuff and we need a

20:36.680 --> 20:43.160
way to present it all together to people because these things are all made to fit together

20:43.160 --> 20:49.840
and so doing a distro is kind of the natural progression and not necessarily an easy decision

20:49.840 --> 20:57.160
either because there's a lot of well you really got to be committed to make a distribution

20:57.160 --> 21:06.360
last long term and last long term it has right I think you started that back in was it 2007

21:06.360 --> 21:12.400
ish around there yeah that's when I started getting involved with like the design stuff

21:12.400 --> 21:20.360
and the icons but we didn't do our first OS release for a while I think I think we're

21:20.360 --> 21:26.880
coming up on nine years now I think it'll be at the end of this month that's still impressive

21:26.880 --> 21:31.520
really when you think about all the work that goes into something like that I think that's

21:31.520 --> 21:37.760
worth congratulating and you should have a I suppose virtual party to celebrate thanks

21:37.760 --> 21:41.480
yeah I don't you know I don't even know if we were thinking about that at the time I

21:41.480 --> 21:46.080
don't know if we thought about like how long it would take to do everything we wanted to

21:46.080 --> 21:49.920
do I think we're just kind of like this is we want to build some stuff and then just

21:49.920 --> 21:58.600
like kept going but it is one of those things where you see when we first registered the

21:58.600 --> 22:03.200
App Center project on Launchpad and then how long it took from when we registered that

22:03.200 --> 22:07.920
project to like okay now we've done all these different things and different toolkits have

22:07.920 --> 22:13.320
come out we've migrated all our development to GitHub and and it took so long before we

22:13.320 --> 22:19.360
actually delivered like the first version of App Center to users and I think that a

22:19.360 --> 22:28.320
lot of people maybe don't realize that sometimes it takes years to deliver some of these products

22:28.320 --> 22:34.720
oh man yeah but there's and you think this is probably just my assumption but there's

22:34.720 --> 22:40.200
far more work that happens sort of on the on the background that nobody ever sees then

22:40.200 --> 22:46.520
then what ends up sort of being shown to users right there's a lot of as you mentioned all

22:46.520 --> 22:52.560
that setup and ideas and marketing and all this all this stuff on the back end yeah totally

22:52.560 --> 22:58.200
and you know that's something we've tried to expose a little bit more in in blog posts

22:58.200 --> 23:03.240
when we're doing something that's like I think the last one we did is when we did the new

23:03.240 --> 23:11.160
design for the login and lock screen we wrote about because it took us a couple years to

23:11.160 --> 23:17.760
finally ship it and so we wrote about like why and like all the different events that

23:17.760 --> 23:24.880
we attended like there was a meetup with the gnome design team in London that Cassidy went

23:24.880 --> 23:28.240
out to and started talking about all this stuff and then it was like these are all the

23:28.240 --> 23:31.800
different branches that we've worked on and like all the different concerns about why

23:31.800 --> 23:37.280
we wanted to do the redesign and like this is why it took us two years you know and and

23:37.280 --> 23:43.720
this is why this is what we came up with so just kind of giving people a peek into that

23:43.720 --> 23:49.720
process yeah is helpful both for users to understand well why does it take so long but

23:49.720 --> 23:56.000
also to understand that they should keep sort of being excited about it because there is

23:56.000 --> 24:00.920
stuff happening and I think the thing that at least many people appreciate about that

24:00.920 --> 24:06.080
approach is that it seems to me like you have a really strong you know you and the team

24:06.080 --> 24:10.720
have a really strong philosophy behind what you're doing and you kind of stick to that

24:10.720 --> 24:16.880
and make it take as long as it takes to make it right yeah definitely and you know sometimes

24:16.880 --> 24:21.480
there there is stuff where we're looking at it and we're going okay like the first idea

24:21.480 --> 24:26.240
we had for this is too ambitious and we're gonna have to pivot to something smaller so

24:26.240 --> 24:31.200
that we can deliver something sooner and and so that's you know sometimes we do that what's

24:31.200 --> 24:36.240
an example maybe of that I would say that like App Center itself is a good example of

24:36.240 --> 24:43.800
that because you know from the very inception of the project we had this idea of like and

24:43.800 --> 24:49.700
this is not a novel idea at all but of you know we want developers to be able to publish

24:49.700 --> 24:55.600
their apps to elementary OS faster than they currently can because right now we're I mean

24:55.600 --> 25:03.840
right now but back then we're waiting you know six months or if we're based on an LTS

25:03.840 --> 25:07.600
we're waiting up to two years you know before users can get a new version of an app and

25:07.600 --> 25:14.520
that's really not good but the first version of App Center that we shipped it was just

25:14.520 --> 25:18.400
the front end it was just the package manager so it didn't have any of that publishing stuff

25:18.400 --> 25:26.200
in it and it took us a while and a crowdfunder and a sprint and and all kinds of stuff before

25:26.200 --> 25:31.840
we were actually able to ship the publishing back end and so and and I think we're still

25:31.840 --> 25:38.520
kind of working towards that goal because it wasn't really until recently where we said

25:38.520 --> 25:43.960
okay we're going all in on Flatpak and so even though we have like a publishing back

25:43.960 --> 25:51.160
end that functions to really deliver on what we think App Center should be like we had

25:51.160 --> 25:56.860
to wait for some new technologies to emerge and mature and and so you know it's always

25:56.860 --> 26:04.400
evolving and and sometimes things take a long time I think it just exposes just how difficult

26:04.400 --> 26:10.560
some of these problems were tackling are and maybe difficult is the wrong word but it let

26:10.560 --> 26:15.160
you know you mentioned waiting for a technology to come out to make it feel right and to match

26:15.160 --> 26:22.720
up with where you were trying to head it seems a wild maybe that's the only way to put it

26:22.720 --> 26:28.440
that you know we can have these visions and yet it take lots and lots and lots and lots

26:28.440 --> 26:34.880
of effort to get there and years sometimes to see those come to fruition and and yet

26:34.880 --> 26:38.960
still be completely worth it I imagine you guys still think it's completely worth it

26:38.960 --> 26:44.560
oh yeah totally and you know it's funny I don't mean to talk about App Center so much

26:44.560 --> 26:48.320
but it's just something that like it was so it's topical I guess yeah it's so involved

26:48.320 --> 26:57.440
in and so complicated but when we were kind of going through working on like the App Store

26:57.440 --> 27:01.260
component of it something that people kept bringing up was like well Ubuntu tried this

27:01.260 --> 27:04.280
and it didn't work out and like why do you think you could do it you know and Ubuntu

27:04.280 --> 27:09.680
couldn't do it and that's something that was totally different though was like the technology

27:09.680 --> 27:16.600
landscape was different and when Canonical tried it I don't think products like stripe

27:16.600 --> 27:21.720
really existed or certainly not at the scale that they do today so it was like just having

27:21.720 --> 27:25.320
like some other company that made a product that allows you to build the thing that you

27:25.320 --> 27:31.200
want to build is a completely different game hmm yeah sometimes being too early to the

27:31.200 --> 27:36.760
game is a detriment I suppose that's where the luck comes in right coming in at just

27:36.760 --> 27:41.440
the right time when the technologies are maybe aligning like stars and making it more possible

27:41.440 --> 27:47.000
than it was previously even for for some people that do good work like Canonical sometimes

27:47.000 --> 27:52.240
it's just not quite the right time yeah and and then especially in this landscape too

27:52.240 --> 27:57.640
where something that I think all of us as far as like people who build desktops are

27:57.640 --> 28:04.000
kind of working towards is like Wayland and just the general theme of like sandboxing

28:04.000 --> 28:09.560
and containerization and it's something that's been you know worked towards for years and

28:09.560 --> 28:18.480
we get a little bit closer each year and it's it's still far off seeming but it's it's something

28:18.480 --> 28:23.520
that if we didn't start and we didn't have the ideas of where this should go and didn't

28:23.520 --> 28:27.880
start making that steady progress that you know it's not something that can be shipped

28:27.880 --> 28:32.480
right away it's something that where you have to be looking far ahead so how then do you

28:32.480 --> 28:37.880
and the team stay motivated long term knowing some of these projects you know just just

28:37.880 --> 28:43.040
take a long time I think you gotta bounce around honestly like there are some things

28:43.040 --> 28:48.920
where it's like you know okay I'm working on this stuff where it's it's kind of a long

28:48.920 --> 28:55.560
game and it's it's not necessarily as exciting and so I gotta have my projects that are like

28:55.560 --> 29:02.560
little wins and so you know I work on those things and then I go okay now I want to work

29:02.560 --> 29:08.880
on like a small visual design refresh or maybe some different icons or you know some little

29:08.880 --> 29:12.820
things that are kind of exciting and fun or little bite size issues little tweaks here

29:12.820 --> 29:18.640
and there things that I can ship now so that way it's kind of like switching back and forth

29:18.640 --> 29:22.000
so I'm not I'm not always just like okay I'm working on this thing and it'll be great five

29:22.000 --> 29:26.640
years from now right because you need some immediate wins to keep I guess that energy

29:26.640 --> 29:34.920
up and that I don't know to celebrate more often perhaps yeah and I think to keep people

29:34.920 --> 29:42.780
engaged too because you know it was something that we ran into I think within the last year

29:42.780 --> 29:48.600
where we'd see people on reddit go oh elementary there that's definitely dead there's there's

29:48.600 --> 29:52.300
nothing happening over there yeah and and we were like what you know we're working every

29:52.300 --> 29:58.600
single day on stuff and then you see like oh okay well it's because we're not shipping

29:58.600 --> 30:08.320
that often and so we kind of changed the way our release cycle works and so now we're pushing

30:08.320 --> 30:12.860
out little updates to things all throughout the life cycle the operating system instead

30:12.860 --> 30:18.720
of just like delivering a product and then waiting two years and delivering another product

30:18.720 --> 30:23.780
sounds like a really delicate balance because we were mentioning earlier you know wanting

30:23.780 --> 30:29.280
to only send something out there when it's ready and yet I could see why that those little

30:29.280 --> 30:34.120
sort of external blips of you know sending stuff out there is helpful how do you kind

30:34.120 --> 30:41.000
of match those two that sounds like a challenge yeah I think the kind of way that we've dealt

30:41.000 --> 30:47.660
with it is we have things that are like okay we know this is a long-term goal and we know

30:47.660 --> 30:52.920
that this is something that we're going to kind of work on with the intention that it's

30:52.920 --> 30:58.720
not being shipped this cycle and then we have other things that are like oh you know there's

30:58.720 --> 31:04.440
no reason we can't ship this this cycle so it's just kind of like separating the two

31:04.440 --> 31:11.680
out and knowing which one a product is it really helps there so same idea like the small

31:11.680 --> 31:17.760
wins versus the big wins right yeah but I think a really important part of it is like

31:17.760 --> 31:24.520
we were talking about before is kind of tightening the feedback loop from when someone reports

31:24.520 --> 31:31.760
an issue or has a feature request and if it's something that doesn't require a whole new

31:31.760 --> 31:37.780
technology stack to develop being able to go oh yeah you know we can push that update

31:37.780 --> 31:44.640
out within like a month or whatever is really big and if it's like an issue report and you're

31:44.640 --> 31:49.040
able to fix it within like a day or two like people love that and it feels so good to be

31:49.040 --> 31:53.240
able to like go man that's so cool that I was able to fix your thing and now you're

31:53.240 --> 31:57.560
using it and then you know people are excited about it and like that that just feels really

31:57.560 --> 32:02.840
good to be able to do things really quickly I'm smiling over here and I it wasn't even

32:02.840 --> 32:09.480
done to me so I can see why it feels good can you tell me a little bit more about the

32:09.480 --> 32:13.560
team that you're working with regularly I mean I mean I know you have Cassidy who's

32:13.560 --> 32:18.200
sort of close to you but there's a lot of people in the community that are putting some

32:18.200 --> 32:24.000
time into elementary as well what has that been like yeah so you know I'm not sure how

32:24.000 --> 32:34.080
much everybody knows but we have a couple people on payroll and we are payrolls kind

32:34.080 --> 32:39.640
of gone back and forth we've had some people that were on part-time then moved to doing

32:39.640 --> 32:48.640
like contracts and you know contracts come and go and then we've done bug bounties also

32:48.640 --> 32:54.560
so it can be kind of hard sometimes to separate as far as like who's being paid for what work

32:54.560 --> 33:06.680
and things like that but I'd say that at any given time there's probably 20 30 active developers

33:06.680 --> 33:13.720
in the community doing something we've got some people that are really long time contributors

33:13.720 --> 33:21.440
like Jeremy Wooten is our maintainer for files and I think he's like one of the only people

33:21.440 --> 33:25.800
that is like a dedicated maintainer for an app right now so it's actually really cool

33:25.800 --> 33:31.680
to have like we know that no matter what like Jeremy's gonna keep files going and and so

33:31.680 --> 33:39.080
it can it can be really nice to be able to count on that but then we have like Quarantine

33:39.080 --> 33:48.880
Noel is one of our longtime desktop developers and he is like all over the place and in a

33:48.880 --> 33:57.240
good way like you know you never you never necessarily know what he's working on because

33:57.240 --> 34:01.040
he is always looking at like the next thing and knows like what the new technologies are

34:01.040 --> 34:05.280
and stuff so that's really cool because he brings that insight back in and he's really

34:05.280 --> 34:10.960
good at working with upstreams and he's actually done a lot of work where it's like okay well

34:10.960 --> 34:14.560
in order to have this feature in our app we need to build it in the upstream library so

34:14.560 --> 34:18.920
I'm gonna go up there for a couple months and work on it up there and then come back

34:18.920 --> 34:23.520
so it's really cool to have people like that in the community that sounds great I would

34:23.520 --> 34:28.520
imagine having different types of personalities and different types of expertise and different

34:28.520 --> 34:34.160
types of ways that people work if you can manage that can all come around to be really

34:34.160 --> 34:40.480
beneficial yeah definitely I think that you know diversity is strength absolutely and

34:40.480 --> 34:47.200
trying to make everybody work the same way just wouldn't it wouldn't help so I think

34:47.200 --> 34:51.040
it's nice that people are different and they have different ideas and different concerns

34:51.040 --> 34:56.800
and I think it really shows in the product when you have people that care about lots

34:56.800 --> 35:04.560
of different things I would imagine too that that can sometimes be challenging to you know

35:04.560 --> 35:08.640
I'm just trying to think like you know you let someone go work upstream for a few months

35:08.640 --> 35:13.200
and that's just what they want to do and you just have to have faith that they're sort

35:13.200 --> 35:19.040
of doing the right thing does that present challenges sometimes I would imagine it does

35:19.040 --> 35:26.000
you know I'd say not as often as you'd think I feel like that our community is really good

35:26.000 --> 35:33.440
about building consensus and I don't know how many times that we've really had like

35:33.440 --> 35:40.200
major conflicts or anything like that in recent history so it seems to be going pretty well

35:40.200 --> 35:46.200
and I think that you know everybody communicates really well which is always super important

35:46.200 --> 35:50.280
and just making sure that everything's everybody's on the same page about where we want to be

35:50.280 --> 36:00.240
is I think the most helpful thing and having kind of general themes or like I'm sure Cassidy

36:00.240 --> 36:07.360
would advocate for you know like personas where you have like okay you know let's make

36:07.360 --> 36:13.200
sure that we're keeping in mind how people who interact primarily with the keyboard think

36:13.200 --> 36:19.280
of this thing and then let's also make sure we're keeping in mind like how this thing

36:19.280 --> 36:25.120
will work when all the applications are in sandbox containers and you know having having

36:25.120 --> 36:32.240
kind of these little themes that guide where we go I think helps keep everything cohesive

36:32.240 --> 36:36.240
that's a really nice way to think about it and hadn't occurred to me before because we

36:36.240 --> 36:44.240
sort of I don't know lean on seeing software in the way that we use it but I've learned

36:44.240 --> 36:49.360
that repeatedly by simply you know throwing my laptop in front of someone else and just

36:49.360 --> 36:55.480
watching how they do things is always completely different than how I do it so I love that

36:55.480 --> 37:02.400
idea of these profiles and I imagine that could be applied in more than just software

37:02.400 --> 37:08.880
as well yeah I think so I imagine that people use that in in lots of everyday scenarios

37:08.880 --> 37:15.720
and I think personas is a pretty widely used UX pattern no matter what industry you're

37:15.720 --> 37:24.520
in mm-hmm can I ask how I don't know it just seems to me from what I know of the ways that

37:24.520 --> 37:29.800
you and the team work and just getting a chance to talk to you guys personally sometimes and

37:29.800 --> 37:34.440
hearing you on a variety of podcasts that you just it seems like you bring a lot of

37:34.440 --> 37:40.080
heart to what you're doing and a lot of sort of I don't know humanity maybe to it and so

37:40.080 --> 37:43.640
it's not it doesn't seem like it's just about the software it seems like it's more about

37:43.640 --> 37:51.280
the collaborations and and making people feel good about every step of the way I'm just

37:51.280 --> 37:56.920
curious how it seems like a deep part of your person but how do you how have you cultivated

37:56.920 --> 38:02.080
that with others and and I'm sure that gives back to you in many ways yeah I guess I would

38:02.080 --> 38:09.320
say that is a big part of kind of the I feel like brand identity such a cold way to describe

38:09.320 --> 38:13.520
something where like the goal is you want people to have a good time you know and if

38:13.520 --> 38:19.420
if people aren't having a good time then like why are we even doing this and I think that

38:19.420 --> 38:25.480
that's something that you know we we want to be part of like when people interact with

38:25.480 --> 38:33.080
our brand accounts that it's this definitely an idea of like okay people are having a good

38:33.080 --> 38:37.600
time or they're having a bad time and like how can we make sure that people are having

38:37.600 --> 38:45.980
a good time and kind of looking at things that way I think in the way that people feel

38:45.980 --> 38:56.200
about what they're doing helps to make those kind of decisions and leads to another another

38:56.200 --> 39:01.960
little Cassidy thing is he would probably say delightful moments and making sure that

39:01.960 --> 39:07.080
things are fun or the things feel good and when you're interacting with them and whether

39:07.080 --> 39:13.000
that's through the software or through interacting with another person in the community or through

39:13.000 --> 39:19.600
a brand account or an email or whatever just kind of having that idea of people feeling

39:19.600 --> 39:26.680
good is is I think important yeah I think you nailed it when you said you know bringing

39:26.680 --> 39:32.080
heart to it it's it feels like often in our you know software is an easy place to to be

39:32.080 --> 39:37.720
really cerebral but it feels like that the counterbalance of bringing some some heart

39:37.720 --> 39:42.700
and some empathy to every single interaction within it I can't can't do anything but be

39:42.700 --> 39:50.820
helpful yeah yeah definitely and you know it's it's funny like as much as we like to

39:50.820 --> 39:56.920
think that as humans were there were so in like our frontal cortex or whatever you know

39:56.920 --> 40:04.440
like our we're so logical but when it really comes down to it like so much of how we interact

40:04.440 --> 40:10.400
with the world is how we feel about it and how we feel can often override like the more

40:10.400 --> 40:16.320
logical parts of our brain I would argue that design you know that's the very focus of design

40:16.320 --> 40:22.680
is to make people feel good about the things they're interacting with I imagine you agree

40:22.680 --> 40:30.440
yeah I would say that that's a big part of it and you can kind of see how if if your

40:30.440 --> 40:37.460
design doesn't make people feel good how they'll kind of figure out a way to do what feels

40:37.460 --> 40:42.200
more comfortable or feels better or easier for them and I think there's like that classic

40:42.200 --> 40:48.920
example of the photo where there's a walkway and there's some grass next to it and there's

40:48.920 --> 40:54.200
a path that people have walked through the grass and just kind of like you know this

40:54.200 --> 40:59.560
is your your design versus this is this is what feels natural for the user and where

40:59.560 --> 41:06.040
they wanted to go yeah I think they call those desire paths right and I love that term because

41:06.040 --> 41:12.240
it sort of shows well this is what people want to do naturally and so if your design

41:12.240 --> 41:16.960
is doing something different than that then you're missing the mark yeah and I think that

41:16.960 --> 41:23.200
you know Cassidy's been diving into that a lot recently with some user surveys and doing

41:23.200 --> 41:32.360
a little bit of research and you know we're looking at especially at how people especially

41:32.360 --> 41:37.440
people who are used to the Linux desktop really want to customize things and want to make

41:37.440 --> 41:44.280
things feel their own and as software developers that could be really difficult because that

41:44.280 --> 41:51.680
introduces some complexity and some kind of randomness or uncertainty into the software

41:51.680 --> 42:02.400
and so we're kind of looking at ways of okay how can we make things feel more belonging

42:02.400 --> 42:09.120
to the person who's using the software but in a way that is a little more known ahead

42:09.120 --> 42:15.880
of time so that we can kind of build and design around it and so we're looking at things like

42:15.880 --> 42:24.520
different colors and making sure that we're really designing around different font sizes

42:24.520 --> 42:31.120
and that people really want to do like a dark theme now so we're looking into like okay

42:31.120 --> 42:37.360
well how how do we do a dark theme in a way that doesn't really mess with application

42:37.360 --> 42:43.160
developers who are wanting to do their own unique visual design identities in their apps

42:43.160 --> 42:48.160
and so just kind of thinking through this thing of like what we really don't want is

42:48.160 --> 42:51.840
to end up in a situation where we've done nothing to accommodate people who want it

42:51.840 --> 42:55.960
to feel their own and so it's the most broken it can possibly be.

42:55.960 --> 43:02.200
Yeah it sounds like a really challenging balance that I would imagine is not you know it's

43:02.200 --> 43:06.240
not a certain thing to know where you should land in that balance and I would imagine taking

43:06.240 --> 43:13.640
the approach that you are with being careful and yet listening as well is the right one

43:13.640 --> 43:17.640
you know to tread lightly but also do things with intention.

43:17.640 --> 43:23.600
Yeah you know something that took us I think quite a few years to articulate was when to

43:23.600 --> 43:32.440
decide between whether something should be like a user setting or preference or not and

43:32.440 --> 43:41.240
the most recent iteration that we've landed on is that if it's something that is a design

43:41.240 --> 43:46.600
or engineering decision that we shouldn't leave that up to the people using the software

43:46.600 --> 43:51.880
but if it's something that helps make the software more accessible to more people or

43:51.880 --> 43:58.920
more palatable to more people then that's something that we want to enable people to

43:58.920 --> 44:03.840
make things the way that they need them to be in order to use the software.

44:03.840 --> 44:06.400
Those are nice lenses to look through actually.

44:06.400 --> 44:10.040
If you wanted to send a question out there to the community something you might like

44:10.040 --> 44:15.580
them to think about or something you want them to go see or maybe something to interact

44:15.580 --> 44:18.240
with what would you like to send out there?

44:18.240 --> 44:26.040
You know something that that's been a really big topic for us for a really long time is

44:26.040 --> 44:33.800
kind of challenging people to financially support open source software and you know

44:33.800 --> 44:40.560
it doesn't have to be elementary or elementary OS either like that's not even the thing it's

44:40.560 --> 44:47.240
you know if you really benefit from some piece of open source software then try to find a

44:47.240 --> 44:55.920
way to support its development to make sure that its existence is continued and so if

44:55.920 --> 45:00.720
you haven't thought about that before and there's something that you really love you

45:00.720 --> 45:05.520
should you know look into that and make sure that that thing continues to exist and continues

45:05.520 --> 45:06.740
to get developed.

45:06.740 --> 45:11.980
What does it mean when someone when someone does that like what are the effects that happen

45:11.980 --> 45:13.600
on on your end?

45:13.600 --> 45:16.880
What does it enable maybe as a way to look at it?

45:16.880 --> 45:24.280
For us you know when people pay for downloads of elementary OS like that becomes my paycheck

45:24.280 --> 45:31.520
you know that's how I eat and pay rent and all that stuff so before as we were kind of

45:31.520 --> 45:38.920
ramping the company up this was something that I could only work on after I got home

45:38.920 --> 45:44.560
from my day job and if I didn't have any other obligations with family or friends or anything

45:44.560 --> 45:52.820
like that and you know I'm fortunate enough that I don't have any like really serious

45:52.820 --> 45:57.360
obligations as far as like family members who are ill or people that I have to support

45:57.360 --> 46:02.180
or anything like that but there are a lot of people out there who do have those obligations

46:02.180 --> 46:06.880
and they would love to work on open source software but they can't do it unless it's

46:06.880 --> 46:15.120
a job for them and so making sure that either like organizations who are empowered to do

46:15.120 --> 46:22.160
some hiring or people who are struggling on the weekends to try to turn something from

46:22.160 --> 46:27.740
a hobby into a job if we can support those people and empower them to lose the day job

46:27.740 --> 46:34.100
and make their career working on open source software then I think everyone benefits there.

46:34.100 --> 46:39.440
Does it feel like that would make encouraging people to work on open source software not

46:39.440 --> 46:47.040
feel so much like a compromise or maybe like you know a side gig like was true for you

46:47.040 --> 46:48.040
previously?

46:48.040 --> 46:56.080
Yeah and you know it's definitely so many things change when it goes from just a hobby

46:56.080 --> 47:06.360
to a career path and you know one of those things is like if I wanted to go to a conference

47:06.360 --> 47:15.960
I had to take that week off of work and so that means like do I have enough money to

47:15.960 --> 47:19.760
pay my bills if I do that you know?

47:19.760 --> 47:29.520
Can I actually do that financially and not only that but okay now if I can do that will

47:29.520 --> 47:34.540
the event sponsor me because maybe I don't have enough money to pay for my own travel

47:34.540 --> 47:41.680
to go there and so going from that position as a hobby where it's like maybe I just can't

47:41.680 --> 47:49.240
even participate to now I'm in a position where it's like this is my job to participate

47:49.240 --> 47:56.040
and so you know getting together the funds as part of the company budget and I don't

47:56.040 --> 48:02.680
have to worry about taking the time off work and having that ability means that I can go

48:02.680 --> 48:08.040
interact with some people that are developing very important technologies and spend that

48:08.040 --> 48:15.880
time to bring maybe a different perspective or to take back home a lot of knowledge and

48:15.880 --> 48:20.400
it really changes what gets delivered in a really big way.

48:20.400 --> 48:30.200
Sounds like a real catalyst to improving well a your you know a developer's well-being to

48:30.200 --> 48:34.040
not have to worry all the time about you know where they're going to spend their time and

48:34.040 --> 48:39.480
the compromises and and you know if they can have food on the table but also in accelerating

48:39.480 --> 48:47.520
ideas and integrations and some collaborations and stuff so yeah what a catalyst to doing

48:47.520 --> 48:53.520
some amazing things and if it's spread out throughout the users widely then it's it's

48:53.520 --> 48:58.880
actually not a big hit for any one of them but yet makes a massive difference on your

48:58.880 --> 49:00.280
end I would imagine.

49:00.280 --> 49:08.920
Yeah you know the the very first time that I went to Ubuntu Developer Summit I was in

49:08.920 --> 49:14.960
a position where I wasn't going to be able to go because that means that I would miss

49:14.960 --> 49:22.680
a paycheck that means that I wouldn't be able to pay rent and somebody else offered to sponsor

49:22.680 --> 49:30.180
me to be there and he was like how much do you need to to be able to make it and so someone

49:30.180 --> 49:37.320
else's generosity absolutely changed my life because I think that if I wasn't at that conference

49:37.320 --> 49:43.000
then I don't know if I would have ended up actually doing that contract work for canonical

49:43.000 --> 49:47.580
and having the opportunity to get more involved with Ubuntu and I think that I wouldn't be

49:47.580 --> 49:53.480
in the same place at all so definitely if you can if you can help somebody else and

49:53.480 --> 49:59.220
it doesn't have to be in such a big way you know that that's obviously a huge help but

49:59.220 --> 50:03.120
like you said if it's spread out between a lot of people and a lot of people do a little

50:03.120 --> 50:05.920
bit then you can absolutely change people's lives.

50:05.920 --> 50:12.240
The way I sometimes try to look at it and maybe I'm in a certain position but you know

50:12.240 --> 50:18.200
I as a photographer I'm a freelancer and I use 100% open source software for the work

50:18.200 --> 50:29.280
that I do so that enables me to make my own living off of how I'm using these tools and

50:29.280 --> 50:35.700
so I try to sort of mentally just set aside a little tiny piece of what I'm taking home

50:35.700 --> 50:40.920
to try to give back because without those tools I couldn't do the things I'm doing and

50:40.920 --> 50:46.800
especially not in the ways that I would like to do them so it feels to me like it supports

50:46.800 --> 50:52.440
you know the people on the ground who are doing it but it also supports the ideas that

50:52.440 --> 50:57.320
we believe in and the collaborations that we think should happen more in the world so

50:57.320 --> 51:01.840
it feels like a really important thing so if anybody can do it that would be great and

51:01.840 --> 51:08.160
I'll commit actually to giving a little bit this week too before this releases so hopefully

51:08.160 --> 51:09.400
someone else can too.

51:09.400 --> 51:14.680
Yeah yeah and you know for anybody that thinks that you know oh I'm just one person it's

51:14.680 --> 51:21.560
not that big of a difference I think the last time I checked the stats we're at a little

51:21.560 --> 51:29.880
bit over 1% of the people who download elementary OS choose to pay anything for it so that 1%

51:29.880 --> 51:38.640
of people enables us to deliver it to the other 99% so your small one time contribution

51:38.640 --> 51:44.560
is actually huge and it allows a whole lot of people to access open source software that

51:44.560 --> 51:46.600
they never would have been able to before.

51:46.600 --> 51:52.800
The thing that's interesting to me is imagine what could happen with 2% or 5% right what

51:52.800 --> 51:54.160
would that change?

51:54.160 --> 52:00.040
Yeah yeah definitely be able to expand our our staff quite a bit yeah and then just some

52:00.040 --> 52:04.640
some great catalyst to some great things so let's let's try to make that happen collectively

52:04.640 --> 52:11.360
for all projects really Dan if if you wanted to send people where could they go to get

52:11.360 --> 52:14.960
in touch with you and get connected?
