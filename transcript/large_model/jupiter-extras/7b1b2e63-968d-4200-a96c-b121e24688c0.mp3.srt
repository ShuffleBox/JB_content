1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,860
Well, we got something special because elementary OS 6.1 landed yesterday and Danielle Fore is

2
00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:07,860
joining us.

3
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:09,700
Danny, welcome to the show.

4
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:12,740
And it sounds like it's more than just a number.

5
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:14,060
There's a lot in 6.1.

6
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:19,940
Yeah, it's actually, you know, I think it's the most we've ever packed into a point release

7
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:21,920
in a short amount of time.

8
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:27,460
Like our release blog post for this point release is nearly exactly as long as our original

9
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:30,360
release post for like the 6.0 proper.

10
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:31,360
OK, help me.

11
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:32,920
How do I say the name?

12
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:35,200
Is it Jolner?

13
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:38,040
So that's the fun part is none of us know how to pronounce it correctly.

14
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:42,680
I think it's like Yulnir, like Yuletide, I think, maybe.

15
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:45,140
OK, I should have gone that you're right, right?

16
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:46,140
I should have gone that direction.

17
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:47,140
You're right.

18
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:48,140
That's obvious when I think about it.

19
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:49,300
OK, so what happened?

20
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:51,260
Why is dot one just loaded up with stuff?

21
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:55,500
Is it things that were kind of on track for dot o and just didn't quite make it?

22
00:00:55,500 --> 00:01:01,000
Well, I mean, we've got a ton of feedback from people from the release of OS six.

23
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,320
And so one of the big things that we like to concentrate on is, you know, wrapping up

24
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:08,080
all that feedback and trying to address the things that people have told us like as soon

25
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:09,080
as possible.

26
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:14,260
But we've also, you know, been really revamping a lot of our processes like internally and

27
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:17,140
taking more of a project management approach to things.

28
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:22,000
So we've gotten like a really good system for kicking out new updates and just really

29
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,860
prioritizing things and just getting features hammered out.

30
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:27,060
Mm hmm.

31
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:28,060
That sounds great.

32
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:30,740
Like so some internal improvements that have just led to a more streamlined development

33
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:31,820
process.

34
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:33,660
And this is sort of the fruits of that labor.

35
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:34,660
Exactly.

36
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:35,660
Oh, that's great.

37
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:36,660
Congratulations.

38
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:40,100
That sounds like that's going to be an investment that'll, you know, pay dividends for a while.

39
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:48,140
I know a lot of people had mixed opinions on the available apps at launch of OS six,

40
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:51,060
but it sounds like now there's over 90 curated apps in the App Center, at least.

41
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:54,180
And things are coming along and now there's is there also a flat hub integration as well?

42
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:55,180
Yes.

43
00:01:55,180 --> 00:02:01,260
So as of this morning, we have 97 apps approved in App Center with a few more in the queue.

44
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:07,940
And then kind of what we've done is we've worked really hard to make sure that people

45
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:15,300
know that sideloading is like expected and an important part of the flow and like show

46
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:20,020
them in our welcome map and on App Center if they like get a search result that doesn't

47
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:23,820
return anything, like let them know that, like, hey, you know, all these flat packs

48
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:28,240
on flat hub are compatible with elementary OS and you can easily just go download them

49
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:30,780
and double click and install like anything you want.

50
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:36,600
So even if something is even if somebody doesn't publish their app in our store, like you still

51
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:41,500
have the complete open availability to download these apps for Linux.

52
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:43,140
That's I mean, that's what people love to hear, right?

53
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:45,900
They want to know that's going to be the case.

54
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:48,020
This is sort of an odd one to talk to you about.

55
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:53,660
But it struck me like a lot of times when you get a new update to how something as fundamental

56
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:59,780
as alt tab behavior works, it's it's honestly like it's really glitzy, right?

57
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:00,780
It does a lot.

58
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:06,580
But you guys have almost kind of simplified the alt tab process now in a little bit.

59
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:10,860
Tell me about that, because it's kind of gone from a very visual swapping where you could

60
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:15,180
tell what the active application was by watching the doc.

61
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:16,620
And now it's something a lot simpler.

62
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:21,260
You know, when we first designed the alt tab switcher, we kind of had all these things

63
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:25,360
about like, you know, well, let's throw everything out the window and like come up with something

64
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:31,380
really unique and different and like what, you know, could we possibly do with like the

65
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:33,700
tools that we have?

66
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:38,780
And over the past several years, really, we've got a lot of feedback from different people

67
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:44,240
that they didn't really like the solution we came up with and that the animations were

68
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:49,340
too flashy and can be disruptive and didn't really fit into how most people actually use

69
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:50,980
those kind of switchers.

70
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:53,960
So we tried to gather up a lot of feedback.

71
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:57,240
We worked with a bunch of members from the community.

72
00:03:57,240 --> 00:04:05,700
We even got design input from somebody who does some UX work for like Google services

73
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:11,040
that was just happened to be like in the community and wanted to give their thoughts.

74
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:16,240
And so we came back to this like really just simple switcher that was like, you know what,

75
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:18,380
this is this is what the people want.

76
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:19,740
You know, they don't want the flash.

77
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:20,800
They don't want the whiz bang.

78
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:23,700
They want just the thing that does the thing.

79
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:26,860
And so that's you know, that's what we did is give the people what they want.

80
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:29,280
I mean, it's not a common approach.

81
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,820
Usually it's more glitz, more glamour.

82
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:32,860
But this one, it's it's back to the basics.

83
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:34,680
But I think it works really well.

84
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:39,540
And is it accurate to say that six dot one is really the release where the dark style

85
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:42,640
is fully implemented and looking good now?

86
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:43,640
Yeah.

87
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:46,840
So, you know, when we first implemented the dark style as something that was very specific

88
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:51,520
to how it was working on elementary OS, but we've been working a lot with three desktop

89
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,960
and the gnome community in particular.

90
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:57,920
And so the version of the dark style they're shipping right now is compatible with the

91
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:00,120
new free desktop standard.

92
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:04,400
So apps that are built for gnome 42 will be compatible with it.

93
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:10,680
And I believe the upcoming KD version, I can't remember the version number of KD that's going

94
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:11,680
to be compatible with it.

95
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:17,080
But it's it's like something that's going to work for every app you get from everywhere.

96
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:21,120
And like right now, it doesn't necessarily support that because people are still updating.

97
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,960
But like we're there, we're ready for the next generation of, you know, that free desktop

98
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:25,960
spec.

99
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:26,960
I love that.

100
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:32,000
It means it works across gnome, it works across elementary apps and sounds like future plasma

101
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
apps, too.

102
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
That's that's good.

103
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,440
But now that it's, you know, a free desktop spec that we can get buying in from electron

104
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:41,200
and maybe from, you know, Google and Mozilla and stuff like that, too.

105
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,200
Yeah, right.

106
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:46,120
I mean, hopefully, you know, I'm looking through some of this stuff.

107
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:50,600
And it's like a lot of really nice stuff to see some stuff around display scaling.

108
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:54,560
And she's that that whole UI around that looks so great.

109
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:59,320
But the burning question really, when it comes to that area in our chat room is, what are

110
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:02,000
your thoughts about whaling down the road?

111
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:07,080
Because it's, it's, you know, near and near is the groundwork being laid for that?

112
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:12,560
Or are you looking at kind of what needs to happen to make that transition or things more

113
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,960
further along than I realize?

114
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:14,960
Yeah, absolutely.

115
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:18,380
Like we've had a whaling project up for a while and kind of just like picking issues

116
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:20,080
off it here and there.

117
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:24,940
But we really are trying to make whaling a big goal for OS seven.

118
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:32,080
And Cassidy actually has been doing a UI study recently related to some components that we

119
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:35,540
need to rewrite to work properly with Wayland.

120
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:42,000
So we're really like, aiming for first class Wayland support when the next release, that's

121
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
a huge goal for us.

122
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,880
And then this last kind of question I have that's an area I don't, I don't really understand

123
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:51,240
because honestly, some of the aspects of flash packs still kind of are complicated to me.

124
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:57,540
But is there now an elementary OS flat pack platform based on the six one release now

125
00:06:57,540 --> 00:07:03,320
that that can be used as a flat pack platform for others to build and distribute apps on

126
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,320
now?

127
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:05,320
Yeah, yeah, that's great.

128
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:11,640
So when we redid our app center completely based around flat back for OS six, we had

129
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:17,080
a flat pack runtime, there are six versions, and now we have a 6.1 version out.

130
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:20,540
But yeah, developers can build their apps against the elementary runtime.

131
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:22,720
And that's what we use an app center.

132
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:28,760
And you know, it's built off of the free desktop SDK and the gnome SDK.

133
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:31,320
So it's compatible, you know, across other distros.

134
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:34,440
So if you write your app against the elementary runtime, you know, you could download the

135
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:36,400
flat pack and run it on whatever distribution.

136
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:43,180
Okay, so if I'm following you, it's sort of like when you do a major update, now, there's

137
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:46,200
going to be a update to the flat pack platform as well.

138
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,200
Yeah, that's right.

139
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:50,880
Because it contains, you know, all the libraries that we're building against and like the latest

140
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:54,920
versions of granite and our style sheet and like, you know, all the little utility functions

141
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:57,120
for the latest HP eyes and everything.

142
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:00,680
Okay, that's okay, then I got a random one for you.

143
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:08,080
Because I know that there are six 64 bit arm versions of a lot of the apps in the app center.

144
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:10,700
And I know you guys tested on like the pine book and stuff like that.

145
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:16,080
But now I've got I've got a generic arm 64 box, I just want to run elementary on is that

146
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,400
going to be something that's doable soon?

147
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:21,440
Like, will there just be an arm ISO that people will be able to download in the future?

148
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:26,800
Yeah, so right now, if you go to build stop elementary.io, we have arm images and early

149
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:27,800
access.

150
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:34,440
So you can download and test those out, we're still kind of ironing out a crude good kernel

151
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:39,600
that we can like know that it's well supported so that we can have like an officially well

152
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,580
supported release.

153
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:45,600
But that is available in early access for you to play around with the caveat that you

154
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,920
know that, you know, it's it's still kind of experimental.

155
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:48,920
Yeah, okay.

156
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:49,920
All right.

157
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:50,920
Good.

158
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:51,920
That's great, though.

159
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,680
Sounds like so it does sound like work is underway.

160
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:58,240
I know my Raspberry Pi 400 is gonna love that too.

161
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:01,660
There's so much we could talk about like just alone with the app center, we could fill a

162
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:02,660
we could fill a whole episode.

163
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:06,840
So is there anything else you wanted to draw attention to or mentioned before we wrap up?

164
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:11,560
Yeah, actually, you know, another huge focus for us has been making sure that we can get

165
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:14,020
elementary OS shipped on devices.

166
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:16,800
So we have, you know, our partners, our retailers.

167
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:21,920
So if you go to store dot elementary dot IO, you can see there if you're in the market

168
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:28,280
for a new computer, we have, you know, laptops and mini desktops from laptop with Linux.

169
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:33,220
We have the desktops, laptops and minis from slim book and all in ones also.

170
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:38,920
And then star labs makes some really, really slick computers, really cool notebooks.

171
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:41,320
Okay, I'll have to check that out.

172
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:44,200
Man, it just really impresses me this release.

173
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,200
There's so much in there.

174
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:48,280
So I'll put a link in the show notes to the release announcement.

175
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:53,840
This if you want to if you want to go to school on how to write a post that covers updates

176
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:57,280
