WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:06.240
Four, three, two, one.

00:06.240 --> 00:10.740
We have ignition and we have liftoff.

00:10.740 --> 00:16.120
We have liftoff of the Titan Centaur carrying the first of two Voyager spacecraft to extend

00:16.120 --> 00:20.520
man's senses farther into the solar system than ever before.

00:20.520 --> 00:25.160
Reports coming back indicate those twin large solid motors are functioning perfectly, producing

00:25.160 --> 00:28.440
1.2 million pounds of thrust each.

00:28.440 --> 00:36.400
Twenty-five seconds into the launch, all continuing to go well.

00:36.400 --> 00:44.800
1997, one of humanity's high notes, one of our biggest dreams where we dared really,

00:44.800 --> 00:45.880
really big.

00:45.880 --> 00:50.120
And it's still in operation today, Voyager 1 and 2, still in operation today.

00:50.120 --> 00:55.940
They're amazing machines and we wanted to take a special moment to reflect on the resilience

00:55.940 --> 00:58.880
of the Voyagers and Wes is here with me.

00:58.880 --> 00:59.880
Hello, Wes.

00:59.880 --> 01:00.880
Hello.

01:00.880 --> 01:04.080
And to help make it extra special, for those of you who remember one of my favorite shows

01:04.080 --> 01:08.640
of all time, SciByte, Heather, aka Mars Base, is joining us.

01:08.640 --> 01:09.640
Hello, Heather.

01:09.640 --> 01:11.600
Hello, happy science.

01:11.600 --> 01:12.840
Happy science.

01:12.840 --> 01:16.760
This is something that I immediately thought we got to bring Heather in because this is

01:16.760 --> 01:19.340
something you and I love to talk about in SciByte.

01:19.340 --> 01:23.960
And Wes, you noted that there was a bit of news recently that kind of put this on our

01:23.960 --> 01:26.500
radar and we thought, let's start there.

01:26.500 --> 01:29.600
Why we're talking about this now and let's get into the Voyagers.

01:29.600 --> 01:36.400
Yeah, if 1977 was quite a year, 2020 hasn't started out so well for the world or for Voyager

01:36.400 --> 01:37.400
2.

01:37.400 --> 01:41.640
You see, back in January, a problem occurred when Voyager 2 missed a spin maneuver it was

01:41.640 --> 01:44.520
using to calibrate its magnetic field instrument.

01:44.520 --> 01:48.600
And that glitch left two power hungry systems on simultaneously.

01:48.600 --> 01:53.180
And as far out as Voyager 2 is, there's not a lot of power to go around.

01:53.180 --> 01:55.720
So luckily, the software recognized the problem.

01:55.720 --> 01:58.900
But that meant it went to a pre-programmed fault mode.

01:58.900 --> 02:01.760
And it took a long time to get back online.

02:01.760 --> 02:03.440
Don't worry, Voyager 2 is fine.

02:03.440 --> 02:05.440
It's still out there doing great science.

02:05.440 --> 02:13.000
But it really made me think these machines have been alone in space for 42 years.

02:13.000 --> 02:15.600
That takes incredible engineering and we should probably explore that more.

02:15.600 --> 02:16.700
Yeah, that's a great point.

02:16.700 --> 02:23.760
So systems that were designed before 1977, because they were launched in 1977, have enough

02:23.760 --> 02:28.920
smarts to have a fail mode, from what you just said, and then report back home.

02:28.920 --> 02:34.080
That's the kind of engineering that I think NASA is really, really kind of maybe held

02:34.080 --> 02:35.640
to a certain like high standard for it.

02:35.640 --> 02:41.020
Like that's NASA design engineering and Heather, there's been remarkable science that these

02:41.020 --> 02:42.160
machines have produced.

02:42.160 --> 02:43.160
Oh, yeah.

02:43.160 --> 02:44.960
I mean, you get all sorts of data.

02:44.960 --> 02:50.000
I mean, as the years go on, we're edging towards the end of their power supply.

02:50.000 --> 02:54.600
We're getting information on the edge of the solar system, interstellar space now.

02:54.600 --> 02:57.680
They are the only instruments we have out there.

02:57.680 --> 03:03.480
So the instruments built long before some of your listeners were even born are giving

03:03.480 --> 03:07.960
us scientific data that we have no other source of.

03:07.960 --> 03:08.960
Right.

03:08.960 --> 03:10.520
And they're chugging along now.

03:10.520 --> 03:12.540
But it is getting towards the end of their life.

03:12.540 --> 03:15.120
So it's kind of nice to reflect on them while they're still working, because I'm sure there

03:15.120 --> 03:19.840
will be lots of eulogies written when we declare them as like dead and we've lost contact.

03:19.840 --> 03:22.840
I'm sure there'll be all kinds of stuff, but it's kind of nice to talk about them now.

03:22.840 --> 03:29.600
And SciByte, if you want to go back in the archives, episode 22, 32, 51, 102, and of

03:29.600 --> 03:33.260
course 136, talked about the Voyager probes.

03:33.260 --> 03:34.260
We loved them.

03:34.260 --> 03:35.260
Oh, yeah.

03:35.260 --> 03:38.520
I mean, every once in a while they come up with, you know, hey, are they edging towards

03:38.520 --> 03:39.520
this?

03:39.520 --> 03:40.520
Oh, my gosh.

03:40.520 --> 03:44.280
We just picked up a coronal mass ejection from the sun once it got way out there and

03:44.280 --> 03:47.680
that gives us data and sort of just chug along.

03:47.680 --> 03:51.760
Every once in a while, some giant piece of scientific information comes from them.

03:51.760 --> 03:56.840
Will you start us off with some of the interesting bits about sort of the special moment that

03:56.840 --> 04:00.160
the solar system was in back when these launched?

04:00.160 --> 04:01.160
Sure.

04:01.160 --> 04:06.200
I mean, when we were when it first started, they had the idea of just doing just a Jupiter

04:06.200 --> 04:07.760
Saturn flyby.

04:07.760 --> 04:11.640
And up until like six months before they launched, they weren't even called the Voyagers because

04:11.640 --> 04:13.880
that's all they were going to do is Jupiter Saturn.

04:13.880 --> 04:14.880
Wow.

04:14.880 --> 04:23.720
But every like 176 years, there is a planetary alignment such that all of these planets were

04:23.720 --> 04:25.440
in line and they said, you know what?

04:25.440 --> 04:31.120
With just a little bit of extra tweaking, we can get Uranus and Neptune too.

04:31.120 --> 04:33.200
With that slingshot acceleration, right?

04:33.200 --> 04:36.440
The Planetary Grand Tour.

04:36.440 --> 04:38.080
It's such an opportunity.

04:38.080 --> 04:41.280
I mean, that alignment happens every 176 years.

04:41.280 --> 04:44.840
I heard a story where the director of NASA at the time went to President Nixon and basically

04:44.840 --> 04:50.280
said, look, the last time this happened, Jefferson was in your seat and he totally botched it.

04:50.280 --> 04:51.280
Yeah.

04:51.280 --> 04:57.560
I mean, talk about being brought a very limited opportunity to create history and wow, six

04:57.560 --> 05:02.260
months before they launched, Heather, that's that seems like that doesn't happen.

05:02.260 --> 05:07.000
The overall plans were not necessarily changed at that point, but their name was changed

05:07.000 --> 05:12.020
at that point because then by that point they had said, oh, well, we can get all this extra

05:12.020 --> 05:14.960
data and go by these other planets.

05:14.960 --> 05:22.320
And Wes, you mentioned earlier the fault protection that went into effect when they had the problem

05:22.320 --> 05:23.700
earlier this year.

05:23.700 --> 05:28.640
The Voyagers were the first spacecraft that had that programming built into them.

05:28.640 --> 05:35.200
That's become standard now, where if it completely loses its mind for a minute, it knows to go

05:35.200 --> 05:40.800
to a low power mode and then wait to hear back from home, essentially.

05:40.800 --> 05:44.360
The engineering that just had to think about these kinds of situations, so there must be

05:44.360 --> 05:48.680
redundancy in systems and some modularity in how systems are used and what gets turned

05:48.680 --> 05:49.680
on and turned off.

05:49.680 --> 05:54.440
And those are bits and pieces that I've heard over the years.

05:54.440 --> 05:58.000
Do we know roughly how much life these things have left?

05:58.000 --> 06:05.160
Roughly five years or so, as these were, they're not solar powered because way out there, there's

06:05.160 --> 06:06.880
not a lot of solar power.

06:06.880 --> 06:11.300
So they did radioisotopes, so that has a half-life.

06:11.300 --> 06:15.400
There is going to be a point where you can't keep it warm enough that the whole thing doesn't

06:15.400 --> 06:16.400
freeze.

06:16.400 --> 06:20.320
So slowly over the years, they said, okay, we don't need the cameras anymore.

06:20.320 --> 06:21.320
We are way too far out.

06:21.320 --> 06:22.320
We can't get cameras.

06:22.320 --> 06:23.320
Shut that down.

06:23.320 --> 06:24.320
We don't need to keep them on.

06:24.320 --> 06:26.600
We don't need to keep that part of the space grow for warm.

06:26.600 --> 06:31.280
And just slowly but surely, dialing back which instruments to keep on, which instruments

06:31.280 --> 06:37.340
to stay warm, so that they can eek as much out of it as they can.

06:37.340 --> 06:41.560
You don't have to have thrusters or anything because in space-

06:41.560 --> 06:42.560
You just keep moving.

06:42.560 --> 06:43.560
Yeah.

06:43.560 --> 06:46.480
Physics says unless something stops it, it's just going to go forever.

06:46.480 --> 06:47.480
Right.

06:47.480 --> 06:50.080
If something stopped it, that in itself would be quite the discovery.

06:50.080 --> 06:51.080
Yes.

06:51.080 --> 06:52.080
Very true.

06:52.080 --> 06:59.200
I kind of hope in a way, even once it's powered off and they can no longer keep its components

06:59.200 --> 07:03.500
warm because that's really, that's one of the major power uses is the camera only gets

07:03.500 --> 07:06.680
turned on from time to time or these things get turned on and off, but it has to keep

07:06.680 --> 07:09.220
components from completely freezing out there.

07:09.220 --> 07:11.320
And that is a significant constant use of power.

07:11.320 --> 07:14.160
So eventually, like Heather says, that will run out.

07:14.160 --> 07:19.080
But in a way though, it will continue as a monument of humanity.

07:19.080 --> 07:22.560
Oh yeah, and the data we have isn't going anywhere.

07:22.560 --> 07:26.080
When they saw one of the coronal mass ejections and they said, oh, you know, this is, we can

07:26.080 --> 07:31.600
sort of translate this to sound and hey, we see this two big things coming here and they

07:31.600 --> 07:32.600
follow a slope.

07:32.600 --> 07:34.160
Let's keep following the slope back.

07:34.160 --> 07:39.360
Oh wait, there was a smaller something that happened along that line four years ago that

07:39.360 --> 07:41.980
we just didn't take note of.

07:41.980 --> 07:47.520
So we can continue to pull data out of this for pretty much as long as we come up with

07:47.520 --> 07:51.960
ideas of, is that noise or is that something?

07:51.960 --> 07:52.960
That's great.

07:52.960 --> 07:56.400
So there's discoveries that can happen even years later.

07:56.400 --> 07:57.680
We just keep learning.

07:57.680 --> 08:04.760
But there's also the aspect that on this is there's this famous golden record that contains

08:04.760 --> 08:08.760
different aspects of our cultures and humanity.

08:08.760 --> 08:15.240
And The Verge did a decoding of the record and I have a little sample of what they discovered.

08:15.240 --> 08:25.800
Sounds in 55 languages, samples of music from around the world, sounds of earth, such as

08:25.800 --> 08:30.680
oceans, birds, thunder, and whales.

08:30.680 --> 08:34.280
And on the other side, this.

08:34.280 --> 08:38.080
It's that sound that contains all of the image data for the photos and drawings contained

08:38.080 --> 08:39.440
on the golden record.

08:39.440 --> 08:43.320
And using the process described in the last few symbols on the cover, we can render the

08:43.320 --> 08:44.320
images.

08:44.320 --> 08:48.160
It's almost kind of like a modem, like it's, you know, sort of that same kind of idea.

08:48.160 --> 08:51.320
And what's incredible about this golden record and I encourage people to look at pictures

08:51.320 --> 08:58.640
online of this is they printed a decoding guide on there and there was there was just

08:58.640 --> 09:05.520
incredible thought put into trying to create a language that is based on universal properties

09:05.520 --> 09:06.520
of space.

09:06.520 --> 09:07.520
Well, what a challenge.

09:07.520 --> 09:11.320
You don't have much to work with when you might be speaking to a totally unknown alien

09:11.320 --> 09:12.320
civilization.

09:12.320 --> 09:13.320
Right.

09:13.320 --> 09:17.480
So I'm going to use a wavelength between two hydrogen atoms or whatever the term would

09:17.480 --> 09:18.480
be.

09:18.480 --> 09:19.480
What would be the term there?

09:19.480 --> 09:20.480
Hydrogen molecules?

09:20.480 --> 09:22.240
Yeah, it's there.

09:22.240 --> 09:29.320
That diagram is like, occasionally, those the spin of those molecules flip.

09:29.320 --> 09:30.880
And so they're trying to describe that moment.

09:30.880 --> 09:36.740
It's like when it flips, this specific moment is the simplest atom we can think of.

09:36.740 --> 09:40.080
There's this distance and this spin and this speed going on.

09:40.080 --> 09:46.200
They're like, let's, let's try to talk about this in atoms and molecules so that somebody

09:46.200 --> 09:49.800
that we don't know, that we obviously don't speak their language to, with the best shot

09:49.800 --> 09:53.000
of possible of trying to explain to them how to play a record player.

09:53.000 --> 09:54.000
Right.

09:54.000 --> 09:56.760
I mean, you'd think if you managed to get out in space or somehow come in contact with

09:56.760 --> 10:01.160
this record, that civilization would probably started investigating the basic physics of,

10:01.160 --> 10:02.160
you know, hydrogen.

10:02.160 --> 10:03.160
Right.

10:03.160 --> 10:04.400
They'd have to, you would think.

10:04.400 --> 10:06.120
So it's a safe assumption to make.

10:06.120 --> 10:08.520
And it's such a brilliant starting space.

10:08.520 --> 10:10.600
So then from there, you get basic measurements.

10:10.600 --> 10:15.000
And from there, you can deduce how to decode the imagery that is embedded in those sounds.

10:15.000 --> 10:16.000
Yeah.

10:16.000 --> 10:17.000
And that's like on the cover.

10:17.000 --> 10:22.520
So it's like the first thing seen is, you know, very basic instructions on how to play

10:22.520 --> 10:23.520
this.

10:23.520 --> 10:29.080
One side has all the sounds and the other side has all the image modem sounds.

10:29.080 --> 10:33.840
So it's like how to take that from modem sounds to actual images and try to make sense of

10:33.840 --> 10:34.840
that.

10:34.840 --> 10:41.080
And then also a diagram of sort of where Earth is and compared to specific type of neutron

10:41.080 --> 10:44.200
stars because they have a very specific wavelength that you can identify.

10:44.200 --> 10:46.960
So it's like, here's where this came from.

10:46.960 --> 10:49.800
Here's our return postage information.

10:49.800 --> 10:53.840
And here's how to read our magical disk.

10:53.840 --> 10:54.840
Isn't that incredible?

10:54.840 --> 10:57.560
And here's if you're getting it right, you should see this.

10:57.560 --> 11:01.400
And if you see this, keep just using this methodology to decode the rest.

11:01.400 --> 11:03.720
And it's true genius.

11:03.720 --> 11:07.320
And when I think about true genius, I do think about how Carl Sagan was involved with the

11:07.320 --> 11:08.320
project.

11:08.320 --> 11:11.960
Here's a little bit of Carl introducing the golden record.

11:11.960 --> 11:16.960
Voyager's passage by Jupiter accelerated it towards a close encounter with the planet

11:16.960 --> 11:17.960
Saturn.

11:17.960 --> 11:21.000
Saturn's gravity will propel it on to Uranus.

11:21.000 --> 11:27.640
And in this game of cosmic billiards after Uranus, it will plunge on past Neptune, leaving

11:27.640 --> 11:34.720
the solar system and becoming an interstellar spacecraft destined to wander forever the

11:34.720 --> 11:36.920
great ocean between the stars.

11:36.920 --> 11:44.840
And as Voyager should sometime in its distant future encounter beings from some other civilization

11:44.840 --> 11:54.720
in space, it bears a message, a phonograph record, golden, delicate, with instructions

11:54.720 --> 11:55.720
for use.

11:55.720 --> 12:01.800
And on this record are a sampling of pictures, sounds, greetings and an hour and a half of

12:01.800 --> 12:07.200
exquisite music, the Earth's greatest hits.

12:07.200 --> 12:09.040
You know what's also amazing about that?

12:09.040 --> 12:12.200
The golden record isn't adding anything of scientific value.

12:12.200 --> 12:14.600
It's not helping record measurements.

12:14.600 --> 12:19.800
This is in some ways the first of our species really taking seriously the idea there might

12:19.800 --> 12:24.440
be someone else out there, at least enough to allocate the weight of the record on the

12:24.440 --> 12:25.440
spacecraft.

12:25.440 --> 12:28.280
In my introduction, it's like, it's really us dreaming as big as it can get.

12:28.280 --> 12:29.280
Yeah.

12:29.280 --> 12:35.640
I mean, that idea of that in itself, rode over to some of the instrumentation where

12:35.640 --> 12:40.800
NASA sort of told everyone, you know, this will last for four years, design for that.

12:40.800 --> 12:46.920
And some groups went, yeah, sure, four years, wink.

12:46.920 --> 12:53.400
And just put as much into strengthening this as possible and giving it the best shot it

12:53.400 --> 12:55.800
had at going as long as it might.

12:55.800 --> 12:57.200
Thank goodness they did too.

12:57.200 --> 12:58.200
And what an exercise.

12:58.200 --> 13:01.640
And what if, especially when you're, you know, you're exploring a new territory, how do you

13:01.640 --> 13:06.920
plan for that strong magnetic fields and what ever might be outside the solar system?

13:06.920 --> 13:11.560
The fact that it had to go through Jupiter and Saturn, there were really strong radio

13:11.560 --> 13:12.780
fields, magnetic fields.

13:12.780 --> 13:14.120
So they had to really strengthen.

13:14.120 --> 13:20.240
It was the first time they sort of strengthened all the electronics and the computers enough

13:20.240 --> 13:22.840
to handle that going into space.

13:22.840 --> 13:26.520
So that gave it a better shot at surviving long term too.

13:26.520 --> 13:29.760
So Heather, from your understanding, what is Carl Sagan's real involvement with the

13:29.760 --> 13:30.760
project?

13:30.760 --> 13:33.800
Because I know he was a consultant since the 1950s.

13:33.800 --> 13:34.800
Was he very involved?

13:34.800 --> 13:39.040
Yeah, some people know him as being involved with the pale blue dot picture.

13:39.040 --> 13:41.960
But he'd been involved with NASA for a really long time.

13:41.960 --> 13:45.100
He briefed Apollo astronauts before their flights to the moon.

13:45.100 --> 13:53.400
He helped design numerous spacecraft missions to Venus and to Mars and the Voyagers.

13:53.400 --> 13:58.480
And when he became a member of the imaging team, I mean, years after it launched, it's

13:58.480 --> 14:04.120
been in space for years, that's when he came up with the idea of use the cameras, point

14:04.120 --> 14:06.360
back to Earth, take a picture.

14:06.360 --> 14:11.280
They knew it would be an incredibly small pixel out of this giant picture that they

14:11.280 --> 14:12.640
were taking.

14:12.640 --> 14:17.740
That was the point of it to say, look back here, all the planets spread out that we can

14:17.740 --> 14:22.280
take a picture of and Earth is two thirds of a pixel.

14:22.280 --> 14:23.280
We are tiny.

14:23.280 --> 14:26.560
Yeah, that really puts it in perspective.

14:26.560 --> 14:28.400
It's humbling, actually.

14:28.400 --> 14:33.320
And I think Carl did a really good job of bringing that point home.

14:33.320 --> 14:35.120
He was such an eloquent speaker.

14:35.120 --> 14:38.880
So he was such a great advocate for this project.

14:38.880 --> 14:40.640
I'll just give you a sample.

14:40.640 --> 14:42.760
I love hearing from Carl.

14:42.760 --> 14:47.360
That's here, that's home, that's us.

14:47.360 --> 14:54.880
On it, everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human being

14:54.880 --> 14:59.240
who ever was, lived out their lives.

14:59.240 --> 15:06.160
The aggregate of our joy and suffering, thousands of confident religions, ideologies, and economic

15:06.160 --> 15:13.120
doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer

15:13.120 --> 15:21.160
of civilization, every king and peasant, every young couple in love, every mother and father,

15:21.160 --> 15:28.720
hopeful child, inventor and explorer, every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician,

15:28.720 --> 15:36.680
every superstar, every supreme leader, every saint and sinner in the history of our species

15:36.680 --> 15:38.100
lived there.

15:38.100 --> 15:40.040
Really puts it in perspective, doesn't it?

15:40.040 --> 15:41.040
Oh yeah.

15:41.040 --> 15:46.120
The picture of Earth was the last image taken by Voyager 1.

15:46.120 --> 15:49.920
Just a little over half an hour after it took the picture of Earth, power to the cameras

15:49.920 --> 15:52.400
got shut down, never turned on again.

15:52.400 --> 15:55.240
It took them two and a half months to send those pictures back.

15:55.240 --> 16:00.280
I mean, that was the last picture they said, all right, this is the last idea.

16:00.280 --> 16:02.080
We want to try to take a picture of Earth.

16:02.080 --> 16:03.080
We'll see what happens.

16:03.080 --> 16:06.360
So they didn't know whether it would actually take.

16:06.360 --> 16:11.440
They just aimed, took the picture, hoped they would find something, figured they would be

16:11.440 --> 16:13.400
able to see a little something.

16:13.400 --> 16:17.660
And then two and a half months later, they were able to say, now we've got it all together.

16:17.660 --> 16:19.520
Now we have the famous pale blue dot picture.

16:19.520 --> 16:21.720
Could you imagine the anticipation of that?

16:21.720 --> 16:22.720
Oh yeah.

16:22.720 --> 16:24.840
Saying they're waiting for that.

16:24.840 --> 16:28.360
I just, I can only imagine because of the transmission rate, there's so much they couldn't

16:28.360 --> 16:29.360
do with this machine.

16:29.360 --> 16:32.880
Well, and the, and the whole, the whole mission was, was like that, you know, because there's

16:32.880 --> 16:36.720
long times in between visiting planets, so you just have weeks of nothing.

16:36.720 --> 16:40.520
And then suddenly you're receiving data 24 seven, I mean, there's stories of people just

16:40.520 --> 16:43.640
sleeping in their cars, not sleeping at all, because you don't want to miss a second of

16:43.640 --> 16:44.640
this.

16:44.640 --> 16:45.640
The job goes from zero to a hundred.

16:45.640 --> 16:46.640
Oh yeah.

16:46.640 --> 16:51.320
That's how these, a lot of these space, you know, outer planet spacecraft work.

16:51.320 --> 16:54.880
It's 10 years of waiting with the occasional call in.

16:54.880 --> 16:55.880
Still going good.

16:55.880 --> 16:56.880
Okay, good.

16:56.880 --> 16:57.880
Thumbs up.

16:57.880 --> 16:58.880
All right.

16:58.880 --> 16:59.880
Keep on going.

16:59.880 --> 17:00.880
A few months of complete craziness.

17:00.880 --> 17:03.880
I hope you caught up on your sleep because you probably don't want to for about two and

17:03.880 --> 17:04.880
a half months.

17:04.880 --> 17:07.800
So you kind of piqued my interest with the transmission speed.

17:07.800 --> 17:11.460
What do we know about the tech in the Voyager probes?

17:11.460 --> 17:17.880
They have about just a little under 70 kilobytes of memory total and complete.

17:17.880 --> 17:18.880
Wow.

17:18.880 --> 17:19.880
Ouch.

17:19.880 --> 17:20.880
They work on eight tracks.

17:20.880 --> 17:24.480
I can't believe they've held up this long.

17:24.480 --> 17:26.280
I know my family's didn't.

17:26.280 --> 17:32.400
They were designed so that they wouldn't wear out until the tape had moved back and forth

17:32.400 --> 17:34.980
the equivalent of the width of the United States.

17:34.980 --> 17:40.440
So that's like a two hour VHS playing once a day for 33 years without failure.

17:40.440 --> 17:43.640
So these are rather expensive eight track tapes, I'm guessing.

17:43.640 --> 17:46.960
Well, now that they've been in space, extra expensive, but.

17:46.960 --> 17:48.160
No kidding.

17:48.160 --> 17:51.400
Could you imagine somebody coming along and just taking those eight tracks?

17:51.400 --> 17:52.400
No.

17:52.400 --> 17:54.240
For the Galactic Museum.

17:54.240 --> 17:57.600
You know, in the future when humanity's reached out into space and it's just a bunch of jerks.

17:57.600 --> 18:01.120
It'd be a nice trophy.

18:01.120 --> 18:03.040
But you mentioned the speed as well.

18:03.040 --> 18:06.840
It's only we're getting the data about 160 bits per second.

18:06.840 --> 18:07.840
OK.

18:07.840 --> 18:10.440
Yeah, I can see why that would take a few days to transfer an image.

18:10.440 --> 18:11.440
Yes.

18:11.440 --> 18:15.280
You know, honestly, even that fast seems impressive for how far away it is.

18:15.280 --> 18:16.280
And again, 1977.

18:16.280 --> 18:19.960
We didn't even have Internet, so can't make a dial-up joke.

18:19.960 --> 18:20.960
There wasn't dial-up.

18:20.960 --> 18:24.480
That is the first Internet Voyager calling home.

18:24.480 --> 18:25.480
Completely wireless dial-up.

18:25.480 --> 18:27.400
Yeah, there's your wireless Internet for sure.

18:27.400 --> 18:28.400
Wow.

18:28.400 --> 18:30.080
160 bits per second.

18:30.080 --> 18:36.080
So they must have to be really, really, really lean with the software.

18:36.080 --> 18:39.040
Are they still sending software code up to this thing?

18:39.040 --> 18:40.040
They did at one point.

18:40.040 --> 18:47.000
It was originally in Fortran 5, and then they were able to send an upgrade to get most up

18:47.000 --> 18:49.280
to Fortran 77.

18:49.280 --> 18:54.320
Could you imagine the nerves upgrading a spacecraft that is out by Pluto?

18:54.320 --> 18:58.920
They even had to upgrade Voyager 2 right after launch to fix some customization.

18:58.920 --> 18:59.920
Wow.

18:59.920 --> 19:00.920
But it's true.

19:00.920 --> 19:06.160
Voyager 2 launched first, and it's on in the rocket.

19:06.160 --> 19:08.720
So as it was launching, it was freaking out.

19:08.720 --> 19:10.280
It's like, wait a minute, why am I shaking?

19:10.280 --> 19:11.840
Why don't I have any control?

19:11.840 --> 19:12.840
What's going on?

19:12.840 --> 19:14.680
And it started freaking out.

19:14.680 --> 19:18.760
And it took them a little while before one of the programmers was able to find just the

19:18.760 --> 19:22.560
right bit of code to reach out and be like, okay, pause, calm down.

19:22.560 --> 19:24.760
Let us tell you what's happening.

19:24.760 --> 19:27.960
And then they had to upgrade Voyager 1, which launched second.

19:27.960 --> 19:31.040
So they upgraded that software really quick so it didn't freak out because it would have

19:31.040 --> 19:32.040
done the same thing.

19:32.040 --> 19:33.040
It would have freaked out.

19:33.040 --> 19:34.040
Sure.

19:34.040 --> 19:37.320
I mean, can you imagine these days when you mess up your web app and you just hit deploy

19:37.320 --> 19:41.560
on GitHub and a new release rolls out, it's pretty different than patching a spacecraft.

19:41.560 --> 19:45.400
Especially at those speeds, that's incredible that they've been able to do that remotely.

19:45.400 --> 19:53.280
I mean, I just, again, I'm dumbfounded by the resiliency of these systems, the backups

19:53.280 --> 19:56.520
and also the support team that must have remained on the ground.

19:56.520 --> 20:00.640
There must have been people that have to be trained up in this stuff now.

20:00.640 --> 20:01.640
Yes.

20:01.640 --> 20:06.120
And actually, Voyager lasted so much longer than originally anticipated.

20:06.120 --> 20:10.600
Also changed the way they put together teams for these spacecraft.

20:10.600 --> 20:16.960
When the New Horizons spacecraft went to Pluto, they specifically chose a certain percentage

20:16.960 --> 20:24.180
of the team to be as young as they could because they realized these things last for a while

20:24.180 --> 20:27.960
in one, two, three decades.

20:27.960 --> 20:30.680
You might need to ask somebody on the team what happened.

20:30.680 --> 20:35.800
And if all you have is senior engineers that are all going to be retired or not around

20:35.800 --> 20:39.560
in three decades, there's nobody to ask questions of.

20:39.560 --> 20:43.700
So for these longer missions, they spread out the age range.

20:43.700 --> 20:47.720
So as they bring on new people, you still have some of the original team members that

20:47.720 --> 20:51.680
knew, oh, yeah, I remember them talking about X, Y, or Z.

20:51.680 --> 20:55.960
That's exactly the next level of planning that is just so impressive about this whole

20:55.960 --> 20:56.960
program.

20:56.960 --> 20:57.960
Really is.

20:57.960 --> 21:01.080
I mean, could you imagine working on a project where that's a consideration?

21:01.080 --> 21:06.440
This project must have been really a mind bender for those working on it because they're

21:06.440 --> 21:10.440
designing something that's going to go possibly far beyond our solar system.

21:10.440 --> 21:17.280
It's taking a message written in a universal language to potentially another society.

21:17.280 --> 21:19.280
And that's just their day to day job.

21:19.280 --> 21:22.940
They're just building this thing and sending it out there and trying to figure out generational

21:22.940 --> 21:25.040
project teams and things like that.

21:25.040 --> 21:27.720
It's just an incredible, it's an incredible set of work.

21:27.720 --> 21:31.000
And I'm just so grateful that it happened because now I look at it and I just find it

21:31.000 --> 21:32.000
inspirational.

21:32.000 --> 21:34.520
You know, I find the whole thing incredibly inspirational.

21:34.520 --> 21:38.920
I mean, it's taught us so much about our solar system and our place in the universe.

21:38.920 --> 21:40.520
And what we can accomplish.

21:40.520 --> 21:42.800
And Voyager has a number of firsts under its belt.

21:42.800 --> 21:46.520
I mean, I mentioned before they were first to be protected in such the way that it was

21:46.520 --> 21:49.760
for electrostatic discharge, for radiation.

21:49.760 --> 21:55.080
The first time that we actually had a programmable computer controlled altitude and articulation.

21:55.080 --> 21:56.420
So it could control itself.

21:56.420 --> 21:58.800
It wasn't waiting to hear from us.

21:58.800 --> 22:04.720
The fault protection, the way we talk to it, the way we bring radio antennas together here

22:04.720 --> 22:07.960
on Earth to be able to listen to it and talk to it.

22:07.960 --> 22:08.960
Oh, wow.

22:08.960 --> 22:14.240
And as the timeline went on, then we became, they had became the farthest manmade objects

22:14.240 --> 22:18.240
when they hit the edge of the solar system.

22:18.240 --> 22:23.160
We knew it was sort of a bubble where the sun is shooting out a whole bunch more than

22:23.160 --> 22:24.300
light.

22:24.300 --> 22:27.320
It protects us from the galaxy at large.

22:27.320 --> 22:31.520
So we had these ideas of what it was shaped like, what our little bubble going along the

22:31.520 --> 22:33.580
stream of the galaxy is.

22:33.580 --> 22:36.200
But as the Voyagers hit, they're going in two different directions.

22:36.200 --> 22:40.720
One along the plane of the planets and one going vertical of the plane.

22:40.720 --> 22:46.280
And so as they hit those termination bowels and went into interstellar space, we were

22:46.280 --> 22:51.240
able to know for sure the possible shape of our bubble.

22:51.240 --> 22:52.860
It's not a circular bubble.

22:52.860 --> 22:57.400
It's kind of more teardropped and, you know, what interstellar space is like.

22:57.400 --> 23:03.200
It's our first steps into this new world and it's about to be a little more alone.

23:03.200 --> 23:07.920
NASA recently announced that due to some upgrades planned for that giant radio antenna we use

23:07.920 --> 23:12.160
to talk to Voyager 2, it's going to be silent for the next 11 months.

23:12.160 --> 23:17.480
So we won't know until January 2021 if we can still talk to it.

23:17.480 --> 23:18.480
Wow.

23:18.480 --> 23:19.480
That's a long time.

23:19.480 --> 23:20.760
Just alone in the void.

23:20.760 --> 23:24.280
Out there on its own because the groundwork that has to be done, huh?

23:24.280 --> 23:25.800
I guess they must have been putting that off.

23:25.800 --> 23:26.800
Yeah.

23:26.800 --> 23:32.020
These antennas are, you know, multiple decades, you know, 30, 40, 50 years old and the actual

23:32.020 --> 23:36.480
physical facilities themselves just have to have maintenance.

23:36.480 --> 23:38.760
And in order to do that maintenance, you have to take things down.

23:38.760 --> 23:39.760
Fair enough.

23:39.760 --> 23:43.520
I guess we'll find out in January 2021 how it's doing.

23:43.520 --> 23:45.320
Hopefully it's still out there responding to us.

23:45.320 --> 23:49.760
Could you imagine the team that's going to be sitting there waiting to their seats?

23:49.760 --> 23:50.760
Yes.

23:50.760 --> 23:51.760
I'll be waiting too.

23:51.760 --> 23:53.720
Well, Heather, thank you for joining us and going over.

23:53.720 --> 23:55.040
This has been really nice.

23:55.040 --> 23:56.480
Thank you for inviting me.

23:56.480 --> 23:57.480
Now what do you say?
