WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:07.600
It's Office Hours, with Chris.

00:07.600 --> 00:09.640
That's me, Office Hours, welcome in.

00:09.640 --> 00:17.960
Hey everybody, welcome to a new thing I just made up.

00:17.960 --> 00:21.880
It's called Office Hours with Chris, where I thought I'd answer questions and read emails.

00:21.880 --> 00:25.160
And since I never told anybody I was doing this, I just had to pick some random emails

00:25.160 --> 00:26.440
to start with.

00:26.440 --> 00:34.080
And that's how, what I'm going to guess is Vekko, Vekko, Vekko, I'm going with Vekko.

00:34.080 --> 00:36.360
That's how Vekko got into the show here.

00:36.360 --> 00:38.560
He writes about the enthusiast trap.

00:38.560 --> 00:42.680
And keep in mind the context of a couple of weeks ago as I record this.

00:42.680 --> 00:50.440
There was a big hoopla around Mangero bundling free office in place of libre office.

00:50.440 --> 00:52.200
And so that's the context for this email.

00:52.200 --> 00:55.080
And of course I should say, Vekko, welcome, welcome into the office.

00:55.080 --> 00:56.080
I'm glad you're here.

00:56.080 --> 01:01.040
Anyways, he writes, I recently heard of a name for the phenomenon that is happening

01:01.040 --> 01:03.560
with the Mangero community.

01:03.560 --> 01:05.320
It's called the enthusiast trap.

01:05.320 --> 01:08.160
I first heard about it from a video by LowSpecGamer.

01:08.160 --> 01:12.760
I will put a link to that video in the show notes so you can see the whole thing.

01:12.760 --> 01:19.480
But the TLDR is the enthusiast market is very small, very demanding, and the least loyal

01:19.480 --> 01:20.480
of them all.

01:20.480 --> 01:23.080
I'm going to pause here for a second.

01:23.080 --> 01:27.720
The loyalty thing struck me when I first read this, but then I think about it.

01:27.720 --> 01:32.260
One of the number one kind of reactions on the negative side of Mangero bundling free

01:32.260 --> 01:36.680
office, one of the number one go to responses was, well, that's it, I'm leaving.

01:36.680 --> 01:39.360
Which distro should I switch to next?

01:39.360 --> 01:40.760
Boom.

01:40.760 --> 01:42.200
All that loyalty gone.

01:42.200 --> 01:45.980
So I actually, at first I read that and I kind of didn't like the way that felt.

01:45.980 --> 01:47.840
But then I thought about it and he's right.

01:47.840 --> 01:52.840
Like the enthusiast markets educated, they're capable of shifting to a different product.

01:52.840 --> 01:55.200
And so they'll take advantage of that capability.

01:55.200 --> 02:00.160
He says, and for a company to grow, it will eventually need to abandon these enthusiasts

02:00.160 --> 02:03.400
to appeal to a more mainstream audience.

02:03.400 --> 02:09.860
This of course will then upset the enthusiasts who are very aware and they are demanding.

02:09.860 --> 02:15.040
And as we can demonstrate non loyal customers, which will jump ship very quickly, the enthusiasts

02:15.040 --> 02:19.960
can't really be blamed for being upset either since they probably did a lot of the free

02:19.960 --> 02:26.280
marketing for that company or like in the case of a Linux distribution for that distribution.

02:26.280 --> 02:32.280
Even some more demanding work like reporting bugs or fixing bugs and submitting patches

02:32.280 --> 02:35.460
or doing tech support in the community.

02:35.460 --> 02:38.360
And they do have a legitimate claim to that time.

02:38.360 --> 02:42.120
He goes on to say, in hindsight, this applies to a lot of things that seem to happen in

02:42.120 --> 02:43.280
the Linux community.

02:43.280 --> 02:44.280
Love the shows by the way.

02:44.280 --> 02:45.360
Well, thank you, Vecho.

02:45.360 --> 02:49.680
Hopefully I'm getting somewhere near, well, I guess it doesn't really matter.

02:49.680 --> 02:52.280
That's just how it's going to be pronounced because you're not here to correct me.

02:52.280 --> 02:54.960
You're in my office, but it's my rules.

02:54.960 --> 02:56.600
All right.

02:56.600 --> 02:59.200
I love your, I love your finding here.

02:59.200 --> 03:06.280
And it's interesting to watch the LowSpecGamer video, which was really more about why some

03:06.280 --> 03:12.120
of the founders of Oculus are leaving and be able to drive sort of insights into your

03:12.120 --> 03:13.440
local community.

03:13.440 --> 03:18.180
And that's actually a pretty powerful tool because humans be humans everywhere.

03:18.180 --> 03:19.800
And there's a lot of that in every group.

03:19.800 --> 03:23.480
And I think we sometimes get really hard on ourselves because we think Linux users are

03:23.480 --> 03:25.580
so bad.

03:25.580 --> 03:27.500
It's enthusiast.

03:27.500 --> 03:38.260
It's tribalism, not such a loaded term, but it's people that want to signal what kind

03:38.260 --> 03:41.360
of ideals that they have and hold.

03:41.360 --> 03:47.280
And they're looking for other people that hold those same ideas and signals because

03:47.280 --> 03:49.640
it's a way to determine safety.

03:49.640 --> 03:54.200
It's a way to determine common values so they're more likely somebody you can trust.

03:54.200 --> 03:55.200
It's instinctual.

03:55.200 --> 03:58.600
It's necessary for human survival.

03:58.600 --> 04:02.920
And without it, we wouldn't be able to have an economy.

04:02.920 --> 04:04.340
You wouldn't be able to have a market system.

04:04.340 --> 04:10.520
So it's, I don't know how to solve the problem other than trying to talk about it in a way

04:10.520 --> 04:19.600
that is both open and understanding, but doesn't really encourage it.

04:19.600 --> 04:24.960
I've really been trying to take on this mantra of, you know, this type of Linux doesn't work

04:24.960 --> 04:28.240
for me, but that doesn't mean it doesn't work for you.

04:28.240 --> 04:29.400
An example is Gnome Shell.

04:29.400 --> 04:34.160
For a long, long time, you know, just Gnome Shell hasn't really worked well for me.

04:34.160 --> 04:39.320
But somehow the project continues on with more and more users all the time.

04:39.320 --> 04:41.200
So what should I take away from that?

04:41.200 --> 04:45.320
That Gnome Shell is crap and garbage and should be completely redone?

04:45.320 --> 04:48.920
Or that perhaps it just doesn't work perfectly for me?

04:48.920 --> 04:52.440
And that there are tools that work better for me, just like Gnome Shell is a tool that

04:52.440 --> 04:54.440
works better for others.

04:54.440 --> 04:58.560
And I think we just have to start encouraging that kind of conversation and it'll catch

04:58.560 --> 04:59.560
on.

04:59.560 --> 05:00.560
That's something we try to do through the shows.

05:00.560 --> 05:02.880
I don't know if it is catching on.

05:02.880 --> 05:04.960
It seems like people are becoming more aware of it.

05:04.960 --> 05:09.880
And it's definitely like by these emails, it seems like the awareness is increasing

05:09.880 --> 05:10.880
in the audience.

05:10.880 --> 05:11.880
And I agree.

05:11.880 --> 05:15.840
The enthusiast trap is a really tricky thing for companies to deal with because you do

05:15.840 --> 05:21.460
have to start to appeal to a broader audience if you want to grow beyond a certain niche.

05:21.460 --> 05:25.080
Or you have to determine that you can sustain a business in that niche and you're happy

05:25.080 --> 05:26.080
with it.

05:26.080 --> 05:27.320
But that doesn't happen a lot.

05:27.320 --> 05:30.480
I mean, you look at Apple, for example.

05:30.480 --> 05:36.000
When the iPhone was exploding, they really had a hard time paying attention to the needs

05:36.000 --> 05:40.040
of their Mac users, especially the professional Mac users.

05:40.040 --> 05:44.800
And now, as the iPhone is becoming about 40% of their business and the other elements of

05:44.800 --> 05:48.760
their business are making up the slack, all of a sudden the Mac is becoming more important

05:48.760 --> 05:51.040
again.

05:51.040 --> 05:54.560
And now you're starting to see things like the Mac Pro, the iMac Pro, the refreshed Mac

05:54.560 --> 05:57.040
Mini, and the new rumored MacBook Pro.

05:57.040 --> 06:02.400
Plus on top of that though, which I think is even more of a signal from Apple, is their

06:02.400 --> 06:10.120
top executives like Craig Federighi and Phil Schiller are going on enthusiast podcasts.

06:10.120 --> 06:13.000
They're going on those guys' shows.

06:13.000 --> 06:16.260
That's like talking directly to the enthusiast market now.

06:16.260 --> 06:20.700
They've gone from ignoring the enthusiast market to building hardware for them and going

06:20.700 --> 06:23.440
on platforms in which they tune into.

06:23.440 --> 06:27.240
And I think that is sort of a re... you can see in these last two years.

06:27.240 --> 06:32.240
I think it's kind of neat to watch, especially from afar because I got no skin in the game

06:32.240 --> 06:33.800
so I can go, look at this.

06:33.800 --> 06:34.800
They're listening again.

06:34.800 --> 06:39.320
They're putting decent hardware out again.

06:39.320 --> 06:43.320
It's unbelievably expensive, but that's a different conversation.

06:43.320 --> 06:49.340
And I think you see this realignment in their priorities and companies struggle with this.

06:49.340 --> 06:51.760
They really do struggle with this.

06:51.760 --> 06:57.960
And so as they grow to a wider, broader market, listening to that niche audience who can seem

06:57.960 --> 07:05.520
extra demanding and pandemic almost can feel like a waste of your time because you have

07:05.520 --> 07:11.880
this broader millions of more potentials X of whatever it might be.

07:11.880 --> 07:18.800
And but the thing is, you really have to walk a fine line there because your most loyal

07:18.800 --> 07:23.160
fans are really the ones that can help you get the word out.

07:23.160 --> 07:26.040
They can, they'll be the first to try that new product.

07:26.040 --> 07:27.480
Maybe it's the watch or not my case.

07:27.480 --> 07:28.480
Maybe it's a podcast, right?

07:28.480 --> 07:31.420
They'll be the first to try that new thing.

07:31.420 --> 07:32.420
So it serves them.

07:32.420 --> 07:37.720
It serves the longterm health of the organization or the project to keep the fans happy.

07:37.720 --> 07:44.180
And that's why when I cover in love, Mangero's deciding to take out free office, but instead

07:44.180 --> 07:49.360
give the user a choice of free office, LibreOffice or no office at the install time is a pretty

07:49.360 --> 07:53.480
reasonable compromise because for those folks that want to still take advantage of the free

07:53.480 --> 08:00.240
office improvements for particularly types of cranky doc format conversions, it's there

08:00.240 --> 08:01.480
for them now.

08:01.480 --> 08:06.120
And for those that want to stick with LibreOffice, still available right there front and center.

08:06.120 --> 08:12.040
And for those like me now that want no office, that's even better.

08:12.040 --> 08:15.800
So anyways, thank you for the email and I'll go ahead and get out of here, go.

08:15.800 --> 08:16.800
Jack's got to get in here.

08:16.800 --> 08:18.480
So Jack, welcome into my office.

08:18.480 --> 08:22.760
And he wrote in about Nextcloud, we've been talking Nextcloud, haven't really said much

08:22.760 --> 08:23.760
about it recently.

08:23.760 --> 08:28.040
So I thought this would probably be a pretty good chance right here.

08:28.040 --> 08:29.040
Here's what Jack writes.

08:29.040 --> 08:32.520
Hey Chris, I had some tips for Nextcloud features that I didn't hear mentioned that you would

08:32.520 --> 08:34.640
definitely find useful.

08:34.640 --> 08:37.280
I've been using Nextcloud since the own cloud fork.

08:37.280 --> 08:42.640
So maybe about three years, and it's become my favorite, most useful self-hosted server

08:42.640 --> 08:45.700
other than my Plex and Jellyfin VM.

08:45.700 --> 08:50.180
Number one is external storage, allows you to map a folder in Nextcloud to an external

08:50.180 --> 08:57.680
storage provider by either SIF, Samba, Amazon's AWS, OpenStack, SFTP, Dropbox, etc.

08:57.680 --> 09:01.860
And then you can use it natively within Nextcloud's clients and the webpage.

09:01.860 --> 09:07.760
It can request credentials on access, store them, or authenticate against LDAP or federate

09:07.760 --> 09:10.240
with other Nextcloud instances.

09:10.240 --> 09:13.860
And then they're shareable with the Nextcloud permissions.

09:13.860 --> 09:14.860
That's a really cool thing.

09:14.860 --> 09:17.460
I actually am aware of external storage in our Nextcloud server.

09:17.460 --> 09:22.040
One of our production Nextcloud servers is, I don't think it's using the formal external

09:22.040 --> 09:27.520
storage, but it is doing digital ocean spaces, which is really kind of a cool thing.

09:27.520 --> 09:28.800
So check that out.

09:28.800 --> 09:30.560
So we are aware of external storage.

09:30.560 --> 09:35.600
I have had some performance issues with it in the past when I connected it to Google

09:35.600 --> 09:39.360
Drive and to Dropbox, so I haven't been all over it.

09:39.360 --> 09:41.660
But for those of you that aren't aware of it, that's a good one.

09:41.660 --> 09:45.280
He goes on to say it's a great way to also provide highly available interface to storage

09:45.280 --> 09:50.720
objects that otherwise wouldn't really be accessible outside the LAN or VPN, which leads

09:50.720 --> 09:51.720
him to the next one.

09:51.720 --> 09:53.520
Now this is a big one.

09:53.520 --> 09:55.120
Full text search.

09:55.120 --> 09:59.960
This is a plugin stack that provides an elastic search interface to your Nextcloud files and

09:59.960 --> 10:01.640
servers.

10:01.640 --> 10:03.800
It also has support for OCR.

10:03.800 --> 10:09.000
Combined with external storages, you could provide a full, incredibly fast search for

10:09.000 --> 10:14.800
not just file names, but the contents of everything Elasticsearch supports.

10:14.800 --> 10:19.180
Office formats, text, PDF, etc, etc.

10:19.180 --> 10:23.280
When my grandfather died, he asked me to make his documents and emails available to the

10:23.280 --> 10:24.280
family.

10:24.280 --> 10:27.560
And I used Nextcloud and full text search to do it.

10:27.560 --> 10:29.520
And it's an easy interface.

10:29.520 --> 10:33.880
I also used it to provide a text search for my entire home NAS, which is great when you're

10:33.880 --> 10:37.960
looking for, say, a tax document that you didn't name all that well and maybe didn't

10:37.960 --> 10:39.880
file in the best place.

10:39.880 --> 10:41.720
Hope you find these useful, Jack.

10:41.720 --> 10:43.560
I do find those useful.

10:43.560 --> 10:44.560
Thank you, Jack.

10:44.560 --> 10:45.560
That's really great.

10:45.560 --> 10:49.660
Now if you want to get into my office in the future, there's probably several ways you

10:49.660 --> 10:50.660
can do it.

10:50.660 --> 10:55.120
I'm monitoring different show inboxes, so sometimes I'll be picking up some of those

10:55.120 --> 11:00.720
questions that slip through the cracks and don't make it into a show, or your best bet,

11:00.720 --> 11:05.220
like if you specifically want to get in here, extras.show.com.

11:05.220 --> 11:07.520
You go over there and I'll be watching that.

11:07.520 --> 11:09.440
We can get something in here just for you and me.

11:09.440 --> 11:12.280
You got a question directly for me or Prospector Chris.

11:12.280 --> 11:14.520
That's who was just talking there for a second.

11:14.520 --> 11:19.620
You can go over to extras.show.com and drop it in there and I'll address it on a future

11:19.620 --> 11:22.000
office hours whenever that is.

11:22.000 --> 11:23.120
The office is busy, all right?

11:23.120 --> 11:24.500
I don't know when those are.

11:24.500 --> 11:30.280
So the best thing to do would be to go to extras.show.com and just get them.

11:30.280 --> 11:31.680
See you next time.

11:31.680 --> 11:32.680
Office hours are closed.

11:32.680 --> 11:33.680
Thanks for visiting.

11:33.680 --> 11:34.680
It's over.

11:34.680 --> 11:35.680
It's all done now.

11:35.680 --> 11:36.680
The office is closed.

11:36.680 --> 11:57.160
You got to go.
