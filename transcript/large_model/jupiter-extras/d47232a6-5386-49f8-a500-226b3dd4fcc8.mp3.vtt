00:00.000 --> 00:16.440
Well, hello. Today, I'm joined by Jacob Rucker. Some may know you, he's been a long time JB

00:16.440 --> 00:20.920
community member and listener for a long time. Jacob, how are you?

00:20.920 --> 00:23.280
I'm doing great. Thanks for having me.

00:23.280 --> 00:29.380
Thank you so much for reaching out to me. You've got a little bit of a pretty deep connection

00:29.380 --> 00:35.120
to the JB community. So I am really looking forward to learning about that story and diving

00:35.120 --> 00:40.380
into it. Tell me a little bit about where you are now.

00:40.380 --> 00:47.280
So currently in Boise, Idaho, which is like, the people here are like Canada nice is a

00:47.280 --> 00:49.280
good way to describe it.

00:49.280 --> 00:50.280
I know what that's like.

00:50.280 --> 00:54.680
Yep. And my wife's Canadian. So I think I can say that. Yes, yes.

00:54.680 --> 00:57.040
The connections. We already have connections. We're like 10 seconds in.

00:57.040 --> 01:01.800
Well, it works out pretty well. But she's from the other part of Canada. She's over

01:01.800 --> 01:05.400
in Alberta. And I think you're in the East Coast area or East side of Canada.

01:05.400 --> 01:11.440
I am north of Toronto. So I'm in Ontario. I'm north of Toronto in a place called Sudbury,

01:11.440 --> 01:19.720
but I'm in Eastern time zone. So you reached out to me and which I really appreciated and

01:19.720 --> 01:24.000
said, Hey, I've been listening to some of the conversations you've been having with

01:24.000 --> 01:28.000
people on on Brunch with Brent. And I think I might have a little bit of a story to tell

01:28.000 --> 01:33.840
that the community might appreciate. And we chatted a little bit about what that story

01:33.840 --> 01:37.480
was. And I kind of stopped you and said, No, no, no, don't tell me anymore. I want to,

01:37.480 --> 01:42.720
I want to have this be a really nice chat. That story, at least the parts that I heard

01:42.720 --> 01:48.160
sort of really hit me as really meaningful for you. And I just wondered if you wanted

01:48.160 --> 01:49.740
to start telling that story.

01:49.740 --> 01:54.760
So I started listening to JB, it must have been 2008. I think I was still living in Utah

01:54.760 --> 01:59.840
at the time. And found it because a friend of mine posted, I think, Linux action show

01:59.840 --> 02:04.560
on Facebook or something like that. And it got me interested in it. And previous to that,

02:04.560 --> 02:10.200
my experience with Linux was actually, so I was in the army for 20 years and I went

02:10.200 --> 02:15.880
to Iraq twice and then Afghanistan once. And the second time we went to Iraq, one of the

02:15.880 --> 02:19.880
things we were doing is there was, you know, your troop size changes. And so the footprint

02:19.880 --> 02:25.220
for support changes. So we were taking some old servers out of system and I was repurposing

02:25.220 --> 02:29.400
them to build a kind of a computer lab to train folks on, you know, how that technology

02:29.400 --> 02:36.260
worked. And I couldn't get a Windows Server 2003 installation disk because they were very

02:36.260 --> 02:40.920
controlled by our IT department, you know, licensing and whatnot. And Ubuntu had come

02:40.920 --> 02:45.960
out at the time, right? And so it was like, okay, well, let's try this thing. And so I

02:45.960 --> 02:48.880
ended up diving in and the internet was so slow.

02:48.880 --> 02:51.080
How slow is slow?

02:51.080 --> 02:54.800
Our backbone was no more than 768 K.

02:54.800 --> 03:00.280
Oh man. Okay. That puts it into context.

03:00.280 --> 03:06.280
Right. I mean, it was 2005, right? We downloaded Ubuntu at that bandwidth speed and then I

03:06.280 --> 03:10.760
even downloaded SUSE at the time as well and started playing with, you know, what can I

03:10.760 --> 03:15.320
do with these? How can I repurpose them to teach, you know, my soldiers some basic skills

03:15.320 --> 03:16.560
on this stuff?

03:16.560 --> 03:18.840
How had you heard about Linux in the first place?

03:18.840 --> 03:24.520
There was a national guard unit that was there and one of the guys had said, hey, try this.

03:24.520 --> 03:25.520
Okay.

03:25.520 --> 03:29.880
You know, most of us have come to it that way. It's like someone else just like had

03:29.880 --> 03:32.840
a quick conversation with us and said, you got to really like, this is going to work

03:32.840 --> 03:35.440
for you. It's so thankful that those moments happen, right?

03:35.440 --> 03:41.200
Right. And it was, it was cool. And then later on in college and this is how I started getting

03:41.200 --> 03:46.200
back into Linux, I was really excited to get a new computer for myself for all my work

03:46.200 --> 03:52.000
at college. And it was, you know, I love technology. Been online since like 93, 94 with prodigies

03:52.000 --> 03:58.080
network originally and stuff. And so I love what technology empowers people to do.

03:58.080 --> 04:01.160
And so at college I was really excited because I was going to get this machine that was built

04:01.160 --> 04:09.400
for windows Vista and it was built for windows Vista and it didn't work. It was so frustrating.

04:09.400 --> 04:13.120
I think many of us have been there, right?

04:13.120 --> 04:17.520
So what I learned from that is I learned that you can't just accept somebody else's all

04:17.520 --> 04:21.600
in one experience. You've got to kind of figure things out. So I knew Linux was a solution

04:21.600 --> 04:24.820
back when I was in the army trying to repurpose servers and it's like, all right, let's throw

04:24.820 --> 04:30.320
it on this. You know, it was a Lenovo R series thing. So I threw it on there and did a bunch

04:30.320 --> 04:37.220
of my college work there and then we ran Linux for years, cut the cord, you know, in 2008

04:37.220 --> 04:41.840
and just once I started listening to all the JB shows, it wasn't just listening to Chris

04:41.840 --> 04:45.120
and the team as far as the shows they were producing. It was kind of that extra content

04:45.120 --> 04:51.080
that they do on the side that this show or this channel, extras.show is really embodying

04:51.080 --> 04:55.260
because Jupiter at night was a lot of fun and then kind of, you know, some of the outtakes

04:55.260 --> 05:01.800
and things like that. And then, you know, I grew up kind of isolated in Connecticut

05:01.800 --> 05:04.920
when I was in high school. And so there were like three nerds in the whole high school

05:04.920 --> 05:10.720
that you could talk computers with, right? Yeah. And so being able to be in a space where

05:10.720 --> 05:16.440
I could listen to and start hearing that conversation to learn more about it. And then thanks to

05:16.440 --> 05:23.880
Chris, I've rewatched the entire back catalog of the computer Chronicles. Really? That's

05:23.880 --> 05:27.240
great. I don't know if they still show that on the live stream, but they used to when

05:27.240 --> 05:31.640
they didn't have a whole lot of self-generated content. So I've watched a lot of that stuff.

05:31.640 --> 05:36.280
That's awesome. So I'm going to, I'm going to rewind you there for a second. So you were

05:36.280 --> 05:41.480
telling the story of trying Ubuntu on those servers, but you mentioned something that

05:41.480 --> 05:46.360
I want to ask you a little bit more about your, you mentioned that you wanted to teach

05:46.360 --> 05:50.160
some of the soldiers, some basics and computer. Can you talk a little bit more about that?

05:50.160 --> 05:54.120
Yeah. So when the army trains you, they train you or they trained us on what we call POTS

05:54.120 --> 05:59.360
telephone systems now. So plain, plain old telephone, telephone systems. And they were

05:59.360 --> 06:03.960
modernizing when we were in Iraq in 2005, 2006, they were going to a fiber backbone

06:03.960 --> 06:08.200
in the country. They were going all data, everything was going to be over TCP IP and

06:08.200 --> 06:13.920
they didn't teach us any of that. And so and they weren't going to either. And we were

06:13.920 --> 06:17.200
going to be there for a year and have to implement this stuff without knowing what the heck it

06:17.200 --> 06:23.880
was or how the technology worked. And so they put me on the night shift and, and left me

06:23.880 --> 06:29.480
alone, which was good. And so what I would do is I would spend, you know, my 12 hour

06:29.480 --> 06:34.200
shift at night researching as much as I could and building a training module. And then the

06:34.200 --> 06:38.840
next morning, stay awake for another two or three hours and train my guys on, Hey, here's

06:38.840 --> 06:43.720
how TCP IP works. Here's how you can test it. Here's some Cisco routers that we had,

06:43.720 --> 06:48.160
you know, in switches that we had them program and learning VLANs and other things like that.

06:48.160 --> 06:56.760
So it was really helpful. And when I was finished and I left Iraq early to go to college, finish

06:56.760 --> 07:01.400
out my degree, which was really nice. But when I was finished doing that, one of the

07:01.400 --> 07:05.120
things that they did is they awarded me with a bronze star medal because all those folks

07:05.120 --> 07:09.440
that I trained by the time they got out and to different locations where they had to function

07:09.440 --> 07:14.000
as smaller teams, they were a lot more effective. And so I was really proud of having earned

07:14.000 --> 07:15.000
that award.

07:15.000 --> 07:22.680
Yeah. And it's kind of, um, like self-motivated for sharing knowledge, right? Uh, it sounds

07:22.680 --> 07:27.240
like you just sort of were inspired to, to share this knowledge and, and the effort that

07:27.240 --> 07:28.800
you put into it is really impressive.

07:28.800 --> 07:32.800
I I'm always been the sort of leader where I want to help other people be successful.

07:32.800 --> 07:36.640
And so I w I could see where things were going and I wanted to help the team be successful

07:36.640 --> 07:42.320
and I'd read enough or learned enough, um, that I could, I could start closing my knowledge

07:42.320 --> 07:47.720
gap and then build it into some sort of training. Um, it wasn't perfect and I didn't know what

07:47.720 --> 07:51.680
all, you know, what, what should be in the, the whole box, right? But I knew parts of

07:51.680 --> 07:53.280
the box and I could at least train that.

07:53.280 --> 07:56.680
Well, it sounds like in this case, even, even any parts is helpful, right? And they can

07:56.680 --> 07:59.440
start to build those, those pieces together as they need.

07:59.440 --> 08:03.520
Yeah. Um, and it was, it was cool. I mean, the equipment we had, I learned all kinds

08:03.520 --> 08:07.600
of stuff about radio frequencies and, um, that national guard unit I mentioned, they

08:07.600 --> 08:11.840
actually had a piece of equipment I have to nerd out with you about. It's called a tropospheric

08:11.840 --> 08:18.920
antenna. So it shoots a, it's, it's pretty close to microwave frequency up at the troposphere.

08:18.920 --> 08:22.400
The signal bounces off of different parts of the troposphere and then back down. So

08:22.400 --> 08:26.160
you can actually do line of, it's kind of like line of sight, but it's, it does 300

08:26.160 --> 08:27.160
miles.

08:27.160 --> 08:28.160
But reflective.

08:28.160 --> 08:29.160
Yeah.

08:29.160 --> 08:30.160
Yeah. Wow. That's awesome.

08:30.160 --> 08:34.560
Being a long time JB listener, when I, when I heard Noah and you hear him talk about nerding

08:34.560 --> 08:38.000
out about ham radio and amateur radio, it's like, Oh, I get it. I know that stuff. You

08:38.000 --> 08:39.600
know, it's like, it's a lot of fun.

08:39.600 --> 08:45.200
Well, and a lot of those like technologies, um, the same style of interest or the same,

08:45.200 --> 08:50.240
um, type of mindset that is required to have interest in it, like overlaps in those different

08:50.240 --> 08:55.480
areas, right? So a lot of us have interest in that kind of stuff. That's great. You mentioned

08:55.480 --> 08:59.680
that you got to leave Iraq a little bit early to go to college.

08:59.680 --> 09:03.260
Fun story there. I'm the only person that ever graduated from Utah state university

09:03.260 --> 09:05.720
without applying for their major.

09:05.720 --> 09:06.720
That's awesome.

09:06.720 --> 09:11.400
I was literally applying from Iraq and um, you know, my tour was supposed to leave, it

09:11.400 --> 09:15.000
was supposed to be a 12 month tour and they had a program for a green to gold activity.

09:15.000 --> 09:18.200
So they were going to make me an officer, but, and they were going to pay me while I

09:18.200 --> 09:23.440
went to school. So I applied for this program, um, and very grateful that it existed. Uh,

09:23.440 --> 09:27.360
and in doing so, and with the time zone difference, cause I was in Iraq while I was applying,

09:27.360 --> 09:30.280
I didn't actually get to fill out all the paperwork the school required for picking

09:30.280 --> 09:35.240
your major. And I wanted it to be something with, with computers and communicating. And

09:35.240 --> 09:43.280
so they put me in the college of humanities with a degree in communication studies.

09:43.280 --> 09:44.840
Not quite what you were looking for, right?

09:44.840 --> 09:49.240
No, but I was so grateful to go and I learned so much. And, and when I became an officer,

09:49.240 --> 09:53.120
the skills that I'd learned from that were great. And so, you know how you can always

09:53.120 --> 09:56.680
ask a programmer, you know, uh, what do they use at work, right? What's their language

09:56.680 --> 10:01.040
at work and what's their language at home, right? So, so work at soft skills, right?

10:01.040 --> 10:04.600
And then at home, it's jumping behind a computer, building something with a network, making

10:04.600 --> 10:09.160
cat five cable, which is one of the most relaxing things I do. It's like, it's, I'm just going

10:09.160 --> 10:11.780
to build cat five cable for, for half a day, you know, type of thing.

10:11.780 --> 10:17.480
It's what I need right now. Orange, white, orange, green, white, blue, blue, right, green,

10:17.480 --> 10:22.640
brown, right, brown clips away. Yeah. Like I just, yeah, it's been there.

10:22.640 --> 10:25.800
It's kind of meditative, right? Cause you got to focus just enough that you can't think

10:25.800 --> 10:29.320
of anything else. And I don't try to be fast. I am not the fast

10:29.320 --> 10:32.080
guy in the room. I'm just the guy that can get it done.

10:32.080 --> 10:35.160
Slow is smooth, right? In the army, we say slow is smooth and smooth

10:35.160 --> 10:39.540
is fast. So that was one of our things. Yeah. I was thinking about you and that the

10:39.540 --> 10:43.200
other day when I was trying to rush to get somewhere and I was like packing my laptop

10:43.200 --> 10:47.360
in my bag and things were flying all over the place. And I was like, okay, I know I'm

10:47.360 --> 10:51.360
trying to go fast, but this has just taken way longer than how I usually systematically

10:51.360 --> 10:54.720
like take my time to do it. Then I thought, I thought of you and I thought of that and

10:54.720 --> 10:58.320
I was like, okay, I'm just going to slow down. And then everything just went really great.

10:58.320 --> 11:02.480
So listening to JB from 2008, again, Jupiter at Night, some of those other shows that aren't

11:02.480 --> 11:06.440
there anymore. SciByte was great. See, these were before my time or at least

11:06.440 --> 11:11.000
before I got connected to them. So, uh, so I love hearing these little snippets about

11:11.000 --> 11:14.340
them from, from long time listeners. So, and I've always wanted to contribute.

11:14.340 --> 11:18.360
So for one episode of SciByte, um, I worked with my daughter's like third grade class

11:18.360 --> 11:21.840
or something like that, or second grade class to submit a question to the show. And we did

11:21.840 --> 11:26.800
that with video and it was fun. Chris is, Chris is so great. He takes out audience feedback

11:26.800 --> 11:30.400
and content and to really tries to work it in. And that was, that was good.

11:30.400 --> 11:33.920
That must be like a special connection to when you're a listener and you can, you can

11:33.920 --> 11:35.900
actually like provide some content.

11:35.900 --> 11:39.840
It feels really good cause you want to contribute back to this community. Cause as, as we'll

11:39.840 --> 11:44.860
talk about this community has meant an awful lot over the years, um, for what they've,

11:44.860 --> 11:48.540
what they've done for me. I don't, I don't think they've taken the time to realize it.

11:48.540 --> 11:52.560
The army sent us to Georgia and then Germany. Georgia and Germany are two very different

11:52.560 --> 11:53.560
places.

11:53.560 --> 11:58.320
Right. So the next time I contributed to the show was in Germany. Um, and over there it

11:58.320 --> 12:02.920
was hard to get Netflix, uh, working and the cell phone companies over there are a little

12:02.920 --> 12:08.400
different than they have in the U S and so I ended up building a Linux server in my car,

12:08.400 --> 12:17.400
which made it into an episode of last cause I sent in the video of how I did that. Um,

12:17.400 --> 12:21.960
and it was totally not efficient, but it was, it was functional. It's like, all right, kids,

12:21.960 --> 12:24.800
we're throwing you in the minivan and we're going to Prague, right? Like it was, you know,

12:24.800 --> 12:28.520
they could, they were able to watch their shows off of that, you know, movie server

12:28.520 --> 12:35.080
in the car thing. So when Chris is at his like peak stress level for content for a Linux

12:35.080 --> 12:38.120
action show and they had a week where they just couldn't produce anything, they grabbed

12:38.120 --> 12:43.680
that clip and they threw it as the episode of last and I was like, so, so essentially

12:43.680 --> 12:49.160
I was a, I got to be a guest on last, which was fun. Nice. That's amazing. Yes. So that

12:49.160 --> 12:53.600
was, that felt really good. I don't have that. And so, um, there's another gold star for

12:53.600 --> 12:56.840
you. I'm trying to make my way around the shows every three to five years. You know,

12:56.840 --> 13:04.980
that's basically what I'm doing here. Succeeding. Um, well, yeah. Uh, but this, this is a different

13:04.980 --> 13:09.440
story than those other contributions and I don't think, uh, there's parts of this that

13:09.440 --> 13:13.560
are going to be hard to talk about. So, so three deployments, three times being away

13:13.560 --> 13:19.040
from family. Um, there's some challenges that come with that. So when I left, uh, so Iraq

13:19.040 --> 13:22.800
the first time was interesting cause it was during the invasion and you end up with a

13:22.800 --> 13:27.540
few cool war stories out of that. So war stories that nobody minds sharing or ones where nobody

13:27.540 --> 13:32.640
gets hurt. And I've got a couple of those. Um, one of them was, uh, when we got there,

13:32.640 --> 13:38.080
we had to take all of the ammunition like artillery rounds. So these things are 155

13:38.080 --> 13:43.120
millimeters wide. Um, and they weigh about 90 pounds and it's explosives and, and whatnot.

13:43.120 --> 13:46.320
And we'd had it and the rockets and the other things that Stomm had been stockpiling up

13:46.320 --> 13:51.400
for years and they would put those in what we call an ammo holding area. And then we

13:51.400 --> 13:54.680
had to destroy them. Right. So it wasn't me destroying them. I was the communications

13:54.680 --> 13:58.160
team, you know, across the street from these guys, but that team would go over and they'd

13:58.160 --> 14:01.760
grab a small stockpile and then put some more explosives on it and blow it up and it would

14:01.760 --> 14:05.240
happen noon every day. Right. So you knew what time midday was because there'd be an

14:05.240 --> 14:10.960
explosion. It's, it's kind of like a neat clock. And if you've ever been around an explosion,

14:10.960 --> 14:14.140
the guys on the show or the guys who are listening will know what I'm talking about. You feel

14:14.140 --> 14:21.280
your chest compress from the shockwave before you hear it. Um, which is cool. Wow. I haven't

14:21.280 --> 14:27.000
experienced that. It really gets your, your blood going. It's kind of cool. Um, so, so

14:27.000 --> 14:32.020
they were blowing this stuff up across the street from us. Uh, and then, um, something

14:32.020 --> 14:37.400
happened that wasn't supposed to, instead of it just blowing up the small pile, it started

14:37.400 --> 14:43.160
blowing up the entire ammo holding area. Oh no. The first thought I get is, is those videos

14:43.160 --> 14:48.200
you see of like firework production facilities when they have fires and it's just kind of

14:48.200 --> 14:53.240
like all over the place. Yeah. Okay. So you, you, you've got an image for this, right?

14:53.240 --> 14:58.640
Right. This is, this is, this is good for us. We had, you know, kind of a sand barrier

14:58.640 --> 15:02.080
or a berm, you know, between us and them. So we couldn't really see, um, but we could

15:02.080 --> 15:05.960
start hearing like, Hey, that's a lot of explosions. They must really be aggressive. And then it

15:05.960 --> 15:10.080
gets just kept going. And we were like, Oh, this is not good. So they tell us to just

15:10.080 --> 15:14.940
leave our site, right? Leave the equipment on and just go. And I had two guys on guard

15:14.940 --> 15:19.840
duty inside of our little area. So we've got this small Humvee that's only designed a seat

15:19.840 --> 15:23.480
for, and we pulled up to the guard area and I jumped down into the bunker that these guys

15:23.480 --> 15:27.840
were in and I grabbed them and I said, get out of here, jump in the car right now. So

15:27.840 --> 15:31.440
I gave him one of my seats in the car and I'm in the back of this. Um, it would be like

15:31.440 --> 15:35.760
the equivalent of a pickup with one of the covers on the back, right? And I'm looking

15:35.760 --> 15:40.920
out the back as one of my dudes is just driving and he's flooring it. And I'm watching rockets

15:40.920 --> 15:45.280
come to our left and our right. And they ended up not landing anywhere near the truck, but

15:45.280 --> 15:48.800
there's, there's a real feeling where you can see a rocket that looks like it's headed

15:48.800 --> 15:53.120
right your direction for, for a few seconds before it spins off and going somewhere else,

15:53.120 --> 15:59.280
which is pretty cool. When we got to a safe location, um, I use some of my, uh, orienteering

15:59.280 --> 16:04.320
land navigation skills and calculated out the base of the smoke, um, column that was

16:04.320 --> 16:08.760
there. And it was over a kilometer wide. So that's how much stuff was exploding. And it

16:08.760 --> 16:15.520
lasted until about one, two in the morning. So it's like 12 hours. It was, it was great.

16:15.520 --> 16:19.840
Oh wow. Okay. That's a pretty good story. Nobody got hurt. So that's a fun story to

16:19.840 --> 16:26.040
tell. Um, but it's surreal. And then, so, uh, the second deployment to Iraq was, again,

16:26.040 --> 16:29.680
that was the 05, 06 one. And I got to leave a little early and go to college, but it was

16:29.680 --> 16:34.080
so abrupt. Like I left, I left, you know, being in an environment where people wanted

16:34.080 --> 16:40.520
to kill you, um, you know, and, and then being on a college campus. And so I always kept

16:40.520 --> 16:44.860
my weapon on my, I'd strap it over my shoulder, right? And when I got to college, I would

16:44.860 --> 16:48.840
always make sure that I had a backpack, you know, just kind of strapped over my, my shoulders

16:48.840 --> 16:54.840
to kind of give me that it's, it's like my sense of security, right? Yeah, yeah, it is

16:54.840 --> 16:59.600
that helped out. Um, and then Afghanistan was interesting, right? So Afghanistan was

16:59.600 --> 17:04.840
a, a really hard deployment. Um, I bought the internet when I was down there, it costs

17:04.840 --> 17:10.800
something like a hundred dollars a month and it was 15 kilobits a second. And, uh, I would,

17:10.800 --> 17:15.760
I would still download the JB shows that were video cause there was a lot of torrenting

17:15.760 --> 17:19.320
on those, uh, on those shows when they were released. And so I just set it up to download

17:19.320 --> 17:24.840
and I'd loved using transmission, had a little, you know, uh, system 76 mirror cat. That was

17:24.840 --> 17:29.360
my, you know, kind of download machine, um, and just prep those files. And I set up a

17:29.360 --> 17:34.340
movie server for, uh, the team down there because again, there's no Netflix at 15 kilobits

17:34.340 --> 17:38.840
a second, right? So you were the Netflix, right? So between JB shows and other shows

17:38.840 --> 17:45.760
I'd keep us. So we all had someplace to escape to. Um, but the job there was really stressful.

17:45.760 --> 17:51.280
We had to interface directly with the Afghan army a lot and try to help and train them.

17:51.280 --> 17:57.120
And it was also at a time where we were leaving the country. And so from a system standpoint,

17:57.120 --> 18:03.640
that's a really dangerous time period. And, and, uh, because if we're leaving the country,

18:03.640 --> 18:07.480
um, then things are going to revert back to normal. And if these guys are seen as helping

18:07.480 --> 18:10.680
the Americans, then it doesn't look good for them and their family, you know, puts their

18:10.680 --> 18:16.080
family in jeopardy. And so we had, um, I think we had four interpreters when we started two

18:16.080 --> 18:21.000
of them, uh, were caught trying to kill us, um, or sell information that would allow people

18:21.000 --> 18:24.880
to kill us. Um, and so we had to fire them and things like that, but it was a very high

18:24.880 --> 18:28.680
stress environment. It was very frustrating because it didn't feel like we were going

18:28.680 --> 18:33.400
to win. You know, there was no victory defined by Congress and other things. And so it was

18:33.400 --> 18:38.720
very hard. And, uh, immediately after that deployment, I had to, I came home and then

18:38.720 --> 18:43.320
had to turn around and go back to, uh, some, some technical training. And so with, with

18:43.320 --> 18:46.640
all of these deployment and except for the first one, I've never been able to kind of

18:46.640 --> 18:52.640
just park my butt and reset and be around people that knew me before and after, uh,

18:52.640 --> 18:58.880
these things happen. And, um, because of that change in transition, um, I've ended up with,

18:58.880 --> 19:04.360
with PTSD and, uh, and there's a couple of different ways to get this. One of them is,

19:04.360 --> 19:08.800
you know, the, the common classic you see it in the movies, people are faced with traumatic

19:08.800 --> 19:14.240
events. Um, the other way to get it is to be in a traumatic stress environments, high

19:14.240 --> 19:18.720
stress environments for a long duration of time with no opportunity to reset or escape.

19:18.720 --> 19:23.200
So the high stress becomes your normal, I guess, right? It does. It very much does.

19:23.200 --> 19:27.760
It's kind of like building a highway in your brain is the way I describe it. That hurts

19:27.760 --> 19:32.440
already. Just even imagining what that might feel like. Right? I bring this up because

19:32.440 --> 19:37.040
one of the stories I want to tell for, for the team that has been doing Jupiter broadcasting,

19:37.040 --> 19:42.440
you know, and the alumni from Jupiter broadcasting is, you know, I've, I've had to, I've had

19:42.440 --> 19:48.320
to reset a lot, um, and reframe a lot. And it's taken a lot of work. By the time I got

19:48.320 --> 19:52.160
to Boise, I was so broken. This is only a couple of years ago. I was so broken that

19:52.160 --> 19:56.920
I'd get in the lane that I could on ramp and off ramp, but I'd never change. And it didn't

19:56.920 --> 20:01.040
matter if I was stuck. I couldn't change. I didn't feel confident changing lanes, you

20:01.040 --> 20:05.260
know, driving on the freeway, I guess, cause there's a, an inherent risk that you might

20:05.260 --> 20:10.000
miss your stop or that you gotta, yeah, there's a risk and that would throw off an expectation

20:10.000 --> 20:16.240
and that would make life hard. Um, and, and so that's, that's how bad I, I was, but I

20:16.240 --> 20:21.480
was very grateful that when I was dealing with that stress, I could escape and, you

20:21.480 --> 20:27.040
know, enjoy the content from the JB shows. Like they were just, they were, it was nothing

20:27.040 --> 20:33.220
to do with what I was dealing with. It was something cool and exciting and building something

20:33.220 --> 20:36.960
that was going to be productive. And here I was trapped in an environment where even

20:36.960 --> 20:41.800
if I were to help that army unit be as productive as possible, the system that they were surrounded

20:41.800 --> 20:47.680
by was going to undo everything I was doing as soon as I left. And it, it just that hopelessly

20:47.680 --> 20:55.640
frustrating situation. Um, and so, so part of this is, man, just, just thank you guys.

20:55.640 --> 20:58.400
Like thank you for giving me that escape.

20:58.400 --> 21:03.080
That thank you is so huge, right? Like I feel like for those of them who've been behind

21:03.080 --> 21:08.720
the microphone and the camera, obviously for some of the video shows, um, you never really

21:08.720 --> 21:14.000
know the audience you're reaching. Uh, you produce the material in studio, you know,

21:14.000 --> 21:19.040
you imagine surely some people will listen to it and definitely a lot of people do. Um,

21:19.040 --> 21:25.400
but you never really know on an individual level who you're reaching and what that impact

21:25.400 --> 21:30.440
is delivering, right? And so to hear these stories come back, even like years later,

21:30.440 --> 21:36.000
I would imagine for the team who was involved in that stuff, it's like a huge, massive boost

21:36.000 --> 21:42.760
in the, the personal energy that you put into creating this content a because you're super

21:42.760 --> 21:47.360
dedicated to it, but also because that dedication from the listeners is the connection that

21:47.360 --> 21:52.920
we make between each other. Right. And that's really powerful stuff. I feel like that is

21:52.920 --> 21:58.920
the reason that we are a huge community is like we all have some stuff in common and

21:58.920 --> 22:01.160
help each other in ways that we don't even realize.

22:01.160 --> 22:08.280
So I run a very unpopular blog right now. Right. Okay. And I've run a very unpopular

22:08.280 --> 22:15.360
blog for like two years ish now. Right. There's 7 billion people on the planet. 15 of them

22:15.360 --> 22:24.000
accidentally click one of my links a day. Right. Oh, that kind of unpopular. And so

22:24.000 --> 22:29.000
I've had to reset how I look at that. And this, this applies to this as well as somebody

22:29.000 --> 22:33.680
in India clicked on my blog, right? Like how cool is that? When I was growing up connecting

22:33.680 --> 22:39.440
with somebody in India or China or any of these places would have been unheard of. Right.

22:39.440 --> 22:43.620
But some computer in India or China. Okay. Yeah. You guys were technical and you're probably

22:43.620 --> 22:46.780
going to tell me it's just some scam bot. I got that. Right. But, but it clicked on

22:46.780 --> 22:53.240
my blog. Like that's, that's still cool that we're that connected. And, and to think of

22:53.240 --> 22:58.440
what that means, I'm sure the guys who worked on warty warthog or whatever it was in 2005

22:58.440 --> 23:03.260
never realized that we would, we would wait three days for that sucker to download so

23:03.260 --> 23:07.380
we could throw it on a server just to see, you know, what's, what would stick. Right.

23:07.380 --> 23:12.080
That obviously means that it's really valuable if you're willing to wait that long. Right.

23:12.080 --> 23:16.280
So, so it feels like the code that people are writing in the same way that the JP shows

23:16.280 --> 23:21.840
is like it's, it's affecting people in major ways. Exactly. Right. You can't discount the

23:21.840 --> 23:26.300
one, you know, we look at the numbers in aggregate, right? And the numbers in aggregate don't

23:26.300 --> 23:32.200
help us connect with the, the individuals or the individual use cases that are oftentimes

23:32.200 --> 23:38.220
really powerful and, and what they do. I ended up inheriting an old system in Iraq or no

23:38.220 --> 23:42.580
in Afghanistan and ended up giving it to one of the Afghan guys. Right. And guess which

23:42.580 --> 23:52.780
operating system I threw on there? Let me see. Not Vista. No, not windows. No. And it

23:52.780 --> 23:56.400
was, it was this old Lenovo somebody had given me with a cracked screen, but for those people

23:56.400 --> 24:01.180
in that environment, it was a valuable tool that they could learn from. And so I threw

24:01.180 --> 24:07.060
on 10 oh four, which to me was just the pinnacle of classic Ubuntu. 10 oh four was just, oh,

24:07.060 --> 24:12.540
everything about it made sense and it was so good. And now my kids run a Ubuntu mate.

24:12.540 --> 24:16.520
It gives them the versatility and it gives them that same sort of feel. But you know,

24:16.520 --> 24:20.940
you kind of want to tell Martin Winpress, Martin, my kids are learning computers using

24:20.940 --> 24:25.100
the code that you're, you know, working with your team to create. Like how cool is that?

24:25.100 --> 24:29.020
Like that's their experience. Right. And, and why Ubuntu mate? Well, because I know

24:29.020 --> 24:33.580
if I throw them in there, they can customize it 10 ways from Sunday without really breaking

24:33.580 --> 24:38.820
it. And then when they get behind whatever system they end up using in the future, they're

24:38.820 --> 24:43.580
kind of agnostic to the workflow, right? They can figure out any workflow on any system

24:43.580 --> 24:49.500
that's out there. Um, because of that experience of, of working with, you know, Linux and Ubuntu

24:49.500 --> 24:52.420
and those sorts of things and the way that the user interface is designed.

24:52.420 --> 24:58.780
Yeah. That versatility is like priceless and reminds me of the gift that you gave to, to

24:58.780 --> 25:03.780
some of your, um, partners. Uh, was it in Iraq when you were teaching them some of the

25:03.780 --> 25:07.420
communications stuff with computers too? It's like you're doing the same thing with your

25:07.420 --> 25:12.380
kids. That's powerful stuff. You're giving them tools for the future. And, and you know,

25:12.380 --> 25:15.420
those are future Linux users, I would imagine.

25:15.420 --> 25:19.060
So one thing working on my undergrad and that communications that wasn't really technical,

25:19.060 --> 25:22.940
right, is, uh, I did have one teacher who was technically minded and she was actually

25:22.940 --> 25:29.420
doing a study on how, um, the computer actually trains you, right? It is, is an interactive

25:29.420 --> 25:34.820
part. People, um, interact with their operating systems the same way they do with people and

25:34.820 --> 25:39.620
the brain, it has trouble noticing the difference. That's why we have to manage screen time these

25:39.620 --> 25:43.560
days, right? Cause their brain has trouble noticing the difference between, am I interacting

25:43.560 --> 25:49.500
with a person or am I interacting with, you know, a software or, you know, type of experience.

25:49.500 --> 25:54.300
And, and so again, we measure screen time and I go back to Microsoft Bob because Microsoft

25:54.300 --> 26:02.680
has, has misread the study that they commissioned on, on users. Um, because, because a user

26:02.680 --> 26:07.820
treats the operating system like a person or like their regular environment, Microsoft

26:07.820 --> 26:09.060
misread that.

26:09.060 --> 26:13.020
And so they created their environment to look like what a person had in real life, hence

26:13.020 --> 26:17.180
the bookshelves and the other things like that. And so it, it's one of those things

26:17.180 --> 26:22.260
that, you know, when I, when I look lovingly back at Microsoft Bob and I smile because

26:22.260 --> 26:28.500
what that shows is, is it's, it's so classic and showing us how powerful the tools we are,

26:28.500 --> 26:34.500
um, as far as our interaction with them and, and what that means. Okay. I've been listening

26:34.500 --> 26:39.220
to the JB shows, but I've been consuming and using operating systems and different parts

26:39.220 --> 26:44.220
of Linux and different tools and, you know, Chris's, uh, you know, recommendations on,

26:44.220 --> 26:49.020
on software for years. And, and, and I've chosen to, even after I knew this was going

26:49.020 --> 26:54.340
to happen, I've chosen to let that be a part of, you know, how I'm wiring my brain to think

26:54.340 --> 26:59.540
through problems and work through things. And this team does it, you know, on a bootstrap,

26:59.540 --> 27:03.460
you know, budget and all those other stuff. It's like, it's what we have is amazing.

27:03.460 --> 27:09.300
Well, and I feel like Linux in a way, uh, this is true for me is it allows you to take

27:09.300 --> 27:16.340
older hardware or piecemeal hardware and make it useful up to today's standards, which is

27:16.340 --> 27:21.380
an amazing gift. You know, a lot of that hardware with the software that came with it, generally

27:21.380 --> 27:28.140
windows, um, is mostly useless. Uh, and so like for instance, you and I are talking on

27:28.140 --> 27:33.020
my X two 20, which came out like eons ago, if you compare it to modern hardware, but

27:33.020 --> 27:37.660
it still produces a whole bunch of magic and it's, I've got extremely modern software on

27:37.660 --> 27:41.980
this and it's running amazingly, right? So it would otherwise end up in the landfill

27:41.980 --> 27:49.420
and my plex server at home is running on an old Mac pro from 2008. Yeah, exactly. Right.

27:49.420 --> 27:54.580
That's awesome. Because it has the four bays of, you know, for hard drive space that I

27:54.580 --> 27:58.640
wanted. And it was, you know, it, it just works and it works like a champ, the transcoding

27:58.640 --> 28:03.300
on that thing. And I've got friends and family for days on that, you know, banging at it.

28:03.300 --> 28:08.460
And it's, it's holding up because it's running Linux and it's, it's able to add value to

28:08.460 --> 28:14.880
all of their lives. Um, so that's, that's really cool. I'm also the sort of person that

28:14.880 --> 28:20.620
doesn't, uh, I don't tend to sit still very well in, in what sense, like, like that you

28:20.620 --> 28:24.580
always need to be solving a problem or that you always need to be doing something or I

28:24.580 --> 28:29.020
have trouble sitting still physically and sitting still mentally. Um, so I've ended

28:29.020 --> 28:34.100
up writing like three books at this point, um, which is fun just cause I had something

28:34.100 --> 28:38.420
I wanted to share. Um, and I've done a lot of projects on the side and when I do something,

28:38.420 --> 28:42.780
I do a lot of it. So it's like all or nothing. Right. So in college compared to what I was

28:42.780 --> 28:47.860
dealing with my long days in Iraq, right. I, uh, I turned around, so this is for my

28:47.860 --> 28:53.980
bachelors. So I decided to figure out how many credits I could do in one semester without

28:53.980 --> 29:01.060
having to get the Dean's approval. Um, turns out at Utah state university, you can do 24

29:01.060 --> 29:06.540
semester hours without having to get the Dean's approval. And I did all 24 and ran a 5k that

29:06.540 --> 29:11.900
raised money for charity and had our third kid. So that was, that was pretty good. And

29:11.900 --> 29:16.820
then the next semester it was, it was, Hey, this academia thing likes publishing. Um,

29:16.820 --> 29:20.540
I'm going to write a paper that gets published. And I did that as an undergrad, which was

29:20.540 --> 29:26.420
a lot of fun. Um, so, so that was cool. And then, uh, you know, coming back from Afghanistan,

29:26.420 --> 29:30.220
I started working on my master's preparation for leaving military and that sort of stuff.

29:30.220 --> 29:35.620
And, uh, sort of really, really, um, had a job in Germany that required a lot of my attention.

29:35.620 --> 29:42.980
I was in command of 138 soldiers. We had, uh, we had a 34% turnover every year because

29:42.980 --> 29:48.580
of rotations that they're just naturally scheduled and the Russians invaded the Ukraine. So I

29:48.580 --> 29:53.060
was constantly sending communications teams out to Latvia, Lithuania, Spain, you know,

29:53.060 --> 29:58.060
and all England, um, or some of the other places they went. They went to Israel, uh,

29:58.060 --> 30:02.980
one time, uh, lots of things in Germany, lots of things in Poland. Um, and so I was sending

30:02.980 --> 30:08.980
teams out all over the place and working on my master's on the side and my master's program

30:08.980 --> 30:13.980
did not include, so it was distance education and did not include lectures. And it was,

30:13.980 --> 30:17.940
I wanted to be an it project manager. So they had the program for that. Cool. Great. There's

30:17.940 --> 30:21.180
some few it classes. There's a bunch of project management classes, put them all together

30:21.180 --> 30:26.660
and Bob's your uncle. And without any lectures, understanding the context of the content,

30:26.660 --> 30:30.100
cause I'm, I'm a self learner, but a lot of times when you Google something, you only

30:30.100 --> 30:35.500
get the answer you need, right? For that specific problem, not the greater picture. Right. So

30:35.500 --> 30:39.380
if we take something basic, like, you know, how does, how does TCP IP work, right? You

30:39.380 --> 30:44.300
might find, uh, the instructions to configure it on windows, but that doesn't really explain,

30:44.300 --> 30:48.420
you know, all of the parts of how it works and was designed and, and those sorts of,

30:48.420 --> 30:55.700
you know, things. And so you miss that context. And it was about this time that, um, I, I

30:55.700 --> 31:01.100
was struggling in my classes that I just started paying a little more attention to the tech

31:01.100 --> 31:06.340
snap show. Um, back when Chris and Alan were doing that and Chris always, I think you have

31:06.340 --> 31:11.060
the introduction memorize, you know, he would get on like his baseball announcer voice,

31:11.060 --> 31:14.740
right? And he'd be like, and, and joining me or is Alan Jude, you know, the tech, the

31:14.740 --> 31:18.880
admin and the teacher, you know, and Alan would break down, has just a snack to break

31:18.880 --> 31:24.460
down complex concepts into ways that the audience can understand, right? You're not insulting

31:24.460 --> 31:28.460
the technical folks in the audience and you're really allowing the folks who aren't quite

31:28.460 --> 31:34.440
there yet to bring them in. And so Alan and Chris were essentially my teaching duo for,

31:34.440 --> 31:38.820
they were the lectures I needed to get through my coursework for those it classes.

31:38.820 --> 31:43.580
Wow. Oh, that's huge. And it sounds like a perfect timing too, right?

31:43.580 --> 31:47.180
It was, Oh, and my goodness, the show notes, they do such a good, they did such a good

31:47.180 --> 31:50.580
job on those show notes that what I would do is I would go through and be like, okay,

31:50.580 --> 31:53.940
I can write that into a paper. I'm gonna, I'm gonna, you know, like I'm gonna write

31:53.940 --> 31:57.980
that new paper, write that new paper. So I'd be on my little commute right now. Okay. All

31:57.980 --> 32:00.940
right. So I'm listening to tech snap. This is what's going on. And then other stuff from

32:00.940 --> 32:04.860
last would tie off with it. And you know, I'd, I'd pull all these things together. And

32:04.860 --> 32:08.740
so by the time I'd sit down on the weekend, cause that was the only time I had time, I

32:08.740 --> 32:14.200
was working 14 hour days on the job and come home on the weekend. And I don't think my

32:14.200 --> 32:18.620
family really saw me much in Germany. And I'd sit there and lock myself in a room for

32:18.620 --> 32:22.500
all of Saturday and most of Sunday and just start cranking out papers. But thanks to the

32:22.500 --> 32:26.620
show notes, right? The research was basically done. I didn't have to go Google where to

32:26.620 --> 32:31.300
find the sources. I had the list of the sources. I could go back and read the articles. I could

32:31.300 --> 32:35.620
pull out the relevant material. I could put that together and submit it for my professors

32:35.620 --> 32:41.500
and academia, at least for this university was not as cutting edge on tech, you know,

32:41.500 --> 32:45.620
as, as I would have liked them to be. And I was, the teachers were writing me back and

32:45.620 --> 32:50.780
really impressed with my sources and you know, kind of, kind of appreciative that I was helping

32:50.780 --> 32:55.660
keep them current as opposed to just referencing something published in an academic journal,

32:55.660 --> 32:59.420
you know, and I'd mix it up, right? I'd use academic journals as well, but you know, that

32:59.420 --> 33:04.740
it totally reduced my research load to have all of that JB content and be able to, to

33:04.740 --> 33:09.060
get my masters that way, which was just, just awesome to hear that one of the shows helped

33:09.060 --> 33:16.860
you get through your masters. It's unbelievable. And like so valuable, like unbelievably valuable.

33:16.860 --> 33:21.860
That's amazing. Well, let's put this into perspective. 15 people visited my blog in

33:21.860 --> 33:26.660
the last 24 hours. One of them was from India, right? So Chris has been producing content

33:26.660 --> 33:30.620
for over 10 years now, it feels like. So some, at some point it's going to stick with one

33:30.620 --> 33:34.900
or more audience members and Hey, I'll be the one for today. And maybe there's another

33:34.900 --> 33:41.380
one out there and two or three people and you can sleep well at night, right? There's

33:41.380 --> 33:44.740
7 billion people in the world. It's about time you made a difference for one of them.

33:44.740 --> 33:48.100
No, I'm totally kidding. It's it's, I really am appreciative of it. And I know there's

33:48.100 --> 33:51.500
a bigger network than that. I just, I'd never get to see him cause I've never made it to

33:51.500 --> 33:56.420
Linux Fest North to see that crew or any of the other conferences.

33:56.420 --> 34:03.900
Did you ever get a chance to meet any of them? I did get a chance to meet Chris. So I'm working

34:03.900 --> 34:09.620
on my masters. I'm working on my PTSD issues. I'm leaving the army and I have no job, right?

34:09.620 --> 34:14.180
There's nobody that's jumping out. I've only lived in Boise at that point for like a year.

34:14.180 --> 34:18.180
So I don't have a professional network of people that want to hire Jacob. I'm trying

34:18.180 --> 34:22.900
to build that network and I'm working on my masters. And so I applied for a job just,

34:22.900 --> 34:26.820
so I could get an interview, right? I was just throwing my resume out there just so

34:26.820 --> 34:30.420
I could get an interview. And this guy ended up picking me up and wanting me to be an intern

34:30.420 --> 34:36.020
at his entrepreneurial software development shop. You know, so, so I say, Hey, cool. Let

34:36.020 --> 34:39.060
me do my army job in the morning. I'm done with that. I'll come over and work with you

34:39.060 --> 34:42.680
guys. And Oh, by the way, I'm working on my masters. So, you know, I was taking two master's

34:42.680 --> 34:50.240
classes at the same time and now working two jobs. It's great. It was just, it was awesome.

34:50.240 --> 34:53.540
What I did is I was, I was working on that and he wanted to bring me on full time when

34:53.540 --> 34:58.580
I left the service. And so dealing with the anxiety PTSD issues I had, Oh boy, that felt

34:58.580 --> 35:03.060
really good to know that at least I had something to land on after I left the service instead

35:03.060 --> 35:08.700
of just avoid, I suppose. Right. And so the show that helped me the most through that

35:08.700 --> 35:14.620
process happened to not be on Netflix and it wasn't on ABC or NBC. It was also on Jupiter

35:14.620 --> 35:19.300
broadcasting, right? And it was Coder radio because literally this entrepreneurial shop

35:19.300 --> 35:24.380
was doing the exact same things that the Coder radio team was doing, you know, in their entrepreneurial

35:24.380 --> 35:30.660
shop just on the other side of the country. So I'm sitting there and, and you can understand

35:30.660 --> 35:35.620
cause I was a hardware implementation guy and then I was a leadership guy, right? So

35:35.620 --> 35:38.820
you're going to develop software and I have no idea how to write a line of code, but I

35:38.820 --> 35:43.860
had to at least not fake it, but understand the language and Coder radio really helped

35:43.860 --> 35:48.660
close the gap on that. So I'm in this position where I'm leaving the service. So I've got

35:48.660 --> 35:52.580
to turn in all my army gear at the end of this, right? And so they told me to turn in

35:52.580 --> 35:56.860
my army gear in Fort Lewis, Washington, which is in Tacoma area, right? So it's a little

35:56.860 --> 36:01.780
south of where Chris is at. And so I travel out there and on my way out there, I think

36:01.780 --> 36:05.140
I messaged Chris like a month out like, Hey, I'm going to be in the area. I'd really love

36:05.140 --> 36:10.840
to take you out to dinner or breakfast, something like that. And, and so we landed on breakfast

36:10.840 --> 36:15.860
and, and Hideo helped coordinate that cause Chris was dealing with a lot and oh boy, she's

36:15.860 --> 36:20.220
just so nice. And Angela, Angela in the background of all the shows. Oh, Angela is one of my

36:20.220 --> 36:24.140
favorite people in the world. And I wish she had her own show again, cause there's something

36:24.140 --> 36:29.980
about the way she sees tech that it's just, Oh, you made it approachable for me. So, so

36:29.980 --> 36:36.300
Hideo was so nice and helping to set that up and, and Chris and had the kids that weekend.

36:36.300 --> 36:40.460
And so I bought them all. I think we met at I hopper at Denny's. And so I bought breakfast

36:40.460 --> 36:44.640
for him, brought coloring books for the kids. And, and I think Chris was uncaffeinated or

36:44.640 --> 36:49.740
didn't have a good night's sleep. And I was extraordinarily nervous because here I'm meeting

36:49.740 --> 36:55.180
a hero of mine, you know, and I remember one of the kids was like, dad, you're famous.

36:55.180 --> 37:02.700
And Chris looks at him and he says, I'm internet famous, son. It's a little different. And

37:02.700 --> 37:07.100
so it was not this like, Oh, we got to come to this moment where I got to give him a hug

37:07.100 --> 37:10.700
and just tell him thank you and what it meant. I did get to tell him the story of, Hey, I've

37:10.700 --> 37:15.620
got this job offer. I can land, but you know, with the kids there and everything else with

37:15.620 --> 37:19.420
that, we kept the conversation pretty light. And I never got to tell that whole backstory

37:19.420 --> 37:24.260
of, man, I've been, I've been, I've had issues building up with me for years. And those highways

37:24.260 --> 37:28.580
in my head that I've got to try to, you know, disconnect and, and, and short, short circuit,

37:28.580 --> 37:34.140
right. So I can be, be functional and how just having that offer available, you know,

37:34.140 --> 37:40.460
meant so much to me and how his team has helped to produce that over the years. I mean, you're

37:40.460 --> 37:46.660
making differences in people's lives and it's just awesome. Um, and I think he got it, right?

37:46.660 --> 37:52.140
I'll have to find out later on, you know, right. We'll see what he says after this guys,

37:52.140 --> 37:57.540
guys communicate differently, right? Um, sometimes you don't have to say things. And, and for

37:57.540 --> 38:00.700
those of you guys that may know somebody, for those in the audience that may know somebody

38:00.700 --> 38:04.820
who is dealing with PTSD or other issues, one of the best things you can do is just

38:04.820 --> 38:11.500
sit next to them. It sounds really weird, but just sitting next to somebody when they're,

38:11.500 --> 38:16.740
when they're having a moment where they're disconnected or they zone out, don't say anything

38:16.740 --> 38:22.420
till you're asked, but just sitting there makes all the difference. It is so, so comfortable

38:22.420 --> 38:23.420
to have that.

38:23.420 --> 38:24.980
The power of presence, right?

38:24.980 --> 38:32.460
Yeah. Uh, now as cool as that story is, I didn't end up taking that job.

38:32.460 --> 38:40.140
This is a twist. I did not expect the shop was about to go through a really hard period

38:40.140 --> 38:44.500
in order to make the transition in the shop that I would need to, to be functional. Um,

38:44.500 --> 38:48.340
I didn't have the experience to be able to stand up to, I mean, it's a small 10 person,

38:48.340 --> 38:53.540
15 person shop, right? Um, and I didn't have the experience to be able to, to confidently

38:53.540 --> 38:59.020
say no to the boss when I needed to. And I knew that and I didn't want to be in that

38:59.020 --> 39:02.860
position where he did hire me for three months and then have to let me go cause we had a

39:02.860 --> 39:08.180
professional disagreement and I couldn't back up what I was saying. Um, but where I've landed

39:08.180 --> 39:15.620
is absolutely great. Um, uh, so Idaho is known for I'm quizzing you. Idaho is known for what

39:15.620 --> 39:16.620
Brent, do you know?

39:16.620 --> 39:19.580
Well, the first thing that comes to my mind is potatoes.

39:19.580 --> 39:25.660
That is absolutely correct. So in Pocatello, I believe, um, yeah, that's one of the areas.

39:25.660 --> 39:30.100
There's quite a few actually. I get to work for the Jr Simplot company is one of their

39:30.100 --> 39:36.540
project managers. Um, and I'm on a great team. Um, and, uh, the Jr Simplot company is known

39:36.540 --> 39:42.020
for being the largest supplier of McDonald's French fries in the world. No way. And now

39:42.020 --> 39:47.620
we do way more than that, right? We have way more going on than just McDonald's, but, um,

39:47.620 --> 39:52.260
that's best what we're known for. Um, and so the team I get to work with is great. And

39:52.260 --> 39:57.940
what's neat here is I've got that mentor gap is closed, right? I had a, I had a mentor

39:57.940 --> 40:01.740
gap in a lot of my other experiences, whether it means learning it or me in that entrepreneurial

40:01.740 --> 40:05.860
shop, you know, and I know by the way, I have such great memories of all of that, right?

40:05.860 --> 40:11.500
That, that shop was so, so good at what they did. We helped reorganize their hiring process,

40:11.500 --> 40:15.980
right? And they ended up making the ink 500 because they were able to hire people so quickly

40:15.980 --> 40:22.140
and get the right talent in. It was like 69% improvement in a four week period or something

40:22.140 --> 40:26.500
like that. When I sat down and looked at how we were, how the processes, once you, once

40:26.500 --> 40:30.900
you do, once you do a process map on it, you know, you can, you can build things out from

40:30.900 --> 40:35.820
there. Um, and one of the things I do at work here and one of the ways I got the job here,

40:35.820 --> 40:40.140
so I came on as a contractor and then they picked me up full time at a moment where they

40:40.140 --> 40:44.100
were getting rid of all their contractors and they didn't have a whole lot of open positions.

40:44.100 --> 40:48.420
So I'm really lucky. But one of the reasons they picked me up here is because I'm the

40:48.420 --> 40:54.140
sort of guy that, uh, I'm, I'm, I just want to help get the workflow done. And I know

40:54.140 --> 40:59.780
a lot of tools to do it. And so I'm able to, to jump in and help people like get through

40:59.780 --> 41:03.540
things. And again, that goes back to the shows and the content from, and the experience with

41:03.540 --> 41:07.580
running Linux is you have to figure it out, right? You've learned, we've all learned,

41:07.580 --> 41:12.380
if you're listening to the show, you have a gift that you may not realize you have learned

41:12.380 --> 41:17.620
how to build your workflow and stuff where there may not be good documentation, right?

41:17.620 --> 41:21.660
Where the software may be buggy and where nobody's going to spell it out for you. And

41:21.660 --> 41:25.620
oh, by the way, if you find a YouTube video, it's probably going to be somebody's hobby

41:25.620 --> 41:30.380
project with 300 views. It's so true. You and I have both done photography, right? If

41:30.380 --> 41:35.860
I want to know how to create a mask in Photoshop, I have 600 videos to choose from, right? Yeah.

41:35.860 --> 41:40.100
In all versions of Photoshop, whatever. Yeah, exactly. You get a dark table. We just don't

41:40.100 --> 41:44.720
have the community there. So you had to learn it on your own. And that has made me a powerful

41:44.720 --> 41:51.660
force for good at work with helping people be productive and get their content out there.

41:51.660 --> 41:57.620
And then changing the culture is a part of it too. I'm at the point now where I'm influencing

41:57.620 --> 42:04.060
culture. Our project team is about 200 right now, and it's going to be about 500 in the

42:04.060 --> 42:09.180
next six months. And so the project culture is going to impact the broader culture of

42:09.180 --> 42:15.140
this company that is globally known for producing really good food products, including good

42:15.140 --> 42:21.780
french fries. That's amazing. So it must feel to you like you're making a massive difference

42:21.780 --> 42:26.580
still in the work that you're doing and that I would imagine feels really good, especially

42:26.580 --> 42:30.820
coming from some of the previous experiences you've had. Yeah. So you remember that frustration

42:30.820 --> 42:34.740
I had about Afghanistan where it didn't feel like my effort was going to make a difference

42:34.740 --> 42:40.300
at all. I can make a difference individually. And we did. One of our interpreters is now

42:40.300 --> 42:44.740
living in the United States. He was able to come and move his family. And so he's safe.

42:44.740 --> 42:50.600
His family's safe. And he's down in Texas and really doing well. And I've kept in touch

42:50.600 --> 42:56.220
with him a couple of times a year. But now on the other side of it is I'm a part of the

42:56.220 --> 43:00.940
company's mission statement is we help feed the world. And they've got a challenge statement

43:00.940 --> 43:07.140
downstairs that says, can you think big enough to feed a billion people? Yes. Okay. That's

43:07.140 --> 43:13.500
a challenge. Right. And, and so, and so that's, that's where we're going as a company and

43:13.500 --> 43:18.380
what I feel like I'm contributing to. And then Carl Sagan once said that the advances

43:18.380 --> 43:24.980
in science and agriculture have done more for creating world peace and lifting people

43:24.980 --> 43:31.100
up out of poverty than any war has ever done or ever will do. And I'm totally paraphrasing.

43:31.100 --> 43:37.620
Yeah. Fair enough. It's still had the impact. Wow. So now I'm on the other side of that

43:37.620 --> 43:41.540
coin, right? I'm on the other side of the coin where it's like, Hey, I don't always

43:41.540 --> 43:45.660
directly get to see who I impact, you know, at the, at the end of where people consume

43:45.660 --> 43:50.220
our products, but I do get to see the impact of the people who are helping to do that.

43:50.220 --> 43:57.540
And I, they like working with me and I like being around them and, and it's getting me

43:57.540 --> 44:02.700
to the point where I can be human functional has been a, been an interesting road and getting

44:02.700 --> 44:06.340
me to the point where I can be technical functional and all these things have kind of merged recently.

44:06.340 --> 44:11.900
And then one of those arms is the JB audience. So I get to share that with you guys today.

44:11.900 --> 44:17.720
Yeah, that's pretty amazing. The JB community, you know, I've been in it in a deep way only

44:17.720 --> 44:24.060
for a few years now and it feels like just a massive family, right? Where some people

44:24.060 --> 44:28.660
you're closer to and as time shifts, you get closer to other people for you. The shows

44:28.660 --> 44:33.220
were that family for a long time and they were the, like the person sitting beside you

44:33.220 --> 44:39.380
silently, you know, in your ear while you're doing those commutes in, in various situations

44:39.380 --> 44:40.380
and places, right?

44:40.380 --> 44:44.500
Chris has spent a lot of time on the quality over the years and, and part of it is to create

44:44.500 --> 44:50.780
that intimacy between the audience and, and the hosts. And so literally like, look, I,

44:50.780 --> 44:55.520
I can't tell any of these people apart, you know, you know, if I ever meet them, but it's

44:55.520 --> 45:02.060
the, it's the it feels like there's a connection there and they, they spent the time to make

45:02.060 --> 45:06.380
sure that things were good enough that that could exist. And then the difference that

45:06.380 --> 45:09.620
it makes because it exists.

45:09.620 --> 45:13.940
Somebody has got to say thank you around here because, you know, this is only the first

45:13.940 --> 45:19.460
10 years of JB, you know, what is, what is the next 10 years, you know, look like, right?

45:19.460 --> 45:20.460
Like

45:20.460 --> 45:21.940
That's the challenge statement right there.

45:21.940 --> 45:25.500
Can you think big enough to feed a billion people right on my end, right? And you guys

45:25.500 --> 45:30.140
have this challenge statement of, you know, reaching more people and making more of a

45:30.140 --> 45:31.140
difference.

45:31.140 --> 45:37.860
That's massive. I feel in many ways, completely honored to help craft that challenge from

45:37.860 --> 45:40.180
hearing your story. That's really unbelievable.

45:40.180 --> 45:46.340
But the way you do these interviews and, and the way L talks and, and the cast now, you

45:46.340 --> 45:52.420
guys and Wes and, and Chris has just always been solid on this is you guys are not in,

45:52.420 --> 45:56.900
you're making the content approachable for people who are not technical. And that makes

45:56.900 --> 46:02.180
such a big difference because not a whole lot of people have that gift. And the fact

46:02.180 --> 46:08.780
that there's this many people that have that gift working at JB is just really cool. I

46:08.780 --> 46:13.380
mean, Litix Academy, like snatching you guys up is just gotta be so happy and thrilled

46:13.380 --> 46:18.860
because that's part of what they do too is helping to make content, you know, approachable,

46:18.860 --> 46:20.540
you know, at different levels of knowledge.

46:20.540 --> 46:25.740
Yeah, there are certainly these great synergies happening there for sure. And I think as listeners

46:25.740 --> 46:32.180
here, you're seeing some of that benefit for sure. And for you, it feels like, you know,

46:32.180 --> 46:36.020
what, what is JB going to be for you in the next few years? You know, what are you hoping

46:36.020 --> 46:37.020
to get out of it?

46:37.020 --> 46:42.700
Oh, yeah. If I get to choose my own adventure because it's been part of your life for the,

46:42.700 --> 46:50.660
for the last little while there. So what do you need next? We'll give it an, I think extras

46:50.660 --> 46:56.020
dot show. Um, if, if I had my, if I had all the time in the world, right, I would, I would

46:56.020 --> 47:03.980
create a, um, content for extras, uh, for the, the extras feed on fonts. Oh man, that

47:03.980 --> 47:10.980
is a rabbit hole, isn't it? Right. Um, but we so often overlook the systems in our lives

47:10.980 --> 47:15.560
that make a difference, right? We don't notice. Um, there was a story of a guy who said thank

47:15.560 --> 47:19.860
you when he picked up his coffee one morning and then his kids like, well, or the, the,

47:19.860 --> 47:22.980
the barista was like, well, don't thank me. Thanks. So, and so who delivers the beans,

47:22.980 --> 47:26.260
right? And he ended up having like a year, he wrote a book on this, right? About spending

47:26.260 --> 47:30.360
like a year saying thank you to everybody that involved him getting his coffee and how

47:30.360 --> 47:35.580
connected we are. Right. And, and, and so fonts are part of that system where we just don't

47:35.580 --> 47:41.100
notice, right? Like it's, it's, I mean, you probably do cause you do photography and you're

47:41.100 --> 47:45.100
graphically minded, right? But, but most of the people, when I walk around and I'll, I'll

47:45.100 --> 47:48.700
gripe about, you know, Helvetica or Ariel or something like that, they'll be like, what

47:48.700 --> 47:54.900
does it matter, Jacob? You know? And it's like, no, it matters. You know, uh, my Halloween

47:54.900 --> 47:58.820
shirt was the word Helvetica written in Comic Sans, which is the only time Comic Sans should

47:58.820 --> 48:06.140
ever touch my body. Yep. You get it. I think cheese is going to love hearing this. And

48:06.140 --> 48:09.460
all my goodness, I haven't mentioned it. Those graphics that he's designed. Wow. Like way

48:09.460 --> 48:13.700
to get the theming down. So it totally works in my podcast app guys. Like it makes it so

48:13.700 --> 48:18.900
much more approachable. Oh, that usability stuff is like, just like what you mentioned.

48:18.900 --> 48:22.220
If you don't like, obviously you're noticing it now, but there are some professions that

48:22.220 --> 48:28.660
are, um, that have the challenge that if they're done well, nobody notices. Yes. Yes. And,

48:28.660 --> 48:33.620
but, uh, and it, it just takes asking questions. Like, how did this happen? You know, why do

48:33.620 --> 48:39.100
people care so passionately about X? Right. And then understanding the Y and, and you

48:39.100 --> 48:43.140
can disagree with their solution or their, their, the end result of their thought process.

48:43.140 --> 48:48.860
Right. But understanding the Y just makes it so it makes so much sense. Um, I was listening

48:48.860 --> 48:52.820
to the Ubuntu podcast and they were talking about a flat earthers. I didn't even know

48:52.820 --> 49:00.980
that was a topic, man. I didn't notice topic. So, so, and I'm like, I'm like, okay, well,

49:00.980 --> 49:04.780
how did they get to this point? Like how, how did they get to, and I started listening

49:04.780 --> 49:09.420
to, you know, some of the commentary, both sides and, and realizing that, Oh, Oh, okay.

49:09.420 --> 49:12.940
They just reject any evidence that they can't see or touch. And then that leads them to

49:12.940 --> 49:16.300
this conclusion. Oh, it totally makes sense. I can, I can get along with flat earthers

49:16.300 --> 49:18.780
now. You know, like, like I don't agree with them.

49:18.780 --> 49:23.740
Well, and you know what? I think that is the right approach to most problems is like, okay,

49:23.740 --> 49:29.620
if I don't understand it, I shouldn't, um, resist it or, or be aggressive towards it.

49:29.620 --> 49:33.220
I should ask questions to try to understand their perspective. I think you totally nailed

49:33.220 --> 49:36.680
it. Uh, and that's hugely valuable.

49:36.680 --> 49:41.860
So when you, you see the differences in how, like, I would really love to know why when

49:41.860 --> 49:47.740
Ubuntu went back to gnome, right. Versus KDE. Cause KDE was in my mind from a user experience

49:47.740 --> 49:51.040
was much more sure my mouse worked, right? Like, you know, you have those odd issues

49:51.040 --> 49:55.860
on Linux. I've never had a conversation with Mark Shutterworth, but as his benevolent dictator

49:55.860 --> 50:00.660
for life, you know, like, Hey man, can you walk me back a few steps and say how you got

50:00.660 --> 50:04.740
there? Cause I see the results. And now though, like, Oh my goodness, they've done such a

50:04.740 --> 50:10.380
good job in that space. You know, um, that it's really awesome. And one of the things

50:10.380 --> 50:14.980
I wanted to share in this is there's a difference in how we compute like this audience, there's

50:14.980 --> 50:19.500
a difference in how they compute. Most of the people I work with see their machines

50:19.500 --> 50:25.260
as allowing them to be productive. And the Linux community sees a computer as allowing

50:25.260 --> 50:27.260
them to be expressive.

50:27.260 --> 50:29.920
Well said. That's such a big difference, right?

50:29.920 --> 50:34.900
And so, so then we get to choose, right? Once you realize that you want to be expressive,

50:34.900 --> 50:39.660
then you get to choose, how do I want to be expressive? And that's where all the options

50:39.660 --> 50:45.100
come in. And so that, that, that some of that infighting that was a lot more prominent back

50:45.100 --> 50:48.340
in the day where this is better than that, right? It's like, no, no, no, no, no, it's

50:48.340 --> 50:54.140
not better. This is how I choose to be expressive, you know, and we need to recognize that. And

50:54.140 --> 50:59.420
right now my choice is I'm guys, I hate to admit it to you. I'm running a Mac book pro.

50:59.420 --> 51:03.380
Um, and I love it because I love final cut and a few of the other things. And that doesn't

51:03.380 --> 51:07.440
discredit any of the work in the Linux community. You're still powering at least five systems

51:07.440 --> 51:13.060
in my house or three systems in my house in various ways, you know, but it's how I choose

51:13.060 --> 51:19.660
to be expressive with the tool. Um, and, and where, where's that road going to lead me?

51:19.660 --> 51:25.180
You know, I don't know what that next phase of this looks like, but I feel like I can,

51:25.180 --> 51:30.620
I can be more expressive in every aspect or every challenge I come up with in life because

51:30.620 --> 51:33.740
of these experiences and learning how to use these tools and learning how to help people

51:33.740 --> 51:34.740
through things.

51:34.740 --> 51:41.940
Yeah, I feel like looking at our tools as means of expression is, is huge. Um, and you

51:41.940 --> 51:48.340
helped me clarify for myself what I felt, but not been able to explain. And because

51:48.340 --> 51:54.280
like many of us, I imagine the people surrounding me have far less interest in, in computers

51:54.280 --> 51:59.820
and Linux than I do. Like most of them, when I mentioned Linux, they're like, huh, what

51:59.820 --> 52:06.020
is that? Um, but the, the real gift is that this is a tool I've discovered for myself

52:06.020 --> 52:10.580
that allows me to be expressive, especially that I tend to do creative work on it. Right.

52:10.580 --> 52:15.660
Um, but even, even tinkering with software problems or hardware problems, like that's

52:15.660 --> 52:21.060
a means of expression and building my own systems. And I don't mean computer system,

52:21.060 --> 52:25.180
but I mean like systems that surround me and make me a more productive person or a better

52:25.180 --> 52:32.540
person is an amazing way to be expressive. And the JB community for me, and I would assume

52:32.540 --> 52:37.540
exactly for you as well, is a way of connecting with people who also get that. And so the

52:37.540 --> 52:41.460
way you worded it, it was like, Oh, I know I'm sitting beside someone who totally gets

52:41.460 --> 52:43.020
me for sure.

52:43.020 --> 52:47.980
Yeah. And, but we may disagree, right? Like, like I, you and I both like dark table, but

52:47.980 --> 52:53.540
after that I'm, I'm not jumping in to get man. Like I just, Nope, I'm good. I'll just,

52:53.540 --> 52:57.140
whatever dark table can do, cause I'm not a professional photographer. I'll do in dark

52:57.140 --> 53:02.780
table and then I'll walk away. And you know, for the purposes of capturing my family memories,

53:02.780 --> 53:08.060
I'm good enough. And that works right. Whereas you're probably more comfortable in there,

53:08.060 --> 53:14.300
um, than, than I am. So yeah, it's just, it's, it's different, but it's complimentary and

53:14.300 --> 53:19.720
it's so cool when you see people that get it and can talk that way. You guys have Linux

53:19.720 --> 53:24.380
Fest Northwest and it's a big hoo-ha and I think that's great. One of these days I'll

53:24.380 --> 53:29.500
get there. It's like my pilgrimage to Mecca, but not quite as important as that. What we

53:29.500 --> 53:34.340
have here is, uh, around, it's usually like the Friday after the 4th of July, we have

53:34.340 --> 53:42.540
a free fry day where we give away French fries. And, and if you've never been to Boise, especially

53:42.540 --> 53:47.280
downtown Boise, you've got to give it a shot. Right? So right across like the next building

53:47.280 --> 53:55.900
to us has a six story slide. Okay. Got it. So, so you got to let that sink in for a second,

53:55.900 --> 54:00.620
right? Like, like, remember the slide as a kid, right? Like it was cool and it felt really

54:00.620 --> 54:06.140
tall when you were small. So it's like somebody around here decided let's do that on steroids.

54:06.140 --> 54:10.600
Let's do that for adults, right? We have a six story slide. We give away free French

54:10.600 --> 54:15.620
fries. How can you not have fun in that environment? Right? Exactly. Right. And then there's usually

54:15.620 --> 54:20.660
a giant octopus that like starts eating the building next door as well, which is also

54:20.660 --> 54:24.660
cool. You know, I don't think they've settled on the date for free Friday next year, but

54:24.660 --> 54:29.540
if you Google it around June, July or around, uh, uh, we usually post that about May, June

54:29.540 --> 54:33.880
timeframe, you will be able to find out when free Friday is in Boise and, and the team's

54:33.880 --> 54:38.140
welcome to come. Sure. Yeah. I think you just hit on something too that I've been really

54:38.140 --> 54:42.660
impressed with the more and more I learn about the Jupiter broadcasting community, which

54:42.660 --> 54:49.460
is that, um, we're scattered a little bit everywhere, literally around the world. And

54:49.460 --> 54:54.580
I'm, I'm planning a trip to go see Alex, uh, from self-hosted, uh, we've been meaning to

54:54.580 --> 54:59.300
get connected and he and I have a similar trajectory into JP. So we were really, really

54:59.300 --> 55:03.460
close friends now. And, uh, and so I'm planning the strip and I was thinking like, Oh geez,

55:03.460 --> 55:07.260
well I'm, you know, I'm close to New York. I know there's some JP listeners there and

55:07.260 --> 55:12.860
Oh yeah, I'm, I'm, I'm going to be in Raleigh and I'm close to like, maybe I might end up

55:12.860 --> 55:16.700
in Savannah. I know some people there might go see Drew. And so it was like all of a sudden

55:16.700 --> 55:24.700
my like daily life for at least these special trips that I do, which is almost daily, um,

55:24.700 --> 55:29.980
end up being connected all the dots being connected by, uh, Jupiter broadcasting community

55:29.980 --> 55:36.580
members. And that feels like, okay, I've got a family anywhere I go now, which is so powerful.

55:36.580 --> 55:40.740
And I feel like you as a JB community member, you chose to go anywhere you can, you can

55:40.740 --> 55:46.900
find someone. Right. And, uh, and that invitation you just gave gets given all the time. And

55:46.900 --> 55:50.860
it's just like such a beautiful thing. So thank you for, for putting that out there.

55:50.860 --> 55:51.860
It's massive.

55:51.860 --> 55:56.660
Well, and, and we got to thank the folks who make the swag happen because one of the towns

55:56.660 --> 56:00.940
in this Valley is Nampa, Idaho. And it's like what, 80,000 people, not a whole lot, but

56:00.940 --> 56:04.660
it has a Costco and I'm walking in Costco one day with my wife and there's somebody

56:04.660 --> 56:08.300
wearing a last t-shirt. And so it's like, Hey man, can I take a photo with you real

56:08.300 --> 56:13.060
quick? And so we exchanged phone numbers afterwards and like, you know, every once in a while

56:13.060 --> 56:15.860
we'll text back and forth. I'm like, Hey, how's it going? It's going fine. You know,

56:15.860 --> 56:20.100
but there's, there's like, you know, three people I know of that are, that are huge fans

56:20.100 --> 56:24.540
of the program in the Valley. And that'll, there's more. I just haven't met them or connected

56:24.540 --> 56:29.980
with them. Um, cause for kids, I mean, we're running around with all kinds of activities.

56:29.980 --> 56:35.740
So I could only imagine for sure. It's a lot of fun. And it's so cool when I see that my

56:35.740 --> 56:39.920
kids don't struggle with technology because we've, they've had the experiences where something

56:39.920 --> 56:44.740
didn't work and then it became a learning opportunity. Um, and that's why when L describes

56:44.740 --> 56:50.020
learning, that's been resonating with me recently so much because it's like, Oh, this is really

56:50.020 --> 56:55.860
uncomfortable for me right now. Oh, I must be having a learning experience. The reward

56:55.860 --> 57:03.740
is at the end of this. This must be a positive thing. Yeah, exactly. For sure. Um, is there

57:03.740 --> 57:08.100
a specific, um, place where L mentioned that kind of stuff that really hit you? Like one

57:08.100 --> 57:12.680
of her talks or, or on one of the shows or something? I think it was something she tweeted

57:12.680 --> 57:16.940
or retweeted where it was like, you know, typical programmer life where it's like, you

57:16.940 --> 57:20.620
know, this sucks. I hate programming. This sucks. I hate programming. This sucks. I hate

57:20.620 --> 57:24.340
programming. This sucks. It worked. I love programming. You know, like, like seven lines

57:24.340 --> 57:30.540
down. I could totally relate to that. And you know, whoever wrote that, like had to

57:30.540 --> 57:34.780
calculate out the 240 characters going backwards to figure out how many lines they could do

57:34.780 --> 57:40.980
to make it, make it meaningful. And it's like, I really, if I could double heart that tweet,

57:40.980 --> 57:45.880
that tweet, I totally would have because it's like, I understand the thought behind this.

57:45.880 --> 57:50.260
You mentioned when we were chatting a few days ago, um, you mentioned something called

57:50.260 --> 57:56.260
the theory of constraints and you got my ears up and I'm very curious about that and I know

57:56.260 --> 58:00.180
nothing about it. So I was wondering, can you give us like a theory, theory of the constraints

58:00.180 --> 58:01.180
one Oh one.

58:01.180 --> 58:05.780
Yes. So the, Oh, I love this theory. It's so awesome. Um, so one of the things that's

58:05.780 --> 58:09.580
great here is it labels itself as a theory. So if it doesn't work in your world, then

58:09.580 --> 58:14.740
Hey, it was just a theory, right? Right. Um, but the theory of constraints says that for

58:14.740 --> 58:20.300
any process that has several steps, right? One of those steps will be the constraint.

58:20.300 --> 58:24.020
Okay. And this came out of manufacturing, right? So if you have five different work

58:24.020 --> 58:27.440
centers, right? And the first work center can do five widgets an hour. The second one

58:27.440 --> 58:31.740
can do four, the third one can do three, right? And then the last two can each do five, right?

58:31.740 --> 58:36.260
Your constraint is the one that can do three. So you really don't need to worry about the

58:36.260 --> 58:40.100
other ones because the only constraint in the system is the one that can do three. But

58:40.100 --> 58:46.720
if you have local, um, measurements on each of those, um, work resources, right? You're

58:46.720 --> 58:49.420
going to encourage the guys that can do five to do five. You're going to encourage the

58:49.420 --> 58:53.620
guy that can do four to do four. And, and then the guy that does three is sitting there

58:53.620 --> 58:57.980
and they've got a whole bunch of back, you know, back stock, right? Or backlog sitting

58:57.980 --> 59:03.780
in front of them and they can't do anything about it. Um, because that's, that's their

59:03.780 --> 59:08.540
capacity. So the theory of constraints is kind of like five steps on how to identify

59:08.540 --> 59:13.300
that. Um, and then what you can do to protect the constraint and then what you can do to

59:13.300 --> 59:17.460
improve the constraint and then how you can continue to repeat that system and go through

59:17.460 --> 59:25.500
it. Um, and it was written by, uh, uh, a physicist, right? So, so, you know, take solutions from

59:25.500 --> 59:29.620
one discipline and bring them into another, right? So physicists like to look for a common

59:29.620 --> 59:34.420
denominator among things. And so when he was called to do some manufacturing consultant,

59:34.420 --> 59:38.500
he tried to say, well, what's the common denominator in manufacturing? And this is what he came

59:38.500 --> 59:44.660
up with. His name was Eliahu Goldrat. Um, and, uh, he's written several books after

59:44.660 --> 59:49.300
that, and it's just been really great. And, and from the project management side, when

59:49.300 --> 59:53.980
you can, when your brain's wired to see something as a system, right? When you can identify

59:53.980 --> 59:58.060
the constraint and support the constraint and then be able to protect the constraint

59:58.060 --> 01:00:04.180
and allows that system to be more productive, um, and is really, um, a very, very helpful

01:00:04.180 --> 01:00:11.420
tool to use. I also wondered for you how that got applied in your personal life, even cause,

01:00:11.420 --> 01:00:16.380
cause you know, you and I both have minds that are wired to see our lives as systems.

01:00:16.380 --> 01:00:20.020
And so I imagine it carried over for you. So what happened by accident the first time

01:00:20.020 --> 01:00:24.260
those 24 semester hours in college was B and I didn't know about the theory of constraints

01:00:24.260 --> 01:00:29.380
in my, in my undergrad work, but, uh, it came about because I realized that I was spending

01:00:29.380 --> 01:00:34.860
most of my time doing research. And so it was like, okay, well how can I, how can I

01:00:34.860 --> 01:00:39.660
make my research, uh, I can, I can keep it the constraint, but I can maximize the output

01:00:39.660 --> 01:00:43.880
of that constraint. And so what I did is I figured out that you can hack college by taking

01:00:43.880 --> 01:00:50.220
complimentary classes. So you can do a full semester where you're doing, um, you know,

01:00:50.220 --> 01:00:54.100
international business, uh, and learning the communication styles. You need to be successful

01:00:54.100 --> 01:00:58.460
there and combine that with your English class. So you can take your English 201 or whatever

01:00:58.460 --> 01:01:02.220
the case may be, and you can combine that with a public speaking class and you can combine

01:01:02.220 --> 01:01:05.600
that with a rhetoric class, right? And then you can throw your math class in there for

01:01:05.600 --> 01:01:08.660
good measure. So that way you're not, you know, falling behind on what you should be

01:01:08.660 --> 01:01:13.100
working on. But, but when you, when you combined all of that stuff and then there were a few

01:01:13.100 --> 01:01:16.140
other classes I took on the, on the side as well. But when you combine all that stuff,

01:01:16.140 --> 01:01:20.380
what's beautiful about that is you can take the research from one discipline and one class

01:01:20.380 --> 01:01:24.500
and bring that as a source into another one. So you're still writing five, six, seven different

01:01:24.500 --> 01:01:25.500
papers, right?

01:01:25.500 --> 01:01:28.420
But there's clearly an overlap between them, right?

01:01:28.420 --> 01:01:29.420
Yes.

01:01:29.420 --> 01:01:33.260
And it, it allows you to leverage that going forward. And so when we take a look at our

01:01:33.260 --> 01:01:39.540
lives and we say, okay, well where's my constraint, right? So I don't like not being able to learn.

01:01:39.540 --> 01:01:45.020
I'm a lifelong learner, right? My commute's a half hour. And so I listen to podcasts and

01:01:45.020 --> 01:01:49.860
I listen to audio books because now that half hour is not constraining me from learning.

01:01:49.860 --> 01:01:54.020
I'm learning, I've been learning so much recently I've had to turn it off and just have quiet

01:01:54.020 --> 01:01:58.260
on the way home for about 10 minutes. Um, and it wasn't because of stress, it was because

01:01:58.260 --> 01:02:02.620
I need to absorb and, and get that into my head. So there's different ways of doing that.

01:02:02.620 --> 01:02:06.540
When you're, look at your system and your photography workflow and figure out, Hey,

01:02:06.540 --> 01:02:12.420
where's my constraint and, and what does that look like? And you don't want to remove it.

01:02:12.420 --> 01:02:16.500
You want to hack it. You want to make it more powerful. If it's really bad, yes, you can

01:02:16.500 --> 01:02:20.020
absolutely re you know, like adjust it so it's no longer the constraint, but then you

01:02:20.020 --> 01:02:24.180
have to go looking for it again. So sometimes it's valuable just to, Hey, let's leave this

01:02:24.180 --> 01:02:28.540
be the constraint, but both the workflow around it and figure out how to, how to make things

01:02:28.540 --> 01:02:29.540
better.

01:02:29.540 --> 01:02:36.060
Yeah. I like how one of the aspects you mentioned in that process is to protect the constraint.

01:02:36.060 --> 01:02:40.140
And that feels like, Oh wait, we always want to like break down the things that aren't

01:02:40.140 --> 01:02:45.860
working or like get rid of them like you were saying, but, but that protection piece feels

01:02:45.860 --> 01:02:48.820
really meaningful. So I'm going to have to dive into that.

01:02:48.820 --> 01:02:52.420
Well in a lot of the audience will be familiar with Kanban boards and what you need to recognize

01:02:52.420 --> 01:02:56.940
when you're using a Kanban board is you are protecting the constraint because you're letting

01:02:56.940 --> 01:03:02.860
the constraint not be distracted by having to give a status update, right? And so because

01:03:02.860 --> 01:03:06.140
somebody can walk up to the board, right? Whether it's digital or physical, it doesn't

01:03:06.140 --> 01:03:10.300
matter. They can walk up to the board and they can see what is currently going on and

01:03:10.300 --> 01:03:13.860
what the status is. So as long as your users are disciplined, as long as your resources

01:03:13.860 --> 01:03:18.420
are disciplined to update the board, you know, and that becomes accurate, then you're protecting

01:03:18.420 --> 01:03:23.500
the constraint. And, and one of the ways that you can use to explain that to them, cause

01:03:23.500 --> 01:03:27.540
they'll grok it pretty quickly is if, cause some people are like, I just get worked on,

01:03:27.540 --> 01:03:31.380
just leave me alone. I just get worked on. No, no, no. I need you to not only get the

01:03:31.380 --> 01:03:35.860
work done, I need you to just do this little thing, little admin thing every, you know,

01:03:35.860 --> 01:03:39.800
sometimes hourly, right? But more often, you know, once or twice a day to let people know

01:03:39.800 --> 01:03:44.500
where things are at and reset yourself. And I do that with my boss right now. It's like

01:03:44.500 --> 01:03:48.180
I showed up and I had a different tool set in mind than he did. And I said, look, dude,

01:03:48.180 --> 01:03:51.140
I said, I'm going to put my tool set over here and you're going to have visibility to

01:03:51.140 --> 01:03:54.180
it all the time. You're not going to have to wonder what I'm doing. It's going to be

01:03:54.180 --> 01:03:58.200
right here. And, and he's been learning how to use the tool and be able to see what's

01:03:58.200 --> 01:04:01.320
on my plate and be able to say, Hey, this has been sitting there for a while. You know,

01:04:01.320 --> 01:04:04.460
we can have that dialogue now. So it's been helpful.

01:04:04.460 --> 01:04:11.780
Wow. That's an amazing tool. I am very jazzed to integrate it into my own pieces. So thank

01:04:11.780 --> 01:04:17.860
you for sharing that. It's awesome. Uh, I wondered, uh, Jacob, if you, if there's anything

01:04:17.860 --> 01:04:24.100
that you wanted to share with the community, uh, kind of an ask something you maybe want

01:04:24.100 --> 01:04:28.920
them to try or think about there's, there's two things here. One's selfless and one is

01:04:28.920 --> 01:04:34.140
selfish or self-interested. Oh, I like this. Okay. So, so the first one is to, to tie off

01:04:34.140 --> 01:04:39.180
with your interview with wimpy about poo pooing out other people and their projects. And,

01:04:39.180 --> 01:04:43.900
and mine's, mine's just a little different twist is whether you're a user or a consumer

01:04:43.900 --> 01:04:51.140
or producer in that space, uh, take the time to be grateful for what it is. Um, you know,

01:04:51.140 --> 01:04:56.700
and maybe that means disconnecting first to really think through what that is. We're using

01:04:56.700 --> 01:05:03.860
code, right? That's 20, 50, 30 years old, right? Have we ever bothered to say thank

01:05:03.860 --> 01:05:08.980
you, right? The, the guy who invented bash, I heard an interview he did. I, what a totally

01:05:08.980 --> 01:05:15.380
realistic story. He invented globbing before he invented quotes. And I'm, I don't know

01:05:15.380 --> 01:05:19.300
if too many people under there's a part of the audience that gets that right off me saying

01:05:19.300 --> 01:05:26.380
that, but, but what that means is that he sat there and he, as he was welding out bash,

01:05:26.380 --> 01:05:30.700
he figured out how to do that. You know, asterisk, you know, delete asterisk, everything, right?

01:05:30.700 --> 01:05:35.940
You know, type of thing, right? So he was, he was working. And so on, on making sure

01:05:35.940 --> 01:05:39.860
you can use the asterisk and it would delete all the things. And as he was doing that,

01:05:39.860 --> 01:05:45.420
he, he decided to delete all the working files that he had in a particular directory. So

01:05:45.420 --> 01:05:49.980
we put that particular directory or a particular thing in quotes and ended up deleting everything

01:05:49.980 --> 01:05:55.820
on the system and had to start over and rewrite bash. That's one way to learn. And I think,

01:05:55.820 --> 01:05:59.980
I think bash is better because of it. But when you realize that there's a human story

01:05:59.980 --> 01:06:03.220
behind it, oh my goodness, doesn't it make it easier to just say thank you for sticking

01:06:03.220 --> 01:06:08.140
it out and finishing that, you know, thank you guys for sticking it out and finishing

01:06:08.140 --> 01:06:11.820
that. Even if I may not be using it right now, cause it may not be how I want to express

01:06:11.820 --> 01:06:17.020
myself. Pause, take a moment and say thank you to somebody, handwritten card, a post

01:06:17.020 --> 01:06:22.260
on Twitter. So pick your favorite host, pick your favorite, you know, tool and, and find

01:06:22.260 --> 01:06:28.020
a way to tell the person thank you in a way that, that just lets them know you, you cared.

01:06:28.020 --> 01:06:34.020
And so that's the selfless task that's out there. And the other one is, is, you know,

01:06:34.020 --> 01:06:38.260
I guess that my blog is really unpopular. I wonder what it would be like if it were

01:06:38.260 --> 01:06:45.020
popular. So tell us a little bit what it's about, what you put down there, how you're

01:06:45.020 --> 01:06:49.020
dedicated to it and what you'd like people to get out of it. So I've never been able

01:06:49.020 --> 01:06:52.820
to run an agile project. The military runs waterfall. The projects have been on a worker

01:06:52.820 --> 01:06:58.660
waterfall oriented and I wanted to try something that was completely agile. And so listening

01:06:58.660 --> 01:07:03.120
again, the Ubuntu podcast was influential in this where I think it was a Popey was saying

01:07:03.120 --> 01:07:07.500
that he would just do a Twitter kind of audio feed and then send that out or not Twitter.

01:07:07.500 --> 01:07:12.060
It was over a telegram. He's just telegram feed. And I was like, wow, that's like podcast

01:07:12.060 --> 01:07:16.780
MVP. Like I've got an iPhone. I'm just going to go ahead and start recording something

01:07:16.780 --> 01:07:21.020
to call the podcast. And, and so I've been adding every week or every two weeks, I will

01:07:21.020 --> 01:07:24.660
change the workflow cause I'll look at my constraint and I'll change the workflow one

01:07:24.660 --> 01:07:28.900
or two steps. And I'm getting close now where it's like, okay, once I've got episode numbers,

01:07:28.900 --> 01:07:33.540
this thing's legit and it's happening. And I think I'm about a week away. And that's

01:07:33.540 --> 01:07:36.340
been another thing too, is like as first is just, I'm just going to talk, we'll figure

01:07:36.340 --> 01:07:41.220
out what the topic is later. And where I've landed over the last couple of weeks is taking

01:07:41.220 --> 01:07:46.140
curiosity and gratitude and taking a look at the people and systems in our lives that,

01:07:46.140 --> 01:07:50.740
that make a difference. There are about five minutes and it sometimes gets real nerdy and

01:07:50.740 --> 01:07:56.580
weird. Like, like there's, Oh my goodness. What was it yesterday? This might not make

01:07:56.580 --> 01:08:03.180
it a family show. We'll find out. But, um, synonymous words don't equate to the same

01:08:03.180 --> 01:08:10.700
thing. Okay. Okay. Um, and if you understand English as a system, right, then this becomes

01:08:10.700 --> 01:08:16.340
really cool. So English is a system and I like exploring English. So, but dial, right?

01:08:16.340 --> 01:08:21.220
Okay. It means that your phone made a call now, but, and booty are synonymous, right?

01:08:21.220 --> 01:08:28.180
Your button, your booty are the same thing. I see where this is. All right. Continue.

01:08:28.180 --> 01:08:34.860
And dial and call, right? Are synonymous words as well. But dial is not booty call. Right?

01:08:34.860 --> 01:08:43.100
Right. One may lead to the other. Well, yeah. Yeah. I didn't take it that way in the episode

01:08:43.100 --> 01:08:48.740
when I recorded it, but you're not wrong. Um, one of the things that does for us though,

01:08:48.740 --> 01:08:52.220
and I like to point this out in the show is it means that even though you may be using

01:08:52.220 --> 01:08:57.420
synonymous language, right? You may not be conveying the same message. And so let's stop

01:08:57.420 --> 01:09:00.620
and take a look at what is the language we're using? When are we understood and when are

01:09:00.620 --> 01:09:03.620
we not understood? So that way we can be more productive. And that's kind of the way I take

01:09:03.620 --> 01:09:07.980
it is, you know, find something that I enjoy a little bit curious about and obscure and

01:09:07.980 --> 01:09:12.540
then, and then pull that together and, and, uh, having fun. So, so I did my challenge

01:09:12.540 --> 01:09:17.060
on this. I challenged the user error guys. What is the most useless job that you would

01:09:17.060 --> 01:09:21.900
be willing to do? Oh, interesting. Right? So most useless job that you'd be willing

01:09:21.900 --> 01:09:25.780
to do. And mine is absolutely really fun. So I'll tell you mine while you think of yours,

01:09:25.780 --> 01:09:31.840
Brent. So most useless job that you'd be willing to do. And mine is, uh, you know, from having

01:09:31.840 --> 01:09:35.380
worked for the government, I know they're pretty ineffective and ineffectual. And so

01:09:35.380 --> 01:09:41.100
they, they create a lot of jobs that I consider useless or not value add. And, um, so you

01:09:41.100 --> 01:09:45.860
have to find a position where one of those jobs that are created by requirement, you

01:09:45.860 --> 01:09:48.340
know, there's not actually the requirement on the ground. And so what I came up with

01:09:48.340 --> 01:09:55.280
was I would love to be a lifeguard at the Olympics, totally useless. And then as I was

01:09:55.280 --> 01:09:58.520
talking on the show and recording and I was like, oh my goodness, this is the greatest

01:09:58.520 --> 01:10:03.860
reality TV show ever. If the Olympics goes to Los Angeles and I think it might be scheduled

01:10:03.860 --> 01:10:07.500
to, if the Olympics is going to Los Angeles, somebody should create a reality TV show where

01:10:07.500 --> 01:10:12.500
they get people to compete for being lifeguards. Right. And then at the end of it, help them

01:10:12.500 --> 01:10:16.020
realize that it's the most useless job ever. Right. Cause you'd be this great competition,

01:10:16.020 --> 01:10:19.060
like these really buff, you know, strong guys. And then at the end of it, you'd be like,

01:10:19.060 --> 01:10:21.540
Hey, by the way, you're just going to sit there for eight hours a day while you're watching

01:10:21.540 --> 01:10:29.740
Michael Phelps. It could be worse. Oh yeah. That wasn't the question, right? The question

01:10:29.740 --> 01:10:33.780
is the most useless job you'd be willing to do. So right. Do you have, do you have

01:10:33.780 --> 01:10:38.500
a most useless job that you'd be willing to do in the same kind of vein as yours? I would

01:10:38.500 --> 01:10:44.000
be willing to do something where I get to observe people. Uh, I think connecting with

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:51.900
people, uh, is super powerful. So maybe it would be like, I don't know, something like

01:10:51.900 --> 01:10:56.440
greeting the greeters at Walmart or something like that, you know, uh, where I can just

01:10:56.440 --> 01:11:03.260
like watch people and their behaviors and just kind of enjoy life and people's lives

01:11:03.260 --> 01:11:06.180
for what they are. I think something like that would be pretty interesting.

01:11:06.180 --> 01:11:11.060
So yours is actually trying to add value. You're so wired that way, Brent. That's, that,

01:11:11.060 --> 01:11:17.700
that is awesome. No, it tells you something about your personality. You are wired to connect

01:11:17.700 --> 01:11:23.180
with people and, and you really do a good job. And that is one of the reasons, um, for

01:11:23.180 --> 01:11:28.260
those who, who aren't quite aware, this is the first time at this large of an audience

01:11:28.260 --> 01:11:31.740
that I've ever really talked about some of the things I've dealt with in my past. And

01:11:31.740 --> 01:11:35.020
one of the reasons for that is because of the way that the, the, the way that you, as

01:11:35.020 --> 01:11:39.980
a host connect with the audience and connect with your, your guests. Um, and it's, this

01:11:39.980 --> 01:11:42.500
has felt really comfortable and I really appreciate it.

01:11:42.500 --> 01:11:48.780
Awesome. Well, I feel so completely honored to help you tell that story. Uh, I feel like

01:11:48.780 --> 01:11:55.580
it has been obviously a super important story for you, uh, with massive growth in it and

01:11:55.580 --> 01:12:02.380
vulnerability, of course. Uh, and to see where you are now, uh, you're still taking those

01:12:02.380 --> 01:12:07.100
experiences you've had and giving gifts to the people around you, which is really powerful.

01:12:07.100 --> 01:12:13.740
And so if I could have some way of helping you spread that message, I feel like, uh,

01:12:13.740 --> 01:12:18.700
I feel like that's a total honor. So thank you for reaching out to me with it. That's,

01:12:18.700 --> 01:12:24.060
that's huge. If people want to get connected with you to say thanks, since you put that,

01:12:24.060 --> 01:12:26.700
that challenge out there, where, where do you think you would send them?

01:12:26.700 --> 01:12:31.660
Well, the blog podcast YouTube channel thing is all parking thought.com, right? So the

01:12:31.660 --> 01:12:35.360
idea is I take my drive out or I take my thoughts out for a bit of a drive and then I share

01:12:35.360 --> 01:12:40.140
them with you when I park. Um, it's a one take sort of deal. It's going to stay a one

01:12:40.140 --> 01:12:44.540
take sort of deal. Um, and it's honestly my morning coffee. Well, I don't drink coffee,

01:12:44.540 --> 01:12:48.900
but it's kind of like my morning coffee because it gets me starting to practice communicating

01:12:48.900 --> 01:12:53.540
before I go into work a lot of times. And so that, that helps me prepare for the day

01:12:53.540 --> 01:12:58.820
and gives me a frame to think through. So, yeah, so you're welcome to find me there.

01:12:58.820 --> 01:13:00.860
Twitter is on there as well.

01:13:00.860 --> 01:13:06.140
Right. We'll find all the goods there. That's amazing. Uh, Jacob, thank you so much for

01:13:06.140 --> 01:13:11.820
this chat. It's been a huge pleasure. Uh, thank you for your time connecting. And, uh,

01:13:11.820 --> 01:13:16.180
I definitely hope that we get to connect in person at some point, uh, maybe for some fries

01:13:16.180 --> 01:13:28.900
or something like that.
