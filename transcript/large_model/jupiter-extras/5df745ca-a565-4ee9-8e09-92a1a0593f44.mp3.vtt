Hello, everyone. Welcome to Brunch with Brent. Joining me today is Elish Poli-Gonzalez. Elish,

00:16.120 --> 00:17.120
how are you doing?

00:17.120 --> 00:19.400
Good, good. Very good. How are you?

00:19.400 --> 00:23.880
I'm doing great. Yeah, it's good to be connected with you. You've got a pretty neat spot. Some

00:23.880 --> 00:29.500
people might know you as the president of the board of directors at KDE, which is kind

00:29.500 --> 00:35.360
of neat. How does it feel to have had that position for, what, since September, right?

00:35.360 --> 00:43.480
Yeah, since September. Well, it's good. I've been in this board of directors for five years

00:43.480 --> 00:50.880
and a half now, five years when I became a president. Well, I was vice president before.

00:50.880 --> 00:57.280
In actual terms of the things I do, it hasn't really changed that much. Some people do see

00:57.280 --> 01:04.760
me differently, which feels a bit weird, but life goes on and we keep going.

01:04.760 --> 01:10.840
It's sort of interesting how titles can sometimes change the way we see people even though they're

01:10.840 --> 01:16.920
necessarily the same person they were even a few months ago. You are clearly not new

01:16.920 --> 01:21.440
to the board of directors. For those of us who aren't that familiar with how KDE and

01:21.440 --> 01:27.040
the board of directors interfaces, what kind of things do you do there? How do you collaborate

01:27.040 --> 01:31.160
with other people? How is that important to the KDE projects, for instance?

01:31.160 --> 01:36.800
All right. I know it's not exactly what you asked, but let me give you the distance kind

01:36.800 --> 01:37.800
of answer.

01:37.800 --> 01:38.800
Great.

01:38.800 --> 01:44.680
What is KDE? KDE started a long time ago as a desktop. It's not anymore. Nowadays, KDE

01:44.680 --> 01:51.920
is a community with tons of people that develop a bunch of free software projects, right?

01:51.920 --> 01:58.040
As such, KDE is a community and a community cannot do certain things like having money

01:58.040 --> 02:05.160
or just charge for doing anything, right? At some point, somebody created a foundation

02:05.160 --> 02:13.600
called the KDEV, which is the thing I am president of, right? I am not president of KDE in paper

02:13.600 --> 02:19.180
and in practice, but I am the president of the KDEV, which is this legal organization

02:19.180 --> 02:29.200
that is based in Germany around the KDE project. This organization deals with money and certain

02:29.200 --> 02:37.120
resources that the association have. We try to do the best to support the project and

02:37.120 --> 02:41.880
make sure that the free software gets developed as it should.

02:41.880 --> 02:48.920
How do we work? Well, internally, the board, it's five people. We change every three years.

02:48.920 --> 02:55.800
And some people will have some kind of preferences and they will take these tasks more seriously.

02:55.800 --> 03:03.120
But in general, we try to spread the tasks internally. We try not to have a big hierarchy

03:03.120 --> 03:06.040
inside of our small team anyways.

03:06.040 --> 03:10.760
That's great. Yeah, it sounds like you really end up just playing on your strengths in that

03:10.760 --> 03:17.800
collaboration. And thank you for the background there. I think when it comes to foundations,

03:17.800 --> 03:23.120
at least I speak for myself, it's kind of new to me, learning how it all works and what

03:23.120 --> 03:30.560
pieces are necessary and how they're organized. So that transparency is really fascinating

03:30.560 --> 03:38.040
to me, really, I would say. You also have done a lot of development for KDE. You started

03:38.040 --> 03:43.560
quite a while ago. When did you start developing for KDE? And I imagine that has clearly led

03:43.560 --> 03:44.560
to where you are now.

03:44.560 --> 03:50.000
Actually, I started in KDE before I started in KDE, because I started developing an application.

03:50.000 --> 03:59.600
Well, I don't know, it was 2004 or five, which was or is still K algebra, which is math application

03:59.600 --> 04:07.800
and calculator. I started developing it on my own. And at some point, I was reached out

04:07.800 --> 04:14.600
by KDEedu, the education program within KDE. And they said, have you considered putting

04:14.600 --> 04:20.160
the application in here? And I put it in, right? Like my first commit was the whole

04:20.160 --> 04:23.720
application at once.

04:23.720 --> 04:29.440
Can I just ask, what was it about KDE back then that was curious to you? Because you

04:29.440 --> 04:34.480
were developing this application for yourself, as far as I understand. So how did they sort

04:34.480 --> 04:40.640
of come across it? And how did that come about? I just wonder if that might be a helpful story

04:40.640 --> 04:46.000
or anecdote for someone who might have a good idea and might want to share it with the project.

04:46.000 --> 04:55.280
Well, back then, I was getting interested in computer science. I was just starting university.

04:55.280 --> 05:01.120
And I wanted to play around with certain technologies. So I knew I wanted to do this project. Actually,

05:01.120 --> 05:07.360
I had started to think about it a little bit in the past. In the first versions, it even

05:07.360 --> 05:16.240
resembled a lot another application I had been using when I was in high school. And

05:16.240 --> 05:22.560
there's a lot of topics that are interesting when developing such an application like a

05:22.560 --> 05:28.040
calculator that were interesting to me, like how to write a parser and how to do the plotting

05:28.040 --> 05:34.600
properly and the 3D bits. It was more of a, I know that this was something useful to me

05:34.600 --> 05:42.360
at some point. And then it allowed me to test myself a little bit because, well, I was learning

05:42.360 --> 05:48.280
a lot of things because, well, that's what you do. And I needed to put my learnings into

05:48.280 --> 05:56.640
something. And actually, it shaped a lot how I learned and actually how I ended up deriving

05:56.640 --> 05:59.680
professionally over time.

05:59.680 --> 06:06.200
Do you find then that for you, learning has to be tied to a project? Applying that knowledge

06:06.200 --> 06:11.240
is the way that it integrates for you with the most depth?

06:11.240 --> 06:17.680
There's definitely a component. I'm not going to say it's the only way I can learn, but

06:17.680 --> 06:25.000
Right, of course. But if you had a preference, maybe. The reason I ask is what fascinates

06:25.000 --> 06:31.720
me is sort of how we all get to the places where we are. And I feel like if we discover

06:31.720 --> 06:37.680
or chase the means by which we learn best, you know, sometimes that's collaboratively,

06:37.680 --> 06:44.720
sometimes that's independently, then sometimes we can get to places that are actually really

06:44.720 --> 06:49.560
great in making our strengths possible. So it sounds like in many ways you found that.

06:49.560 --> 06:57.120
Yeah, for sure. Also, a big interesting part about software development is that you can

06:57.120 --> 07:03.000
do badly and the computer is going to tell you. So you don't have to disappoint anyone.

07:03.000 --> 07:08.680
You can see you did wrong and then do it differently. And in the end, if you get the right result,

07:08.680 --> 07:16.240
it might not be through the correct set of steps, but it's still progress to some extent.

07:16.240 --> 07:18.480
And you get to be loved on that.

07:18.480 --> 07:22.600
So there's this feedback loop, this quick feedback loop that you get to sort of iterate

07:22.600 --> 07:29.040
on your ideas and your projects in a way maybe that isn't available to other professions.

07:29.040 --> 07:36.640
Yeah, definitely. It's something that was crucial to me in this approach. And even now

07:36.640 --> 07:42.880
I look at the code that I started to produce back then and I'm not going to say I'm ashamed

07:42.880 --> 07:46.040
of it, but it wasn't good.

07:46.040 --> 07:50.440
It was of a past Elish, right? This is present Elish.

07:50.440 --> 07:53.520
Yeah. Everything I do is from a past Elish.

07:53.520 --> 07:55.160
Right. Fair enough.

07:55.160 --> 08:02.080
But this specific past Elish wasn't that good. But that's fine, right? And I don't know.

08:02.080 --> 08:03.560
Didn't hurt anyone.

08:03.560 --> 08:09.600
No. And that can still be valuable work, even though it may not be at the same caliber that

08:09.600 --> 08:11.040
you're at now.

08:11.040 --> 08:20.200
It has been. I've been having users since the very beginnings. And it's been always

08:20.200 --> 08:26.280
people who have been using the project for some things or others. And they have been

08:26.280 --> 08:31.040
reasonably happy. So, well, there's that, right?

08:31.040 --> 08:38.880
That's important. How have you seen those users change in the last 10 years or so? Does

08:38.880 --> 08:42.480
it feel like the community has shifted or changed or grown in some ways?

08:42.480 --> 08:48.120
Well, in the end, when you get users, you get users for the things you have, right?

08:48.120 --> 08:53.800
They might ask you, I would like to have this thing or this other thing. But in the end,

08:53.800 --> 09:01.080
what they reach out to you about is about the present. So they don't really change that

09:01.080 --> 09:07.520
much. In general, when a user reaches out to you, the process is, hey, I've been using

09:07.520 --> 09:15.800
this project. It's kind of nice, I guess. But, and then they explain you the problem.

09:15.800 --> 09:20.120
That's by email. That's when they reach you out by email. When they reach you out by backtracking

09:20.120 --> 09:26.920
system or chat, they remove the pleasantries and they go directly to the problem.

09:26.920 --> 09:33.040
But yeah, it's hard to tell if people change. I mean, people have definitely changed, right?

09:33.040 --> 09:42.200
Also the competing alternatives to what I've been doing have also exploded in several ways.

09:42.200 --> 09:44.840
So that also has an impact.

09:44.840 --> 09:51.360
Do you find that user feedback to be exhausting in some ways? Because it sounds like a never-ending

09:51.360 --> 09:57.520
flow of people suggesting things are wrong. I mean, they often have the right intentions

09:57.520 --> 10:02.080
in mind of trying to improve and to help find bugs and things like that.

10:02.080 --> 10:07.800
Actually it's one of the hot topics in free software, and it has been for years.

10:07.800 --> 10:09.080
And essential, really.

10:09.080 --> 10:14.080
In free software, we're very open and we're very exposed as developers to what people

10:14.080 --> 10:19.800
want and to their demands. And actually, I would say it's one of the selling points of

10:19.800 --> 10:25.680
free software, right? You can talk to people or you can get someone and convince them to

10:25.680 --> 10:34.480
fix something and they do it, right? So there's no barrier between user and the creation.

10:34.480 --> 10:41.000
But on the other hand, you need to find ways to shield yourself sometimes because, well,

10:41.000 --> 10:48.440
some people have fun being hurtful. I mean, I've been around for a long time, so it means

10:48.440 --> 10:53.440
that it hasn't broken me, but I know many people who have gotten broken by that. And

10:53.440 --> 10:58.800
it's really such part of the whole process, right?

10:58.800 --> 11:01.720
Because it potentially means that we lose good people.

11:01.720 --> 11:06.160
Well, not potentially. Like, literally, it means.

11:06.160 --> 11:12.120
Right. Do you have any advice either for the person on the development side, you know,

11:12.120 --> 11:16.800
the receiving side, or for the people on the giving side, you know, that are reaching out

11:16.800 --> 11:19.440
with some of these bugs and things?

11:19.440 --> 11:26.140
Be nice would be definitely a number one thing, right? Or be empathetic at least. Remember

11:26.140 --> 11:33.720
that you're talking to people. I guess that in the, I would say normal world, we're used

11:33.720 --> 11:41.080
to like, so many layers of communication that you have to try to make an impact so that

11:41.080 --> 11:49.400
your demands go through hierarchy or several steps. And in free software, that is not the

11:49.400 --> 11:57.560
case, right? And you like see people reporting bugs or on mailing lists, demanding people

11:57.560 --> 12:06.200
to work for them because, and this is hurtful, not being hurtful, being positive, being engaging,

12:06.200 --> 12:12.160
explaining why something is a problem for you, and how while it's a problem for you,

12:12.160 --> 12:17.860
like the wall is not going to end. It's always a good way to contextualize this, this kind

12:17.860 --> 12:19.480
of problematic, I would say.

12:19.480 --> 12:25.680
Yeah, I think two things that stood out there for me in that advice you just gave was empathy

12:25.680 --> 12:30.240
was the first one, because I've encountered very few situations where empathy is not a

12:30.240 --> 12:37.880
helpful trait. And also just being collaborative, you know, if you discover a problem, or you

12:37.880 --> 12:44.520
would like something fixed or integrated, I think it sounds like the collaborative approach,

12:44.520 --> 12:49.360
if the software developer is open to that, sounds really beneficial for everyone. As

12:49.360 --> 12:54.060
the person who found the bug, you might get some insight into what the project is dealing

12:54.060 --> 12:59.640
with or where that sits as a priority. And as the developer, you might get someone who

12:59.640 --> 13:03.380
can really make a difference and perhaps a future contributor to.

13:03.380 --> 13:10.480
Every project I've worked on, I've had a couple of, well, I would say, maybe power users or

13:10.480 --> 13:20.120
well, people who will go all the way to help you solve the bugs. And like when a bug report

13:20.120 --> 13:27.740
is properly reported, it's so much easier and faster to solve, right? And this is something

13:27.740 --> 13:35.080
we need to remind ourselves. It's not about like being the loudest, but also as a developer,

13:35.080 --> 13:39.840
be it free software or not, that doesn't matter. You have an amount of time that you're going

13:39.840 --> 13:47.280
to have to spend into solving a problem. If this is less, it's more likely that you will

13:47.280 --> 13:50.240
be able to do it, right?

13:50.240 --> 13:55.400
So there's a big difference between a bug report that says, my application exploded

13:55.400 --> 14:01.240
and a bug report that says, when I do exactly these steps, my application explodes, or I

14:01.240 --> 14:08.600
get this error message, or here's a bug trace with proper debug symbols or not. And obviously,

14:08.600 --> 14:14.400
there's a learning curve for the reporter, and we cannot expect everyone to go all the

14:14.400 --> 14:21.360
way there, because we all have other things to do than reporting bugs. But if you really

14:21.360 --> 14:28.480
care about something and can spend some time into solving it, I think that it's a nice

14:28.480 --> 14:34.280
idea to do so. Because you're not like solving it only for yourself, which you are, but you're

14:34.280 --> 14:39.160
solving it for everyone. And actually, the whole solving it for everyone is one of the

14:39.160 --> 14:41.120
nice things about life, right?

14:41.120 --> 14:46.040
Yeah, one of the strengths of open source, I think, and maybe the reason that many of

14:46.040 --> 14:51.640
us are part of it is that it feels like a collective good that we're doing for the world.

14:51.640 --> 14:54.800
Well, it doesn't feel it. It actually is, right?

14:54.800 --> 14:57.000
There, you catch me again.

14:57.000 --> 15:06.160
Part of the problem that a big part of the world doesn't want to make use of it. But

15:06.160 --> 15:07.840
when they do, they're going to love it.

15:07.840 --> 15:14.320
Yeah, I came across some stats. And of course, there are many sources of these kind of things.

15:14.320 --> 15:21.360
But KD itself, which that includes a lot of different pieces of software. But I think

15:21.360 --> 15:29.480
they're suggesting plasma in this case, like as far as I read, being used heavily in Turkey

15:29.480 --> 15:34.720
and the Turkish government, everywhere from their armed forces, Ministry of Foreign Affairs

15:34.720 --> 15:41.600
and National Defense, the police, it has been used at CERN quite a bit. In Germany, I believe

15:41.600 --> 15:49.620
they have something like 11,000 systems running it used in a NASA Mars mission, etc, etc.

15:49.620 --> 15:54.000
And that doesn't mention the desktop users either. But how does it feel for you to be

15:54.000 --> 16:01.440
kind of have your thumb on or be touching so many users with the work that you're doing?

16:01.440 --> 16:06.440
Well, one of the complex things about how we've been conducting free software, and actually,

16:06.440 --> 16:10.720
it's been one of the turning points of KD is actually the whole defining a vision and

16:10.720 --> 16:17.200
like who are you making your your software for? In general, I haven't been thinking about

16:17.200 --> 16:26.720
like, what will happen when this change happens in NASA, or I don't know, CERN, etc, right?

16:26.720 --> 16:33.440
Like, do you think how do I fix this problem? And then when you talk to the different organizations,

16:33.440 --> 16:38.680
as a president or a representative of the community, well, then you realize that that

16:38.680 --> 16:45.280
this, this software is actually being used in all of these places. I mean, actually,

16:45.280 --> 16:48.720
most of the time, we don't even know that that this is happening.

16:48.720 --> 16:51.360
Of course, one of the challenges really.

16:51.360 --> 16:59.960
Yeah, we only learn through chance, right? Like these announcements that like, they show

16:59.960 --> 17:05.880
a screenshot of somebody working and like, you see, oh, they're using plasma, or they're

17:05.880 --> 17:13.280
using Linux, or they're using Krita, right? It's more anecdotal in practice than actually

17:13.280 --> 17:18.400
it should be, right? I would like to be talking more to these organizations and learning more

17:18.400 --> 17:27.440
about the problems they had. But communication is something that, well, is expensive to humanity,

17:27.440 --> 17:36.360
I guess. And it shows. I remember having long conversations about that with somebody from

17:36.360 --> 17:45.040
Brazil. Like, I think it was around 2010, there was a big deployment of KD software

17:45.040 --> 17:52.400
in Brazil. Well, I was the maintainer, actually, still am, of KD Edu. And I was telling her,

17:52.400 --> 17:58.240
well, how is it that you have so many millions of people running our software, running our

17:58.240 --> 18:05.120
applications, but then we don't get back reports for this software, right? Like, is everything

18:05.120 --> 18:13.320
we make perfect? And she didn't say yes. She said, well, teachers will probably not know

18:13.320 --> 18:20.360
how to report properly, or their English might not be great. I mean, there were reasons why

18:20.360 --> 18:27.600
this didn't happen, right? But in practice, we had, well, millions of users over there.

18:27.600 --> 18:34.600
I don't know, we still have. But the conclusions that they created didn't really reach out

18:34.600 --> 18:42.400
to humanity, which is a bit sad in this regard. But then you realize how it makes a huge difference

18:42.400 --> 18:49.120
when the involved people understand free software properly. We hear very often about how organizations

18:49.120 --> 18:57.520
might be adopting free software or open source solutions. But when there's randomly people

18:57.520 --> 19:04.640
who have been involved in the movement, in the communities, and have the know-how, the

19:04.640 --> 19:10.440
experience will flow much more, well, beautifully for both parts. And I think that this is really

19:10.440 --> 19:11.440
nice when it happens.

19:11.440 --> 19:17.040
Yeah, the big question, I suppose, is how do you encourage it to happen more? I don't

19:17.040 --> 19:18.040
know what that answer is.

19:18.040 --> 19:23.000
I mean, I know that KD has a problem, and probably the Linux desktop does. But how do

19:23.000 --> 19:29.080
you make sure that people can stay around it and be professional about it? The money

19:29.080 --> 19:39.640
flow is a bit spotty and not very clear. We don't have very clear business models either.

19:39.640 --> 19:47.200
And it does have its advantages. We're not really governed by evil corporations or, well,

19:47.200 --> 19:53.560
good corporations. We're not just led by corporations. But on the other hand, there's

19:53.560 --> 20:02.240
people who, well, to live, they have to work on something else. And, well, that's not ideal,

20:02.240 --> 20:03.240
right?

20:03.240 --> 20:08.920
Yeah, I mean, that is the challenge, isn't it? How do you keep the good people around

20:08.920 --> 20:14.800
or allow them to work on the things that they actually feel really empowered to be working

20:14.800 --> 20:22.960
on, like free software? For many of us, we have done a lot just through our hearts, right?

20:22.960 --> 20:26.720
So how do you keep those people around when they need to feed their families and pay the

20:26.720 --> 20:28.360
rent and all of that?

20:28.360 --> 20:32.920
Some of us are lucky enough to be able to do it. Like this is my case. So I feel a bit

20:32.920 --> 20:37.960
bad talking about this problematic when I don't have this problem. While this is a problem,

20:37.960 --> 20:43.560
it also has the advantage that you have when all these big super corporations, because

20:43.560 --> 20:52.400
there's super good free software developers around, right? Like a lot of the best developers

20:52.400 --> 20:57.640
that you will find in the market, well, did open source at some point because it's a great

20:57.640 --> 21:04.920
way to become a good professional. So you will have really senior people in the biggest

21:04.920 --> 21:13.120
corporations that have an open source background and they know how it works. And, well, this

21:13.120 --> 21:15.440
links back a bit with what we were discussing before.

21:15.440 --> 21:20.880
You know, those end up being proponents of free software in some of those larger corporations

21:20.880 --> 21:24.320
around the world. So it sounds like a benefit as well in some ways.

21:24.320 --> 21:30.960
Yeah, it's a matter of people wanting to keeping the flame alive, right?

21:30.960 --> 21:37.280
Yeah, right. It's always a balance. You did mention that you're lucky enough to be sponsored

21:37.280 --> 21:41.680
to be working on KDE full time. Can you talk about that a little bit?

21:41.680 --> 21:47.120
I had been working when I was at university doing free software stuff. I did some contracting,

21:47.120 --> 21:54.160
I did Google Summer of Code, which was nice. But when I was finishing university and I

21:54.160 --> 21:59.320
was doing my master's thesis, I kind of wanted to continue doing it, but I didn't really

21:59.320 --> 22:06.160
know where to look at. And what happened back then was that I saw a tweet, someone saying,

22:06.160 --> 22:15.720
I am looking for KDE developers, contact me. And I did. It was by who nowadays is my boss.

22:15.720 --> 22:21.220
But well, nobody really knew them back then. I actually was the first employee in Blue

22:21.220 --> 22:28.000
Systems and it was all very weird and spotty. But I came through with it because I had to

22:28.000 --> 22:33.600
look for a job anyway. I actually was looking already. I was, I had to like start, I was

22:33.600 --> 22:38.640
finishing university in a month. So I didn't really have that much margin or I didn't want

22:38.640 --> 22:49.440
to give me that much margin anyway. So I said, hi, we had a conversation on an IRC channel.

22:49.440 --> 22:54.720
It seemed to work. I did the first project and then we started creating more things and

22:54.720 --> 23:01.520
the team started growing and it was less weird and spotty and it was more like, OK, we're

23:01.520 --> 23:09.720
doing KDE now, which was a very good thing because we hadn't had that many businesses

23:09.720 --> 23:18.000
back then caring about certain parts of our code base. And we definitely had the opportunity

23:18.000 --> 23:21.600
of doing a lot of really cool stuff and we still do.

23:21.600 --> 23:27.760
That's great. And so originally for Blue Systems that you're talking about, what was their

23:27.760 --> 23:34.840
incentive to increase or at least sponsor someone to work on KDE software? Because that

23:34.840 --> 23:40.440
doesn't seem necessarily like the standard approach. So why was that important to them

23:40.440 --> 23:42.600
and why is it still important?

23:42.600 --> 23:52.640
My boss had, has a distribution called Netrunner Linux and he wanted to improve the GTK application

23:52.640 --> 23:58.120
integration. That was my first assignment, actually. He knew he would want more over

23:58.120 --> 24:05.600
time, but that was the first thing we discussed at least. And he had the money to hire me.

24:05.600 --> 24:14.000
So I guess that all of us, if we had like half a million budget every year to get people

24:14.000 --> 24:19.480
to do stuff for us, we would get to be creative in our own ways.

24:19.480 --> 24:25.620
Yeah, you get all your bugs solved pretty quickly if you had that kind of incentive,

24:25.620 --> 24:30.860
let's call it. But that is a really nice way for people to encourage some creativity in

24:30.860 --> 24:37.020
work and to encourage some work on open source software. If they have a need is to sponsor

24:37.020 --> 24:40.400
that work instead of just, for instance, like we were talking about earlier, just sending

24:40.400 --> 24:47.080
a bug tracker out there and hoping for the best. It sounds like sponsoring a specific

24:47.080 --> 24:53.200
project to do a specific something that would help everybody seems like quite the gift really.

24:53.200 --> 24:59.200
I myself feel very lucky that we, that I had or, and we had these, this opportunity and

24:59.200 --> 25:06.960
still do. It's a touchy topic. It's, it's complex because there's a lot of, well, discussions

25:06.960 --> 25:13.280
that come to the table. And I think that one of the best things that BlueSystem has, BlueSystems

25:13.280 --> 25:19.920
has been able to, to push for is that we have been doing a lot of work to just improve Plasma,

25:19.920 --> 25:28.000
improve KD in many ways, but like with, not with a very hands-on kind of way, but just

25:28.000 --> 25:32.960
actually making it better, right. And making it better for everyone. And actually like

25:32.960 --> 25:39.280
a lot of these developments that we did, for example, to improve that runner Linux or some

25:39.280 --> 25:46.400
issues that have been arranged in the past, they have had an impact on, well, on certain

25:46.400 --> 25:52.600
developers, right. Or, or on developments or in, in, in NASA or wherever, right.

25:52.600 --> 25:57.280
A little bit everywhere, but you don't always know where. Can I talk to you a little bit

25:57.280 --> 26:03.520
about conferences? I know maybe that's a touchy subject these days too, but you've been involved

26:03.520 --> 26:10.720
in a few conferences, clearly as an attendee, but also a little bit on the back end. One

26:10.720 --> 26:16.360
of those I believe is the Linux App Summit. You've had your, your thumb in there. You've

26:16.360 --> 26:20.960
been collaborating with some neat people over the years there. Can you tell us a bit about

26:20.960 --> 26:21.960
that?

26:21.960 --> 26:30.320
Yeah, for sure. I was to the Libre App Summit that Nomorganized in Denver a couple of years

26:30.320 --> 26:37.120
ago. Actually, I had started talking to Sri about it for the year earlier where they had

26:37.120 --> 26:38.640
the first one.

26:38.640 --> 26:42.440
Just to mention quickly, that Sri Ramakrishna of Gnome fame. Go on.

26:42.440 --> 26:52.240
It didn't happen in the end because logistics more than better reasons. But the year after

26:52.240 --> 26:59.240
I went there, I talked a lot with him, with Noritzi. I believe, and I am not the only

26:59.240 --> 27:09.720
one to believe that Linux has a lot of value in the end user space to strengthen this value.

27:09.720 --> 27:17.080
You need to make sure that people can join in and collaborate and do it in a platform

27:17.080 --> 27:23.400
level. They don't need to respond to anyone. We can tell everyone, just join KDE and do

27:23.400 --> 27:29.200
your thing. But I don't know, Spotify is not going to do that or Firefox, right? They want

27:29.200 --> 27:36.160
to do their thing and we need to actually be able to work together to offer something

27:36.160 --> 27:38.040
the ones who we are doing it.

27:38.040 --> 27:44.680
So we decided to work more closely and last year we did it together with Gnome. We actually

27:44.680 --> 27:49.920
changed from Libre App Summit to Linux App Summit, which I think it's an interesting

27:49.920 --> 27:58.760
development. In the end, it was a lot about working together. In this case, I also ended

27:58.760 --> 28:07.520
up being the organizer because I've been also doing Barcelona for software, which is the

28:07.520 --> 28:14.000
organization that ended up organizing the event locally, so to speak. So that was my

28:14.000 --> 28:20.200
involvement over there as well, besides doing a bunch of stuff in the organization team.

28:20.200 --> 28:26.560
So it sounds like your previous connections with the group in Barcelona helped with making

28:26.560 --> 28:33.720
this possible and is continuing to help with collaborations throughout, which sounds really

28:33.720 --> 28:38.520
positive, really exciting, and really quite important too.

28:38.520 --> 28:44.200
We're looking into doing 2020 right now. Like you said, it's a bit delicate.

28:44.200 --> 28:46.680
A bit delicate. That's a nice way to put it.

28:46.680 --> 28:54.920
Yeah. But I think that there's a nice chance of doing it properly. Yeah, I'm excited.

28:54.920 --> 28:59.240
Do you feel like, and I know it's early days and you may not know, but I would imagine

28:59.240 --> 29:03.720
that means looking at how to do the conference a little bit differently, maybe with some

29:03.720 --> 29:08.440
different technologies and reaching some different people to make it possible?

29:08.440 --> 29:13.880
We're going to definitely look into the different alternatives. I can say we have a plan A and

29:13.880 --> 29:22.120
a plan B. So we will do our best. I think that there's a lot of value in putting people

29:22.120 --> 29:29.880
together physically. I mean, yeah, they can share viruses then. We don't want to put people

29:29.880 --> 29:36.600
at risk. If we feel that this is the case, then we won't.

29:36.600 --> 29:42.920
And actually, if you think about it a little bit, it's kind of what separates some projects

29:42.920 --> 29:49.360
from others, right? When you get to talk to people, when you get to discuss things over

29:49.360 --> 29:56.600
a meal or a drink, the connection, the interaction that you have is at a different level. And

29:56.600 --> 30:01.560
I think that it's essential to be able to enforce it. We've been doing it at SKD through

30:01.560 --> 30:07.320
our conference, which is called Academy. And every community is doing that and have been

30:07.320 --> 30:14.480
doing it for decades, right? And NumHas, Guadaic, Linux Foundation has a ton of events, Firefox,

30:14.480 --> 30:23.040
Docker, everyone. And it's about bringing people together and making sure that they

30:23.040 --> 30:29.280
humanize their teammates when they do so, which is related to what we were discussing

30:29.280 --> 30:38.240
earlier about empathizing with who you report your problems to. And when working in a community,

30:38.240 --> 30:44.240
well, you have this kind of problem, but 10 times bigger because it's not about somebody

30:44.240 --> 30:50.360
who just had the idea that the problem is solving, but like you're working with somebody

30:50.360 --> 30:57.720
and you need to know what he feels, where he stands in life. And doing it in person

30:57.720 --> 31:00.120
is a whole different deal.

31:00.120 --> 31:05.880
You mentioned Naritzi, who I had a conversation with here on Brunch with Brent, I guess a

31:05.880 --> 31:13.480
few weeks ago. And she mentioned the same thing of how the face-to-face is essential

31:13.480 --> 31:19.240
in the open source communities and anywhere really. And I think you said it really well

31:19.240 --> 31:25.960
when you mentioned humanizing people. I think often maybe that's one side effect of the

31:25.960 --> 31:31.360
beauty that is the internet, which is that sometimes we forget there's a person on the

31:31.360 --> 31:37.280
other side of any message. And so bringing empathy to that and remembering that sounds

31:37.280 --> 31:41.600
really important, but it never really gets communicated in the same way as when you meet

31:41.600 --> 31:47.600
someone in person. So I imagine that will be a continuous challenge for all of us this

31:47.600 --> 31:52.360
year. But hopefully it doesn't impact too much and we can get back to it somehow.

31:52.360 --> 31:58.880
We will have to find alternatives. Ask AD, we have, for example, already canceled a number

31:58.880 --> 32:06.920
of sprints. One of the big things that Ask AD we do is sponsor meeting of the different

32:06.920 --> 32:11.840
teams so that they can discuss, like we said in person, different, more specific topics

32:11.840 --> 32:17.080
that while Academy, they will probably not have the time or even the attention to be

32:17.080 --> 32:22.720
able to look into them, but they're still important, right? And we need to find ways

32:22.720 --> 32:30.280
so that these teams can work together and do things together that they couldn't because,

32:30.280 --> 32:37.960
well, the current state of things because coronavirus. So it's not to disregard the

32:37.960 --> 32:43.640
alternatives and we will have to invest in them. And actually there's a lot to win, like

32:43.640 --> 32:48.880
not only because of infections, but well, for example, for climate, right? Like it's

32:48.880 --> 32:56.880
not very healthy to be flying people all around the world, well, yearly or monthly, right?

32:56.880 --> 32:59.280
Maybe we can do better there. I don't know.

32:59.280 --> 33:04.780
Hmm. So it allows us in a way to pause and look at what we were doing and see the benefits

33:04.780 --> 33:09.840
of it, but also the challenges sounds like there's an opportunity here.

33:09.840 --> 33:16.760
Telecommunication is inherently rather cold. Like if we were having this conversation we're

33:16.760 --> 33:22.800
having right now in texts, it would be probably, well, more boring.

33:22.800 --> 33:24.920
Very different.

33:24.920 --> 33:30.400
And it's still telematic, right? But for example, I have this friend, like he has been doing

33:30.400 --> 33:36.440
KD since long time and everybody, when he meets him for the first time, they say, you're

33:36.440 --> 33:45.120
much nicer than I expected you to be, right? And he's a super nice person. Well, emails,

33:45.120 --> 33:51.600
chats can be cold over time. And especially when people are trying to like do good and

33:51.600 --> 33:56.040
sometimes you have to say no to people, right? And to tell them this thing you really wanted

33:56.040 --> 34:01.720
to do and you were excited about and you even spend some hours this, this, no, right?

34:01.720 --> 34:10.200
Yeah, I find, you know, one thing that's been suggested is to increase the number of, and

34:10.200 --> 34:16.080
Heather, who I had a chat with as well, who's a friend of yours, Heather Ellsworth, she

34:16.080 --> 34:21.080
mentioned increasing the number of coffee chats that she does. And those are kind of

34:21.080 --> 34:26.640
the at a distance voice or video chats you can do with people around the world that you

34:26.640 --> 34:35.000
know. And I know that that seems inefficient, you know, voice and chatting in real time

34:35.000 --> 34:40.800
is sort of inefficient. If you look at the flow of information compared to text, for

34:40.800 --> 34:46.840
instance, because you both have to be in the same place at the same time. And some people,

34:46.840 --> 34:52.500
you know, maybe conversations just, just take a little longer, but I really feel, and that's

34:52.500 --> 34:57.880
sort of the crux of these conversations that we're recording right now, but they're so

34:57.880 --> 35:05.520
valuable and, and we're not looking for purely just information transfer. There's connection,

35:05.520 --> 35:12.160
there is empathy that gets improved. There's like, you end up diving into topics that you

35:12.160 --> 35:17.880
otherwise never would have imagined you'd connect on. So I would encourage everyone

35:17.880 --> 35:24.040
to see if you can do that, reach out to some people and connect via voice, you know, where

35:24.040 --> 35:28.520
there's so much software to do it. So that, that seems like we could all benefit from

35:28.520 --> 35:29.520
that.

35:29.520 --> 35:32.120
I agree. I completely agree.

35:32.120 --> 35:37.920
Can I ask you a question if you have anything that you would like to send out to the community?

35:37.920 --> 35:42.800
Maybe an ask of the community, something you'd like them to try or go see something to think

35:42.800 --> 35:43.800
about?

35:43.800 --> 35:49.280
In general, I would recommend everyone to think about, especially when thinking about

35:49.280 --> 35:57.280
free software, where they fit and try to see if they are doing what they wanted to do,

35:57.280 --> 36:05.280
right? Like if what you want to do is for example, be a user, are you treating the like

36:05.280 --> 36:11.920
the developers in the bug reports, like, like you expected? What do you think that the others

36:11.920 --> 36:18.160
will be getting from your interaction from them? Or should they? Something that happens

36:18.160 --> 36:24.240
often is users knowing that their problems are important, they assume that everybody

36:24.240 --> 36:31.160
knows that the problem is happening, right? But that's always not the case. So if you

36:31.160 --> 36:36.000
want this problem solved, well, don't get the anger bottled up inside of yourself and

36:36.000 --> 36:45.480
well, get it out with control and a smile on your face or fingertips. If your position

36:45.480 --> 36:52.880
in the community, for example, is to do outreach, for example, well, be mindful of what your

36:52.880 --> 37:00.560
reach actually is. Something I found very interesting from my involvement, for example,

37:00.560 --> 37:08.520
in personal software is that we have been doing a lot of vertical, so to speak, outreach,

37:08.520 --> 37:15.320
like in KDE, we do a lot of stuff like worldwide, right? And Nome does and Linux Foundation

37:15.320 --> 37:22.400
does and LibreOffice. But at the local level, it's like a whole different dimension and

37:22.400 --> 37:28.720
a lot of the things we do, while it might be reaching, well, thousands of people, it

37:28.720 --> 37:36.240
doesn't reach the people locally because, well, thousands actually in the world scale

37:36.240 --> 37:47.780
is tiny. So I think that thinking in terms of what is the local impact of free software,

37:47.780 --> 37:53.920
it's interesting and it's something that all of us, we can do a little bit more of. I have

37:53.920 --> 38:00.440
personally looked at this as a two-dimension kind of thing. It's important to be able to

38:00.440 --> 38:06.260
create great products that are free software, but then you also need to go locally to people

38:06.260 --> 38:11.000
and see what they need and offer it to them. And actually, that's why we ended up creating

38:11.000 --> 38:15.600
a personal office software. And I believe that every city should have their own city

38:15.600 --> 38:23.040
free software, right? Because each city council, how are you going to reach each, well, company

38:23.040 --> 38:24.040
doing software?

38:24.040 --> 38:29.080
Yeah. Tell me a little bit more about Barcelona Free Software. We didn't quite touch on it

38:29.080 --> 38:36.040
earlier, but it sounds like it's a nice local community that is really beneficial for you.

38:36.040 --> 38:42.120
A few years ago, we started with actually KDE Spain. I started in KDE Spain when I was

38:42.120 --> 38:47.200
just starting in KDE because somebody said, we're creating this thing. Are you in? And

38:47.200 --> 38:52.800
I said, sure. I actually was not really sure what I was getting into.

38:52.800 --> 38:55.200
Those are the best things.

38:55.200 --> 39:04.240
It was quite interesting to think of the organizational problems that free software has, but at a

39:04.240 --> 39:13.040
different scale. I was there on the board for eight years. I was the president for four.

39:13.040 --> 39:20.280
And then I went to the KDEV, which I had the impression that it would feel more like I'm

39:20.280 --> 39:27.880
doing the same, but at a higher level, if you wish. And then we had quite a bit of people

39:27.880 --> 39:33.840
from KDE Spain doing things in Barcelona. So we said, how about we do something like

39:33.840 --> 39:41.960
KDE Barcelona, which felt a bit wrong and oddly specific. So yeah, we said, let's do

39:41.960 --> 39:47.640
Barcelona Free Software. Let's talk to the people. We knew that people had been doing

39:47.640 --> 39:55.960
free software in my country, in Catalonia at large, if you want, for more since forever.

39:55.960 --> 40:02.200
But we didn't have these personal humanized interaction with them. We knew where to find

40:02.200 --> 40:07.440
them, that there are different organizations. But it doesn't make a lot of sense that I

40:07.440 --> 40:12.820
had been doing free software for 10 years and people around us didn't know me, didn't

40:12.820 --> 40:20.920
know us, or that it was happening. So we started doing a monthly meetup, which we've been doing

40:20.920 --> 40:26.720
since with different projects. Actually, one would think, well, projects are going to finish

40:26.720 --> 40:32.860
one day or another, but they really don't. They have a to-do list of 20 possible talks

40:32.860 --> 40:39.200
that we could be doing, and it doesn't really seem to end. And it does give me some very

40:39.200 --> 40:49.400
interesting other perspective of free software. How do all these really supposedly great advantages

40:49.400 --> 40:57.680
that we're putting on the table affect the people? We did have very open source prone

40:57.680 --> 41:03.960
government in Barcelona, specifically in the city council. And we did get to talk to quite

41:03.960 --> 41:11.360
a bit of politicians. And we got to hear the things that we wanted to hear, and then we

41:11.360 --> 41:17.240
got to not hear the things we wanted to hear, which was a bit disappointing in the end.

41:17.240 --> 41:21.000
But yeah, we were there, and we did our best.

41:21.000 --> 41:28.120
But it sounds like those are the efforts to try to share free and open source software

41:28.120 --> 41:33.940
that you can only do on the ground talking to people. If you're trying to reach counselors

41:33.940 --> 41:40.600
and things via the internet, it's definitely not as powerful. And you don't get that feedback

41:40.600 --> 41:43.560
as well. So yeah, that sounds really important.

41:43.560 --> 41:49.800
The interesting thing is to actually end up talking to the engineer in the different organizations,

41:49.800 --> 41:55.640
right? You can talk to the politician, and he will talk to you about commitments and

41:55.640 --> 42:01.720
about how it's impossible to do or not, or even they want to do it. For example, in the

42:01.720 --> 42:07.920
city council case, what I got in the end was the engineers telling me, oh, the politicians,

42:07.920 --> 42:13.800
they are keeping us from doing this whole Linux thing, but it's awesome. And on the

42:13.800 --> 42:15.240
other hand, I was talking to politicians.

42:15.240 --> 42:20.000
So I was talking to the engineers at SKD because they were using Plasma on their systems. And

42:20.000 --> 42:26.600
I found one of the engineers that reported about report, and I sent him an email, and

42:26.600 --> 42:33.400
I went all the way as, well, the vice president back then. But I was also the coordinator

42:33.400 --> 42:37.600
of personal office software, and I was in touch with the politicians. And the politicians

42:37.600 --> 42:41.640
were telling me, oh, yeah, the engineers, I mean, we tell them to go Linux, but they

42:41.640 --> 42:49.440
give us all of these problems that it was frustrating because they were blaming each

42:49.440 --> 42:50.440
other.

42:50.440 --> 42:56.400
And the only conclusion was that, well, nobody did anything. Or I mean, they did something

42:56.400 --> 42:59.360
things, just not the things I hoped for.

42:59.360 --> 43:02.280
That sounds like a communication problem, right?

43:02.280 --> 43:05.440
Communication is expensive, like you said.

43:05.440 --> 43:11.080
Well, Aleš, thank you so much for joining me. If people wanted to get in contact with

43:11.080 --> 43:12.080
you, where would they reach you?

43:12.080 --> 43:17.280
You can reach me in my email, for example. It's Aleš Paul. I would say you write it

43:17.280 --> 43:21.880
as you hear it, but if you're an English speaker, that doesn't apply.

43:21.880 --> 43:22.880
Yes.

43:22.880 --> 43:26.160
I guess you can put it in the description or something.

43:26.160 --> 43:30.320
Yeah, it's definitely in the show notes, for sure. We'll share it there.

43:30.320 --> 43:39.240
My name and my family name, at kd.org. It's the same on Twitter, on, I don't know, Facebook,

43:39.240 --> 43:44.000
LinkedIn. I don't really use these that much anymore, but they're there.

43:44.000 --> 43:48.080
Well, thank you so much for joining me. I really appreciated this conversation.

43:48.080 --> 43:53.160
Yeah, thank you for having me and for the talk. It was really nice.

43:53.160 --> 43:56.680
Yeah, let's chat again soon.
