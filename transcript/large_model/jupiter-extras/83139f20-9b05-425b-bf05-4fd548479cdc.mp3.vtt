WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:06.280
We've got together on the live stream today to really put Brent to the test.

00:06.280 --> 00:13.640
He's in the studio, and if he can get all the way to $32,000, he will earn 1,000 Satoshis.

00:13.640 --> 00:17.960
Brent, are you ready to become a Linux millionaire?

00:17.960 --> 00:18.960
I'm sweating already.

00:18.960 --> 00:20.240
I think that's a good sign.

00:20.240 --> 00:23.720
Now, none of these questions have anything to do with Linux, but we're still going to

00:23.720 --> 00:27.960
have fun.

00:27.960 --> 00:28.960
Welcome in, Brent.

00:28.960 --> 00:30.240
Good to have you here.

00:30.240 --> 00:31.240
Thank you.

00:31.240 --> 00:32.240
This seat feels hot.

00:32.240 --> 00:33.240
Did you turn it up?

00:33.240 --> 00:34.240
Yeah.

00:34.240 --> 00:35.300
We definitely have the seat turned up when you're in here.

00:35.300 --> 00:39.560
It's just part of the intensity of it, you know, to get you really kind of in the zone,

00:39.560 --> 00:40.560
get you stressed out.

00:40.560 --> 00:41.560
Thank you.

00:41.560 --> 00:43.200
Plus, the sweating looks really good on camera.

00:43.200 --> 00:44.200
It's the shine.

00:44.200 --> 00:45.200
Yeah.

00:45.200 --> 00:46.680
So, you're in from out of town.

00:46.680 --> 00:49.040
Let's see, where are you from there, Brent?

00:49.040 --> 00:51.040
Well, there's a place north.

00:51.040 --> 00:52.040
You may have heard of it.

00:52.040 --> 00:53.040
Canada?

00:53.040 --> 00:54.040
Yeah, the land of the snow.

00:54.040 --> 00:55.040
Yeah.

00:55.040 --> 00:56.040
Yeah.

00:56.040 --> 00:57.040
It's a little colder there.

00:57.040 --> 00:58.040
So, Brent's in from out of town.

00:58.040 --> 01:01.680
He crossed many borders many times to be here.

01:01.680 --> 01:02.680
Did I ever?

01:02.680 --> 01:03.680
Took the long way, I think.

01:03.680 --> 01:05.440
Do you have any friends or family listening today, Brent?

01:05.440 --> 01:08.720
Oh, I don't know if I do, but if I do, I'll give a wave.

01:08.720 --> 01:09.880
Yeah, give them a shout out for us.

01:09.880 --> 01:10.880
I'm waving.

01:10.880 --> 01:11.880
They can't see.

01:11.880 --> 01:14.560
Yeah, you let them know that you're here and that you acknowledge them and that you appreciate

01:14.560 --> 01:15.560
them being here, okay?

01:15.560 --> 01:20.080
Yeah, I think my mom actually is tuning in from a snowy, snowy cabin.

01:20.080 --> 01:21.080
Good.

01:21.080 --> 01:22.080
Everybody say hello to Brent's mom.

01:22.080 --> 01:23.080
Hi, mom.

01:23.080 --> 01:24.080
Hi, Brent's mom.

01:24.080 --> 01:25.080
Thank you for joining us today.

01:25.080 --> 01:30.960
So, Brent, if you win the 1,000 satoshis, what are you going to do with them?

01:30.960 --> 01:35.440
Well, I'm trying to wrap my head around exactly how much they're worth.

01:35.440 --> 01:38.040
At this point, I haven't got a good sense of that.

01:38.040 --> 01:39.520
It sounds like a heck of a lot.

01:39.520 --> 01:40.520
It does.

01:40.520 --> 01:41.520
I'll tell you what.

01:41.520 --> 01:43.640
As a little treat, if you win them at the end, I'll tell you how much it is.

01:43.640 --> 01:44.640
What do you say?

01:44.640 --> 01:45.640
You want to do that?

01:45.640 --> 01:46.640
Yeah, that sounds fun.

01:46.640 --> 01:49.720
1,000 satoshis to you or the cause of your choice.

01:49.720 --> 01:50.720
Oh, wow.

01:50.720 --> 01:52.640
Brent, are you ready to try to become a Linux millionaire?

01:52.640 --> 01:53.640
I'm ready.

01:53.640 --> 02:05.640
Okay, Brent, which of these subjects is taught at a graduate school informally, known as

02:05.640 --> 02:16.000
B school, A, business, B, Bible studies, C, biology, or D, basketball?

02:16.000 --> 02:24.680
Which of these subjects is taught at a graduate school informally, known as B school, Bible

02:24.680 --> 02:27.580
studies, business, biology, or basketball?

02:27.580 --> 02:29.840
The first question is supposed to be easy, right?

02:29.840 --> 02:30.840
Yeah, it is.

02:30.840 --> 02:31.840
It is.

02:31.840 --> 02:34.840
If I get this wrong, do I get a second chance?

02:34.840 --> 02:35.840
No.

02:35.840 --> 02:36.840
Yeah, listen.

02:36.840 --> 02:41.980
You got to figure this is the first question, right?

02:41.980 --> 02:45.320
So they probably are going to make it pretty easy, right?

02:45.320 --> 02:48.960
So you could probably think the most obvious answer is probably that one, right?

02:48.960 --> 02:50.080
You don't know the answers, though.

02:50.080 --> 02:51.320
I can't tell you if I do or not.

02:51.320 --> 02:52.320
All right.

02:52.320 --> 02:53.320
I can't tell you.

02:53.320 --> 02:59.600
But I can tell you it'd be horribly embarrassing to lose at this stage.

02:59.600 --> 03:04.280
Well, the one that seems the most obvious to me would be basketball because the others

03:04.280 --> 03:08.280
seem like, no, I don't want to say anything bad about basketball.

03:08.280 --> 03:09.280
Taught at a graduate school.

03:09.280 --> 03:10.280
Mm-hmm.

03:10.280 --> 03:11.280
So graduate school fields.

03:11.280 --> 03:13.000
Informally known as B school.

03:13.000 --> 03:15.160
Oh, I misunderstood this.

03:15.160 --> 03:16.160
Oh, oh, oh.

03:16.160 --> 03:17.160
I don't know.

03:17.160 --> 03:20.840
I'm not saying either way, but I'm just saying that's it.

03:20.840 --> 03:26.400
Which of these subjects is taught at a graduate school, informally known as B school?

03:26.400 --> 03:27.400
Oh, got it.

03:27.400 --> 03:28.400
Got it.

03:28.400 --> 03:29.400
Got it.

03:29.400 --> 03:30.400
I misunderstood the question the first time around.

03:30.400 --> 03:31.400
I'm glad we did this.

03:31.400 --> 03:32.400
Well, it's all in the cases, really.

03:32.400 --> 03:33.400
Yeah.

03:33.400 --> 03:34.400
Yeah, thanks.

03:34.400 --> 03:35.400
I don't know if that really changes anything for you, though.

03:35.400 --> 03:36.400
Well, I'm going to not go with basketball.

03:36.400 --> 03:37.400
I think it's now the worst answer.

03:37.400 --> 03:38.400
Okay.

03:38.400 --> 03:39.400
All right.

03:39.400 --> 03:40.400
Okay.

03:40.400 --> 03:41.400
That's a big shift.

03:41.400 --> 03:42.400
It's exactly opposite, actually.

03:42.400 --> 03:43.400
Yeah.

03:43.400 --> 03:44.400
Okay.

03:44.400 --> 03:45.400
Yeah.

03:45.400 --> 03:46.400
It's a big shift of business.

03:46.400 --> 03:47.400
All right.

03:47.400 --> 03:48.400
Final answer?

03:48.400 --> 03:49.400
Yeah.

03:49.400 --> 03:50.400
Let's go for it.

03:50.400 --> 03:51.400
All right.

03:51.400 --> 03:52.400
Let's see what we say.

03:52.400 --> 03:53.400
Locking it in.

03:53.400 --> 03:54.400
And survey says...

03:54.400 --> 03:55.400
You got it right, Brent.

03:55.400 --> 03:56.400
Nicely done.

03:56.400 --> 03:57.400
Nicely done.

03:57.400 --> 03:58.400
I almost sunk it there.

03:58.400 --> 03:59.400
What does that say about MBAs?

03:59.400 --> 04:00.400
You know, B school?

04:00.400 --> 04:01.400
Not very creative.

04:01.400 --> 04:02.400
Oh, Wes.

04:02.400 --> 04:03.400
Wes is here.

04:03.400 --> 04:13.840
He'll be our emergency call a friend and also color commentary, as you can tell.

04:13.840 --> 04:15.560
Are you ready to continue, Brent?

04:15.560 --> 04:16.560
Yes.

04:16.560 --> 04:17.560
Wait, wait, wait.

04:17.560 --> 04:18.560
What am I at?

04:18.560 --> 04:19.560
$200.

04:19.560 --> 04:20.560
Oh, okay.

04:20.560 --> 04:23.560
We don't really fret about that at the beginning, Brent.

04:23.560 --> 04:24.560
Oh, sorry.

04:24.560 --> 04:25.560
Yeah.

04:25.560 --> 04:26.560
I know.

04:26.560 --> 04:27.560
Wait.

04:27.560 --> 04:28.560
You said dollars.

04:28.560 --> 04:29.560
Yeah.

04:29.560 --> 04:30.560
$200.

04:30.560 --> 04:31.560
Yeah.

04:31.560 --> 04:32.560
Dollars.

04:32.560 --> 04:33.560
You got to get to...

04:33.560 --> 04:34.560
When you get to $32,000 to get to Satoshi...

04:34.560 --> 04:35.560
I know.

04:35.560 --> 04:36.560
It's very confusing.

04:36.560 --> 04:37.560
You got to earn the dollars to get the SATs.

04:37.560 --> 04:38.560
Okay.

04:38.560 --> 04:39.560
Okay.

04:39.560 --> 04:40.560
Okay.

04:40.560 --> 04:41.560
According to a popular saying...

04:41.560 --> 04:42.560
Although now the timer is going.

04:42.560 --> 04:43.560
It's all a mess.

04:43.560 --> 04:46.120
According to a popular saying about hot tropical weather, it's not the heat.

04:46.120 --> 04:47.120
It's the what?

04:47.120 --> 04:49.400
Humidity, rash, cold, or fuzz?

04:49.400 --> 04:50.400
Humidity.

04:50.400 --> 04:51.400
Final answer?

04:51.400 --> 04:52.400
Yeah, go for it.

04:52.400 --> 04:53.400
All right.

04:53.400 --> 04:54.400
I like your confidence there, buddy.

04:54.400 --> 04:55.400
Survey says...

04:55.400 --> 04:56.400
All right.

04:56.400 --> 04:57.400
Nicely done, Brent.

04:57.400 --> 04:58.400
Thank you.

04:58.400 --> 04:59.400
Under pressure.

04:59.400 --> 05:00.400
15 seconds.

05:00.400 --> 05:01.400
All right, Brent.

05:01.400 --> 05:06.320
Which of these terms is used for the most luxurious section of accommodations on an

05:06.320 --> 05:09.600
airplane, on a ship, or on a train?

05:09.600 --> 05:15.360
The psychology class, first class, Ritz class, or alpha class?

05:15.360 --> 05:17.840
This should have been question one.

05:17.840 --> 05:19.480
I think it's first class.

05:19.480 --> 05:20.480
All right.

05:20.480 --> 05:21.480
No, no.

05:21.480 --> 05:22.480
I know it's first class.

05:22.480 --> 05:25.760
You know, I got to say, I prefer alpha class.

05:25.760 --> 05:26.760
Well...

05:26.760 --> 05:27.920
I'd like an alpha class seat, please.

05:27.920 --> 05:28.920
That's the future.

05:28.920 --> 05:29.920
We're not there yet.

05:29.920 --> 05:30.920
Okay.

05:30.920 --> 05:31.920
All right.

05:31.920 --> 05:32.920
So you're just going to boldly say B, first class?

05:32.920 --> 05:33.920
Sure.

05:33.920 --> 05:34.920
All right.

05:34.920 --> 05:35.920
Here we go.

05:35.920 --> 05:40.040
Attention.

05:40.040 --> 05:41.040
You got it, Brent.

05:41.040 --> 05:42.040
Thank you.

05:42.040 --> 05:43.040
You got it.

05:43.040 --> 05:44.040
Good job.

05:44.040 --> 05:45.040
All right.

05:45.040 --> 05:46.880
Now for $500.

05:46.880 --> 05:53.400
Which of these is not one of the Energizer Bunny's primary characteristics?

05:53.400 --> 05:57.080
I'm trying to read it without laughing, dude.

05:57.080 --> 06:03.440
Which of these is not one of the Energizer Bunny's primary characteristics?

06:03.440 --> 06:04.440
Okay.

06:04.440 --> 06:05.440
He carries a bass drum.

06:05.440 --> 06:06.440
Yes.

06:06.440 --> 06:13.960
He has a buck teeth, wears sunglasses, wears sandals.

06:13.960 --> 06:17.200
Not one of his primary characteristics.

06:17.200 --> 06:24.000
A bass drum, buck teeth, sunglasses, or sandals.

06:24.000 --> 06:26.200
I'm going to go with buck teeth.

06:26.200 --> 06:27.200
All right.

06:27.200 --> 06:28.200
Buck teeth.

06:28.200 --> 06:29.200
Final answer?

06:29.200 --> 06:33.800
Final answer.

06:33.800 --> 06:34.800
You got it, dude.

06:34.800 --> 06:35.800
I know.

06:35.800 --> 06:36.800
I wasn't sure about the sandals.

06:36.800 --> 06:37.800
I wasn't either.

06:37.800 --> 06:38.800
I have to be honest.

06:38.800 --> 06:39.800
All right.

06:39.800 --> 06:46.240
You're now at $1,000, halfway to earning 1,000 Satoshis.

06:46.240 --> 06:47.840
Only a few questions left.

06:47.840 --> 06:49.400
What happens if I go above 32?

06:49.400 --> 06:51.080
Well, then we'll have to figure that out.

06:51.080 --> 06:52.080
Okay.

06:52.080 --> 06:53.080
Okay.

06:53.080 --> 06:54.080
Maybe you will.

06:54.080 --> 06:55.080
Maybe you're in 2,000.

06:55.080 --> 06:59.600
Which of these shapes also fits the common definition of a rectangle, a circle, an ellipse,

06:59.600 --> 07:02.380
a square, or a triangle?

07:02.380 --> 07:12.120
The common definition of a rectangle, circle, eclipse, square, or triangle?

07:12.120 --> 07:14.720
I think they must be saying ellipse.

07:14.720 --> 07:15.720
What did I say?

07:15.720 --> 07:16.720
Eclipse.

07:16.720 --> 07:17.720
It's almost the same thing.

07:17.720 --> 07:18.720
Oh, jeez.

07:18.720 --> 07:19.720
Oh, yeah.

07:19.720 --> 07:20.720
Obviously.

07:20.720 --> 07:21.720
Did I say eclipse both times?

07:21.720 --> 07:22.720
I don't know.

07:22.720 --> 07:23.720
I don't think so.

07:23.720 --> 07:24.720
Let's say you didn't.

07:24.720 --> 07:25.720
Okay.

07:25.720 --> 07:26.720
I'm going to go with a square.

07:26.720 --> 07:27.720
A square?

07:27.720 --> 07:28.720
Similar shape.

07:28.720 --> 07:29.720
All right.

07:29.720 --> 07:30.720
Final answer?

07:30.720 --> 07:31.720
Yes, please.

07:31.720 --> 07:32.720
You got it.

07:32.720 --> 07:33.720
Oh, man.

07:33.720 --> 07:34.720
Almost had me there.

07:34.720 --> 07:35.720
I'm sorry.

07:35.720 --> 07:36.720
I'm sorry.

07:36.720 --> 07:45.440
It's a little too early for me to read, apparently.

07:45.440 --> 07:53.720
What continent is closest to Antarctica, Africa, Asia, Australia, or South America?

07:53.720 --> 07:56.880
Closest to Antarctica?

07:56.880 --> 08:05.840
I believe there are penguins in Argentina, so I'm going to say South America.

08:05.840 --> 08:07.560
D final answer?

08:07.560 --> 08:08.560
I think so.

08:08.560 --> 08:09.560
Yeah.

08:09.560 --> 08:10.560
Let's go for it.

08:10.560 --> 08:11.560
All right.

08:11.560 --> 08:12.560
Submitting to the computer.

08:12.560 --> 08:13.560
And survey says...

08:13.560 --> 08:16.560
You got it right, Brent.

08:16.560 --> 08:17.560
Nice.

08:17.560 --> 08:18.560
Nicely done.

08:18.560 --> 08:19.560
Thank you.

08:19.560 --> 08:20.980
Now for $4,000.

08:20.980 --> 08:24.120
Just a few away from those sweet, sweet sads.

08:24.120 --> 08:31.440
In 1981, the movie Chariots of Fire, in that movie, one athlete refuses to compete for

08:31.440 --> 08:40.120
religious reasons on what day of the week, Thursday, Sunday, Friday, or Saturday.

08:40.120 --> 08:41.720
You do have a couple of lifelines here.

08:41.720 --> 08:42.720
Thank you.

08:42.720 --> 08:48.120
You got the 50-50, you got the phone a friend, and you got the audience survey.

08:48.120 --> 08:49.800
I'd like to go with the audience survey here.

08:49.800 --> 08:50.800
All right.

08:50.800 --> 08:51.800
Let's do it.

08:51.800 --> 08:56.080
We're going to stop and we're going to ask the audience, okay, Brent, here's what we

08:56.080 --> 08:57.680
got coming in from them.

08:57.680 --> 09:03.840
Coming in right now, it looks like 61% of them say B.

09:03.840 --> 09:05.080
What was B again?

09:05.080 --> 09:07.920
B is Sunday.

09:07.920 --> 09:09.280
That was my inclination.

09:09.280 --> 09:10.600
Eight seconds.

09:10.600 --> 09:11.600
Let's go with Sunday.

09:11.600 --> 09:12.600
All right.

09:12.600 --> 09:13.600
Final answer?

09:13.600 --> 09:16.720
Sunday answer.

09:16.720 --> 09:17.720
You got it, buddy.

09:17.720 --> 09:18.720
Thank you.

09:18.720 --> 09:19.720
Wow.

09:19.720 --> 09:21.040
Thank you to the crab.

09:21.040 --> 09:23.400
I did not know that one.

09:23.400 --> 09:24.980
All right.

09:24.980 --> 09:29.600
The Puget Sound is located in what US state?

09:29.600 --> 09:37.820
Alaska, Washington, Massachusetts, or Maine?

09:37.820 --> 09:41.320
You will be kicked out of the studio if you get this wrong, Brent.

09:41.320 --> 09:46.600
Is that a hint?

09:46.600 --> 09:51.360
I think I should do a 50-50.

09:51.360 --> 09:52.360
Okay.

09:52.360 --> 09:53.360
All right.

09:53.360 --> 09:56.920
We are going to take away two wrong answers from the board.

09:56.920 --> 10:00.760
Massachusetts and Washington remain on the board.

10:00.760 --> 10:02.680
Washington or the nuts.

10:02.680 --> 10:04.840
Which one is the Puget Sound located in?

10:04.840 --> 10:06.400
I'm going to go with Washington.

10:06.400 --> 10:07.400
Final answer?

10:07.400 --> 10:08.400
Final.

10:08.400 --> 10:09.400
All right.

10:09.400 --> 10:10.400
Let's lock it in.

10:10.400 --> 10:11.400
All right.

10:11.400 --> 10:12.400
Yes.

10:12.400 --> 10:18.320
Okay, Brent.

10:18.320 --> 10:23.160
One away from 32,000 and unlocking 1,000 SATs.

10:23.160 --> 10:24.760
And I still have a West.

10:24.760 --> 10:30.840
The state of Montana derives its name from a Latin word meaning what?

10:30.840 --> 10:35.720
Northern, snowy, mountainous, or vast?

10:35.720 --> 10:36.720
I'm going to go with mountainous.

10:36.720 --> 10:37.720
Wow.

10:37.720 --> 10:38.720
You're just down.

10:38.720 --> 10:39.720
Ready?

10:39.720 --> 10:40.720
It's the Canadian French that's helping me out.

10:40.720 --> 10:41.720
Okay.

10:41.720 --> 10:42.720
Final answer then.

10:42.720 --> 10:43.720
Yeah.

10:43.720 --> 10:44.720
Go for it.

10:44.720 --> 10:45.720
All right.

10:45.720 --> 10:46.720
Locking her in.

10:46.720 --> 10:47.720
Oh, you got it.

10:47.720 --> 10:48.720
Nicely done, sir.

10:48.720 --> 10:49.720
All right.

10:49.720 --> 10:52.600
Now, get this one right and you get 1,000 SATs.

10:52.600 --> 10:58.040
For $32,000, a brown recluse is what kind of creature?

10:58.040 --> 11:05.560
A spider, a snake, a bird, or a fish?

11:05.560 --> 11:06.880
I'm going to call a West on this one.

11:06.880 --> 11:08.080
Oh, you want to phone a friend.

11:08.080 --> 11:09.080
Very good.

11:09.080 --> 11:12.680
Mr. Payne, we're going to dial you up here.

11:12.680 --> 11:16.320
And we'd like to know what you think a brown recluse is.

11:16.320 --> 11:17.320
You got 30 seconds.

11:17.320 --> 11:19.960
I do not have a sound effect for dialing me up.

11:19.960 --> 11:20.960
Oh, yeah.

11:20.960 --> 11:21.960
This is it right here.

11:21.960 --> 11:22.960
Ready?

11:22.960 --> 11:23.960
Starting now.

11:23.960 --> 11:27.900
A spider, a snake, a bird, or a fish?

11:27.900 --> 11:28.900
Can I talk to West?

11:28.900 --> 11:29.900
Yeah.

11:29.900 --> 11:32.320
West, I'm leaning to the legged one.

11:32.320 --> 11:33.320
Yeah.

11:33.320 --> 11:36.360
No, I think I'm familiar with these.

11:36.360 --> 11:37.360
Let's go spider.

11:37.360 --> 11:38.360
Yeah.

11:38.360 --> 11:39.360
Because they have caves and stuff.

11:39.360 --> 11:40.360
Yeah.

11:40.360 --> 11:41.360
Final answer.

11:41.360 --> 11:42.360
Yeah.

11:42.360 --> 11:43.360
West and I.

11:43.360 --> 11:44.360
Lock it in?

11:44.360 --> 11:45.360
Do it.

11:45.360 --> 11:46.360
Five seconds left.

11:46.360 --> 11:47.360
Locking it in.

11:47.360 --> 11:48.360
Do it.

11:48.360 --> 11:49.360
Do it.

11:49.360 --> 11:50.360
Do it.

11:50.360 --> 11:51.360
All right.

11:51.360 --> 11:52.360
And you got it, Brent.

11:52.360 --> 11:53.360
Nice.

11:53.360 --> 11:54.360
Thank you, West.

11:54.360 --> 11:55.360
Nicely done.

11:55.360 --> 11:56.360
I think they're even here in Washington.

11:56.360 --> 11:57.360
So watch out.

11:57.360 --> 11:58.360
Now you're on a roll, Brent.

11:58.360 --> 11:59.360
You've just secured 1,000 SATs.

11:59.360 --> 12:00.360
You get these right.

12:00.360 --> 12:01.360
I think we're going to do 2,000 if you can get to a million.

12:01.360 --> 12:02.360
Here we go.

12:02.360 --> 12:03.360
All right.

12:03.360 --> 12:15.480
Weston Bernstrand is a 1981 book, the breaks of the game is an account of a team in what

12:15.480 --> 12:16.880
professional sport league?

12:16.880 --> 12:17.880
Okay.

12:17.880 --> 12:22.680
So David's book in 1981, the breaks of the game is an account of a team in what professional

12:22.680 --> 12:23.680
sport league?

12:23.680 --> 12:29.720
In the NBA, the NHL, MLB, or the NFL?

12:29.720 --> 12:30.720
You can ask the Mubaroo.

12:30.720 --> 12:31.720
Maybe the Mubaroo.

12:31.720 --> 12:32.720
Please help me.

12:32.720 --> 12:33.720
We've got a freebie here for Brent.

12:33.720 --> 12:34.720
This will be the moment.

12:34.720 --> 12:35.720
We've got, what, 18 seconds?

12:35.720 --> 12:39.120
I feel like Brent should get a translation of what those league names are to the sports.

12:39.120 --> 12:43.120
MLB, Major League Baseball, NBA is basketball.

12:43.120 --> 12:44.120
Breaks of the game.

12:44.120 --> 12:45.120
Eight seconds.

12:45.120 --> 12:46.120
I'm going to say...

12:46.120 --> 12:47.120
You take it, Chris.

12:47.120 --> 12:48.120
Oh, no.

12:48.120 --> 12:49.120
I don't want to do it.

12:49.120 --> 12:50.120
Do it.

12:50.120 --> 12:51.120
Okay.

12:51.120 --> 12:52.120
Here we go.

12:52.120 --> 12:53.120
A.

12:53.120 --> 12:54.120
Unbelievable.

12:54.120 --> 12:55.120
Oh, no way.

12:55.120 --> 12:56.120
Unbelievable.

12:56.120 --> 12:57.120
Well done.

12:57.120 --> 12:58.120
Wow.

12:58.120 --> 12:59.120
All right.

12:59.120 --> 13:00.120
Moving on.

13:00.120 --> 13:03.440
I don't even know what A was.

13:03.440 --> 13:12.920
For $125,000, which of these substances contain no carbon atoms, dynamite, sugar, rust, or

13:12.920 --> 13:14.320
grain alcohol?

13:14.320 --> 13:16.720
No carbon atoms.

13:16.720 --> 13:29.320
Dynamite, sugar, rust, or grain alcohol?

13:29.320 --> 13:30.880
What was C again?

13:30.880 --> 13:31.880
Rust.

13:31.880 --> 13:34.520
25 seconds.

13:34.520 --> 13:41.440
I'm getting conflicting answers from...

13:41.440 --> 13:42.440
Chat room.

13:42.440 --> 13:43.440
Chat room.

13:43.440 --> 13:46.440
You've got 15 seconds.

13:46.440 --> 13:50.640
Yeah, rust is...

13:50.640 --> 13:53.800
Well, since we love rust so much...

13:53.800 --> 13:54.800
Let's do it.

13:54.800 --> 13:55.800
I think we're going to go with rust.

13:55.800 --> 13:56.800
Oh, my gosh.

13:56.800 --> 13:57.800
Can you handle that?

13:57.800 --> 13:58.800
Let's do it.

13:58.800 --> 13:59.800
Oh, my God.

13:59.800 --> 14:00.800
Two in a row.

14:00.800 --> 14:01.800
Unbelievable.

14:01.800 --> 14:05.560
I think this game is rigged, but I can't quite tell, but I'm okay with it.

14:05.560 --> 14:12.160
For $250,000, who was featured in the 1998 Time Magazine cover with the headline, Is

14:12.160 --> 14:14.280
Feminism Dead?

14:14.280 --> 14:20.880
Martha Stewart, Callista Flockhart, Pamela Anderson-Lee, or the Spice Girls?

14:20.880 --> 14:23.720
1998.

14:23.720 --> 14:25.360
Time Magazine.

14:25.360 --> 14:26.600
Is Feminism Dead?

14:26.600 --> 14:31.640
Martha Stewart, Callista Flockhart, Pamela Anderson-Lee, or the Spice Girls?

14:31.640 --> 14:35.040
Martha Stewart had that big hoopla back then.

14:35.040 --> 14:36.040
She did, yeah.

14:36.040 --> 14:37.480
So I'm going with her.

14:37.480 --> 14:38.760
I think that's a pretty good guess.

14:38.760 --> 14:39.760
She was in the news a lot.

14:39.760 --> 14:40.760
Yeah, it was a big deal.

14:40.760 --> 14:41.760
She went to jail.

14:41.760 --> 14:42.760
She did.

14:42.760 --> 14:43.760
That was crushing.

14:43.760 --> 14:46.200
For stuff that the banks would later do just as a matter of practice and totally not get

14:46.200 --> 14:47.200
in trouble.

14:47.200 --> 14:48.600
Well, I mean, she led the stage.

14:48.600 --> 14:49.600
All right.

14:49.600 --> 14:50.600
So A, final answer?

14:50.600 --> 14:51.600
Yeah, go for it.

14:51.600 --> 14:52.600
All right.

14:52.600 --> 14:53.600
Logging it in.

14:53.600 --> 14:54.600
Oh, no.

14:54.600 --> 14:55.600
No.

14:55.600 --> 14:56.600
Oh, Brantley.

14:56.600 --> 14:57.600
I'm so sorry.

14:57.600 --> 14:58.600
What was the answer?

14:58.600 --> 15:03.600
It was B, but I didn't actually see what it was.

15:03.600 --> 15:04.600
I don't know if anybody caught it.

15:04.600 --> 15:05.600
Callista Flockhart.

15:05.600 --> 15:06.600
Oh, it was Callista Flockhart.

15:06.600 --> 15:07.600
I don't know anything about Callista Flockhart.

15:07.600 --> 15:11.280
Who played Ally McBeal, which is apparently what this image is referring to.

15:11.280 --> 15:12.280
Yeah, okay.

15:12.280 --> 15:13.280
Wow.

15:13.280 --> 15:14.280
You still got a thousand sets, though.

15:14.280 --> 15:15.280
Okay.

15:15.280 --> 15:16.920
But my heart is still sunk in my chest.

15:16.920 --> 15:17.920
Yeah.

15:17.920 --> 15:18.920
Well, 2,000 is better than 1,000.

15:18.920 --> 15:19.920
All right.

15:19.920 --> 15:20.920
Yeah.

15:20.920 --> 15:21.920
Does anybody else want to play?

15:21.920 --> 15:22.920
That was fun.

15:22.920 --> 15:23.920
Thank you.

15:23.920 --> 15:24.920
Mr. Wimpress, would you like to play The Millionaire before we wrap it up?

15:24.920 --> 15:25.920
I think, culturally, I'm going to struggle.

15:25.920 --> 15:26.920
I'll join the club.

15:26.920 --> 15:27.920
It's true.

15:27.920 --> 15:28.920
But you know what?

15:28.920 --> 15:29.920
You are a worldly man, so you may have a better shot than, say, myself, for example.

15:29.920 --> 15:30.920
No, I'll pass.

15:30.920 --> 15:31.920
Thank you for the offer, though.

15:31.920 --> 15:32.920
That's fine.

15:32.920 --> 15:33.920
That's absolutely fine.

15:33.920 --> 15:34.920
Make Wes do it.

15:34.920 --> 15:35.920
Come on.

15:35.920 --> 15:36.920
Yeah, we got to work on Wes.

15:36.920 --> 15:37.920
Wes, you want to do it?

15:37.920 --> 15:38.920
Sure.

15:38.920 --> 15:39.920
Okay.

15:39.920 --> 15:40.920
Well, we'll flip it around, Wes.

15:40.920 --> 15:41.920
And you can phone a Brent if the situation comes up.

15:41.920 --> 15:42.920
Does that sound fair?

15:42.920 --> 15:43.920
Oh, all right.

15:43.920 --> 15:44.920
All right, yeah.

15:44.920 --> 16:02.120
All right, let's do this thing.

16:02.120 --> 16:06.360
Welcome into the show, Wes, a Seattle native, or at least a Washington native now based

16:06.360 --> 16:07.560
in the Seattle area.

16:07.560 --> 16:08.560
You doing good today, Wes?

16:08.560 --> 16:10.120
You got any friends or family watching?

16:10.120 --> 16:14.320
No, they all don't think I could make it here, but I'm going to prove them wrong today.

16:14.320 --> 16:15.320
All right, Wes.

16:15.320 --> 16:17.160
Well, let's kick it off.

16:17.160 --> 16:21.440
Which of these words is often used to describe a very successful movie?

16:21.440 --> 16:27.240
A flamethrower, a blockbuster, a Smash Mouth, or a water world?

16:27.240 --> 16:29.400
This is way easier than your first one, right?

16:29.400 --> 16:31.040
I love the idea that it's a water world.

16:31.040 --> 16:32.040
I know, me too.

16:32.040 --> 16:34.340
Well, water world was one of them, I think.

16:34.340 --> 16:39.440
Water world is historically a financial failure, and yet it's a movie I actually enjoy.

16:39.440 --> 16:42.200
I thought there were some cool ideas in there.

16:42.200 --> 16:43.200
That's true.

16:43.200 --> 16:44.200
That's true.

16:44.200 --> 16:45.200
Blockbuster.

16:45.200 --> 16:46.200
Final answer.

16:46.200 --> 16:47.200
All right.

16:47.200 --> 16:48.200
B. Blockbuster.

16:48.200 --> 16:49.200
Final answer.

16:49.200 --> 16:50.200
Checking the computer.

16:50.200 --> 16:51.200
Yeah.

16:51.200 --> 16:52.760
Yeah, you got that one right, Wes.

16:52.760 --> 16:53.760
Yeah.

16:53.760 --> 16:54.760
I know, right?

16:54.760 --> 16:55.760
Okay.

16:55.760 --> 17:07.040
For $200, if you want someone to stop bothering you, you might ask them to get off your what?

17:07.040 --> 17:08.040
Your sidebar?

17:08.040 --> 17:09.040
Your brief?

17:09.040 --> 17:10.360
Your case?

17:10.360 --> 17:15.100
Or your closing argument?

17:15.100 --> 17:16.720
You want them to get off your what?

17:16.720 --> 17:21.440
A sidebar, a brief, a case, closing argument.

17:21.440 --> 17:24.360
Let's go with case, although, I mean, there's a lot of good options here.

17:24.360 --> 17:26.520
Yeah, I like them all for some reason.

17:26.520 --> 17:30.200
All right, we're doing C, case, and survey says...

17:30.200 --> 17:32.240
Yeah, that's right, Wes.

17:32.240 --> 17:34.000
Okay, here we go.

17:34.000 --> 17:38.040
I'm gonna start saying get off my sidebar, though, so, I mean, it might not work, but

17:38.040 --> 17:39.040
they'll at least be confused for a moment.

17:39.040 --> 17:41.040
Can you just get off my closing argument, please?

17:41.040 --> 17:42.600
How come lawn wasn't part of the options?

17:42.600 --> 17:43.600
I know!

17:43.600 --> 17:44.600
That's what I was expecting.

17:44.600 --> 17:46.600
That's why I started laughing when I read it first.

17:46.600 --> 17:51.280
Okay, Wes, according to a popular phrase, a person who achieves success through others

17:51.280 --> 17:53.320
is riding their what?

17:53.320 --> 17:59.960
A, coattails, B, rickshaw, C, golden goose, or D, sidecar?

17:59.960 --> 18:05.160
Oh, man, rickshaw is a fantastic answer, but no, coattails.

18:05.160 --> 18:06.160
You sure?

18:06.160 --> 18:10.040
I mean, I feel like I've heard a lot of people say that guy's just riding his golden goose.

18:10.040 --> 18:11.040
Yeah.

18:11.040 --> 18:19.680
All right, coattails, locking it in, and we'll see what the computer says.

18:19.680 --> 18:22.720
You got it, Wes, and now we're at $500.

18:22.720 --> 18:25.240
You're one away from a thousand sats.

18:25.240 --> 18:30.840
Which of these terms best describes money set aside to use for improper purposes, like

18:30.840 --> 18:32.960
we're doing right now?

18:32.960 --> 18:39.160
For improper purposes, pension, slush fund, net worth, or margin account?

18:39.160 --> 18:44.600
Okay, well, there's a lot to unpack in margin account and how you want to judge things with

18:44.600 --> 18:48.800
improper there, I think.

18:48.800 --> 18:49.800
But slush fund.

18:49.800 --> 18:50.800
All right, final answer?

18:50.800 --> 18:51.800
Final answer.

18:51.800 --> 18:52.800
Okay, locking it in.

18:52.800 --> 19:00.880
All right, Wes, very nice.

19:00.880 --> 19:03.760
This one gets you the sats.

19:03.760 --> 19:09.080
The plumage of an adult male cardinal is predominantly what color?

19:09.080 --> 19:15.640
Blue, red, yellow, or orange?

19:15.640 --> 19:23.840
The foliage of an adult male cardinal is predominantly what color?

19:23.840 --> 19:24.840
Let's go with red.

19:24.840 --> 19:25.840
All right.

19:25.840 --> 19:26.840
Final answer.

19:26.840 --> 19:27.840
You feeling good?

19:27.840 --> 19:28.840
I like that.

19:28.840 --> 19:29.840
I'm feeling good.

19:29.840 --> 19:30.840
It's an attention catching color, right?

19:30.840 --> 19:31.840
Yeah.

19:31.840 --> 19:32.840
I mean, who wouldn't want to be bright red?

19:32.840 --> 19:33.840
Right.

19:33.840 --> 19:34.840
Locking it in.

19:34.840 --> 19:35.840
There's no bird cops out there to pull you over.

19:35.840 --> 19:39.440
Oh, you got it, Wes.

19:39.440 --> 19:40.720
That means you get the sats.

19:40.720 --> 19:42.280
You get the sats.

19:42.280 --> 19:46.480
I would like to officially donate my sats to the Brent cause.

19:46.480 --> 19:47.480
Whoa.

19:47.480 --> 19:48.480
Wow.

19:48.480 --> 19:50.280
Such a generous gentleman.

19:50.280 --> 19:55.880
All right, Wes, the capital of Nevada is named after whom?

19:55.880 --> 19:57.280
Jedediah Smith?

19:57.280 --> 19:58.760
Kit Carson?

19:58.760 --> 20:00.160
Jesse Lee Reno?

20:00.160 --> 20:02.240
John C. Fremont?

20:02.240 --> 20:03.240
The capital of Nevada?

20:03.240 --> 20:05.760
I feel like Wimpy would know this one.

20:05.760 --> 20:06.760
It's true.

20:06.760 --> 20:09.000
The Mumble Room can always jump in.

20:09.000 --> 20:11.040
You also have a couple of lifelines here.

20:11.040 --> 20:12.480
You got the 50-50.

20:12.480 --> 20:17.000
You got the poll the audience, and you got the call of Brent.

20:17.000 --> 20:18.840
I'm going to go with Kit Carson.

20:18.840 --> 20:19.960
Kit Carson.

20:19.960 --> 20:20.960
I love it.

20:20.960 --> 20:21.960
Makes sense.

20:21.960 --> 20:23.160
Let's lock that sucker in.

20:23.160 --> 20:27.280
B, final answer, and survey says.

20:27.280 --> 20:28.880
I think you knew that one, Wes.

20:28.880 --> 20:29.880
I did.

20:29.880 --> 20:32.200
I mean, I don't know why I know that.

20:32.200 --> 20:33.200
That is close enough, I guess.

20:33.200 --> 20:34.200
Yeah.

20:34.200 --> 20:35.200
You know, they try to get you with that Reno one.

20:35.200 --> 20:36.200
That's true.

20:36.200 --> 20:37.200
Tricky, tricky.

20:37.200 --> 20:38.200
That was.

20:38.200 --> 20:39.200
All right.

20:39.200 --> 20:44.120
For $4,000, which of the following is a common symptom of cerebriolic dermatitis?

20:44.120 --> 20:46.480
I'm sure you know what this is, right?

20:46.480 --> 20:50.760
Baldness, gray hair, split ends, or dandruff?

20:50.760 --> 20:51.760
Okay.

20:51.760 --> 20:52.840
It's something to do with the head, it seems.

20:52.840 --> 20:53.840
So it's cerebriolic.

20:53.840 --> 20:54.840
How do you say that?

20:54.840 --> 20:55.840
Cerebriolic.

20:55.840 --> 20:56.840
Cerebriolic.

20:56.840 --> 20:57.840
Thank you.

20:57.840 --> 20:58.840
Cerebriolic.

20:58.840 --> 20:59.840
Dermatitis.

20:59.840 --> 21:00.840
Cerebriolic.

21:00.840 --> 21:01.840
Dermatitis.

21:01.840 --> 21:02.840
Is it balding?

21:02.840 --> 21:03.840
Is it gray hair?

21:03.840 --> 21:04.840
Is it split ends?

21:04.840 --> 21:05.840
Is it dandruff?

21:05.840 --> 21:06.840
Let's go with the 50-50.

21:06.840 --> 21:07.840
All right.

21:07.840 --> 21:09.440
Eliminating two wrong answers.

21:09.440 --> 21:22.640
And what you have left now, Wes, split ends or dandruff, 17 seconds.

21:22.640 --> 21:23.640
Let's go with dandruff.

21:23.640 --> 21:24.640
All right.

21:24.640 --> 21:25.640
Here we go.

21:25.640 --> 21:29.120
It was tense.

21:29.120 --> 21:30.120
You got it, Wes.

21:30.120 --> 21:31.240
Nicely done.

21:31.240 --> 21:32.240
That was a blind guess.

21:32.240 --> 21:33.240
I'll be honest.

21:33.240 --> 21:34.240
All right.

21:34.240 --> 21:35.240
Now for $8,000.

21:35.240 --> 21:36.240
Thank you, PixelPimp.

21:36.240 --> 21:37.240
I'm impressed.

21:37.240 --> 21:38.240
Okay.

21:38.240 --> 21:44.600
For $8,000, by definition, which of the following might be portrayed in a still life painting?

21:44.600 --> 21:51.700
A bicycle race, a fruit basket, a flowing river, or a singing choir in a still life

21:51.700 --> 21:52.700
painting, Wes?

21:52.700 --> 21:56.960
I'm going to phone Brent.

21:56.960 --> 21:59.200
Make sure you have his Canadian line, though, right?

21:59.200 --> 22:02.080
Yeah, we have to actually pay a little long distance for that, so I got to limit the length

22:02.080 --> 22:03.080
of the call.

22:03.080 --> 22:05.120
All right, Brent, you've got 28 seconds.

22:05.120 --> 22:06.320
You probably heard the question.

22:06.320 --> 22:09.600
By definition, which of the following might be portrayed in a still life painting?

22:09.600 --> 22:13.680
A bicycle race, a fruit basket, a flowing river, or a singing choir.

22:13.680 --> 22:16.040
You've got about 15 seconds.

22:16.040 --> 22:23.780
Well, I know of still life photographs that they're generally inanimate, and all those

22:23.780 --> 22:26.000
other activities seem pretty animate.

22:26.000 --> 22:27.000
So I'm going to say fruit basket.

22:27.000 --> 22:28.000
Yeah, I was thinking fruit basket, right?

22:28.000 --> 22:29.560
I mean, there's stuff going on down there, but we just-

22:29.560 --> 22:30.560
All right, I'm locking it in.

22:30.560 --> 22:31.560
You're out of time.

22:31.560 --> 22:32.560
You're out of time.

22:32.560 --> 22:33.560
Yeah.

22:33.560 --> 22:34.560
You got it!

22:34.560 --> 22:35.560
Thank you, Brent.

22:35.560 --> 22:36.560
You're welcome.

22:36.560 --> 22:37.560
Nicely done.

22:37.560 --> 22:39.840
I am really impressed, you guys.

22:39.840 --> 22:48.720
All right, for $16,000, what shape's volume is calculated by multiplying the area of the

22:48.720 --> 22:55.800
base by the height and then dividing by three a hemisphere, a cube, cylinder, or a pyramid?

22:55.800 --> 23:00.120
So a shape's volume is calculated by multiplying the area of the base by the height and dividing

23:00.120 --> 23:01.120
by three.

23:01.120 --> 23:02.120
30 seconds.

23:02.120 --> 23:03.120
Hemisphere, cube, cylinder.

23:03.120 --> 23:08.800
What lifelines do I have?

23:08.800 --> 23:10.360
You've got an audience poll.

23:10.360 --> 23:12.440
Yeah, let's do the poll, all right?

23:12.440 --> 23:15.840
We're doing the audience poll, and okay, we're getting numbers in right now.

23:15.840 --> 23:23.160
The audience is voting D by 44%, which is pyramid.

23:23.160 --> 23:24.160
Which is pyramid.

23:24.160 --> 23:27.920
Okay, and then what was the formula again?

23:27.920 --> 23:30.600
By multiplying the area of the base by the height by dividing by three.

23:30.600 --> 23:31.600
Five seconds.

23:31.600 --> 23:34.240
Okay, yeah, let's trust the poll here.

23:34.240 --> 23:35.240
Let's go with pyramid.

23:35.240 --> 23:36.240
Okay.

23:36.240 --> 23:41.560
The automatic pilot system is not functional.

23:41.560 --> 23:42.560
Is it going?

23:42.560 --> 23:43.560
Uh-oh.

23:43.560 --> 23:44.560
It seems stuck.

23:44.560 --> 23:45.560
It does seem stuck.

23:45.560 --> 23:46.760
I don't know if it's going to take your...

23:46.760 --> 23:47.760
Maybe that means...

23:47.760 --> 23:48.760
Oh, I think we lost internet.

23:48.760 --> 23:49.760
That's what that means.

23:49.760 --> 23:50.760
Now we have to wait to find out.

23:50.760 --> 23:51.760
Oh, Chris!

23:51.760 --> 23:55.400
Oh, it worked, you got it!

23:55.400 --> 23:58.480
Oh, nicely done.

23:58.480 --> 24:00.800
There was a disconnect, but you got it.

24:00.800 --> 24:03.600
I can't even believe it, to tell you the truth.

24:03.600 --> 24:04.600
You got it.

24:04.600 --> 24:08.200
You got that last one, but an internet interruption reset our progress.

24:08.200 --> 24:10.440
But I feel like you were probably going to win.

24:10.440 --> 24:11.440
I mean, I don't know.

24:11.440 --> 24:12.440
I think so.

24:12.440 --> 24:13.840
And you know what?

24:13.840 --> 24:17.240
I think something just released that's a present for everyone listening at home too.

24:17.240 --> 24:18.240
Oh, yeah.

24:18.240 --> 24:19.240
Oh, yeah, right.

24:19.240 --> 24:20.240
We should probably wrap it up.

24:20.240 --> 24:21.240
All right, let's wrap it up.

24:21.240 --> 24:22.240
Let's wrap it up for the day.

24:22.240 --> 24:23.240
Good job, Wes.

24:23.240 --> 24:24.240
Good job, gentlemen.

24:24.240 --> 24:27.880
I couldn't have done it without the Mumble Room, without Brent.

24:27.880 --> 24:28.880
Same.

24:28.880 --> 24:29.880
I mean...

24:29.880 --> 24:31.680
And Brent needs to find out what he's won today.

24:31.680 --> 24:33.440
Brent, you need to figure out...

24:33.440 --> 24:34.440
Let's see.

24:34.440 --> 24:35.440
So let's see.

24:35.440 --> 24:36.440
Why don't you do the math?

24:36.440 --> 24:37.440
You tell me.

24:37.440 --> 24:38.440
You tell me what 2000 SATs is.

24:38.440 --> 24:39.440
Well, you can ask Google.

24:39.440 --> 24:40.440
Google.

24:40.440 --> 24:41.440
Google will tell you.

24:41.440 --> 24:42.440
You have to do a little math.

24:42.440 --> 24:45.200
So first find the volume of the pyramid and then find out.

24:45.200 --> 24:46.600
Divide by three, is it?

24:46.600 --> 24:54.120
All right, I want everybody to head over to extras.show right now because we just released...

24:54.120 --> 24:55.120
Yep.

24:55.120 --> 24:56.120
Extras.show.80.

24:56.120 --> 25:00.960
We just released a really fun one-off episode that Brent and I just recorded.

25:00.960 --> 25:06.680
And it turns out, surprise, we were recording during the entire road trip to Denver and

25:06.680 --> 25:08.680
we had a whole mountain of audio.

25:08.680 --> 25:09.680
We still have more, actually.

25:09.680 --> 25:12.320
Is this like that Beatles movie?

25:12.320 --> 25:13.320
Turns out.

25:13.320 --> 25:14.320
Turns out.

25:14.320 --> 25:19.880
It's the behind the scenes stuff that we captured and we played some of it in the road trip

25:19.880 --> 25:24.280
memories episode, which just released on extras.show and there'll be more.

25:24.280 --> 25:28.040
There'll be one on Thursday too, I think, is when the next one comes out.

25:28.040 --> 25:29.920
So go over there and check it out.

25:29.920 --> 25:35.920
I feel like we wanted to have a clip for you guys, but then we didn't really know.

25:35.920 --> 25:36.920
We didn't want to.

25:36.920 --> 25:37.920
We didn't want to spoil it.

25:37.920 --> 25:40.760
We both thought of the same clip at the same moment and then we thought, no, no, that's

25:40.760 --> 25:41.760
the...

25:41.760 --> 25:42.760
Yeah, we didn't want to spoil it for you guys.

25:42.760 --> 25:45.360
So go over to extras.show and grab that.

25:45.360 --> 25:46.360
And that's it.

25:46.360 --> 25:47.360
Thank you for being here today.

25:47.360 --> 25:48.360
I think that was fun.

25:48.360 --> 25:51.960
That's all we had planned and I feel like we've accomplished it.

25:51.960 --> 26:13.280
So podcast out.
