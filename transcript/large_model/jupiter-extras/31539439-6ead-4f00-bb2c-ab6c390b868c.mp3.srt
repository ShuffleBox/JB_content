1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,440
Well, hello, everyone. I'm joined today by Heather Ellsworth. Heather, how are you doing?

2
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:16,640
I'm well, how are you?

3
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:24,280
I'm doing good. We got connected through Popey, actually, those who know Alan Pope. He said,

4
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:28,480
hey, you should really have a chat with Heather. She's pretty darn interesting and would be

5
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:31,440
a great guest for Brunch with Brent.

6
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:34,960
Yeah, thanks for having me. I feel very honored.

7
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:41,240
Yeah, absolutely. Now, I wanted to just give a little taste of sort of the things that

8
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:46,680
you're doing these days, but we'll dive into a bit of your history in a moment. So I know

9
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:53,000
a few that you're newly on the canonical team, I guess the Ubuntu desktop team specifically,

10
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
is that right?

11
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,080
That's right. I've been there for like five months, just about.

12
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:02,560
Okay. So somewhat fresh, but just finding your feet now.

13
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:07,240
That's right. Five months and two days, actually. I realize.

14
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:09,960
Well, happy five month and two day anniversary.

15
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:14,800
Yeah, I would say that I'm still learning the ropes, but that also means like I'm still

16
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:19,840
learning that there are more ropes to learn. There's an infinite number of ropes to learn.

17
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,760
The more you learn, the more you realize you don't know.

18
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:28,080
Yeah, but one nice thing is that everybody at canonical is super nice and down to earth

19
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:33,640
and happy to answer silly questions for newcomers like myself.

20
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:37,760
You know, they were all newcomers at one point, too. So I'm sure there's some empathy there.

21
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:42,440
Yeah, but not everybody usually remembers that. But in this community, it seems like

22
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:44,120
they do. So that's quite nice.

23
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:50,660
Oh, nice. Yeah. And I've heard that often of canonical that it's really kind of a human

24
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:54,040
centric environment. Would you agree with that description?

25
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:56,420
I would absolutely agree with that. Yeah.

26
00:01:56,420 --> 00:02:03,040
Does that feel nurturing in a way that maybe you haven't experienced in the past?

27
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:09,960
Yes, definitely. Especially like an open source. I've experienced kind of both spectrums where

28
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:15,440
some people can be quite antagonistic and mean unnecessarily. And it's just kind of

29
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:21,560
like, why? And then it's really nice to be surrounded by people that are the opposite

30
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:28,480
that are happy to help and happy to chat, especially being like in a remote position

31
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:34,480
where sometimes you can feel isolated and siloed, get frustrated on your own. So it's

32
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:39,640
nice to have that sort of base that you can reach out to.

33
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:45,000
Sounds like a really strong support system, really, that allows you to do your best work.

34
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:50,420
I would imagine on the flip side when there's that antagonistic environment, how then can

35
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:53,480
you do your best work if you're sort of surrounded by that energy?

36
00:02:53,480 --> 00:03:00,600
Yeah. I tend to mirror the energy that I experience. So if someone's going to be a jerk to me,

37
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:06,100
I am going to push it right back because that's kind of what you have to do. Like that's,

38
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:10,440
you know, a thick skin bounces stuff off, right?

39
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:19,480
Well, it's important to defend yourself. Like I tend to be quite conflict avoiding, I would

40
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:21,120
say in general.

41
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,440
Oh yeah, me too.

42
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:28,440
That has been my nature and it sounds like yours too. And certainly my parents are sort

43
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:34,680
of that way. And I've observed that in myself as being a really nice trait, but not a hundred

44
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:35,680
percent of the time.

45
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:39,080
Yeah. It's not good to be too squishy.

46
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:42,960
Thank you for describing me as squishy.

47
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:47,280
I think I'm squishy sometimes. If someone that's more experienced than I comes and says

48
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,920
like, oh no, you have to do it this way. I say, oh, okay. Yeah. You're more experienced.

49
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:54,760
I believe you. And then if someone else comes along and says, oh no, don't do it. That person

50
00:03:54,760 --> 00:04:01,160
says, well, dang it. I don't know what else to do.

51
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,160
Tricky, eh?

52
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:09,800
Yeah. But I find that the community at Canonical has been really helpful and in all ways. So

53
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,920
I am very happy to be there.

54
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:18,120
Lovely. Well, that sounds amazing. And how was the onboarding for you? Cause I know you're

55
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:23,320
working remotely, so at a distance, but you're also a huge like time zone difference. So

56
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:26,040
was that kind of an adjustment as well?

57
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:32,440
Not so much because my previous role was a time adjustment as well. I mean, at least

58
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:36,520
in this role, there is another person on my team that is in the US.

59
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:37,520
You're not the only one.

60
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:44,080
Yeah. Right. Whereas in my last team, well, no, I guess there was someone in the US, but

61
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:51,320
most of the people I worked with were in Germany. So the central European standard of time.

62
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:55,200
And now it's a little bit better. So I used to have a lot of meetings that started at

63
00:04:55,200 --> 00:05:02,080
like 7am and I'm not a super morning person. So it's hard to be like caffeinated and ready

64
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:09,640
to like run meetings by seven. So now I have to, you know, it's more of like an eight to

65
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:13,400
five thing. It's much more comfortable.

66
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:17,080
So why don't you guide us through what you do at Canonical?

67
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:23,880
Yeah. So I was hired to work on snaps. If your listeners don't know what snaps are,

68
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:29,640
there's a lot of documentation out there, but it's basically a containerized application

69
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:39,240
system. And it's really kind of fun to just like write metadata to snap things. That's

70
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:47,160
how it started, but then it quickly led to improving the snap craft build tool itself

71
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:56,600
and adding an extension to make snapping gnome snaps a lot easier since I am a devout gnome

72
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:02,880
user and I'm a gnome foundation member and I love gnome. So I've been kind of working

73
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:09,420
in this like snap and snap craft space. And then there was a need for someone to take

74
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:14,880
on the maintainership of LibreOffice. So I said I would happily do that, not really knowing

75
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:18,240
what I was signing up for.

76
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:23,120
Sometimes the best things we run into are the things where you just kind of take a chance,

77
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,120
right?

78
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:31,000
Yeah. My life motto has always been like, how hard can it be? Sometimes it's gotten

79
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
me into trouble.

80
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,200
And yet I imagine that also stretches you in a bunch of ways.

81
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:42,040
Yeah, definitely. I learned so much having that attitude. I am still learning a lot about

82
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:50,360
LibreOffice and I still want to call it OpenOffice. It seems like a new bug is opened about that

83
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:55,400
every day. So it's like every day I'm like, oh, how do I reproduce that? How do I do that?

84
00:06:55,400 --> 00:07:02,440
I don't know. So that's what I'm doing now. Yeah. Kind of snap stuff and helping out with

85
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:03,440
LibreOffice.

86
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:06,000
LibreOffice seems like a big project.

87
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,200
It is a beast. Yeah.

88
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:16,440
I was being kind. And so I would imagine then that people must look quite fondly at the

89
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:21,000
work that you've done in the past to give you that kind of responsibility.

90
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,400
I sure hope so. Either that or they're desperate or some sort of combination.

91
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:30,800
I was going to say, how's that feeling?

92
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:36,040
But I can tell you that I do my best every day, whatever the problem is I'm working on,

93
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:42,320
whether it's snap stuff or LibreOffice. And it probably looks like I'm kind of slow, but

94
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:48,680
I've been here five months and I'm still learning the infinite ropes. So I'm slowly but surely

95
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:55,520
I will master this. It's funny because I'm really competitive. And when LibreOffice was

96
00:07:55,520 --> 00:08:03,240
handed over to me, my boss said, hey, it's being handed to you in a pretty good state.

97
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:11,760
And I thought, oh, this is a good state. And I made note that there are 372 bugs. One day

98
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:17,080
I'm sure I will hand this off and I want to make sure that there's less than 372 bugs.

99
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:21,920
And if I do, then I will feel like I have won somehow.

100
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,680
That's your own internal metric?

101
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:29,960
Yes. Yes, absolutely. I like to win. I like to set goals. I don't know, just all over

102
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:37,080
the place. I'm a big planner and goal setter. And I mean, I track all kinds of like metrics

103
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:40,280
in my personal life just for the heck of it.

104
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,280
Can you give us a few?

105
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:50,520
Yeah, I like to just try and measure things, random things, seemingly.

106
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:52,000
They must be measured somehow.

107
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:58,280
Yeah, yeah. But like, like coffee. I guess it's been a couple of years ago. So I buy

108
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:02,360
my coffee in bulk and I love my coffee and I drink the same amount of coffee every day.

109
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:11,200
So I wanted to know how much does a cup of coffee cost me every day? I'm happy to pay

110
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:17,680
too much for bulk, delicious coffee. But I wanted to know like how much cheaper is it

111
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:24,960
than like if I were to go to whatever local coffee shop and get a black coffee. And so

112
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:32,640
yeah, I did this for like three-ish months and it turns out it costs 80 cents a day.

113
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:37,880
Now 80 cents, is that 80 cents total or 80 cents more than the other option?

114
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:43,360
Nope, that's 80 cents total. So when I do go to coffee shops, when I'm, you know, when

115
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:50,960
I need to get out of the house, you know, a cup of black coffee is about $3. So it's

116
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:57,280
a lot cheaper. And even if it wasn't cheaper, I probably wouldn't go to a coffee shop every

117
00:09:57,280 --> 00:10:02,560
day just cause that's more of a commute than I'm used to. Just walking downstairs.

118
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:06,040
Yeah, I'm with you on that one.

119
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:13,120
When I was in grad school, I did a more complicated measurement on the milk. So, you know, I always

120
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:19,600
have milk around and I wanted to know like, you know, the sell by date. Is that really

121
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:26,000
when I should stop drinking the milk or, so I measured all kinds of things about like

122
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:33,080
when I opened the milk relative to when the sell by date was. And I had sort of a flavor

123
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:36,720
like numerical profile I would attach to every day.

124
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,840
I'm loving this.

125
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:45,800
Yeah, I just, so I did this for like only maybe a month or so because it was kind of

126
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:53,000
intense and I was a grad student and I didn't have time to do that. And yeah, so I stopped

127
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,240
drinking milk exactly at the sell by date.

128
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:59,440
There you go, listeners. You don't have to do that for yourself.

129
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:03,880
I just enjoy taking notes about little things in my life like that.

130
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:07,800
Oh, it sounds like you're optimizing in many ways, right? And then you don't have to think

131
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:13,000
about that topic at all forever unless something drastic changes.

132
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:18,120
That's right. I love efficiency, so.

133
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:23,400
Now that process you just described sounds quite scientific to me and I know that you

134
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:28,240
have a scientific background. So can you walk us through that background?

135
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:34,240
I'm a software engineer, but I didn't take any computer science classes. I am a physicist

136
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,320
by trade.

137
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,920
It all makes sense now.

138
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:45,320
Yeah, I did my bachelors in physics and then I did my masters in high energy physics, experimental

139
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:53,440
high energy physics. I'm not a theorist. And I worked at CERN for a year while I did that.

140
00:11:53,440 --> 00:12:01,640
Yeah, no, that was amazing. I lived in France, just on the French Swiss border, rode my bike

141
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:05,920
to CERN every day, worked in building 42.

142
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,440
That sounds so romantic.

143
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:15,920
It was lovely. I worked on the ATLAS detector, so I could talk for hours about high energy

144
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:23,080
physics, but I think we don't have that kind of time. But what I did was I worked on a

145
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:32,240
piece of the detector that didn't have a good protection from the radiation. So the signal

146
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:39,480
going through each of those kind of areas was not usable. So I came up with a scheme

147
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:45,520
to calibrate those so that the energy that went through those sections could be actually

148
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:52,720
used towards finding the Higgs. So I was lucky enough to be a published author on the Higgs

149
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:56,840
paper among 3000 other physicists.

150
00:12:56,840 --> 00:13:01,360
That seems pretty cool. That's like world class stuff. And when you say Higgs, for those

151
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,960
who don't know the shorthand, that would be?

152
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:05,040
Oh, right. Higgs boson.

153
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:11,040
When that was sort of just all happening. Man, did I ever throw myself into a whole

154
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:14,960
bunch of reading all about that. And it's so fascinating. Like, you have a certain perspective

155
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:20,560
of it. But, you know, as someone in the public, it was still really quite exciting. Some of

156
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:25,240
the discoveries that are happening at CERN and around the Higgs, especially, it seemed

157
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,440
like a really cool time.

158
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:30,640
I still follow, you know, the physics that comes out of CERN specifically. I mean, it's

159
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:37,600
quite interesting. And I just love physics. But so when I was doing my master's, that's

160
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:43,800
when I learned how to write some code because you had lots of data coming through the detector

161
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:50,320
every day and that had to be analyzed. And you're kind of racing against, you know, the

162
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:55,240
other general purpose detector, which is CMS. And so there's like a healthy rivalry there.

163
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:57,680
Of course, ATLAS is objectively the best.

164
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:58,680
Perfect for you.

165
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:05,320
Yeah. There was a lot of kind of statistics. Well, a lot of similar things actually with

166
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:10,480
what goes on in machine learning today. You know, there was a lot of data. My advisor

167
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:16,920
was just like, write some C code to make these plots. And you got to, you know, just figure

168
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:20,560
it out. So I Googled my way to writing some working C code.

169
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:21,560
Wow.

170
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:27,320
I hated it at first, but after I was able to actually do things with it, I really loved

171
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:34,360
it. And then after I graduated, I started my PhD in physics. But after one semester

172
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:40,040
I was like, you know what? I think I'm good on grad school and feeling constantly guilty

173
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:48,640
that I'm not working 24 hours a day. So I went and got a job writing Perl tests at HP.

174
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:49,640
Really?

175
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:50,640
Yeah.

176
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:51,640
Sounds cool.

177
00:14:51,640 --> 00:15:01,680
So I was happy to do that for several reasons. I mean, I am from Texas. And then I moved

178
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:08,960
to Colorado to start my PhD and the town I lived in, which was Fort Collins was absolutely

179
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:16,600
amazing and I didn't want to leave. And so it was nice to be able to stay in Fort Collins

180
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:25,400
and have a job making real person money and have time to like read books for leisure and,

181
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:32,760
you know, pursue hobbies and that kind of thing. And I don't miss school. However, I

182
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:39,760
do miss doing math on a daily basis. Just pages of math was so much fun. Oh my God.

183
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:46,440
There are so many of the inclinations that you're describing in yourself, like your love

184
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:54,840
of math and deep interest in physics and in measuring things that is of course like multi

185
00:15:54,840 --> 00:16:02,060
disciplinary benefits. So I could see how those would translate into what you're doing

186
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:07,160
now in a really beautiful way, even if, you know, clearly there's a little bit less math,

187
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:12,180
but a lot of those principles still carry over in a, in a really beautiful way. So at

188
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:16,720
least you're still using some of it in many ways.

189
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:21,080
Absolutely. I think that computer science is a little bit more of a challenge relative

190
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:27,920
to physics because physics is very much recipes. Here's a recipe to do a thing. You follow

191
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:33,880
that recipe and discovering recipes to do things. But in computer science, there's like

192
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:41,840
multiple ways to do one thing. Like how to make a Debian package. Well, it kind of depends

193
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:47,600
on some things, you know, how does that project do things? Do they use get build package or

194
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:55,040
maybe they use, you know, pristine tar balls or just Deb build or P builder or who knows,

195
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,040
like

196
00:16:56,040 --> 00:17:02,520
But could those not be described as like a variety of recipes or at least like sub recipes

197
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:04,000
to a greater recipe?

198
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,880
Definitely. But then it's all about kind of determining what recipe you need to do to

199
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:14,080
solve this problem. Instead of like in physics, it's like, here's your recipe to this.

200
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:17,040
But is that only because someone else has figured the recipe out for you? Like in some

201
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:22,080
of your research in physics, I would imagine like that would still be an unknown.

202
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:29,640
Yeah. I think, you know, the research in physics, um, you're always asking yourself a question,

203
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:34,120
at least in my experience, I was asking a question, you know, I want to answer this

204
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:41,900
particular thing with this data set. So what plots, what graphs, you know, can I make to

205
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:47,960
answer that? And then that answer would always lead to another question that always involved

206
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:53,620
making more plots based on the data to answer that question. And so it was just like a linear

207
00:17:53,620 --> 00:18:00,800
trail of questions. It was a lot of fun. Yeah. I quite enjoyed it. Sometimes I wish, you

208
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:05,640
know, I'd had more of a traditional computer science background, but I had so much fun

209
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:11,600
in physics, especially getting to, you know, work at CERN that I, I don't think I would

210
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,480
take it back for anything.

211
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:18,640
Why do you say that sometimes you could see a more traditional path as helpful? Like what

212
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:23,000
is it about that traditional path that you feel like you're, you've missed out on or

213
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,400
that you would benefit from?

214
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:31,040
Just, there's like foundational concepts I've come across in the last, I guess I've

215
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:33,720
been a software engineer for like nine years now.

216
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:35,760
Congratulations. That's awesome.

217
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:43,240
Oh yeah. Thanks. Yeah. Like there's, there's just been several times over that nine years

218
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:49,960
where I've, you know, having some piece of fundamental computer science knowledge would

219
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:56,920
have really helped me out because I didn't have that. Then it was a bit more of a struggle

220
00:18:56,920 --> 00:19:04,840
and maybe a little frustrating to get there. But that's kind of why I like to write documentation

221
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:11,040
so that I can help myself learn those things and kind of build up that foundational knowledge,

222
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:12,200
even if it's a little late.

223
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:16,860
Right. Because with documentation, you have to sort of understand the underlying principles

224
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:20,600
in order to communicate effectively. So self-serving. Interesting.

225
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:25,560
Yeah, that's right. I mean, everything we do is self-serving.

226
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:30,480
Fair enough. Fair enough. Even if we don't want to admit it.

227
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:31,480
Right. Yes.

228
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:37,040
But you were saying, yeah, learning it yourself, like in order to teach someone else, you have

229
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:38,040
to learn it yourself.

230
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:45,000
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I learned a lot of physics just by teaching labs to undergrads. You know,

231
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:49,560
they would ask questions and be like, oh, well, that's a good question. I will go find

232
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:53,880
that out. Like just to be able to explain, you know, the concept. This is what today's

233
00:19:53,880 --> 00:20:02,800
lab is about. You know, when you're preparing for things like that, it leads you to do some

234
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:07,160
more research to understand maybe some finer points that you weren't so sure on.

235
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:16,160
How would you describe either similar or different the creative space in either realm? Like because

236
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:23,640
there's, as you know, quite a lot of creativity in software, but there's also quite a lot

237
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:28,920
of creativity. I have some friends who are, well, you included, but some other friends

238
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:35,840
who are also deeply in the physics realm. Do you find that creativity to be similar

239
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:38,320
or complimentary or is it totally different?

240
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:45,160
Yeah, I guess it is similar. I mean, it is like the creativity comes from the logic and

241
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:51,760
the logic, you know, they're both logical things, computer science and physics, although

242
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:57,640
sometimes one or both of those might seem a little illogical, but there's definitely

243
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:05,560
some method to the madness. So yeah, I think that they are quite similar in their creativity.

244
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:13,040
I certainly get creative whenever I just write some code, especially like if I'm doing it

245
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:22,120
at home for personal use or something. I'm not the kind of programmer that seeks to write

246
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:29,600
the tightest code in the world. I'm a physicist programmer and what we do is we write code

247
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:30,800
that works.

248
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,720
To get you to the next point, right?

249
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:41,040
Yeah. So a couple of jobs ago I was writing some Python tests and this coworker was kind

250
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:45,120
of looking over this function I had written and he was like, oh, you could do these like

251
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:53,160
four lines in like two lines. And I was like, so? Like, I really don't care. Ain't nobody

252
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:58,280
got time for that. Like this works. Let's move on. As long as there's not some like,

253
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:04,200
you know, major performance hit then. Yeah. In my development experience, and you're

254
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:09,360
going to agree with this, I know already, and it's true of my background in photography

255
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:18,960
and perhaps even yours in physics, but it's, there's something essential about like gleaning

256
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:26,520
when you need to compromise. So when is, you know, really elegant code important, you know,

257
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:30,880
in terms of performance would be a perfect example. But then there's also something to

258
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:36,360
be said for your own development time and energy and creativity, right? So if you got

259
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:40,360
four lines that work as well as those two lines and that's not really going to have

260
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:45,960
any, you know, play a different role, then maybe there is more value in just moving on

261
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:51,080
and working on the next, you know, the next four lines. That's an area that fascinates

262
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:59,280
me is in my trying to break my own leanings towards perfectionism is knowing when enough

263
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:05,160
is good enough, you know, like, like a B plus is maybe enough in this case. And maybe the

264
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:08,560
true skill is knowing how to evaluate that for each situation.

265
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:14,860
Yeah, I do agree. I mean, I could play the devil's advocate and say that I could see

266
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:20,000
an argument for the other side that would give you an opportunity to learn the language

267
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:25,520
a little bit better to learn this, you know, maybe a new feature of the language. I'm not

268
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:32,120
going to learn that unless I don't use it. But I tend to kind of barrel through things

269
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:38,360
as you know, I want to get to my goal as quickly as possible. Maybe that goes back to the competitive

270
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:46,360
thing. But yeah, so I just want to write something that works and then move on. That's yeah,

271
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:51,560
that's typically how I approach things. I think what's lovely is that there are so

272
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:59,360
many different types of us right of people and approaches to solving problems. So I would

273
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:05,240
imagine in an open source environment, having several people looking at some code, and I

274
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:08,720
don't know if that's your experience, but having several different types of people looking

275
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:14,400
at the same code might be helpful in that way, because you'd have, for instance, you

276
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:19,560
who barrels through as you suggested, but solves the problem and then someone else who

277
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:25,960
comes through behind you and just maybe, I don't want to say clean it up, because that's

278
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:31,280
that's kind of suggest that that what you've written is sort of under a negative light,

279
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:37,200
but just maybe add some elegance or performance to that kind of stuff.

280
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:44,640
Definitely. I mean, diversity is important in all aspects of our life. So yeah, I mean,

281
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:51,820
having more eyes on code by all walks of life is always a good thing.

282
00:24:51,820 --> 00:25:01,020
And that brings me back to your mentioning how you wish sometimes that you had that sort

283
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:07,440
of classic computer science background, because I think there is an argument to the benefits

284
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:11,760
of not having that, you know, you look at problems a little differently than someone

285
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:18,040
who's, I'll call it classically trained, but someone who's gone through the standard learning

286
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:23,880
path may be trained to see problems a certain way, but that diversity that you're bringing

287
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:28,640
from not having that might also be a benefit. So don't be too hard on yourself.

288
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:35,440
That's a good point. No, that's a good point. I mean, and I think honestly that employers

289
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:44,680
have seen that maybe before I have, because they say, oh, a physicist. And I'm like, hang

290
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:49,200
on there. You know, I'm not like a genius or anything. Just anybody can study physics.

291
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,200
You say that.

292
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:58,000
In physics, we make things sound harder than they really are. We like to use complicated

293
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:06,860
terms like calorimeter and, you know, boson. We actually read an article the other day

294
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:12,600
about how scientists like to do that. They like to, you know, jargon things up to make

295
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:18,380
it sound fancy. But when the layman reads, you know, a scientific article or something

296
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:25,640
with that jargon, it actually deters them from wanting to pursue science in general.

297
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:27,000
That's unfortunate.

298
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:31,200
That's a challenge, isn't it? Because I see that in my photography realm as well, is that

299
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:36,480
there's all these terms that are very helpful if you're sort of deep in that topic because

300
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:43,520
it points to a very specific, I don't know, instrument or concept, for instance. But you're

301
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:52,120
right. It does push some distance between maybe the, I'll call it the uninitiated to

302
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:55,480
approach those topics. And I imagine that's true in software as well.

303
00:26:55,480 --> 00:27:03,400
Yeah. I mean, I think people in general like to create a niche little space for them and

304
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:04,840
their kind, right? Like...

305
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:05,840
It's our tribe.

306
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:12,120
Yeah, it's our tribe. Exactly. It makes it feel special and exclusive. But that's a double

307
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:14,320
edged sword, right? So...

308
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:19,480
Maybe it's the role of documentation to sort of guide people from one realm to the other.

309
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:26,880
Yeah. Yeah. I think documentation is such a key of communication. I write all kinds

310
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:32,860
of documentation for myself, especially if I have to learn something new, then I want

311
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:38,340
to write everything down. That way I can hand it off to someone and not have to remember

312
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:45,000
anything about it or come back to it in six months and be able to pick it back up pretty

313
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:51,960
quickly. So anytime I'm learning something new, I write a ton of like personal documentation

314
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:57,720
and it feels so good. It feels like I don't have to remember this. So if I go to sleep,

315
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:00,940
you know, tonight and then the morning I'm like, oh yeah, what was that command? I can

316
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:02,380
just go look at it.

317
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:08,400
And so you find the time dedicated to documenting worthwhile in the end?

318
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:16,600
100%. Maybe that's why I am kind of slower when I do things because I make sure to document

319
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:25,040
alongside at the same time. I just need it. Like it's cathartic and it helps me when I

320
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:34,080
need to refer back to it. I find, you know, projects that have good documentation. I think

321
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:38,760
like, I wonder who wrote this. I would like to meet that person. They did a very good

322
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:42,720
job. I would like to buy them a beer, you know?

323
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:49,600
I've heard repeatedly the value of documentation and yet so often the people who write good

324
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:53,000
documentation are sort of hidden away in the shadows.

325
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:59,400
Not everybody loves it and I don't understand that, but I do love it and I am definitely

326
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:04,500
going to continue to write documentation.

327
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:06,600
Thank you for loving it. We need people like you.

328
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:11,720
Yeah, sure. I enjoy it. So it's win-win.

329
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:16,720
Can I ask you about your personal documentation infrastructure?

330
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:17,720
Sure.

331
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:24,320
Like how do you capture these things and how are you storing them long-term, et cetera,

332
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:25,320
et cetera?

333
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:33,400
Well, there's an application that I absolutely love. I've been using Cherry Tree for about

334
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:41,360
nine years. I found it when I found software engineering. And it's kind of like OneNote,

335
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:47,840
but for Linux and it's very simple and amazing. And so I absolutely love this project. I've

336
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:55,480
actually told several people, converted several people to be Cherry Tree users, snapped it.

337
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:57,000
It's in the Snap Store.

338
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
Also self-serving.

339
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,080
I can't live without it. It's fantastic.

340
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:02,080
Oh, wow.

341
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:10,920
Yeah. So I use Cherry Tree daily for like, well, really for everything. But I like to

342
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:17,520
take a lot of notes on what I do with my workday every day, just to kind of make sure that

343
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:20,920
I'm capturing the work that I do, that I can communicate that.

344
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:24,360
So tracking your progress through time?

345
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:28,840
Tracking my progress. Yeah. And kind of make a summary every week to share that with my

346
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:35,180
coworkers. But also I have another Cherry Tree document that's just like full of how-tos.

347
00:30:35,180 --> 00:30:42,820
So yeah, it's just been growing over the years. The way I write documentation is very similar

348
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:50,240
to Markdown. But yeah, it's really a rich text editor that I just love.

349
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:53,360
So I've not heard of Cherry Tree. I'm going to dive into it because this is a topic I

350
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:58,780
really like, this sort of personal documentation stuff. And I'm a huge believer and have been

351
00:30:58,780 --> 00:31:05,940
for many years. But what's the underlying infrastructure? Is this being synced to various

352
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:10,260
devices of yours or is it just at a single workstation?

353
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:15,880
It's on my workstation, but I have a hacky script to kind of sync it on my devices.

354
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:17,880
It's a B plus script, it sounds like.

355
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:25,760
Yeah, I mean, it works, right? So whenever I am using my laptop, I can just run this

356
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:34,240
little script and it'll grab the latest changes. There's no like mobile Cherry Tree. So I am

357
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:40,860
at a loss with my phone. I have to email myself things to put in Cherry Tree.

358
00:31:40,860 --> 00:31:42,740
It sounds like something you wish existed.

359
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:50,200
Oh my God, yes. Yes. Well, I mean, once I have a Linux phone, then...

360
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:51,740
It's coming.

361
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:54,020
I know.

362
00:31:54,020 --> 00:31:59,060
So maybe that's actually a really nice segue. I wanted to ask you a little bit more about

363
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:06,220
your documentation in the professional realm. And I know you've spent some time at Purism

364
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:10,180
doing some documentation stuff there. Can you walk us through that a little bit?

365
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:17,540
Before Purism, I was just writing, you know, how-tos for myself, for other coworkers. And

366
00:32:17,540 --> 00:32:25,780
I was browsing Reddit one day and I saw that the Librem 5 project was launched and dove

367
00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:35,540
into that and applied for a job and was really happy to be hired as the documentation engineer.

368
00:32:35,540 --> 00:32:36,540
Amazing.

369
00:32:36,540 --> 00:32:45,780
I set up the VM and the NGINX and, you know, the Sphinx documentation there and just started

370
00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:55,320
writing it. Worked with some amazing engineers to try and document the fantastic technologies

371
00:32:55,320 --> 00:33:02,860
that they were putting together for the Librem 5. And that was a lot of fun. I really enjoyed

372
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:03,860
it.

373
00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:09,620
I'm not with Purism anymore, just because after my maternity leave, I became a project

374
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:15,740
manager. I thought, I can give this a shot. It was a hole that needed to be filled. And

375
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:20,860
it turns out I really didn't like that at all. And it wasn't really a good path for

376
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:24,140
me to kind of go back to what I was doing.

377
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:25,860
Ah, got it.

378
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:34,640
So yeah, I mean, I am really honored to have written so much documentation for Librem 5

379
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:40,780
and to work with the engineers on that team. They are absolute rock stars.

380
00:33:40,780 --> 00:33:46,620
It sounds like once again, you are sort of on the trailblazing side of some pretty cool

381
00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:47,620
technology.

382
00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:52,820
Yeah, I feel really like lucky to have had that opportunity.

383
00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:54,220
It also sounds like you're seeking it.

384
00:33:54,220 --> 00:33:58,340
Yeah, of course. We should always be seeking to make ourselves happy, right?

385
00:33:58,340 --> 00:34:03,860
If trailblazing is what makes you happy, go for it. That's awesome. But I admire how you

386
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:09,540
sort of discovered a project, saw how it's something that you could really believe in

387
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:16,060
and then threw yourself 100% at it. That's really quite lovely and honorable, I think.

388
00:34:16,060 --> 00:34:25,500
Oh, yeah. Thanks. I mean, I'm going to chase after whatever makes me happy and that definitely

389
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:27,180
fit the bill.

390
00:34:27,180 --> 00:34:33,500
I really do like writing documentation. I sadly haven't had enough time to do that in

391
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:44,300
my current role because I think the SnapCraft documentation could use some additional effort

392
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:49,660
from myself. I mean, it's definitely being maintained and the community is awesome and

393
00:34:49,660 --> 00:34:55,660
they help out. But I think I have some to give in that realm too. I just got to find

394
00:34:55,660 --> 00:34:56,660
some time.

395
00:34:56,660 --> 00:35:03,240
Well, I would imagine for you being kind of new on the desktop team that there's quite

396
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:07,980
the learning curve you're going through. So maybe as that settles a little bit, you'll

397
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:08,980
find some time.

398
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:12,460
That's kind of what I'm hoping. I mean, I am kind of documenting some stuff just for

399
00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:21,900
myself on the side in Cherry Tree, like everything to do with, oh, not open office, LibreOffice.

400
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:26,880
And so yeah, like I have documented some stuff about SnapCraft, but mostly I've used kind

401
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:27,880
of what's out there.

402
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:32,300
I've read only like kind of surface level stuff and I found it quite nice. But I would

403
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:35,780
imagine like any project, there's always more that can be done.

404
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:41,500
At Purism, that was one thing. That was standing up a whole documentation thing from the ground

405
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:47,540
up. So I got to lay it out however I wanted to, however I felt was the most intuitive.

406
00:35:47,540 --> 00:35:52,220
Whereas this is completely different, right? There's an established like documentation

407
00:35:52,220 --> 00:36:00,380
tree, hierarchy already out there that maybe that's not how exactly how I would have laid

408
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:05,020
it out, but we can always add more links, right?

409
00:36:05,020 --> 00:36:13,500
And I think referencing relevant pages at relevant times can always improve existing

410
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:18,260
documentation. So I would like to find some time to do that maybe in the next year or

411
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:19,260
so.

412
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:27,580
One topic I wanted to touch on is we sort of chatted about it very briefly when we talked

413
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:31,540
a few days ago and I wanted to come back to it because it was one of those moments where

414
00:36:31,540 --> 00:36:38,980
I was like, no, no, no, no, let's keep it for when we chat. And we had quickly explored

415
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:45,500
the topic of the economics of open source. And I know that's something that's close

416
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:52,500
to your heart that you feel is often misunderstood. And I just wondered some of your additional

417
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:53,660
thoughts on that.

418
00:36:53,660 --> 00:37:01,820
I'm passionate about open source. And when I started working at HP, I was very proprietary

419
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:13,820
and I didn't really understand open source. I've been a Linux user exclusively for a long

420
00:37:13,820 --> 00:37:22,340
time actually, maybe 15 years. But it didn't contribute. There was a point where I tried

421
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:30,020
to contribute, but I got shot down in a very mean way. And then I was kind of gun shy.

422
00:37:30,020 --> 00:37:36,300
How come and why? What was the environment like? And you don't have to mention a project

423
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:37,300
specifically.

424
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:44,740
Yeah, no, I just I wanted to help out on a package. And I thought I'd like I'd read

425
00:37:44,740 --> 00:37:53,620
the project's documentation and it was misleading. And so I offered to take over maintainership

426
00:37:53,620 --> 00:38:00,940
because I thought that that's the way you did that. And it was wrong. And what I should

427
00:38:00,940 --> 00:38:08,220
have done is I should have offered to improve the documentation. But instead, I was terrified

428
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:17,660
of this faceless community. So I just stood back and watched for many years until I found

429
00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:22,420
the Gnome community and they've been very nice.

430
00:38:22,420 --> 00:38:28,260
And what was it about that Gnome community that convinced you that it was a safe environment

431
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:29,260
to rejoin?

432
00:38:29,260 --> 00:38:37,980
The people, they were just so nice and willing to help and answer questions. And they were

433
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:41,020
real people with real faces that I met.

434
00:38:41,020 --> 00:38:42,860
That makes all the difference, doesn't it?

435
00:38:42,860 --> 00:38:44,000
It does.

436
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,380
To know that there's another human being on the other side of that that code or that that

437
00:38:47,380 --> 00:38:48,380
documentation.

438
00:38:48,380 --> 00:38:57,340
Yeah, I'm I'm a visual person. And so I like to see faces. So I went to LinuxCon in 2015,

439
00:38:57,340 --> 00:39:03,540
which now it's like all things are open source summit. That's what it is. But in 2015, it

440
00:39:03,540 --> 00:39:10,500
was LinuxCon and it was amazing. And I was standing outside of some talk that was full.

441
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:16,780
I forget what it was. And I was just kind of standing like at the door, open doors.

442
00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:23,380
And right behind me was this booth for the Free Software Foundation. And I started talking

443
00:39:23,380 --> 00:39:32,100
with some of the guys there and I ended up buying Freedom 2.0, which is Richard Stallman's

444
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:41,300
book. And I read it and loved it. And it answered a lot of questions for me. But it also kind

445
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:47,900
of led me to read Cathedral and the Bazaar, which is almost like a response. And the combination

446
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:54,020
of those two books really helped me kind of understand the history of open source and

447
00:39:54,020 --> 00:39:59,260
why we need it, even just like the terms open source versus free software, how there can

448
00:39:59,260 --> 00:40:08,700
be some contentiousness there. And then, you know, in my various jobs, not every manager

449
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:18,740
understands the value of open source and why it's good to contribute back. A lot of companies

450
00:40:18,740 --> 00:40:24,060
just think like, oh, we'll take from open source and we'll modify it so it meets our

451
00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:33,400
needs and then we'll kind of keep it closed. And so even just knowing that if you take

452
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:38,700
something that's under GPL and modify it, and then if a customer wants to see that code,

453
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:44,700
like you have to give it to them. I learned a lot about licenses and I mean, there's still

454
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:52,780
so much that I don't know. And then how companies can make money off of like support and other

455
00:40:52,780 --> 00:40:58,700
services or even just like bring you in with this open free product and then sell you some

456
00:40:58,700 --> 00:41:03,980
other things. So just like how people make money, how companies can make money off of

457
00:41:03,980 --> 00:41:10,540
open source, that didn't make sense to me for a long time. But now it does. And I think

458
00:41:10,540 --> 00:41:11,540
it's awesome.

459
00:41:11,540 --> 00:41:18,340
Yeah, I think you're right in that it's often misunderstood. You know, even I've run into

460
00:41:18,340 --> 00:41:24,860
that speaking, you know, when people ask me what I do on a daily basis, as soon as I introduce

461
00:41:24,860 --> 00:41:30,180
the concept of Linux and open source and how that works for those who are interested enough

462
00:41:30,180 --> 00:41:35,860
to want to learn a little bit more, often that's the question that guests ask is, well,

463
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:42,820
okay, if you're giving this stuff for free, how does anybody make money? I get that often.

464
00:41:42,820 --> 00:41:49,740
And I think you're probably right, like having a deep understanding of that realm and the

465
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:57,700
history to it and the social aspects that are connected to these topics really gives

466
00:41:57,700 --> 00:42:05,820
you a perspective on why the work you're doing is important to you, but also why it's important

467
00:42:05,820 --> 00:42:13,320
to share it. And so do you find that that's something that allows you to kind of venture

468
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:19,180
on and do the hard work and to inspire you to continue to push yourself?

469
00:42:19,180 --> 00:42:25,580
Absolutely. Even just knowing that any code I put out there is going to be possibly viewed

470
00:42:25,580 --> 00:42:33,260
by, you know, hundreds or maybe even thousands of people. It drives you to write more readable,

471
00:42:33,260 --> 00:42:39,980
more maintainable, nicer code, not necessarily more efficient code, but I am all about communication.

472
00:42:39,980 --> 00:42:47,700
So yeah, definitely more readable code for sure. I've tried to explain it to people like

473
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:52,420
my parents and they still don't get it. So I think I still need to work on my communication

474
00:42:52,420 --> 00:42:57,420
about that specifically. It is kind of a hard topic for some people.

475
00:42:57,420 --> 00:43:03,540
In open source, we tend to be quite giving. How does that compare to the scientific community?

476
00:43:03,540 --> 00:43:11,140
When you're doing research, it's free flowing amongst your colleagues, but there are going

477
00:43:11,140 --> 00:43:19,980
to be rivalries in any area of the sciences. And so of course you want to kind of keep

478
00:43:19,980 --> 00:43:29,420
your research details from them while being, you know, so there's definitely some reflection.

479
00:43:29,420 --> 00:43:36,060
I think the open source community is more giving, more open. It's all open. That's what

480
00:43:36,060 --> 00:43:42,860
it's about. It's got open in the name. There's no like open science, open physics.

481
00:43:42,860 --> 00:43:51,140
Heather, I wanted to ask you a question if you had an ask of our community, of the listeners.

482
00:43:51,140 --> 00:43:55,420
Is there something that you'd want to put to them? Something you'd like them to try

483
00:43:55,420 --> 00:43:58,380
or go and explore or maybe something to go read?

484
00:43:58,380 --> 00:44:06,740
I actually have two things. One of them is to be empathetic. It's good to do that in

485
00:44:06,740 --> 00:44:13,820
all walks of life, but when you're opening bug reports, and I hope that if any listener

486
00:44:13,820 --> 00:44:18,700
finds a bug or find something that even just doesn't seem right, they're not sure it's

487
00:44:18,700 --> 00:44:26,120
a bug, just file a bug. But when you file a bug, try and think about the person that's

488
00:44:26,120 --> 00:44:33,540
going to receive that and kind of, you know, add things to the bug report that you would

489
00:44:33,540 --> 00:44:40,660
need if you were that person. So how to reproduce the bug. What version of the software were

490
00:44:40,660 --> 00:44:47,860
you using? Maybe what version of the operating system are you running? Any little details

491
00:44:47,860 --> 00:44:53,860
like that. People that receive bugs that, you know, it's their job to fix them really

492
00:44:53,860 --> 00:44:58,620
appreciate good bug reports. And I think good bug reports come from empathy.

493
00:44:58,620 --> 00:45:04,820
I like that a lot. I think you're right in that empathy can be applied in so many different

494
00:45:04,820 --> 00:45:11,140
areas. But in this one specifically, it reminds me of what we touched on earlier, how there's

495
00:45:11,140 --> 00:45:18,380
a human element to every side of software, even though sometimes that seems stripped

496
00:45:18,380 --> 00:45:23,500
away. But yeah, bringing empathy to the person who's trying to help you get rid of the bug

497
00:45:23,500 --> 00:45:31,820
in the future. Sounds super powerful and reminds me of bringing solutions to a problem instead

498
00:45:31,820 --> 00:45:33,860
of just problems to a problem.

499
00:45:33,860 --> 00:45:40,300
Definitely. Yes, it's always good to try and offer a solution. And so my second ask would

500
00:45:40,300 --> 00:45:47,980
be a little abstract, but I think that it's always good to sharpen critical thinking skills.

501
00:45:47,980 --> 00:45:52,180
And so I would implore your listeners to go play a board game.

502
00:45:52,180 --> 00:45:53,660
I love that.

503
00:45:53,660 --> 00:46:01,740
I love board games. I play them any chance I get. So yes, please go find a board game

504
00:46:01,740 --> 00:46:03,200
and play it.

505
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:09,240
When you said critical thinking, that was not going to be the first area I expected

506
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:14,100
you to mention. But what is it about board games for you that really touches on that

507
00:46:14,100 --> 00:46:15,540
critical thinking area?

508
00:46:15,540 --> 00:46:21,460
When you play a strategy game of some sort, if you're trying to win, then you have to

509
00:46:21,460 --> 00:46:26,580
think critically about, you have to analyze, did I make the best decisions here? Even if

510
00:46:26,580 --> 00:46:35,020
you feel almost territorial of like, my strategy is the best. Well, is it though? And stop

511
00:46:35,020 --> 00:46:40,900
and think and do your best and if you win, then you win.

512
00:46:40,900 --> 00:46:45,320
Is there a game or two that you recommend that really kind of grabs you?

513
00:46:45,320 --> 00:46:52,800
So there's a game called Onitama, which is a two player chess-like game where you kind

514
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:59,480
of have pictures with little grids on them. And it tells you like how you can move each

515
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:07,140
piece. And there's five cards. So each player has two cards and there's another card. And

516
00:47:07,140 --> 00:47:11,440
whenever you play a card, then it kind of goes into this other pile and then it eventually

517
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:20,300
rotates to the other player. So that's a lot of fun. It's not super interactive.

518
00:47:20,300 --> 00:47:27,280
For a long game, my favorite game would probably be a feast for Odin, which is a worker placement

519
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:32,300
game kind of like Agricola. I also really like Norse mythology. That's kind of why I

520
00:47:32,300 --> 00:47:33,300
bought that game.

521
00:47:33,300 --> 00:47:34,300
It helps.

522
00:47:34,300 --> 00:47:42,540
Yeah, but that's actually a really good game. I have lots of games and I love to play them.

523
00:47:42,540 --> 00:47:46,780
Magic the Gathering. I'm also a big magic nerd.

524
00:47:46,780 --> 00:47:52,140
Sounds lovely. Heather, if people wanted to get connected with you, where would you like

525
00:47:52,140 --> 00:47:53,180
to send them?

526
00:47:53,180 --> 00:48:02,820
People can email me. I am hellsworth at gnome.org. I am on Twitter, although I don't make my

527
00:48:02,820 --> 00:48:08,380
way over to Twitter very often. Only when I'm procrastinating.

528
00:48:08,380 --> 00:48:09,620
For some of us, that's often.

529
00:48:09,620 --> 00:48:14,780
I know, right? Email is the best. I will answer my emails.

530
00:48:14,780 --> 00:48:19,740
Sounds great. Well, Heather, thank you so much for your time and for connecting on all

531
00:48:19,740 --> 00:48:23,420
these super fun topics. I really, really appreciate it.

532
00:48:23,420 --> 00:48:24,420
Sure. Anytime.

533
00:48:24,420 --> 00:48:38,820
Okay, great. Let's chat soon.
