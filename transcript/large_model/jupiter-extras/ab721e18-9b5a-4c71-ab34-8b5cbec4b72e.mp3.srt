00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,740
Welcome to part two of my conversation with Peter Adams.

2
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:03,860
If you haven't had a chance yet,

3
00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:05,600
take a moment and go listen to part one.

4
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:07,580
If you have already, here's side two.

5
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:19,420
So when I came back to photography,

6
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:23,460
full-time as a professional,

7
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:25,520
it was like one,

8
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:30,340
it was so high on my list of projects that I wanted to do

9
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:32,860
just because it had made such an impact

10
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:36,100
in my personal life and my professional life.

11
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:38,020
And I knew the story,

12
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:41,080
I knew the power of open source.

13
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:46,080
And I just couldn't believe that there was

14
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:50,720
effectively zero photography documenting

15
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:55,120
this amazing community of people doing this amazing work.

16
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:58,120
So that was where I dove into it.

17
00:00:58,120 --> 00:00:59,600
Yeah, the story of open source

18
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:03,440
is so much told through code.

19
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:05,960
I guess as a medium of expression perhaps,

20
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:10,960
but having other media forms capturing that same essence

21
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:16,620
is I think a nice way to fill it out a little better.

22
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:19,120
Yeah, I mean, as much as it's code and projects,

23
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:21,520
I mean, open source is really all about the people

24
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:24,180
because without the people,

25
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:26,120
there would obviously there would be no code,

26
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:28,360
but without the personal stories

27
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:33,360
of why people invest their time and energy in open source,

28
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:35,080
it's that personal experience

29
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:36,660
that leads people to open source.

30
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:41,340
That's what I found in my travels and talking to people.

31
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:44,740
People don't go into open source,

32
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:47,660
like they go into a profession saying,

33
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:51,360
oh, well, I could be a lawyer, I could be a doctor,

34
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,720
I could do open source.

35
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:53,880
That's not how it goes, right?

36
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:58,880
People are somehow there's a personal experience

37
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,840
or something that has impacted them

38
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:05,200
that has led them to open source.

39
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,200
Whenever I discover that about somebody

40
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,400
and I hear their personal story,

41
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:12,120
that's one of the most exciting things about open source

42
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:14,360
to me is just seeing the community

43
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:16,760
through that collection of personal experiences.

44
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:20,760
I would echo that completely through every single one

45
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:24,560
of the discussions that I've had here on this show.

46
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:28,640
I've discovered that every person has a story

47
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,180
of how they came to open source

48
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:32,160
or how it came into their life.

49
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,200
And they're pretty varied.

50
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:37,400
For you, that was surrounded

51
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:40,760
by quite a bit of an important piece of history,

52
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:44,080
but lots of it's in a professional setting and all of that.

53
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,280
But for many people,

54
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:51,280
it's been sort of passed on by their brother in my case,

55
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:55,000
or a friend who just suggests that,

56
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,960
no, I think you'd like this, you should check it out, right?

57
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:00,680
It's that really kind of intimate story

58
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:03,600
that we all have connected to it that I agree

59
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:08,600
is quite a powerful force and never really leaves us, right?

60
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:12,800
It doesn't, it's so weird, right?

61
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:16,600
Because I mean, there's so few things that stick with you,

62
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,320
I think, kind of like this.

63
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:20,720
I mean, yeah, you're always into things

64
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,560
and you're into certain bands or you're into certain music

65
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:27,520
or certain art or certain lifestyle

66
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,520
or whatever it is over the years,

67
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:31,880
that kind of comes and goes and fades away.

68
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:33,240
The open source stuff doesn't,

69
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:35,680
I don't ever see anybody say,

70
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:39,040
I was really into open source in the early 2000s,

71
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:42,640
but not anymore, like that has never happened.

72
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:43,840
I've never heard that.

73
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:47,960
That has never once ever been something I've ever heard.

74
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:51,120
I meet these people and I photograph people,

75
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,000
they've been doing it for 20 years,

76
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,920
they've been doing it for a decade,

77
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:59,360
or they just discovered it and it's like all consuming

78
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,040
and they've oriented their life

79
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,440
where everything is open source now

80
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:06,560
and their whole careers is geared around open source

81
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,320
and they would never work for anything

82
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:10,120
other than open source company.

83
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:12,320
I mean, it's just, it grabs you.

84
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:15,360
It's, and I think really takes hold of you.

85
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,160
I think once you embrace the philosophy,

86
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,360
it makes a lot of sense on so many levels

87
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:24,800
that people have a hard time seeing the world

88
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,680
through another lens after that, right?

89
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,320
Yeah, and I'm sure everyone listening

90
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,840
can totally relate to that feeling.

91
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:35,280
And it's also true that many who come to open source

92
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:38,960
and invest their time into making open source better

93
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:42,520
and building things tend to keep with it

94
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:45,640
until quite a late age as well.

95
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:50,200
Like you don't ever really get out of it for any reason.

96
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,040
No way.

97
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,120
It becomes a part of your personality, really.

98
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,440
Yeah, I mean, a lot of,

99
00:04:55,440 --> 00:05:00,080
look at the folks at Bell Labs that were developing Unix

100
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:03,440
in the 70s.

101
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,680
Many of them are still writing code.

102
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,280
A lot of them work at Google,

103
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:11,280
but many of them are, they're still writing code today.

104
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,480
And they've been writing code

105
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:17,480
and doing different projects throughout the decades.

106
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:19,360
That's so amazing.

107
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,600
And all open source.

108
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,920
I mean, some people have done commercial ventures

109
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:23,760
alongside of that,

110
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:28,760
but they've always contributed to a core open source project

111
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:34,000
or added to the open source corpus, if you will,

112
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:37,120
over the decades, right up till today.

113
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,000
It's amazing.

114
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,200
I hope to join that group, you know?

115
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,560
I think you and I are well on our way.

116
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,880
We're pretty big.

117
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,280
Right, we can only aspire to that.

118
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,120
Yeah.

119
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:53,480
Can I ask you some maybe a bit more challenging questions

120
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:56,680
because they're questions that I think

121
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:58,680
are around the open source philosophy

122
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:01,600
and how that integrates into our lives a little bit.

123
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,440
And certainly they are questions

124
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,600
that I've thought about lots and lots.

125
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:09,200
So you mentioned how you had

126
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:12,600
that pretty powerful experience around open source

127
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:17,600
and dedicated to always then building the future projects

128
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,600
around open source technologies.

129
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,720
And so I guess the question I have is,

130
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,080
was that a challenge for you

131
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:28,600
when you came back into photography, when you did,

132
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,920
considering that photography has been classically

133
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:35,920
such a sort of commercial software, you know,

134
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,960
it's sort of a mono crop of software out there

135
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,680
that almost every photographer uses.

136
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,120
Was that a challenge for you?

137
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,760
Oh my God, absolutely.

138
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:49,160
I mean, you know, I've been using Adobe Photoshop

139
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:51,080
since version 3.0.

140
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:53,840
And so I've kind of grown up with that.

141
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:58,000
And that's just been my way to wean myself

142
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,560
out of the dark room and off of analog tools

143
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:04,560
and into the digital world over the last decade.

144
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,040
I've never really been in a position with Photoshop

145
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:12,080
where I felt like I was hamstrung by it or locked into it.

146
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:15,000
But I would say like, that's maybe one of the only pieces

147
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,160
of software where I felt that way.

148
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:22,160
The other pieces of software, you know, oh man, absolutely.

149
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:26,200
I mean, don't get me talking about, you know,

150
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:28,880
digital asset management, you know,

151
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:33,520
like all the wasteland of software products

152
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:36,400
that I've used and I'm sure you've used over the years

153
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:40,400
trying to organize your catalog, maintain metadata,

154
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,680
publish stuff up to the internet,

155
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:46,320
you know, do specialty processing on files

156
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:49,600
or noise reduction, God, it's just,

157
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,640
I mean, I have a folder that's just like,

158
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:53,680
it's just a wasteland of stuff.

159
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,200
Like a graveyard almost.

160
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:57,280
It's a graveyard, it's a total graveyard.

161
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:00,760
And it's super frustrating.

162
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:03,080
And you know, it's like you're dealing with bugs

163
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:05,040
and there's no way, there's nothing you can do.

164
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,880
You're just, you're totally beholden

165
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:09,600
on the software company fixing it.

166
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:12,680
And I know there's, you know, now there's some good

167
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:16,840
open source tools out there, but I tend to, you know,

168
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:19,560
I think, you know, GIMP being the, you know,

169
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:23,440
probably the best one and the most well-known one,

170
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,720
I can't give up Photoshop for that.

171
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:30,720
And also I have the whole hardware lock-in problem.

172
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:33,040
I shoot with a phase one camera,

173
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:35,080
which is a digital medium format camera.

174
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:39,120
And I shoot tethered, you know, from the camera

175
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:43,520
into the computer, you know, for most of my, you know,

176
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:45,360
for all the portraits in this project

177
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,920
and most of my commercial work.

178
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:50,160
And you know, that goes into Capture One,

179
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,080
which is their software.

180
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:57,080
And you know, there's just, it produces the best results.

181
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:59,560
And now if there was an open source tool

182
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:02,480
that could seamlessly handle my phase one

183
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:06,440
and the, you know, the a hundred megapixel files

184
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:09,720
that come out of it and do it better than Capture One

185
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:12,320
in terms of image quality and workflow,

186
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,540
I would absolutely use that.

187
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:17,360
But because it's such specialty software,

188
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:22,360
no one has really, really taken that up as open source,

189
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,540
you know, at a level that, you know,

190
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:28,680
would work as a professional, you know, for professionals.

191
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:30,280
At least as far as I could tell, maybe it's out there

192
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:32,640
and I just don't know about it.

193
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,960
But that's been, yeah, that's been frustrating.

194
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:38,960
I, and I've run into tons of bugs with their software

195
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:41,840
and, you know, I know all the work arounds

196
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:44,600
and you know, it's, and I shake my head every time,

197
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,680
you know, thinking, oh God,

198
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:48,080
I just wish there was a community behind this

199
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,560
that could improve this faster, you know,

200
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:53,260
and God forbid that, God forbid they go out of business

201
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:54,960
or whatever, you know,

202
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:57,480
that's always in the back of my mind, absolutely.

203
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:01,680
I echo those thoughts completely because, you know,

204
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:06,680
the whole reason I got into open source so deeply

205
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:10,100
was a lot of the same sort of worries

206
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:11,640
that you were just mentioning.

207
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,700
You know, for a long time I started,

208
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:16,280
I guess I'm a slightly younger than you,

209
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:19,040
so I started, you know, I was doing the Photoshop 7,

210
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:23,300
which if anyone, you know, has had darkroom experience

211
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:26,440
and has used Photoshop around that time

212
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:30,320
or even earlier as you did, it's an amazing gift.

213
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:34,020
Like the things you can reproduce digitally

214
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:38,520
that you could accomplish previously in the darkroom,

215
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:42,720
just the ability to sort of repeat those steps digitally

216
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,480
so you can create, you know, the same effect

217
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:50,480
on a series of photographs is like a kind of mind blowing

218
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:53,640
for photographers who've started in the film industry

219
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:56,480
or the film era, I should say.

220
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:59,520
And so I don't disagree that Photoshop

221
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:03,160
is an absolutely amazing thing for sure.

222
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:06,440
And that's why, you know, not quite 90%,

223
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:08,560
but it feels like 90% of photographers

224
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,320
end up using it at some point.

225
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:14,600
But for me, so I had, you know, tons of experience

226
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:17,560
doing that on Windows and Mac as well,

227
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:20,640
and certainly used some phase one products

228
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:24,800
and Hasselblad stuff, and so you kind of realize

229
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:29,800
that it's quite a commercial industry

230
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:32,480
around the whole photography industry.

231
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:36,560
And that's great because it has really come a long way

232
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,740
very quickly if you look at all the technologies

233
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:42,040
that have had to come in place to make the images

234
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:43,240
that we can create now.

235
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:45,460
You know, you're talking 100 meg files like it's nothing,

236
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:47,400
but that was a big feat, right?

237
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:48,240
Oh, it's huge.

238
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:52,340
And the quality coming out of it is like really unbelievable,

239
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:55,320
you know, before you used to have to shoot 8x10

240
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,820
to get anything close to that.

241
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:01,960
And so I'm not suggesting at all that Photoshop

242
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:04,400
and the phase one products and all of the commercial stuff

243
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:08,000
is not great because it is.

244
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,080
But what worried me for a long time,

245
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:12,100
once I sat down and started thinking,

246
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:15,000
okay, if I'm gonna run my photography business

247
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:19,620
for a few decades, how are these things

248
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:21,320
gonna start affecting me?

249
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:23,640
And it was similar to the experiences

250
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:27,280
that you had early in the tech industry

251
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:30,820
was that anyone can change anything

252
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:33,440
and you have little control over it.

253
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:36,400
So that is the kind of the thought process

254
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:39,360
that threw me into open source

255
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:44,300
and gave me the challenge of trying to create

256
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:46,720
a photography workflow that's 100% open source

257
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:50,840
that would not compromise too much the end product

258
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:53,800
that I was trying to create, especially for clients.

259
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:56,200
And is Photoshop part of that workflow for you

260
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:59,080
or have you managed to wean yourself off of Photoshop

261
00:12:59,080 --> 00:12:59,920
as well?

262
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:04,920
I've managed to create a 100% open source workflow,

263
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:07,520
which is no small thing, like you're saying wow,

264
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:08,360
because you know what?

265
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:10,320
That's super impressive.

266
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,280
You know what goes into it.

267
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:14,280
But it's not without its compromises, right?

268
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:17,440
Like software like the GIMP or Krita

269
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:21,080
are really impressive, you know,

270
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:23,520
the minds that have gone into making that.

271
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:24,920
I can't even imagine how many hours

272
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:27,200
went into creating that kind of stuff.

273
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:30,540
And yet, just because of the nature of it,

274
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:31,880
they're implementing features all the time,

275
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:33,640
but it's still not at the same place

276
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:35,920
that some of the commercial software is, right?

277
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:36,760
And you know that well,

278
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:39,080
you're using this stuff on a daily basis.

279
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:42,460
And so it has its compromises.

280
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:43,800
I would say the piece of software

281
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:46,000
that's made it all happen for me

282
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,800
is a piece of software called Darktable

283
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:53,800
that has come a long way in the last seven or so years.

284
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:59,160
And I would say now I end up spending 70% of my time there.

285
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,240
Interesting.

286
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:04,840
And for anyone who knows photography software,

287
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,880
it's much like Lightroom.

288
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:10,640
It's almost like a Lightroom analog or alternative,

289
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:14,200
but not all photographers can accomplish what they need to

290
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,380
in that one piece of software,

291
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:18,360
because it's designed to accomplish, you know,

292
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:21,640
a certain workflow and it'll get you so far.

293
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:23,320
I wonder if it, does it, do you know,

294
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,040
does it handle phase one files?

295
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26,520
Do you know?

296
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:28,280
I don't know it, but I have a feeling

297
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:29,740
that you and I after this conversation

298
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:31,200
might dive in and go learn that.

299
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,640
Yes, I think I may.

300
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:35,560
I think on my wish list is to have a conversation

301
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:38,560
much like this with some of the people there

302
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:41,700
who are creating Darktable and have dedicated

303
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:44,360
to making that wonderful piece of software.

304
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:49,360
But yeah, maybe it is the next step for you

305
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:52,520
in sort of pushing those beliefs.

306
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:54,300
But I really don't know.

307
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:57,800
I mean, the phase one stuff is pretty specialized.

308
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:02,760
I know it's easy enough for people in open source

309
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:06,080
to sort of deconstruct, you know,

310
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:08,680
files from Canon cameras and Nikon cameras,

311
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:11,320
because there's a huge user base, right?

312
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:13,120
But I really don't know what it's like

313
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,220
for the phase products, for instance,

314
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:17,600
but hopefully there's some incentive.

315
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,920
Yeah, I mean, I'll take a look at it.

316
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,880
I mean, I think it's gonna happen for me

317
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:26,880
where I think the open source tools will at some point

318
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:30,680
have, you know, the critical mass of features

319
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:34,980
that I need and rely on, and I could start to use those.

320
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:37,720
Because I mean, Photoshop is adding features

321
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:40,080
at such a rate, you know, and features

322
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:41,320
that I just don't use.

323
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:42,160
Fair enough.

324
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:46,080
This is the whole like Microsoft Word thing all over again,

325
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:49,100
where, you know, you buy it because it's a word processor,

326
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:51,240
and then it's, you know, a to-do list,

327
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:53,240
and then it's a publishing, you know, platform,

328
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:55,200
and then it's a collaboration platform,

329
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:58,640
and it's all this stuff that is not a word processor anymore.

330
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:02,360
And that's when you just go to, you know,

331
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:04,120
an open source, you know, word processor,

332
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:08,120
because you only need 10 features to do, you know,

333
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:10,840
to write your manuscript, and you don't need, you know,

334
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:15,360
the monolith that the commercial product has become.

335
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:18,320
And I think the same thing is gonna happen

336
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:21,480
probably with Photoshop, maybe with Darktable as well.

337
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:24,200
Maybe that's the project that really, you know,

338
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:27,600
makes it happen on the digital side.

339
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,640
Actually, these days, I think about that a lot less

340
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:33,040
just because I find that the software, you know,

341
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:37,120
for me is working, and I don't have as many issues there.

342
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:40,560
I'm particularly excited about for, you know,

343
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,920
in the photography world, for open source to come in

344
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:47,160
and just completely devastate what's happening

345
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:51,400
are camera operating systems and lighting control.

346
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:54,080
Yes, absolutely.

347
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:57,480
I cannot wait for somebody to,

348
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:01,480
and I have seriously considered doing this myself,

349
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:06,480
starting a lighting comp, like a lighting company

350
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:10,200
around commodity lighting

351
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:13,520
with open source software running it.

352
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:16,480
Because there are so much

353
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:20,120
that I want out of my lighting, you know, equipment,

354
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:22,000
and to be able to do,

355
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,120
that I wanna be able to program my lighting equipment

356
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:26,520
to do certain things.

357
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:29,200
Because, you know, like this project is a great example.

358
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,480
You know, it's a six light setup.

359
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:33,200
It's not the same light for everybody

360
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,280
because you have to look at that,

361
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:36,520
but, you know, it's largely, you know,

362
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:38,800
the same distance from the backdrop.

363
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:41,520
And, you know, you're using a similar modifier

364
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,920
to make it consistent.

365
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:47,480
And, you know, it's just like just getting your lights

366
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:51,920
to respond in a consistent, repetitive way.

367
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:54,440
And you're, you know, with the radio slaves

368
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:59,440
and triggering and all of that stuff is super funky.

369
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:02,120
It's just so funky.

370
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:03,760
It always has its problems.

371
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:06,240
And I think the skill of being a photographer

372
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,960
is to always be dealing with those curve balls,

373
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,360
you know, in real time.

374
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:11,200
Totally.

375
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,720
And you have a catalog of things that could go wrong

376
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:15,160
at any one point.

377
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,720
You have a catalog of things that go wrong

378
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,600
and you have like three backups.

379
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:21,000
You know, like I have like three sets of radio slaves,

380
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,680
like from three different vendors, like.

381
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:24,520
Yeah.

382
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,640
And it's just like, and you have to,

383
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,800
because you could get into a position where like,

384
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:33,560
oh, well, you know, the Profoto Air is being blocked by,

385
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:37,600
you know, you're in a studio or you're in a stadium

386
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,840
and, you know, there's lots of other radio going on

387
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:40,680
and it's interfering.

388
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:41,840
So you gotta have a pocket wizard.

389
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:43,360
So you have to do that.

390
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:45,800
And it's just like getting all this shit to work.

391
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:48,400
And then like the rate of features

392
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:53,400
that are not coming out from these vendors is so painful

393
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:55,320
because you just see it and you're like, oh my God,

394
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:59,240
please, please let me control the lighting temperature

395
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:00,080
within the light.

396
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:03,120
Like, please make it possible

397
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:06,200
for me not to have to cart around gels.

398
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:10,440
Like, I know it exists on like the, you know,

399
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,560
hot light side, but like on the strobe side,

400
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:14,080
please let me have that.

401
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:16,920
So, and even the camera, like phase one is wonderful.

402
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,840
And they put out a lot of great features

403
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:21,960
and phase one is kind of a specialized platform.

404
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:24,520
But there's little things that I know

405
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:26,920
like would be really good ads.

406
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:29,400
And why can't I write that code

407
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:31,560
and put that in my camera, right?

408
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:35,320
And that's the area, camera and lighting,

409
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:40,120
to me that is the most frustrating right now, at least.

410
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:42,960
And I really hope, you know, if somebody came along,

411
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,440
if anybody's listening and they wanna start

412
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:49,360
an open source professional photographer strobe company,

413
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:52,880
you know, hit me up because I just think it would be,

414
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:55,240
it would be so impactful.

415
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:57,280
I know so many photographers that would be like,

416
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,680
oh yes, please, let's please do that.

417
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:03,040
Well, you know, I've got my hand up

418
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:08,040
and I know a few people who know a lot about technology

419
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:12,520
and are really passionate amateur photographers

420
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:15,200
and really good, my friend Alex,

421
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,440
who also hosts, self-hosted here

422
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:18,680
on the Jupiter Broadcasting Network.

423
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:22,800
He's a massive photographer and very interested

424
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:25,720
and I'm sure he would have his hand raised as well.

425
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:27,400
So I feel like, you know,

426
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:29,360
the beautiful thing about photography is,

427
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:30,920
at least I'll speak for myself,

428
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:33,720
is that it can be very technical

429
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:38,600
in a way that someone who easily latches

430
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:42,520
onto the computer worlds can also appreciate.

431
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:45,160
Like that for me was a really nice,

432
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:48,720
not transition, but those two exist at the same time,

433
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:51,160
but also a really nice way to be creative as well.

434
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:54,760
So I know a lot of people who do coding

435
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:58,120
or are involved in tech and IT somehow

436
00:20:58,120 --> 00:20:59,960
who are also just in love with photography.

437
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:02,320
So I feel like you might be surprised

438
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,920
with how many people hit you up with that offer, you know?

439
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:05,800
It's so necessary.

440
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:07,440
I mean, also, and you look at like what's happening

441
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:11,920
in the smartphone photography world

442
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:15,240
with all the sort of algorithmic photography,

443
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:16,760
you know, that's starting to happen now.

444
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:18,200
All the algorithms that are at work,

445
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,800
every time you press the shutter button

446
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:21,800
on your iPhone or your Android,

447
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:23,640
you know, it's taking seven pictures

448
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:26,120
and averaging the exposure and applying a sharpening

449
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:28,840
and, you know, stitching things together

450
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:32,280
and doing a long exposure and blending and filtering.

451
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:33,640
You know, it's like the algorithms

452
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:35,840
that are at work there are amazing.

453
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:39,600
And Google and Apple have some of the best

454
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,880
software engineers in the world.

455
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:44,920
They have a little bit of a corner on that talent.

456
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:48,520
And I worry that some of these other camera companies,

457
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:50,800
you know, that may not be able to get,

458
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:53,960
you know, may not be able to access that talent,

459
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:54,960
how do they compete?

460
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:58,840
You know, like how do they stay abreast

461
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:01,960
and get access, you know, to the best tech

462
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:05,000
and the best programmers or the best innovations?

463
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,160
And to me, it's so obvious that it's open source.

464
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,320
It's out there.

465
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:12,160
So there's so many open source developers

466
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:15,360
that are also, you know, into photography

467
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:18,720
and could be contributing to these areas

468
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:21,680
that if any of these companies opened up their platforms,

469
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:23,040
even the slightest bit,

470
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:25,480
I mean, even if it wasn't just like a totally,

471
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:26,840
you know, open source OS,

472
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:29,240
although I think phase one,

473
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:30,680
I think when you start the camera,

474
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:32,600
you're actually booting a Linux kernel.

475
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:34,200
I wouldn't be surprised.

476
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:37,040
Yeah, and I think the same is on Hasselblad

477
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:38,280
and some of these other ones.

478
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:40,960
You know, if the startup time is more than like a second,

479
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:43,880
I think you're actually booting into Linux.

480
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:46,160
And that's not a dig on Linux.

481
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:48,880
That's just to say there's like a full blown OS.

482
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,400
Yeah, there's a whole operating system

483
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,040
booting in a few seconds, right?

484
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:53,320
Which is amazing, right?

485
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:54,680
And that's so cool.

486
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:57,080
So like, can we please open that up?

487
00:22:57,080 --> 00:23:01,380
Like, because there'd be a flood of talent and innovation

488
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:03,460
that would go into the space

489
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:06,000
in a way that would be so phenomenal.

490
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,800
And I just think like, that may be more impactful

491
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:14,800
even than the sort of image processing and manipulation side

492
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:18,600
just because so much can happen in the camera

493
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:20,740
and between the lights these days.

494
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:23,760
That's my personal preference.

495
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,920
If somebody is listening out there is working on it,

496
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:29,080
please let us know because we're ready for that.

497
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:29,920
Absolutely.

498
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:33,560
And it feels like then it's a bit of a dream

499
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:37,240
that I've had as well to accomplish,

500
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:38,780
just to grow the dedication I've had

501
00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:43,360
to creating an open source post-production process,

502
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:46,320
but to open that up into the entire pipeline, right?

503
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:51,320
From Capture to lighting to sort of printing as well.

504
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:56,360
So I would love to dedicate my life to making that happen.

505
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:58,400
I'm totally into that.

506
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,800
So it's gotta happen.

507
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:00,960
I mean, I'm a little afraid

508
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:03,720
that like there's this giant sucking sound into my iPhone

509
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:07,800
and that like 10 years from now everything may,

510
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:11,120
we may, you and I are gonna pack up our equipment

511
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:14,280
and go on a job and it's gonna be,

512
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:16,000
consist of six iPhones

513
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,720
and a whole bunch of lighting equipment.

514
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:22,520
But so I'm a little worried that photography,

515
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:27,520
there's this giant sucking sound into the mobile platforms.

516
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:32,520
But there are laws of physics that are at work that-

517
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:35,600
Thank goodness they're on our side.

518
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,560
That are on our side in terms of just,

519
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:40,400
you wanna have a certain amount of image quality

520
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:43,640
in a certain size, you've gotta have glass,

521
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:45,640
that's gotta have a sensor of a certain size

522
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:47,520
and you gotta have glass that's a certain size.

523
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:51,600
And so I think there's always gonna be camera companies

524
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:56,480
that are gonna be servicing videographers and photographers.

525
00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:01,480
And I just wish that one of them would realize

526
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:04,400
that they can make it a competitive advantage

527
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,720
to be open source,

528
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:09,880
as opposed to keeping this whole proprietary arms race

529
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:14,320
that's been going since the beginning of time

530
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:16,760
and use open source as a competitive advantage,

531
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:18,360
be the open source camera company,

532
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:20,560
be the open source lighting company,

533
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:23,280
or at least have an open source component.

534
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:26,440
Because I just think like they'll run away with the market.

535
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:28,280
Everybody, nobody wants to be locked

536
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:29,600
into these proprietary systems

537
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:32,360
that are so slow in the photography world.

538
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:35,520
I mean, nobody I've ever met has been like,

539
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:38,600
you know what, I'm really, really happy

540
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:41,240
with the way the menuing system works on my Sony,

541
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:44,800
or I'm really, really happy with the way

542
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:49,800
my Profoto light works with this trigger or that trigger.

543
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:53,120
I mean, I've never heard that before.

544
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:55,280
Never, it hasn't happened, so.

545
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:57,000
Well, I think some people listening to this

546
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,440
will certainly point us towards

547
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:00,920
some of the open source firmware

548
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:05,480
that was able to be loaded onto certain camera,

549
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:07,600
certain Canon cameras.

550
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:08,720
I don't know if that's still true,

551
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:13,600
and I haven't really owned any Canon cameras.

552
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:15,080
I know, me neither.

553
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:16,840
But when I heard about that,

554
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:18,800
and I've certainly seen it in action,

555
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:20,400
and I've done some research around it,

556
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,240
it was really exciting for all of the reasons

557
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:23,600
that we're talking about here.

558
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:26,800
Oh, I remember that, and I was so, so excited about that.

559
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:30,600
And then I was like, I just don't own any Canon gear,

560
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:31,880
you know, so.

561
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:33,640
That's how I felt.

562
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:37,520
But it feels like, geez, that would be a nice place to go.

563
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:40,920
And this conversation is reminding me a little bit

564
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:45,120
about what's happening in the hardware sphere

565
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,720
around computers themselves, you know?

566
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:50,560
There are a few open hardware vendors

567
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:54,080
kind of trying their very best to make a difference

568
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:56,400
out there, but it's not an easy place, right?

569
00:26:56,400 --> 00:27:01,040
It's dominated by lots of really big commercial giants.

570
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:05,200
Yeah, and also, I know you know this,

571
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:08,280
photographers don't have any time to really,

572
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:11,320
I mean, you and I, we would love to burn a weekend

573
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:16,320
on this problem and working around something on our own

574
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:19,840
and scratching our own itch.

575
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:23,160
But, you know, there's many months where we just don't,

576
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:24,620
we're not gonna have that time, right?

577
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:27,600
So the equipment has to work, it has to be bulletproof,

578
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:29,360
it has to be supported.

579
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:31,840
And I think, you know, every time I say that,

580
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:36,440
I just have these flashbacks to my son, Oracle,

581
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:39,680
you know, EMC storage days and thinking the same thing,

582
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:40,520
right?

583
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:41,360
Of course.

584
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:43,020
And I just know how that story ends.

585
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:45,520
And I know that this is, you know,

586
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:47,840
this is exactly the same, you know,

587
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:50,480
this is exactly the same issue, just with a completely

588
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:52,120
different technology domain.

589
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:54,040
So it's gonna happen here.

590
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:56,760
It's just a question of who's gonna do it and, you know,

591
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:59,620
and when, and if it's one of the existing manufacturers

592
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:04,480
that, you know, becomes enlightened and gets the religion

593
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:08,520
or whether a new manufacturer is gonna come along and-

594
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:09,360
And change the game.

595
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:11,800
Use open source and change the game, right?

596
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:15,240
And that'll be super exciting.

597
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:18,240
You know, either way, I'm good either way.

598
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:20,080
But I just hope somebody does it soon.

599
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:23,600
Well, yeah, I hope you and I are both around to see that.

600
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:26,960
For sure, we need it sooner than later, I feel like.

601
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,080
I know.

602
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:29,640
In terms of photography,

603
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:33,580
have you put any thought around the emergence

604
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:37,060
of some of this artificial intelligence stuff

605
00:28:37,060 --> 00:28:40,560
in developing, you know, portraits and things like that?

606
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:43,680
Cause I've heard a few stories recently

607
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:47,680
of AI creating some really interesting,

608
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:51,760
at least I very much hesitate to call them portraits

609
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:55,600
for an obvious reason, which is that I don't want to equate

610
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:59,320
them to the craft that you and I spend all of our time on,

611
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:02,340
but there's some interesting stuff happening out there.

612
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:03,400
I mean, I haven't really.

613
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:05,600
I mean, you know, the closest I come is, you know,

614
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:06,880
on the iPhone with, you know,

615
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:10,240
all the portrait lighting effects that Apple introduced

616
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:13,040
and, you know, all the algorithms that are at work

617
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:15,200
and even, there's some good algorithms actually,

618
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:19,280
even on the phase one now for long exposures

619
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:21,480
and things like that, but in terms of AI,

620
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:25,680
in terms of stylistic preferences or things like that,

621
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:29,280
I haven't really delved into that.

622
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:31,920
What have you been seeing that has been intriguing you?

623
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:35,000
Well, yeah, I think where I'm going with this is,

624
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,240
you know, artificial intelligence has been really impressive

625
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:40,640
in many areas and digital photography,

626
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:44,440
if you look at it, is just, it's really just, you know,

627
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:47,040
you and I are taking real life and digitizing it

628
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:50,160
in some ways, if you look at it through that lens.

629
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:52,340
And so some might argue that you can create

630
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:56,160
that digital version from scratch using some intelligence

631
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:57,600
instead of real life.

632
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:01,480
And so the way I've been thinking about it is in terms

633
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:05,720
of what is the future of photographers and photography.

634
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:08,960
And I don't know that that's coming soon,

635
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:12,000
but if we're peering into the future,

636
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:16,320
maybe 20, 30 years or so, you know,

637
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:18,740
I'm just throwing a number out there, but what do I know?

638
00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:23,640
It feels like crafted images coming out of some,

639
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:25,680
you know, a few algorithms, at least,

640
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:30,080
I see it kind of in the sphere of stock photography first.

641
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:32,200
You know, you have a lot of photographs

642
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:37,200
that are not necessarily tied to a specific person

643
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:41,300
or individual, but are really useful

644
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:42,620
for a bunch of other reasons.

645
00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:45,340
And so I've been just seeing artificial intelligence

646
00:30:45,340 --> 00:30:49,620
as a really interesting expansion

647
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:52,460
of who we are as photographers.

648
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:56,700
And it both intrigues me and scares me at the same time.

649
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:57,540
No, totally.

650
00:30:57,540 --> 00:30:58,860
I mean, what was that project?

651
00:30:58,860 --> 00:31:00,480
Was it the research group?

652
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:02,100
Was it Samsung or?

653
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:05,460
I forget which research lab came out with like the ability

654
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:10,460
to create portraits of like fake people

655
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:14,100
from photographs of real people?

656
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:15,300
Oh man, yeah, right.

657
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:20,300
Like, it was like these incredible like, you know, photos

658
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:22,580
that you weren't like, oh, that's like a Photoshopped photo.

659
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:24,880
It was like, no, that's like a real person,

660
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:26,380
but that person actually doesn't exist.

661
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:29,400
It's the eyes from one person and the hair from another

662
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:31,660
and the facial structure from a third.

663
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:33,780
And, you know, the algorithms are able

664
00:31:33,780 --> 00:31:37,060
to produce these lifelike, you know, very real,

665
00:31:37,060 --> 00:31:40,580
photorealistic, you know, images of people

666
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:41,840
from the source material.

667
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:43,620
I think that's fascinating.

668
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:46,700
And I think, you know, from an artistic standpoint,

669
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:48,840
I mean, there's tons of photographers today

670
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:52,680
that are doing so, you know, incredible photo manipulation.

671
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:56,460
And, you know, I think that there'll be a whole realm of art,

672
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:58,960
you know, much like the, I don't know how familiar you are

673
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:03,960
with the whole processing space, all the generative art

674
00:32:04,420 --> 00:32:09,420
that's being generated using JavaScript and, you know, data

675
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:15,260
and using programs like P5.js and processing.js

676
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:20,620
that are doing all this sort of like algorithmic artwork

677
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:22,660
all from data, which is,

678
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:25,380
I'm personally super fascinated by that.

679
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:29,140
So I think it'll be, I think it's gonna happen.

680
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:33,440
How will it aid us as professionals?

681
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:39,300
You know, ego-wise, you know, I don't, you know,

682
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:41,620
I want to think, oh, well, you know,

683
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:43,100
damn algorithm's never gonna do better

684
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:45,660
than you and I are gonna be able to do it.

685
00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:48,380
But I think that, you know, the AI will, you know,

686
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:51,680
be really helpful in automation.

687
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:54,780
I mean, I personally, I would like to just be able

688
00:32:54,780 --> 00:32:58,120
to go into a shoot and open up a case,

689
00:32:58,120 --> 00:33:02,420
have five drones pop out and, you know, the AI is like,

690
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:03,800
oh, you wanted Rembrandt lighting?

691
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:05,380
Great, let me get in position.

692
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:08,380
You know, like to me, that's what I want.

693
00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:10,980
That's a, you know, I could see that being like

694
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:13,420
super impactful, but I'm still driving the boat, right?

695
00:33:13,420 --> 00:33:16,300
I'm still saying, oh, Rembrandt lighting or, you know,

696
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:19,380
or, you know, put a flag over there and-

697
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:21,620
You're automating your photography assistants.

698
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:23,180
Yeah, exactly.

699
00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:26,420
I may be more like a little bit more like machine learning

700
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:27,900
where the algorithm's like,

701
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:31,060
oh, Pete likes his flags on the right, not the left.

702
00:33:31,060 --> 00:33:33,300
You know, like stuff like that, I could be,

703
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:35,820
I could see that being like really super helpful.

704
00:33:37,020 --> 00:33:39,480
But, you know, maybe it gets to a place where, you know,

705
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:43,180
you and I are, you know, deploying the algorithms

706
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:44,060
and not much else.

707
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:46,620
I don't know, it'll be interesting to see.

708
00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:48,420
Well, I think it's interesting to look at it

709
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:52,300
as a toolkit really, which is what you alluded to there

710
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:55,780
is, you know, the cameras in our hands

711
00:33:55,780 --> 00:33:58,580
and the software that we throw those images into

712
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:01,540
and even, you know, the printers and all of that stuff,

713
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:04,740
they're just tools to allow us to be expressive.

714
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:09,460
And so as our tools evolve, so too do our expressions.

715
00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:14,260
And so those of us who I think are keen to stay

716
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:19,260
with those leaps in technology kind of get to create

717
00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:21,540
in a totally different way.

718
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:24,140
If we're willing to bring those things in,

719
00:34:24,140 --> 00:34:27,620
some people unfortunately get caught up in, you know,

720
00:34:28,780 --> 00:34:30,220
it's almost seen as a rivalry, you know,

721
00:34:30,220 --> 00:34:32,940
when new innovative tools like that come into play.

722
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:35,780
But if you're open to them, man, can you create

723
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:37,900
some really different things or approach, you know,

724
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:39,820
typical problems in a really different way?

725
00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:42,060
Yeah, I mean, I think you're totally right with that.

726
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:45,780
And I think maybe, you know, the place that that comes in

727
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:47,700
first is in post-processing, right?

728
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:52,700
Because I mean, if we had an AI that could go through,

729
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:57,940
you know, a thousand layered Photoshop files

730
00:34:57,940 --> 00:35:02,940
and know all of the layered edits that I typically do

731
00:35:03,620 --> 00:35:05,580
or you typically do on your portraits

732
00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:09,340
or, you know, on certain types of events or whatever it is,

733
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:12,860
it's absolutely possible for an AI to learn, you know,

734
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:15,940
your style, learn Peter's style, learn Brent's style.

735
00:35:15,940 --> 00:35:17,500
And welcomed, I would say.

736
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:18,660
Exactly, right?

737
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:22,620
Because so much of that is a, you know,

738
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:24,500
it's an iterative process, yes,

739
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:28,300
but there's a style that you have as a photographer

740
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:32,140
that comes out, there's a thread through your post-processing

741
00:35:32,140 --> 00:35:33,700
of everything you do,

742
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:35,220
just like there's a thread through mine.

743
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:38,740
And so to have an AI be able to pick up that thread

744
00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:42,740
and learn that thread so that it can apply it for you

745
00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:47,300
without you having to do 60 edits over two days

746
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:49,780
because you gotta think about it more.

747
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:51,220
And if the AI is like, look,

748
00:35:51,220 --> 00:35:53,500
I know tomorrow you're gonna wake up and think this is crap.

749
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:56,660
So, you know, I'm gonna delete these four layers

750
00:35:56,660 --> 00:35:57,900
and I'm gonna add these six

751
00:35:57,900 --> 00:36:01,340
because you really liked these in the last hundred edits.

752
00:36:01,340 --> 00:36:04,940
I can see that, that can be kind of cool.

753
00:36:04,940 --> 00:36:08,340
For those who don't know photography quite that much,

754
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:11,660
like capturing photographs with your camera

755
00:36:11,660 --> 00:36:14,840
is definitely quite obviously a really important part of it,

756
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:19,380
but the editing after the fact is almost 50% of it,

757
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:22,420
I would say, you know, you need both to be great,

758
00:36:22,420 --> 00:36:24,020
but there's such a creative expression

759
00:36:24,020 --> 00:36:25,540
in that process as well.

760
00:36:25,540 --> 00:36:26,780
Oh, totally, totally.

761
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:30,060
Yeah, if we continue with this imagination that you have

762
00:36:30,060 --> 00:36:34,660
where that process can be captured and repeated easily,

763
00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:36,660
maybe you'll agree with me, but I won't speak for you,

764
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:39,900
but I would totally welcome sitting at my computer less

765
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:43,020
and being out into the world capturing photographs more.

766
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:46,700
If I could be certain that the output was still

767
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:49,620
within the realms of the kind of things that I love,

768
00:36:49,620 --> 00:36:50,820
I would totally welcome that.

769
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:53,460
You know, just as a professional photographer,

770
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:55,580
you're always managing your time

771
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:59,740
and so many of your shoots and your projects

772
00:36:59,740 --> 00:37:01,660
and the way you schedule your time

773
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:04,080
is all around trying to find efficiencies, right?

774
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:07,940
So, you know, let's shoot a collection of subjects together.

775
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:10,500
Let's do the capture, you know, on the same day

776
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:12,820
in the same studio, bring everybody in

777
00:37:12,820 --> 00:37:14,740
because we can just keep shooting

778
00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:16,420
and we don't have to, you know, start and stop

779
00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:17,260
and things like that.

780
00:37:17,260 --> 00:37:18,360
And the same with post-processing,

781
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:21,360
like then let's have a week where we just go through

782
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:23,200
and do all the post-processing together

783
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:24,780
and make it consistent.

784
00:37:24,780 --> 00:37:28,580
So it's a huge consideration, you know,

785
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:30,240
on what you're trying to do, you know,

786
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:32,420
to get this, you know, to manage your time

787
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:37,420
and apply your style and effectively batch up your work

788
00:37:37,420 --> 00:37:40,420
so that you can get some kind of efficiency on it.

789
00:37:40,420 --> 00:37:42,620
So yeah, an AI could change that game.

790
00:37:42,620 --> 00:37:45,900
I mean, that could be, that would be super welcome.

791
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:48,660
You wouldn't be locked in your studio, you know,

792
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:51,260
for a week after a shoot, you know, just doing editing.

793
00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:53,300
You could actually be shooting every day

794
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:55,820
and the computer could be applying your style for you.

795
00:37:55,820 --> 00:37:56,660
That would be awesome.

796
00:37:56,660 --> 00:37:58,260
And if you grow that a little bit

797
00:37:58,260 --> 00:38:03,260
and see it as open-source AI, if we can build such a thing,

798
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:06,260
man, those, those kinds of things are awesome.

799
00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:08,560
Man, those, those kinds of preferences and scripts

800
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:10,580
can be shared around and modified and combined

801
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:11,420
and all of that stuff.

802
00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:13,300
It would be a really, quite a wonderful

803
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:14,900
creative exercise, really.

804
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:16,020
Yeah, no, I think so.

805
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:18,240
I mean, there's, you have like a hint of that right now

806
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:21,460
with the sort of like recipes and Lightroom.

807
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:23,140
I don't know if Darktable has a similar thing,

808
00:38:23,140 --> 00:38:27,180
but like people sell, you know, like Lightroom presets

809
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:29,820
and Photoshop filters and, you know,

810
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:33,500
the sort of Instagram filter, you know, effect.

811
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:36,620
But, you know, that's just like, that's like a blunt

812
00:38:36,620 --> 00:38:38,340
instrument, you know, I mean, we're, you know,

813
00:38:38,340 --> 00:38:41,940
with an AI would come in and be like, you know,

814
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:44,940
being able to apply selective contrast to different parts

815
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:47,820
of a face because it just knows like,

816
00:38:47,820 --> 00:38:49,940
you like more contrast over here.

817
00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:53,220
That this specific person needs this specific, yeah.

818
00:38:53,220 --> 00:38:54,300
Exactly.

819
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:55,900
So it's coming, I'm sure of it.

820
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:57,460
Oh man, you're getting me all excited.

821
00:38:57,460 --> 00:38:58,300
I know.

822
00:38:58,300 --> 00:39:00,820
I mean, we just hope, hopefully it'll be open-source

823
00:39:00,820 --> 00:39:04,740
and not some proprietary black box.

824
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:07,140
Yeah, not a fan of black boxes.

825
00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:08,780
No, black box is not so good.

826
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:11,380
I've been, I feel like I've been trying to rub, you know,

827
00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:13,820
paint off the side of black boxes for a long time.

828
00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:17,780
You mentioned that in the past,

829
00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:19,140
you've been to a few conferences.

830
00:39:19,140 --> 00:39:22,820
Do you have any lined up yet where you're hoping to be

831
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:24,760
capturing a few of these photographs?

832
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:29,760
This year, I'm just thinking the one that is closest out

833
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:32,000
is the Red Hat Summit,

834
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:35,000
which this year is actually gonna be in San Francisco.

835
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:38,280
I photographed, I had a great time two years ago.

836
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:42,760
I did a whole bunch of photography around that conference.

837
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:45,960
And so I hope to do that one again this year.

838
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:49,440
The folks at All Things Open are super supportive

839
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:51,080
and they've invited me.

840
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:52,440
I've shot there a couple of years ago.

841
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:53,400
They invited me last year

842
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:55,760
and they've kind of given me an invitation

843
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:57,040
for this year as well.

844
00:39:57,040 --> 00:40:01,080
So, or hopefully I can do that conference again.

845
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:02,880
That's sort of at the end of the year.

846
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:04,200
The middle, I'm not sure yet.

847
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:05,600
That's, we'll see.

848
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:09,360
But those two are ones that I kind of have penciled in,

849
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:11,600
you know, my calendar as placeholders right now.

850
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:15,420
I was just speaking, I mentioned my friend Alex earlier.

851
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:18,600
He's a Red Hat employee.

852
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:22,840
And so he, I guess he does a little bit of everything.

853
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:24,880
He's kind of one of those amazing people.

854
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:28,080
But he was talking about Red Hat Summit

855
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:29,640
and how great it is.

856
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:31,760
But he was also in the same breath mentioning

857
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:34,960
All Things Open and how that's kind of in his backyard

858
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:37,660
and was mentioning how maybe I should join him there too.

859
00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:40,720
So maybe if the stars align, you and I might get to meet.

860
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:41,980
Ooh, that would be awesome.

861
00:40:41,980 --> 00:40:44,560
Perhaps at All Things Open, which would be a real treat.

862
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:48,000
That's I think in October, if I remember correctly.

863
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,600
Yeah, it's like, it's towards the end of the year now.

864
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:51,440
Yeah.

865
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:53,920
It's always a, I try to do like a New York,

866
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:56,520
you know, tack it onto a New York trip.

867
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:57,780
Since you're in the neighborhood, yeah.

868
00:40:57,780 --> 00:40:59,040
It's just a question of, you know,

869
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:00,760
making the logistics happen.

870
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:03,320
It's all logistics, yeah.

871
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:04,920
It's all logistics.

872
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:06,400
Well, that would be really exciting.

873
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:07,520
I think it would be a real treat

874
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:10,480
for those who get to see some of your work

875
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:12,500
either exhibited at some of these,

876
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:15,040
if you get that opportunity or even just the chance

877
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:19,200
to photograph a few more pioneers in open source.

878
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:20,280
Can't wait to see those.

879
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:21,640
Yeah, I mean, that's the beautiful thing

880
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:23,960
about this project is there's so,

881
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:25,620
open source is such an evolving thing

882
00:41:25,620 --> 00:41:28,120
and there's so many new projects,

883
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:30,980
new contributions, new applications.

884
00:41:30,980 --> 00:41:33,400
So it's, there's always,

885
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:35,560
I'm always finding out about new people

886
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:38,560
and new contributions.

887
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:41,200
And I have, you know, I have a running, you know,

888
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:43,800
huge research list of hundreds of people on it

889
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:46,400
that I'm constantly, you know, reviewing

890
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:50,060
and trying to find people to photograph, so.

891
00:41:50,060 --> 00:41:52,040
Great, yeah, it sounds like you won't soon run out

892
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:53,480
of great people to photograph.

893
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:56,440
No, no way, not with this community.

894
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:59,640
It's just a, it's a burgeoning community, so.

895
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:01,240
That's amazing to hear, great.

896
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:04,520
I wanted to ask you a question

897
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:07,440
that you might wanna send out to the communities

898
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:09,200
and to the listeners.

899
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:12,800
Is there something that you would like listeners

900
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:16,120
to think about or to try or go and see something

901
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:19,100
you'd like them to experience, anything at all?

902
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:21,520
I would say, you know, there's probably two things

903
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:23,320
that I've been, you know,

904
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:26,400
particularly interested in most recently.

905
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:28,720
You know, the first one I actually mentioned already,

906
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:33,720
which is the whole generative art category

907
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,080
where people are using these open source tools,

908
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:38,500
mostly around processing and JavaScript.

909
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:42,760
And there's a library written by Lauren McCarthy,

910
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:44,520
who's an artist out here in LA,

911
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:48,000
and she created this tool called p5.js.

912
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,520
And it's just so cool, and it just,

913
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:52,840
it's used to create all this like really cool

914
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:56,120
algorithmic art and visualization work.

915
00:42:56,120 --> 00:42:58,920
And there's a whole community of artists,

916
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:01,720
and her artwork also is particularly,

917
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:04,120
and her projects are particularly cool.

918
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:07,320
So I would encourage everybody to check out Lauren's work,

919
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:12,320
Lauren McCarthy, and p5.js, and just that whole world.

920
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:15,840
You could just, you could burn an afternoon easily

921
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:17,160
just diving into that.

922
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:19,120
You might have just scheduled in an afternoon

923
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:20,600
for me this week.

924
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:21,520
Yeah, exactly.

925
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:23,760
It's just like, it's like open source art,

926
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:26,720
and you know, data visualization, JavaScript,

927
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:30,580
it's got a lot, there's a lot there, a lot there to like.

928
00:43:31,820 --> 00:43:35,060
The other thing that I've been really interested in recently

929
00:43:35,060 --> 00:43:40,060
is open access data, and sort of open data movement

930
00:43:41,460 --> 00:43:44,720
in general, you know, and I photographed some folks

931
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:49,360
from Wikipedia, but you know, the work that Carl Malamud

932
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:54,360
is doing around making the law accessible is fascinating.

933
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:58,680
Like I never really knew this until I started digging

934
00:43:58,680 --> 00:44:03,000
into his work, but there's a lot of state law,

935
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:06,960
and like, you know, and stuff as mundane as like

936
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:11,480
building codes, and fire codes, and stuff like that,

937
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:15,320
that is locked behind like paywalls.

938
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:18,280
That seems unbelievable because those are expected

939
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:21,120
to be followed by masses of people.

940
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:22,920
And they are, and because of that,

941
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:24,800
there's wonderful businesses out there

942
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:29,800
that are able to extract, you know, hundreds or thousands

943
00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:34,340
of dollars for access to basically the law,

944
00:44:34,340 --> 00:44:38,560
essentially to the law, and he has just, you know,

945
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:43,560
been a crusader on getting that all of this,

946
00:44:43,880 --> 00:44:48,000
you know, legal documents and the law online,

947
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:52,360
freely accessible, you know, re-keyed in, typed in,

948
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:56,200
you know, he's like, he's got lawsuits and stuff before,

949
00:44:56,200 --> 00:44:58,080
you know, the US Court of Appeals,

950
00:44:58,080 --> 00:45:00,440
that people have tried to stop him.

951
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:02,520
His website is just fascinating.

952
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:07,520
And I mean, so I would encourage people to dig into him,

953
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:13,760
and his website, which is public.resource.org,

954
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:15,720
and just learn about kind of what he's doing

955
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:18,440
and support him because in this day and age

956
00:45:18,440 --> 00:45:22,760
where institutions are, you know, especially in the US here,

957
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:24,680
but I think really around the world in general

958
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:29,680
are under a lot of pressure, and the rule of law

959
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:32,360
is under a lot of pressure, you know,

960
00:45:32,360 --> 00:45:35,440
what can we do to help, you know, bolster democracy

961
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:40,040
and access to the law and strengthen our civic,

962
00:45:40,040 --> 00:45:41,380
you know, institutions?

963
00:45:41,380 --> 00:45:43,120
I think his work is more important now

964
00:45:43,120 --> 00:45:44,560
maybe than ever before.

965
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:46,360
So I would encourage people to check him out too.

966
00:45:46,360 --> 00:45:51,360
I think that's another Saturday you could easily burn

967
00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:55,920
on digging into his work in that whole world.

968
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:58,200
Wow, that sounds like someone who's dedicating their time

969
00:45:58,200 --> 00:46:03,200
to that kind of challenge, so worthwhile,

970
00:46:04,080 --> 00:46:07,320
and sounds like such an important area

971
00:46:07,320 --> 00:46:08,800
for all of us to benefit from.

972
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:11,360
Yeah, and it's even more impressive.

973
00:46:11,360 --> 00:46:14,920
He's doing it around the world, so it's not just in the US.

974
00:46:14,920 --> 00:46:17,480
He's also, he was just in India.

975
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:20,480
I think he's also doing it for the government there.

976
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:24,600
So it's a global crusade, if you will,

977
00:46:24,600 --> 00:46:27,120
and I think he's really at the forefront of this.

978
00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:30,120
So it's definitely worth taking a look at his work

979
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:31,720
and digging into that website.

980
00:46:31,720 --> 00:46:34,160
Yeah, and it sounds like work that feels like we need more

981
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:36,240
now around the world than ever really

982
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:41,160
with things going digital and some of the unfortunate

983
00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:44,440
directions that some governments have been going with,

984
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:47,280
the data and data hoarding and protection

985
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:48,120
and that kind of stuff.

986
00:46:48,120 --> 00:46:52,040
So I really welcome that sharing.

987
00:46:52,040 --> 00:46:54,200
If you're gonna have a democracy

988
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:57,560
and you certainly want the law to be accessible, right?

989
00:46:57,560 --> 00:47:02,560
So it seems obvious, but it's, but it's not, it's crazy.

990
00:47:04,520 --> 00:47:07,120
Carl knows that better than anybody, I think, so.

991
00:47:07,120 --> 00:47:09,680
Oh man, I wonder what inspired him

992
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:11,200
to kind of dedicate his time to this.

993
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:14,480
That would be an equally great chat, I think.

994
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:16,560
He has a fascinating story and it goes back,

995
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:18,920
like I won't spoil it as you dig into it,

996
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:22,760
but it goes back to the early days of commercial internet,

997
00:47:22,760 --> 00:47:27,760
the nineties getting the SEC Edgar filing database online.

998
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:30,680
And so it's, he's got a really rich history

999
00:47:30,680 --> 00:47:31,760
doing this for a long time.

1000
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:33,840
So it's cool stuff.

1001
00:47:33,840 --> 00:47:35,640
It reminds me of some of the work that's happening

1002
00:47:35,640 --> 00:47:39,960
like at the EFF and the Software Freedom Conservancy

1003
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:44,040
and those kinds of organizations that I think often

1004
00:47:44,040 --> 00:47:46,320
we just take for granted that they exist.

1005
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:49,540
And yet I think we shouldn't, like they're doing work

1006
00:47:49,540 --> 00:47:53,140
that probably a lot of us hold dear to our hearts

1007
00:47:53,140 --> 00:47:55,560
and really believe in, but just don't have the time

1008
00:47:55,560 --> 00:47:57,880
or the expertise to do ourselves, right?

1009
00:47:57,880 --> 00:48:01,640
So we gotta support these organizations

1010
00:48:01,640 --> 00:48:03,860
and these people as much as we possibly can.

1011
00:48:03,860 --> 00:48:06,380
Yeah, I mean, the two biggest ones

1012
00:48:06,380 --> 00:48:08,500
in the sort of open data world

1013
00:48:08,500 --> 00:48:10,640
and sort of open knowledge access,

1014
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:13,280
Wikipedia is just incredible, obviously.

1015
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:15,480
That's the one that everybody knows.

1016
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:17,640
The Internet Archive also, I mean,

1017
00:48:17,640 --> 00:48:20,240
people have probably interacted with the Internet Archive

1018
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:22,560
through the Wayback Machine and looking for,

1019
00:48:22,560 --> 00:48:24,280
you know, I was looking for a webpage

1020
00:48:24,280 --> 00:48:26,680
that no longer exists anymore maybe,

1021
00:48:26,680 --> 00:48:30,360
but, or your high school MySpace page

1022
00:48:30,360 --> 00:48:34,080
or whatever it is that you're trying to find from,

1023
00:48:34,080 --> 00:48:37,280
you know, make sure is or is not accessible.

1024
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:41,480
But the Internet Archive also has all this amazing,

1025
00:48:41,480 --> 00:48:43,960
they have an entire scanning operation

1026
00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:45,960
and they're scanning in books,

1027
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:48,680
they're scanning in recordings from,

1028
00:48:48,680 --> 00:48:52,480
lifted from 45, you know, vinyl.

1029
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:56,500
I mean, it's just, it's incredible the archive,

1030
00:48:56,500 --> 00:48:58,000
you know, what's in that archive,

1031
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,920
the classic computer games,

1032
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:03,280
which is actually one of my favorite console games,

1033
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:06,400
you know, that used to play in the arcades,

1034
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:08,680
you know, those are all accessible in the Internet Archive.

1035
00:49:08,680 --> 00:49:10,880
And it's just, this stuff is, you know,

1036
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:15,680
as wonderful as the web is the one thing,

1037
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:19,040
you know, that is not built into it is archival.

1038
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:23,400
So, you know, the web is constantly growing and dying

1039
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:24,920
and parts of it are fading away.

1040
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:27,960
And the Internet Archive is kind of, you know,

1041
00:49:27,960 --> 00:49:31,640
has stepped in and really is the mechanism

1042
00:49:31,640 --> 00:49:34,360
that is filling that gap.

1043
00:49:34,360 --> 00:49:36,200
But it's also the mechanism filling that gap

1044
00:49:36,200 --> 00:49:39,360
for the world's libraries with books that are out of print.

1045
00:49:39,360 --> 00:49:40,760
Public domain and all of that.

1046
00:49:40,760 --> 00:49:44,800
Yeah, and not just that, but also software as well,

1047
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:46,600
old software.

1048
00:49:46,600 --> 00:49:48,480
So it's fascinating.

1049
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:50,440
You could spend an entire, you know,

1050
00:49:50,440 --> 00:49:51,600
way more than a Saturday,

1051
00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:53,480
you could spend your whole weekend in the Internet Archive

1052
00:49:53,480 --> 00:49:56,140
or your whole month in the Internet Archive.

1053
00:49:56,140 --> 00:49:58,300
But I just think like those things are,

1054
00:49:58,300 --> 00:50:00,760
they're a little bit of the personification of open source,

1055
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:02,920
like not just from the data,

1056
00:50:02,920 --> 00:50:04,840
but also a lot of the technology

1057
00:50:04,840 --> 00:50:07,400
that's used to operate all that stuff is, you know,

1058
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:09,260
there's open source underneath all that too.

1059
00:50:09,260 --> 00:50:12,240
So it's an accessible thing for a lot of people

1060
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:13,880
can really wrap their head around it.

1061
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:15,000
Aren't we lucky?

1062
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:15,840
That's cool.

1063
00:50:15,840 --> 00:50:16,680
That's cool stuff.

1064
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:21,920
Have you considered doing a self-portrait of yourself

1065
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:24,120
for this Faces of Open Source project?

1066
00:50:24,120 --> 00:50:26,040
Because it sounds like you're an important piece

1067
00:50:26,040 --> 00:50:26,920
of that as well.

1068
00:50:26,920 --> 00:50:28,760
That's a great question.

1069
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:31,120
I have not considered doing that.

1070
00:50:31,120 --> 00:50:32,060
Would you?

1071
00:50:32,060 --> 00:50:35,040
I would consider it, but you know,

1072
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:37,960
I would say I'm slightly uncomfortable

1073
00:50:37,960 --> 00:50:40,080
in terms of my contributions

1074
00:50:40,080 --> 00:50:42,640
compared to the contributions of the people

1075
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:45,200
that are being photographed.

1076
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:47,480
You know, so much of, you know,

1077
00:50:47,480 --> 00:50:50,180
I try hard as a photographer

1078
00:50:50,180 --> 00:50:54,420
not to insert myself into the story, right?

1079
00:50:54,420 --> 00:50:57,460
Just cause I think it changes the story.

1080
00:50:57,460 --> 00:50:59,440
And I realize in this case, you know,

1081
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:02,680
there's some open source, you know,

1082
00:51:02,680 --> 00:51:04,640
nature to what's happening here.

1083
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:08,600
But for the most part, it's a documentary project.

1084
00:51:08,600 --> 00:51:12,040
And, you know, just like a documentary filmmaker

1085
00:51:12,040 --> 00:51:12,960
wouldn't write themselves

1086
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:15,920
into the script of a documentary necessarily,

1087
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:20,920
unless you're Werner Herzog or, you know,

1088
00:51:22,600 --> 00:51:24,640
certain documentary filmmakers do do that.

1089
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:25,480
And it works out.

1090
00:51:25,480 --> 00:51:28,940
Michael Moore and folks do a great job of doing that.

1091
00:51:28,940 --> 00:51:33,360
I haven't felt like I would add anything

1092
00:51:33,360 --> 00:51:36,480
to the project by being a part of it.

1093
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:37,320
But I have to admit,

1094
00:51:37,320 --> 00:51:39,680
I've never really spent a lot of time considering it.

1095
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:41,220
I appreciate your perspective there

1096
00:51:41,220 --> 00:51:46,200
because when you said inserting yourself into it

1097
00:51:46,200 --> 00:51:49,880
changes the project, I think you're completely right.

1098
00:51:49,880 --> 00:51:52,920
There is, I think as you know,

1099
00:51:52,920 --> 00:51:55,200
there are many photographers in the industry

1100
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:58,880
who sort of lead with ego first

1101
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:03,000
and that often is attractive and useful in many ways

1102
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:04,540
and yet changes the work, right?

1103
00:52:06,080 --> 00:52:10,820
And if you are trying to be a bit more documentary in nature

1104
00:52:10,820 --> 00:52:14,140
and complimentary to the people in front of the camera,

1105
00:52:15,360 --> 00:52:17,240
instead of focusing on yourself,

1106
00:52:17,240 --> 00:52:19,160
I could see why that would change things.

1107
00:52:19,160 --> 00:52:21,680
So your answer is making me reflect

1108
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:25,320
even more on my question, which is a good sign.

1109
00:52:26,520 --> 00:52:29,360
So yeah, I appreciate that answer for sure.

1110
00:52:29,360 --> 00:52:31,440
It just changes the dynamic a little bit.

1111
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:32,280
Certainly.

1112
00:52:32,280 --> 00:52:33,760
You know, I'd have to think about it more,

1113
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:37,720
but I've never considered doing that for other projects.

1114
00:52:37,720 --> 00:52:41,560
I think, you know, if it was, you know, if I was

1115
00:52:41,560 --> 00:52:45,120
a significant contributor to some massive open source thing

1116
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:46,680
and, you know, or something like that

1117
00:52:46,680 --> 00:52:48,740
and the fact that I was included

1118
00:52:48,740 --> 00:52:51,220
made the project possible or something like that,

1119
00:52:51,220 --> 00:52:54,040
then maybe, but I don't think any of that

1120
00:52:54,040 --> 00:52:56,760
is happening here with this project.

1121
00:52:56,760 --> 00:52:58,440
Well, I think what's interesting

1122
00:52:58,440 --> 00:53:01,920
and really what the crux of my question was

1123
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:04,120
is just to sort of nudge you

1124
00:53:04,120 --> 00:53:05,700
towards a little bit of self-reflection

1125
00:53:05,700 --> 00:53:09,200
and to acknowledge that the project you're doing here

1126
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:12,080
is really important and it's a bit of a gift

1127
00:53:12,080 --> 00:53:13,860
to the open source community

1128
00:53:13,860 --> 00:53:17,480
and there's real personality in those photographs

1129
00:53:17,480 --> 00:53:19,800
and I think that's what really drew me to them.

1130
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:23,360
You know, I've looked at a number of photographs in my day

1131
00:53:23,360 --> 00:53:26,600
and the thing that attracted me

1132
00:53:26,600 --> 00:53:28,120
to the series you've created is that

1133
00:53:28,120 --> 00:53:31,320
you can read the person's personality

1134
00:53:31,320 --> 00:53:34,560
in each of the photographs that you've done of them

1135
00:53:34,560 --> 00:53:38,480
and that is not always that straightforward

1136
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:40,340
or that easy to accomplish

1137
00:53:40,340 --> 00:53:42,120
and so browsing through the photographs,

1138
00:53:42,120 --> 00:53:44,720
even if you don't recognize the people,

1139
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:47,120
it's really fun to go through

1140
00:53:47,120 --> 00:53:51,200
and see sort of the different types of personalities

1141
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:54,160
that are included in this wild and crazy thing

1142
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:55,460
we call open source,

1143
00:53:56,360 --> 00:54:00,560
but also you get to sort of click on these faces

1144
00:54:00,560 --> 00:54:01,860
and learn about the people

1145
00:54:01,860 --> 00:54:05,860
and be surprised about where they've put their time

1146
00:54:05,860 --> 00:54:07,960
and how much history they may have

1147
00:54:07,960 --> 00:54:12,960
or how young they might be and are totally diving in.

1148
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:16,680
So it felt to me, at least when I've been going through it,

1149
00:54:16,680 --> 00:54:18,860
and it takes a few sessions because there's a lot of them,

1150
00:54:18,860 --> 00:54:22,960
but it feels like a total ride and an education

1151
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:27,000
in just everyone who's made what we're living possible.

1152
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:30,040
So I found it really super fun, super entertaining.

1153
00:54:30,040 --> 00:54:32,360
So from that angle too, yeah.

1154
00:54:32,360 --> 00:54:33,200
Yeah, thank you.

1155
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:36,040
I love hearing that

1156
00:54:36,040 --> 00:54:40,000
and so glad that you're digging it.

1157
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:43,080
It is fun to learn about the people I try to include

1158
00:54:43,080 --> 00:54:45,820
and the captions that we do,

1159
00:54:46,680 --> 00:54:51,680
something also about the person's extracurricular activities,

1160
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:52,920
if you will,

1161
00:54:52,920 --> 00:54:54,920
because what's also really interesting

1162
00:54:54,920 --> 00:54:56,440
about the people in the project

1163
00:54:56,440 --> 00:55:00,720
is that a good number of them

1164
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:03,160
do way more than just open source, right?

1165
00:55:03,160 --> 00:55:06,440
Like they may have a whole nother superpower

1166
00:55:07,320 --> 00:55:10,320
that is not even, you would never think,

1167
00:55:10,320 --> 00:55:15,320
whether it's Ken Thompson invented Unix with Dennis Ritchie,

1168
00:55:15,600 --> 00:55:19,960
but Ken is also an accomplished pilot.

1169
00:55:19,960 --> 00:55:21,420
Yeah, one thing I've mentioned here before

1170
00:55:21,420 --> 00:55:24,400
is what I'm really fascinated in

1171
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:25,880
and that you're discovering as well

1172
00:55:25,880 --> 00:55:30,480
is that juxtaposition between all of a person's experience

1173
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:32,520
and the contributions they make

1174
00:55:32,520 --> 00:55:34,880
to a great number of areas in life, right?

1175
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:37,440
And that's what makes us all quite unique

1176
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:40,960
and I feel really fascinating.

1177
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:44,240
Every single person has this quite interesting story to tell

1178
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:47,440
and you're helping to tell that in a little way.

1179
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:50,640
Peter, if people wanted to get connected with you

1180
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:53,320
or I guess to see some of these photographs,

1181
00:55:53,320 --> 00:55:55,480
where would they go for that?

1182
00:55:55,480 --> 00:55:58,560
I mean, the best place to view the project is online

1183
00:55:58,560 --> 00:56:03,560
at facesofopensource.com and all the portraits,

1184
00:56:04,020 --> 00:56:05,320
I put all the portraits up there

1185
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:07,840
and you can kind of click through the slideshow of them all

1186
00:56:07,840 --> 00:56:11,480
with the captions and there's links there

1187
00:56:11,480 --> 00:56:14,800
back to my professional photography website as well.

1188
00:56:14,800 --> 00:56:17,440
So if you wanna see more photography,

1189
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:19,900
there've been some interesting sort of adjunct projects

1190
00:56:19,900 --> 00:56:22,000
that have come out of this that I have

1191
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:26,420
on my peteradamsphoto.com website.

1192
00:56:26,420 --> 00:56:28,080
Yeah, I was digging into those a little earlier.

1193
00:56:28,080 --> 00:56:31,220
There's one on printed circuits,

1194
00:56:31,220 --> 00:56:33,680
which is really, it's like portraits of circuit boards,

1195
00:56:33,680 --> 00:56:36,200
which is really fabulous and really interesting.

1196
00:56:36,200 --> 00:56:38,480
Yeah, we can talk for another hour about that.

1197
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:41,400
Well, Peter, thank you so much for connecting with me

1198
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:44,640
and for chatting about some of your life's experience

1199
00:56:44,640 --> 00:56:46,640
in open source and this photography project.

1200
00:56:46,640 --> 00:56:48,360
It's been really fun.

1201
00:56:48,360 --> 00:56:50,320
Hey man, thank you for having me

1202
00:56:50,320 --> 00:56:54,240
and it's been an honor to spend some time talking to you.

1203
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:55,080
Well, thank you.

1204
00:56:55,080 --> 00:56:57,200
Yeah, and hopefully maybe we get to meet

1205
00:56:57,200 --> 00:56:59,080
at some of these conferences at one point.

1206
00:56:59,080 --> 00:57:00,120
That would be a real treat.

1207
00:57:00,120 --> 00:57:01,800
Yes, let's make that happen.

1208
00:57:01,800 --> 00:57:03,200
Yeah, that'd be amazing.

1209
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:04,040
Thanks, Peter.

1210
00:57:04,040 --> 00:57:24,040
Thanks, Peter.
