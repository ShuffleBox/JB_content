1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
I'm starting to learn Python because I thought it might be a useful thing.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,600
It is a useful thing. What's your use case? You got any ideas?

3
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:11,920
Well, I think that's the best question of them all. I don't have a well-defined use case,

4
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:18,240
but what I'm what I've been looking at this week is what are the general use tools in the world of,

5
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:23,360
you know, what we're doing that might be good to know even just a little bit about. So have just

6
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:27,760
a base knowledge about Ansible, for instance, have a base knowledge about Python, have a base

7
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:32,720
knowledge about Git, because I think Git is fabulous. I'd like to know a little bit more

8
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:37,280
about it, but I don't have an everyday use for it yet. But how do you build in an everyday use for

9
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:42,000
it if you don't even know what it's capable of? So it's more of like dipping the toe in and seeing

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,280
what it might be able to do for me. And Python seems like an easy place to start. It's useful

11
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:52,720
for a bunch of different types of problems. Relatively easy to learn, it seems. And Wes has

12
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:58,400
like tons of advice for that. So he and I were going off yesterday with he's like, oh, you should

13
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:04,800
try this, too. Oh, and if you need a repl, try this repl. It's really great. And we yeah, he's

14
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:10,000
such a great resource. So anyways, that's great. Yeah, that is great. Even if I do nothing with it,

15
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,240
this whole process is fun. I encourage this. I think that is really great. I think just getting

16
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:17,920
a base understanding of that kind of stuff is really is super beneficial. Kind of get a better

17
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:21,920
understanding of the language, too. Yeah. And you never know when you're going to come across a use

18
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:28,880
case for Python. Last night, I was reviewing different applications to extract information

19
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:34,800
from the Starlink dish. And there's a huge Python library somebody's created that essentially

20
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:39,840
handles all of the interfacing with the dish. And you just pass this thing a simple request.

21
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:45,600
And that Python library does all of the complicated back end communications to Dishy.

22
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:49,760
And, you know, there I am just randomly looking at tools to pull off pull off stats.

23
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:53,600
And, you know, going down a Python rabbit hole. So it happens all the time. Well,

24
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:58,960
and that's kind of what I've noticed is that a lot of these, like, do it yourself kind of

25
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:03,920
micro hacks, maybe I'll call them tend to be written in Python, because it's just like,

26
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:10,720
seems like it's relatively easy to get into. It's extensible, obviously, which you were just saying

27
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:16,960
someone wrote a module for it. And, and it seems pretty ubiquitous, depending on the types of

28
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:21,120
problems you're solving, whether it's I guess, it's used a lot in the gaming industry quite a

29
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:26,800
bit. And also in machine learning stuff. So everywhere, dude, everywhere, everywhere. Well,

30
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:32,320
ansible on the back end is Python. So I thought, well, geez, like, some of the best tools out there

31
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:36,320
are using Python to do things. So maybe I can get a basic understanding of it just to.

32
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:42,480
But I do now that I'm talking about it with you, which is always helpful. I'm noticing a trend in

33
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:47,200
these things I'm trying to learn, which is automation. Ansible has a way of automating things.

34
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:52,880
Python is a way of automating stuff. Git can help you automate a bunch of things. So maybe that's

35
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:57,600
where I'm headed. I could see that. I could see that's a good area to get into. It's a bigger and

36
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:01,680
bigger area as infrastructure gets bigger and bigger. I think personally, even I'm just getting

37
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:07,280
tired of re remaking all my infrastructure from time to time. So yeah, there's that too, huh?

38
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:12,160
Yeah. Well, the whole NixOS challenge, you know, changed my way of seeing the world.

39
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,400
Office hours with me, Chris.

40
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:26,640
Hey, welcome into the office. Make yourself comfortable. Twice a month. I open the doors

41
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:31,520
up and I let the people in. And of course, Brent, he's always here, too. He's got himself his own

42
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:36,160
little seat. Hey there, Brent. Well, hello. That's cozy in here this week. I appreciate

43
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:41,520
you making it cozy. Well, you know, you take the time. You like the fire. The stuffed animals are

44
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:45,840
a nice touch. Is the bunk bed a little bit too much? No, man. We'll take a nap after the show.

45
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:51,200
I think it's going to be great. So I appreciate it. We got a packed show today. In fact, I just

46
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:56,400
kind of decided to just I just struck a few things from the from the show notes. Just had to make

47
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:03,360
room. I had to make room because I wanted to start with your recent experience about trying to

48
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:10,480
improve your network connectivity, because you're out in what basically would be the idyllic scene

49
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:16,160
setting for like a movie that takes place in the mountains with beautiful scenery,

50
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:21,360
just gorgeous, gorgeous atmosphere. But unfortunately, kind of tricky for high speed

51
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:27,200
Internet. And that is a constant thing that we're battling with. And so you did some what?

52
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:31,040
What, some upgrades? I think you better start from the beginning and kind of explain to us how you

53
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:34,080
get connected to the Internet and then tell us what you did to fix it and upgrade it.

54
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:40,000
You know what I mean? I do. Yeah. So just picture a little cabin tucked away

55
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,640
somewhere in the Canadian Rockies. And I'm living on a property with my brother. So he has a house

56
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:53,600
maybe 100 paces that way. And so the way we get Internet is, hmm. It's like Starlink before

57
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:59,760
Starlink came. So there's a tower on the mountain that you could see out in the field over there.

58
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:05,200
So we get wireless point to point connectivity, line of sight kind of stuff to the other mountain

59
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:09,600
on the other side of the valley. Now, is this a it's like an actual Wisp,

60
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:14,960
a business or is this like an acquaintance? It's a business, thankfully. They were recently bought

61
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:20,080
out. So there's a lot of confusion on their end as far as which customers should be getting what.

62
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:25,200
Luckily, that's playing in our favor in this case. But they've just basically forgot about us for a

63
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:31,840
long time. And so when I moved here, I thought, oh, geez, I'm used to like fiber is what I used

64
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:38,960
to have. And so I knew it would be a compromise being here. And it was OK, like I could do most

65
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:43,040
things. It's not the first time I've lived in the middle of nowhere trying to run off

66
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:46,880
cell signal or something like that. The downside, I think here as well,

67
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:53,840
is that my cell reception is equally bad. So it was fine. Everything was fine. We were doing

68
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:58,480
all of our shows, Chris, through audio and everything seemed fine. And then a few weeks ago,

69
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:04,000
we decided to jump to doing some fun video stuff. And that's when I think we really started testing

70
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:09,120
my network because it didn't really have to work very hard before. And now it's really cooking.

71
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:16,240
And I came to the realization that my network just wasn't going to cut it. It was fine in the

72
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:22,160
evenings to like, you know, stream TV shows at like 480p or something. But this is not good

73
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:27,280
enough, I think, especially when I'm now uploading a bunch of video to you. And my upload is like

74
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:32,560
a tenth of what the download is. So it was a pretty, pretty bad shape. So it's been about

75
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:38,960
two years that my brother and I have been wanting to perform upgrades because the little dish that's

76
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:47,120
hanging off of his roof when the installer put it in. They did an extremely bad job.

77
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:52,000
Oh, go figure. I'm going to describe it to you and you can feel badly for me.

78
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:58,080
So the tower is on the west side of the house, but the dish for some reason was placed on the

79
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:02,880
east side of the house because that was the easiest way to lay out cables on the exterior

80
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:06,320
of the building. You know, these installers, they just drill holes in your building and they just

81
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:14,720
run wires wherever they want. But also the the mast that they placed the dish on was just too

82
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:19,840
short for the like the incline of the roof. So the the dish itself was actually pointing

83
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:28,960
at the metal roof trying to reach the basically the the the mass that's on the mountain over there.

84
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:34,000
But it couldn't aim low enough because, you know, there's a valley between us. It couldn't aim low

85
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:39,040
enough. So it was like bouncing off of the metal roof to try to get signal. You were never going

86
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:44,880
to get what you were paying for ever with that. No, no, not even close. And we knew that we knew,

87
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:48,320
OK, this is a terrible setup. It can only get better from here. But we you know,

88
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:52,960
you got to climb on the roof and we had to come up with a way of extending the mast as well.

89
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:59,600
So it took us about two years to have a great enough reason to do that. And thankfully,

90
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:05,120
JB toying with video was the the reason. And so we got on the roof the other day.

91
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:09,920
We got on the roof the other day. Well, we got on the roof the other day.

92
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:14,320
And luckily, we had thought about this and had some parts. So we bought an extension

93
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:19,280
to put on the mast. And when I moved to this cabin, it had a do you remember satellite dishes?

94
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:24,240
Everybody had them to get like fancy TV back in the day. Well, there was one hanging off this

95
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:29,120
cabin. And so I was able to take the mast from that, get a grinder, cut it in half and just take

96
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:35,840
the vertical section of it. And we had a union and connected that to the existing mast for the

97
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:41,760
Internet dish. So we were able to raise it about two feet, which is great. But,

98
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:44,880
you know, this is a really sensitive piece of equipment. You just can't just take it off,

99
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:48,640
throw it on and expect it to be pointed at the right place. It's very, very directional.

100
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:57,120
So luckily, we were able to call the Wisp, the ISP, and got the best guy on the phone ever.

101
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:02,720
It was like some surfer dude guy that's usually out in the field making doing installations and

102
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:07,680
stuff. And he's just like, Hey, how can I help you? He's like, Oh, yeah, I'm usually in the field,

103
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:12,400
but I just happen to be in the office today and nobody else is around. And so I could totally

104
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:17,040
help you guys if you want, like, what do you need, like an hour of my time or something? Is that

105
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:22,400
about what you need? So it was great, because he as an installer could totally visualize exactly

106
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:25,840
what we were doing, you know, hanging off the roof, trying to trying to do all this stuff. And

107
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:30,800
he could guide us and be like, No, no, just do, you know, let's, let's use this method to try to

108
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:35,520
point the satellite and stuff. And and the other great thing was that he was able to give us in

109
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:42,880
real time the signal from their antenna on the mountain. So instead of us, you know, trying to

110
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:46,240
do speed tests or something from here to try to get that data, he was able to give it to us real

111
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:52,480
time. So it was amazing. He basically gave us a baseline, which is the internet connectivity that

112
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:58,560
we had previously. And he gave us he's like, okay, we measure a bunch of stuff, but it kind of

113
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:04,080
combines it into like a quasi score. And he said, basically, you're getting like a one out of eight.

114
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:09,200
score. And if we go to a new install, to try to see if it's possible, and we get a one out of eight,

115
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:13,600
we don't give those people service, because they're not going to be happy with anything. So

116
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:20,400
you guys have been running on like our worst coverage for years. And anything we do can just

117
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:26,240
get better. Wow, in terms of speeds for our baseline during the day was the best because the

118
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:31,760
tower wasn't. I'm probably the only person using the tower during the day. At night was worse,

119
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:36,240
because you know, everybody's doing the Netflix thing or something. So during the day, I was

120
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:45,200
probably getting like 15 megabits down, and maybe one up. But in the evenings was actually the worst

121
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:51,440
because it the stability went way down. We couldn't even watch videos at 480p sometimes, like

122
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:55,280
depending on the weather and stuff like that. So he said, anything we do is just going to get

123
00:10:55,280 --> 00:11:00,480
better. So luckily, we you know, my brother and I, we got on the roof and extended this thing and

124
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:09,120
called surfer dude back and he helped us turn the dish and get it all optimized. And now, now we

125
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:15,280
have an eight out of eight signal. Whoa, which is fabulous. Well, we have we could see the tower

126
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:19,920
over there. And that's how we knew it was pointed. Our dish wasn't pointed very well, right? It's

127
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:27,040
like, well, actually, it's over there. And it's totally missing it. So we have a very good line

128
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:32,960
of sight. We just didn't have the right setup to take advantage of that. And so I think we're doing

129
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:39,200
far better now. You know, despite my getting on the roof and hanging off my fingernails for a

130
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:43,040
little bit, I didn't get any you asked me like, Oh, try to get some audio because it could be

131
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:47,520
really great. And he would have been awesome to have a little audio bite of but I gotta say I

132
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:54,640
was feeling busy on the roof doing stuff that I didn't quite get a chance to grab some so

133
00:11:54,640 --> 00:12:00,800
apologies for one there, but you use your imagination. So I will say now our speeds aren't

134
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:09,040
way like they're not magnitudes better. So I'm getting like 25 down and two up. But surfer dude

135
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:14,400
says that's pretty much their limit, which actually, we're not even subscribed to that. So he

136
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:20,000
said like, because because there was a buyout, you guys are kind of like grandfathered in you're not

137
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,280
supposed to be on that plan, but I'm just not going to touch anything. So as the instructor

138
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:26,080
he was like, I'm not going to send you to sales because they're going to catch that they're going

139
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:31,200
to change things. So I'm just gonna leave it like that. But he did say the difference for you guys

140
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:36,720
now is going to be priority. So he said, the way it works is that if you have one out of eight

141
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:42,000
signal, you're on the bottom of the list for priority traffic. And he said, now you're one

142
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,840
of the best signals on that tower. So you're going to get the best priority out of anybody

143
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:50,720
connecting. And that's exactly what we've seen super stable at any time of the day. So I think

144
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:55,040
it was totally worth it. Wow, that's interesting to the way they prioritize it, depending on your

145
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:58,080
signal, because in some ways, you'd think that people with the weakest signal would need the

146
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:04,960
most help. But nice work. You know, those things, it's like a lot of work for a, an improvement,

147
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:09,840
but not like a complete solution. Right. And of course, the tricky thing too, is you can do all

148
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:15,600
of that work, make your connection really solid, you know, your now your connection to your whisk

149
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:21,120
could be as ideal, but then there still can be issues on the land side or on a wifi side that

150
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:25,520
have to be worked out because any kind of remote constant communications, like I'm sure people that

151
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:30,320
are doing work from home have experienced this. I know I did. Wifi issues can, can, can really

152
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:36,480
plague you even with a good internet connection. I was working at a cloud guru when the very

153
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:42,480
beginnings of the work from home lockdowns started. It was super common for the first few months

154
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:48,000
that you'd always have somebody who just joined the video meeting who had really bad wifi because

155
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:53,920
they hadn't, they hadn't been doing zoom calls from home on the regular, like people who typically

156
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:57,360
work from home had, who had their whole setups already figured out. All of a sudden you had all

157
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:02,160
these folks that had done all that stuff from the office. Now all of a sudden having to do it from

158
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:06,480
home and they just found out that even though this is something that happens over and over again,

159
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:12,240
they were paying for like this great internet service. They had horrible wifi and they had to

160
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:15,840
and they kept dropping off the calls, right? And they're not even taking advantage of it.

161
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:20,320
Well, and this is true for my neighbor too. She, she pays Comcast something like 80 bucks a month

162
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:28,800
for her internet. I was over there and her wifi, her router just crashed and rebooted. And of course

163
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:33,520
her, her phone or, you know, whatever just automatically connects to the next open wifi.

164
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:39,440
Well, that's her neighbor's ring camera. That's waiting to be upset, waiting to be set up. Yeah.

165
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:45,120
Yeah. So her router crashes, then her phone connects to the next open wifi AP,

166
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:49,840
which is a ring device just waiting to be configured. And then she doesn't get any

167
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:53,200
internet even once her router comes back online because her phone doesn't switch back.

168
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,800
Oh my goodness.

169
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,000
She's like, oh yeah, it happens all the time.

170
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:59,840
For how long? That's for as long as I've had it. Yeah. I'm like, okay, all right.

171
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:01,520
That is crazy.

172
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:05,120
I just couldn't, right? But it's funny you're, you're messing around with all of this

173
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:10,480
because not just last night, I went down the rabbit hole of figuring out an extension pole

174
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:17,040
and suction cup mounts and all kinds of twist mounts to, to tie a, you know, a thing to a pole

175
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:25,200
and 3d printed Starlink adapters because I've decided I'm going to attempt to install my Starlink

176
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:30,560
via an extendable flagpole from a Harbor Freight, the 20 foot extendable flagpole.

177
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:37,040
And then I will attach industrial grade window suction cups to that and, and suction it to the

178
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:41,600
side of JOOPS with a, also a floor, a ground stand. I'm going to put the Starlink up over

179
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:46,320
JOOPS's roof that way. I've thought about different ways. I don't have a ladder to mount

180
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:51,760
the Starlink to, which is what most RVers do. But in the process of trying to figure out what my

181
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:57,120
options were for people who don't have ladders, I ended up discovering this Starlink for RVers

182
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:02,320
Facebook group, which I haven't done a Facebook group thing ever, literally ever. Well, maybe not

183
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:06,640
true. Maybe once ever. I mean, it's like, I haven't logged into Facebook. So I had to go through

184
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:13,280
this whole process of like recovering my Facebook account and identifying myself to Facebook and all

185
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:17,360
of this, just so I could get access to this resource. Oh, it was the worst man. You're

186
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:21,440
motivated. I was very motivated because I was really trying to put all this together so that

187
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:24,960
way I could hopefully get it in time for Montana. You know, cause I'm leaving for Montana and I'm

188
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:30,320
leaving for Montana in a couple of weeks and we've never really had internet where we've gone,

189
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:35,840
which has been good and bad. It's good from a turning it off for a couple of days, which I could

190
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:40,240
still do just by not turning on the Starlink, but it's bad from like a running your business

191
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:45,600
standpoint. So my thought was, is this will be the first year we go to Montana with Starlink.

192
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:50,320
And I want to have a way to get it up above tree lines because you really don't want to have

193
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:55,360
anything blocking it, or you're going to have dropped packets, anything. These posts just have

194
00:16:55,360 --> 00:17:01,360
like a lot of good information, including all these crazy ways that different people are

195
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:05,680
installing the Starlink on their mobile setups and then deploying them on the roofs of their

196
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:12,480
rigs and whatnot. Tons of inspiring stuff. So I got back on Facebook for the first time in like

197
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:18,080
a hundred years and it was arduous, but I too have been playing around with polls.

198
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:22,640
And getting up on roofs. I have more to do too. Well, you're going to have to update us on how

199
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:29,120
yours goes once you get to Bozeman. Cause, uh, I would imagine it would be pretty great if it

200
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:33,200
worked great, but I would also imagine, you know, it's not tested and you can't really test it till

201
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:36,640
we get there. So you might have to do some troubleshooting on site. Definitely one of

202
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:41,680
those things. Definitely one of those things. Well, so I wanted to talk about our peer tube

203
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:45,200
a little bit. You down for that? Oh yeah. I can't wait to hear all the stuff you guys have been

204
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:49,600
doing. I know a little bit about it, but give me, give me the meat. We mentioned it on luck. We've,

205
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:54,960
we've relaunched Jupiter dot tube and I'm coming at it with a whole new attack angle. So if you're

206
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:59,120
not familiar, we launched this about a year and a half ago and then I shut it down and I listed a

207
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:03,200
bunch of reasons why. And back then I was trying to use it for each individual show. I was going to

208
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:06,800
have a channel for every show, which needed an account for every show. And there wasn't a way

209
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:12,080
to automate it. And, uh, that was horrible. But now I've had a rethink and I've, I've decided

210
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:16,960
just using it for live and special events or maybe a special one off video production. We do

211
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:22,800
hedging for the eventuality when I shut down all of my Google accounts, but also giving us a

212
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:26,880
decentralized media distribution platform. And that's something I've been focused on a lot this

213
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:33,440
year. Decentralized community with matrix, decentralized value with boosts and decentralized

214
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:38,000
media. Now with peer tube, I think this is a big deal. Plus I figure with more people working from

215
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:43,120
home, we should probably try to have a product that addresses that crowd. Somebody who wants to

216
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:47,840
watch from their desk. Somebody also who's probably been listening for a while and maybe would like

217
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:51,280
to switch to the behind the scenes feed. And this has really just been part of something that we've

218
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:56,800
been working on since I'd say the beginning of the year. It's decentralization, decentralization of

219
00:18:56,800 --> 00:19:00,640
everything that we can that makes sense. And so, uh, and I love, I like the fact there's no

220
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:04,800
takedown bots. I like the fact that it's a free software stack. I like the idea that we have a

221
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:09,360
place. You always know you can go to, to catch an archive version of a live show if you'd like,

222
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:13,600
you know, that kind of stuff. Um, but there's, there's other motivations too. The podcasting

223
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:18,800
2.0 community is working on baking in live streaming into apps and peer tube might be some

224
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:22,800
of the plumbing that makes that possible. So I want to be there for that. I think when you add

225
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:28,400
work from home, when you add the decentralized aspect of it, when you add the kind of strategic

226
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:32,640
nature of hedging against Google and creating an outlet that's going to be able to do that,

227
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:37,280
of hedging against Google and creating an outlet that people know to go to over the years. And then

228
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:44,640
the, the long-term integration with the podcasting 2.0 apps, that was pretty good motivating. You

229
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:48,720
know, there was some, that was, that was enough, but then we got a really solid response from our

230
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:55,680
community on helping us admin it and manage it. So I'm going to be creating a matrix peer tube

231
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:59,520
room for Jupiter broadcasting, like a JB peer tube room where we can kind of organize in there.

232
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:04,000
And I'll put a link to that in the show notes for this episode. So for those of you who are

233
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,240
interested in participating, I think, you know, there's a lot of things we could talk about,

234
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:13,840
maybe opening this up to logins via some sort of OAuth or mastered on login. We could talk about

235
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:19,360
potentially limited community publishing of certain videos. I don't know about that. I don't

236
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:22,720
know. There's a lot we could discuss. I'm willing to, I'm willing to go there, but so we'll create

237
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:27,200
a separate peer tube matrix room, which we'll have linked in the show notes.

238
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:32,160
I think we should also create a, um, good hub issues for our peer tube instance. That way we

239
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:36,000
can track a bunch of stuff there. I'll have that to my docket. If you think it's a good idea.

240
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,920
Totally. Thank you. That would be great.

241
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:42,320
I was curious cause, uh, JB has done video previously. So is that going to change the

242
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:46,240
way we do things on the audio front by, by chance?

243
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:49,120
No, not this time. So that's probably the biggest difference this time around

244
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:56,160
is we're going to stick to audio first production. All our release episodes are going to be audio.

245
00:20:56,160 --> 00:21:00,960
We're all still doing multi-track recording, multi-track editing. We still have drew cleaning

246
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:06,400
this up, processing the audio, mastering and mixing it, publishing it. All of that still remains.

247
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:10,720
These are, these are going to be more like behind the scenes feeds with just a little bit extra,

248
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:15,920
because for the first 10 years of JB, I did a lot of, a lot of live switching. That's just sort of

249
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:20,400
a skillset I have. So I can, you know, we can do live switching. We can show screens. We can do

250
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:25,200
that kind of stuff without impacting the content of the audio show. That's a lot of,

251
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:29,760
that's a line that I learned a long time ago. You can mess up really easily. You can start

252
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:33,760
referencing stuff. Oh, look at this, you know, and that kind of stuff. But we learned our lesson.

253
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:39,520
You know, it's been, what, two years since the last PeerTube instance, JB PeerTube instance was

254
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:45,840
up. I was curious if you've seen improvements since then, both in, I don't know, admin user

255
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:52,000
interfaces and feature sets that are kind of tinkling your fancy, but also on the back end,

256
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:56,160
are things a little easier or different or exciting in any way? Yeah, it was almost just

257
00:21:56,160 --> 00:22:00,000
about two years ago, and I think it was two versions of PeerTube ago. So some of the things

258
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:06,080
that have been improved is the back end tooling to import videos, import bulk sets of videos.

259
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:12,640
That was a big issue of mine. And then something that I did differently is this is a live,

260
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:18,880
this is a live events and specials PeerTube instance. It's not a, every show gets published

261
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:23,040
there, PeerTube instance. It's a lot easier to manage when you don't need like eight different

262
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:27,040
accounts on this thing. When we deployed it this time, I was like, wow, this has gotten a lot

263
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:32,800
better, both on the back end, on the front end. But you know, it could just use a couple of features

264
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:39,680
and one of them, I'd really love to be able to edit a video because sometimes we start a stream,

265
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:44,000
there's 20 minutes of music, no, not really 20, but there's 10, 15 minutes of music,

266
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,320
and then the stream actually starts. Well, I could go, I could go lock that off. That'd be

267
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:52,720
nice, right? If I could just go up into PeerTube and lock that off. And then the other feature

268
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:58,560
that I really, after I deployed, I was like, God, I'd really like to have this is a permanent live

269
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:06,080
URL that you can always go to. And then the videos available on demand later at a separate new URL

270
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:12,560
and PeerTube offers one or the other. You can do a once live stream with a unique URL that's

271
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:17,840
available later, which is what we're doing, or you can do a permanent live stream that isn't

272
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:22,320
available later. It's like this URL, and it's just this is a live stream. It goes away after

273
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:29,840
you stop streaming, but it's always at that URL. Well, today, as we record version 4.2 of PeerTube

274
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:35,120
is out and they've added both those things. They've added live editing so you can go up to

275
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:40,880
an uploaded video and you can set a new start time. You can set a new end time. You can even

276
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:45,520
add an intro and outro to the video by uploading separate video files. You can even add a watermark

277
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:52,160
to the video if you want. That's now in PeerTube, which is awesome. It sounds like you weren't the

278
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:56,320
only one who wanted these features and just in time to I updated today and I actually don't

279
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:58,800
see it in here. So I'm going to be playing around with that because I guess I have to,

280
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:03,280
like, find the studio mode or something. But sometimes I want to get the stream up and going

281
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:07,360
and I'm just putting around in here for like a half hour, getting the studio ready.

282
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:11,120
It's not really anything that anybody like. It's like a lot to slog through when you go to

283
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:15,120
playback. So I'm going to start probably trimming some of that off. Then they've added some new

284
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:19,920
stats, which will be interesting to see. Now that we're doing this, it will actually be interesting

285
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:26,160
to get data on how much of the live stuff people watch. And they have fixed the replay permanent

286
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:31,600
link thing. So now they're telling me I can have a permanent URL that never changes. And I can also

287
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:37,040
carve out unique URLs for playback later. With this sprint, they've really nailed everything

288
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:42,800
I wanted in PeerTube. I think you'll have to come up with some new wishes and add it to their

289
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:48,160
future requests because there's got to be more that you want. Come on. I would love our community,

290
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:53,120
especially those that are interested, to dig into our PeerTube. I really would. I'd love you to go

291
00:24:53,120 --> 00:25:00,400
over there and dig into it and figure out ways to extract the videos, figure out ways to build

292
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:08,160
playlists. And also, I would love to know if there's a way we could set up on-demand VPSs

293
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:13,760
or maybe audience members could contribute some machine and we could set up web torrent seeds

294
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:18,640
that could act as essentially a community CDN for live events. I think it'd be great.

295
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:27,920
And yesterday I was streaming the WWDC 2022 event and it was rocking. PeerTube did so good. I was

296
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:34,320
very impressed. I was very, very happy. But we had one viewer in Israel and he, I think,

297
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:38,880
was the only viewer in Israel at the time. And as a result, he got some stuttering.

298
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:46,640
And if we could spin up an instance in his area or if he could have an instance going in his area

299
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:52,320
that when our PeerTube instance goes live, he participates in the web torrent in that area,

300
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:56,800
then we could create a community CDN. And I think that'd be really powerful. So I'd love to have our

301
00:25:56,800 --> 00:26:02,400
community dig into it because PeerTube is an open platform and there's a lot we can build on top of

302
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:07,520
this. And if we start building some momentum around that, I'm willing to commit resources to it. So

303
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:11,760
we'll get all that going in the matrix room on the new JB PeerTube room that we'll set up.

304
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:15,920
I think it should be pretty exciting. And I like where this is leading, man. You know,

305
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:21,680
Green Bean boosted in. Boost! Seven days ago for a thousand sats. I've never run PeerTube,

306
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:25,120
but I'd actually be quite interested in helping y'all put it to use. Stuff like this is super

307
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:29,840
interesting. I just haven't had a use case for myself. If that resonates with you, like if you've

308
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:32,880
wanted to play with some of this stuff, you've got some skill sets, but you just don't like

309
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:39,280
have a particular use case, maybe you can work with us on this. So check for a link in the show

310
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:43,280
notes on that and then stay tuned to Office Hours for future developments. We'll have the Cooking

311
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:48,240
with Brent series up there soon. Right, Brent? Well, it's a work in progress, but you know,

312
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:54,320
you might find it there. I will say, speaking of cooking, I know Wes was cooking quite a bit

313
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:59,040
in talking about how he set up the PeerTube instance on the latest Linux Unplugged. I

314
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:04,880
think that was 4.6.1. He dove into sort of how you guys use NixOS on the backend, and I thought

315
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:07,840
that was a really great conversation. So if you're interested more in how that was built,

316
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:12,080
I think that'd be a great place to go check it out. That is a good plug, indeed. All right,

317
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:18,000
so while we're talking about podcasting 2.0, I have been trying out the various podcasting 2.0

318
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:23,120
apps. Loved me some Fountain FM, and I recently tried out Podverse, which I like because it has

319
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:28,720
iOS, Android, and a great web client. Really great web client. It has the value boosting built right

320
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:33,360
in. It has some neat features like cross app comments, and it has that live stream support

321
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:38,560
I was talking about. So I reached out to one of the co-founders. His name is Mitch,

322
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:44,720
and I invited him on into the office. So Mitch, you and I just sat down. We started chatting,

323
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:49,200
and I asked you if you were the creator of Podverse. I've been checking out the Podverse

324
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:53,360
podcast app recently. One of the things I love about it, that's why I tried it out besides the

325
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:59,280
fact that it's a podcasting 2.0 app, is because Podverse has a web client, which is fantastic,

326
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:04,160
an Android client, and an iOS client. All the platforms, and they all sync up, and that got

327
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:09,200
my attention. So I started asking you, are you the creator, the founder, the CEO? And you said,

328
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:15,200
I'm a co-founder, and this has taken a ton more hours than we ever expected. So let's start there,

329
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:20,720
because I thought I read somewhere that Podverse kind of started as a Clips tool, right? It was

330
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:27,600
going to be for making podcast clips, not a full podcast app. Yeah, correct. So it's myself,

331
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:35,040
Creon, and Gary. Creon is another developer with Podverse, and Gary does graphic design.

332
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:42,560
And it originally was just supposed to be like a quick little project to get me started learning

333
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:48,960
how to program. This was like eight years ago. I was a big fan of podcasts and wanted a way to

334
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:53,600
share it with people. It was like a very isolated thing. It was something that was a big part of my

335
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:58,880
life, but I didn't have an easy way to introduce other people to it. And eight years ago, there

336
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:04,480
were not many options for sharing clips. So I went down this journey of learning how to

337
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:11,760
write code and create apps. So it's turned into something much bigger than that. Now it's not

338
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:17,680
just a clip sharing app. We try to do every feature we could possibly want. That's one of

339
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:23,760
the things, though. For a good clip sharing app, it needs to be my primary podcast app. I don't

340
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:29,680
want to be bouncing in and out of the app. So it ended up kind of just naturally becoming something

341
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:33,440
much bigger than that. I hadn't thought of that. Of course, that would sort of be a natural

342
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:38,640
evolution of it. It makes total sense. And then I suppose the podcasting 2.0 stuff kind of came

343
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:43,200
around just at the right time for an app at this size and this stage. Tell me a little bit about

344
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:51,760
that. Yeah, so that started about a year and a half ago. I think it was like September 2000.

345
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:57,680
Boy, I don't even remember years anymore. The before times? Yeah, the before times. It's all

346
00:29:57,680 --> 00:30:03,200
blur with all the COVID stuff. I was just actually looking in the community to try to

347
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:08,720
branch out and find some open source collaborations. And I sent an email to

348
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:14,640
James Cridland of Podnews. And he sent me an email back saying, hey, there's this new thing

349
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:20,480
called Podcasting 2.0. Here's a sneak peek. He sent me the first episode before it was released.

350
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:25,600
And I listened to it. I was like, oh, man, this is exactly what we're looking for because we're

351
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:31,680
an open source app. We're like principles first in that respect. And we just want what is best

352
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:39,520
for podcasting. Podcasting 2.0, it's two things in particular. It is the world's largest podcast

353
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:44,720
database. It's managed by Dave Jones and Adam Curry. Adam Curry, also known as the Podfather,

354
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:55,280
one of the original creators of podcasting. And it's also extending the RSS spec, which all

355
00:30:55,280 --> 00:31:03,680
podcasts use, so that new features are possible in podcast apps. And this is really exciting if

356
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:09,280
you are familiar with the podcast industry because RSS has not evolved much at all,

357
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:17,280
what, like 10, 15 years. And now that this group has come along and there's apps like ourselves and

358
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:23,600
RSS hosts participating in this, we're finally getting some consensus and people agreeing on

359
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:31,600
what features we can add and how we can add it to RSS feeds. For almost 20 years, people struggled

360
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:37,200
to get agreement, to get enough consensus to actually adopt these new practices.

361
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:42,160
And it seems like it just sort of was a great timing of things where the application development

362
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:48,240
process was at, where the podcasting 2.0 community was at. And correct me if I'm wrong, but really

363
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:54,720
before the podcasting 2.0 spec, you had maybe Apple would create some random tags for their own

364
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:59,200
internal use, and then you'd have app developers just kind of begin baking in support for those

365
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:03,600
tags that Apple had just added. There wasn't any standards that had been announced or discussed or

366
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:09,760
debated. It just, where Apple led, people had to follow. Yeah, it was pretty much Apple and

367
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:14,640
set all the norms and the industry just followed from there. Before Podcast Index came along,

368
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:21,120
we had 50,000 podcasts in our database. Now we have over 5 million in our database.

369
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:28,480
They do so much heavy lifting for us. We do a continuous syncing operation with their database.

370
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:36,320
And that work of just parsing 5 million podcasts, that's a full-time job for multiple people

371
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:43,200
in itself. And we get to leverage that for free because it's an open platform.

372
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:47,600
Do you take advantage of Podping to update the clients of new releases? Are you doing it through

373
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:49,680
traditional RSS fetching? How does that work?

374
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:55,440
So we sync with Podcast Index through API endpoints. We don't use Podping directly,

375
00:32:55,440 --> 00:33:02,320
except for with the new live stream feature where we do listen to Podping directly. There may come

376
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:08,560
a day where we are listening for all of our updates just from Podping, but for now, if we listen to

377
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:13,760
the Podcast Index API, we get more than just Podping updates. A lot of feeds still are not

378
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:20,720
on Podping yet, so we get all of the updates that Podcast Index discovers. But yeah, like I said,

379
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:26,960
we do listen for live stream updates through Podping, and it is a tremendous innovation

380
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:31,920
because it allows you to send all kinds of real-time notifications to podcast apps.

381
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:35,280
Yeah, I'm looking forward to seeing just more and more apps adopt that over time. I'm sure

382
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:40,080
there'll be things to work out, but so I've kind of been, you know, sampling different podcasting

383
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:46,160
2.0 apps recently, and it's made me appreciate just how freaking hard it is to actually build

384
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:49,040
a podcast app. And I think a lot of people, when they look at a podcast app, they think,

385
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:55,040
how hard could it be? It's RSS feeds. It goes and gets files from the RSS feed, and then it plays

386
00:33:55,040 --> 00:34:00,880
it using a built-in API. Like, how hard is that? But what I've discovered chatting with Oscar from

387
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:05,120
Fountain and just kind of using these different apps is that this is actually a really hard problem

388
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:10,560
to solve. And I'm curious, what are some of the biggest challenges that you guys run into? Is it

389
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:15,600
like user expectation stuff? Is it like code stuff? What are the big challenges on creating Podverse

390
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:22,000
maybe you didn't expect? Biggest challenges are typically just because the content is all hosted

391
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:28,880
by the podcasters themselves. And if you were to go through a platform, let's say like YouTube,

392
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:33,200
which is totally centralized, they control how everything goes into it and how everything goes

393
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:39,920
out of it. It's much easier to know what to expect as a programmer and how to code for those

394
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:46,880
situations. But with podcasting, there's some self-hosting involved. And so there's different

395
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:52,400
file types that might not work, handling all the different conditions that you end up running into

396
00:34:52,400 --> 00:35:00,320
over five million podcast feeds in the world. Another problem for us is dynamic ads, because

397
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:07,360
we are a clip sharing, like that's one of our primary features is clip sharing. And dynamic ads

398
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:14,960
will screw up the timestamps. So if I say, here's a clip from three minutes to five minutes in this

399
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:20,960
show, and it's just a reference point, and then we send that in a link to somebody, if they're

400
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:26,160
dynamic ads, it might jump to 30 seconds ahead or behind. Of course. Right. So how do you solve

401
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:32,560
for that even? Can you solve for that? For now, we just don't. Dynamic ads are just not our favorite

402
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:39,520
thing. And to be honest, for some podcasts, it works great if they don't have dynamic ads. If

403
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:46,800
they do, you still get an approximation of the clip. We're open to solving it in better ways,

404
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:53,920
but we really don't ever get complaints about it. It seems like people just, most shows don't use

405
00:35:53,920 --> 00:36:04,080
dynamic ads. And that's such a big problem to solve. And we would have to do our own detection

406
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:11,440
and we'd have to figure out other people's rules that they could change on a whim. We would need a

407
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:19,120
standard that we can follow reliably. Yeah, really would. You would have hoped, just a crazy idea,

408
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:23,280
but you would have hoped a standard like that would have been created before dynamic ads started

409
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:27,280
rolling out. But this is the result of nothing really evolving in the podcast industry for the

410
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:33,840
last 15 plus years. So on the topic of funding, I'd really like to pick your brain as a developer

411
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:38,960
and as somebody who's implementing this stuff, what are your thoughts on the boostagrams,

412
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:43,440
value for value, and building an application on top of the lightning network? How has that whole

413
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:48,560
thing gone? Value for value is very exciting. This is one of those developments that I didn't see

414
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:53,680
coming with all the eight years of working on this app until podcasting 2.0 came along.

415
00:36:54,480 --> 00:37:02,640
Yes, so it's the ability to send value. In our case, it's Bitcoin directly to the podcaster,

416
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:08,800
content creator, as you're listening. So we've been out of this for a long time until recently.

417
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:13,040
There's been other podcasting 2.0 apps doing this, and we only recently were able to get

418
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:20,880
involved with it through the Albee extension. It's very exciting to be able to support creators

419
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:29,520
directly without having to go through middlemen. And yet Albee allows us a way where we, as an app,

420
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:35,280
don't have to be custodians of people's wallets, which was a big sticking point for us, that we

421
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:41,360
want to be able to facilitate these payments, donations basically, or boosts as we call them,

422
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:45,280
but we don't want to control people's wallets at the end of the day. We don't want to be stewards

423
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:50,240
of it. That's just so far outside of scope of what we're trying to do as a podcast app.

424
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:54,720
Yeah, I could totally understand that. So if I'm using Podverse to boost a podcast,

425
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:58,800
does Podverse get a split in there to help sustain development? Have you guys talked about doing

426
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:04,480
something like that? So currently, it's voluntary. We do offer the ability to send us a split. So

427
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:11,200
on the website, if you are on a value-enabled podcast, which there's over 6,000 value-enabled

428
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:16,320
podcasts currently. Including our own podcasts. Including your own. And the wonderful podcasting

429
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:21,680
2.0 pod. It's actually an open source library that anybody can add to a website if they want.

430
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:29,040
It's a web component. You just load a script through a CDN, and then you put a web component

431
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:34,880
on the page. Which, if people are familiar with HTML, it's just a very simple element that you

432
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:42,960
put on the page. And then it generates this form, which then calls webln methods. There's a new

433
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:50,400
standard called webln, and it allows browsers to interact with browser extensions. So you can

434
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:58,720
have browser extensions, is how I think of it. So ALBEE is webln compatible, and that form is

435
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:06,080
webln compatible. So if you have ALBEE installed on your browser, then that form will be enabled.

436
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:11,200
It'll be able to send messages to the ALBEE extension, and then ALBEE goes ahead and sends

437
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:16,960
Bitcoin to the creators. Fascinating. I've been wondering about ALBEE. It looked like maybe

438
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:20,560
I'd want to check out. I actually installed the extension, but I haven't set it up yet. I really

439
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:25,120
like the idea of having it on a web form. Some people just love their existing podcast app.

440
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:28,240
They don't want to switch. That must be something you guys are constantly thinking about, too.

441
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:34,080
Some people. Not everybody. Some people are still using the default podcast app.

442
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:39,920
Some people have made a real conscious decision to switch apps. What are your thoughts on getting

443
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:45,280
people to entice them to try out Podverse? It's a really difficult problem, and I think

444
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:51,280
I'm really bad at marketing, so I don't have a great answer. You understand how people get

445
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:56,880
entrenched in whatever habits, whatever platform you're using. It has to take something really

446
00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:02,800
compelling to pull you into a new app. I don't really have a solution other than that. We just

447
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:07,680
keep trying to add exciting features, try to do things in what we think is the right way,

448
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:13,600
where we're all free and open source software. We don't sell people's information. We don't spam

449
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:18,400
people. We don't add our own advertisements and stuff like that. We're just trying to make the

450
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:25,440
best product we can, and hopefully word of mouth will take hold. That kind of raises something I've

451
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:32,960
been thinking a lot about lately, though, which is how it would be nice if our apps could share

452
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:38,720
data between themselves in compatible ways to make it easier for people to switch between apps.

453
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:42,960
Not just in, like, I'm going from app A and now app B is my new app, but that you could bounce

454
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:54,480
between the two. It's conceivable if we have export-import standards between apps, but to my

455
00:40:54,480 --> 00:41:00,800
knowledge, I'm not aware of existing standards for that. So that is something I'd like to explore.

456
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:03,600
You have support for OPML imports now, right?

457
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:06,480
Yes. OPML is good for your podcast...

458
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:07,520
Manual.

459
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:10,560
...manual. Well, it's your podcast subscriptions,

460
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:15,520
but what about your listening history? Like, since we're syncing across devices,

461
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:21,680
a lot of people actually like the mark as played feature. Like, we get emails about it saying,

462
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:26,480
you know, if it's not working, they'll tell us, like, hey, I want to see which ones I've listened

463
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:30,320
to already. That was a big draw for me for Podverse. You know, I'm listening in the car

464
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:34,880
and then I get back to get down to the studio. I want to finish it up on my studio speakers.

465
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:39,840
I like to play it on my desktop, so syncing between them is... That's got to be an interesting

466
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:45,600
challenge. I was curious, too, what your thoughts are on cross-app comments. I see a couple of

467
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:50,560
different trajectories in the podcasting 2.0 community right now. Some podcast apps are already

468
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:55,680
just going all in with the lightning comments. What are your thoughts on cross-podcast app

469
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:59,280
comments? So maybe I'm on Podverse and I leave a comment and somebody's on Fountain,

470
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:03,520
they leave a comment. In theory, no matter what app you're on, you'd be able to read those comments.

471
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:10,240
Yeah, well, so at least one version of it is very doable, which we've already implemented on

472
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:16,480
web and mobile. So yeah, the idea is a unifying thread, like the podcaster has one thread in

473
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:22,960
particular they want all of the apps to use, which is a brilliant idea and very useful, I think,

474
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:26,880
rather than being scattered across 10 different comment threads.

475
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:27,600
Amen to that.

476
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:34,880
The part that I'm not sure how we accomplish is sending comments through the app. So currently,

477
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:42,240
the way we have it set up is it'll render the comments, but if you want to leave a comment,

478
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:48,560
you have to press it and it'll open the web page that is where it actually is hosting the comment.

479
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:51,600
And I see it's doing a little bit of thinking as it collects them, too.

480
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:54,720
I get nervous when a loading spinner takes more than three seconds.

481
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:59,600
Hey, but it was because there's a big picture in there. That's why

482
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:02,960
somebody loaded up a big picture in their comment. I didn't even know you could do that.

483
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:07,280
Yeah, so this is Activity Pub, which is like a federated,

484
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:11,840
I would compare it to Twitter and people's common experience.

485
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:13,760
Sort of like Mastodon's back end, right?

486
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:14,240
Yes.

487
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:16,800
I'm vaguely familiar with it because I know PeerTube uses that as well.

488
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:22,960
So there's like a root comment and we just collect all the comments based on that and then

489
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:27,360
we render them in there. And if you were to click on it, it would open that Mastodon instance and

490
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:33,920
you could then leave comments through that page. So we have that set up with Activity Pub and also

491
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:34,800
Twitter.

492
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:39,120
And then, of course, the Fountain App's been experimenting with lightning comments, which

493
00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:43,200
I think I think Activity Pub makes more sense to me just from a technical standpoint.

494
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:46,080
But I'd be curious to pick your brain on what you think about lightning comments.

495
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:50,240
It doesn't really fit with what we're trying to do.

496
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:55,920
I don't we haven't thought about it very much. I don't see the value added.

497
00:43:55,920 --> 00:44:01,760
If there's more demand from listeners and podcasters, it's something we could explore more.

498
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:07,680
But we're not really like a crypto first app or a podcasting first app.

499
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:13,840
It just so happens that it's getting really easy to add these value enabled features.

500
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:18,080
And it's an exciting thing to participate in. So we're going down that road.

501
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:20,560
I like it. I'm glad you I think that's a good balance to strike.

502
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:25,440
And I think Bitcoin and lightning is the safer of any of the cryptos to enable.

503
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:30,800
So I think that was a you know, it's a nice, I'd say, cautious move that is really I mean,

504
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:33,760
the boost I get, I love them, man. I love them.

505
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:38,960
They're the I've been doing this for 15 years and I've never had an interaction with the audience

506
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:39,840
like I get with the boost.

507
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:44,560
And then the other thing that's really neat and you may have noticed this as well is I noticed

508
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:49,040
a bit of a community growing in podcasting today. I'll hear some of the same folks boost other shows

509
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:53,360
and then, you know, I kind of get to know people through them boosting other shows and stuff.

510
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:54,880
It's been really, really neat.

511
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:58,080
What I love about what you guys what you guys are doing is you've touched on a couple of times.

512
00:44:58,080 --> 00:44:59,440
It's free software.

513
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:02,080
Could we just expand on that just a little bit to kind of wrap this up?

514
00:45:02,080 --> 00:45:04,240
Why free software? What's the licensing?

515
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:08,960
And are you ever going to make money at doing this if it's if it's all free software?

516
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:11,120
Yeah, well, hopefully, hopefully.

517
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:15,680
Partly, I just love open source software and it's like motivated me to learn software.

518
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:20,000
It's hard to maybe explain, but just ever since I was a kid growing up in the 90s,

519
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:24,480
I just thought it was amazing that you could create something for free and give it away

520
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:26,560
all across the world instantly.

521
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:29,040
It's just like one of the coolest concepts.

522
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:29,520
I get it.

523
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:33,200
Obviously, you do. Linux unplugged. You get it.

524
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:40,720
Also, it's just we're trying to make software we really want to use and something that gets

525
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:44,240
in the way of what we want to use is advertisements and tracking.

526
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:51,840
And the perfect app in my mind wouldn't be closed software because what are we trying

527
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:53,200
to accomplish with that?

528
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:54,800
Just make money, I assume.

529
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:58,400
Like so open source allows us to be transparent.

530
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:01,680
People know exactly how our code works if they want to inspect it.

531
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:03,440
So we have nothing to hide.

532
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:09,040
And also, people can make it better if people don't like how we're managing our platform.

533
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:14,080
If we make some sort of decision to remove content, for example, and people are unhappy

534
00:46:14,080 --> 00:46:18,720
with it, they have access to all the tools we have to start their own instance with it.

535
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:22,400
I think it fits with the spirit of podcasting too.

536
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:27,360
Podcasting is a mostly open platform in itself.

537
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:31,040
So yeah, that's the primary.

538
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:34,480
I just I love open source software and it excites me.

539
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:39,760
And there's also not that many great open source podcast apps.

540
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:45,200
There are many open, but they're kind of like hobbies or like a side project, like a weekend

541
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:48,880
thing somebody did for a couple months before this.

542
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:53,360
The only one I was really aware of is AntennaPod, which is Android only and it's a great app.

543
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:55,200
But Android only.

544
00:46:55,920 --> 00:47:00,960
I'm not even sure what the leading iOS open source app would be.

545
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:02,480
Probably Podverse.

546
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:05,120
Maybe, maybe now I hope.

547
00:47:05,120 --> 00:47:05,680
I mean, I love it.

548
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:09,920
You know, the only thing if I could if I as a podcaster could have anything I wanted from

549
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:14,560
Podverse, I know it's going to be really crazy, but I'd love to be able to embed your player

550
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:19,360
on my website so that it's a basic player on my website with all the play controls that

551
00:47:19,360 --> 00:47:23,600
you guys have and the artwork display and the description display that it could expand.

552
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:26,640
And then if they wanted to click into it, they just go into Podverse and be in the whole

553
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:28,400
Podverse experience or something like that.

554
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:31,520
But something I could embed on my page because we're looking at rebuilding our website.

555
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:36,480
And we're looking at what we want to use as our podcast playback when people just want

556
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:37,440
to listen on the website.

557
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,680
None of them are as good as Podverse's, you know.

558
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:41,120
Wow, well, thank you.

559
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:42,000
Thanks.

560
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:46,720
It's funny you say that because it's like one of my top items on my whiteboard is embed.

561
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:47,200
Oh, really?

562
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:50,320
Embedding is coming soon.

563
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:51,280
Well, let me know.

564
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:51,760
Let me know.

565
00:47:52,320 --> 00:47:55,360
Yeah, we saw guys who have been promoting us a lot.

566
00:47:55,360 --> 00:47:57,600
They're doing they're just been really nice.

567
00:47:57,600 --> 00:47:58,800
The sleek podcast.

568
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:03,360
They ended up embedding our whole web page in an iFrame on their site.

569
00:48:03,360 --> 00:48:04,800
It's like, OK, go ahead.

570
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:05,840
That's one way I suppose.

571
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:08,720
I'm looking for something a little more low key.

572
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:11,520
No, no, we'll have a proper clean design for it.

573
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:14,080
Well, Mitch, thank you, sir, for coming on here and chatting with me.

574
00:48:14,080 --> 00:48:16,800
I'll have a link to Podverse.fm if people want to check it out.

575
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:19,600
Of course, Office Hours is in there and I can link to Office Hours.

576
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:20,400
So I'll do that.

577
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:21,440
That'll be in Podverse.

578
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:26,160
I mean, what else do we anything we didn't touch on that you'd like to mention or anything

579
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:29,760
about support or anything like that, just to let you know anything kind of open ended

580
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:32,320
for you to touch on before we wrap up?

581
00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:32,800
Not really.

582
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:37,040
Just if anybody has any questions or feedback, Podverse.fm.

583
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:40,640
We have multiple contact options through there.

584
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:44,560
Also, if anybody is interested in helping with translations, we have a translations

585
00:48:44,560 --> 00:48:50,480
community and we're trying to we have this nice setup that makes it really easy for people

586
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:55,440
just pop in and start translating words and you don't have to translate everything just

587
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:59,280
like here and there if you translate some words and then it ends up automatically getting

588
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:02,800
making a PR that goes to our repo.

589
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:03,760
It's called Web Blade.

590
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:05,920
I'm not sure if you've ever heard of it before.

591
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:07,440
I'll have to look into that.

592
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:08,640
That sounds really great.

593
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:09,520
It's really cool.

594
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:11,200
That actually makes it possible, huh?

595
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:12,320
That's so cool.

596
00:49:12,320 --> 00:49:15,440
Also, I should mention Podverse is probably in your local app store.

597
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:16,720
You know, go find it there.

598
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:18,720
App Store, Android and F-droid.

599
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:22,080
Hey, F-droid, good man.

600
00:49:22,080 --> 00:49:23,200
I love to see that.

601
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:24,080
Very good.

602
00:49:24,080 --> 00:49:25,360
I will keep up the good work.

603
00:49:25,360 --> 00:49:25,520
All right.

604
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:26,000
Thanks, man.

605
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:38,720
A special thank you to Mitch for joining us, spending a little bit extra time coming into

606
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:43,040
the office and hanging out and the hard work he and his co-founder are doing on Podverse.

607
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:49,600
We'll have links to Podverse's main page, office hours in there and also their GitHub

608
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:50,880
because it is all open source.

609
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:53,360
So we'll have all that there.

610
00:49:53,360 --> 00:49:55,920
Hey, Brent, little breaking news here in the studio.

611
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:56,400
Really?

612
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:59,600
While we were, yeah, while we were watching that, I got a knock on the door.

613
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:00,480
And who was it?

614
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:01,360
That's kind of random.

615
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:08,880
I mean, you know, I did not expect this, but it was FedEx and they were arriving with my

616
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:12,960
review unit for the HP Dev1 laptop.

617
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:14,240
That is impressive.

618
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:18,800
Well, I know it's just a white box at this point, but geez, I kind of feel like this might

619
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:22,560
turn into like a box opening video all of a sudden.

620
00:50:22,560 --> 00:50:26,480
Oh, and I got there's a little note in here.

621
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:28,080
There's a little note in here.

622
00:50:28,080 --> 00:50:31,040
It says, thank you for taking the time to check out our Dev1 notebook.

623
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:32,480
Hope you enjoy it as much as we do.

624
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:34,640
Looking forward to hearing what you think about it.

625
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:39,120
Best, HP Dev1 and System76.

626
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:39,760
That's awesome.

627
00:50:42,320 --> 00:50:46,320
So I'm curious what you're planning on putting this thing through.

628
00:50:46,320 --> 00:50:47,680
Have you thought about that at all?

629
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:53,200
Oh, you know, a battery of tests just to kind of get an idea of what the heat and fan noise

630
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:54,000
is like.

631
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,840
And then a lot of just functionality tests.

632
00:50:56,480 --> 00:51:00,400
So my buddy Mike on Coda Radio has had his he actually bought one.

633
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:01,840
So he's had it for a few days longer.

634
00:51:01,840 --> 00:51:06,000
And he did his his first impressions on Coda Radio, which came out on Wednesday.

635
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:11,360
And we talk about after we talk about WWDC, we talk about his HP Dev1.

636
00:51:12,080 --> 00:51:15,280
So I'll probably give some first impressions and Linux unplugged this week, I would imagine.

637
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:18,960
I would like to know, are you going to run just whatever came on it?

638
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:20,480
Are you going to replace it as well?

639
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:22,640
Any thoughts around that?

640
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:27,120
You know, I feel like I should always run it in the default config for a period of time

641
00:51:27,120 --> 00:51:28,720
and get a sense of the product.

642
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:33,280
And so a lot of times if it's something like this, because this is unique, right?

643
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:35,760
This is Pop OS on the Dev1.

644
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:37,760
This is Pop OS on HP hardware.

645
00:51:38,320 --> 00:51:39,040
This is a little different.

646
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:43,920
So I feel like in that case, I am probably going to try to optimize the bulk of my review

647
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:49,760
for Pop OS, but I imagine in the last couple of days, I'll probably throw Fedora on there,

648
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:54,480
maybe NixOS on there, you know, that kind of stuff, because it's all AMD in here, right?

649
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:58,720
And my question is, is how much simpler does that make just trying out different distros?

650
00:51:58,720 --> 00:52:01,040
Because I suspect it makes it much simpler.

651
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:03,680
OK, well, I'll look forward to your review.

652
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:06,160
Also, the pricing, it's about a grand.

653
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:11,600
It's not unreasonable if this is a well-built, long lasting, well-performing Linux laptop

654
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:14,400
that doesn't make too much fan noise when it's under load.

655
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:18,320
I could see this kind of being like, you know, when JB gets to the point where we're kitting

656
00:52:18,320 --> 00:52:22,960
out remote hosts like yourself, this would be like the recording laptop you would get.

657
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:28,640
Because this would be so much better for you because it's so much newer and it's got GPU

658
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:33,280
acceleration that would take care of things like visualizing the audio bars that are probably

659
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:35,760
being rendered by CPU right now and that kind of stuff.

660
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:39,440
So I'm going to try it out, let you know, it literally just came along with this in

661
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:41,760
here. It wasn't in the show notes. I was kind of confused.

662
00:52:42,560 --> 00:52:46,560
No, no, I'm just just throwing it at you because I had a little knock knock.

663
00:52:46,560 --> 00:52:51,040
I got a message from Mike from Koda Radio that his review unit just showed up.

664
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:54,000
So I thought, oh, I'll go check to see if, you know, everybody's getting there.

665
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,240
So I'm sure everybody who's getting one just got theirs.

666
00:52:56,800 --> 00:53:05,360
And also in the box came with the System 76 launch keyboard and this HP 935 creator wireless

667
00:53:05,360 --> 00:53:09,920
mouse that they seem to be really jazzed about. So that came in the box as well.

668
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:13,120
That can either deck in the reviewers out, I suppose.

669
00:53:13,120 --> 00:53:15,520
I think it's just one standard config for this.

670
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:19,840
Like when you buy it, if you go to buy it, it's just one config.

671
00:53:19,840 --> 00:53:24,000
There's no customizing. But then I guess the RAM is removable.

672
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:28,240
Supposedly that might be something. I don't recognize those screw types, though.

673
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:33,760
Oh, that's never a good. I don't know how I don't know how upgradeable it is.

674
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:39,680
You have to call your machinist friend to come design some screwdrivers for you.

675
00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:41,200
Yeah. Is that you?

676
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:43,440
It could be. Yes, it could be.

677
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:46,800
Is that Alex? Who's my machinist friend?

678
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:48,560
Anyone local? We need someone.

679
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:51,280
I need to know this guy. This is important.

680
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:52,560
Well, that's very exciting.

681
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:55,520
Let's do a few boosts there, Mr. Brent.

682
00:53:55,520 --> 00:53:58,080
Yeah, we got some great boosts. I recognize some names. You know,

683
00:53:58,080 --> 00:54:02,080
they're starting to get very familiar here. Marcel wrote in seven days ago with

684
00:54:02,080 --> 00:54:06,400
thirty thirty sats, which I feel like there's a bunch of subliminal messages in those.

685
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:07,760
Thirty thirty, huh?

686
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:12,480
I see some down the line with equally obscure numbers, but who knows?

687
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:16,640
Boy, this one's this one. I usually have a guess. This one has me stumped.

688
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:19,520
Marcel will have to reveal because I have no guess.

689
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:24,480
Yes, please let us know. So Marcel writes, I know you all know this,

690
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:27,360
but injected ads into podcasts are the worst.

691
00:54:27,360 --> 00:54:31,760
They're jarring and 90 percent of the time something I would never, ever be interested in.

692
00:54:32,320 --> 00:54:36,480
I've stopped listening to podcasts because of it. I know podcasters need to eat,

693
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:43,680
which is why I boost and support Jupiter.Party. I also support lame podcasting 1.0 shows on Patreon.

694
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:49,440
I like how the J.B. ads are recorded by you and how they're different every time.

695
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:54,240
I signed up for Linode for that exact reason. Thanks for not doing injected ads.

696
00:54:54,240 --> 00:55:00,480
Yeah, I've always felt like that's part of the value of our reads is that we do them

697
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:06,720
and we get like hands on with the product. I can't say I would never, ever, ever consider

698
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:14,400
dynamic ads because I heard from the podcasting 2.0 pod that I think it was pod being has

699
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:20,240
supposedly created, supposedly created this system that transcribes the podcast.

700
00:55:20,240 --> 00:55:24,720
Then it uses some magic A.I. to figure out a natural beat to put a cut.

701
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:30,720
And then when it puts a cut in there, it underplays a little bit of a jingle

702
00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:34,400
as the as the host was finishing their sentence, a little bit of a jingle

703
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:38,480
into the ad start, then the ad plays and then a little bit of a jingle back.

704
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:42,640
And it resumes where the podcaster was continuing to speak with all with the music fading out.

705
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:49,120
And then on top of that, supposedly it'll even auto update the chapters and split them into

706
00:55:49,120 --> 00:55:52,400
part one and part two so it doesn't mess with the chapter markers and stuff like that.

707
00:55:53,120 --> 00:55:58,400
I don't like it. I'll just be honest with you. The value, I think, is in the back catalog,

708
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:03,280
perhaps for some podcasters. So imagine a little behind the scenes here, Marcel.

709
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:08,640
It's like we do these shows and some of these shows continued to get downloaded

710
00:56:09,840 --> 00:56:14,720
for a decade almost. If somebody were to go listen to an old episode of Linux action show,

711
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:21,600
they'd hear an ad for GoDaddy in there right now. Would it make sense to slice that out

712
00:56:22,080 --> 00:56:26,240
and instead put a, you know, a current sponsor in there if it was a difference between

713
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:31,600
the podcaster, you know, making or breaking it? Maybe I don't know, but I think it has to be done

714
00:56:31,600 --> 00:56:35,920
right. Maybe the folks at Podbean are starting to figure it out. The tech still new and people just

715
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:40,880
rushed to it because it was, in my opinion, an easy way to make money on your back catalog.

716
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:48,480
So True Grit's boosted in seven days ago with 3409 stats, which I think that's a Tesla thing.

717
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:50,960
I don't get the reference, but someone will fill us in.

718
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:54,400
Says you mentioned on a live stream once that you were testing out PeerTube

719
00:56:55,520 --> 00:56:59,440
and that tended to be generally behind, say, maybe Twitch or YouTube because of the peer

720
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:03,680
to peer streaming nature. What if the live streams were actually streamed to PeerTube first

721
00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:08,720
and then sent out to YouTube and Twitch after that? Would that solve the problem or would it

722
00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:13,920
just make it worse? That's a great question. Very on point true grits with today's episode, too.

723
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:22,160
We are considering that, but probably not. I'll probably keep going to Twitch and YouTube until

724
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:27,760
they stop giving me free bandwidth, which I assume is inevitable. My my dread and I know this just

725
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:34,800
sounds like conspiracy bacon right now, but my dread is that some Western government is going to

726
00:57:34,800 --> 00:57:41,200
outlaw encryption in some way and that it's going to create a horrible conflict in the free software

727
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:46,640
community. And I'm going to fall on the side that encryption should be available to everyone,

728
00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:53,440
that it's a human right. And so I, you know, I could see a day and age without me doing anything

729
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:58,320
politically controversial, without me like, you know, becoming like the Alex Jones of podcasting.

730
00:57:58,320 --> 00:58:05,440
I could see the current status quo shifting to where maybe, you know, my stuff is labeled as

731
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:10,000
dangerous or misinformation or something like that, because I'm not, you know, I don't know.

732
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,800
I mean, I'm just thinking what could happen. I'm also thinking what if one day I wanted to

733
00:58:12,800 --> 00:58:16,800
get down the road and not have a Google account, that kind of stuff. That's just been on my mind,

734
00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:21,280
you know, but so I think about until they kick me off, we might as well take the free bandwidth and

735
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:25,600
get the free network effect. And then what we'll do is we'll just do more stuff on the

736
00:58:25,600 --> 00:58:29,280
peer tube over time. We'll stream earlier over there where we can play whatever we want without

737
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:33,680
getting, you know, kicked off like the WWDC stream or some special event or like, you know,

738
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:43,920
cooking with Brent and true grits actually sent in a double boost. They're going to say that

739
00:58:44,560 --> 00:58:50,320
they're still waiting on the membership feed to support boosts. Chris, what's going on with this?

740
00:58:50,320 --> 00:58:57,440
Can you update us? It cuts. It cuts. It cuts. Yeah, it's in the progress. We have to build

741
00:58:57,440 --> 00:59:03,040
a bunch of tooling. So my plan is to start actually with the office hours and self-hosted

742
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:06,640
member feeds we're working on and probably eventually code a radio member feed and make

743
00:59:06,640 --> 00:59:12,400
them boostable first. You know, once we get that kind of dialed in, probably transition

744
00:59:13,360 --> 00:59:17,840
the older shows, but not start necessarily with the biggest and the oldest show. You know what I

745
00:59:17,840 --> 00:59:22,000
mean? I want to break everything first. I feel like office hours is the place where we get to play and

746
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:27,360
often things might not work, but often it might lead to some great things. Thanks for the double

747
00:59:27,360 --> 00:59:34,240
boost, true grits. Nev boosted in seven days ago, 500 sets. I think the best part of the live feeds

748
00:59:34,240 --> 00:59:38,800
are the conversations you and the community have. For example, when the Libidwadia changes dropped

749
00:59:38,800 --> 00:59:43,120
and we're all complaining about Gnome, a Gnome contributor came in one day and there was quite

750
00:59:43,120 --> 00:59:48,160
the long debate about an hour long between Neil and him. In my opinion, content like that should

751
00:59:48,160 --> 00:59:52,160
be available somewhere, even if it's behind a paywall. I often find myself commenting on the

752
00:59:52,160 --> 00:59:57,360
live feeds more than on the shows themselves. I specifically remember that episode. It was

753
00:59:57,360 --> 01:00:02,000
fabulous. Um, we kind of let that discussion go on because it was, there was so much quality there.

754
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:07,040
And I think, did we, did we do the show late by an hour because of it or? Yeah, yeah, I think so.

755
01:00:07,040 --> 01:00:12,400
And then it, and then it continued after we wrapped up the show, it continued. It sure did. Yeah. The

756
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:18,240
show is just like an earmark in that conversation. Um, but that is available to members, right?

757
01:00:18,240 --> 01:00:23,840
Jupiter.party. So if you are a member, it is on the feeds there. So that would be a good place

758
01:00:23,840 --> 01:00:27,520
to find it if you're looking for it. I believe the episode is fairly easy to find. I don't have

759
01:00:27,520 --> 01:00:33,840
it on the tip of my tongue, but, um, you can use, uh, notes.jupiterbroadcasting.com to, uh, find

760
01:00:33,840 --> 01:00:41,280
when that was mentioned. Boost! Dylann wrote in seven days ago, 3500 sets. Great to see you so

761
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:46,320
motivated on a new show like this. Excited to see more of office hours. Well, it's really cause

762
01:00:46,320 --> 01:00:51,040
Brent keeps showing up. Let's be honest. No, I am very excited about office hours. I've been

763
01:00:51,040 --> 01:00:55,360
enjoying it. The one thing I'd like to expand on in the pre and post show is interaction with the

764
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:59,440
mumble room and just asking questions about what's going on at JB or in the matrix room,

765
01:00:59,440 --> 01:01:03,200
but we're getting there. We can also do it through boosts. Uh, and so far we've been doing this

766
01:01:03,200 --> 01:01:08,240
sponsor free. I think that'll probably change next quarter, but, uh, right now I've just,

767
01:01:08,240 --> 01:01:11,520
you know, we've just kind of been doing it to see as a grand experiment, but I think it'll stick

768
01:01:11,520 --> 01:01:16,480
around. I've been enjoying it. And I really appreciate you guys boosting in subscribing,

769
01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:19,760
trying to find it in the, in fountain when you can't find it. Like everybody, I feel like people

770
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:24,640
have been going above and beyond to participate in the show. So I am super grateful. Uh, our buddy,

771
01:01:24,640 --> 01:01:30,640
Dave Jones came in this week. Boost! He says, uh, man, I'm loving office hours. I just started

772
01:01:30,640 --> 01:01:40,720
listening. What is open sets? So Dave, Dave boosted in 2000, 112 sets, 15%, uh, 15% split of that is

773
01:01:40,720 --> 01:01:48,800
going to go to open sets. 50% of all of the boost to office hours and Linux unplugged for the last

774
01:01:48,800 --> 01:01:56,880
three weeks have been contributed to open sets. OpenSats is a 501c charity that contributes 100%

775
01:01:56,880 --> 01:02:02,080
of the funds sent to their general fund, which is what we're doing. They send 100% of that to free

776
01:02:02,080 --> 01:02:09,600
software projects. And a big reason why JB is embracing boosts and lightning payments is because

777
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:14,640
I actually believe this is a way through our audience. We can build a network of people

778
01:02:14,640 --> 01:02:19,760
participating in this payment system that will then be in a position to support free software

779
01:02:20,320 --> 01:02:25,440
when free software projects come online. And that's a big part. It's like, this is like a

780
01:02:25,440 --> 01:02:28,880
five, six year pic, you know, picture that I have in my head, but that's where I see this going.

781
01:02:28,880 --> 01:02:36,080
And I think it starts here. And I believe open sets could be an avenue to that future. So I've,

782
01:02:36,080 --> 01:02:39,120
we've been contributing for three weeks. This will be the last episode because this is the

783
01:02:39,120 --> 01:02:44,240
last episode of the month, by the way. And cause I'm going to be off the week that in two weeks.

784
01:02:44,240 --> 01:02:48,160
And so that's what we've been doing for the last three weeks. We've been given open sets a cut.

785
01:02:48,160 --> 01:02:52,000
I love them. I looked into them. They look completely legit. You can also contribute

786
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,800
to their operational costs if you like, but right now we're just doing the general fund.

787
01:02:54,800 --> 01:02:59,440
So it all 100% goes to free software, a lot of it in the Bitcoin ecosystem, some of it,

788
01:02:59,440 --> 01:03:03,440
the best software in the Bitcoin ecosystem. And it's just been our way to contribute back

789
01:03:03,440 --> 01:03:07,440
to open source. And it's been nice. Like we've sent some money their way, which I think is really

790
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:13,120
great. You know, I did notice that, uh, Dave sent in two, one, one, two sets. And, uh, if you're a

791
01:03:13,120 --> 01:03:17,360
rush fan, that's one of their more famous albums. So I don't know if that was intentional, but

792
01:03:17,360 --> 01:03:21,040
you know, send some love. I could see it being intentional. You have to let us know, Dave,

793
01:03:21,040 --> 01:03:26,800
Dave. The golden dragon wrote in as well. Big ups for boosts. I think that the split

794
01:03:26,800 --> 01:03:31,520
for open sets is phenomenal. Helping to fund open source projects in a meaningful way is

795
01:03:31,520 --> 01:03:37,920
always a plus one in my book. See you next boost. Thanks for opening the office. These are so fun.

796
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:45,280
Thanks golden dragon. See you next boost. How about this one? Turquoise Fox boosted in seven

797
01:03:45,280 --> 01:03:53,680
days ago with 10,000 sats boost. And, uh, the boost to Graham just says fund the open source.

798
01:03:53,680 --> 01:04:01,840
Marcel wrote in again, double boost, by the way, cannot find office hours in fountain

799
01:04:01,840 --> 01:04:07,520
tried with Chris and Jupiter broadcasting, but, uh, didn't find anything. Sorry about that. That

800
01:04:07,520 --> 01:04:14,000
has been tricky. I did contact them and I haven't heard anything back on that. Although then, uh,

801
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:19,600
I noticed that, uh, Lima boosted in and said that they were able to find the right version of the

802
01:04:19,600 --> 01:04:24,400
show and send it to that. So I don't know, man. And for me at first, it wasn't showing up.

803
01:04:25,200 --> 01:04:29,360
And then I got ahold of the devs and told them like, you know, this show isn't showing up,

804
01:04:29,360 --> 01:04:33,280
but it's in the podcast index. And then I went back immediately to like get a screenshot for them.

805
01:04:33,280 --> 01:04:37,200
And I searched for it again and it fricking showed up. See, Chris, I'm just curious if it,

806
01:04:37,200 --> 01:04:41,600
if it wasn't showing up for Marcel, how did he boost in the show? You must have snatched this

807
01:04:41,600 --> 01:04:46,400
some other way. He could have been using breeze. Oh, okay. Okay. Or there might've been a boost

808
01:04:46,400 --> 01:04:50,480
where Marcel explained it and I missed it, but that's a good question. I would like to know how

809
01:04:50,480 --> 01:04:58,080
a mystery, a mystery. Maybe we just passed the test. I don't know. Gene Bean wrote in as well,

810
01:04:58,080 --> 01:05:10,000
another double boost as a podcaster at what level of sats per minute does the streaming of sats

811
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:15,920
while people are listening become financially beneficial versus just a nice gesture?

812
01:05:15,920 --> 01:05:20,640
This is a fabulous question. That's a great question. So to be clear right now,

813
01:05:20,640 --> 01:05:28,000
I don't really see it as a replacement. I see it as an addition because messaging into the show

814
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:33,280
is a tricky thing and airtime is a very valuable thing. And so this has always been a balance that

815
01:05:33,280 --> 01:05:38,400
we've really tried to strike here on the show. And so this has been the first time when there has

816
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:42,160
been a medium where somebody could send us a message from the podcast app while they're

817
01:05:42,160 --> 01:05:46,560
listening. And I would receive it in a web app that gives me a feed of people's comments. And

818
01:05:46,560 --> 01:05:52,640
here's the best part. I can't reply. There are times I would love to. I've even thought about

819
01:05:52,640 --> 01:05:58,800
trying to figure out how to sometimes, but the best part is that I cannot reply. I probably

820
01:05:58,800 --> 01:06:04,800
spend 20% of my working time, maybe even more than that, really managing, interacting with the

821
01:06:04,800 --> 01:06:10,160
community. It is a massive chunk of my job. And so to be able to have something that comes in

822
01:06:10,160 --> 01:06:15,200
that I can process as a JSON feed, that I can export as a CSV file, or that I can read in a

823
01:06:15,200 --> 01:06:20,400
web interface and it's tagged with episodes, game changer for production, game changer for how I

824
01:06:20,400 --> 01:06:24,480
receive feedback. And I love how fresh it is because there's coming right from the podcast

825
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:31,760
app. So I see this as a way to take something that has been sort of out of balance from the

826
01:06:31,760 --> 01:06:36,960
beginning of podcasting to balancing it now. And I don't see it really replacing memberships or

827
01:06:36,960 --> 01:06:43,520
sponsors forever, but I do wonder if there was some massive economic downturn and sponsorships

828
01:06:43,520 --> 01:06:48,240
pulled back or people got really sick with memberships and everybody just got membership

829
01:06:48,240 --> 01:06:55,440
fatigue. So we had less Jupiter party members. I could see that maybe over time people transition

830
01:06:55,440 --> 01:07:00,240
to small amounts via streaming sets, but spread across thousands of listeners. Maybe it would add

831
01:07:00,240 --> 01:07:04,720
up, but I've never really done the math because I don't really see it getting there for quite a

832
01:07:04,720 --> 01:07:11,040
while. We're so early on this, right? There's really still so much infrastructure to be built.

833
01:07:11,040 --> 01:07:15,200
We don't even have yet a way to do this from like the website. That's all that would have to be

834
01:07:15,200 --> 01:07:19,600
figured out. I'd like a way for people to be able to boost from the matrix chat room using a bot,

835
01:07:20,240 --> 01:07:26,480
all that kind of stuff. It's getting here. It's close. We're just not there yet. So I don't see

836
01:07:26,480 --> 01:07:31,680
it. I don't see it replacing anything yet. I love the idea. I suppose if I had any fantasy

837
01:07:32,720 --> 01:07:40,240
about the future, it would be me living in my RV somewhere beautiful off-grid with my

838
01:07:40,240 --> 01:07:45,920
internet connected dish somehow. My space dish. I'm living off of boosts because I would just

839
01:07:45,920 --> 01:07:52,240
live minimal, you know, quietly. It's just somewhere peaceful where nobody was around,

840
01:07:52,240 --> 01:07:55,840
just me and my podcast. And I get on and talk to my internet buddies. That'd be fine by me.

841
01:07:55,840 --> 01:08:00,560
And every now and then I come into town, you know, I do that for spurts of time now.

842
01:08:01,120 --> 01:08:05,760
I think it's a great question to keep in mind, you know, in the future of this development.

843
01:08:05,760 --> 01:08:08,960
You know, in a year from now, we should ask ourselves the exact same question.

844
01:08:08,960 --> 01:08:10,160
That's a good one to ponder.

845
01:08:10,160 --> 01:08:16,000
That is a good one. We also got a thank you boost in from Dylan. He sent 500 sats

846
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:17,040
into office hour three.

847
01:08:17,040 --> 01:08:17,840
That's actually a double.

848
01:08:19,360 --> 01:08:23,040
Yeah, he was just sending a boost into office hours three welcoming into the Suspenders Club.

849
01:08:23,040 --> 01:08:29,440
I am a, I am rocking suspenders. It's funny as a man, there's not a lot of things people

850
01:08:29,440 --> 01:08:34,160
will comment on your appearance about, but like, if you change your hair or you shave

851
01:08:34,160 --> 01:08:40,720
your face or, or now I've discovered if you put suspenders on, it now becomes a topic

852
01:08:40,720 --> 01:08:45,760
of conversation that is socially acceptable, apparently for anyone to talk about. I, on

853
01:08:45,760 --> 01:08:50,080
the other hand, am very uncomfortable about anyone commenting on my appearance at all.

854
01:08:50,080 --> 01:08:55,200
Right? Like I always find it very awkward. Like I, I find like I leaned into the hair

855
01:08:55,200 --> 01:08:58,880
thing, obviously that fight I just gave into, cause let's be honest, come on.

856
01:08:58,880 --> 01:09:04,080
But like the, like the suspenders stuff and the beard stuff, I always find it very weird.

857
01:09:04,080 --> 01:09:07,440
You know, it's very uncomfortable. A little bit of news before we wrap up.

858
01:09:07,440 --> 01:09:11,360
Brett, check this out. You're familiar with Umbral.

859
01:09:11,360 --> 01:09:13,920
Oh yeah. You made me play with it a whole bunch of times.

860
01:09:13,920 --> 01:09:19,360
It's one of my new loves of 2022. It is a personal server OS for self-hosting

861
01:09:19,360 --> 01:09:23,360
with a brilliant app store, tons of some of the best free software out there.

862
01:09:24,240 --> 01:09:29,120
Plus it integrates nicely and with Tor. So you can have things that are technically

863
01:09:29,120 --> 01:09:32,560
accessible remotely, but without opening a port on your firewall.

864
01:09:33,280 --> 01:09:38,480
And it's how we do our Bitcoin lightning node. So when people send in sets,

865
01:09:38,480 --> 01:09:42,640
it's landing on an Umbral node that's physically here in the studio.

866
01:09:43,520 --> 01:09:47,120
One bit of feedback that Umbral got, and I got it too is, Hey, I love that, you know,

867
01:09:47,120 --> 01:09:51,360
I can run my own Bitwarden or I can run my own mumble server, or I can run all of this stuff,

868
01:09:51,360 --> 01:09:55,920
but I don't really want to run a Bitcoin node. I don't want to allocate 500 gigs of disk space.

869
01:09:56,640 --> 01:10:06,240
And now with Umbral 0.5, which came out today, as we are recording, they have extracted the

870
01:10:06,240 --> 01:10:11,200
lightning node and Bitcoin node as their own components that are an app that you can install.

871
01:10:11,200 --> 01:10:17,040
So you can now install Umbral just as an app platform to run things nicely inside Docker,

872
01:10:17,040 --> 01:10:21,680
and then if you want it to be a Bitcoin node, you just install that app. And along with that,

873
01:10:21,680 --> 01:10:28,800
they've completely redone the UI. So they got a whole new look and they've now introduced the

874
01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:34,480
ability for apps to be independently updated without having to do a whole OS update like

875
01:10:34,480 --> 01:10:38,800
they had in the past. Before you'd have to update the entire image. Now they've broken that out.

876
01:10:38,800 --> 01:10:41,520
They've also got some credential management stuff built in here now.

877
01:10:41,520 --> 01:10:48,000
I'm very excited about this update, Brent. I feel like, again, if you've got a Raspberry Pi

878
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:52,400
sitting around or something equivalent, this is fantastic. You could go get this going up

879
01:10:52,400 --> 01:10:56,480
in seconds, but I feel like they just they took it to the next level with this release

880
01:10:56,480 --> 01:11:01,200
because not only did they uncouple the Bitcoin and lightning node stuff, which is, I think,

881
01:11:01,200 --> 01:11:04,880
something you should install, even if you don't use lightning much. It's nice to just

882
01:11:04,880 --> 01:11:09,120
help decentralize the network. I love that kind of stuff, but I think it's smart that

883
01:11:09,120 --> 01:11:12,720
they detached that. And then the other thing they've done that's really smart

884
01:11:13,760 --> 01:11:20,160
is they've now got an official one liner that you can copy and paste. You got to make that

885
01:11:20,160 --> 01:11:24,720
determination if it's safe or not for yourself, but a one liner that you can copy and paste now

886
01:11:25,520 --> 01:11:30,160
and you can get up and up and running on any Debian or Ubuntu based system. So it doesn't

887
01:11:30,160 --> 01:11:34,640
even have to be a Raspberry Pi anymore. You don't have to do any weird scripts like I did.

888
01:11:34,640 --> 01:11:40,960
They've now got an official simple one line install to take any Ubuntu or Debian based system

889
01:11:41,520 --> 01:11:45,680
and make it run as an umbral box. And then once you've done that, you get their platform for

890
01:11:45,680 --> 01:11:50,240
installing applications, managing them, and it is great. It is really great. I know you could just

891
01:11:50,240 --> 01:11:55,440
run stuff in Docker because you're a big shot out there, but this is so great. I don't often I don't

892
01:11:55,440 --> 01:12:00,080
often brag about like these things that let you I'm not even a portainer guy. Like I'm not I'm not

893
01:12:00,080 --> 01:12:06,080
a Web UI to manage your containers guy. But man, is this great and I am big on sovereign data and

894
01:12:06,080 --> 01:12:10,400
bringing your stuff home and I am big on decentralized computing and I'm big on putting

895
01:12:10,400 --> 01:12:17,520
your stuff on your own land. So this has like prism in there. It has Pyhole, it has Node-RED,

896
01:12:17,520 --> 01:12:24,400
it has Nextcloud, Home Assistant, Uptime Kuma, so many great apps, plus a bunch of stuff for the

897
01:12:24,400 --> 01:12:28,800
Bitcoin ecosystem and the Lightning ecosystem. So it just felt like a special day because we

898
01:12:28,800 --> 01:12:32,560
got a brand new version of PeerTube today. We've been talking about that. And we got a brand new

899
01:12:32,560 --> 01:12:37,520
version of umbral, which has been in the works forever. And they all landed right as we were

900
01:12:37,520 --> 01:12:43,040
recording. This is a huge step for both these projects. And for umbral, 0.5 now marks the first

901
01:12:43,040 --> 01:12:48,240
release as just a general personal server OS. I feel like they're doing a good job of listening

902
01:12:48,240 --> 01:12:51,920
to their audience. We've mentioned a few times, you know, this is this is the second time in this

903
01:12:51,920 --> 01:12:58,160
show some project listens to some of your hopes for where the project can go. But it does also

904
01:12:58,160 --> 01:13:02,560
seem like a little bit of a shift of direction for them, which I'm curious on your opinion of

905
01:13:02,560 --> 01:13:07,360
that. You know, they kind of came in as the Bitcoin, you know, making your Bitcoin node

906
01:13:07,360 --> 01:13:10,960
easy to get up and running, especially on a Raspberry Pi. And now it seems like they're

907
01:13:12,080 --> 01:13:18,800
maybe I'll call it maturing or refocusing slightly to being sort of a, you know,

908
01:13:18,800 --> 01:13:23,840
run your great community Docker containers here. Oh, by the way, we also do Bitcoin and

909
01:13:23,840 --> 01:13:29,200
lightning nodes. So I wonder what you think of that. That'd be good interview question. My sense

910
01:13:29,200 --> 01:13:33,680
of it would be they got into this market and realized what a demand there is for doing this

911
01:13:33,680 --> 01:13:38,960
right. And realize that they could address even more people if they decoupled the Bitcoin stuff.

912
01:13:38,960 --> 01:13:45,200
And I think that's a clever insight. And I think they're doing in a way that isn't making it any

913
01:13:45,200 --> 01:13:49,600
less of its original purpose. It's still it's still great as a Bitcoin node. In fact, I'd argue

914
01:13:49,600 --> 01:13:54,720
this is even a better way to do it now because now you can update that independently of the major OS.

915
01:13:55,360 --> 01:13:58,160
It's a tight line to walk. If we get an opportunity to chat with them,

916
01:13:58,160 --> 01:14:02,000
I might take them up on that. I think I think we should try to do that. Sounds fascinating.

917
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:07,600
All right, Brantley, let's see. We're not going to have an episode for this month after this.

918
01:14:07,600 --> 01:14:13,360
This is only one episode because our regular episode on the 21st that would be live and then

919
01:14:13,360 --> 01:14:18,080
released on the Friday the 24th. Well, I'm going to be in Montana with the family. So we're taking

920
01:14:18,080 --> 01:14:23,840
that week off, but we'll be back after that. You can always check out Jupiter broadcasting

921
01:14:23,840 --> 01:14:28,880
dot com slash calendar for our live times. And of course, if you just follow Jupiter tube,

922
01:14:28,880 --> 01:14:32,320
you'll know when we go live as well and you can always hang out there. And of course,

923
01:14:32,320 --> 01:14:35,920
the show comes out on Fridays. If you go to office hours dot hair slash subscribe,

924
01:14:35,920 --> 01:14:39,920
you get the RSS feed and then you don't got to worry about it. It's true. Go get more Brent

925
01:14:39,920 --> 01:14:45,440
on Linux unplugged. There's always stuff going on over there. I always appreciate that. So true.

926
01:14:45,440 --> 01:14:49,360
So true, Brent. How true is it, Chris? It's so true. It's time to close the door.

927
01:14:49,360 --> 01:15:15,440
Clear out, everybody. Office hours are over. Go on. Get out of here.
