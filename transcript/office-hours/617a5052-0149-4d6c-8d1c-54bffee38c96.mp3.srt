00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,760
hello freak bitches welcome to another episode of the bro joke and experience

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:12,200
and on this episode I welcome my friend who's difficult to describe fascinated

3
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:18,720
by him and I hope you'll be too and he is weird and brilliant and sometimes

4
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:23,200
totally insufferable I'm gonna jump ahead just a little bit because the

5
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:30,840
intro goes on for a bit it's always good to see you buddy I'm so happy you came

6
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:36,680
on man yeah it's great to be on the show your audience is just so different from

7
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:41,080
your normal Apple users and that's a good thing it's cool well you know I was

8
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:45,600
an Apple user way before I did this show I've been a fan of yours Macintosh since

9
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,280
the 1980s hmm haha well you know we just kind of

10
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:54,400
figured that out even though Apple is big it's still like half a percent of

11
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:57,720
the total users people who listen to your show are a different group they're

12
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:04,460
weird well that's good so you must be a fan of the show then right I am I am a

13
00:01:04,460 --> 00:01:09,520
fan I mean it's nice to sit back in the car and listen to you ran I've always

14
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:14,480
liked you well uh appreciate that what do you think of that what is what is

15
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:18,320
your takeaway from that crazy clip something feels wrong and I can't quite

16
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:21,600
pinpoint it well one thing that's wrong is that Joe Rogan never interviewed

17
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,720
Steve jobs yeah that's obvious but I'm trying to think of it from the

18
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:30,320
perspective of what if you know and and I heard some weird compression artifacts

19
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:35,140
and that really gave it away for me yeah it's like the speech wasn't consistent

20
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:39,740
between words right that kind of gave it away and it didn't sound like jobs to me

21
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:45,220
I don't know if there's something about the cadence of his speed or like even

22
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:50,640
the quality of it it was totally off for me there's parts that kind of sound

23
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,280
like jobs but so this is you can listen to the entire thing it's a 19 minute

24
00:01:54,280 --> 00:02:00,760
interview over at podcast.ai and the entire 19 minutes is generated by

25
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:06,000
artificial intelligence what about the script I wonder I think if you dig into

26
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,480
it they'd probably tell you they they're actually talking they're taking

27
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:13,160
suggestions and and topics for future ones because it was that the

28
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:16,960
conversational quality was kind of awkward you know what made me think of

29
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:21,960
you're my concern is is like are our days number I mean you point this thing

30
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:25,200
at the JB back catalog you could probably just generate future episodes

31
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:28,880
you know what I mean would they be better I don't know but maybe we could

32
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:35,040
take a week off it's office hours with me Chris

33
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:41,880
hello everyone we're back in the studio Brent's here hey Brent hey

34
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:49,120
mumble rooms here too hey mumble room hello we just have a few folks in there

35
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:53,160
and in the quiet listening join us on a Tuesday at noon Brent you're still here

36
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:59,240
yes somehow I'm still here is today the last day are we taking bets according to

37
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:02,640
my schedule because I happen to check it this morning first time in a few weeks

38
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:07,040
apparently I'm supposed to leave tomorrow well you got another trip to

39
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:10,960
get to as well don't you it's true I am getting home hanging out with the furry

40
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:15,240
pets my brother's pets and mine because he's doing a small trip and then a few

41
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:18,880
days later he and I are driving across Canada that's a long drive what are you

42
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:22,800
didn't get enough road trip it's like three days if you do it well really how

43
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:28,620
is that possible two drivers ah right yeah two drivers no it's gonna be

44
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:32,520
intense and we're not going across the entire thing you know we're starting in

45
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:36,520
the eastern end of BC so we're starting at one end of one of the provinces and

46
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:42,160
we're driving to northern Ontario which is not we're maybe doing a third of the

47
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:45,160
country I would say you're just a road trip pro now it's no big third of the

48
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:49,240
country it's no big whatever we're going to hang out with some family and stuff

49
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:52,680
and pick up two and a half of my motorcycles that I have there and bring

50
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:57,520
them back and then not too long after that you may be off to another event too

51
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:05,920
I almost forgot about that yeah I across much water event I think that's all we

52
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:09,400
can say at this point yeah we'll see we'll see we'll leave it at that we'll

53
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:12,560
leave it at that for now and while you're gone we'll just have that podcast

54
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:16,380
on AI bot stand in oh thanks so we'll just have it you know what's great is we

55
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:21,080
we have all of your tracks individually so we'll just have drew bundle up and

56
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:25,320
feed it to that thing and then it can just generate a Brent co-host while

57
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:28,680
you're traveling okay problem solved right yeah now we just need a way to

58
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:33,600
generate the video version of you for Jupiter tube we're gonna solve that

59
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,680
that sounds a little more difficult actually especially if you need it to

60
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:41,000
lip-sync with the yeah maybe maybe we could just have someone like just do

61
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,320
that thing where we just kind of cut your lips out we just have somebody

62
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:53,360
sitting there upside down try their best to match the generated speech should be

63
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:58,040
fine you'd be fine yeah so you're not gonna get any rest are you gonna get

64
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:01,120
some downtime while your brother's traveling I suppose yeah I guess I got

65
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:08,800
two days yeah there's somewhere but I'm also needing to repack you know laundry

66
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,600
and I have to start thinking about firewood for the winter because that's

67
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:16,240
my main method of eating my space and I gotta say with the trips this year I

68
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:20,200
cannot spend much yeah much attention on that I actually Alex was figuring it out

69
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:27,280
when we saw him in California and he discovered because I don't know he's

70
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:30,680
interested in my life perhaps he discovered that I've been in the US more

71
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:35,400
this year than I've been in Canada and we're slowly converting it's true yeah

72
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:39,080
we're gonna make you a native eventually well I mean I've pretty much worked out

73
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:43,320
all the A's and a boots yeah we've pretty much got rid all those I noticed

74
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:48,400
you saying I'm just trying to help you make you feel at home you know so I'm

75
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:53,560
just curious what are your impressions from the last few weeks is a bit hectic

76
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:58,920
was it was it crazier than you were expecting was it more kind of just

77
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:03,200
always things happening or was it about what you were coming in with in terms of

78
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:07,440
just how much we've been doing really since you got here yeah really I think

79
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:13,200
it's actually I had last year's trip to work with I think had I gone into this

80
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:19,720
year and not had that experience it would have been easily overwhelming last

81
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:26,480
year we did great I think we had a more relaxed schedule would you say I would

82
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:29,960
say we probably had more time in places you know like we spent it felt like a

83
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:34,000
week in Salt Lake City or four or five days at least yeah that was nice yeah

84
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,640
which was not the case this time I love how you thought this was gonna be the

85
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:45,400
easy trip but it turned out so hard that I swore I'd never do this again that's

86
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:50,360
how bad it was a guy who lives full-time in an RV swore he'd never do another

87
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:54,960
road trip like this again I'm done yeah it was a lot harder than I expected and

88
00:06:54,960 --> 00:07:00,680
I think more grueling and I think in part because I haven't road tripped as

89
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:06,640
much so like you don't just like I guess you don't just like pick right up and do

90
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:09,560
seven-hour drive days like it's no big deal I guess you kind of have to work

91
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:12,680
your way to it and I think towards the road towards the end of the road trip I

92
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:17,000
was actually my stamina was building again just it was a little more

93
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:22,480
exhausting so I drove the RV the entire time and you and hadia traded off on the

94
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:27,640
car and so we'd get to somewhere in it and I had just been driving all day long

95
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:32,120
so I just was always kind of behind on energy and a little more exhausted and

96
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:36,960
then when we weren't driving as you know it was always a show day and often it

97
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:41,720
meant that show prep had to happen after like seven hours of driving which was

98
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:48,000
also ideal and our schedule at the best of case like when you're here in studio

99
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,240
and everything's working well and your home is home and not in the RV repair

100
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:57,400
shop or on the road even that schedules a little tight right you you've been

101
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:01,680
doing it for a long time but so there's this rhythm and I think throwing you on

102
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:07,760
the road with all of the mysteries that are what could happen on the road really

103
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:11,560
adds to the tension there and like you said if you're driving for seven hours

104
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:16,320
you can't really work on shows like or do business stuff oh fair and it was the

105
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:19,360
end of a quarter beginning of a quarter which is just not a great time for a

106
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:22,960
business owner to be on the road so I was having to deal with that stuff and

107
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:28,040
not always successfully that was just a matter of timing you know I think the

108
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:32,240
one thing we timed well was the weather was very tolerable the entire time and

109
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:37,360
we really I think time the bottom of gas prices you know because they were coming

110
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:41,080
back up as we were returning home and they've continued to go up as we've been

111
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:45,000
home so I think you know that was the intention of when we time this was let's

112
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,640
not fry ourselves and let's not bankrupt ourselves on gas we did

113
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:53,040
accomplish those two things but what I didn't think about is let's not do it at

114
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,560
the end of a quarter beginning of a quarter that's a business thing you just

115
00:08:55,560 --> 00:09:00,880
got to think of and then what happened was we had technical challenges back here

116
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:03,680
at home base back here at the studio while we were down in California we had

117
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:08,640
failures here and that created all kinds of disruption that just sort of threw

118
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:13,280
everything in the entire manufacturing pipeline out of whack it was like a

119
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:19,440
domino effect that happened and it started really kind of minor stuff you

120
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,960
know things went okay for the most part but like just small thing like our

121
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:26,240
recording gear didn't work at one of the beat-ups it's like a small thing I'm

122
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:30,720
taking full blame on that one but it's it's one of those concepts which is you

123
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,680
know we bought a new recorder which is the same recorder we've used for years

124
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:40,320
and just grabbed an SD card the morning that we took off and never really tested

125
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:45,120
it and that broke one of my sort of cardinal rules which is test absolutely

126
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,200
everything even if you think it's gonna be totally fine and I was like no we're

127
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:51,960
good like we've used this a million times and that was the beginning of that

128
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:57,320
mistake I think and we got to the event and had some SD card errors and it was

129
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:02,480
the only SD card we had on hand which is also a thing no backups I have a bunch

130
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:05,800
of SD cards but I had left them in the RV yeah we were at the meetup when we

131
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:10,240
discovered the SD card is yeah and we're at the meetup and so I couldn't get any

132
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:14,200
audio with our recorder which was kind of sad because those little interviews

133
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:18,240
that I get to do with with fans are really fun yeah you did a few on your

134
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:22,080
phone which was surprisingly good considering the space but it's not no

135
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:25,840
no I think it was a bit of foreshadowing wasn't it and you know you said something

136
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:30,920
there that I realized also is we didn't properly get to test all the different

137
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:35,160
production like each show has a slightly different production line because they

138
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:38,680
have different aspects to them or the different co-hosts yeah different

139
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:42,280
requirements and we didn't test all of them before we left because again time

140
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:46,880
well you would really have to do at least a week's worth of shows yeah from

141
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:52,240
the RV pretending that the studio isn't available to you before we even left

142
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:57,440
which is just not possible just wasn't time I mean we were leaving under such a

143
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:02,520
tight timeline so you know that was our bad we didn't get a proper we didn't get

144
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:09,480
a proper pre-show pre-flight test in and so we just kind of didn't expect

145
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:14,080
problems because in fact one show like Kota radio went just fine when X action

146
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:19,880
news went fine on the road then self-hosted 80 came around and it was

147
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:23,120
one of those problems where we were having an audio issue where the audio

148
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:28,200
just sounded squelchy and yeah really clappy and also too quiet at the same

149
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:32,000
time that was the audio going out in the live stream but nowhere in any point

150
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,160
where we could monitor not anywhere in the studio or in my headphones could we

151
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:41,000
hear it turned out to be an issue with how our jack processing was processing

152
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,440
the signal from the RV but there was no visual indicator none of the VU meters

153
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,900
showed it and of course when you're operating a studio remotely which we

154
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:51,600
were for self-hosted it was streaming through the studio there was no visual

155
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:54,040
indication of any problems so we didn't know anything was wrong until we were

156
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:58,120
live and people were like hey you guys don't sound very good and we're like oh

157
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:01,280
what and it wasn't even the Barry White thing which we're used to yeah that

158
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:04,960
hasn't showed up in a little bit it just was unusable well and the thing that

159
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:09,840
grabbed me was it's an issue in the studio that we've never run into before

160
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:13,560
yeah of course right yeah and so it wasn't like the road gear that we hadn't

161
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:17,480
tested in a year or whatever it was the setup that gets used multiple times a

162
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:21,200
week and this is yeah we had it we had an edge case and no real explanation yet

163
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:25,920
as to why that happened we tried a series yeah yeah we have theories but we

164
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:28,960
haven't been able to fully reproduce that one and then when we were

165
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:34,960
attempting to troubleshoot that I use a tool called rusk desk one word rust desk

166
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:40,400
freaking great it is great I loved it to remote desktop tool for the win like

167
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:44,720
total team viewer killer and I rust desk into the studio machines to get things

168
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:48,460
going and I rust tested into the Reaper machine where we used to record and I

169
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:52,640
could manage the mixer through some software I had X it's called the x32

170
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:57,240
edit software so I had that up and I'm working on things I'm trying to figure

171
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:00,600
out what's going on with our cell phone studies or something wrong on the mixers

172
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:04,800
or some levels that are off and I launched the app and I import the

173
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:09,040
settings from the mixer and as it's loading the entire machine locks up and

174
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:12,160
I dropped my remote connection one of the most vital machines in the entire

175
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:17,360
recording chain it locks up and I lost communication with it for for like a

176
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:20,720
week I just until West was able to get up here and actually a kick it for me

177
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:25,120
and that really hobbled our remote production that started a whole set

178
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:29,200
series of series on series on works arounds like work around on top of work

179
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:33,640
around well and I meant you had to kind of change your expectations and the gear

180
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:37,120
that you were using in the RV as well yeah like you you kind of struggled with

181
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:40,040
having to reorganize oh yeah I had to kind of because we had to work around

182
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:43,160
the machine where we brought in the audio the machine was responsible for

183
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:46,400
bringing a remote audio I had to completely bypass it remotely it meant

184
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:49,920
we couldn't do self-hosted live we just all these things that we had to sort out

185
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:54,600
and then it really was a knock-on effect from there there in attempting to build

186
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:59,360
all the workarounds to fix that other things broke ironically you know coder

187
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:02,720
always went pretty well like I always coder managed to go fine for the most

188
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:08,120
part did them all live even didn't have to do one of them off there land went

189
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:13,640
fine well I see a pattern here every time I'm in the room there's something

190
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:18,820
to that and then we had other issues an app updated that we didn't realize it

191
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:24,120
updated and it no longer let you set the in and out audio interfaces oh I forgot

192
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:27,640
about that that was just random another issue was at one point one of the

193
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:31,080
services we use for VoIP like one of the backup ones that we go to when we're

194
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:34,200
having problems they were having their own outage and at first we weren't sure

195
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:36,720
if it was us or them like that kind of stuff was happening while we were trying

196
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:43,840
to record and then we had the absolute hardest Linux unplugged ever where after

197
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:49,200
the Pasadena meetup in the JPL tour West flew back home to fix the studio and he

198
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:52,920
got everything up and running you and I connected in from the RV back it's we

199
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:57,960
were in Sacramento at that point and I'm thinking this is gonna be easy it seemed

200
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:01,200
like everything was this is the one yeah finally we're gonna have an easy one

201
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:05,800
West is in studio he can fix the crash machine he can run the board we've got

202
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:10,240
Ethernet from Jeff you know he's hooked us up with power we're comfortable we've

203
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:14,680
got power we've got solid internet we've got West back at the HQ running the

204
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:21,200
board this is gonna be the easy one and whatever whatever that was so wrong

205
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:24,200
because we ended up having these horrible echo issues between each other

206
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:29,360
that is still sometimes in here we have to solve and again I actually believe we

207
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:33,120
thought it was at the RV because that seemed the most logical place for it to

208
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:37,760
be happening but now I'm actually suspecting it's here in the studio well

209
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:41,480
you ran into it yesterday morning with coder and I had to switch to a back of

210
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:45,760
body interface and that's what the second thing in the studio that seems

211
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:49,640
like a mystery that we've never run into before that yeah the studio setup hadn't

212
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:54,800
really changed no no no we'll have to trace that one down I think yeah so

213
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:59,040
that's a lot of fun and we have three machines in here that were built around

214
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:05,600
2017 2018 and they're just getting old and they run what 24-7 and the reason

215
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:09,520
for that is because when I when I did turn them on and off the failure rate

216
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:15,360
was even higher so and you know like things change so yeah it's sort of like

217
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:18,240
one of those problems that we're gonna have to sort out in part with some new

218
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:22,400
hardware but also just like recheck our audio chain and work through all that

219
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:27,800
but I think what I decided is no more just we've never nailed it you know like

220
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:30,840
I thought this was the road trip we were gonna nail it and it was gonna be a by

221
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:34,040
the numbers road trip we're going up and down i-5 should be simple we're not

222
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:37,360
going any further than Sacramento we're gonna have solid Ethernet setup we're

223
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:41,480
gonna have power this is gonna be the easy one in fact maybe I picked one that

224
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:44,680
was too easy it was actually what I was thinking before the road trip crazy man

225
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:48,680
I know and now afterwards I'm like I'm never doing that again and I'm gonna

226
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:53,040
rethink how we do remote shows and I think what I want to do instead is I

227
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:58,520
want to switch to doing shows at venues where ideally we'd have a low ticket

228
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:01,720
price that just enough to cover our operational costs to get us out there

229
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:05,400
and do the show and cover hotel or whatever we'd have to do or gas if I

230
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:10,600
drive it and we just do shows at venues that would you know let some lousy

231
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:14,360
podcasters in and then afterwards we do the meet-and-greet we do the food and

232
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:18,600
drink but everybody gets a chance to talk to us if they want we walk away

233
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:23,080
with show content that's been produced and then we because what we do right now

234
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:29,600
is the exact frickin opposite we travel we spend days traveling we set up a

235
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:33,280
meetup we meet up with somewhere between 30 and 100 people maybe if we're lucky

236
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:38,400
200 people and then we you know we go all out we party for like five hours with

237
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:44,220
these with these folks then we go home exhausted probably hungover and then we

238
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:48,400
have to do a show the next day and it's like well what we just we just did all

239
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:52,120
the traveling we just did all the meetup stuff we just spent five hours doing

240
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:56,880
stuff and we don't have a show and by the way when did we work on the show

241
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:01,440
it's crazy right and so we are we're constantly running full speed because we

242
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:04,200
know this enough that we know like okay we need to be working on a show we got

243
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,680
so we're working on meetups working on shows we're doing travel days we're

244
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:10,160
doing it all together and it's just crazy when instead we could go to a

245
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:14,640
venue we could have the meetup we could produce a show we could have an easy way

246
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:17,560
to meet and greet so everybody who comes out as an opportunity to say hi

247
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:21,280
because sometimes people travel for like 25 hours and don't even get a chance to

248
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:23,800
say hi because it's just kind of a you know everybody's just hanging out

249
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:29,440
chatting I don't know I haven't fully figured it out yet I think in part we

250
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:33,920
were doing this because there were no events there was no Linux fest for us

251
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:37,640
to go to right well I feel like when we did in Denver that was like the very

252
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:42,200
beginning of any events happening yeah and is probably partly responsible for

253
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:46,560
the great amazing turnouts that we had as well and it felt like back then that

254
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:50,560
was exactly the thing to do yeah and okay we struggled and then actually the

255
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:53,600
funny thing is everything we struggled with on that trip we salt on this trip

256
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:58,160
and never had issues with internet etc yeah yeah I know we solve it and there's

257
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:02,040
a whole new set of problems every trip mm-hmm and and we did pre-records as

258
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:08,480
well right and even then so yeah I feel like another advantage to doing this

259
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:13,240
idea that you have of doing live on the road shows is that actually as a fan

260
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:16,800
it's really fun to see the production happening I know we have peer tube

261
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:21,000
Jupiter tube and that's kind of neat but to see it in person and to see all the

262
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,760
moving parts and stuff is actually part of the attraction and so we've had

263
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:29,800
listeners want to you know come to the studio and or even be in jupes when we're

264
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:32,880
doing some recordings and that's just sometimes not possible right with the

265
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:36,700
how much we're juggling so I think actually doing a live show since sounds

266
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:39,720
like a lot of fun from both angles from I hadn't thought about that listeners

267
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:43,560
yeah it is kind of a behind-the-scenes thing too isn't it and I imagine now I

268
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:49,800
hope going into 2023 I hope that more of our community events are back and those

269
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:53,800
might be possible venues we could do shows at as well and so we don't really

270
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:58,160
need to be creating the venue in the show and the event so much maybe now and

271
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:01,320
instead we can kind of go to ones that are being organized by the community or

272
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:05,880
maybe people in our community in our audience know of venues in their area

273
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:09,640
that would be amenable to some lousy podcasters coming in there and talking

274
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:15,440
about geeky Linux stuff and then maybe you know we put together is some sort

275
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:18,920
of new formula we come up with for getting out there and seeing people and

276
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:22,680
doing shows on the road and keeping it interesting for us helping us reconnect

277
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:26,240
with the audience which keeps us grounded and also keeps us energized

278
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:29,680
without having to kill ourselves on these road trips and then you know for

279
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:34,880
me personally too it just puts a ton of wear and tear on my RV that I pay for

280
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:38,880
out-of-pocket personally for years because you know you damaged something

281
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:43,480
on one road trip and it breaks six months later you know who pays for that

282
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:48,840
I do right and so there's an element of that as well it's like well do I really

283
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:52,940
want to put all this wear and tear on my personal home for for this when you know

284
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:56,680
maybe there's a smarter way to do it I personally prefer to travel that way you

285
00:20:56,680 --> 00:21:00,120
know I prefer to have my workspace I prefer to have my bed my bathroom I've

286
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:04,000
heard from listeners who have worked in hotels and I have heard some awful horror

287
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,200
stories about hotels and it makes me never want to stay in the hotel so we'll

288
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:12,200
see but you know sometimes it does seem like it would be a better way to go and

289
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:16,320
I think we should be careful like I don't want this whole conversation to

290
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:24,440
feel Debian Downer or anything because actually we had an amazing time at

291
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:28,920
every meetup that we went to and occasionally you know the morning of

292
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:34,360
or like oh we're so kind of beat that you know do we really feel like doing a

293
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:37,600
meetup right now but then we get there and it was like that was the best part

294
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:41,800
of the trip for me oh yeah every meetup was absolutely great and like way out

295
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:45,400
did expectations and everybody's amazing and and like you're drinking out of a

296
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:50,040
cup that everybody's signed right now just as a memory and I go in here too

297
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:55,440
yeah that's just been amazing it really it was it was really great and honestly

298
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:59,880
like by the time we got to Portland I was ready to quit podcasting I was ready

299
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:05,480
to quit RV and I was ready to just quit I was done and and the and the drive

300
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:12,040
through Portland was brutally grindy it was just horrible traffic and then the

301
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:17,280
meetup just flipped it all around for me yeah and so I I feel like yeah the

302
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:21,080
meetups are totally worth it we ran into a heck of a lot of trouble in other

303
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:24,640
areas having to do with the shows that we do every week which is hilarious and

304
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:29,440
lady jupes was fine too which is yeah thing we had zero mechanical issues in

305
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:33,520
either vehicles because we also took a chase car no car problems no jupes

306
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:39,840
problems jupes executed and functioned 100% and no like near accidents I

307
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:44,280
remember last year we had a close call and so from that perspective like a lot

308
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:48,280
of stuff worked but the stuff that didn't work just sometimes shadowed some

309
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:52,200
of her our emotions yeah the whole trip well and there's I think there's an

310
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:55,880
element to like I mean this sounds weird but if you get an accident there's

311
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:59,360
almost this like well what can you do what could you do well I've been there

312
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:03,040
done that right it's like it really sucks especially when it's your home but

313
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:08,880
like what can you do but when you have technical failures and gear failures and

314
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:13,880
application failures it feels like well we could have prevented that did it eat

315
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:16,760
at you in a way like that while it was happening like shit I should have did

316
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:21,440
better or because I feel like partly with all the software updates and like

317
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:26,400
random things I definitely wish we could have tested more I think what really was

318
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:31,280
rough about it just from like a psychological standpoint was a lot of

319
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:37,320
the technical issues struck after we were already live so then it's like okay

320
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:42,680
you're live you don't want to leave dead air but you also are trying to visualize

321
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:46,520
a virtual studio because the RV is a virtual studio you've got to visualize

322
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:52,120
the entire wiring of a mixer in a virtual studio in your head and then

323
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:56,460
also because I'm not here in this studio I also need to visualize the entire in

324
00:23:56,460 --> 00:24:00,840
and out layout of this studio how it all works where in that layout this problem

325
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:06,400
could potentially be keep all of that state in my head troubleshoot it while

326
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:09,840
also trying to like play music or chat with the chat room or just keep

327
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:13,080
conversation going which is great when you or Wes are there and you can help

328
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:16,800
with that but and then also there's just this pressure of well the longer this is

329
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:21,760
a problem the longer people have to wait and that gets that gets to be kind of

330
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:25,800
old I have to say and when it's every single live stream for two weeks in a

331
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:30,680
row you start to get like god I'm just sick and tired of doing this you know if

332
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:34,200
you were maybe in the metaverse you could trace your trace your lines on

333
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:39,200
your virtual mixer there I think the other thing that wasn't related to show

334
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:45,240
production but did kind of tilt things towards like this has been an awful road

335
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:49,400
trip it was an awful road trip punctuated with a lot of great stuff

336
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:56,280
like Jeff and his setup and his hospitality and Brittany's hospitality

337
00:24:56,280 --> 00:25:03,080
was just absolutely legendary easily the meetups were just incredible

338
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:09,560
rejuvenating motivating and then JPL the tour of JPL was something I'll remember

339
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:12,480
for the rest of my life and would like to go back every few years and do again

340
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:17,080
right so like hard road trip punctuated with a lot of greatness here and there

341
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:21,440
and so it's a weird mix but one thing I think that tilted it for me towards the

342
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:27,040
negative and it's still an issue today is my home server that runs the heating

343
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:32,880
the lighting the security system the camera system and parts of you know the

344
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:39,800
network it died and man was that bad timing just a really bad time when did

345
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:45,040
it die and oh I know when it died oh yeah oh well it died while we were in

346
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:49,280
Pasadena at the chorus at the Airbnb everything was dying where we weren't

347
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:54,400
yeah you're right it was remote failures every single time and it was just one

348
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:58,880
evening at the at the Airbnb I wasn't able to get pull up home assistant check

349
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:04,400
on jupes anymore and then my backup recovery strategy my date is fine but I

350
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:09,200
had like this pie I could swap in that didn't work you know cuz I never tested

351
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:16,480
that great idea bad execution and so this was weeks ago now two weeks ago

352
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:21,760
that this died and we still haven't had five minutes to plug an HDMI monitor in

353
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:25,720
and see what's wrong with that pie well and to make it worse we had to tear out

354
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:29,800
the entire setup out of your RV yesterday yeah before we even got a

355
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:33,400
chance to troubleshoot it we ripped it all out because I'm finally getting my

356
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:39,220
living room slide fixed and they are completely taking apart the entire slide

357
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:44,560
because they're removing the floor it's crazy and so the server had to come out

358
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:49,240
they're taking like one of the four walls out of your home yeah and then

359
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:54,100
rebuilding one of the floors in our living room and so the pie had to come

360
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:58,200
out and so we have it here in a box but I'm just gonna rebuild it my home

361
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:02,360
assistant yellow came in and I've got an idea I'm honestly I'm really tempted to

362
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:08,280
get a NUC maybe like an i5 or an i3 NUC with maybe 16 gigs of RAM something

363
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:12,880
that supports quicksync you get the right NUC and they only pull under load

364
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:17,320
like 15 watts yeah I think we we did touch on this in the last self hosted

365
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:20,680
if you want to hear more about it right yep and I think I'm gonna get one with

366
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:25,800
thunderbolt I think is the way to go with that we'll see we shall see but I

367
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:28,320
want to take a moment and I want to thank Linode for making the road trip

368
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:32,400
possible for supporting us for just being crazy like that and investing in

369
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:36,960
community Linode comm slash Jupiter go there to get $100 in credit for a 60 day

370
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:41,740
account for 60 days on a new account and go there to support the show also if

371
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:45,880
you're learning Linode has a lot of really great resources this is an area I

372
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:48,680
don't focus on a lot in the other shows but it's something I think maybe I'd

373
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:54,280
like to let you guys know about if you're curious about Kubernetes or

374
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:56,960
learning just things like infrastructures code in general maybe

375
00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:03,120
terraform ansible puppet chef or salt they have an infrastructure as code

376
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:08,600
ebook series it's about 200 pages each tools covered as a standalone project

377
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:12,800
you learn a little bit about them you get a little kind of overview on how to

378
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:17,640
work it all with Docker and how to use github and work with all of these tools

379
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:20,760
it's free I don't even think you I don't even think you have to give me your

380
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:24,080
email address let me go look I don't even think Linode asked for your email

381
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:27,800
address I think they just let you download the ebook yep instant download

382
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:32,320
13 megs you don't have to give me your email address and then you get a great

383
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:37,800
great walkthrough on this stuff they have so much documentation over here

384
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:44,480
learn k8 slabs cloud simplified there's all kinds of stuff over including video

385
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:49,120
series to Linux beginner video series they also have one-click deployments so

386
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:53,760
if you've never really deployed a server before it's so easy and they make it

387
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:57,280
they've just updated their marketplace UI to make it super clear what's new

388
00:28:57,280 --> 00:29:01,480
what's hot let's go try that and if you want to do something like a little more

389
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:05,400
advanced well you can go crazy like we did they'll give you documentation on

390
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:08,960
how to build it up from the metal we've got a Nix box running on Linode and I

391
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:15,920
have this crazy VPN conglomerate box that's made by a pep wave for my mobile

392
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:20,720
router and it's their own custom Linux distro and Linode makes it possible for

393
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:25,000
me to even load that and then they have s3 object storage they have a fantastic

394
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:30,280
interface an API for days that makes it really easy to integrate take snapshots

395
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:35,120
use a command-line tool go see why over a million customers worldwide love Linode

396
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:37,640
some of my friends have been using it for a decade I've been using it for

397
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:41,120
nearly three years and they have some of the best performance and some of the

398
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:45,560
best pricing Linode comm slash Jupiter that's where you go to get $100 and 60

399
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:49,280
day credit on a new account and it's a great way to support the show Linode

400
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:54,960
comm slash Jupiter and I will put a link to that infrastructure as code ebook in

401
00:29:54,960 --> 00:30:01,680
the show notes in the nizzles so that way you can go grab that and you can

402
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:06,080
learn a Kate yourself on that that's some good stuff right there you know

403
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:09,160
about learning Kate and Brent I'm starting to learn a Kate about it hey

404
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:13,940
what have we learned a Kate about our website because while you and I were on

405
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:20,960
the road work continued on and the community has just been really really

406
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:25,120
sticking with it and producing some really great features some great fixes

407
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:28,680
and nice tidying up I mean there's a lot we could talk about here so where do you

408
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:33,360
want to go what do you want to focus on today yeah I feel like it's been a big

409
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:40,520
week both because I've been away from the website work in a way that first I

410
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:43,600
was really worried about and we touched on this in the last office hours but

411
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:47,480
actually now that I'm having the chance to reflect on it I feel is actually a

412
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:51,780
huge success story oh okay hold on zoom in on that for a second zoom in and

413
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:56,580
hands on that Brantley mm-hmm so I was worried that maybe the momentum would

414
00:30:56,580 --> 00:31:02,680
kind of start to slow because I've been in there you know let's say helping

415
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:06,520
people accomplish amazing things I'm not the one doing the amazing things I'm

416
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:11,800
just kind of nudging and so it's kind of worried that us being on the road meant

417
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:15,440
that I could spend less time doing that and that would mean people would be less

418
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:19,320
excited about contributing but actually it's been the total opposite the

419
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:27,480
community even gave me or trying to test PRS while sitting in the front of lady

420
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:32,880
jeeps bouncing around the i5 because they're like you you're busy on the road

421
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:37,880
like let's do this when you get back about working on the website while going

422
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:41,400
down the road right right well that was my only opportunity to really check in

423
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:46,440
and you've got a pretty nice work area there but it's it's very tricky as

424
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:52,920
things are jumping and bouncing around but so I feel like a thank you for

425
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:56,520
taking care of me everyone while I was on the trip and making sure I'm a little

426
00:31:56,520 --> 00:32:00,960
bit more sane and not trying to push myself too hard but also just for taking

427
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:06,960
the helm while I was gone and I promoted CG bass player this week to having some

428
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:13,160
access to do some triage and things like that congratulations space player yeah

429
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:18,120
they've been amazing at submitting some pretty great PRS in the last I don't know

430
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:22,880
a month or two even and I just thought geez there's some great people who I've

431
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:27,200
built a lot of trust with and they've been just helping organize everything

432
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:32,560
along with everyone else who's already been doing that so thank you for making

433
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:36,200
my job a little bit easier but what that's also meant is that there's some

434
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:41,880
really amazing PRS that have come in in the last week and they aren't quite I

435
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:46,960
would say they're not quite merged yet I was struggling this morning cuz I was

436
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:51,240
like we got to get these merge office hours creates a deadline you're right

437
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:55,520
Elray helped me walk off the ledge there because actually we don't want to hurry

438
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:59,320
PRS to true to talk about them what we want is actually great PRS and what's

439
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:03,240
happening is that one of them in specific is to automate the sponsors

440
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:08,100
page I made a sponsors page back in I don't know a month or two ago when we

441
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:12,840
were first going live because I thought well a good function is to be able to go

442
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:16,080
to our website when you're trying to sign up for you know Linode or something

443
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:19,400
like that and to get the URL we mentioned them in the shows all the time

444
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:23,400
and you can go to the show notes and sometimes get them but that's not always

445
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:27,040
true and having them all in one place one right right and if you also think

446
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:31,040
about this website as a platform that other podcasters could adopt one day

447
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:35,360
that's a feature other podcasters would want to that's a very good point so I

448
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:42,920
was like a monkey creating this sponsors page just with text um you know I was

449
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:47,080
copy and pasting right because I I don't know what I'm doing and that was good

450
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:50,080
enough for version one our first milestone of the website when it went

451
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:55,720
live and it looked fine but here's what I love is that I came around and I was

452
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:59,560
like geez we haven't updated that updated that in a while and so I made a

453
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:02,680
few updates you know we have some new sponsors or new links and descriptions

454
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:07,160
and stuff like that so I threw them in there but just in my PR which was just

455
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:12,560
text updated text I wrote we shouldn't do this like this again we should we

456
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:17,200
should automate this we've been talking about automating it and sure enough the

457
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:22,520
next day chance wrote up a PR to automate the whole thing and there's

458
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:25,800
been a lot of discussions and like improvements and back and forth between

459
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:31,760
community members on improving that initial PR and I think that's the real

460
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:36,920
that's exactly what we want it's like not quick PRs to be submitted to the

461
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:41,560
website to add functionality but this like constructive building of this

462
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:46,760
amazing modular piece of technology that we're gonna throw at the website and

463
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:51,920
then it'll be solid so I feel like it's maybe you know a day or two away from

464
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:57,960
being merged into our production but it's still super exciting so I want to

465
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:01,800
mention it that is a really cool thing you know people are looking at

466
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:05,520
accessibility people caught some bad links for like my my referral to

467
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:09,840
fountain there's just little things to big things right and it's stuff that we

468
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:16,280
just as a team don't put a lot of focus on because just culturally we haven't

469
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:20,680
really built that that muscle but we're bringing in what feels like a team of

470
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:24,040
people who are thinking about those things that we don't catch little stuff

471
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:26,160
that we just don't catch sometimes because we're moving on to the next

472
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:29,400
thing all the time and I think that was your real insight in in wanting to make

473
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:33,960
the website an open source project was that the listeners have a very

474
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:39,280
different perspective of even just our website yeah and we do yeah and you know

475
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:43,240
we don't I've been trying to use the website as much as possible to find

476
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:47,000
those little errors in it but we don't always you know go to our own website to

477
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:50,040
use it we have the back channels that create the content that make it to the

478
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:53,720
website right and so the listeners have been amazing at catching those things

479
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:58,760
like you mentioned yeah I love that part of it so we have more to talk about the

480
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:02,560
website I think when we get to the boost but I did know that there is a JB and a

481
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:07,800
hacktoberfest thread tell us a little bit about that good catch I heard a

482
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:12,920
bunch of listeners in the last I would say three weeks suggest that we should

483
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:16,640
participate in hacktoberfest now you and I were on the road and I was like oh

484
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:20,920
that sounds interesting I actually am not that familiar with it so I'll have

485
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:25,120
to add that to the queue of things I need to look into but it came up over

486
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:28,160
and over and over and Reese was kind enough to write an issue about it and

487
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:31,800
said hey we should just do this here's how you do it it's pretty easy so it

488
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:34,920
turns out Chris have you heard of hacktoberfest before I think I'm

489
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:38,200
familiar with at least what it used to be I'm not sure if I'm familiar with its

490
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:43,520
current iteration but I think it's a digital ocean originated idea but kind

491
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:48,560
of is just kind of the I think the idea is to encourage people to participate in

492
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:52,400
open source and there's a way you can kind of show that you've done that and

493
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:56,280
you then can get some stuff from them or you could get some stuff from them

494
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:59,600
that's about as much as I remember how am I doing I think you're doing great

495
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:03,920
okay yeah that's the whole that's the whole the pitch right there I think you

496
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:10,040
hit it you nailed it it is a digital ocean okay initiative and it turns out

497
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:13,780
it's been happening for nine years yeah that really caught me and their website

498
00:37:13,780 --> 00:37:18,200
is actually super fun to browse and has a bit of that you know digital ocean

499
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:23,000
playfulness that we've seen from time to time now they've taken the spam issues

500
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:26,440
seriously I think that's probably what people if they have any kind of negative

501
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:29,840
association with hacktoberfest it's probably that there was a period of time

502
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:33,400
where it seemed to be like just generating random spam contributions

503
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:36,760
just so you could enter into the hacktoberfest drawings or whatever they

504
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:40,680
are but I think that they've addressed that with some of their measures yes so

505
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:44,960
the idea with hacktoberfest for us at least in this project which is focusing

506
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:50,980
on our website is to maybe push us to work a little bit harder to get some

507
00:37:50,980 --> 00:37:55,840
contributions in for those who have been maybe thinking of participating but

508
00:37:55,840 --> 00:38:00,560
haven't quite jumped in that's a great time but for us on the maintainership

509
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:05,160
side is just to look at our you know hundred-plus issues that we have and to

510
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:10,920
sort them in a way that maybe are easier to solve some of them are pretty

511
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:14,440
nebulous in their description so I've been going through and trying to make

512
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:18,320
them a little bit more well-defined so that someone can say okay I'm gonna work

513
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:22,200
on this issue and it's very well-defined I just need to walk through the steps so

514
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:27,740
I've been working a little bit on housekeeping shall we say and so if you

515
00:38:27,740 --> 00:38:30,720
are thinking of participating there's a few steps and it's actually really easy

516
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:34,840
so you just need to register hacktoberfest isn't calm Chris can you

517
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:40,160
check that for me it is hacktoberfest calm so you just need to register any

518
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:45,640
time before October 31 make some pull requests or our project or any other

519
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:52,600
hacktoberfest linked topic on github or gitlab as well and have one of your PR

520
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:58,280
actually it's four of your PRs merged oh okay so it's kind of like a sign of

521
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:01,640
success I guess I see and they need to be tagged as well with hacktoberfest yeah

522
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:06,720
so that's where I come in is I've been I created some tags hacktoberfest tag and

523
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:11,120
there also needs to be a hacktoberfest dash accepted tag so I'm going to be

524
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:15,400
pretty diligent on trying to make sure that those who are participating get the

525
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:18,920
right tags that they can you know get the recognition for their work I mean I

526
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:23,760
think what I like about this is the range is pretty pretty wide like if you

527
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:28,460
don't really have a lot of skills we have some issues that are like fix a bad

528
00:39:28,460 --> 00:39:32,560
URL yeah you know how to make a right good URL you could probably do things

529
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:37,880
okay and I think that's the real benefit here is that there's a ton of different

530
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:44,880
ways to contribute and so if you don't know how Hugo works like me then there

531
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:47,560
are a bunch of different ways you can help us out and I've been trying to use

532
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:50,680
issues as a way of tracking those different tasks some of them are just

533
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:54,200
like hey we need these links to be external links and here's how you do it

534
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:58,120
we just don't have time to do it so if someone wants to just sit down for an

535
00:39:58,120 --> 00:40:04,320
hour and do that or even less so we will link to our hacktoberfest tagged issues

536
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:09,200
I think I have maybe at least a good handful I spent late last night while we

537
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:15,360
were walking watching Rick and Marty out of this this cup here the signed cup

538
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:20,360
from our Portland nice about that meetup meetup cup right on the one little bit

539
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:23,680
of wine a little bit of website work a little bit of Rick and Morty it was fun

540
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:29,000
and so I did tag a bunch of them I will keep trying to add more and if any

541
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:35,000
listeners have other ideas for topics that can be solved in this hacktoberfest

542
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:40,840
what would you call a window of time well yeah we will try hard to push to

543
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:43,400
make a lot of contributions in this time so if you want to participate it's

544
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:47,320
actually pretty easy we've got some links to doing that and we'd love to get

545
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:51,400
you to participate so thank you yeah the period of festing is now you must

546
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:55,760
participate during the fest window and before we completely move off the

547
00:40:55,760 --> 00:41:00,080
website I just I noted that you had a couple of notable PRS in here and one

548
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:07,040
from Elry about deploying previews this is such a great example of how amazing

549
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:10,040
our community is like when you hear us talking about this and you're like what

550
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:13,880
are these guys really tangibly talking about we'll put a link to this PR

551
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:19,640
request number 456 in the show notes just so you can see just how incredible

552
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:24,040
this conversation is and the people working on this are so so so great

553
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:28,080
really I mean I feel like every week already just comes in with something

554
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:33,280
really awesome I'm I feel like you know we've been saying thank you Elray for

555
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:37,840
weeks now on the show and unfortunately we have to say it again thank you Elray

556
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:43,920
Elray Elray you said Elry earlier I did I it's it's actually Alex so thanks

557
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:48,200
Alex yeah Alex we could do that or we could do biggie you know the biggie the

558
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:51,080
big L I think you're on to something yeah cuz I mean otherwise we get Alex

559
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:55,440
infused with Alex that's just it right I don't do that mm-hmm yeah mm-hmm so

560
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:59,800
thanks biggie we appreciate your biggie energy and we'll have a link to that

561
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:04,760
just that's a great example but some of our first boosts well not our very first

562
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:07,800
but some of our boosts are actually about the website ask not what your

563
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:14,160
podcast can boost for you but what you can boost for your podcast oh we got a

564
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:17,400
we got a big boost a couple of big boosts coming you know what actually I'm

565
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:21,800
gonna stop right here stop the show for a second you know and just say we got

566
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:26,400
some remarkable audience support via the boost and what you'll see is there's a

567
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:29,440
few core members of our audience who really are stepping up and supporting

568
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:33,520
office hours I'm blown away by some of that this week so let's start with

569
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:38,440
optimus gray who sent in a row of grandpa ducks twenty two thousand two

570
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:44,200
hundred and twenty two sad things are looking up but all but duck so I love

571
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:50,480
this so optimus drove for like 24 hours each way to come to the JPL tour crazy

572
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:56,480
and also made it to the Pasadena meetup mm-hmm and so on his way back on his

573
00:42:56,480 --> 00:43:01,680
drive home we got a series of boosts some ideas this is my first stop on the

574
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:05,920
way home from the Southern California meetup with Brent making fun of me and

575
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:12,120
rightly so I now have a list of favorite JB members they are Wes Alex Mike Chris

576
00:43:12,120 --> 00:43:15,080
Wow these are in order of importance he's

577
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:24,320
bacon drew yeah his meow not mine jar jar Joe Hayden Levi and then Brent Wow

578
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:29,040
at the end Brent can only move back up the list if he works on a toy drinking

579
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:34,200
bird that can continue to touch Alex's chair over and over again I think that

580
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:38,440
sounds like it's worth doing Wow wonderful reference there also perhaps

581
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:41,840
the California State Border Patrol asked you about fruit and vegetables because

582
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:45,640
you had a Canadian with you hey now I had no problems coming from Nevada I

583
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:50,400
have always been asked at the border if I have fruit and veggies or produce or

584
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:53,560
whatever it's always been a thing they've always done that and I always

585
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:59,280
think is that just like pretext for stopping me are they really they set up

586
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:02,720
these all these border crossings at the state border just to stop every single

587
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:06,040
person and ask them if they got fruit in their car it's just the weirdest thing

588
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:09,520
they don't grow things in the panel oh that could be there's no way you could

589
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:13,760
be bringing any fruit or produce because Nevada ain't got nothing let's see Wow

590
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:17,680
look at you coming in with the shade jizzing optimist Greg comes in with a

591
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:21,720
double grandpa duck boost thank you kindly okay maybe I was trolling Alex

592
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:25,920
Brent and Chris too much in my last boost sorry Wes but maybe next time I'll

593
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:30,040
troll you how I do like the ideas who's giving us a show name because this is

594
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:33,200
something we need to we need to figure out another back from the road trip I do

595
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:37,920
like the name chat or sats for a JB extra sub channel like a brunch with

596
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:41,520
Brent I came up with four name replacements for office hours when I was

597
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:46,280
driving home oh it's 29 hours not 24 hours I had a lot of time to think I'm

598
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:49,920
gonna check those names in the podcast index on duck duck and on YouTube and

599
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:53,920
I'll report back are you ready this is amazing

600
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:59,560
optimus gray then comes in with a third boost boost with twenty thousand four

601
00:44:59,560 --> 00:45:04,800
hundred eighty sats here are the three show name ideas after visiting JPL you

602
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:08,680
ready for these I think so I think we should write these down I feel like I

603
00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:10,920
don't want to lose track of these cuz we've got to come up with a new show

604
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:15,480
name you got a pen over there Brent Lee's pulling out a pad of paper yeah I

605
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:21,600
need a pen I got a I got a marker I see nothing in my alright you ready hmm so

606
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:28,360
his first name suggestion is I of Jupiter interesting not bad right he

607
00:45:28,360 --> 00:45:33,640
says it's kind of like the idea is what's JB looking at looking for looking

608
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:41,920
towards another one orbit of Jupiter uh-huh so if you picture like a bunch of

609
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:45,720
ideas and things and projects floating around yeah what's going on around JB's

610
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:51,800
kind of like a subtext his next one is IO which is a moon of Jupiter and of

611
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:55,960
course input output which is kind of akin to like listener feedback and then

612
00:45:55,960 --> 00:46:01,120
output on the podcast so IO so both because it's a moon and because we do a

613
00:46:01,120 --> 00:46:05,960
lot of input output with the audience in this show you know I feel like that is

614
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:11,720
my favorite one is short also yeah short is interesting I also unfortunately feel

615
00:46:11,720 --> 00:46:15,120
like it might be the hardest to look for which is the Brahma having right now

616
00:46:15,120 --> 00:46:20,100
yeah you could almost see like three three less than three letters might be

617
00:46:20,100 --> 00:46:23,200
really hard for a lot of searching I mean it could be like Jupiter IO yeah

618
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:26,720
you know the only problem with that is in it with all of these really and it's

619
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:29,400
my fault because I named the network this way oh Chris but doesn't it make

620
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:33,000
you think of like it should be like a space podcast about Jupiter isn't that

621
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:38,660
what we talked about I enjoyed the last meetup on this trip remember a good

622
00:46:38,660 --> 00:46:42,320
system crashes a good system crash means more content for podcasting I guess that

623
00:46:42,320 --> 00:46:46,840
is the upside system crash not 12 system crashes thank you thank you

624
00:46:46,840 --> 00:46:51,560
alright lurks a lot came in with a lot to share with elite set of stats office

625
00:46:51,560 --> 00:46:57,640
hours his new name needs to have a space theme like the network there you go so

626
00:46:57,640 --> 00:47:04,800
so Jupiter base is his suggestion Jupiter base we think of that I could

627
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:09,120
live with base he also recommends Jupiter production lounge I'll play on

628
00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:13,680
JPL that's funny I could see that too I'm writing all these down guys I'm

629
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:17,400
writing all these down I'm gonna look at these I'm gonna think on these after the

630
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:20,760
show because I really do want to come up with a better name and something that's

631
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:25,080
unique to the show I think and kind of fun he says also each location could

632
00:47:25,080 --> 00:47:29,160
have a spacey name so lady jupes could actually be called Jupiter station so

633
00:47:29,160 --> 00:47:32,640
you know you're coming to coming in from Jupiter station kind of like a ground

634
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:38,360
control to major Brent just gonna have the right names to have fun and then

635
00:47:38,360 --> 00:47:44,600
lurks a lot comes in with a triple boo wow is it really a hundred and thirty

636
00:47:44,600 --> 00:47:52,280
three thousand seven hundred sats that's like a mega leet sat it may be a typo

637
00:47:53,640 --> 00:47:58,080
thank you to our community who has been sourcing the boost clips on our github

638
00:47:58,080 --> 00:48:02,360
so he wanted to comment on how we have fun with like the leet sats thing you

639
00:48:02,360 --> 00:48:07,880
know and he says for me the childish leet elitism and macho thing is all tongue

640
00:48:07,880 --> 00:48:12,320
in cheek it's just a fun sarcastic joke and a poke at my own imposter syndrome

641
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:16,660
tendencies but it's fun to gamify these things as a form of self motivation so

642
00:48:16,660 --> 00:48:25,960
to that end achievement unlocked I have used boost CLI and done from my um bro

643
00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:32,480
you're doing a good job good job lurks a lot that's impressive man that is tell

644
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:36,440
me lurks a lot isn't that sort of like the ultimate technical unlock

645
00:48:36,440 --> 00:48:39,240
achievement I mean it really does doesn't it feel good he says it's an

646
00:48:39,240 --> 00:48:42,760
achievement unlocked I agree I'm so proud of you that is man click building

647
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:47,040
gentoo back in the day it is it is it's a lot like that if it has that same kind

648
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:51,720
of thing you really learn how a lot of this works and much like when I did that

649
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:56,520
with gentoo I gained a whole new respect like that was truly what got me to

650
00:48:56,520 --> 00:49:00,440
understand and appreciate Linux was building gentoo and arch systems and

651
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:04,080
learning how it actually worked compared to Windows and then I learned such a

652
00:49:04,080 --> 00:49:07,280
deep respect and appreciation for that system and I feel like it's the same way

653
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:11,320
when you do boost CLI in some ways I'm kind of envious of you lurks that's just

654
00:49:11,320 --> 00:49:14,880
such a fun place to be again so that's great and he came in get ready for this

655
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:24,760
Brent are you ready for this I think so a quad boost from sir lurks a lot

656
00:49:24,760 --> 00:49:30,240
hundred and one three hundred and thirty seven sats thank you for so very many

657
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:33,720
things over the years most recently I have been inspired by the Nixos

658
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:39,200
challenge the world of podcasting 2.0 lightning and Bitcoin thanks for dog

659
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:43,120
footing matrix and Hugo thank you for your faucet and self-hosting advocacy

660
00:49:43,120 --> 00:49:49,800
and especially for fostering a real sense of community stop it stop it geez

661
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:54,480
that's too much thank you for the thank you for the support you know like we had

662
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:57,400
some great support come in this week for this episode we really really do

663
00:49:57,400 --> 00:50:06,720
appreciate and Brent still on that split too true so you know we did we have

664
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:11,920
talked about that on on love a little bit but that was fun with the the SAT

665
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:18,880
stakes and the grocers the SATs the gas I mean honestly the better thing might

666
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:21,760
be just as you know like if you could just convert the stats to cash but we

667
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:24,600
didn't want to do that that was the easy way out so that's not fun enough bit

668
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:30,200
refill lets you buy Texaco and Chevron gas cards which works as long as you're

669
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:34,720
in the States but once you enter Scandinavia you guys you don't have those

670
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:40,780
right no yeah no I wonder if there's like a shell like shell is is pretty

671
00:50:40,780 --> 00:50:44,400
common and you have them here so I wonder if they sell shell cards on bit

672
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:47,080
refill oh we didn't look hard enough did we'll have to check we have to check

673
00:50:47,080 --> 00:50:54,280
then we got ten thousand sats from orange Fox who I think might actually be

674
00:50:54,280 --> 00:51:02,040
Alex Gates using breeze said the worst thing about the office TV fans is when

675
00:51:02,040 --> 00:51:07,200
they try to make Battlestar Galactica references without ever seen BSG I agree

676
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:10,320
and this is this is the problem with the show name is everybody thinks it's an

677
00:51:10,320 --> 00:51:12,920
office podcast and then they're disappointed when they start listening

678
00:51:12,920 --> 00:51:16,920
and it's not an it's not an office podcast yeah it's not it's not about the

679
00:51:16,920 --> 00:51:24,080
TV show there are plenty oh my god there are plenty of those I never had any idea

680
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:28,560
so okay we do definitely need a new name there's just no doubt about it we have

681
00:51:28,560 --> 00:51:32,920
another boost that came in from true grits with 1701 the enterprise sats

682
00:51:32,920 --> 00:51:37,960
so instead of making a side business off the new JB hosting platform maybe y'all

683
00:51:37,960 --> 00:51:43,640
should turn it into a Libre podcasting package interesting hmm and then gene

684
00:51:43,640 --> 00:51:47,760
bean was thinking along the same lines as another set of leet sats packaging

685
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:52,120
the website bits up in a way other podcasters could consume while also being

686
00:51:52,120 --> 00:51:58,200
able to get updates would be awesome you know there's something to this I think

687
00:51:58,200 --> 00:52:04,800
there's something to creating a platform that other podcasters could package up

688
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:08,760
and use and I don't know how far we take this but I'm down to experiment with

689
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:11,840
taking it further especially if community members have ideas on how we

690
00:52:11,840 --> 00:52:15,360
could make it I guess more portable would be the word to use I know we need

691
00:52:15,360 --> 00:52:18,720
to have a good licensing conversation we need to sort all that stuff out but I

692
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:21,680
think it's a direction we could take things especially once we think we have

693
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:25,920
it in a pretty feature complete state and then maybe later on as we develop a

694
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:30,040
way to generate RSS feeds that's something we could share too and

695
00:52:30,040 --> 00:52:34,280
ultimately and I think we have to remember the RSS feed is our radio

696
00:52:34,280 --> 00:52:38,800
signal that's our broadcast tower the website is an endpoint and so I think if

697
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:44,520
we created the system that where the two work together somehow you know you put

698
00:52:44,520 --> 00:52:47,520
some of this information in the RSS feed and it automatically populates the

699
00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:52,960
website and the website is is also one of the end consumers of that RSS feed so

700
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:55,120
the source of truth is there are assessed I think that'd be incredibly

701
00:52:55,120 --> 00:52:58,520
powerful really interesting and very useful for other podcasters because all

702
00:52:58,520 --> 00:53:02,720
then they would have to do is point that website consumption whatever it is

703
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:06,520
endpoint at their RSS feed and it would just pull it in and begin to build their

704
00:53:06,520 --> 00:53:12,240
you know Hugo based website for them that'd be my idea you know that gets me

705
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:16,800
thinking I was originally gonna say oh well we haven't really heard of others

706
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:20,800
out there outside of the JB community really latching on to the project that

707
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:24,280
we're building here but then that got me thinking well maybe we haven't described

708
00:53:24,280 --> 00:53:27,440
what it actually does well enough you know if you're right it's been

709
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:32,040
described as a website for us well that's it what if you change what

710
00:53:32,040 --> 00:53:37,280
content it's looking at and you change out the logos I mean I wouldn't be a fan

711
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:40,920
my main thing one of the main things was nice about getting away from fireside is

712
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:45,800
every fireside page looks alike so that would be one downside as if all of the

713
00:53:45,800 --> 00:53:50,600
websites just looked alike again but the upside would be a big improvement for

714
00:53:50,600 --> 00:53:55,760
the listeners and also something that's podcasting to I know compatible and

715
00:53:55,760 --> 00:54:00,680
forward-facing I had a call this morning before the show with an individual named

716
00:54:00,680 --> 00:54:07,280
Matt who is working on a fireside competitor and fireside side note for

717
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:10,600
those of you don't know we're talking about yeah fireside FM it's pretty great

718
00:54:10,600 --> 00:54:16,280
podcasting hosting platform but a little bit slow on the features and what these

719
00:54:16,280 --> 00:54:21,080
guys want to do is come along with the same idea a CMS a front-end website a

720
00:54:21,080 --> 00:54:27,640
back-end CDN infrastructure but all in on podcasting 2.0 so that's what their

721
00:54:27,640 --> 00:54:31,280
competitive advantage is gonna be is they're they're all the podcasting to

722
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:33,800
those stuff out of the box they're hoping it's funny this is probably what

723
00:54:33,800 --> 00:54:37,240
you wanted like six months ago a year maybe right yeah it would have been nice

724
00:54:37,240 --> 00:54:41,480
but yeah but I don't know if I'd want to go back what we have now is so much more

725
00:54:41,480 --> 00:54:45,280
powerful so much better for us well and better than actually we had envisioned at

726
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:48,440
first yeah yeah and there are some features that I think we're gonna come

727
00:54:48,440 --> 00:54:52,400
up with in the next month or two yeah that we've been wanting for a long time

728
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:56,600
and that are actually pretty awesome and it's made things like transitioning to

729
00:54:56,600 --> 00:55:00,280
peer-to-peer smoother it's gonna make transitioning to having our own RSS feeds

730
00:55:00,280 --> 00:55:04,040
smoother I mean it's it's gonna pay off down the road for stuff we're not even

731
00:55:04,040 --> 00:55:08,320
doing yet yeah I completely completes agrees and then true grits came back in

732
00:55:08,320 --> 00:55:14,920
with a dubs boost again let's give him a little bit of a tutting 1701 sats oh so

733
00:55:14,920 --> 00:55:19,160
he also gets the Trek boost you're doing a good job he says I wish there was a

734
00:55:19,160 --> 00:55:23,160
more granular way in fountain FM to determine which podcast I earned sats on

735
00:55:23,160 --> 00:55:28,560
and which ones I spend sets on I would throw all of my earnings on podcasts

736
00:55:28,560 --> 00:55:32,160
that don't support lightning and boosts but then turn off earnings for the

737
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:35,760
podcast that do I don't feel like I really earn the sats when they're just

738
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:39,200
getting streamed right back out also do you guys know if the streaming counts

739
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:45,520
towards your flow I haven't been able to determine that so this is a great set of

740
00:55:45,520 --> 00:55:50,040
questions grits and fountain FM has this feature now where when you're listening

741
00:55:50,040 --> 00:55:55,320
to podcasts they stream sats to you and they just recently tweaked the way you

742
00:55:55,320 --> 00:55:58,520
earn those sats and they've made it a lot simpler and clearer and I'll have a

743
00:55:58,520 --> 00:56:04,320
link to their explanation in the show notes but just really briefly you now

744
00:56:04,320 --> 00:56:09,800
get paid in fountain for your first hour of daily podcast listening the earning

745
00:56:09,800 --> 00:56:14,040
rate changes every day for each user and it's random some days you might earn a

746
00:56:14,040 --> 00:56:19,000
little but on some days you'll earn a lot you no longer need to support

747
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:23,640
podcasts or create clips in order to continue earning or to earn more so the

748
00:56:23,640 --> 00:56:27,720
flow idea is kind of out there are no changes the way promotions or regular

749
00:56:27,720 --> 00:56:34,000
clips work that change was done in fountain 4.9 and as we record on

750
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:41,440
Wednesday October 11th 2022 5.2 just came out they've added a lot of stuff

751
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:44,740
autocue support which was one of the number one features I heard from the

752
00:56:44,740 --> 00:56:49,440
audience carplay and Android auto has also been added as well as some bug

753
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:53,240
fixes performance improvements some UI cleanup the way the clips work is a

754
00:56:53,240 --> 00:56:57,520
little bit better now I gotta say I'm really like in fountain I I want I want

755
00:56:57,520 --> 00:57:02,200
pod verse to be my daily driver because it is the GPL one but man the stuff they

756
00:57:02,200 --> 00:57:06,220
keep doing in fountain just keeps bringing me back I love the clips

757
00:57:06,220 --> 00:57:11,000
because I spent time following different people and so now in fountain one of the

758
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:14,520
things that I just love is if I've got a few minutes I'm burning like maybe I'm

759
00:57:14,520 --> 00:57:18,960
doing a quick chore or something I just go to the clips page and I just hit play

760
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:22,960
and I just listen through my clips and I find new podcasts I look at that

761
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:31,280
somebody clipped coder right there this is the joy that you bring Chris I just

762
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:34,180
so I mean the folks at fountain are doing such great work the folks at pod

763
00:57:34,180 --> 00:57:38,360
verse are doing such great work too we're just spoiled in podcasting 2.0 so

764
00:57:38,360 --> 00:57:42,160
grits go give that post a read just so you can kind of wrap your head around it

765
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:48,160
if anything they're making it easier now so hopefully you might see on some days

766
00:57:48,160 --> 00:57:51,340
a slower earn rate but it's just gonna be a simpler way you just essentially

767
00:57:51,340 --> 00:57:56,440
listen and I mean the way I basically worked it out one time it's like a SATA

768
00:57:56,440 --> 00:58:00,680
minute or something I was getting so it's slower than it used to be but not

769
00:58:00,680 --> 00:58:06,520
so bad but do you think that's tricky for those who've been trying to really

770
00:58:06,520 --> 00:58:10,200
dive into the system and earn things because it almost feels like it's the

771
00:58:10,200 --> 00:58:13,380
second change almost this month that they've made to this earning system so

772
00:58:13,380 --> 00:58:17,360
do you think they're just trying things to figure it out or yeah they're the

773
00:58:17,360 --> 00:58:23,280
first ever do something like this and I think it does take a lot of work to make

774
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:28,520
sure it doesn't get gamed and scammed and so I think they've been sorting out

775
00:58:28,520 --> 00:58:32,200
and make it clear enough to so people set the right expectations and don't get

776
00:58:32,200 --> 00:58:36,680
upset I think you got to tweak all of that the idea is kind of compelling so

777
00:58:36,680 --> 00:58:41,340
the sats come from people who buy promoted clips and in the UI when you

778
00:58:41,340 --> 00:58:47,760
open up fountain it brings you to a clips page first and generally there are

779
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:53,560
eight clips in the UI the first two are clearly labeled they're a different

780
00:58:53,560 --> 00:58:57,800
color and those are the promoted clips everything else isn't everything else is

781
00:58:57,800 --> 00:59:02,320
community generated those two promoted clips at the top are where the sats come

782
00:59:02,320 --> 00:59:05,080
from that's where the sats that you're getting streamed to you when you're

783
00:59:05,080 --> 00:59:08,920
listening that's where they come from and then what grits is asking is well if

784
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:13,280
I stream those back to the podcaster like what's the point the point is is

785
00:59:13,280 --> 00:59:16,680
you can control the flow rate back to the podcaster and you could preload

786
00:59:16,680 --> 00:59:19,720
your wallet and the streaming you're getting from found it could just kind of

787
00:59:19,720 --> 00:59:24,240
be a supplement you know you know you're getting a little kickback I think it's a

788
00:59:24,240 --> 00:59:27,920
neat system but it is definitely early days still and then true grits gets our

789
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:38,800
very last boost of the episode with 4040 sats since you guys told me not to clip

790
00:59:38,800 --> 00:59:43,440
and drive last episode which I agree I don't actually do however I do most of

791
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:47,960
my podcast listening on the road by the time I get to my destination I have

792
00:59:47,960 --> 00:59:52,460
forgotten what the clippable moment is or I don't have time to do it it would

793
00:59:52,460 --> 00:59:56,360
be nice if there was a way as the listener to drop a marker on a podcast

794
00:59:56,360 --> 01:00:01,120
and come back to it later like a user set chapter marker of sorts fabulous

795
01:00:01,120 --> 01:00:05,120
idea it is man because I have the same problem I want to make clips of

796
01:00:05,120 --> 01:00:07,800
different podcasts all the time I've got a lot of people following me on fountain

797
01:00:07,800 --> 01:00:12,360
now so I kind of wanted like you know give them something and I I never ever

798
01:00:12,360 --> 01:00:17,080
remember what it was I wanted to clip when I get home or get to my destination

799
01:00:17,080 --> 01:00:21,320
it's a huge problem but I also don't want to like tap out a big old note like

800
01:00:21,320 --> 01:00:25,600
audible has this feature where you can like kind of bookmark and leave a note

801
01:00:25,600 --> 01:00:30,480
but you're tapping out like a whole note to yourself well that's not safe you

802
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:34,360
have a little button that just drops like a flag or something like that is a

803
01:00:34,360 --> 01:00:38,560
great idea I think fountain should think about that like a little marker right

804
01:00:38,560 --> 01:00:43,160
there we also got what do you think how do you think this last one on the thank

805
01:00:43,160 --> 01:00:46,240
yous here goes there but how would you pronounce that last one there is a JLT

806
01:00:46,240 --> 01:00:50,720
my old man vision is JLT Gordon yeah is that what it is I'm zooming but then I

807
01:00:50,720 --> 01:00:53,680
lost my place in the dock because I had to zoom in so I could read it yeah we

808
01:00:53,680 --> 01:00:58,360
got 4,300 sats from JLT thank you JLT and we got 500 sats from rustic

809
01:00:58,360 --> 01:01:02,600
aversa just to send a meow to editor drew and I feel like there's a

810
01:01:02,600 --> 01:01:09,240
relationship starting you know a friendship built out of meows I guess

811
01:01:09,240 --> 01:01:13,440
we didn't have a lot of different boosters but the boosters who supported

812
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:17,280
us this week really really stepped up I don't know if we're gonna see that next

813
01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:19,880
episode so if you've been thinking about sending a boost in getting a comment in

814
01:01:19,880 --> 01:01:23,640
it'd be a great week because it just takes someone like you to support us

815
01:01:23,640 --> 01:01:27,480
anybody out there listening could go to new podcast apps calm grab a new podcast

816
01:01:27,480 --> 01:01:30,880
app one that's podcasting to know compatible become part of this new

817
01:01:30,880 --> 01:01:34,960
movement the edge of podcasting technology the real leading edge exciting

818
01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:38,400
community driven stuff not the stuff that's driven by Spotify I don't know if

819
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:42,000
you saw this Brent but Spotify just announced that they just bought a content

820
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:47,320
scanning company that specializes in scanning podcasts spoken word content

821
01:01:47,320 --> 01:01:52,040
and finding offensive violations and automatically flagging them Spotify just

822
01:01:52,040 --> 01:01:54,040
bought that company they're gonna probably integrate that into the

823
01:01:54,040 --> 01:01:57,600
platform it's just gonna be great mm-hmm yeah it's what we've always wanted yeah

824
01:01:57,600 --> 01:02:02,680
I just are so so looking forward to that now you know we're gonna we always get

825
01:02:02,680 --> 01:02:05,560
letters from YouTube after we do a live stream now I'm also gonna I'm gonna be

826
01:02:05,560 --> 01:02:10,920
getting letters emails from Spotify now it's gonna be part of the whole routine

827
01:02:10,920 --> 01:02:14,480
you know it's just a ridiculous direction podcasting needs to stay

828
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:18,160
healthy it needs to stay decentralized so you can do that big cut by becoming a
