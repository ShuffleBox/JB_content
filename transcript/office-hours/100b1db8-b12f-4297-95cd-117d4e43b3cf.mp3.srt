1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,240
How you feeling about recording this week you think you're gonna be able to get that thing to record well

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:05,760
I have my own account now, so I feel like I have

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,240
Jumped a few hurdles. Oh

4
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:11,480
Really mm-hmm Alex may be an account on his laptop here

5
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:17,120
So now I don't need his fingerprint. You know I've had that finger laying around, but it's kind of getting a little yeah

6
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:20,920
I've had her on ice, but the ice is last forever. You know you had to make a call on that finger

7
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:23,640
I get it. Yeah, I think you could have brought it with you. I

8
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:27,200
Think you probably could you know he's got so many laptops over there

9
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:30,040
You probably could have taken that laptop in that finger, and he wouldn't even noticed

10
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:35,080
I'm not sure which one he's got more of fingers or laptops. I think there are one two three

11
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:36,920
four

12
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:42,560
Laptops on well that's sort of a mini desktop, but just on this one table surface right now

13
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:48,760
Yeah, well it makes for good video for the live stream, so that's good. There's also that one over there with some rather

14
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,920
Graphics stuff on it that is

15
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:59,520
An homage PC is it really oh, it's this is a big deal. That's an homage to a great television show called

16
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:01,720
Silicon Valley and

17
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:04,120
one of the characters in that show

18
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:11,580
He has a signature line of servers for the data center, and he wants his signature on the servers

19
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:15,540
But he's such an egomaniac that that just happens to be what his signature looks like

20
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:19,120
It ends up looking like a penis and so

21
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:25,540
And it's a great storyline because like the the product team like tries to like show him all these other options that are

22
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:31,920
Clearly better options, but his own ego won't let him choose anything else and so they end up shipping a penis logo on

23
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:38,440
All of them you know I've wanted to ask Alex from like about day three that I've been here several weeks ago

24
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:42,400
But I was a little too shy to ask him about the penis

25
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:46,080
Can I ask what you just assumed the reason there was a penis on his PC?

26
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:53,040
I assumed there was some backstory that I wasn't privy to but I just couldn't bring myself to asking the question for him to explain

27
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:57,080
The joke so thank you for informing me. Can I ask you to the thought cross your mind, huh?

28
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,960
Alex likes penises more than I thought he did

29
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:06,400
Did that did that cross your mind? That's also a worm penis because it's on a power source. Yeah, yeah

30
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,600
I

31
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:12,160
Think the first time I saw it. I was like no. I didn't just see that

32
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:17,960
That's not meant to be like that and then I saw it again. I was like oh, there's something going on here. Oh really yeah

33
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:25,600
Yeah, so the first pass you thought oh, no, that's just me seeing something. Yeah, yeah, so you thought you were the weirdo

34
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:32,400
I see I see I'm in a foreign place sure yeah, and you want to be charitable to your buddy right try so

35
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,760
It's like I'm not ashamed of you Alex. I'm ashamed of me for thinking it's a penis

36
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:41,120
Yeah, yeah, it's my fault not your fault. That's me. It's not

37
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:47,720
Well I I tried to have a meal before the show so I don't run out of energy and

38
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:52,360
How'd you do? I don't know I think I did all right. You know I had some salmon

39
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:58,020
I feels like a good choice was it like smoked or was it poached or how was it poached?

40
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:02,240
I'd answer. I don't actually know cuz it was prepared for me. I'll be honest

41
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:10,040
The life made it last night, and I brought it I brought it to work with me it could have been broiled who knows yeah

42
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:12,280
I just don't know I brought it to work with me

43
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:15,880
I just thought you know it'd be nice to have something to eat before we start cuz you know how I get

44
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,640
You know how I get I know how you get too

45
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:21,660
Oh, I get the both of us useless

46
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:27,360
I think is I just yeah wander around aimlessly without the right amount of food. I was watching this

47
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:35,520
doctor talk about ADHD and he was saying how he recommends that people with ADHD when they're working on something keep like a

48
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,080
glass of juice with them

49
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:42,760
To help their burnt their brain burn better. I guess I don't know I didn't have a glass of juice when I was watching

50
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:44,760
It so I couldn't really follow what he was saying

51
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:56,640
It's office hours with Chris

52
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:07,120
Hey everyone welcome on into the office. Thanks for being here. Hey Brent get comfortable come on in hello

53
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:12,120
Thank you. You kept my chair nice and warm. I did I kept a little heater on there for you

54
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:16,640
That's kind of you. You know I also made a little room over there for the mumble room. Hey virtual lug. How's it going?

55
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:24,020
Hello, hi guys yeah, they're welcome on into the office gosh darn it gosh darn it welcome on in Brent

56
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:27,840
You're still in North Carolina. I am it seems. I just won't leave now

57
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:35,400
I'm wondering at this point in time. You're just days away from going tomorrow in fact tomorrow. Okay. I know you I know how things go

58
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,080
I'm wondering

59
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:42,120
Do you have more projects at this point that are on the list than when you arrived?

60
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:45,060
And are there more projects undone than done?

61
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:53,240
Is this a problem so we did have a list uh-huh prior to my arriving which was quite ambitious and

62
00:04:53,920 --> 00:05:00,520
I think maybe Alex should have a look at it because I haven't looked at it in like two weeks

63
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:08,440
But the number of things we've added I think amounts to the size of the original list as well, so I think you're probably right

64
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:10,440
I think we have done some amazing things

65
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:19,040
Alex unfortunately always also is great at starting projects, and then he kind of quickly gets distracted by starting other projects

66
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:24,220
So we've both been kind of like that and trying to finish projects in the last few days now

67
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:28,040
Okay, so let me ask you this when you're working on a project normally

68
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:31,640
All right, would you say this is a problem you have in isolation on your own?

69
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:34,540
Or would you say this is more of like when you're working with idea guys?

70
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:39,040
Yeah, you know cuz I've run to this you and I have this too like we could come up with a million projects while you're

71
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:45,080
Here so is this something that you also do you have this project creep on your own? I didn't expect these

72
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:52,080
Introspective questions here, but I mean I'm enjoying it. I think I think probably when I'm with you and when I'm with Alex I

73
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:54,760
take the wonderfully

74
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:58,200
Natural place for myself, which is like a support role

75
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:04,280
I was a photographer's assistant for a very long time and so that kind of there's a switch there that just kind of kicks in

76
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,520
so

77
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,920
That doesn't answer your question. I'm just buying myself some time

78
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:18,800
So I think unfortunately yeah, I probably do lean that way when I'm doing my own stuff at home

79
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:24,720
So won't want I always just wonder what the solution is to that because I can that can happen to me, too

80
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,320
I think it's a human trait

81
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:28,040
I mean, it's exciting to start something new

82
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:32,560
Especially if you're learning some new techniques or trying out some new tool that you have or something like that

83
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:39,200
But you don't really reap the rewards unless you finish the project. So I don't know a reason why I'm thinking about this is

84
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:45,040
we're redoing a bunch of back-end stuff to do the JB website and

85
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,160
I

86
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:49,080
Just kind of recently thought

87
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:56,520
We probably got to break this up into chunks because it's quickly spinning off into like a new way for us to produce

88
00:06:56,840 --> 00:07:04,160
The back-end source of truth for the shows. It's quickly spinning off into like this, you know new CDN project and

89
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:08,200
you know, we have a deadline scale engine has been a

90
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,880
fantastic host for like a

91
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,640
decade at least and

92
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:17,360
They are just kind of not really in the WordPress hosting business anymore

93
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:23,360
And so they've given us a deadline of summer to get off of scale engine for WordPress

94
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,360
Oh, so they told us a while ago, so we've known it's coming

95
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,840
And so like we have to execute on that

96
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:34,120
But I don't want to blow it up right and so I've been recently thinking like how do I prevent this project?

97
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:42,120
Scope creep that I think we're all a little a little kind of inclined towards in our crew

98
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:47,720
It's so true. That's just been the back of my mind. I feel like we have to do it in a modular way

99
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:52,840
I'm not sure how to do that because it's all connected. But also we have to keep each other accountable somehow

100
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:58,560
Yeah, maybe it is like it's not like Trello right Trello like it might be useful for organizing

101
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,840
But that's not what's like gonna make us get the work done

102
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:05,120
Because as you said there you had a list, but you haven't even looked at it in two weeks. It's true

103
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:09,240
And every day I'm like, okay, I'm gonna do this today and Alex is like, hey, I was thinking we could do this

104
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:15,080
Oh, all right. Let's do that. So anyways, it's been a wild ride, which I think maybe that's just it

105
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:20,100
We're just attracted to adventure. Well, I'm glad you could join me one more time from from North Carolina

106
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:22,960
I imagine and I understand how it is. You're gonna get back home

107
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:28,920
You know, you got you'll get you'll get sucked into real life back home again, and we won't see you again for a while

108
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:33,320
So this has been fun, you know, it's been fun having you in the States and on a high-speed

109
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:36,280
internet connection while we do the show and

110
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:40,760
All of that speaking the same language, you know those kinds of things

111
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:44,680
You know, it's true, all right

112
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,600
All right. Well, I had a little bit of podcasting news

113
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:52,240
I just wanted to update everybody on how things are going in the industry because this one made me kind of smile

114
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:54,680
after coming out talking like they were going to

115
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,960
change the podcasting landscape

116
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:01,040
One of the big tech players has decided

117
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:04,000
Not for us. We're dropping out of podcasting

118
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,640
It's not what I've complained about because I've honestly never felt like they are much of a threat

119
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:16,200
But Facebook has announced they are removing all podcasting features from the platform on June 3rd

120
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:20,560
And they're gonna stop allowing people to add their podcast to the platform

121
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:27,600
Starting this week as we record the episode. I have to admit I didn't even really realize they had those features

122
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:32,800
Oops, isn't this kind of actually a sign that this was a good move that right there? Yeah

123
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,800
that's a good time to abandon something when

124
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:40,640
It's not quite working. I wonder if we aren't gonna go through a bit of a podcast bubble correction

125
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:44,880
In fact, if I were to speculate I would argue we are already in the midst of it

126
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:49,800
I think we have been all of this year a bit of a podcasting bubble correction and

127
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:54,360
the IAB just came out with these ridiculous figures for

128
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,640
Podcast revenue sponsorships, which are just totally unsustainable

129
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:02,560
So I think we're kind of at the end of a bubble a little bit in sort of the

130
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:08,080
Industrial side of podcasting where every business needed a strategy. I don't know if we'll see much more

131
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:12,680
Retractions Facebook just didn't have a lot of establishment here

132
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:18,880
YouTube is continuing to pay podcasters to move their podcasts over to the YouTube platform

133
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:22,140
I don't know what they're using to like who they pick

134
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:26,800
It's all kind of just hush-hush behind the scenes and they have to sign NDAs and stuff

135
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:29,140
So there's like no real no real dirt out there

136
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:31,440
Telling us what's going on

137
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,440
but it is I

138
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,560
Guess kind of a bit of a win

139
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:37,560
It feels like to have Facebook kind of bow out

140
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:41,920
Doesn't that just sort of feel like one less thing to worry about one giant down, right?

141
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:48,040
One less pain in my neck, but it was so funny because they can't it was when like right at the at the peak

142
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:52,840
Hype of Clubhouse. I don't know if you remember this but for a hot minute everybody was talking about Clubhouse. Yes, I do

143
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:58,880
That's when Facebook announced this whole idea like oh, well, we're gonna become the kings audio audio is a medium

144
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:01,600
That's grown like crazy and that's when they made all these big plans

145
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,200
You know

146
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:07,480
You mentioned the bubble kind of maybe starting to come to an end or at least change a little bit and I was I was gonna

147
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:11,000
Say something that was opposite to you this morning

148
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:15,720
I ran into I got some gas that I put into Alex's truck and at the gas pump

149
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:19,200
There was a podcast advertisement on the gas pump and I thought

150
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:24,720
These are everywhere now. This is just getting ridiculous. Oh, yeah. Okay, I should be clear

151
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:29,880
I don't mean that podcasts are gonna stop growing and then more and more people aren't gonna do podcasts. I mean, I think

152
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:33,320
We sort of reached peak

153
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:39,840
Industrial interest in podcasts like big platform players that want to create the next platform

154
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:42,800
I think we've got our entrenched players now and

155
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,320
They're gonna try to make money. We'll see a few more consolidations

156
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:49,920
I I don't think podcasts themselves though. We're gonna stop

157
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:55,520
this is sort of the magic thing about podcasting and why we're so damn lucky to be doing this form of media is

158
00:11:56,520 --> 00:12:00,080
it just always organically grows because I

159
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:04,640
think as people we are drawn to just the

160
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:11,080
Orital medium where we where we tell stories and we help each other process what's going on right now

161
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:16,420
Through story like it's it's cliche kind of but like it's a virtual campfire thing

162
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:19,480
where people put the headphones on or they're listening in the car and

163
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:24,560
It's a more traditional experience. It's being delivered in a new way

164
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:32,200
but it's it's something that I think is almost built into us and how we share information and how we

165
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:36,680
figure things out and so I think because it's so accessible and

166
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:41,120
Because it it seems to touch on something that I think goes deep

167
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:48,040
I think it's gonna grow forever and I hope I hope I hope I hope now that we're like 15 years into this thing

168
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:52,240
that certain aspects like RSS feeds and

169
00:12:53,640 --> 00:13:00,840
Just the kind of built-in decentralized nature of the podcast industry. I hope protect it

170
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:07,840
More than most industries would be protected from consolidation. My only caveat there is

171
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:14,480
That's exactly what they said about radio back when farmers were using it to broadcast on their fence lines and talk to each other

172
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,480
and give each other crop updates like

173
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:20,840
Everyone had a radio station. All of the radios frequencies were like stepping on each other

174
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:25,920
Anybody could do it. It was just a matter of how much how much power could you put out?

175
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:31,280
And then that you know, obviously that consolidated it got regulated and and it became you know

176
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:36,200
Something that no one really has access to I don't know if we'll go that far because we're 15 years into it

177
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,200
But like I said, it has happened before

178
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:44,800
We'll see but it still feels good. Even if it's a small win. We'll take him still feels good. I'll take it

179
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,800
Yeah, I have been

180
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:48,920
actually sticking

181
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:54,800
With fountain FM as my podcast app and I I definitely know this has been a struggle for some of our listeners

182
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:58,640
I've heard from people who tried it so that way they could do the boost things for a bit

183
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:02,400
But then they didn't really like cast a manic or fountain FM or one of the other new podcast apps

184
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:08,360
And I also had a little bit of trouble at first. I think for me a couple of the more recent updates

185
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,880
It made a nice improvement

186
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:14,600
There's a couple of things in here now that I really find useful

187
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:18,880
The clipping community has kind of become my favorite way to find new podcasts

188
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:21,080
Have you seen this you've tried this?

189
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:24,360
Well, you've sent a lot of clips and I've sent clips to you

190
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:29,040
But also I love in fountain how you open it up and there's you know

191
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:36,960
The the home page is kind of by default just clips. There have been a few shows that I listened to that I haven't

192
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:42,440
Maybe hit play on in the last few weeks and then someone throws a clip there and it's like oh, yeah

193
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:45,120
And you just it's like a you know, the clips can be a various length

194
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:48,320
So it could be 10 seconds could be 30 seconds could be a few minutes

195
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:51,200
And I found that to be a really great way to jump into a podcast

196
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:55,720
I haven't you know heard in a little bit but also like you say to discover new ones, so

197
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,600
it feels like a

198
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:01,120
cheating almost so at first I

199
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:05,120
Did not like the clips because I just wanted to get into my podcast

200
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:09,600
I had a you know, I'm getting on the road. I got a drive. I want to listen to my shows

201
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,360
but

202
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:18,800
What changed the game for me is when I started realizing I was listening to podcast clips instead of going to YouTube on my phone

203
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:21,520
Right. Do you understand like how much healthier that is?

204
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:28,400
Oh, yeah, right. It's so much healthier. Plus I'm discovering new podcasts that have been

205
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:33,280
Such good listens. So it really changed the way I think about the clip

206
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:37,840
So now I went like if I got a couple of minutes to kill and I just want to kind of like take a dip

207
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:38,600
Into some content

208
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:44,720
I'm firing up fountain and I'm listening to the clips and it has become a network effect because people because as I've shared clips

209
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:47,760
People have followed me and then I'm following them back

210
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:51,640
And so now I've got like a little network in there of people that are sharing clips

211
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:57,280
You wouldn't have to do it use it for that. But man, have I found that stupid handy, you know at first

212
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:58,860
I didn't want to start over clean

213
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:03,840
but then having a blank slate and kind of subscribing to like a core few shows that I listened to and

214
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:12,280
Then adding some new shows based on the clips has kind of like really brightened up my podcast subscriptions again

215
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:14,920
I'm really enjoying that and plus I have my old app

216
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:19,040
I can always flip over there and see if I'm missing something so it's not that bad

217
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:24,760
I found the clip creation process was really neat as well. And I think you have enjoyed it, too

218
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:28,200
It does like transcripts and you can really get down to it. It's really nice

219
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:33,520
Yeah, and so you edit it like you would edit text instead of editing in the audio waveform

220
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:37,400
So you just if you don't want a sentence in there or you want to start at the right point

221
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:42,120
You just select the text and cut it or whatever and then it creates the audio file

222
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:47,560
But then it also creates a web link so people don't have to have the fountain app and it'll create an audio file

223
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:53,760
And it'll export a video that uses the album art and does captions of the transcription is so well done

224
00:16:53,760 --> 00:17:01,160
It's great for sharing like on telegram or matrix or Twitter or whatever. I found it. It has cut way back on my youtube time and

225
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:08,720
I really like that about it and they've made some solid improvements. The performance has gotten better. The battery life has gotten better

226
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:12,440
They don't have carplay yet, but they are working on Android auto and carplay

227
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:18,600
And I do effing love the boost man. I love sending the boosts because as a podcaster

228
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:22,400
You know, I pay more attention to like a username when I see it on a boost because it sticks out, right?

229
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,720
It's on my screen. I memorize it

230
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:30,280
And so I hear other people with the same username sometimes boosting the shows and then I'm boosting though. It's it's fun

231
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:35,720
It is a lot of fun. I still remember sir. Lurks a lot was one of the previous ones. I think last week

232
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:40,520
Yeah, I gotta remember these is great lurks lots in the mumble right now and I recognized when he John he joined

233
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:47,560
Oh, I'm like, oh, yeah looks like boosted. That's great. It's great. Yeah, it is pretty good. The other thing is I feel like

234
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:51,560
Calling them boosts has been pretty astute

235
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:57,280
You've been mentioning how it's been really boosting your mood recently and some other podcasters mentioned the same thing, right?

236
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:02,080
Yeah, that is it is a boost. I like it's better than the name of super chat or something like that

237
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:06,280
Tony wrote in he said so you've convinced me on the future of podcasting 2.0

238
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:12,120
Value for value and even boosts, but the problem is it assumes that you already have some skin in the crypto game

239
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:17,960
I've never owned any crypto and I'm looking for a way in it seems that there's plenty of ways to go wrong and likely get

240
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:19,360
scammed

241
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:25,680
Good instincts Tony. He says can you recommend a safe starting point for a noob? I'm UK by the way, which is good to know

242
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:31,120
This is the biggest in my opinion hurdle to the whole boost platform

243
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:32,480
the

244
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,480
monetary mechanism is

245
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:37,600
Satoshi's which are a unit of Bitcoin

246
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:44,520
There's a hundred million Satoshi's in a Bitcoin and so you can send like 500 sats and it's like less than a dollar

247
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:48,200
To get those you have to buy some sats and you could buy

248
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:51,780
Tiny amounts of sats at a time you could buy a couple dollars worth of sats at a time

249
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:57,120
But getting it is tricky in the US. I've been recommending strike

250
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:00,320
Strike is just a really solid quick app

251
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:02,040
it is

252
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:07,880
Regulated it you will have to go through some of the identification processes all of these that are legal and regulated

253
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:14,240
Have to identify you because it's the rules and regulations of the banking system to prevent many money laundering and you know

254
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:17,800
Terrorism and stuff like that and all the other things you could probably assume

255
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:22,600
So you have to go through some form of identification if you use one of these apps, that's the downside

256
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,280
They are used by millions of people though

257
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:31,040
They are using traditional industry rails to do that kind of regulatory approval and identification

258
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:38,360
But it is a pain in the butt in the UK. I've been recommending blue wallet, which makes this also really straightforward

259
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:45,400
What you want is something that participates on the lightning network lightning is kind of like SMTP in the sense that it is an open

260
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:50,640
protocol it's an open network and you just have to have you know a system on that network and

261
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:55,200
The benefit to it is that it's peer-to-peer and it's extremely

262
00:19:56,120 --> 00:20:03,720
Stupid cheap to send a monetary amount over that network way cheaper than is possible with something like stripe

263
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,400
Or PayPal or visa or MasterCard way way cheaper, right?

264
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:15,160
Where you could send fractions of a penny over the lightning network and it's economically feasible to send less than a penny

265
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:18,560
You can't even send a couple of dollars over the traditional banking network

266
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:21,000
Without the fee being more than the amount you're sending

267
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:24,460
So that's why our lightning and boost kind of play a role there

268
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:27,320
But I I think it's also and I know you already know this Tony

269
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:32,380
But I think it's also important to point out that there's a network effect of more and more podcasts being on there

270
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:37,800
Voltage just did a case study of the lightning network and podcasting 2.0

271
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:41,040
If you can actually believe it or not, and I'll have a link to this in the show notes

272
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:47,760
There's over a million sats streamed per day. That's not even the boost. That's just people streaming as they listen. Yeah

273
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:53,040
There is but this is actually even an old number. They say 6.4, but now there's over 7,000 podcasts

274
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:59,840
Using value for value and lightning when we started talking about this. There was 4,000. That's how fast this is growing

275
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:03,560
This is a big deal, right? It's not huge in the Linux community

276
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:11,600
That's where it's not very big but outside of this it is picking up. It's picking up with music artists as well and authors

277
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:16,400
So voltage did a case study on it and it's absolutely great

278
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:21,960
It's really bang up. So a link to that. It's starting to grow but podcasting 2.0 itself is

279
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:25,120
Really more than just the boosts

280
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:32,600
Podcast and I talked about this in Koda radio recently podcasting 2.0 itself is a set of new standards. It's a spec

281
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:40,240
It's a whole bunch of new features for podcasting that are really really powerful and you can go look it up the podcasting 2.0 namespace

282
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:42,160
There's so many great things in there

283
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:47,280
They solve problems that JB's tried to come up with solutions for for years, but they do it in a standardized open-source way

284
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:55,200
That an entire community is contributing to and it adds features that not only would make podcasting more accessible to people with accessibility needs

285
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:59,400
They not only make podcasting easier to find through Google search and stuff like that

286
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:05,200
But it just adds features that would make the content better as well or make it more accessible

287
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:09,440
Like we have a question in here about will we ever release office hours as an opus file?

288
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:17,160
And JB used to release things as an AUG Vorbis an AUG Theora a WebM an MP4

289
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:20,880
Couple two mp4 types and an mp3

290
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:28,480
So we had five to six different file versions for every episode and we had to create five or six different RSS feeds

291
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:35,680
And as a result, if you go searching on places on the web, you can find all these old HD feeds low quality fees

292
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:40,880
You've probably seen this if you've ever gone around for a little while. Oh, yeah, and it sucks, right? Well, guess what?

293
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:47,120
One of the things in podcasting 2.0 namespace is a file type enclosure namespace

294
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:51,440
so you can have multiple file types in one feed entry and the

295
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,080
the software on your phone

296
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:57,600
Could expose that option so you could choose as a listener

297
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:03,200
You could choose the opus version of a show or the mp3 version or it would probably default to the mp3 unless you chose

298
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:06,880
Something different and that could be exposed all via one feed entry

299
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:09,840
just small little things because

300
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:16,000
The the reality is is that the podcasting RSS spec hasn't been updated since 2009

301
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:19,680
It's been a little bit and things have changed

302
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:24,320
That was well before mobile podcast players had the presence they have now

303
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:28,720
And it's just it's a whole set of features that I'm as you can tell

304
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:32,880
super bullish on I just really just I really want to advocate for it because

305
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:41,920
I think it behooves the podcasters out there to get into this. I think it's it's to the benefit of the medium long term

306
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:45,840
And sometimes when you work in a medium or when you work in an industry

307
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:49,040
You have to do things to keep it healthy to keep it going

308
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:52,800
You can't just sit on your you know existing success and not ever push it forward

309
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:56,000
That's what I'm a big believer in so that's why I talk about it so much

310
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:00,160
And I have a link in the show notes to a really good medium post that completely introduces

311
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:05,360
The entire thing from top to bottom talks about how the podcast index fits into this

312
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:11,840
How the namespace fits into this it talks about what pod ping is which is one of the really cool features about this

313
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:13,840
So one of the neat things is

314
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:15,520
as a publisher

315
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,520
When you publish an episode

316
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,600
You can announce it to the pod ping service and that pod ping service

317
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:27,760
acts as a store of information that the podcast index in but also all of the podcasting 2.0 apps

318
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:30,880
participate in so everybody gets a

319
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:33,280
sensible

320
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:39,760
Controllable json announcement a basically little json file update that says here's some new feed information new shows out

321
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:41,680
so instead of

322
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:44,960
every podcast player and every service having to like

323
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,040
pound an

324
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:51,600
Http rss file, you know, just an xml file sitting on on an htp share

325
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:55,520
Instead of having to hit that all the time and and pull it down and see if there's any updates

326
00:24:56,320 --> 00:25:01,360
The pod ping network tells things when stuff when things are updated and it's completely decentralized

327
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:06,740
It doesn't require the podcast index. Although the podcast index is a front end to it. It doesn't require your specific

328
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:12,000
Apps implementation. It's a completely open spec and that's part of podcasting 2.0 as well

329
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,160
Without that

330
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:17,040
You have to rely on services like spotify and apple

331
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,760
To do those kinds of updates for you

332
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:24,320
And it talks about all that and of course it gets into value value for value

333
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:26,800
Which is a system?

334
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:31,600
For podcasters to receive direct payments from listeners for an exchange of value

335
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:37,200
Either it could be monetary. It could be time. It could be talent. It's you got something out of the show

336
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:41,120
So you give something back which I think is really in line with the open source esos

337
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:45,680
And I think ethos and I think something open source developers could embrace too. So I feel like there is

338
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:53,040
a really solid opportunity to perhaps begin a culture shift in the free software and open source software community to start

339
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:56,980
Recognizing that the software that they use has real value like mumble. For example

340
00:25:57,680 --> 00:26:02,640
I would absolutely I would absolutely support the mumble developer if I could check a box to stream some sats

341
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:07,600
You know and when you really start thinking about this like when you really give this actual

342
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:10,720
Consideration and don't just dismiss what i'm saying when you really think about it

343
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:14,500
You could you could actually do away with a lot of these foundations

344
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:22,020
Because at the end of the day these foundations all of these free software projects end up ceding control and copyright to these foundations

345
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:24,640
Because running a business is a pain in the ass

346
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:28,240
Asking for money sucks. It's hard

347
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:31,680
And honestly, they just want to dev

348
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,400
They just want to dev bro. They don't want to be a dev

349
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:39,600
They just want to dev bro. They don't want to do the business and ask for money and stuff like that

350
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:46,880
And so they get sucked into these foundations and then these foundations end up centralizing the free software community

351
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:50,480
And if we solve the monetary problem if we made it possible

352
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:52,160
using

353
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:55,920
By the way, all free software an entire free software stack

354
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,560
Where I could check a box in mumble

355
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:02,800
And it would stream sats from a from a lightning waltz that I have on my umbral node or wherever I have it

356
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:06,720
And maybe it's a couple of sats a day. Maybe it's 50 sats a day. I mean these are pennies

357
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:10,480
but at scale for every you know, even if it was 10 every

358
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:14,400
Every third mumble user. I mean it would really make a difference

359
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:17,280
And they wouldn't be drawn to these

360
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:20,380
solutions that ultimately

361
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:24,400
Five ten years on sort of suck the life out of these projects

362
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:29,840
At least in my opinion, I mean when you really think about what we could be accomplishing together

363
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:34,080
We really have an opportunity to improve the life for developers for content creators

364
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:40,000
And to do it using all free software that's completely decentralized. It's really compelling

365
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:46,640
So I I do I do really like the value for value aspect of podcasting 2.0 and I think it's intensely important

366
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:48,960
But it's not the actual entire story

367
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:51,520
Didn't plan to go on that

368
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:53,520
rant thank you for it though

369
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,240
I guess I got the feels about it, you know

370
00:27:56,240 --> 00:28:01,040
She's louise. I mean when you get inspired I guess so. Does that make sense to you?

371
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:06,000
I mean actually I feel like it doesn't because I saw you in the telegram group just the other day asking like hey

372
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:12,240
What podcast app should I get so it's even even my friends, you know, like we don't think we don't think new podcast

373
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:19,040
Newpodcastapps.com like I just I haven't like I really haven't gotten the message out there even though and I and I and I know

374
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:20,320
I could do better

375
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:23,760
But because I get so passionate about it, I just kind of like go

376
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:29,120
And i'm clearly not i'm not connecting it, you know, i'm not i'm not getting at home with people

377
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:33,520
I don't think i'm not as successfully as I could maybe one of my questions for you would be

378
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:38,160
do you think a someone who's new to podcast could jump into one of these apps and

379
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:44,160
A year down the road be like, oh, yeah these new features and kind of grow with the app

380
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:47,840
Is that a do you think they're appropriate for that? I think some of the features

381
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:52,400
If you showed it to a new user, they would just be like, oh, yeah

382
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:56,080
If you showed it to a new user, they would just think the feature should have always been like that like chapters

383
00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:01,700
Or like the ability to show an image up on the screen at a moment during the show or transcripts

384
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:07,120
or the other thing you could do with that multi-format enclosure is you could have a low bit rate high bit rate and

385
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:12,420
An app developer could choose to implement the ability when streaming to dynamically switch depending on your connectivity

386
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:17,840
That's just something youtube does automatically a new user to a new podcast app would just expect that kind of thing

387
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:20,320
They wouldn't even know any different. In fact, I think it's harder

388
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:26,320
I think the real challenge is people who love antenna pod and overcast and pocketcast because those apps

389
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:28,720
Have let people develop

390
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:29,840
routines

391
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:36,080
And a process and a way of listening that new apps don't necessarily re-implement because they got their whole they got their own whole paradigm

392
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:37,680
And I think it's much harder

393
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:43,360
For those users to stick than it would be a new user who doesn't really have expectations of what an app does. Is that grog?

394
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:45,360
Oh, yeah

395
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:47,600
That's my thing on that. I guess that's my thing

396
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:53,680
I like it, you know, you know how I get when I get when I gets to talking about the podcasting. Yeah, you love the podcasting

397
00:29:53,920 --> 00:30:01,600
It's really exciting. Honestly, what's going on over there? I listen to the podcasting 2.0 podcast, you know that dave and adam do

398
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:07,120
There's so many developers and community members that are all working on pieces of it right now

399
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:08,720
There's so many things in the work

400
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:14,080
So it is early days and that's another thing I suck at is I can't just keep my mouth shut and let

401
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:16,400
The early day stuff ride out for a little bit longer

402
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:22,080
You know, I got to be out there doing a podcast like two years or in the case of bitcoin like 13 years before anybody

403
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:26,320
Cares about it, right? I got to be like out there. Mr. Early adopter not in a bragging way

404
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:30,160
No, no, not in a breaking way like in a shut up and be strategic you moron way

405
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:34,400
Why aren't you a better businessman way that kind of way, you know, that's how I feel. Anyways

406
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,160
moving on

407
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:39,600
The github interaction on the website stuff. Oh, wow

408
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:44,800
Right. Oh, wow. Yeah, how good it's super great. Yeah

409
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:48,240
Thank you. Everyone really so we have been reading it

410
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:53,120
we have been conversating around it and trying to figure out like

411
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:58,000
What makes sense what resonates with us how we want to kind of break this thing into multiple phases?

412
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:01,200
So I asked west to come into my office earlier

413
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:06,480
And i've kind of decided like let's take let's sit down and kind of take a look at what we do know

414
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:15,040
And what we don't know where we're at. And so that was sort of the framing for our conversation around the website

415
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:35,680
Wes pains back here in the office with me wes welcome into the office. Thank you. You even brought a chair in

416
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:39,040
I mean, there's not much room. You're kind of standing over me, but it works

417
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:44,000
Yeah, brent wanted me to only have a stool but I decided you deserved a nice comfy chair because after all

418
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:47,040
You're basically the cto of our summer projects here

419
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:48,240
You get you know

420
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:52,560
You get full veto power as far as i'm concerned on anything before we deploy it

421
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:55,760
and I feel like we're kind of coming to a bit of a

422
00:31:56,240 --> 00:32:03,520
Firm understanding of what we know we are going to bite off and tackle this summer. Yeah, that was kind of mission one

423
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:09,440
We got stuck with this. Hey change up the website, but we started thinking about it. And you know, the website is really just

424
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:14,800
one output of many that we have and they all the outputs kind of stem from

425
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:18,400
you know, whatever we use as our source of truth and so

426
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:24,640
Making changes to the website is one thing but we got to kind of factor in how does that affect everything upstream and

427
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:27,520
potentially downstream of it and sort of pick

428
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:34,560
Of the pieces of automation because it's not just the website, right? We've got some existing automation around publishing the episodes taking

429
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:40,000
you know going from the editor's great output and putting it in all the right places where the audience can reach it and

430
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:44,560
What parts of those do we want to commit to changing?

431
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:49,600
To facilitate whatever the next stage of the website is and then what other changes does it make sense to do?

432
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:55,200
At that same time and are there some things that make sense to hold off just for a little bit

433
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:58,880
so that way we can kind of keep this in a reasonable set of goals because

434
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:03,440
We could pretty easily spin off into building a totally new

435
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:08,960
Complex monster that would like address all of our workflow issues we've ever had and that would be wonderful

436
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:13,280
But we don't really need to do it all at once and we do have like an actual deadline to get the you know

437
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:19,600
To accomplish the website component and I think there's still like shows to record too. Yeah, there's that so we've kind of figured out

438
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:24,320
It seems like for phase one. We're probably going to keep fireside as our back end cdn

439
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:29,920
And and what we're calling sort of our source of truth for the most part at least what goes public?

440
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:36,480
What do we mean by source of truth one place to collect all the information about the show that defines a defines an episode, you know

441
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:42,880
So that's that starts with things like the title the description the set of tags associated with it includes the links it includes

442
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:47,680
Information about who sponsored that show if any it includes the hosts the guests

443
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:52,720
It might include something like a transcript in the future, you know, so there's one spot to go

444
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:58,800
To modify things to make changes to find the reference for that episode and one one place of data that then can feed

445
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:01,440
Any other system that needs to take it and you know

446
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:07,520
Translate it into whether that be translated to the feed translate it to some markdown for a website engine

447
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:12,000
Or something else you can probably imagine listener happens all the time

448
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:16,800
Like we get an episode out there like oh, we forgot a link or oh this link needs to be changed

449
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:20,160
We should have this person's name to the guest list stuff like that happens

450
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:25,120
And so you want like a source of truth that the editors and the hosts and everybody else on the team

451
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:29,680
Knows that's where they go to make changes. So we're going to kind of use fireside as that right now

452
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:33,040
But we're going to lay our own website on top of that

453
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:38,480
And then the other bit that's pretty important for us to work with the podcasting 2.0 spec

454
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:45,440
Is we're going to start biting off generating our own rss feeds, which so far we've kind of been reluctant to ever really take on

455
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:50,640
Well, you know, we messed that up and people can't listen to the shows we're off the air. So that's a big deal

456
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:52,640
But we also want like you said we want

457
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:57,120
Enclosure option support we want transcript support. We want to improve chapter support

458
00:34:57,120 --> 00:35:02,320
There's so many things in the 2.0 spec that we want to be able to work into this and to do that

459
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:08,640
We have to just sort of manage the feeds ourselves because we find that the platforms out there that generate these feeds for you

460
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:12,000
While they're nice and reliable and they have good cdns and all that kind of stuff

461
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:16,240
They're not really aggressive about adding these features. We have a more advanced audience

462
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:21,520
That's a little bit more of an earth. Well, not a little bit that is, you know, a lot of early adopters

463
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
And so they want these features

464
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:29,360
Before other podcast audiences are demanding them. Maybe that's because sort of underscores a lot of what we're doing actually

465
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:31,360
I think we're you know

466
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:35,600
Partially realizing that that some of this stuff being able to have the feed, you know

467
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:38,480
That that meets the audience's needs that meets our needs

468
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:42,800
We're not just making a podcast. We're pretty committed to the podcasting medium, right?

469
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:46,160
It's kind of the primary output that we have we have other outputs sure, you know

470
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:52,720
Like we have the videos on youtube and stuff like that, but the feeds that's that's the heart of jupiter broadcasting in many ways

471
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:58,320
Yep, so we want to make sure we get that right. So we figured out feeds. We're going to generate a new website

472
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:02,560
It's going to be a static website. We're going to take that on a new live page all the sort of

473
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:05,440
accessory side pages and stuff like that

474
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:08,960
page all the sort of accessory side pages like

475
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:13,120
You know the calendar page the donation page matrix info mumble info

476
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:17,840
We're going to try to make it pretty straightforward to create pages that won't have to be updated too often

477
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:23,200
But will hopefully be high performance and and and load fast for you and look clean

478
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:29,680
We have that kind of stuff dialed in and we kind of have a high level of requirements figured out to support all of that

479
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:31,040
You know

480
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:33,040
You've been thinking a little bit too about a more modern

481
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:39,360
publishing workflow about a new way we could host this because what we're transitioning from today is a wordpress site

482
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:42,320
That runs on scale engine and it's been good

483
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:48,560
But it really was a different way of running this stuff and there's kind of a more modern way to architect this few years ago

484
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:53,920
We were manually adding posts to the wordpress every time an episode came out, right and that's very flexible

485
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:57,360
It means like, you know you as a as a small business person like you have complete control

486
00:36:57,360 --> 00:37:00,800
You don't have to learn a whole crazy system. It's it's designed around interactivity

487
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:03,440
But when we switch to a more automated workflow

488
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:08,800
Interactivity was less of our concern instead of you know automation and reproducibility. Yeah

489
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:12,880
And and really just the ability to just do things at scale

490
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:18,560
There's really no reason why an episode needs to sit around and wait for somebody to go through and create a wordpress post

491
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:21,040
After an editor's done that's what we realized a while ago

492
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:24,240
And we set off to fix that with our cast a blast to back end

493
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:27,360
And that's been now that's really carried us a long way

494
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:32,960
And this is kind of completing that and you have invested west in back end infrastructure to help automate some of this stuff

495
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:37,200
Where do you think? Where do you think? We're really going to be adding to our existing system. Is it going to be

496
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:43,520
Employing things on github more like where do you think one of the big tweaks is going to be in our in our back end infrastructure?

497
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:44,720
Yeah for the moment

498
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:48,480
We've kind of got a you know a collection of automations that tie together primarily

499
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:54,400
Closed systems, right? Like we can't give the audience access to the wordpress. We're not going to give them access to the fireside

500
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:58,260
Unfortunately, so those are all kind of just closed off pieces that we you know

501
00:37:58,340 --> 00:38:02,900
We've got credentials to we join these apis together and shuffle data around but in the future

502
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:09,300
We'd absolutely love to have more things available on github both for you know collaboration reasons internally

503
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:11,460
But also externally with the audience to share, you know

504
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:17,380
We're not going to be experts in all the tools we use we we know already the audience has a ton of great opinions say on

505
00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:19,860
static site builders and so if we can

506
00:38:19,860 --> 00:38:23,540
You know publish the stuff that we're doing and get some some help or input from the audience on

507
00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:25,940
On tweaking the website to be as cool as possible

508
00:38:26,420 --> 00:38:30,180
I think that's a great idea and we're not going to get totally there in phase one

509
00:38:30,580 --> 00:38:36,100
I'd love to see us keep our source of truth on github as well, but there's some complications especially like

510
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:38,980
We have a sort of you know time sensitive

511
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:43,700
Scheduling workflow sometimes where we we need an episode to come out at a certain time, but not before

512
00:38:44,180 --> 00:38:47,940
We've got you know restrictions on necessarily who might have access to things

513
00:38:48,580 --> 00:38:49,860
when

514
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:52,820
And we rely on fireside for some of those things right now

515
00:38:52,820 --> 00:38:54,820
But in the future

516
00:38:55,220 --> 00:39:00,740
I think we can change that we just got to pick off the right size chunks so that we can actually accomplish these things

517
00:39:00,740 --> 00:39:02,580
And not totally break

518
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:04,580
everything

519
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:10,980
The github conversation and discussions have been really useful for kind of thinking through some of that and that's just it

520
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:14,500
You know, there's it's sort of a nice way to kind of move through this and figure. Okay

521
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:18,340
Yeah, we have to have this like we as we started whiteboarding this out. We realized

522
00:39:18,340 --> 00:39:25,560
Scheduling the publishing is actually a little bit more of a complicated problem that we initially thought and that's one of the one of the ways

523
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:31,240
Keeping fireside as our source of truth solves that because it has a mechanism built in for scheduling

524
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:36,120
but what we really like about eventually moving the entire workflow to github and we think we have ways we could do it is

525
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:41,720
That's where we could eventually bring in the audience and somebody could do a pull request against show notes

526
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:45,000
and either make an addition or a subtraction or a correction and

527
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:51,400
Not only would that be powerful around the you know, the the week that the episode comes out, but imagine

528
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:54,760
somebody's listening to an episode five years from now and

529
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:58,440
There's a bad link or something's dead in the show notes

530
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:02,600
They could help us keep that as a living relevant document

531
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:07,400
That's still useful to people even stuff that's in the back catalog that we would never go back through an audit anymore

532
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:12,360
So I guess what I'm saying is we have motivations and reasons to take it beyond what we want to do in phase one

533
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:16,680
It just seems like we have to be reasonable about what we choose to bite off at this stage

534
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:21,880
Yeah, you know, we're trying to find our squeakiest wheels and right now that's the website and then the feeds

535
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:25,800
It's just so core and you know, it kind of makes sense to you because the data is quite similar

536
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:28,440
It's both very driven on on the shows and the episode

537
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:33,320
So we need the same a lot of the same data for the feeds as we end up needing for the website

538
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:39,960
So I think I think there's going to be some nice combination there where we can get two birds one stone and a whole lot of podcasts

539
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:43,240
Very good. Well, thank you. Mr. Payne. Thanks for coming to the office and going over this

540
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:48,920
We press on and it's gonna just get better and better and the summer is gonna be exciting looking forward to it

541
00:40:48,920 --> 00:41:09,640
All right. Now you get back to work. Wait, you're supposed to give me that expense card. I'm sorry. You got to go now

542
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:16,520
All right, so I actually kind of wanted to do something a little different for the boost segments

543
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:22,600
If you want to share your story lurks a lot, but you told me in the matrix room the other day and I love these stories about how

544
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:27,160
You decided to take the challenge and figure out how to do the boost thing

545
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:33,400
Which has now sent you down the rabbit hole of self-hosting and running an umbral instance and all that kind of stuff

546
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:37,800
I mean, what do you what do you uh, what do you want to share?

547
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:40,520
I mean, I don't want to put you on the spot, but i'd love to hear a little bit of the story

548
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:45,320
Wanting to do more self-hosting was something I want to do. Anyway, I just like to learn

549
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:51,240
And play with the stuff and you know, I don't know i'm an enthusiast always have been but

550
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:56,920
It's really just been all of this talk about the podcasting 2.0 and the value for value

551
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:59,400
just kind of really piqued my interest because

552
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:01,960
for me, um

553
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:05,480
The main appeal of bitcoin has never been this whole like speculative

554
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:10,600
Oh if I buy a little and hodl it and i'll be so rich kind of thing that draws a lot of people in

555
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,160
um, I like kind of more the uh

556
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:19,800
What do you call it? The um, the idealism behind it of enabling people to do things and giving people

557
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:25,400
You know like a decentralized kind of you know, consensus based system for money. I like that a lot

558
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:33,160
Yeah, you know for me. It was the decentralized network the the shared computing thing. I've always loved

559
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:39,400
Clustered computing especially clustered computing over the internet and that's what drew me into it as well

560
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:44,280
As well, but i'm wondering if if you kind of got these this sensation I did

561
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:50,360
Which was really kind of a cool sensation was when I first self-hosted a service I felt

562
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:57,240
It felt good. Like I had taken control of something and a term that gets used often is like I had sovereignty over it

563
00:42:58,120 --> 00:42:59,880
It was cool to have that feeling with my data

564
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:04,600
It was a whole other experience to have it with money to be like

565
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:07,160
I don't have to go to paypal to ask for this money

566
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:11,480
I don't have to go to stripe to ask for this money. I don't have to go for the bank to the bank when somebody

567
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:13,080
boosts the show

568
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:18,040
It shows up on the note in my office here at the studio and it's physically like there

569
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:24,120
It's really like it's like having a register and it's actually mine. It's we have sovereignty over it

570
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:27,800
And that is such a it's such a hard concept to convey

571
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:32,760
But it's one of those things like self-hosting that when once you feel it you love that sensation

572
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:35,640
So you're getting both at the same time right now. It's pretty great

573
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:37,640
So what are you going to try experimenting with?

574
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:42,920
well right now i'm really kind of learning a lot about the lightning network and stuff and so

575
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:45,400
um, I do have this excitement about

576
00:43:46,020 --> 00:43:51,080
Participating helping keep the network healthy and running a bitcoin in the lightning node

577
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:55,960
But like i'm not set up for routing man. This channel stuff is hard to figure out with the lightning

578
00:43:56,840 --> 00:44:02,440
Yeah, yeah, it is. There are some good resources out there including some good youtube videos

579
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:06,120
I'll try to find a couple and throw them in the show notes if I remember after the show because there's some good ways

580
00:44:06,120 --> 00:44:07,480
To get started there

581
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:09,480
But that is it is a complicated thing

582
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:13,880
It is legitimately probably just as complicated as running an email server. I mean it is

583
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:17,640
it is not for the faint of heart what you asked me about like

584
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:22,200
That sensation that you get once you self-host something for me

585
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:25,880
Like the first thing is I went ahead despite everybody's advice

586
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:29,960
Which is which is actually kind of spot on and i'm hosted my own email

587
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:35,880
And i'm still doing it because I still like it and uh, then the big one for me was when I got my family

588
00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:39,960
To switch to my own matrix server and now my whole family

589
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:45,640
We have our own pet and it just feels good to not be on google's hangouts or anything else like it

590
00:44:46,420 --> 00:44:48,360
Congratulations on that

591
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:50,360
That is awesome, man. Well done

592
00:44:51,240 --> 00:44:53,240
That is that is a big win right there

593
00:44:53,720 --> 00:44:55,560
Uh, well, thanks for sharing

594
00:44:55,560 --> 00:45:00,280
Uh, I appreciate you, uh coming on and hanging out in the office for a few minutes and I want to uh

595
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:02,760
switch over to you now brent because

596
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:07,480
You were setting up your own node this last week because one of the things we want to experiment

597
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:10,280
with office hours

598
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:13,560
Is in the podcasting 2.0 spec for the value

599
00:45:14,500 --> 00:45:17,400
Um namespace the value element or whatever you want to call it

600
00:45:18,440 --> 00:45:20,200
they have this

601
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:22,200
concept of splits

602
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:28,520
And the idea with the split is and if you go look at the podcasting 2.0 show, in fact

603
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:33,720
Let's go pull it up right now on the on the website. If you go look over there. You'll see they have these splits between

604
00:45:34,840 --> 00:45:36,520
a bunch of participants

605
00:45:36,520 --> 00:45:37,880
in the show

606
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:40,840
This is like an automatic way so that when people send in boosts

607
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:44,520
You can set splits to go to the host to the producer to the editor

608
00:45:45,080 --> 00:45:50,680
So so here on the podcasting 2.0 show, which is the weekly show that talks about the work going on

609
00:45:50,680 --> 00:45:53,720
They have most of the split going to the podcast index

610
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:57,480
Then they have some of their split going to their chapters editor

611
00:45:57,960 --> 00:46:02,760
Another bit of the split going to sovereign feeds. That's how they generate their podcasting 2.0 feed

612
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:07,400
And then they have a couple of really small sats going to the boostagram bots

613
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:10,040
Because those if you send them one sat they can help like

614
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:15,960
Announce on mastodon or in a chat room that you've got in a boost. So they kind of also play with that a little bit

615
00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:18,760
But one of the ideas here of these splits

616
00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:25,560
Is in the podcasting 2.0 app when you go to send a boost you can actually see how the podcast

617
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:29,880
Has decided to arrange those splits and in some cases you could even override them

618
00:46:30,440 --> 00:46:36,760
But the thought is is that it's a way to send value to the individuals who are contributing value to the podcast

619
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:38,920
On an ongoing basis so

620
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:41,160
And you can do it per episode or you can do it for the entire feed

621
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:44,360
So you could say automatically on the episodes that brent participates in

622
00:46:44,360 --> 00:46:49,880
Participates in there is a split added to hit to the rss feed for office hours

623
00:46:50,360 --> 00:46:53,880
Where brent gets 10 of all of the boosts for the show?

624
00:46:54,440 --> 00:46:59,640
Another idea i'm experimenting with along these same lines for coder radio and for lup

625
00:47:00,680 --> 00:47:03,480
Is why not send a split to an open source project?

626
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:06,120
You send a boost into the show

627
00:47:06,120 --> 00:47:08,680
10 that week for that episode goes to

628
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:12,440
I don't know the mumble developer. Let's just i'm I guess i'm picking on mumble, right?

629
00:47:12,440 --> 00:47:16,600
They have to be on the lightning network. So i'm collecting a list. So if you know of any send me a boost

630
00:47:17,560 --> 00:47:18,680
Then you know

631
00:47:18,680 --> 00:47:21,640
It's like a way where you can boost the show and like 10

632
00:47:22,360 --> 00:47:25,400
That week goes to a project or something or in this case, you know

633
00:47:25,480 --> 00:47:28,760
10 goes to brent and 10 goes to drew and you know

634
00:47:28,760 --> 00:47:31,720
We kind of or something right? Like I don't actually know what it would look like

635
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:36,600
But what I find appealing about it as a longtime podcaster is it's all transparent

636
00:47:37,080 --> 00:47:40,600
It's all front and center and it's a way for the audience to kind of

637
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:42,600
directly

638
00:47:43,260 --> 00:47:47,740
Give value to like say maybe just maybe the week we're doing like brent gets the split or something

639
00:47:47,740 --> 00:47:50,380
Like you are a brent fan and you think he's been doing great work

640
00:47:51,020 --> 00:47:54,140
You know, it's just an opportunity. I I feel like there's something there

641
00:47:54,220 --> 00:47:59,660
So I said brent go set up a lightning node have at it. Let's try this out. Hoorah

642
00:48:00,140 --> 00:48:03,660
How'd it go? You're pretty smart because you told me several days ago and I think

643
00:48:04,460 --> 00:48:06,380
With the experience we had in january setting yours up

644
00:48:06,380 --> 00:48:12,460
It takes a few days to download the whole blockchain on your node. Yeah, and you do that ahead of time

645
00:48:12,540 --> 00:48:19,180
So I got to it. Thank you to alex for getting me into ansible a little bit. So I took the opportunity to jump in

646
00:48:20,220 --> 00:48:23,740
do a little bit of ansible foo to get this thing up and running which is a

647
00:48:24,380 --> 00:48:27,420
I guess a whole other story that we told in linux unplugged this week

648
00:48:27,580 --> 00:48:30,940
but it was going great once I sort of figured it out and um

649
00:48:30,940 --> 00:48:39,740
I learned the challenge of having several sysadmins sitting on the same server because it turns out alex is doing a bunch of

650
00:48:39,820 --> 00:48:46,860
Experiments and he rebooted the server which actually I guess the node never came back up. So for about a half a day yesterday

651
00:48:48,140 --> 00:48:50,700
We were not downloading the blockchain. So i'm a little behind

652
00:48:51,100 --> 00:48:58,060
On downloading it but um, I think it's gonna work just fine once it gets going and uh, unfortunately

653
00:48:58,060 --> 00:49:01,020
We don't have it up and running at this very moment, but I feel like after the show

654
00:49:01,020 --> 00:49:02,940
Maybe we can uh start playing with it

655
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:05,580
This might be one of those giving the milk away for free moments

656
00:49:05,580 --> 00:49:10,060
But there's like a vps that focuses just on lightning nodes called voltage. Oh

657
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:12,780
And you can

658
00:49:12,780 --> 00:49:14,780
Basically go there depending on how much you want to pay

659
00:49:15,180 --> 00:49:20,460
And they have some pretty cheap plans for individuals and they run a hosted node for you. See that's a great idea

660
00:49:20,940 --> 00:49:22,940
I think that's really attractive actually

661
00:49:23,100 --> 00:49:25,100
That might be like for the hosts

662
00:49:25,100 --> 00:49:30,060
That don't want to run their own node, which should probably be the majority that seems like a pretty nice way to go

663
00:49:30,140 --> 00:49:31,100
but then

664
00:49:31,100 --> 00:49:38,220
the hosts that do want to run their own node have that option and then and i've never used any of these hosted services, but

665
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:40,920
understanding the way the technology works

666
00:49:41,100 --> 00:49:44,540
You absolutely could sort of use the hosted node as your front end

667
00:49:44,700 --> 00:49:49,020
And then the wallet could possibly be like on an umbral box on your land or something like that, too

668
00:49:49,580 --> 00:49:51,580
So that's kind of fun and cool

669
00:49:51,660 --> 00:49:53,660
so there's again

670
00:49:53,660 --> 00:49:56,940
A lot of work that still needs to be done, but you can feel we're getting there, right?

671
00:49:57,020 --> 00:49:59,340
Like there's progress made almost every single week

672
00:50:00,220 --> 00:50:01,980
People are trying it out

673
00:50:01,980 --> 00:50:04,140
I'm trying to find the right balance and how to talk about it

674
00:50:04,700 --> 00:50:06,380
You know that kind of stuff

675
00:50:06,380 --> 00:50:06,620
well

676
00:50:06,620 --> 00:50:08,940
And it feels like this show is an appropriate place to just kind of

677
00:50:09,260 --> 00:50:13,100
Throw all caution out the window and just try these things. So bring it on. Yep

678
00:50:13,420 --> 00:50:15,420
So we will be trying that out eventually

679
00:50:15,740 --> 00:50:20,460
Probably the first show where we experiment with taking over our own feed generation is going to be this one

680
00:50:20,460 --> 00:50:25,340
And the other benefit to doing that is then the members will be able to boost as well

681
00:50:25,900 --> 00:50:29,820
Because right now our core problem is that the platforms we use don't support the value tag

682
00:50:30,140 --> 00:50:35,180
And so the member feeds don't support it and on the daily I hear from a member who's like I'd really like to send you

683
00:50:35,180 --> 00:50:38,700
A boost it's like the most requested feature right now. Yeah. Yeah

684
00:50:39,500 --> 00:50:41,180
Speaking of boosts

685
00:50:41,180 --> 00:50:46,940
Dpg sent a boost in two days ago says he's loving the office. He wants to know about our support for codecs

686
00:50:46,940 --> 00:50:51,820
I mentioned this earlier. He's asking about google's lira and also just about opus in general

687
00:50:52,140 --> 00:50:54,860
Or are we going to be stuck with mp3 forever?

688
00:50:55,740 --> 00:51:03,260
You know, I think momentum on these alternative codecs was lost when at the when the patent expired or whatever it was on mp3

689
00:51:03,820 --> 00:51:06,460
Years ago now and momentum was just kind of lost

690
00:51:07,100 --> 00:51:11,660
Opus is probably personally for me the most appealing on that list there

691
00:51:11,660 --> 00:51:16,060
If you could point me in the direction of a couple of podcast apps, I could test with opus

692
00:51:16,540 --> 00:51:21,820
It's not beyond the scope of something i'd be willing to consider once we get a 2.0 compliant rss feed

693
00:51:22,220 --> 00:51:27,020
because over the years i've probably gotten a couple of hundred requests for opus and

694
00:51:27,980 --> 00:51:31,820
That's one of the benefits to joining the mumble room is you get the opus codec

695
00:51:31,820 --> 00:51:36,300
Which we have turned up to like 96 kilobits or something like that. It just sounds fantastic at 96

696
00:51:37,180 --> 00:51:39,500
So maybe maybe maybe

697
00:51:39,500 --> 00:51:41,500
Maybe maybe

698
00:51:41,500 --> 00:51:45,740
True grits wrote in with a thousand sats. I would be fine listening to normal jb content

699
00:51:45,740 --> 00:51:51,020
They write ads and everything if I could just get the unplugged live stream boosts enabled. There you go

700
00:51:51,180 --> 00:51:53,180
Plus one for that feature request

701
00:51:53,340 --> 00:51:55,340
I know man. I know

702
00:51:55,500 --> 00:51:58,060
I know we're getting there. It's just not that simple it is

703
00:51:58,780 --> 00:52:03,900
It requires the building of our own entire infrastructure to do it, but we will get there one day, right?

704
00:52:04,140 --> 00:52:07,420
Which we will thank you for pushing us in that direction, but there's work to be done

705
00:52:07,420 --> 00:52:10,060
It's definitely gotten the conversations really going

706
00:52:10,620 --> 00:52:10,940
All right

707
00:52:10,940 --> 00:52:14,860
Thank you everybody for sending a boost if you'd like to boost us do podcast apps dot com

708
00:52:15,260 --> 00:52:20,780
And I like the blue wallet if you're outside the us and strike if you're inside the us to charge it up

709
00:52:21,180 --> 00:52:24,940
Now we got an email into the show about matrix and things

710
00:52:25,340 --> 00:52:31,180
It says hi chris longtime listener for just about all your shows and i'm an occasional participant in the telegram group

711
00:52:31,900 --> 00:52:36,300
I've been listening to you talk about matrix for quite some time now and i've messed with it on and off over the years

712
00:52:36,300 --> 00:52:39,500
As well i've had high hopes for matrix and perhaps it will work out

713
00:52:39,580 --> 00:52:43,980
But I do wonder if your attention on it is sucking all of the oxygen out of the room

714
00:52:44,220 --> 00:52:48,540
Perhaps there are other technologies which could be even better that are not getting the spotlight

715
00:52:49,100 --> 00:52:54,640
You've been a big advocate for decentralized and self-hosted options. But what about distributed and serverless?

716
00:52:55,340 --> 00:52:57,340
Could perhaps that not be even better?

717
00:52:57,740 --> 00:53:03,820
Think no synapse to even have to manage that's attractive. Yeah, really projects like talks

718
00:53:03,820 --> 00:53:10,540
Session jammy, they're foss and they aim to do the core of what matrix is doing but without the need for any servers at all

719
00:53:11,340 --> 00:53:16,540
I know matrix is a bit more ambitious, but perhaps it's aiming to do more than what people really need just food for thought

720
00:53:16,620 --> 00:53:19,740
Thanks for all you do. That's a great solid question right there and

721
00:53:20,540 --> 00:53:25,180
I'll tell you I have thought sometimes would would actually look something like matter most almost be better

722
00:53:25,820 --> 00:53:30,300
For what we're trying to do, you know, we want to have a place for our community to come together

723
00:53:30,300 --> 00:53:38,380
That has discussion channels essentially for each show and for other topics like bitcoin or

724
00:53:38,940 --> 00:53:44,620
Nicks and you know just stuff that maybe isn't particularly for one show but something our community still kind of follows or at least some

725
00:53:44,620 --> 00:53:48,300
Of our community, but maybe not all of them. So we don't want it in the main room that kind of stuff

726
00:53:49,420 --> 00:53:51,100
and um

727
00:53:51,100 --> 00:53:57,260
You know, obviously discord has been heavily heavily heavily considered as well as just sticking with irc

728
00:53:57,260 --> 00:54:03,900
But I think ultimately what draws us back to matrix is two key factors

729
00:54:05,180 --> 00:54:06,620
number one

730
00:54:06,620 --> 00:54:07,660
is

731
00:54:07,660 --> 00:54:14,460
The federated nature means that it allows our audience to scratch that self-hosting itch if they want but still participate in our community

732
00:54:14,780 --> 00:54:16,780
Which is really cool

733
00:54:16,780 --> 00:54:21,900
Uh, it also means that they could just join matrix.org if they like because right now we have registrations closed on ours

734
00:54:21,900 --> 00:54:28,060
So that's a factor but what really has drawn me personally and and probably why i'm talking about it more is

735
00:54:28,620 --> 00:54:32,940
More and more and more free software projects are making that their community

736
00:54:33,900 --> 00:54:39,500
And so i'm in a red hat room. I'm in a gnome room. I'm in a plasma kde room, right?

737
00:54:39,500 --> 00:54:45,980
I'm in a security and an open source radical thinkers room. I'm I i'm in an accessibility room

738
00:54:45,980 --> 00:54:49,980
That's trying to do accessibility for gtk stuff and i'm i'm in a room for people that are trying to do

739
00:54:49,980 --> 00:54:53,340
Outreach for people that are you know for groups that aren't really in open source yet

740
00:54:53,340 --> 00:54:57,180
And they're trying to bring new people in and it's like all of these diverse

741
00:54:58,380 --> 00:55:01,820
Opinions and rooms all on one giant network

742
00:55:02,620 --> 00:55:06,620
And I can join as chris at jupiter broadcasting.com, right? So it's like

743
00:55:07,420 --> 00:55:12,060
Or chris last whatever. I think it's just chris. So it's like it has that identity aspect to it

744
00:55:12,220 --> 00:55:16,540
It has that network effect to it. It has that self-hosting element to it

745
00:55:16,540 --> 00:55:21,820
It has this sort of feeling like this is going somewhere like the trend line is in the right direction as well

746
00:55:21,820 --> 00:55:26,300
Which is usually when I start adopting something as an early adopter i'm like, okay, it's early

747
00:55:26,300 --> 00:55:29,580
But I like the direction of that trend line and that's when I get on board

748
00:55:30,140 --> 00:55:33,420
But that's not to take away from all the other stuff you mentioned or the stuff. I just mentioned

749
00:55:34,140 --> 00:55:36,620
It may end up ultimately not being the best decision

750
00:55:36,940 --> 00:55:41,580
but I think what we really have to remember and what I try to keep in mind is like

751
00:55:42,300 --> 00:55:43,820
98 of the

752
00:55:43,820 --> 00:55:47,180
Listeners don't even participate in any of this stuff, right? They don't got time for this

753
00:55:47,500 --> 00:55:52,060
They got stuff to do or they just can't be bothered and honestly, they're probably better off and healthier for it

754
00:55:52,060 --> 00:55:56,220
Let's see. Let's be real right the internet can be an awful place. Although our communities are great

755
00:55:56,780 --> 00:56:01,420
Uh, so I also have to realize like this isn't the stuff that makes or breaks the business, right? Like

756
00:56:01,980 --> 00:56:04,460
If I if I bet the farm, uh on matrix

757
00:56:05,500 --> 00:56:07,580
Doesn't really any impact impact anything on air. Does it?

758
00:56:08,220 --> 00:56:10,940
Uh, we just maybe you know, maybe don't get the right kind of interactions, but

759
00:56:10,940 --> 00:56:15,900
So far we've been getting great interactions from our matrix community. I mean they're going right now as we talk and uh, you know

760
00:56:15,900 --> 00:56:21,580
I knew about sir lurks a lot's journey into self-hosting after he got into boosting because he said something in the kota radio feedback

761
00:56:21,660 --> 00:56:24,860
matrix and like so it it does definitely create communities and

762
00:56:25,500 --> 00:56:30,540
Uh, we have a really really awesome bitcoin community in there because it's a bunch of level-headed

763
00:56:30,700 --> 00:56:36,700
Bitcoiners, but they're all a bunch of level-headed people that respect each other and talk rationally and aren't a bunch of like scammers and

764
00:56:36,700 --> 00:56:41,340
Like that's been a real source of good conversation as the market has just been totally tanking

765
00:56:41,500 --> 00:56:46,060
to have a bunch of level-headed people in there talking about it and and you know sharing their thoughts and

766
00:56:46,460 --> 00:56:48,460
definitely a diverse set of opinions

767
00:56:48,780 --> 00:56:53,660
And I really found that fulfilling and I just don't i'm not getting that anywhere else outside of matrix right now. In fact

768
00:56:54,380 --> 00:57:00,380
I think you're seeing a real drawdown in telegram activity as that discussion has moved over to matrix as a result

769
00:57:00,380 --> 00:57:04,540
I don't know if what your observations are on this brand. I know matrix is a company that's

770
00:57:04,540 --> 00:57:09,100
What your observations are on this brand? I know matrix has been a little bit harder of an adoption curve for you

771
00:57:09,180 --> 00:57:11,180
So maybe you see things a little differently

772
00:57:11,180 --> 00:57:13,340
No, I I actually do have to agree

773
00:57:13,500 --> 00:57:19,100
Uh, I know I haven't necessarily witnessed the stuff on on the matrix side as much as you have because of some of the

774
00:57:20,060 --> 00:57:25,900
Challenges I think partly due to some of the older hardware i'm trying to you know, make use of but I

775
00:57:26,460 --> 00:57:29,500
Gotta say I noticed just this morning that the telegram chat

776
00:57:30,060 --> 00:57:32,060
Was feeling a little

777
00:57:32,060 --> 00:57:36,620
I don't know. I saw a few tumbleweeds passing by in there and I thought oh, yeah

778
00:57:36,780 --> 00:57:41,660
It's not because the discussion is not happening. It's just because it's happening elsewhere. Yeah, and maybe it's better than matrix

779
00:57:41,740 --> 00:57:44,380
I mean, i'm sorry the telegram is honestly in my opinion

780
00:57:45,180 --> 00:57:46,300
more

781
00:57:46,300 --> 00:57:49,500
Followable now like it's not just like you show up and it's like oh god. I can't keep up with this

782
00:57:49,820 --> 00:57:52,380
Yeah, it used to be a little overwhelming actually. Yeah

783
00:57:53,340 --> 00:57:57,980
So it's not all bad. No, I think it's just different really I I do appreciate the feedback

784
00:57:57,980 --> 00:58:03,500
I am totally open to more uh feedback on the topic because you know, i'm not married to anyone particular thing

785
00:58:03,500 --> 00:58:05,180
It's just where i'm at right now

786
00:58:05,180 --> 00:58:10,620
James wrote in hi. I keep on wanting to help the show by subscribing or these new boosts

787
00:58:11,240 --> 00:58:13,980
16 a month for a membership is too much for me

788
00:58:13,980 --> 00:58:18,060
But there doesn't seem to be an option for supporting a single show at a lesser cost

789
00:58:18,700 --> 00:58:25,100
I downloaded fountain went to buy whatever it is. It gave me a code and left me hanging no instructions on how to buy

790
00:58:25,100 --> 00:58:30,540
I've never bought bitcoin before so i'm still stuck with no real idea how to support your shows

791
00:58:30,620 --> 00:58:34,860
I'll research it later. But wondering how many others are put off you're coming in cold

792
00:58:35,420 --> 00:58:39,260
What happens is you go into something like fountain or castamatic or another one of these new apps?

793
00:58:39,740 --> 00:58:42,220
The way lightning works is traditionally it's invoice based

794
00:58:42,860 --> 00:58:44,860
So you generate an invoice in that app?

795
00:58:45,660 --> 00:58:49,580
And it gives you a long code or a qr code, but a long

796
00:58:50,220 --> 00:58:51,500
string

797
00:58:51,500 --> 00:58:53,500
It doesn't buy the bitcoin for you

798
00:58:53,500 --> 00:58:59,420
Because that would probably get them in a whole bunch of new types of regulations and legal troubles all over the world, right?

799
00:58:59,420 --> 00:59:06,780
Like you can imagine how much there is to navigate there because of all of the know your customer requirements of the financial system

800
00:59:07,740 --> 00:59:10,140
So they generate the invoice and then the idea is

801
00:59:10,860 --> 00:59:12,860
That you go use a lightning compliant

802
00:59:13,500 --> 00:59:14,300
app

803
00:59:14,300 --> 00:59:16,140
like strike or

804
00:59:16,140 --> 00:59:23,500
blue wallet or cash app something like that and then you paste that long code into that app and

805
00:59:24,060 --> 00:59:27,980
It will then recognize the invoice amount and make the transaction happen

806
00:59:28,540 --> 00:59:34,140
But it's not obvious and that is why if we didn't have such a technical savvy audience

807
00:59:34,220 --> 00:59:36,460
I just wouldn't even bother even doing this

808
00:59:37,180 --> 00:59:38,300
but

809
00:59:38,300 --> 00:59:40,300
Like if we don't figure out

810
00:59:40,860 --> 00:59:42,460
These rough spots

811
00:59:42,460 --> 00:59:44,940
If we won't early adopt some of this stuff like matrix

812
00:59:44,940 --> 00:59:47,820
Like boosts, it's never going to go anywhere and

813
00:59:48,540 --> 00:59:52,860
We can see the network effect building, but we still have hurdles to overcome

814
00:59:53,580 --> 01:00:00,300
But man, is it so so so much better than it was a year ago. It's so much better now and like

815
01:00:01,420 --> 01:00:03,420
Strike makes it so

816
01:00:03,820 --> 01:00:06,060
Stupid simple and it used to be really complicated

817
01:00:06,060 --> 01:00:10,460
The only tricky part now is you got to do all your like, you know know your customer id stuff, but they just

818
01:00:11,260 --> 01:00:13,260
They're required to do that now to the memberships

819
01:00:13,260 --> 01:00:19,260
Now to the memberships the boosts are additive. They don't replace the memberships and 16 is a lot

820
01:00:19,900 --> 01:00:22,300
I get that that's just based on what our costs are

821
01:00:23,420 --> 01:00:29,920
And we do offer individual show memberships. Maybe that might be your way to go like unpluggedcore.com or coderqa.co

822
01:00:31,180 --> 01:00:34,860
Those are those are cheaper because they only get you access to that one show but it's still a way to support

823
01:00:35,500 --> 01:00:37,500
I hope as

824
01:00:37,580 --> 01:00:39,580
Things get more regulated

825
01:00:39,660 --> 01:00:41,500
as laws pass

826
01:00:41,500 --> 01:00:48,540
As things get more normalized it won't be that hard for an app like fountain to just charge up the wallet right from inside the app

827
01:00:49,820 --> 01:00:52,220
That's going to happen eventually you can imagine you can see it

828
01:00:52,700 --> 01:00:55,920
Especially if they could just tie right in with apple pay or google pay for the transaction

829
01:00:56,540 --> 01:01:02,140
It'll happen, but we're just not there yet because of the regulatory environment. So in the meantime, there's this two app process

830
01:01:02,860 --> 01:01:04,300
Makes sense, I guess

831
01:01:04,300 --> 01:01:06,860
Not not ideal, right? I think the other thing chris is

832
01:01:06,860 --> 01:01:11,980
Is I think we could do a better job of describing the various options and it's something you and I have talked about

833
01:01:12,300 --> 01:01:15,500
and uh, I think something i'm going to work on in the next week or two is

834
01:01:16,620 --> 01:01:20,060
Just describing our various options a little bit better

835
01:01:20,300 --> 01:01:27,020
You know you've described via audio on several of the episodes and a variety of podcasts how to do some of the boosting

836
01:01:27,580 --> 01:01:33,660
But I think writing that down in tech text with maybe some links to these various apps might be a really nice way to

837
01:01:33,660 --> 01:01:39,100
To someone who's never done it before and also I I feel like you know

838
01:01:39,980 --> 01:01:45,340
This may be kicked off a little bit of the website discussion was it's sometimes a little bit hard to get all that information

839
01:01:45,420 --> 01:01:46,780
on the websites

840
01:01:46,780 --> 01:01:48,780
the way that they're structured currently so

841
01:01:49,420 --> 01:01:52,460
I think we're going to try to do that as best we can right now the new website

842
01:01:52,540 --> 01:01:56,380
Hopefully will help help with that. But I think it's worth putting a little work into that

843
01:01:57,340 --> 01:02:00,540
As it stands. Yeah, having an audio is all well and good

844
01:02:00,540 --> 01:02:05,420
but it's not very accessible when you're in the moment and you're trying to get it set up and you're like

845
01:02:05,420 --> 01:02:11,420
Well, what did he say? And if it was just a dupe dupe dupe kind of thing, you know, just an outline

846
01:02:12,220 --> 01:02:16,620
It'd be a lot. It'd be a lot straight more straightforward. We'll get there. This is where I know i'm making a big ask

847
01:02:17,180 --> 01:02:21,900
Right. This is a big ask i'm making here. It's a calculated thing because it's not something I take lightly

848
01:02:22,780 --> 01:02:24,140
but

849
01:02:24,140 --> 01:02:26,140
If we get it figured out for jb

850
01:02:26,220 --> 01:02:28,620
Then the next linux podcast that comes on

851
01:02:28,620 --> 01:02:34,640
Automatically has a couple thousand people ready to boost their show, right? The next open source project that comes on

852
01:02:35,280 --> 01:02:42,480
Has a couple thousand people ready to boost their project the long-term benefit goes so much farther beyond just jupiter broadcasting

853
01:02:42,720 --> 01:02:47,040
That i'm willing to make the calculated ask i'm trying to be generous in how I ask it

854
01:02:47,120 --> 01:02:49,120
I guess i'm kind of banking on the idea

855
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,320
The people that have been listening to me long enough

856
01:02:53,280 --> 01:02:57,520
You kind of know how I operate right and they know where i'm going with this and they can they can see my logic

857
01:02:57,520 --> 01:02:59,520
Is kind of what i'm hoping

858
01:02:59,840 --> 01:03:02,640
And you know, I get I you know, I get it I get it

859
01:03:02,640 --> 01:03:08,400
It's not super straightforward. I don't want anybody to get frustrated. There are other ways to contribute value that are not just monetary

860
01:03:09,200 --> 01:03:11,200
Honestly, just telling people

861
01:03:11,200 --> 01:03:14,480
about the show and advocating for our shows is

862
01:03:15,520 --> 01:03:19,680
Extremely valuable because podcasts are not something people just generally pick up and listen to

863
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:24,880
That's why these clips thing in fountain has actually been a big thing for me because generally, you know, it's an hour-long show

864
01:03:24,880 --> 01:03:30,560
I'm just going to listen to some randos that I don't even know talk for an hour. Like i'm not going to do that

865
01:03:31,600 --> 01:03:36,720
Right who does so but you know if brent comes to me and says hey, you know

866
01:03:36,720 --> 01:03:38,320
I really think you'd like this episode

867
01:03:38,320 --> 01:03:40,480
They talked about xyz and you know

868
01:03:40,480 --> 01:03:43,840
We've talked about that and I really thought they had some good insights or they they had this great tool

869
01:03:43,840 --> 01:03:48,000
They talked about well, then I listened to that episode. We do that all the time with each other. Oh, yeah

870
01:03:48,400 --> 01:03:53,760
So that is extremely valuable right going and leaving us a rating or a review somewhere

871
01:03:53,760 --> 01:04:00,400
On a on a popular podcast directory very valuable because that obviously helps juice their their metrics

872
01:04:00,400 --> 01:04:05,040
You know leaving a comment on a youtube video and giving us a thumbs up that even helps on the channel there, right?

873
01:04:05,040 --> 01:04:12,160
There's that's it. There's big ways and small ways, uh to help out and contribute and sometimes people like to physically contribute

874
01:04:12,240 --> 01:04:13,440
You know, they show up and help us here

875
01:04:13,440 --> 01:04:17,200
Sometimes they like to show up in the mumba room and contribute that way and it's all of it

876
01:04:17,200 --> 01:04:22,640
It's really super appreciated. Of course the financial contributions super appreciated because it is a business

877
01:04:22,640 --> 01:04:28,960
And it has to run and we got it. We got things. We want to do. We got a big road trip. We're planning for

878
01:04:30,080 --> 01:04:34,240
And my plan is to head down to the shop this weekend

879
01:04:35,120 --> 01:04:37,120
And get suspension problems

880
01:04:37,580 --> 01:04:42,960
Finalized I kind of got like a broken suspension system on our last road trip because the you remember how bad the roads were

881
01:04:42,960 --> 01:04:45,440
It was oh, it was memorably bad

882
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,080
So bad, so so bad

883
01:04:49,440 --> 01:04:50,720
like

884
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:55,600
The worst you've ever experienced third world bad almost like they forgot to finish the road

885
01:04:55,920 --> 01:05:00,000
So we did like some emergency fixes just so we could get out of tucson and get home, right?

886
01:05:00,560 --> 01:05:05,920
But the work wasn't done. There's probably like another five grand worth of work that has to happen. So we're going down

887
01:05:06,320 --> 01:05:08,960
Uh this weekend i'll probably do lup

888
01:05:09,840 --> 01:05:14,320
Live from oregon, so you'll be back home for lup and i'll be live

889
01:05:15,200 --> 01:05:18,160
Wes is on a trip. So wes won't be there this sunday. Oh my goodness

890
01:05:18,160 --> 01:05:23,680
Should I just travel to the studio and keep it company? Well, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, somebody here to run the board, right?

891
01:05:25,200 --> 01:05:29,360
I don't know. Yeah, I gotta think about that that is gonna be tricky. It's gonna be tricky

892
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:34,000
so that's you know, there's just there's a lot just a it's funny like um

893
01:05:35,200 --> 01:05:39,040
How much mundane day-to-day life stuff goes into making all this possible, right?

894
01:05:39,040 --> 01:05:43,680
Because this road trip to to get jupes fixed up is really in service of a bigger road trip

895
01:05:43,680 --> 01:05:48,160
We have planned later in the year to do meetups and stuff like that. It's just how it works. It's

896
01:05:48,880 --> 01:05:49,760
So, uh, let's see

897
01:05:49,760 --> 01:05:51,040
We don't have an office hours next week

898
01:05:51,040 --> 01:05:56,800
But we will have one a week after because we're doing this twice a month fortnightly fortnightly
