WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:12.280
Nestled against the San Gabriel Mountains near Pasadena, California, is a gateway to

00:12.280 --> 00:15.400
the solar system and beyond.

00:15.400 --> 00:21.560
The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a NASA facility, it has been managed since the time of its

00:21.560 --> 00:28.840
creation by the California Institute of Technology, or Caltech.

00:28.840 --> 00:33.400
When visitors first enter the laboratory's museum, they are greeted by an image of three

00:33.400 --> 00:40.680
space pioneers from a half century ago, captured in a moment of celebration.

00:40.680 --> 00:45.840
Explorer was forged in the cauldron of the Cold War, at a time when JPL was building

00:45.840 --> 00:52.480
not spacecraft, but missiles that carried atomic weapons.

00:52.480 --> 01:00.560
This is the story of how JPL entirely changed direction and purpose.

01:00.560 --> 01:05.240
This is also the story of a satellite that would give the world the very first space

01:05.240 --> 01:11.760
science discovery, one that would change our understanding of how life on Earth came to

01:11.760 --> 01:16.480
be.

01:16.480 --> 01:22.800
It's Office Hours with me, Chris.

01:22.800 --> 01:25.440
Hello everybody, welcome into Office Hours.

01:25.440 --> 01:29.060
It's a special one we're packing to hit the road.

01:29.060 --> 01:34.840
It is our last production in studio, and of course that means Brent Lee is in the office

01:34.840 --> 01:35.840
with me.

01:35.840 --> 01:36.840
Welcome in.

01:36.840 --> 01:37.840
Save the seat for you.

01:37.840 --> 01:38.840
It is very cozy.

01:38.840 --> 01:40.000
I forgot how cozy it is in here.

01:40.000 --> 01:42.360
Yeah, it's because I forgot to turn off the oven actually.

01:42.360 --> 01:43.360
Oh.

01:43.360 --> 01:44.360
Yeah.

01:44.360 --> 01:46.040
I was cooking and I just left it on.

01:46.040 --> 01:49.560
It's not the most efficient way, but you know.

01:49.560 --> 01:50.560
It's something.

01:50.560 --> 01:51.560
I was busy.

01:51.560 --> 01:53.520
By oven, do you mean the computers that run the studio?

01:53.520 --> 01:54.520
Basically.

01:54.520 --> 01:55.520
Okay.

01:55.520 --> 01:56.520
Gosh, they're always running, I tell you.

01:56.520 --> 01:57.900
If I can keep them up.

01:57.900 --> 02:01.160
Sometimes they go walk in and they've crashed, but that's a story for another time.

02:01.160 --> 02:04.240
Brent, are you really here?

02:04.240 --> 02:05.720
Did it actually happen?

02:05.720 --> 02:08.080
I just snuck in overnight and you didn't even realize it.

02:08.080 --> 02:09.080
It's incredible.

02:09.080 --> 02:10.080
Wow.

02:10.080 --> 02:12.280
And we have a mumble room here too with us as well.

02:12.280 --> 02:14.080
Hello mumble room, time appropriate greetings.

02:14.080 --> 02:15.080
Hey, Chris.

02:15.080 --> 02:16.080
Hey, Brent.

02:16.080 --> 02:17.080
Hey, guys.

02:17.080 --> 02:18.080
Hello.

02:18.080 --> 02:19.080
Hello.

02:19.080 --> 02:21.040
And hello everybody watching live over at Jupiter.Tube.

02:21.040 --> 02:26.040
So I was watching the live tracker last night before I hit the hay and I saw that you were

02:26.040 --> 02:34.000
entering a very dense region of the Washington state and an area with no cell signal, lots

02:34.000 --> 02:39.960
of wildlife, windy roads, and then to make things even more interesting, we have a ton

02:39.960 --> 02:41.520
of wildfire smoke in the area.

02:41.520 --> 02:43.640
So visibility is low.

02:43.640 --> 02:49.160
And because you like to do it in the hardest way possible, you were driving at night too.

02:49.160 --> 02:50.160
Not exclusively.

02:50.160 --> 02:54.920
I had maybe, I think maybe two and a half hours of nighttime driving.

02:54.920 --> 02:58.360
You probably had though, like the most treacherous part of the driving at night.

02:58.360 --> 02:59.760
You have no idea what I went through.

02:59.760 --> 03:00.760
Oh yeah?

03:00.760 --> 03:01.760
What happened?

03:01.760 --> 03:02.760
What happened?

03:02.760 --> 03:05.660
Well, most of the drive actually was quite similar to that.

03:05.660 --> 03:09.280
So I came from, you know, eastern side of BC.

03:09.280 --> 03:17.100
And so I just, I think I did like five mountain passes, two on the Canadian side.

03:17.100 --> 03:19.360
And then I think it's three on this.

03:19.360 --> 03:20.360
It's ridiculous.

03:20.360 --> 03:22.600
So, so many mountains you have to drive past.

03:22.600 --> 03:27.400
And I could have driven south through Seattle and had the flat easy, you know.

03:27.400 --> 03:28.400
Yeah.

03:28.400 --> 03:32.840
And 20 is our most treacherous, like built old school, like the way they used to build

03:32.840 --> 03:33.840
them.

03:33.840 --> 03:35.120
Which is like, just follow the mountain.

03:35.120 --> 03:36.120
Yeah.

03:36.120 --> 03:42.120
There were a few subterranean tunnels just after the Diablo point that I forgot about.

03:42.120 --> 03:43.920
We drove that together 2018.

03:43.920 --> 03:46.400
Yeah, probably.

03:46.400 --> 03:48.240
And I forgot about those tunnels.

03:48.240 --> 03:49.240
Those were great.

03:49.240 --> 03:50.240
Yeah.

03:50.240 --> 03:51.240
Yeah.

03:51.240 --> 03:53.360
That is though, that's like the route that I don't really take the RV.

03:53.360 --> 03:54.360
I've done it a few times.

03:54.360 --> 03:55.360
I have.

03:55.360 --> 03:56.360
I've done it.

03:56.360 --> 03:57.360
Yeah.

03:57.360 --> 03:58.360
It's something.

03:58.360 --> 03:59.360
It's something.

03:59.360 --> 04:03.520
There's like some serious switchbacks and there's large portions where I'm like shifting

04:03.520 --> 04:04.520
and you know.

04:04.520 --> 04:05.520
Yeah.

04:05.520 --> 04:06.520
I had an active game yesterday.

04:06.520 --> 04:07.520
Yeah.

04:07.520 --> 04:08.520
I had a lot of fun with it.

04:08.520 --> 04:09.520
Yeah, you can.

04:09.520 --> 04:10.520
If you've got a sporty car, you can, you know.

04:10.520 --> 04:11.520
I do not.

04:11.520 --> 04:13.880
Well, I mean, if you can take corners and stuff in that thing pretty well.

04:13.880 --> 04:16.200
Well, like my car is nothing special.

04:16.200 --> 04:18.280
It's an old vibe from the early 2000s.

04:18.280 --> 04:19.280
You did install that supercharger.

04:19.280 --> 04:20.280
Well, there's that.

04:20.280 --> 04:21.280
Yeah.

04:21.280 --> 04:22.280
It sticks out the back.

04:22.280 --> 04:23.280
It's kind of weird.

04:23.280 --> 04:24.280
Yeah.

04:24.280 --> 04:25.280
And it makes kind of a farting duck noise.

04:25.280 --> 04:26.280
Yeah.

04:26.280 --> 04:27.280
Just ignore that part.

04:27.280 --> 04:28.280
Yeah.

04:28.280 --> 04:29.280
It's the performance that counts.

04:29.280 --> 04:30.280
I thought maybe that was cool in Canada.

04:30.280 --> 04:31.280
But it's not.

04:31.280 --> 04:32.280
The Canucks?

04:32.280 --> 04:33.280
Yeah.

04:33.280 --> 04:34.280
The Canuck boost.

04:34.280 --> 04:38.080
It's standard.

04:38.080 --> 04:39.080
It's paid for.

04:39.080 --> 04:40.080
It's like the healthcare system.

04:40.080 --> 04:41.080
Right.

04:41.080 --> 04:42.080
You just get one for free.

04:42.080 --> 04:43.080
Okay.

04:43.080 --> 04:44.080
Good.

04:44.080 --> 04:45.080
Oh, gosh.

04:45.080 --> 04:46.080
Yeah.

04:46.080 --> 04:49.760
So I think the part of the road you're talking about is, yeah, certainly windy, certainly

04:49.760 --> 04:51.080
mountain roads.

04:51.080 --> 04:52.960
But it was like that for the most part.

04:52.960 --> 04:58.880
I mean, the Okanagan section is more flat because there's a bunch of, I guess, trees

04:58.880 --> 05:01.020
growing there with fruit on it that are amazing.

05:01.020 --> 05:04.040
But most of the ride was exactly what you think it was.

05:04.040 --> 05:05.560
So it was a very active drive.

05:05.560 --> 05:10.120
It was 11 hours of very active driving, which is actually fine with me.

05:10.120 --> 05:11.120
Zero traffic.

05:11.120 --> 05:12.120
Yeah.

05:12.120 --> 05:13.120
Just like me in the mountains.

05:13.120 --> 05:16.660
You took the long way in a way, but you took the most scenic way where there is the least

05:16.660 --> 05:17.700
amount of people.

05:17.700 --> 05:21.520
And if I have a choice, I'll take that route, although I usually take it in the day.

05:21.520 --> 05:25.120
If you take it in the day, there's like waterfalls and all kinds of elks.

05:25.120 --> 05:26.600
Most of the drive was in the day.

05:26.600 --> 05:27.600
Oh, yeah.

05:27.600 --> 05:28.600
I did see a bear.

05:28.600 --> 05:29.600
Right.

05:29.600 --> 05:30.600
Which was pretty cool.

05:30.600 --> 05:31.600
Yeah.

05:31.600 --> 05:32.600
I tried to get a little video of it for you.

05:32.600 --> 05:33.600
But these things, turns out they're kind of fast.

05:33.600 --> 05:34.600
Yeah.

05:34.600 --> 05:37.400
And they always look smaller on the cell camera than they do in person.

05:37.400 --> 05:38.400
Yeah.

05:38.400 --> 05:40.120
Tons of deer and stuff is really nice.

05:40.120 --> 05:44.240
And beautiful views despite the thick smoke that followed me the entire way.

05:44.240 --> 05:45.840
It's sort of like last year's road trip.

05:45.840 --> 05:48.980
It's just a cloud of smoke over us, and I think it's going to be like that again.

05:48.980 --> 05:50.240
We were that close, Brent.

05:50.240 --> 05:51.240
Oh, man.

05:51.240 --> 05:52.240
Almost.

05:52.240 --> 05:53.240
We were like...

05:53.240 --> 06:00.240
So we tactically timed the road trip to be late September to try to make it after wildfire

06:00.240 --> 06:01.720
season and to try to also...

06:01.720 --> 06:02.720
And the heat.

06:02.720 --> 06:03.720
Yeah.

06:03.720 --> 06:08.280
We may be successful on the heat part, but I don't think we're going to avoid the smoke.

06:08.280 --> 06:09.280
I just...

06:09.280 --> 06:10.280
Poor dupes.

06:10.280 --> 06:11.280
Oh, man.

06:11.280 --> 06:14.120
She always gets driven in the most extreme conditions.

06:14.120 --> 06:17.680
You know, I was thinking about that though, and this is a total departure, but from what

06:17.680 --> 06:22.480
I've learned about wood stoves is that smoke actually has a lot of combustibles in it.

06:22.480 --> 06:28.740
Something like 70% of the energy in a log is from the smoke because a lot of combustibles

06:28.740 --> 06:29.740
in there.

06:29.740 --> 06:33.040
There's no fire that's hot enough to burn that to have a clean burning, right?

06:33.040 --> 06:38.100
So then I was wondering yesterday, because it's 11 hours of being in the car doing nothing,

06:38.100 --> 06:41.680
in an engine, if it's taking in that smoky air, is that actually a benefit?

06:41.680 --> 06:43.760
Is there some kind of...

06:43.760 --> 06:46.280
Probably not, but you know, that's where my brain goes.

06:46.280 --> 06:47.280
Yeah, because it doesn't want those...

06:47.280 --> 06:49.800
You know, I'm sure it doesn't want those foreign materials anywhere in the combustion

06:49.800 --> 06:50.800
chambers, but...

06:50.800 --> 06:51.800
Why not?

06:51.800 --> 06:52.800
You know what you do need?

06:52.800 --> 06:53.800
You need like a bizarre collector.

06:53.800 --> 07:00.280
So on a Federation starship, a standard Federation, NCC class starship, you see you got bizarre

07:00.280 --> 07:05.880
collectors that are soaking up like radiation and gases and supposedly converting that to

07:05.880 --> 07:07.560
energy in the ship.

07:07.560 --> 07:10.160
That's what those red nobbins are on the end of the warp nacelles.

07:10.160 --> 07:11.800
You just need something like that on chupes.

07:11.800 --> 07:16.600
It's like got a big vacuum face that sits on the roof just collecting stuff, and then

07:16.600 --> 07:19.480
she burns that and generates energy and charges the batteries.

07:19.480 --> 07:20.760
I mean, I think you're onto something.

07:20.760 --> 07:21.760
Red nobbins.

07:21.760 --> 07:22.760
That's the next thing.

07:22.760 --> 07:25.240
So it was a smooth drive, no incidents or anything?

07:25.240 --> 07:27.760
I did have an incident, actually.

07:27.760 --> 07:35.760
I survived it, which is good, but there was a part of the mountain that ended up raining

07:35.760 --> 07:40.680
on the mountain.

07:40.680 --> 07:44.720
So I'm, I think, a pretty aware driver.

07:44.720 --> 07:45.720
I agree.

07:45.720 --> 07:46.720
I think you're a good driver.

07:46.720 --> 07:50.160
And downshifting, you know, not burning your brakes up going down these passes and stuff.

07:50.160 --> 07:53.320
If you've driven mountain passes, you shouldn't ride your brakes all the way down.

07:53.320 --> 07:54.600
Bad, bad idea.

07:54.600 --> 07:56.040
So lots of active shifting and stuff.

07:56.040 --> 07:58.840
But some of these corners are crazy tight and it was raining.

07:58.840 --> 08:04.120
I have some all weather tires, which are winter rated, but they're kind of all seasons that

08:04.120 --> 08:05.240
are winter rated.

08:05.240 --> 08:06.400
They've been amazing for me.

08:06.400 --> 08:09.320
They're great, great tires from Nokian, I think it is.

08:09.320 --> 08:11.920
And I did a thing that Alex will shake his head at.

08:11.920 --> 08:12.920
Okay.

08:12.920 --> 08:16.720
So I was downshifting into a corner and I thought I was doing fine.

08:16.720 --> 08:21.200
But then this one particular corner, it was like a going down a mountain pass, you know,

08:21.200 --> 08:23.520
you got to kind of slow your speeds down.

08:23.520 --> 08:28.960
I think it was like a 40 or 35 recommended turn.

08:28.960 --> 08:30.160
And what were you doing?

08:30.160 --> 08:32.320
Yeah, it's hard because I get kilometers.

08:32.320 --> 08:35.840
I think usually I was doing like five over that.

08:35.840 --> 08:36.840
Oh, okay.

08:36.840 --> 08:37.840
For most of the corners, totally, totally fine.

08:37.840 --> 08:38.840
You got a small car.

08:38.840 --> 08:39.840
Yeah, yeah, that's it, right?

08:39.840 --> 08:40.840
It's totally fine.

08:40.840 --> 08:45.360
But this particular corner, I guess, surprised me in the sense that it was wetter than I

08:45.360 --> 08:46.360
expected.

08:46.360 --> 08:51.920
And so I was going into the corner and was gearing down and stuff, but that wasn't quite

08:51.920 --> 08:52.920
enough.

08:52.920 --> 08:55.540
So I did the thing you're not supposed to do.

08:55.540 --> 08:57.320
And I am kicking myself.

08:57.320 --> 09:04.120
I just put my foot on the brakes slightly and I hit the brake right in the like apex

09:04.120 --> 09:05.120
of the corner.

09:05.120 --> 09:07.320
That's exactly what you don't want to do.

09:07.320 --> 09:13.240
There's this like, human reaction versus what is the right thing.

09:13.240 --> 09:18.440
It's like just the other day, I was going a little bit faster than I should and a cop

09:18.440 --> 09:22.240
pulled in behind me and I know I shouldn't hit my brakes because that just sort of signals

09:22.240 --> 09:24.480
to him that I know I'm speeding, right?

09:24.480 --> 09:25.480
But I couldn't help it.

09:25.480 --> 09:26.480
I just hit the brakes.

09:26.480 --> 09:27.480
No, what are you doing?

09:27.480 --> 09:28.480
Don't hit the brakes.

09:28.480 --> 09:29.480
Just coast a little bit.

09:29.480 --> 09:30.480
You're good.

09:30.480 --> 09:31.480
You're good.

09:31.480 --> 09:32.480
Yeah, it's just like you can't help it.

09:32.480 --> 09:33.480
It's instinct.

09:33.480 --> 09:37.800
So unfortunately for me, what that meant was that the front end started sliding out.

09:37.800 --> 09:39.080
And this is a pretty tight corner.

09:39.080 --> 09:44.800
So thankfully I, you know, as a kid drove a bunch of machinery and very sketchy forest

09:44.800 --> 09:45.800
areas.

09:45.800 --> 09:47.900
So you kind of have a sense of what to do in these situations.

09:47.900 --> 09:54.520
So I ended up sort of starting to skid sideways down the road around this curve.

09:54.520 --> 09:56.040
It was you drifted the corner.

09:56.040 --> 09:57.080
I needed a drone.

09:57.080 --> 10:00.600
It would have been an amazing thing.

10:00.600 --> 10:06.920
And so, you know, my like all the alarm bells are going off like this isn't good.

10:06.920 --> 10:13.200
And thankfully I just kind of slid a little bit and, and my front end, which I think you

10:13.200 --> 10:19.240
noticed this morning, my front end just kissed the mountain, like the, the smallest kiss

10:19.240 --> 10:22.360
to the actual mountain face that I was going.

10:22.360 --> 10:23.360
That's what that's from.

10:23.360 --> 10:24.360
That's recent.

10:24.360 --> 10:25.360
That's that I did see it.

10:25.360 --> 10:26.360
Yeah.

10:26.360 --> 10:27.360
It's a few hours old.

10:27.360 --> 10:28.360
Wow.

10:28.360 --> 10:31.360
And I just to say caught my license plate on the front because we have license plates

10:31.360 --> 10:33.000
on the front and it, it got pretty mangled.

10:33.000 --> 10:35.640
I fixed it before coming here.

10:35.640 --> 10:39.960
But also just kissed the fender on the front.

10:39.960 --> 10:44.600
And I have it tied together with a few zip ties that I happen to have in the front seat.

10:44.600 --> 10:47.160
But I love that you didn't say anything about this.

10:47.160 --> 10:51.840
You haven't said a word about it because I thought it was amazing, dude.

10:51.840 --> 10:52.840
It's the podcasters dilemma.

10:52.840 --> 10:53.840
Right?

10:53.840 --> 10:54.840
Do you say anything?

10:54.840 --> 10:55.840
Or do you record?

10:55.840 --> 10:56.840
Wow.

10:56.840 --> 10:57.840
So like, okay.

10:57.840 --> 11:00.480
So you, you like, how much of that jolt did you feel like when you, when you kissed it?

11:00.480 --> 11:01.480
Like how much did you feel?

11:01.480 --> 11:03.320
It was honestly pretty subtle.

11:03.320 --> 11:07.640
I knew I was, did you know there was damage when you, well, I felt like the slightest

11:07.640 --> 11:11.760
little bump, like, like almost like you're parking your car at the grocery store and

11:11.760 --> 11:16.120
you just to say, nudge the, you know, just the smallest little thing.

11:16.120 --> 11:18.600
And I thought, I know cars, they're so sensitive.

11:18.600 --> 11:20.620
You touch anything, they just fall apart.

11:20.620 --> 11:24.000
So I knew there was something, but the worst part was not the sliding.

11:24.000 --> 11:25.640
I'm fine with that.

11:25.640 --> 11:30.920
The worst part was then I was stopped in the middle of the road, oh geez, perpendicular

11:30.920 --> 11:37.400
to the road with my nose against a mountain face and a, you know, to my right, which is

11:37.400 --> 11:38.400
up the hill.

11:38.400 --> 11:39.880
I just came from, it's a total blind corner.

11:39.880 --> 11:45.520
So anyone coming down there would never, ever, ever expect a car to be where I was.

11:45.520 --> 11:47.880
So then I was like, okay, now's the time to perform.

11:47.880 --> 11:48.880
I got to get out of this.

11:48.880 --> 11:49.880
Right?

11:49.880 --> 11:50.880
Right.

11:50.880 --> 11:54.680
So thankfully I was able, I had to do actually a, like a double, um, three point turn.

11:54.680 --> 11:56.520
I had to go front, back, front, back.

11:56.520 --> 11:58.480
It was Austin Powers thing.

11:58.480 --> 11:59.960
The worst thing to do in the middle of the night.

11:59.960 --> 12:01.680
I think I can almost picture where you're at.

12:01.680 --> 12:04.000
So you were coming down probably the last pass.

12:04.000 --> 12:05.000
Is this your last?

12:05.000 --> 12:06.600
Yeah, I think it was on highway 20.

12:06.600 --> 12:07.600
Yeah.

12:07.600 --> 12:08.600
Those are some tight corners.

12:08.600 --> 12:11.880
That one is just the one caught me, you know, the rest were totally great.

12:11.880 --> 12:14.920
Can you believe I took the RV through there a few times?

12:14.920 --> 12:18.240
I think if, if you're going super slow, it's like actually great.

12:18.240 --> 12:19.240
Yeah.

12:19.240 --> 12:20.240
You got to really go slow.

12:20.240 --> 12:23.000
But when you're, when you're 25,000 pounds going really slow is hard.

12:23.000 --> 12:26.400
And I think, I don't think I took the rain into account.

12:26.400 --> 12:27.400
Right.

12:27.400 --> 12:28.400
To be honest.

12:28.400 --> 12:29.400
Right.

12:29.400 --> 12:30.400
It was a lot worse.

12:30.400 --> 12:31.400
Yeah.

12:31.400 --> 12:32.400
Yeah.

12:32.400 --> 12:34.600
So I got out of there and there were actually no cars around and there weren't for most

12:34.600 --> 12:35.600
of the trip.

12:35.600 --> 12:36.600
That's actually fine.

12:36.600 --> 12:37.600
But yeah.

12:37.600 --> 12:39.960
Um, any other route and there would have been a steady stream of vehicles.

12:39.960 --> 12:40.960
Yeah.

12:40.960 --> 12:41.960
Yeah.

12:41.960 --> 12:44.760
So it turned out to be fine, but it had my, uh, blood pump in there for a second, but

12:44.760 --> 12:46.240
that kept you awake for a little bit longer.

12:46.240 --> 12:47.240
Right.

12:47.240 --> 12:48.240
That's why I was awake.

12:48.240 --> 12:49.240
That worked.

12:49.240 --> 12:50.240
Do that next time.

12:50.240 --> 12:51.240
Wow.

12:51.240 --> 12:54.120
So we'll have to do a few little repairs on my, uh, my front end there.

12:54.120 --> 12:56.480
I'm not sure if there's cell signal in that spot either.

12:56.480 --> 12:57.480
No, no.

12:57.480 --> 12:58.480
Oh no.

12:58.480 --> 13:02.320
So thankfully I was able to, um, get turned around, go down the road a little bit more

13:02.320 --> 13:04.760
and like a few hundred feet, there was a little turnoff.

13:04.760 --> 13:10.120
So I turned off immediately there and, uh, just, you know, let things cool out down in

13:10.120 --> 13:12.960
my own body, but also just take a look.

13:12.960 --> 13:17.540
And, uh, first thing I was like, oh yeah, no cell signal, no buddy around really.

13:17.540 --> 13:21.120
And that's what I was thinking about is like, okay, well if something actually does happen

13:21.120 --> 13:27.440
up here, especially if the only car that you see just crashed into you, then, then,

13:27.440 --> 13:31.800
you know, you know, you mentioned how these roads were built a long time ago and it made

13:31.800 --> 13:35.080
me think how crazy was it and building those roads.

13:35.080 --> 13:36.080
Many men died.

13:36.080 --> 13:37.080
Oh, I know.

13:37.080 --> 13:38.080
It's insane.

13:38.080 --> 13:40.180
That outlook I'd like to take you to, I was telling you about tells you, they have a few

13:40.180 --> 13:42.360
plaques there that tell you about some of the sacrifices.

13:42.360 --> 13:43.360
Oh man.

13:43.360 --> 13:44.360
It's insane.

13:44.360 --> 13:45.360
Yeah.

13:45.360 --> 13:46.360
And we just take it for granted.

13:46.360 --> 13:47.360
Yeah.

13:47.360 --> 13:48.360
It really is something.

13:48.360 --> 13:49.360
And they didn't have geared nearly as good as we have now.

13:49.360 --> 13:50.360
Right.

13:50.360 --> 13:54.120
So, all right, well we've got a few things I want to get into, including some JB updates

13:54.120 --> 13:58.920
and website updates, but also some podcasting news and Gene Bean actually kicks it off with

13:58.920 --> 14:12.240
our baller boost this week with 30,000 sats.

14:12.240 --> 14:17.540
So he says, I just saw that Albee has released Saturn and I couldn't think of a better way

14:17.540 --> 14:19.560
to let you know about it other than a boost.

14:19.560 --> 14:20.560
He's right about that.

14:20.560 --> 14:21.940
I curious what you think of it.

14:21.940 --> 14:26.160
By the way, Gene Bean on Fountain, but sometimes it uses my Twitter handle.

14:26.160 --> 14:27.160
No worries, Gene Bean.

14:27.160 --> 14:28.200
We got you.

14:28.200 --> 14:32.920
So Albee is a web lightning wallet.

14:32.920 --> 14:39.480
It's something that's been sort of on my radar for a while and then the last few weeks I've

14:39.480 --> 14:41.800
ended up having a conversation with one of the co-founders.

14:41.800 --> 14:43.240
I've set up an Albee wallet.

14:43.240 --> 14:47.180
I'm actually really impressed with it and I typically am super skeptical of anything

14:47.180 --> 14:51.620
that touches the web browser, but Albee does a couple of things like it lets you use your

14:51.620 --> 14:54.800
own node, you know, let you use your own seed phrase and encryption.

14:54.800 --> 14:58.860
It does a couple of things that I think are really smart and I think for lightning payments

14:58.860 --> 15:03.440
to really take off, you probably need some kind of web integration and Albee is a really

15:03.440 --> 15:05.040
solid project.

15:05.040 --> 15:09.480
They've been also working with the Podverse crew to get boosting working on Podverse mobile

15:09.480 --> 15:15.200
and now they've introduced Saturn and it's sat earn, get it?

15:15.200 --> 15:19.080
It's a value for value platform for podcasters.

15:19.080 --> 15:23.300
It's kind of like what you get when you set up Umbral and Helipad where we get all the

15:23.300 --> 15:25.000
boosts and stuff.

15:25.000 --> 15:28.560
They're building that for any podcaster who doesn't necessarily want to set all that up.

15:28.560 --> 15:29.560
That is really cool.

15:29.560 --> 15:31.360
It's very cool, Brent.

15:31.360 --> 15:35.460
They have a dashboard now that shows you who's boosting in, number of boosts that you've

15:35.460 --> 15:40.240
got, but they also, look at this, are giving you metrics.

15:40.240 --> 15:44.800
So they're generating metrics on the fly to show you like your boost performance, episode

15:44.800 --> 15:49.640
releases in correlation to metrics, boost to gram revenues, all that kind of stuff to

15:49.640 --> 15:52.120
just give people a dashboard to receive these.

15:52.120 --> 15:54.120
Now I actually have no intention of using this, right?

15:54.120 --> 15:57.280
Because like we're not trying to generate a big, big set of business revenues from anything

15:57.280 --> 15:59.840
like this and Helipad is really great for what we use.

15:59.840 --> 16:01.400
I love Helipad.

16:01.400 --> 16:06.040
It's a tool built by Dave Jones, the pod sage of podcasting 2.0.

16:06.040 --> 16:10.960
It takes the messages on lightning payments and it displays them in a nice UI, categorizes

16:10.960 --> 16:13.360
them by show and episode number.

16:13.360 --> 16:19.000
So it enables like a CVS file export, but the cool thing is it's a Rust app with an

16:19.000 --> 16:20.480
actual like database back end.

16:20.480 --> 16:21.480
It's a what?

16:21.480 --> 16:22.480
It's a Rust app.

16:22.480 --> 16:23.480
Yeah.

16:23.480 --> 16:24.480
What did you say?

16:24.480 --> 16:25.480
All right, fine.

16:25.480 --> 16:26.480
Fine.

16:26.480 --> 16:27.480
Hey.

16:27.480 --> 16:28.480
Yeah.

16:28.480 --> 16:29.480
Are you happy now?

16:29.480 --> 16:31.320
I do it for the people.

16:31.320 --> 16:32.800
And you know, it has an API and all that.

16:32.800 --> 16:37.320
So we're actually very happy with Helipad and our own homespun solution.

16:37.320 --> 16:41.360
But if you were getting into podcasting or if you had a podcast and you weren't really

16:41.360 --> 16:44.880
interested in hosting all the stuff yourself.

16:44.880 --> 16:47.740
Or you just want a different UI on top of it, I suppose.

16:47.740 --> 16:48.800
This is a great system.

16:48.800 --> 16:51.640
And what's cool about this is we could use this.

16:51.640 --> 16:56.400
We could just add this destination as one of our splits, like, you know, a tiny split,

16:56.400 --> 17:01.180
like a five sat split or something, six, 10, so it's clear, you know, a five sat split.

17:01.180 --> 17:05.280
And then we would send a copy of all the messages in here and the team could log in and read

17:05.280 --> 17:06.280
the messages that way.

17:06.280 --> 17:09.520
Aren't you curious to just give it a spin just to see?

17:09.520 --> 17:10.520
I kind of am.

17:10.520 --> 17:15.320
I kind of am, but I really like our current workflow as well.

17:15.320 --> 17:20.360
Well, and I think our workflow, what's it been, like eight months now?

17:20.360 --> 17:21.360
Yeah.

17:21.360 --> 17:25.720
I think has informed a lot of the decisions and the learning that we've done.

17:25.720 --> 17:28.880
Like having to build it from the ground up like that has been really fascinating and

17:28.880 --> 17:29.880
very educational.

17:29.880 --> 17:30.880
Yeah.

17:30.880 --> 17:31.880
And I like the self-hosting aspect.

17:31.880 --> 17:32.880
Yeah, absolutely.

17:32.880 --> 17:35.720
But the Albie team seems really solid.

17:35.720 --> 17:40.480
They're making open source stuff over there and they're working with other projects.

17:40.480 --> 17:46.640
They're kind of filling the market gap to make some of the aspects of podcasting 2.0

17:46.640 --> 17:48.620
a little more turnkey for other podcasters.

17:48.620 --> 17:49.620
That's a great service.

17:49.620 --> 17:56.360
It really is because the other pressure here is, you know, you got your Spotify's, but

17:56.360 --> 17:58.500
you also just have your micro ad platforms.

17:58.500 --> 18:00.440
This is a new thing they're doing, micro ads.

18:00.440 --> 18:04.900
You enter your podcast into a database and you put some attributes in there about your

18:04.900 --> 18:11.040
audience like average size, where they work, average age, like they'll give you tools to

18:11.040 --> 18:13.160
survey your audience if you don't know that information.

18:13.160 --> 18:16.880
So you can ask everybody to go take a survey and then give them all that information and

18:16.880 --> 18:22.240
then you plug all that in there and you tell it like keywords about what you talk about

18:22.240 --> 18:27.520
and then they have another side of the system that advertisers log into and then they filter

18:27.520 --> 18:31.800
on those attributes and then they select a bunch of podcasts that just check, check,

18:31.800 --> 18:36.720
check and then they say run campaign and then on the back end, the podcasters get an email

18:36.720 --> 18:40.480
that says, okay, podcaster, you've got a campaign for this, some product you've never heard

18:40.480 --> 18:45.080
of for some company you know nothing about, you know, no idea, no idea if it's a scam

18:45.080 --> 18:49.040
and that's how a ton of this scam stuff gets, gets around is nobody really knows anything

18:49.040 --> 18:50.440
about the companies they're doing deals with.

18:50.440 --> 18:52.360
No one's doing research on the product.

18:52.360 --> 18:53.360
Yeah.

18:53.360 --> 18:54.360
Have they necessarily ever seen it?

18:54.360 --> 18:55.360
Right.

18:55.360 --> 18:56.360
And they're making it easier and easier.

18:56.360 --> 18:58.240
You just go put your information in there and then you just end up with an email and

18:58.240 --> 19:02.560
they're, they tell you, do the ads, you agree to it and then you get paid and that stuff

19:02.560 --> 19:07.680
sucks because they're like for stupid crap, they're for dumb services and just all kinds

19:07.680 --> 19:08.680
of stupid stuff.

19:08.680 --> 19:12.920
Um, I, uh, here, I'll get you, here's, here's an example actually, I was going to save this

19:12.920 --> 19:18.560
for Coder, but, uh, I do actually have, um, I do have a current example.

19:18.560 --> 19:20.080
Let's see if I go over here.

19:20.080 --> 19:21.080
I saved it.

19:21.080 --> 19:22.960
Yeah, here we go.

19:22.960 --> 19:25.720
So Dennis wrote in just, this is the email.

19:25.720 --> 19:29.800
Can you give me a quote on your best reseller prices for the following, please?

19:29.800 --> 19:35.240
I'd like your regular guest posts, non gambling, and I'd like a price for your gambling guest

19:35.240 --> 19:36.240
posts.

19:36.240 --> 19:37.240
Looking forward to hearing from you.

19:37.240 --> 19:39.200
Kind regards, Dennis.

19:39.200 --> 19:43.240
Now you could just reply here to Dennis and say, yeah, here's our price and Dennis could

19:43.240 --> 19:44.240
choose to buy it.

19:44.240 --> 19:49.720
And then we're supposed to just run a low key like segment on gambling.

19:49.720 --> 19:50.720
Uh, I don't know.

19:50.720 --> 19:54.120
It's just so funny, all these guys, and we get this kind of stuff all the time.

19:54.120 --> 19:55.820
And this, that's not even the automated stuff.

19:55.820 --> 19:59.760
That's just like, you know, somebody's mass mailing shows that they find in iTunes database

19:59.760 --> 20:00.760
and stuff like that.

20:00.760 --> 20:04.360
So yeah, Gene Bean, uh, I'm very excited about Saturn from Albee.

20:04.360 --> 20:08.400
I think it's going to be a great stepping stone for folks that are trying to get a boost

20:08.400 --> 20:11.720
enabled on their show and they don't necessarily know about all the infrastructure and they

20:11.720 --> 20:13.080
don't know about the helipad app.

20:13.080 --> 20:15.680
And, uh, Albee seems like a really solid team.

20:15.680 --> 20:17.080
I like what they're doing over there too.

20:17.080 --> 20:21.080
So I have good faith that they're going to do right.

20:21.080 --> 20:23.520
And I think they're really investing in podcasting 2.0.

20:23.520 --> 20:28.000
It's neat to see like even from week to week, I guess two weeks from fortnight to fortnight

20:28.000 --> 20:32.280
when we do this show, how things are evolving in that time every couple of weeks.

20:32.280 --> 20:33.280
And I'm only handpicking.

20:33.280 --> 20:34.280
Yeah.

20:34.280 --> 20:35.280
Right.

20:35.280 --> 20:37.840
Like there's several stories I'm just leaving on the table because you know, there's, there's

20:37.840 --> 20:39.600
other outlets that are covering podcasting news.

20:39.600 --> 20:42.720
I just want to cover, I'm covering the stuff here that I want the JV audience to be aware

20:42.720 --> 20:43.720
of.

20:43.720 --> 20:46.800
Um, but pod news.net is another one if you're interested.

20:46.800 --> 20:50.280
And then I think the podcasting 2.0 show, if you're interested in this stuff is, is

20:50.280 --> 20:52.040
a must listen.

20:52.040 --> 20:57.120
So Brent, let's do a little reflection on, uh, your matrix adoption, because I think

20:57.120 --> 21:03.280
when we started this show, you were kind of like matrix and you're using matrix, which

21:03.280 --> 21:07.520
we use for our live chat right now, people are suggesting titles as we go along.

21:07.520 --> 21:11.040
But now, you know, after this website project, I feel like you're on a whole, you have a

21:11.040 --> 21:12.040
whole other perspective.

21:12.040 --> 21:13.040
Yeah.

21:13.040 --> 21:14.040
You've caught me in that one.

21:14.040 --> 21:20.680
I, uh, I was a little skeptical at first and I think, you know why it's because the user

21:20.680 --> 21:24.800
interfaces were really kind of rough, even just several months ago.

21:24.800 --> 21:25.800
Yeah.

21:25.800 --> 21:32.160
And I was like, oh man, if this is the situation we're, um, suggesting that our audience subscribed

21:32.160 --> 21:34.360
to, I don't like that idea at all.

21:34.360 --> 21:39.100
So I was skeptical is a nice way to put it to the point where I actually uninstalled

21:39.100 --> 21:40.960
it for myself for a few months.

21:40.960 --> 21:44.800
Um, you convinced me to grab it up again, thankfully, while you didn't give me much

21:44.800 --> 21:47.960
choice with the show, I think is really what happened.

21:47.960 --> 21:53.480
But even then, like to, to go on that concept again and in those few months, I'd say, you

21:53.480 --> 21:57.340
know, element primarily that I've been using, uh, I've tried a few others, but that one

21:57.340 --> 21:59.760
has seen a lot of, uh, work.

21:59.760 --> 22:04.360
I I've of course, as you might expect, put in a few bug reports on element, which is,

22:04.360 --> 22:07.980
and the team responded really quickly, which is great, but it's been lovely.

22:07.980 --> 22:11.200
And I've seen the JB adoption be really good as well.

22:11.200 --> 22:13.400
And I have loved many aspects of it.

22:13.400 --> 22:19.040
I want to go into detail, but the JB website room specifically, which I spend, I'll say

22:19.040 --> 22:25.480
probably like 80% of my time in cause the people there are great, has seen a crazy amount

22:25.480 --> 22:27.520
of people in it for the project that we're doing.

22:27.520 --> 22:29.440
I thought, yeah, it started slow.

22:29.440 --> 22:35.400
We were like, you know, 10 people or so now I think we're up to almost a hundred and uh,

22:35.400 --> 22:41.960
every now and then I stop and think, Oh, well it feels like a tiny little like room of just

22:41.960 --> 22:45.840
a bunch of friends working in here and it's great, but actually there's a hundred friends

22:45.840 --> 22:46.840
had sitting in this room.

22:46.840 --> 22:47.840
It's really cool.

22:47.840 --> 22:51.600
So thank you for everyone who's been interested in the website, you know, even if you're just

22:51.600 --> 22:56.000
in there just to sort of hear what's happening and not necessarily contribute.

22:56.000 --> 22:59.960
I think that's still worthwhile, but, um, I've seen a huge massive uptake in the number

22:59.960 --> 23:01.880
of people contributing recently as well.

23:01.880 --> 23:04.600
So, uh, that's been really, really amazing.

23:04.600 --> 23:11.880
I feel like at the beginning of 2022, we were still, all of us as a team were like, uh,

23:11.880 --> 23:13.160
was this a good idea?

23:13.160 --> 23:14.880
Oh, this is a lot of work.

23:14.880 --> 23:16.840
I'm not sure this is a good idea.

23:16.840 --> 23:20.240
And then, you know, more than midway into the year, it's like, Oh boy, I'm sure glad

23:20.240 --> 23:21.520
we made a bet on this platform.

23:21.520 --> 23:23.200
This sure was the right way to go.

23:23.200 --> 23:24.200
It's been really nice.

23:24.200 --> 23:27.560
I like having the West coast crew in there to organize stuff for the West coast meetups.

23:27.560 --> 23:31.040
And then we have, you know, the JB general chat for these events that we're doing and

23:31.040 --> 23:35.240
the Linux unplugged rooms where we're talking about Linux unplug stuff in the Bitcoin chat

23:35.240 --> 23:41.400
room that we've set up is gotta be the best, most level-headed, most respectful, you know,

23:41.400 --> 23:43.440
Bitcoin conversation I've seen anywhere on the internet.

23:43.440 --> 23:49.880
It's just, yeah, it really has been, um, really seems like it's been a good bet.

23:49.880 --> 23:53.680
Like it was like, we, we bet kind of a risky, I feel like we were a little risky when we

23:53.680 --> 23:56.960
bet cause there was big pushback, you know, our buddy Wimpy, you know, pushed really hard

23:56.960 --> 24:00.600
to go with discord and we already have a discord set up and there's still value in it too.

24:00.600 --> 24:06.680
I think you could still argue today, but you know, it's been also a good project for us.

24:06.680 --> 24:10.560
It's been a good project to learn it, you know, implement things and, and really try

24:10.560 --> 24:12.920
out some of these technologies and push the edges.

24:12.920 --> 24:18.480
And uh, we broke things when we deployed the new website during the show last week or two

24:18.480 --> 24:21.880
weeks ago, didn't even know it at the time because everything just seemed fine.

24:21.880 --> 24:25.440
We were using the matrix chat while we're doing the show, you know, everybody voted

24:25.440 --> 24:26.440
on titles.

24:26.440 --> 24:30.680
We were talking to the live stream, it all seemed good after we deployed the website.

24:30.680 --> 24:32.880
Like how could we have broken anything?

24:32.880 --> 24:33.880
Right.

24:33.880 --> 24:38.080
Um, and then the next day I noticed things were really kind of slow, but it was like

24:38.080 --> 24:41.240
the last week of August and there was people chatting.

24:41.240 --> 24:44.400
There was absolutely people chatting in there and I was actively chatting with you and Wes

24:44.400 --> 24:49.760
in there and I thought, no, maybe people are taking, you know, you know, it is new.

24:49.760 --> 24:50.760
It's new.

24:50.760 --> 24:54.240
Maybe people are just down, you know, for the summer doing something and it's not quite

24:54.240 --> 24:55.880
their habit yet to be in here.

24:55.880 --> 24:56.880
Uh, okay.

24:56.880 --> 24:57.880
All right.

24:57.880 --> 24:59.440
I won't worry about it too much.

24:59.440 --> 25:00.440
And I say something to Wes.

25:00.440 --> 25:01.440
I'm like, you think anything's up?

25:01.440 --> 25:05.560
I mean, usually by this point in the day I have several unread messages and I haven't,

25:05.560 --> 25:06.880
I don't have any unread messages right now.

25:06.880 --> 25:07.880
This is really weird.

25:07.880 --> 25:08.880
You get a day off.

25:08.880 --> 25:09.880
Yeah.

25:09.880 --> 25:10.880
Right.

25:10.880 --> 25:11.880
So, okay.

25:11.880 --> 25:12.880
And I kind of think, well, good for everybody.

25:12.880 --> 25:13.880
They're out getting some summertime.

25:13.880 --> 25:14.880
Good.

25:14.880 --> 25:15.880
Well, meanwhile, you're here worrying about it.

25:15.880 --> 25:16.880
Yeah.

25:16.880 --> 25:20.840
The next day, Thursday, cause the show was on a Tuesday, the next day, Thursday, I was

25:20.840 --> 25:24.880
AFK for most of the day because I took an odd day off, which I don't usually, not really

25:24.880 --> 25:31.200
off, but I was driving for a lot of that day looking for furniture for troops and, um,

25:31.200 --> 25:35.240
just didn't, didn't have any chance to spend any time in the element room until the evening

25:35.240 --> 25:38.480
at the matrix room and then I noticed it was slow again, okay.

25:38.480 --> 25:42.680
Next morning though, Friday morning, I'm back at the work, I've been in the office early

25:42.680 --> 25:46.560
and now I, by Friday I've expected to hear from several people and they haven't gotten

25:46.560 --> 25:47.560
back to me.

25:47.560 --> 25:48.560
I'm like, that's weird.

25:48.560 --> 25:52.360
And they're all, and like some of the chat rooms have just been dead quiet.

25:52.360 --> 25:53.360
Nothing said.

25:53.360 --> 25:56.080
And I'm like, that doesn't seem right.

25:56.080 --> 26:02.020
We've had an episode come out, the website's gone live, something's definitely wrong here.

26:02.020 --> 26:05.400
Chatting was obvious because there were people in there chatting, but they were members of

26:05.400 --> 26:06.400
that server.

26:06.400 --> 26:07.400
Jupiter broadcasting.com server.

26:07.400 --> 26:08.400
Oh, I see.

26:08.400 --> 26:13.760
So people who were native to that server were chatting away just fine, but anybody that

26:13.760 --> 26:18.280
came from a home server or a, maybe their matrix.org account, anybody that connected

26:18.280 --> 26:23.560
via the federation wasn't there, but there was no air message and there's nothing obvious

26:23.560 --> 26:25.720
about it.

26:25.720 --> 26:30.480
And it wasn't until I decided to go create a brand new from scratch matrix.org account

26:30.480 --> 26:33.280
and then try to connect in to the Jupiter broadcasting server.

26:33.280 --> 26:34.280
That's what you had to do.

26:34.280 --> 26:35.280
Yeah.

26:35.280 --> 26:36.880
Where I realized that direction isn't working.

26:36.880 --> 26:41.480
Like I can go from the server, I can go out, but you couldn't get into the server.

26:41.480 --> 26:44.440
And then from there, Wes and I started troubleshooting it.

26:44.440 --> 26:49.180
Wes pretty quickly figured out, oh yeah, we had an identity file on the old website because

26:49.180 --> 26:55.000
we use the Jupiter broadcasting.com domain and not the colony.Jupiterbroadcasting.com.

26:55.000 --> 26:56.440
And so we had to have this file up there.

26:56.440 --> 26:59.820
And then it was a matter of figuring out like, well, how do we do this now, right?

26:59.820 --> 27:07.000
Because in the old days I would SFTP up to the server, copy the files and I'd be done.

27:07.000 --> 27:10.200
And it would be like Wes and I would have known it happened.

27:10.200 --> 27:14.200
There'd be no trace, there'd be no log, there'd be nothing.

27:14.200 --> 27:15.200
Memory only.

27:15.200 --> 27:16.200
Yeah.

27:16.200 --> 27:20.080
But that's not how it works now.

27:20.080 --> 27:25.400
So I'm like, okay, so first thing I got to go do is I got to go create a GitHub issue

27:25.400 --> 27:26.400
identifying the problem.

27:26.400 --> 27:29.760
So I got to document what the issue is and try to describe it best I can.

27:29.760 --> 27:34.480
So I do that and then Wes jumps in with what he knows and then we had a fix pretty quickly

27:34.480 --> 27:37.560
and then I'm deploying and he uploads that fix.

27:37.560 --> 27:39.120
I'm deploying that fix from GitHub.

27:39.120 --> 27:44.020
It rebuilds the website and a few minutes later everything was working on Matrix again.

27:44.020 --> 27:47.740
But the new website did manage to break our Matrix Federation for a little bit.

27:47.740 --> 27:51.700
And then it started reconnecting and people just started coming back online.

27:51.700 --> 27:53.360
They had been chatting along all along.

27:53.360 --> 27:55.400
It was like a fork almost.

27:55.400 --> 27:56.400
Yeah.

27:56.400 --> 28:00.560
It was an IRC fork or a split or whatever they call it.

28:00.560 --> 28:01.560
A net split.

28:01.560 --> 28:05.560
But yeah, they just thought we were like not responding and we just thought they weren't

28:05.560 --> 28:06.560
showing up.

28:06.560 --> 28:08.560
They were like, oh, must be the end of the summer.

28:08.560 --> 28:11.980
They're all still talking to each other because all their Federation connections are working

28:11.980 --> 28:12.980
just fine.

28:12.980 --> 28:14.600
So they're all just talking along.

28:14.600 --> 28:19.240
And then I show up like three days later and they're like, oh, nice of you to show up.

28:19.240 --> 28:20.240
Right.

28:20.240 --> 28:21.940
That's funny.

28:21.940 --> 28:28.320
But before we fixed it, I'm like, oh, crap, you know what we've just done?

28:28.320 --> 28:30.340
And Wes is like, what?

28:30.340 --> 28:35.120
We have just missed the best window in the history of this server to do maintenance and

28:35.120 --> 28:36.120
upgrades.

28:36.120 --> 28:37.120
It's true.

28:37.120 --> 28:38.120
Right.

28:38.120 --> 28:42.760
So right before we fixed it, we did a bunch of like updates and stuff like that to bring

28:42.760 --> 28:44.000
it all up to date.

28:44.000 --> 28:46.160
So did you document that somewhere?

28:46.160 --> 28:47.160
Oh, yeah.

28:47.160 --> 28:48.160
Totally.

28:48.160 --> 28:49.160
Totally.

28:49.160 --> 28:51.000
And so, well, I have some questions there.

28:51.000 --> 28:53.880
So in the end, how was the process to fix this?

28:53.880 --> 28:56.480
Because you had to basically upload a file sort of.

28:56.480 --> 28:57.480
Yeah.

28:57.480 --> 28:58.480
Yeah.

28:58.480 --> 28:59.480
Yeah.

28:59.480 --> 29:00.480
And Wes figured that out where it needed to live and all of that.

29:00.480 --> 29:06.600
That actually, you know, I like I like the self documenting aspect of it.

29:06.600 --> 29:11.000
Like if you go dig around on our GitHub, you could find that entire threat and see what

29:11.000 --> 29:12.000
happened.

29:12.000 --> 29:16.800
I think that's fascinating and valuable for an organization like ours.

29:16.800 --> 29:17.880
So it's better overall.

29:17.880 --> 29:21.440
It is it is a slower process.

29:21.440 --> 29:22.440
In some ways.

29:22.440 --> 29:23.440
Right.

29:23.440 --> 29:24.440
I guess.

29:24.440 --> 29:26.560
But then again, it's kind of hard to say when you're building a website.

29:26.560 --> 29:33.400
I think it's slower in the sense that you that day, it was slower for you to solve the

29:33.400 --> 29:34.400
immediate issue.

29:34.400 --> 29:35.400
Yeah.

29:35.400 --> 29:39.200
I mean, I'm still like I could have probably just explained less in the GitHub issue, you

29:39.200 --> 29:41.560
know, and I could have just kept it really short, I suppose.

29:41.560 --> 29:42.560
And that would have been quicker.

29:42.560 --> 29:45.880
But I wrote it out in case anybody had some other ideas.

29:45.880 --> 29:46.880
And there was some discussion.

29:46.880 --> 29:49.840
So it did it did result in some interesting discussion.

29:49.840 --> 29:54.160
But the same I think it probably would take me about the same time to go to GitHub, create

29:54.160 --> 29:57.880
the issue, write out a little bit about it, tag people or whatever.

29:57.880 --> 30:01.360
That's probably about the same amount of time would take me to SFTP a file up to the server.

30:01.360 --> 30:03.000
And I'd be fixed at that point.

30:03.000 --> 30:04.000
Right.

30:04.000 --> 30:09.220
But that is the old, you know, dynamically generated website.

30:09.220 --> 30:12.560
This is a new static generated statically generated website.

30:12.560 --> 30:16.220
And so you need to like put it earlier in the process.

30:16.220 --> 30:17.260
So it's kind of like the best.

30:17.260 --> 30:18.260
There's not really.

30:18.260 --> 30:21.520
I mean, I could have built it locally and uploaded files, I suppose, to a server.

30:21.520 --> 30:24.680
But it doesn't seem like a better process.

30:24.680 --> 30:26.440
It just seems like a different process.

30:26.440 --> 30:30.200
Well, I think I'll argue that I think it's a better process.

30:30.200 --> 30:31.200
Yeah.

30:31.200 --> 30:32.200
I think ultimately it will be.

30:32.200 --> 30:33.200
Yeah.

30:33.200 --> 30:34.200
Yeah.

30:34.200 --> 30:35.200
For that kind of fix, I'm not positive.

30:35.200 --> 30:37.580
But generally, in all other aspects, yes, I'm positive.

30:37.580 --> 30:38.580
It's yeah.

30:38.580 --> 30:39.580
Yeah.

30:39.580 --> 30:40.580
I'm positive.

30:40.580 --> 30:41.580
It's a good thing.

30:41.580 --> 30:42.580
Yeah.

30:42.580 --> 30:43.580
Because you get documentation.

30:43.580 --> 30:44.580
Well, yeah, you get documentation.

30:44.580 --> 30:50.200
And after well, OK, so my story is I spent two full days working exclusively on the website

30:50.200 --> 30:53.680
and staying up far too late doing so and really enjoying myself.

30:53.680 --> 30:56.840
So I think it was like the four in the morning or something.

30:56.840 --> 30:57.840
Oh, wow.

30:57.840 --> 30:58.840
Yeah.

30:58.840 --> 31:01.440
And I was like, geez, it's really quiet in the matrix room, right?

31:01.440 --> 31:02.920
Because everything's fine.

31:02.920 --> 31:03.920
Nothing's broken.

31:03.920 --> 31:05.280
That's it.

31:05.280 --> 31:09.300
So I woke up that third day and I was able to just read everything that you and Wes

31:09.300 --> 31:10.300
had done.

31:10.300 --> 31:13.940
And I was fully caught up, which was great from that perspective.

31:13.940 --> 31:19.480
But also, from the conversations that happened there, Elroy created a new end-to-end test

31:19.480 --> 31:23.120
that checks that that matrix federation file exists.

31:23.120 --> 31:27.480
So in the future, we will know pretty immediately when that's a problem.

31:27.480 --> 31:31.400
Now there's a small issue with that test that we have to figure out that I think we'll get

31:31.400 --> 31:32.400
there.

31:32.400 --> 31:33.400
So it's not quite functional yet.

31:33.400 --> 31:36.960
But I mean, that's, I think, some positivity that you get out of that process.

31:36.960 --> 31:41.520
So you have to put a little bit more in, but you get these benefits that otherwise you

31:41.520 --> 31:42.520
wouldn't get.

31:42.520 --> 31:43.520
Yeah.

31:43.520 --> 31:45.400
And that's what I mean, streamlined communication.

31:45.400 --> 31:50.800
Because you came online after the issue was fixed.

31:50.800 --> 31:53.800
But when you came online, you probably saw the messages saying, heads up, something's

31:53.800 --> 31:54.800
broken.

31:54.800 --> 31:59.560
So you come online, what you know immediately is, oh, something's broken.

31:59.560 --> 32:03.240
But then you go to the GitHub issue and you know immediately, oh, it's already been resolved.

32:03.240 --> 32:05.120
And you see the whole story.

32:05.120 --> 32:09.000
It certainly kept me from reaching out to you in real time, interrupting whatever work

32:09.000 --> 32:13.280
you were working on at the time that I was starting to get caught up in my day and such.

32:13.280 --> 32:16.240
So I think there are benefits that maybe are hard to see.

32:16.240 --> 32:17.240
Yeah.

32:17.240 --> 32:18.240
Yeah.

32:18.240 --> 32:23.900
It is a transition from one or two people managing something to a team of people.

32:23.900 --> 32:29.440
And then, like you said, you get Elry's experience or oversight where he said, oh, I could modify

32:29.440 --> 32:32.440
this so we actually will do a unit test for that and make sure we actually check to see

32:32.440 --> 32:34.360
that file there so we never blow that away again.

32:34.360 --> 32:39.040
Yeah, that kind of stuff, which a lot of us would never think of just because once we

32:39.040 --> 32:40.560
have a fix, we're on to the next thing.

32:40.560 --> 32:45.480
Yeah, what I've really appreciated from everyone who's been contributing is we all have different

32:45.480 --> 32:47.320
specialties and different perspectives.

32:47.320 --> 32:53.200
And so when a problem shows up, there's this hive mind of, oh, I'll fix this little part

32:53.200 --> 32:54.200
of it.

32:54.200 --> 32:55.200
And I'll fix this other part of it.

32:55.200 --> 32:58.360
And then all of a sudden, you have a better solution than any one person could come up

32:58.360 --> 32:59.360
with.

32:59.360 --> 33:00.360
It's really great.

33:00.360 --> 33:01.800
We should talk more about some website updates in a moment.

33:01.800 --> 33:07.720
I wanted to say before we completely move off of Matrix, we are thinking a lot about

33:07.720 --> 33:09.320
a member Matrix Room.

33:09.320 --> 33:13.960
So if you're a member of any of the shows or Jupiter Party, we are talking as a team

33:13.960 --> 33:17.760
like the best way to facilitate essentially like your own bat line, kind of like the

33:17.760 --> 33:23.160
Boos are, but just sort of as a feedback mechanism.

33:23.160 --> 33:27.680
And we are kind of having the conversation right now of just how clever do we want to

33:27.680 --> 33:28.680
be, right?

33:28.680 --> 33:33.080
Because obviously, we could do something as simple as email the members a link.

33:33.080 --> 33:38.520
Or we could do something as clever as integrate with the API of our service provider and,

33:38.520 --> 33:40.920
you know, authenticate and do it all in the back.

33:40.920 --> 33:42.240
Like we're just trying to figure all that out.

33:42.240 --> 33:46.840
So it'll probably be a post trip thing, along with the RSS feeds that we're going to start

33:46.840 --> 33:47.840
taking over.

33:47.840 --> 33:52.480
And in fact, you know, we've had some platform issues with the Fireside, our hosting provider.

33:52.480 --> 33:55.380
Every hosting provider has issues from time to time.

33:55.380 --> 34:01.560
So you have to take that into account, you know, if we moved it over all to Linode, could

34:01.560 --> 34:02.560
Linode have an outage?

34:02.560 --> 34:03.900
It's possible, right?

34:03.900 --> 34:05.680
So would it be much better?

34:05.680 --> 34:11.280
I think maybe, like this issue we had this week was the members version of CoderRadio

34:11.280 --> 34:20.000
went out two days late because the episode got uploaded and set to go public, but it

34:20.000 --> 34:24.620
just like was in like this infinite processing loop on their end.

34:24.620 --> 34:28.920
And they didn't have like a timeout that says like, you know, after 15 minutes, maybe check

34:28.920 --> 34:32.700
to see if this file is still encoding or whatever.

34:32.700 --> 34:36.700
And although they don't encode it, we do, but they just process it, whatever that means.

34:36.700 --> 34:38.520
And maybe it means copying it out to the CDM.

34:38.520 --> 34:40.800
No, it's to make those great waveforms they have.

34:40.800 --> 34:43.040
Yeah, that never changed.

34:43.040 --> 34:44.040
And it just got stuck there.

34:44.040 --> 34:45.040
Right?

34:45.040 --> 34:46.360
And there's no air mechanism.

34:46.360 --> 34:47.840
There's no alert.

34:47.840 --> 34:50.240
There's no like, nothing gets triggered.

34:50.240 --> 34:52.080
There's no like anything we can hook into.

34:52.080 --> 34:53.080
There's no API.

34:53.080 --> 34:54.080
That's too bad.

34:54.080 --> 34:55.080
Yeah.

34:55.080 --> 34:57.800
So we are, it's like as time goes on, it's like, maybe we just got to build all this

34:57.800 --> 35:02.340
stuff again, even though there's so many platforms to make podcasting easier than ever.

35:02.340 --> 35:08.000
It has in many ways, but I think often because the number, you know, the volume we're putting

35:08.000 --> 35:14.360
out and we do some member versions and stuff and yeah, I think we run into edge cases quite

35:14.360 --> 35:15.360
often.

35:15.360 --> 35:16.360
Yeah.

35:16.360 --> 35:17.360
Yeah.

35:17.360 --> 35:21.160
And a lot of these platforms, right, they're just gonna, they're gonna solve like 80% of

35:21.160 --> 35:22.640
the most common problems.

35:22.640 --> 35:23.640
Yeah.

35:23.640 --> 35:24.640
Yeah.

35:24.640 --> 35:25.640
Yeah.

35:25.640 --> 35:26.640
So we'll see.

35:26.640 --> 35:27.640
Fireside does have a sweet CDN.

35:27.640 --> 35:32.960
I mean, have you noticed how fast those JB podcast download?

35:32.960 --> 35:33.960
So sweet.

35:33.960 --> 35:34.960
Right?

35:34.960 --> 35:35.960
That's so sweet.

35:35.960 --> 35:42.600
So I mean, basically the price we pay for Fireside is cheaper than if I just bought

35:42.600 --> 35:44.880
the CDN access myself.

35:44.880 --> 35:47.800
And with Fireside you get a whole, you know, podcasting platform.

35:47.800 --> 35:51.480
But let's talk about the platforms we have been building.

35:51.480 --> 35:56.480
You know, we've been rolling out our new website and you know where we do it?

35:56.480 --> 35:57.480
On Linode.

35:57.480 --> 35:59.520
We do it over at linode.com slash Jupiter.

35:59.520 --> 36:05.080
You can go there to get an account with a hundred dollars just precharged for 60 days.

36:05.080 --> 36:09.200
Just so awesome because it's a great way to kick the tires and really get an idea what

36:09.200 --> 36:10.200
you can do with it, right?

36:10.200 --> 36:15.160
Like a hundred bucks means you can really find out what the platform's capable of.

36:15.160 --> 36:18.680
That is a vote of confidence on Linode's part that they know you're going to like what you

36:18.680 --> 36:20.320
see when you try it out.

36:20.320 --> 36:22.960
And how flexible has it been for us through this whole process?

36:22.960 --> 36:23.960
Oh yeah.

36:23.960 --> 36:27.360
Multiple team members are working in there, you know, working with infrastructure management

36:27.360 --> 36:28.360
tools.

36:28.360 --> 36:33.840
Like when I did that update on our website to add the matrix identity info, Linode's

36:33.840 --> 36:35.360
just part of that chain.

36:35.360 --> 36:40.860
I make a change on GitHub and then the actions are triggering a build on a Linode box.

36:40.860 --> 36:45.600
And then it's serving up the website and then the cache is reframed.

36:45.600 --> 36:49.960
It's like Linode is just, it's part of the whole orchestration.

36:49.960 --> 36:52.000
It's so great.

36:52.000 --> 36:56.880
And of course the pricing is 30 to 50% cheaper than the major hyperscalers out there that

36:56.880 --> 37:00.920
want to invent their own names for everything and they want to lock you in there and just

37:00.920 --> 37:03.560
keep upselling you all the time.

37:03.560 --> 37:06.360
Linode has a business model that I really like.

37:06.360 --> 37:11.560
It's built on just creating good things and then customers pay for those good things.

37:11.560 --> 37:14.280
And so then they do more of what customers like.

37:14.280 --> 37:15.960
That seems like a good way to go.

37:15.960 --> 37:16.960
That's a crazy business model.

37:16.960 --> 37:17.960
I know, right?

37:17.960 --> 37:21.400
And so it means they're incentivized to do things like invest in their support department,

37:21.400 --> 37:22.400
right?

37:22.400 --> 37:23.800
Which again, the hyperscalers are not.

37:23.800 --> 37:25.520
That's not their business model.

37:25.520 --> 37:28.940
And so Linode's got 24-7, 365 customer support.

37:28.940 --> 37:29.940
Good customer support.

37:29.940 --> 37:33.040
You call up, the person that answers the phone is the person that's going to solve your problem.

37:33.040 --> 37:35.360
You're not going to get transferred around a whole bunch.

37:35.360 --> 37:38.640
They also really make sure they got the sharpest documentation out there and they have great

37:38.640 --> 37:39.640
documentation.

37:39.640 --> 37:45.920
I was talking to a friend recently who's brushing up on Kubernetes for a job, Linode.

37:45.920 --> 37:51.380
They have great docs, great courses, eBooks, they have so many great resources.

37:51.380 --> 37:55.160
And then you combine the fact that they have things like S3 compatible object storage,

37:55.160 --> 38:00.360
cloud firewalls, physical servers if you need it, and a box that's going to meet that performance

38:00.360 --> 38:03.960
to price ratio that exactly hits the sweet spot for you.

38:03.960 --> 38:08.420
Maybe you need something with crazy, crazy fast drives and CPUs, they got it.

38:08.420 --> 38:12.520
Maybe you want to go generate some AI images on their GPUs, they can do it.

38:12.520 --> 38:14.200
Maybe you want to serve up a website.

38:14.200 --> 38:19.380
They have a way to just dial it in just right for you without making it too complicated.

38:19.380 --> 38:20.880
It's the golden ratio over there.

38:20.880 --> 38:21.880
Go try it out.

38:21.880 --> 38:22.880
See what I've been talking about.

38:22.880 --> 38:27.600
And give Linode a thanks for also making our road trip possible.

38:27.600 --> 38:30.040
So go to linode.com slash Jupiter.

38:30.040 --> 38:31.040
Go try them out.

38:31.040 --> 38:32.040
Sign up.

38:32.040 --> 38:33.040
New account.

38:33.040 --> 38:34.040
Get $100.

38:34.040 --> 38:37.320
Linode.com slash Jupiter.

38:37.320 --> 38:39.360
So let's talk about that new website.

38:39.360 --> 38:42.440
A lot is going on over there.

38:42.440 --> 38:45.800
I have a new personal favorite feature, but I'm not sure where you want to start.

38:45.800 --> 38:47.600
Oh, I think we should start there.

38:47.600 --> 38:48.600
Oh, me?

38:48.600 --> 38:49.600
Really?

38:49.600 --> 38:50.600
Well, yeah.

38:50.600 --> 38:52.160
You seem really excited about it.

38:52.160 --> 38:53.160
Okay.

38:53.160 --> 38:56.160
Well, there's a lot of great stuff we got with this new website.

38:56.160 --> 38:58.880
So to say I have one favorite is not quite fair.

38:58.880 --> 39:00.000
It's this week's favorite.

39:00.000 --> 39:02.440
This week's favorite.

39:02.440 --> 39:05.940
I've wanted to do this on the JB website for a decade.

39:05.940 --> 39:10.400
And I've taken a couple of stabs at it over the years using various WordPress plugins.

39:10.400 --> 39:14.820
And it was always a disaster because like not only would the plugins inevitably get

39:14.820 --> 39:20.120
abandoned or one got like turned into adware, but also they were manual.

39:20.120 --> 39:26.280
So like what I always wanted to do was have a banner that comes up on the site, real nice

39:26.280 --> 39:30.160
and tacky, that says, we're live right now.

39:30.160 --> 39:36.320
And if you're at your website, you're at our website, you go over to jupitabroadcasting.com.

39:36.320 --> 39:41.120
It's ironic and sad to me that people could be visiting our website while we were live

39:41.120 --> 39:43.840
and have no idea there's a live production going on.

39:43.840 --> 39:49.040
Somewhere on this website, we're live recording a show right now where you can watch us and

39:49.040 --> 39:52.160
you could go visit our site to get a show and have no idea it's happening.

39:52.160 --> 39:56.280
And so I try these banners, these like red ribbons and like these little things that

39:56.280 --> 39:59.880
show up in the corner to try to, you know, tell people we're live.

39:59.880 --> 40:02.040
I tried these for years on and off.

40:02.040 --> 40:04.480
And of course, I'd always forget to turn them off after the show.

40:04.480 --> 40:07.320
So then I'd like do a show on a Friday and leave it up all weekend.

40:07.320 --> 40:11.120
So it's like midnight on a Saturday and I'd wake up and Chris is working hard.

40:11.120 --> 40:17.560
I wake up in the morning and get like, hey, the stream seems to be down like, oh no.

40:17.560 --> 40:23.200
So what we have now on the new website is so outrageously great.

40:23.200 --> 40:28.080
There is on the top bar, you know, our general links for like the shows, the sponsors, the

40:28.080 --> 40:30.780
calendar and the live page.

40:30.780 --> 40:39.000
And now when we are live, a tasteful little red background around the live link turns

40:39.000 --> 40:40.680
on.

40:40.680 --> 40:44.020
And when we turn the stream off, it turns off.

40:44.020 --> 40:45.020
It's not overbearing.

40:45.020 --> 40:46.480
It's not like some big banner.

40:46.480 --> 40:51.880
It doesn't like reload the UI and shift it down just as you're about to click.

40:51.880 --> 40:56.600
It's just a classy little red square behind the live link.

40:56.600 --> 40:58.160
Yeah, it's super nice.

40:58.160 --> 40:59.760
It's so well done.

40:59.760 --> 41:03.320
And you know, as a team, internally, we've been kicking around an idea like this and

41:03.320 --> 41:05.800
we were like, how would we do it when we came up with the idea?

41:05.800 --> 41:08.800
I don't think did we did anybody ever suggest this approach?

41:08.800 --> 41:10.560
It's so simple and yet so obvious.

41:10.560 --> 41:11.560
That's what I mean.

41:11.560 --> 41:12.560
The hive mind is better.

41:12.560 --> 41:14.180
Yeah, it really is.

41:14.180 --> 41:17.720
And now we have an effing red box behind the live link.

41:17.720 --> 41:21.840
And I know it's a small thing, but when you've wanted something for a decade plus, you know,

41:21.840 --> 41:23.400
it's a pretty big win.

41:23.400 --> 41:26.120
And to just wake up one morning and have that.

41:26.120 --> 41:27.120
Pretty great.

41:27.120 --> 41:28.700
Pretty, pretty great.

41:28.700 --> 41:33.600
And you know, Chris, this actually builds on last show's favorite.

41:33.600 --> 41:37.600
You had a favorite feature that got implemented, which was the auto live in bed.

41:37.600 --> 41:38.600
Yeah.

41:38.600 --> 41:45.040
So this is actually playing off of that using peer to API in the back to just say, hey,

41:45.040 --> 41:46.040
is fits live?

41:46.040 --> 41:47.040
Make it red.

41:47.040 --> 41:48.040
It's not live.

41:48.040 --> 41:49.040
Don't make it red.

41:49.040 --> 41:52.480
So peer to turns out another really sound tech investment we made this year.

41:52.480 --> 41:53.480
That's true.

41:53.480 --> 41:56.920
Again, it was in the effort of decentralization was the primary driver.

41:56.920 --> 42:01.480
And then it turns out what we've done is we built ourselves a platform that we can now

42:01.480 --> 42:07.160
like use the API to auto embed or to determine when we're live or not programmatically.

42:07.160 --> 42:12.640
We never like implemented it for that, but it's so clearly, you know, we needed that.

42:12.640 --> 42:17.440
And I, I did deploy it after talking to Alex Gates, the podcasting to the consultant.

42:17.440 --> 42:23.360
I, I wanted, I wanted the plumbing there so we could live stream to the podcasting to

42:23.360 --> 42:25.520
the compatible apps like pod verse.

42:25.520 --> 42:29.200
So I wanted the plumbing and peer tubes, part of that plumbing.

42:29.200 --> 42:32.120
But then I started, you know, there's all these other benefits like, like this, but

42:32.120 --> 42:33.680
also, well, now we have our own platform.

42:33.680 --> 42:38.680
Like if we ever wanted to start shooting video again, we got a platform for it.

42:38.680 --> 42:39.800
That's not on YouTube.

42:39.800 --> 42:42.240
And that's actually working really well.

42:42.240 --> 42:45.320
We haven't had that many, if any issues with it recently.

42:45.320 --> 42:46.320
So it's been great.

42:46.320 --> 42:47.320
Knock on wood.

42:47.320 --> 42:52.060
So I want to say a huge thanks to deck bot for, for doing that PR and getting that feature

42:52.060 --> 42:53.060
in.

42:53.060 --> 42:54.840
We did a few, you know, back and forth.

42:54.840 --> 42:55.840
That's the beauty of the platform.

42:55.840 --> 42:57.640
And I think it turned out great.

42:57.640 --> 43:02.160
I, I, I, for you, Chris really did a push to try to get that in before last week's Linux

43:02.160 --> 43:03.780
unplugged and it happened.

43:03.780 --> 43:05.080
So that's great.

43:05.080 --> 43:06.080
So great.

43:06.080 --> 43:09.480
I've always felt, I've always felt like it was so odd.

43:09.480 --> 43:12.520
So disconnected that we could be live and they'd be on our website and wouldn't even

43:12.520 --> 43:13.520
know it.

43:13.520 --> 43:17.480
It's a real mess when you think about a decade of people not realizing that you're live and

43:17.480 --> 43:18.480
could join us.

43:18.480 --> 43:19.480
Yeah.

43:19.480 --> 43:20.480
So.

43:20.480 --> 43:21.480
Yeah.

43:21.480 --> 43:22.480
WordPress.

43:22.480 --> 43:23.480
So close.

43:23.480 --> 43:24.480
So far away.

43:24.480 --> 43:25.480
It's that 80% again.

43:25.480 --> 43:28.400
So there's been a lot of activity going on.

43:28.400 --> 43:31.360
So what, what, what is the manifestation of that?

43:31.360 --> 43:35.840
Cause I see a lot of PR information going back and forth and I, when I look at the pulse

43:35.840 --> 43:39.080
page, there's a lot of stuff listed here.

43:39.080 --> 43:40.080
Things are getting done.

43:40.080 --> 43:41.080
Yeah.

43:41.080 --> 43:47.280
I would say from the last, uh, office hours about a fortnight ago, there have been a lot

43:47.280 --> 43:50.280
of new contributors, which has been amazing.

43:50.280 --> 43:53.880
And um, a lot of chat in the matrix room as well.

43:53.880 --> 43:59.280
Like for instance, we've been live here for, I don't know, 30 minutes, 45 minutes on the

43:59.280 --> 44:05.560
show and uh, there's like 13 new messages in the, in the website room, which is, I guess

44:05.560 --> 44:07.560
I got some homework to do later.

44:07.560 --> 44:11.160
Um, and that's not even our main, you know, place to chat about things.

44:11.160 --> 44:16.360
So I wanted to do a few shout outs to some people that I think did some great stuff.

44:16.360 --> 44:25.080
CG base player really did a lot of both opening issues and solving issues with some PRs around

44:25.080 --> 44:31.400
even some like relatively simple to implement stuff, but just really tastefully done again,

44:31.400 --> 44:32.680
which kudos to all everybody.

44:32.680 --> 44:33.840
They've been doing a great job.

44:33.840 --> 44:39.160
So, um, CG play base player wrote a PR that I should review recently.

44:39.160 --> 44:44.440
Um, that's more homework about implementing some issue and PR templates.

44:44.440 --> 44:45.840
So we've just had them blank.

44:45.840 --> 44:54.280
You've noticed you've written a PR for, or an issue, um, and um, so they wrote some templates.

44:54.280 --> 44:56.240
One is for a feature request.

44:56.240 --> 45:02.880
Another is for an issue with the development environment, an issue with some episode information.

45:02.880 --> 45:09.880
So it's sort of customizable enough that we could tune it to, Oh yeah, it's, you know,

45:09.880 --> 45:12.600
if you have a specific episode, then is it the links, is it?

45:12.600 --> 45:17.520
So there's a bunch of really neat stuff we've been able to do there and it's all just implemented

45:17.520 --> 45:18.920
again in a file.

45:18.920 --> 45:22.880
So if you see an issue with the templates themselves, easy to edit, you can go edit

45:22.880 --> 45:24.720
them is really, really, really sweet.

45:24.720 --> 45:27.520
And did the same thing with simple requests.

45:27.520 --> 45:29.520
So did a little template there.

45:29.520 --> 45:30.960
So I think that's really cool stuff.

45:30.960 --> 45:31.960
So thank you CG.

45:31.960 --> 45:32.960
That's awesome.

45:32.960 --> 45:36.160
Should make it smoother for all the future PRs and issues.

45:36.160 --> 45:37.160
Yeah.

45:37.160 --> 45:40.920
I think that's, you know, a small usability improvement and it doesn't affect the website

45:40.920 --> 45:43.520
as you visit it, but it sure affects.

45:43.520 --> 45:44.520
Helps the team.

45:44.520 --> 45:45.520
Yeah.

45:45.520 --> 45:46.520
Yeah.

45:46.520 --> 45:48.840
All the contributors and those who might be new to GitHub and just trying to get their

45:48.840 --> 45:50.320
feet wet in that process.

45:50.320 --> 45:51.320
Definitely.

45:51.320 --> 45:52.320
Thank you.

45:52.320 --> 45:55.600
I also may have given right permissions to Elray.

45:55.600 --> 46:02.000
Elray has been amazing this last few months, just working, you know, sometimes I end up,

46:02.000 --> 46:06.680
you know, quitting my working day before they do and they're in the East coast.

46:06.680 --> 46:07.680
That's crazy.

46:07.680 --> 46:11.920
And so Elray, thank you very much for all the contributions.

46:11.920 --> 46:16.640
They've been also mentoring a bunch of people through PRs with like some code contributions

46:16.640 --> 46:22.040
and suggestions on how to do things more Hugo style or I even, yeah, certainly got a few

46:22.040 --> 46:23.040
good lessons.

46:23.040 --> 46:24.040
So all right.

46:24.040 --> 46:27.920
Thank you for all your mentorship and seriously, and I think they're at the top of the contributors

46:27.920 --> 46:31.540
list mostly because they put in a lot of commits.

46:31.540 --> 46:37.160
They're very commit heavy with every detail, but, but their PRs have been some of the biggest

46:37.160 --> 46:38.160
feature changes.

46:38.160 --> 46:39.160
So huge.

46:39.160 --> 46:40.160
Thanks there.

46:40.160 --> 46:41.160
Yeah.

46:41.160 --> 46:42.160
Really?

46:42.160 --> 46:43.160
Especially like this is the sixth to the 13th.

46:43.160 --> 46:44.160
Look at that.

46:44.160 --> 46:45.280
I'm telling you really impressive stuff.

46:45.280 --> 46:46.280
Yeah.

46:46.280 --> 46:47.280
They also have a day job apparently.

46:47.280 --> 46:48.280
I'm not sure.

46:48.280 --> 46:49.280
That's true.

46:49.280 --> 46:53.800
They also pumping out a ton from Poland.

46:53.800 --> 46:54.800
Yeah.

46:54.800 --> 46:56.680
I, I've been super impressed.

46:56.680 --> 47:01.180
Many people have contributed many amazing things and I, my human memory is not good

47:01.180 --> 47:03.760
enough to name them all, but I just want to a blanket.

47:03.760 --> 47:04.760
Thank you to everyone.

47:04.760 --> 47:06.080
It's been a super exciting last two weeks.

47:06.080 --> 47:07.920
It really, it's been, it's been amazing.

47:07.920 --> 47:11.760
I think this is just one of the most amazing community efforts we've ever seen for JB.

47:11.760 --> 47:16.960
I think Chase did some amazing stuff too around design work and fixing some like layout issues

47:16.960 --> 47:17.960
and things like that.

47:17.960 --> 47:21.320
I also want to give a huge shout out to Mitch from Podverse.

47:21.320 --> 47:25.880
They actually, I guess, gave us a shout out and wrote the following.

47:25.880 --> 47:30.120
By the way, whenever someone jumps in and makes a technical contribution to Podverse,

47:30.120 --> 47:34.240
they pretty much always say that they found out about Podverse from JB.

47:34.240 --> 47:35.240
That's great.

47:35.240 --> 47:36.240
Isn't that nice?

47:36.240 --> 47:37.240
Yeah.

47:37.240 --> 47:38.720
It sounds like some of the better contributions they've had recently have been coming from

47:38.720 --> 47:40.520
JB audience members.

47:40.520 --> 47:43.480
And so thank you for letting them know because that got passed on to us.

47:43.480 --> 47:44.480
Yeah.

47:44.480 --> 47:45.480
That's very sweet.

47:45.480 --> 47:48.840
We don't really hear the signal that that kind of stuff happens.

47:48.840 --> 47:53.280
So whenever we do get to hear that, that's really sweet.

47:53.280 --> 47:56.200
And now it is time for the boost.

47:56.200 --> 47:59.000
Our baller this week also boosted again while we were live.

47:59.000 --> 48:01.640
GeneBean came in with a set of LeetSats.

48:01.640 --> 48:06.040
I decided to watch part of the show live today and realized it'd be nice if there was a way

48:06.040 --> 48:11.040
to use Alby from jupyter.tube to boost.

48:11.040 --> 48:15.680
What I decided to do was fall back to the Podverse web version and send in a live boost

48:15.680 --> 48:16.680
during the show.

48:16.680 --> 48:17.680
Just a thought.

48:17.680 --> 48:18.680
Yeah.

48:18.680 --> 48:19.680
I'm watching Alex Gates.

48:19.680 --> 48:25.400
He's been modifying the no agenda tube for podcasting 2.0 features, and I think they're

48:25.400 --> 48:27.800
working out some boost stuff.

48:27.800 --> 48:29.720
I think there's something to that.

48:29.720 --> 48:33.960
I don't think it's urgent, but I think there's something to it because running a PeerTube

48:33.960 --> 48:35.920
instance is pretty expensive.

48:35.920 --> 48:42.840
And so I could see some communities out there wanting to kind of incentivize content, incentivize

48:42.840 --> 48:47.900
good content, and then maybe the hosting platforms in a split with the creator.

48:47.900 --> 48:48.900
Something like that.

48:48.900 --> 48:49.900
I don't know.

48:49.900 --> 48:50.900
Yeah.

48:50.900 --> 48:53.400
I don't know exactly where it's going to go, but I feel like it's got some legs.

48:53.400 --> 48:58.820
Well, and I think to facilitate that feature, we've been talking about also integrating

48:58.820 --> 49:02.920
a way to boost on our website on the live page where you get the PeerTube embed.

49:02.920 --> 49:03.920
Yeah.

49:03.920 --> 49:06.120
I think that's a nice to have feature at this point.

49:06.120 --> 49:10.760
It's not very, very high on the priority list, but that would be a nice date when that comes

49:10.760 --> 49:11.760
as well.

49:11.760 --> 49:15.040
I am glad Podverse does allow for some web boosting.

49:15.040 --> 49:19.280
We got a row of ducks from Tac751.

49:19.280 --> 49:22.520
He says, I love the new website.

49:22.520 --> 49:23.520
Great work.

49:23.520 --> 49:25.440
I have a question for you guys.

49:25.440 --> 49:31.120
Have you thought about starting a matrix voice chat bridged to mumble?

49:31.120 --> 49:36.360
The reason I'm thinking is I'm forced to use an iOS device to interact with you live.

49:36.360 --> 49:39.720
It's mostly the only device I have available with a microphone and voice isolation good

49:39.720 --> 49:41.000
enough for participation.

49:41.000 --> 49:44.360
However, the mumble situation on iOS is no good.

49:44.360 --> 49:47.480
Yeah, I don't love the mumble options.

49:47.480 --> 49:51.640
There are a couple of third party mumble options, but none of them are really great.

49:51.640 --> 49:53.960
A matrix room bridged to mumble.

49:53.960 --> 49:54.960
Have we thought about that?

49:54.960 --> 49:55.960
No, I don't think so.

49:55.960 --> 49:57.240
No, not really.

49:57.240 --> 50:00.120
Mostly because I don't want to encourage people to leave mumble.

50:00.120 --> 50:05.600
I really like our mumble community, and I think it's such a great tool for this kind

50:05.600 --> 50:06.600
of thing.

50:06.600 --> 50:09.020
It's just one of those that's ahead of its time, right?

50:09.020 --> 50:13.320
When you see how popular clubhouse and Twitter spaces have become in Discord rooms, there's

50:13.320 --> 50:17.400
clearly audience demand or customer demand or whatever for that kind of thing.

50:17.400 --> 50:23.060
But I think bumble was maybe a little soon, a little early, but it's the best still.

50:23.060 --> 50:24.920
So I really want people to join our mumble room.

50:24.920 --> 50:26.420
I really think it's a great tool.

50:26.420 --> 50:29.600
Maybe I'm an old guy.

50:29.600 --> 50:30.720
Maybe I should consider it.

50:30.720 --> 50:32.540
We'll give it a little time and see.

50:32.540 --> 50:34.960
We haven't yet deployed any bridges.

50:34.960 --> 50:35.960
That's true.

50:35.960 --> 50:36.960
On purpose.

50:36.960 --> 50:37.960
Yeah.

50:37.960 --> 50:41.060
The other thing I think is worth considering, Chris, is that the last time we tried to use

50:41.060 --> 50:45.720
the voice stuff in matrix, which was several months ago, it didn't quite work out so well

50:45.720 --> 50:46.720
for us.

50:46.720 --> 50:50.240
So I don't think we have much information on the state of things around there.

50:50.240 --> 50:52.720
So it would need a lot more testing for us to rely on it.

50:52.720 --> 50:53.720
Yeah, we would probably need.

50:53.720 --> 50:54.720
Yeah, you're right.

50:54.720 --> 50:55.720
I think it's gotten better.

50:55.720 --> 50:59.560
I know they've been working on that, but yeah, just about everything has.

50:59.560 --> 51:03.480
So Dylan boosted in with three thousand five hundred stats.

51:03.480 --> 51:06.440
This is now with the Hugo deployment out of the way.

51:06.440 --> 51:09.880
Any plans for a Jupiter broadcasting form?

51:09.880 --> 51:12.600
I wonder how in the loop you are with free and open source form software.

51:12.600 --> 51:13.600
Do you have a favorite?

51:13.600 --> 51:20.180
I myself am currently getting ready to set up Flarem, F-L-A-R-U-M, for my own community.

51:20.180 --> 51:24.920
I would love to hear more about that, Dylan, if you or Dylan, if you have any experience

51:24.920 --> 51:29.760
with it or how your users respond to that.

51:29.760 --> 51:34.160
You're probably not surprised to hear me say I'm not super interested in a form.

51:34.160 --> 51:37.640
We used to have a very large form.

51:37.640 --> 51:44.280
That's how we actually came on to Scale Engines Radar, who was our original host, was because

51:44.280 --> 51:47.200
the hosting provider we had at the time was like, you got to get out of here.

51:47.200 --> 51:51.360
Your website's taken way too much traffic, too many resources, you got to get out of

51:51.360 --> 51:52.360
here.

51:52.360 --> 51:54.680
And so we're like, OK, OK, we don't know where to go.

51:54.680 --> 51:56.840
And now it's like, well, I'll help you.

51:56.840 --> 51:58.680
And he helped us migrate to Scale Engine.

51:58.680 --> 52:02.000
And it remained popular for a while, but then it kind of faded, and then we set up some

52:02.000 --> 52:08.240
other ones over the years, different platforms, Discourse, Vee, Bulletin, PHP, BBB, and other

52:08.240 --> 52:10.800
ones, just kind of playing around with them.

52:10.800 --> 52:15.920
And I think it just feels like the world's kind of moved more towards real-time communication,

52:15.920 --> 52:23.320
although clearly there are, for certain projects, it's nice to have Git Hubs with, you know,

52:23.320 --> 52:25.040
asynchronous communication.

52:25.040 --> 52:26.040
Asynchronous communication.

52:26.040 --> 52:27.840
So there are times where it works.

52:27.840 --> 52:32.280
It just feels like we already have too many platforms and too many options, and we're

52:32.280 --> 52:36.240
finally kind of consolidating around Boost and Matrix and Telegram.

52:36.240 --> 52:41.280
Well, I do feel like Matrix with all of its subdivisions, you know, all the different

52:41.280 --> 52:42.280
rooms and the topics.

52:42.280 --> 52:43.520
Yeah, they're kind of like sub-forums.

52:43.520 --> 52:46.880
It's pretty much a forum, if you look at it that way, the way we have it set up.

52:46.880 --> 52:51.400
And so I would say, if you haven't spent that much time there, go there for sure.

52:51.400 --> 52:55.840
I hope it has some of the same feel, but to get some of this stuff live, too, and all

52:55.840 --> 52:59.440
the features that it has, I think it's been actually really pleasantly amazing.

52:59.440 --> 53:00.440
Yeah, yeah.

53:00.440 --> 53:01.760
It feels like that's the way to go now.

53:01.760 --> 53:02.760
Yeah.

53:02.760 --> 53:03.760
I agree.

53:03.760 --> 53:04.760
I'd be curious to know what they think.

53:04.760 --> 53:09.040
And we've tried to break the subjects up quite a bit, so no one particular room is going

53:09.040 --> 53:10.040
crazy.

53:10.040 --> 53:13.280
Like, I can pretty much stay up to date on all the rooms without it feeling like a burden.

53:13.280 --> 53:14.280
Look at you.

53:14.280 --> 53:15.280
I know.

53:15.280 --> 53:16.280
I dedicate a monitor to it.

53:16.280 --> 53:19.440
Where I remember before Matrix, you were feeling pretty overwhelmed.

53:19.440 --> 53:22.760
Oh, I still struggle with the Telegram room.

53:22.760 --> 53:25.680
I can only just kind of jump in there a few times a day, and I can't really stay up to

53:25.680 --> 53:26.680
date on all of it.

53:26.680 --> 53:27.680
Or same with Twitter.

53:27.680 --> 53:31.960
Just when it's one flat stream, it just doesn't work for me, because that's just not what

53:31.960 --> 53:32.960
I'm doing all day.

53:32.960 --> 53:35.480
Sergeant Apple boosted in with a row of ducks.

53:35.480 --> 53:36.480
Thank you kindly.

53:36.480 --> 53:39.120
He just simply said, congrats on the new website.

53:39.120 --> 53:43.040
We got a lot of congratulations on the new website, so thank you, everybody.

53:43.040 --> 53:45.760
Rusticaster Versa boosted in with a thousand sats.

53:45.760 --> 53:49.400
I sat around for four minutes of dead air waiting for a secret bonus at the end, like

53:49.400 --> 53:51.120
of a Marvel movie of last week's episode.

53:51.120 --> 53:52.120
Oh, no.

53:52.120 --> 53:53.240
You guys got me.

53:53.240 --> 53:55.120
But great job on the new website.

53:55.120 --> 53:57.560
It's so awesome and cool that the community's involved.

53:57.560 --> 53:58.560
Cheers, everybody.

53:58.560 --> 54:00.720
Yeah, I think that was just an export mistake.

54:00.720 --> 54:02.280
That's another thing we broke.

54:02.280 --> 54:03.280
Oops, sorry.

54:03.280 --> 54:04.280
Yeah.

54:04.280 --> 54:08.200
And Drew kindly snipped and republished, but if you download one of the early versions

54:08.200 --> 54:11.560
of the show, you got a little extra dead air at the end.

54:11.560 --> 54:16.220
You know, I think we probably deserve to put in some little special feature at some point.

54:16.220 --> 54:17.220
We should have.

54:17.220 --> 54:20.560
Well, you know, most weeks will not every time, but a lot of times we'll have something

54:20.560 --> 54:23.600
in the post show, usually not with office hours, but every now and then.

54:23.600 --> 54:27.600
So it you know, I would not be it would not be unusual to expect it.

54:27.600 --> 54:32.640
But never like a secret song from a 90s CD, you know, where you got to like 90 songs to

54:32.640 --> 54:34.000
get such a thing.

54:34.000 --> 54:36.440
That was such a thing.

54:36.440 --> 54:37.440
Wow.

54:37.440 --> 54:47.960
So GeneBean is technically a double booster this week with another set of LeetSats.

54:47.960 --> 54:53.480
And I need to spend time with Albie because maybe GeneBean, you can be our Albie correspondent.

54:53.480 --> 54:56.480
Anybody else out there that's using Albie, he's looking for ways to generate an invoice

54:56.480 --> 55:02.800
on mobile so he can essentially use Strike on mobile and top off his Albie wallet.

55:02.800 --> 55:07.360
He says, I've only found out how to do this via the desktop web extension, but he'd like

55:07.360 --> 55:08.960
a way to do it completely on mobile.

55:08.960 --> 55:09.960
Right.

55:09.960 --> 55:12.160
The way I would think you'd do it right was you would you'd probably have your mobile

55:12.160 --> 55:15.120
phone and the desktop extension up and kind of do it at the same time, but it would be

55:15.120 --> 55:17.840
nice to do it all when you're out and about.

55:17.840 --> 55:20.960
I think sometimes that's the problem with some of these like QR methods.

55:20.960 --> 55:24.040
And I'm not saying that's the case here, but I've seen that sometimes when they implement

55:24.040 --> 55:27.240
like a QR code scanning method of getting an invoice in or something.

55:27.240 --> 55:29.960
Well, you kind of necessarily need two devices for that.

55:29.960 --> 55:31.840
I think we got to spend time with Albie.

55:31.840 --> 55:36.360
I have it installed and I've used it a little bit because I use it for my boosting with

55:36.360 --> 55:40.600
Podverse, but I haven't really like lived with it.

55:40.600 --> 55:42.920
But I think it's worth that time and investment.

55:42.920 --> 55:48.960
Proximity sent in their very first boost, just 25 SATs, but they're a new Linux user

55:48.960 --> 55:52.480
who started listening a couple of years ago when the lockdowns happened.

55:52.480 --> 55:55.880
They started listening to our podcast, which is great because I heard a lot of people that

55:55.880 --> 55:56.880
stopped listening.

55:56.880 --> 55:57.880
It's true.

55:57.880 --> 55:58.880
Changing habit.

55:58.880 --> 56:00.680
But I'm curious what you think about this.

56:00.680 --> 56:02.520
We haven't talked about this much at all.

56:02.520 --> 56:07.960
He says, I think the idea of Fountain where you earn SATs while you listen is great for

56:07.960 --> 56:08.960
the podcast economy.

56:08.960 --> 56:12.520
So here's a small token as my first boost ever.

56:12.520 --> 56:20.200
So in Fountain, the way this works is they now let podcasters promote clips or an episode

56:20.200 --> 56:26.200
and you pay like a thousand or two thousand SATs or 10,000 SATs to have your show promoted.

56:26.200 --> 56:32.880
And in Fountain, the homepage, if you will, of the app when you launch it is a Discover page.

56:32.880 --> 56:36.640
At the top, it'll have two promoted clips and then I'll have about like six community

56:36.640 --> 56:43.180
source clips and some of the most popular community clips will be featured on this page.

56:43.180 --> 56:45.440
And then on the second page is all your podcasts.

56:45.440 --> 56:52.280
And so when you listen to a podcast or you listen to a promoted clip, you get streamed

56:52.280 --> 56:59.280
SATs and those SATs are taken from the promotion when people bought promoted spots on Fountain.

56:59.280 --> 57:04.520
So you can earn SATs as you listen, as you know, I've earned like 55,000 SATs and we

57:04.520 --> 57:07.640
get a lot of people who boost in just from the SATs they earn.

57:07.640 --> 57:12.000
I'm curious, does it seem gimmicky to you or does it seem like a legit system?

57:12.000 --> 57:16.080
Because it's the only podcast app that's doing this.

57:16.080 --> 57:20.840
But the idea is sort of like, so on that road trip, you're driving for 11 hours.

57:20.840 --> 57:24.480
If you listened to podcasts the entire time with Fountain and you were in good flow, which

57:24.480 --> 57:29.980
is when you've been listening to making clips, you might have been able to earn a chunk of

57:29.980 --> 57:30.980
change there.

57:30.980 --> 57:32.280
Although don't clip and drive people.

57:32.280 --> 57:33.400
Yeah, don't clip and drive.

57:33.400 --> 57:36.280
What are your thoughts, scammy or the future?

57:36.280 --> 57:38.280
When this first came out, I was actually quite worried.

57:38.280 --> 57:41.680
I thought, oh, Fountain has been doing good things and now all of a sudden they have this

57:41.680 --> 57:45.000
system that can potentially really ruin what they've been doing.

57:45.000 --> 57:47.420
Things can get weird when money gets involved.

57:47.420 --> 57:48.960
But I think it's in their implementation.

57:48.960 --> 57:53.600
It sounds like, you know, even you mentioned when you first bring it up, it has two featured

57:53.600 --> 57:56.140
clips and then the rest are community clips.

57:56.140 --> 57:59.680
I think that's actually a really nice balance because you're not just inundated with, you

57:59.680 --> 58:02.800
know, they're all promoted clips, right?

58:02.800 --> 58:06.560
It's like, oh, I don't actually, there's not that much value in all this because someone

58:06.560 --> 58:07.880
just bought their way in.

58:07.880 --> 58:11.840
But to have a mix between the two, I think that's actually a really nice balance.

58:11.840 --> 58:19.200
So the community, you know, has their stuff that's promoted just through meritocracy,

58:19.200 --> 58:20.200
I guess.

58:20.200 --> 58:21.200
Yeah.

58:21.200 --> 58:24.400
You know, when I first started using Fountain and I saw the clips, I was like, oh, get these.

58:24.400 --> 58:26.440
I want my podcast as my default screen.

58:26.440 --> 58:28.640
Get these clips out of here.

58:28.640 --> 58:32.760
Now like months into it, there's a couple of things I like a lot about it.

58:32.760 --> 58:37.680
A. I now, like if I just want to, if I'm just doing something for a few minutes, like maybe

58:37.680 --> 58:40.960
I'm tidying the kitchen and I want to kill five minutes.

58:40.960 --> 58:45.520
I used to go to YouTube and I'd watch something that's probably like junk food for the mind

58:45.520 --> 58:48.960
on YouTube while I was doing a short task, right?

58:48.960 --> 58:55.560
But now I open up Fountain and I just play a podcast clip and it's almost always better

58:55.560 --> 58:58.160
because you're right, it's not an algorithm that's picked it.

58:58.160 --> 59:02.280
It's the popularity in the Fountain community that's brought to the top.

59:02.280 --> 59:08.680
And through that process, I think I've added three, maybe four podcasts that I listened

59:08.680 --> 59:13.600
to on the regular now as a result that I never, and so it's like now I have podcasts that

59:13.600 --> 59:17.960
are only in Fountain and I'm like, I've got some in Podverse and I've got some in Fountain.

59:17.960 --> 59:22.960
It's a bit of a mess, but I really like their clip discovery and I started as a skeptic

59:22.960 --> 59:28.920
and I like the SAT streaming system because it's just one more like, well, this podcast

59:28.920 --> 59:34.180
is on YouTube, but it's also in Fountain and I could earn some SATs if I listen in Fountain.

59:34.180 --> 59:37.040
So I'll just listen in Fountain and I think that's better.

59:37.040 --> 59:42.840
I think for the content creator, it's better if I listen in Fountain and I think for me,

59:42.840 --> 59:45.600
because of the YouTube ecosystem and how it just keeps sending you down a rabbit hole,

59:45.600 --> 59:50.520
I think it's better for me if I listen in Fountain and I earn SATs at the same time.

59:50.520 --> 59:56.040
Another thing is that like proximity here, if you're not fully into the whole Bitcoin

59:56.040 --> 01:00:00.940
thing and getting your own SATs and you don't want to jump through all those hoots to just

01:00:00.940 --> 01:00:05.560
start playing with this, the SAT streaming is actually a really nice way to just kind

01:00:05.560 --> 01:00:07.240
of get your toe wet.

01:00:07.240 --> 01:00:08.240
Yeah.

01:00:08.240 --> 01:00:11.040
And you know, for 25 SATs, he just kicked off this whole conversation we just had.

01:00:11.040 --> 01:00:12.280
That's the great thing about the boost.

01:00:12.280 --> 01:00:14.520
It's not really about the value so much.

01:00:14.520 --> 01:00:16.440
It's about whatever it is to you, right?

01:00:16.440 --> 01:00:18.720
Those are his first 25 SATs he's ever earned.

01:00:18.720 --> 01:00:21.000
Well, that's a lot to him, right?

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:23.440
It's what is the value of the show to you?

01:00:23.440 --> 01:00:25.880
So thank you, proximity.

01:00:25.880 --> 01:00:30.560
We got a boost from GLT Gordon, 2000 SATs.

01:00:30.560 --> 01:00:32.600
Took your advice to use Fountain to gain some SATs.

01:00:32.600 --> 01:00:35.360
The UK banks are not allowing me to buy Bitcoin.

01:00:35.360 --> 01:00:37.480
There's another reason why you might want to earn SATs.

01:00:37.480 --> 01:00:41.340
So what you got to do, JL, is you got to optimize your flow mode.

01:00:41.340 --> 01:00:44.600
If you go into the overflow menu, the hamburger menu in Fountain, it'll give you what your

01:00:44.600 --> 01:00:45.840
flow status is.

01:00:45.840 --> 01:00:48.300
The higher your flow, the higher your earn rate.

01:00:48.300 --> 01:00:53.200
You get more flow by listening to clips, by liking clips, by making clips, and by boosting

01:00:53.200 --> 01:00:54.200
shows.

01:00:54.200 --> 01:00:55.880
The more you do that, your flow meter goes up.

01:00:55.880 --> 01:01:00.240
Oh, and the big one, the biggest thing you can do is recommend people, like give them

01:01:00.240 --> 01:01:01.240
your link.

01:01:01.240 --> 01:01:02.240
Referral link.

01:01:02.240 --> 01:01:03.240
Yeah, referral link.

01:01:03.240 --> 01:01:07.280
And if you get five people, you get like a 5x flow rate.

01:01:07.280 --> 01:01:12.440
And some people, I think it might have been in the Bitcoin chatting matrix room, were

01:01:12.440 --> 01:01:17.600
suggesting, yeah, if people want to throw in their referral links in there, people use

01:01:17.600 --> 01:01:18.600
them.

01:01:18.600 --> 01:01:20.320
So there's a bit of a community happening here, too.

01:01:20.320 --> 01:01:21.320
There you go.

01:01:21.320 --> 01:01:26.280
I just, I think it's, what I am seeing as a podcaster is a lot of those SATs are coming

01:01:26.280 --> 01:01:27.280
back to the podcasters.

01:01:27.280 --> 01:01:28.280
Nice.

01:01:28.280 --> 01:01:29.280
Right?

01:01:29.280 --> 01:01:30.280
Because you could just cash them out.

01:01:30.280 --> 01:01:31.280
Oh, right, of course.

01:01:31.280 --> 01:01:33.360
And then people are turning around and using them to boost.

01:01:33.360 --> 01:01:38.840
So it is, it's the listeners are earning, and then they're reinvesting it into the podcast.

01:01:38.840 --> 01:01:40.640
There's value in the ecosystem.

01:01:40.640 --> 01:01:41.640
Right.

01:01:41.640 --> 01:01:42.840
Very interesting system.

01:01:42.840 --> 01:01:45.760
So I'm, I like you was the first, it was a little trepidatious, I'm like, yeah, you add

01:01:45.760 --> 01:01:47.320
money to anything and it can get weird.

01:01:47.320 --> 01:01:48.320
Oh, yeah.

01:01:48.320 --> 01:01:52.300
Having now seen it, and seeing their updates, they've done a couple of app updates since

01:01:52.300 --> 01:01:55.160
they've implemented it, and they've kind of made it smoother and easier to see where you're

01:01:55.160 --> 01:01:58.560
at, clear what's going on.

01:01:58.560 --> 01:02:00.720
So I think they've done a good job on the implementation.

01:02:00.720 --> 01:02:03.000
So you feel pretty satisfied now?

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:04.520
That's good.

01:02:04.520 --> 01:02:07.320
Somebody should bang suggest that.

01:02:07.320 --> 01:02:13.960
JLT also sent another 3500 SATs just to say, hey, we got also 50 SATs from a young dookie

01:02:13.960 --> 01:02:18.080
who said, I'm still having trouble finding the show.

01:02:18.080 --> 01:02:22.200
But usually if I find a clip of the show, then I can find the show from there.

01:02:22.200 --> 01:02:23.200
Wow.

01:02:23.200 --> 01:02:24.200
Yeah.

01:02:24.200 --> 01:02:29.640
Yeah, I think we might rename the show after the trip or towards maybe around the holidays,

01:02:29.640 --> 01:02:30.640
might be time for a show.

01:02:30.640 --> 01:02:34.760
I think if we were the only podcast on the planet, maybe it'd be a good name.

01:02:34.760 --> 01:02:35.760
Yeah.

01:02:35.760 --> 01:02:37.080
I would imagine it's been used a lot.

01:02:37.080 --> 01:02:42.600
And a lot of podcasts that use the name Office Hours are podcasts about the show, The Office,

01:02:42.600 --> 01:02:44.080
the US edition of The Office.

01:02:44.080 --> 01:02:45.080
Oh, of course.

01:02:45.080 --> 01:02:46.080
Yeah.

01:02:46.080 --> 01:02:47.080
I don't know.

01:02:47.080 --> 01:02:48.080
So we'll have to get some ideas.

01:02:48.080 --> 01:02:50.080
Yeah, we're open to suggestions.

01:02:50.080 --> 01:02:51.080
Yeah.

01:02:51.080 --> 01:02:54.400
So you're right, a young dookie, it is a pain in the butt.

01:02:54.400 --> 01:02:57.120
And if you don't get the right one, it's like maybe doesn't have the boost feed and all

01:02:57.120 --> 01:02:58.120
that too.

01:02:58.120 --> 01:03:02.480
So we'll have to work on that, but he does say, regardless, great work, everyone on the

01:03:02.480 --> 01:03:03.480
new website.

01:03:03.480 --> 01:03:04.880
Oh, bonus point.

01:03:04.880 --> 01:03:05.880
We got a lot.

01:03:05.880 --> 01:03:06.880
We got a lot this week.

01:03:06.880 --> 01:03:10.400
I wasn't going to necessarily put them all in because we're kind of being selective about

01:03:10.400 --> 01:03:15.120
the boost we include now, but we do read all of them and we got a lot of compliments on

01:03:15.120 --> 01:03:16.120
the new website.

01:03:16.120 --> 01:03:17.760
So that was really nice to see.

01:03:17.760 --> 01:03:18.760
Thank you, everyone.

01:03:18.760 --> 01:03:21.760
You can go grab a new podcast app, a new podcast apps.com.

01:03:21.760 --> 01:03:25.960
I love Podverse because it's built into our website, but it's GPL.

01:03:25.960 --> 01:03:27.960
It's available for Android, iOS.

01:03:27.960 --> 01:03:30.640
It's on F-Droid and they're constantly making it better.

01:03:30.640 --> 01:03:35.440
We're going to have Mitch on the show in a few weeks to kind of talk about it, but now

01:03:35.440 --> 01:03:36.440
we're going to hit the road.

01:03:36.440 --> 01:03:40.120
I don't know if we'll be live next week or in two weeks.

01:03:40.120 --> 01:03:42.360
All our shows are weekly except for self-hosted.

01:03:42.360 --> 01:03:44.360
Where are we going to be in two weeks?

01:03:44.360 --> 01:03:46.040
Let's see.

01:03:46.040 --> 01:03:47.640
Will we be all the way down in Pasadena?

01:03:47.640 --> 01:03:48.920
I think it's a Pasadena.

01:03:48.920 --> 01:03:53.880
I think the next office hours actually falls on the day we're supposed to drive down to

01:03:53.880 --> 01:03:54.880
Pasadena to the Airbnb.

01:03:54.880 --> 01:03:55.880
Yeah.

01:03:55.880 --> 01:03:56.880
It's on the 27th.

01:03:56.880 --> 01:03:57.880
Yeah.

01:03:57.880 --> 01:04:00.720
The reason why I'm not sure if we're going to be live is because you and I might just

01:04:00.720 --> 01:04:05.560
wake up super early, record an off-air show and then hit the road.

01:04:05.560 --> 01:04:06.560
That's the safer option.

01:04:06.560 --> 01:04:07.560
It sounds like.

01:04:07.560 --> 01:04:08.560
Yeah.

01:04:08.560 --> 01:04:09.560
That's what I think we're going to do.

01:04:09.560 --> 01:04:10.560
Okay.

01:04:10.560 --> 01:04:11.560
We'll see.

01:04:11.560 --> 01:04:12.560
We'll see.

01:04:12.560 --> 01:04:13.560
I don't really know because who knows?

01:04:13.560 --> 01:04:14.560
Right?

01:04:14.560 --> 01:04:15.560
I'm not even really sure where we're going to be.

01:04:15.560 --> 01:04:20.600
This is where it gets fun, but I think we got all the right gear on board JOOPS.

01:04:20.600 --> 01:04:21.600
There's a couple of things I had to pick up.

01:04:21.600 --> 01:04:24.640
We've got a new Zoom field recorder, so all the XLR ports are working.

01:04:24.640 --> 01:04:28.480
We should probably take it out of the box and put batteries in it and try it.

01:04:28.480 --> 01:04:29.480
Yeah.

01:04:29.480 --> 01:04:32.480
I got a Elgato Stream Deck for switching.

01:04:32.480 --> 01:04:33.480
Wow.

01:04:33.480 --> 01:04:34.480
Really?

01:04:34.480 --> 01:04:36.480
Because I only have one monitor when I'm on the road.

01:04:36.480 --> 01:04:37.480
That's nice.

01:04:37.480 --> 01:04:41.080
Here, I've got one, two, three, four, five screens.

01:04:41.080 --> 01:04:44.120
I go from having five screens to do the show to having one screen.

01:04:44.120 --> 01:04:48.960
I thought, yeah, the Stream Deck is probably a good way to go.

01:04:48.960 --> 01:04:53.800
Just get some basic functionality up on there and take some of that stuff off from clicking.

01:04:53.800 --> 01:04:55.480
Got to kind of get all that wired up.

01:04:55.480 --> 01:04:59.640
Still a little bit of work to do on that, but we've got a few days because we're going

01:04:59.640 --> 01:05:01.200
to record Linux unplugged in studio.

01:05:01.200 --> 01:05:07.800
We're doing a double this week, and then Coder on Monday morning, and then we're hitting

01:05:07.800 --> 01:05:08.800
the road.

01:05:08.800 --> 01:05:09.800
Then we're out of here.

01:05:09.800 --> 01:05:10.800
We're driving for 10 hours.

01:05:10.800 --> 01:05:11.800
Yeah.

01:05:11.800 --> 01:05:12.800
I'm used to that by now.

01:05:12.800 --> 01:05:13.800
All right.

01:05:13.800 --> 01:05:14.800
Well, that's it then.

01:05:14.800 --> 01:05:15.800
It's time to get out of here.

01:05:15.800 --> 01:05:17.560
Thanks for joining us, everybody.

01:05:17.560 --> 01:05:18.560
Office hours are over.

01:05:18.560 --> 01:05:19.560
We got to tidy up and pack.

01:05:19.560 --> 01:05:22.560
We got to get out of here.

01:05:22.560 --> 01:05:23.560
Thanks for joining us.

01:05:23.560 --> 01:05:24.560
We'll see you next week.

01:05:24.560 --> 01:05:53.560
Bye-bye.
