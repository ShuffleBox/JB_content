WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.800
All right, are you ready to record over there?

00:03.800 --> 00:07.260
Yeah, it looks good over here.

00:07.260 --> 00:10.400
I brought myself a couple of things.

00:10.400 --> 00:12.960
I have a new bag.

00:12.960 --> 00:14.280
I should have pre-cut it.

00:14.280 --> 00:19.000
But what I have here in my hand is a new package of suspenders.

00:19.000 --> 00:21.520
This is now my second pair of suspenders.

00:21.520 --> 00:22.660
I'm upgrading.

00:22.660 --> 00:25.000
I'm trying to go with maybe some style and some fashion.

00:25.000 --> 00:26.000
I see a design there.

00:26.000 --> 00:27.420
I'm excited to find out what it is.

00:27.420 --> 00:29.800
Yeah, yeah, it's got like a checkers design on it.

00:29.800 --> 00:31.360
I don't know if I can actually get it open.

00:31.360 --> 00:36.120
I don't know if I have any instruments of which I can avail myself to get this open.

00:36.120 --> 00:37.400
I don't think I do.

00:37.400 --> 00:40.720
I don't know if I do, but oh, I can just rip it open with my intense man strength.

00:40.720 --> 00:41.760
Never mind.

00:41.760 --> 00:43.800
Oh, geez.

00:43.800 --> 00:50.440
So yeah, it's a dark blue pattern on there and kind of a checkered pattern.

00:50.440 --> 00:51.040
They're really nice.

00:51.040 --> 00:52.960
I think they're going to look really nice with some of the stuff I have.

00:52.960 --> 00:57.640
And then the buckles are fancy leather kind of fancy buckles.

00:57.640 --> 00:58.960
These are like high end.

00:58.960 --> 00:59.880
Yeah, man.

00:59.880 --> 01:01.840
So I'm excited about it.

01:01.840 --> 01:03.760
I've been enjoying the suspender lifestyle.

01:03.760 --> 01:05.480
It's given me a new confidence.

01:05.480 --> 01:07.880
I'm walking around and my pants fit all of a sudden.

01:07.880 --> 01:11.840
And you know, as a guy who's like waist size is always in fluctuation,

01:11.840 --> 01:17.100
the suspenders are nice because I was always having to adjust my belts

01:17.100 --> 01:19.280
all the time and switch belts.

01:19.280 --> 01:21.200
And sometimes I would just not have the right belt.

01:21.200 --> 01:23.880
And I don't have that problem with the suspenders.

01:23.880 --> 01:25.800
I see suspenders swag in our future.

01:25.800 --> 01:27.800
Oh, I'm all about it.

01:27.800 --> 01:32.200
But man, Chris, don't you feel like 10 years older wearing these suspenders?

01:32.200 --> 01:33.320
That's impossible.

01:33.320 --> 01:35.440
At your age, no one wears them.

01:35.440 --> 01:36.320
Oh, I wear them.

01:36.320 --> 01:39.480
I feel like it is an older man thing.

01:39.480 --> 01:42.760
And I am kind of embracing the look, I suppose.

01:42.760 --> 01:45.880
You know, I'm just kind of like, I'm just getting old enough where

01:45.880 --> 01:47.640
I'm like, I don't think I care.

01:47.640 --> 01:50.200
I think I just want to be comfortable or whatever.

01:50.200 --> 01:52.840
But I don't want to wear sweats or things that, you know,

01:52.840 --> 01:55.040
all the clothing that has elastic bands.

01:55.040 --> 01:56.040
Because that's my other way.

01:56.040 --> 01:57.640
That's the other route I could go.

01:57.640 --> 01:59.400
Is just go the elastic banding.

01:59.400 --> 02:05.160
But I got to say, the dude in sweats look, while it works for some people,

02:05.160 --> 02:07.480
does not work for me, man.

02:07.480 --> 02:11.240
It looks like I have given up on life.

02:11.240 --> 02:15.800
That's how I feel about most people that wear sweats, especially in the airport.

02:15.800 --> 02:17.240
Yeah, yeah.

02:17.240 --> 02:18.080
You've seen it.

02:18.080 --> 02:18.880
I know.

02:18.880 --> 02:19.920
I know I have.

02:19.920 --> 02:23.320
I don't know what the suspenders deal, how that's going to work in the airport.

02:23.320 --> 02:25.200
I don't know if the metal's a problem.

02:25.200 --> 02:27.600
You just show them your suspenders and they're like, oh, yeah,

02:27.600 --> 02:28.640
you're fine, just keep going.

02:28.640 --> 02:30.000
You're not a threat at all.

02:30.000 --> 02:32.760
Yeah, it's going to be the gun and the holster that, no, I'm kidding.

02:32.760 --> 02:35.960
I would have a holster, but it'd be a phone.

02:35.960 --> 02:38.440
Could see that being really useful while you're traveling.

02:38.440 --> 02:43.160
My other thing is, like, Alex is, there's just a very slight,

02:43.160 --> 02:46.200
the slightest little, see, and the chair just.

02:46.200 --> 02:47.720
You're drifting away from the microphone.

02:47.720 --> 02:49.400
You're drifting backwards.

02:49.400 --> 02:51.480
It's a thing that maybe he and I can fix.

02:51.480 --> 02:52.320
All right, you ready to start?

02:52.320 --> 02:53.360
Should we record this thing?

02:53.360 --> 02:55.680
Yeah, I feel warmed up.

02:55.680 --> 02:56.960
Oh, I'll tell you, though.

02:56.960 --> 02:58.280
I've been looking forward to this show all week.

02:58.280 --> 02:59.960
Something about it being new.

02:59.960 --> 03:02.280
And my new, you know, I told you about my tab thing I'm doing,

03:02.280 --> 03:04.720
where every device I carry, I'm just keeping the dock in a tab.

03:04.720 --> 03:06.560
Yeah, that's a great idea.

03:06.560 --> 03:08.240
And you combine that with the boosts coming in.

03:08.240 --> 03:09.200
Those are fun.

03:09.200 --> 03:10.720
I've been getting some of those coming in about the show,

03:10.720 --> 03:12.080
so that's nice to see.

03:12.080 --> 03:16.440
I think it's kind of fascinating that even now, you know,

03:16.440 --> 03:18.120
we've been doing this for a while,

03:18.120 --> 03:21.200
and we tend to work on tech stuff all the time,

03:21.200 --> 03:23.320
still discovering better ways to work.

03:23.320 --> 03:24.280
Yeah, what do you mean?

03:24.280 --> 03:26.360
Like, using this tool we're using right now to talk,

03:26.360 --> 03:26.960
or what do you mean?

03:26.960 --> 03:27.640
Sure.

03:27.640 --> 03:30.080
Well, even just keeping some tabs on your different devices,

03:30.080 --> 03:31.600
like, that's such a small thing,

03:31.600 --> 03:34.000
and yet is a boost of efficiency, right?

03:34.000 --> 03:35.680
The workflow tweaks.

03:35.680 --> 03:38.040
Like, why didn't I think of that before is what my thought is.

03:38.040 --> 03:39.360
Like, you idiot.

03:39.360 --> 03:42.680
Well, there are better ways, but it's a fine method.

03:42.680 --> 03:44.160
It's like a compromise method.

03:44.160 --> 03:45.440
Like, you know what it is?

03:45.440 --> 03:48.240
It's me just kind of realizing the best way for me

03:48.240 --> 03:50.880
to capture these ideas is to have a tab in my web browser.

03:50.880 --> 03:53.000
Even though I've tried all these different apps,

03:53.000 --> 03:54.360
you know, I've tried all these different methods

03:54.360 --> 03:55.880
of capturing ideas and syncing it

03:55.880 --> 03:58.600
in different open source things and different services.

03:58.600 --> 03:59.520
And then at the end of the day, it's like,

03:59.520 --> 04:02.720
we'll just keep our doc, because it's Hdocs.

04:02.720 --> 04:05.040
It's HedgeDocs, so it's a web app.

04:05.040 --> 04:06.840
Just keep that in a tab.

04:06.840 --> 04:08.600
Just go in there and drop an idea in there.

04:08.600 --> 04:10.080
And you have to kind of go in there about once a day,

04:10.080 --> 04:11.400
or else it logs you out.

04:11.400 --> 04:12.680
That's my least favorite part about that.

04:12.680 --> 04:17.000
But it's a great collaborative tool, for sure.

04:17.000 --> 04:17.920
Yeah, I agree.

04:17.920 --> 04:18.760
So that's been nice.

04:18.760 --> 04:20.720
I've just kind of been throwing stuff in there.

04:20.720 --> 04:22.560
We've created a chat room to kind of collaborate

04:22.560 --> 04:24.440
on the show, so that's been nice.

04:24.440 --> 04:26.680
All right, are you ready to record over there?

04:26.680 --> 04:27.520
I wonder if somebody,

04:27.520 --> 04:29.680
I wonder if anybody in our audience is crafty enough.

04:29.680 --> 04:32.280
Imagine for a second, dude, just imagine for a second.

04:32.280 --> 04:33.560
In a what?

04:33.560 --> 04:38.080
Your suspenders with holsters for the Zoom and the MD-46.

04:38.080 --> 04:38.920
Right?

04:38.920 --> 04:41.080
Like, we could walk around with holsters

04:41.080 --> 04:42.880
for our recording gear strapped.

04:42.880 --> 04:44.300
We should look into bag, you know,

04:44.300 --> 04:47.040
there's probably stuff we could already use out there.

04:47.040 --> 04:49.200
Would you want a bag or like a clippy thing?

04:49.200 --> 04:50.120
Because I'm thinking.

04:50.120 --> 04:51.400
I mean, you know, I mean like not,

04:51.400 --> 04:55.520
I just mean like vests with like bags or pockets or like.

04:55.520 --> 04:56.680
But you want them a little lower

04:56.680 --> 04:58.360
so you could be like, you know.

04:58.360 --> 04:59.360
Maybe.

04:59.360 --> 05:00.180
I don't know.

05:00.180 --> 05:02.200
I kind of like the idea of like the microphone

05:02.200 --> 05:03.620
is just right here and I just whip it out.

05:03.620 --> 05:05.520
Like almost like you would like a gun,

05:05.520 --> 05:07.000
but I'm whipping out a microphone to.

05:07.000 --> 05:09.520
You need also cable routing, like cable management.

05:09.520 --> 05:10.360
Yeah.

05:10.360 --> 05:11.780
Little straps on the.

05:11.780 --> 05:12.820
The other thing too,

05:12.820 --> 05:15.820
is I think there's various remote controls for the Zoom.

05:15.820 --> 05:16.920
Now that I think about it.

05:16.920 --> 05:18.200
Imagine having the record button

05:18.200 --> 05:19.720
clipped right here to your collar.

05:19.720 --> 05:21.000
So you pull the microphone out

05:21.000 --> 05:23.240
and you just click your collar and you're recording.

05:23.240 --> 05:24.860
You click your collar again and you're done.

05:24.860 --> 05:27.160
We could be up in our, maybe as events come back,

05:27.160 --> 05:29.200
it's time for us to think about this.

05:29.200 --> 05:30.980
Because we're sticking to it.

05:30.980 --> 05:33.540
You know, I was complaining about the Zoom record button.

05:33.540 --> 05:35.120
It's awful.

05:35.120 --> 05:37.640
And so a remote would be pretty sweet.

05:37.640 --> 05:39.100
I know, man.

05:39.100 --> 05:39.940
All right, you ready?

05:39.940 --> 05:40.760
Yeah.

05:40.760 --> 05:42.120
Okay, Brentley.

05:42.120 --> 05:44.660
All right, three, two, one.

05:46.360 --> 05:48.080
It's Office Hours.

05:48.080 --> 05:52.760
With me, Chris.

05:52.760 --> 05:53.720
Hello, everyone.

05:53.720 --> 05:55.080
Welcome in to the office.

05:55.080 --> 05:56.800
The Office Hours are officially open.

05:56.800 --> 05:58.280
Come on in, let's chat about

05:58.280 --> 06:00.300
whatever you feel like talking about.

06:00.300 --> 06:02.680
I'm here every other Tuesday.

06:02.680 --> 06:04.000
It's a standing offer.

06:04.000 --> 06:06.440
My office door is open to you.

06:06.440 --> 06:07.560
And Brent's here with me.

06:07.560 --> 06:08.840
We're hanging out on the live stream.

06:08.840 --> 06:10.000
Hello, Brentley.

06:10.000 --> 06:11.120
Well, hello, Chris.

06:11.120 --> 06:12.360
Pleasure to be back.

06:12.360 --> 06:14.500
I am enjoying the video feed

06:14.500 --> 06:15.740
that you and I are sharing this week.

06:15.740 --> 06:17.180
Cause I get to see the drum kit

06:17.180 --> 06:18.360
that you've been learning on behind you.

06:18.360 --> 06:20.040
It's looking really awesome.

06:20.040 --> 06:20.880
Thank you.

06:20.880 --> 06:22.360
I think it looks better with me at it though.

06:22.360 --> 06:23.800
Alex just has the best setup.

06:23.800 --> 06:24.640
I know.

06:24.640 --> 06:26.840
And you know, one thing I got to say about Alex

06:26.840 --> 06:30.140
is he's great at displaying the things he loves.

06:30.140 --> 06:31.400
That's something I can learn from him.

06:31.400 --> 06:32.240
Yeah, you're right.

06:32.240 --> 06:34.240
He is, and he does this thing

06:34.240 --> 06:36.280
where things are in spots where you can see them.

06:36.280 --> 06:37.640
So you don't lose them necessarily.

06:37.640 --> 06:38.580
I mean, he has some stuff in drawers.

06:38.580 --> 06:40.260
We all do, but I like that too.

06:40.260 --> 06:42.240
Like 3D printing rules, reels.

06:42.240 --> 06:43.280
I know they're right there.

06:43.280 --> 06:44.800
Yeah, easy to find.

06:44.800 --> 06:47.280
Yeah, we're also joined by the mumble room today.

06:47.280 --> 06:48.360
We got a small mumble crew.

06:48.360 --> 06:49.560
Hey everyone in the virtual log.

06:49.560 --> 06:50.840
Hello, time appropriate greetings.

06:50.840 --> 06:51.680
Good evening.

06:51.680 --> 06:52.500
Hello Chris.

06:52.500 --> 06:53.340
Hello.

06:53.340 --> 06:54.180
Hi guys.

06:54.180 --> 06:55.000
Hello, thanks for joining us.

06:55.000 --> 06:56.440
This is the first office hours

06:56.440 --> 06:57.840
we're doing with a mumble room.

06:57.840 --> 06:59.440
And this is one of the things we want to do

06:59.440 --> 07:02.180
along with our matrix general chat room.

07:02.180 --> 07:04.400
They're just platforms for you guys to join us

07:04.400 --> 07:06.520
and get your questions in and your comments

07:06.520 --> 07:07.720
and stuff like that.

07:07.720 --> 07:10.000
We'll be watching that as we go along.

07:10.000 --> 07:12.600
I thought I'd be rushing out after the show today.

07:12.600 --> 07:13.840
This is why I just spent the extra time today.

07:13.840 --> 07:15.400
Cause I thought it'd be a rush.

07:15.400 --> 07:17.800
But I have been trying to get my lady juke's RV

07:17.800 --> 07:20.740
in for some repair work to get it ready

07:20.740 --> 07:22.580
for some road tripping this summer.

07:22.580 --> 07:25.840
And everything is so, so slammed.

07:25.840 --> 07:27.840
I went around to a bunch of different shops

07:27.840 --> 07:31.680
trying to find some place that would see us.

07:31.680 --> 07:34.400
Finally, one of our true and tried old shops.

07:34.400 --> 07:36.360
They got us in over a period of a couple of days

07:36.360 --> 07:37.180
to do the work.

07:37.180 --> 07:39.200
They were going to take care of us.

07:39.200 --> 07:40.980
They were really doing us a huge solid.

07:40.980 --> 07:42.800
Like we were going to try to get them a gift as a thank you

07:42.800 --> 07:45.960
because it was like above and beyond to try to fit us in.

07:45.960 --> 07:47.440
They called us up yesterday.

07:47.440 --> 07:50.880
And they told us that they had to fire a guy.

07:50.880 --> 07:52.520
And because they had to fire the guy,

07:52.520 --> 07:54.360
they can't fit us in anymore.

07:54.360 --> 07:57.240
And so we're back out on the streets,

07:57.240 --> 07:58.960
not going to get it fixed.

07:58.960 --> 08:00.640
Can you hire the guy they fired?

08:00.640 --> 08:01.360
I know, right?

08:01.360 --> 08:01.920
Good question.

08:01.920 --> 08:04.440
But why they fire him, I suppose, is the next question.

08:04.440 --> 08:05.000
Right.

08:05.000 --> 08:06.680
Yeah.

08:06.680 --> 08:09.840
Well, you got to find out and then just work around that.

08:09.840 --> 08:10.960
But oh, man.

08:10.960 --> 08:14.200
And I went above and beyond to get the motors

08:14.200 --> 08:16.640
that they would be installing.

08:16.640 --> 08:18.720
I pulled like every card in the book.

08:18.720 --> 08:20.480
Like I even called the place that I ordered them from.

08:20.480 --> 08:21.560
Like, I really need those.

08:21.560 --> 08:23.600
Can you ship them out super fast?

08:23.600 --> 08:26.960
I even considered paying $210 in expedited shipping

08:26.960 --> 08:28.520
because shipping is so crazy right now.

08:28.520 --> 08:32.040
And I bought a used backup one on Amazon

08:32.040 --> 08:33.920
because that was the only thing that was available

08:33.920 --> 08:35.520
because of the supply chain.

08:35.520 --> 08:37.560
But I bought a used one that thought it should make it.

08:37.560 --> 08:38.000
It should make it.

08:38.000 --> 08:38.800
It should be here.

08:38.800 --> 08:39.200
And it did.

08:39.200 --> 08:39.760
It just arrived.

08:39.760 --> 08:41.180
I mean, I just went above and beyond

08:41.180 --> 08:42.800
to get parts for this thing.

08:42.800 --> 08:47.960
And then to have it be canceled like that, it's a killer, dude.

08:47.960 --> 08:50.000
It's just like it never ends with this stuff.

08:50.000 --> 08:51.040
So that's my downer story.

08:51.040 --> 08:52.800
However, that's not going to stop us.

08:52.800 --> 08:55.680
We're taking my son Dylan on a birthday road trip

08:55.680 --> 08:57.760
down to Oregon for the weekend.

08:57.760 --> 08:59.800
I may end up doing Linux Unplugged this weekend

08:59.800 --> 09:00.960
from a beach town.

09:00.960 --> 09:02.320
I mean, that sounds pretty great.

09:02.320 --> 09:05.280
So, Brentley, it's been also a big week for you

09:05.280 --> 09:08.920
because you finally got to try out a Raspberry Pi.

09:08.920 --> 09:10.360
That's pretty exciting.

09:10.360 --> 09:11.320
It's true.

09:11.320 --> 09:12.520
Give me the whole thing.

09:12.520 --> 09:17.080
Somehow I've not ever had my hands on a Raspberry Pi, which,

09:17.080 --> 09:19.320
I don't know, is somewhat embarrassing

09:19.320 --> 09:20.880
and also very exciting.

09:20.880 --> 09:23.520
So it turns out Alex has a drawer full of them over here,

09:23.520 --> 09:27.040
and three or four of them that he hasn't been using.

09:27.040 --> 09:29.480
But one of them he had set up, which is a great setup.

09:29.480 --> 09:32.120
He's got a monitor here and a keyboard

09:32.120 --> 09:33.960
just for tinkering on stuff.

09:33.960 --> 09:37.920
So it's like a sit down, plug in whatever you want to play with.

09:37.920 --> 09:40.000
And so the Raspberry Pi, he's got one set up there

09:40.000 --> 09:42.960
he let me wipe when we were doing our Nix challenge.

09:42.960 --> 09:45.840
And so this is a Raspberry Pi 4, I believe.

09:45.840 --> 09:47.360
Of course, he has nice little cases.

09:47.360 --> 09:48.200
They're all different.

09:48.200 --> 09:50.360
He has fun with probably printing some of those

09:50.360 --> 09:51.800
or buying them.

09:51.800 --> 09:53.200
And it was great.

09:53.200 --> 09:57.560
Like, I remember the Raspberry Pi 1.

09:57.560 --> 09:59.760
People, you know, you were really excited about it

09:59.760 --> 10:02.440
and its possibilities, but it was really slow and not really

10:02.440 --> 10:04.360
great for much of a workload.

10:04.360 --> 10:07.000
But this thing was, I mean, we were running NixOS,

10:07.000 --> 10:08.320
and it was pretty light.

10:08.320 --> 10:12.120
But it seemed speedy and totally reasonable.

10:12.120 --> 10:14.680
So that just got me quite excited.

10:14.680 --> 10:17.680
And I might just slip one of these into my bag

10:17.680 --> 10:21.680
before I go and bring it home with me.

10:21.680 --> 10:23.160
The possibilities now, right?

10:23.160 --> 10:25.480
Like, you start thinking, especially, Brent,

10:25.480 --> 10:27.400
if you are in a low power situation.

10:27.400 --> 10:31.160
And when I finally convince you to adopt hashtag vanlife,

10:31.160 --> 10:33.240
you're going to be thinking about that kind of stuff.

10:33.240 --> 10:36.440
Give me an idea of what the specs were, if you can remember,

10:36.440 --> 10:38.680
and what you did with it, and what stood out to you.

10:38.680 --> 10:41.960
Because this is, it sounds silly,

10:41.960 --> 10:43.520
but I almost wish I was there for it.

10:43.520 --> 10:44.360
I know.

10:44.360 --> 10:44.960
I know.

10:44.960 --> 10:46.040
I was thinking about that.

10:46.040 --> 10:48.880
You've been saying for months that you wanted to be there.

10:48.880 --> 10:50.680
And we meant to do it when you were here,

10:50.680 --> 10:51.800
and we just never got around to it.

10:51.800 --> 10:52.840
Yeah, no, it's fine.

10:52.840 --> 10:54.400
And I'm glad you did, right?

10:54.400 --> 10:57.960
I think our community gets so focused on specs and the tech

10:57.960 --> 11:00.400
stuff that we don't really sometimes appreciate

11:00.400 --> 11:04.240
sort of the cultural impact of some of these devices.

11:04.240 --> 11:06.440
And the Raspberry Pi has made a cultural impact.

11:06.440 --> 11:09.560
It's like a line of computing that is almost its own thing

11:09.560 --> 11:10.560
in a way.

11:10.560 --> 11:12.000
It's its own kind of branch.

11:12.000 --> 11:15.960
And it's so well supported now, too,

11:15.960 --> 11:19.360
that when these things start to get to the Raspberry 5

11:19.360 --> 11:23.680
and the Pi 6, there's just going to be such awesome systems.

11:23.680 --> 11:26.120
I mean, as soon as you start taking out the SD card

11:26.120 --> 11:29.280
and you start using something more serious, like an SSD

11:29.280 --> 11:32.800
or EMMC, it changes the game on what those things can do.

11:32.800 --> 11:35.000
They're almost like storage constrained right now.

11:35.000 --> 11:36.080
So anyways, I'm just curious kind

11:36.080 --> 11:37.920
of like what details you could share with us

11:37.920 --> 11:40.960
and what you played around with, what stood out to you

11:40.960 --> 11:42.040
in that kind of stuff.

11:42.040 --> 11:43.720
What are you grabbing for it over there?

11:43.720 --> 11:44.560
It's over here.

11:44.560 --> 11:47.920
I'm trying to see if I can get any more information on it.

11:47.920 --> 11:51.440
But as far as I understand, maybe Alex will chime in here.

11:51.440 --> 11:52.960
I think it's just a standard Pi 4.

11:52.960 --> 11:55.360
Maybe it's like a 8 gig version.

11:55.360 --> 11:57.040
I honestly didn't know any better

11:57.040 --> 11:58.360
when I was running it off the SD card,

11:58.360 --> 11:59.560
and it was running just fine.

11:59.560 --> 12:02.040
You know, we weren't doing anything storage-related

12:02.040 --> 12:03.000
in terms of intensity,

12:03.000 --> 12:06.200
but I think it just opens up a whole new world

12:06.200 --> 12:07.240
of possibility.

12:07.240 --> 12:10.400
And I'm, you know, late to the game, clearly.

12:10.400 --> 12:12.120
Many of you know this already,

12:12.120 --> 12:15.520
and I've wanted to feel this, and so here we are.

12:15.520 --> 12:19.120
And so I feel like the low power usage, you know,

12:19.120 --> 12:20.640
in your situation is essential,

12:20.640 --> 12:23.400
but also I think the physical size

12:23.400 --> 12:24.680
is also really attractive.

12:24.680 --> 12:26.000
You know, it takes up hardly any space.

12:26.000 --> 12:28.360
You can hide it clearly under a desk very easily.

12:28.360 --> 12:29.320
It's super quiet.

12:29.320 --> 12:31.960
And as you know, that's a thing for me.

12:31.960 --> 12:32.800
You know?

12:32.800 --> 12:33.640
I don't know.

12:33.640 --> 12:36.120
I kind of want to build like a podcasting box

12:36.120 --> 12:37.120
out of this thing.

12:37.120 --> 12:38.480
I've had that thought too.

12:38.480 --> 12:40.960
It might be possible to replace the Reaper machine,

12:40.960 --> 12:42.920
just the Reaper function with a Pi 4.

12:42.920 --> 12:45.160
Oh, that's saying something.

12:45.160 --> 12:47.240
They make Reaper for the Pi.

12:47.240 --> 12:49.720
They have a build that works on the Pi, yeah.

12:49.720 --> 12:50.560
That is so cool.

12:50.560 --> 12:52.480
That's our recording tool that we use.

12:52.480 --> 12:53.960
Oh, it's in a GeekWorm aluminum case,

12:53.960 --> 12:55.320
which is an awesome aluminum case.

12:55.320 --> 12:57.440
It's a Pi 4, 4 gigabyte,

12:57.440 --> 12:59.920
according to the Badger in the chat room there.

12:59.920 --> 13:01.680
Thank you, Badger Badger.

13:01.680 --> 13:03.040
Roger that, Badger Badger.

13:03.040 --> 13:05.520
Well, that's really cool, dude.

13:05.520 --> 13:06.840
I'm glad you finally got to do it.

13:06.840 --> 13:10.360
And you know, we still, I did find that camera module.

13:10.360 --> 13:11.200
So.

13:11.200 --> 13:12.040
Nice.

13:12.040 --> 13:15.280
So maybe we can build a DSLR out of one of them.

13:15.280 --> 13:17.240
Or a webcam or maybe a streamer.

13:17.240 --> 13:18.080
I don't know.

13:18.080 --> 13:20.720
You could stream your yard, your backyard.

13:20.720 --> 13:23.840
I did want to say thank you to all the listeners

13:23.840 --> 13:28.040
who were willing to, you know, send me a Pi

13:28.040 --> 13:29.600
or let me play with one.

13:29.600 --> 13:31.960
Especially New West, he asked me about five times

13:31.960 --> 13:34.360
in the last month when I was going to come pick it up.

13:34.360 --> 13:38.000
I think he was just as excited as me for that experience.

13:38.000 --> 13:40.920
So New West, I'm going to still come hang out with you

13:40.920 --> 13:42.400
and grab it and we can, I don't know,

13:42.400 --> 13:43.800
create some kind of project with it.

13:43.800 --> 13:47.560
Build a Pi empire, an empire of Pis.

13:47.560 --> 13:49.440
Empire, that's real nice.

13:49.440 --> 13:50.360
Yeah, you like that?

13:50.360 --> 13:51.200
Uh-huh.

13:51.200 --> 13:52.040
Uh-huh.

13:52.040 --> 13:52.880
All right, well, there you go.

13:52.880 --> 13:53.720
So let's move on.

13:53.720 --> 13:55.720
We have a little podcasting news

13:55.720 --> 13:58.200
that I want to just touch on briefly

13:58.200 --> 13:59.600
before we get into JB News.

14:00.920 --> 14:04.080
I love what the Podcasting 2.0 folks are doing.

14:05.280 --> 14:07.520
Adam Curry, Dave Jones, and everyone that's contributing

14:07.520 --> 14:09.760
to the Podcasting 2.0 standard.

14:09.760 --> 14:12.240
It is bringing a set of features.

14:12.240 --> 14:16.400
It's standardizing things like chapters, transcripts,

14:16.400 --> 14:19.600
the ability to display images in line with content

14:19.600 --> 14:22.320
if you want, a whole range of stuff,

14:22.320 --> 14:24.800
including the value tag and a bunch of stuff.

14:24.800 --> 14:26.960
But one of the things they're working on now

14:26.960 --> 14:29.120
is a podcast medium tag.

14:30.000 --> 14:31.160
Now this is an interesting idea

14:31.160 --> 14:34.400
because it essentially is a signal

14:34.400 --> 14:38.280
that the feed can give to a podcast player UI.

14:38.280 --> 14:40.680
And maybe it's a web UI, maybe it's an app, right?

14:40.680 --> 14:44.160
But it's a signal that the app can read to say

14:44.160 --> 14:47.680
this isn't a podcast or it is a podcast.

14:47.680 --> 14:49.920
It is a music album or it's a podcast

14:49.920 --> 14:52.000
or it's an audio book, for example.

14:52.000 --> 14:54.840
And so the interface of the podcast player

14:54.840 --> 14:57.840
could actually potentially adapt

14:57.840 --> 14:59.960
to suit maybe like a music album.

14:59.960 --> 15:03.440
Like maybe a music album is more appropriate

15:03.440 --> 15:05.840
for somebody who's releasing tracks

15:05.840 --> 15:06.680
over a period of weeks.

15:06.680 --> 15:08.000
You could see like an artist

15:08.000 --> 15:09.680
who's working on a value for value system

15:09.680 --> 15:13.280
is creating songs weekly and then releasing them.

15:13.280 --> 15:15.880
And the podcast player could automatically,

15:15.880 --> 15:18.760
if it supported this tag, and the tag will be available,

15:18.760 --> 15:20.520
could automatically select the UI

15:20.520 --> 15:23.280
that best displays albums for music.

15:23.280 --> 15:25.800
And it could be a whole new way of using podcasting.

15:25.800 --> 15:27.360
That is so cool.

15:27.360 --> 15:28.840
Is it a podcast?

15:28.840 --> 15:30.080
I think so, but I don't know.

15:30.080 --> 15:32.080
What is a podcast, you know?

15:32.080 --> 15:32.960
Yeah.

15:32.960 --> 15:37.320
I feel like for things like weekly released audio books

15:37.320 --> 15:39.040
and such, that would be a really neat feature too

15:39.040 --> 15:40.600
to have your interface change a little bit

15:40.600 --> 15:43.000
because you want some different features

15:43.000 --> 15:44.200
when you're listening to those.

15:44.200 --> 15:46.000
So it sounds really cool.

15:46.000 --> 15:49.360
Yeah, and some book authors who have self-published

15:49.360 --> 15:51.960
have also used, maybe they're also podcasters,

15:51.960 --> 15:53.440
so they'll use their podcasting setup

15:53.440 --> 15:55.000
to record an audio book.

15:55.000 --> 15:57.680
And maybe this is a way to release that,

15:57.680 --> 15:59.040
especially if they're already a podcaster.

15:59.040 --> 15:59.880
Why not?

15:59.880 --> 16:00.720
Yeah.

16:00.720 --> 16:02.360
I love seeing this kind of stuff land.

16:02.360 --> 16:04.120
If you haven't checked out the podcast index,

16:04.120 --> 16:06.640
podcastindex.org, this is the new place

16:06.640 --> 16:08.360
to find podcasts in my opinion.

16:08.360 --> 16:11.720
They have over four million shows indexed now.

16:11.720 --> 16:14.160
The entire idea is to sort of decentralize

16:14.160 --> 16:18.160
this critical function of discovery in podcasting, right?

16:18.160 --> 16:19.440
Because right now that's kind of locked up

16:19.440 --> 16:21.240
by Apple and Spotify.

16:21.240 --> 16:23.040
And so the idea with Podcast Index

16:23.040 --> 16:28.040
is to create a neutral Switzerland of podcast indexes

16:28.120 --> 16:32.200
and then add new features that are created

16:32.200 --> 16:36.200
by an open source community and done out in the open

16:36.200 --> 16:38.000
and talked about out in the open

16:38.000 --> 16:40.880
and discussed on their podcasting 2.0 podcast

16:40.880 --> 16:44.440
and on their Mastodon instance and on GitHub.

16:44.440 --> 16:47.040
And so it's transparent, which is really great to see.

16:47.040 --> 16:50.200
And so like, again, we're thinking long-term here,

16:50.200 --> 16:52.560
where do we want this thing to go?

16:52.560 --> 16:56.440
I think podcastingindex.org is a great initiative.

16:56.440 --> 17:00.240
And the fact that it's also Adam Curry's on there

17:00.240 --> 17:05.240
and he has been an absolute essential player

17:05.320 --> 17:07.000
in making podcasts a thing,

17:07.000 --> 17:08.960
in creating the media tags necessary

17:08.960 --> 17:11.680
to make podcasting work with RSS feeds.

17:11.680 --> 17:15.400
And so to see him kind of be involved in podcasting 2.0

17:15.400 --> 17:17.120
I think is also a really good sign.

17:17.120 --> 17:18.720
And I don't know, really as a creator,

17:18.720 --> 17:19.760
I'm just really jazzed about it.

17:19.760 --> 17:21.400
And I kind of talk about it right now

17:21.400 --> 17:24.080
because it doesn't seem like it gets much acknowledgement

17:24.080 --> 17:25.440
in our community.

17:25.440 --> 17:27.240
And I mean, Linux community by that.

17:27.240 --> 17:28.520
And I'm curious to know if you think

17:28.520 --> 17:29.720
maybe I'm being critical here, Brent,

17:29.720 --> 17:31.920
but it seems like in my opinion,

17:31.920 --> 17:35.800
there's so much going on in Linux and in free software

17:35.800 --> 17:38.840
that our community has kind of gotten

17:38.840 --> 17:40.760
a little bit of tunnel vision.

17:40.760 --> 17:43.600
And we've kind of forgotten to think critically

17:43.600 --> 17:46.400
about things like decentralization of services.

17:46.400 --> 17:49.400
And we've kind of stopped looking at free software

17:49.400 --> 17:51.040
as anything beyond the Linux space.

17:51.040 --> 17:52.840
And we kind of think of free software as Linux stuff,

17:52.840 --> 17:57.840
but things like podcasting standards and RSS specs

17:57.880 --> 18:01.320
and cryptocurrencies, those aren't free software.

18:01.320 --> 18:03.040
Those are bad technology, right?

18:03.040 --> 18:05.720
Like there's some serious tunnel vision in our community.

18:05.720 --> 18:08.000
And I feel like the podcasting stuff

18:08.000 --> 18:10.680
kind of parallels a lot of that

18:10.680 --> 18:13.440
is you'd think probably people in the Linux

18:13.440 --> 18:16.720
and open source community would be a little more fired up

18:16.720 --> 18:19.560
about maybe decentralizing our content off of YouTube,

18:19.560 --> 18:21.840
Spotify and Apple, but it doesn't really seem

18:21.840 --> 18:24.080
to ever come up outside of when we're talking about it.

18:24.080 --> 18:25.600
So I guess I kind of feel like

18:25.600 --> 18:27.480
we gotta keep talking about it.

18:27.480 --> 18:28.440
Am I off on this?

18:28.440 --> 18:29.880
Am I, what do you think?

18:29.880 --> 18:31.640
I think you're right about the open source thing.

18:31.640 --> 18:34.480
It feels like our ideals are more than just

18:34.480 --> 18:35.720
some of the software we use.

18:35.720 --> 18:37.640
And maybe we've had it too good

18:37.640 --> 18:39.880
in that RSS has been around forever.

18:39.880 --> 18:42.320
And we've just taken it for granted.

18:42.320 --> 18:45.360
But yeah, for Apple and Spotify

18:45.360 --> 18:48.960
to kind of start to be eating everybody up

18:48.960 --> 18:50.200
is a little bit scary.

18:50.200 --> 18:52.600
And I feel like anything we can do

18:52.600 --> 18:54.760
to get excited about the open stuff

18:54.760 --> 18:57.440
in a variety of different realms in our life

18:57.440 --> 19:01.320
is essential and super, super interesting too.

19:01.320 --> 19:04.800
Like if you think about how much new technology

19:04.800 --> 19:07.160
is coming out just on the RSS technology,

19:07.160 --> 19:08.960
it's like kind of crazy.

19:08.960 --> 19:10.640
I didn't think it was going to evolve anymore,

19:10.640 --> 19:12.320
but all of a sudden we're getting this insight

19:12.320 --> 19:15.240
into all these new, just all these new little tags,

19:15.240 --> 19:17.320
like this podcast medium tag is like,

19:17.320 --> 19:19.280
this technology we've had for a long time is evolving.

19:19.280 --> 19:20.800
It's really fascinating to see.

19:20.800 --> 19:23.440
So I hope everybody can get excited about it.

19:23.440 --> 19:25.000
Yeah, and I think you could argue

19:25.000 --> 19:26.760
the core functionality is still great.

19:26.760 --> 19:27.720
Yeah.

19:27.720 --> 19:30.320
It does a good job of delivering new shows

19:30.320 --> 19:32.040
with show notes and all of that.

19:32.040 --> 19:35.080
The question is, is there room for improvement?

19:35.080 --> 19:36.200
I'd argue, yeah.

19:36.200 --> 19:39.280
I think transcripts would be great for podcasting.

19:39.280 --> 19:40.520
One of the things that's actually kept me

19:40.520 --> 19:44.920
on Fountain FM is the transcripting is really nice,

19:44.920 --> 19:47.560
and that is a handy feature for searching.

19:47.560 --> 19:50.400
And I realized if we could transcribe all of the JB shows

19:50.400 --> 19:51.520
and make those searchable

19:51.520 --> 19:55.120
on our notes.jupitabroadcasting.com search page,

19:55.120 --> 19:56.880
that would mean you could no longer,

19:56.880 --> 19:58.600
you wouldn't just be searching the tags

19:58.600 --> 20:00.440
and the links and the description,

20:00.440 --> 20:02.360
but you could go inside the shows.

20:02.360 --> 20:03.800
And so to build a standard around that,

20:03.800 --> 20:04.800
like if we want to do that,

20:04.800 --> 20:06.960
I'd like to do it in a way that's in a standard

20:06.960 --> 20:08.600
that all clients could support.

20:08.600 --> 20:11.720
And chapters, you could see a reason for this.

20:11.720 --> 20:13.440
So I'm very excited to see them do it.

20:13.440 --> 20:15.520
And we had a good boost that came into the show,

20:15.520 --> 20:16.840
which I'll read in full later,

20:16.840 --> 20:18.440
but they're like, I get where you're going

20:18.440 --> 20:20.760
with your concerns, but focus on the positive.

20:20.760 --> 20:22.560
And I think that's great advice.

20:22.560 --> 20:23.640
And so that's what I want to start doing

20:23.640 --> 20:25.120
is I kind of want to start looking at

20:25.120 --> 20:27.080
who's moving this forward in the right direction more.

20:27.080 --> 20:28.600
I want to talk about that more.

20:28.600 --> 20:29.840
I mean, when there's major concerns I have,

20:29.840 --> 20:30.680
I'm still going to bring it up.

20:30.680 --> 20:32.680
But that's kind of my thinking is we're going to try

20:32.680 --> 20:35.840
to look at this from a more positive angle.

20:35.840 --> 20:38.240
Like if we focus on these things and we do these things,

20:38.240 --> 20:39.760
we're going to get this going in the right direction.

20:39.760 --> 20:43.480
And I don't know, it's not all together yet, Brent,

20:43.480 --> 20:48.200
but I can't help but feel like podcasting 2.0

20:48.200 --> 20:51.080
and the Lightning Network and Matrix

20:51.080 --> 20:54.480
and all of it being decentralized

20:54.480 --> 20:56.960
probably is important right now in a way that it never has.

20:56.960 --> 20:59.120
And when you look at, you look at everyone's freaking out

20:59.120 --> 21:01.960
about Elon by on Twitter, and it shows you just again,

21:01.960 --> 21:03.760
not to really beat on this, but just shows you again,

21:03.760 --> 21:06.640
like centralization bites us in the butt

21:06.640 --> 21:08.760
over and over and over again.

21:08.760 --> 21:10.360
And I just feel like there's something here

21:10.360 --> 21:14.000
we're working on and it's still in its proto stage.

21:14.000 --> 21:15.320
But do you feel it?

21:15.320 --> 21:16.400
It's something coming together

21:16.400 --> 21:18.760
and it's these decentralized technologies.

21:18.760 --> 21:21.160
I have a question on that topic.

21:21.160 --> 21:23.200
The podcast index kind of feels

21:23.200 --> 21:26.040
like another centralized space.

21:26.040 --> 21:28.680
How is that contributing to the decentralization

21:28.680 --> 21:31.200
or is it just another single library?

21:31.200 --> 21:32.720
Boy, we could really get into this.

21:32.720 --> 21:35.360
But the backend is essentially a decentralized way.

21:35.360 --> 21:39.960
The way that you update the system of new podcast releases,

21:39.960 --> 21:43.320
the way that all of that is using the Hive blockchain,

21:43.320 --> 21:45.240
and that is actually decentralized.

21:45.240 --> 21:48.520
The part that is the centralization of the podcast index

21:48.520 --> 21:53.520
would be the LLC that Adam and Dave run behind the scenes,

21:55.120 --> 21:57.480
but that is also replaceable.

21:57.480 --> 21:59.680
It's built in a modular way

21:59.680 --> 22:01.160
where that component could be removed

22:01.160 --> 22:02.880
and the community would continue to exist

22:02.880 --> 22:06.040
because most of the active conversations and control

22:06.040 --> 22:09.120
are happening on GitHub and on Mastodon.

22:09.120 --> 22:10.200
And there's things that happen

22:10.200 --> 22:12.400
that are just completely outside the LLC.

22:12.400 --> 22:14.040
They don't drive it.

22:14.040 --> 22:15.400
There's all kinds of development happening

22:15.400 --> 22:17.440
that they are not necessarily the ones behind.

22:17.440 --> 22:19.960
But there does have to be some sort of interface

22:19.960 --> 22:23.360
with the traditional banks and buying the domain name

22:23.360 --> 22:24.720
and paying for the server hosting.

22:24.720 --> 22:27.680
And so there is that centralized component.

22:27.680 --> 22:31.240
But I would argue that that LLC with a couple of people

22:31.240 --> 22:33.400
that are running something that is decentralized

22:33.400 --> 22:35.520
and being maintained by an open source community

22:35.520 --> 22:37.880
is a way different risk profile

22:37.880 --> 22:40.480
than your Spotify, Apple, YouTube.

22:40.480 --> 22:42.240
It's almost negligent in its risk,

22:42.240 --> 22:44.160
but it is worth thinking about.

22:44.160 --> 22:45.000
That's fascinating.

22:45.000 --> 22:46.560
I can't wait to see where they go

22:46.560 --> 22:48.040
even in the next few years

22:48.040 --> 22:49.560
considering how much work they're putting in.

22:49.560 --> 22:52.000
The pace of development is astonishing.

22:52.000 --> 22:53.120
It's really impressive.

22:53.120 --> 22:54.160
I absolutely love it.

22:54.160 --> 22:58.640
And the bottleneck will be the app developers.

22:58.640 --> 22:59.920
That's gonna be the bottleneck,

22:59.920 --> 23:01.840
but it kind of makes sense in a way

23:01.840 --> 23:03.000
because you're gonna have some apps

23:03.000 --> 23:04.280
that are maybe a little more aggressive

23:04.280 --> 23:06.920
in their feature focus and other apps that are less.

23:06.920 --> 23:09.440
And you'll have users kind of try those features out

23:09.440 --> 23:11.680
and somebody said in the matrix room,

23:11.680 --> 23:12.560
I think it makes a lot of sense.

23:12.560 --> 23:14.080
Like you gotta have somebody drive over the potholes

23:14.080 --> 23:14.920
to report them, right?

23:14.920 --> 23:16.920
And we're gonna be driving over some potholes

23:16.920 --> 23:17.760
for a little bit.

23:17.760 --> 23:19.360
That's just the reality of it.

23:19.360 --> 23:21.560
It reminds me a little bit of where Matrix is right now.

23:21.560 --> 23:24.920
Really, it's trying to accomplish something similar somewhat.

23:24.920 --> 23:26.720
It's the interfaces that feel like

23:26.720 --> 23:28.480
they're kind of not quite there,

23:28.480 --> 23:30.480
but we gotta use them to improve them.

23:30.480 --> 23:32.160
And so it feels like kind of the same

23:32.160 --> 23:34.040
for the Podcast 2.0 stuff.

23:34.040 --> 23:35.840
Yeah, and you can see the trend.

23:35.840 --> 23:38.460
You can see the reasons, the rationale.

23:38.460 --> 23:42.120
So, you know, yeah, it helps.

23:42.120 --> 23:44.200
Okay, so we have,

23:44.200 --> 23:46.000
this was another inspiration for the show.

23:46.000 --> 23:47.280
It's fun having a new show again.

23:47.280 --> 23:48.920
Like I haven't had a new show in a while.

23:48.920 --> 23:49.760
This is great.

23:49.760 --> 23:50.640
You really jazzed about it.

23:50.640 --> 23:52.400
Yeah, this is fun.

23:52.400 --> 23:55.440
Last new show was self-hosted, I guess, right?

23:55.440 --> 23:56.280
It's been a while.

23:56.280 --> 23:57.120
Still a great show.

23:57.120 --> 23:57.960
It's been a minute.

23:57.960 --> 23:58.780
It's been great.

23:58.780 --> 24:01.200
It's still my baby, but it walks on its own now.

24:01.200 --> 24:02.040
You know?

24:02.040 --> 24:05.240
Right now, this is still in the cradle.

24:05.240 --> 24:07.320
But we had an opportunity to like,

24:07.320 --> 24:08.240
well, we have to.

24:08.240 --> 24:09.700
It's not so much an opportunity, but it is.

24:09.700 --> 24:11.320
We've been wanting to do it for a long time.

24:11.320 --> 24:15.280
But we have to rebuild and replace jupitabroadcasting.com.

24:15.280 --> 24:17.840
I mean, it's been in desperate need for a very long time,

24:17.840 --> 24:20.460
but Scale Engine, our host, God bless him,

24:20.460 --> 24:22.680
has decided to get out of WordPress hosting.

24:22.680 --> 24:25.680
So now's the time.

24:25.680 --> 24:29.540
And we want to do it right, and we have a lot of ideas,

24:29.540 --> 24:31.880
but we want to open up this conversation to the community

24:31.880 --> 24:33.960
while we're at the ground floor.

24:33.960 --> 24:36.440
We've got a rough framework of how we want to do it,

24:36.440 --> 24:39.880
but we want to run it past everyone and get your input.

24:39.880 --> 24:43.440
Brent has set up a GitHub page for jupitabroadcasting.com,

24:43.440 --> 24:45.680
or somebody did, but Brent's watching it now.

24:45.680 --> 24:47.360
And people can go there to open up issues

24:47.360 --> 24:48.320
and start conversation.

24:48.320 --> 24:50.160
Is there any hot tips we want to relay?

24:50.160 --> 24:52.760
It's like github.com slash jupitabroadcasting.

24:52.760 --> 24:54.360
Yeah, there are a few projects there.

24:54.360 --> 24:56.160
There's one called jupitabroadcasting.com.

24:56.160 --> 24:57.880
It seems like the reasonable place to go.

24:57.880 --> 25:02.240
So we have some issue tracking there.

25:02.240 --> 25:04.160
There are some issues with the current website,

25:04.160 --> 25:05.520
which are important to know.

25:05.520 --> 25:06.680
And I threw some in there.

25:06.680 --> 25:08.960
There's a lot of them, so that's helpful.

25:08.960 --> 25:12.240
But also, maybe I'll open up a discussion, a GitHub discussion,

25:12.240 --> 25:14.980
and we can just start having conversation

25:14.980 --> 25:17.280
about what the future website could be.

25:17.280 --> 25:19.240
And that's a great place to throw ideas.

25:19.240 --> 25:21.240
Yeah, feedback on this episode.

25:21.240 --> 25:24.860
Nate, title it like Office 3 Website Feedback Thread,

25:24.860 --> 25:26.560
or something like that, if that makes sense.

25:26.560 --> 25:28.280
And we'll put a link in the show notes.

25:28.280 --> 25:34.560
But Brent and I had a chance to sit down with Alex and Wes

25:34.560 --> 25:36.280
and welcome them into the office.

25:36.280 --> 25:40.240
And this was just after Linux Unplugged on Sunday.

25:40.240 --> 25:42.660
And I wanted to play our conversation that we had

25:42.660 --> 25:44.120
while they were in the office.

25:44.120 --> 26:08.880
I'm joined by some friends to talk about our plans

26:08.880 --> 26:12.960
for the summer and our new website that we're developing.

26:12.960 --> 26:15.000
And we haven't really dialed it all in yet.

26:15.000 --> 26:18.360
So I think this is both the right moment and possibly

26:18.360 --> 26:20.920
the worst moment to open it up to the community

26:20.920 --> 26:24.600
and discuss what we see as the future of the Jupyter

26:24.600 --> 26:25.800
Broadcasting web domains.

26:25.800 --> 26:27.220
Because we've got a lot of websites.

26:27.220 --> 26:28.220
We've got a big mess.

26:28.220 --> 26:30.640
I think everyone agrees, far too many.

26:30.640 --> 26:33.220
Yeah, and it's a legacy install that we've been running forever

26:33.220 --> 26:34.600
on Scale Engine.

26:34.600 --> 26:36.400
And they've let us know that they're

26:36.400 --> 26:38.320
getting out of the WordPress hosting business.

26:38.320 --> 26:40.240
They don't want to host our horrible WordPress.

26:40.240 --> 26:42.320
We don't want to host our horrible WordPress.

26:42.320 --> 26:43.600
Something has to go.

26:43.600 --> 26:47.020
So as a group, Wes, Brent, Alex, and I

26:47.020 --> 26:49.520
have been talking about what we want to see.

26:49.520 --> 26:53.380
And simplicity, I think, keeps coming up over and over again.

26:53.380 --> 26:56.400
Speed keeps coming up over and over again.

26:56.400 --> 26:58.800
And the recognition that most of the audience,

26:58.800 --> 27:01.240
when they interact with any of the JB properties,

27:01.240 --> 27:03.280
they're interacting on their mobile device

27:03.280 --> 27:06.200
in their podcast app most of the time.

27:06.200 --> 27:07.680
And we've been brainstorming ways

27:07.680 --> 27:10.700
to create a static website, maybe even

27:10.700 --> 27:13.520
a website that doesn't even have a CMS behind it,

27:13.520 --> 27:15.880
or a very light CMS behind it.

27:15.880 --> 27:18.080
Something that we could programmatically generate

27:18.080 --> 27:20.340
as a new episode comes out.

27:20.340 --> 27:22.120
And I think we've looked at a lot of things.

27:22.120 --> 27:23.040
We've looked at Hugo.

27:23.040 --> 27:24.760
We've looked at MKDocs.

27:24.760 --> 27:26.560
We've looked at a lot of different back ends.

27:26.560 --> 27:28.440
We've looked at ways of integrating

27:28.440 --> 27:30.080
GitHub and GitHub Actions.

27:30.080 --> 27:31.700
Do you have a, in your mind, Wes,

27:31.700 --> 27:35.520
where is our state of the website conversation

27:35.520 --> 27:37.060
from your perspective?

27:37.060 --> 27:39.360
Well, I think we've been discussing where the website

27:39.360 --> 27:42.000
fits, like you say, right?

27:42.000 --> 27:43.800
On one level, we've got the feeds.

27:43.800 --> 27:46.540
And the feeds ultimately kind of control what users

27:46.540 --> 27:48.920
in the podcast apps see.

27:48.920 --> 27:51.240
But we've got sort of parallel infrastructure

27:51.240 --> 27:53.400
in that we've got a main page if you want to check out

27:53.400 --> 27:54.440
the video versions.

27:54.440 --> 27:57.040
Or you've heard about us, you check out our website.

27:57.040 --> 27:58.560
When you go to jupyterbroadcasting.com,

27:58.560 --> 28:00.120
that's the first thing you do.

28:00.120 --> 28:02.200
Plus, we've got sort of ancillary resources,

28:02.200 --> 28:05.080
like the calendar and the increasingly important live

28:05.080 --> 28:05.960
page.

28:05.960 --> 28:08.200
Context pages are another one.

28:08.200 --> 28:10.000
A lot of little subsites, donation sites,

28:10.000 --> 28:11.440
little tiny little subsites.

28:11.440 --> 28:13.280
And we've also seen a lot of stuff

28:13.280 --> 28:15.800
that has been thrown out so far, tools we've kind of taken

28:15.800 --> 28:19.000
a preliminary look at.

28:19.000 --> 28:20.600
A lot of stuff evolves around you're

28:20.600 --> 28:22.320
wanting to make one RSS feed.

28:22.320 --> 28:24.080
You're trying to host one podcast.

28:24.080 --> 28:27.560
But we've got that part kind of taken care of right now.

28:27.560 --> 28:29.900
Things we'd like to see improved is a more cohesive

28:29.900 --> 28:31.440
representation across shows, sort

28:31.440 --> 28:33.060
of sharing some of those resources,

28:33.060 --> 28:36.640
making the same workflow work, but having enough flexibility

28:36.640 --> 28:39.920
to account for things like we've got premium versions for folks

28:39.920 --> 28:42.320
that subscribe and want to get the shows ad free.

28:42.320 --> 28:45.040
They share a lot, but they're just subtly different enough.

28:45.040 --> 28:47.320
Not all platforms have the flexibility to account for that.

28:47.320 --> 28:48.560
Or old archive shows.

28:48.560 --> 28:49.640
Maybe we want to make it clear these

28:49.640 --> 28:51.520
are no longer in production, but if you'd like to listen

28:51.520 --> 28:52.560
to them, you can.

28:52.560 --> 28:54.440
Or things like the Mumble info.

28:54.440 --> 28:56.560
We use the Mumble room across multiple shows,

28:56.560 --> 28:59.000
but we only have the Mumble info on the Linux Unplugged page.

28:59.000 --> 29:00.440
Or the Matrix server information.

29:00.440 --> 29:03.000
That's only at linuxunplugged.com slash matrix,

29:03.000 --> 29:04.400
because we don't have a great way

29:04.400 --> 29:07.800
to just build that kind of page for JupiterBroadcasting.com.

29:07.800 --> 29:10.440
And those pages, like the live page, like the Mumble page,

29:10.440 --> 29:12.920
like a donation page, like the contact page,

29:12.920 --> 29:17.640
they change maybe four times a year, right?

29:17.640 --> 29:18.240
That's just it.

29:18.240 --> 29:21.000
I mean, yeah, the cadence of changes isn't crazy high.

29:21.000 --> 29:23.800
And that's where something like either a very light CMS

29:23.800 --> 29:26.920
or no CMS at all starts to make sense, because we just,

29:26.920 --> 29:29.200
besides the hosts of the shows and the editors,

29:29.200 --> 29:31.740
there's not that many hands involved.

29:31.740 --> 29:32.280
There's some.

29:32.280 --> 29:33.660
There's some we need to account for,

29:33.660 --> 29:35.040
and the workflows involved do need

29:35.040 --> 29:36.280
to work for everyone involved.

29:36.280 --> 29:39.040
But I think we have a lot of flexibility in that regard.

29:39.040 --> 29:40.800
Yeah, and one of the things we're thinking about

29:40.800 --> 29:42.220
is, how can our show docs, the ones

29:42.220 --> 29:43.920
that have the description on the links,

29:43.920 --> 29:46.960
how could that be a source of truth for an episode post?

29:46.960 --> 29:48.720
And one of the things that we've realized

29:48.720 --> 29:51.720
has worked pretty well is, Alex, you, and was it the orange one?

29:51.720 --> 29:54.360
You set up notes.JupiterBroadcasting.com,

29:54.360 --> 29:56.080
which is MKDocs based.

29:56.080 --> 29:56.840
Yeah, that's right.

29:56.840 --> 29:58.760
And the way we have to do that at the minute,

29:58.760 --> 30:02.000
because the back end we use to publish the shows

30:02.000 --> 30:03.880
doesn't have a real API that we can query.

30:03.880 --> 30:05.560
We're actually using a library in Python

30:05.560 --> 30:08.660
called BeautifulSoup to walk through the HTML of the damn

30:08.660 --> 30:11.840
web pages, reverse engineer the tags, and pull those out,

30:11.840 --> 30:14.920
and then spit those out into a statically generated website

30:14.920 --> 30:16.160
using MKDocs.

30:16.160 --> 30:16.660
Right.

30:16.660 --> 30:19.280
So that may be one area we can start with just right away,

30:19.280 --> 30:21.500
is we've got some tooling on the back end

30:21.500 --> 30:23.440
that we might be able to get.

30:23.440 --> 30:25.760
Turn that into a database that we control ourselves,

30:25.760 --> 30:28.000
or just a pure data representation

30:28.000 --> 30:29.480
that we store in version control,

30:29.480 --> 30:30.840
and then can feed some other tools

30:30.840 --> 30:33.580
that generate our notes, that generate whatever, you know,

30:33.580 --> 30:35.200
JB main page site that we want.

30:35.200 --> 30:36.880
Maybe that just links to the note site.

30:36.880 --> 30:39.720
Then we've got to kind of decide exactly what we want

30:39.720 --> 30:41.200
all the experiences to be.

30:41.200 --> 30:42.120
Yeah.

30:42.120 --> 30:44.440
Yeah, because the MKDocs is plain

30:44.440 --> 30:46.240
isn't probably the right way to describe it,

30:46.240 --> 30:50.920
but it's not particularly visually complicated either.

30:50.920 --> 30:52.160
I mean, it's good and bad that way.

30:52.160 --> 30:54.160
I mean, it's very, especially for docs, right?

30:54.160 --> 30:57.200
Like, it is a very consistent, easy to digest website,

30:57.200 --> 31:00.440
which is awesome, but it's not maybe all the branding.

31:00.440 --> 31:03.320
The main thing we wanted for that was easy search.

31:03.320 --> 31:06.020
And for example, in LUP that we recorded

31:06.020 --> 31:07.960
just a few minutes ago,

31:07.960 --> 31:10.840
I wanted to look up the last time we mentioned Wallabag,

31:10.840 --> 31:12.480
or Mini Flux, I think it was.

31:12.480 --> 31:14.380
And I just searched that keyword and boom,

31:14.380 --> 31:15.220
it was right there.

31:15.220 --> 31:17.640
And for me as a host, a podcast host, it's very useful,

31:17.640 --> 31:19.360
but also for audience members, it's useful.

31:19.360 --> 31:20.960
I get people posting in our Discord,

31:20.960 --> 31:23.280
self-hosted Discord all the time saying,

31:23.280 --> 31:25.700
oh, I found this on the notes website, it's right here.

31:25.700 --> 31:28.180
And that's very helpful.

31:28.180 --> 31:29.020
You could see too,

31:29.020 --> 31:30.920
how that might even become more powerful

31:30.920 --> 31:34.280
if some point we had transcripts that that could index.

31:34.280 --> 31:35.120
Now you're talking.

31:35.120 --> 31:36.560
Yeah, I can see that being nice.

31:36.560 --> 31:38.520
So my thought has always been like,

31:38.520 --> 31:42.040
how great would it be if from a host standpoint,

31:42.040 --> 31:43.320
when we're done recording the show,

31:43.320 --> 31:45.360
we get the doc in the right shape,

31:45.360 --> 31:48.440
and then the post for the website

31:48.440 --> 31:50.640
is generated from that doc.

31:50.640 --> 31:52.120
And I don't know exactly what that looks like.

31:52.120 --> 31:55.600
Perhaps it's some sort of custom parser that we develop.

31:55.600 --> 31:58.040
And maybe it's some sort of like GitHub action system

31:58.040 --> 32:01.200
that notices when such and such has been updated,

32:01.200 --> 32:03.400
go generate a new Hugo website or something.

32:03.400 --> 32:05.280
Like that could be a direction we go.

32:05.280 --> 32:06.400
I think one thing we need to figure out

32:06.400 --> 32:09.280
is some of the stuff we get from our current CMS

32:09.280 --> 32:12.140
allows a little bit more of an ad hoc workflow

32:12.140 --> 32:15.240
for things like guests or sponsors,

32:15.240 --> 32:17.340
that kind of thing where it is structured stuff

32:17.340 --> 32:20.280
that gets somewhat get shared between at least episodes,

32:20.280 --> 32:23.080
and if not shows, which is maybe what we'd really want.

32:23.080 --> 32:24.200
Yeah, yeah.

32:24.200 --> 32:25.480
So are you defining that each time,

32:25.480 --> 32:26.880
or do we have a separate sort of structure

32:26.880 --> 32:28.760
where you can kind of define a guest often,

32:28.760 --> 32:29.840
and then you have to go,

32:29.840 --> 32:33.320
your edit then becomes two markdown files,

32:33.320 --> 32:35.480
or are you adding these to GitHub repo?

32:35.480 --> 32:37.240
Is it, you just leave it in Hdocs?

32:37.240 --> 32:40.480
What's the kind of flow between you writing the file

32:40.480 --> 32:42.600
and getting it all the way through?

32:42.600 --> 32:45.900
And also if you have a guest, as we do it right now,

32:45.900 --> 32:48.680
on the main show feed,

32:48.680 --> 32:50.840
you then have to go and add them into the members feed

32:50.840 --> 32:55.840
as two entire separate transactions for us as admins to do.

32:55.840 --> 32:57.400
Right, right.

32:57.400 --> 32:58.880
Yeah, we've also been talking,

32:58.880 --> 33:02.560
like this is probably not part of this,

33:02.560 --> 33:04.760
but there has been multiple times

33:04.760 --> 33:07.640
in just the last few months where it would be a lot nicer

33:07.640 --> 33:09.880
if we were generating all of the RSS feeds.

33:09.880 --> 33:10.920
It's a pain in the butt though,

33:10.920 --> 33:12.360
and it's a lot of responsibility,

33:12.360 --> 33:14.160
and if you get it wrong,

33:14.160 --> 33:16.160
you've essentially just taken your network offline.

33:16.160 --> 33:17.080
So.

33:17.080 --> 33:18.120
But that's maybe part of this,

33:18.120 --> 33:19.400
is trying to figure out the right approach

33:19.400 --> 33:21.280
where we can take pieces of it,

33:21.280 --> 33:24.720
and you know, do as order requires here, right?

33:24.720 --> 33:26.040
Get the website up and going,

33:26.040 --> 33:28.280
but then know down the line that we've built things

33:28.280 --> 33:30.360
in a way that we can start doing the generation

33:30.360 --> 33:31.680
of the feeds that make sense at least.

33:31.680 --> 33:34.840
Yeah, so this is what we're trying to get clarity on

33:34.840 --> 33:36.240
is which direction to go.

33:36.240 --> 33:38.300
Like what are the technology pieces

33:38.300 --> 33:40.560
that we could put together to build something

33:40.560 --> 33:42.880
that is essentially a static site

33:42.880 --> 33:46.580
that gets rebuilt on individual episode launches

33:46.580 --> 33:48.920
that is easy to maintain,

33:48.920 --> 33:52.760
that doesn't have a lot of backend complexity to it,

33:52.760 --> 33:55.160
that perhaps could be fully automated.

33:55.160 --> 33:57.140
Like what are all the right technologies to use here?

33:57.140 --> 33:59.060
And so we wanted to open this part up to the audience

33:59.060 --> 34:01.960
and ask you like, what are you using?

34:01.960 --> 34:03.920
Or what have you seen that works in this space?

34:03.920 --> 34:06.480
Because you know, we basically have until the end of summer

34:06.480 --> 34:07.480
to get this figured out,

34:07.480 --> 34:09.520
and so this is the very beginning of spring

34:09.520 --> 34:11.200
that we're starting to take this very seriously,

34:11.200 --> 34:13.120
and we wanted to open the dialogue up to you.

34:13.120 --> 34:14.820
So send us a boost and let us know

34:14.820 --> 34:17.320
what technology stacks you would recommend,

34:17.320 --> 34:19.980
or you can go to officehours.show slash hair.

34:19.980 --> 34:23.440
No, it's officehours.hair slash contact.

34:23.440 --> 34:24.760
The hair thing is complicated.

34:24.760 --> 34:25.700
It's new still.

34:26.880 --> 34:30.160
It wasn't my first choice, but it's what was available.

34:31.160 --> 34:32.960
See, this is why we're trying to clean things up

34:32.960 --> 34:33.800
around here.

34:33.800 --> 34:35.000
Yeah.

34:35.000 --> 34:36.720
Can't even remember all of our domain names.

34:36.720 --> 34:37.560
It's too much.

34:37.560 --> 34:38.800
Let alone the top level ones.

34:38.800 --> 34:40.820
It's time to clean house.

34:40.820 --> 34:41.660
Yeah.

34:41.660 --> 34:42.500
Yeah.

34:49.220 --> 34:53.380
All right, so we have just laid out a lot there, I realize.

34:53.380 --> 34:55.820
Brent has a link for where the conversation

34:55.820 --> 34:57.120
should probably happen.

34:57.120 --> 34:58.580
I could also see us maybe setting up

34:58.580 --> 35:00.060
a matrix room for the website.

35:00.060 --> 35:01.260
That's probably a pretty good idea.

35:01.260 --> 35:03.080
So I'll set that up and we'll put a link

35:03.080 --> 35:05.400
in the show notes for that as well.

35:05.400 --> 35:07.300
But I saw a couple people in the mumble room

35:07.300 --> 35:09.460
had some input, so I wanted to start with you, Pycrash,

35:09.460 --> 35:13.060
because it sounds like you are a Hugo, a Hugo user, right?

35:13.060 --> 35:15.140
Yes, I use it for my blog.

35:15.140 --> 35:17.900
And the good thing about Hugo, for example,

35:17.900 --> 35:22.700
for the staff, for guests, or for example,

35:22.700 --> 35:25.840
for the sponsors, you can just use a template

35:25.840 --> 35:29.540
and update the template for each episode.

35:29.540 --> 35:34.540
When you generate a new episode, so Hugo new episode,

35:35.060 --> 35:38.140
it will just call the template for episodes

35:38.140 --> 35:41.460
and will just add your sponsor, for example.

35:41.460 --> 35:43.700
It will also be interesting,

35:43.700 --> 35:46.140
you cannot really update an RSS feed,

35:46.140 --> 35:49.860
but it will be interesting if the community

35:49.860 --> 35:54.380
could update your show notes with a pull request in GitHub.

35:54.380 --> 35:56.820
For example, if there's a correction or something like that

35:56.820 --> 35:59.020
or a link that was missing.

35:59.020 --> 36:00.420
That's an interesting idea.

36:00.420 --> 36:01.620
That's a great idea.

36:01.620 --> 36:03.900
Yeah, wouldn't that be something?

36:03.900 --> 36:07.980
Okay, definitely taking that input into consideration.

36:07.980 --> 36:10.660
I was looking for something similar like you,

36:10.660 --> 36:12.900
and I was doing that for a client,

36:12.900 --> 36:17.900
and I wanted to give him like a look and feel of a CMS

36:18.860 --> 36:22.340
so he can edit pages, but still I wanted it lightweight,

36:22.340 --> 36:25.420
and I wanted it to be not complicated to install

36:25.420 --> 36:26.860
on the server.

36:26.860 --> 36:29.260
And for that, there is graph.

36:29.260 --> 36:31.600
It's called getgraph.org.

36:31.600 --> 36:36.600
And it's something between of a web generator and a CMS,

36:36.600 --> 36:41.080
because it has modules and you can install,

36:41.080 --> 36:43.080
in fact, a admin module,

36:43.080 --> 36:45.880
which allows you to use it like a normal CMS,

36:45.880 --> 36:47.920
but you don't need to.

36:47.920 --> 36:49.320
So that's a really cool thing.

36:49.320 --> 36:51.680
And the best and the coolest thing is,

36:51.680 --> 36:54.780
you run that thing with PHP and nothing else.

36:55.800 --> 36:58.500
You only need PHP installed on that server.

36:58.500 --> 37:01.560
You don't need a database and it just runs.

37:01.560 --> 37:03.900
So it's pretty interesting stuff.

37:03.900 --> 37:07.520
May not be exactly what you want,

37:07.520 --> 37:09.840
but in case just look at it,

37:09.840 --> 37:11.640
it could be very interesting.

37:11.640 --> 37:15.240
So getgraph.org looks like it's the website.

37:15.240 --> 37:16.280
This is, oh, okay.

37:16.280 --> 37:19.600
And it gives you some of the niceties that honestly,

37:19.600 --> 37:21.680
it's kind of nice to have dashboards with stats

37:21.680 --> 37:22.520
and stuff like that.

37:22.520 --> 37:23.380
It gives you a UI.

37:23.380 --> 37:25.440
All right, this is also really good.

37:25.440 --> 37:28.560
And I'll put a link to this to graph in the show notes,

37:28.560 --> 37:29.640
because that looks like it might be something

37:29.640 --> 37:31.200
to consider as well.

37:31.200 --> 37:32.160
Love you guys, that's great.

37:32.160 --> 37:33.760
And this is an ongoing conversation.

37:33.760 --> 37:38.760
We, I feel like we probably by the end of May

37:39.280 --> 37:42.880
need to have our technology stack totally sorted out.

37:42.880 --> 37:43.920
Don't you think?

37:43.920 --> 37:44.760
I think that's reasonable.

37:44.760 --> 37:47.400
And we wanna also test it a little bit, right?

37:47.400 --> 37:50.420
Before moving and we don't wanna wait the last minute, so.

37:50.420 --> 37:53.820
I have wanted to redo the website forever.

37:53.820 --> 37:56.020
So I'm pretty excited about it actually.

37:56.020 --> 37:58.600
You're not just looking to move the current WordPress

37:58.600 --> 38:00.480
to a new WordPress host, are you?

38:00.480 --> 38:01.320
Crossed my mind.

38:01.320 --> 38:04.400
It did cross my mind to just set up a brand new

38:04.400 --> 38:05.840
spanking fast WordPress,

38:05.840 --> 38:09.160
because I've done a few test stacks on Linode

38:09.160 --> 38:11.880
and they have like, I think, I can't remember,

38:11.880 --> 38:14.360
I think it's called the Lightspeed HTTP server.

38:14.360 --> 38:16.820
They have this really nice optimized WordPress stack

38:16.820 --> 38:19.600
for the Lightspeed web server

38:19.600 --> 38:21.360
and the whole thing really rocks.

38:21.360 --> 38:23.360
And so it did cross my mind to go,

38:23.360 --> 38:26.800
well, I could just do a nice, clean, brand new,

38:26.800 --> 38:28.420
perfectly set up WordPress install

38:28.420 --> 38:31.220
and then migrate what we can over.

38:31.220 --> 38:33.400
But the truth of the matter is this,

38:33.400 --> 38:36.080
WordPress has always just been way too much.

38:36.080 --> 38:37.280
You know, I think that's one of the things

38:37.280 --> 38:40.440
that Fireside showed us is the websites can be a lot simpler,

38:40.440 --> 38:44.520
a lot cleaner, and just recognize the fact

38:44.520 --> 38:49.520
that 99, 98, 95, 95, probably,

38:50.280 --> 38:51.720
somewhere in the 95, 90 range.

38:51.720 --> 38:53.480
Okay, I'm walking it back a little bit, but.

38:53.480 --> 38:54.320
92?

38:54.320 --> 38:55.920
No, yeah, yeah, 93-ish.

38:55.920 --> 38:57.480
A huge percentage of the audience

38:57.480 --> 38:59.560
is interacting with the shows either live,

38:59.560 --> 39:01.800
no, through the podcast app, yes.

39:01.800 --> 39:02.880
That's where they're doing it.

39:02.880 --> 39:04.640
They're doing it through the podcast app.

39:04.640 --> 39:06.600
Or maybe they're listening on the website,

39:06.600 --> 39:08.240
but it's a pretty small percentage.

39:08.240 --> 39:10.160
And so the website needs to serve a good function

39:10.160 --> 39:12.160
for getting links and finding stuff

39:12.160 --> 39:14.000
and maybe discovering other shows,

39:14.000 --> 39:17.240
but we don't expect people to come experience the shows

39:17.240 --> 39:18.520
while watching them on our website

39:18.520 --> 39:22.440
like we did when we deployed WordPress 2,000 years ago.

39:22.440 --> 39:23.760
Because it was all video back then

39:23.760 --> 39:27.000
and we had this crazy idea that maybe we could drive people

39:27.000 --> 39:28.520
from YouTube to the JB website

39:28.520 --> 39:31.120
and they would watch all the content on the JB site.

39:31.120 --> 39:32.160
But it never really happened.

39:32.160 --> 39:33.680
YouTube just became a monster.

39:33.680 --> 39:35.800
It feels like one other thing to keep in mind

39:35.800 --> 39:38.720
is we do want to take a lot of the archive over.

39:38.720 --> 39:42.960
So video support is sort of kind of part of it too, right?

39:42.960 --> 39:44.580
Yeah, you'd want to be able to accommodate it.

39:44.580 --> 39:47.120
We may want to do video shows in the future again.

39:47.120 --> 39:49.680
I mean, we're testing video right now as we record this.

39:49.680 --> 39:51.640
So you want to be able to accommodate for it,

39:51.640 --> 39:54.300
but the whole website's designed around having a video.

39:54.300 --> 39:57.540
So we have a video embedded for every podcast episode.

39:57.540 --> 39:59.200
It just doesn't really make sense.

39:59.200 --> 40:01.320
There's just things that were old assumptions.

40:01.320 --> 40:02.480
It's time to update.

40:02.480 --> 40:05.000
But moving on, speaking of YouTube,

40:05.000 --> 40:07.320
I went ahead and got into it

40:07.320 --> 40:09.800
with the Linux Foundation this week.

40:09.800 --> 40:12.360
And I'll put a link to this in the show notes.

40:12.360 --> 40:14.160
I was extremely disappointed

40:14.160 --> 40:16.960
to see the Linux Foundation shill NFTs

40:16.960 --> 40:20.320
with their crappy centralized hyperledger blockchain

40:20.320 --> 40:24.000
while spreading FUD about free software and Bitcoin.

40:24.000 --> 40:27.280
Shameful, because they're essentially employing the tactics

40:27.280 --> 40:32.280
that Microsoft and SCO and others engaged in years ago

40:32.800 --> 40:34.960
to try to scuttle Linux.

40:34.960 --> 40:36.920
And so I released a video on YouTube,

40:36.920 --> 40:39.360
speaking of YouTube, that calls them out.

40:39.360 --> 40:41.600
And I do a play-by-play of their video,

40:41.600 --> 40:43.680
and then I read their report that they published,

40:43.680 --> 40:46.040
and I do some responses to their report.

40:46.040 --> 40:48.160
And I try to correct some of the FUD

40:48.160 --> 40:51.840
about misinformation around the Bitcoin mining,

40:51.840 --> 40:54.680
the Bitcoin mining misinformation around proof of work

40:54.680 --> 40:57.920
and NFTs, which really, in my opinion,

40:57.920 --> 41:00.240
the Linux Foundation should be staying the hell away from.

41:00.240 --> 41:03.080
They should not be shilling any of this stuff.

41:03.080 --> 41:04.360
They should have never really got involved

41:04.360 --> 41:07.400
with the hyperledger project, but that seems inevitable.

41:07.400 --> 41:12.400
But I also cover a article from 1999.

41:12.440 --> 41:14.120
In fact, I'd love to put a link to this in the show notes

41:14.120 --> 41:15.240
if I remember.

41:15.240 --> 41:17.280
It is such a stinker.

41:17.280 --> 41:20.200
It was a piece on Forbes in 1999

41:20.200 --> 41:23.040
about the power draw of the internet and the PC

41:23.040 --> 41:25.280
and how it would destroy the world.

41:25.280 --> 41:28.400
And that by the time a billion machines came online,

41:28.400 --> 41:30.320
all of the PCs in the world would consume

41:30.320 --> 41:33.880
the entire electrical capacity of the United States.

41:33.880 --> 41:38.040
And in this article, which I read through in this video,

41:38.040 --> 41:42.280
they try to put a price point on megabytes transferred.

41:42.280 --> 41:47.280
So they say that there is one pound of coal

41:47.280 --> 41:51.600
created and burned to move two megabytes of data

41:51.600 --> 41:52.720
on the internet.

41:52.720 --> 41:56.120
And this is a classic FUD attack.

41:56.120 --> 41:59.440
And it all maps back to FUD we're hearing today.

41:59.440 --> 42:01.920
And this is from 1999.

42:01.920 --> 42:03.120
So that's in there.

42:03.120 --> 42:05.360
My issues with the Linux Foundation are in there.

42:05.360 --> 42:06.520
And I'm just putting the word out there

42:06.520 --> 42:08.120
for those of you who care about this stuff.

42:08.120 --> 42:11.080
I'm not releasing this anywhere but on the YouTube channel

42:11.080 --> 42:12.360
because I acknowledge not everybody cares

42:12.360 --> 42:13.600
about this kind of stuff.

42:13.600 --> 42:14.920
But if you want to think where I think

42:14.920 --> 42:17.640
the Linux Foundation is going wrong

42:17.640 --> 42:18.760
and the FUD that they're spreading,

42:18.760 --> 42:20.020
I'll put a link to that in the show notes.

42:20.020 --> 42:21.640
Just super disappointed.

42:21.640 --> 42:23.560
It's like, just stay out of this, you know?

42:23.560 --> 42:24.760
Stay out of this.

42:24.760 --> 42:26.160
Yeah, it feels like maybe they don't need

42:26.160 --> 42:27.960
to have an opinion on that.

42:27.960 --> 42:29.840
Is that their mission?

42:29.840 --> 42:32.240
Maybe they want to sell Linux source code polls

42:32.240 --> 42:33.200
as NFTs one day.

42:33.200 --> 42:36.000
Maybe it's a master plan.

42:36.000 --> 42:37.720
You know, gotta get that Hyperledger hype.

42:37.720 --> 42:39.360
Woo woo, woo woo.

42:39.360 --> 42:41.360
Gotta get that Hyperledger hype.

42:41.360 --> 42:45.400
Ask not what your podcast can boost for you,

42:45.400 --> 42:48.880
but what you can boost for your podcast.

42:48.880 --> 42:51.240
West Coast Hamburger sent us a boost two days ago

42:51.240 --> 42:52.140
for 3,000 sats.

42:52.140 --> 42:53.520
I just wanted to say I'm looking forward

42:53.520 --> 42:55.280
to where this new show goes.

42:55.280 --> 42:56.940
Thank you, office hours.

42:56.940 --> 42:58.960
I heard rumors of another road trip.

42:58.960 --> 43:02.120
Any love for us fellow West coasters?

43:02.120 --> 43:04.240
Hmm, yeah, I think that's our next plan.

43:04.240 --> 43:06.640
I think we were thinking about it as a team.

43:06.640 --> 43:08.720
Or at least I was waxing on about it to everybody.

43:08.720 --> 43:11.640
We just did the East Coast meetup, in the summer

43:11.640 --> 43:13.400
we did the Denver meetup, and so it

43:13.400 --> 43:16.400
does seem like it's time to do something on the West Coast.

43:16.400 --> 43:18.160
So we are reaching out to friends,

43:18.160 --> 43:21.140
and we're trying to cook up maybe multiple meetups

43:21.140 --> 43:23.700
along the I-5 corridor along the West Coast.

43:23.700 --> 43:25.380
So we're not sure yet, and I'm still

43:25.380 --> 43:27.800
trying to get Lady Joops in to get fixed up for all of this

43:27.800 --> 43:30.240
to actually make a road ready.

43:30.240 --> 43:33.480
She's still hurting from Denver, but assuming

43:33.480 --> 43:35.960
we get all that figured out, I'm going to put that in there.

43:35.960 --> 43:37.720
Also, I want to mention you can now open a channel

43:37.720 --> 43:38.400
to our lightning node.

43:38.400 --> 43:40.440
We're going to be adding that to the show notes.

43:40.440 --> 43:43.000
So if you want to get in on that fun, you can.

43:43.000 --> 43:47.160
Music Fish wrote in with 777sats three days ago.

43:47.160 --> 43:47.960
Oh, that's fun.

43:47.960 --> 43:49.880
Is that supposed to mean something, you think?

43:49.880 --> 43:50.760
Is that like a?

43:50.760 --> 43:52.440
It's hard to know.

43:52.440 --> 43:56.000
Maybe they include something in the text here.

43:56.000 --> 43:56.720
They're right.

43:56.720 --> 43:58.980
I've seen some pushback about boosts and value

43:58.980 --> 44:01.060
for value online.

44:01.060 --> 44:03.000
I just don't think people get it yet.

44:03.000 --> 44:06.840
Maybe they have never lost one of their favorite shows.

44:06.840 --> 44:08.880
I know you guys work hard, so I'll be boosting

44:08.880 --> 44:10.080
to say thank you.

44:10.080 --> 44:10.920
Well, thank you.

44:10.920 --> 44:11.640
That is very kind.

44:11.640 --> 44:13.720
Yeah, I was thinking about that, too.

44:13.720 --> 44:16.880
I have seen some pushback as well, and I totally get it.

44:16.880 --> 44:19.120
A lot of us don't have very much to give,

44:19.120 --> 44:21.080
and so when you're asked, it's kind of annoying.

44:21.080 --> 44:21.640
There's that.

44:21.640 --> 44:24.640
And I totally, totally understand that perspective.

44:24.640 --> 44:29.560
And then there is a contingent of folks in the Linux community

44:29.560 --> 44:31.640
who just don't really like paying for stuff.

44:31.640 --> 44:33.440
And I don't think that's a very big majority,

44:33.440 --> 44:35.440
and I don't really get too concerned about it.

44:35.440 --> 44:37.200
But I do acknowledge it is there.

44:37.200 --> 44:38.760
I have become just slightly more vocal,

44:38.760 --> 44:41.640
and I'm going to try to focus on the positives because I

44:41.640 --> 44:43.360
think all of the concepts I'm laying down

44:43.360 --> 44:45.760
to support independent content production,

44:45.760 --> 44:47.920
I think they all map to free software.

44:47.920 --> 44:50.800
And so I think this is a way free software

44:50.800 --> 44:54.100
projects could start talking about value

44:54.100 --> 44:57.240
and maybe coming up with ways to sustain them.

44:57.240 --> 45:00.240
And maybe we're not going to make people full-time

45:00.240 --> 45:02.360
developers, but maybe some.

45:02.360 --> 45:04.160
But it starts with a common language.

45:04.160 --> 45:06.760
And one of the things that has been coming through a lot

45:06.760 --> 45:09.960
is some people really do seem to get it, put some people off.

45:09.960 --> 45:12.080
So we're going to try to find the right middle ground,

45:12.080 --> 45:13.180
figure out how to integrate it all,

45:13.180 --> 45:14.760
and we're still figuring that out.

45:14.760 --> 45:17.120
But some people really seem to click with it.

45:17.120 --> 45:21.240
And you saw Listener Cole come up and help us with Lady

45:21.240 --> 45:22.680
Joups on the wiring.

45:22.680 --> 45:24.520
New West came up and helped us out for a day

45:24.520 --> 45:25.480
here at the studio.

45:25.480 --> 45:28.040
And he continues to be a great participant in our community.

45:28.040 --> 45:31.200
And Lucas gave us a ride in his Tesla this week.

45:31.200 --> 45:33.240
And I always like to mention Minimac.

45:33.240 --> 45:35.240
He's always in here in the Mumble Room.

45:35.240 --> 45:36.840
Dan Johnson, hardly a live stream

45:36.840 --> 45:39.800
goes by that Dan Johnson doesn't make it to.

45:39.800 --> 45:40.920
That stuff matters.

45:40.920 --> 45:43.360
And we notice it, and it's value.

45:43.360 --> 45:44.760
And there's a lot of ways.

45:44.760 --> 45:46.200
And I think once people start wrapping their head around,

45:46.200 --> 45:49.040
like documentation could be a way to contribute value back,

45:49.040 --> 45:50.760
or translations, or bug reports.

45:50.760 --> 45:54.200
Really good bug reports that are actionable are valuable,

45:54.200 --> 45:55.960
not just something that's a task,

45:55.960 --> 45:58.240
but something that's actionable and solves a problem.

45:58.240 --> 45:58.720
That's value.

45:58.720 --> 45:59.780
We could start thinking about things

45:59.780 --> 46:01.460
like that for free software.

46:01.460 --> 46:03.800
And we're kind of just laying that groundwork now.

46:03.800 --> 46:05.400
And it is turning some people off.

46:05.400 --> 46:06.680
And I am trying to figure out how to message it

46:06.680 --> 46:08.280
in a way that doesn't.

46:08.280 --> 46:09.200
But I'm still learning, because I'm

46:09.200 --> 46:10.280
very passionate about it right now.

46:10.280 --> 46:11.920
So I just kind of jumped all in.

46:11.920 --> 46:13.400
I didn't grab the deets for this one.

46:13.400 --> 46:14.920
But we got a boost from that.

46:14.920 --> 46:16.680
As you can tell, I've been thinking about this

46:16.680 --> 46:17.520
for the whole episode.

46:17.520 --> 46:22.840
But user 964 said, I love the idea of value for value.

46:22.840 --> 46:25.160
And I'm also concerned about Spotify there.

46:25.160 --> 46:26.920
I got the Fountain app, and I bought some Bitcoin

46:26.920 --> 46:28.240
so I could participate.

46:28.240 --> 46:30.840
But I think you'll find the audience is much more receptive

46:30.840 --> 46:33.120
if you focus on the benefits of this new model.

46:33.120 --> 46:35.440
Instead of the end of podcasting,

46:35.440 --> 46:38.120
the government is out to get us doomsday stuff.

46:38.120 --> 46:39.600
And I think that's it, right?

46:39.600 --> 46:42.120
It's both a solution to what could

46:42.120 --> 46:44.480
be the centralization of podcasting, as I would put it.

46:44.480 --> 46:45.840
I don't know if it's the end of podcasting,

46:45.840 --> 46:48.400
but I'd say it's the centralization of podcasting

46:48.400 --> 46:50.160
and the fading of independent podcasting

46:50.160 --> 46:52.740
as a result of changes in the ad market.

46:52.740 --> 46:54.200
But we don't have to focus on that.

46:54.200 --> 46:56.400
We can instead focus on the positive aspects of it.

46:56.400 --> 46:57.940
And I think they absolutely nail it.

46:57.940 --> 46:58.800
So that was a great boost.

46:58.800 --> 47:00.080
Like I said last week, if you want

47:00.080 --> 47:01.840
to send in some critical thoughts too,

47:01.840 --> 47:04.480
a boost is a great way to do that because a little bit

47:04.480 --> 47:08.000
of sugar with that medicine, it makes a difference

47:08.000 --> 47:09.280
psychologically.

47:09.280 --> 47:10.480
So there you go.

47:10.480 --> 47:11.920
Chris, you find when you get the boosts in,

47:11.920 --> 47:14.000
all of a sudden it changes your ideas a little bit

47:14.000 --> 47:16.000
and you think about that for the next maybe 10 minutes,

47:16.000 --> 47:17.040
an hour, day?

47:17.040 --> 47:17.720
Or days.

47:17.720 --> 47:20.680
Yeah, because they sent that in days ago.

47:20.680 --> 47:23.180
Days ago, and I've been thinking about that and chewing it over

47:23.180 --> 47:24.340
in my head.

47:24.340 --> 47:26.280
And the tooling of all of it makes it such

47:26.280 --> 47:28.180
that it's sort of there in front and center,

47:28.180 --> 47:30.000
and we get notifications about it.

47:30.000 --> 47:32.360
So before we wrap up today, I wanted to do something

47:32.360 --> 47:33.440
kind of fun, Brantley.

47:33.440 --> 47:35.720
I think I know what would be coming.

47:35.720 --> 47:38.640
We wanted to give away a few Satoshis, a few SATs,

47:38.640 --> 47:41.680
so people can participate in the value for value model

47:41.680 --> 47:43.120
and try it out.

47:43.120 --> 47:45.400
So I have a recommendation out there, everybody.

47:45.400 --> 47:49.960
Go grab the Breeze wallet or go to newpodcastapps.com

47:49.960 --> 47:51.800
and get yourself a new podcast app.

47:51.800 --> 47:56.200
And if you're listening live, when we wrap up the show here,

47:56.200 --> 47:59.440
we're going to give away 2,000 SATs to three lucky winners.

47:59.440 --> 48:01.480
So you got a few minutes to go get a new podcast app

48:01.480 --> 48:03.200
at newpodcastapps.com.

48:03.200 --> 48:05.160
You need to get into your wallet and generate

48:05.160 --> 48:07.080
an invoice for 2,000 SATs.

48:07.080 --> 48:10.120
Or if you don't want to switch podcast apps,

48:10.120 --> 48:12.580
you could use Breeze, which they're

48:12.580 --> 48:16.000
kind of selling themselves as sort of the shopping mall

48:16.000 --> 48:17.160
to the Lightning Network.

48:17.160 --> 48:19.240
So there's all kinds of stuff on the Lightning Network,

48:19.240 --> 48:20.440
and podcasts are one of them.

48:20.440 --> 48:23.020
You can add one podcast, you can add office hours,

48:23.020 --> 48:25.820
and you could send messages in, send us your thoughts.

48:25.820 --> 48:27.020
So would you do that?

48:27.020 --> 48:28.600
And then join us live one Tuesday.

48:28.600 --> 48:32.200
We'll do another giveaway on our next episode.

48:32.200 --> 48:34.080
All right, Brent Lee, thanks for joining us.

48:34.080 --> 48:34.960
Always a pleasure.

48:34.960 --> 48:36.480
See you next time.

48:36.480 --> 48:37.760
Goodbye, everybody.

48:37.760 --> 48:39.640
Show's over.

48:39.640 --> 48:41.600
You can go now.

48:41.600 --> 48:58.920
Get out of here.
