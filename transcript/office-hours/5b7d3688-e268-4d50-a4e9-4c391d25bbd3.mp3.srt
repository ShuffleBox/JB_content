1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,700
Well, so far, we're streaming, we're recording, the mixer seems to be working.

2
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:07,740
It's like we didn't have a massive power outage last night.

3
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:08,740
Except that you did.

4
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:09,740
Yeah.

5
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:10,740
Oh, I hate it.

6
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:15,460
So I get home last night and I get a message on my phone like such and such system is unreachable,

7
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:17,700
which is how I know something's gone wrong.

8
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:22,380
Either the internet is out or the studio doesn't have power.

9
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:26,300
And do you know what my first thought was when I realized the studio doesn't have power?

10
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:27,780
No, please tell me.

11
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:28,780
You're not going to be surprised.

12
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:30,100
Oh, the node.

13
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:31,100
The node.

14
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:32,100
Yeah.

15
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:33,100
Yeah, the node.

16
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:34,100
I was like, no.

17
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:40,260
I think it was in January we were talking about a battery backup for that thing.

18
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:42,820
I guess you never got that out of your Amazon cart.

19
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:43,820
Yeah.

20
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:44,820
I just didn't want to turn it off.

21
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:46,980
You know, that's the thing at the uptime.

22
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:51,340
And then of course, when I have forced uptime, all I want to do is get it back online as

23
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:53,500
fast as freaking possible.

24
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:56,700
So then it's like, that's not the time, you know, so I got to get it back up because it

25
00:00:56,700 --> 00:01:01,420
went down like at 6 p.m. and I didn't make it to the studio until 7 a.m.

26
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:05,100
I think power probably came back somewhere around 4 a.m.

27
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:06,100
That's a lot of downtime.

28
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:07,100
Yeah.

29
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:11,900
So I make a beeline to the node worried that maybe some of my channels have been forcibly

30
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:15,220
closed because if you're offline for too long, it can happen.

31
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:18,460
Somebody can close their channel to you and then you don't have the inbound liquidity

32
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:19,460
you need and all that kind of thing.

33
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:21,060
It's a bad it's a bad deal.

34
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:27,060
Because as a node, your reputation is in part based on your availability and all of that.

35
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:29,160
It's you know, the network tracks that kind of stuff.

36
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:31,420
And so I got that sucker back online.

37
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:35,820
But because it's an older machine, it took about 20 minutes before everything fully came

38
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:36,820
back.

39
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:39,740
It was a nail biting 20 minutes.

40
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:40,740
And it's like, what do I do?

41
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:42,620
And I'm running through the scenarios.

42
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:43,620
What do I do?

43
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:44,620
What do I do?

44
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:45,940
So tell me about your backups.

45
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:47,580
Yeah, I know exactly.

46
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:48,580
Like check the backups.

47
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:52,980
You know, grit.

48
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:55,300
And then then I got the studio working after I got that.

49
00:01:55,300 --> 00:02:01,180
So I see the order of priorities here.

50
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:05,060
It's office hours with me, Chris.

51
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:08,500
Hello, everyone.

52
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:09,900
Welcome back into the office.

53
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:11,220
Oh, it's nice.

54
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:13,340
I've been back for a little bit now.

55
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:15,380
So everything's just the way I like it.

56
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:17,420
We've made a little bit of a mess over in the corner.

57
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:18,940
Well, it's not weird.

58
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:22,540
And I appreciate everybody for making it in and it's going to be a special show today.

59
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:23,540
Hey, Brantley.

60
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:24,540
Hello.

61
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:25,540
Tell me why it's special today.

62
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:29,060
Well, you got all these penguins in here, which I thought was kind of interesting.

63
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:30,780
Yeah, they're just they're AI generated.

64
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:32,980
I have to wear a suit as well.

65
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:33,980
You were supposed to.

66
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:35,220
I sent you a memo.

67
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:37,020
The problem is, is that you're traveling.

68
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:40,660
So I think it's back at your other office on the other side of Canada.

69
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:41,660
Right.

70
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:43,020
We got to get a better system for that.

71
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:47,980
No, we have a special show today because really, one of the MVPs of the Jupiter Broadcasting

72
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:49,580
community is joining us today.

73
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:53,900
You've heard us talk about Elray on the air in context of working on our website.

74
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:55,860
But Elray joins us today, a.k.a.

75
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:56,860
Alex.

76
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:57,860
Hello, Alex.

77
00:02:57,860 --> 00:02:58,860
Welcome in to the office.

78
00:02:58,860 --> 00:02:59,860
It's great to have you here.

79
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:00,860
Hi.

80
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:01,860
Thank you.

81
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:02,860
It's very cozy with all these dogs around.

82
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:03,860
Yeah.

83
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:04,860
OK.

84
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:08,220
There are a few dogs and penguins, I admit.

85
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:09,500
I like I like it.

86
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:11,140
I like it to have animals.

87
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:12,980
It's totally it's snuggly.

88
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:15,980
It's makes the kids happy, very nice and cozy.

89
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:20,420
And they've all been trained to be quiet, you know, so there's there's really no downside

90
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:21,420
to it.

91
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:22,820
Pretty impressive.

92
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:24,540
So thank you for joining us, Elray.

93
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:27,140
I'm looking forward to chatting about the website.

94
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:31,500
We're going to do a little push to production while we're live today on the show.

95
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:34,300
We'll tell everybody about that in a little bit.

96
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:38,980
The early signals are coming in for the big media companies that it's going to be a brutal

97
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:43,100
winter for media profits, especially in the United States.

98
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:47,500
So far, nearly three thousand media jobs have been cut this year, with more than one third

99
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:51,480
coming from the news media industry in particular.

100
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:58,220
It looks like ad sales for the large media companies are way down viewership as well.

101
00:03:58,220 --> 00:03:59,380
Ad sales down.

102
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:02,980
I don't know if it's an indication of where the rest of the media market goes, if where

103
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:06,820
the dinosaurs lead the rest go, or if it's just going to affect the most expensive legacy

104
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:10,020
media first, that's a bit of a wait and see.

105
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:15,220
The word that people are using is a chilling in the ad market, which is like a way to say

106
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:20,320
like demand is like slowing down for ads, which inevitably will will begin to impact

107
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,320
content creators.

108
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,320
OK.

109
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:26,160
And do you have theories like is it obviously because the economy is down a little bit and

110
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:29,580
therefore Big Corp doesn't have money to sink into this?

111
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:31,740
It's everybody's a little feeling a little tight on money, right?

112
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:34,300
I think everybody has a little less money to spend.

113
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:39,120
And so probably advertisers aren't getting the results that they want to see consistently

114
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,420
from some of these outlets.

115
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:45,100
And some of these outlets are very expensive, so they are big cost centers.

116
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:50,700
And advertising is one of those things that you can kind of quickly cut back on and see

117
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:51,700
the return.

118
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:55,020
You know, and without really having to do anything else, you can cut advertising and

119
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:56,020
save money.

120
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:57,020
I don't know.

121
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:58,860
It'll be interesting to see what happens.

122
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:03,740
I think Adam Curry, the pod father, believes that this is going to develop into probably

123
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:08,340
a harder and harder time for podcasting and YouTube advertising.

124
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:10,100
I'm not totally sure of that.

125
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:11,100
It's definitely possible.

126
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:16,460
I feel like we're at a fork in the road in in the 2008 financial crisis.

127
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:20,640
In the last big downturn that I saw, it initially affected podcast advertising.

128
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:27,660
But the route that advertisers chose was to focus more on independent media and and social

129
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:31,460
media because it was such a smaller cost.

130
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:36,820
And so they cut back their advertising on the radio and on television and they began

131
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:42,580
advertising more on YouTube, podcasts, blogs, and that grew over the years because they

132
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:46,600
were getting pretty good return for the spend.

133
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,940
They went for the value advertising.

134
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:52,500
I don't know if that's going to be the case this time around, because now the rates to

135
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:58,340
advertise on a YouTube channel are outlandish and the lot of podcasts charge outlandish

136
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:02,700
prices, too, for for their for their sponsorship rates, so I don't know if the and I also don't

137
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:04,420
know if the situation is the same.

138
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:09,820
It's a global downturn this time, so that could affect things as well.

139
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:10,820
I don't know.

140
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:13,820
I guess this is something I think we should maybe just keep our eye on.

141
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:14,820
I wouldn't panic.

142
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:19,440
But I think it's something to keep our eye on because it could affect our friends and

143
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:23,100
maybe eventually could it could eventually blow back on to JB.

144
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:26,880
We're pretty far down that stack when you're looking at like CNN and BBC.

145
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:29,300
We're pretty far down that stack.

146
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:32,780
I mean, but it is also just a prediction at this point, right?

147
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:36,620
So as we've seen in the last few years, anything can happen.

148
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:38,260
Yeah, anything could happen.

149
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:43,900
And it could also end up being a good thing for value for value podcasts and encouraging

150
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:48,860
those concepts and pushing people from that were kind of on the fence of, well, I don't

151
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:52,820
know about that, to kind of maybe switching over to supporting the shows and content they

152
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:55,500
like and going value for value.

153
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:59,900
That's actually exactly one of the things that I was going to talk about if I was asked

154
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:06,340
about it was, for me, giving financially has been difficult, specifically in my what I've

155
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:11,980
been able to do for my job, but this is the best way that I think I can give back is by

156
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:16,980
actually doing the technical, helping out with the website, trying to automate scripts

157
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:23,020
and code and other things, because that's where my acumen is at.

158
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:27,260
So it's just the easiest way for me to give back.

159
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:28,780
And it's super valuable.

160
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:32,260
And now we talk about you all the time on our shows, so look at that.

161
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:35,220
But it's been great for for JB.

162
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:39,540
It's been a and probably has been more impactful than a monetary donation would be, unless

163
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:43,020
it was a significant one that we go hire somebody for a while.

164
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:44,780
Here's what I think happens.

165
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:48,260
I think when when these kinds of things happen, you know, however you want to say it, times

166
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:55,460
get tougher, things change, I think communities that support each other, people turn to that

167
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:56,460
kind of stuff.

168
00:07:56,460 --> 00:08:00,140
You know, like example is I've noticed my little neighborhood where we usually park

169
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:04,900
jupes has become a little tighter, you know, we're sharing garden tips and space for some

170
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:09,620
people and we're keeping an eye on each other's yards and there's a little bit more sharing

171
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:13,620
than there was a few years ago, pre pandemic and stuff like that.

172
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:15,340
And that community has become a little bit stronger.

173
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:21,480
And I feel like value for value is a framework for a bunch of people on the Internet to wrap

174
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:27,220
their heads around something we can all agree on a common set of ideas to participate.

175
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:28,280
It's a common language.

176
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:29,280
It's a common mindset.

177
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:33,700
So, you know, when I say value for value already interprets that as well, I can't necessarily

178
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:37,060
contribute financially right now, but I can contribute technical skills.

179
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:41,020
Somebody else might interpret that as well, I could contribute financially right now because

180
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:44,900
I don't have the time and somebody else might interpret that as well, I can make a few clips

181
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:48,440
for the guys to give the boost segments, even more sounds to make it even more dynamic and

182
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,440
keep that flowing.

183
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,440
Right.

184
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:54,560
And there's just it's a community coming together around something.

185
00:08:54,560 --> 00:09:00,600
The most important aspect of all of it is it keeps the creators.

186
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,300
It keeps them focused on their community.

187
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:04,580
It keeps them genuine to their community.

188
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:06,100
It keeps them in touch with their community.

189
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:08,360
It keeps them grounded, right?

190
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:14,680
It keeps us talking to real people at working on stuff instead of instead of getting lost

191
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:18,460
in the echo chamber of social media and Twitter and the and the arguments and the fights and

192
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:22,620
all of the super polarized things over there or instead of, you know, letting it get to

193
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:26,380
your head that a million people, four million people, five million people are downloading

194
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:28,960
your stuff instead of like getting carried away with that stuff.

195
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:29,960
It keeps you grounded.

196
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:33,160
It's like more like working, working with the land than it is, you know, working up

197
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:34,160
in the concept level.

198
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:39,060
And I think as a content creator, it's really important that you stay grounded, you stay

199
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:42,760
connected to real people, you stay working in the community.

200
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:46,740
And value for value is a framework that keeps the creator in that headspace.

201
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:49,860
It lets people participate in a way they would otherwise not.

202
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:55,780
And so if there is an economic downturn, I feel like JB is probably well positioned because

203
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:57,880
we've been talking about these ideas for a while.

204
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:01,300
We would have to see it increase from where we're at right now in support.

205
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:04,220
But I actually have a pretty strong sense that our community would step up, those who

206
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:07,900
could, and they would step up in each way that they are capable of.

207
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:13,580
So when I see this news about the legacy media struggling, I think that sucks.

208
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:15,460
I hope it doesn't hurt JB.

209
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:20,220
I hope it doesn't hurt our friends in this space who rely solely on advertising.

210
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:22,820
But I think we're going to weather it.

211
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:25,640
Even if we had to slim down a little bit, depending on how bad it got, like we would

212
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:29,020
still weather, we would still have that core community support.

213
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:32,060
So it's also an insurance policy, you know, in a way.

214
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:37,600
The more we integrate value for value, it's an insurance policy that an economic downturn

215
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:41,600
can't come in and blow us away and take out what we've built.

216
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,340
It's a stronger foundation.

217
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:48,940
Yeah, I guess I feel a lot better about it now that I think about it.

218
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:49,940
So maybe it's good news.

219
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:50,940
I don't know.

220
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:54,300
And on that same, on that, did you have anything you wanted to add, Alex?

221
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:59,260
I was just going to say, you just sometimes have to make sure you set ground rules about

222
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:03,820
not allowing your neighbor to push away a food order you ordered ahead of time.

223
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:06,680
Yes, that is true.

224
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:11,220
To be to be fair to the neighbors, the neighbor's friend, which made it even more obnoxious.

225
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:12,220
Like, what do you know?

226
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:13,220
You're just visiting.

227
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:14,220
What do you know?

228
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:17,720
That's a big Instacart order, too.

229
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:20,020
But there is more good news out there.

230
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:24,160
Recently since we got together on October 19th, Pocket Cast announced that the mobile

231
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:28,220
apps are going open source.

232
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:31,940
Pocket Cast is one of the beloved podcast apps out there, so it's really fantastic to

233
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:33,700
see this.

234
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:36,700
They launched back in 2010.

235
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:41,340
And I think there is definitely not a huge portion of our audience, but a significant

236
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:43,260
portion of our audience who loves Pocket Cast.

237
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:49,340
So to see Automatic, the folks that also own WordPress, make this announcement, a lot

238
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:51,660
of people in our audience took note.

239
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:57,980
Now, I feel like we still have a second shoe to drop here with Pocket Cast.

240
00:11:57,980 --> 00:12:03,320
I think what really makes Pocket Cast tick is its back end infrastructure.

241
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:06,300
And that's not open source still.

242
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:10,180
It's also not clear what Pocket Cast intends to do with their index.

243
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:15,840
If they plan to continue to develop that index, if they want to make it more widely available,

244
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:21,220
or if they plan to integrate maybe the podcast index and stop maintaining yet another podcast

245
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:22,220
index.

246
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:28,980
Obviously, my preference would be they use the podcast index and not their own independent

247
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:29,980
database.

248
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:36,020
Also, it's, I think, remains yet to be seen how much they're going to support podcasting

249
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:37,020
2.0.

250
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:42,740
Yeah, I definitely think that if they're trying to be more open source oriented, definitely

251
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:48,140
going with what you're saying would be what they're trying to actually shoot for.

252
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:53,060
What do you think their incentive was to open source the apps themselves and not really

253
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:55,900
mention anywhere about the back end?

254
00:12:55,900 --> 00:13:03,060
I wonder, is this part of a long term plan or is this, I'm curious, what do you think

255
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:04,060
the incentive is here?

256
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:08,660
Well, you know, the automatic folks generally do publish a lot of their stuff as open source

257
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:10,140
like WordPress and whatnot.

258
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:14,940
So there's maybe, you know, maybe this is just the company's culture to a degree.

259
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:19,460
I think there's also the advantages, as we've seen, if you open up an app to the community

260
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:22,460
of contributors, they're going to start being able to work on stuff that you just didn't

261
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:24,260
have the bandwidth for.

262
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:26,660
And then I think there's also the competitive aspect.

263
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:29,500
On iOS, Apple Podcast is king.

264
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:34,360
And then there's a lot of really great alternative podcast apps.

265
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:39,460
And with the new podcast apps that have come up, there's even more options now.

266
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:43,020
And something like Podverse, for example, that's GPL.

267
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:46,020
Something like AntennaPod, also open source.

268
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:49,460
So you have to figure there was a bit of a competitive analysis they must have done too

269
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:53,940
as well and thought, well, in order for us to stay relevant, this is the direction we

270
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:54,940
have to go.

271
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:57,620
We need these new features added pretty quick.

272
00:13:57,620 --> 00:14:00,700
I do believe they've been chatting with Dave and Adam a bit.

273
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:05,420
So hopefully that means they're open to the idea of the Podcasting 2.0 stuff.

274
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:06,420
That would be nice.

275
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:11,100
I don't know if I've said this publicly, but I've said it privately.

276
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:16,740
For me, the Podcasting 2.0 features are a matter of competitiveness in a way, right?

277
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:21,620
Like it's a way you could look at it is a podcast is a product and that product needs

278
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:24,940
to be as good as possible.

279
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:31,020
And I've always prided on JB featuring the cutting edge stuff that podcasting has available

280
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:33,040
whenever whenever there is something.

281
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:37,700
Maybe it's I mean, for a long time, we just pushed having video versions available that

282
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:38,700
most people weren't doing.

283
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:42,640
And then after that, it's silly things like pushing the edge of what you can do with an

284
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:44,460
encoded file and embedding chapters.

285
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:49,300
And then we would take things further and further just because we have an audience that

286
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:50,300
frankly likes that stuff.

287
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:51,620
You know, they know how to use that stuff.

288
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:52,840
They have tooling for that stuff.

289
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:53,840
They want it.

290
00:14:53,840 --> 00:15:01,300
So let's go and podcasting 2.0 and all of the options in there, like alternative enclosures,

291
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:09,500
host information, transcripts, cloud chapters, live tag, value for value, so on and so forth

292
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:15,280
are, in my opinion, features I want our shows to have and they make our shows more competitive.

293
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:17,340
They make them more feature complete.

294
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:23,780
And so as a podcaster, I'm going to be talking about the apps that make my shows shine and

295
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:28,700
I'm not going to be talking about the apps as much that don't because I don't think there's

296
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:30,880
as good of an experience over there.

297
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:35,640
And so when you think about the fact that apps that have podcasting 2.0 features are

298
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:40,940
basically getting free advertising on every podcast that's implementing podcasting 2.0

299
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:45,340
features, it'd be a pretty good idea for Pocket Cast to include those features because then

300
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:49,660
you're just going to get mentioned across a whole array of podcasts and a lot of them

301
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:54,340
are like the cutting edge podcasts that follow the latest trends that are doing the new stuff.

302
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:58,380
Not that we're like some hipster podcast company thing, but I want to have that stuff.

303
00:15:58,380 --> 00:15:59,420
I want to have transcripts.

304
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:01,060
I want to have cloud chapters.

305
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:02,820
I want to have an alternative enclosure.

306
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:05,200
I mean, we have MP4 versions.

307
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,500
We can make Opus versions.

308
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,180
There's a lot we could do with that.

309
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:13,380
And then at the same time, it's always better for the user or client experience whenever

310
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:16,700
it's all integrated into the actual app.

311
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:18,100
It's always more enjoyable.

312
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:22,100
Like you said, you've been giving them free advertising, but it also makes people want

313
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:24,580
to listen to your podcast more too.

314
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:25,580
I hope so.

315
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:28,900
I think it's silly that we've been sending people outside the podcast app for so many

316
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:29,900
years.

317
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:32,780
You just haven't had the option of having that stuff in there.

318
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:35,580
You want to listen live, go to somewhere else outside your podcast app.

319
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:38,220
You want to contribute, go somewhere else outside your podcast app.

320
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:40,340
It's so crazy when you think about it.

321
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:42,660
Nobody else would do that.

322
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:47,100
Ever since I had moved to Podverse, every time you guys had mentioned me on a show,

323
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:48,100
I always clip it.

324
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:54,140
And then I can send it to my dad or my wife or anyone, and they can see me getting referenced

325
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:55,140
on a podcast.

326
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:57,100
So it's been really awesome.

327
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:59,900
This is going to be a long clip then.

328
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:01,940
Yeah.

329
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:05,420
The beautiful thing about clips too, and that's a feature I should mention more often, is

330
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:06,420
it helps with discovery.

331
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:07,420
Right?

332
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:10,780
Like say that was a show on a topic that a family member was interested in.

333
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:11,780
You could send them a quick clip.

334
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:14,460
Look what these people are saying about this topic you're interested in, and then they

335
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:15,460
could become a listener.

336
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:19,300
I used to have a hack around that for the old Castbox app that I had.

337
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:25,540
I would, in the Castbox app, create a comment with a timestamp, and then I would send that

338
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:31,460
link to someone else, and they'd click the timestamp to jump to the specific spot that

339
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:34,380
I was trying to tell them about.

340
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:40,940
Yeah, I've certainly used firesides, like I guess on their web instance, they have a

341
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:42,620
means of doing timestamping as well.

342
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:45,100
It's a little clumsy, but it works.

343
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:52,140
Chris that gets me thinking about, I think you've been hoping for us to do some RSS feed

344
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:53,140
generation.

345
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:56,540
I don't want to jump to the website too soon, but I just want to ask you, do you have an

346
00:17:56,540 --> 00:17:59,460
idea of time frame that you'd love to have that feature?

347
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:00,460
Hmm.

348
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:05,180
Well, I mean, if I were going to like wave a magic wand, I'd like to have it ready for

349
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:07,020
office hours 16.

350
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:09,300
But I don't think we're there yet.

351
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:12,340
Because Wes and I, every time we talk about it, we discover a lot more we have to figure

352
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:13,340
out.

353
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:16,240
But I actually think we have it pretty well figured out at this point.

354
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:21,700
The issue is, once we start generating our own RSS feed, we're basically off fireside.

355
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:27,200
We're using them for the CDN, but we could point at another CDN, and we're basically

356
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,540
done with fireside.

357
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:33,540
And so then that brings up the issue of, well, crap, the whole website works by generating

358
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:35,460
off of what we post on fireside.

359
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:40,700
So we're trying to figure out a way to do it in a staged approach where, well, we'll

360
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:43,500
keep fireside in the loop for a while.

361
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:48,240
We'll take the feed that fireside generates as like the base feed, then we'll generate

362
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:53,020
on top of that the additional tags that we want, because we're going to probably also

363
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:59,300
add our own JB namespace tags so we can have information that the website might need that

364
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:01,140
maybe gets from fireside right now and other things.

365
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:05,820
So eventually, we could pull all that info that the website needs to generate from just

366
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:07,940
the RSS feed of the show.

367
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:14,100
But so initially, it'll be, we'll keep fireside, we'll take fireside's feed, we'll consume

368
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:18,260
that, generate our own feed with our own stuff, like the podcasting 2.0 namespace stuff in

369
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:21,420
there, and then put that up on a CDN.

370
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:24,820
Then when we're ready, when everything's ready to be flipped public in the publishing pipeline,

371
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:26,440
the feed will flip public.

372
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:27,440
Maybe we'll do a pod ping.

373
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:28,440
We'll have to look into that.

374
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:29,580
I don't know exactly how that works.

375
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:33,020
And then slowly but surely, we'll just fade out the fireside portion, and we'll just generate

376
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:36,160
the entire feed ourselves, but we can do it in a staged approach, because we also need

377
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,160
to solve a CDN.

378
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:41,540
We have to figure out what we want to do for a CDN, and we also have to make sure that

379
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:45,620
the website can be generated from the feed instead of fireside.

380
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:52,300
And you know, I hate to do it, because fireside's a pretty good product, and it's a good price,

381
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:58,020
except for LUP pays a sneaky private rate that they don't tell you about, unless you

382
00:19:58,020 --> 00:20:03,180
get bonkers downloads, and then they contact you, and you have to pay a bonkers price.

383
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:06,740
So LUP doesn't get a great price, but all the other shows pay a pretty good price for

384
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:12,020
the amount of downloads we get, and downloads are really fast, in my opinion.

385
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:16,580
I feel like the MP3s just slam onto my phone when I go to listen.

386
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:18,340
I love that.

387
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:23,300
And it's been pretty good, but it's been really unreliable recently.

388
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:29,180
Coderadio didn't publish on time this week, because fireside had a mistake.

389
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:33,620
We had an error, like three weeks in a row, Coderadio's been hit.

390
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:37,100
Linux Action News has been hit a few weeks in a row, too, where it just doesn't publish

391
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:40,460
on time, because it gets hung up on their system.

392
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:46,580
And then, I think the part that is the final, like, we've got to get rid of fireside, is

393
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:50,360
we put a request in about it for them to address it, and it sometimes takes them three to four

394
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:52,820
days before they get back to us.

395
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:57,240
Now imagine if we just waited three to four days for a show to publish.

396
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:59,860
Everybody would think the show's gone.

397
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:04,100
You know, they think something happened.

398
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:06,780
It would be ridiculous, not to mention, you know, it wouldn't perform properly for the

399
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:07,780
sponsors.

400
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:08,780
It's crazy.

401
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:09,780
It's suicide.

402
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:13,420
It'd be different if it was kind of like a side hobby thing, but you're a business.

403
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:16,580
That's not typically how businesses get treated.

404
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:21,020
And it's not what we'd expect when, you know, you're paying for a monthly service, and part

405
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:22,020
of that is support.

406
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:23,180
Especially at the bonkers price.

407
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:25,340
Although it doesn't seem to happen as much on Love.

408
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:30,500
Well now you know why.

409
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:31,500
Go figure, right?

410
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:32,500
I guess.

411
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:34,820
If only they had a network membership then.

412
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:35,820
Yeah.

413
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:36,820
Yeah.

414
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:39,540
That's the other thing, is there's features that have been promised literally before we

415
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:44,380
merged with Linux Academy in 2019 that we're still waiting on, or 2018, whenever that was.

416
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:45,480
I can't remember.

417
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:49,320
But basically, years now, we've been waiting on like a network page.

418
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:52,780
That's why we stalled the building of the new website for a while, is because we were

419
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:55,900
told that they would be generating a network page.

420
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:59,960
You could put all your shows into a network, and then it would create a homepage for all

421
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:00,960
your shows.

422
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,060
And we're like, well, okay, that'll be great.

423
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:04,700
That's exactly what we want.

424
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:05,700
And it never came.

425
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:07,020
And it never came.

426
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:08,280
And then we just finally gave up.

427
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:11,620
And then we got the word from Scale Engine, that hey, we're shutting down your WordPress.

428
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:14,180
We're like, well, this is quite the pickle.

429
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:18,020
So now we're kind of there with the hosting aspect.

430
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:22,100
I don't think we're going to jump immediately, but I think we're building towards that.

431
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:27,260
And it was just kind of working all of that out, and what it all affects, and what it

432
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:28,780
really means for us.

433
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:33,100
And the tooling we'll have to build on the back end, because Fireside has a UI we use,

434
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:34,100
and things like that.

435
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:35,820
But we'll get there.

436
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:37,420
We can do it in pieces.

437
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:41,860
It's interesting to hear you talk about the publishing side of things, because I didn't

438
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:47,020
know how do you author whenever a new podcast is going to come out?

439
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:48,300
Do you schedule it?

440
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:50,700
It sounds like you do, now that you've mentioned it.

441
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:56,780
And then how can we build the website around that flow to help enable you be able to still

442
00:22:56,780 --> 00:23:01,380
use the new website, but then also take advantage of all the different features that you're

443
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:02,380
wanting?

444
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:06,340
So I imagine, we'll see, is, well, this is still up in the air.

445
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:09,300
But one option we will have is sort of, we have show docs, right?

446
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:15,080
Like this episode that we're recording right now has a markdown document that we construct

447
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:20,080
in HedgeDoc that contains an outline of roughly what we want to talk about today and a few

448
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:23,820
other extra information, like your Twitter profile link and your GitHub profiling, things

449
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:26,060
that are just metadata for the show.

450
00:23:26,060 --> 00:23:28,920
And so we kind of have everything we need for the show post in there.

451
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:33,220
What we're missing is just a few bits of information that we could put in there in some sort of

452
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:38,740
structure, like episode title, episode date, in a structured way that something could read.

453
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:43,140
And then our thinking is that what we'll do is upload that to the GitHub repo.

454
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:45,140
That'll be a repo probably for this.

455
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:49,500
And once it's in that repo, like a GitHub action kicks off and begins the whole process

456
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:50,500
there.

457
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:53,620
Or maybe either the website gets built from that.

458
00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:59,060
There's also something like we could generate a website, the website stuff too, from that

459
00:23:59,060 --> 00:24:00,060
information possibly.

460
00:24:00,060 --> 00:24:01,780
We could just do the generation from that information.

461
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:06,020
The other option is we just publish the RSS feed and the RSS feed gets updated and the

462
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:07,220
website generates off of that too.

463
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:12,980
So probably you, Alex, me, Brent, and Wes probably just all jump on a call at some point

464
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:18,940
and hash some of that out, you know, kick around a few ideas because we're pretty flexible.

465
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:21,900
And Wes could pretty much build anything we need on the back end to accommodate it.

466
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:22,900
So true.

467
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:26,300
We have good options.

468
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:31,920
You know, Dementor here in the live chat mentions, hey, Chris, why don't you do a Kickstarter

469
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:36,900
or something to build an open source version of Fireside?

470
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:38,500
We've heard this come up a few times.

471
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:43,140
Yeah, I think, you know, the way you would do that, right, is build it out for JB, make

472
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:44,140
it work.

473
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:51,220
And then it'd be another project to like identify what would have to be changed to make it portable.

474
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:53,860
And you know, you swap out, you swap out art, swap out names.

475
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:56,580
Like what would have to be changed to make that accomplished?

476
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:59,820
And then figure out from there what kind of a project we're looking at.

477
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:03,660
And if that's even something that would cost us anything, if it's worth raising funds for

478
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:08,420
like, you know, that would be down the road because it's very technical at the moment.

479
00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:12,180
We'd have to string a lot of different technologies together because we're using a lot of different

480
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:14,220
primitives together to build what we want.

481
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:19,860
We're not creating all the tools, but we're sure stringing a lot of tools together, essentially.

482
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:21,340
Yeah.

483
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:27,060
And that's actually the way you were talking about like authoring content and those other

484
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:28,060
things.

485
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:31,920
It makes it really tricky because you don't, I'm sure you guys don't want to share the

486
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:35,500
information too soon before the actual episode drops.

487
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:41,980
But if you didn't have that concern, it could all just be inside of GitHub and like a statically

488
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:48,780
hosted CMS or a serverless CMS, which is just, you host it on the actual website and it's

489
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:51,220
static and you just log into it.

490
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:56,780
And it transparently creates pull requests and other things based on your identity in

491
00:25:56,780 --> 00:26:02,340
GitHub, which would be where you could add all those extra specific tags that you want

492
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:04,420
to for each post.

493
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:06,540
But it also has to look into your tooling.

494
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:12,380
So there's solutions around what you guys are talking about.

495
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:15,820
It's just trying to figure out the best way to put it all together and what enables you

496
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:16,820
the most.

497
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:23,480
And I think what we'll do, and maybe inevitably, is start with office hours as a bit of a let's

498
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:24,480
try this approach.

499
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:27,700
I'll probably come on here and be like, okay, we've got a new feed.

500
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:31,820
If you want to try out the new feed, go subscribe over here and let's see how it works.

501
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:36,540
And then if we get that working, we'll probably try to figure it out for everything else from

502
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:37,540
there.

503
00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:38,540
Because office hours is kind of the test.

504
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:40,620
It'd be a great time to rename the show, too.

505
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:42,860
So like if you subscribe to the new feed, you get the new name.

506
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:44,820
And if you're on the old feed, you got the old name.

507
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:45,820
That'd be weird.

508
00:26:45,820 --> 00:26:47,380
That's how you bait people into switching.

509
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:48,380
Maybe.

510
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:51,060
Let's say give them more incentive.

511
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:53,020
Yeah, yeah, yeah, maybe.

512
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:54,020
All right.

513
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:55,140
Well, we will figure it out.

514
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:56,800
We have more website stuff to get to.

515
00:26:56,800 --> 00:27:02,220
So before we get there, I want to thank Linode for sponsoring this episode of office hours.

516
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:05,980
Linode.com slash Jupiter to get $100 credit for 60 days on a new account.

517
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:07,980
It's a great way to try things out.

518
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:10,340
We run our whole website infrastructure on there.

519
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:12,940
Everything we're talking about, let's build and it's running on Linode.

520
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:17,900
You know what else we run over there that I don't mention as much, but it has been absolutely

521
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:21,340
100% rock solid.

522
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:24,020
We use Linode for video streaming as well.

523
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:27,820
Pyrotube runs on Linode and I am very impressed.

524
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:34,660
They have plans specifically for streaming as well with really generous bandwidth plans,

525
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:38,860
transparent pricing, making it super easy for you to get things set up and running.

526
00:27:38,860 --> 00:27:42,840
They have a couple of different open source projects, video streaming and audio like radio

527
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:43,840
station style, too.

528
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:50,260
If you want to be an internet DJ, I've been floored, absolutely floored at what our Pyrotube

529
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:51,780
instance has been able to handle.

530
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:56,740
Of course, recently on Linux Unplugged, we deployed one of their cloud GPU rigs.

531
00:27:56,740 --> 00:27:57,740
That was fun.

532
00:27:57,740 --> 00:28:02,000
You know, if you're just an individual, you want a blog or a gaming server, Linode's great

533
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
for that as well.

534
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,920
They make it super simple to get started.

535
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:08,220
Maybe you've been doing this for 20 years, maybe it's your first server.

536
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:09,620
You're going to be able to figure it out.

537
00:28:09,620 --> 00:28:12,020
You get over there, you'll figure it out.

538
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:15,020
And with that $100, you can actually really try something.

539
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:17,980
Maybe deploy one of their systems and set up a snapshot and a backup and get a sense

540
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:18,980
of what that's like.

541
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:22,380
Get an idea of how fast it is to copy things around.

542
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:26,460
Maybe go deploy your own media server, you know, like they have a jellyfin one click

543
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:27,460
deployment.

544
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:29,660
Go try it out.

545
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:32,660
Linode.com slash Jupiter.

546
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:33,660
That's where you go.

547
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:36,700
Simple, affordable and accessible to everyone.

548
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:38,700
Linode.com slash Jupiter.

549
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:43,460
All right, so let's get into the website, gentlemen.

550
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:44,460
You ready?

551
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:45,460
Do you want to do a live deployment?

552
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:50,820
And I think the way we should do this is first tell everybody what it is we're deploying

553
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:54,700
and maybe while we're doing that, get it ready because we're doing it all live.

554
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:58,620
But who would like to take on the job of explaining what we're about to deploy and why it's super

555
00:28:58,620 --> 00:28:59,620
shiny?

556
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:02,980
And if you're watching live, pretty soon you'll be able to refresh and see it in real time.

557
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:04,980
I feel like Elray should take this one.

558
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:05,980
All right.

559
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:10,460
Elray, the guest of the show, tell us about this work and has it mostly all been yourself

560
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:12,260
as well that has been doing it?

561
00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:13,260
Definitely not.

562
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:16,700
I appreciate the early congratulations.

563
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:21,580
But I've helped out a little bit from some of the PRs and added a few features.

564
00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:23,260
But should we give some shout outs?

565
00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:25,420
Yeah, I actually have a bunch of shout outs.

566
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:26,420
OK.

567
00:29:26,420 --> 00:29:27,420
All right.

568
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:28,420
Good, good, good.

569
00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:30,020
But I didn't I didn't realize you had a flow.

570
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:31,020
I like it.

571
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:32,780
I just want to make sure we give credit where credit is due.

572
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:34,140
No, I appreciate it.

573
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:35,140
Thank you.

574
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:36,360
Because it's important.

575
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:39,940
We changed the default branch for the GitHub repo.

576
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:42,100
Well, Brent did.

577
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:46,020
Changed the default branch from main to develop.

578
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:52,340
And if anyone else is familiar with the technology called Git flow, that's kind of the mechanism

579
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:53,940
as to how we're going to be merging.

580
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:59,300
So people create feature branches or forks off of the actual main repo.

581
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:03,860
They merge to develop and then develop, then gets merged into main.

582
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:09,580
And so in this particular instance, we're taking all of the changes that have been batched

583
00:30:09,580 --> 00:30:13,500
up from I think it's probably the last office hours.

584
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:18,380
And we're taking all those changes and we're going to be synchronizing it over to main.

585
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:23,460
And specifically, the Jupyter broadcasting repo is actually a little bit different.

586
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:28,940
Because typically, that is the only way people commit is that you go from feature branch

587
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:31,900
to develop to main.

588
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:36,340
Since Jupyter broadcasting needs to have a little bit of a different workflow, whenever

589
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:42,340
new episodes get released, it's important that the main branch continues to get updates

590
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:44,580
of the new episodes that are released.

591
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:49,620
So that's been a bit of a tricky issue that we're trying to still figure out.

592
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:55,860
CG base player had caught it and submitted an issue initially, I had noticed it but hadn't

593
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:56,860
submitted it.

594
00:30:56,860 --> 00:30:58,740
So that's still something we're figuring out.

595
00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:05,260
But for now, just merging directly from develop to main, even with those extra commits works

596
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:06,460
perfectly fine.

597
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:08,620
Well, typically does.

598
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:12,900
You're updating the production site, but you don't want to push the changes and you also

599
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:16,580
have to put those same changes on the development site like a new episode.

600
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:21,620
So that is yeah, probably hard not to sneak in changes and updates, I would imagine with

601
00:31:21,620 --> 00:31:23,100
that setup.

602
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:30,860
It's been a bit of a funny change of mentality, I think, because now there are a few different

603
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:33,220
things happening in different places.

604
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:41,500
Like for instance, the scraper that goes and grabs information off a fireside at this time,

605
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:48,420
every time we publish a new episode, that is still committing its changes and updates

606
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:49,860
to the main branch.

607
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:51,780
So that hasn't really even changed.

608
00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:57,580
But what that means is that this development branch that we have is kind of outdated in

609
00:31:57,580 --> 00:32:01,860
terms of the episodes because they don't ever really show up there.

610
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:03,740
But that's not really why we have it.

611
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:08,580
We have this development branch to integrate new features and be able to test them there

612
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:11,380
before we push them to the actual main website.

613
00:32:11,380 --> 00:32:17,300
And I think it's a maybe a maturing of the way that we are developing the website because

614
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:23,740
previously we were sort of pushing every single change to the development site whenever we

615
00:32:23,740 --> 00:32:28,980
decided to merge it and that was a little risky and we did run into a few issues that

616
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:32,500
needed some quick fixing, you know?

617
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:36,220
Running with scissors, as they say, my friend, it's great, you know?

618
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:38,260
Nothing's faster than just publishing straight to production.

619
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:39,260
Yeah, no.

620
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:43,700
I was about to say, I might have been the cause for some of those issues a few times.

621
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:45,500
I think we all have been.

622
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:47,180
Yeah, no, it's good.

623
00:32:47,180 --> 00:32:48,180
I agree.

624
00:32:48,180 --> 00:32:52,540
Having a test branch, having a development branch is a really good idea.

625
00:32:52,540 --> 00:32:55,340
But I guess it's a pretty big change to make after the fact.

626
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:57,900
It probably would have been easier to start that way, I suppose.

627
00:32:57,900 --> 00:33:00,060
Yeah, I think, hmm, I wonder.

628
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:06,940
For me, it was easier to start the other way, only because I was new to GitHub.

629
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:11,220
And I feel like maybe for some new contributors, that was also the case.

630
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:15,580
But I wonder, Alray, for you, if you have a different opinion there.

631
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:21,180
The easiest way to get the most amount of impact is the most important thing to start

632
00:33:21,180 --> 00:33:22,180
out with.

633
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:29,220
So I think while in theory, doing a develop branch first and doing the whole Git flow

634
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:34,060
workflow is easier, long term.

635
00:33:34,060 --> 00:33:38,860
But if it's harder to start out with, then it's more important for you to actually start

636
00:33:38,860 --> 00:33:39,860
out with.

637
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:46,380
We had started discussing the idea of essentially having a more mature deployment strategy once

638
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:48,020
we did start to have issues.

639
00:33:48,020 --> 00:33:53,500
And so the community has been slowly expanding its maturity for the project in general.

640
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:58,300
And I think having the community grow with the project has been a really awesome experience

641
00:33:58,300 --> 00:34:02,780
just to be able to actually enjoy and see people mature.

642
00:34:02,780 --> 00:34:04,620
It's been neat from our vantage point as well.

643
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:09,420
So what we're publishing today while we're live is this structural change.

644
00:34:09,420 --> 00:34:11,260
And is there new things also going live?

645
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:14,580
We're taking from the development branch and taking some of that stuff and actually sending

646
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:15,780
it out to production today?

647
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:17,180
Is that what's happening?

648
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:21,140
Well, we have already implemented that change.

649
00:34:21,140 --> 00:34:27,700
So people have been committing their new pull requests to the develop branch for what about

650
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:28,700
two weeks now?

651
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:31,820
I think since the last office hours ish.

652
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:32,820
Maybe even longer than that.

653
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:37,620
It might have been there was a bit of a hairy period there where everyone was a little confused

654
00:34:37,620 --> 00:34:40,220
and we had to do some finicky work.

655
00:34:40,220 --> 00:34:44,120
But now it's just like, you don't even think about it, you know, someone putting a new

656
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:48,300
commit and it just defaults to the place it should go and it has been working well.

657
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:54,060
There is, it does mean there's an extra step, which is that from time to time, we as the

658
00:34:54,060 --> 00:35:00,620
maintainers need to synchronize all of the new PRS that we've merged and accepted.

659
00:35:00,620 --> 00:35:03,860
We need to synchronize those to production.

660
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:07,220
Because otherwise, they're just sitting there in that develop branch, not doing anything.

661
00:35:07,220 --> 00:35:12,100
And so that's what we're doing today is we're taking a number of pull requests that have

662
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:18,300
come in in the last two weeks and pushing it to production.

663
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:19,300
Are we ready?

664
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:22,720
Well, it kind of freaks me out because there are something like 74 commits and typically

665
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:25,140
that makes me very uncomfortable.

666
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:28,580
So if it's going to break, it'll be spectacular if it breaks.

667
00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:29,580
Yeah, absolutely.

668
00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:33,940
And it's from you know, if you just browse quickly, there are many different authors

669
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:34,940
in here.

670
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:39,740
And for me, that's kind of a new way to look at things because I'm used to like a pull

671
00:35:39,740 --> 00:35:46,340
request, typically having one author, maybe another offers author sneaked in there and

672
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:47,740
added a little change.

673
00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:49,700
But to see, you know, it's smart.

674
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:54,260
I mean, it's tagged as a piece of cake seems that's makes it sound simple.

675
00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:55,260
What could go wrong?

676
00:35:55,260 --> 00:36:00,820
I think that seems a little deceiving, doesn't it?

677
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:03,420
I feel like I feel like we should do it.

678
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:06,940
Well, it is true that all of this has already been vetted.

679
00:36:06,940 --> 00:36:11,340
And there's been some amazing conversation happening in each pull request.

680
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:13,320
And it has already been tested and everything.

681
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:16,820
So in theory, when I hit merge, it should just work.

682
00:36:16,820 --> 00:36:18,900
But I, you know, I'm always hesitant.

683
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:19,900
So I'm just gonna hit it.

684
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:20,900
Here we go.

685
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:21,900
Confirming.

686
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:22,900
Success.

687
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:23,900
All right.

688
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:34,980
Now it should, it'll take a little bit to deploy, but we'll test it in a sec.

689
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:36,220
Yeah, it's got to build now.

690
00:36:36,220 --> 00:36:37,220
It's got to build.

691
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:41,580
So in about a minute or two, we should have a new website update.

692
00:36:41,580 --> 00:36:43,660
So that's kind of exciting.

693
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:45,100
I'm looking forward to it.

694
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:48,900
And it means that the updates to the website are actually quite large.

695
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:51,960
Like there's a there are several features that will be added at a time.

696
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:54,060
So you can almost see it as like a point release or something.

697
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:55,760
So it's kind of exciting.

698
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:57,460
We have had some cool features land.

699
00:36:57,460 --> 00:37:00,300
Should we chat about those a little bit while we wait for it to build?

700
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:02,700
Is there any that jump out to you, Alex?

701
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:05,100
I actually was able to commit.

702
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:12,340
One of the main reasons why we had started to switch over from the only main branch to

703
00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:17,660
using the develop is that and it's still a work in progress for everyone else.

704
00:37:17,660 --> 00:37:24,500
But all of the changes that we now merge into develop actually go to a deploy preview.

705
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:29,380
And so we're able to see all the changes visually from the repo be built out on a third party

706
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:34,580
site and actually be able to audit them from there.

707
00:37:34,580 --> 00:37:41,100
So we're still working on it worked on my repository, of course, for some reason, whenever

708
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:46,740
we tried to implement it on the main JB website repository, it's no longer working.

709
00:37:46,740 --> 00:37:53,620
But we are working on making it to where all PRS actually get their own deploy preview

710
00:37:53,620 --> 00:37:54,860
instance.

711
00:37:54,860 --> 00:37:59,280
So that way, whenever people are reviewing PRS, they can just click on the deploy preview

712
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:04,900
link and be able to actually see the visual changes before they approve or accept it.

713
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:10,940
Currently, we're having to do it a bit more archaically to where we pull it down and review

714
00:38:10,940 --> 00:38:14,460
each individual change manually on our local machines.

715
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:19,820
So it'll be a nice adjustment once that actually gets fully working.

716
00:38:19,820 --> 00:38:23,060
That sounds like it'll make things a little quicker.

717
00:38:23,060 --> 00:38:27,060
I noticed, too, something that we really appreciated because we didn't even really ask for it.

718
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:30,460
But yet it landed was the automated sponsor page work.

719
00:38:30,460 --> 00:38:34,500
This is the kind of stuff that is a great example of just making the JB workflow smoother

720
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:35,780
behind the scenes.

721
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:38,060
And we didn't have to do anything.

722
00:38:38,060 --> 00:38:39,060
This is great.

723
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:40,660
It was just this was chance that did this.

724
00:38:40,660 --> 00:38:42,660
That's what I wanted to do.

725
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:48,580
I shout out the chance this PR specifically whenever he started it and he did an actual

726
00:38:48,580 --> 00:38:49,580
pull request.

727
00:38:49,580 --> 00:38:53,160
I was like, wow, this is really amazing.

728
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:58,140
He actually had done a lot of the Hugo functionality, almost everything that he did.

729
00:38:58,140 --> 00:39:01,860
I was like, wow, that's almost exactly how I would have thought to implement it.

730
00:39:01,860 --> 00:39:03,980
That's that's perfect.

731
00:39:03,980 --> 00:39:07,620
So it was really awesome to see that happen.

732
00:39:07,620 --> 00:39:10,540
And he did an amazing job with that.

733
00:39:10,540 --> 00:39:16,900
I think my first comment, even though I did ask for some changes, was like, wow, I was

734
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:21,060
really excited about this PR whenever I was reviewing it.

735
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:24,260
So where we were like, that's a great idea, somebody that gets it.

736
00:39:24,260 --> 00:39:26,700
And I think didn't we learn about it, Brent, during the road trip?

737
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:28,260
We're like, wow, here we are.

738
00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:31,980
You know, we're hustling on the road trip and the improvements keep rolling into the

739
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:32,980
website.

740
00:39:32,980 --> 00:39:35,220
Yeah, I was bouncing around in the passenger seat and I was like, Chris, you got to see

741
00:39:35,220 --> 00:39:37,220
what they're doing over here.

742
00:39:37,220 --> 00:39:39,900
And I know we did a little bit in the last office hours.

743
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:45,860
But now it's well, in theory, assuming what we just did is going to production properly,

744
00:39:45,860 --> 00:39:46,860
it's actually live.

745
00:39:46,860 --> 00:39:47,860
And it's not perfect.

746
00:39:47,860 --> 00:39:51,100
There's still things we need to tweak still, but it's like 90% there.

747
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:52,860
And I think it's a wonderful thing for us.

748
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:58,580
I was I think the reason this came was I was sitting in the passenger seat of lady jupes

749
00:39:58,580 --> 00:40:06,700
driving down I-5 and like an animal, I was changing the sponsorship page manually.

750
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:10,780
And in my pull request to do such I was like, can someone please make it so that this is

751
00:40:10,780 --> 00:40:15,940
the last time I need to do this and chance stepped up so thank you chance.

752
00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:16,940
That's great.

753
00:40:16,940 --> 00:40:19,060
Yes, thank you chance very much.

754
00:40:19,060 --> 00:40:24,220
For this specific PR, not necessarily a shout out, but something that I'm very happy.

755
00:40:24,220 --> 00:40:30,180
Initially Kyle Potts had done the initial contribution for our end to end testing.

756
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:36,460
And I was going to simply kind of refactor a little bit of stuff after he had submitted

757
00:40:36,460 --> 00:40:38,060
the PR.

758
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:46,500
But then we had the issue of the JB matrix had failed for its actual check.

759
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:51,980
And so I went and I added a check for that.

760
00:40:51,980 --> 00:40:53,700
And that spurred into a whole spiral.

761
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:54,700
Yeah, it sure did.

762
00:40:54,700 --> 00:40:55,700
Oh, man.

763
00:40:55,700 --> 00:41:04,940
It spurred into a whole spiral of I created a test that whenever I ran it worked locally.

764
00:41:04,940 --> 00:41:12,380
But whenever I did it through the CI on GitHub, it failed.

765
00:41:12,380 --> 00:41:21,940
And it also failed whenever we were running specifically it against the actual website.

766
00:41:21,940 --> 00:41:27,380
So it failed in the most important use case.

767
00:41:27,380 --> 00:41:33,060
And in a very odd instance, that it works locally, but it didn't work, even though we

768
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:35,260
were using the same exact things.

769
00:41:35,260 --> 00:41:41,060
So I ended up reworking how we're doing end to end testing completely.

770
00:41:41,060 --> 00:41:45,220
So that way, it's imitating the exact same way that we're deploying a Docker container

771
00:41:45,220 --> 00:41:47,020
using nginx.

772
00:41:47,020 --> 00:41:53,540
I am doing the exact same way that we're doing it for the website locally as well now.

773
00:41:53,540 --> 00:41:56,740
So we are no longer running into that issue.

774
00:41:56,740 --> 00:41:57,900
That's great.

775
00:41:57,900 --> 00:42:02,940
And I think that's just another example of like, I was I was partly worried that when

776
00:42:02,940 --> 00:42:07,000
we released the website, you know, on that live day when we hit go and everything went

777
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:12,060
live for the very first day, I was worried that all of our energy that we had produced

778
00:42:12,060 --> 00:42:16,740
as a community was going to kind of peter out because it was like, okay, we all got

779
00:42:16,740 --> 00:42:21,460
together and made this really amazing website and had the basic features that we needed.

780
00:42:21,460 --> 00:42:24,980
And, you know, we had a checklist of features, and most of those had been checked off.

781
00:42:24,980 --> 00:42:31,820
And I didn't know if that energy would have continued for a few months past that live

782
00:42:31,820 --> 00:42:32,820
date.

783
00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:35,020
What was that end of August?

784
00:42:35,020 --> 00:42:38,420
And it's actually kind of been the opposite.

785
00:42:38,420 --> 00:42:42,540
You know, some people have gotten busy and have had to step away for a bit.

786
00:42:42,540 --> 00:42:46,840
But really, the community just keeps showing up and keeps throwing features at this website

787
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:49,540
that we didn't even really know we needed.

788
00:42:49,540 --> 00:42:51,540
And actually, it turns out, they're amazing.

789
00:42:51,540 --> 00:42:56,860
And even like the end to end test, for example, someone, you know, cowpots came in and created

790
00:42:56,860 --> 00:43:00,400
that and was like, Oh, this is an amazing contribution, we definitely need it.

791
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:05,380
And then Elray, you just like took that concept and shaped it to make it even better.

792
00:43:05,380 --> 00:43:10,320
And it's just like, amazing to watch this website just keep growing and keep getting

793
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:12,780
better really, in all aspects.

794
00:43:12,780 --> 00:43:17,580
And also, it's great, because the website really is for the audience, it's not really

795
00:43:17,580 --> 00:43:18,740
for us as much.

796
00:43:18,740 --> 00:43:22,980
So we don't always have a great grasp of what people want out of our own website.

797
00:43:22,980 --> 00:43:25,740
As stupid as that sounds, it's actually true.

798
00:43:25,740 --> 00:43:31,100
We don't really, unless we tell ourselves and force ourselves, use the website, go use

799
00:43:31,100 --> 00:43:34,100
the website, like it's just, we don't, we have all this stuff, it's right here on my

800
00:43:34,100 --> 00:43:35,100
file server, right?

801
00:43:35,100 --> 00:43:36,340
It's just not the way we think about it.

802
00:43:36,340 --> 00:43:41,260
So it's really great to have somebody that has the perspective of an audience member,

803
00:43:41,260 --> 00:43:44,660
looking at it, making this better for audience members.

804
00:43:44,660 --> 00:43:48,860
That part of it is really, I think, the secret sauce of this website, because it's just not

805
00:43:48,860 --> 00:43:50,740
something we have eyes on in that way.

806
00:43:50,740 --> 00:43:55,560
As hard as we try, we just, just not where our minds at.

807
00:43:55,560 --> 00:43:56,560
So that's pretty great.

808
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:57,560
Well, okay.

809
00:43:57,560 --> 00:43:58,560
I think it's deployed.

810
00:43:58,560 --> 00:43:59,560
Is it?

811
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:00,560
How do we know?

812
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:02,420
I refreshed and it loaded.

813
00:44:02,420 --> 00:44:03,960
So that seemed like a good sign.

814
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:09,300
So one of the ways that, or one of the things we actually need to work on improving, the

815
00:44:09,300 --> 00:44:13,700
way that I know that it went live is because underneath Linux Unplugged, it says Linux

816
00:44:13,700 --> 00:44:16,880
or Linode cloud hosting instead of just Linode.

817
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:18,720
That's something we're going to work on.

818
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:22,780
It's part of the automated sponsorship.

819
00:44:22,780 --> 00:44:26,340
So some of these things, actually, I think it's a good sign that we're not noticing because

820
00:44:26,340 --> 00:44:27,820
it means nothing broke.

821
00:44:27,820 --> 00:44:28,820
Yeah.

822
00:44:28,820 --> 00:44:29,820
Yeah.

823
00:44:29,820 --> 00:44:30,820
It's up.

824
00:44:30,820 --> 00:44:31,820
It's up.

825
00:44:31,820 --> 00:44:32,820
Well done.

826
00:44:32,820 --> 00:44:33,820
Well, you know what you get?

827
00:44:33,820 --> 00:44:34,820
You get a happy applause.

828
00:44:34,820 --> 00:44:35,820
Yeah.

829
00:44:35,820 --> 00:44:36,820
There they go.

830
00:44:36,820 --> 00:44:37,820
See how happy they are.

831
00:44:37,820 --> 00:44:38,820
Oh, they love it.

832
00:44:38,820 --> 00:44:39,820
Oh man.

833
00:44:39,820 --> 00:44:40,820
They love it so much.

834
00:44:40,820 --> 00:44:41,820
They're happy.

835
00:44:41,820 --> 00:44:43,860
They're very happy about it.

836
00:44:43,860 --> 00:44:44,860
Well done.

837
00:44:44,860 --> 00:44:48,340
One of the other small things that wasn't something I don't think anyone would have

838
00:44:48,340 --> 00:44:54,100
noticed unless actually running into this issue is that specifically for CoderRadio,

839
00:44:54,100 --> 00:44:57,740
they use the tag of C sharp.

840
00:44:57,740 --> 00:45:01,720
And whenever you tried to click on that, since there's a symbol in there and the pound sign

841
00:45:01,720 --> 00:45:08,260
can be interpreted by the actual address bar, it screwed up being able to navigate to it.

842
00:45:08,260 --> 00:45:11,700
And you could only navigate to C whenever you clicked on C sharp.

843
00:45:11,700 --> 00:45:12,700
Frickin CoderRadio.

844
00:45:12,700 --> 00:45:13,700
I know.

845
00:45:13,700 --> 00:45:15,700
They're monsters over there.

846
00:45:15,700 --> 00:45:21,060
But now you can click on whenever you see C sharp as a tag, you can click on it and

847
00:45:21,060 --> 00:45:23,100
it actually goes to C sharp.

848
00:45:23,100 --> 00:45:29,020
What a fascinating way to view Jupyter broadcasting topics is by tag.

849
00:45:29,020 --> 00:45:31,960
I never really do that, but we sure talk about Nextcloud a lot.

850
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:35,380
Look at all these shows where we talk about Nextcloud.

851
00:45:35,380 --> 00:45:36,940
Linux Action News episode three.

852
00:45:36,940 --> 00:45:38,420
How about that?

853
00:45:38,420 --> 00:45:39,420
Oh my.

854
00:45:39,420 --> 00:45:40,420
Yeah.

855
00:45:40,420 --> 00:45:45,580
The whole reason why I ended up finding that was because I was trying to deploy on Netlify

856
00:45:45,580 --> 00:45:52,740
and they said you couldn't have pound signs in file names and I was like, what?

857
00:45:52,740 --> 00:45:53,740
What do you mean?

858
00:45:53,740 --> 00:45:55,340
There are no pound signs.

859
00:45:55,340 --> 00:46:00,140
And then it was because they were taking the generated content and using that instead and

860
00:46:00,140 --> 00:46:01,940
they had that restriction.

861
00:46:01,940 --> 00:46:04,860
So that was the only reason why that was found.

862
00:46:04,860 --> 00:46:10,020
It was because it was preventing me from trying to implement the deploy preview months earlier.

863
00:46:10,020 --> 00:46:17,340
Back in my day, you only had eight characters in a file name and it was all lowercase.

864
00:46:17,340 --> 00:46:18,340
Actually weren't they all uppercase?

865
00:46:18,340 --> 00:46:19,340
Sure.

866
00:46:19,340 --> 00:46:20,340
Either way.

867
00:46:20,340 --> 00:46:21,340
Go for it.

868
00:46:21,340 --> 00:46:23,180
Elray, I have some questions for you.

869
00:46:23,180 --> 00:46:28,140
Give me a sense from your perspective of what the community around this website project

870
00:46:28,140 --> 00:46:29,140
has been like.

871
00:46:29,140 --> 00:46:32,500
Cause I know we have a perspective, which is that you guys are awesome, but I'm curious.

872
00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:37,580
It seems like you've worked on some other projects, both professionally and maybe some

873
00:46:37,580 --> 00:46:38,820
open source stuff as well.

874
00:46:38,820 --> 00:46:42,980
So can you give us a sense from, you know, you on the other side over there, what it's

875
00:46:42,980 --> 00:46:43,980
been like?

876
00:46:43,980 --> 00:46:46,820
Well, first off, I think everyone else in the audience is really awesome.

877
00:46:46,820 --> 00:46:51,300
So I will definitely say that I don't know if I am, but they are for sure.

878
00:46:51,300 --> 00:46:52,300
Humble.

879
00:46:52,300 --> 00:46:57,340
So it's been really interesting to kind of see the passing of the torch.

880
00:46:57,340 --> 00:47:03,180
So I know that initially Stefan and Cairo were the main people that were kind of driving

881
00:47:03,180 --> 00:47:04,980
this initiative.

882
00:47:04,980 --> 00:47:09,740
And as I started to kind of contribute more and try to be more of a serious contributor,

883
00:47:09,740 --> 00:47:12,620
I was able to help them out.

884
00:47:12,620 --> 00:47:18,540
And now people are mentioning helping me out by reviewing things and it feels weird, but

885
00:47:18,540 --> 00:47:24,180
it's been really awesome is that as I've become more of a serious contributor and trying to

886
00:47:24,180 --> 00:47:31,740
contribute in other ways, like creating issues or commenting on different people's PRs that

887
00:47:31,740 --> 00:47:35,220
I've slowly been given more privileges as well.

888
00:47:35,220 --> 00:47:41,660
And that's helped open how I can continue to give more value for the value you guys

889
00:47:41,660 --> 00:47:43,100
give me already.

890
00:47:43,100 --> 00:47:51,360
So I've become more of a initial drive by contributor to being I would consider myself

891
00:47:51,360 --> 00:47:53,500
probably maintain a maintainer.

892
00:47:53,500 --> 00:47:59,940
And so initially, I actually had been messaging Stefan about, hey, I wanted to do this thing

893
00:47:59,940 --> 00:48:04,260
that I noticed because of something that you had done for your initial MVP.

894
00:48:04,260 --> 00:48:08,960
And that was before it was actually changed to the official MVP.

895
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:16,020
And so I had tried to start working on it, and then I got super loaded with work.

896
00:48:16,020 --> 00:48:19,020
And so I wasn't able to actually work on it at all.

897
00:48:19,020 --> 00:48:21,380
And it continued to progress forward.

898
00:48:21,380 --> 00:48:29,300
And so I was able to months later, come back and then started being more of a serious contributor.

899
00:48:29,300 --> 00:48:33,000
And as I had my workload lighten up.

900
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:40,180
So it went from me really wanting to help out and not being able to and then eventually

901
00:48:40,180 --> 00:48:44,420
finding the time to actually be more of a serious contributor.

902
00:48:44,420 --> 00:48:49,260
It's been really awesome to kind of see, as I've made this journey, other people are certain

903
00:48:49,260 --> 00:48:52,300
to make their journeys at different points as well.

904
00:48:52,300 --> 00:48:58,020
The community has continued to just be amazing.

905
00:48:58,020 --> 00:49:05,060
So I remember I was going back to, I think it was Chance's, Chance M's first PR, whenever

906
00:49:05,060 --> 00:49:08,740
he was telling me something about white space, and it was going to reference that for another

907
00:49:08,740 --> 00:49:11,100
PR that someone had done.

908
00:49:11,100 --> 00:49:18,680
And whenever I had, and I often feel this way, I'm more of a vocal critic, because there's

909
00:49:18,680 --> 00:49:22,820
some of the technical things that people are new to.

910
00:49:22,820 --> 00:49:28,620
And so just trying to kind of help guide them, I end up pointing out a lot of things whenever

911
00:49:28,620 --> 00:49:32,860
other people just kind of tend to approve it because it aesthetically looks good, which

912
00:49:32,860 --> 00:49:34,780
is the part that I actually struggle with.

913
00:49:34,780 --> 00:49:37,420
So it's good that there are people that do that.

914
00:49:37,420 --> 00:49:42,060
See, but you say critic there, but I've watched your contributions.

915
00:49:42,060 --> 00:49:47,260
And I would say they're more, I would call it more mentorship, because you tend to be

916
00:49:47,260 --> 00:49:49,660
like, hey, this is great, and it works.

917
00:49:49,660 --> 00:49:54,820
But this might be a more Hugo way of doing it, or this may be a more, you have this special

918
00:49:54,820 --> 00:49:59,980
term that I love that I can't remember that is about only having things in one place,

919
00:49:59,980 --> 00:50:01,980
but get used a bunch of times and

920
00:50:01,980 --> 00:50:04,740
idempotent or reusable or dry.

921
00:50:04,740 --> 00:50:05,740
Dry, that's the one.

922
00:50:05,740 --> 00:50:06,740
There you go.

923
00:50:06,740 --> 00:50:07,740
You hit it.

924
00:50:07,740 --> 00:50:08,740
Yeah.

925
00:50:08,740 --> 00:50:12,300
So I would call you, you know, you've been an amazing mentor in this project as well

926
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:13,980
that I've really appreciated.

927
00:50:13,980 --> 00:50:15,740
So don't be too hard on yourself.

928
00:50:15,740 --> 00:50:18,220
I definitely try to.

929
00:50:18,220 --> 00:50:22,060
But I remember reviewing his first PR and there were quite a few comments.

930
00:50:22,060 --> 00:50:26,960
And then like I had made the comment earlier of, I saw his latest PR and I was astounded

931
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:28,580
with how amazing it was.

932
00:50:28,580 --> 00:50:33,780
So it was, it's been awesome to kind of see people contribute and continue to grow in

933
00:50:33,780 --> 00:50:39,060
their technical knowledge and acumen about the project and becoming more serious contributors

934
00:50:39,060 --> 00:50:40,280
as well.

935
00:50:40,280 --> 00:50:45,040
So it's been really awesome to kind of see that progression from the outside, the maturity

936
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:50,700
of JB's repository specifically, it's been an ever growing thing.

937
00:50:50,700 --> 00:50:58,860
I've contributed a little bit to one contribution to the Ansible communities repository for

938
00:50:58,860 --> 00:51:02,580
a specific small change that was failing over there.

939
00:51:02,580 --> 00:51:06,180
And they have like an entire automated CI system and other things.

940
00:51:06,180 --> 00:51:08,200
So like they're really mature.

941
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:13,220
And I'd say we're definitely at least in the middle because we do have automated things

942
00:51:13,220 --> 00:51:18,540
where we're doing checks and other things to make sure that we're continuing to improve

943
00:51:18,540 --> 00:51:21,740
and giving fast feedback to users.

944
00:51:21,740 --> 00:51:27,020
So we've definitely got, we're growing and we're not there to the finish line yet, but

945
00:51:27,020 --> 00:51:31,580
we're definitely at least probably, I'd say 50% for the maturity of what I would consider

946
00:51:31,580 --> 00:51:33,220
a mature open source project.

947
00:51:33,220 --> 00:51:35,180
Oh, we're all grown up.

948
00:51:35,180 --> 00:51:36,180
Look at that.

949
00:51:36,180 --> 00:51:37,180
At least halfway there.

950
00:51:37,180 --> 00:51:42,180
Well, it's better than where we were before.

951
00:51:42,180 --> 00:51:43,180
Okay.

952
00:51:43,180 --> 00:51:50,020
Well, that brings me to, I think maybe one last question, which is what can we do better?

953
00:51:50,020 --> 00:51:53,700
Because I feel like, you know, okay, we're 50% there, but there's a lot of room to grow.

954
00:51:53,700 --> 00:52:00,680
So from a, less from a features in the website perspective, but more from a, you know, how

955
00:52:00,680 --> 00:52:06,780
we're helping people contribute and how we're managing contributions perspective, what do

956
00:52:06,780 --> 00:52:09,060
you think is the next step for us?

957
00:52:09,060 --> 00:52:11,620
There's definitely a few different ways to proceed.

958
00:52:11,620 --> 00:52:15,840
One of them that I think I've attempted to do it in the past, but just haven't really

959
00:52:15,840 --> 00:52:22,420
had any time to do it currently is figuring out a way to make the issues be in a more

960
00:52:22,420 --> 00:52:25,220
interpretable layout.

961
00:52:25,220 --> 00:52:30,220
So currently everyone kind of just has to peruse issues directly inside of GitHub, which

962
00:52:30,220 --> 00:52:34,740
can be difficult for people if they're just trying to do a quick contribution here or

963
00:52:34,740 --> 00:52:40,780
there, figuring out a way to either use the projects tab inside of GitHub or something

964
00:52:40,780 --> 00:52:41,780
like that.

965
00:52:41,780 --> 00:52:45,540
So where we can point people towards, Hey, if you want to do something, this is where

966
00:52:45,540 --> 00:52:46,540
you go.

967
00:52:46,540 --> 00:52:49,500
And it's easy to see, these are the things that need to be worked on.

968
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:53,780
These are the things that currently being worked on and the labels that Brent has made

969
00:52:53,780 --> 00:52:57,580
has definitely helped and it helps kind of give a fast feedback.

970
00:52:57,580 --> 00:53:03,660
It's just being able to kind of give like a higher overview of like what is available.

971
00:53:03,660 --> 00:53:04,660
That's a really good point.

972
00:53:04,660 --> 00:53:06,820
And that's been suggested to me previously.

973
00:53:06,820 --> 00:53:11,500
I've spent some time in that project's view and it's been mentioned that that would be

974
00:53:11,500 --> 00:53:13,220
a really great thing to have.

975
00:53:13,220 --> 00:53:17,060
I just haven't quite wrapped my head around it yet, so I think I got some homework there.

976
00:53:17,060 --> 00:53:18,060
Definitely.

977
00:53:18,060 --> 00:53:19,620
It's a good suggestion.

978
00:53:19,620 --> 00:53:21,340
It's a good suggestion.

979
00:53:21,340 --> 00:53:24,340
I could definitely see that being a way to like, okay, I want to get started.

980
00:53:24,340 --> 00:53:25,380
Where do I start?

981
00:53:25,380 --> 00:53:28,580
And I can see that being a way to help people figure that out.

982
00:53:28,580 --> 00:53:35,580
I think another thing that as we continue to mature how people contribute to us, integrating

983
00:53:35,580 --> 00:53:41,660
tests as people integrate contributions is going to be important.

984
00:53:41,660 --> 00:53:49,500
So for example, CGBasePlayer, he did a contribution recently and he actually submitted a test

985
00:53:49,500 --> 00:53:50,500
for it as well.

986
00:53:50,500 --> 00:53:53,140
And I was like, oh, I wasn't expecting that.

987
00:53:53,140 --> 00:53:57,620
It was really awesome to actually see his contribution and see that the accompanying

988
00:53:57,620 --> 00:53:58,620
test was there.

989
00:53:58,620 --> 00:54:01,900
I had mentioned it on the issue saying, hey, it'd be a good idea to have a test there as

990
00:54:01,900 --> 00:54:02,900
well.

991
00:54:02,900 --> 00:54:06,500
And that was for the form submission issue, I just remembered, where if you hit submit

992
00:54:06,500 --> 00:54:10,980
and it failed, the actual submit button would disappear past the iframe.

993
00:54:10,980 --> 00:54:11,980
In the contact form.

994
00:54:11,980 --> 00:54:13,940
Yeah, in the contact form.

995
00:54:13,940 --> 00:54:17,540
So he actually made a test for it as well, which was really awesome.

996
00:54:17,540 --> 00:54:19,780
Somebody's got to write that test.

997
00:54:19,780 --> 00:54:22,180
So yeah, that's great.

998
00:54:22,180 --> 00:54:23,180
All right.

999
00:54:23,180 --> 00:54:24,980
Well, let's get to some boosts.

1000
00:54:24,980 --> 00:54:26,420
True Grits boosted in.

1001
00:54:26,420 --> 00:54:29,100
Four score and seven boosts ago.

1002
00:54:29,100 --> 00:54:31,220
With an enterprise boost.

1003
00:54:31,220 --> 00:54:38,700
Yeah, 1701 sat something I've noticed as a listener is that on your road trips, you try

1004
00:54:38,700 --> 00:54:42,340
and cram a bunch of traveling into a short period of time.

1005
00:54:42,340 --> 00:54:48,640
What if you tried to space out the trips and stay in places for just a bit longer or maybe

1006
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:51,980
drive shorter distances at a time?

1007
00:54:51,980 --> 00:54:55,560
Also how large of a project would it be to just lose the remote connection to the studio

1008
00:54:55,560 --> 00:54:57,380
and just record everything at the RV?

1009
00:54:57,380 --> 00:55:00,660
To me, sounds like that would solve a lot of issues.

1010
00:55:00,660 --> 00:55:02,400
Why didn't you think any of that, Brent?

1011
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:07,020
This is actually a multi-year conversation we've been having.

1012
00:55:07,020 --> 00:55:11,220
And these seem like obvious solutions.

1013
00:55:11,220 --> 00:55:16,460
However, it turns out that there is a lot more complexity in the background than we

1014
00:55:16,460 --> 00:55:19,380
tend to lead on all the time.

1015
00:55:19,380 --> 00:55:24,220
Some of that complexity is just like other outside factors that we can't even control.

1016
00:55:24,220 --> 00:55:29,240
Yeah, you know, family, kids, jobs, show production schedules.

1017
00:55:29,240 --> 00:55:31,640
That's truly what sets the pace of a road trip.

1018
00:55:31,640 --> 00:55:38,500
We start with a road trip plan that's like a month plus long and then we figure out how

1019
00:55:38,500 --> 00:55:43,940
to whittle it down to just as quick as possible because we just feel, I feel like there's

1020
00:55:43,940 --> 00:55:48,180
no better way to age me than just to constantly put me into a pressure cooker.

1021
00:55:48,180 --> 00:55:51,080
And so why not just get right to it?

1022
00:55:51,080 --> 00:55:54,220
It's just that, you know, I got three young kids, so there's that element of it and it's

1023
00:55:54,220 --> 00:55:55,500
just the way it is.

1024
00:55:55,500 --> 00:55:58,900
But we will always be experimenting with ways to make it more sustainable.

1025
00:55:58,900 --> 00:56:02,860
I think we're working on a path to sustainability.

1026
00:56:02,860 --> 00:56:07,860
And as far as doing the shows in the RV, if we have really solid connectivity, like Starlink's

1027
00:56:07,860 --> 00:56:11,300
really rocking or something like that, we have and can do.

1028
00:56:11,300 --> 00:56:15,340
But if we have limited connectivity, like say maybe we only have a singular LTE connection,

1029
00:56:15,340 --> 00:56:19,300
maybe it's only like at half strength, then it's actually a little bit better to offload

1030
00:56:19,300 --> 00:56:22,540
a lot of like the streaming and the remote connectivity to the studio.

1031
00:56:22,540 --> 00:56:28,360
And then we just have to establish one decent quality Opus audio stream to the studio.

1032
00:56:28,360 --> 00:56:32,780
And as long as the Internet connection is powerful enough to just get that Opus audio

1033
00:56:32,780 --> 00:56:36,340
back and forth, we can do a show and then we can mix in the studio and whatnot.

1034
00:56:36,340 --> 00:56:40,420
Of course, it requires a whole bunch of remote tools and whatnot.

1035
00:56:40,420 --> 00:56:47,260
But when I am an older man, probably, you know, 10 years from now and maybe less, who

1036
00:56:47,260 --> 00:56:49,660
knows, times seem to be flying with the kids.

1037
00:56:49,660 --> 00:56:55,620
But when the kids are older and dad isn't, you know, awesome and great to hang out with

1038
00:56:55,620 --> 00:56:58,660
and they've got their own friends and their own things and their own cars, maybe I will

1039
00:56:58,660 --> 00:57:00,540
go for longer road trips.

1040
00:57:00,540 --> 00:57:01,540
You never know.

1041
00:57:01,540 --> 00:57:03,940
That's that'll be my might be a little podcasting nomad.

1042
00:57:03,940 --> 00:57:04,940
Yeah.

1043
00:57:04,940 --> 00:57:08,060
And that'll be my reconciliation for the fact that my kids don't have anything to do with

1044
00:57:08,060 --> 00:57:09,060
me.

1045
00:57:09,060 --> 00:57:12,240
Rustic Castaversa comes in with a thousand sats.

1046
00:57:12,240 --> 00:57:17,260
So I know this whole episode has been about tough travel, of course, last week's episode.

1047
00:57:17,260 --> 00:57:22,300
But if you ever thought about doing a ham show with Noah, there is a museum in Minnesota

1048
00:57:22,300 --> 00:57:25,580
that works and would be really a cool place to do the show.

1049
00:57:25,580 --> 00:57:28,420
It's called the Pavek, P-A-V-E-K Museum.

1050
00:57:28,420 --> 00:57:33,700
I'll have a link in the show notes, Minnesota's source for the history of electronic communication.

1051
00:57:33,700 --> 00:57:36,780
That actually looks like a really cool place to do a show from.

1052
00:57:36,780 --> 00:57:37,780
Wow.

1053
00:57:37,780 --> 00:57:39,860
Chris, I had never considered doing the show in a museum.

1054
00:57:39,860 --> 00:57:45,140
We always pictured like a theater or I love this all of a sudden.

1055
00:57:45,140 --> 00:57:46,980
It's way cool.

1056
00:57:46,980 --> 00:57:52,220
You know, we have a really cool museum of electricity about 30, 40 minutes north of

1057
00:57:52,220 --> 00:57:53,220
the studio.

1058
00:57:53,220 --> 00:57:54,220
Really?

1059
00:57:54,220 --> 00:57:55,220
You've never mentioned this to me before.

1060
00:57:55,220 --> 00:57:59,220
It used to be the after party for Linux Fest Northwest when it was a smaller event.

1061
00:57:59,220 --> 00:58:02,180
And they've got they've got a Tesla cage in there where they'll you know, you can stand

1062
00:58:02,180 --> 00:58:05,460
in there and they'll zap you with lightning and it goes all over the cage.

1063
00:58:05,460 --> 00:58:08,340
And they've got tons of old radio stuff in there.

1064
00:58:08,340 --> 00:58:10,260
So every time someone does a boost, it'll zap us.

1065
00:58:10,260 --> 00:58:11,260
Oh, that'd be cool.

1066
00:58:11,260 --> 00:58:15,180
As long as you got the Tesla coil charged up, as long as you got lightning network,

1067
00:58:15,180 --> 00:58:16,180
it's pretty awesome.

1068
00:58:16,180 --> 00:58:17,660
Yeah, it is.

1069
00:58:17,660 --> 00:58:19,340
Wise Papa John used it.

1070
00:58:19,340 --> 00:58:20,560
Two thousand sats.

1071
00:58:20,560 --> 00:58:21,560
Love the show, guys.

1072
00:58:21,560 --> 00:58:26,340
It started on self hosted over a year ago and I still haven't found a Raspberry Pi

1073
00:58:26,340 --> 00:58:27,340
for sale.

1074
00:58:27,340 --> 00:58:29,380
But thanks for everything else, fellas.

1075
00:58:29,380 --> 00:58:34,660
And by the way, if anyone is in the Memphis area, he also sent another 222 sats and has

1076
00:58:34,660 --> 00:58:36,020
a Pi for sale.

1077
00:58:36,020 --> 00:58:37,020
Let's talk.

1078
00:58:37,020 --> 00:58:40,900
Well, Chris, you mentioned a new little computer that you got in Linux Unplugged.

1079
00:58:40,900 --> 00:58:42,260
What was the name of it?

1080
00:58:42,260 --> 00:58:43,260
Right.

1081
00:58:43,260 --> 00:58:44,260
The old Droid H3.

1082
00:58:44,260 --> 00:58:45,260
Brantley.

1083
00:58:45,260 --> 00:58:46,260
What do they say?

1084
00:58:46,260 --> 00:58:47,260
The Raspberry Pi color.

1085
00:58:47,260 --> 00:58:48,260
Yeah, we'll see.

1086
00:58:48,260 --> 00:58:49,660
I have it in for testing.

1087
00:58:49,660 --> 00:58:56,740
My RAM and MVME drive are supposed to arrive today, maybe while we're doing the show.

1088
00:58:56,740 --> 00:59:00,980
So I'm going to hustle up on getting that going and I'll report back because I'm pretty

1089
00:59:00,980 --> 00:59:01,980
excited about it.

1090
00:59:01,980 --> 00:59:03,140
I'm done with the Pi, I think.

1091
00:59:03,140 --> 00:59:08,520
I think I'm I mean, I have I have no ill will towards the Pi, but I just think I'm moving

1092
00:59:08,520 --> 00:59:12,340
on from the Pi with this with that old Droid H3.

1093
00:59:12,340 --> 00:59:15,980
Two SATA ports plus MVME.

1094
00:59:15,980 --> 00:59:16,980
That's pretty good.

1095
00:59:16,980 --> 00:59:18,780
The only thing that would make it better is if it had built in Wi-Fi.

1096
00:59:18,780 --> 00:59:22,120
It does not, but it does have four USB ports.

1097
00:59:22,120 --> 00:59:25,220
And if it had Intel NICs instead of Realtek NICs.

1098
00:59:25,220 --> 00:59:29,100
But I'm just happy they're not on the USB bus.

1099
00:59:29,100 --> 00:59:31,980
Austin Matt boots in with 69, 69 SATs.

1100
00:59:31,980 --> 00:59:33,980
Coming in hot with the boost.

1101
00:59:33,980 --> 00:59:35,900
Here's a show name idea.

1102
00:59:35,900 --> 00:59:36,900
Captain's Quarters.

1103
00:59:36,900 --> 00:59:40,620
Kind of keeps the same vibes as Office Hours, spatially at least.

1104
00:59:40,620 --> 00:59:42,540
Everyone's coming in to hang out in your quarters.

1105
00:59:42,540 --> 00:59:46,540
And it also kind of keeps it up with a potential space theme with a little Star Trek vibe.

1106
00:59:46,540 --> 00:59:47,540
I like it.

1107
00:59:47,540 --> 00:59:52,500
I think Captain's Quarters would suffer from the same issue that Office Hours suffers from.

1108
00:59:52,500 --> 00:59:53,500
Right.

1109
00:59:53,500 --> 00:59:54,500
But at least we're with our crew.

1110
00:59:54,500 --> 00:59:55,500
Yeah, I like that.

1111
00:59:55,500 --> 00:59:58,900
I do like the idea that the J.B. audience we call our crew.

1112
00:59:58,900 --> 01:00:02,020
But everybody's going to expect us to talk about Star Trek constantly.

1113
01:00:02,020 --> 01:00:03,020
Don't we?

1114
01:00:03,020 --> 01:00:06,660
You know, it's like it'd be a Captain Pike hair review podcast where we only talk about

1115
01:00:06,660 --> 01:00:10,700
Captain Pike's great hair and how to get my hair to the level of Captain Pike's great

1116
01:00:10,700 --> 01:00:11,700
hair.

1117
01:00:11,700 --> 01:00:12,700
Yeah, I like the idea, though.

1118
01:00:12,700 --> 01:00:16,820
I like I get where you're going, Austin Matt, with like the vibe and this and the space

1119
01:00:16,820 --> 01:00:18,060
connection.

1120
01:00:18,060 --> 01:00:20,220
I think I think the new name should keep that up.

1121
01:00:20,220 --> 01:00:22,660
So do keep the suggestions coming in.

1122
01:00:22,660 --> 01:00:23,660
If you would.

1123
01:00:23,660 --> 01:00:24,660
J.L.T.

1124
01:00:24,660 --> 01:00:27,220
Gordon boost in twenty five hundred sats boost.

1125
01:00:27,220 --> 01:00:32,100
How about TNG, the next generation as a show name?

1126
01:00:32,100 --> 01:00:36,400
And you could do TNG dot Jupiter broadcasting dot com space related.

1127
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:40,000
And it's clear it's about Jupiter broadcasting.

1128
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,140
So J.B. the next generation.

1129
01:00:42,140 --> 01:00:43,140
You know what?

1130
01:00:43,140 --> 01:00:45,340
It worked for one show that seemed to be pretty popular.

1131
01:00:45,340 --> 01:00:48,140
So maybe maybe.

1132
01:00:48,140 --> 01:00:52,060
And it looks like Gene Bean is our baller booster this episode with thirteen thousand

1133
01:00:52,060 --> 01:00:54,740
three hundred and seventy sats.

1134
01:00:54,740 --> 01:00:56,260
Hot take while you're still talking.

1135
01:00:56,260 --> 01:01:01,340
The consumable website is something I really like the idea of, but I want it to still work

1136
01:01:01,340 --> 01:01:03,540
if I'm using a hosting company like Buzzsprout.

1137
01:01:03,540 --> 01:01:09,100
I love the idea of using it as the feed, as a source of truth for large portions of it,

1138
01:01:09,100 --> 01:01:10,100
though.

1139
01:01:10,100 --> 01:01:14,020
I just want to be able to offload things like download infrastructure and host to a hosting

1140
01:01:14,020 --> 01:01:15,020
provider.

1141
01:01:15,020 --> 01:01:17,180
Yeah, you get a you get a half ding on that one.

1142
01:01:17,180 --> 01:01:18,180
I agree, Gene Bean.

1143
01:01:18,180 --> 01:01:21,660
When we're looking at this, that seems to be the tricky bit.

1144
01:01:21,660 --> 01:01:27,820
These MP3 files are big in relative terms to HTTP, general types of traffic, and you

1145
01:01:27,820 --> 01:01:31,140
want them to be very fast and you want them to be fast.

1146
01:01:31,140 --> 01:01:33,380
If you're in New Zealand, you want them to be fast.

1147
01:01:33,380 --> 01:01:35,040
If you're in Australia, you want them to be fast.

1148
01:01:35,040 --> 01:01:41,640
If you're in Austin, right, it's it's a tricky problem to solve when you consider that the

1149
01:01:41,640 --> 01:01:47,200
nature of a podcast is that when it gets released, it's potential that tens of thousands of people

1150
01:01:47,200 --> 01:01:48,860
go hit that file.

1151
01:01:48,860 --> 01:01:51,660
It's usually spread out over a 24 hour period, so it's not quite that bad.

1152
01:01:51,660 --> 01:01:57,900
But you don't you don't want the downloads to be slow because I've been that guy who's

1153
01:01:57,900 --> 01:02:03,260
out in the car just like waiting for that that MP3 to finish downloading so I can start

1154
01:02:03,260 --> 01:02:06,500
my drive and just thinking, why don't they have a better CDN?

1155
01:02:06,500 --> 01:02:08,960
I don't want you to ever worry about that with JB stuff.

1156
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:11,060
So I agree, Gene Bean, that is the tricky part.

1157
01:02:11,060 --> 01:02:16,700
I am considering Cloudflare R2 on top of maybe like Linode object storage or something like

1158
01:02:16,700 --> 01:02:17,700
that.

1159
01:02:17,700 --> 01:02:18,700
Going to experiment with office hours.

1160
01:02:18,700 --> 01:02:25,060
I basically I've come to the conclusion that we got to eff around to find out.

1161
01:02:25,060 --> 01:02:28,380
And depending on how much we eff around, that's how much we'll find out.

1162
01:02:28,380 --> 01:02:32,220
And so I'm going to eff around with office hours and find out is the conclusion I've

1163
01:02:32,220 --> 01:02:33,220
come to.

1164
01:02:33,220 --> 01:02:34,220
This is where we break things.

1165
01:02:34,220 --> 01:02:35,220
Yeah.

1166
01:02:35,220 --> 01:02:36,220
Yeah.

1167
01:02:36,220 --> 01:02:37,980
So I am boosting with a thousand sats.

1168
01:02:37,980 --> 01:02:39,980
Just testing boost CLI.

1169
01:02:39,980 --> 01:02:40,980
Actual boost coming soon.

1170
01:02:40,980 --> 01:02:41,980
You know what?

1171
01:02:41,980 --> 01:02:42,980
Wow.

1172
01:02:42,980 --> 01:02:44,340
Any boost with boost CLI is an actual boost.

1173
01:02:44,340 --> 01:02:46,540
That is a baller boost in a totally different way.

1174
01:02:46,540 --> 01:02:49,540
I hoard that which your kind covet.

1175
01:02:49,540 --> 01:02:51,020
Yeah, that's it.

1176
01:02:51,020 --> 01:02:52,020
That's it.

1177
01:02:52,020 --> 01:02:55,740
Boost CLI is a whole suite of competence.

1178
01:02:55,740 --> 01:03:01,060
You get boost CLI working and you've got, you basically should get hired.

1179
01:03:01,060 --> 01:03:04,420
In my opinion, if somebody came in and said, yeah, I got boost CLI, you're hired, you got

1180
01:03:04,420 --> 01:03:05,420
a job.

1181
01:03:05,420 --> 01:03:08,720
Yeah, you should, you should easily get a job.

1182
01:03:08,720 --> 01:03:12,340
If you're having troubles getting a job, have them call me, I'll explain it to them.

1183
01:03:12,340 --> 01:03:13,340
All right.

1184
01:03:13,340 --> 01:03:17,220
So a pag dot boosted in with 3,333 sats.

1185
01:03:17,220 --> 01:03:18,220
Boost!

1186
01:03:18,220 --> 01:03:19,220
Hi you all.

1187
01:03:19,220 --> 01:03:22,540
Chris likes to recommend breeze for those who don't want to switch to a new podcast

1188
01:03:22,540 --> 01:03:23,540
app.

1189
01:03:23,540 --> 01:03:27,340
Well, I am a happy user of antenna pod and I don't want to switch.

1190
01:03:27,340 --> 01:03:31,540
My issue with breeze is that I really haven't found an easy way just to use it for plain

1191
01:03:31,540 --> 01:03:32,540
old boosting.

1192
01:03:32,540 --> 01:03:38,260
To actually send the boost, I got to go find your episode, press play, then send the boost

1193
01:03:38,260 --> 01:03:39,260
in.

1194
01:03:39,260 --> 01:03:42,260
Not to mention, he's probably already listening to the podcast and antenna pod while he's

1195
01:03:42,260 --> 01:03:43,260
doing it.

1196
01:03:43,260 --> 01:03:44,800
So there's like that whole issue.

1197
01:03:44,800 --> 01:03:51,940
Here's the trick that works for pag dot or page dot or pag, pag day pod verse allows

1198
01:03:51,940 --> 01:03:56,500
me not only to boost without playing the podcast, but I can actually do it from my PC and don't

1199
01:03:56,500 --> 01:03:58,980
have to bother with my dang phone.

1200
01:03:58,980 --> 01:04:00,380
I added the dang part.

1201
01:04:00,380 --> 01:04:01,380
That's a great tip.

1202
01:04:01,380 --> 01:04:04,320
And I've been noticing more and more folks out there are using pod verse.

1203
01:04:04,320 --> 01:04:07,980
And actually you can go to the episode webpage on our new site and just click the lightning

1204
01:04:07,980 --> 01:04:10,460
bolt on the player and it'll take you right to there.

1205
01:04:10,460 --> 01:04:12,700
So new features for the website.

1206
01:04:12,700 --> 01:04:16,720
We haven't I don't think I've covered that yet part, but that's one of the things it's

1207
01:04:16,720 --> 01:04:21,860
been in draft PR for I don't know how long and I've wanted to go tackle it.

1208
01:04:21,860 --> 01:04:26,900
I just haven't had a chance to go do it to integrate value for value on the actual website.

1209
01:04:26,900 --> 01:04:29,540
Yeah, it's really awesome.

1210
01:04:29,540 --> 01:04:31,700
We should we should talk new features here in a sec.

1211
01:04:31,700 --> 01:04:34,180
That's a that's a that's probably top on my list.

1212
01:04:34,180 --> 01:04:40,380
And then peg dot page dot I think you're about to get corrected here, Chris.

1213
01:04:40,380 --> 01:04:41,700
Just a short boost.

1214
01:04:41,700 --> 01:04:43,220
They sent three hundred and thirty three stats.

1215
01:04:43,220 --> 01:04:47,460
Just a short boost on the pronunciation of my name.

1216
01:04:47,460 --> 01:04:51,380
You're mispronouncing the G. It's pronounced like the G in dig.

1217
01:04:51,380 --> 01:04:53,580
So it's peg doc.

1218
01:04:53,580 --> 01:04:55,500
Peg dot.

1219
01:04:55,500 --> 01:04:56,500
Because dig.

1220
01:04:56,500 --> 01:04:57,500
Peg.

1221
01:04:57,500 --> 01:04:58,500
I don't know.

1222
01:04:58,500 --> 01:04:59,500
I think you got it.

1223
01:04:59,500 --> 01:05:00,500
I don't know.

1224
01:05:00,500 --> 01:05:01,500
I think you got it.

1225
01:05:01,500 --> 01:05:02,500
You think?

1226
01:05:02,500 --> 01:05:03,500
I need to know.

1227
01:05:03,500 --> 01:05:04,500
I need to know.

1228
01:05:04,500 --> 01:05:07,820
Thank you to everybody who sent a boost in or sent some stream streaming some stats.

1229
01:05:07,820 --> 01:05:09,900
We appreciate all of you.

1230
01:05:09,900 --> 01:05:10,900
Thank you very much.

1231
01:05:10,900 --> 01:05:14,700
You can grab a new podcast app at new podcast apps dot com and send a boost in or just go

1232
01:05:14,700 --> 01:05:15,820
to Podverse.

1233
01:05:15,820 --> 01:05:21,020
That's a GPL open source podcast player that's got a Web version and you can boost from there.

1234
01:05:21,020 --> 01:05:22,020
I love Albi.

1235
01:05:22,020 --> 01:05:24,060
The Albi extension makes it all possible.

1236
01:05:24,060 --> 01:05:25,060
Albi.

1237
01:05:25,060 --> 01:05:26,060
You'll learn all about it.

1238
01:05:26,060 --> 01:05:28,380
It's it's a whole new world of technology.

1239
01:05:28,380 --> 01:05:29,500
It's all decentralized.

1240
01:05:29,500 --> 01:05:31,080
It's all self-hosted.

1241
01:05:31,080 --> 01:05:33,000
No company can cut you off.

1242
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:34,380
It's a beautiful thing.

1243
01:05:34,380 --> 01:05:38,180
And it incentivizes creators to respond directly to their audience.

1244
01:05:38,180 --> 01:05:43,100
And on our side, when those boosts come in, it's a smile on our face every single time.

1245
01:05:43,100 --> 01:05:46,380
So thank you everybody who goes to new podcast apps, grabs one and sends a boost into the

1246
01:05:46,380 --> 01:05:47,380
show.

1247
01:05:47,380 --> 01:05:54,520
We got 250 stats too from Tepalus who enjoyed the behind the scenes troubleshooting information

1248
01:05:54,520 --> 01:05:55,600
we talked about last week.

1249
01:05:55,600 --> 01:05:56,780
That's kind of our idea here.

1250
01:05:56,780 --> 01:06:00,980
Office Hours is really a podcast for J.B. community members.

1251
01:06:00,980 --> 01:06:02,860
We're not really trying to reach anybody else.

1252
01:06:02,860 --> 01:06:05,980
It's great if they want to listen, probably half the stuff probably doesn't make sense

1253
01:06:05,980 --> 01:06:06,980
if they do.

1254
01:06:06,980 --> 01:06:07,980
Yeah.

1255
01:06:07,980 --> 01:06:11,540
So before we get out of here, let's talk about like, you know, some new stuff that you'd

1256
01:06:11,540 --> 01:06:12,540
like to see.

1257
01:06:12,540 --> 01:06:13,540
Alex and Brent.

1258
01:06:13,540 --> 01:06:16,440
I mean, we talked about value for value in the browser.

1259
01:06:16,440 --> 01:06:21,140
That sounds tricky just because, like, how do you I guess you need a way to select which

1260
01:06:21,140 --> 01:06:22,140
show you're boosting.

1261
01:06:22,140 --> 01:06:27,340
Like, I'm picturing the UI on that because booster based are tied to a particular episode.

1262
01:06:27,340 --> 01:06:33,060
So you need like a message box, an episode selector, something like that.

1263
01:06:33,060 --> 01:06:36,780
And maybe then it would read the value tag from the feed for that episode.

1264
01:06:36,780 --> 01:06:40,940
So I haven't looked into all the specifics yet, but I figured we would try and take kind

1265
01:06:40,940 --> 01:06:45,480
of a similar approach to how Podverse actually implements it in their website.

1266
01:06:45,480 --> 01:06:48,240
So just kind of have a form on the side.

1267
01:06:48,240 --> 01:06:50,140
And again, I mentioned I'm not the aesthetic one.

1268
01:06:50,140 --> 01:06:53,040
So I'm only thinking of functionality.

1269
01:06:53,040 --> 01:06:54,040
Team effort.

1270
01:06:54,040 --> 01:06:55,040
Exactly.

1271
01:06:55,040 --> 01:06:59,940
So if you had like a form on the side that would just automatically for that episode

1272
01:06:59,940 --> 01:07:05,060
that you're on, choose all the necessary information and submit it the exact same way.

1273
01:07:05,060 --> 01:07:07,460
So that was what I was mentally thinking.

1274
01:07:07,460 --> 01:07:10,820
But again, I haven't super dug into a lot of this stuff.

1275
01:07:10,820 --> 01:07:13,020
So I suppose, yeah, that makes sense.

1276
01:07:13,020 --> 01:07:15,740
And you could even just infer it based on the episode you're watching.

1277
01:07:15,740 --> 01:07:20,700
I picture something like Jupiter broadcasting dot com slash boost.

1278
01:07:20,700 --> 01:07:22,140
And so it's just one spot you go to.

1279
01:07:22,140 --> 01:07:25,020
So you don't have to, like, go to the individual episode page if you don't want you could just

1280
01:07:25,020 --> 01:07:26,020
go to the boost page.

1281
01:07:26,020 --> 01:07:29,460
OK, well, how about keep that idea?

1282
01:07:29,460 --> 01:07:34,700
And on every episode page and also show page, you just have a giant boost button.

1283
01:07:34,700 --> 01:07:38,840
And when you click it, it pre fills out the form, you know, takes you there and pre fills

1284
01:07:38,840 --> 01:07:39,840
out the form.

1285
01:07:39,840 --> 01:07:40,840
I don't know how to do that.

1286
01:07:40,840 --> 01:07:41,840
That's someone else's job.

1287
01:07:41,840 --> 01:07:45,060
But the button should probably be like twelve eighty by seven twenty inside.

1288
01:07:45,060 --> 01:07:46,700
I mean, just and it flashes red.

1289
01:07:46,700 --> 01:07:47,700
Right.

1290
01:07:47,700 --> 01:07:48,700
Yeah.

1291
01:07:48,700 --> 01:07:49,700
Real big button.

1292
01:07:49,700 --> 01:07:50,700
Yeah.

1293
01:07:50,700 --> 01:07:54,660
Maybe like just have the button marquee or you've probably seen that website where you

1294
01:07:54,660 --> 01:07:56,620
go to click the button and it moves.

1295
01:07:56,620 --> 01:08:00,580
We could do that just like a couple of times to really make them want it, you know, make

1296
01:08:00,580 --> 01:08:08,100
sure I recently saw a movie that the A.I. from the phone.

1297
01:08:08,100 --> 01:08:11,800
I can't remember what it's called, but the A.I. from the phone.

1298
01:08:11,800 --> 01:08:15,920
He was trying to power off the phone and the button moved every time he went to go touch

1299
01:08:15,920 --> 01:08:18,060
the actual power off button.

1300
01:08:18,060 --> 01:08:19,060
It was hilarious.

1301
01:08:19,060 --> 01:08:20,060
There you go.

1302
01:08:20,060 --> 01:08:21,060
It's the way the future.

1303
01:08:21,060 --> 01:08:23,340
Basically, that's what we have now is slow phones.

1304
01:08:23,340 --> 01:08:25,860
You know, when the U.I. changes, Chris, I know that's one of your pet peeves.

1305
01:08:25,860 --> 01:08:26,860
I hate that.

1306
01:08:26,860 --> 01:08:28,060
I hate that.

1307
01:08:28,060 --> 01:08:31,260
Or websites where the JavaScript finished on the button, it moves right as you're going

1308
01:08:31,260 --> 01:08:34,300
to click and you click on something else and you got to go back and it does it again.

1309
01:08:34,300 --> 01:08:37,540
And oh, next has been doing that to me recently.

1310
01:08:37,540 --> 01:08:38,540
Now they think about it.

1311
01:08:38,540 --> 01:08:40,660
I hate that so freaking much.

1312
01:08:40,660 --> 01:08:41,660
All right.

1313
01:08:41,660 --> 01:08:44,340
Alex and Brett, is there anything else we want to talk about while we are gathered together

1314
01:08:44,340 --> 01:08:45,340
in the office?

1315
01:08:45,340 --> 01:08:48,220
Well, I wanted to ask you what feature you're looking forward to the most, but I think I

1316
01:08:48,220 --> 01:08:49,220
know the answer.

1317
01:08:49,220 --> 01:08:50,220
Yeah.

1318
01:08:50,220 --> 01:08:51,220
The value stuff.

1319
01:08:51,220 --> 01:08:52,860
I think one day definitely the boost stuff.

1320
01:08:52,860 --> 01:08:53,980
That would be great.

1321
01:08:53,980 --> 01:08:58,680
I think it would also be really cool to just revisit the idea of a live tracker on our

1322
01:08:58,680 --> 01:09:00,420
website for like a future trip.

1323
01:09:00,420 --> 01:09:06,540
Like if we go to do a venue and we drive there, why not have the live tracker going?

1324
01:09:06,540 --> 01:09:08,140
You know, so that kind of stuff.

1325
01:09:08,140 --> 01:09:10,740
I could see a live tracker page and we would just have to.

1326
01:09:10,740 --> 01:09:15,080
I think we have a lot of the plumbing on the back end for own tracks and everything still

1327
01:09:15,080 --> 01:09:16,080
in place.

1328
01:09:16,080 --> 01:09:18,300
We just don't have it publishing anywhere.

1329
01:09:18,300 --> 01:09:19,300
I'm not positive.

1330
01:09:19,300 --> 01:09:20,300
Nothing's precious.

1331
01:09:20,300 --> 01:09:21,300
We could always redo it, too.

1332
01:09:21,300 --> 01:09:26,580
But that could be fun for something that maybe for when we're doing events like a meetup

1333
01:09:26,580 --> 01:09:31,340
or a road trip, like an event page that people could go to to get information about the meetups

1334
01:09:31,340 --> 01:09:34,420
or get information about the road trip that we're on and see the route.

1335
01:09:34,420 --> 01:09:35,660
Something like that could be.

1336
01:09:35,660 --> 01:09:38,780
So it's not just whatever gets mentioned in the show.

1337
01:09:38,780 --> 01:09:40,940
There's actually something physical to go look at.

1338
01:09:40,940 --> 01:09:43,740
But there's nothing like I have firm around that and there's no timelines.

1339
01:09:43,740 --> 01:09:46,860
But OK, another example could be Linux Fest Northwest.

1340
01:09:46,860 --> 01:09:51,220
If that comes back and we go, it'd be cool to have a dedicated Linux Fest Northwest page

1341
01:09:51,220 --> 01:09:55,540
to find out information where we're going to be at, maybe have the live stream embedded

1342
01:09:55,540 --> 01:09:56,540
there.

1343
01:09:56,540 --> 01:09:57,540
Something.

1344
01:09:57,540 --> 01:10:00,580
Well, that would kind of integrate into what you were talking about for having the community

1345
01:10:00,580 --> 01:10:05,380
build kind of like a system to help organize those things.

1346
01:10:05,380 --> 01:10:06,380
Right.

1347
01:10:06,380 --> 01:10:08,340
Well, like a meetup dot com alternative.

1348
01:10:08,340 --> 01:10:09,340
Yeah.

1349
01:10:09,340 --> 01:10:10,340
Yeah.

1350
01:10:10,340 --> 01:10:11,340
Yeah.

1351
01:10:11,340 --> 01:10:12,340
Oh, yeah.

1352
01:10:12,340 --> 01:10:13,340
Yeah.

1353
01:10:13,340 --> 01:10:14,340
That's a big one.

1354
01:10:14,340 --> 01:10:15,340
Letting the community self organize their own meetups.

1355
01:10:15,340 --> 01:10:18,100
Every single meetup we go to.

1356
01:10:18,100 --> 01:10:19,100
It's true.

1357
01:10:19,100 --> 01:10:22,020
People always say we should keep doing this, even if the JB guys can't make it.

1358
01:10:22,020 --> 01:10:23,020
We should keep doing this.

1359
01:10:23,020 --> 01:10:24,020
You guys want to keep doing this?

1360
01:10:24,020 --> 01:10:25,020
Oh, yeah.

1361
01:10:25,020 --> 01:10:26,020
I want to keep doing this.

1362
01:10:26,020 --> 01:10:27,020
I want to keep doing this.

1363
01:10:27,020 --> 01:10:29,780
But the issue is, is they all go their separate ways and it just doesn't really happen.

1364
01:10:29,780 --> 01:10:32,740
But if we had something there and every time we heard them, we could say, all right, go

1365
01:10:32,740 --> 01:10:33,740
here, organize it.

1366
01:10:33,740 --> 01:10:35,180
We'll help you get it set up.

1367
01:10:35,180 --> 01:10:39,020
I think people would keep going that they when they go to the meetups are like, shit,

1368
01:10:39,020 --> 01:10:40,020
this is so great.

1369
01:10:40,020 --> 01:10:41,380
I want to do this all the time.

1370
01:10:41,380 --> 01:10:43,120
Let's do this every week, guys.

1371
01:10:43,120 --> 01:10:46,460
But then you get back to your life, you get busy, you don't have that connection.

1372
01:10:46,460 --> 01:10:49,780
You go back to the two dimensional Internet stuff and you forget about it.

1373
01:10:49,780 --> 01:10:53,100
And if we could just jump on it and if we could if we could tell people, go here, get

1374
01:10:53,100 --> 01:10:54,100
it organized.

1375
01:10:54,100 --> 01:10:57,300
And then for our own stuff, we had a tool to use as well, because like Alex is going

1376
01:10:57,300 --> 01:11:00,520
to be at all things open.

1377
01:11:00,520 --> 01:11:03,140
We kind of debate, like, is that worth using the meetup page?

1378
01:11:03,140 --> 01:11:04,140
Is it not?

1379
01:11:04,140 --> 01:11:06,940
But if we just had a spot that was ours for this stuff, it seems it feels like it'd be

1380
01:11:06,940 --> 01:11:07,940
a no brainer.

1381
01:11:07,940 --> 01:11:09,180
We would just put everything on there.

1382
01:11:09,180 --> 01:11:10,660
Yeah, I agree completely.

1383
01:11:10,660 --> 01:11:11,820
So yeah, that's high on my list, too.

1384
01:11:11,820 --> 01:11:14,820
I have a feature that I'd like to see.

1385
01:11:14,820 --> 01:11:20,380
And it was one we meant to do and just kind of couldn't, and that is to integrate the

1386
01:11:20,380 --> 01:11:23,420
archive back into the website.

1387
01:11:23,420 --> 01:11:28,940
That stuff's been missing because we made some hard decisions to say, well, let's put

1388
01:11:28,940 --> 01:11:35,900
the site live with the current shows, because the archive, it turned out, was a bigger project

1389
01:11:35,900 --> 01:11:38,900
than we had anticipated.

1390
01:11:38,900 --> 01:11:39,900
And sounds about right.

1391
01:11:39,900 --> 01:11:46,580
You know, Stefan did a lot of work, mostly, I think, in archiving some of that stuff,

1392
01:11:46,580 --> 01:11:51,260
but also in just thinking about how to integrate it, because it actually turns out not that

1393
01:11:51,260 --> 01:11:52,940
straightforward.

1394
01:11:52,940 --> 01:11:56,580
And then got busy, which is completely okay, Stefan, we still love you.

1395
01:11:56,580 --> 01:12:00,060
But I think now's the time to do a little bit of work there.

1396
01:12:00,060 --> 01:12:05,020
It would be great to have some of those archive shows be available for audience members to

1397
01:12:05,020 --> 01:12:06,020
rediscover.

1398
01:12:06,020 --> 01:12:10,020
I know for us, sometimes it's fun to dig back into some of those really old Linux action

1399
01:12:10,020 --> 01:12:15,460
show episodes, or even the Linux Unplugged episodes, just to see how silly we sounded.

1400
01:12:15,460 --> 01:12:16,460
Me, me.

1401
01:12:16,460 --> 01:12:17,460
How silly I sounded.

1402
01:12:17,460 --> 01:12:21,340
Yeah, you sound like a young little kid with his voice turned up high.

1403
01:12:21,340 --> 01:12:22,340
That's true.

1404
01:12:22,340 --> 01:12:24,660
Who wouldn't want to download that?

1405
01:12:24,660 --> 01:12:27,620
Yeah, we better get that posted super fast.

1406
01:12:27,620 --> 01:12:28,620
No, I agree.

1407
01:12:28,620 --> 01:12:29,980
It would be good to have.

1408
01:12:29,980 --> 01:12:34,060
I've thought, too, it would be nice to have a way to expose chapter title information,

1409
01:12:34,060 --> 01:12:35,060
too, potentially.

1410
01:12:35,060 --> 01:12:36,060
I don't know.

1411
01:12:36,060 --> 01:12:37,060
I'm still on the fence on that.

1412
01:12:37,060 --> 01:12:39,620
Because it isn't the Podverse player, you know, you have you have the chapters.

1413
01:12:39,620 --> 01:12:41,700
Drew works super hard on those amazing titles.

1414
01:12:41,700 --> 01:12:42,700
So I know.

1415
01:12:42,700 --> 01:12:43,700
Yeah.

1416
01:12:43,700 --> 01:12:45,580
But we're really in a good spot with it.

1417
01:12:45,580 --> 01:12:46,840
I think we're in a really good space.

1418
01:12:46,840 --> 01:12:48,020
So super grateful.

1419
01:12:48,020 --> 01:12:52,220
This is one of my, you know, absolute favorite experiences with an open source project for

1420
01:12:52,220 --> 01:12:53,220
obvious reasons.

1421
01:12:53,220 --> 01:12:55,020
But it really just has been.

1422
01:12:55,020 --> 01:12:56,380
The community has been great.

1423
01:12:56,380 --> 01:13:00,180
I think I'm wondering if if there isn't something Alex, maybe this is a good way to wrap up

1424
01:13:00,180 --> 01:13:03,900
maybe a final question to you is do you feel like building an open source project around

1425
01:13:03,900 --> 01:13:06,940
something it has sort of been the key to making this work?

1426
01:13:06,940 --> 01:13:09,980
I'm curious to know your thoughts there, because some open source projects start and they kind

1427
01:13:09,980 --> 01:13:15,460
of go nowhere and other ones, they they kind of get momentum and steam and life to them.

1428
01:13:15,460 --> 01:13:18,900
And I'm I'm wondering what you think the differentiator is there.

1429
01:13:18,900 --> 01:13:25,820
Yeah, I definitely think, one, it's people dedicated to actually wanting to do some type

1430
01:13:25,820 --> 01:13:27,480
of value for value exchange.

1431
01:13:27,480 --> 01:13:33,820
So having not necessarily even the direction of, oh, hey, we need a new website, but just

1432
01:13:33,820 --> 01:13:39,500
helping out JB in general is something that I think has continued to give people more

1433
01:13:39,500 --> 01:13:45,460
incentive to come back and contribute and to actually see their changes get deployed

1434
01:13:45,460 --> 01:13:49,260
and seeing fast responses from the website and stuff.

1435
01:13:49,260 --> 01:13:55,020
It's it gives them a kind of a sense of accomplishment as they're continuing to contribute as well,

1436
01:13:55,020 --> 01:13:58,140
which also then makes them want to contribute again.

1437
01:13:58,140 --> 01:14:05,260
So I think specifically, whenever this whole journey started, saying that it was dedicated

1438
01:14:05,260 --> 01:14:10,700
for the website specifically, allowed people to have something to centralize.

1439
01:14:10,700 --> 01:14:16,560
So I do think having that kind of driving factor, not only, hey, it's a JB project,

1440
01:14:16,560 --> 01:14:21,940
but it's also, hey, we need a new website, and we kind of need it urgently because we're

1441
01:14:21,940 --> 01:14:25,240
going to be losing our hosting provider.

1442
01:14:25,240 --> 01:14:30,860
So calling out to the community and being like, hey, we need help and allowing people

1443
01:14:30,860 --> 01:14:37,700
to actually help has really allowed people to feel involved in being a part of the actual

1444
01:14:37,700 --> 01:14:38,700
team.

1445
01:14:38,700 --> 01:14:39,700
Yeah.

1446
01:14:39,700 --> 01:14:43,180
And I can also see there's something nice about you contribute something, you actually

1447
01:14:43,180 --> 01:14:44,320
get to see the difference.

1448
01:14:44,320 --> 01:14:48,380
You know, a lot of a lot of things all of us probably experience and work on is there's

1449
01:14:48,380 --> 01:14:51,500
a lot of things we'll tool away at in our day job or in our regular life and you work

1450
01:14:51,500 --> 01:14:52,860
at it and you work at it and you work at it.

1451
01:14:52,860 --> 01:14:56,260
You don't necessarily see the fruit of that labor.

1452
01:14:56,260 --> 01:15:02,280
You don't necessarily see the return and the payoff and the completion aspect of it.

1453
01:15:02,280 --> 01:15:05,680
And when it's a project like this and we're moving pretty quick and we're integrating

1454
01:15:05,680 --> 01:15:09,700
those changes and we're deploying them on a pretty regular basis, you could put some

1455
01:15:09,700 --> 01:15:10,700
work into it.

1456
01:15:10,700 --> 01:15:14,060
And a couple of weeks later, you know, thousands of people are using something you just worked

1457
01:15:14,060 --> 01:15:15,060
on.

1458
01:15:15,060 --> 01:15:17,680
And I think there's something to that, too, that can be kind of satisfying.

1459
01:15:17,680 --> 01:15:20,980
I hope people find it satisfying because we are super grateful.

1460
01:15:20,980 --> 01:15:27,660
And kind of speaking to the thousands of people using it, the stats or the plausible instance

1461
01:15:27,660 --> 01:15:29,580
that Alex deployed is still out there.

1462
01:15:29,580 --> 01:15:34,060
So periodically I check that and I'm like, wow, thousands of people are actually using

1463
01:15:34,060 --> 01:15:35,060
it.

1464
01:15:35,060 --> 01:15:36,980
You can actually see the statistics being shown.

1465
01:15:36,980 --> 01:15:39,640
You mean it's not just the three of us?

1466
01:15:39,640 --> 01:15:41,020
And I hope it continues to grow.

1467
01:15:41,020 --> 01:15:42,020
Right.

1468
01:15:42,020 --> 01:15:46,260
Because we've had many, many years of sending people to all of the other websites, the show

1469
01:15:46,260 --> 01:15:52,940
specific websites, YouTube, Twitch, and now we're kind of saying, come back home.

1470
01:15:52,940 --> 01:15:55,300
You know, we've rebuilt the storefront.

1471
01:15:55,300 --> 01:15:56,780
Come on home again.

1472
01:15:56,780 --> 01:16:00,980
And it's going to take a little while to re-habituate people because they, you know, a lot of people

1473
01:16:00,980 --> 01:16:02,380
just listen on their podcast app.

1474
01:16:02,380 --> 01:16:05,660
If they're going to go to the website at all, they just bring up the notes and click a link.

1475
01:16:05,660 --> 01:16:07,000
They don't even have to go to a website.

1476
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:08,920
But if they do, they go to the show page.

1477
01:16:08,920 --> 01:16:12,100
And I think over time that'll start to change.

1478
01:16:12,100 --> 01:16:16,820
As we begin to move away from Fireside too, we'll probably redirect the individual show

1479
01:16:16,820 --> 01:16:20,300
sites like a Linux Unplugged or OfficeHours.hair.

1480
01:16:20,300 --> 01:16:24,940
We'll probably redirect that to the sub show page on the JB website once things are ready

1481
01:16:24,940 --> 01:16:27,440
and it's time for Fireside to go.

1482
01:16:27,440 --> 01:16:30,860
So then that will also see in theory a little bit of an increase in traffic when we do that

1483
01:16:30,860 --> 01:16:31,860
as well.

1484
01:16:31,860 --> 01:16:34,820
So it's all coming and I'm glad we have something built for them when they get here.

1485
01:16:34,820 --> 01:16:41,100
You know, I'd say I think one of my favorite things about this project has been that it

1486
01:16:41,100 --> 01:16:45,500
has given me a new way to hang out with our audience.

1487
01:16:45,500 --> 01:16:48,740
And we're building something together, which is really fun, too.

1488
01:16:48,740 --> 01:16:53,660
It's not, you know, Chris, we get the feeling often that it's, you know, sometimes we publish

1489
01:16:53,660 --> 01:16:57,760
an episode and you don't always get that feedback that there's someone else out there.

1490
01:16:57,760 --> 01:17:00,180
Or if you do, it's like Twitter or YouTube comments.

1491
01:17:00,180 --> 01:17:01,260
That's what I was saying earlier.

1492
01:17:01,260 --> 01:17:06,580
It's like as a content creator, you get this really weird echo chamber source of your most

1493
01:17:06,580 --> 01:17:07,580
feedback.

1494
01:17:07,580 --> 01:17:12,260
But the fun part is with this website project, at least for me personally, it's felt like

1495
01:17:12,260 --> 01:17:18,580
most of the energy has been in a like a two way exchange is conversations happening.

1496
01:17:18,580 --> 01:17:20,400
And we're building this thing together.

1497
01:17:20,400 --> 01:17:23,980
And there's a bunch of people like huddled around talking about how to best accomplish

1498
01:17:23,980 --> 01:17:26,900
a certain feature or solve some bug or something.

1499
01:17:26,900 --> 01:17:30,700
And it's like, I'm just getting to know our audience members in a totally different way.

1500
01:17:30,700 --> 01:17:32,260
And I love that stuff.

1501
01:17:32,260 --> 01:17:39,580
And up until we actually had issues with a deployment one time, I hadn't actually seen

1502
01:17:39,580 --> 01:17:42,500
Alex on a video from Self Hosted.

1503
01:17:42,500 --> 01:17:44,060
I hadn't actually seen him before.

1504
01:17:44,060 --> 01:17:46,780
And we hopped on a video call to kind of troubleshoot it out.

1505
01:17:46,780 --> 01:17:50,580
And that was my first time ever actually seeing Alex.

1506
01:17:50,580 --> 01:17:54,620
I've heard his voice for years, but that was the first time I had seen it.

1507
01:17:54,620 --> 01:17:58,200
Yeah, that's always an experience.

1508
01:17:58,200 --> 01:18:02,340
So it's been really cool from my perspective as well, getting actually to I mean, it's

1509
01:18:02,340 --> 01:18:05,700
the whole reason why I ended up getting brought on this specific podcast episode.

1510
01:18:05,700 --> 01:18:07,200
So it's been really cool.

1511
01:18:07,200 --> 01:18:09,660
It's more of that meetup kind of energy.

1512
01:18:09,660 --> 01:18:14,460
You know, it's that it's that kind of vibe, that meetup vibe a little bit, but, you know,

1513
01:18:14,460 --> 01:18:15,460
in a different context.

1514
01:18:15,460 --> 01:18:17,780
All right, gentlemen, we should wrap it up there.

1515
01:18:17,780 --> 01:18:20,300
But thank you for the work today specifically.

1516
01:18:20,300 --> 01:18:24,380
But thank you for all of the work and everybody out there contributing and anybody considering

1517
01:18:24,380 --> 01:18:29,340
you can find the Jupiter Broadcasting dot com repo on our GitHub.

1518
01:18:29,340 --> 01:18:31,300
We'll put a link to that stuff in the show notes as well.

1519
01:18:31,300 --> 01:18:35,540
So you have all of that over at office hours dot hair slash 15.

1520
01:18:35,540 --> 01:18:36,540
Heck yeah.

1521
01:18:36,540 --> 01:18:40,380
I have a feeling that they mean I love it, but it's not it's not going to be around forever

1522
01:18:40,380 --> 01:18:41,380
with the name change.

1523
01:18:41,380 --> 01:18:42,380
It might have to change.

1524
01:18:42,380 --> 01:18:43,380
I don't know.

1525
01:18:43,380 --> 01:18:44,380
Maybe we should keep it.

1526
01:18:44,380 --> 01:18:48,380
You know, just the domain like so the long timers feel a little Easter egg.

1527
01:18:48,380 --> 01:18:49,380
Yep.

1528
01:18:49,380 --> 01:18:50,380
Love it.

1529
01:18:50,380 --> 01:18:51,380
Yeah.

1530
01:18:51,380 --> 01:18:52,380
The old schoolers.

1531
01:18:52,380 --> 01:18:53,380
Yeah, they'll know.

1532
01:18:53,380 --> 01:18:54,380
All right, everybody.

1533
01:18:54,380 --> 01:18:55,380
Thank you very much for joining us.

1534
01:18:55,380 --> 01:18:58,940
That does mean office hours are closed, so you got to get out of here.

1535
01:18:58,940 --> 01:19:01,900
I only got so much room and honestly, I don't like leaving my pants on.

1536
01:19:01,900 --> 01:19:02,900
So you got to go.

1537
01:19:02,900 --> 01:19:03,900
You got to go.

1538
01:19:03,900 --> 01:19:23,740
Thanks for being here.
