1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,800
PeerTube is one of my favorite new tools right now, I think.

2
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:08,400
The minimum viable PeerTube implementation that I didn't necessarily come up with at launch,

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:13,920
but now weeks into it, it's been great. It's just an archive of our live shows,

4
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:18,160
and it's just a great way to watch the shows live when we're doing them.

5
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:22,080
And now with the new website and the integration with the embedded player on the new website,

6
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:27,760
so it can just ping the PeerTube API and get the latest live stream and then auto embed that on

7
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:34,640
the webpage, it's now getting integrated and automated. It's so great. And it's all laying

8
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:41,120
the plumbing so that way when we're generating our own RSS feeds, we can do live streaming in

9
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:46,400
the podcasting 2.0 app. So you can just listen to our live shows in your regular podcasting app.

10
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:50,400
That's also going to be powered by PeerTube. There's a real net effect, I think, of going

11
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:55,360
with PeerTube again. I debated it because we did it once. I had issues with it. I don't think it

12
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:58,560
was the right take, and then we shut it down, and then we relaunched, and we kind of did this

13
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:04,080
minimum viable PeerTube, and it's been so much better. It's been a great tool. Very happy with

14
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:08,000
it. So if you haven't checked out JupiterTube, you got to go over there, Jupiter.Tube. You can

15
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:14,800
get archived versions of this live stream and all the other live shows. It's Office Hours with me,

16
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:22,800
Chris. Well, hello, everybody. Welcome into the office. Come on, Brent. Sit down. It's showtime.

17
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:25,520
Hello there. How are you doing? Hey, do you still have my butt groove here?

18
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:31,520
Yeah. Yeah, I keep that just right. I got a little model of your...never mind. You don't want to know

19
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:37,600
how I do that. We'll just move on. I just want you to feel at home, you know? It's a safe space

20
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:42,880
here in the office. We have so much going on behind the scenes this week that we could make

21
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:46,480
the week of shows just about the work we've been doing, but we're going to kind of condense some

22
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:51,680
of it down right here into Office Hours this week. Brent, would you say it's fair to say

23
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:56,320
it's the final countdown? I think we're slightly past our optimistic final countdown, but yeah,

24
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:02,880
it certainly is. The actual dead deadline is really coming up. It's getting me a little nervous.

25
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:09,040
Now, you've been at Alex's house for, I think, about seven years, right? You've been there now?

26
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:13,920
Yeah. Yeah, six or seven. Yeah. And the opportunity came up for you two to work

27
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:19,360
together on some infrastructure, and we saw a whole new, I think, push of work getting done.

28
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:23,920
And so we wanted to update everybody because there's been so many developments since our

29
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:29,200
last episode that we just had to kind of stop and kind of do a sync up. And so we had a chance to

30
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:35,360
sit down with Alex and Wes after Linux unplugged last week, and I wanted to play a little bit of

31
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:39,040
our chat with you just to give you an update on where we're at in some of the infrastructure

32
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:52,080
decisions that we've made for the new Jupiter Broadcasting website.

33
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:05,120
We sent out an invite saying, let's build a website, and they came to our party. It is going

34
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:09,920
incredible. It's a really special day because Wes Payne's here. It's been a bit. Hello, Wes.

35
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:12,720
Hello. Good to have you in the office.

36
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,880
It's nice to be here. Sorry we didn't have a seat for you.

37
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:18,640
But hey, I'm happy just to sit right on top of Brent.

38
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:21,840
I don't know why he has to collect all those seats. I think it's totally fair. I think it's

39
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:25,840
fair. And Brent, I hope you brought the candy because Alex is here and we did promise candy.

40
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:30,400
Hello, Alex. Welcome back to the office. If you've been on the office before,

41
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,800
I think you have once, maybe. But it's good to have you here.

42
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:36,960
I definitely interrupted an episode with the no touchy the chair sticker a while back.

43
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:41,120
That is very true. He also interrupted one by turning the internet off.

44
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,720
Oh, that's also true. Yes.

45
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,200
Okay, good. So your presence has been felt.

46
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,000
Definitely.

47
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Right. Good. Well, actually, this week, we've got a lot to talk about because I've gotten the sense

48
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,160
that there has been a lot of work to get the new Jupiter Broadcasting website

49
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:00,560
ready to go from an infrastructure standpoint. I know we have a new domain,

50
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:05,920
we have some changes, and it sounds like we're getting a lot closer to actually having this

51
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:09,120
thing finished. So what are we going to talk about, Brent? What's the latest?

52
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,040
Well, a heck of a lot of stuff has been happening on the website this week, so much that I it seems

53
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:19,360
I can't ever get caught up on all of the sort of action that's happening there, which is a really

54
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:22,240
good problem to have. I'm not complaining at all. Totally.

55
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,840
We're going to need another Brent.

56
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:28,080
The team that we've amassed has been really impressive in the work they've been doing.

57
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:31,120
And the discussions that have been happening have been super fascinating to watch. Chris,

58
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,680
I know you got involved in one or two of them this week as well,

59
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,760
and you got some features that were really cool.

60
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:40,800
You know, every now and then I've needed to jump in. But for the most part, I feel like it's rare

61
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:47,440
where something hits like a roadblock that needs me to make a decision. But one area I was providing

62
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:54,160
some feedback just recently was how we are doing the live embed on the new website. When you go to

63
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:59,440
new.jupiterbroadcasting.com, you'll see there's a live link. When you go there, we now have a

64
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:05,440
dynamically inserted PeerTube live stream. So on the back end, using the PeerTube API,

65
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:10,080
when the new whatever we're streaming, maybe it's Coder, maybe it's office hours,

66
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:13,280
maybe it's Linux unplugged, maybe it's self-hosted, whatever we're streaming,

67
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,160
the API actually read. You can get that. You can query that information. It makes all of

68
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:24,080
it available. So when a new stream goes live, the API registers that. And then on the back end, I

69
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:28,560
don't even know really how they're doing this. Maybe you can tell me. We're getting on the back

70
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:33,760
end, basically the latest PeerTube live stream auto embedded now on the new website. We don't

71
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:37,600
have to do anything. Tell us how it's happening, Wes. Yeah, I mean, there's a little bit of

72
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:42,560
JavaScript right here in the page that's going to go reach out to the PeerTube API, figure out the

73
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:46,720
latest live stream that's happening, and then dynamically pull the embed code and toss that

74
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:51,920
into your page. Oh, so it does it on load. Oh, so whatever the live stream is at that moment

75
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:58,000
will automatically get embedded. Also, just major props to Arwen Thorne. I probably messed that name

76
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:03,920
up, but just an awesome example. Not only did they make this functionality work in really quick time,

77
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:08,560
but also added some helpful sort of just improve the general doc system. The code itself is really

78
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:14,320
well documented. And it's just a nice case where they're not otherwise super active on GitHub,

79
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:19,760
but just showed up to help us out. Well, and there were a few complicated ways to solve this

80
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:23,280
problem thrown around where we were trying to come up with ways where we would maybe add a

81
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:28,240
feature to a chat bot that would then auto embedded on thing and then kick off a build. And

82
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:32,640
like we were kind of coming up with like rather complicated solutions. And this is a rather

83
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:37,280
elegant way to pull this off. Nice, simple, easy. Yeah, I like that a lot. And it means we don't

84
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:42,640
have to go edit the page every time we go live. One last thing we can mess up, right? That's so

85
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:49,680
cool. You know, Arwen actually created a GitHub account specifically to commit that idea to our

86
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:56,160
repo, which was really great. And then unfortunately ran into getting flagged as spam because of the

87
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:02,080
way they have their email set up and vanished along with the changes that they submitted. So

88
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:05,840
it was a day or so that we were trying to get them back. And they figured it out. They fixed

89
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:09,680
their email, I think. And we got all those changes back. And we're like, oh, no, that code was so

90
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:16,320
great. It's gone forever now. But yeah, it came back. Thank you. And is now part of the production.

91
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:20,400
Lovely. Thank you for actually pushing through all those trials and tribulations to actually

92
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:24,720
get it across the finish line, too. Yeah, we appreciate it. Yeah, it's been great to see

93
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:31,840
a lot of new people who have maybe worked on a lot of projects solo, but haven't really worked

94
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:36,960
in an open source community kind of project. And so there's been some really neat mentoring

95
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:43,920
happening as well, which I think has been another one of those features that we didn't really expect

96
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:48,080
to happen. And has been really great to watch. And everybody's been super, super nice and

97
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:52,160
handholding too much. I'll tell you what I found actually really interesting this week,

98
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:58,880
as I started to get involved in the project is, is my it's my first time dealing with an open source

99
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:04,480
project where almost all the discussion happens almost exclusively on GitHub.

100
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:08,960
Like when I was involved with Linux server back in the day, we did all the chat in IRC or

101
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:13,840
Discord. And we had private team channels where we, you know, took all the decisions and stuff

102
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:19,280
like that. But the thing that I've really started to appreciate is just how difficult it is to

103
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:26,480
communicate all of your thoughts in such a low bandwidth conversation, without either sounding a

104
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:30,880
little bit rude and dismissive of, well, we shouldn't do it that way because of X, like,

105
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:36,160
unless you phrase things carefully, it can sound like you're being a little bit up yourself. But

106
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:42,720
I've been really impressed with the, I guess, the level of discourse that's been happening in all

107
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:48,000
of the issues that I've certainly been involved when involved with. There is some discussion

108
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,800
happens in the matrix room, but not not a lot. I wouldn't say the majority happens there. It

109
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:57,600
pretty much all happens on GitHub, which is, I think very, very interesting. Yeah,

110
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:01,680
we've been actively trying to encourage it to happen on GitHub for, I think, two reasons,

111
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:06,240
one that I've made public and the other one that I've kind of kept to myself. But you're it worked

112
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:12,880
on you, Alex. The first reason is, then we can all work sort of asynchronously, because it seems

113
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:19,360
like almost half the people that are committing ideas and pull requests aren't from anywhere near

114
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:25,440
the North American time zones. And so there's work happening at night. And so if you haven't been in

115
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:31,120
the matrix chat all day, whichever time zone you're in, you're not missing stuff. And so you're if

116
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:35,760
you're working on a specific issue, then everything's there. The other reason is, it forces

117
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:42,960
you to write your ideas in a really concise and clear way. And it forces you to also make them

118
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:47,600
very clear for others. And I think sometimes if you're doing real time chat, that's not always the

119
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:51,600
case, you can't sort of sit for 10 minutes, even I've done this on certain issues, sit for 10

120
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:57,840
minutes and really think about how do I communicate this very clearly so that there's no question

121
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:04,400
about what my ideas and even go in and edit it an hour later, when you're like, Oh, I forgot to

122
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:08,240
mention this other thing. Thank goodness for that edit button, because stuff doesn't care to be an

123
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:13,920
hour later all the time. Yeah. So I think that's actually another feature of using the of tracking

124
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:19,440
all of those conversations, hopefully quite concisely, but really with some quality and in

125
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:23,280
the GitHub issues. And so I just implore anybody that's listening to this, I don't know who's

126
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:28,480
who's listening, but if you are Hello, if you are on the fence about contributing to an open source

127
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:34,800
project, this is the perfect one to get started. Because there are so many people who this is their

128
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:41,200
first one. And you will be in good company. Yeah. And that also doesn't mean that the quality of

129
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:48,000
work has been low. No, not at all. Very, very, very impressed with people who've been new to the

130
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:54,400
this kind of GitHub workflow, even who've had extremely high quality of contributions. That's

131
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:58,400
been super impressive to me. I feel like it's a treat to just watch all the activity happen.

132
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:05,680
I totally agree with that. And I also appreciate that when I have been required to like,

133
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:10,240
provide some input, somebody has been willing to like take me in matrix because I'm not watching

134
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:14,400
all the GitHub threads all the time. So there is that space to be like, Hey, can you go look at

135
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:18,560
this? And then they just link me to the issue on GitHub that I need to take a look at. And I think

136
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:22,880
that has been a useful combination. Yeah, it's nice. It feels like kind of one community and not

137
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:26,560
disparate places. You know, you see a lot of folks kind of onboarding and matrix getting tips for

138
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:30,240
stuff, maybe throwing out pie in the sky ideas or talking about, you know, sort of vaguer things

139
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:33,680
before they're ready to shape it into a specific issue. And it's really nice. And I think the

140
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:37,120
reason why it's working well for people who've never contributed to an open source project

141
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:41,520
before is a lot of them have contributed to their own projects before. And that's absolutely a

142
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:46,320
factor. And I think a big part of it is Brent and Stefan's stewardship. I think they've helped

143
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:53,120
integrate people and, and kind of act as that PMO because it needs somebody who can, especially in

144
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:57,680
our situation where there's sometimes business requirements that we just have certain things we

145
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:01,280
want done, or we want to make sure we have certain features or things like that. And so you need

146
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:05,920
somebody who can interface all of that. And I think that's also helped make it a successful project.

147
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:10,160
It kind of makes them the spirit of the project in a way to, you know, sort of the ambassador

148
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:14,800
of the culture and how things get done and welcoming new users. And that's, that's really

149
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:18,800
nice to have established. Although, are we celebrating too soon? I mean, we kind of have

150
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:22,640
like a mission accomplished sign behind us right now. We're not actually done yet. Careful. There

151
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:28,960
are some very large sub projects that still need some work, sort of like the archive, for instance,

152
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:33,920
and some people are working on that on the background. But one of the main thrusts of my

153
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:38,480
being here at Alex's place for the last, what, three weeks, something like that, has been to try

154
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:42,800
to get Alex involved in the project. And he did mention that he he has been involved. But Alex,

155
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:47,360
you did some crazy neat stuff that I only understand about 50% of. Can you walk us through

156
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:53,200
that? Well, for the last couple of years, we've been running the Jupyter broadcasting

157
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:57,520
infrastructure sort of here, there and everywhere. I think it was about a couple of years ago,

158
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:04,080
that we, we started deploying some infrastructure for the self hosted show. And I wanted to use

159
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:08,480
infrastructure as code to do that, you know, things like ansible and terraform to do that to manage,

160
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:14,000
you know, things like DNS records, why would we want to log in manually to the Cloudflare

161
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:20,080
interface, for example, type in some numbers like cavemen, and every time we make a change,

162
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:27,360
that doesn't really thrill me that kind of stuff. What does thrill me is, you know, having a specific

163
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:34,160
label in my Docker compose file, and having the the code have the ability to pass through that

164
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:41,120
entire compose file, pull out the text from those specific labels in ansible, and then use an

165
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:46,880
ansible module to update the Cloudflare DNS record to match the IP address with the DNS entry that

166
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:53,280
that I'm looking for. So that's one of the things that we've done is the the website has moved from

167
00:13:53,280 --> 00:14:02,080
jupyterbroadcasting.net. Now it's at new.jupyterbroadcasting.com, N E W, new.jupyterbroadcasting.com.

168
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:09,120
And there it will stay until we're MVP version 1.0, whatever you're calling it. Once it's in

169
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:13,840
production, obviously, that will turn into jupyterbroadcasting.com. The other thing that

170
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:20,800
we've done is automated using GitHub actions. So for those that aren't familiar, GitHub actions is

171
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:27,520
a free continuous integration platform that's kind of built into GitHub. It's honestly has made

172
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:34,160
tools like Jenkins almost kind of irrelevant overnight for projects like ours. So you know,

173
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:39,040
I mentioned Linux server a few minutes ago, but but back when I was involved in that project,

174
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:46,160
we had our own Jenkins server that was had remote workers at team members houses and it would SSH

175
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:51,840
in and run jobs on their, you know, Raspberry Pi's, for example, to build Pi images and super neat

176
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:57,520
stuff. But let's be honest, that's kind of a pain in the bum. And so what GitHub actions gives us

177
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:03,520
is the ability to run jobs on their infrastructure. And, you know, GitHub's owned by Microsoft,

178
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:08,160
so everything runs on Azure. So it's, it's reasonably performant. And most importantly,

179
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:14,720
it's free. So why wouldn't we use it? It's not completely open source. That's one argument.

180
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:21,440
But free and open ish. I don't know. I think it's fine. And not, not irreplaceable either,

181
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:26,000
to be honest, Alex, like we if we needed to eventually change where we build the site at it,

182
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,080
it would take us an evening, right? It's not the end of the world. So here's the thing we were

183
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:36,160
we're building this Hugo site, and it's 20,000 pages, I think 20, just nearly 21,000 pages at

184
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:42,160
this time. On my MacBook Pro, which is one of the M one chips, it takes nine seconds to build the

185
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:53,440
website. Nine seconds. But I want it now. However, what we're doing is building it on one of the

186
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:58,000
Linode boxes that we use for the self hosted infrastructure. And this box is hosting quite

187
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:04,560
a few things. Now, actually, it's hosting the new JB website. It's hosting our notes infrastructure,

188
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:09,920
our notes infrastructure. So hedge doc is up there. There's a bunch of stuff. There's probably

189
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:14,880
a spin. Yes. Yeah, there's probably about, I don't know, 15 or 20 services up there,

190
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:19,360
between all the various things, and just throwing another nginx container on there hosting a Hugo

191
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:25,040
site is absolutely no sweat for this thing. What does make it break a sweat, though, is building

192
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:32,160
the Hugo website. So when it's building the site, it's engaging all four cores of this box, and it

193
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:38,240
takes 44 seconds. So not the nine seconds of an M one MacBook Pro, but 44 seconds is still pretty

194
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:43,440
good enough. Faster than I could have manually created the WordPress post and posted the episode

195
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:47,840
still. So that's something. And the real nice thing about it is as part of the workflow that

196
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:52,480
happens in the GitHub action, everything happens declaratively and sequentially. So you say,

197
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:57,760
right, first of all, I want to clone the new code onto the onto the box. And then I'm going to SSH

198
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:03,840
into the box and do we're using a make file, which is another thing I'll touch on in a minute that

199
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:10,400
we simplified. It builds the website, and then only once the build is successful, does it actually

200
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:15,440
pull down the old container and replace it with the new one. So the downtime when it performs an

201
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:22,240
update is about a second or two, which I think is perfectly acceptable. Now, something I alluded to

202
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:27,760
a moment ago is the make file updates that we've done. The version that was there before was a

203
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:33,920
Brent confided in me that the the chap that submitted those changes had never written a make

204
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:39,040
file make file before and did pretty good considering indeed. However, I think the thing,

205
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:44,720
one of the principles I like to apply to this sort of project is simplicity is best keep it simple,

206
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:50,480
stupid, you know, and the make file that was there was trying to do a couple of things it was

207
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:56,080
trying to cater to local build environments and also Docker build environments. And so

208
00:17:56,080 --> 00:18:02,720
we've taken the decision to just standardize on Docker as the build environment for everything.

209
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:09,040
That way, people across all architectures, all servers, all places, you know, it doesn't matter

210
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:14,240
where you know exactly which version of Hugo you're running, you know, exactly which encapsulated

211
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:19,200
version of libraries you have, etc, etc. So hopefully, it should make things for people

212
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:25,440
across the world who want to contribute to this thing easier to contribute to, or move it if we

213
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:30,320
ever needed to move it to a new server or new location to absolutely yeah. And then we were

214
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:36,080
talking about well, where once we've built the site, do we push it to a Docker registry somewhere

215
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:41,440
like Docker hub or GitHub container registry or GitLab or, or any, you know, there's lots of

216
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:46,160
options. And ultimately, because of the way we've we've actually decided to do it, we're just SSH

217
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:50,720
ing into the server using the GitHub action, fetching the latest changes from Git doing the

218
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:56,000
build, and we don't actually push an image to a registry at all. Yeah, simplicity. I mean, there

219
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:02,400
were some great ideas of how to accomplish that. And many of them had multiple parts. And I think

220
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:08,160
landing on simplicity is going to be good for future proofing this thing. Again, it keeps costs

221
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:14,160
down, it makes the deployment time faster. And we don't actually need versioned artifacts of the

222
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:18,720
website. If you think about it, we already have that by the commits in the repo. Yeah, that's

223
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:23,920
true. That's actually really nice. That's one of the things I love about this system. That's great.

224
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:28,160
And I also feel like I have to be more accountable. Like I have to explain my changes now too,

225
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,800
because you got to say what you know, what is this commit about? I'm like, well, here's what I'm

226
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:35,920
updating and why I'm doing it. And I never did that before with the WordPress website. I'll tell

227
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:40,240
you that it's sometimes bugging with start working, stop working, you never knew what was happening.

228
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:45,360
That's the thing, right? I mean, there are several principles in software development, which we're

229
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:51,840
trying to inject into this project. One of which is feature branches. So any new feature for the

230
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:59,040
website goes to feature slash name of feature, you know, let's say update host, image, whatever it

231
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:03,600
is. And then that goes through a peer review process. So any changes that make it to production

232
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:08,480
are now automatically built and applied by the user. And that's a really good thing.

233
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:13,120
Now automatically built and applied, but only once they've been reviewed by two or three people,

234
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:20,400
whatever the processes we land on looks like. And then for infrastructure changes, we have a similar

235
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:26,800
thing. So it'd be infra slash, you know, update IP address, for example, that kind of thing. And

236
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:32,000
then myself, maybe in ways or Brent could review that and, and merge that stuff. So yeah, and you

237
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,000
did create a separate repository for the infrastructure stuff. I think that's an important

238
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:40,800
distinction as well. Yeah, I mean, didn't actually create it was actually the old self hosted show

239
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:47,600
GitHub organization. And we've migrated that info repo across. So the really nice thing about doing

240
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:51,760
it this way is I haven't really had to build hardly anything at all, all the code was already there.

241
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:56,320
And I've been using it to manage my personal infrastructure for the last five or six years.

242
00:20:56,320 --> 00:21:00,160
And so it's pretty battle tested. There's a there's a couple of there's a couple of things in

243
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:05,200
it that I know how it works. And I'll document those things. But for the most part, it's,

244
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:11,200
it's all in the make file. So I have a question in terms of performance. So we have it on a

245
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:18,720
linode box. One advantage that scale and scale engine had as a host is Alan builds a CDN and he

246
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:25,360
puts a lot of the PHP files and the CSS files and the image files across this CDN, which

247
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:29,920
theoretically helps with performance, although I think performance has not been fantastic,

248
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:34,240
because the the flaw has been the database isn't super fast, it all has to connect to that database.

249
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:38,000
So what are we doing for performance in terms of like global audience and reaching this all

250
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:42,720
in one linode box and that kind of stuff? Right now diddly squat. Yeah, right now. Well, yeah,

251
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:46,240
it's a we should be clear right now. It's a test site. It's a development site.

252
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:49,520
But we would like people to look at it new dot Jupiter broadcasting.com.

253
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:55,920
There were some ideas floated in the GitHub around using s3 to host the Hugo site rather than a

254
00:21:55,920 --> 00:22:01,200
container ran into some issues, which we may be able to work around some other way. I don't know

255
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:07,360
yet, but it took about 17 minutes to upload the website to an S three bucket versus the less than

256
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:14,320
one minute to build and deploy it as a container. Now, I am a cloud flare noob. I've only just

257
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:19,520
recently accepted cloud flare into my life after resisting for a long time. But I know you're more

258
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:24,400
familiar with it, Alex. But I'm, I'm pretty sure there's some some caching tricks we could do at

259
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:29,440
the cloud for cloud flare level as well, too, right? They do have a proxy service, which

260
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:36,400
should help protect us against things like D doses, as well as provide us with more of a CDN style

261
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:44,080
caching layer. And since it's a flat file site, maybe that's sufficient. Yeah, in theory. But the

262
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:50,400
issue is when you enable the caching button on cloud flare, it changes the IP addresses. So you

263
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:54,560
end up being low balance between a couple of things. And then the headers don't quite route

264
00:22:54,560 --> 00:23:00,000
properly. And I haven't quite figured that out yet. And if anybody is an expert on that, please

265
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:05,200
jump into there's a GitHub issue open for this issue. Right now, come and help me figure it out,

266
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:10,160
please. I could see that being one problem, especially on release day. You know, that was an

267
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:13,600
issue we had before is on release day, this site would get slammed for the first few hours and then

268
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:18,080
file, you know, this page doesn't load and stuff like that. Now the files will be hosted on a

269
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:23,280
different CDN for the mp3s and whatnot. So that'll help because the cloud flare released I can't

270
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:28,000
remember what it's called our two, I think as like a layer that sits in front of s3 and caches

271
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,800
everything there. So maybe in time, that's something we can investigate. But for the MVP,

272
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:36,080
I think we'll stick with what we've got. Yeah, I mean, there's also a lot of ways we could pull

273
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:40,400
that off. Because we could also use linodes object storage, and maybe it builds on that

274
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:44,160
Linode and then it uploads to object storage, and then our two sits in front of that or something

275
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:47,440
like that. I mean, there's a lot we could play with. But I think we'll have to just get a feel

276
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:52,080
for how the performance is, because the component that I don't really know, and I'm sure was always

277
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:57,760
a factor in the past, was the database, I think, for us, the bottleneck was when people would come

278
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:02,480
to the website after like Linux unplugged came out, or Linux action show came out, the database

279
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:06,160
would just get absolutely slammed with page loads. And then you're generating that WordPress page,

280
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:10,480
every single time the page generates, even with some of those caching plugins, there's still a

281
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:14,960
lot you're dynamically generating. Not a problem with Hugo, of course. Another issue you've got to

282
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:22,960
solve for with s3 is TLS certificates. So the s3 object storage that Linode provide, they provide

283
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:28,480
an out of the box TLS certificate for linodeobjects.com, whatever the bucket name is.

284
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:33,120
But you would then have to figure out how to configure your own Jupiter broadcasting.com

285
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:38,480
TLS stuff. Right, right. And at the moment, with the containerized version that's deployed,

286
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:42,000
that's all handled through traffic and let's encrypt. Yeah, I mean, maybe that'll be performing

287
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:46,400
enough. We'll just see, right? I mean, I would prefer to leave all the s3 stuff out if we don't

288
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:50,960
need it because it just keeps it simpler. I guess we'll find out when this episode releases, huh?

289
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:55,680
Yeah, we just need more people trying it. Mini stress test. Yeah, we just got to build more

290
00:24:55,680 --> 00:25:00,320
traffic and then because when we flip it live, what I'm thinking is eventually we just start

291
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:05,840
de-emphasizing the fireside pages and we stop sending people to the individual fireside pages

292
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:09,600
and we start sending people to jupiterbroadcasting.com slash office. Just one

293
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:13,360
great place to go. So and then we'll start sending more and more of the traffic back to

294
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:17,280
our main site again because we've spent the last three and a half, four years sending people to

295
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:22,000
our fireside pages because that's where we could really apply leverage at that time.

296
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:27,760
But this is a way better setup. So thank you for all the work on the info guys. I feel like we're

297
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:32,640
in a way better position to go live now, but also we're in a better position to maintain it over the

298
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:38,800
long term as well. So it's good to be figuring that out before we've even gone into production.

299
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:43,840
Everything is in git and everything is in for his code, which just gives me the warm fuzzies, you

300
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:49,840
know? All right. Thank you gentlemen for coming into the office. I appreciate your time. Appreciate

301
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:53,360
you being here. Brent, where do we want to send people that are listening if they want to

302
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:58,320
participate? Yeah, I think we'll put a few links in the show notes, but a good place to go. If

303
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:03,680
you just want to see what the heck we're talking about, new.jupiterbroadcasting.com and I think

304
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:13,680
our Jupiter broadcasting GitHub page is probably the place to go. So now is the time to really put

305
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:19,040
this thing through its paces and a mini Mac, you had a suggestion regarding the GitHub aspect of

306
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:24,240
this and how you can actually integrate GitLab too if one wants. Yeah, indeed. In fact, so for

307
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:30,000
those who don't want to use get because it's owned by a company that you don't want to mention your

308
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:36,160
name. So all the GitLab users know that they have the possibility to create their own homepage on

309
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:44,880
GitLab hosted on GitLab. And there is a possibility to in fact deploy a Hugo website similar to

310
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:54,320
Git actions within GitLab. So you are limited to these GitLab homepage service, but you can in fact

311
00:26:54,320 --> 00:27:00,080
do the same thing as you do now on Jupiter broadcasting. You can do it in combination with GitHub

312
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:06,960
and then have your own GitLab homepage based on Hugo and then you can just redirect your favorite

313
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:12,000
domain to that GitLab homepage and you're good. I don't really have an excuse, but I feel like we

314
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:16,960
don't give enough plugs for Git T as well, which is also a GitHub alternative. Doesn't necessarily

315
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:21,600
do some of the stuff we're talking about right now, but Git T is also a great solution. I've heard

316
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:26,640
really good things about Sourcehead as well. Oh yeah, I noticed Git T also just has an app you

317
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:31,360
can one click install an umbral now. I bet you they got a Linode something something or other.

318
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:36,000
I bet you they got a Linode something something one click as well. In fact, I want to say holler

319
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:42,960
over to Linode. Linode.com slash Jupiter. Linode is investing right here in office hours because

320
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:47,440
they want to invest in the community. I mean this isn't like come on this isn't going to be

321
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:54,160
JB's biggest show and Linode is savvy enough to know that. But they also know that the community

322
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:58,880
is worth investing in that it pays dividends and that's also why they're making our road trip

323
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:05,600
possible again this year. So go to Linode.com slash Jupiter and get $100 in 60 day credit over

324
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:10,560
at Linode and you support the show. It's where we host everything that we do publicly now. Linode

325
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:17,920
also has a bunch of really nice advanced features. They support Terraform, Kubernetes, Ansible. They

326
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:24,720
have a really clean simple API that already has a bunch of pre created libraries for Python and for

327
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:29,920
Rust and for all the things. They also have a command line client that is choice. I really

328
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:37,120
love that. In fact, a little pro tip. Install the Linode command line client on your actual Linode

329
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:43,600
machine, right? So then when you're SSH into your Linode box, you could create a snapshot

330
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:49,440
of that very box on that box before you do a system update. Just take it to the next level,

331
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:55,280
guys. It's really easy. And of course, they have great things like S3 compatible object storage,

332
00:28:55,280 --> 00:29:00,160
which you could always use as the seed for, I don't know, R2. And then you could just like

333
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:08,560
have the most insane great CDN with incredible reach at great prices. Oh, and by the way, Linode

334
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:13,840
30 to 50% cheaper than the hyperscalers out there. But there's a lot of ways you can host,

335
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:17,920
but none of them are as good as Linode. They've got the best support. They got the best performance.

336
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:24,480
They got 11 data centers and nobody else invests deep into the community, into the media,

337
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:31,440
into the events, into the projects, even into things like road trips that just connect

338
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:37,520
all of us together. Who else is doing that? Nobody. So go to Linode.com slash Jupiter.

339
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:44,800
Support the show. Say thanks for your support and get that $100 to mess around. It's pretty fun.

340
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:51,280
Linode.com slash Jupiter. And you know, we like it because we're rebuilding this whole thing from

341
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:57,760
scratch. We could have hosted this stuff anywhere. You know, we could have put it anywhere and we

342
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:03,040
went with Linode. We choose Linode over and over again. You know, like a good marriage with your

343
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:08,160
loved one where you choose to be their partner over and over again. We choose Linode over and

344
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:14,400
over again. Linode.com slash Jupiter. Speaking of Linode, you know what else we have hosted on

345
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:21,200
Linode? What's that? Our massive matrix server. Oh yeah. Alex was showing me just how massive

346
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:28,000
that server is and it's a lot of triple digits is all I saw. Yeah. Yeah. You know, you don't

347
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:36,160
need the 96 gigs of RAM to run matrix, but it helps. You know? How many cores? I think it's

348
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:43,280
got 48 cores or something like that. It's, you know, here's the problem. You know where you

349
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:49,280
end up using all 48 cores is if you have 40 people logging in at once because every time a user logs

350
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:55,440
in and sinks their element client, it pegs one of the cores to a hundred percent. So if you have

351
00:30:55,440 --> 00:31:01,120
a dozen people logging in at once, that's a dozen cores locked up. They can't do anything else.

352
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:06,080
And so ultimately we're like, well, there's a lot of ways we can solve this and we need to make this

353
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:12,800
better and we need to use workers better. There's a lot still to do, but there is a way we can just

354
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:17,360
throw hardware at this and it will survive. And the server has been great. It's been, and the

355
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:22,000
community is continuing to grow. We just launched another matrix room that we wanted to let people

356
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:29,120
know about. It's for the Ohio Linux Fest that's coming up in December, December 2nd and 3rd.

357
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:33,120
You can find out info at olfconference.org. We'll have a link in the notes.

358
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:37,680
And this has been a thing that's happening more and more. And we just want to encourage the hell

359
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:41,600
out of it. Somebody contacted us and said, Hey, I'd like to organize my own meetup with fellow

360
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:48,880
Jupiter broadcasting listeners in the Columbus area. So we said, that's a great fricking idea.

361
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:53,520
So we created the Columbus club. So if you'd like to join our matrix room and coordinate

362
00:31:53,520 --> 00:32:00,160
for our Linux Fest meetup in Ohio, you can go to bit.ly slash Columbus club.

363
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:05,520
And there's already people in there organizing right now. It's already happening.

364
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:11,440
I noticed a bunch of venue suggestions. It's like months away. It's amazing.

365
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:14,560
Didn't we said we would set something up, but did we actually tell anybody?

366
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:18,480
Like did they just find it? I think we only mentioned it in Linux and plugged quickly.

367
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:22,560
And I think it was only on the pre pre show or something crazy like that. Well, it's a thing.

368
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:28,240
It's official bit.ly slash Columbus club. And another shout out for Ohio Linux Fest.

369
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:33,360
I really enjoy it. I've only made it once. And it was like before two of my children were born,

370
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:37,760
but I really enjoyed it. And I think it's a great crew out there. And it's going to be

371
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:43,760
at a brand new venue this year. The brand new Tower of Hilton Columbus downtown hotel.

372
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:48,640
I don't know if that's a good thing or not, but new seems nice.

373
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:54,160
I'm not sure it's completely done being built. I heard rumors in our little room that they were

374
00:32:54,160 --> 00:33:00,160
finishing some stuff. Really? That is a new hotel. Well, I mean, it's in December, so a brand brand

375
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:04,960
new. It's got that new hotel smell. Either way, I love a brand new hotel. I really wish I could go.

376
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:10,000
There's so many events this year that it just hasn't worked out for me. And it's really stinging

377
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:16,400
me in my, you know, my my missing events open wound. Your events feels, you know, if this goes

378
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:23,120
well, you know, I think we could have a meetup room for every major city, like some in Europe.

379
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:27,120
Why not? We've got one already. I think we should have some more. I shouldn't say this,

380
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:31,360
but I got to document it while I'm thinking about it. But I shouldn't say it while we're

381
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:36,160
in the middle of this project. But we need a website. We need a website. People can go

382
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:42,640
and organize meetups. It's not meetup.com. We need something specifically for J.B. audience

383
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:47,920
members to sort of self organize in their areas. So you're feeling like these matrix rooms maybe

384
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:51,440
aren't quite enough. And so I'm curious of the future. I think they're supplemental, right?

385
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:56,880
They're supplemental to meeting a meetup organized because you could have most people would use the

386
00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:00,480
Web page and they'd have some people that want to help organize the details or have questions.

387
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:05,040
They join the matrix room like like you have with the regular meetups. But this would be one

388
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:10,720
specifically for Jupiter broadcasting members to create their own. I know there are a few

389
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:16,240
open source like options, meetup alternatives, let's call them. I wonder if we can embed

390
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:21,600
something like that. Me, too. I wonder if anybody out there knows. I believe the the no agenda show

391
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:26,320
had a community member create the no agenda meetups page at no agenda meetups dot com.

392
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:30,560
And then you can either find a meetup or submit a meetup. I don't know exactly how it works. I've

393
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:35,680
never done it, but it seems like it's a tool that's built specifically. Maybe maybe it's

394
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:40,320
forked. I don't know. I can't really tell looking at it, but it's it's for their community to self

395
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:44,240
organize and do their own meetups. And maybe that's taking it too far, but it seems like that's

396
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:48,480
the next step. I'd really I encourage this kind of thing because number one, if these things

397
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:52,320
started picking up momentum every now and then we could drop in like rock stars like, hey, what's

398
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:57,040
up, everybody? Brent's here. Just a surprise visit. Yeah. Right. I think that'd be pretty great.

399
00:34:57,600 --> 00:35:01,760
So anyways, but it starts it starts with just a good old community chat room,

400
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:08,160
bit dot l y slash Columbus Club. If you have suggestions for other areas, if you're interested

401
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:12,000
in starting to meet up in your area, let us know. What do you think? Should they just hit us up on

402
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:18,160
Matrix? How should maybe boost it in? What, Brent? So many options. Um, it's a good question,

403
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:24,000
you know, and it brings me to the idea of, like, feature requests. And we've been trying to figure

404
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:29,680
out a good place for that. But I feel like any official channel, like if you want to send it into

405
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:34,560
one of the email addresses, I think you could probably go to new dot Jupiter broadcasting

406
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:38,720
dot com slash contact. There's a contact form there. That'd be a good way to do it.

407
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:43,520
It seems on topic. Otherwise, just hit us up somehow. But keep it brief, please.

408
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:47,680
It's time to get to some of the great boosts that have come into the show. And man, did we get a

409
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:53,280
bunch of great boosts. We got a stack of boosts. We got a boost bank that's busting. Last week,

410
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:59,440
we talked about why we didn't trust crypto and how there's crypto. And then there's Bitcoin.

411
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:03,200
And we talked a little bit about the future of boosts and how we're considering keeping the

412
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:08,400
segments tight and flowing and all of that. We got a lot of responses. So we are going to

413
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:13,520
consolidate some of the boosts. So if your boost doesn't get directly read this week, I 100%

414
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:17,920
promise you we did read it. We went through all of them before the show. We're just kind of pairing

415
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:24,480
it down a little bit for reasons that I think will become clear as we go along. So Bradley,

416
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:29,520
why don't you kick us off with our first from Mr. Castaversa? Sure. Rusty Castaversa wrote in

417
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:34,480
thousand cents. Getting involved with crypto in general is hard, and I don't trust things that

418
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:39,600
make it easier. I also don't want to give my ID. And thanks to your suggestion of Fountain,

419
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:44,400
I earn SaaS through listening and can send them back without giving up what I consider to be

420
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:50,480
private info. I think this is great that Rusty is thinking about the privacy and the KYC stuff so

421
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:54,000
that know your customer regulations are just kind of like what you got to do if you're going to be

422
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:57,600
a financial institution in the US. It's not necessarily this way outside the US, although

423
00:36:57,600 --> 00:37:01,840
I imagine it's probably pretty similar. It's got to be similar up in Canada, right? Yeah,

424
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:07,040
I believe it totally is. Welcome to the West, where we're going to track all of your financial

425
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:11,840
info just in case you might be a terrorist. And so if you don't like that, and I can understand

426
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:17,360
why you wouldn't, because you don't necessarily want to have your ID attached to a Bitcoin address,

427
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:23,760
then I recommend RoboSats. You need the Tor browser, but RoboSats is fantastic. Just take

428
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:28,320
your time with it. You can anonymously buy Bitcoin. You find a seller. You can read reviews

429
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:33,120
about the seller, and then you pick the one that supports the payment method you want. Maybe you

430
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:37,760
want cash. Maybe you want to check. Maybe you want PayPal. Maybe you want cash app. Maybe you want

431
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:43,040
whatever Apple Pay. RoboSats will let you do that, and then they'll help you escrow it and make sure

432
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:46,480
everything's safe and good to go. And it's all done over the Lightning Network. So the privacy

433
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:51,840
is just absolutely outstanding. It's how I'm going to be buying all of my long-time holding

434
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:56,160
Sats going forward. As far as spending money goes, like the ones I'm just buying right now,

435
00:37:56,160 --> 00:38:00,320
as far as spending money goes, like the ones I'm just boosting around town like a maniac,

436
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:03,440
I think Strike's fine for that, because you're sending it over the Lightning Network. They're

437
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:07,280
going into a node wallet. They're getting mixed with everybody else's. And then shout out to

438
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:15,200
Fountain. In the last three months, I have earned 36,084 Sats. That is not trivial. Yeah, just by

439
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:20,560
listening to podcasts. That is impressive. I play their game. I listen to some of the supported clips

440
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:25,440
and the popular clips, but I don't mind that. I would have done that anyways. And I boost and

441
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:30,160
support some of the clips and that helps you earn more. And then I've also referred some friends

442
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:35,280
and that helps you earn more as well. But that's 36,000 Sats in the last three months. And I can

443
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:39,440
just send those around to different shows that I listen to without ever buying anything. All I'm

444
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:46,160
doing is just listening. Getting paid for what you already do. Al Carney wrote in with 1,024 Sats.

445
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:54,640
From my limited understanding, Lightning is not Bitcoin, but rather a layer on top of it.

446
00:38:54,640 --> 00:39:00,080
I would assume that the extra convenience comes at the cost of fewer protections from bad actors

447
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:05,760
that the slower moving blockchain would provide. This is a good question, Al Carney, because in

448
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:11,760
blockchain world you can have fast and less secure and you can have decentralized and more secure,

449
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:18,080
but then you get slower. And so that's kind of the trade off. Lightning is sending Sats. It is Sats

450
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:22,880
that are being sent over the Lightning network. It's not a derivative. And Lightning does its

451
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:28,880
finalization on the Bitcoin blockchain. So all the transactions that are finalized are using

452
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:33,280
Bitcoin and the security in there. The reason why you can send them instantly, you don't have

453
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:38,880
to wait for the blocks to get processed, is because Lightning is based around channels.

454
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:43,760
These channels open up between nodes directly and they lock funds, it's called liquidity,

455
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:49,280
into these channels. And so if you want to send a 5,000 Sat boost, we need to have a channel that

456
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:55,280
has at least a 5,000 Sat capacity that the two ends have agreed to. Because those Sats are locked

457
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:59,120
to that channel and that's been settled on the blockchain, you can actually use that to move

458
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:05,440
these around. And so you get instant settlement with Lightning, it's private, it's peer to peer,

459
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:09,840
and it's actually using Sats and it's inheriting the security of the layer one blockchain,

460
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:13,600
which is Bitcoin. So Lightning is layer two, rides on top. It's a beautiful system.

461
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:18,480
And it's, I think, one of the bigger innovations that's coming out of Bitcoin and it'll eventually

462
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:22,960
be used for other things besides Bitcoin, I would imagine. And we have some pretty good

463
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:28,240
channels open with some important players too, don't we? Yeah, we have like a big million Sat

464
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:31,920
channel open to Fountain FM, so people, if they're using that app, boost directly in.

465
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:36,800
I got a channel open to your nodes, so you get a split on office hours. And instead of having to

466
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:41,040
route all around the network and take those little tiny fees, which are like fractions of a penny,

467
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:46,160
you just get it directly from my node. In fact, when I look at my stats, I see it all the time.

468
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:50,400
My node is communicating directly with your node, nobody in between us. A boost comes in,

469
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:54,720
it lands on our node, you get part of the split and our node helps route it. It's so great.

470
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:55,680
Node to node network.

471
00:40:55,680 --> 00:41:03,680
Yeah, it is. It's one big happy node network. We got a row of McDucks. That's 22,222 Sats from

472
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:10,720
Marcel. Thank you kindly. He says, it's easy to dismiss RHEL when 99.9% of all the distros out

473
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:15,600
there are HANA Montana Linux. I don't think any amount of Sats should automatically get a message

474
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:19,840
onto the show either, by the way. It should just be based on the quality of the comment.

475
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:23,840
You shouldn't be able to advertise your own thing for a thousand Sats, for example.

476
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:29,680
You know, as a team, Marcel, we have been kicking this around because we want to keep the

477
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:34,640
productions tight. We don't necessarily want to run long every single week. And we've been floating

478
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:41,760
around different ideas. One idea we're currently having is we'll just read the top four boosts in

479
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:47,200
every show. And the top is just in terms of comment quality, not necessarily Sat amount. We'll read

480
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:53,120
the top four boosts every show. And then we'll also read the baller boosts in the show. So you

481
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:58,400
get your baller boosts read and otherwise we'll just read all of them because we read 100% of them

482
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:03,360
and we'll just pull forward the top four is what I'm thinking. And I don't know, it's new. Maybe

483
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:08,880
it's a practice we should try here first. It seems like something we'd probably want to standardize on

484
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:13,600
all the shows just to make it consistent. What are your thoughts, Brent? Yeah, I think it's actually

485
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:18,640
a surprisingly good problem to have. You know, I remember months ago we were just trying this out

486
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:23,680
for for the first time and we weren't sure if this was going to take off. But clearly it has and

487
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:28,080
people are loving it. There's like, you know, so many little games and like nifty little inside

488
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:34,880
jokes and stuff. I love that about the boosts. But, you know, we don't want the shows to be like

489
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:39,360
just boosts. I think that would actually take away from the content we've been working so hard to

490
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:45,440
produce. So, yeah, I think we should try it. This show is a good way, you know, a good place to try

491
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:49,600
that stuff. But it doesn't mean we're going to land on the right solution right away. So keep

492
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:53,520
sending in your suggestions and I guess your opinions in this case. Let us know what you

493
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:58,880
think of the top four idea plus baller. Top four plus baller boosts read on each show. Let's,

494
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:03,360
if we can remember, let's try it next office hours and see how it goes. And, you know,

495
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:08,160
boosting your feedback because we're just kind of figuring this out. This is the show where we run

496
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:15,840
with scissors for sure. DFJ 225 boosts in with eight thousand one hundred and ninety two sets

497
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:21,920
coming in hot with the booth. I love that one. He says, I appreciate the boost and the crypto

498
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:26,720
conversation last week. I can see the positives with Bitcoin and podcasting and other independent

499
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:31,920
efforts. But guys, I think it's hard to separate out the use cases from all the other, quote,

500
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:36,720
crypto bros who are hyping things up in order to just make a profit. And they largely look at

501
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:41,520
Bitcoin as just an investment vehicle. Sadly, I think it's hard to stand out from this noise.

502
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:47,040
To me, this is a key difference from the early days of Linux. The hype was not from people

503
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:54,880
looking to get rich quick. I agree and disagree, DFJ. I think you were probably just hanging out

504
00:43:54,880 --> 00:44:02,000
in the in the good crowds. There was in the late 90s, in the early aughts, a mad gold rush

505
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:07,760
in corporate Linux. And there was a culture shift where we stopped calling things free software

506
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:12,320
and we started using the term open source more. And then it kind of became like this big deal

507
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:16,480
when different companies would start switching to the use the word open source. Like when Red Hat

508
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:21,920
did it, it was this big upset in the community. Oh, they've gone so corporate. And there was

509
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:27,920
a genuine gold rush. The story of how Linux got to the X86 server market is a fascinating one

510
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:35,760
and maybe one we should dig into someday just for like a little bit of, you know, context, I suppose.

511
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:40,240
Revolution OS isn't bad to check out. It's on YouTube. And I'll have a link in the show notes

512
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:46,480
to kind of just give you an idea of how far things have come from those early radical thinkers

513
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:52,880
to today's corporately deployed and managed Linux. There was a huge gold rush in the early days of

514
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:58,080
Linux. And, you know, I think a lot of us in the desktop and just enthusiast space managed to stay

515
00:44:58,080 --> 00:45:04,320
fairly well insulated from that, just like those Bitcoin stackers who are just stacking sats and

516
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:08,560
staying humble and going to work every day. They're not really making a big deal about it.

517
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:14,400
That's that's a huge percentage of the Bitcoiners out there. Fryer Tech boosted it with 2000 sats.

518
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:20,560
He's going to send in an email, too. But, you know, he had a message for those who are experiencing,

519
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:26,800
quote, boost fatigue. And this is not our message. This is a message from Fryer Tech. But I think

520
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:32,160
I feel like Fryer Tech at some point has been a business owner. He writes, I hope someday you have

521
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:37,200
the luxury of running your own business where the hours of work never end. You have to ensure you

522
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:41,840
deliver a quality product to your customers and you have to make it a safe space and place for

523
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:46,880
your employees to thrive. If you feel like you're hearing too much about how you can keep supporting

524
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:52,800
a business that you kind of depend on every day, maybe you don't realize how much value for value

525
00:45:52,800 --> 00:46:02,240
is actually helping you. Stop complaining, Karen. Spicy. There's, you know, a bit of I had this

526
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:07,040
realization, too, like I think I know what somebody's job is like or what an industry is like.

527
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:15,600
And then this is like when, for example, I became an IT contractor for doctors and lawyers and an

528
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:21,040
airline. And I thought I knew what those businesses were beforehand. And then I get inside and I

529
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:26,640
realize I knew 10 percent. They end up spending way more time on stuff I never knew about.

530
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:34,080
And the cost to run a business, you can never understand how wildly expensive and ridiculously

531
00:46:34,080 --> 00:46:38,000
costly it is to run a business until you've run one, especially here in the States right now.

532
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:42,160
It's incredible. So I appreciate the sentiment, Friar Tech. Thank you very much. You know,

533
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:45,760
it's not our audience's problem, though. We just try to produce a great product, give them something

534
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:50,080
that they want to support. And the ones that get it that do participate in the value for value

535
00:46:50,080 --> 00:46:56,080
system, they are so, so critical to the, you know, the long term survival of both the network, but

536
00:46:56,080 --> 00:47:00,000
also our passion and our enthusiasm, because when we do see somebody get it and they're contributing

537
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:04,480
to the website or they're sending in a boost or maybe they're sharing the show with somebody,

538
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:07,760
you know, or they're participating in a live stream in a way that contributes value. It's like

539
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:12,320
that's what keeps us going. That's what makes us keep going after 15 years. And so the people who

540
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:18,080
do get it are super valuable to us. Dylan wrote in with three thousand five hundred cents.

541
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:25,280
Boost, you know, actually, as an aside, this is Brent. I feel like Dylan wrote in and mentioned

542
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:31,920
how to pronounce their name and I totally forget. So apologies. Sorry. OK, here we go with the

543
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:38,400
boost. Fun fact, you have to be invited to a matrix space to enjoy it. So unless JB provides a link

544
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:44,480
to it on, say, their site, you can't reach it. I can browse the rooms on your server in an app,

545
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:51,120
but it's not as great, in my opinion. Yeah. So a space. Let's back up a little bit. A space

546
00:47:51,120 --> 00:47:57,040
space is kind of what it sounds like. It's an area, a place to organize all of your other rooms.

547
00:47:57,040 --> 00:48:02,000
So we've got rooms for the shows and different meetups and Bitcoin and all that stuff. And so

548
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:07,840
you need one directory to organize it all. That's what a space is. And so we have a Jupiter broadcasting

549
00:48:07,840 --> 00:48:13,360
space where you can get an overview of all of our matrix rooms when you go to bit dot l y slash

550
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:17,360
Jupiter Colony. But better than that, we're going to have the matrix linked. We're going to have

551
00:48:17,360 --> 00:48:20,640
the mumbling. We're going to have all this stuff linked on the new website. In fact, it's already

552
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:26,800
there if you want to check it out. Heck, yeah. New dot Jupiter Broadcasting dot com. Peter wrote in

553
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:35,360
with 5000 sats boost. You guys get it. Crypto equals scam. Those initial feelings of distrust

554
00:48:35,360 --> 00:48:40,080
is a healthy sign of a critical mind. I think people should be critical of this stuff as well.

555
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:47,920
And I hope that our position that Bitcoin is not like the rest of crypto will be the signal through

556
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:53,600
the noise long term. Yeah, I think that critical mind and the distrust is good. But I think I also

557
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:58,560
think there's some really cool technology behind like, say, Bitcoin and lightning and some of the

558
00:48:58,560 --> 00:49:03,680
open source projects happening there. So I think I would suggest, you know, be cautious, but also

559
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:08,640
stay curious and go check those out. They're worth they're worth looking at. True Grits wrote in 6000

560
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:18,240
sats coming in hot with the boost every time. I love that one. I'm very much not tired of the boosts

561
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:23,120
nor of the sound bites. I very much enjoy them. Fountain is getting better and better and better

562
00:49:23,120 --> 00:49:29,760
as a podcast player. And many of the early bugs have been well sorted out. Are there chapter

563
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:33,200
markers set for the beginning and the end of boosts? Maybe if people are tired of them, they

564
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:38,400
could just skip them. Absolutely. In fact, Drew goes to the hard work of chapter in every single

565
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:44,880
boost individually. And might I add very creatively and hilariously sometimes, which I appreciate.

566
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:52,000
Yeah. We got a double boost from true grits satellite sets. You mentioned that the boosts

567
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:57,360
have a split that goes to Brent. How? How does that work? How about the SAT streams? Does that

568
00:49:57,360 --> 00:50:03,120
get split with Brent as well? Yeah, it's the same system. So when you boost in in one boost a gram

569
00:50:03,120 --> 00:50:08,880
with a sum or you just stream on the back end, that's all the same splits because it just goes

570
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:14,320
by what we define in the RSS feed. So the part of podcasting 2.0 amongst the many features it's

571
00:50:14,320 --> 00:50:19,920
bringing to podcasting is a value tag that you add to the RSS feed. And in there you just say,

572
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:25,520
you know, this X amount, this percent goes to this person, this percent goes to this person,

573
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:29,920
this percent goes to this person. And it automatically figures it out if you're

574
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:35,760
doing a one time big boost or you're doing a stream in the back end. It's all the same tech.

575
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:40,400
And what's beautiful is because the lightning network is so cheap for transactions, you could

576
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:45,680
actually do one, two, three sats at a time and that still works. So Chris, the way I understand

577
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:52,480
that the lightning network works is on these lightning invoices. So whenever you send a

578
00:50:53,120 --> 00:50:58,160
certain amount of sats, it automatically creates an invoice. Is that how these streaming works?

579
00:50:58,160 --> 00:51:02,800
That doesn't seem very efficient. Generally, the way it would work is for you to send me sats,

580
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:07,440
right, you would invoice me and then I would scan the invoice like with a mobile app. It would just

581
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:10,320
auto fill the information and it would send you those sats. And it's nice and quick,

582
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:16,000
but it doesn't actually have to be invoice based. The lightning spec does allow for just sending,

583
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:21,440
just spraying sats in a direction as well without qualifying them. Yeah. Here you go. Here's some

584
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:26,800
sats. Yeah. But you know what? It's great for these types of things because you could also see

585
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:31,360
how like you could use it for car rentals, scooter rentals when you're in a city. Oh,

586
00:51:31,360 --> 00:51:37,200
that is a great idea. Nice. Yeah. I could see it go in places, Brent. I really could. All right.

587
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:46,560
We got 2,222 sats, a row of ducks from hashtag reckless. He says a cold shower in Raleigh is more

588
00:51:46,560 --> 00:51:52,400
like a warm shower. Really? Let's be honest. So true. We both were talking about our cold showers.

589
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:58,080
I did get the water heater fixed Thursday last week. You know, it's been, I think over here,

590
00:51:58,080 --> 00:52:04,720
it's been three, two, at least two weeks now, maybe three of trying to get contractors over here on,

591
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:08,400
on, on some kind of home warranty that Alex is trying to take advantage of. And it's,

592
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:13,440
it's not fixed and they're all back now. So you're all taking cold showers while we're taking

593
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:20,800
somewhat warm showers occasionally. You know, it's, it's actually kind of embarrassing for

594
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:25,200
the contractors. Alex had a firm talking with them this morning, so we'll see what happens.

595
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:28,240
Oh, maybe something will happen. You know what? This is just prepping you for hashtag van life

596
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:31,840
where these kinds of things happen on the regular. You're just getting ready. I think,

597
00:52:31,840 --> 00:52:36,240
I think I, I much prefer getting my own hands dirty and being responsible. Yeah, really.

598
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:41,920
Hashtag reckless says, I had some thoughts about donating versus buying too. He writes,

599
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:49,680
I donate as a member because I want to support the show and I'm buying the ad free feed. I boost

600
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:55,440
because it's fun and I'm buying a potential shout out on a future show. Possibly this is another way

601
00:52:55,440 --> 00:53:00,960
to reframe the buying versus donating argument. A thousand sat boost minimum would probably make

602
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:05,600
sense or something more. He says maybe even 10,000 sats, but I want to back up the part that I liked

603
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:09,840
that I thought made a lot of sense. I boost because it's fun and I'm buying a potential

604
00:53:09,840 --> 00:53:15,120
shout out on a future show. I donate because I want to support the show and I'm buying

605
00:53:15,120 --> 00:53:20,320
the ad free feed. That's a really smart way to look at it. Yeah, it's a neat way to frame things.

606
00:53:20,320 --> 00:53:26,560
And, uh, I really appreciate that perspective as well. Got me thinking. Optimus Gray boosted

607
00:53:26,560 --> 00:53:34,080
in with a row of Mcducks. That's 22,222 sats. This old duck still got it. Brent, I hope you're

608
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:39,360
ready for the cottonwood cleanup at the studio. There's still cleanup to do. There is some,

609
00:53:39,360 --> 00:53:44,160
it's much better. Chris. There is some, it's, it's fine. It's fine. It's fine. Um, I'm purging

610
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:49,680
some of my non JB podcast and I've been thinking about unfollowing any podcaster that does the

611
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:58,240
dynamically inserted ads. Guys, I'm getting Spanish ads from an English podcaster. Why?

612
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:03,760
The podcast is okay. I mean, it's no JB. It's okay. But I'm thinking about maybe we should

613
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:10,880
just start unfollowing the podcasters who have the auto inserted ads. You know, this is, this is

614
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:14,320
probably going to cause some backlash. People are going to hate this stuff, especially if they're

615
00:54:14,320 --> 00:54:18,880
coming in in a different language. You know, one thing I've noticed since being here at Alex's,

616
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:23,920
cause he's got all these gizmos is he's got this fancy system on his television that skips ads on

617
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:29,040
the YouTube, uh, I guess app that he's got on there. Yeah. It's like a separate app. That is

618
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:35,440
crazy. Cool. I don't quite know how it works on the like, yeah. Tell me how it works. You know,

619
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:41,280
it's crazy, right? Because I, it even skips like their Patreon plugs. It skips their swag plugs.

620
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:46,960
It, it skips when they're asking for likes. And of course it skips the ads because it's community

621
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:53,680
contributed. I, people watch and then that also use this extension or this app and then they

622
00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:56,720
contribute it in real time. And then so by the time you sit down, which, you know, after video

623
00:54:56,720 --> 00:55:00,720
has been up for a little bit, everybody's filled out all the info and you sit down to watch it.

624
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:04,640
And it just, it glides over all of that stuff. That is amazing. I mean, this is,

625
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:09,200
if this thing took off, it would screw YouTubers. It really would.

626
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:11,520
Well, but it, you know, if this keeps up with podcasts,

627
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:15,600
it might actually come to podcasting as well. And I wonder how that would change things.

628
00:55:15,600 --> 00:55:18,960
That's why you got to be careful. And it's like with these dynamically inserted ads.

629
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:24,240
The other thing is it's how successful is that ad going to be? How good of an ad is that for

630
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:28,400
the audience? How good of a fit is it? Like the reason why Linode sponsors the show is because

631
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:32,960
Linode is a great fit for our audience. Right. And we're users of Linode and that doesn't just

632
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:36,880
happen accidentally. It's like, we analyze what we use and what we think our audience would use

633
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:40,800
and what we think is a good company and who we can feel comfortable about recommending.

634
00:55:41,360 --> 00:55:46,480
And then we carefully approach that. And the dynamically inserted ads are the opposite of

635
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:50,320
that. And it just, yeah, I agree, Brent. It feels like it's going to create backlash.

636
00:55:50,320 --> 00:55:53,600
And here we have Optimus Grey. Sounds like it is creating backlash.

637
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:59,920
I feel, Chris, like we're so lucky that we are super passionate about our sponsors and have been

638
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:06,160
able, you know, in great thanks to the memberships and to everyone who sends in memberships. Thank

639
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:12,640
you. It allows us to be passionate about those ads, you know, although I do have this mattress

640
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:16,560
that I just got that I want to talk about. We should, we should, we should get into this.

641
00:56:16,560 --> 00:56:20,240
Let's hold on now. We'll talk about this off air. All right. If we can get a mattress,

642
00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:26,080
maybe like some Squarespace and a toothbrush or something, maybe some underwear. No, you know,

643
00:56:26,080 --> 00:56:31,360
I actually am super grateful for the members. And I feel like looking back over the last two and a

644
00:56:31,360 --> 00:56:36,080
half, two years or so when we went independent again, I think launching the memberships might

645
00:56:36,080 --> 00:56:39,360
have been one of the more critical maneuvers we made because it gave us this runway that we find

646
00:56:39,360 --> 00:56:44,960
today. The ad market sucks. And the kind of kind of pitches we're getting from some of these

647
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:49,440
companies, you guys would never want to hear us do. And so the members have given us that that

648
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:53,120
insurance policy that we don't even have to be worrying about that right now. And I don't know

649
00:56:53,120 --> 00:56:57,440
how bad things are going to get, but right now we're getting by thanks to our members and,

650
00:56:57,440 --> 00:57:01,840
and also the support from the boosts and other people. It's just, it's just great. It really is.

651
00:57:01,840 --> 00:57:04,960
Yeah. All around. It's great. It's super great. So thanks to everyone.

652
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:11,360
Cdubs boosted in with 10,101 sats, which is a binary boost. I'm thinking,

653
00:57:12,320 --> 00:57:18,000
and we don't have a binary boost. Yeah. I think that's Morse code. I don't know if that's

654
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:23,120
binary. What's the difference? Yeah, I guess. Yeah. Um, but we need a binary soundbite, maybe

655
00:57:23,120 --> 00:57:27,520
something from the Binars episode of TNG, but in the meantime, uh, Cdubs, you get a hard drive.

656
00:57:32,800 --> 00:57:37,280
Cdubs also sent this in either using blue CLI or something based around it,

657
00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:43,440
which is super geeky. He says, Bitcoin is not crypto. I sent this from my own note using a

658
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:47,680
program. I wrote myself using the hardest money ever. Well, that is impressive.

659
00:57:47,680 --> 00:57:52,800
That's the other thing, right? It's a monetary network. It is both a store of value and a way

660
00:57:52,800 --> 00:57:58,080
to it. It is also the remittance and payment network and it's all open source and free and

661
00:57:58,080 --> 00:58:02,720
you can build stuff on top of it just like you can free software and Linux. It is so cool. He says,

662
00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:07,120
I love the fact that there's no visa or PayPal that is selling my purchase history to the highest

663
00:58:07,120 --> 00:58:12,960
bidder. There's no authoritarian that can just say who I can or cannot receive funds or send funds

664
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:18,000
to. And there's no fed diluting the supply. Let's go Bitcoin and let's go podcasting.

665
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:25,680
Thank you, Cdubs. Also a big thank you to Gene Bean who sent some LeetSats to say

666
00:58:25,680 --> 00:58:32,160
plus one on the member chat channel ideas. Wooden501 sent in 3.5 thousand sats to say,

667
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:35,920
hey, uh, don't let the cheap boost die. Well, don't worry. We have a plan, Wooden. Tell us

668
00:58:35,920 --> 00:58:40,720
what you think about the top four. And Trevdev sent in 2.5 thousand sats to say that the boosts

669
00:58:40,720 --> 00:58:45,120
are his favorite way to send feedback. And we got more boosts as well. We just couldn't get to all

670
00:58:45,120 --> 00:58:49,760
of them in the show, but we did try to consolidate the ones that had sort of a shared message and we

671
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:54,000
one hundred percent read all of them. Thank you, everybody. If you'd like to send a boost into the

672
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:58,960
show, go to new podcast apps dot com. You can grab a new podcast app there or maybe you don't want

673
00:58:58,960 --> 00:59:02,800
to switch apps. I know like a lot of you is out there. He loves your antenna pod. Well, guess what?

674
00:59:02,800 --> 00:59:07,680
There's Breeze, B-R-E-E-Z dot technology or boost CLI. All of it's listed over at

675
00:59:07,680 --> 00:59:12,720
new podcast apps dot com. That's all you got to do. Grab that. Get yourself going. Don't forget,

676
00:59:12,720 --> 00:59:16,800
we also have the matrix room to participate there. And then last but not least, the thing that you

677
00:59:16,800 --> 00:59:20,720
always got to check out is that Web page where we got the links, the subscribe feed and the contact

678
00:59:20,720 --> 00:59:25,200
form and office hours dot hair. And then Brantley, why don't you give them one good solid plug for

679
00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:28,640
the new website? And then I think we're out of here. Yeah, I'm going to do a plug for Podverse.

680
00:59:28,640 --> 00:59:34,000
I think their embedded player on the on the website has been amazing and you can do some

681
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:37,920
cool stuff with that thing like chapter support is right there on the Web page, which is awesome.

682
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:42,640
So if you want to check that out, go to new dot Jupiter broadcasting dot com. Give it a try.

683
00:59:42,640 --> 00:59:48,000
Try to break it and we'll fix it hopefully before launch. Now is the time to dog food. So let us

684
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:51,760
know what you think. And with that, we're all done. Thank you, everybody, for joining us on

685
00:59:51,760 --> 00:59:56,720
this week's office hours. And that's it. You got to get out of here. I need this room back.

686
00:59:56,720 --> 01:00:03,520
The office hours are closed.
