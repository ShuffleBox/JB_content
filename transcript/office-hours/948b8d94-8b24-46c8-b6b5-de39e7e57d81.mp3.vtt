WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.580
You'd think the episodes where we're together in person would be the ones where we really

00:03.580 --> 00:04.580
have our crap together.

00:04.580 --> 00:07.920
Give me another three minutes and I think we might be better.

00:07.920 --> 00:08.920
Three minutes?

00:08.920 --> 00:09.920
No way.

00:09.920 --> 00:10.920
We gotta start right now.

00:10.920 --> 00:11.920
We can't wait three minutes.

00:11.920 --> 00:16.160
Let me just move some things here.

00:16.160 --> 00:22.360
It's Office Hours with me, Chris.

00:22.360 --> 00:23.360
Come on in everybody.

00:23.360 --> 00:30.040
It's a special Office Hours because we are down in Roasty Toasty Pasadena, California,

00:30.040 --> 00:35.960
about to go tour JPL and my two good buddies are joining me right here live in the office.

00:35.960 --> 00:36.960
Hello, Brent.

00:36.960 --> 00:37.960
Hello, Wes.

00:37.960 --> 00:38.960
Well, hello.

00:38.960 --> 00:39.960
Hello, handsome.

00:39.960 --> 00:42.200
Nice to have you both here with me.

00:42.200 --> 00:43.960
Nice to have you joining us, Wes.

00:43.960 --> 00:44.960
It's been a minute.

00:44.960 --> 00:48.280
Yes, it has, but I can't think of a better place to be right now.

00:48.280 --> 00:50.580
It's been a crazy few days.

00:50.580 --> 00:55.240
Since we officed together, we've driven through three states.

00:55.240 --> 00:58.860
We've met many listeners.

00:58.860 --> 01:00.480
We've lit a barbecue on fire.

01:00.480 --> 01:02.480
We've done a lot.

01:02.480 --> 01:03.480
Accidentally.

01:03.480 --> 01:04.480
Yeah.

01:04.480 --> 01:05.480
I mean, accidentally.

01:05.480 --> 01:06.480
We'll get to all of that.

01:06.480 --> 01:09.520
But I'm feeling like it's time to catch up with the audience and tell everybody what's

01:09.520 --> 01:11.140
been going on for a little bit.

01:11.140 --> 01:15.080
We have so many stories to share, and even though Brent isn't ready to do the show yet-

01:15.080 --> 01:16.360
Not quite, but I'm getting there.

01:16.360 --> 01:20.520
I mean, I feel like we just proceed without him, you know, until he's ready because he's

01:20.520 --> 01:24.280
you know, I feel like since we're all together, I can just, I can watch him and I can see

01:24.280 --> 01:25.280
what he's ready.

01:25.280 --> 01:27.080
You might have to run a bit, but you can catch up.

01:27.080 --> 01:28.080
Yeah.

01:28.080 --> 01:30.160
I won't say why he's so tired, but I think there's a reason.

01:30.160 --> 01:32.920
Now, I thought maybe we'd tell a little bit of the story of getting down here.

01:32.920 --> 01:34.200
Yeah, I took the easy way.

01:34.200 --> 01:35.200
I just flew down here.

01:35.200 --> 01:36.200
But you too.

01:36.200 --> 01:38.160
I mean, yeah, you've been venturing.

01:38.160 --> 01:44.800
I had, I had the worst, worst stress and anxiety getting ready to go.

01:44.800 --> 01:46.280
Were you feeling this too, Brent?

01:46.280 --> 01:51.360
Oh, easily, because we, we tried to squeeze in a ton of projects at the studio as well.

01:51.360 --> 01:55.600
And but when it came time to, I think we were both extremely stressed.

01:55.600 --> 01:57.760
Well, you got that server AC bill?

01:57.760 --> 02:01.800
No, I think maybe that'll be on the other end of the trip.

02:01.800 --> 02:02.800
We'll see.

02:02.800 --> 02:07.360
The thing was, like, we knew we had to- Monday morning, we were going to leave, and we wanted

02:07.360 --> 02:10.620
to do, we wanted to do in like, like a pro move, right?

02:10.620 --> 02:15.440
And that was try to bypass Seattle, Tacoma, and Portland traffic.

02:15.440 --> 02:19.240
And to do that, you have to leave our area at a very specific time, because you got to

02:19.240 --> 02:22.240
hit the gas station, and you got to hit Seattle at this time, you got to hit Tacoma at this

02:22.240 --> 02:24.560
time, Portland just at this time.

02:24.560 --> 02:31.200
And that meant that we needed to leave no later than 11am Pacific time.

02:31.200 --> 02:32.520
You have this all calculated out.

02:32.520 --> 02:35.720
Yeah, but that's after having recorded a show for you, right, Chris?

02:35.720 --> 02:36.720
Right.

02:36.720 --> 02:39.300
Well, so Sunday, we did two LUPs, we did a five hour live stream.

02:39.300 --> 02:42.080
And then Monday morning, I did a really early coder.

02:42.080 --> 02:46.480
And I was trying to get everything done, figuring, well, if I get coder complete, we can race

02:46.480 --> 02:51.200
up to the to the RV, we can load up and we can head out by 11am.

02:51.200 --> 02:56.960
And well, let's just say 12 hours later than I thought we would leave, Brent and I were

02:56.960 --> 02:58.640
still working on projects.

02:58.640 --> 03:06.840
Well, it's about 12 hours after when I thought we'd be leaving and the sun is mostly set.

03:06.840 --> 03:08.640
Brent's working on more projects.

03:08.640 --> 03:11.920
Hey, what are you working on down there?

03:11.920 --> 03:17.320
Well, there's like a little skirt that's under the engine and it's falling a little bit.

03:17.320 --> 03:21.640
We think it might be a little problematic and kind of worried about maybe in our like

03:21.640 --> 03:22.640
fuel efficiency.

03:22.640 --> 03:23.640
Yeah.

03:23.640 --> 03:26.360
And you hate for it to get caught while we're driving.

03:26.360 --> 03:28.600
So it also has reduced our clearance.

03:28.600 --> 03:29.600
So there's that.

03:29.600 --> 03:30.600
Yeah.

03:30.600 --> 03:33.400
But mostly I want to see what kind of miles per gallon we can get out of this thing.

03:33.400 --> 03:34.400
Yeah.

03:34.400 --> 03:40.200
Last time we did, what, 46 or something incredible 46 miles per gallon on a Ford Focus, a 2013

03:40.200 --> 03:42.520
Ford Focus, like one hundred and thirty five thousand miles on it.

03:42.520 --> 03:45.200
Yeah, we did all right.

03:45.200 --> 03:46.840
But we're still here.

03:46.840 --> 03:52.920
So then out, I guess the plan is we're just going to get up really early in the morning

03:52.920 --> 03:56.200
and head out at about 4am.

03:56.200 --> 03:57.240
And we did.

03:57.240 --> 03:59.600
We actually did very well, I think.

03:59.600 --> 04:00.800
We got everything ready to go.

04:00.800 --> 04:07.320
We even unplugged jupes from shore power, brought the slides in and just were basically

04:07.320 --> 04:09.780
turn the key and go.

04:09.780 --> 04:13.800
And it was one of those situations where we had done a lot of thinking about preparing

04:13.800 --> 04:17.380
the RV for the road trip, but we haven't done a lot of thinking about preparing the chase

04:17.380 --> 04:20.840
car that we're driving around that we drove down here to Pasadena.

04:20.840 --> 04:21.840
Yeah, right.

04:21.840 --> 04:22.840
You didn't drive one vehicle.

04:22.840 --> 04:23.840
You took two vehicles.

04:23.840 --> 04:24.840
Right.

04:24.840 --> 04:25.840
This way.

04:25.840 --> 04:26.840
Did we ever do that oil change that we were thinking about?

04:26.840 --> 04:27.840
Nope.

04:27.840 --> 04:28.840
Oh, no.

04:28.840 --> 04:29.840
That's how the whole that.

04:29.840 --> 04:32.760
So that's how this all started is we were going to do an oil change and then we discovered

04:32.760 --> 04:38.380
that Ford puts it like a skirt underneath the Focus and it's completely sealed up underneath.

04:38.380 --> 04:42.080
And then we discovered that it was sagging and potentially dragging and we needed to

04:42.080 --> 04:43.080
fix that.

04:43.080 --> 04:45.480
It's almost like whoever put it on last and put it on right.

04:45.480 --> 04:46.920
I really struggled to get in place.

04:46.920 --> 04:47.920
Thankfully, we did.

04:47.920 --> 04:50.120
Do you remember I also had to fill the oil?

04:50.120 --> 04:51.120
Yeah.

04:51.120 --> 04:52.120
Yeah.

04:52.120 --> 04:53.520
The oil was a little low and then we almost overfilled it.

04:53.520 --> 04:55.000
No, no, I think.

04:55.000 --> 04:56.000
Yeah.

04:56.000 --> 05:01.720
For about 10 minutes, we knew that I did overfill it and that's how it brought us to me being

05:01.720 --> 05:02.720
under the car.

05:02.720 --> 05:03.720
Yeah.

05:03.720 --> 05:04.720
It was it was a process.

05:04.720 --> 05:05.720
And that was into the dark.

05:05.720 --> 05:06.720
Right.

05:06.720 --> 05:07.720
That was late at night.

05:07.720 --> 05:08.720
We had to do that to ourselves.

05:08.720 --> 05:10.600
But it also included like harvesting the garden.

05:10.600 --> 05:14.080
So we had fruits and veggies for not for snacks for the road.

05:14.080 --> 05:15.080
We had snacks.

05:15.080 --> 05:16.080
Yeah.

05:16.080 --> 05:19.400
Yeah, I will say that time, Chris, had we left at 11, we would have not been ready and

05:19.400 --> 05:20.400
we would have been stressed.

05:20.400 --> 05:24.900
I think the whole trip because we would not have had the things we needed.

05:24.900 --> 05:27.040
There was just stuff we had to do.

05:27.040 --> 05:28.800
And I was just refusing to accept it.

05:28.800 --> 05:32.360
But the inevitability of it just was just inescapable.

05:32.360 --> 05:33.360
One, of course.

05:33.360 --> 05:36.040
I mean, you always have a target to leave, right?

05:36.040 --> 05:39.880
But you had like an actual in an actual event to be headed towards that you couldn't put

05:39.880 --> 05:40.880
off.

05:40.880 --> 05:42.340
That's just it that we had a deadline.

05:42.340 --> 05:47.120
We had a meetup the next day, which turned out to be the day we left.

05:47.120 --> 05:48.120
Right.

05:48.120 --> 05:49.680
So we knew we had to leave early because we had to make it down.

05:49.680 --> 05:52.400
They're still trying to miss all the traffic, which we did.

05:52.400 --> 05:56.400
But then we had to get to Grants Pass for our meetup there at Grants Pass.

05:56.400 --> 06:01.740
And we got to our campsite about 45 minutes before the meetup started away.

06:01.740 --> 06:05.280
It wasn't a huge meetup, but it was it was a really great meetup.

06:05.280 --> 06:08.880
We had a good little group there and we had room for extra people to sit down and join

06:08.880 --> 06:12.600
us and geek out with us.

06:12.600 --> 06:18.480
We chatted things about like a wireless wisps in the area and ISP, you know, politics for

06:18.480 --> 06:21.200
that location and just the I.T. marketing grants pass.

06:21.200 --> 06:24.360
Yeah, we had David with us and he was really great.

06:24.360 --> 06:26.240
He's going to join us at JPL as well.

06:26.240 --> 06:27.240
Yeah.

06:27.240 --> 06:28.240
That's awesome.

06:28.240 --> 06:30.720
Do you remember Devin and Juniper joined us?

06:30.720 --> 06:31.720
Yeah.

06:31.720 --> 06:34.800
And then also his mom and friends and his mom's sister.

06:34.800 --> 06:38.440
Oh, if I was 60 years older, I would have been I would have been interested in.

06:38.440 --> 06:39.880
She was a lot of fun.

06:39.880 --> 06:40.880
It was great.

06:40.880 --> 06:44.280
In fact, the whole family and they were RVers, too.

06:44.280 --> 06:47.720
So I you know, I got to geek out about, you know, the different RV knowledge we have about

06:47.720 --> 06:48.720
the local area.

06:48.720 --> 06:49.720
There's some about these meetups.

06:49.720 --> 06:53.160
I mean, just kindred spirits, whether they use Linux or not.

06:53.160 --> 06:54.160
Yeah, that's what I noticed.

06:54.160 --> 06:56.880
Definitely is like we were totally done for that day.

06:56.880 --> 06:59.240
I mean, we traveled with like eight hours or something like that.

06:59.240 --> 07:00.920
They're still gentle and they're easy.

07:00.920 --> 07:01.920
Yeah.

07:01.920 --> 07:04.000
But also it was like they're just friends of ours.

07:04.000 --> 07:05.000
Okay.

07:05.000 --> 07:06.000
Friends we've never met before.

07:06.000 --> 07:07.000
But the conversation is easy.

07:07.000 --> 07:08.000
Yeah.

07:08.000 --> 07:09.000
You just jump into it.

07:09.000 --> 07:10.000
It's very, very, very smooth.

07:10.000 --> 07:14.000
So that's your that's your Grant's Pass review, handsy, but real smooth and easy.

07:14.000 --> 07:15.000
Yeah.

07:15.000 --> 07:16.480
And we really didn't get much time.

07:16.480 --> 07:21.480
In fact, I worked almost the entire time in Grant's Pass with the exception of the meetup.

07:21.480 --> 07:24.720
And this has happened on the last year's road tour, too, with the exception of the meetup.

07:24.720 --> 07:25.720
I never even left the campground.

07:25.720 --> 07:26.720
Yeah.

07:26.720 --> 07:27.720
We said we wouldn't do this again.

07:27.720 --> 07:28.720
I know.

07:28.720 --> 07:36.640
And then Brent went off for what looked like a lovely hike, I think, and I'm sitting there

07:36.640 --> 07:43.760
stuck in the damn RV the entire time.

07:43.760 --> 07:44.760
I think he's guilty.

07:44.760 --> 07:45.760
He feels guilty about it.

07:45.760 --> 07:46.760
I do really feel guilty.

07:46.760 --> 07:47.760
It was wonderful.

07:47.760 --> 07:50.120
I even like crossed a small river without my shoes on.

07:50.120 --> 07:51.120
With Levi, right?

07:51.120 --> 07:52.400
Oh, Levi was so cute.

07:52.400 --> 07:55.920
But I do happen to know one of your goals here was to, you know, show Brent some of

07:55.920 --> 07:58.400
the wonderful areas you take yourself to.

07:58.400 --> 08:00.680
No, it's the Burt Hedea gets to do it as well.

08:00.680 --> 08:03.760
You know, and she gets to tell me about all the cool places she explored while I recorded.

08:03.760 --> 08:04.760
And that's fine.

08:04.760 --> 08:06.640
And someone has to walk the dog.

08:06.640 --> 08:07.800
Somebody's got to do the podcasting.

08:07.800 --> 08:08.800
Somebody's got to walk the dog.

08:08.800 --> 08:10.320
It's just the way things went.

08:10.320 --> 08:11.320
If it helps.

08:11.320 --> 08:13.960
We also did drop a geocache while we were out.

08:13.960 --> 08:14.960
Yeah.

08:14.960 --> 08:15.960
Yeah.

08:15.960 --> 08:16.960
So we should tell people about that.

08:16.960 --> 08:19.600
There's a geocache for people to find in Grant's Pass, or at least that area.

08:19.600 --> 08:20.600
There is.

08:20.600 --> 08:21.600
And I, you know, it's a funny thing.

08:21.600 --> 08:22.860
I don't want to give too much away.

08:22.860 --> 08:25.680
But at the same time, I actually think it might be really difficult to find.

08:25.680 --> 08:26.680
Yeah.

08:26.680 --> 08:27.680
And I should make it clear.

08:27.680 --> 08:30.200
It's north or so of Grant's Pass on the on the freeway.

08:30.200 --> 08:31.200
Yeah, it is.

08:31.200 --> 08:34.000
It's actually in a place called Canyonville.

08:34.000 --> 08:39.760
And I think Cow Creek might actually be a bit more of an accurate description.

08:39.760 --> 08:44.240
We do have GPS coordinates that we'll share in the show notes.

08:44.240 --> 08:51.480
And there's a hilarious photo of me standing on this giant pile of rocks at a small.

08:51.480 --> 08:52.480
What do you call those, Chris?

08:52.480 --> 08:53.480
A rest stop?

08:53.480 --> 08:56.640
Yeah, I think it's a rest stop is a good description of it.

08:56.640 --> 09:02.320
And there's a massive pile of boulders somewhere and it flanks this rest stop.

09:02.320 --> 09:04.800
Unfortunately, yeah, I think it's in there somewhere.

09:04.800 --> 09:12.040
We made it fairly, it's fairly visible for being hidden under a bunch of large boulders.

09:12.040 --> 09:16.720
But I think we underestimated how accurate the GPS might be on a phone.

09:16.720 --> 09:19.760
Yeah, we'll see if you find it, though.

09:19.760 --> 09:22.720
What would be lovely because we're going to be dropping these throughout the trip.

09:22.720 --> 09:27.800
What would be lovely is just take a few photos of you, even just searching for it.

09:27.800 --> 09:32.080
If you find it, do a little video or something, maybe some audio, send it our way.

09:32.080 --> 09:35.480
And you can either keep there's a whole bunch of crazy awesome stuff in there.

09:35.480 --> 09:37.680
We put a bunch of very fun things.

09:37.680 --> 09:40.320
I won't spoil too much of it because you got to try to find it.

09:40.320 --> 09:44.320
But you can take the stuff, you can replace it with new stuff for someone else to find.

09:44.320 --> 09:45.480
Up to you.

09:45.480 --> 09:48.560
But we'd love to get a few photos and videos of that.

09:48.560 --> 09:49.560
Yeah.

09:49.560 --> 09:52.080
Yeah, that's I'm really looking forward to that as we go about.

09:52.080 --> 09:55.640
And we did we did deploy one in the area.

09:55.640 --> 10:01.520
And then we eventually packed up and we did a long drive to Sacramento.

10:01.520 --> 10:08.160
Oh, man, like almost eight hours of driving, tons and tons of miles, lots of traffic.

10:08.160 --> 10:13.080
And we got right to hide another geocache in the Sacramento area, too.

10:13.080 --> 10:14.360
It's the second geocache.

10:14.360 --> 10:17.240
It's been successfully tucked away in a place.

10:17.240 --> 10:19.920
Let's see how it hints.

10:19.920 --> 10:21.200
Water nearby.

10:21.200 --> 10:26.060
There's a bridge nearby and an old power plant nearby.

10:26.060 --> 10:32.760
And sometimes when the forest burns, you can plant a secret geocache and something beautiful

10:32.760 --> 10:34.560
will grow.

10:34.560 --> 10:35.560
That's the hint.

10:35.560 --> 10:42.520
And of course, it's in Sacramento by an old power plant by the water, perhaps in Folsom.

10:42.520 --> 10:45.920
But those are all the hints I'm giving.

10:45.920 --> 10:47.040
And it's in a Tupperware container.

10:47.040 --> 10:49.240
But that's the last hint.

10:49.240 --> 10:50.240
And there is a shirt in there.

10:50.240 --> 10:54.800
But that's not really a hint that there's this old hydro plant.

10:54.800 --> 10:57.440
If you're a local, you might know what we're talking about.

10:57.440 --> 10:58.640
And that's a that's your hint.

10:58.640 --> 11:00.720
You go there and there's a little park area.

11:00.720 --> 11:02.260
They also get free tours.

11:02.260 --> 11:03.260
Really amazing.

11:03.260 --> 11:04.260
Yeah.

11:04.260 --> 11:05.260
Historical experience.

11:05.260 --> 11:06.260
Really, really cool.

11:06.260 --> 11:07.260
Yeah.

11:07.260 --> 11:08.260
We have more geocaches to deploy.

11:08.260 --> 11:11.120
So keep your ears out for where those are going to be at.

11:11.120 --> 11:12.680
Not everything went smooth.

11:12.680 --> 11:16.000
You know, we had a bit of a gear failure at our Sacramento meetup.

11:16.000 --> 11:18.920
Oh, really good meetup at a place called.

11:18.920 --> 11:20.440
Oh, I know we have the name of it.

11:20.440 --> 11:22.520
We should have been mentioning the name of all of them.

11:22.520 --> 11:23.520
Really great brewery.

11:23.520 --> 11:24.520
These are all breweries.

11:24.520 --> 11:26.520
Urban Roots Brewery and Steakhouse.

11:26.520 --> 11:27.520
Smokehouse.

11:27.520 --> 11:28.520
Sorry, I got that wrong.

11:28.520 --> 11:29.520
Smokehouse.

11:29.520 --> 11:31.680
Actual decent brisket.

11:31.680 --> 11:33.720
Decent barbecue.

11:33.720 --> 11:35.800
We just didn't have decent gear.

11:35.800 --> 11:36.800
Live meetup report.

11:36.800 --> 11:39.400
Brent is trying to fix our audio recorder.

11:39.400 --> 11:40.400
So I just busted out the phone.

11:40.400 --> 11:41.400
This works.

11:41.400 --> 11:42.400
This thing works really nice.

11:42.400 --> 11:43.400
Look at that.

11:43.400 --> 11:44.400
You got a graph.

11:44.400 --> 11:45.400
I know.

11:45.400 --> 11:46.400
Real time visuals, dude.

11:46.400 --> 11:47.400
It's incredible.

11:47.400 --> 11:48.400
Good meetup, though.

11:48.400 --> 11:52.480
Good food, but bad recording equipment.

11:52.480 --> 11:53.480
We got new gear.

11:53.480 --> 11:54.480
We should have set it up before we got here.

11:54.480 --> 11:55.480
Yeah, it's true.

11:55.480 --> 11:56.480
I had to set the date.

11:56.480 --> 11:57.480
It was really embarrassing.

11:57.480 --> 12:00.440
Was it like defaulted to 94 because it's pretty old gear?

12:00.440 --> 12:05.400
It's actually 2014, but if you click up to go like to 2015, 2016, it actually brings

12:05.400 --> 12:06.400
you straight to 2050.

12:06.400 --> 12:07.400
I was like, wait a second.

12:07.400 --> 12:10.080
So you have to click down to bring the date up.

12:10.080 --> 12:11.080
It was really awkward.

12:11.080 --> 12:12.080
Yeah.

12:12.080 --> 12:14.160
I mean, we're not working with the latest and greatest, but it works.

12:14.160 --> 12:15.880
Well, okay, it isn't working.

12:15.880 --> 12:16.880
We'll get there.

12:16.880 --> 12:20.600
The phone works and it has the right time.

12:20.600 --> 12:23.200
Sacramento is a special place because we had the meetup.

12:23.200 --> 12:30.420
We did the geocache, but one of the true legends of this trip is listener Jeff, who put a lot

12:30.420 --> 12:35.100
of effort in to set up a space for us that we could camp at for a few days.

12:35.100 --> 12:41.480
We could do some shows and it was an effort to get JOOPS into his backyard because he's

12:41.480 --> 12:44.600
just living in suburbia in Sacramento.

12:44.600 --> 12:47.880
It's not really like designed for large vehicles.

12:47.880 --> 12:51.720
We worked getting JOOPS in there for about a half hour.

12:51.720 --> 12:52.800
You can hear her in this clip.

12:52.800 --> 12:55.640
She's just working as I slowly back her into the yard.

12:55.640 --> 12:57.520
You were backing up for like a half hour?

12:57.520 --> 12:58.520
Oh yeah.

12:58.520 --> 12:59.760
We were blocking traffic and everything.

12:59.760 --> 13:02.840
We had to like shim the road in certain spot.

13:02.840 --> 13:03.840
It was a whole ordeal.

13:03.840 --> 13:04.840
Yeah.

13:04.840 --> 13:05.840
Brent out with like as a flagger.

13:05.840 --> 13:09.960
He was out moving paver stones with Jeff at like a rapid pace as we're trying to get her

13:09.960 --> 13:14.300
back tires up over the curb, which just a tighter fit than we expected.

13:14.300 --> 13:17.720
We thought we'd clear it and JOOPS did it for a half hour.

13:17.720 --> 13:21.880
She did it as I move forward, move back, move forward, move back and then back her up in

13:21.880 --> 13:22.880
there.

13:22.880 --> 13:30.000
And then there was probably eight inches of clearance of the fence on one side of her.

13:30.000 --> 13:34.980
It was a really, really kind of touch and go thing because we were all sort of frazzled

13:34.980 --> 13:37.360
because we've been driving for seven and a half hours.

13:37.360 --> 13:38.840
None of your sharpest.

13:38.840 --> 13:42.520
And the last bit of it was right before the Sacramento airport where traffic got real

13:42.520 --> 13:43.520
thick.

13:43.520 --> 13:45.720
And the last bit of it was intense driving, too.

13:45.720 --> 13:51.720
So we were fried and it had just been really kind of a real hectic situation to block traffic

13:51.720 --> 13:52.720
is super stressful.

13:52.720 --> 13:54.480
Why do we do this to ourselves?

13:54.480 --> 13:55.480
I don't know.

13:55.480 --> 13:56.480
I don't know.

13:56.480 --> 13:57.480
How's the exit going to be?

13:57.480 --> 14:00.480
Well, we're going to report back.

14:00.480 --> 14:05.400
We will figure that out when we get there because, yeah, we drove a car down to Pasadena,

14:05.400 --> 14:09.560
which was, you know, like another six, seven hours of driving from Sacramento.

14:09.560 --> 14:14.160
And so we left JOOPS all locked up back in Sacramento, which is really one of the, I

14:14.160 --> 14:17.200
think, strategic decisions of this trip.

14:17.200 --> 14:19.160
But we do not know how we're getting out just yet.

14:19.160 --> 14:23.600
We're going to take it slow and find out if you can beat that 30 minutes.

14:23.600 --> 14:28.040
So, you know, that's why I think listener Jeff, who has been a true legend and he's

14:28.040 --> 14:32.380
joined us on this trip, I think that's why he's found this a little more relaxing than

14:32.380 --> 14:33.380
we have so far.

14:33.380 --> 14:37.600
A lot more relaxing than I expected, actually thought that I was going to be stressed out

14:37.600 --> 14:41.520
and worn down, but you guys have basically done all my cooking and all my cleaning for

14:41.520 --> 14:42.520
me.

14:42.520 --> 14:43.520
So can't really complain.

14:43.520 --> 14:45.320
Isn't that nice?

14:45.320 --> 14:50.360
Now, you did a whole bunch of solar stuff on your house.

14:50.360 --> 14:54.040
It seems like you're an expert at some of this stuff.

14:54.040 --> 15:00.520
You did put in some electrical stuff at the barn where the RV usually is.

15:00.520 --> 15:01.520
That was many years ago.

15:01.520 --> 15:04.720
Tell us a little bit about that.

15:04.720 --> 15:11.720
So that was me randomly reaching out to Chris from an old, what was that user error episode

15:11.720 --> 15:16.600
about him complaining about popping his 15 amp breaker from electric heaters.

15:16.600 --> 15:19.400
So I just sent him a message and said, this is something I know how to do.

15:19.400 --> 15:21.360
Would you like me to come up and do it?

15:21.360 --> 15:22.680
He said, yes.

15:22.680 --> 15:24.040
So I did.

15:24.040 --> 15:30.280
And we threw up a 50 amp receptacle for his RV, put the breaker in, did the pipe, all

15:30.280 --> 15:31.280
that.

15:31.280 --> 15:34.880
It took about 45 minutes, something like that, and got it done.

15:34.880 --> 15:35.880
Nice.

15:35.880 --> 15:41.120
So you knew that when we were going to park Lady Joops at your place for several days

15:41.120 --> 15:47.360
recording shows there, and then for several days while we're here in Pasadena, that you

15:47.360 --> 15:49.640
knew kind of what the requirements were going to be.

15:49.640 --> 15:54.840
So what changed at your place in the last few weeks?

15:54.840 --> 15:58.220
So I did the same thing, but I didn't want a permanent installation.

15:58.220 --> 16:04.520
So just recently put up my solar and got that taken care of and needed an inspection done

16:04.520 --> 16:05.600
as well.

16:05.600 --> 16:11.480
So I had to make this temporary, didn't want an extra 50 amp receptacle on my wall.

16:11.480 --> 16:17.280
So I set up a pallet, put the receptacle on said pallet, ran pipe around the corner of

16:17.280 --> 16:21.880
the wall, then tied that into my main panel.

16:21.880 --> 16:26.880
Pipe just kind of goes in to the panel, taped up nice and safe.

16:26.880 --> 16:29.080
Everything's wired up properly though and on the correct breaker.

16:29.080 --> 16:31.920
So legitimately is actually safe.

16:31.920 --> 16:36.920
But that's a temporary installation of a 50 amp RV plug.

16:36.920 --> 16:41.920
From what I can tell, and I've done a few Renaults, it's the nicest sort of last minute

16:41.920 --> 16:44.280
MacGyver job I've ever seen.

16:44.280 --> 16:46.940
So kudos to you.

16:46.940 --> 16:50.920
And you did a little bit of work on the RV as well when we were there, didn't you?

16:50.920 --> 16:51.920
Yeah.

16:51.920 --> 16:59.640
So I tied into the water pumps power, put a Y splitter on there with XT60 connectors

16:59.640 --> 17:02.800
so that they can plug in their, what do they call it?

17:02.800 --> 17:05.920
The, what do they call that thing?

17:05.920 --> 17:08.040
The poop grinder?

17:08.040 --> 17:13.160
I think it's the macerator, the poop blender.

17:13.160 --> 17:14.440
That's what they call it.

17:14.440 --> 17:21.120
So they can plug in their poop blender separately and let that thing chew away and do its job.

17:21.120 --> 17:24.600
So no more secondary battery and alligator clips.

17:24.600 --> 17:25.760
Sweet.

17:25.760 --> 17:30.680
And actually it's, it's been remarkable to see Lady Joob's right beside your house.

17:30.680 --> 17:34.480
Your house is great, but Lady Joob's kind of towers over it in a kind of way.

17:34.480 --> 17:35.480
Do you find that kind of funny?

17:35.480 --> 17:36.480
Yeah.

17:36.480 --> 17:40.160
I think it actually shades the Southeast panels on my house.

17:40.160 --> 17:42.160
It's so damn big.

17:42.160 --> 17:43.880
It's wonderful though.

17:43.880 --> 17:45.360
It really is a sight to behold.

17:45.360 --> 17:49.960
Well, I got to say it's been great to have you on this trip and for us to stay at your

17:49.960 --> 17:50.960
place.

17:50.960 --> 17:52.640
But we're only like partway into the trip.

17:52.640 --> 17:56.200
So I'm looking forward to hanging out some more and going to JPL together.

17:56.200 --> 17:58.280
It's going to be a lot of fun.

17:58.280 --> 17:59.280
That's about it.

17:59.280 --> 18:00.280
Tons of fun.

18:00.280 --> 18:02.840
You know what he didn't mention, but was super useful?

18:02.840 --> 18:05.000
He also ran out an ethernet cable out for us.

18:05.000 --> 18:06.000
Oh yeah.

18:06.000 --> 18:09.800
So Joob's has ethernet internet, which made doing the shows a lot better.

18:09.800 --> 18:11.920
It was really great.

18:11.920 --> 18:12.920
And she's sitting there.

18:12.920 --> 18:14.320
It's 90 degrees out.

18:14.320 --> 18:15.520
She's nice and comfortable.

18:15.520 --> 18:16.520
You know?

18:16.520 --> 18:17.520
So great.

18:17.520 --> 18:21.280
And so now we're hanging out here, we're in our makeshift recording room, which is the

18:21.280 --> 18:25.960
dining room and describe the room, Chris, would you?

18:25.960 --> 18:30.140
You know, like, um, if you, have you ever seen a picture of somebody who's a hoarder

18:30.140 --> 18:34.820
and they've like, they're like really mentally ill and like you, you realize they've been

18:34.820 --> 18:36.760
hoarding for like 20 years and nobody knew about it.

18:36.760 --> 18:39.800
And like every room of their house, it's just piled full of stuff.

18:39.800 --> 18:41.280
Can you know that?

18:41.280 --> 18:42.280
Yeah.

18:42.280 --> 18:43.460
That's what this room looks like.

18:43.460 --> 18:47.480
We've taken all of the beds from, there's no, there are no servers.

18:47.480 --> 18:52.840
We've taken all of the mattresses and all of the blankets and all of the pillows.

18:52.840 --> 18:57.080
And for some reason, this Airbnb had a lot of extra pillows.

18:57.080 --> 18:58.080
Helpful.

18:58.080 --> 19:00.080
We'll have to note that in the review.

19:00.080 --> 19:01.080
Yeah.

19:01.080 --> 19:02.080
Yeah.

19:02.080 --> 19:03.080
I would say, I mean, I'm not even exaggerating.

19:03.080 --> 19:05.680
I'd say probably 30 more pillows than you need.

19:05.680 --> 19:06.680
No dish soap.

19:06.680 --> 19:07.680
Plenty of pillows.

19:07.680 --> 19:08.680
No dish soap.

19:08.680 --> 19:09.680
No can opener.

19:09.680 --> 19:10.680
Nope.

19:10.680 --> 19:11.680
Nope.

19:11.680 --> 19:12.680
Nope.

19:12.680 --> 19:14.160
Um, and so we brought all of it into the room.

19:14.160 --> 19:15.580
In fact, we're recording late tonight.

19:15.580 --> 19:18.440
So nobody can go to bed until we're done recording.

19:18.440 --> 19:19.440
Sorry everybody.

19:19.440 --> 19:22.880
Well, except a little Levi who's taking a nap on one of the blankets.

19:22.880 --> 19:23.880
Yeah.

19:23.880 --> 19:24.880
We have Levi here.

19:24.880 --> 19:25.880
He's, he's curled up.

19:25.880 --> 19:26.880
He thinks this is great.

19:26.880 --> 19:27.880
I'm sure.

19:27.880 --> 19:31.600
And it, you know, it's not even perfect, but we made something out of it.

19:31.600 --> 19:36.200
And the thing that is nice is it has a great kitchen area and has a great outdoor cooking

19:36.200 --> 19:37.680
area.

19:37.680 --> 19:41.220
And so we decided to do something really kind of special because part of what made this road

19:41.220 --> 19:48.080
trip possible is our audience contributing some sats to Brent's, uh, petrol fund.

19:48.080 --> 19:49.080
Is that what you call it up there in Canada?

19:49.080 --> 19:50.800
I think it was sats gas tank.

19:50.800 --> 19:52.760
Do you, do you call it petrol in Canada?

19:52.760 --> 19:53.760
Oh no, we don't.

19:53.760 --> 19:56.440
It's only our, uh, you know, British cousins.

19:56.440 --> 20:00.820
So we had a, you know, a gas fund to help Brent get down to the studio.

20:00.820 --> 20:06.880
And Brent is a generally safe studious driver.

20:06.880 --> 20:11.080
So we had some leftover sats and I think it was Brent's idea.

20:11.080 --> 20:16.640
Let's treat everybody to dinner and let's get some food cranking on that barbecue that

20:16.640 --> 20:18.720
we bought with the sats.

20:18.720 --> 20:20.160
This sucker is cranked.

20:20.160 --> 20:26.520
It's over 600 degrees in there, but that means it should cook Brent's Satoshi squares nice

20:26.520 --> 20:27.520
and quick.

20:27.520 --> 20:31.220
He's made us some nice potatoes all chopped up.

20:31.220 --> 20:33.520
Taters bought with sats boosted in.

20:33.520 --> 20:34.520
Yeah.

20:34.520 --> 20:35.520
That's hot over there.

20:35.520 --> 20:36.520
It's hot, like 600 degrees.

20:36.520 --> 20:37.520
So be careful.

20:37.520 --> 20:38.520
You grew these.

20:38.520 --> 20:39.520
Oh, these are really out of the garden.

20:39.520 --> 20:40.520
These are not Satoshi.

20:40.520 --> 20:41.520
Well, I don't know.

20:41.520 --> 20:42.520
Wait a minute, dude.

20:42.520 --> 20:45.520
Are you saying these are illegal potatoes that we smuggled across state lines?

20:45.520 --> 20:46.520
Oh no.

20:46.520 --> 20:51.080
I think the Satoshi squares would have been better.

20:51.080 --> 20:55.280
Brent was shocked when we stopped at the California border and they, they screen everybody who

20:55.280 --> 20:56.280
crosses the border.

20:56.280 --> 20:59.180
This is something that doesn't happen in most states, but it happens in California.

20:59.180 --> 21:04.560
Every vehicle has to stop for inspection and the inspection consists of one question.

21:04.560 --> 21:09.720
Do you have any fruits or produce or no, any vegetables or produce on board is what they

21:09.720 --> 21:10.720
do.

21:10.720 --> 21:14.360
And I just think about it for like a half second saying, no, we don't have any, which

21:14.360 --> 21:20.400
was false because we had just harvested the entire garden and then of course they probably

21:20.400 --> 21:22.480
forgot about that and thought we ordered these.

21:22.480 --> 21:25.960
I thought we, I thought we got these and we'll, we'll talk about how here in just a moment.

21:25.960 --> 21:29.000
If you forget your crime, is that really even a crime?

21:29.000 --> 21:30.000
Yeah.

21:30.000 --> 21:31.000
Right.

21:31.000 --> 21:32.000
Exactly.

21:32.000 --> 21:33.000
Exactly.

21:33.000 --> 21:36.680
So maybe the potatoes weren't bought with the sats like I thought they were, but the

21:36.680 --> 21:39.740
steaks, those were definitely bought with the sats.

21:39.740 --> 21:42.000
We had some tasty sat steaks.

21:42.000 --> 21:43.000
All right.

21:43.000 --> 21:45.980
The first sat steak is going on the grill and this one has a sear.

21:45.980 --> 21:46.980
Look at that.

21:46.980 --> 21:47.980
Okay.

21:47.980 --> 21:48.980
Here we go.

21:48.980 --> 21:49.980
You ready?

21:49.980 --> 21:50.980
Yeah.

21:50.980 --> 21:51.980
I'm definitely ready.

21:51.980 --> 21:55.880
You know, the sat steaks, they smell a little better than a regular steak.

21:55.880 --> 21:56.880
They smell like decentralization.

21:56.880 --> 21:57.880
Okay.

21:57.880 --> 21:58.880
Ready?

21:58.880 --> 21:59.880
Yeah.

21:59.880 --> 22:00.880
Give her a flip.

22:00.880 --> 22:04.480
Oh, look at that.

22:04.480 --> 22:07.720
That is great, so that really sears them really well.

22:07.720 --> 22:08.720
That's fantastic.

22:08.720 --> 22:16.160
And then we just finish them up on the regular grill, wait for it.

22:16.160 --> 22:22.840
Like a pro, like a pro, nicely done next sat steak and we'll just move right down the line.

22:22.840 --> 22:27.480
I said next for the vegan of the group, Brent's a pretty dang good meat griller.

22:27.480 --> 22:33.040
I have to say, and this barbecue was cool because it has a dedicated sear grill.

22:33.040 --> 22:37.720
Yeah, I've never seen that before, but that was actually like, as far as purpose built,

22:37.720 --> 22:39.680
it was exactly what we needed.

22:39.680 --> 22:40.680
Yeah.

22:40.680 --> 22:42.200
And the sat states were going great.

22:42.200 --> 22:48.220
They were smelling delicious, Hedia made, you know, a little crisp on the edge.

22:48.220 --> 22:53.000
We had rubbed them down with a Chipotle salt kind of rub, something simple, but tasty,

22:53.000 --> 22:55.400
a little bit of garlic in there too.

22:55.400 --> 23:01.960
And then to kind of top it off, my wife Hedia made a garlic butter that we brushed on there.

23:01.960 --> 23:07.920
However, that seems to have kind of been the straw that broke the camel's back.

23:07.920 --> 23:10.360
It's a bit more, uh, uh, what do you call it?

23:10.360 --> 23:11.360
Grease fire.

23:11.360 --> 23:13.760
The whole grease pan in the barbecue has caught on fire.

23:13.760 --> 23:14.760
It's not, it's not our fault.

23:14.760 --> 23:19.280
I was going to say more volatile than your standard kind of investment strategy.

23:19.280 --> 23:24.440
Yeah, it's, it's performing more like an alt coin right now.

23:24.440 --> 23:26.360
It's quite bad.

23:26.360 --> 23:28.320
It's just burning out of control.

23:28.320 --> 23:31.320
Um, we did rescue the steaks.

23:31.320 --> 23:35.120
So I actually think the steaks are going to be okay if maybe just a little charred around

23:35.120 --> 23:37.840
the edges, but there's no rescuing this barbecue.

23:37.840 --> 23:39.800
How much did you steak?

23:39.800 --> 23:44.000
Brent, I am too hungry for that crap.

23:44.000 --> 23:50.800
You know, the listeners can't see like the actual billowing black smoke that was emanating

23:50.800 --> 23:51.800
here.

23:51.800 --> 23:52.800
Yeah.

23:52.800 --> 23:55.900
I don't think anybody's cleaned out the grease trap in that barbecue in about five years.

23:55.900 --> 23:57.240
There were large flames.

23:57.240 --> 23:59.200
We were worried there for a sec.

23:59.200 --> 24:00.200
Yeah.

24:00.200 --> 24:02.080
We got the, the flames got big enough.

24:02.080 --> 24:06.080
They were like, do we have to worry about the back draft factor when we open this thing

24:06.080 --> 24:07.840
to put it out?

24:07.840 --> 24:09.680
Is that going to be a problem?

24:09.680 --> 24:13.800
We did forget about the, Oh, what did they call those?

24:13.800 --> 24:17.680
Uh, uh, oh, soy, soy Rizzo.

24:17.680 --> 24:18.680
Soy Rizzo.

24:18.680 --> 24:22.680
I got myself some soy Rizzo sausage to, uh, put on the grill as well.

24:22.680 --> 24:27.000
And, uh, somehow we totally forgot about them the entire time we were grilling.

24:27.000 --> 24:30.120
So they got just roasted during that fire.

24:30.120 --> 24:36.080
Well I checked on them a little bit before the fire and they were still fine.

24:36.080 --> 24:41.760
But the fire really billowed up the back of the barbecue and it really got those.

24:41.760 --> 24:46.160
What you're saying is Brent, you know, the fire, it just, it was just right on your food

24:46.160 --> 24:47.160
only.

24:47.160 --> 24:48.160
I don't know how to explain it.

24:48.160 --> 24:52.120
It was some spicy food, greasy, spicy food.

24:52.120 --> 24:56.660
Um, but I, I actually got some camera footage of the grease fire and so I was just looking

24:56.660 --> 25:03.220
at it before we sat down to record and soon as we open the barbecue, um, we'll see what

25:03.220 --> 25:04.220
happens.

25:04.220 --> 25:07.800
We first opened it and we took some stuff off and then we put it back down and then

25:07.800 --> 25:08.960
the fire really went out of control.

25:08.960 --> 25:13.260
And that, that first time it was already gone, it was too late.

25:13.260 --> 25:15.720
We just didn't realize that we were too focused on the potatoes.

25:15.720 --> 25:20.240
Um, the Satoshi squares, which turned out to be not Satoshi squares.

25:20.240 --> 25:23.660
But you know, so we had this opportunity where the audience helped get Brent down here.

25:23.660 --> 25:27.240
We had some extra sats that we thought let's feed everybody because we really had no dinner

25:27.240 --> 25:28.240
plans.

25:28.240 --> 25:29.940
We've been way too busy.

25:29.940 --> 25:36.560
So what we decided to do was use a service slash website called Bit Refill.

25:36.560 --> 25:40.240
This is not a sponsorship or anything, it's just what we did.

25:40.240 --> 25:45.140
And Bit Refills just sends, just sells tons and tons and tons of different digital gift

25:45.140 --> 25:47.840
cards for everything, everything.

25:47.840 --> 25:49.800
I mean, it's crazy.

25:49.800 --> 25:54.640
And obviously they have like grocery stores on there and they have things like Instacart

25:54.640 --> 25:55.800
on there.

25:55.800 --> 25:57.560
And so we went the route of Instacart.

25:57.560 --> 26:02.480
So we use the sats to buy an Instacart gift certificate.

26:02.480 --> 26:08.160
Well, a couple of them actually, then loaded the app with that gift card and made the purchase

26:08.160 --> 26:09.720
like normal.

26:09.720 --> 26:11.100
So it was pretty great.

26:11.100 --> 26:14.960
The only way we could have removed like a lot of step out of there would be if Instacart

26:14.960 --> 26:16.680
just took lightning payments directly.

26:16.680 --> 26:22.120
Yeah, that's the funniest part is like of all the steps in the chain and there's a few,

26:22.120 --> 26:25.320
the actual lightning payment, you know, like once you get the invoice and then you can

26:25.320 --> 26:29.240
fill it out in your app, that's by far the fastest part out of it, of all of the steps.

26:29.240 --> 26:30.240
Yeah.

26:30.240 --> 26:31.240
Yeah.

26:31.240 --> 26:32.240
It's just immediate.

26:32.240 --> 26:33.240
It's so great.

26:33.240 --> 26:34.880
And then you have the gift card instantly, which is really awesome.

26:34.880 --> 26:40.200
The UI on the apps and like loading the gift cards, that always sucks, right?

26:40.200 --> 26:44.000
You gotta get the app or whatever, then their UI to do, it's always weird, but that has

26:44.000 --> 26:46.160
nothing to do with the sats or the lightning.

26:46.160 --> 26:50.120
So thank you for everybody who boosted into office hours and Linux unplugged.

26:50.120 --> 26:52.560
The split that we set up for that gas fund is still in place.

26:52.560 --> 26:57.240
And I mean, we may buy more stakes, but it still has to get home.

26:57.240 --> 26:58.240
Yeah, that's true.

26:58.240 --> 26:59.240
Yeah.

26:59.240 --> 27:02.000
I found it actually really fun to come up with different strategies to how to put these

27:02.000 --> 27:03.000
to use.

27:03.000 --> 27:06.120
So I hope we come up with some, some other, yeah.

27:06.120 --> 27:09.600
One of them is, you know, like we thought like, cause everybody always mentions every

27:09.600 --> 27:11.920
time we talk to people about what we're doing, people always say, well, why don't you just

27:11.920 --> 27:13.560
sell them and get the cash and buy whatever you want.

27:13.560 --> 27:18.040
We're like, well, of course we could just sell them.

27:18.040 --> 27:19.040
That's not as much fun.

27:19.040 --> 27:21.040
That's not the point either, is it?

27:21.040 --> 27:27.360
Well, I want to take a moment and thank Linode for sponsoring this episode of office hours.

27:27.360 --> 27:30.680
Linode.com slash Jupiter.

27:30.680 --> 27:33.720
They're not only sponsoring office hours, but they're making this trip possible.

27:33.720 --> 27:35.820
It gives our team a chance to reconnect.

27:35.820 --> 27:39.480
We can build special content and have these special moments, but it also means we get

27:39.480 --> 27:41.520
to go tour JPL.

27:41.520 --> 27:42.520
And why would Linode do that?

27:42.520 --> 27:43.840
Why do they, what do they get out of it?

27:43.840 --> 27:44.840
Right?

27:44.840 --> 27:47.600
What they get out of it is investment in a community that's going to advocate for them.

27:47.600 --> 27:51.640
They get out of it, long-term planning, long-term investments.

27:51.640 --> 27:55.760
And I think that shows you the kind of thinking that they do about this stuff.

27:55.760 --> 27:57.940
It's something that I really appreciate about them.

27:57.940 --> 27:59.960
And it's really what drew me in as a customer.

27:59.960 --> 28:01.600
And now look where that's gone, right?

28:01.600 --> 28:06.840
I started using Linode over three years ago now, which is crazy.

28:06.840 --> 28:10.160
I know some people been using them for longer than a decade, but I started using them just

28:10.160 --> 28:15.160
over three years ago because I was at Texas Linux Fest and I think it was the second Texas

28:15.160 --> 28:16.320
Linux Fest I'd been to.

28:16.320 --> 28:17.320
I'm not positive.

28:17.320 --> 28:20.760
I can't remember now and it wasn't going good.

28:20.760 --> 28:24.360
They'd moved locations.

28:24.360 --> 28:27.000
Most of the vendors weren't taking it very seriously.

28:27.000 --> 28:32.280
Linode showed up with a great booth, people that are excited to be there.

28:32.280 --> 28:35.440
They win a little above and beyond to make sure the conference could happen.

28:35.440 --> 28:38.560
They spend a little extra to support them.

28:38.560 --> 28:42.200
And I thought, look at them, they're really taking, I could tell Texas Linux Fest had

28:42.200 --> 28:43.200
some serious potential.

28:43.200 --> 28:46.000
I could tell it was one to take seriously.

28:46.000 --> 28:48.440
And I thought, I can see that.

28:48.440 --> 28:49.440
They see it too.

28:49.440 --> 28:50.560
They see it too.

28:50.560 --> 28:53.720
That is a company that actually understands community.

28:53.720 --> 28:55.900
It understands free software development.

28:55.900 --> 28:58.660
It understands what makes Linux tick at the real base level.

28:58.660 --> 28:59.660
And that's why they're here.

28:59.660 --> 29:03.840
And I'm like, next time I build something, I'm going to try it out on the node.

29:03.840 --> 29:06.780
Well, now they're doing it here with us, right?

29:06.780 --> 29:10.600
They're here, they're investing in something that builds community.

29:10.600 --> 29:13.240
And my hope is when you're listening to this, you'll think, well, next time I want to build

29:13.240 --> 29:18.640
something on really great, really fast cloud hosting, I'm going to go to Linode.

29:18.640 --> 29:20.320
You go to linode.com slash Jupiter.

29:20.320 --> 29:26.480
You get $100 in 60 day credit and you support the show, linode.com slash Jupiter.

29:26.480 --> 29:30.680
All right, what's next on our list there, boys?

29:30.680 --> 29:33.520
We talked about our trip so far.

29:33.520 --> 29:35.600
We haven't made it to JPL yet.

29:35.600 --> 29:37.000
Is our meetup tomorrow?

29:37.000 --> 29:38.240
No, JPL is tomorrow.

29:38.240 --> 29:39.240
The meetup is the day after.

29:39.240 --> 29:40.240
There you go.

29:40.240 --> 29:41.240
The same day.

29:41.240 --> 29:43.280
What are we even doing over here?

29:43.280 --> 29:44.280
It's all blurring together.

29:44.280 --> 29:46.560
I guess we better figure that out after this.

29:46.560 --> 29:50.720
But as this is releasing, it's going to be the day of the meetup.

29:50.720 --> 29:51.720
That's true.

29:51.720 --> 29:52.720
Yeah.

29:52.720 --> 29:54.240
So hopefully it went great.

29:54.240 --> 29:56.640
If you're hearing this by the time you're hearing this, hopefully it went, I'm sure

29:56.640 --> 29:57.640
it did.

29:57.640 --> 29:59.120
I'm sure it did.

29:59.120 --> 30:02.440
I'm really looking forward to going to JPL and discovering all of their secrets.

30:02.440 --> 30:04.240
You know what I mean?

30:04.240 --> 30:07.660
You know, that makes me think we do have to drop another geocache around here somewhere.

30:07.660 --> 30:08.660
We should.

30:08.660 --> 30:09.660
Yeah, we should.

30:09.660 --> 30:10.660
We've got to think of something.

30:10.660 --> 30:11.660
Yeah, we should do that tomorrow.

30:11.660 --> 30:12.760
Good thinking.

30:12.760 --> 30:17.240
So between all of this, there's been some pretty solid progress on the new website.

30:17.240 --> 30:20.700
We've recently published the new website that our community built for us, like the heroes

30:20.700 --> 30:21.700
that they are.

30:21.700 --> 30:22.700
Amazing.

30:22.700 --> 30:26.200
An incredible story of value for value and community coming together to create something

30:26.200 --> 30:28.500
way beyond what we could have done on our own.

30:28.500 --> 30:30.360
And it continues, even during the trip.

30:30.360 --> 30:31.960
Yeah, I was actually really worried.

30:31.960 --> 30:36.720
I knew we'd be busy during the trip and I tried to put in, you know, as much work as

30:36.720 --> 30:39.760
I could before leaving to get to the studio.

30:39.760 --> 30:43.760
And that was what, like a week and a half ago, something like that now, has it been

30:43.760 --> 30:44.760
longer?

30:44.760 --> 30:45.760
I don't know anymore.

30:45.760 --> 30:49.200
I think, yeah, a little bit longer, a couple of days longer, I don't know.

30:49.200 --> 30:50.200
It's really a weird thing.

30:50.200 --> 30:53.200
And if you, if you're not going through it, it's hard to like really wrap your head around

30:53.200 --> 30:54.680
it, but everything's blurring together.

30:54.680 --> 30:58.000
It reminds me a little bit of some people will know what this is like is after you have

30:58.000 --> 31:03.880
children, the first few days all blur together after you have your child.

31:03.880 --> 31:05.800
And that's what this road trip has been like.

31:05.800 --> 31:07.560
It's all one long Monday.

31:07.560 --> 31:08.560
Yeah.

31:08.560 --> 31:11.280
And I, I kind of from our other road trips knew this was going to happen.

31:11.280 --> 31:12.360
I know this feeling.

31:12.360 --> 31:13.360
It's a familiar one.

31:13.360 --> 31:14.360
It's also a very fun one.

31:14.360 --> 31:15.360
It is.

31:15.360 --> 31:17.040
And we, it's like we're sprinting basically.

31:17.040 --> 31:18.040
Yeah.

31:18.040 --> 31:19.040
And so amazing things happen.

31:19.040 --> 31:22.200
We get into a bunch of projects and trouble and all sorts of adventures.

31:22.200 --> 31:27.020
And I knew that I wouldn't have the same time to put into the website as I did previously

31:27.020 --> 31:31.160
to do a bit of sort of community engagement and those kinds of things.

31:31.160 --> 31:32.160
But you know what?

31:32.160 --> 31:34.880
You can't approve MRs and drive a car at the same time, Brett.

31:34.880 --> 31:40.360
You know, they tell me that's dangerous, but as a passenger he can, and he did.

31:40.360 --> 31:41.360
It's true.

31:41.360 --> 31:46.120
You know, the new dev one that I, that you, you both so generously got me, allowed me

31:46.120 --> 31:52.120
to work in the car on the way here for like, I think I worked five or six hours.

31:52.120 --> 31:53.120
So great.

31:53.120 --> 31:54.120
Yeah.

31:54.120 --> 31:58.520
And then when I got Joupes behind, I drove the Focus and Jeff drove his car down and

31:58.520 --> 32:01.000
Brent rode with Jeff and Hadir rode with me.

32:01.000 --> 32:03.980
So it just sort of worked out really nice because everybody got a, you know, a car buddy

32:03.980 --> 32:05.600
and you got some work time.

32:05.600 --> 32:06.600
Yeah.

32:06.600 --> 32:10.300
It was actually really great and, and nice to become reacquainted with all of the work

32:10.300 --> 32:11.300
that's been happening there.

32:11.300 --> 32:12.880
And I was super blown away.

32:12.880 --> 32:17.040
There's been a ton of stuff happening, Chris, while you and I have just been fooling around

32:17.040 --> 32:18.760
on this trip here.

32:18.760 --> 32:21.360
I think there are two things that stand out for me.

32:21.360 --> 32:28.040
First is that we have a brand new 404 page that, uh, I think hearkens to the old website

32:28.040 --> 32:31.240
and an homage, if you will, an homage is a nice way to put it.

32:31.240 --> 32:34.320
So it's the only, it's like the one good thing about the old website.

32:34.320 --> 32:40.680
So you know, we took that and scrapped the rest, the 404 page, the fricking 404 page.

32:40.680 --> 32:45.200
So thank you to CJ bass player for taking that one on and, uh, making it happen.

32:45.200 --> 32:50.240
If you'd like to see it, just go to Jupiter broadcasting.com and then make up the rest.

32:50.240 --> 32:53.200
Yeah, just screw it up and you'll see it.

32:53.200 --> 32:54.760
It is so great.

32:54.760 --> 33:00.280
I'm really glad we preserved that a little bit of whimsy, if you will, you got to have

33:00.280 --> 33:01.280
fun in there somewhere.

33:01.280 --> 33:02.280
Okay.

33:02.280 --> 33:07.800
Now there's a part I've been waiting to, to give them more information about the workflow

33:07.800 --> 33:10.480
that gets rid of the cowboy in the room, which apparently is me.

33:10.480 --> 33:14.440
So tell me about this new workflow that's designed to protect everybody from Chris.

33:14.440 --> 33:17.520
I thought you were a prospector prospector, Chris.

33:17.520 --> 33:18.520
Yeah.

33:18.520 --> 33:21.680
So tell me about get flow and how we're using it to do smarter development.

33:21.680 --> 33:22.680
Yeah.

33:22.680 --> 33:28.640
We've had many discussions about, okay, so up to this point we like cowboys, not just

33:28.640 --> 33:35.840
you, Chris, all of us have just been iterating very quickly on the website and all PRS have

33:35.840 --> 33:41.320
been just kind of modifying our main branch and that's been okay, but I think it's time

33:41.320 --> 33:48.000
that we mature a little bit and maybe protect a few important gems.

33:48.000 --> 33:54.120
So we've been having discussions in our issues and via the matrix room for, Oh, it feels

33:54.120 --> 33:59.240
like a month now on how to address this and what are the best ways to, you know, get some

33:59.240 --> 34:04.080
perhaps live previews of some of the development that's happening without having to publish

34:04.080 --> 34:08.080
to production, which, you know, sounds like actually a really good idea not to screw things

34:08.080 --> 34:09.080
up.

34:09.080 --> 34:16.800
And so I think the one that we've settled on is get flow and Wes, could you help me

34:16.800 --> 34:19.120
wrap my head around what this is doing for us?

34:19.120 --> 34:23.460
I think I've begun to understand it, but it sounds like you've got a little bit more experience

34:23.460 --> 34:24.460
than I do in this one.

34:24.460 --> 34:29.800
Well, I think some of your aim here, right, was to have an environment that you could

34:29.800 --> 34:35.720
merge PRS directly into before having to take that and deploy it to the main website, right?

34:35.720 --> 34:40.360
So you could have a staging environment of some kind where you could merge things together,

34:40.360 --> 34:45.000
integrate multiple different PRS of, you know, the different work, different changes, configuration

34:45.000 --> 34:51.520
kits, new features, evaluate that as a consistent release, you know, and then at periodic times

34:51.520 --> 34:57.520
sort of cut that over and promote that, deploy it to the main branch, put it in production.

34:57.520 --> 35:00.080
Is that the idea that you were kind of going for?

35:00.080 --> 35:01.080
Exactly.

35:01.080 --> 35:02.080
Yeah.

35:02.080 --> 35:05.720
And I think what I'm noticing now is some of the problems that we're tackling on the

35:05.720 --> 35:10.400
website are multifaceted and sometimes many PRS are interacting.

35:10.400 --> 35:13.720
And so if you're just pushing one to main, well, maybe that actually breaks things before

35:13.720 --> 35:15.280
you get to push a few others.

35:15.280 --> 35:22.800
So it sounds like maybe a much nicer way to solve some complex, niggly problems that maybe

35:22.800 --> 35:24.960
we're going to face in just a little bit.

35:24.960 --> 35:28.840
Now, you do have to be careful that you don't accumulate too many changes.

35:28.840 --> 35:33.440
You can, you know, if you're not doing regular deploys, you could get a really big difference

35:33.440 --> 35:34.440
between them.

35:34.440 --> 35:38.000
You also, depending on the team size, you know, you might need folks involved.

35:38.000 --> 35:41.640
I think that's less of a problem here, especially since you've been doing such a great job of

35:41.640 --> 35:44.360
being informed on what's going on with the website brand.

35:44.360 --> 35:47.960
If there's been a lot of features added and you're trying to do like a successful look

35:47.960 --> 35:52.240
at did that deploy correctly, did it break anything, did it, did those new things actually

35:52.240 --> 35:53.240
get added?

35:53.240 --> 35:57.200
You need to make sure that you have all that context or people around who can help with

35:57.200 --> 35:58.200
that.

35:58.200 --> 35:59.200
Yeah.

35:59.200 --> 36:03.240
I think one other advantage we're looking forward to is building in basically a live

36:03.240 --> 36:08.440
preview of the development branch that is on the exact same infrastructure that we can,

36:08.440 --> 36:14.760
you know, make some merges to and test things in real time without maybe that being public

36:14.760 --> 36:15.920
facing.

36:15.920 --> 36:19.560
I'm sure we'll make some mistakes so we don't want that to be too public.

36:19.560 --> 36:21.800
You know, there's, it's always nice to have same desk.

36:21.800 --> 36:22.800
That's for sure.

36:22.800 --> 36:23.800
Hmm.

36:23.800 --> 36:26.000
It does seem like something we probably should be doing now.

36:26.000 --> 36:30.000
Like we've reached that phase of the development cycle, which is exciting.

36:30.000 --> 36:31.600
We were getting all grown up.

36:31.600 --> 36:33.200
It's a successful project, right?

36:33.200 --> 36:34.760
I mean, very successful.

36:34.760 --> 36:35.760
Yeah.

36:35.760 --> 36:38.760
It's pretty great seeing the work continue.

36:38.760 --> 36:42.120
There's some things that I feel like we should probably take a minute and jump in and have

36:42.120 --> 36:43.880
a conversation about with them.

36:43.880 --> 36:47.600
You know, specifically just certain directions on future developments.

36:47.600 --> 36:49.660
We're lucky to have that issue.

36:49.660 --> 36:54.040
There's things that people want to build and they need information from us so they can

36:54.040 --> 36:57.720
build those apps, like in some sort of consumable format.

36:57.720 --> 36:59.660
And there's just a debate on how to do that.

36:59.660 --> 37:03.600
And so one of the things that I always want to bring the conversation back to is we love

37:03.600 --> 37:05.100
our new website.

37:05.100 --> 37:12.920
The RSS feed whenever we can needs to be the source of truth because the website is probably

37:12.920 --> 37:16.360
the smallest way people consume content from JB.

37:16.360 --> 37:22.120
Just because we've under invested in that website for so long and we've promoted all

37:22.120 --> 37:27.240
of the individual show sites so heavily, we've just discouraged visiting jupitabroadcasting.com.

37:27.240 --> 37:32.400
I mean, until recently, officehours.hair is the URL we always mentioned, right?

37:32.400 --> 37:33.400
Right.

37:33.400 --> 37:36.840
I think the main site had had the calendar and had the live page.

37:36.840 --> 37:37.840
Yes.

37:37.840 --> 37:39.560
You know, otherwise don't really need to go there.

37:39.560 --> 37:40.560
You don't need to.

37:40.560 --> 37:45.680
So we always kind of kind of keep the website is one of the endpoint destinations of the

37:45.680 --> 37:46.680
information.

37:46.680 --> 37:48.680
But so is the podcast apps.

37:48.680 --> 37:50.320
So are YouTube.

37:50.320 --> 37:51.480
So is like all these things.

37:51.480 --> 37:54.080
And all of that needs to be really driven from the RSS feed.

37:54.080 --> 37:57.280
The RSS feed needs to be the source of truth for all of that.

37:57.280 --> 37:59.240
And so we just need to build things with that in mind.

37:59.240 --> 38:03.560
And just kind of keep repeating that mantra is the RSS feed needs to be the source of

38:03.560 --> 38:05.080
truth.

38:05.080 --> 38:06.840
That is essential for a podcast.

38:06.840 --> 38:10.160
You know, that the RSS feed is our radio signal.

38:10.160 --> 38:12.280
We are the RSS feed really, right?

38:12.280 --> 38:14.080
I mean, yeah, yeah.

38:14.080 --> 38:20.120
And just so grateful for the fact that we can be really heads down on something like

38:20.120 --> 38:21.120
this.

38:21.120 --> 38:26.680
And to have just things like that 404 page actually just get completely pushed out and

38:26.680 --> 38:29.880
developed while we're out here doing this just.

38:29.880 --> 38:35.040
And there are certainly other PRs that have been created and merged in that time.

38:35.040 --> 38:37.920
And I have been not involved at all.

38:37.920 --> 38:44.440
So a huge thank you to El Rey for kind of taking the reins and and keeping things flowing

38:44.440 --> 38:45.900
nicely for the community.

38:45.900 --> 38:48.960
So another shout out to El Rey once again.

38:48.960 --> 38:50.400
You know, I think we have a boost from El Rey too.

38:50.400 --> 38:53.440
So why don't we get into the boost?

38:53.440 --> 38:56.660
And now it is time for the boost.

38:56.660 --> 39:00.840
And our first boost actually comes in from true grits who sent in an enterprise boost

39:00.840 --> 39:07.280
of 1701 sats says belated congrats on the new website.

39:07.280 --> 39:10.040
I just checked it out and it looks much nicer.

39:10.040 --> 39:12.280
Thank you for the feedback.

39:12.280 --> 39:14.840
I love the people are still like going out and checking it out.

39:14.840 --> 39:18.840
That true grits you know, that's that's a booster of high taste I think speaking of

39:18.840 --> 39:25.880
the Star Trek boost, the enterprise boost, we found a all Star Trek TNG channel and that's

39:25.880 --> 39:27.220
the only we've never changed it.

39:27.220 --> 39:28.220
We got here.

39:28.220 --> 39:32.360
I had it on within five minutes of being at the Airbnb and it's literally been on the

39:32.360 --> 39:33.360
entire time.

39:33.360 --> 39:37.920
The amazing thing, too, is it started with episode one encounter at Farpoint when I turned

39:37.920 --> 39:38.920
on the TV.

39:38.920 --> 39:42.080
It was and it's been going chronologically the entire time.

39:42.080 --> 39:48.040
Now they're into season two except for they skipped Tasha dying skin of evil.

39:48.040 --> 39:51.040
I don't know why they skipped that episode, but they just skipped right over Tasha yard.

39:51.040 --> 39:52.040
She just disappeared.

39:52.040 --> 39:53.040
Yeah.

39:53.040 --> 39:57.760
And in the Pluto TV Star Trek parallel universe version, Tasha are still alive.

39:57.760 --> 40:00.720
She just hasn't shown up to work for a few days.

40:00.720 --> 40:01.720
Thank you.

40:01.720 --> 40:07.480
True Grits gene being boosted in with a lead set of sats and gene being writes, Have you

40:07.480 --> 40:14.180
ever considered using J.B. as a business that is an alternative to fireside and other parts

40:14.180 --> 40:16.160
of podcasting infrastructure?

40:16.160 --> 40:19.680
You know, the way you can maybe monetize some of the work and learnings you guys have done

40:19.680 --> 40:20.680
on the back end.

40:20.680 --> 40:25.080
What do you think, Wes, should we should we take everything that's been built on the back

40:25.080 --> 40:29.680
end and bring it up to the market and compete with fireside and all the others?

40:29.680 --> 40:33.560
I don't know about compete, but there's a lot of good ingredients in there.

40:33.560 --> 40:34.560
That's true.

40:34.560 --> 40:37.620
I don't think we have the you know, we don't have any of the perks to offer, like your

40:37.620 --> 40:40.120
Spotify's and your other closed platforms.

40:40.120 --> 40:44.840
And it's a little tricky because there are already specifically a few like podcasting

40:44.840 --> 40:50.920
2.0 tools and other platforms that exist that I think if you're doing one or two shows would

40:50.920 --> 40:53.360
work pretty well.

40:53.360 --> 40:57.640
And fireside and a few of the other competitors are hitting that market, but also a market

40:57.640 --> 40:59.200
that's a little above that.

40:59.200 --> 41:04.320
And I don't know if that higher market is interested in the like self hosted or like

41:04.320 --> 41:08.800
free and open source nature necessarily of the tools and platforms as as we are.

41:08.800 --> 41:11.480
Are you saying we're a bit of a niche?

41:11.480 --> 41:15.280
Yeah, we definitely like to push the edge on the features.

41:15.280 --> 41:19.800
Is that the other thing is, is those services can live and die on their UI.

41:19.800 --> 41:25.520
We do not fuss a lot about UI for our tools or audio or audio.

41:25.520 --> 41:30.680
And then the other thing that that strikes me about it besides the pricing and how tricky

41:30.680 --> 41:37.040
that would be is, you know, the thing that we could focus on and feels pretty within

41:37.040 --> 41:43.480
our reach would be to kind of package up the website stuff and say, hey, if you're looking

41:43.480 --> 41:49.600
for a kind of out of the box website for a podcast, especially like a network that has

41:49.600 --> 41:54.680
a couple of podcasts because man, there's nothing out there for podcast networks.

41:54.680 --> 41:55.680
Nothing out there.

41:55.680 --> 41:56.680
Yeah, right.

41:56.680 --> 41:57.680
That has that notion built right in now.

41:57.680 --> 42:01.760
Yeah, so I almost feel like if we were to refine the focus a little bit that we could

42:01.760 --> 42:05.640
actually achieve and really somebody could just go fork it right now and actually just

42:05.640 --> 42:06.640
just do that on their own.

42:06.640 --> 42:07.920
They don't really have to do much.

42:07.920 --> 42:12.000
But I think it's safe to say Gene Beans right in that, yeah, we've obviously talked about

42:12.000 --> 42:13.000
this before.

42:13.000 --> 42:14.000
Yeah.

42:14.000 --> 42:20.600
Technical issues boosted him with 5000 sats coming in hot with the boost every time he

42:20.600 --> 42:24.880
says I saw Dave Jones boost this on Mastodon and I was curious about what you thought.

42:24.880 --> 42:29.400
The website is Op3OP3.dev.

42:29.400 --> 42:30.400
And Wes, am I right?

42:30.400 --> 42:35.960
Is this sort of maybe like an open source public podcast stats tracking service?

42:35.960 --> 42:40.120
Yeah, it's the Open Podcast Prefix Project.

42:40.120 --> 42:41.880
That's where the three comes from.

42:41.880 --> 42:47.440
And the idea is your podcast or podcast hosting company, maybe it's this fictional other spin

42:47.440 --> 42:49.200
out we've just made.

42:49.200 --> 42:53.520
You can prepend their little URL to the start of your normal URL.

42:53.520 --> 42:54.520
It's like a redirect.

42:54.520 --> 42:56.920
And then it's going to just do a quick little redirect.

42:56.920 --> 43:00.760
They talk later on about, you know, their their edge locations all over the world.

43:00.760 --> 43:04.640
Global CDN with 275 cities in over 100 countries.

43:04.640 --> 43:06.360
Yeah, that's the one.

43:06.360 --> 43:09.280
And then yeah, they they'll start collecting some metrics, you know, according to various

43:09.280 --> 43:11.240
like IAB standards and such.

43:11.240 --> 43:13.320
They talk about that, too.

43:13.320 --> 43:19.440
But the metrics, they're intended to be open, privacy focused, but open.

43:19.440 --> 43:25.160
So they don't expose who's doing the downloading, but they do expose the podcast numbers.

43:25.160 --> 43:29.520
Once you start using this prefix, you are opening up your show's listener numbers to

43:29.520 --> 43:33.400
the world without compromising your listeners privacy.

43:33.400 --> 43:37.240
Now they do say next to that, you know, developers and companies can start building products

43:37.240 --> 43:41.880
and services for you with the data without you having to manage a custom integration.

43:41.880 --> 43:43.280
So maybe that's some of the angle.

43:43.280 --> 43:45.960
Okay, I have some questions.

43:45.960 --> 43:48.520
Why would someone want to do this?

43:48.520 --> 43:51.560
Compared to how it's done now, which maybe we should explain as well.

43:51.560 --> 43:56.960
It's pretty close to how it's done now with the exception of open numbers.

43:56.960 --> 44:02.560
And it's usually either companies that are in the podcast, advertising selling business

44:02.560 --> 44:03.920
or Spotify.

44:03.920 --> 44:07.240
It's not like a super neutral party.

44:07.240 --> 44:12.960
To that end, I actually think firesides one of the better metric collectors in the business.

44:12.960 --> 44:18.000
I think one of the more popular ones would be pod track is also chartable, blueberry,

44:18.000 --> 44:22.280
some of these that people use, and they all kind of use HTTP redirects to count download

44:22.280 --> 44:23.660
numbers.

44:23.660 --> 44:30.440
Then podcasters take that and they use those numbers to set pricing for advertisers.

44:30.440 --> 44:33.760
That's where having them open could be kind of interesting.

44:33.760 --> 44:36.640
I would be willing to do it if everyone else in our space did.

44:36.640 --> 44:39.400
I was about to say it's one of those sort of first mover things, right?

44:39.400 --> 44:43.240
Because like to play in that ecosystem, if that's how the world was already working.

44:43.240 --> 44:44.840
But how do you how do you get that shift?

44:44.840 --> 44:52.200
I can also see it inspiring a bit of animosity, a little envy, perhaps between different,

44:52.200 --> 44:55.040
you know, podcasters, they're in the same niche or something like that.

44:55.040 --> 44:59.600
Well, that's what I think that's where my question originates is, what's the advantage

44:59.600 --> 45:02.680
other than just kind of making it transparent?

45:02.680 --> 45:08.320
Because it seems like, to me at least, that I'm not sure really what you would get out

45:08.320 --> 45:09.320
of it.

45:09.320 --> 45:10.320
Yeah.

45:10.320 --> 45:11.840
And I can tell you, somebody's been doing this for 15 years.

45:11.840 --> 45:15.440
The download number is, I mean, it matters.

45:15.440 --> 45:21.560
But it's one of probably five or six data points that I consider on how a show is doing.

45:21.560 --> 45:25.880
And so a show that gets 10,000 downloads versus a show that gets 60,000 downloads.

45:25.880 --> 45:31.200
Well, if you just compare them by the numbers, like, okay, for example, office hours, right,

45:31.200 --> 45:36.700
I actually do not know what office hours download numbers are, because I don't care.

45:36.700 --> 45:38.080
It's not about that.

45:38.080 --> 45:41.600
It's about making a podcast for the JB audience that wants it.

45:41.600 --> 45:45.800
And I don't care if it gets 10 downloads, look at the community that we had built around

45:45.800 --> 45:50.920
it for like the website and helping you, you know, get gas in your tank and like it has

45:50.920 --> 45:54.360
been immensely valuable for us.

45:54.360 --> 45:56.400
I don't even know what the download numbers are, right?

45:56.400 --> 45:58.960
What I follow is how many boosts are coming in?

45:58.960 --> 46:00.600
How many emails are coming in?

46:00.600 --> 46:03.760
What is the response we're getting in the matrix chat when we talk about this stuff,

46:03.760 --> 46:04.760
right?

46:04.760 --> 46:07.840
Well, I've noticed as well at the meetups, just how much people are mentioning certain

46:07.840 --> 46:09.920
topics and service comes up.

46:09.920 --> 46:10.920
Yeah.

46:10.920 --> 46:14.200
And those are the kinds of numbers these days that I pay more attention to.

46:14.200 --> 46:18.080
I guess if I suppose if I was trying to be really aggressive about selling ads on office

46:18.080 --> 46:21.120
hours, I'd probably be more aware of what the numbers are.

46:21.120 --> 46:26.960
I'm not as much because I'm not really actively doing that as long as the boosts stay pretty

46:26.960 --> 46:27.960
decent.

46:27.960 --> 46:28.960
We'll see.

46:28.960 --> 46:29.960
You never know.

46:29.960 --> 46:32.000
It's going to be more, probably more economic tightening.

46:32.000 --> 46:33.000
So who knows?

46:33.000 --> 46:39.620
But I personally am a little bit like a sconce at this Op3Dev, but I would love to hear Dave's

46:39.620 --> 46:40.620
thoughts on it.

46:40.620 --> 46:43.120
So I might have to go dig up his post on Mastodon.

46:43.120 --> 46:47.440
So I think the pod sage would probably get me thinking a little bit more about it.

46:47.440 --> 46:53.320
And then check this out, guys, Frozier boosted in with a mega row of sticks, one hundred

46:53.320 --> 46:57.440
and eleven thousand stats and another hundred and eleven in there, too.

46:57.440 --> 47:00.320
That's a big number that I can barely even get out this time at night.

47:00.320 --> 47:01.920
Sounds like more stakes to me.

47:01.920 --> 47:02.920
Definitely.

47:02.920 --> 47:09.440
Definitely our baller booster for the night.

47:09.440 --> 47:12.840
So thank you very much, Frozer, and he just says longtime listener.

47:12.840 --> 47:13.840
Thanks for everything.

47:13.840 --> 47:14.840
Lovely.

47:14.840 --> 47:19.200
One of the meet ups, I don't want to give too many details, but one of the meet ups,

47:19.200 --> 47:26.560
we talked to a guy who was so early into Bitcoin that when he'd leave Bitcoin mining overnight

47:26.560 --> 47:30.520
on his PC, he'd get a block, he'd get 50 Bitcoin.

47:30.520 --> 47:35.080
And he was annoyed the one night when he ran it overnight and didn't get 50 Bitcoin.

47:35.080 --> 47:37.120
Oh, my goodness.

47:37.120 --> 47:38.120
Yeah.

47:38.120 --> 47:42.480
She's like, you know, thanks for the Bitcoin coverage.

47:42.480 --> 47:43.480
Like you're welcome.

47:43.480 --> 47:46.120
So funny.

47:46.120 --> 47:49.800
I mean, could you imagine like 50 Bitcoin a night?

47:49.800 --> 47:50.800
It's crazy back then.

47:50.800 --> 47:52.320
It was so crazy back then.

47:52.320 --> 47:57.720
Oh, I am super happy to say our next booster is our Web site star contributor that we were

47:57.720 --> 48:01.400
just talking about this week, one amongst many, but one that comes up often on this

48:01.400 --> 48:02.400
show.

48:02.400 --> 48:09.680
It is Mr. Elray who boosted in with a row of ducks, two thousand two hundred and twenty

48:09.680 --> 48:15.120
two sats, and Elray writes, So I was able to get money into Albi while completely on

48:15.120 --> 48:16.400
mobile.

48:16.400 --> 48:18.000
This is something we were asking.

48:18.000 --> 48:21.880
Albi is a browser extension that kind of lets you connect to your own note.

48:21.880 --> 48:25.360
It lets you bring your wallet between different applications and services.

48:25.360 --> 48:27.840
And Podverse is one of them.

48:27.840 --> 48:30.560
By the way, Podverse on Graphene OS.

48:30.560 --> 48:31.560
Thumbs up.

48:31.560 --> 48:32.560
Big thumbs up.

48:32.560 --> 48:33.560
Some foreshadowing there.

48:33.560 --> 48:34.560
Hmm.

48:34.560 --> 48:36.840
So Elray writes, I did have to use another app.

48:36.840 --> 48:40.440
I have BlueWallet, which can generate the invoices for my Albi wallet.

48:40.440 --> 48:42.840
Then I go to the pay option in the strike app.

48:42.840 --> 48:47.100
You'll then be able to paste the lightning request from BlueWallet.

48:47.100 --> 48:51.260
If you click the QR code, you'll get that and you'll get a paste option and it all sends.

48:51.260 --> 48:52.560
We were kind of playing around with this, too.

48:52.560 --> 48:56.680
It's like tricky to set it up once.

48:56.680 --> 48:59.920
And then once you figure out the workflow, it's super fast.

48:59.920 --> 49:04.120
Like the second time we did it, we bought like one gift card and a second gift card.

49:04.120 --> 49:05.920
Second time it was like easy peasy.

49:05.920 --> 49:06.920
Fifteen seconds.

49:06.920 --> 49:07.920
Mm hmm.

49:07.920 --> 49:08.920
The first time it took us like 10 minutes.

49:08.920 --> 49:09.920
Nice.

49:09.920 --> 49:10.920
Just figured it all out.

49:10.920 --> 49:14.040
You got to get the workflow and figure out how to connect the apps.

49:14.040 --> 49:19.800
It's an open system with an open protocol like HTTP, like SMTP.

49:19.800 --> 49:24.140
And in some cases, you're connecting multiple applications together and you're moving things

49:24.140 --> 49:26.860
around this open network to get it in the right place.

49:26.860 --> 49:27.860
It's just how the nature of it.

49:27.860 --> 49:33.160
So I really like the combination of Albi and Podverse.

49:33.160 --> 49:36.880
It sounds like another great option is the Zeus wallet to move things around.

49:36.880 --> 49:39.260
I'm going to play around with all this and come up with some official recommendations

49:39.260 --> 49:41.560
for working with Albi.

49:41.560 --> 49:46.680
You know what I did when while you both were recording LAN earlier today, I didn't actually

49:46.680 --> 49:47.680
share this.

49:47.680 --> 49:51.600
Chris, you're going to have to help me because this time of night, I forgot all the things

49:51.600 --> 49:52.600
I learned.

49:52.600 --> 49:53.600
But a circle.

49:53.600 --> 49:58.000
OK, so I have a node that some of your wonderful stats come into.

49:58.000 --> 49:59.000
Oh, yeah.

49:59.000 --> 50:00.000
Thank you very much.

50:00.000 --> 50:01.000
Yeah.

50:01.000 --> 50:02.880
That's so that's the node we set up for you on Linode that is in the split.

50:02.880 --> 50:06.280
So when you boost into office hours and lap, the split goes to Brent's node.

50:06.280 --> 50:07.820
We call it Brent's node.

50:07.820 --> 50:10.160
It is called Brent's node.

50:10.160 --> 50:11.160
Something like that.

50:11.160 --> 50:12.160
Only we should actually give out the actual name.

50:12.160 --> 50:13.160
No, that's fine.

50:13.160 --> 50:14.160
But it's close to Brent's node.

50:14.160 --> 50:17.320
So I've been kind of playing with that because, you know, we've been trying to get into that

50:17.320 --> 50:18.320
on this trip.

50:18.320 --> 50:24.320
And so I I Chris, you set me up with a bunch of channels to other people's nodes.

50:24.320 --> 50:27.440
And we had to play with that a little bit to try to use some of the stats that were

50:27.440 --> 50:28.440
on my node.

50:28.440 --> 50:33.920
And so I played today with doing some circle, a loop.

50:33.920 --> 50:41.680
No, I was trying to rebalance some stats on certain channels and use a circular.

50:41.680 --> 50:44.480
What is that called when you move sats from one side to the other through?

50:44.480 --> 50:45.480
OK, maybe it's called a loop.

50:45.480 --> 50:46.760
You can loop in and loop out.

50:46.760 --> 50:47.760
There's no no no.

50:47.760 --> 50:48.760
There's a ring of fire.

50:48.760 --> 50:49.760
Did you do the ring of fire?

50:49.760 --> 50:50.760
I hope so.

50:50.760 --> 50:51.760
Yeah, that's really cool, man.

50:51.760 --> 50:52.760
That's like a soundtrack.

50:52.760 --> 50:55.760
They're doing a ring of fire burn, burn, burn.

50:55.760 --> 50:56.760
All right.

50:56.760 --> 50:59.520
OK, so essentially what you're doing is you're sending out the stats from one channel and

50:59.520 --> 51:02.520
receiving them on another channel and kind of balancing things out.

51:02.520 --> 51:03.520
Yeah, that's exactly what it was.

51:03.520 --> 51:04.520
Yeah.

51:04.520 --> 51:07.680
But there was a name that everybody was using that I forget now and was a loop.

51:07.680 --> 51:10.440
We're just guessing shapes now.

51:10.440 --> 51:11.440
What is this show?

51:11.440 --> 51:12.440
Because was it triangle?

51:12.440 --> 51:17.600
It kind of sounds to me like maybe I should continue learning the square ellipse.

51:17.600 --> 51:20.600
You guys.

51:20.600 --> 51:21.600
That's great, though.

51:21.600 --> 51:23.600
That's you know, there's some people who hate that.

51:23.600 --> 51:25.400
I feel like it's a bit like Tamagotchi.

51:25.400 --> 51:26.400
You guys know what those are?

51:26.400 --> 51:27.400
Oh, yeah.

51:27.400 --> 51:28.400
I know a pet to have.

51:28.400 --> 51:29.400
I never really had one.

51:29.400 --> 51:32.280
But this my lightening, you know, it's kind of like my Tamagotchi pet where I checked

51:32.280 --> 51:33.280
the channel.

51:33.280 --> 51:34.280
The envy over here.

51:34.280 --> 51:35.280
Mm hmm.

51:35.280 --> 51:36.280
Mm hmm.

51:36.280 --> 51:37.880
OK, I was doing some circular rebalancing.

51:37.880 --> 51:38.880
Oh, yeah.

51:38.880 --> 51:39.880
OK.

51:39.880 --> 51:40.880
Hello.

51:40.880 --> 51:41.880
Yeah.

51:41.880 --> 51:42.880
OK, thanks.

51:42.880 --> 51:43.880
Yeah.

51:43.880 --> 51:45.960
No, actually, it's probably it's a different somebody can explain it what it is.

51:45.960 --> 51:46.960
But that's great.

51:46.960 --> 51:47.960
Good for you.

51:47.960 --> 51:48.960
Doing a little doing a little node maintenance.

51:48.960 --> 51:51.280
And so now you can get your outbound liquid.

51:51.280 --> 51:52.280
That's exactly it.

51:52.280 --> 51:53.280
Atta boy.

51:53.280 --> 52:00.480
Well, you're going to need it because Mr. Rust, a cast of first that comes in with 10,000

52:00.480 --> 52:02.640
stats this week boost.

52:02.640 --> 52:05.680
And they write this boost is courtesy of fountain.

52:05.680 --> 52:06.960
I'm in their beta group.

52:06.960 --> 52:11.600
And because I'm providing a value of time and talent to them, they threw in some treasure

52:11.600 --> 52:12.600
my way.

52:12.600 --> 52:13.600
And I'm happy to pass that along.

52:13.600 --> 52:14.600
Well, that's amazing.

52:14.600 --> 52:15.600
Thanks, Versa.

52:15.600 --> 52:19.040
This is I've mixed feelings on how their earnings work.

52:19.040 --> 52:22.840
But at the end of the day, I'm happy it's here because it allows me to participate.

52:22.840 --> 52:26.720
I'm intimidated to go from fiat to digital currency only.

52:26.720 --> 52:29.000
I'm trying to educate myself more on the topic.

52:29.000 --> 52:31.560
But honestly, it's kind of a big leap.

52:31.560 --> 52:32.560
Don't go kissing mountains.

52:32.560 --> 52:33.560
Brent, we need you.

52:33.560 --> 52:34.560
Oh, thank you.

52:34.560 --> 52:35.560
On that one.

52:35.560 --> 52:37.360
We still need to do some repairs on Brent's car when we get back.

52:37.360 --> 52:38.360
It's true.

52:38.360 --> 52:40.400
Just a little mountain kissing just a little bit.

52:40.400 --> 52:43.040
You're only a few stones stuck in the system rocks.

52:43.040 --> 52:44.040
They're real mountains.

52:44.040 --> 52:45.280
So it's hard to resist.

52:45.280 --> 52:46.440
It's a great ride.

52:46.440 --> 52:51.840
You know, the point here is well taken rest of casta it is a little bit sketchy still

52:51.840 --> 52:53.320
to go from fiat.

52:53.320 --> 52:55.160
I love RoboSats.

52:55.160 --> 52:58.420
The great thing about RoboSats, it's on tour, so you got to go track it down.

52:58.420 --> 53:01.400
But when you go Google search RoboSats, you'll find educational materials like the first

53:01.400 --> 53:02.400
link.

53:02.400 --> 53:06.400
The beautiful thing about RoboSats is it's more of a human experience.

53:06.400 --> 53:11.060
I know that sounds weird, but robots in the name, right?

53:11.060 --> 53:14.440
The only thing that's robot is you're just kind of like a generic avatar.

53:14.440 --> 53:17.880
So when you go to RoboSats, it generates an avatar for you.

53:17.880 --> 53:22.040
It's a basically an encryption ID and then you can download that and save it and then

53:22.040 --> 53:26.200
you can come back and use that use that same avatar over and over again.

53:26.200 --> 53:28.440
So you build up a reputation, but it's not a tie.

53:28.440 --> 53:29.440
It's not tied to any ID.

53:29.440 --> 53:33.400
It just was randomly generated that one time when you loaded the website and then you go

53:33.400 --> 53:39.980
in and there's a buy and a sell side and the sellers will list what they're willing to

53:39.980 --> 53:40.980
accept as payment.

53:40.980 --> 53:44.320
And sometimes it's things like let's use the cash app.

53:44.320 --> 53:45.320
Let's use strike.

53:45.320 --> 53:46.320
Let's use revolt.

53:46.320 --> 53:51.160
I've even seen like an Amazon gift card on one because they just choose what they want.

53:51.160 --> 53:53.400
And so you go there and you initiate the trade.

53:53.400 --> 53:54.400
You tell them how much you want.

53:54.400 --> 53:57.640
You have to accept because they're going to have a mark up a little bit above market price.

53:57.640 --> 53:59.600
So you accept how much you're willing to trade.

53:59.600 --> 54:04.000
So you say, I want a thousand sats or whatever.

54:04.000 --> 54:07.320
It actually starts a chat process with that other person and you exchange a little bit

54:07.320 --> 54:10.320
information just to refine all the payment details.

54:10.320 --> 54:14.000
There's an escrow process involved so it makes sure everybody gets everything they're supposed

54:14.000 --> 54:15.720
to and you can report if you didn't get it.

54:15.720 --> 54:18.120
Of course it would affect their reputation too.

54:18.120 --> 54:22.520
And in this process you have an actual quick exchange with the person you're buying from

54:22.520 --> 54:26.520
and it ends up being a more human experience and it's not a hassle.

54:26.520 --> 54:28.200
It's just real quick.

54:28.200 --> 54:29.200
Human sets.

54:29.200 --> 54:30.200
So I like RoboSats.

54:30.200 --> 54:34.700
I really, I recognize it's not like crazy simple and straightforward and that Chris

54:34.700 --> 54:38.760
is a little bit of a weirdo here because I'm okay loading up the tour browser to go buy

54:38.760 --> 54:43.100
my sats, but they've also made an Umbral app.

54:43.100 --> 54:47.560
So if you've got Umbral now, there is a RoboSats app that you can install and run your own

54:47.560 --> 54:49.720
local RoboSats using your own node information.

54:49.720 --> 54:53.720
I just love that kind of crap, you know, I love it.

54:53.720 --> 54:57.160
You know, every week when we bring up our doc for this show, I think there can't be

54:57.160 --> 55:03.760
that much podcasting news or Bitcoin related stuff that we want to talk about, but it turns

55:03.760 --> 55:07.480
out there's always tons of, there's more super, super fascinating.

55:07.480 --> 55:12.720
I do want to mention as well, Rustacasta, thank you for getting involved with Fountain.

55:12.720 --> 55:18.220
I think getting involved in a bunch of these pieces of software that we're using is amazing.

55:18.220 --> 55:24.080
And that reminds me of how a bunch of our contributors to our website helped Podverse.

55:24.080 --> 55:25.080
Yeah.

55:25.080 --> 55:26.720
Chris, you had some feedback on that one.

55:26.720 --> 55:30.820
Yeah, in fact, I want to get Mitch back on the show and talk about it, but I had a nice

55:30.820 --> 55:37.720
note from Mitch, one of the co-creators of Podverse and one of the main developers, and

55:37.720 --> 55:44.560
he just said, you know, he's had a great experience from contributors who are helping just like

55:44.560 --> 55:48.520
with bugs and little things here in Podverse here and there and catch stuff.

55:48.520 --> 55:53.360
And he says some of the best technical contributions that they've had from outsiders to the project

55:53.360 --> 55:54.880
are from JB audience members.

55:54.880 --> 55:58.320
They'll say, oh yeah, I heard about it on JB and they come contribute.

55:58.320 --> 56:00.200
That is so dang cool.

56:00.200 --> 56:01.200
And we hear about it from Mitch.

56:01.200 --> 56:03.600
Like we didn't even hear about it, like the audience didn't like stop by and go, hey,

56:03.600 --> 56:04.660
guess what I did guys.

56:04.660 --> 56:07.160
They're just out there doing it, doing their thing.

56:07.160 --> 56:09.240
That's what's so great about it being open source, right?

56:09.240 --> 56:10.240
Yeah.

56:10.240 --> 56:11.240
Yeah.

56:11.240 --> 56:12.240
We already have-

56:12.240 --> 56:13.240
Long term, right?

56:13.240 --> 56:14.240
That's-

56:14.240 --> 56:15.240
Values for value, right?

56:15.240 --> 56:16.240
Yeah.

56:16.240 --> 56:17.240
Yeah.

56:17.240 --> 56:18.240
Podverse is super useful and some people can really help make it better.

56:18.240 --> 56:19.240
Yeah, definitely.

56:19.240 --> 56:22.280
Also just a really super quick note about Fountain and earning stats.

56:22.280 --> 56:26.280
They just kind of redid how the earn system works.

56:26.280 --> 56:31.520
It's way easier to understand and they explain it all in a blog post.

56:31.520 --> 56:34.440
So go check that out if you're earning your stats and you want to know how that works.

56:34.440 --> 56:39.360
And then really just super briefly, Mr. Versa actually boosted in with a double boost this

56:39.360 --> 56:42.720
week, which is so great.

56:42.720 --> 56:47.440
And they write, here's a new show title idea because I've been soliciting ideas from the

56:47.440 --> 56:51.640
audience on what to rename office hours because it's just a horrible show name.

56:51.640 --> 56:55.320
The idea was to talk about JB stuff and have a spot for the community to come in.

56:55.320 --> 56:56.700
That's still the idea.

56:56.700 --> 57:02.680
But the problem is, is that there's a billion podcast name office hours and about 900 million

57:02.680 --> 57:06.200
of them are all about the office television show.

57:06.200 --> 57:09.360
And then they get in here and they're like, well, how come you guys aren't talking about

57:09.360 --> 57:10.360
the office?

57:10.360 --> 57:11.360
And I'm like, oh.

57:11.360 --> 57:12.360
What are your thoughts on Jim and Pam?

57:12.360 --> 57:13.360
Huh?

57:13.360 --> 57:14.360
Yeah.

57:14.360 --> 57:15.360
Yeah.

57:15.360 --> 57:16.360
Don't get me going, dude.

57:16.360 --> 57:20.880
Now here's the thing, CastaVersa had a recommendation for a new show name.

57:20.880 --> 57:21.880
Oh.

57:21.880 --> 57:22.880
Sats and Chats with Chris.

57:22.880 --> 57:23.880
Sats and Chats.

57:23.880 --> 57:24.880
That's not that far off.

57:24.880 --> 57:25.880
I don't hate it.

57:25.880 --> 57:26.880
I don't hate it either.

57:26.880 --> 57:27.880
I don't hate it either.

57:27.880 --> 57:34.760
Um, I don't think it's it, uh, but it's cute.

57:34.760 --> 57:35.760
Gets the ball rolling.

57:35.760 --> 57:36.760
That's for sure.

57:36.760 --> 57:37.760
Yeah.

57:37.760 --> 57:38.760
We need something fun though.

57:38.760 --> 57:41.760
Cause what I have in mind, I don't even want to say it's so boring, but if nobody else

57:41.760 --> 57:44.000
has a better idea, I'm going to have to go with it.

57:44.000 --> 57:45.000
You know?

57:45.000 --> 57:48.120
So Sats and Chats with Chris could be like an occasional live stream.

57:48.120 --> 57:49.120
That's true.

57:49.120 --> 57:52.760
Especially when we start generating our RSS feed and we get the lit tag in there so you

57:52.760 --> 57:53.760
can boost the live shows.

57:53.760 --> 57:57.960
That could be a lot of fun to sit there and answer questions and you know, just have a

57:57.960 --> 57:58.960
good old time.

57:58.960 --> 57:59.960
Hmm.

57:59.960 --> 58:00.960
Think about it.

58:00.960 --> 58:01.960
I like that idea though.

58:01.960 --> 58:03.640
Thanks for sending something in RustaCastaVersa.

58:03.640 --> 58:07.160
If you'd like to send a boost into the show, we'd love you to send us one with using a

58:07.160 --> 58:12.560
new podcast app at newpodcastapps.com and we have something special.

58:12.560 --> 58:20.000
Editor Drew wanted to apologize to RustaCastaVersa who was tricked into listening to an extended

58:20.000 --> 58:24.360
post show that had nothing, just dead air, and he thought something Marvel style would

58:24.360 --> 58:25.620
be coming at the end of the credits.

58:25.620 --> 58:28.440
So Drew's just out there trolling our audience?

58:28.440 --> 58:35.200
Yeah, and he actually took a second to record a clip to RustaCasta who boosted in complaining

58:35.200 --> 58:37.960
about this Marvel style rug pull.

58:37.960 --> 58:46.120
Dear RustaCastaVersa, yes I biffed it and I hope that you accept this meow as an apology.

58:46.120 --> 58:47.120
Meow.

58:47.120 --> 58:49.720
Man, I've never gotten a meow before.

58:49.720 --> 58:52.560
Oh, I love him so much.

58:52.560 --> 58:56.880
If you'd like to get a boost into the show, newpodcastapps.com, go grab a new podcast

58:56.880 --> 59:01.600
app that's podcasting 2.0 compatible or you can use something like your Breeze out there

59:01.600 --> 59:02.600
or Albee.

59:02.600 --> 59:06.840
In fact, you can install Albee and then just boost through our website with the podcast

59:06.840 --> 59:10.960
player that we have embedded on the website so you don't have to offer it to no one.

59:10.960 --> 59:11.960
ALBY.

59:11.960 --> 59:12.960
We're firing for you.

59:12.960 --> 59:13.960
Yeah, Albee, ALBY.

59:13.960 --> 59:14.960
Check that out.

59:14.960 --> 59:15.960
It's a great open source extension.

59:15.960 --> 59:17.080
All right, boys, we did it.

59:17.080 --> 59:18.080
That's it.

59:18.080 --> 59:19.080
Get done, gentlemen.

59:19.080 --> 59:20.080
Yeah.

59:20.080 --> 59:21.080
Are you ready for JPL?

59:21.080 --> 59:24.280
Well, first, we have to welcome our final member of the crew.

59:24.280 --> 59:25.280
That's true.

59:25.280 --> 59:26.280
That's true.

59:26.280 --> 59:28.480
Alex is just showing up right now as we're wrapping up the show, so we've got to get

59:28.480 --> 59:30.360
out of here so we can go say hi to Alex.

59:30.360 --> 59:32.520
Also, everyone needs their beds back.

59:32.520 --> 59:33.520
Yeah, there's that.

59:33.520 --> 59:34.520
He's going to go get in.

59:34.520 --> 59:37.160
Oh, I wish we could have recorded that.

59:37.160 --> 59:39.960
Alex seeing his room just totally ripped apart.

59:39.960 --> 59:40.960
No bed.

59:40.960 --> 59:41.960
No blankets.

59:41.960 --> 59:42.960
No pillows.

59:42.960 --> 59:44.800
He's got the best internet in the house, though.

59:44.800 --> 59:45.800
So there's that.

59:45.800 --> 59:48.960
All right, everybody, office hours is over.

59:48.960 --> 59:51.960
We'll see you back from the Pacific Northwest in a couple of weeks.

59:51.960 --> 01:00:19.040
Get out of here.
