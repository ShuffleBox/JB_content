00:00.000 --> 00:07.900
It's Office Hours with Chris.

00:07.900 --> 00:09.540
Hi everyone.

00:09.540 --> 00:11.340
Welcome into Office Hours.

00:11.340 --> 00:13.700
Today in the office, Brent's joining me.

00:13.700 --> 00:14.700
Hello Brent.

00:14.700 --> 00:15.700
Well, hello there.

00:15.700 --> 00:16.700
Hi.

00:16.700 --> 00:17.700
Hey.

00:17.700 --> 00:18.700
You doing all right over there?

00:18.700 --> 00:19.700
Yeah.

00:19.700 --> 00:20.700
I'm not in my own office.

00:20.700 --> 00:23.620
I'm sitting in Alex's office, but I imagine you're in yours.

00:23.620 --> 00:28.540
We're virtually together in one office, the office of the Editor-in-Chief of Jupiter Broadcasting.

00:28.540 --> 00:30.360
It's a new test show.

00:30.360 --> 00:32.480
We're going to do it every other Tuesday, starting next week.

00:32.480 --> 00:34.780
This is a test of a new test show.

00:34.780 --> 00:38.300
We're trying out things like matrix integration.

00:38.300 --> 00:42.760
We're going to be experimenting with things for future podcasts.

00:42.760 --> 00:45.600
And of course, we're going to be covering things that are going on in the world of Jupiter

00:45.600 --> 00:48.940
Broadcasting because we have a summer of projects coming up.

00:48.940 --> 00:51.460
We've got a new meetup in the works already.

00:51.460 --> 00:52.460
All that kind of stuff.

00:52.460 --> 00:55.460
And also, we have some goals that we'd like to share with you.

00:55.460 --> 00:56.780
There's a whole bunch going on.

00:56.780 --> 00:58.780
You know, it's like a new day, Brent.

00:58.780 --> 01:03.040
The theme is possibilities today, which is a good day to do a test show.

01:03.040 --> 01:04.180
Sounds like you're feeling great today.

01:04.180 --> 01:05.180
This is...

01:05.180 --> 01:06.180
I'm excited.

01:06.180 --> 01:09.100
I started, actually, I have to be honest, trending very negative.

01:09.100 --> 01:12.340
And I thought it was going to be a real crapper of a day.

01:12.340 --> 01:14.060
What kicked you into that mood to start with?

01:14.060 --> 01:16.020
Well, I got RV problems again.

01:16.020 --> 01:17.020
Oh, no.

01:17.020 --> 01:18.020
Yeah.

01:18.020 --> 01:19.020
It's the damn slide again.

01:19.020 --> 01:23.700
So short version, as you're aware, is one side of our slide got some water damage.

01:23.700 --> 01:26.700
And so it caused the slide to sag a little bit.

01:26.700 --> 01:31.020
And then this thing gets retracted into the RV, and it's being drug along the floor.

01:31.020 --> 01:36.740
So the motors, which are not really sufficient to begin with, are working much harder.

01:36.740 --> 01:41.660
And when it rains, we've been pulling the slide in because it's leaking where it sags.

01:41.660 --> 01:43.700
And it's been raining a lot this winter.

01:43.700 --> 01:47.800
And so we've been pulling the slide in and out a lot this winter, and we have burned

01:47.800 --> 01:48.800
out the motors now.

01:48.800 --> 01:52.120
And I'm not even sure if I'll be able to get the slide in.

01:52.120 --> 01:55.500
And of course, I wanted to go on this camping trip with Dylan for his birthday at the end

01:55.500 --> 01:56.860
of the month.

01:56.860 --> 02:01.980
And we call around to all the shops, and we're lucky if they even call us back.

02:01.980 --> 02:06.900
We walked into one place, and they told us that they're booked out until September.

02:06.900 --> 02:09.500
RV season hasn't even really started yet.

02:09.500 --> 02:10.500
That's what I said.

02:10.500 --> 02:12.400
And he said, no, it doesn't end anymore.

02:12.400 --> 02:13.400
It never ends.

02:13.400 --> 02:16.220
Sounds like a business opportunity to me.

02:16.220 --> 02:17.980
Chris's RV shop.

02:17.980 --> 02:18.980
I know.

02:18.980 --> 02:19.980
I wish.

02:19.980 --> 02:23.820
I decided to actually drive around this morning before I came in and did the show today because

02:23.820 --> 02:28.860
I figured maybe I'd have a better result in person because I was getting nowhere on the

02:28.860 --> 02:29.860
phone.

02:29.860 --> 02:32.740
You know, I've worked with enough of these shops that you can kind of get an impression

02:32.740 --> 02:38.100
on how they run their schedule, how organized or chaotic the shop is just by kind of going

02:38.100 --> 02:39.860
in and talking to them.

02:39.860 --> 02:43.140
And that's a big factor when you're trying to get your homework done is how organized

02:43.140 --> 02:44.140
are they?

02:44.140 --> 02:45.580
Some of them are pretty bad.

02:45.580 --> 02:48.540
We went into our shop that we used to go to all the time.

02:48.540 --> 02:52.000
We loved them, but then their text left.

02:52.000 --> 02:55.540
And we thought, OK, we got to find a new place because we know this is important stuff.

02:55.540 --> 02:57.340
Well, we went back in there this morning.

02:57.340 --> 03:01.340
We walk in and they said, sorry, we can't see it till June, mid-June.

03:01.340 --> 03:02.340
Thanks anyways.

03:02.340 --> 03:03.340
We're going to keep looking.

03:03.340 --> 03:07.140
So we walk out and my wife, the assistant, she says, you know, I'm going to go back in

03:07.140 --> 03:09.860
there and just ask them, well, who the hell do they recommend that because there's nowhere

03:09.860 --> 03:10.860
we can go.

03:10.860 --> 03:11.860
Right.

03:11.860 --> 03:12.860
Like, who should we go talk to?

03:12.860 --> 03:18.180
So she turns around and goes back in and she bumps into the old text that used to be great

03:18.180 --> 03:19.180
that left.

03:19.180 --> 03:20.740
They'd come back.

03:20.740 --> 03:21.820
And one of them is the owner.

03:21.820 --> 03:24.980
He'd come back and they're great.

03:24.980 --> 03:25.980
And he worked with it.

03:25.980 --> 03:28.540
He's like, you know, well, I'll find something for you right now.

03:28.540 --> 03:29.540
He pulls out the schedule.

03:29.540 --> 03:31.020
He starts going through everything.

03:31.020 --> 03:33.980
He's like, we have three hours here and we have six hours here.

03:33.980 --> 03:38.080
If you can drop your rig off for two days and let us work over two days, we'll get it

03:38.080 --> 03:41.860
fixed for you and get you on the road before your camping trip with your son.

03:41.860 --> 03:42.860
Wow.

03:42.860 --> 03:46.300
And it's just one of those like she just bumped into them on the way back and like and then

03:46.300 --> 03:47.300
I walked out.

03:47.300 --> 03:48.300
I'm like, OK, that's awesome.

03:48.300 --> 03:51.380
I'm going to call this other shop who I was considering for the other work we need done

03:51.380 --> 03:54.940
. And sure enough, it's not as it's not as soon as I'd like, but they're going to get

03:54.940 --> 03:56.680
us into they're going to work with us.

03:56.680 --> 03:58.800
They're going to fix up something that's been a problem for a while.

03:58.800 --> 04:01.740
It's like all of a sudden we went from not being able to get any help.

04:01.740 --> 04:03.660
I got a couple of shops I'm working with again.

04:03.660 --> 04:08.060
We're going to have things up and going, which is good because we're already planning a J.B.

04:08.060 --> 04:11.340
road trip for this summer or maybe fall.

04:11.340 --> 04:14.900
She's got to be road ready, you know, we need jupes in perfect condition.

04:14.900 --> 04:15.900
That's for sure.

04:15.900 --> 04:22.660
I have an idea about maybe going to visiting a mutual friend and doing some meetups along

04:22.660 --> 04:23.660
the way.

04:23.660 --> 04:25.260
You know, three or four meetups along the way.

04:25.260 --> 04:28.300
Is it intentionally cryptic or am I supposed to guess or?

04:28.300 --> 04:32.820
Well, I haven't coordinated it with them yet, but they've offered and it's something that

04:32.820 --> 04:34.820
I think would be special and exclusive.

04:34.820 --> 04:37.540
I think you probably know what I'm talking about, probably.

04:37.540 --> 04:39.380
I think you've had brunch with this person.

04:39.380 --> 04:43.220
But anyways, I've had brunch with like a lot of people.

04:43.220 --> 04:50.820
I know which we should say why we have people's ear brunch isn't necessarily gone.

04:50.820 --> 04:53.820
It's just it's actually in the kitchen right now.

04:53.820 --> 04:56.260
So might come out in due time.

04:56.260 --> 04:57.260
Yeah, I suppose.

04:57.260 --> 04:59.780
And when it does, this would be one of the places we talk about it because that's sort

04:59.780 --> 05:03.980
of the general premise of the show is we get a lot of emails, we get a lot of boosts that

05:03.980 --> 05:08.100
come in and we get a lot of questions that come in and we don't necessarily get a chance

05:08.100 --> 05:11.260
to talk about them on air or there's a lot of initiatives that Jupiter Broadcasting

05:11.260 --> 05:12.500
is working on.

05:12.500 --> 05:15.500
Maybe some projects, some web projects and stuff like that that people might want to

05:15.500 --> 05:17.620
help us out with or get involved with.

05:17.620 --> 05:20.900
And it just doesn't really make sense to take up the other shows with that stuff.

05:20.900 --> 05:24.620
I mean, we can mention it, but we don't want to take up the other shows.

05:24.620 --> 05:29.020
I also feel like if we keep this trend going, this might be the place where you get like

05:29.020 --> 05:31.380
the early take on what's coming up.

05:31.380 --> 05:34.020
So could be could be.

05:34.020 --> 05:35.860
We got an email in to the show.

05:35.860 --> 05:37.420
I can say that now.

05:37.420 --> 05:41.740
It was a listener who sent in like the perfect hardware for Lady Jubes.

05:41.740 --> 05:45.420
It's an experiment he did for a Proxmox box last summer, but he says it's just going to

05:45.420 --> 05:46.580
be perfect for Jupes.

05:46.580 --> 05:51.220
It's low power, 10 watts and just this nice little Intel box.

05:51.220 --> 05:53.500
And I just love this about our audience, Brent.

05:53.500 --> 05:54.740
He's listening to my problems.

05:54.740 --> 05:58.620
He's like, I found the perfect hardware for you and he sends me all the links, all the

05:58.620 --> 06:05.540
specs that he used, the software stack, you know, like it's it's like a basically a blueprint.

06:05.540 --> 06:06.620
It's so great.

06:06.620 --> 06:10.660
So that's the kind of stuff that you only get here as this part of this community.

06:10.660 --> 06:11.900
And Joshua touched on that, too.

06:11.900 --> 06:16.820
He says it was great to meet everyone singing Happy Birthday to Wes and having cake while

06:16.820 --> 06:21.740
meeting you all and all the other great people in JB was really memorable.

06:21.740 --> 06:24.220
I hope to see some of you all again itself.

06:24.220 --> 06:27.420
I can't really say how awesome it is to meet everyone in person.

06:27.420 --> 06:28.420
Well, that's pretty great.

06:28.420 --> 06:29.580
That came from Joshua.

06:29.580 --> 06:33.540
He says, I loved geeking out with Hadia about growing plants.

06:33.540 --> 06:39.900
I feel like it's important also to say that these meetups are equally memorable for us.

06:39.900 --> 06:43.460
Like we were just as excited to go meet everyone else.

06:43.460 --> 06:48.300
And the conversations we had there as well were super memorable and really excited, exciting.

06:48.300 --> 06:50.900
And I'm still doing research based on some of those conversations.

06:50.900 --> 06:53.220
So it's two sided.

06:53.220 --> 06:55.100
And thank you for everyone who did show up.

06:55.100 --> 07:00.540
I think maybe one of the long term knock on effects of this Raleigh meetup might be that

07:00.540 --> 07:06.340
JB as a as a business or as a group or whatever you want to call it, kind of get serious about

07:06.340 --> 07:12.180
helping the community self-organized meetups, because I don't think we the meetup was less

07:12.180 --> 07:16.520
than 24 hours old where somebody was saying, hey, let's do another one, even if the host

07:16.520 --> 07:17.760
can't make it.

07:17.760 --> 07:19.260
Maybe some of us just want to get together.

07:19.260 --> 07:20.260
Yeah, that's great.

07:20.260 --> 07:22.060
I've seen other podcasts pull that off.

07:22.060 --> 07:25.740
I feel like it's another excuse to have a lug, JB inspired lug.

07:25.740 --> 07:29.260
And you and I can, you know, we can all just sort of show up whenever it fits.

07:29.260 --> 07:34.660
I also kind of wonder if maybe it isn't going to be more important as time goes on because

07:34.660 --> 07:37.260
things are just the world's wild these days.

07:37.260 --> 07:43.020
And so how nice is it to go somewhere where people kind of speak a common like language

07:43.020 --> 07:45.060
about something they're enthusiastic about?

07:45.060 --> 07:48.740
You could just talk to anybody about Linux and the whole technology stack.

07:48.740 --> 07:51.340
So you immediately have something to talk to people about.

07:51.340 --> 07:53.720
Plus you have like the hey, where are you from?

07:53.720 --> 07:58.940
And so even for people who are not like expert conversationalists, it's really easy to just

07:58.940 --> 08:01.340
kind of get yourself comfortable and start talking.

08:01.340 --> 08:04.820
That's that kind of awkwardness fades away for a lot of it.

08:04.820 --> 08:07.740
And it's easy for me to say because I've been to dozens and hundreds of them, I suppose,

08:07.740 --> 08:09.620
but it's pretty good.

08:09.620 --> 08:14.900
And so I think helping the community do that could be good for people's mental health.

08:14.900 --> 08:15.900
It's good for ours.

08:15.900 --> 08:20.460
So I think, yeah, we'd love to help as much as we can.

08:20.460 --> 08:22.500
Last email from my Frederick.

08:22.500 --> 08:24.980
It's time to sunset IRC from the website.

08:24.980 --> 08:27.020
It's definitely time.

08:27.020 --> 08:30.900
And continue the embracing of matrix.

08:30.900 --> 08:31.900
Long words.

08:31.900 --> 08:33.140
How does that sit with you, Chris?

08:33.140 --> 08:36.740
Well, I'm wondering how you feel about this, because I don't think you're a big element

08:36.740 --> 08:37.740
fan.

08:37.740 --> 08:39.780
I don't think you're really necessarily sold on the matrix thing.

08:39.780 --> 08:42.400
I think I'm sold on the idea.

08:42.400 --> 08:48.780
And I'm sold on, I think everyone's enthusiasm, because as far as ideals go, I'm enthusiastic,

08:48.780 --> 08:52.660
but implementation, I'm having a difficult time with.

08:52.660 --> 08:56.620
And I don't think it's only me, but let me know what you think.

08:56.620 --> 09:01.660
And it could be the fact that I'm running slightly older hardware that, you know, maybe

09:01.660 --> 09:07.140
on some more recent hardware, some of the issues I'm running into, part of which, for

09:07.140 --> 09:09.060
the most part, is performance.

09:09.060 --> 09:13.260
Maybe you don't even notice on a modern machine, but this X250 that I have here, just, it's

09:13.260 --> 09:17.300
fine for everything else I do, but it just like, you know, you start running a few of

09:17.300 --> 09:23.460
these apps, but Element especially, and it's just like, it was running like 80% CPU for

09:23.460 --> 09:27.440
no apparent reason for a long, long, long, long, long time.

09:27.440 --> 09:29.420
Maybe it's early days for the software or something.

09:29.420 --> 09:36.100
I'm trying to be positive here, but I just had some, yeah, some issues that if it wasn't

09:36.100 --> 09:40.700
matrix, I would just give up on that piece of software and not participate anymore.

09:40.700 --> 09:42.380
I did look at a few other clients.

09:42.380 --> 09:44.080
I think it's still early days.

09:44.080 --> 09:48.060
Many of them are in like alpha stages or beta stages and have bugs and things, but there

09:48.060 --> 09:49.560
are some great ones with great features.

09:49.560 --> 09:52.340
So I'm trying, I'm trying.

09:52.340 --> 09:56.580
You suggested maybe the web interface might be a thing for me to try and I haven't done

09:56.580 --> 09:57.580
that yet.

09:57.580 --> 09:58.900
So there's an opportunity.

09:58.900 --> 10:02.500
NeoChat might ultimately be a better option for, there's going to be, like you just said,

10:02.500 --> 10:08.940
there's going to be clients that will be perhaps more power efficient and processor efficient.

10:08.940 --> 10:12.940
This is the downside of using Electron as the base for Element.

10:12.940 --> 10:18.540
Just by nature, it's extremely power hungry and system intensive, unfortunately.

10:18.540 --> 10:21.740
And I'll add to this, you know, it is absolutely early days.

10:21.740 --> 10:26.460
I have a problem right now that I cannot respond to any PMs.

10:26.460 --> 10:27.460
Don't know why.

10:27.460 --> 10:31.780
I suspect one of my sessions isn't properly verified, but I can use all the tools to verify

10:31.780 --> 10:35.480
my sessions and I've logged out everything that doesn't look like it's right and everything

10:35.480 --> 10:36.480
looks good, right?

10:36.480 --> 10:40.560
Like I've diagnosed it, everything seems fine, yet I can't respond to any PMs.

10:40.560 --> 10:46.720
That's frustrating, you know, and I have weird quirks about just how it all works from a

10:46.720 --> 10:51.100
client side standpoint and how it, how it retrieves its information from the server.

10:51.100 --> 10:53.980
And of course, there's a whole, there's a whole conversation around how the state of

10:53.980 --> 10:54.980
the Synapse server.

10:54.980 --> 10:58.500
So it is very early days, but you know, my thought here is twofold.

10:58.500 --> 11:03.540
The audience that's likely to participate in these kinds of things are generally, you

11:03.540 --> 11:05.380
know, the early adopter crowd.

11:05.380 --> 11:09.020
The vast majority of the audience doesn't participate in any of this stuff, right?

11:09.020 --> 11:13.100
I mean, 99% of the audience isn't in the Telegram group, probably more than that, right?

11:13.100 --> 11:15.820
98% of the audience never emails in.

11:15.820 --> 11:21.280
It's the leading edge of the community that even use this stuff to begin with.

11:21.280 --> 11:24.980
And so they're probably in the early adopter category.

11:24.980 --> 11:29.220
And my other thought there is, well, then, okay, if we don't use this stuff as early

11:29.220 --> 11:31.020
adopters, who will?

11:31.020 --> 11:39.140
So if we don't, as a user base, put our eyes on this and find the problems and as a collective

11:39.140 --> 11:44.620
create demand, so that way the developers continue, this kind of stuff goes away.

11:44.620 --> 11:47.340
And things like Discord reign supreme.

11:47.340 --> 11:51.340
And so my thought was that those two things, like, well, we've got an early adopter audience.

11:51.340 --> 11:55.180
I mean, hell, they're using the Linux desktop a lot of cases or something, right?

11:55.180 --> 11:57.820
And if we don't do it, who will?

11:57.820 --> 12:03.340
And it also aligns a lot with sort of the long-term goals I have for JB as we go to

12:03.340 --> 12:05.020
the next 15 years.

12:05.020 --> 12:11.220
And that is to use as much self-hosted decentralized technology as possible.

12:11.220 --> 12:14.980
And so Matrix just so clearly is kind of like a long bet.

12:14.980 --> 12:21.580
I'm going long on decentralized and self-hosting and hoping that the return on investment will

12:21.580 --> 12:25.520
be that we grow as a healthy decentralized community.

12:25.520 --> 12:29.820
And by the time we get to something pretty large, it's hopefully the software is in good

12:29.820 --> 12:30.820
shape.

12:30.820 --> 12:32.340
We've got multiple clients to choose from.

12:32.340 --> 12:37.300
Denorite is totally feature complete with Synapse and all that kind of stuff.

12:37.300 --> 12:43.140
It seems like, and one of the reasons why I've become more enthusiastic about it is

12:43.140 --> 12:45.260
the trend is in the right direction.

12:45.260 --> 12:51.560
It's perhaps slower than I would expect because I was talking to the developers who were creating

12:51.560 --> 12:55.800
Matrix probably a couple of years before anybody really talked about it in the public because

12:55.800 --> 13:01.000
I met them at OSCON and they had a small little booth that was sponsored by somebody else.

13:01.000 --> 13:02.500
And so I went up and said, what the hell is Matrix?

13:02.500 --> 13:05.060
And I might have even made it into last.

13:05.060 --> 13:06.920
It was a long time ago.

13:06.920 --> 13:10.820
I would have thought it would be in a better spot than it is now.

13:10.820 --> 13:13.340
The protocol and all that stuff is in really good shape.

13:13.340 --> 13:14.660
The clients have been getting better.

13:14.660 --> 13:16.460
The community adoption is growing.

13:16.460 --> 13:18.240
The friction points are getting less.

13:18.240 --> 13:20.660
The third party clients are getting their act together.

13:20.660 --> 13:24.240
It's just all happening at the speed of organic software development.

13:24.240 --> 13:26.540
You can probably sense that.

13:26.540 --> 13:29.540
It's probably one of the reasons why you're willing to stick with it and put up with the

13:29.540 --> 13:31.260
frustrating front end experience.

13:31.260 --> 13:32.260
Yeah, certainly.

13:32.260 --> 13:36.660
And not to mention all the great content that's being shared there on our networks.

13:36.660 --> 13:39.420
But I agree with you completely.

13:39.420 --> 13:43.300
Everything you said is like, we need to be the people that push this a little bit.

13:43.300 --> 13:47.060
And I think maybe it's important to spin it a little differently.

13:47.060 --> 13:53.140
You know, my experience was not a hundred percent, but it was like 80 at least, which

13:53.140 --> 13:56.760
is saying something, you know, that feels like a huge success.

13:56.760 --> 14:02.120
And I would imagine for those early developers of Matrix, you know, seeing it from when you

14:02.120 --> 14:07.700
first met them till now, they probably feel like, geez, we've hit some massive success,

14:07.700 --> 14:09.660
but we just need to keep that going.

14:09.660 --> 14:14.920
I also think for us as, you know, the client side consumers who are early adopters, it's

14:14.920 --> 14:21.700
a great opportunity to get involved in a project and issue some bugs maybe, and get involved

14:21.700 --> 14:23.040
a little bit and have some conversation.

14:23.040 --> 14:25.880
So it could be an opportunity as well.

14:25.880 --> 14:30.600
My experience with the people involved with the Matrix community around Synapse 2 is they've

14:30.600 --> 14:34.860
been interested to hear our experiences too, which is I think is a positive sign.

14:34.860 --> 14:38.740
You know, they're not like, oh no, it's just your configuration, you did it wrong.

14:38.740 --> 14:41.940
They're like, tell us what happened, you know, what led to this?

14:41.940 --> 14:45.240
And that seems like a positive signal to me too.

14:45.240 --> 14:46.580
So we'll see.

14:46.580 --> 14:49.780
I think long-term it is going to be a good thing, but it is a bit rough.

14:49.780 --> 14:54.980
And so what we've decided to do is since we're doing the office hours live on Tuesdays, every

14:54.980 --> 14:55.980
other Tuesday.

14:55.980 --> 14:57.940
Fortnightly, you might say.

14:57.940 --> 14:58.940
Yep.

14:58.940 --> 15:03.160
We've decided to use the Matrix chat room as the official on stream chat.

15:03.160 --> 15:06.860
All our other shows that are live have always used IRC.

15:06.860 --> 15:11.420
And so we're just going to start making it normal to just work out the kinks, you know,

15:11.420 --> 15:13.420
so we can figure out the OBS integration.

15:13.420 --> 15:16.380
So users can identify what doesn't work for them.

15:16.380 --> 15:17.380
Just all that kind of stuff.

15:17.380 --> 15:18.380
So that's my goal.

15:18.380 --> 15:22.980
And then we'll also have the Mumble server going, which is another decentralized communications

15:22.980 --> 15:25.620
tool, but it's just down today.

15:25.620 --> 15:29.760
Here's why I've been banging on about decentralization more and more recently.

15:29.760 --> 15:35.820
It's been like my focus in 2022 because I've seen the walls closing in on the podcasting

15:35.820 --> 15:36.820
industry.

15:36.820 --> 15:41.780
That's why I have been talking more about value for value, time, treasure and talent

15:41.780 --> 15:43.140
and boosts.

15:43.140 --> 15:50.980
It's about changes that are happening in the industry with centralization and other pressures

15:50.980 --> 15:52.600
that are happening.

15:52.600 --> 15:54.100
And I'll just talk about a couple of these.

15:54.100 --> 15:59.700
Now one I've talked about before, but there's new news in this regard is Spotify.

15:59.700 --> 16:05.780
Spotify has just purchased two podcast analytics companies at the same time, the two major

16:05.780 --> 16:10.000
players actually, Podsites and Chartable.

16:10.000 --> 16:14.140
And the job of these two companies has been to play Switzerland.

16:14.140 --> 16:20.340
They are a third party that sits between the podcaster and the advertiser, and they measure

16:20.340 --> 16:22.420
your downloads via URL redirect.

16:22.420 --> 16:26.100
You'll see these sometimes in podcasters URLs, they'll have a little you redirect in there

16:26.100 --> 16:28.180
like for pod track or chartable or something like that.

16:28.180 --> 16:34.460
If you look at the actual URL for the MP3 file, and that's for a third party to track

16:34.460 --> 16:35.460
the download numbers.

16:35.460 --> 16:42.100
They're not tracking anything more than your country of origin and the download.

16:42.100 --> 16:46.500
And the idea is, is that the podcaster and the advertiser can believe the numbers that

16:46.500 --> 16:52.980
chartable or Podsites reports, and so that can be a neutral number from which you negotiate

16:52.980 --> 16:58.100
ad rates and establish audience size for a podcast and things like that.

16:58.100 --> 17:05.460
Spotify is both the podcaster and the advertiser, and now they have just bought Podsites and

17:05.460 --> 17:06.460
Chartable.

17:06.460 --> 17:10.300
So now the Fox is watching the hen house here is what's happening.

17:10.300 --> 17:15.660
And this is going to reduce third party measurement capabilities that are sort of neutral.

17:15.660 --> 17:17.860
And this is a problem.

17:17.860 --> 17:18.860
Here's a quote here.

17:18.860 --> 17:21.700
I pulled it says in the podcast space and really any media channel, there's always a

17:21.700 --> 17:26.980
concern about the idea that publishers shouldn't be grading their own homework or that there

17:26.980 --> 17:32.420
should be third party verification to help advertisers gain confidence in the space.

17:32.420 --> 17:36.140
The other thing that jumped out at me here is for some reason, even though I've been

17:36.140 --> 17:41.440
talking to you guys about this pretty much this entire year so far, some, I would guess

17:41.440 --> 17:44.760
ad commentators, people who commentate on the ad business.

17:44.760 --> 17:46.620
It's a company called Sounds Profitable.

17:46.620 --> 17:52.380
They said, quote, people were shocked that Spotify bought both of them at once.

17:52.380 --> 17:54.940
Buying one of them puts pressure on the other one.

17:54.940 --> 17:56.380
It changes the space.

17:56.380 --> 17:58.620
It creates more competition.

17:58.620 --> 18:03.300
Buying both of them creates a hole in the space.

18:03.300 --> 18:06.900
And of course, there's also concerns that Spotify's consolidation could make it even

18:06.900 --> 18:14.140
harder to get actual real reliable data that doesn't involve creepy tracking now to Spotify

18:14.140 --> 18:16.860
does a whole different level of tracking.

18:16.860 --> 18:17.860
This is a problem.

18:17.860 --> 18:21.340
What do you think is their motivation internally to do this?

18:21.340 --> 18:25.940
You know, it obviously we know the impacts and the ramifications, but what is, you know,

18:25.940 --> 18:30.060
they must have a motive other than just squashing the numbers.

18:30.060 --> 18:35.960
So they want to be sort of the Google AdWords or Facebook marketplace of advertising for

18:35.960 --> 18:37.220
audio content.

18:37.220 --> 18:42.840
So you go to the Spotify advertising platform, you choose the demographic you're looking

18:42.840 --> 18:46.900
for, so you could say millennials, you could say millennial females, you could say millennial

18:46.900 --> 18:51.740
males, you could say, you know, different age groups, different demographics in terms

18:51.740 --> 18:53.980
of work and interests.

18:53.980 --> 18:59.500
And then you can use this automated system to buy and bid on advertising that then gets

18:59.500 --> 19:03.720
dynamically inserted into the podcast upon download.

19:03.720 --> 19:08.660
And so they're always bidding those slots in real time and they kind of become the go

19:08.660 --> 19:09.660
to place.

19:09.660 --> 19:13.660
And before this, they were already sort of becoming the go to place in advertising.

19:13.660 --> 19:17.100
I've been having a conversation with some of our advertisers and Spotify is pushing

19:17.100 --> 19:18.100
this hard.

19:18.100 --> 19:20.980
They basically want to be Google ads for podcasting.

19:20.980 --> 19:21.980
I don't like it.

19:21.980 --> 19:23.620
I mean, I didn't like it before.

19:23.620 --> 19:25.180
I really don't like it now.

19:25.180 --> 19:29.280
Which would be a massive centralization of revenue in the podcast industry, right?

19:29.280 --> 19:33.180
It would make Spotify essentially the ultimate gatekeeper.

19:33.180 --> 19:38.140
Not to bang on about how bad the situation is, but there's another angle to this too

19:38.140 --> 19:40.700
that's closing in on the podcasting industry.

19:40.700 --> 19:46.740
The Brookings Institute, which is essentially a think tank that provides often bad policy

19:46.740 --> 19:49.740
ideas to the critters in DC.

19:49.740 --> 19:56.520
And they're now making recommendations for addressing content moderation in podcasts.

19:56.520 --> 19:58.580
It's time for a reckoning in podcasts.

19:58.580 --> 20:01.580
Just as Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube and other digital platforms have struggled for

20:01.580 --> 20:06.700
years with difficult questions about what content to allow on their platforms, podcast

20:06.700 --> 20:09.780
apps must now weigh them as well.

20:09.780 --> 20:13.060
So this is from the Brookings Institute that I'm reading from and it's a very long piece,

20:13.060 --> 20:16.180
but I've highlighted a couple of critical sections here.

20:16.180 --> 20:18.380
I'll put the link to this in the show notes.

20:18.380 --> 20:24.340
For starters, they write, podcast apps, podcasting apps need to develop a far more nuanced and

20:24.340 --> 20:31.600
transparent policies for the kinds of content that users can download and play.

20:31.600 --> 20:35.820
Podcasting applications should also have clear guidelines for what kinds of podcasts the

20:35.820 --> 20:38.060
app itself will recommend.

20:38.060 --> 20:41.460
So they're even talking about tweaking what the apps recommend.

20:41.460 --> 20:48.940
Now the reason why I have obvious concerns with this is what is considered a loud speech,

20:48.940 --> 20:54.300
safe speech, and they even say a legal speech in here, which is an interesting concept that

20:54.300 --> 20:55.780
shifts with time.

20:55.780 --> 21:00.140
And so like right now, this wouldn't necessarily affect any of the core Jupiter broadcasting

21:00.140 --> 21:01.140
shows.

21:01.140 --> 21:04.620
This clearly would be a concern for something like Unfilter, but this would not be a concern

21:04.620 --> 21:08.300
for any of the Jupiter broadcasting shows today.

21:08.300 --> 21:16.980
But if a horrendous like incident happened that changed the conversation around encryption,

21:16.980 --> 21:22.180
maybe some sort of event where it couldn't be prevented or we couldn't find out who did

21:22.180 --> 21:27.200
it because of encryption, and the conversation around encryption flips and it becomes a matter

21:27.200 --> 21:33.860
of national security, well at that point in time I'll be on air advocating for the right

21:33.860 --> 21:35.860
to encryption and privacy.

21:35.860 --> 21:41.100
I'm not going to change my position, but society around me may change one day on that particular

21:41.100 --> 21:42.100
point.

21:42.100 --> 21:43.980
Same for Bitcoin.

21:43.980 --> 21:50.380
There could have been a version of reality where free software was thought of as an extreme

21:50.380 --> 21:55.720
anti-capitalistic idea, and there is probably an alternate reality where they shut down

21:55.720 --> 22:01.100
speech about free software because it harms the economy, it harms capitalism.

22:01.100 --> 22:03.900
It just depends on the state of society at the time.

22:03.900 --> 22:11.860
And podcasts are the last bastion of truly open thought, and they're also a great example

22:11.860 --> 22:16.180
of the user being able to select or deselect that stuff.

22:16.180 --> 22:19.700
But the Brookings Institute is saying that we need to make it easy to start reporting

22:19.700 --> 22:23.640
podcasters who say the wrong thing.

22:23.640 --> 22:29.660
Podcast apps need to build in reporting tools, and they show how Spotify fails to do that,

22:29.660 --> 22:32.300
but Apple already allows for that.

22:32.300 --> 22:35.960
And of course it needs to go beyond just what podcast developers do.

22:35.960 --> 22:39.660
There needs to be regulation, and again the Brookings Institute, that's their job, right?

22:39.660 --> 22:44.760
They make policy that Congress creators can put their name on.

22:44.760 --> 22:49.620
So they write here, regulation and lawmakers have a role to play in shaping the policies

22:49.620 --> 22:51.260
in the podcast ecosystem.

22:51.260 --> 22:54.880
Apparently there's policies in this ecosystem.

22:54.880 --> 23:00.940
Policy makers and regulators should push for greater transparency on content guidelines

23:00.940 --> 23:05.600
and policies, clear guidelines about what we're allowed or what is restricted to talk

23:05.600 --> 23:06.600
about.

23:06.600 --> 23:08.600
Of course they should be transparent.

23:08.600 --> 23:13.940
Moderation practices and appeals processes for all podcast apps should be regulated.

23:13.940 --> 23:20.900
So all podcast apps must have the ability for a pissed off listener to report me, and

23:20.900 --> 23:25.780
the recommendation algorithms they use for discovery must be regulated such that they

23:25.780 --> 23:29.780
don't position anti-political content as popular.

23:29.780 --> 23:35.860
And that they throw some numbers in here and they say there's a public interest, a public

23:35.860 --> 23:41.180
good in understanding how all of these algorithms will work for these different apps, and making

23:41.180 --> 23:46.040
sure that there's a basic list of what they call factors about what the algorithm considers

23:46.040 --> 23:50.200
when it's boosting an episode or a series to the viewer.

23:50.200 --> 23:58.320
And then last but not least, but really the core piece of all of this, funding.

23:58.320 --> 24:02.620
Regulators need to get involved with funding for podcasts.

24:02.620 --> 24:08.860
At present, advertising represents the primary source of revenue for the podcasting industry.

24:08.860 --> 24:10.700
That means there's a vulnerability there.

24:10.700 --> 24:15.140
So perhaps there's regulation that could be applied to podcast advertisers, and we need

24:15.140 --> 24:21.500
more transparency, and we need to apply the radio reporting guidelines to this market.

24:21.500 --> 24:25.700
And given the size of the podcast ecosystem, these guidelines might need to be limited

24:25.700 --> 24:28.820
to series that generate maybe a certain minimum revenue.

24:28.820 --> 24:32.220
So I'm going to have to also report my revenue, however they're going to judge that, or an

24:32.220 --> 24:33.220
audience size.

24:33.220 --> 24:36.020
So however this regulator regulation body is, I'm going to have to report to them my

24:36.020 --> 24:37.460
audience size.

24:37.460 --> 24:41.060
So that way we have an additional level of transparency, they argue.

24:41.060 --> 24:43.140
You see where this is going.

24:43.140 --> 24:48.020
They argue in short, regulators should push podcasting applications to adhere to the emerging

24:48.020 --> 24:49.980
standards for transparency.

24:49.980 --> 24:54.740
And they have some they recommend, and they've published those.

24:54.740 --> 24:57.900
This is why we've been talking about value for value.

24:57.900 --> 25:00.780
This is why we've been talking about boosts.

25:00.780 --> 25:04.380
Now this is pretty close to me, you know, this is my baby, hold the whole podcasting

25:04.380 --> 25:05.380
thing.

25:05.380 --> 25:06.380
So do you think I'm overreacting, Brent?

25:06.380 --> 25:10.380
Or, you know, you look at all this together, is this maybe time to start taking this a

25:10.380 --> 25:11.380
little more seriously?

25:11.380 --> 25:14.140
I don't feel like you're overreacting at all.

25:14.140 --> 25:19.560
Hearing you read all of that got me like, I don't know, a little scared, I think might

25:19.560 --> 25:20.740
be the word.

25:20.740 --> 25:26.180
Because it feels to me like podcasting was born of an era where everything was so like

25:26.180 --> 25:27.900
stiff and controlled.

25:27.900 --> 25:32.660
And it was finally a way that people could just, you know, you're a perfect example.

25:32.660 --> 25:38.260
People could just, by themselves, record something and share it to, you know, an audience.

25:38.260 --> 25:42.940
And it feels like they're just trying to take that idea and turn it into what was the old

25:42.940 --> 25:43.940
system.

25:43.940 --> 25:46.260
That just feels antithetical to me.

25:46.260 --> 25:51.300
It's like, well, we're just gonna come out with something new then, if that's the case.

25:51.300 --> 25:56.780
And not without a heck of a lot of work and like some pretty combative outcomes, I would

25:56.780 --> 25:57.780
imagine.

25:57.780 --> 25:59.220
So I don't like this at all.

25:59.220 --> 26:05.720
It's also happening right now, when Elon Musk is sort of forced upon the social media world,

26:05.720 --> 26:10.160
this debate about how much free speech is good.

26:10.160 --> 26:15.740
Podcasting I think is born of sort of a free speech absolutism mentality because there's

26:15.740 --> 26:22.060
such selection, there's so many podcasts, that if somebody's a kook, you don't have

26:22.060 --> 26:23.060
to listen to them.

26:23.060 --> 26:24.200
You can go somewhere else.

26:24.200 --> 26:29.820
And I know the argument is, well, the susceptible person might listen to like an Alex Jones

26:29.820 --> 26:32.060
type and get radicalized.

26:32.060 --> 26:33.700
I suppose that is indeed possible.

26:33.700 --> 26:38.420
I know people who have listened to stuff like that and gotten pretty worked up.

26:38.420 --> 26:44.940
But I also think it's sort of not giving folks enough credit for being intelligent and putting

26:44.940 --> 26:48.540
things together on their own and evolving their opinion over time.

26:48.540 --> 26:51.440
And I know we all know people who don't, but we all know people who do as well.

26:51.440 --> 26:54.540
And so it's not really our decision to make.

26:54.540 --> 26:55.760
That's my take on it.

26:55.760 --> 26:58.800
And so I hate to see this kind of stuff come because also it would make running a business

26:58.800 --> 27:00.760
more expensive, no doubt about it.

27:00.760 --> 27:04.200
From a selfish standpoint, it's sort of already a lean operation.

27:04.200 --> 27:10.740
And so having to jump through hoops like disclosing audience information to some, I don't know

27:10.740 --> 27:14.500
whoever it would be, the FCC, I don't know who it would be, but if they're talking about

27:14.500 --> 27:19.640
applying the radio transparency guideline standards for advertising, you have to disclose

27:19.640 --> 27:24.640
your audience reach, your audience size, your revenue, all of that.

27:24.640 --> 27:29.160
And then it seems like you've really opened the door to essentially controlling the speech

27:29.160 --> 27:34.520
of podcasters because not only are you normalizing a method to report them, which is already

27:34.520 --> 27:39.320
shown to be erroneous more often than not on social media and on YouTube, but you're

27:39.320 --> 27:41.480
not really improving upon those systems.

27:41.480 --> 27:43.620
Those systems are essentially flawed.

27:43.620 --> 27:48.920
And I think the fundamental argument for their use is actually in question right now.

27:48.920 --> 27:53.260
And so to just kind of blindly move forward on initiatives like this without ever really

27:53.260 --> 27:59.920
stopping and reevaluating what we've done so far and if it has or has not been successful,

27:59.920 --> 28:02.560
it always strikes me as perhaps there's another motivation.

28:02.560 --> 28:08.780
Because if the motivation was pure and just, then self-reflection would be built in.

28:08.780 --> 28:12.380
And we'd be reflecting on the types of moderation that we've been implementing and what has

28:12.380 --> 28:16.480
been successful and what has failed, what moderation went too far, what moderation didn't

28:16.480 --> 28:21.020
kick in soon enough, and we'd be evaluating that and improving upon it.

28:21.020 --> 28:25.160
And we'd be creating it in a way that was fair for everyone.

28:25.160 --> 28:26.880
But that's not what's happening.

28:26.880 --> 28:31.080
Instead, we're just sort of marching forward with this vague idea that we have to protect

28:31.080 --> 28:34.120
people from misinformation so that way they don't get fooled because they're not smart

28:34.120 --> 28:36.320
enough to figure it out on their own.

28:36.320 --> 28:39.020
And you know, we thought it'd stop on Twitter, but it's not, right?

28:39.020 --> 28:40.800
We've seen it spread to YouTube.

28:40.800 --> 28:43.040
We've seen it spread to all of the other platforms.

28:43.040 --> 28:46.440
We've seen it spread to places that we probably don't even realize it's happening.

28:46.440 --> 28:48.160
Now we're seeing it happen in the podcast space.

28:48.160 --> 28:53.000
And the thing about something like this coming from the Brookings Institute is this is the

28:53.000 --> 29:00.320
scary stuff that happens sort of in the slow kind of creep way, not the flashy propagandized

29:00.320 --> 29:05.560
version by a company that comes out and swings from like their keynote stage.

29:05.560 --> 29:07.860
This is the way DC really works.

29:07.860 --> 29:12.380
And that's what kind of alarms me about this is this is the way you actually get new policy

29:12.380 --> 29:14.760
and regulations, this and money.

29:14.760 --> 29:17.160
But that's how these think tank works to begin with.

29:17.160 --> 29:19.920
So I'll have a link to that in the show notes if you guys are curious.

29:19.920 --> 29:23.960
But that's one of the reasons why why we've been looking for other models and whatnot.

29:23.960 --> 29:25.960
But we are looking for ways to improve to Brent.

29:25.960 --> 29:27.700
You know, it's not just about the monies.

29:27.700 --> 29:32.600
It's also about just making experience better for folks and taking in feedback and input.

29:32.600 --> 29:36.920
And so we've been launching various ways for people to give us that feedback, including

29:36.920 --> 29:39.240
there's a new general questions email.

29:39.240 --> 29:43.080
If something you want to get in front of us for this show, you can send an email to questions

29:43.080 --> 29:47.800
at Jupiter broadcasting dot com or you can use the general comments drop down on the

29:47.800 --> 29:49.180
J.B. contact page.

29:49.180 --> 29:52.560
But Brent, you've been working on a new GitHub page where people can file issues.

29:52.560 --> 29:57.940
Yeah, we've been thinking, geez, there are, you know, both issues that we notice and also

29:57.940 --> 30:03.780
that you as listeners seem to notice and gathering them all in one place sounds like a really

30:03.780 --> 30:04.780
great idea.

30:04.780 --> 30:08.040
And also selfishly, I wanted to learn how to use GitHub because I'm not that well versed

30:08.040 --> 30:09.040
at it.

30:09.040 --> 30:13.520
But I've been setting up in the background a little Jupiter broadcasting, a bunch of

30:13.520 --> 30:19.600
little GitHub projects that you can file bugs against issues, I suppose they call them.

30:19.600 --> 30:22.680
So for instance, I made one public here that we can share right away.

30:22.680 --> 30:24.620
We made one for the matrix server.

30:24.620 --> 30:29.460
So if there's anything going on with the matrix server, including what I'll call feature requests,

30:29.460 --> 30:33.440
you know, if there's a new room idea that you have, that's a perfect place to throw

30:33.440 --> 30:38.320
that in and get our attention and we can easily implement that if we think it's really great.

30:38.320 --> 30:41.960
So I would recommend that people try to use that.

30:41.960 --> 30:46.280
Even if you are not that familiar with GitHub, maybe it's a great way to start getting familiar

30:46.280 --> 30:47.280
like me.

30:47.280 --> 30:51.320
We'll also have various projects for, for instance, the website and maybe some of the

30:51.320 --> 30:52.320
membership stuff.

30:52.320 --> 30:57.420
I know we're having some feed issues sometimes and that's a great place to put that too.

30:57.420 --> 31:02.600
We got a note that came into the show via boost, which we have signed this up for the

31:02.600 --> 31:03.600
boost support.

31:03.600 --> 31:07.100
So if you want to support the show and get your message in, in fact, I'm encouraging

31:07.100 --> 31:10.200
also bug reports over boost, like you got something you've been thinking about the network

31:10.200 --> 31:15.400
should do, should do better, send your criticism, your comments, your concerns over a boost

31:15.400 --> 31:17.520
and we'll get them into the show.

31:17.520 --> 31:22.480
But we got 500 sats from Eric Jr. and he says, I'm glad you guys covered the wise camera

31:22.480 --> 31:25.360
security issues in self hosted 68.

31:25.360 --> 31:26.880
Thanks for looking out for everyone.

31:26.880 --> 31:29.920
I wish we had a good barbecue place in central California.

31:29.920 --> 31:31.760
Now here's my question.

31:31.760 --> 31:36.960
If you know of a great place kind of near the I five corridor from the very tippity

31:36.960 --> 31:42.940
top of California to the very south of California, a place where 30, 40, 50, 80 people could

31:42.940 --> 31:48.560
hang out along that I five corridor of California, send us in a boost or an email questions at

31:48.560 --> 31:50.520
Jupiter broadcasting.com.

31:50.520 --> 31:52.580
Let me know or Chris at Jupiter broadcasting.com.

31:52.580 --> 31:57.720
I don't care how you do it, but I'm looking to collect information on strategic spots

31:57.720 --> 32:01.760
that if we end up doing something down in California, we could have a few spots along

32:01.760 --> 32:06.840
the way where we could meet up with people, do little micro meetups and stuff like that.

32:06.840 --> 32:11.160
Also a lot of boosts about people that are kind of upset that we don't have the ability

32:11.160 --> 32:13.680
to send boosts from the members feeds.

32:13.680 --> 32:17.000
That's a third party service limitation.

32:17.000 --> 32:20.520
They generate that RSS feed, not us.

32:20.520 --> 32:28.080
And as such, we cannot add the value tag, but it really is pissing people off.

32:28.080 --> 32:31.640
And I, you know, you know, I did not expect that the people who are already supporting

32:31.640 --> 32:35.160
us through a membership would then also want to boost.

32:35.160 --> 32:36.160
That's amazing.

32:36.160 --> 32:38.020
They're amazing people and they're awesome.

32:38.020 --> 32:42.140
So we got 5,000 stats from Zach's and he says, I'm a Jupiter signal supporter.

32:42.140 --> 32:45.280
So I get the core contribute other feeds, which are apparently not set up to receive

32:45.280 --> 32:46.280
lightning payments.

32:46.280 --> 32:51.200
Now I've heard you talk about value for value, so I bought some BTC for the first time just

32:51.200 --> 32:55.160
to set this all up, but I was disappointed to have to troubleshoot this.

32:55.160 --> 32:58.280
Eventually I had to subscribe to the main feed just to send this.

32:58.280 --> 33:01.160
I love the shows, but I wanted to let you know, I'd be happy to send a boost from time

33:01.160 --> 33:03.600
to time if you set up lightning for the supporter feeds.

33:03.600 --> 33:05.160
Oh, kills me.

33:05.160 --> 33:07.360
Yeah, it kills me.

33:07.360 --> 33:08.960
He saying, Chris, can I please send you some stats?

33:08.960 --> 33:10.780
And I'm like, no, sorry.

33:10.780 --> 33:14.200
Which is what this whole system was trying to avoid, isn't it?

33:14.200 --> 33:15.200
Yeah.

33:15.200 --> 33:19.320
Again, a problem of centralization with these services is that they control all of this.

33:19.320 --> 33:22.360
And the flip side with some of this is this is what we try to balance.

33:22.360 --> 33:27.320
It's like, well, is managing the member stuff something we really want to balance?

33:27.320 --> 33:32.200
Or do we want to use a service that is known for doing this correctly and securely and

33:32.200 --> 33:38.280
privately and does that part and then generates the feed based on your membership status?

33:38.280 --> 33:40.360
That's the route we decided to go.

33:40.360 --> 33:43.480
And I'm not sure it was the wrong one because I'm not really sure we should be building

33:43.480 --> 33:44.560
our own membership system.

33:44.560 --> 33:45.840
That sounds like a nightmare.

33:45.840 --> 33:47.920
Perhaps there's some way we could do that in the future.

33:47.920 --> 33:49.600
But this is the downside to that kind of stuff.

33:49.600 --> 33:52.680
And those are the trade-offs we're constantly making.

33:52.680 --> 33:59.080
Most of the time, we just sort of go on the self-hosted side and Wes figures it out.

33:59.080 --> 34:00.080
It's true.

34:00.080 --> 34:02.480
Thank goodness for Wes.

34:02.480 --> 34:07.420
But every now and then, we got to help him out and do things like maybe find a provider

34:07.420 --> 34:09.240
who offers a good membership system.

34:09.240 --> 34:11.640
But we got boost from listener in Manchester, too.

34:11.640 --> 34:14.280
But I'm going to save that for the self-hosted podcast because he's in there talking about

34:14.280 --> 34:16.000
a self-hosted stuff.

34:16.000 --> 34:17.000
Thanks everybody in there.

34:17.000 --> 34:22.160
If you'd like to send us a boost, go get yourself a new podcast app at newpodcastapps.com and

34:22.160 --> 34:23.760
then you can boost.

34:23.760 --> 34:24.760
Boost.

34:24.760 --> 34:25.760
That's a robot.

34:25.760 --> 34:26.760
Did you hear it?

34:26.760 --> 34:29.560
I did, but I was trying to identify who it was.

34:29.560 --> 34:30.560
Boost.

34:30.560 --> 34:31.560
I think it's a speak and spell robot.

34:31.560 --> 34:32.560
Oh, really?

34:32.560 --> 34:33.560
Yeah.

34:33.560 --> 34:34.560
Right?

34:34.560 --> 34:35.560
Boost.

34:35.560 --> 34:36.560
It could be.

34:36.560 --> 34:37.560
Yeah, it could be.

34:37.560 --> 34:38.560
Oh, man.

34:38.560 --> 34:39.560
I love it.

34:39.560 --> 34:40.560
I love it.

34:40.560 --> 34:41.560
I love it.

34:41.560 --> 34:42.560
This is just a test episode.

34:42.560 --> 34:47.760
But here's the idea is that fortnightly on a Tuesday, starting next Tuesday, which will

34:47.760 --> 34:56.520
be April 26th, oh man, that's going to be complicated for me, but starting next Tuesday

34:56.520 --> 34:58.840
and then fortnightly after that, we're going to do this show.

34:58.840 --> 35:00.200
I think that's the plan.

35:00.200 --> 35:01.720
We'll have the mumble room working by then.

35:01.720 --> 35:04.160
The server is just down today as we record.

35:04.160 --> 35:11.020
We'll be using the JB chat on the matrix server to do the live chat and we'll talk about things

35:11.020 --> 35:12.020
that we're working on.

35:12.020 --> 35:13.520
We'll talk about some of the projects we have coming up.

35:13.520 --> 35:19.560
I may have firmer details on the JB road trip that we are brewing.

35:19.560 --> 35:22.840
And of course, we'll have your boost and your questions to cover, too.

35:22.840 --> 35:24.400
So that'll be a big part of the show.

35:24.400 --> 35:25.960
I think that's it, Brentley.

35:25.960 --> 35:28.120
I have a question for you as a listener.

35:28.120 --> 35:29.120
Oh, yeah.

35:29.120 --> 35:30.120
Okay.

35:30.120 --> 35:31.120
How's it going to work for guests?

35:31.120 --> 35:32.120
Are you going to have special guests?

35:32.120 --> 35:33.120
Are you going to like?

35:33.120 --> 35:34.120
I think so.

35:34.120 --> 35:38.880
That was one of the reasons I wanted to do this is I wanted to create a platform where

35:38.880 --> 35:43.640
every now and then something that didn't quite fit in the show, you know, could be brought

35:43.640 --> 35:44.640
in and we could chat.

35:44.640 --> 35:45.640
Mm hmm.

35:45.640 --> 35:48.440
Recently, I've been chatting behind the scenes with like a tail scale engineer.

35:48.440 --> 35:49.440
I'd love to kind of pick his brain.

35:49.440 --> 35:52.480
I don't know if there's a particular show that fits on, but I think so.

35:52.480 --> 35:53.760
Are you going to join me next time?

35:53.760 --> 35:54.760
What do you think?

35:54.760 --> 35:55.760
That's my question.

35:55.760 --> 35:59.920
I'm so used to Tuesdays being our sort of sit down and do the podcast day, but I think

35:59.920 --> 36:01.960
I think that might happen more often than not.

36:01.960 --> 36:03.960
Well, you know, my office door is always open.

36:03.960 --> 36:04.960
Oh, that's kind of you.

36:04.960 --> 36:05.960
Thank you.

36:05.960 --> 36:07.960
Although when we record, we should probably close the door.

36:07.960 --> 36:08.960
Yeah.

36:08.960 --> 36:09.960
I don't want to let the horse out.

36:09.960 --> 36:12.320
But I'll be in my office on Tuesdays, at least fortnightly.

36:12.320 --> 36:14.040
So you come in, you join me.

36:14.040 --> 36:18.960
Audiences, welcome to join us live or we'll be publishing this over at office hours dot

36:18.960 --> 36:23.640
hair and you can subscribe at office hours dot hair slash subscribe.

36:23.640 --> 36:25.240
There you go.

36:25.240 --> 36:39.320
Thanks for joining us, everybody.
