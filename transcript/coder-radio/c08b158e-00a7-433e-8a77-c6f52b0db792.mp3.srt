8
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:43,520
My name is Chris, and joining us like the podcasting pioneer that he is for 403 episodes,

9
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,280
it's our host, Mr. Dominic.

10
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:46,280
Hello, Mike.

11
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:47,840
Oh, I'm chilly, Chris.

12
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:48,840
Really?

13
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:49,840
In Florida?

14
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,420
In Florida, it's ice cold.

15
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:56,520
We have Mr. Freeze is here just blasting us with his ice gun.

16
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:57,520
Uh-huh.

17
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,080
It's like 60 degrees Fahrenheit.

18
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:00,080
What is it?

19
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:02,760
It's like 70, but I have a solution to my plight.

20
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:03,760
Okay, good.

21
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:12,720
A way to both warm up my body, my soul, my general spirits, and improve my objective

22
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:13,720
C coding.

23
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:19,960
I am, of course, talking about, for $65, that low, low price, the coder.

24
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:20,960
It's too late.

25
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:21,960
You're too late.

26
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:23,000
You've come over too late.

27
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
It's done.

28
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
The sale is over.

29
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Talk about it.

30
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I bought three of them today.

31
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Yeah.

32
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I turned it off a little bit ago.

33
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,720
I was a little late because I was, you know-

34
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:31,720
What?

35
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:35,880
I thought, you know, let a couple people sneak a few orders in, but we have to cut it off

36
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:39,280
because eventually we have to put the orders in for printing and all that, or actually

37
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,880
it's embroidering.

38
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:44,440
So I just thought of that whole little shtick, and there's no coder robe.

39
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:46,240
I mean, it's technically sold out.

40
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,200
Folks, the robe was a lie.

41
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,480
You never know, though.

42
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:50,480
It could come back.

43
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:51,480
Dun, dun, dun.

44
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:56,560
The thing is, is life is better in a robe, so I don't want to deprive the people of that.

45
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:02,880
Now what we have to do is discover how brutalized we've been by international shipping because

46
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:07,880
I've never done anything like this before ever, and I couldn't get an estimate of how

47
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:11,160
much international shipping would be before we had all the orders in place.

48
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:13,440
They refused to give it to me.

49
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,640
And so I'm just kind of guessing.

50
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:20,320
So at first I put like $10 on there for international shipping, and then I realized that was probably

51
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:22,280
$35 too cheap.

52
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:24,200
So we'll see what happens.

53
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,400
We'll see.

54
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,400
That's a big lesson learned.

55
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:31,360
What we learn from that, I'll probably internalize that, and then we'll have other stuff.

56
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:35,560
We got a request for coasters, too, which I would like another batch of coasters myself.

57
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:39,340
I have two vintage Coderadio coasters on my desk here.

58
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:46,560
But robe aside, which you'll soon be wrapped in its glory, I am kind of getting whiplash.

59
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,980
You're giving me a little bit of anxiety with this switching here.

60
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:52,440
First you're on Windows, then you're on the Mac, and then you're tweeting about being

61
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:57,360
on the Limor again, and it's like three weeks, three different platforms.

62
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,360
My head's spinning.

63
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:07,400
Well, you know, I've been on Tinder for operating systems, and I've just been swiping right.

64
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:11,080
I think this is fun to just chronicle, just to see you jump around a little bit, because

65
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:15,360
I can kind of get a sense of what you're working on, like, okay, so he's taking a break on

66
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,880
whatever it was on the Windows platform for, and he's picked up something that he's using

67
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:19,880
Linux for again.

68
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:21,840
And that's what I grok from afar.

69
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,140
That's what you grok, right?

70
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:27,840
So yes, each platform other than Mac, which is kind of like just doing its own thing,

71
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:34,800
there is a native specific piece of software being written, which I will say that I have

72
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:38,800
thoughts on my brief experience in Windows.

73
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:39,800
So many thoughts.

74
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:42,360
That's, I feel like a whole episode almost in there.

75
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:47,360
Yeah, I think we need to wait until I have all my notes together, but I have thoughts.

76
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,360
Okay.

77
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,440
Well, I did a thing.

78
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:53,680
You know, I started to talk about it last week, but we were all over the place.

79
00:03:53,680 --> 00:04:00,720
I didn't mention it, but I decided to pull the trigger on a 165 Hertz refresh rate monitor.

80
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:01,720
Nice.

81
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:05,400
Quick recap for those of you who are not familiar, I never considered a high refresh rate monitor

82
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:10,080
because I like to play some video games, but I'm not a big, big gamer.

83
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:17,540
But then I ended up reviewing a laptop with a high refresh rate screen in it, and I realized

84
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:20,320
the entire computer UI feels more responsive.

85
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,320
Everything feels faster.

86
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,320
It's not just for games.

87
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:26,760
It turns out obvious statement now that I'm making it, but I had never really connected

88
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,680
the dots until I tried one.

89
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:36,160
After I tried one, I was broken and I've been on a quest to optimize my machine performance

90
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:40,200
at every step that I can without actually replacing the machine because it's just a

91
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:42,680
horrible time to build a PC right now.

92
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:47,320
So I've gone through the route of replacing the kernel with something a little faster,

93
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:49,560
a different fork of it, if you will.

94
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:53,920
I've gone through the process of optimizing the user space a little bit, and now I have

95
00:04:53,920 --> 00:05:02,560
added a 165 Hertz gigabyte M27Q 27 inch 1440p monitor.

96
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:07,800
It's technically a gaming monitor, but Newegg had a fantastic deal on this thing.

97
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:12,200
I decided I'd pull the trigger because of that great deal, and I plugged it in a couple

98
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:17,080
of days ago, and it really feels like everything's coming together.

99
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:21,620
The optimizations I've done to Firefox, the optimizations I did to plasma, the optimizations

100
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:28,880
I did to the Linux kernel, and now with this 170 Hertz, but it's at 165 on my machine,

101
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:29,880
but fine.

102
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:36,520
It's fantastic, plus I haven't got a new monitor in years, many, many years, and so this is

103
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:41,320
like a brilliant, beautiful display, an IPS display, and the freaking UI looks better.

104
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:46,960
Like Firefox looks better, the themes look crisper, the colors are more differentiated.

105
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:50,840
I didn't realize how the gray and blues were all kind of just all mushed together on my

106
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:55,720
old screen, and with this new one, it's like pop, and it looks fantastic, so it's a nice

107
00:05:55,720 --> 00:06:02,800
gear upgrade, and I feel like I'm the happiest I have been with my machine performance since

108
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:10,840
I've owned that thing, and I think it's like a 2017 rig maybe, 2018 maybe at the latest.

109
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:13,480
So what did this beauty cost you?

110
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,480
It was $300.

111
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,720
Well, that's not bad.

112
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:22,560
No, for a 1440p, 170 Hertz, 27-inch monitor with a bunch of different input and an integrated

113
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,560
KVM.

114
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:24,560
Yeah.

115
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,800
That was a great deal.

116
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:29,500
So I plugged it right in, and God bless Plasma.

117
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:34,880
It is supporting multiple refresh rates, so my two side monitors, which I did not replace,

118
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:40,940
are running at 60 Hertz, and the center monitor is running at 165 Hertz, working great.

119
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:42,120
It's fancy, Mike.

120
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:44,360
I really recommend it.

121
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:49,640
That's my performance pro tip is if you're going to really try to get a fast system,

122
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:51,560
don't even bother unless you're upgrading the screen too.

123
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,600
It really made a difference for me.

124
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:56,640
Speaking of pro tips, James writes in with a Zoom pro tip.

125
00:06:56,640 --> 00:07:00,920
He says, hey guys, you were talking about Zoom fatigue last week.

126
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:01,920
It's real.

127
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:09,300
I find a way to counter it is to put a window over my face, cover your face on the screen.

128
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:14,300
For some reason, when we can see ourselves, I've noticed that we subconsciously obsess

129
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:16,720
over the minutia of how we look.

130
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:20,800
It's kind of like a baby laughing at themselves in a mirror, and it gets tiring.

131
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:25,700
In normal conversations, we cannot see ourselves, so we don't really think about how we're looking

132
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:26,920
the entire time.

133
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:31,140
But spending an hour trying to make yourself appear normal is actually exhausting.

134
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:32,140
So give it a go.

135
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:33,700
It actually helps.

136
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:34,700
Cover your face.

137
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:40,680
I was having a conversation with my neighbor over the weekend, and they both, the husband

138
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:43,240
and wife, were complaining about Zoom fatigue.

139
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:47,600
They brought it up, and in fact, it was in the context of this guy was thinking about

140
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:52,640
he wants to pitch his boss an idea, and he thinks he's just going to wait until they're

141
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:58,240
back in person again to pitch him on it because everybody's just tired of Zoom, and he feels

142
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:01,120
like it's actually going to hurt the sale in a sense.

143
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:06,000
I mean, this Zoom fatigue thing, what is the alternative if you're not going to be in the

144
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
office?

145
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Audio calls.

146
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Oh, yeah.

147
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
No, that's my preference.

148
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,720
I mean, like just jump, you know, jump on whatever chat app you use and just use this

149
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:16,040
audio feature and don't turn the camera on.

150
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,480
Why is that so hard?

151
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:20,680
I think a lot of people want to have the camera because they want to try to replicate that,

152
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:21,680
you know?

153
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:26,000
Well, and a lot of corporate workplaces have a camera on policy.

154
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,160
I have seen that.

155
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:31,440
I have seen it where it's like just a reminder like after the meeting or like during the

156
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:36,840
meeting, like in a side chat, just a reminder that we do have a camera on policy.

157
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,880
It's for team morale, you know?

158
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:42,240
I always felt like it's because the meeting is too big, and most of the time, no individual

159
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,400
is really doing anything, so they want to make sure you're not like walking around your

160
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:48,320
kitchen, you know, making your kid lunch or whatever.

161
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:58,160
Well, someone you and I may know, mutually know, friend of the show, and I may have conspired

162
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:04,840
on an idea to create a video loop that we could then feed in as a virtual camera to

163
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:10,000
Zoom of just basically sitting there and nodding, and there was someone who experimented.

164
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:16,720
He created pre-canned responses with transitions that he could hit a button on his keyboard

165
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:20,800
and it would be like just a standard meeting response.

166
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:21,800
Copy that.

167
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:22,800
Yeah, that's a great idea.

168
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:27,440
Yeah, we can circle back on that, you know, just those kinds of pre-canned stuff, and

169
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,440
he got away with it for a week.

170
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,240
He made a whole video about it on YouTube.

171
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,240
Circle back, circle back.

172
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,240
Sorry.

173
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,160
It's so bad, though.

174
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:36,160
It really is.

175
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:40,200
It really is pretty awful, so a good pro tip is cover yourself up.

176
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,360
I thought maybe it was just me.

177
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:47,000
I thought maybe because I was vain or because, like, what I get fixated on is the camera

178
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:52,880
shot and the background, and I want there to be depth, and I want there to be color,

179
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:56,440
and I try to frame it properly, and I don't really actually want to be in the center,

180
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:59,480
but I like being off the center, but like all these stupid things that just don't work

181
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:01,840
well in a Zoom call, and that's me.

182
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:02,840
I'm that guy.

183
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,160
I'm that guy.

184
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:09,040
I've never understood, but I know it's a thing, the hatred of like just traditional

185
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,040
conference calls.

186
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:13,120
Like even if you're doing them on Zoom, right, whatever.

187
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,080
And then, I'm going to say it.

188
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:21,340
This is my spicy take for the show, I guess, but it is apparently completely socially acceptable

189
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:26,440
to comment on men's appearance in a Zoom call because during the pandemic, I didn't get

190
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,440
my hair cut.

191
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:31,360
I didn't feel like it was worth going to—for a while, you couldn't here in Washington,

192
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,360
and then even once you could—

193
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,360
You couldn't get your hair cut?

194
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,360
Yeah.

195
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:35,360
Huh?

196
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,360
Oh, Florida's the land of the free.

197
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,360
Just keep going.

198
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,360
Well, now you can.

199
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:43,920
I am now getting my hair cut, but I went for about a year-ish, almost a year without getting

200
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,000
my hair cut.

201
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,120
And it got pretty long, you know, down well past my shoulders even.

202
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:54,160
And every Zoom call I would get on would start with people commenting on my hair growing

203
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,160
out.

204
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:58,560
You know, after the first week or two, you're like, huh, yeah, yeah, yeah, my hair is getting

205
00:10:58,560 --> 00:10:59,560
long.

206
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:02,400
But then after like six months of it, you start thinking, can we just stop commenting

207
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,400
on how I appear?

208
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:06,780
Like I don't really like that to be the topic of conversation is my appearance.

209
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:10,440
And I wasn't like particularly confident about the look.

210
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:13,080
I felt kind of awkward about it myself.

211
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:19,500
And it was apparently totally fine because it happened by all genders and all types would

212
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:22,320
just decide to comment about my hair.

213
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:26,480
And I would never start a conversation like that, you know, and you don't generally start

214
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:29,240
in-person conversations like that either.

215
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:34,560
And that was an aspect of the Zoom meetings that I found to be tiring, you know, in a

216
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:35,560
sense.

217
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:37,920
I mean, I've been sexual harassing you for eight years.

218
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:42,480
So yeah, but that's, you know, that's not really different because it's not really harassment

219
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,480
when I'm asking for it.

220
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:44,480
Oh, my God.

221
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,480
Yeah.

222
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:48,080
Remember how you were worried about YouTube?

223
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:51,880
Paul writes in with a with a question that I can connect with.

224
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:57,280
He says, Valhalla guys, a longtime C and C sharp guy, I've recently started digging into

225
00:11:57,280 --> 00:12:05,700
Valhalla and some slight tooling issues aside, I'm thoroughly enjoying the language so far.

226
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:09,980
It feels like if C sharp had been dropped on C's door as a baby.

227
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:15,080
But where do you see these more niche languages taking part in, say, paid work?

228
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:19,800
I'm not so much concerned about it while I'm an active maintainer, but more so down the

229
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:23,720
road should the relationship dissolve for context, you know, take a look at something

230
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:29,000
like an L.O.B. application, so a line of business application, so something that he would have

231
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,560
to hand off potentially.

232
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:36,380
What are your thoughts on using something like Valhalla, which is, as he puts it, one

233
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:40,700
of the more niche languages in something where somebody is actually cutting you a big old

234
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:43,860
check for some line of business application?

235
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:44,860
In Valhalla?

236
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:45,860
Yeah.

237
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:50,600
Or, you know, insert the name of any niche, not widely used, but loved language.

238
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:55,640
I mean, if you manage to sell someone Valhalla, which that's not me taking a shot at Valhalla,

239
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:56,640
great.

240
00:12:56,640 --> 00:13:04,020
The question is, is it, I don't know about moral, but is it the wrong thing to do to

241
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:06,880
leave somebody with something that's hard to support after the fact?

242
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:09,360
I mean, everything is hard to support after the fact.

243
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,360
Yeah.

244
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:14,080
I mean, Valhalla is not a particularly esoteric language.

245
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:19,240
I know it's not that popular, but if you know a little bit of C sharp or Java, you're probably

246
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,960
going to get it.

247
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:24,920
I think it's the default language that the elementary OS guys use for their application

248
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:25,920
development.

249
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:26,920
Oh yeah.

250
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:27,920
I don't know.

251
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:28,920
I think it's a fine choice.

252
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:34,440
I mean, people write stuff in all kinds of stupid languages like Go and PHP.

253
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:39,400
I'll tell you though, I have back in my bad old days of contracting, I have rocked up

254
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:44,000
to an organization, walked in like, Mr. I'm going to fix it and log into their system

255
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:50,320
and discover it's like some crazy old Red Hat box or BSD box that some esoteric setup

256
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:56,300
this guy has done that is a complete like dream setup that he had, but something that's

257
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:59,140
almost completely unmaintainable by me.

258
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:04,120
And so often those kinds of situations leave the end user with no other option than paying

259
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:06,200
somebody like me to come in and just replace it.

260
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:11,320
I just don't see the problem with if it solves, if whatever solution you have solves their

261
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:12,320
problem.

262
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,320
Right.

263
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:17,160
But if you're knowing that you're using this thing called Vala, then that's fine.

264
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:18,440
How do you even disclose something like that?

265
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:20,080
Like, Hey, yeah, I got this idea.

266
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:22,680
It's going to do everything you want, but it is used.

267
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:26,520
Just so you know, it's using a niche programming language.

268
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:27,520
Yeah.

269
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:28,520
I think that's what scare them away.

270
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:29,520
Don't you?

271
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:30,520
Well, that's the risk you take, right?

272
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:31,520
I mean, that's, yeah.

273
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:36,080
I mean, personally, I would pitch objective, see every opportunity I got.

274
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:41,560
Actually, I think your point though is it's the client's risk to accept and if they accept

275
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:42,720
the risk, then go for it.

276
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:43,720
Right.

277
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:47,840
Like if you didn't tell them that this was a risk, then that, then, I mean, I don't know,

278
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:48,840
I'm not a lawyer.

279
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:54,760
Maybe that's still okay, but it seems sort of jerky, but I mean, I don't know whenever

280
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:57,840
I bid a contract out, we actually just have a piece of paper that lists the technologies

281
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,300
we intend to use.

282
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:00,440
And West makes a great point too.

283
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:04,200
It's going to depend on what other technologies they have in place.

284
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:06,480
Are they already using multiple languages?

285
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:10,800
Do they have an engineer in house who has a preference?

286
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:16,360
Also something else you could do is look to see if there's someone who could replace you.

287
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:18,520
No, no, I wouldn't do that.

288
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:19,520
Yeah.

289
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:21,720
Mark in the chat room is mentioning visual Fox pro.

290
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:25,200
I have a project where I'm migrating things out of visual Fox pro right now and it needs

291
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,200
to die.

292
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:30,520
See, that's what I'm thinking is it could be that situation with something like this.

293
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:31,520
Yeah.

294
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:33,020
It's a, it's a goddamn nightmare, but.

295
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:36,400
So I think really the answer is though, is it's the client's decision to make and then

296
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:41,520
it's the challenges is you've got to explain to them how to mitigate the risk and why it's

297
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:43,520
worth that risk.

298
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:48,240
And you know, I give, if you can't articulate that reason, maybe it's not the right tool

299
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,400
for the job to begin with.

300
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:50,400
Right.

301
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:53,880
And in your particular case of Vala, Vala is not like, I don't know, closure.

302
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:54,880
Sorry.

303
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:57,120
I was that, you know, normal developers can't comprehend.

304
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,600
You have to come down from the mountain.

305
00:15:58,600 --> 00:15:59,600
I love it.

306
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:00,600
Okay.

307
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:01,600
Unnecessary.

308
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:05,440
Maybe I'm still starting from that seven week challenge.

309
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,920
All right.

310
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:13,240
Well, Link wrote in and wanted to get your take on a hot take that, uh, Drew DeVault,

311
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:18,240
not the Drew that edits this show, but Drew DeVault, a, a, a developer of, uh, I think

312
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:21,860
sway, um, and a bunch of, a bunch of open source projects.

313
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:26,880
And he writes in that the rust is, well, it has issues.

314
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:30,880
I guess he breaks it down into kind of three major areas and I'll give you the highlights

315
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:31,880
here.

316
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:37,660
The first is rust breaks a lot of stuff and in ways that are difficult to fix the rust

317
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:44,160
cargo cult needs to pause and reevaluate switching to rust breaks things for anyone who steps

318
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:53,120
even a toe out of the norm of Linux Mac windows on x86 64 or arm 64, even on supported platforms.

319
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:58,280
It comes with a substantial burden of build requirements calling for 10 times to a hundred

320
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:01,560
times of more Ram CPU time and power usage.

321
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:07,440
Other benefits choosing rust is ultimately choosing to lock a large group of people out

322
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:11,800
of your project and dooming many more to struggle with frustration.

323
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:16,560
These are real trade-offs that you need to consider rewrite in rust has become a moral

324
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:17,560
imperative.

325
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:21,560
Well, here's another moral argument, throwing away serviceable components every couple of

326
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:27,400
years to upgrade is a privilege that not all of your users have, and it contributes to

327
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:30,840
climate change and it fills up landfills.

328
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:36,360
Lurking your code in rust is always going to introduce new bugs, including security

329
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:40,560
bugs that wouldn't be there if you just maintain the C code.

330
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:45,200
Maybe there's an undiscovered bug lurking in your C code base, but as your code base

331
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:50,520
ages under continuous maintenance, that number will only shrink.

332
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:56,320
A working C tool chain can be written in a couple tens of thousands of lines of code.

333
00:17:56,320 --> 00:18:04,640
The only working rust tool chain is tens of millions of lines of C++ and rust code.

334
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:08,600
Rust is kind of cool, but it's not a panacea.

335
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:14,200
There are legitimate reasons to prefer C, both technical and moral, and rust still needs

336
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:19,720
a lot of work before it's ready for primetime and systems which prioritize stability, reliability,

337
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:22,140
simplicity, and accessibility.

338
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:27,920
To the Rust team, it's time to calm down, slow down the language, write a specification,

339
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:32,680
focus on improving your tier 2 and tier 3 targets, expand to more platforms, and work

340
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:36,200
on performance, stability, and accessibility.

341
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:47,200
That's a lot in there.

342
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:53,280
He does make a quick mention of Power9 and RISC-V.

343
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,640
So there's a bit of irony here.

344
00:18:54,640 --> 00:19:00,480
One of our topics for today is why me and my team chose C++ over Rust just this week,

345
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:03,160
which has a lot to do with some of these complaints.

346
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:05,640
I think Drew has a point.

347
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:08,760
Maybe he's being a little unfair to the Rust team.

348
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:10,800
I don't think they're claiming it's a panacea.

349
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:16,340
I don't think they're claiming make a cargo package and you've solved all your technical

350
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:19,080
problems for the remainder of your life.

351
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:24,160
I tweeted out that I was looking at just doing something in C++ instead, and there's quite

352
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:30,760
a bit of like, that will be insecure, you should do it in Rust to avoid insert memory

353
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:35,420
issue here, which I guess is kind of true.

354
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:41,320
I don't think the benefits of Rust are as overstated as the writer seems to think.

355
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:44,720
And if I'm misreading you, Drew, that's my fault.

356
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:50,560
But I definitely can see that it is, I mean, comparing it to C or C++, they've been around

357
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:52,080
forever.

358
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:57,480
They have decent compilers and compatibility with insert your crazy architecture here.

359
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:01,120
You mentioned RISC-V, not that crazy, but fair enough.

360
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:05,600
C++ works just fine on it, and of course, C that you mentioned.

361
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:09,600
I don't know that I would want to discourage people from learning Rust.

362
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:14,360
Even as a teaching tool, Rust actually does enforce some pretty good, I don't know if

363
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:18,640
I want to say concepts or patterns, but pretty good ways of thinking about handling memory

364
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:21,080
and how you should think about your code.

365
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:23,480
I sort of wouldn't want to discourage people from looking at it.

366
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:24,480
Does that make sense?

367
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,020
Yeah, it does.

368
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:31,560
And I think I agree with your take that a lot of what he points to as challenges with

369
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:37,320
Rust when it comes to platform support is inherently because it is still so young.

370
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:41,040
And with time, so will come that support.

371
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:45,360
I think it's also very likely that that's where the puck is skating.

372
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:50,920
It's obvious that over time, Rust will probably stitch up its RISC-V support and its power

373
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:51,920
support.

374
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:56,880
I don't think that's going to be an issue long term if there ends up being a large deployment

375
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,240
of those platforms.

376
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:02,760
It is in that stage right now, especially something like RISC-V. There's really only

377
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:08,200
one developer board in like a Raspberry Pi style SBC that you can get your hands on right

378
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,200
now.

379
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:12,560
That's going to change, but it's still early days.

380
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:16,480
There's really only one or two workstations that have power chips in them that you can

381
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:19,840
get your hands on these days, and they're very expensive.

382
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:24,560
OS News just posted a really interesting review of one that is kind of like just a desktop

383
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:25,560
tower.

384
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:30,360
It looks very accessible with AMD graphics in it, and it's a PowerPC processor in that

385
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:31,360
one.

386
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:32,360
That's awesome.

387
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:33,360
That looks really interesting to me.

388
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:38,680
And I absolutely would expect that as I got more and more outside the mainstream platforms,

389
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:42,740
there would be less and less support, especially in something as new as Rust.

390
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:49,680
But it was kind of refreshing to see another take, a little real talk around Rust.

391
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:50,680
Yeah.

392
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:56,380
I mean, I would say a more boring, practical code or radio criticism of Rust would be,

393
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:58,720
you may not be Microsoft or Amazon.

394
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:01,640
You may need to hire developers that you can actually get.

395
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:05,760
Not that you're hiring bad developers, but you're hiring developers who did not go to

396
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,040
MIT.

397
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:14,080
And Rust, your average 22-year-old coming out of college with a Comp Sci degree will

398
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:15,960
probably be eaten alive by Rust.

399
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:16,960
Yeah.

400
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,920
And the interest and the momentum sure is there.

401
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:19,920
Yeah.

402
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:20,920
I hope I'm wrong.

403
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:29,680
Please, if you're 22 and in the Tampa area and love your Rust, it should be an email.

404
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:31,320
Linode.com slash coder.

405
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:35,440
Go there to receive a $100 60-day credit towards your new account.

406
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,920
Linode's where we host everything for JB 3.0.

407
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:42,160
Well, they're also the largest independent cloud out there for developers.

408
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:43,380
Simplify your cloud infrastructure.

409
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:45,600
Take a look at Linode with that $100 credit.

410
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:49,560
Get an idea of what it can do and get an idea of why we've chosen Linode.

411
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:53,760
They've got 11 data centers around the world, so there's a lot of locations to work with,

412
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:56,640
something near you or your customers and clients.

413
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,760
40-gigabit connections coming into the machines.

414
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:03,160
Of course, super-fast native SSDs on all of the hypervisors.

415
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:07,280
And they have a really great, really great dashboard with lots of nice documentation,

416
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:08,280
alerts, monitoring.

417
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:09,920
I mean, you name it.

418
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:14,340
I talk about it from time to time, but they also have a great selection of one-click deployments.

419
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:20,480
If you want to get a base system with container support going or a fast WordPress setup, they

420
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:26,120
have a lot of really nice, just get your website up and going, get that part figured out fast.

421
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:29,560
Or you can do like what we do and just build stuff out over time.

422
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:33,720
Get something that's really powerful and then run all of your applications on just a couple

423
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:35,400
of really powerful machines.

424
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:38,080
And then for the backend storage, what we use is their object storage.

425
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:42,360
They have an S3-compatible object storage that's just fantastic because you don't have

426
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:45,480
to slice off large sections of disk, which you totally can.

427
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:49,200
You can go the traditional block storage route and just slice off some disk.

428
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:53,820
But with object storage, I just use what I need, and then I can get URLs for everything

429
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:56,320
and there's ways to plug it in with the file system.

430
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:58,880
It just works fantastic.

431
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:02,760
And all of this, it's at your fingertips to try.

432
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:06,480
You can try it right now by going to linode.com slash coder and build yourself something,

433
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:09,740
something simple or something you can really dig into.

434
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:15,400
And then you can rest easy knowing that you have great support backing all of it up.

435
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:19,520
Linode has top-notch support, like nobody does it like Linode.

436
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:23,120
And that's comforting when you're running your business infrastructure on there.

437
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:27,000
And you can also rest assured knowing that they started in 2003 as one of the first companies

438
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,800
in cloud computing.

439
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:32,640
And they have focused in on a handful of things that they do.

440
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:35,220
And they do those things very well.

441
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:37,720
They're not like some sort of crazy VC funded startup.

442
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:41,560
They're just going to go nuts trying to get market share and do every little thing.

443
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:43,480
They've really figured out what works.

444
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:46,600
And they're independently owned and they're founded on a love for Linux and the technology

445
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:49,420
that made all of this cloud computing possible.

446
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:56,720
And now they're the largest cloud offering dedicated virtualization with CPU systems,

447
00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:01,280
GPU systems, shared systems at like $5 a month and much more.

448
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:03,180
There's something that's going to work for everybody.

449
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:08,280
So support the show and get that $100 credit when you go to linode.com slash coder.

450
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:12,680
That's linode.com slash coder.

451
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:14,800
The privacy wars rage on.

452
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:22,800
The hoopla is filled with, I guess, the next phase of where all of this is going.

453
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:27,000
Facebook, this is according to inc.com, has just admitted that it has lost the privacy

454
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,040
war with Apple.

455
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:34,080
This all goes back to those privacy nutrition labels that you kind of changed my mind on

456
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:40,040
a few weeks ago and how Google and Facebook have been really struggling with this.

457
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:45,000
Google just today updated Gmail for the first time since these privacy labels have gone

458
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,960
into effect.

459
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:53,680
And Facebook has tried to take its fight public, trying to go after Apple in the public space.

460
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:54,680
Have you seen all this?

461
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:55,680
Yeah.

462
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:58,040
So how would that work?

463
00:25:58,040 --> 00:25:59,240
So they're doing a couple of things.

464
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:05,280
They're trying to frame this as Apple harming small business and they've released an ad

465
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:08,760
and I'll just give you a taste of like one of their strategies.

466
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:14,080
For every idea out there that gets the love it should, there are five more that don't

467
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:19,560
succeed and so are lost for good and some of them are pretty flawed and some of them

468
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:20,720
are slightly odd.

469
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:26,680
But many are small businesses that simply lack the tool to find excited people who will

470
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:28,800
stop and say, that's cool.

471
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:34,280
And these two, they like this idea and those three like that one and that's because personalized

472
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:38,600
ads find good ideas for everyone.

473
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:45,920
So the idea is that Apple is preventing small business users from reaching potential new

474
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:50,240
customers by limiting how Facebook can track you.

475
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,240
That was Orwellian.

476
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:53,240
Isn't that something?

477
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:54,320
That was really bad.

478
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:59,800
Let's just be frank, like what Facebook is worried about and is pushing back against

479
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:06,760
is if the end user is given a choice, if they want to be tracked or not, they know the end

480
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:09,200
user is going to say, don't track me.

481
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:15,240
And small businesses don't need to know your specific location, your gender, your age.

482
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:20,840
Really if you think about it from a small business marketing standpoint, just pick a

483
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:26,600
Facebook group that matches what your product serves and advertise to that Facebook group.

484
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:28,160
You don't even need to know any of that crap.

485
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:30,600
Just figure it out by the groups they hang out in.

486
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:36,320
So I guess I don't understand how Facebook could think this would work.

487
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:41,020
I'm trying to see like the galaxy brain 3D chess move now because Apple's got him because

488
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:46,180
it's not Apple is it's not Apple's fault that telling people how these apps are tracking

489
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:49,320
them damages Facebook's business model.

490
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:51,860
That is the flaw of Facebook's business model.

491
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:55,320
It seems a lot like the cigarette companies being pissed at the government want to put

492
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:56,960
labels on cigarettes, right?

493
00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:02,320
We saw Google, you know, Google resisting it to just finally updating Gmail today.

494
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:03,320
After what?

495
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:04,800
Like two, three months?

496
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:05,960
Yeah.

497
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:10,320
So in general, I think we have a problem of too many, like behemoths in the world, you

498
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:13,560
know, striding across and crushing the little guys.

499
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:15,640
I sort of just want Apple to win here.

500
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:19,840
Yeah, it's weird because it does put Apple in the well, because like the problem is Facebook's

501
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:25,360
business model is like not awesome for society, right?

502
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:30,440
I think we have a problem with tracking in general, and this is the beginning of that

503
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:31,440
conversation.

504
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:32,440
But I don't know.

505
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:34,960
We used to rant and rave about paying for stuff, right?

506
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:38,600
Like for years and years and years beyond here, like people need to pay for software,

507
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:40,320
but that battle's kind of been lost.

508
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,320
Well, all right.

509
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:42,320
I don't think either.

510
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:45,760
I mean, all of us are just, I just, it's almost just worth noting at this point, I think just

511
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:48,320
so we have it here in the record of the show, but I don't really know if we have much more

512
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:49,560
to say about it.

513
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:53,600
I want to switch instead to your Stadia, your Stadia version of Terraria.

514
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:59,040
Now this whole thing, this whole thing is spooky because this developer got all pissed

515
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:05,860
and rage quit his port to Stadia after Google suspended his account and then just basically

516
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:11,280
ghosted him and did not respond to any of his series of tweets or emails that he sent

517
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:13,100
in trying to get access to his account.

518
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:14,700
His business was impacted by this.

519
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:17,320
His Google apps account was impacted by this.

520
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:19,160
And then afterwards he was so frustrated, he said, that's it.

521
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:20,160
I give up.

522
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:22,800
I'm not going to develop for Stadia anymore.

523
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:29,160
While a Google spokesperson has confirmed to the verge that the Terraria port is back

524
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:30,600
in development.

525
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:34,440
So I did some digging and I could not find what the hell actually happened here.

526
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:35,440
Yeah.

527
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,440
Then he just got shut down.

528
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:37,440
Like, but no reason why, right?

529
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:38,440
Right.

530
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:42,600
And he's not saying, I mean, I'm sure they told him why, but at some point before bringing

531
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:43,600
him back.

532
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:46,480
So this is kind of where you were going with the Facebook thing is like, we have these

533
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:51,480
weird centralizations now of control that we knew were coming all along.

534
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:55,680
We're not surprised that it's here, but it is legitimately backfiring in the ways that

535
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:56,680
we were concerned about.

536
00:29:56,680 --> 00:30:00,080
Like before the, you and I started recording today, I was telling you that this is a huge

537
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:04,240
concern of mine because I would be shut out of my business.

538
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:06,240
Certain aspects of my business would be shut down.

539
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:10,860
And I hear so many of these stories where you just can't get Google's attention.

540
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:12,320
This guy got lucky.

541
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:17,920
I guess, you know, it percolated up enough that a human saw it and took action.

542
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:24,600
But you know, if you don't have an audience, if you don't have a reach, you're screwed.

543
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:30,080
You know, I feel like we've done eight years of talking about big tech monopolies, app

544
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:31,680
stores and data tracking.

545
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:34,680
I hate to say this, but it's kind of getting dystopian.

546
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:36,040
It doesn't seem like it's gone well.

547
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:40,680
I find myself more and more wishing for the dream of the nineties web where it'd be like,

548
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:46,160
you know, Mike would have Mike.com Chris would have Chris.com and like we would just sell

549
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:50,480
our crap in our own domains and like, yes, we'd have to write all of our payment processing

550
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:56,640
and customer management stuff ourselves or by God forbid license, you know, some independent

551
00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:02,360
platform to do that for us instead of being on these gigantic centralized app stores that

552
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:08,420
just not even because they're evil, but because of their massive scale can't help but screwing

553
00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:11,120
over the little guy.

554
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:14,600
Not even with malice, but with just like inefficiency at scale like that, right?

555
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:19,120
If there's a giant Colossus stroming in Athens, he's going to step on Socrates every once

556
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:20,120
in a while.

557
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:24,280
I've been thinking about this recently too, because I heard, um, I heard somebody talking

558
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:28,920
about how, uh, they could only launch, you know, they were going to launch this business

559
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:32,720
idea, but they were only going to launch once the app, once the app was ready to go.

560
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:35,520
And then somebody said, so are you going to, why don't you launch on the web?

561
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:37,560
Oh no, no, that's later if we do that.

562
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:41,800
And then I started thinking about Instagram and what a impact it's had culturally.

563
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:47,440
And you know, the sale of course to Facebook and, and how Instagram has become this phenomenon

564
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:51,880
that every social media influencer has to be on Instagram.

565
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:56,720
And it's all an app, you know, it has a web version, but it really, really, really sucks.

566
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:57,720
It doesn't do much.

567
00:31:57,720 --> 00:32:00,120
There was an intern for like a day and a half.

568
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:01,120
Yes.

569
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:02,120
Yeah.

570
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:05,720
And that entire phenomenon is an app in these app stores.

571
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:12,840
And it really struck me that the scale at which these app stores have now, I don't know

572
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:18,180
if this is true or not, but I saw a statistic from what was supposedly a Facebook financial

573
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:22,920
call that something like only 4% of their traffic comes from web.

574
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:27,440
And the rest is all app based, which just seems outrageous.

575
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:29,080
That's just outrageous.

576
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:31,960
You look at everything that's happening with these apps or policies and how these businesses

577
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:38,520
are struggling like Epic, and you wonder why we didn't just invest more in the web.

578
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:43,600
And I've often heard it blamed on Apple because Apple wants to have the app store be successful,

579
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:48,520
but mobile Safari was one of the most, if not the most competitive mobile web browser

580
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:49,520
to begin with.

581
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:53,720
And it's continued to remain very competitive and adding features.

582
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:58,580
And it doesn't seem like Apple is crippling the capabilities of its web browser.

583
00:32:58,580 --> 00:33:02,120
Some people have written in and said, arguably Apple could do some things to improve it.

584
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:03,640
And maybe they will.

585
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:04,640
I don't buy that.

586
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:08,880
I don't think iPhone Safari is nerfed enough to really.

587
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,400
I think it all could have been on the web.

588
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:15,360
You know, I've been thinking about if I got more into video again, I'd really like to

589
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:21,920
publish it on JupiterTube, which is a PeerTube instance that we're running off of Linode.

590
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:23,960
And there's no algorithm.

591
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:28,440
There's no YouTube clickbait system you have to do to get views.

592
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:32,880
There's no having to ask people to like and subscribe.

593
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:33,880
Hit the bell button.

594
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:34,880
None of that.

595
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:35,880
It's just our own video platform.

596
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:38,040
And the only thing that's on there is Jupiter broadcasting videos.

597
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:42,560
We're live streaming on there right now on Monday night.

598
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:48,380
And it will always just be a silo because it doesn't have that network effect because

599
00:33:48,380 --> 00:33:49,920
it isn't YouTube.

600
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:57,560
You know, things get 80 views maybe, and there is a real notable reduction in traffic.

601
00:33:57,560 --> 00:34:00,560
Okay, so this is Mike's crazy conspiracy theory.

602
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:07,160
I think what happened is the Web 2.0 stuff, you know, when like people were really doing

603
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:13,600
interactive websites like in the, I don't know, the early aughts, I guess, didn't get

604
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:18,320
enough time to get off its feet until the iPhone came out.

605
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:24,000
And I mean, yeah, like the I think about the businesses that started as like iOS development

606
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:31,880
shops would have probably been web development shops, similar kind of mix of people, right?

607
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:32,880
Designers and developers.

608
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:38,680
Do you think it's at all notable that like Clubhouse, which is the social media network

609
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:42,000
with the most buzz at the moment, is iOS only?

610
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,000
Well, I think, right.

611
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,000
That's what I'm getting.

612
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:49,520
I think there's multiple bad trends that happened to one just like we've spent years talking

613
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:55,480
about this, the lessening of people's willingness to pay both by volume and by just actual sticker

614
00:34:55,480 --> 00:35:01,160
price on platforms that aren't iOS or Mac is pretty significant.

615
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:04,440
And even then, on those platforms, people aren't willing to pay now very much.

616
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:05,440
Sure.

617
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:08,320
My issue with this conversation is I don't know how we could get back.

618
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:09,320
Right.

619
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:12,320
I don't think we can.

620
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:14,360

638
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:26,280
Datadog.com slash Coder Radio.

639
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:31,100
All right, so you teased this a little bit in the show, and I'm hoping this is going

640
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:33,600
to pick us up, you know, because now we got kind of grumpy.

641
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:35,760
We got into old man radio.

642
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:41,960
And I feel like if you are making a bold statement, like going with C++ in 2021, there's going

643
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:44,120
to be some real meat to this one.

644
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:45,220
There's going to be some spice.

645
00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:46,360
So you're on the spot.

646
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:47,360
You cannot disappoint.

647
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:48,360
All right.

648
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:51,080
So there was a journey here.

649
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:54,440
So my goal is to launch a product at least every year now.

650
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:58,840
So this year we're doing something new, more to come on that, ding, ding.

651
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:04,580
But it requires some low level Linuxy goodness, which one means system 76 will probably somehow

652
00:37:04,580 --> 00:37:09,440
get more money because that's just what happens.

653
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:16,040
And it also means that I couldn't just Python my way to glory.

654
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:17,620
So there's a progression here, right?

655
00:37:17,620 --> 00:37:23,680
So speccing out this project, it needs to hit multiple processor architectures, technically

656
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:28,440
multiple OSs, but really the meat and potatoes here is Linux.

657
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:32,480
And I would tell you which flavor of Linux, but I don't want to trigger you.

658
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:33,960
I think I already know.

659
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:34,960
I'll give you one guess.

660
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:35,960
Yeah, I don't.

661
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:36,960
I know.

662
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:39,380
I don't want to say its name out loud because then I get Twitter trolls.

663
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:41,000
But we have new listeners in the chat room.

664
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,000
We should tell them.

665
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,880
You should spread the good news.

666
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:48,320
The good news of Suze, although they will correct me.

667
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:51,320
The Germans will email me, it's Suza.

668
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:52,560
And do not get that wrong.

669
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:55,020
Get the hell out of here.

670
00:37:55,020 --> 00:37:59,600
So for the new listeners, I am in the arduous process of building a data center in Plant

671
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:02,400
City that exclusively runs Suza.

672
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:03,400
You okay, Kristinita?

673
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:04,400
I mean, I'm breathing.

674
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:05,400
I'm practicing my breathing.

675
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:06,400
I'm trying.

676
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:09,440
I heard there was some lizard talk on Linux Unplugged, by the way.

677
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:11,320
It happens from time to time.

678
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:12,360
We slip into it.

679
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:13,400
Everybody does accidentally.

680
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:17,400
You just need a green panic button, and I can just show up and be like, what's going

681
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:18,400
on, guys?

682
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:23,160
I did have a Suza bell at one point, but it didn't ding real well, so we got rid of it.

683
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:25,840
If you haven't tried Suza for your servers, you are missing out.

684
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:27,000
That's all I'm going to say.

685
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,480
And I'll leave it there.

686
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:29,480
All right.

687
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:34,800
So we looked at Python and Cython, I guess it's CXC Python, I don't know.

688
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:38,040
CY, you know what I'm talking about, if you know anything about Python.

689
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:39,040
Yeah.

690
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:42,200
And it was like, ugh, okay, kind of slow.

691
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:44,160
I mean, and we're basically now a Python shop.

692
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:47,640
We love Python, but it's like, ugh, really?

693
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:50,920
Some of these are going to be smaller, more, I hate the term IoT, but-

694
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:51,920
Low end.

695
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:52,920
I guess IoT is fair.

696
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:57,240
Yeah, low end devices, and the hardware cost is something I need to track.

697
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:58,240
Are they ARM?

698
00:38:58,240 --> 00:38:59,720
Oh, yes, they are.

699
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:00,720
Yeah, okay.

700
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:03,720
But it also has to run on AMD 64, right, and X86.

701
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:04,720
All right.

702
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:08,600
Then we've been doing.NET for a couple of clients right now.

703
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:12,600
More on that in a couple of weeks, at least on my new adventures in WSL.

704
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:21,960
And it was like, well,.NET is open source now, and it runs everywhere, but it's.NET.

705
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:26,480
So I did kind of a quick POC fooling around with C Sharp.

706
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:27,480
It worked.

707
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:28,480
Yeah.

708
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:34,120
But then you had to like cross compile to Linux, which worked.

709
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:37,960
There's a lot of like extra setup that would have had to be done.

710
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:40,880
And one of the inconvenient things, and I actually have a blog post about this in the

711
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:44,040
show notes where I kind of detail some of this stuff out.

712
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:50,400
We are basically a Linux shop now, but running mostly POP with like a few straggling, like

713
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:52,720
we have Macs for when we have to test iOS stuff.

714
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:57,320
I got to be careful how I say this because people will jump down my throat.

715
00:39:57,320 --> 00:40:04,400
The.NET development experience on Linux in particular is not as good as it is on Windows.

716
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:06,360
I don't think that's a controversial statement, right?

717
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:07,360
Seems like it makes sense.

718
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:08,360
Yeah.

719
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:12,120
And it's better than it's ever been, but like it's nothing near as smooth as let's say our

720
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:14,560
Python development workflows, right?

721
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:15,560
Oh, sure.

722
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:16,560
Yeah, sure.

723
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:17,560
Yeah.

724
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:18,560
Right.

725
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:19,560
So it's like, eh, this feels kind of icky.

726
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:22,120
And also there's the whole like we have to run things in the CLR and it's like, eh, this

727
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:24,280
is really how we want to architect this.

728
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:28,960
So then there were two other languages in content or three, there was Go, but Go got

729
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:32,480
dismissed because nobody on the team has done any Go.

730
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:38,520
And it's like, there's not even like one granddad who can come in and like guide us all to glory.

731
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:41,000
So that's that, you know, that makes a big difference.

732
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:45,440
You need team, especially at least one person on the team that you think could at least

733
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:47,200
train everybody else, right?

734
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:51,440
But if nobody's got it right and help it like crazy tool chain problems, right?

735
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:52,680
So yeah.

736
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:57,880
So then we were left at Rust and C++ and the battle began.

737
00:40:57,880 --> 00:41:02,920
And the irony is our emailer Drew hates both Rust and C, or doesn't hate Rust, but he definitely

738
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:03,920
hates C++.

739
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:04,920
Yeah.

740
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:06,200
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo.

741
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:08,160
So it was a battle of the languages.

742
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:09,880
Battle of the languages.

743
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:11,520
There were a couple reasons.

744
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:13,840
So there's a few things here.

745
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:18,640
I personally was buying into the Rust Kool Aid on the whole safety thing and security

746
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:19,640
thing.

747
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:22,280
And I think that's mostly, mostly fair, right?

748
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:27,400
I don't think that's really, I don't think that's too hyped up, but there was the realities

749
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:31,840
of other than me, no one on the team has done any Rust in any significant amount.

750
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:35,840
I have done some, but I don't day-to-day work in Rust.

751
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:40,080
We have all done C++ at various points in our lives.

752
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:45,640
Some of us more recently than others, I got down this rabbit hole of people blogging and

753
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:48,880
doing content on quote modern C++.

754
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:50,340
Have you heard of these guys?

755
00:41:50,340 --> 00:41:54,560
This kind of rings a, it's like a way like to do C++ safely.

756
00:41:54,560 --> 00:42:00,200
It's so since C++ 14 and we're on 20 now, 23 is going to be the next version.

757
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:01,200
Whoa.

758
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:02,200
Okay.

759
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:03,200
Yeah.

760
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:07,040
They're added a bunch of features that basically, I mean, a lot of them are like aping other

761
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:14,080
languages, but that basically smooth over some of the rough, rough aspects of C++.

762
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:19,400
One in particular as a group, they're called smart pointers and there's, I'm not going

763
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:25,280
to dig into this too much, but they are very reminiscent to me of before Ark, how you could

764
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:30,600
do Objective-C had some, they're not, I can't remember what the right name for this is,

765
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:33,680
but they're not macros, but like you could tell it what kind of pointer you wanted and

766
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:35,800
there were different rules based on that.

767
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:41,280
And then granted Objective-C had auto release pools, which C++ kind of doesn't and it does

768
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:42,720
things a little differently.

769
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:47,480
But it was familiar enough to me that I was like, one, is it, could this be my new Objective-C

770
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:50,240
because that makes me very happy.

771
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:55,660
And two, it really makes me a little more confident in doing this job in C++ because

772
00:42:55,660 --> 00:43:01,720
this is an internal project, which means we're going to have to not use all the senior people

773
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:03,420
on it all the time.

774
00:43:03,420 --> 00:43:06,040
Then I got digging even further.

775
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:07,940
I downloaded C line.

776
00:43:07,940 --> 00:43:16,440
I installed my Dracula theme and I wrote what I can only describe as a flashback program.

777
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:23,280
I know it's not Objective-C. I know the programming paradigm is somewhat different.

778
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:28,800
It felt like when you come home to like your town you grew up in and you haven't been there

779
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:34,720
in like 15 years, it's different, but there's a little bit of nostalgia there.

780
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:39,520
Just typing to release memory was a joy.

781
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:43,000
Just having the star, the pointer symbol there was magical.

782
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:48,120
We're going to need a drink for this.

783
00:43:48,120 --> 00:43:55,120
As memories flowed over me, the song by Big Red holding back the years started playing

784
00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:56,600
in my head.

785
00:43:56,600 --> 00:44:05,200
I quickly popped open another window to create a subdirectory with its own CMake.list.

786
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:10,960
And all the while, Sea Lion before my eyes and Pop OS before my eyes are turning into

787
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:14,060
Xcode and Snow Leopard respectively.

788
00:44:14,060 --> 00:44:15,900
I'm going back.

789
00:44:15,900 --> 00:44:18,440
My skin is getting smoother and lighter.

790
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:20,800
My eyes are like more blue.

791
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:22,360
I mean it's amazing.

792
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:23,360
Like the good old days.

793
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:26,880
I think I may have found.

794
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:34,240
Now of course Objective-C was my first love, my high school sweetheart.

795
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:36,120
We were together a long time.

796
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:37,880
We made many apps together.

797
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:40,040
It'll always have a place in my heart.

798
00:44:40,040 --> 00:44:41,440
But it's time to move on.

799
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:46,520
It's time to find a new programming language that also has pointers and scary memory leaks

800
00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:50,360
so I can torture people in job interviews.

801
00:44:50,360 --> 00:44:52,080
And I think it could be.

802
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:54,160
Now I'm not trying to be too forward.

803
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:58,480
I'm only texting C++ when it texts back because I'm not, you know what I mean?

804
00:44:58,480 --> 00:44:59,480
You don't want that buildup.

805
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:00,480
Yeah.

806
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:01,480
Yeah.

807
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:02,480
Yeah.

808
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:03,480
And you don't want to come across too strong.

809
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:04,480
Too like whatever.

810
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:10,200
I installed C Lion, I even installed Clang to really just see like, hey, you know, I'm

811
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:12,000
open to stuff.

812
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:15,480
And yeah, I think we're going to make a go of it with C++.

813
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:18,800
I find this point that you're kind of touching on there in there a little bit is kind of

814
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:23,480
being back in like the golden era of tools again a little bit.

815
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:27,160
Like there is a, in like we were kind of in, we were kind of an old cranky man territory

816
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:28,160
there for a bit.

817
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:33,960
But I agree in all of this noise and mess, some of this stuff is better than it ever

818
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:34,960
has been.

819
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:37,720
I'm just going to say CMake and CTest are still great.

820
00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:39,680
Kind of making me feel like the good old days in some way.

821
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:41,680
So it's not all, it's not all bad.

822
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:43,600
You know what that said, I'm popping open Emacs.

823
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:44,600
That's it.

824
00:45:44,600 --> 00:45:51,520
We're going to, we're going to.

825
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:55,360
So how's the rest of the team coping with your discoveries?

826
00:45:55,360 --> 00:45:57,000
I mean, are they on board?

827
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,440
Is there some skill sets there?

828
00:45:58,440 --> 00:46:02,840
There definitely was an age discrepancy in the response.

829
00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:08,540
The fellow, and actually one of them is significantly older than me, we're very excited.

830
00:46:08,540 --> 00:46:12,200
Thank God I don't have to use this crap with these NPM packages anymore and the stupid

831
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:13,260
pip and all.

832
00:46:13,260 --> 00:46:15,560
So yeah, there was a lot of, there was some of that.

833
00:46:15,560 --> 00:46:20,200
There was a little bit of, I don't know if I remember how to do manual memory management,

834
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:21,880
but that's okay.

835
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:22,880
Because you know what?

836
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:24,920
Florida's employee at will.

837
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:26,920
Was that?

838
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:32,720
No, I mean, no, I just think that, you know, it's, I mean, it's, it's a little

839
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:33,720
direct.

840
00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:36,280
He's a jackass.

841
00:46:36,280 --> 00:46:37,280
But you know, it is business.

842
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:38,280
Business?

843
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:39,280
Yeah, it is business.

844
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:40,280
No, I'm joking.

845
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:41,280
Of course.

846
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:42,280
Sort of.

847
00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:43,280
Not really.

848
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:47,560
It's seriously, it is something about working in a language that doesn't want me to tinsel

849
00:46:47,560 --> 00:46:51,400
together 47 packages off of some random GitHub repo.

850
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:53,520
It's, it's refreshing.

851
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:57,360
It's like how programming used to be before we all went insane.

852
00:46:57,360 --> 00:47:02,000
Oh, and one of the big improvements before somebody writes into the show with a C plus

853
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,160
plus, I think it came in.

854
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:05,160
Someone will correct us in the feedback.

855
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:10,600
I think it came in at 17 or 14, um, or strings that make sense because that was one of the

856
00:47:10,600 --> 00:47:12,400
big like issues.

857
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:13,640
All right.

858
00:47:13,640 --> 00:47:16,680
So I want, I want the audience's diagnosis.

859
00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:22,520
What do you think of Mike's revelation coder dot show slash contact, share your opinions

860
00:47:22,520 --> 00:47:28,480
with us over there and uh, you know, we'll read a future emails and follow ups on the

861
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:29,480
air like we love to do.

862
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:30,480
It's part of the show.

863
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:35,360
We're doing a blog series documenting the newer features of quote modern C plus plus

864
00:47:35,360 --> 00:47:40,680
and comparing them to a certain language who I get a little upset when I, when I say its

865
00:47:40,680 --> 00:47:41,680
name.

866
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:44,280
You know, I definitely, it's definitely still hung up a little bit.

867
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:45,360
Um, but objective C.

868
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:46,360
Hmm.

869
00:47:46,360 --> 00:47:47,360
Hmm.

870
00:47:47,360 --> 00:47:48,360
Hmm.

871
00:47:48,360 --> 00:47:49,360
I don't believe you.

872
00:47:49,360 --> 00:47:50,360
Oh, look, yeah.

873
00:47:50,360 --> 00:47:51,680
That youthful bastard.

874
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:54,800
He didn't know what MPM was because it didn't exist yet.

875
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:58,840
He didn't know what was coming for him.

876
00:47:58,840 --> 00:48:03,520
He sounds, he really does sound so, so young and so hopeful just in that one little, I

877
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:04,520
don't believe you.

878
00:48:04,520 --> 00:48:05,520
Yeah.

879
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:06,520
Oof.

880
00:48:06,520 --> 00:48:07,520
That's another time.

881
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:08,520
