00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
This is KOTORadio, episode 490, Prokober 31st!

00:15.000 --> 00:18.000
Hey good buddy, welcome back to Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show,

00:18.000 --> 00:22.000
taking a pragmatic look at the art and the business of software development

00:22.000 --> 00:24.000
and the spooky world of technology.

00:24.000 --> 00:28.000
My name is Chris, obviously, it's Halloween, and joining us like the soldier is,

00:28.000 --> 00:31.000
even though I'm late, it's our host, Mr. Dominic.

00:31.000 --> 00:32.000
Hello, mate.

00:32.000 --> 00:35.000
KOTORba mitzvah, spooky, scary, noobs becoming...

00:35.000 --> 00:36.000
Oh, it's a...

00:36.000 --> 00:37.000
I had a whole thing.

00:37.000 --> 00:39.000
Oh, good, that was... yeah, that's good.

00:39.000 --> 00:40.000
Now you don't get it, see?

00:40.000 --> 00:41.000
This is...

00:41.000 --> 00:42.000
No!

00:42.000 --> 00:45.000
You know what, you Lenart Potter-ing me, you jumped on the stage, you get nothing.

00:45.000 --> 00:46.000
I did.

00:46.000 --> 00:47.000
Yeah, you get nothing.

00:47.000 --> 00:48.000
You're saying that Kanye did?

00:48.000 --> 00:49.000
Is that what you're saying?

00:49.000 --> 00:51.000
No, actually, wasn't Lenart Potter-ing before Kanye?

00:51.000 --> 00:52.000
That might have been.

00:52.000 --> 00:55.000
Yo, Lenart, go get some money out of Kanye, everybody else is suing him,

00:55.000 --> 00:57.000
what the hell, jump in line.

00:57.000 --> 01:00.000
Fired up now, he's at Microsoft, he's telling people like it is out there, I guess.

01:00.000 --> 01:02.000
Got a whole new way of doing boot.

01:02.000 --> 01:05.000
The most gangster Linux community thing to do is to be like,

01:05.000 --> 01:07.000
yeah, bitches, you know where I'm going?

01:07.000 --> 01:08.000
Microsoft.

01:08.000 --> 01:09.000
What?

01:09.000 --> 01:10.000
It is.

01:10.000 --> 01:11.000
It's also very common.

01:11.000 --> 01:14.000
Yeah, well, Microsoft's got a bigger and bigger Linux department now.

01:14.000 --> 01:16.000
Are you saying they're measuring their Linux?

01:16.000 --> 01:21.000
They're also in that late-biocracy-stage company where they've gone through being

01:21.000 --> 01:24.000
like the craziest, most complex bureaucracy possible,

01:24.000 --> 01:28.000
and they've kind of leveled off a little bit where some companies like I think

01:28.000 --> 01:32.000
Google and Apple are still getting worse and worse and worse in that regard.

01:32.000 --> 01:34.000
I'm sure Microsoft has a slow decline as well.

01:34.000 --> 01:36.000
I mean, it's a cycle, right?

01:36.000 --> 01:39.000
None of it's as bad as Adobe, which is apparently going to make,

01:39.000 --> 01:41.000
and everybody was freaking out,

01:41.000 --> 01:44.000
apparently Adobe's going to make certain colors only available as an in-app,

01:44.000 --> 01:47.000
well, no, actually just not available, like they can't license them or something.

01:47.000 --> 01:48.000
I don't know.

01:48.000 --> 01:50.000
I'm not an Adobe guy.

01:50.000 --> 01:53.000
But it really fit in with our trend today of looking at some scary trends

01:53.000 --> 01:57.000
coming down the pipe for tech because, yes, it's spooky Halloween,

01:57.000 --> 02:00.000
and you and I are both dads of young kids, so, you know,

02:00.000 --> 02:03.000
Halloween's a big deal in our neck of the woods.

02:03.000 --> 02:06.000
So I did ask some design folks what the deal is with this color stuff.

02:06.000 --> 02:07.000
Oh, yeah? Okay.

02:07.000 --> 02:08.000
Yeah.

02:08.000 --> 02:11.000
All right, so there's a company in, guess what state?

02:11.000 --> 02:14.000
There's only one state that would pull a move like this.

02:14.000 --> 02:16.000
I mean, I always default to Florida, but...

02:16.000 --> 02:18.000
No, no, Florida wouldn't even know.

02:18.000 --> 02:21.000
Florida would be too drunk or like riding an alligator down the highway.

02:21.000 --> 02:22.000
Yeah, you're right.

02:22.000 --> 02:23.000
You're more like chaotic.

02:23.000 --> 02:24.000
Yeah, New Jersey.

02:24.000 --> 02:26.000
Only New Jersey could think of this.

02:26.000 --> 02:27.000
That's legal.

02:27.000 --> 02:28.000
Yep.

02:28.000 --> 02:29.000
Yeah, it's a gangster move a little bit, too.

02:29.000 --> 02:30.000
It is.

02:30.000 --> 02:31.000
There's a little bit of it.

02:31.000 --> 02:32.000
Is it technically legal?

02:32.000 --> 02:33.000
It sure is.

02:33.000 --> 02:37.000
So basically, some company used to sell print colors,

02:37.000 --> 02:40.000
and they are somehow proprietary colors.

02:40.000 --> 02:44.000
This reminds me of a meeting I had with a large printer company

02:44.000 --> 02:47.000
who was very upset about the shade of blue that I couldn't get.

02:47.000 --> 02:48.000
Oh, yeah, they hate that.

02:48.000 --> 02:50.000
Well, because I'm a spiteful little bastard,

02:50.000 --> 02:52.000
I went back and looked.

02:52.000 --> 02:53.000
Sure enough, that shade of blue...

02:53.000 --> 02:56.000
Now, granted, the reason I couldn't get it was just me being a jackass,

02:56.000 --> 03:00.000
but it is one of these colors.

03:00.000 --> 03:02.000
So apparently, these are all like off colors.

03:02.000 --> 03:03.000
You know what I mean?

03:03.000 --> 03:08.000
They're like in between, you know, hard to get the hex code for.

03:08.000 --> 03:09.000
Yeah.

03:09.000 --> 03:11.000
Basically, Photoshop magic.

03:11.000 --> 03:12.000
When the designer...

03:12.000 --> 03:13.000
Got to have your monitor dialed in.

03:13.000 --> 03:14.000
Right.

03:14.000 --> 03:18.000
Like on my ViewSonic monitor, I basically can't see them, right?

03:18.000 --> 03:22.000
It's why the Apple monitor is $5,000.

03:22.000 --> 03:24.000
It's pretty insane.

03:24.000 --> 03:25.000
So what they did is...

03:25.000 --> 03:28.000
This is actually not Adobe being evil.

03:28.000 --> 03:31.000
Well, well, okay.

03:31.000 --> 03:33.000
So this company who owns the colors,

03:33.000 --> 03:35.000
whose name eludes me right now,

03:35.000 --> 03:36.000
but they're in New Jersey,

03:36.000 --> 03:38.000
and that's pretty much all you need to know

03:38.000 --> 03:40.000
because I'm sure I'm related to some of them.

03:40.000 --> 03:43.000
Hey, cuz, told Adobe,

03:43.000 --> 03:47.000
I see you have that monthly subscription thing going there.

03:47.000 --> 03:50.000
It's an awfully sweet Creative Cloud you've got.

03:50.000 --> 03:52.000
It'd be a shame if you didn't pay us some more royalties

03:52.000 --> 03:54.000
and something happened to those colors.

03:54.000 --> 03:56.000
And Adobe was like, no, we're Adobe.

03:56.000 --> 03:58.000
They're like, cool, you don't get the colors.

03:58.000 --> 04:00.000
But because of the darkness,

04:00.000 --> 04:02.000
and I will stand by this till the...

04:02.000 --> 04:06.000
I've held this position since we started in 2012.

04:06.000 --> 04:08.000
Creative Cloud is in fact a downgrade.

04:08.000 --> 04:14.000
As someone who has acquired Illustrator and Dreamweaver

04:14.000 --> 04:17.000
when that was a thing, many times in his youth,

04:17.000 --> 04:19.000
if you know what I mean.

04:19.000 --> 04:22.000
What a nice cat with headphones on that is, wow.

04:22.000 --> 04:25.000
You know, my software fell off the back of a truck

04:25.000 --> 04:27.000
when I was a kid, my Adobe software.

04:27.000 --> 04:29.000
Well, in New Jersey, you literally just go see your uncle Vito

04:29.000 --> 04:32.000
and they hand you like the four CDs it used to be.

04:32.000 --> 04:35.000
You know, that is legit how it used to go down.

04:35.000 --> 04:37.000
And you could use the CD key as many times as you wanted

04:37.000 --> 04:39.000
because there wasn't checking with any server.

04:39.000 --> 04:41.000
You had the disk, you had the thing.

04:41.000 --> 04:43.000
It was like you had the machine, you have the system.

04:43.000 --> 04:47.000
Well, Creative Cloud pretty aggressively forces upgrades on people.

04:47.000 --> 04:50.000
So the nightmare scenario is you have your,

04:50.000 --> 04:52.000
let's just take the simple case, your Photoshop file

04:52.000 --> 04:55.000
for your very picky printer company,

04:55.000 --> 04:57.000
and your Creative Cloud updates

04:57.000 --> 04:59.000
because you leave your iMac Pro on all night, of course,

04:59.000 --> 05:01.000
to do your updates.

05:01.000 --> 05:04.000
And all of a sudden, you open that same file the next day

05:04.000 --> 05:08.000
and the color is gone, so they're just black.

05:08.000 --> 05:11.000
And not like a nice black, but like a void out black, right?

05:11.000 --> 05:14.000
And that's not how local apps are supposed to be.

05:14.000 --> 05:16.000
But you know what?

05:16.000 --> 05:18.000
You know how the verge says, what's a button?

05:18.000 --> 05:20.000
We should have, what's an app?

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000
Right. What is an app?

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
Is a local app that gets updated by a cloud service

05:24.000 --> 05:26.000
that's tied into some sort of authentication mechanism

05:26.000 --> 05:28.000
that's always checking in and auto-installing updates?

05:28.000 --> 05:31.000
Is that truly a local app? Sounds like a hybrid app to me.

05:31.000 --> 05:33.000
What if the platform vendor can turn off an app

05:33.000 --> 05:35.000
or remove it from your device?

05:35.000 --> 05:37.000
They totally can. They totally can remove your licensing.

05:37.000 --> 05:39.000
What if, and I just had this ugly experience,

05:39.000 --> 05:41.000
you have an app that you paid for years ago,

05:41.000 --> 05:44.000
you open your iPad, you try to run it, and the app runs fine,

05:44.000 --> 05:46.000
but because the company no longer exists,

05:46.000 --> 05:50.000
their REST API no longer exists, and it does nothing.

05:50.000 --> 05:52.000
So is that a local app then? No.

05:52.000 --> 05:55.000
No, I think they're all, eww, services, eww, we should move on.

05:55.000 --> 05:57.000
See, that's our first scary thing.

05:57.000 --> 05:59.000
New Jersey.

05:59.000 --> 06:01.000
So Matt wrote in to push back a little bit

06:01.000 --> 06:03.000
on license being gatekeeping.

06:03.000 --> 06:05.000
His core point was that, well, somebody's got to sign off

06:05.000 --> 06:08.000
on things that are like professional public works

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
that need to be safe for the public to use.

06:10.000 --> 06:12.000
Part of the responsibility, he writes,

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
of a professional engineer is to sign off on projects

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
that meet all the regulations,

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
and then they need some point of responsibility

06:18.000 --> 06:20.000
if there are mistakes they've made

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
that result in some sort of major issue.

06:22.000 --> 06:24.000
He says, sure, this isn't maybe necessary for web developers

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
or a lot of common software development,

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
but he says you might be able to argue it is

06:28.000 --> 06:31.000
for somebody working on the 737, for example.

06:31.000 --> 06:33.000
So he says it's not gatekeeping in all cases,

06:33.000 --> 06:36.000
and sometimes it's just good for public safety.

06:36.000 --> 06:40.000
And maybe the argument also I think that might resonate

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
is holding someone accountable for a mistake.

06:42.000 --> 06:44.000
Sure.

06:44.000 --> 06:47.000
I mean, that is a great idea.

06:47.000 --> 06:49.000
And I actually agree with it,

06:49.000 --> 06:52.000
but it kind of falls apart when you see in practice

06:52.000 --> 06:56.000
how these licensing schemes tend to be used.

06:56.000 --> 06:58.000
I would say with the great exception of the type

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
of public work he's talking about, like bridges.

07:00.000 --> 07:02.000
Fair. I think you're right.

07:02.000 --> 07:04.000
The actual implementation has shown us

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
that it is being abused.

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
There's clearly some use case for it,

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
which is probably why it came around to begin with.

07:10.000 --> 07:12.000
But now it's just gone too far.

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
I'm with you on that.

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
So yeah, that was Matt. Now Matthew wrote in.

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
So we've got Matt and Matthew this week

07:18.000 --> 07:20.000
with some uniform ideas.

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
He says if you go with one thing,

07:22.000 --> 07:24.000
it's doomed to failure in the long run.

07:24.000 --> 07:26.000
Your preferences will change, companies will drop items.

07:26.000 --> 07:28.000
That has been on my mind.

07:28.000 --> 07:30.000
Instead, I propose you strive for an interoperable wardrobe,

07:30.000 --> 07:32.000
a modular wardrobe, you know,

07:32.000 --> 07:34.000
anything with maybe like an open source core.

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
For instance,

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
my work shirts can be worn with regular jeans

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
or more formal pants I own.

07:40.000 --> 07:42.000
With this strategy, if you don't want to think about

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
what you wear, you just grab the first thing off the rack

07:44.000 --> 07:46.000
and you're good to go.

07:46.000 --> 07:48.000
And if you're feeling in particular,

07:48.000 --> 07:50.000
you can grab a pair instead.

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
Hope to hear the conclusion to your quest soon.

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
Those are good points.

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
Interoperable I think might be the way to go.

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
It's like a mix and match and that I believe,

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
my wife corrected me,

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
I thought a wardrobe capsule, because I'm an idiot,

08:02.000 --> 08:04.000
was just like a whole outfit,

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
shirt, pants, socks, whatever.

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
I don't know what makes a whole outfit.

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
But she's saying nah.

08:10.000 --> 08:12.000
It's actually, this is what she says,

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
she says nah, she says nah.

08:14.000 --> 08:16.000
It's actually mix and match.

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
It's like different shirts that go with different pants,

08:18.000 --> 08:20.000
but they all go together.

08:20.000 --> 08:22.000
That's a wardrobe capsule.

08:22.000 --> 08:24.000
So I think maybe I need a wardrobe capsule.

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
I don't know why it's called a capsule.

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
And not just a wardrobe,

08:28.000 --> 08:30.000
but it's a wardrobe capsule.

08:30.000 --> 08:32.000
I kind of didn't get this email.

08:32.000 --> 08:34.000
It reminds me of the Skyrim created character thing,

08:34.000 --> 08:36.000
where all the pieces kind of go together.

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
Yes.

08:38.000 --> 08:40.000
So that's what it is.

08:40.000 --> 08:42.000
Yeah, I need a character creator.

08:42.000 --> 08:44.000
And then I asked the audience out there

08:44.000 --> 08:46.000
if anybody else uses a dedicated PC for Emacs or some other job,

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
and Don noted that he has a dedicated PC

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
for his banking and his crypto purchases.

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
So there you go.

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
And then we made a note in the doc for Mumble Colony,

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
but I don't remember what that's in regards to.

08:56.000 --> 08:58.000
We do have a Mumble though at jupitabroadcasting.com.

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
Mumble is still around?

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
Yeah, still around.

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
We use it on LUP still

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
and on office hours quite frequently.

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
There you go.

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
Now you learned.

09:10.000 --> 09:12.000
Today you learned.

09:12.000 --> 09:14.000
linode.com slash coder.

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
That's where you go to get $100

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
in 60-day credit on a new account.

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
And it's a great way to support the show

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
while you're checking out some fast, reliable cloud hosting.

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
You got to try Linode for your next project.

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
It's what we use for everything

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
we've built and deployed recently.

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
It's part of what makes our new website seem fast.

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
Linode makes us look good.

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
They've been rolling out MVME storage upgrades too,

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
so the performance there is super great.

09:36.000 --> 09:38.000
They are their own ISP.

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
They have a whole range of systems

09:40.000 --> 09:42.000
from nanodes that are just tiny little boxes

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
that maybe do like one job,

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
a nano box to these monster systems

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
like we use for our matrix system.

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
If you're a performance hound,

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
you're going to love the combination

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
of CPU options, GPU options,

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
and storage options.

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
And next year, they're lighting up a dozen

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
new data centers.

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
Linode's just simply the best place

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
to host and run your code.

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
And they have a bunch of one-click deployments

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
for tons of open source applications,

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
GitLab and GitT,

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
and things that are just really quick

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
and get up and going like Nextcloud.

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
They'll also let you build it up from scratch

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
with just about any distro you'd ever want to use

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
in the cloud. They've got a big range of distributions,

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
a great dashboard,

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
a clean API, and best of all,

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
you can get a hundred bucks

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
while you support the show to try it all out.

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
You just go to linode.com slash coder.

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
There has been a story that's been super

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
embarrassing for Apple since we gathered

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
together last week, and it's really gross.

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
It all kind of comes together here.

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
Apple is flexing control over the

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
App Store in such a

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
grotesque, overreaching way

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
that it's absolutely going to limit

10:48.000 --> 10:50.000
development of some industries.

10:50.000 --> 10:52.000
It's already holding back companies

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
like Telegram. Telegram's CEO

10:54.000 --> 10:56.000
has accused Apple of destroying dreams

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
and crushing entrepreneurs.

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
Sounds like my ex-wife.

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
He said that

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
they had a feature they wanted to roll out.

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
They would have been kind of like

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
an in-app payment thing, but Apple

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
wants a 30% cut of any of that

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
type of stuff. Apple's also updated

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
their rules to say they're going to get a cut of any

11:14.000 --> 11:16.000
NFT sales done

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
inside an Apple

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
iPhone. Did they really

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
relocate to Jersey too? I know,

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
right?

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
Their App Store department must be over there.

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
Also, all of the

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
little boost or favorite of post

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
or Facebook thing where you can buy something to

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
make your post stand out. All of that

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
stuff now. Apple just announced

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
they also want a 30% cut of all of that

11:38.000 --> 11:40.000
stuff. This is major.

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
I actually have a sound bite from Tim Cook

11:42.000 --> 11:44.000
on this. Okay.

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
I'm altering the deal.

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
Pray I don't alter it any further.

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
I know. Which historically

11:50.000 --> 11:52.000
he's definitely going to.

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
This has really

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
gotten to a new level.

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
Alex Gigatexel, he pointed out

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
a clip from Coderadio 197

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
back in 2016

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
where we were kind of going on about how

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
bad the App Store discovery was

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
and how bad the search was.

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
Slowly but surely, what Apple has done is

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
instead of fixing search in the App Store,

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
they've introduced new and new layers

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
of advertising. Along with

12:16.000 --> 12:18.000
just squeezing down

12:18.000 --> 12:20.000
on every way these apps

12:20.000 --> 12:22.000
can potentially deal

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
with money at all. Even if

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
they're doing everything within the app ecosystem,

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
Apple wants a cut. They're also

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
at the same time loading up

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
the App Store with more ads. They just got in a bunch

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
of trouble because they had gambling ads

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
that people hated right next to developers

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
apps that were about mental health

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
and whatnot. There was one in particular

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
that was literally an app to help

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
you quit gambling. They say they've

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
paused the ads related to gambling and a few other

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
categories on the App Store now.

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
But the fact that it made it in there in the first

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
place, that's a shift for

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
Apple. Remember?

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
Apple wasn't willing to cross that line until recently.

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
In fact, we used to criticize them for being

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
too puritanical. They were like

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
they had some pretty

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
strict censorship things. They've kicked

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
apps out if you could somehow

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
leap out from the app and then end up on a gambling

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
site. They've kicked an app out of the App Store before.

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
And now they're running gambling

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
ads.

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
They've paused them.

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
It's like how

13:20.000 --> 13:22.000
the PayPal $2,500

13:22.000 --> 13:24.000
fine for misinformation got out and everybody

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
freaked out. Did you know they're putting it back in?

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
Now I don't know if the misinformation language is in there,

13:28.000 --> 13:30.000
but they've slipped that $2,500 fine back in.

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
It's like people get outraged.

13:32.000 --> 13:34.000
We get over it and then the companies just

13:34.000 --> 13:36.000
kind of move on and they just tighten it down.

13:36.000 --> 13:38.000
That's Apple's move here. So they've paused

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
it. They've paused it, they say.

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
But eventually, that line will

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
slip again. It'll be back.

13:44.000 --> 13:46.000
And if they're willing to slip on this, what else

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
are they willing to slip on?

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
I agree with you,

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
but let me devil's advocate a little

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
for Uncle Tim.

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
For our dear, sweet Uncle Tim.

13:56.000 --> 13:58.000
He needs to keep

13:58.000 --> 14:00.000
the revenue growing. I think it's safe

14:00.000 --> 14:02.000
to say there's not that

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
many humans left to sell iPhones to

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
that want them.

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
Or can afford them at this point.

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
Or can afford them with the price,

14:10.000 --> 14:12.000
with the quote, inflation, i.e. price gouging.

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
Is this just a function

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
of being a public company where

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
that chart has to go up and to the right

14:18.000 --> 14:20.000
every quarter and

14:20.000 --> 14:22.000
they know...

14:22.000 --> 14:24.000
See, I have this thesis about

14:24.000 --> 14:26.000
these big companies that they know in their heart of hearts

14:26.000 --> 14:28.000
there is not going to be

14:28.000 --> 14:30.000
the next big thing, and if so,

14:30.000 --> 14:32.000
their only way to...

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
Even if there is, their only

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
way to handle it

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
is to basically tax it.

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
Where Apple is in a lot of

14:40.000 --> 14:42.000
ways functioning as an IRS.

14:42.000 --> 14:44.000
They are

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
taxing new businesses

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
and new innovation because

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
they own the iPhone and iOS and

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
related platforms.

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
I guess you could argue Facebook isn't doing this,

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
but it just seems like he's lighting

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
money on fire to give people legs,

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
which is a choice.

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
You know, the first time I think we've ever seen

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
this, Comcast NBC

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
is reporting too that their revenue is

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
down, that their subscribers

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
even on the Peacock streaming service are

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
up, but the Comcast revenue

15:12.000 --> 15:14.000
is down. The

15:14.000 --> 15:16.000
Comcast division took a quarter with a revenue

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
decline of 14%.

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
The reason why I bring that up

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
is because Comcast strikes

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
me a little bit of what Apple is turning into.

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
They've built their infrastructure,

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
they've got the wire to everybody's home,

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
but now they can't really

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
get to more

15:32.000 --> 15:34.000
homes fast enough. There's just not enough new homes

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
coming online to keep number

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
going up. Over the years,

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
Comcast has layered

15:40.000 --> 15:42.000
on all this stuff.

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
Bought up companies and just done

15:44.000 --> 15:46.000
everything they can to make number

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
go up.

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
After a decade of loose money,

15:50.000 --> 15:52.000
I know this is my new

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
soapbox, but seriously,

15:54.000 --> 15:56.000
it set the tone for

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
everything. It matters. I don't think we've

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
realized how much it matters.

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
With loose money, they soaked up all this

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
money, they bought up all these companies, they formed

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
NBC Universal, Comcast,

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
Peacock, and even

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
after a decade of all that, they still can only

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
grow so much. Now

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
they have customers that are leaving

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
because better alternatives are eventually coming

16:16.000 --> 16:18.000
along.

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
It's been like 10 years of this.

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
Apple, I think, is earlier in this cycle.

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
They're at the beginning of this Comcast

16:24.000 --> 16:26.000
cycle. Yeah,

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
I mean, I think they are. I think also

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
maybe this is going to get me some heat

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
from my elephant-loving

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
friends.

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
You know, maybe companies can only get so big.

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
Right? And when you hit a certain

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
point of size and scale,

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
the cost of being that size

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
is just too

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
much. Maybe we just watched

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
a grand experiment in how big can

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
companies get. Because

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
unless money gets free again,

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
money was

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
better than free

16:56.000 --> 16:58.000
because the interest rate was zero

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
and inflation was one,

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
two, four, and then seven, eight percent.

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
So for a while,

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
getting a loan was better

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
than free money. If you were a big company,

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
it was literally less than being taxed.

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
You were better off keeping your money in

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
Ireland or wherever the hell.

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
And they don't get taxed on the

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
money they borrow. So they have all

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
these assets, they have all this wealth that they can use

17:20.000 --> 17:22.000
as collateral. And you write off the interest

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
as a tax deduction. So you

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
get the government coming and going.

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
You don't have to pay taxes on the loan money

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
you use, and you get a write-off on the interest

17:30.000 --> 17:32.000
for that loan money if there is interest.

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
And even now, the interest rates are still super low.

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
I mean, it was such a great deal for them.

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
And I wonder if we didn't just watch—

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
because it's been since 2008.

17:40.000 --> 17:42.000
So we've been watching this happen.

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
Perhaps we watched these tech

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
companies get as big as they're going to get. This was their

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
largest phase, and now it's just sort of more

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
leveled off growth from here. I'm sure they're probably going to still

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
go up because there's more humans all

17:52.000 --> 17:54.000
the time. But I think the

17:54.000 --> 17:56.000
years of just astronomical

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
growth after astronomical growth

17:58.000 --> 18:00.000
could be coming to an end.

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
Unless printers go

18:02.000 --> 18:04.000
again. I'm not sure it may happen.

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
Wow. We discussed this last week, and you were pretty—

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
I think eventually it will, yeah.

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
But I think you nailed it.

18:10.000 --> 18:12.000
Apple also is trying to get a cut

18:12.000 --> 18:14.000
of social media network

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
advertising. You know, when you buy a little bit

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
of advertising in the app

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
to, say, run an ad on Facebook,

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
Apple wants a cut of that.

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
It's incredible, because if you zoom out, what's happened here

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
is Apple turned

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
on the ATT, the application

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
cross-tracking. They set

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
up a block for that in a prompt, which knocked

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
about a billion dollars off of Facebook's revenue

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
and cut down on advertising

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
revenue for all these guys, then launched

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
their own ads. But just pause

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
there. Overnight, they flipped

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
the switch and nailed Facebook

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
for a billion dollars. That's

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
wild. When's the last time we heard something

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
like that? Even

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
you know, Pierpont Morgan

18:52.000 --> 18:54.000
and the other railroad tycoons couldn't pull a move

18:54.000 --> 18:56.000
that devastating to their competitor.

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
That's what I was thinking. It would have been

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
worldwide news.

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
It would have been a huge deal.

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
But it was Facebook, so

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
nobody cares. Well, they are evil.

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
But if they'd done something that cost the New York

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
Times a billion dollars,

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
I think people would have cared. But it's Facebook,

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
you know, it's just stupid meta.

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
Tailscale.com slash coder.

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
Go there to get Tailscale for free

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
on a personal account. Up to 20

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
devices. That's a big flat network.

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
Tailscale is a zero config

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
VPN. You get it set up in minutes on any

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
device, really. And it manages the firewall

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
rules, takes care of your nat

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
situation, even your double carrier grade

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
ultra-nats. I can attest to that.

19:36.000 --> 19:38.000
Devices connect directly to each

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
other using WireGuard's noise protocol.

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
They build a backend that helps you connect

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
them all simply and quickly using whatever

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
single sign-on provider you like,

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
including two-factor authentication support.

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
And they build a flat mesh

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
network that's always on. And it's

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
smart about how it handles traffic too.

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
It doesn't tunnel everything to Tailscale.

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
It just tunnels the stuff that's on

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
that LAN. And it also

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
does clever things like subnet

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
routing so you can actually get access to

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
entire LAN and it just does it so transparently.

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
I love

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
Tailscale Send. I mention that all the time.

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
It's like AirDrop for all your machines.

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
But Tailscale SSH just

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
got better. So Tailscale SSH

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
allows you to establish SSH

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
connections between your devices in your

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
Tailscale network as authorized by

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
your Tailscale access

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
controls. Like I have a machine I share with Alex

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
and I have a machine I share with

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
a family member just

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
through the access controls on Tailscale.

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
You don't have to manage SSH keys anymore.

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
It authenticates your SSH connection

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
using WireGuard and

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
to make things even better

20:40.000 --> 20:42.000
just a couple of days ago

20:42.000 --> 20:44.000
they launched the SSH client via the

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
web. So you can log in to the

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
Tailscale console and right

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000
there start up an SSH session

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
inside your web browser to one of your machines

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
in your Tailscale network.

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
So handy.

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
So powerful because for me

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
Tailscale is how I also support my friends

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
and my family. My kids all their machines

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
are on Tailscale. My dad he's on Tailscale.

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
They're all on my network and when they

21:06.000 --> 21:08.000
need help this is going to be one of the tools

21:08.000 --> 21:10.000
I have available to me. Or if I need to fix something for

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
JB it's just another tool available

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
to me just integrated with Tailscale

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
and you can get set up in just minutes.

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
So go try it for 20 devices for free

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
and support the show by going to

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
tailscale.com slash coder.

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
We just love it. Everyone at JB

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
uses it. Tailscale.com

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
slash coder.

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
So in the theme of

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
scary spooky tech trends

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
for some reason my old man

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
cackles have gotten all riled up

21:36.000 --> 21:38.000
over the continued gamification

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
of software development and now

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
new research has provided evidence

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
for what they say is quote significant impact

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
of gamification on the behavior

21:46.000 --> 21:48.000
of developers on large

21:48.000 --> 21:50.000
collaborative programming software platforms

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
but they urge caution

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
too because the

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
gamification they say can quote

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
steer the behavior of software developers

21:58.000 --> 22:00.000
in unexpected and

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
unwanted directions and

22:02.000 --> 22:04.000
if you remove the gamification

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
productivity drops off an

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
effing cliff. People

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
just stop participating entirely.

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
So not only do you incentivize things you

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
didn't expect and sometimes

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
it's like a big boost in how many people

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
are contributing and sometimes it's like

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
people gaming the system but it

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
does seem like there's really something to this

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
and I mention this

22:24.000 --> 22:26.000
because the GNOME project

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
just announced they're shutting down their mailing

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
lists and they're moving to

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
systems like GitHub and

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
Discourse and places where they can

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
implement gamification because they're seeing

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
good results in the GNOME community

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
from certain types of gamification.

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
Fedora has done something

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
similar. They have a badge for contributors

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
and like the ButterFS, I have the

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
ButterFS badge for example. I think it's the number one badge

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
they gave out. The ButterFS badge

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
if you're a Fedora user if you

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
help test the beta that had ButterFS

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
and this gamification's

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
becoming more and more of a thing and I wonder if you

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
think this is a dark trend or a

23:00.000 --> 23:02.000
good trend? Probably

23:02.000 --> 23:04.000
fine.

23:04.000 --> 23:06.000
I sort of feel like anything that gets

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
people coding more regularly and improving their

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
craft is good.

23:10.000 --> 23:12.000
I will tell you that since switching to

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
GitHub I am an addict for the

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
that little tile

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
mosaic tile thing on how many commits you do

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
in a day. Yeah.

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
Yeah. It works, right?

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
I mean anybody who's played like World of Warcraft

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
or an MMO knows if there's a bar

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
there's a certain personality type that will fill that

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
bar. Yep.

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
I would say

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
maybe it is like taking advantage

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
of certain dopamine triggers and

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
you know psychological responses

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
and certain personality types.

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
But I don't know. At least

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
I feel like I'm using it for good.

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
Although I should say GitHub is

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
definitely using me.

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
The study by the way was done by Cornell University.

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
And I think it's interesting that they

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
urge caution. I don't know.

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
I think you're right.

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
I think you're probably right. Getting more people to

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
do their craft

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
and get better at that and

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
participate in a community and learn those skills

24:04.000 --> 24:06.000
is generally a good thing. More of that's

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
a good thing. So let's say it's a good trend

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
then. Yeah so addicting to people to positive

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
things is good. I got one that's

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
driving me absolutely crazy

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
and we're just going to have to put up

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
with it. And I'm really debating

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
on how much we even want to talk about it on the show.

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
It's relevant to developers

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
in the sense that

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
developers got to eat,

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
developers got to sell, and developers got to

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
promote. But

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
I think this trend

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
that's always been there since

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
the early days of Apple, people

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
used to attribute everything

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
Apple did, every arrogant move,

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
every petulant thing Apple did, they

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
attributed it directly to Jobs. Then Steve Jobs

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
died and Apple just got more

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
petulant.

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
And we're seeing that now with Elon.

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
Somebody's tweet gets

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
labeled as misinformation and you

24:54.000 --> 24:56.000
see somebody posting, oh snap

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
dog, Elon just labeled this

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
post misinformation, shoot.

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
Elon makes

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
this decision. It's going to be Elon this,

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
Elon that. It becomes a cult of

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
personality, completely disregards

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
all of the engineers and developers and

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
people underneath all that that are

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
actually involved in the decision process.

25:14.000 --> 25:16.000
And also I think where it matters

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
to our audience is if they are on social

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
media to help promote their app, their site, their service,

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
their business,

25:22.000 --> 25:24.000
you're kind of watching this a little bit going

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
where the hell is this going?

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
And how is this going to affect me?

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
I don't know if you saw this and just picture

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
yourself as one of these engineers for a

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
moment. Because I'm

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
a Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
about this. Part of me absolutely

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
loves the

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
savageness

25:42.000 --> 25:44.000
of it and then part of me thinks like

25:44.000 --> 25:46.000
God could you imagine being an engineer in this position.

25:46.000 --> 25:48.000
So Twitter engineers were told to print

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
out their last 30 to 60 days

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
of code so they could show it to Elon

25:52.000 --> 25:54.000
himself. Then they were told to wait, actually

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
just shred all that code you printed out and

25:56.000 --> 25:58.000
upload it to this platform.

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
And Elon has brought in Tesla

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
engineers to do code

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
reviews of everyone's last 30 days

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
of the work. And then

26:06.000 --> 26:08.000
you may end up having a little conversation

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
with Elon or a Tesla engineer

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
who's essentially a proxy.

26:12.000 --> 26:14.000
In one way like I said it's

26:14.000 --> 26:16.000
absolutely savage because you'll only

26:16.000 --> 26:18.000
truly get answers to what's really going on if

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
you go all the way to the source code. At the

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
same time

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
Elon is setting these deadlines like if you don't

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
get it done you're fired. Another one is

26:26.000 --> 26:28.000
they're trying to build Twitter blue so that way it's

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
a $20 a month subscription.

26:30.000 --> 26:32.000
And Elon gave them like a deadline at

26:32.000 --> 26:34.000
the end of November and if they don't get it done they're

26:34.000 --> 26:36.000
fired. So it's really

26:36.000 --> 26:38.000
just like we're reviewing your code we're going to sit down

26:38.000 --> 26:40.000
at your desk with you we're going to go over it we're going to ask you

26:40.000 --> 26:42.000
questions and oh by the way you also

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000
need to get this new feature built

26:44.000 --> 26:46.000
and if you don't get it done you're fired.

26:46.000 --> 26:48.000
Part of me thinks God this is a brilliant strategy

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
by Elon because he's going to totally

26:50.000 --> 26:52.000
clean house and bring the head count down which is job

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
number one. It sounds absolutely terrifying

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
as a human being to be in that

26:56.000 --> 26:58.000
position as a staffer to have

26:58.000 --> 27:00.000
the world's richest man or his proxy

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
sit down next to you and ask you well what the hell

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000
are you doing here. First of all Steve Jobs

27:04.000 --> 27:06.000
used to do this all the time.

27:06.000 --> 27:08.000
All the time. Right.

27:08.000 --> 27:10.000
Get it done or get out

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
was his his his line

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
right. I only want A players.

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
He did a speech when he was an

27:16.000 --> 27:18.000
interview. In fact I have it on tape.

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
It was when he was at next talking about

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
why B players suck and they're not. I know

27:22.000 --> 27:24.000
A players only want to play with A players

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
and if you make them play with B and C players they get pissed off

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
and they want to leave. As a management practice

27:28.000 --> 27:30.000
no it's probably not great right.

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
But I wisely

27:32.000 --> 27:34.000
thanks to the admonishment of an

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
older more beautiful haired

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
friend of mine named Chris Fisher

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
refrained from tweeting anything about

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
the Twitter acquisition

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
because remember Chris Fisher says tweeting

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
is bad. You'll notice

27:46.000 --> 27:48.000
I very tweet very rarely.

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
You notice my tweets have gone down significantly

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
since that episode. I just

27:52.000 --> 27:54.000
put that out there. It's

27:54.000 --> 27:56.000
hard to overstate how

27:56.000 --> 27:58.000
mismanaged Twitter really has

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
been for very long

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
and Twitter's headcount doesn't make a

28:02.000 --> 28:04.000
ton of sense. I'm

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
sort of surprised at all this pearl clutching

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
about the people at Twitter

28:08.000 --> 28:10.000
when if you look at Twitter

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
I mean it's a

28:12.000 --> 28:14.000
shitty business.

28:14.000 --> 28:16.000
It's not well run.

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
For instance someone I saw tweet from one of

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
the Twitter employees Elon made this change

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
and you know normally it would have

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
taken weeks of debate between the teams

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
and he's bragging about that as they're so

28:26.000 --> 28:28.000
thoughtful. That's fucking terrible.

28:28.000 --> 28:30.000
You should resign

28:30.000 --> 28:32.000
in shame.

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
You're the tech business baby.

28:34.000 --> 28:36.000
Roll roll roll.

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
I think it sucks that

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
they're in California and he can't just walk in

28:40.000 --> 28:42.000
and fire them all like you could in Florida and give

28:42.000 --> 28:44.000
them nothing because

28:44.000 --> 28:46.000
I feel like a lot of that's what should just

28:46.000 --> 28:48.000
happen and I know California has

28:48.000 --> 28:50.000
stupid mandatory severance

28:50.000 --> 28:52.000
but usually I'm more

28:52.000 --> 28:54.000
sympathetic to the employees but

28:54.000 --> 28:56.000
8000 people

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
and the best they could

28:58.000 --> 29:00.000
come up with Twitter blue is that I can change the

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
color on the goddamn

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
highlight in the app and I can

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
briefly edit my tweet

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
or undo it to edit it and then they

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
edit a different kind of edit feature later.

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
That's

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
like I know

29:14.000 --> 29:16.000
this is going to piss off a lot of the audience but like

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
maybe Twitter should have focused

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
on being a functional business

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
that is like a peer

29:22.000 --> 29:24.000
to Facebook and you know it's direct

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000
competitor and less about

29:26.000 --> 29:28.000
you know wearing the hair shirt

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
and being the Virgin Mary on whatever

29:30.000 --> 29:32.000
political ideology you may or may not have.

29:32.000 --> 29:34.000
I think I agree I typically

29:34.000 --> 29:36.000
I typically try to

29:36.000 --> 29:38.000
be empathetic with the employee

29:38.000 --> 29:40.000
in this situation but I think my inclination

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
would be to go full boss mode here because

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
he just made a huge acquisition

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
he massively overpaid

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
he's got to make this thing work.

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
He's also I think probably

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
smart enough to realize he's got a window

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
of time he's got about 90 days

29:54.000 --> 29:56.000
you know like when a president comes into office

29:56.000 --> 29:58.000
he's got 100 days he's got 90

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
days and then he's got other things

30:00.000 --> 30:02.000
that need his focus like SpaceX

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
and Tesla. Additionally

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
he's in deep with military contracts

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
so he's got a lot of pressure

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
there to publicly get this

30:10.000 --> 30:12.000
right. If you are involved at all

30:12.000 --> 30:14.000
with that kind of stuff you see how

30:14.000 --> 30:16.000
when things start looking bad

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
for you and your company the military gets less and less

30:18.000 --> 30:20.000
interested in working with you they don't want that to

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
rub off on them. Well it's true if you have

30:22.000 --> 30:24.000
financial strain you cannot

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
you generally will not pass a background

30:26.000 --> 30:28.000
check and that goes for companies

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
and individuals so yes. The other reality

30:30.000 --> 30:32.000
here is that a lot of the collateral

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
Elon put down to make this purchase came

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
from his Tesla stock and

30:36.000 --> 30:38.000
if we go into a two year

30:38.000 --> 30:40.000
recession I have to imagine

30:40.000 --> 30:42.000
Tesla stock is going down. Tesla

30:42.000 --> 30:44.000
just recently announced

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
they're lowering the price of

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
Teslas in China

30:48.000 --> 30:50.000
because China's entering a recession

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
and so they're lowering the price of the car

30:52.000 --> 30:54.000
so in China you can get a Tesla cheaper

30:54.000 --> 30:56.000
now and it's probably going to happen here and if that

30:56.000 --> 30:58.000
announcement happens you know their stock is going to

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
go down. That means the value of his collateral

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
will go down which means that he's

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
going to be on pressure to either add more collateral

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
or find another source of funding

31:06.000 --> 31:08.000
all of which means act quick

31:08.000 --> 31:10.000
act ruthlessly turn this thing around

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
figure out where the rot actually is

31:12.000 --> 31:14.000
because I think all of us regardless

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
of your position would acknowledge there has

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
to be some rot inside Twitter.

31:18.000 --> 31:20.000
It's also that but Chris let's just say like

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
JB and the Mad Botter

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
merged right

31:24.000 --> 31:26.000
and you were the new boss and

31:26.000 --> 31:28.000
you found out that a couple of my employees

31:28.000 --> 31:30.000
were just going around

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
talking about what an asshole you are

31:32.000 --> 31:34.000
and you know the Jupiter culture

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
the TMB culture is never going to be the same

31:36.000 --> 31:38.000
because of Jupiter broadcasting

31:38.000 --> 31:40.000
I mean I

31:40.000 --> 31:42.000
feel like Elon's been incredibly patient

31:42.000 --> 31:44.000
I would expect you to simply fire them or worse

31:44.000 --> 31:46.000
make me fire them right. Well here's

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
my question for you is maybe this should be a little more standard

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
practice because what is actually the product he just

31:50.000 --> 31:52.000
paid 44 billion dollars for if not the source code

31:52.000 --> 31:54.000
and the staff right. So it's a great

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
time to figure out what the hell's in the code. Printing it out

31:56.000 --> 31:58.000
is a little is a little silly printing it on

31:58.000 --> 32:00.000
paper. That was that was corrected. Of

32:00.000 --> 32:02.000
course he wants the code reviewed. In

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
fact if he didn't waive due diligence he

32:04.000 --> 32:06.000
probably should have done that before.

32:06.000 --> 32:08.000
I mean I don't I don't

32:08.000 --> 32:10.000
know. It's just like

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
and I'm not saying that I

32:12.000 --> 32:14.000
want Twitter to become a hellscape or anything like

32:14.000 --> 32:16.000
that. It's the idea

32:16.000 --> 32:18.000
that man buys

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
company. All these people now work

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
for this guy and they spend it seems

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
like a good part of their working day just

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
watching him spying on him bashing

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
the out of him.

32:28.000 --> 32:30.000
Yeah let's reverse it. We merge

32:30.000 --> 32:32.000
I'm in charge.

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
You better believe if somebody is running around

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
saying how much I suck and oh he did this

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
stupid jackass thing that I just fire them.

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
Did you see that screenshot

32:40.000 --> 32:42.000
that Elon posted where they admitted

32:42.000 --> 32:44.000
in their internal chats to

32:44.000 --> 32:46.000
fluffing the numbers.

32:46.000 --> 32:48.000
And they said literally we're

32:48.000 --> 32:50.000
basically doing what Elon is accusing

32:50.000 --> 32:52.000
us of. And I'm sure that they are

32:52.000 --> 32:54.000
right. You know

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
what's funny on Twitter

32:56.000 --> 32:58.000
I have noticed a lot less

32:58.000 --> 33:00.000
engagement. Now granted I've been posting

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
less maybe that's the algorithm but

33:02.000 --> 33:04.000
my whole feed

33:04.000 --> 33:06.000
is just like Elon Hay and Magic the Gathering

33:06.000 --> 33:08.000
30th anniversary of course.

33:08.000 --> 33:10.000
Mine's Elon Hay and Star Trek.

33:10.000 --> 33:12.000
Right. So we have our vices but

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
yeah. And I have

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
been I swear to God less

33:16.000 --> 33:18.000
like you shall post like a coding tip

33:18.000 --> 33:20.000
or something every couple days just

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
the amount of like political

33:22.000 --> 33:24.000
vitriol like this isn't a club

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
I want to hang out at anymore. This is not

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
a bar I want to hang out at. Yeah. And ironically

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
Mike I my prediction ultimately

33:30.000 --> 33:32.000
is is that the reign

33:32.000 --> 33:34.000
of Elon is not significantly that

33:34.000 --> 33:36.000
much different in terms of moderation and

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
censorship. Well he already said he's

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
forming a council which is exactly what they always

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
said. So it's like it just means

33:42.000 --> 33:44.000
maybe the moderation and the censoring will take

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
longer as the council has to form

33:46.000 --> 33:48.000
or whatever instead of just like some

33:48.000 --> 33:50.000
Twitter employee internally deciding to flag

33:50.000 --> 33:52.000
it. But it's still going to happen.

33:52.000 --> 33:54.000
It's not. I have purchased

33:54.000 --> 33:56.000
over the years not a ton but

33:56.000 --> 33:58.000
it's not insignificant amount for the size

33:58.000 --> 34:00.000
of my business Twitter ads. And

34:00.000 --> 34:02.000
as much as I hate Facebook I would

34:02.000 --> 34:04.000
take every dollar if I was to

34:04.000 --> 34:06.000
do that kind of advertising again and put it

34:06.000 --> 34:08.000
to Facebook. Yeah. The results

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
I did a AB the results were pretty

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
pretty clear.

34:12.000 --> 34:14.000
I mean if he lays off

34:14.000 --> 34:16.000
a good chunk of people and does a $20

34:16.000 --> 34:18.000
a month Twitter blue that

34:18.000 --> 34:20.000
you know to get verified that all of these media

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
personnel every all the you know Twitter

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
elites are going to sign they're all going to pay the 20 bucks

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
to keep their check mark. He may just

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
turn it around in a couple of days. He's

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
given a deadline in November 7th. I just looked it up

34:30.000 --> 34:32.000
not the end of November. He gave the developers

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
November 7th to get that going. He gave

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
them Halloween with their kids. See

34:36.000 --> 34:38.000
yeah it's so nice of him. You know I think

34:38.000 --> 34:40.000
people who think Elon is an idiot and

34:40.000 --> 34:42.000
you know everything that everything

34:42.000 --> 34:44.000
that's happened to him has just been dumb luck and that he hasn't

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
built anything and he isn't any kind of engineer

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
as we've been debating. I think they're missing

34:48.000 --> 34:50.000
the mark. I think what he is is erratic. He's

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
manic. He's manic and he probably doesn't

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
have you know a governor that says don't

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
post that like he just recently posted

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
something about Nancy Pelosi's husband

34:58.000 --> 35:00.000
didn't even need to get in wait into that right.

35:00.000 --> 35:02.000
Just don't even wait into that. Now that was

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
just stupid. Yeah that was it was dumb.

35:04.000 --> 35:06.000
Yeah but he has been very

35:06.000 --> 35:08.000
savvy in some ways like he's taking this private

35:08.000 --> 35:10.000
so that way he can basically butcher the internals

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
of the company and not worry about the stock price and the

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
shareholders freaking out right. That's a pretty

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
clever move just because if you're really going to make brutal

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
changes that's how you do it. I don't know if

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
we can see are we going to watch this guy run three or four

35:20.000 --> 35:22.000
companies. That's going to be interesting.

35:22.000 --> 35:24.000
He's going to have to hire right. This

35:24.000 --> 35:26.000
is this. He's not the first. This is not

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
like that unique of a situation.

35:28.000 --> 35:30.000
He's going to be here for maybe a month

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
maybe two. He's going to do

35:32.000 --> 35:34.000
the dirty work because he and then he'll

35:34.000 --> 35:36.000
bring in a healer right.

35:36.000 --> 35:38.000
A you know

35:38.000 --> 35:40.000
agreeable CEO to the remaining

35:40.000 --> 35:42.000
staff. That's going to be like we've been through

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
some hard times guys but I'm your guy

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
now and or gal.

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
And you know what we're going to build back better.

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
We're going to. It's going to be Joe Biden.

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
No I think you're right. I think it'll be a woman.

35:52.000 --> 35:54.000
I think that's I think that'd be a smart move. I said

35:54.000 --> 35:56.000
Joe Biden you said woman. That's that's not a great

35:56.000 --> 35:58.000
clip. It just

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
can't be Sheryl Sandberg because

36:00.000 --> 36:02.000
that idea wouldn't that be funny.

36:02.000 --> 36:04.000
That'd be terrible. That'd be hilarious.

36:04.000 --> 36:06.000
No one wins in that scenario.

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
I mean everybody's going to be looking for

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
a job soon if things keep going on. This is wild

36:10.000 --> 36:12.000
so Metta's revenue

36:12.000 --> 36:14.000
are down just a titch like 4 percent

36:14.000 --> 36:16.000
just kind of a minor miss

36:16.000 --> 36:18.000
with everything going on especially

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
the absolute decline

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
in the advertising business which is what hit them.

36:22.000 --> 36:24.000
Wall Street absolutely freaked out about the decline

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
but then also when combined with the increased

36:26.000 --> 36:28.000
expenses and investment in the metaverse

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
stuff Metta

36:30.000 --> 36:32.000
was punished. Their stock looked like

36:32.000 --> 36:34.000
like a crap cryptocurrency that

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
Elon had recently pumped. It was

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
a crash.

36:38.000 --> 36:40.000
I mean we haven't seen anything like that in a while.

36:40.000 --> 36:42.000
Jim Cramer your good buddy on CNBC

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
actually cried

36:44.000 --> 36:46.000
on television because he's been pumping Metta

36:46.000 --> 36:48.000
all year. Metta's going to the moon he's been saying

36:48.000 --> 36:50.000
and he got called out on live TV

36:50.000 --> 36:52.000
and he started shedding a tear.

36:52.000 --> 36:54.000
Such an idiot.

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
No no. First of all be nice to my

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
good buddy Jim Cramer. We all know each other if

36:58.000 --> 37:00.000
we've ever been to New York. We literally are

37:00.000 --> 37:02.000
all cousins. Second

37:02.000 --> 37:04.000
of all he's not the first person to get seduced

37:04.000 --> 37:06.000
and screwed over by Mark Zuckerberg.

37:06.000 --> 37:08.000
So you know

37:08.000 --> 37:10.000
cue Edward Stafford.

37:10.000 --> 37:12.000
We got to play this. I got to play this for you because it's just

37:12.000 --> 37:14.000
so. Do it. Play. I knew you were

37:14.000 --> 37:16.000
going to do this. It's so awkward.

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
Alright go ahead. Free cash flow

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
last year.

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
9.5 billion. Now less

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
than 1 billion.

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
I didn't say this about this.

37:26.000 --> 37:28.000
I made a mistake here.

37:28.000 --> 37:30.000
I was wrong.

37:30.000 --> 37:32.000
I trusted this management team.

37:32.000 --> 37:34.000
That was ill-advised.

37:34.000 --> 37:36.000
Your brochure

37:36.000 --> 37:38.000
is extraordinary.

37:38.000 --> 37:40.000
And I apologize.

37:40.000 --> 37:42.000
Okay.

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
What did you

37:46.000 --> 37:48.000
get wrong? He just sits there and

37:48.000 --> 37:50.000
thinks about it.

37:50.000 --> 37:52.000
It's like Wonder Woman's got him in the

37:52.000 --> 37:54.000
lasso and he's thinking on all his sins.

37:54.000 --> 37:56.000
No.

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
That's a lot of money.

37:58.000 --> 38:00.000
You imagine he and his charitable trust

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
he does this whole thing for charity. I'm pretty

38:02.000 --> 38:04.000
sure he also

38:04.000 --> 38:06.000
majorly screwed up here.

38:06.000 --> 38:08.000
The company's Reality Labs division which houses

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
its VR headsets lost over 9

38:10.000 --> 38:12.000
billion. I'm sorry. I'm sorry

38:12.000 --> 38:14.000
Chris. We call that the we're on a drunk bender

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
burning hundred dollar bills y'all

38:16.000 --> 38:18.000
division. So if you add it all up what they've

38:18.000 --> 38:20.000
spent so far it's more money

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
than Apple spent to create the iPhone. But

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
if you even adjust it for inflation

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
Meta has spent more money

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
on Reality Labs than

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
the US government spent at least from what we know

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
on the atomic bomb even

38:32.000 --> 38:34.000
adjusted for inflation. So you could win

38:34.000 --> 38:36.000
a war build the most successful

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
product of all time and

38:38.000 --> 38:40.000
still not have legs in the metaverse.

38:40.000 --> 38:42.000
I actually think most people's

38:42.000 --> 38:44.000
take on this is wrong because if

38:44.000 --> 38:46.000
you think about it money

38:46.000 --> 38:48.000
numbers have lost really all meaning.

38:48.000 --> 38:50.000
Two hundred and fifty billion is last

38:50.000 --> 38:52.000
year's five years twenty five billion.

38:52.000 --> 38:54.000
Right. I mean the money really like we say

38:54.000 --> 38:56.000
have been saying has been running loose.

38:56.000 --> 38:58.000
And if you're a powerhouse of a company

38:58.000 --> 39:00.000
that's just absolutely harvesting

39:00.000 --> 39:02.000
money on ads by tracking people

39:02.000 --> 39:04.000
and really nailing them with relevant

39:04.000 --> 39:06.000
ads especially like Instagram. I hear that's

39:06.000 --> 39:08.000
really successful on Facebook I imagine

39:08.000 --> 39:10.000
you know from little dabbling I've

39:10.000 --> 39:12.000
done on the advertiser side it seems extremely

39:12.000 --> 39:14.000
accurate. They're harvesting so much

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
money. What do you want them

39:16.000 --> 39:18.000
to do like put it on the bank and let it inflate

39:18.000 --> 39:20.000
away and then draw attention to how much money they're

39:20.000 --> 39:22.000
making as a as an advertiser

39:22.000 --> 39:24.000
or why not

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
dump it into something that might be the next platform because

39:26.000 --> 39:28.000
they also have the Comcast problem here.

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
They've saturated the market.

39:30.000 --> 39:32.000
There's nowhere else to go. So they

39:32.000 --> 39:34.000
either have to just build the next platform

39:34.000 --> 39:36.000
or just wait for Facebook

39:36.000 --> 39:38.000
to eventually fade and die which we all

39:38.000 --> 39:40.000
know it's going to happen. It happens to all these platforms.

39:40.000 --> 39:42.000
So they could you know maybe have

39:42.000 --> 39:44.000
a shot if they could somehow build the next thing

39:44.000 --> 39:46.000
and so why not take that money

39:46.000 --> 39:48.000
why not take that 9 billion

39:48.000 --> 39:50.000
and channel it into research and development.

39:50.000 --> 39:52.000
Now it's a loss. Now it's a

39:52.000 --> 39:54.000
write off. You're not drawing attention to how

39:54.000 --> 39:56.000
much money you're setting on how much money your little tech

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
companies making and you're investing in the

39:58.000 --> 40:00.000
next thing that might possibly work. I actually

40:00.000 --> 40:02.000
don't think it's that crazy of a strategy.

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
The issue is investors

40:04.000 --> 40:06.000
don't want to see crazy amounts of

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
R&D more so than any other tech company

40:08.000 --> 40:10.000
and they don't want to see a decline in revenue

40:10.000 --> 40:12.000
at the same time. If they were spending

40:12.000 --> 40:14.000
1 billion

40:14.000 --> 40:16.000
instead of 9 billion this last quarter if they'd

40:16.000 --> 40:18.000
spent 1 billion in a quarter

40:18.000 --> 40:20.000
I don't think this would be a headline. It wouldn't be a story.

40:20.000 --> 40:22.000
If they'd spent what

40:22.000 --> 40:24.000
Microsoft spends this wouldn't be a story.

40:24.000 --> 40:26.000
But because they spent what Microsoft and Apple

40:26.000 --> 40:28.000
and Google spend combined

40:28.000 --> 40:30.000
it's quite the story.

40:30.000 --> 40:32.000
But then again

40:32.000 --> 40:34.000
it's all relative to how much damn money you got.

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
That's it.

40:36.000 --> 40:38.000
And if you're making a lot of money and money's been

40:38.000 --> 40:40.000
loose it's all relative.

40:40.000 --> 40:42.000
Yeah...

40:42.000 --> 40:44.000
I mean you're right

40:44.000 --> 40:46.000
but it's a lot of

40:46.000 --> 40:48.000
money no matter how you slice it. But what's he gonna

40:48.000 --> 40:50.000
do? He could turn around and spend

40:50.000 --> 40:52.000
that 9 billion on what? Making Facebook

40:52.000 --> 40:54.000
better? It's a mature

40:54.000 --> 40:56.000
product. I don't really

40:56.000 --> 40:58.000
know what else they could get into that would be successful.

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
You see them buy these other things and it just sort of

41:00.000 --> 41:02.000
levels off. Okay so isn't this the Microsoft

41:02.000 --> 41:04.000
problem though? Microsoft

41:04.000 --> 41:06.000
circa 1999

41:06.000 --> 41:08.000
I guess. You have

41:08.000 --> 41:10.000
dominance in one place. You are

41:10.000 --> 41:12.000
extremely mature, extremely successful

41:12.000 --> 41:14.000
product slash business.

41:14.000 --> 41:16.000
And okay so then you get Office

41:16.000 --> 41:18.000
right? This is what they did. They island

41:18.000 --> 41:20.000
hopped into different businesses and

41:20.000 --> 41:22.000
then eventually that was a

41:22.000 --> 41:24.000
problem because of

41:24.000 --> 41:26.000
antitrust. I think that's kind of why

41:26.000 --> 41:28.000
Microsoft's pivot into open source

41:28.000 --> 41:30.000
and really building cross platform development

41:30.000 --> 41:32.000
tools has been so surprising because very

41:32.000 --> 41:34.000
rarely do large companies

41:34.000 --> 41:36.000
make a successful pivot like that. Well I think

41:36.000 --> 41:38.000
it's just it's hard to be good at multiple things.

41:38.000 --> 41:40.000
And I

41:40.000 --> 41:42.000
don't know. Also

41:42.000 --> 41:44.000
Facebook's brand has really taken

41:44.000 --> 41:46.000
a beating right?

41:46.000 --> 41:48.000
I mean even my aunties who love

41:48.000 --> 41:50.000
Facebook because God forbid

41:50.000 --> 41:52.000
they miss a picture of their great nephew.

41:52.000 --> 41:54.000
Kind of

41:54.000 --> 41:56.000
hate it now. Mostly because

41:56.000 --> 41:58.000
it disallows them to fight about

41:58.000 --> 42:00.000
their incredibly strange political

42:00.000 --> 42:02.000
ideas.

42:02.000 --> 42:04.000
One of them is Karl Marx.

42:04.000 --> 42:06.000
One of them is Mussolini.

42:06.000 --> 42:08.000
So that's where I that's where I live.

42:08.000 --> 42:10.000
I hate

42:10.000 --> 42:12.000
Facebook because I can't look for a goddamn

42:12.000 --> 42:14.000
bicycle pump without being haunted for three

42:14.000 --> 42:16.000
months. Yeah then once you get the pump you're still

42:16.000 --> 42:18.000
getting ads for pumps for everything. It's like well I already bought it.

42:18.000 --> 42:20.000
I bought the pump three months. We talked about this on the

42:20.000 --> 42:22.000
air. I bought it through. I'm still getting the ads.

42:22.000 --> 42:24.000
It's like guys I bought a pump.

42:24.000 --> 42:26.000
I'm cool. I buy one car mount once.

42:26.000 --> 42:28.000
Years of car mount ads.

42:28.000 --> 42:30.000
Ask not what your podcast

42:30.000 --> 42:32.000
can boost for you

42:32.000 --> 42:34.000
but what you can boost for your

42:34.000 --> 42:36.000
podcast. We got

42:36.000 --> 42:38.000
a boost from Thought Criminal. Love

42:38.000 --> 42:40.000
that name. Nineteen hundred sats.

42:40.000 --> 42:42.000
Pew pew pew. Headline from the

42:42.000 --> 42:44.000
Beacon. Florida man suspended after

42:44.000 --> 42:46.000
going Newland on a striking mascot.

42:46.000 --> 42:48.000
Suggest better breeding in order.

42:48.000 --> 42:50.000
Takes new bride. I think that's

42:50.000 --> 42:52.000
him congratulating you for the marriage.

42:52.000 --> 42:54.000
The wedding. Thank you I think.

42:54.000 --> 42:56.000
I think. Yeah I love it though.

42:56.000 --> 42:58.000
Yeah you know the mascot

42:58.000 --> 43:00.000
has been pretty active the last couple days on Twitter.

43:00.000 --> 43:02.000
Going after

43:02.000 --> 43:04.000
people setting the record straight. I don't know

43:04.000 --> 43:06.000
if you've noticed that. I know. He's

43:06.000 --> 43:08.000
been our personal Elon. Really has been.

43:08.000 --> 43:10.000
I'm sure he'd love that. I'm sure.

43:10.000 --> 43:12.000
Purple Dog need to set their username

43:12.000 --> 43:14.000
boosted with six thousand sats.

43:14.000 --> 43:16.000
Boost! I've done estimates

43:16.000 --> 43:18.000
to come up with a quote. And then that quote

43:18.000 --> 43:20.000
has been ten to twenty percent padded to

43:20.000 --> 43:22.000
account for unknowns. But then a

43:22.000 --> 43:24.000
PM comes and plugs those estimates into

43:24.000 --> 43:26.000
Microsoft Project without the padding

43:26.000 --> 43:28.000
and tells the client we'll be finished

43:28.000 --> 43:30.000
on this exact date.

43:30.000 --> 43:32.000
Doesn't even account for

43:32.000 --> 43:34.000
annual leave.

43:34.000 --> 43:36.000
Bonus points if there's liquidated damages

43:36.000 --> 43:38.000
for being late. Also been

43:38.000 --> 43:40.000
brought into a project where the estimates for a

43:40.000 --> 43:42.000
web app were done by a developer who had never made

43:42.000 --> 43:44.000
a web app. I don't work there anymore.

43:44.000 --> 43:46.000
I agree.

43:46.000 --> 43:48.000
You know I gotta figure out a way

43:48.000 --> 43:50.000
to work in days off.

43:50.000 --> 43:52.000
I've gotta do it. Cause I'm like

43:52.000 --> 43:54.000
on a decade of no days off.

43:54.000 --> 43:56.000
So I gotta figure it out. I think

43:56.000 --> 43:58.000
what I need is a backup crew.

43:58.000 --> 44:00.000
You know like what is it called when you're in

44:00.000 --> 44:02.000
theater and you have like a person

44:02.000 --> 44:04.000
like an understudy. Yeah we need understudies

44:04.000 --> 44:06.000
dude. You know

44:06.000 --> 44:08.000
you just call up the understudy like hey man it's Halloween today

44:08.000 --> 44:10.000
I need you to fill in. Can you imagine?

44:10.000 --> 44:12.000
I think it'd be awesome.

44:12.000 --> 44:14.000
You know what the problem is though the understudies would start

44:14.000 --> 44:16.000
wanting to get jealous. Have you never seen Phantom

44:16.000 --> 44:18.000
of the Opera? We'll have a coup.

44:18.000 --> 44:20.000
Yeah. People would like them more

44:20.000 --> 44:22.000
because they wouldn't be so grumpy. You know

44:22.000 --> 44:24.000
they'd think everything's great cause they'd probably be younger I'm assuming.

44:24.000 --> 44:26.000
Cause I couldn't have an older understudy.

44:26.000 --> 44:28.000
I hated everything back in 2012. That's true.

44:28.000 --> 44:30.000
In fact I've mellowed out a lot.

44:30.000 --> 44:32.000
But the new ones they love everything.

44:32.000 --> 44:34.000
Anything that's new they love it.

44:34.000 --> 44:36.000
I love when I talk to someone super new to

44:36.000 --> 44:38.000
dev and they're like hey man I can just

44:38.000 --> 44:40.000
generate this on the server. I'm like

44:40.000 --> 44:42.000
you've discovered ERB or Jinja

44:42.000 --> 44:44.000
or any of the other technologies.

44:44.000 --> 44:46.000
All these things you're like oh that'll ultimately burn you.

44:46.000 --> 44:48.000
But they're still new to it.

44:48.000 --> 44:50.000
Every time someone says hey did you not see

44:50.000 --> 44:52.000
this thing? It's great. It's called Xamarin Forms.

44:52.000 --> 44:54.000
Be honest with me.

44:54.000 --> 44:56.000
Could you have an understudy that's older

44:56.000 --> 44:58.000
than you?

44:58.000 --> 45:00.000
That's weird right?

45:00.000 --> 45:02.000
I think I'd prefer it.

45:02.000 --> 45:04.000
Really? I think that sets up like a

45:04.000 --> 45:06.000
mentor. So you think you have this

45:06.000 --> 45:08.000
reverse personal relationship.

45:08.000 --> 45:10.000
I don't like it. Like a couple years ago

45:10.000 --> 45:12.000
I got pulled over by a cop. I don't

45:12.000 --> 45:14.000
actually remember why. I don't think it was that big of a deal but he was mad.

45:14.000 --> 45:16.000
Chris was shooting out the window.

45:16.000 --> 45:18.000
He was just like f***ing Mac 10.

45:18.000 --> 45:20.000
And I was drinking. Running on Macbook Air.

45:20.000 --> 45:22.000
I would guess he was like 22

45:22.000 --> 45:24.000
23 years old. Oh no.

45:24.000 --> 45:26.000
Almost half my age and it felt so

45:26.000 --> 45:28.000
weird to get talked down to by somebody

45:28.000 --> 45:30.000
half my age. I was like oh this is weird.

45:30.000 --> 45:32.000
You think alright son. Shut up.

45:32.000 --> 45:34.000
Right?

45:34.000 --> 45:36.000
No. Marcel boosts in

45:36.000 --> 45:38.000
with some Enterprise SATs 1701.

45:40.000 --> 45:42.000
I think the problem is a lot of these

45:42.000 --> 45:44.000
regulations around what's an engineer are just really

45:44.000 --> 45:46.000
outdated. Civil engineering boo-boos

45:46.000 --> 45:48.000
have been the cause for hundreds of lives.

45:48.000 --> 45:50.000
Hopefully JavaScript is never put in

45:50.000 --> 45:52.000
charge of something with that kind of power.

45:52.000 --> 45:54.000
I have some terrible news for him but keep going.

45:54.000 --> 45:56.000
I know. I know.

45:56.000 --> 45:58.000
And the worst part is they're front ends to access

45:58.000 --> 46:00.000
databases. Is complaining about

46:00.000 --> 46:02.000
a stoplight really a

46:02.000 --> 46:04.000
form of practicing engineering?

46:04.000 --> 46:06.000
If you claim that a bit of back of the napkin

46:06.000 --> 46:08.000
math is engineering then doesn't that

46:08.000 --> 46:10.000
sort of invalidate the entire profession?

46:10.000 --> 46:12.000
That is a huge point. Yeah.

46:12.000 --> 46:14.000
Great point.

46:14.000 --> 46:16.000
I'm going to read it again. If you claim that

46:16.000 --> 46:18.000
a bit of back of napkin math is

46:18.000 --> 46:20.000
essentially engineering doesn't that invalidate

46:20.000 --> 46:22.000
the profession? Napkin math

46:22.000 --> 46:24.000
by amateurs is engineering

46:24.000 --> 46:26.000
so engineering is napkin math

46:26.000 --> 46:28.000
by amateurs.

46:28.000 --> 46:30.000
Congrats on the wedding by the way.

46:30.000 --> 46:32.000
Thank you. So wow Marcel

46:32.000 --> 46:34.000
we totally

46:34.000 --> 46:36.000
missed this. You nailed this correct.

46:36.000 --> 46:38.000
The whole engineering no engineering

46:38.000 --> 46:40.000
whatever licensing is irrelevant to the case

46:40.000 --> 46:42.000
that came up. The gentleman who

46:42.000 --> 46:44.000
found that the stoplights were defective in what was it

46:44.000 --> 46:46.000
Oregon? Yeah.

46:46.000 --> 46:48.000
Yeah. He was just doing arithmetic.

46:48.000 --> 46:50.000
He has math. Not even like

46:50.000 --> 46:52.000
fancy. It was freaking arithmetic.

46:52.000 --> 46:54.000
You know let's be honest it probably started like he noticed

46:54.000 --> 46:56.000
the timing of the lights was probably off

46:56.000 --> 46:58.000
and it probably just went from there. Right. He probably had

46:58.000 --> 47:00.000
like an intuitive feeling and then was like yeah

47:00.000 --> 47:02.000
let me time this. I want to see.

47:02.000 --> 47:04.000
That's a huge point. And I can give

47:04.000 --> 47:06.000
a real example of this. I am not a CPA nor

47:06.000 --> 47:08.000
am I an accredited accountant of any kind.

47:08.000 --> 47:10.000
My friend owns a bar. He

47:10.000 --> 47:12.000
once asked me to help him figure out the profit

47:12.000 --> 47:14.000
margin. There was some deal with a local

47:14.000 --> 47:16.000
brewery on a keg of beer. These are the types

47:16.000 --> 47:18.000
of problems I face when I go out to lunch by

47:18.000 --> 47:20.000
the way. Sure. And naturally

47:20.000 --> 47:22.000
and you know what was I

47:22.000 --> 47:24.000
illegally operating as a CPA telling him the margins

47:24.000 --> 47:26.000
were only like 15 percent and they were screwing

47:26.000 --> 47:28.000
him because they lowered they lowered

47:28.000 --> 47:30.000
the price by 10 percent

47:30.000 --> 47:32.000
but they cut the size of the keg by

47:32.000 --> 47:34.000
25. You just have good

47:34.000 --> 47:36.000
lobes for business. I do have

47:36.000 --> 47:38.000
the lobes. Well my sales

47:38.000 --> 47:40.000
last quarter would suggest they don't but

47:40.000 --> 47:42.000
I don't

47:42.000 --> 47:44.000
know if that's your fault though. That might be you know

47:44.000 --> 47:46.000
when they fire people at Twitter I'm just going to get a job at Twitter.

47:46.000 --> 47:48.000
That's my plan. There you go. All

47:48.000 --> 47:50.000
right. We're going to round it out now

47:50.000 --> 47:52.000
with our last two boosts. Neve

47:52.000 --> 47:54.000
boosted in B O O S T

47:54.000 --> 47:56.000
with a row of ducks.

48:00.000 --> 48:02.000
So

48:02.000 --> 48:04.000
my dedicated EMAX machine is actually

48:04.000 --> 48:06.000
my faithful old System

48:06.000 --> 48:08.000
76 Lamer Pro the Lamer

48:08.000 --> 48:10.000
it boots Gentoo.

48:10.000 --> 48:12.000
Oh my God. And then hooks

48:12.000 --> 48:14.000
EMAX in right into a

48:14.000 --> 48:16.000
I guess rat poison

48:16.000 --> 48:18.000
window manager session. Incredible.

48:18.000 --> 48:20.000
I don't really code with EMAX

48:20.000 --> 48:22.000
but I almost exclusively use org

48:22.000 --> 48:24.000
mode for my writing in D&D campaigns

48:24.000 --> 48:26.000
work on my own website powered by Hugo.

48:26.000 --> 48:28.000
Hey on it. And I write notes.

48:28.000 --> 48:30.000
This is like nerd bingo. Yeah it is really

48:30.000 --> 48:32.000
a ding ding ding. Yeah. And he

48:32.000 --> 48:34.000
writes notes and documentation as well

48:34.000 --> 48:36.000
as writes ansible deployment scripts.

48:36.000 --> 48:38.000
You do bingo. Of course you do.

48:38.000 --> 48:40.000
A.K.A.

48:40.000 --> 48:42.000
automating Gentoo installations naturally

48:42.000 --> 48:44.000
because why not. I mean you got it right.

48:44.000 --> 48:46.000
He says for the record Neve

48:46.000 --> 48:48.000
says he doesn't work in tech works in

48:48.000 --> 48:50.000
logistics. I had no idea after

48:50.000 --> 48:52.000
that. I would after that description I

48:52.000 --> 48:54.000
would have absolutely assumed

48:54.000 --> 48:56.000
the the opposite. So thanks for the clarification.

48:56.000 --> 48:58.000
And our last boosts

48:58.000 --> 49:00.000
no almost last boost

49:00.000 --> 49:02.000
from

49:02.000 --> 49:04.000
a Hanukkah coming in hot with the

49:04.000 --> 49:06.000
news just said thanks for the awesome coin

49:06.000 --> 49:08.000
summary with six thousand sats.

49:08.000 --> 49:10.000
You're welcome. I hate to see

49:10.000 --> 49:12.000
the dog going getting pumped by Elon but

49:12.000 --> 49:14.000
it is what it is. And then

49:14.000 --> 49:16.000
we got ourselves a quick little

49:16.000 --> 49:18.000
boost from Mr. Quackers who just

49:18.000 --> 49:20.000
wanted to call him quack relations you Mike.

49:20.000 --> 49:22.000
I think that's a congrats. I'll take it.

49:22.000 --> 49:24.000
It's a treasure.

49:24.000 --> 49:26.000
You

49:26.000 --> 49:28.000
got you got you got people out there

49:28.000 --> 49:30.000
that wanted to send you some good wishes in

49:30.000 --> 49:32.000
their own way. Oh and actually the new wife

49:32.000 --> 49:34.000
sent me a message. Oh yeah.

49:34.000 --> 49:36.000
I sort of I would say

49:36.000 --> 49:38.000
forced but I got her an

49:38.000 --> 49:40.000
iPhone when we first got together.

49:40.000 --> 49:42.000
Was she on Android previous. Oh she's real

49:42.000 --> 49:44.000
mad about it. Oh yeah. Oh really been a rough

49:44.000 --> 49:46.000
transition. She wants to know what the best Android

49:46.000 --> 49:48.000
phone is and it looks like

49:48.000 --> 49:50.000
yeah.

49:50.000 --> 49:52.000
Yeah. Oh really

49:52.000 --> 49:54.000
going back a failed transition

49:54.000 --> 49:56.000
a failed transition.

49:56.000 --> 49:58.000
Are you looking at the Paisel seven perhaps.

49:58.000 --> 50:00.000
She likes the Samsung.

50:00.000 --> 50:02.000
The problem is she had one of those crazy

50:02.000 --> 50:04.000
galaxy

50:04.000 --> 50:06.000
twos. So it's been a while.

50:06.000 --> 50:08.000
What's the what's the primary

50:08.000 --> 50:10.000
complaint with the iPhone quote. I hate

50:10.000 --> 50:12.000
everything about it.

50:12.000 --> 50:14.000
She likes I message which I thought was super

50:14.000 --> 50:16.000
interesting. She really likes I message.

50:16.000 --> 50:18.000
She doesn't like safari.

50:18.000 --> 50:20.000
She doesn't like that it doesn't tie into her Google

50:20.000 --> 50:22.000
stuff as well as

50:22.000 --> 50:24.000
as the Android did. She's got to go all in on the

50:24.000 --> 50:26.000
I cloud for that to really. Yeah but she basically

50:26.000 --> 50:28.000
lives in Google Google Docs

50:28.000 --> 50:30.000
and Gmail. Right. Yeah that's becoming really

50:30.000 --> 50:32.000
common. Yeah. Like her whole for

50:32.000 --> 50:34.000
her for her work it's it's

50:34.000 --> 50:36.000
just like passing paper around. So

50:36.000 --> 50:38.000
then you know I try to

50:38.000 --> 50:40.000
get her air mail the third party

50:40.000 --> 50:42.000
iOS app I use but I

50:42.000 --> 50:44.000
myself have trouble with it. It's

50:44.000 --> 50:46.000
handling Google Docs on iOS

50:46.000 --> 50:48.000
is kind of it's

50:48.000 --> 50:50.000
just rough. Yeah that whole Google

50:50.000 --> 50:52.000
ecosystem is just slightly better.

50:52.000 --> 50:54.000
It is better. I think it is somewhat

50:54.000 --> 50:56.000
better. So I'm thinking of I try

50:56.000 --> 50:58.000
to talk her into the pixel though I tell you what

50:58.000 --> 51:00.000
the Samsung has their crap on it. Why the

51:00.000 --> 51:02.000
pixel. It's the same old same old

51:02.000 --> 51:04.000
story. Also the pixel seven

51:04.000 --> 51:06.000
very well reviewed. You should show her

51:06.000 --> 51:08.000
like the MKB HD review or something. People

51:08.000 --> 51:10.000
are liking it. Well she's asking about

51:10.000 --> 51:12.000
folding ones. Oh interesting

51:12.000 --> 51:14.000
interesting. Aren't they super fragile though.

51:14.000 --> 51:16.000
This is something for the audience

51:16.000 --> 51:18.000
get back to us if you have a folding Samsung

51:18.000 --> 51:20.000
get back because you know I might try one myself.

51:20.000 --> 51:22.000
I would be curious as well. I'd really love to know people's

51:22.000 --> 51:24.000
experience and yours or hers if

51:24.000 --> 51:26.000
she gets one. Well you know how I responded to this complaint

51:26.000 --> 51:28.000
right. I bought her the

51:28.000 --> 51:30.000
AirPods Max. There you go.

51:30.000 --> 51:32.000
They will work with an Android. It just takes

51:32.000 --> 51:34.000
a little bit more work. I didn't tell her that

51:34.000 --> 51:36.000
just a little bit. Yeah

51:36.000 --> 51:38.000
if you'd like to send a boost into the show go to new podcast

51:38.000 --> 51:40.000
apps dot com and upgrade to

51:40.000 --> 51:42.000
a podcasting 2.0 app

51:42.000 --> 51:44.000
and send a boost into the show. Also thank you to

51:44.000 --> 51:46.000
our members for investing in the ongoing production.

51:46.000 --> 51:48.000
We have an email in the inbox this week

51:48.000 --> 51:50.000
from a company that wants us to

51:50.000 --> 51:52.000
secretly work with them to basically

51:52.000 --> 51:54.000
do a link share where they'll send us a bunch

51:54.000 --> 51:56.000
of fake downloads if

51:56.000 --> 51:58.000
we pay them. So usually we

51:58.000 --> 52:00.000
get pitched and they want to pay us. But this

52:00.000 --> 52:02.000
week we got pitched on paying them

52:02.000 --> 52:04.000
to jack up our downloads

52:04.000 --> 52:06.000
I guess and then we could turn around and

52:06.000 --> 52:08.000
lie to sponsors.

52:08.000 --> 52:10.000
I guess. I mean the whole

52:10.000 --> 52:12.000
thing is so funny. Is there a word for that? Frowd

52:12.000 --> 52:14.000
Frowd something

52:14.000 --> 52:16.000
Frowd. Frowd

52:16.000 --> 52:18.000
Frowdlient or something. Yeah

52:18.000 --> 52:20.000
well I didn't like it. Ultimately it would

52:20.000 --> 52:22.000
fail because

52:22.000 --> 52:24.000
people have to use the promo codes and go to your

52:24.000 --> 52:26.000
URLs and actually sign up. Yeah

52:26.000 --> 52:28.000
our sponsors it's not clicks right. You got to buy something.

52:28.000 --> 52:30.000
Yeah you actually got to use it.

52:30.000 --> 52:32.000
You got to sign up and try it out

52:32.000 --> 52:34.000
and so if you just send them a bunch of traffic

52:34.000 --> 52:36.000
OK that's that might count for something

52:36.000 --> 52:38.000
but it's not what's going to matter at the end of the day.

52:38.000 --> 52:40.000
So it only works for so long but I guess if you're

52:40.000 --> 52:42.000
doing that kind of stuff you know you're just

52:42.000 --> 52:44.000
running and gunning for money. Maybe you don't care. That's why I

52:44.000 --> 52:46.000
really appreciate our members. You can sign up at

it. We're all going to do it. It's just going to be a phase

53:16.000 --> 53:18.000
of life. It is the winter of Elon

I guess. Now links to what we talked about
