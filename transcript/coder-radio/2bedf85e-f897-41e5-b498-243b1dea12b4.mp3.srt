00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
This is KOTORadio, episode 307, recorded April 30th, 2018.

2
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Hi everyone, and welcome to KOTORadio, Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly show taking a pragmatic look at the art and business of software development and its related technologies.

3
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
This episode is brought to you by our two fine sponsors, Digital Ocean and Linux Academy.

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'll tell you more about those great sponsors as this here show goes on.

5
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
My name is Chris.

6
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
While that's great and all, it's not what really matters.

7
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
No, folks, what matters is our host.

8
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
It's Mr. Michael Dominic, and he's located in the one and only Florida.

9
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Hello, Mike.

10
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Hey, Chris.

11
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Hello. Oh, what's the matter?

12
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Well, you know, I wanted to see a young woman in August who, shall I say, has a big reputation.

13
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
She sure does.

14
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
And yet, I do not have the capital to afford the Snake Lounge.

15
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Mmm. And what's the point if you can't have the Snake Lounge?

16
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I guess I'm not going to be her endgame.

17
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I'm of course referring to Taylor Swift.

18
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
The one and only TayTay.

19
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Long time fan you are.

20
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
He was coming from Florida.

21
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Inspiration of many late-night projects, too, funny enough, as it turns out.

22
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Yeah, let's just...

23
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
We'll move on. We're good.

24
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
We'll move on.

25
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
We probably shouldn't say much more.

26
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
All right, Mr. Dominic.

27
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Well, it's good to be...

28
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I feel like I haven't talked to you in so long, so it's just super good to talk to you.

29
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I know.

30
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I feel that we have fallen into the void somehow.

31
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Yeah, yeah.

32
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I mean, we get detached.

33
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
You know, if we don't talk over the podcast, I just end up following your Twitter feed,

34
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
and you know where that leads to.

35
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
That leads to...

36
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Taylor Swift, you're yelling at me?

37
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Well, eventually, yeah.

38
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
First, though, it leads to us talking about some of our topics today.

39
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Mike and I have decided it's time to come clean.

40
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
We'll have a little Coder Confessional.

41
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:09,000
We like to do this from time to time, despite your preference listening, and it's really...

42
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
We don't care at all.

43
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I just want to make that super clear.

44
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Keep sending those Reddit posts.

45
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Keep upvoting them.

46
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Yeah.

47
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Have fun.

48
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
This is why the good podcaster invented chapter markers, my friend.

49
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
There you go.

50
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Yeah.

51
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Noah, you and I both have just had two very different experiences over the last couple

52
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
of weeks.

53
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
So a week ago, we had Linux Fest Northwest.

54
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:37,000
A week before that, Noah comes into town, and like a wrecking ball, Noah comes in here,

55
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
and we formatted every single PC.

56
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
We reloaded every single operating system.

57
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:50,000
So sitting in front of me right now, that includes one, two, three, four, five systems

58
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:57,000
in this room alone that were wiped, reset up, and everything we've learned in the last

59
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
year was put into these systems.

60
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:05,000
And it was a big shift for me, a big transition, a big jump, and it's been really good so far,

61
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
but I'm still in that early phase.

62
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
And you just got done doing sort of a similar thing.

63
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Yeah.

64
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
So first of all, I hate...

65
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Sure.

66
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
You were correct.

67
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
It didn't work, did it?

68
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Your prediction 305...

69
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
It didn't last long, huh?

70
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:25,000
...that some bit would flip, a flip-flop would just not quite get out of its position, and

71
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I would see a blue screen and throw, flip my shit up on Windows 10.

72
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
So the Windows 10 experiment had lasted two weeks?

73
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Two weeks.

74
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:40,000
And of course, at the same time, I'm watching all you hippies at Linux Fest Northwest, and

75
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I'm thinking, wow, there's Emma.

76
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
She's flashing all those Pop!

77
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
OS USB drives.

78
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Yeah.

79
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
They're cool.

80
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Pop!

81
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
OS 1804.

82
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Huh, I have two USB drives on my desk.

83
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:58,000
And now all of my machines but the MacBook we're recording on, because I didn't have

84
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
time to set up a recording rig on Linux, now run Pop!

85
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,000
OS 1804 with Windows and a VM for various...

86
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Oh, oh, oh, oh, really?

87
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
So you went full Pop!

88
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
OS, VM, Windows.

89
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,000
The only time I have turned on my MacBook is to talk to you today.

90
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Now what was, do you have like a specific moment that was like the straw, or was it

91
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
a collection of things?

92
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
You know, it's weird, right?

93
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Because I know sometimes the listeners think I just like to bash Windows, which is not

94
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
the case.

95
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I just don't like it.

96
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
And it's pretty clear to me from my tweets at Paul Therot that not to do the Windows

97
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
people.

98
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
So I really can't care more than you guys.

99
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
And I kind of like Pop!

100
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
OS.

101
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I mean, I've made no secret of my general like of System76 for lots of reasons, including

102
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,000
they're going to start manufacturing products in Colorado, which I think is great.

103
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I like Linux.

104
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,000
They are offering an LTS stable version based on Ubuntu.

105
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Everything I target to deploy to with a few exceptions is a Linux Ubuntu server.

106
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,000
So, you know, it makes sense, right?

107
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:17,000
It's tough to, I'm not doing a lot of iOS anymore.

108
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I'm not a super big gamer, right?

109
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I have a two year old.

110
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
So the whole gaming thing kind of went by the boards.

111
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
All right.

112
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Give me some meat here.

113
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
So far I got an appetizer.

114
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
But what is it?

115
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
What is it that so you, this is like you're coming back here.

116
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
You're circling back.

117
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,000
What is it about Pop! OS that is appealing to you over Gnome?

118
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
And I'm asking you from like, what makes you right?

119
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Well, I mean, just stock Gnome on or not stock Gnome, but canonicals Gnome.

120
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,000
From the standpoint of I'm going to sit down at this thing and I'm going to do my work.

121
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,000
What is it about Pop! OS that's appealing to you in that's very kind of specific, like

122
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I enjoy using this.

123
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
That's what I'm grokking is I enjoy using this.

124
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
So I'm more likely to sit down and work.

125
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
It's like this weird, untangible thing that makes you more productive.

126
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Am I getting the right read here?

127
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
And what is it?

128
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Well, there's a couple of things.

129
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I was working in Unity for a while, right?

130
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
At least half or part time.

131
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I think Pops implementation of Gnome is maybe less different than Unity.

132
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Although I did also put Gnome 3 on that machine and use that.

133
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I like the Pop! Shop.

134
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I know it's a dumb thing, but like it has Visual Studio, Slack and the basic stuff of my tool chain already in there.

135
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I actually like the UI.

136
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I know people complain that it's pretty bright.

137
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:51,000
And frankly, because it's based on Ubuntu, I get it's the same under the hood as my deployment target.

138
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
So I know that's not really the me, why Pop?

139
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Well, my laptop is a system 76 machine.

140
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,000
And if it wasn't Pop, it would have just been stock 1804, right?

141
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Canonical 1804.

142
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I'll tell you, there's a couple of things that they're doing in it that don't directly speak to me,

143
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,000
but I think could be appealing to someone like yourself.

144
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:16,000
And Carl tweeted you about this, but they put a lot of work into that installer.

145
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:22,000
And one of the things that Ian at system 76 was telling me while I was barbecuing was,

146
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:27,000
they have really cut the boot time down on that Pop OS.

147
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:33,000
And they've really, really cut down a lot of the repeated tasks that you have to do when you're setting up a new system.

148
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Like the installation process can be done on an MV&E system with a good processor.

149
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
It could be done in just a couple of minutes.

150
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Your install finishes in just a couple of minutes.

151
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:46,000
And then it brings you through a post-installation process where you can set up encryption and accounts and stuff like that.

152
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
And it's slick.

153
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
They're doing a really good job there.

154
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:53,000
And the Pop Shop, like you mentioned, is a collaboration between them and elementary OS.

155
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
And it's pretty nice.

156
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:59,000
They have some custom artwork that they've done in there, some banner images and whatnot that aren't in any other distribution.

157
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:07,000
And lastly, and I think maybe the most appealing, they are implementing a recovery partition process,

158
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,000
which I don't really understand why other Linux distributions don't do this.

159
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:20,000
SUSE did this back in the early 2000s, and what it essentially is, it's just like on a Windows machine that you get from Dell.

160
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
And you can recover without having to get an ISO, without having to write a USB disk.

161
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,000
You can boot into that environment and get your system back up and working again.

162
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:34,000
And that seems like a pretty nice feature that really is, I think,

163
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:39,000
driven by the fact that they get support calls on their hardware and they have an idea.

164
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Yeah, right.

165
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
They have an idea of the things their customers are struggling with.

166
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,000
And so they can add something to Pop OS that other distributions don't really have an insight into.

167
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
And that's starting to get interesting.

168
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Yeah, I feel like, you know, a lot of my affinity for Pop has to do with,

169
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I see it as inherently more, not inherently, but theoretically in the future,

170
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
it's going to be more tightly integrated with their hardware.

171
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:13,000
And I know they would not appreciate this label, but really Apple as they ought to have been, right?

172
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Like it's Linux, it works with their hardware.

173
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:22,000
You know, like one thing, and I know they didn't do this, it's just 1804 has a newer kernel.

174
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:28,000
My AMD graphics card on that dumb Dell works out of the box, no problem.

175
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
And I didn't have to do any crazy like compile this from source.

176
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,000
And of course I can do that because I have to compile my own stuff all the time.

177
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
But I don't want to, right?

178
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
That's part of why the recovery partition works.

179
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
It's really kind of about getting back up and running as fast as possible.

180
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Right, multi monitor just works.

181
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
High DPI works.

182
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I have a 4K monitor connected to the machine.

183
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Yeah, I think it's a solid system.

184
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,000
You know, I do worry about a few things in Pop.

185
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Like it is not super clear where they're going with it.

186
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
They did a lot of pretty work on the installer.

187
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:12,000
But I find that kind of odd because you install for like five minutes because it's very fast install.

188
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,000
And then you work at it for months or a year or whatever.

189
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
This is the point I brought up to them.

190
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I said, guys, if things are all going right, customers are buying System76 machines with it already installed.

191
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,000
And if they're having to reload their OS a lot, isn't that a bad sign?

192
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Why all of the effort on the installer?

193
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,000
And they were kind of cagey, but I think it's two reasons.

194
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:44,000
The first reason that they're totally 100% upfront about is we feel like it's initial impression thing.

195
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
You know, you try out Pop OS, you've heard of System76.

196
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,000
You try it, you go, holy shit, this is like one of the best installations I've ever had on Linux.

197
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
This is so great. I'm going to go buy a laptop.

198
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I don't know.

199
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
It's one of the prettiest installs I've ever seen.

200
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Yeah, if that translates to laptop purchases, I don't know.

201
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
But you know what?

202
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
It's an interesting experiment.

203
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
So let them have it.

204
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:05,000
But the other thing that they're not really saying, but it's kind of obvious with all of the way they're positioning this,

205
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:10,000
is I think they want Pop OS to be bigger than just System76 hardware.

206
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Oh no, it works out of the box on my Dell Uber workstation.

207
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Why not?

208
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Why not?

209
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:22,000
And if you think about it, it could be really great to unify a business environment like yourself.

210
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:28,000
So you got some System76 rigs, you got some Dell rigs, you got like maybe an HP Spectre and a NUC.

211
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Put Pop OS on all of them.

212
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Yeah.

213
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
You could do the same thing with Ubuntu proper though.

214
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
So that's why I go back to there's got to be a nut in there.

215
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Like for me, like with plasma, it's like coming back to peak computing.

216
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I've been using this phrase a lot and I apologize if you heard me say peak a lot recently.

217
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
But it really is this for me.

218
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:54,000
When I close a window and then I open it the next day, it opens right back where I left it.

219
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:02,000
And when I have been working on my machine hard all day long, everything is still super fluid.

220
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I can right click on a directory and say open a terminal here.

221
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I can really use the machine the way I want to use it.

222
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:16,000
And it has downsides when you have that much flexibility and power.

223
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:22,000
And that's mostly in the fact that you could be lost for years in just configuring and tweaking the defaults.

224
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:29,000
But if you can kind of find a balance there and find a strategy, it is, man, I don't know.

225
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
I don't know how to describe it.

226
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
It's like it's balance.

227
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Yeah, well, it's more it's just I'm really excited.

228
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:42,000
I'm really excited by a really professional workstation desktop environment that I can load on any hardware I want.

229
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
And so I think you hit it.

230
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
But I'll go and finish.

231
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
No, that's really it.

232
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
That's the thrust of it.

233
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
So I think so because I didn't really have a good answer for your question the first time.

234
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,000
I think I now understand, look, let me Dr. Phil myself here.

235
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
The truth is, I don't have a valid hard reason right now.

236
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
It could have just as easily been stock 1804.

237
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Let me tell you what the reason is.

238
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
If you go to their website right now and you look at Pop!

239
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:10,000
OS, they tell you this is for developers doing AI, IoT makers.

240
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
It's all marketing and I get it.

241
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Where I've been trying to find an Apple machine for me and Apple is very much not saying this is not for you.

242
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
This is for video editors.

243
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
This is for artists.

244
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
And you know what?

245
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Given the choice, I'll take the one that's for me.

246
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:34,000
And I get that in a practical sense, the only – like I like some of the keyboard shortcuts because I'm used to Pop 1710 and they're basically the same in 1804.

247
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:43,000
But I hope and I believe that if this is the way they're marketing their system, they're going to continue to focus on that market, right?

248
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
I'm going to SL it.

249
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,000
It could one day match Snow Leopard.

250
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Well, wow.

251
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Okay.

252
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
I mean, that's a high bar for you.

253
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
So that's – I'm going to think about that for a second.

254
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Not today.

255
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
It's not there yet.

256
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
There's still some rough edges and things.

257
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:09,000
You know, one thing that you've got to give them, assuming that this hardware business holds out, they can cut a check to fly somebody out there to the office to work on something.

258
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
They can hire a developer to bang something out.

259
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
They can re-task one of their employees.

260
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:28,000
When we first started talking about Pop OS, I looked at it from a perspective of how could a hardware company that's trying to get into a position where they can build their own stuff – they're not even there yet.

261
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
They're not even off the ground yet.

262
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,000
They've got to get inventory management figured out.

263
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
They've got to hire factory workers.

264
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
They've got to hire janitorial staff.

265
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:43,000
I mean, there is so much more than just building a PC that they have to learn now.

266
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,000
That some people make their entire career.

267
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:51,000
And so you're telling me these people, a team of about 25, is going to launch an operating system?

268
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
That seemed crazy to me.

269
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
But there's a different way to look at it.

270
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:04,000
And the other perspective could be they have way more capital and resources than a ton of other distributions out there.

271
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:13,000
A lot of other distributions are built off the backs of volunteers, volunteer hardware, volunteer money, with a few paid developers.

272
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Like in the case of Debian, perhaps.

273
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Or Arch.

274
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Look at Arch.

275
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Do they?

276
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Maybe they do.

277
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Do they have the funds?

278
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Arch does.

279
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:27,000
But do they hire a random contractor to just bang something out if they need it?

280
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Or fly someone from elementary OS out to Colorado so they can collaborate on an installer three times?

281
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
I don't know.

282
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
I don't know if they do those things.

283
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
And System76 is in a position to finance that.

284
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Maybe not at the great extents that Apple or Microsoft or Google could.

285
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:46,000
But maybe at an extent greater than perhaps other outfits could.

286
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:58,000
And so if they can build on top of a solid Ubuntu base and just chip away over the next five years at different aspects, they might have something here.

287
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,000
I asked them if they're going to stick with the LTS or if they're going to track current.

288
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
And they're going to track current Ubuntu releases.

289
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,000
So they're going to have a six-month iteration window here.

290
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Right.

291
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
And my understanding is you can optionally stay on the LTS.

292
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Oh, yeah, maybe.

293
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
I don't know.

294
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
I didn't clarify that.

295
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Well, maybe I'm wrong.

296
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Maybe they will just update it.

297
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
I don't know.

298
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
See, that is something that could frighten me.

299
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
I wonder if you would like elementary OS when the next elementary OS comes out.

300
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Because it's another level of refinement, I think, right now.

301
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Because they've just been at it for longer.

302
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
So think about my needs, though.

303
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Right?

304
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
And they're similar to your needs, except I don't do video editing.

305
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:33,000
So I guess they're different.

306
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:38,000
But in theory, this Dell is souped up.

307
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
It's got 32 gigs of RAM.

308
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:43,000
So this Dell is going to be fine for a long time.

309
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:47,000
I will eventually need a new laptop because my Galago sounds like it's going to take off

310
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
and do an airstrike.

311
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Yeah.

312
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Which maybe I should just send it to them.

313
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Because they keep telling me to be fair, they've been good about that.

314
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,000
And I need it so I don't want to mail it to Colorado.

315
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,000
But I will eventually have to do that.

316
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:07,000
When I'm in the market for a new computer, if POP is working for me, let's say six months

317
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
in the future, I decide, you know what?

318
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:16,000
I want a different laptop or whatever or I hire somebody and they need a machine.

319
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Don't you think the first thing I'm going to do is call them or look on their website

320
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
for a promotion and say, well, geez, I'm using POP anyway.

321
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:27,000
I know guaranteed this will work with them.

322
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:35,000
I don't want to say the big A here, but for my needs, and they do not like this characterization,

323
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
but from the business perspective, it is the Linux Apple.

324
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Because if it doesn't work out of the box, you know, I challenge you to buy a Dell Ubuntu

325
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:51,000
machine from the consumer site and call their support line and watch as the lady's head

326
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
explodes.

327
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:57,000
You call System76, it's all they sell.

328
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:02,000
So you're saying that the POP OS strategy in your case could actually work.

329
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:07,000
If you end up loading this on different hardware and you really like it.

330
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
I already did on a Dell.

331
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Yeah.

332
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Okay.

333
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:15,000
And you really like it, then this may actually drive a laptop sale in the future for you.

334
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Well, it's an incentive, right?

335
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
So let's fast forward to like the end of the year.

336
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Right, the end of the year, assuming I don't lose a tremendous amount of money.

337
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Assuming you're still in business.

338
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Right.

339
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Like that's when you want to do purchases, right?

340
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Generally.

341
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Get in that tax window.

342
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:35,000
If someone's going to say, hey, why don't you sell your laptop and buy a new one?

343
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Okay.

344
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:41,000
If I'm using POP, I'm probably going to almost exclusively look at theirs.

345
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Because I hate the process of buying Windows hardware, loading Linux on it, having to go

346
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:53,000
on like the IRC or telegram and having people say, hey, dumb ass, didn't you know that,

347
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
you know, that exact model of AMD won't work till the next kernel version?

348
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Like, no, I don't know that.

349
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
And why should I know that?

350
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Right.

351
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,000
And then Dell being like, oh, well, you loaded a different operating system.

352
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,000
So sending it back to you, which is exactly what happened.

353
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:11,000
So because I failed to reinstall Windows 10 on it when I set it up.

354
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
So I got stuck with that Optiplex.

355
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
But actually, guess what?

356
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
I got the Mac Pro that I wanted.

357
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,000
It's the Dell Optiplex running POP OS, and I'm happy.

358
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
So shove it, Apple.

359
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
All right.

360
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
All right.

361
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
I will.

362
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
I'm sorry.

363
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Yeah.

364
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
I'll make my case, although you are surprisingly convincing me.

365
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
I didn't think you were going to do it.

366
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Well, I'm just trying to get my job done, right?

367
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
I don't care.

368
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Like, I don't care about the distro wars.

369
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
I'm sure elementary is fabulous.

370
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
In fact, don't they employ the elementary guy?

371
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Yeah, Cassidy.

372
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Cassidy, right?

373
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Yeah.

374
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
He's one of the elementary contributors.

375
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,000
I mean, Fedora's wonderful, but I don't want to reinstall every two months.

376
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
No, that's fair, actually.

377
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,000
I really can't argue with anything that you just said that all actually makes a lot of

378
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
sense to me.

379
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:56,000
So I will attempt to give you my position, but I like where you're coming at with this.

380
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:01,000
I really like where your head's at, and the fact is you've thought it through, and it

381
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:05,000
does seem like it could have a lot of long-time potential upside, but I'll give you my case.

382
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:09,000
First, I'm going to mention DigitalOcean, do.co slash coder.

383
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Go there to get a $100 credit when you sign up with a new account.

384
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:18,000
This is a big deal because you can build applications on DigitalOcean in seconds, and a $100 credit

385
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
will last you forever.

386
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,000
It's a great opportunity to play with their mix and match droplets, a flexible droplet

387
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
plan.

388
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
It's about $15 a month.

389
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
You choose the CPU, the memory, the disk, whatever is best for your application.

390
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
You mix and match.

391
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
You've got a rocking system.

392
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,000
You can get deployed in production in less than 55 seconds, or if you want to do some

393
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,000
testing or some learning, DigitalOcean is perfect for that.

394
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:43,000
I run a couple of DO droplets just for myself, personal droplets.

395
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Nextcloud and things like IRC backend servers, and we have a whole fleet of DigitalOcean

396
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,000
droplets for Jupyter broadcasting.

397
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Mumble servers, and streaming systems, and audio servers, and syncing servers, and backup

398
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:04,000
RTMP servers, and backup website servers, and backup download servers.

399
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:09,000
I mean, it's incredible because in less than 55 seconds, you'll have an entire system.

400
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Whatever resource level you need, you can get it deployed.

401
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:16,000
It's a one-click to get the entire OS with the application, say like Ubuntu LTS with

402
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Nginx, or Ubuntu, my go-to, Ubuntu LTS 16.04 right now, but it'll be 18.04 soon, with Docker

403
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:29,000
installed from the official Docker repositories with the correct keys installed so everything

404
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
is signed, good to go.

405
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Good to go.

406
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:35,000
In 55 seconds, you've got an LTS system with Docker ready for you to just load something

407
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
off of Docker Hub.

408
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:42,000
And I go from no system at all, in two minutes and 30 seconds, I've got an entire application

409
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
running, and I'm hitting it on the web.

410
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
And whatever you're doing, it's like that.

411
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:50,000
And then if you ever get stuck, they've got great support and great documentation.

412
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,000
So go try it out, do.co slash coder.

413
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Get a $100 credit, if it's a new account, and play around.

414
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:01,000
My favorite system is just three cents an hour.

415
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:05,000
So I think that $100 credit will get you pretty far.

416
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,000
do.co slash coder.

417
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Thanks DigitalOcean for sponsoring the Coder Radio program.

418
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:16,000
So I had a realization that I like new and shiny on some of my systems, but then there

419
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:21,000
are systems that I want to be incredibly boring, really boring.

420
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,000
I'd even considered never updating them if it was practical, but of course that never

421
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
works out.

422
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:33,000
And so I've been trying different stuff really for about a year to the day, a year and about

423
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
three weeks.

424
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Just, I don't know.

425
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,000
We started out with Arch and Gnome, and we've tried a whole bunch of different things.

426
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,000
If people want the whole story, they can listen to Linux Unplugged.

427
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:51,000
But at the end of this year, I started having people in the different communities kind of

428
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,000
come to me and say, hey, I think there's something going on here that you might want to take

429
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
a look at.

430
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,000
You might like this, because I know some of the problems you've had recently, because

431
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:02,000
I was grousing on Linux Unplugged.

432
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,000
And what essentially people were telling me was, take a look at Kubuntu.

433
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Now, mind you, I've never been a Kubuntu user.

434
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,000
In fact, I've always kind of thought of it as being the least attractive of the Ubuntu

435
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
flavors.

436
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
80.

437
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

438
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:21,000
And Plasma Desktop is fine.

439
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:27,000
But the last Kubuntu LTS was based on Plasma 5.5, which was not a solid release.

440
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
So I just had a bad impression.

441
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:37,000
However, to the Plasma developers' credit, since 5.5, every single version of the desktop

442
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:42,000
has gotten progressively better, uses less memory, more stable, more polished, better

443
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:47,000
themes, better art, better icons, better menus, better defaults, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

444
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:51,000
And they've started now that they've gotten to that point releasing LTS versions of the

445
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:55,000
desktop and of Qt.

446
00:23:55,000 --> 00:24:00,000
So with Kubuntu 18.04, the stars and the planets all lined up.

447
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:06,000
And you've got a base Ubuntu LTS with an LTS kernel as well.

448
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
Then you've got LTS Qt framework.

449
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Then you've got LTS Plasma Desktop on top of that.

450
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:18,000
So from top to bottom, the entire stack is LTS, and in Kubuntu's case, that's three years,

451
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:23,000
three years of the same Qt version, three years of the same desktop environment,

452
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:28,000
three years of the same base Ubuntu OS 18.04.

453
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:34,000
And that's also at the time when the Plasma Desktop is faster and uses less resources

454
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:39,000
than some of the other desktops like GNOME.

455
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:44,000
And it's also my third or fourth go of trying Plasma.

456
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:48,000
So I've kind of learned all the shit I've got to change to make it usable for me.

457
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
And now I've kind of internalized all of that.

458
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,000
And so I'm more receptive to using the UI.

459
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,000
And it's sort of lined up with this whole LTS thing.

460
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:01,000
And so we decided to test it at Linux Fest Northwest because if we are going to break

461
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:06,000
anything, it's during the two-day shit show that is Linux Fest Northwest.

462
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Yeah, it's bad. It breaks every year. Every year it breaks.

463
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Not this year.

464
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Really?

465
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Not this year.

466
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:19,000
This year, it was so easy that Chase, who was running the board, was actually playing pinball

467
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:23,000
on his laptop during the live streams because there was just nothing for him to fix.

468
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
Yeah.

469
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Okay, so what do you attribute that?

470
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
I mean, that's a dramatic change from last year.

471
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:34,000
I attribute it mostly to PulseAudio, OBS, and the Plasma Desktop all kind of having

472
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
multiple years of iteration now.

473
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
Okay.

474
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,000
And we started using them early, and now they've been around for a while.

475
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
And I think it's a solid 1804 release.

476
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
I think 1804 absolutely played a part of that.

477
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:48,000
And you combine it with a pretty stable stack.

478
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:53,000
And I don't know, I think Kubuntu is a really, really professional-grade workstation.

479
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:59,000
If you liked Windows 7, as if, say we're going to take Windows 7, and all the years since

480
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:05,000
Windows 7 were just like cool advancements of Windows 7, like totally redoing the file

481
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:10,000
manager, totally changing the modularity of the desktop, adding cool notification drawer

482
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:15,000
support, and just all these things you could ever possibly dream of.

483
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:21,000
And you put it into Plasma, and then you take about two years now of, well, how do we make

484
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
that look better?

485
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
How do we make that default a bit better?

486
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
How do we tweak that theme?

487
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
How do we get a better icon there?

488
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
How do we get high DPI support a little bit better?

489
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
And it's close.

490
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
It's really getting there.

491
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:36,000
I still have about a two-day, got to change all the defaults process that I go through,

492
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
but it's getting better.

493
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
It's getting a lot better.

494
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:44,000
And I've got it now running on, so I've got five systems in front of me, six total inside

495
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,000
this room, a seventh upstairs, and they're all solid.

496
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
They're all super solid.

497
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
I have three questions.

498
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

499
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,000
Four, but one's just preliminary to clarify because something you said I think was confusing

500
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
for the audience.

501
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:02,000
So call this index zero.

502
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:06,000
Everything was running on KDE or Kubuntu, so no Mac.

503
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,000
That's what I mean.

504
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
No Mac.

505
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
No Mac.

506
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Linux Fest Northwest.

507
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,000
Right.

508
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Okay.

509
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,000
So first question, does this put you out of the market for a Mac Pro and iMac?

510
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Is it possible for you to do everything you want now on Linux?

511
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,000
It's getting really, really, really close because I'm doing a lot less video.

512
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:27,000
If I start up another big video project, I derail that progress, but yeah.

513
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:31,000
Yeah, I'm also experimenting with replacing a couple of the Adobe tools, and that's going

514
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
pretty well, too.

515
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:36,000
Now, why do you think video is the roadblock?

516
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:41,000
It's pretty hard for me to replace Final Cut, especially if I'm doing...

517
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
Okay, so it's a tool chain issue.

518
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,000
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

519
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Yeah.

520
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,000
Yeah.

521
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
But there are competitors.

522
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:54,000
So just this week, I covered it in Linux Action News 51, there was a large GIMP update that

523
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:58,000
added the ability to read attributes from Photoshop files that GIMP did not previously

524
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,000
have, which means some of the old art assets...

525
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Yeah, it's nice.

526
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,000
Some of the old art assets that we could not open in GIMP before are now openable.

527
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:08,000
I don't know if that means I'm going to use it, but I'm going to experiment.

528
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:14,000
And then during all of this reload, I swapped out Audition, which is my multitrack audio

529
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:18,000
editing tool for something called Reaper, which runs on Linux.

530
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,000
It doesn't require a Creative Cloud subscription either, which is a nice perk.

531
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:27,000
And I'm giving that a go for editing this week on Plasma.

532
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:33,000
So the only thing you're saying that seems a little like makes my skin crawl is that

533
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:36,000
you have two days of changing things to make it usable.

534
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
See, that wouldn't pass the mustard for me.

535
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,000
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

536
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
Yeah.

537
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:46,000
I do think that it's two days of not constant changes, but I open up the console, and I

538
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
realize, oh, I like the fonts a little bigger.

539
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:52,000
I open up Dolphin, which is the file manager, and I realize I prefer the tree layout versus

540
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
large icons.

541
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
But this is stuff you would do on a Mac, theoretically.

542
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,000
Oh, yeah, 100%.

543
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,000
Yeah, 100%.

544
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:03,000
Okay, so it's not like you have to radically modify things to...

545
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
No, it's nothing too weird.

546
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:09,000
It'd be really pretty much, with the exception of Gnome 3, it's pretty much like that for

547
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,000
everything.

548
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
Gnome 3, I just have to load a few extensions.

549
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
You know, Gnome 3 is pretty good.

550
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
It's pretty good.

551
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:16,000
You just got to load a couple of extensions to make it good all the way.

552
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:20,000
I like Spotify, which I think uses the Gnome extensions.

553
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
It looks like it does.

554
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
Yeah, well, it uses the media thing where it can come up in there.

555
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,000
Yeah, it's nice, right?

556
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,000
It's nice.

557
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:28,000
But Plasma will support that as well.

558
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
So is this the year of the Linux desktop?

559
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000
Is that what we're saying?

560
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
Can we declare it?

561
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,000
Can we throw the flag into the...

562
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,000
I don't know.

563
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
I really was...

564
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,000
You know me, a couple of weeks ago, I'm like, this is not looking good.

565
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:40,000
I'm having a lot of troubles, having a lot of stability issues.

566
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,000
I could hang out here for three years.

567
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:46,000
I could absolutely hang out here, let Wayland figure itself out, let all that stuff kind

568
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:51,000
of get settled, see where Gnome goes, see how all this canonical IPO stuff shakes out.

569
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
I could totally hang here for three years.

570
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,000
And I feel like...

571
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:58,000
That is the 800-pound Gorilla Write canonical is filing for an IPO.

572
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,000
Yeah.

573
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:04,000
And you know what was awesome is we had everything all set up and all of a sudden one of the

574
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,000
machines started crashing.

575
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
And of course it was our broadcast machine.

576
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:11,000
So the live stream started crashing, our live stream recording started getting interrupted.

577
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:14,000
We're like, oh, we just went through all this work and now we're having stability issues.

578
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,000
What's going on?

579
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:18,000
Well, we dug into it and realized we had a bad power supply.

580
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,000
But at that point, we were kind of getting worried about the installation because we

581
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
started having like weird application errors too.

582
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
And we weren't sure about data corruption.

583
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:30,000
So we sat around and we're like, for like a good two hours, we're like, wow, man, what

584
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,000
do we get?

585
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
Do we kind of go buy new hardware and replace this machine?

586
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:38,000
Like, what are we going to do so we know this is 100% reliable?

587
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,000
It runs 24-7.

588
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
And if it has an issue, that means the show doesn't get done.

589
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
So we want it to be 100% reliable.

590
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,000
We kicked it around.

591
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
And then, you know what we could do?

592
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,000
We said to each other, me and Noah, you know what we could do?

593
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:53,000
We could just swap the drives from the machine I have upstairs as my workstation.

594
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
It's the same exact identical build.

595
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:58,000
It's just got like a better video card.

596
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
And you just take the disks out.

597
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,000
You just put them out, take the MVD drives out, put them in the other one, swap them,

598
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,000
and you set it down.

599
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
You boot it up and everything works.

600
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:11,000
There's no weird like reactivation of licenses that Windows might have.

601
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:16,000
There's like, you know, like I didn't have like one version of Mac OS on this machine

602
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,000
and another version of Mac OS on this machine because, you know, it can't update to the

603
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,000
new high Sierra.

604
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,000
None of that.

605
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,000
None of that.

606
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
It just the machines didn't care.

607
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
The OS didn't care.

608
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:29,000
And that abstraction away from the hardware.

609
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
I don't give a shit about the product.

610
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
I don't need it to be a trash can.

611
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
I don't need it to be a beautiful iMac.

612
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:40,000
I just need it to be very, very fast and have a lot of disk.

613
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,000
And I put it under my table and I never look at it ever.

614
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,000
Creature brother.

615
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,000
And it was so nice.

616
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,000
Black box.

617
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,000
That's all I want.

618
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
It was so nice not to have to worry about any of that.

619
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:55,000
And this having this, you know, generic workstation grade desktop environment on top of a workstation

620
00:31:55,000 --> 00:32:01,000
grade Linux OS was really, really good and very empowering for where we were at because

621
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:04,000
we went from having a major problem to solving it.

622
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,000
And it was, you know, minutes to solve the problem.

623
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:12,000
I really think if I if I stay out of video, which I don't know if I'm going to be able

624
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:18,000
to, but if I stay out of video, I really think I would not need a Mac at all in my life anymore.

625
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
And I really would be very happy.

626
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:23,000
It's not even like a compromise that I'm finally achieving.

627
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
It's I would really enjoy this.

628
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:29,000
I have I mean, have a lot of plasma in front of me right now and I'm very happy about it.

629
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,000
Yeah, no.

630
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:34,000
Next week I'm going to try to record on pop and I think it's going to be where is this

631
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,000
going to go?

632
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,000
Where is it?

633
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,000
As long as you can install Chrome, really.

634
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,000
That's all you really need.

635
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,000
Right.

636
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
I mean, that's the fun as heard on last episode.

637
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,000
Right.

638
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,000
Damn it.

639
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,000
He went back to that.

640
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,000
How do we do that?

641
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,000
All right.

642
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,000
Well, I do have we should move on.

643
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:50,000
We have many more things actually to get to, including some random arse tweets by you.

644
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:55,000
But also, I had a chat with some blokes from Microsoft a couple of weeks ago and I'd love

645
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,000
to.

646
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,000
Poor bastards.

647
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,000
You're telling me.

648
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,000
I'd love to.

649
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:04,000
I'd love to share with you what they told me and then maybe a bit more on our development

650
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,000
desktop topic.

651
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:10,000
But let's take a moment and thank Linux Academy for sponsoring this episode of Quota Radio.

652
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:16,000
I was just having a chat with the folks from Linux Academy on Friday about coming down

653
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,000
to visit.

654
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,000
I don't know if it's going to materialize yet.

655
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,000
They're down in Tejas.

656
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:22,000
And they're doing a bunch of live streaming.

657
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:26,000
And I said, guys, we just crushed it with Linux Fest.

658
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
We've really got something dialed in here.

659
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,000
Would you be interested in the Jupiter broadcasting treatment?

660
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:34,000
Would you like us to come down there and get this all nailed down for you?

661
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
And it may happen.

662
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:40,000
We may one day be doing a quota radio from the offices of Linux Academy.

663
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,000
I don't know.

664
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,000
It's all in the early days.

665
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,000
But I love it.

666
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,000
They're so passionate about this stuff.

667
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,000
And that is what I get excited about.

668
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:52,000
And they just released a whole bunch of new content.

669
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,000
It really is just nonstop at Linux Academy.

670
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
And they've got these real hands-on labs.

671
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
They deploy a real environment.

672
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
Then you take that scenario-based lab.

673
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,000
And they'll spin it up.

674
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:07,000
If it's on AWS, Azure, if it's just a standard Linux course, or you want to learn some OpenStack.

675
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:10,000
And then to supplement all of this, something I haven't mentioned.

676
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,000
But don't forget, they've also got the Scale Your Code interviews.

677
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
You may remember me talking about those.

678
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,000
They're all still available online.

679
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:21,000
You can learn from people that have solved real problems in the industry.

680
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:24,000
There's over 1,200 hours of in-depth video content.

681
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:30,000
Plus there's labs, flashcard contents, hands-on training, and instructor mentoring whenever you need it.

682
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,000
You may have heard these ads before and have never pulled the trigger.

683
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,000
Now is the time.

And go check out 70-plus new courses, challenges, and learning activities that have been slammed down into Linux Academy.

690
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
Man, they're hustling these days.

691
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
LinuxAcademy.com slash coders.

692
00:34:55,000 --> 00:35:01,000
And a big thank you to Linux Academy for sponsoring this here Coder Radio program.

693
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:05,000
LinuxAcademy.com slash coders.

694
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:08,000
Now we move on in the program, Mr. Dominic.

695
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,000
I feel good.

696
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
I feel like you and I just sort of came to a new understanding.

697
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
I like your Pop OS.

698
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
I think you understand what I'm coming at with the Kubuntu thing.

699
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,000
Like, we're coming to a new piece.

700
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
Maybe we're finally done.

701
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
We found the good news of Tux.

702
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,000
And by the way, we'll never be done.

703
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:24,000
Yeah, assuming this doesn't blow up on our face, which of course it will.

704
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,000
Oh, damn it.

705
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,000
Damn it.

706
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,000
That's how it goes.

707
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,000
That's how it goes.

708
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:33,000
Well, so you've been pretty busy on the tweeters, besides just reloading machines and talking with Paul Therot.

709
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:36,000
So I got busy talking with some folks on Microsoft.

710
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,000
And it actually ended up leading to a phone call.

711
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
And to their credit—

712
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
Are you leaving us for the mothership?

713
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,000
Is that what's happening?

714
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:47,000
No, it's just I had to wrap my head around this Azure Sphere OS thing.

715
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
You know, like, what?

716
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:53,000
Microsoft is shipping a Linux kernel now?

717
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
I mean, that is really weird.

718
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
It was only a matter of time.

719
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
Yeah, that's what a lot of folks have said, I suppose.

720
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,000
I just couldn't get it.

721
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
I couldn't really grok it.

722
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:10,000
So I ended up getting to talk with one of the individuals I think that's primarily responsible for the entire project.

723
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:15,000
And it sounded like it really came down to a few things.

724
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:23,000
Number one, an OS that was best suited for real-time operating system type tasks on really, really low resources devices.

725
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:26,000
You know, think a hairdryer with a digital display.

726
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:30,000
And then ranging to more sophisticated IoT devices.

727
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:39,000
And then there was also the fact that people are like experimenting in like the skunk works of these different companies.

728
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:48,000
And when they're experimenting, they're not grabbing the Windows source code off of kernel.org and then building their apps against that and their devices.

729
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,000
They're grabbing the Linux source code because that's what they can get their hands on.

730
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:55,000
They don't have to call up some suit and get a license.

731
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:59,000
They don't have to have some sort of business agreement or some sharing code agreement.

732
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
They just go check out the code.

733
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:09,000
And Microsoft basically in my conversation with them said, in not so many words, that they can't really get around that fact.

734
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:14,000
They can't get around the fact that the Linux source code is just available for you to grab and start building against anytime you want.

735
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:21,000
And so what's happening is companies are getting, you know, half a mile down the road with these projects and then looking around.

736
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
Well, how are we actually going to make this sustainable?

737
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,000
How are we going to update it?

738
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
How are we going to get telemetry back on crashes and things like that?

739
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
And they don't have an answer.

740
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:33,000
But they're not going with anything that Azure or Microsoft can do because it's not built on Windows.

741
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:37,000
And they've been watching this and they said they were working on this thing for four years,

742
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:43,000
adding in different components the entire time, planning to build it off of Linux because of this problem.

743
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:46,000
That was something I hadn't even considered, you know, the lazy developer factor.

744
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
They just want to grab the code and start working.

745
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:51,000
Right. They don't want to worry about talking to the players.

746
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:54,000
What did you think, though, when you saw Microsoft shipping a Linux OS?

747
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:59,000
No, you really were not surprised at all. I mean, that's a pretty big deal.

748
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,000
Come on.

749
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:06,000
I have to say I wasn't that surprised only because I've also had some dealings in a much less public way with them.

750
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,000
And all roads lead to Azure Billings.

751
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,000
Yes.

752
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,000
Right.

753
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,000
It does.

754
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,000
I honestly.

755
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,000
Yep.

756
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
And this ties into my tweets with Paul Therot.

757
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:21,000
I think the fellows at Microsoft are fine people.

758
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:27,000
But it's clear to me that Linux, Windows, Mac, God forbid, BSD.

759
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,000
It's fine.

760
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,000
Business.

761
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,000
Right.

762
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:33,000
As long as you're using something from Azure.

763
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,000
Yeah.

764
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,000
Which this will.

765
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,000
Yeah.

766
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,000
Oh, absolutely.

767
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,000
In fact, that's the best part.

768
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,000
In fact, you have to.

769
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,000
Yeah.

770
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,000
It really is the best.

771
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,000
It's the whole security service.

772
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,000
Yeah.

773
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:47,000
So it's got this whole telemetry monitoring and secure update channel that.

774
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:56,000
So when you read the press releases, you'll see that Microsoft has said that it's a Linux core with the security lessons that they've learned with Windows built in.

775
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
So I had to know what those were.

776
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,000
And I said, what are those?

777
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,000
What are those lessons?

778
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,000
And it sounds like it's a few things.

779
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:09,000
But the things that mattered the most to me were the way they slip stream updates to Windows and the way that they do crash collections like the Dr.

780
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:13,000
Watson of today where it collects crashes and submits it back.

781
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:20,000
Those are very, very underutilized, underserved aspects of the IoT market right now.

782
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:33,000
Well, and you know, for me, this is really interesting because Microsoft, which they now call Azure IoT and Microsoft used to be called Windows Embedded, is actually a pretty powerful development platform.

783
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:47,000
And I can see a world where it makes economic sense because there won't be that Windows tax, right, for folks to develop their next great IoT project, their next great sensor using Azure spheres.

784
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:50,000
And they just get all this telemetry and crash reporting for free.

785
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:54,000
And the security guarantee that is, you know, that goes along with Microsoft.

786
00:39:54,000 --> 00:40:03,000
I know for our audience, that might not mean a lot, but in the enterprise, the Microsoft stamp of approval still does carry quite a lot of weight, as does the Linux talks.

787
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:08,000
So the marriage of the two is I know it's so clever on their part.

788
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,000
It's really cunning.

789
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:22,000
And they can build on what's what Microsoft is super well known for, like Azure services, metric collection, shipping updates, working with companies at a business to business level.

790
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:31,000
They can think it leverages all of that stuff that they have a good reputation for and completely leverages all the stuff Linux has a good reputation for.

791
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:38,000
And and totally like if this was based around Windows IoT or whatever they would call it, it would be a dud.

792
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:42,000
It would be a dud. But now it is based around Linux.

793
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:47,000
We're talking about this weeks later. It's still something people are chewing on, still actively commenting on.

794
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:51,000
And it is clearly because of the marriage of these two best of things.

795
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:58,000
And in a way, after talking to them, I'm like, yeah, I think only really Microsoft is going to solve this because Microsoft can sit back and say, we don't care.

796
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:03,000
We can be an implementation detail. We're part of your product. We don't have to be the product.

797
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:07,000
Our label doesn't. But let me let me let me slow you down just a little.

798
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:18,000
So the beauty, the value of Windows IoT or Windows embedded, which I know are technically two different offerings, but Windows IoT is basically replaced.

799
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:28,000
Right. Yeah. Windows embedded is that you can develop in Visual Studio using Microsoft tools, which comes in a bunch of pre-built libraries that really help you.

800
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:40,000
If you're using supported hardware, I will bet you I will bet you a beer that that same framework and compatibility will work on this Azure on this Azure spheres platform.

801
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:45,000
Hmm. Yeah. Yeah. That would make sense. Why not, too? Right.

802
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:51,000
Why not? That's that that is actually their advantage. Right. That's why they for better or for worse.

803
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:59,000
I mean, this is my opinion. I know people are going to email. They right now have the best development environment and the best.

804
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:05,000
Frankly, development platform for these embedded type, I hate the term IoT because it's such a nice word.

805
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:13,000
I know I prefer it really is just embedded development. But for these type of IoT devices.

806
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:18,000
And you get the Microsoft stamp again for your for your customers.

807
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:23,000
Yeah, you know, and you're going to you can you can say, yeah, well, we built it on top of that platform there for Microsoft.

808
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:27,000
So, you know, it could even be it could even be I got.

809
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:36,000
Actually, the more I think about it, it could even be a selling point if I knew that some smart platform device that I got was being supported via Azure sphere.

810
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:43,000
I actually would feel better about that because then I know they've got a 10 year update channel supported and maintained by Microsoft,

811
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:50,000
which is the number one thing I hate about IoT devices right now is that they're abandonware, essentially.

812
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:53,000
And then they just become little security vulnerabilities that are just waiting to be exploited.

813
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:57,000
Yeah. The commercial space is awful.

814
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:05,000
Now, this this probably, if you think about it, is just the beginning, really, of this kind of thing.

815
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:09,000
I bet you there are more shoes to drop. Look, look at the full context of it.

816
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:15,000
You have.NET Core that comes out. You have Visual Studio Code that comes out.

817
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:20,000
You have PowerShell Core that comes out. You've got Windows up on GitHub.

818
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:23,000
There is this and then now we have this Azure Sphere OS.

819
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:27,000
There is this building and building and building of momentum.

820
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:39,000
And in each individual case, what I think is important for us to remember here is that they represent about three or four years of work in each case behind the scenes.

821
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:48,000
Like to them, to the folks at Microsoft, they were surprised that anybody gave a shit that Linux was baked into this thing.

822
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:53,000
They legitimately were taken by surprise.

823
00:43:53,000 --> 00:44:01,000
They didn't think anybody was going to think that was a big deal because it's the Azure team and the Azure team has a lot of Linux running on Azure.

824
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:06,000
They're working with Linux every single day. They've already got a switch OS that's based on Linux in the Azure services.

825
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:16,000
So to them, to the guys I was talking to in the Azure team, they already live, eat and breathe Linux every single day.

826
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:19,000
And they didn't understand why this was a surprise to anybody on the outside.

827
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:25,000
I mean, I think they do, but at the time they were still like, when I talked to him his day of announcement, they were still very surprised that anybody cared.

828
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:29,000
And we're like, well, we want you to understand the Linux part is just part of a three part strategy here.

829
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:32,000
I'm like, yeah, I understand. You're also shipping Linux.

830
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:37,000
And to them, it's like, well, of course we are. That's what we've been working with now for years.

831
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:41,000
My point here is I think there's many more things are going to drop from Microsoft in this regard.

832
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:44,000
I don't think I don't think we're done.

833
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
No, I don't think we're done by a long shot.

834
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:49,000
Oh, boy. Well, OK, good. Well, there you go.

835
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:53,000
We have a link if you want to know more about Azure Sphere OS in the show notes.

836
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:56,000
Coder dot show slash three zero seven.

837
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:03,000
It really is just a weird, strange, long evolution of a lot of this stuff that we've been covering for quite a while.

838
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:07,000
I don't know. I don't know what else to make of it. I think that's probably we can probably leave it there, I suppose.

839
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
You know, I don't think there's probably much more to really.

840
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:12,000
Yeah, I don't think there's much more. I mean, these aren't shipping yet, so we'll have to see.

841
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:17,000
Yeah, there's going to be dev kits that hook up over USB and that will be super cool.

842
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:21,000
Yeah, that will be. I wonder. I wonder how I wonder what it'll take to get your hands on one.

843
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:24,000
If it wasn't that much, would you try one? Would you mess around with it?

844
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:28,000
If you just buy one. Yeah, I would. Yeah, I don't think you're going to be able to just buy one initially, though.

845
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:32,000
I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.

846
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:35,000
It sounds like they were pretty hot to try. I don't know. I don't know.

847
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:39,000
We'll see. I mean, that would be something I would definitely want to do.

848
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:45,000
Now, if we were going to do anything else in this episode, it would definitely be mentioning the subreddit.

849
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:48,000
We haven't really given it much love recently. CoderRadio.reddit.com.

850
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:53,000
I check it before we start every single podcast of the CoderRadio program to see if anybody has any feedback.

851
00:45:53,000 --> 00:46:00,000
CoderRadio.show is also like a great resource for links or subscribing or anything like that.

852
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:04,000
Coder.show. I should I should just really get both because I always say CoderRadio.show.

853
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:10,000
So I really should just I should just get both and forward them to the same place because I always mess that up.

854
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:14,000
And if you haven't checked it out in a little while, go subscribe.

855
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:21,000

858
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:36,000
If you go over to Coder.show.com. Mr. Dominic, before we wrap up, is there any other topics or things we want to send to people?

859
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
You know, things to mention, those kinds of things.

860
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:45,000
No, follow me at at Dumanuco on Twitter and be sure to ask Chris about his home pod.

861
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:50,000
Sounds great. Sounds great. Best podcast playback speaker ever.

862
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:55,000
That's my review, as long as you like it in mono. Let's see. Yeah, I think that'd be about it.

863
00:46:55,000 --> 00:47:02,000
That and join the Airplay Revolution. Bluetooth must die, my friends. Down with the Bluetooth!

864
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:05,000
