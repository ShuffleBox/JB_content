This is Koda Radio, episode 438 for November 1st, 2021.

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Hello friend and welcome in to Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show,

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
taking a pragmatic look at the art and the business of software development

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
and the world of technology.

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000

00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
My name is Chris and joining us every single week relishing in the Jar Jar memes

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
is our host, Mr. Dominic.

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Hello, Mike.

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
What's up, Mr. Fisher?

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I can't believe that the internet is still making Jar Jar Binks a valid meme.

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:59,000
It's like somehow you picked a winner a long time ago and it drives me crazy.

15
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Well, you know, I figured out that all the hate for Jar Jar, it wasn't hate.

16
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
It was really love.

17
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Yeah, the Jar Jar meta meme that was going around this last week

18
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
after the Facebook event was pretty choice, I got to say.

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
A lot of people sent it to me.

20
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Like surprising amounts of people sent it to me.

21
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I'm like, yes, I get it.

22
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Why am I not surprised?

23
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Boy, what a weekend.

24
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Do you and the kid do the trick or treating thing down there in the Florida?

25
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
We sure did.

26
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I was hanging out with Miles Morales.

27
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
It was a good time.

28
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I had the weirdest experience.

29
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I'll try to just really quickly recap it.

30
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
But because what it really comes down to is how corporations are twisting

31
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
themselves in knots to cover their ass, but also still try to like do things

32
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
to incentivize customers to show up to their events.

33
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
So every year we have this family tradition where we pack up the RV

34
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
and we go to this campground that has this big Halloween event.

35
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
And they have site decoration competitions and pumpkin carving competitions

36
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
and costume competitions.

37
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
And they have this big trick or treating event.

38
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
And everybody builds, you know, like into this whole event.

39
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Like it's everybody's participating.

40
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
It's a nice community experience.

41
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
But it involves people really being close to each other.

42
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
So this year the company decided we're not doing anything.

43
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
It's too risky because of the Rona.

44
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,000
The problem is the campground is co-owned by another company, KOA.

45
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
And the KOA folks say, you know, we want to do an event.

46
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
So we're doing an event.

47
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
And so there was this really weird kind of we're going to do stuff,

48
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
but we're not going to tell you the details.

49
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
That way you can't hold us accountable if anybody gets sick.

50
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
And so nobody knew what was going on.

51
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
It was all a bunch of indecision and like no information, which of course

52
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
is the worst thing possible during a pandemic.

53
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
And so that way you could never point to anything that was written that said,

54
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
they said trick or treating would be at this time.

55
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
They said site competitions would be at this time.

56
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
They still wanted us all to do it.

57
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
And they invited people there.

58
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
They held the judging for the costumes.

59
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
They did the judging for the sites.

60
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
But they just never made it official.

61
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
So that way they couldn't get in trouble if anybody got sick.

62
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
And it just seems like such a backwards way to go about it.

63
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
It's clearly a cover your ass move and not about protecting people at all.

64
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Classic big business.

65
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
But I'm grateful that it happened, you know, because those yearly traditions

66
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
are important and and it's outdoors.

67
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
So I feel pretty good about it.

68
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
And it was a lot of fun.

69
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
It did end up working out pretty good.

70
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
So we got some feedback this week.

71
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I was negligent last week when I was out in the woods.

72
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
But now I'm back in the studio.

73
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I had time this morning to go through the inbox and I picked out a few that I

74
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
thought we could be helpful with.

75
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:43,000
So Nick, who is a longtime Linux user, has decided to order an M1 MacBook Pro.

76
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,000
And he's a little concerned about this transition.

77
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
And he wants a couple of tips from us.

78
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Number one, he'd like to know about any information you have about what he needs

79
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
to run in Rosetta for development tools.

80
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
And if there's any tips, tricks or applications we might recommend for him

81
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
getting set up to develop on the M1 hardware.

82
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
And he says, thanks for the shows.

83
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
So I'm curious if you just have any quick things to pass along to him.

84
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I didn't think we need to spend a lot of time on this, but I do have a couple of

85
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
handy resources.

86
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Yeah, I think we got an email like this last week.

87
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I mean, I just run Terminal in Rosetta all the time.

88
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:19,000
That eliminates most of my, you know, like dependency issues or whatever.

89
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Honestly, that's kind of the biggest thing.

90
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I mean, it's not M1 related.

91
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
But there are certainly apps that are useful if you're on Mac.

92
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Kaleidoscope is a good diffing tool.

93
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,000
VS Code is not really a Mac app, but, you know, it's my editor of choice.

94
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Beyond that, that's kind of it.

95
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I mean, I basically work in Terminal VS Code, and if I really have a gnarly

96
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,000
merge, although VS Codes get conflict tools are really good too, so.

97
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Nick didn't say what desktop environment he's switching from.

98
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Yes.

99
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,000
So I don't know exactly what he expects in terms of window management.

100
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I'll have some notes on this in a bit.

101
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
It's a little bit better in Monoray, but it's still pretty weak compared to

102
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
like something like Plasma or even GNOME Shell.

103
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,000
So back in March of 2020, I did a Chris Lastcast, which is just a thing I was

104
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
doing for a bit, and I had tried like a month on the Mac or something like that.

105
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,000
And I went through and what I did, and I think, Nick, I'm still suggesting all

106
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
the tools that I have linked there, and I'll link to you that stuff in the show

107
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
notes.

108
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I say set aside 80 bucks, $80 that you're going to spend on independent

109
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:30,000
developer software and buy yourself a few nice apps that improve the Mac OS

110
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
experience and make it less frustrating.

111
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
And in my opinion, make it more of a workstation OS.

112
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Number one with a bullet for me that I absolutely miss every day on every other

113
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,000
desktop environment and every other Linux Linux desktop environment are on

114
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Windows is an app called Bumper B-U-M-P-R.

115
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:56,000
This little beauty, what it does is you set this as your default browser.

116
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
And then when you click a link in any app, any app anywhere on your desktop,

117
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:05,000
immediately a nice little menu that's very easy to click on that comes up

118
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
right where your mouse is at.

119
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
It has a icon list of all of your browsers.

120
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Now on a Mac, I'll have Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari.

121
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I may even have Safari testing version and Edge testing version, and I am very

122
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:25,000
particular about what browsers I use for what apps and what sites.

123
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
And this little bumper app, what it does is you click that link.

124
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
It brings up the icons of your browsers.

125
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
You choose the browser and it sends the link to that browser.

126
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:37,000
My God, this is one of the best applications I have ever used on a computer.

127
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
God bless it.

128
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Go get Bumper.

129
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Also, I have links to things in there like Bartender, which will take some of

130
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
the unnecessary icons out of the menu.

131
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
And you got to get I stat menus if you've ever put any of like the system

132
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
monitoring tools and like your plasma tray or your genome shell.

133
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
You got to go get I stat menus.

134
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
It's a killer.

135
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
There's just a whole link I'll have.

136
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I'll put a link to the Chris Lastcast where I covered that stuff.

137
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
You don't necessarily need to listen.

138
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I linked everything to show notes, but you can listen where I go into more details.

139
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
And then just a quick note before we move on from this.

140
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:11,000
So I got the M1 Mac Mini in-house that I've bought to do Asahi Linux testing on.

141
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:16,000
And until Asahi Linux is ready to go, I decided to give Mac OS on there a spin

142
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
because I have not really had much hands on with the M1 systems.

143
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
And yeah, it's fast, of course.

144
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
It doesn't get loud at all.

145
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
It's everything Micah said.

146
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I realized it's like this.

147
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
It's like the weather.

148
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I can explain to you what it was like this morning when I got up and it was 28

149
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
degrees outside Fahrenheit.

150
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
And you can understand the water freezes at that temperature and there could be

151
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,000
frost and that maybe you could see my breath and you can you can visualize that.

152
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Right.

153
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,000
But there is a huge difference between visualizing what 28 degrees Fahrenheit

154
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
feels like and what it's like to stand out there.

155
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,000
It's like you can you can conceptually understand something and then you can

156
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
experience something.

157
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
That's what the M1 performance is like.

158
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,000
You can understand what it's like to have something fast, but then you experience

159
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,000
a different architecture and you see things that once you experience it, you

160
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
really truly understand it.

161
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:13,000
And I had that experience with Linux desktop virtualization on the M1 Mini

162
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
using parallels.

163
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,000
It uses vert IO for the graphics, so it's essentially doing graphics

164
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:24,000
pass through like you might do if you had a dedicated graphics card.

165
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Assigned to a VM.

166
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Well, parallels does that little trick to get the graphics to the display, and

167
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:35,000
then it uses a rendering interface and parallels that talks metal.

168
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:41,000
And what you get is essentially a 3D accelerated desktop Linux experience.

169
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:46,000
And it is one of the absolute best.

170
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
No, not one of not one of.

171
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:54,000
It's the best desktop virtualized Linux experience I've ever had.

172
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,000
And my son sat down when I had a full screen up on the M1 Mac Mini and just

173
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,000
started setting up Minecraft and just going about his business and he had no

174
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
idea he was in a virtual machine at all.

175
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
And I have I've even gone just to like see how far I could take it.

176
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I wouldn't got in a genome extension so I could have wobbly windows and it's

177
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
using Wayland.

178
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:17,000
It's all happening on Wayland in Fedora 35 and it's it's an incredible desktop

179
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
virtualized experience.

180
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I've never experienced this with desktop Linux and I can't imagine what it's

181
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
going to be like on the M1 Pro or M1 Max.

182
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
So Nick, my advice to you is get brew.

183
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Go get those apps we suggested.

184
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Follow Mike's tips and then go get parallel 17 and put Linux in there.

185
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
So you've got that too.

186
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
It's a killer setup.

187
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Have you tried virtualizing desktop Linux on any of your M1 gear?

188
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I have not.

189
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
No.

190
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Oh, you should give it a go.

191
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
It's impressive.

192
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I think you get a genuine experience of what it's like to run desktop Linux on

193
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
metal.

194
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
You know, you get ironically metal.

195
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Get it?

196
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
It's really good.

197
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Moving on, Corey is a long timer and he has a question for us.

198
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
This this is big.

199
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
All right.

200
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
So he's he looks he's looking for some advice.

201
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
He's been listening to the show forever.

202
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,000
He's been doing 100 percent Salesforce development for the last five years.

203
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:14,000
He was a dot net developer for that before that for about five years.

204
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
And he's also followed the news very closely.

205
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
So he's aware of all the different frameworks, libraries, design trends,

206
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
et cetera.

207
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
He doesn't necessarily understand them, but he's fully aware of them.

208
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:27,000
But he wants to kind of move on and he's got a project idea.

209
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
He says I have an idea for a small website for collectors of a certain brand

210
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
of backpacks.

211
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,000
These backpacks are released all the time and there are collector groups and

212
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
tons of sellers.

213
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:41,000
The one thing I have not seen is a single website where you can look up the

214
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
previous released bags.

215
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I was thinking about building this myself with future enhancements being links

216
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,000
to new bags that you can currently buy with affiliate links if possible.

217
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Among other future enhancements would be to allow people to post classifieds for

218
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
the bags that they have so they can buy and sell bags from other people.

219
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,000
So with these enhancements in mind, I was thinking just something like a basic

220
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
wiki would not be appropriate.

221
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I'm also unsure of maybe like the legal requirements of something like this

222
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
would take.

223
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
I've seen other websites like this for Pokemon cards.

224
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,000
And so it seems like if you follow the right legal process and disclaimers on

225
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:18,000
the site and whatnot, I'm not too super concerned and I'd be willing to set up

226
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
an LLC.

227
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I imagine I'd probably need a lawyer.

228
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:26,000
But starting from scratch right now on a project like this is an overwhelming

229
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
experience.

230
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,000
There's probably 30,000 node frameworks and so much more.

231
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,000
There's tons of ways to deploy apps, serverless, AWS, Linode, Azure, Heroku,

232
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
et cetera.

233
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Picking a backend, a front end, a database, an auth provider, a hosting

234
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
style.

235
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
It's just too much.

236
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I'd love to build something modern that will both teach me something new and

237
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,000
relevant in the marketplace, as well as be something that I could deploy myself.

238
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Sorry for the long email.

239
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I guess I'm looking for just some advice on what to do.

240
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I have a lot of anxiety and all the choices.

241
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Any feedback would be appreciated.

242
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Thanks for all the content, Corey.

243
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
So he really doesn't even know where to start with this.

244
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
And I'm wondering, how do you figure that out?

245
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Because it seems like a lot of this other stuff, serverless, AWS, Linode, you

246
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,000
start to answer that once you figure out maybe how you're going to build the

247
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
site.

248
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Yeah, this is kind of tough because there's almost not enough information

249
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
provided.

250
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Even though it's a huge email?

251
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Yeah.

252
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Yeah.

253
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
It's a tough one.

254
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Yeah, for sure.

255
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I mean, there's two general approaches you can take, right?

256
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,000
You can start with some sort of platform, preferably open source, like a Wiki.

257
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
He mentioned Wikis.

258
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Or you can just start rolling your own minimum viable use case and then Voltron

259
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
it up as you go.

260
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
True.

261
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I'd probably start with the Wiki, I guess.

262
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
I say that with hesitation because I'm not sure it's true.

263
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Yeah, it does feel like what he does need is some kind of MVP that would attract

264
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
attention.

265
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
And then people who know this stuff might start working with him.

266
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
But that's a long shot, too.

267
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Yeah.

268
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:04,000
It seems like a possibility is if you just got started on something, then you

269
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
pretty quickly start identifying what works and doesn't work.

270
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Yeah, I think you almost need like a punch list of like, these are the five

271
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
features I must have.

272
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Yeah.

273
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Ignoring the possible tech stacks you could use or projects you could use and

274
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
then look at projects.

275
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
OK, what does these five things?

276
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,000
And if the answer is none, then you go ahead and you start rolling around.

277
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,000
I wonder maybe is the better approach to build the community first, like set up

278
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:34,000
a discourse forum maybe or a discord server and start building a community and

279
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
getting people to collaborate and give them feedback and ideas.

280
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
That's actually not bad because some of the community may have already tackled

281
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
the spare that know what to do.

282
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Yeah, I may be crashed and burned or have opinions.

283
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
So he may have to build.

284
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,000
I mean, a discord would be really straightforward, obviously.

285
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Also a discourse forum.

286
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:56,000
You could pop on Linode, get our $100 credit and deploy discourse with like a

287
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
single click and be probably ready to go in 15 minutes.

288
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Get your domain, set it up, start seeing if you can get people to chat with you

289
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:09,000
about it, talk to you about it, maybe build out a few default forums with the

290
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:13,000
categories you think people will be interested to chat about and see if it

291
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
goes from there.

292
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
I know it's kind of a slow approach, though, Corey.

293
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
All right.

294
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
I got a great one from Remy.

295
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,000
I thought this was so, so great because I know people, you know, they've been

296
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,000
hearing about the MacBooks and everybody's got notch envy.

297
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
So Remy wrote in for Linux users that are feeling left out of the fun.

298
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
He says you can have the best of both worlds.

299
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Gnome users can go grab this extension.

300
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Oh, Jesus.

301
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Are you looking at it?

302
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
How great is this?

303
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
I saw this the other week.

304
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Oh, my God.

305
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Okay.

306
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:47,000
So it adds a totally useless notch to your Gnome shell.

307
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:51,000
First of all, Chris opened the store.

308
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:56,000
The few Gnome extensions that I use when I run Linux cause me enough heartache.

309
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Why would I ever put first of all, nobody should want the notch.

310
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Second of all, why would you install a Gnome extension for anything other than

311
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:07,000
like your fancy and you want changing desktop backgrounds?

312
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
I don't know.

313
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
I do like that the FAQ has the first question.

314
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:15,000
WTF, why would you create this ugly extension?

315
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:19,000
And his answer is, please ask Apple why they create such an ugly notch on their laptop.

316
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Well, you know, they just did a patch, right?

317
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Where you can totally basically create fake bezels now.

318
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Seriously, there's a mode in my if you just I believe you may have installed

319
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Monterey or your machine has Monterey.

320
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Yeah, there is.

321
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
I do have some Monterey.

322
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
There are some setting in there too.

323
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
You can regain the glory that is top bezels.

324
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Hey, you know what?

325
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
I might try it.

326
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
I just think this is hilarious.

327
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,000
The thing that's creepy, though, is the notch.

328
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,000
It has a very hit slight hit.

329
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,000
You can see the camera lens and the green power light for the camera.

330
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
And it's always on.

331
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
I don't like that one bit.

332
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
I put a link in the show notes.

333
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
You guys got to go see this.

334
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
It's so funny.

335
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Are you sure that's not like screen bleeding, making it look like the lights on?

336
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
You know what I mean, like reflecting?

337
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
No, I don't think so.

338
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,000
I think the guy added just a very slight, subtle camera behind the glass kind of look.

339
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
I think it's brilliant.

340
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
So thanks, Remy.

341
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Dear Lord.

342
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
I know.

343
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
It's so good.

344
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Oh, this is the genome extension.

345
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Not your.

346
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
OK, not the actual.

347
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Oh, yeah.

348
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Oh, yeah.

349
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
OK, OK, OK.

350
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Linode.com slash coder.

351
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Go there to get one hundred dollars in 60 day credit on a new account and you go there to support this here show.

352
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Linode's where I host everything.

353
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,000
If it runs on Linux, it runs on Linode.

354
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:43,000
But with their powerful infrastructure, they started in 2003 as one of the very first companies in cloud computing.

355
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Now, 18 years later, they're the largest independent open cloud provider in the world.

356
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:54,000
And they have 11 global data centers, certainly nearly a million customers around the globe.

357
00:16:54,000 --> 00:17:00,000
And they stayed focused on making cloud computing accessible, affordable and really quite approachable.

358
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
They have a best in class experience over there.

359
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:09,000
And, you know, I think it's easy to rattle off a couple of things about Linode that would be really appealing to you.

360
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Performance is obviously going to be top on that list.

361
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Value, 30 to 50 percent cheaper than the hyperscalers out there that want to lock you in.

362
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Their customer support is simply just the best in the business.

363
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:30,000
The flexibility that the platform gives you and how it's grown with our usage over time, like we started as very kind of basic.

364
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,000
We want our VPS type users.

365
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:42,000
And then kind of learned how we can build infrastructure now in a way that's really kind of cloud first and super performant for our users.

366
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:49,000
And doesn't require just this unbelievable upfront investment by JB that, quite frankly, I could never really afford.

367
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:58,000
And I still get to have things like high availability in the performance and all of the stuff that I would get if I had just built out this incredible massive infrastructure.

368
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,000
But when I look at the way Linode set up, there's really nothing I would do differently.

369
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:05,000
They've really nailed it. I really, really like the way they deploy systems.

370
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:09,000
I think it's very solid. I like the way their backup mechanisms work.

371
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:15,000
And I really appreciate that their dashboard is simple enough that anyone on the team here at JB can use it.

372
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
And they all have different skill levels.

373
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
And it still works for all of them.

374
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:26,000
And then when you get in there and dig around, you see things like DDoS protection and VLAN support and their powerful DNS manager.

375
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,000
And that's stuff that I started to use more and more over time.

376
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
But that's not really how I started using Linode.

377
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
And I kind of think this could be a similar journey for yourself.

378
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,000
I go over there, take advantage of that hundred dollars.

379
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:48,000
That's a statement of confidence saying from Linode that they're going to give you a real amount of money to actually truly try the service and form a real opinion.

380
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Right. So go over there and just try this stuff.

381
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,000
And also consider maybe this could be part of a multi-cloud strategy.

382
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,000
That's another area where Linode can be really powerful.

383
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
You know, that's something that 66 percent of companies are looking at right now.

384
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,000
And Gardner did a bit of research around this.

385
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:07,000
People are becoming more and more aware of vendor lock-in.

386
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,000
I think a lot of our listeners, they already, you guys already get this.

387
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:19,000
We understand how this works a little bit more than, you know, maybe your average out of touch high level CTO exec type person that maybe doesn't follow these things.

388
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
No offense to you CTOs out there.

389
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,000
But Linode's already got their head in that space.

390
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
And so I think you'd be really impressed what they have to offer.

391
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,000
So go sign up today, try it out, support the show and get a hundred dollars.

392
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:36,000
So go to linode.com slash coder to create a new account, get the credit and actually try it out.

393
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,000
I mean, with a hundred dollars, you can form a real opinion.

394
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Linode dot com slash coder.

395
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,000
So this is a story that got sent into the show quite a bit, and I wanted to touch on it with you.

396
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:59,000
And the general bent of the emails was, are we as developers giving power to platforms like Google and Facebook by creating things that draw in users?

397
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:10,000
And this is coming after 10 days ago when a New York judge revealed that there were some new prosecution filings in a multistate antitrust lawsuit against Google.

398
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,000
And there's a ton of details that came out some of these filings.

399
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Now, these are positions of people that are going after Google, but some of it's really gnarly,

400
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:29,000
including positioning amps at AMP, Google AMP as a primary way to just create huge amounts of data for Google and squeezing out other services.

401
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:34,000
It looks like there was some real hanky panky going on.

402
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:41,000
They had Google had Project Bernanke, which took data from publishers for ads.

403
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:49,000
And they would use that data from people who were buying ads on their platform and embedding those ads, and they would boost their own services with that.

404
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Project Nara created a, quote, not owned but operated walled garden for users if they use any Google service.

405
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,000
There was in there a project called Project Jedi.

406
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:08,000
I do like that one, which was allegedly meant to freeze out independent ad exchanges by using insider knowledge.

407
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Then there was Project Jedi Blue, which is one where Google conspired with Facebook.

408
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Yeah. Yeah. To parcel out goodies between themselves and lock out privacy measures.

409
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
There is one hundred and seventy three page that's been unredacted.

410
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,000
It's a filing that I'll have linked in the show notes.

411
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:33,000
And the Twitter user that kind of went through this, that kind of kicked off this whole conversation, started the thread with.

412
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:38,000
I've read through all one hundred and seventy three pages of the unredacted Google antitrust filing.

413
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:43,000
And I have to say that either Google is screwed or society is screwed.

414
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:51,000
And we're going to find out which. So what it says in here really is that Google set up all of these things that we've all kind of speculated.

415
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:57,000
We've speculated that Google did apt to squeeze out ad blockers and collect data.

416
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:03,000
We speculated that maybe they were creating a walled garden with Chrome and Google log in.

417
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:11,000
We theorized that they were collaborating with Facebook to shut certain things down.

418
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
I like how careful you're being right now. This is nice.

419
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:19,000
But now here we are. And you see this. You see these court filings and these are just allegations.

420
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,000
But you see these court filings and it's essentially everything that we speculated here.

421
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Yeah, these things really did happen. It was as bad as we thought it was.

422
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,000
And maybe even worse. Like it's I think faster than Lime on Twitter had it.

423
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Like if Google doesn't pay for this. Society's screwed.

424
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Yeah, they're not going to. So I just think it's so funny.

425
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:45,000
I mean, I just think it's so funny that we're going after Facebook, which is insidious.

426
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Why is it a one or the other kind of situation? I mean, I know why, but it makes me sad.

427
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:55,000
I think it's because Google's played ball. Google's played ball with the federal government for a long time.

428
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Well, Facebook has too, though, actually. Yeah, they both do.

429
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:07,000
I go back to this. I suspect when it comes to federal investigations, Apple and Google are pretty screwed.

430
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:16,000
But when it comes to media really just digging in and doing actual investigative journalism, they've turned their attention to Facebook.

431
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:20,000
They set up a group of 30 journalists who are all sharing documents that have been leaked to go through it.

432
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:26,000
And each different publication is running with their different threads, just like the Snowden docs.

433
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:34,000
When Edward Snowden started releasing documents first through Glenn Greenwald and through The Guardian,

434
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:39,000
then they started divvying it out to the different news organizations and they created this group.

435
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:44,000
And they've done the same thing here. There is a there is a coalition, an actual formed coalition,

436
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:51,000
a actual documented formed coalition of journalists who are all focused on exposing Facebook.

437
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Now there's about 30 of them and they work for all these different outlets.

438
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:01,000
And we got email into the show saying, I'm totally wrong on this, but I don't I don't I don't think so.

439
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:09,000
And I don't care what people think. I am convinced they're going after Facebook right now because Facebook is competing for ad dollars.

440
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:15,000
They are a media platform that is directly competing for ad dollars. Google.

441
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:22,000
Absolutely competes for ad dollars, but it isn't a medium like television.

442
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:28,000
I think the TV people and the papers, they see Facebook as a competitor directly,

443
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:33,000
whereas they see Google as somebody that they can probably make a little money off of down the road.

444
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:38,000
They're going to make money off of Google News. They're you know, they can use AdSense like it's a platform they could take advantage of.

445
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Google's day is coming, but Facebook is more a direct competitor to what these news organizations do.

446
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:51,000
And so you're you're seeing what happens when journalists actually do their job.

447
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:56,000
And they actually investigate because all this has been out there going on for years at Google,

448
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:01,000
just like all the docs we've seen come out about Apple with their with their recent legal cases.

449
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:06,000
That's all been out there for journalists to go uncover. But they all have friendly journalists.

450
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:10,000
They all have, you know, lapdog journalists that, you know, they basically don't have to worry about it.

451
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Facebook doesn't have that privilege.

452
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:19,000
I actually agree with that. Right. Like there's a business interest to take out Facebook for many of the other competitors.

453
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:23,000
I would just like piggybacking on that. But then I have my own thing.

454
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:27,000
I would argue that Apple is like somewhat benevolent, but also definitely self-serving.

455
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Bitch slapping of the ad revenue on mobile. Oh, yeah. Is more self-serving than benevolent.

456
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Right. It's pretty clear what's up. But, you know, I like old movies and longtime listeners will know this.

457
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:43,000
I like like the old detective movies, the crime movies, the mafia movies, all that kind of thing.

458
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:47,000
And I forgot which one it was. Was it the Untouchables?

459
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:53,000
No, because it wasn't in color. But it was, you know, you know, like classic archetype where like one brother's a priest, one brother's a gangster.

460
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:57,000
It's like I'm in the 40s now. So kids sit down.

461
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:02,000
The mob guy has this line where he he tells his brother, well, how come you haven't been arrested?

462
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:08,000
But, you know, so-and-so, Lorenzo, whatever has. And he says, because you can do whatever you want.

463
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:15,000
But there are some things you can't do. And once you do them, you're you're done.

464
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:19,000
Forget about the cops. The regular people are going to turn against you.

465
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Facebook, I would argue, whether you like it or not, has done and whether you think it's rational or not,

466
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:31,000
has done lots of things that cannot be done, for instance, knowingly harming teenage girls.

467
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:38,000
It's a big problem. Yeah. I know you tend to have a more rational, probably more correct attitude on the whole protect the children thing.

468
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:43,000
I tend not to. I tend to be in the, you know, overreact camp.

469
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:49,000
I mean, I think that I think that alone should be just like crucify them, make them honestly burn Instagram to the ground.

470
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:56,000
If we came through all of this and we got some common sense regulation that said you got to be 18 years or older to use social media,

471
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:02,000
I don't think I'd have a problem with that. Well, the other thing is I have many cousins and many relatives who are not 13.

472
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:06,000
But, you know, all you have to do is say that you're 14 or 13 and you can use it.

473
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:11,000
So I have my son's Gmail inbox added to my, you know, my browser.

474
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:17,000
And he started getting tick tock emails, not that he checks his email, but he started getting tick tock emails, inviting him to tick tock.

475
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:21,000
I don't think kids should be on social media, period. I don't think they should be at all.

476
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:26,000
I think Facebook is boy, it's a real dichotomy. It's it's a lot of bad stuff.

477
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:31,000
And if they've done a lot of bad things. But, you know, in our parents age,

478
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:37,000
there were companies that were trying to sell cigarettes to to people that they knew were killing them.

479
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:40,000
And they were still trying to sell them like there have been a lot of bad companies.

480
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:45,000
They got slapped down. If you think of the tobacco companies, I don't know if it's a direct analogy, but I think that's what we're starting to see.

481
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:50,000
And I think just Facebook, because they're the biggest social media platform, they're the first in line.

482
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:59,000
But I think what we cannot under underappreciate is the media part in there in that social media.

483
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:02,000
They are a media platform and that's why they're first. Absolutely.

484
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:06,000
So what do you think about the general thrust of the emails that came in that said.

485
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:14,000
By releasing apps on the Play Store or by taking advantage of Facebook ads, you're enabling these horrible companies,

486
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:22,000
you're kind of you're giving them value. You are spending your time in your life adding value to Google or to Facebook.

487
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Well, since we're in old movies right now, I'm going to the untouchables from the 90s.

488
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Sean Connery's character. You can't be the only clean cop in the city.

489
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:42,000
If all your competitors are taking advantage of social media advertising or of, you know, using Google's whatever magical search tools that you need for your app, whatever Firebase.

490
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:47,000
I know lots of people who hate Google and use fire or use or used Firebase.

491
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:50,000
You can't put yourself out. You can't unilaterally disarm.

492
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
And I know there's open source alternatives, blah, blah, blah.

493
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:57,000
But you're not going to get, you know, Joe Blow, who you want to sell something to, to sign up for Mattermost.

494
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:02,000
It's just not happening. Well, and I wasn't going to go here, but this is actually where I've been personally struggling with.

495
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:10,000
This is Facebook and Google, obviously, make a lot of really important open source contributions.

496
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:17,000
My beloved ButterFest that I think is our only hope for a competitive workstation file system for Linux.

497
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
ButterFest, you're my only hope.

498
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
It's been made great again by Facebook.

499
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:32,000
You know, like it's directly because Facebook is using it in production on tens of thousands of servers and they've hired like one of the lead ButterFest developers full time to work on it.

500
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:37,000
And that has turned the file system around in the last five years.

501
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
And that's just one of many contributions.

502
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
Amazon does, too. It's tricky.

503
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:55,000
If you are a PHP advocate slash developer and you really care about that, like as part of your identity, PHP, you kind of should like Facebook, at least their engineering team, because they have done a lot to get to make PHP still relevant.

504
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:58,000
I just I'm just going to throw it out there, the hip hop VM, right?

505
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:05,000
I'm trying to figure out a way to be grateful and comfortable with the engineers that work there.

506
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:16,000
Well, disapproving of the outcome of the company, sort of like I have respect for the American people, but I'm very upset at the government and what its decisions it's made.

507
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:20,000
I don't fault all of the American people completely, but yet at the same time, they are the ones that voted.

508
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
So they there's a problem there.

509
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:29,000
But like if Facebook were to dissolve tomorrow, what you'd have is a bunch of really great engineers that would just sort of disperse into the marketplace.

510
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:38,000
I just want to say we're getting like dangerously close to like the Oppenheimer problem, right? The not the Nazi scientist problem, like great scientists, brilliant, awesome engineering.

511
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
Too bad he did horrible things with it.

512
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,000
But can we look and historically we have looked the other way, right?

513
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:46,000
We've been like the Oppenheimer problem. Another somebody to make that a title.

514
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,000
I'm trademarking that. Thank you.

515
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
Yeah, that's interesting.

516
00:30:51,000 --> 00:31:01,000
Yeah. And that's a real thing that I struggle with, because a lot of the software I use is enabled by these very companies that I think in some ways do harm society.

517
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:05,000
That is where I think about it, too, when these people are asking the questions via email.

518
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
Coder dot show slash contact.

519
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:13,000
I have that sort of same philosophy. It's sort of it's sort of like there's good things about publishing on YouTube like JB does.

520
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:16,000
Right. But there's also bad things about it.

521
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:22,000
And so I try to strike the right balance that I think is appropriate for the JB company, for my company.

522
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:28,000
They own the roads, you know, and when we built the information superhighway, we privatized the roads.

523
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,000
Standard rail, baby. Standard rail.

524
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:35,000
Hey, how about a little Ruby async check in? I smell a little async in the air.

525
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:41,000
Yeah. So I'll keep this relatively quick. I know Ruby is not our biggest, you know, demographically language here.

526
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:48,000
But yeah, Ruby is getting an async gem, which it's not just some, you know, random third party gem from the bayou here.

527
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:54,000
This is something that Matt, the creator of Ruby, actually invited to be part of the standard library.

528
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
Are you technically considered in the bayou?

529
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:00,000
No, I'm in the swamps. OK, swamps. OK, so bayou would be like Louisiana.

530
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:04,000
Yeah, OK. Although I do have gator meat in my freezer. So who the hell knows what I'm doing?

531
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:10,000
Have you had that before? Oh, yeah. I've had it very sparingly when I went to a special restaurant.

532
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:13,000
But did you like it? Well, the way it was prepared, it was delicious, actually.

533
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:17,000
Yeah, it's like a creamier chicken, usually, if it's done right. Wow.

534
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
It shouldn't it shouldn't be astringent or like stringy.

535
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:24,000
So now I just feel like I learned something new about you today.

536
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:29,000
I've been down here a long time now. I've gone native.

537
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:34,000
So anyway, asynchronous programming in Ruby. Right. So, yeah, this is interesting.

538
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:38,000
It takes a different approach from, let's say, Python async.

539
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:44,000
It uses the Ruby block pattern, which Ruby block is very similar to what you think a C block is.

540
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:48,000
You know, it indents pass in the code.

541
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,000
Huzzah. There's some magic going on behind the scene.

542
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:56,000
There are helper libraries you could add to it. You could add a wait or async await.

543
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:00,000
You can do a Redis. There's a Redis gem that you can tack on.

544
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:07,000
But really, the meat and potatoes here is the async Ruby gem, which depending on, I guess, negotiation.

545
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:14,000
Discussions, discussions, whatever between the standard library team and the folks who wrote this library may be part of the standard library,

546
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:18,000
meaning you won't even have to require it or import it or anything.

547
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:23,000
Other big thing going along with this async programming goodness is Ruby fibers.

548
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:28,000
Now, this is going to be a gross oversimplification because it's Ruby.

549
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,000
And I know a lot of you don't care.

550
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:36,000
This is a quote from the documentation of fibers, simply an independent execution context that can be paused and resume programmatically.

551
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Doesn't that sound a lot like maybe a thread?

552
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:44,000
And that's basically what they are. They are. And I know that's technically not correct.

553
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,000
They may run on your main thread. It figures it out by itself.

554
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:54,000
But the quick and dirty definition for like a working definition to talk at the pub is it is an abstraction on threads.

555
00:33:54,000 --> 00:34:00,000
The kind of the killer feature here is why you would use this set of threads is it has a transfer method,

556
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:05,000
which makes it easy to transfer data safely from one fiber to another.

557
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:11,000
Anybody who's done manual threading knows that passing data from one thread to another is where things can go wacky.

558
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:17,000
I think this is a great feat of engineering. We're going to Oppenheimer this and I think it shouldn't exist.

559
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:22,000
Really? Yeah. And I think it's one of those things that has been sort of neglected.

560
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:27,000
So I think it was introduced in Ruby 1.9, but they're like breathing new life.

561
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:31,000
And then now with async, too, I think there's some potential there.

562
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:39,000
I think the ball, I don't know if I'm making a tortured analogy here, but I think the snowball has just begun to roll again.

563
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:46,000
I'm sorry. Ruby needs to compete with, frankly, Python. I could see great uses for fibers.

564
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:51,000
I can also see a bunch of, let's say, less experienced developers.

565
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:56,000
We used to have a word for them. It began with an N, had two zeros in it, a B and a five or an S,

566
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,000
depending on your particular levels of 90s hatred.

567
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:03,000
And you're so elite. Exactly. One, three, three, seven forever.

568
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:07,000
I can see this blowing up many, many projects because people do stupid things with them.

569
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:12,000
Fair. And I suppose that is a risk for Ruby. But I like the Unix philosophy here.

570
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:17,000
It's like you give the user the power to hurt themselves, but at the same time, they can also build what they need.

571
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:20,000
It's like it's a double edged sword. You can't have one without the other.

572
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:24,000
It seems like a pretty legit thing, but it's just when you frame it in that context.

573
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:29,000
Yeah, I could see how it's a downside, but I just don't know if that's a big enough use case like the new user.

574
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:34,000
It needs to be considered, though, but I don't know if it should should it hinder a powerful feature.

575
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:42,000
Well, my concern is that some blogger with a gold MacBook is going to sit under a cherry blossom tree

576
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:46,000
and run a blog post about how everything you should do should be in a fiber.

577
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:53,000
Yeah. Which not only is that incorrect, but that will definitely bog down what is already a pretty slow programming language.

578
00:35:53,000 --> 00:36:03,000
And I know I know a lot of performance enhancements and I'm a Ruby fan, but I would be more excited about something like a new framework to make Ruby more relevant.

579
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:08,000
In spaces where, frankly, Python marketer wise is kicking its ass.

580
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:13,000
But that's just me. A ban. A legit async implementation.

581
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:17,000
Yeah. Oh, I like I like the async. I'm down with async. That's huge, right? That's big.

582
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:20,000
I like the async. I think that should go into standard lib. Yeah.

583
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:24,000
And the way they do it, I think is very smart, having it done in blocks.

584
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:31,000
The fiber thing, it's it's just easy enough that I think junior developers will overuse it.

585
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:39,000
And I know I just know there's a hipster with a knit hat ready to write a blog post that's going to torture me for the next five years.

586
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:45,000
You know, we were talking on the pre show because we stream the show live on Mondays and.

587
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:53,000
Roblox was down for three days, they went down on the 27th and I don't think they got back up until the 30th and.

588
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:59,000
It reminded me to recently remember when Facebook was down for like 24 hours or whatever it was.

589
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:06,000
You find out afterwards because I was reading the sort of the first pass at a postmortem that Roblox had.

590
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:12,000
You find out afterwards that like the tools they've built themselves broke because they depended on some fundamentals.

591
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:18,000
They have some assumptions like name services would always be available. DHCP might always be available.

592
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:28,000
And they ended up spending at least a day just fixing their tooling, just fixing the tools they built.

593
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:32,000
So that way they could redeploy their infrastructure and get things back online again.

594
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:43,000
And so, you know, I think your points well taken that if you give somebody a tool that can be used improperly and expect them to have enough experience to know better.

595
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:51,000
Well, even in some seriously high production, high volume, really lots of money on the line kind of instances.

596
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:57,000
People are building these things in a way where they're just devastated when there's some sort of fundamental assumption that works out to be incorrect.

597
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:05,000
And these kind of things are the kind of problem that can exist for like a couple of years until you hit some sort of critical phase or critical mass and then just blow up.

598
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:12,000
That's exactly what happened with Roblox. They said it was it wasn't necessarily actually even user scale.

599
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:19,000
Although I think they do have a pretty impressive amount of active users, but it was scaling out of servers.

600
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:27,000
And as they added more servers, some of the tooling they'd built themselves around communication started to fail.

601
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:36,000
And then it just sort of created this load effect from that, which then kind of created this DDoS effect, which then just sort of broke everything.

602
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:46,000
And, you know, you remember with the Facebook guys and gals, they couldn't even badge in their system was so broken, they they couldn't get the doors open.

603
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:55,000
It's always DNS, even when it's not. I still blame DNS. DNS and BGP. They're always going to get you.

604
00:38:55,000 --> 00:39:02,000
OK, so I think Mac OS has lapped, I have to say, Linux in a really embarrassing way.

605
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:12,000
And I think it's a fundamental workstation feature that makes these things stable machines for developers and for admins and content creators.

606
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:17,000
It's actually something that's file system related, and that's why it really gets me.

607
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:21,000
Because we've had great file systems on Linux for a while.

608
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:34,000
And Mac OS rode that HFS train for so long, way longer than they should have in a modern MVME powered Mac era.

609
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:42,000
And then like little file system ninjas in the middle of the night or sand as else.

610
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:48,000
When you updated Mac OS, they swapped you over to APFS, but they didn't do a lot with it.

611
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,000
They didn't do much. In fact, it was it was a boring implementation.

612
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:57,000
But you could see the features and capabilities of APFS and you could see where maybe Apple would go with it.

613
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:03,000
This is a couple of years ago, three years ago. But Linux didn't really do much.

614
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:11,000
We had one major leap forward. The Fedora distribution switched their default file system over to ButterFS.

615
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:20,000
And the reason why this matters is because this gives you, first of all, a file system that's built with SSD and MVME storage in mind.

616
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:30,000
It gives you the ability to copy files on write. It gives you the capability to check some files, encrypt files, compress files, create volumes.

617
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:34,000
It's a modern way where maybe you might not even directly interact with it.

618
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:43,000
But the operating system tooling can use these file system features to create a bulletproof workstation experience.

619
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:47,000
Back to Fedora, they've been experimenting with something called Silverblue.

620
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:53,000
Which is an attempt to create a really solid Linux workstation that has safe updates.

621
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:59,000
Applications are in a different space, kind of operates more like our cell phones do.

622
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:08,000
Well, in macOS Monterey, Apple has made a transition like this, even though Linux had years to figure this out.

623
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:16,000
It started in Catalina, Big Sur brought it forward, and Monterey has now finished the job.

624
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:22,000
And what it is, is they, while you're installing Monterey, re-slice up your hard drive like a maniac.

625
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:29,000
And they segregate the contents of the system files, which don't change, except during a macOS update.

626
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:34,000
And they separate that out from anything else on your system that does change.

627
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:41,000
Then they start running the system off of immutable snapshots.

628
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:50,000
So when the system boots, it's actually booting from a snapshot that the operating system doesn't actually have the capability to modify.

629
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
It's not even that it's read-only.

630
00:41:52,000 --> 00:42:00,000
It's that Apple did not build the ability for the operating system to make modifications to that system volume.

631
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
And it's powerful.

632
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:08,000
And what Apple does now, starting with Monterey, is when they download an OS update,

633
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:12,000
they unmount the data volume and they unmount the system volume,

634
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:17,000
so that way there's no way for the update to cause any problems at all.

635
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:23,000
They perform the update, they run a series of checksums, and then they switch the snapshots over.

636
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:28,000
So you have your running system snapshot, and now you have the new environment that's been updated.

637
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
And then they boot from that.

638
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:34,000
And if there's a problem, they can boot from the old snapshot environment.

639
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:38,000
And they've done all of this in the background while you're updating your Mac to Monterey,

640
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:42,000
thinking about, I don't know what, there's hardly any new features.

641
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:48,000
It's an impressive step towards creating a bulletproof Mac OS install.

642
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:52,000
And now it gives you, like the first way it's really noticeable by users,

643
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:55,000
is it has that Chrome Power Wash feature now,

644
00:42:55,000 --> 00:43:00,000
where you can go in there and you can delete the OS and reinstall the OS,

645
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:04,000
and all of your data remains, applications remain.

646
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:09,000
It's a really advanced workstation thing that I think Linux will get to,

647
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:13,000
but doesn't have yet unless you set it up yourself.

648
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:18,000
And it is something you could set up with ButterFS or ZFS or LVM and maybe XFS.

649
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
I don't know, you're crazy.

650
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
But it doesn't work this cleanly.

651
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:26,000
It wouldn't necessarily be integrated into the OS Update Manager like this is.

652
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:30,000
It wouldn't necessarily be integrated into the bootloader like this is.

653
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:36,000
And of course, this is cryptographically verified using Apple's suite of tools to do that.

654
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:40,000
It's a really impressive layout.

655
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:46,000
And you can visualize it with a link that I'll have in the show notes to see how Apple has done this.

656
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:51,000
And I'm a little envious as a Linux user because I feel like we have all the fundamentals to do this and more.

657
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:56,000
But there's just nobody that's really orchestrating that kind of thing.

658
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,000
Fedora may get there.

659
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
OpenSUSE may get there.

660
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:02,000
Canonical is working on it with Ubuntu and ZFS.

661
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:07,000
These distributions, it's possible to do snapshots when you install your packages and boot from different volumes.

662
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
They're all working on it.

663
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:12,000
But they're not all to the finish line yet.

664
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:15,000
In fact, none of them are really at the finish line by my definition.

665
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:20,000
And meanwhile, not only did Apple roll out a file system just flawlessly,

666
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:26,000
where in Linux it's still a fragmented mess of ButterFS and Extended4 and Extended3 and everything else.

667
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:31,000
But now over three different OS iterations, they've completely restructured the file system.

668
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:34,000
And they've done it in a way that's super transparent.

669
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:39,000
For example, the applications folder in Monterey is a lie.

670
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
It's a lie.

671
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:44,000
When you double click on the applications folder in Mac OS 12 Monterey,

672
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:51,000
it is a mount of two different folders, the one from the system partition that is unmodifiable.

673
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:55,000
And it overlays the one from your data partition.

674
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
And it shows it in there like it's all one.

675
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:03,000
And you never it never essentially as far as that layer of the operating system is concerned, it is one folder.

676
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:07,000
But under the hood, they have this new linking term they're using.

677
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:10,000
And I can't remember the term, but it's not like a symbolic link.

678
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:14,000
It's they have some other term ports in the article I've linked in the show notes.

679
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:18,000
And they're using that to fake out this application folder.

680
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:21,000
It creates the illusion of a single folder.

681
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:24,000
It's really clever.

682
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:30,000
And it means that like if you're the if you're the family tech support person or something like that,

683
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:34,000
you can go there and wipe somebody's computer, not worry about losing their apps and their data.

684
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:40,000
In truth, I haven't tried Monterey yet, but I am already running a PFS Apple file system.

685
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
It's fine. Works great.

686
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:49,000
I mean, really, you know, you don't even really notice as a as just using the system.

687
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:53,000
And perhaps that's maybe just a nod to their integration level, I suppose.

688
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:58,000
The fact that they can do these they can do these things and you wouldn't know unless you read about it.

689
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:02,000
There's a couple other things that I think make Monterey a pretty nice workstation.

690
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:06,000
And by the way, this isn't me saying one's better than anything else.

691
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:10,000
I just had a chance to give it a go and given you my report.

692
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:13,000
It's nice to see low power mode land in Mac OS.

693
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
It's about damn time.

694
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:20,000
It makes a big difference on M1 hardware, but it does make some difference on Intel hardware.

695
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:26,000
And what I don't know for sure yet, but what I'd love to see maybe somebody knows is.

696
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:30,000
Some sort of API that apps could check with with Mac OS and ask, are you in low power mode?

697
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
It's probably there some sort of framework or something.

698
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:37,000
So apps could know maybe they should shut up when they're on low power mode.

699
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:40,000
There's a little bit of more window management added.

700
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:43,000
I mentioned this, which is nice to see this in Monterey.

701
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:52,000
You can drag a window and say maybe you bring it from a really large monitor onto a small monitor or vice versa.

702
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:56,000
Monterey will now appropriately resize it so it fits on the screen automatically.

703
00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:02,000
But additionally, there's now some more clicking and holding options on the green little.

704
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:06,000
Maximize button, whatever they call it, the green stoplight.

705
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
And now you have additional options in there.

706
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:13,000
They started doing this before, but Monterey, you can now start managing split view from there.

707
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:14,000
You can take over full screen.

708
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
There's several options they've added.

709
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,000
It's still pitiful.

710
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:21,000
Still really requires an app like magnet to make it to make it work.

711
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
But in short, you know, I'll just sum it up.

712
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:29,000
I got the nice, the bad and the ugly for you in the nice to see.

713
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:35,000
It's nice to see that Apple is trying to add as many feature parity as they can with iOS as they add features to iOS.

714
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,000
So you got Airplay to Mac now.

715
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:40,000
They've added variable refresh rate display support.

716
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
Live text and photos is here.

717
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:45,000
Finder can finally resume file copies.

718
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:46,000
That's nice.

719
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:52,000
The if I don't know how many people out there use this, but if you're primarily a Linux user, this is a really handy tool and finder.

720
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:55,000
The go to folder command just looks better.

721
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:56,000
It's faster.

722
00:47:56,000 --> 00:48:00,000
And now they support auto completing of passing like you can in the terminal.

723
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:04,000
And that just brings up the gooey file manager to that spot on the file system.

724
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,000
All right. That's the nice stuff.

725
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
But here's the bad stuff.

726
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
Some just not done yet.

727
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
Universal Control's not there.

728
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,000
There's features. It just feels like it's not finished.

729
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,000
It's sort of surprising in that way.

730
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:21,000
It's probably one of the most low key upgrades I've ever done on a Mac.

731
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:26,000
I did an upgrade if they hadn't changed the background, which they change on you.

732
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:29,000
I probably wouldn't even been able to tell you if it upgraded or not.

733
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:33,000
They've ported Automator to work with the Automator workflow.

734
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:37,000
They've tried that, you know, to import them to shortcuts because shortcuts is new in here.

735
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,000
The shortcuts app is crazy bad.

736
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
I don't know what Apple's doing with that.

737
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:44,000
It looks like an electron app.

738
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:45,000
It's just it's horrible.

739
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
And here's the really bad stuff.

740
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
Intel Macs are getting the shaft big time.

741
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:54,000
I had an old old crusty MacBook that's now off the list.

742
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:58,000
And some of these features are Apple Silicon only now.

743
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
And it's kind of like, geez, really?

744
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:03,000
Is the first OS after you announced it? OK.

745
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:08,000
Also, notifications are still a damn disaster on Mac OS.

746
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:11,000
Focus mode support helps reduce the noise.

747
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:14,000
But my God, Apple, what are you doing with notifications?

748
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:17,000
Go look at how plasma handles notifications, Apple.

749
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:21,000
And then I don't know what the hell's going on here.

750
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:24,000
Maybe the original developer, God bless, maybe they died.

751
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:30,000
But terminal. It's the same from the early versions of Mac OS.

752
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
I can't believe how bad Apple's terminal is.

753
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:37,000
Microsoft has just schooled Apple on how to do a better terminal.

754
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:43,000
And every single Linux desktop environment has a better terminal than the terminal that ships with Mac OS.

755
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:49,000
And it's just like, dammit, Apple, that application terminal dot app, it sells Macs.

756
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:54,000
It sells Macs. And it's like one of the worst apps on the OS.

757
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:58,000
It's gotten some updates since the early versions of Mac OS.

758
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:04,000
I kid. It legitimately has gotten some improvements, but it's an immediate upgrade to install iTerm.

759
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:08,000
So I don't know why they don't give any effort at all to the terminal.

760
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:11,000
It seems like it'd be a pretty low key project.

761
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,000
They have a lot they could do.

762
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:18,000
So even just putting somebody on it for a release cycle would make a huge difference.

763
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:27,000
And then, of course, the other thing in the ugly section for my review is that some older Macs have been bricked after installing Monterey.

764
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:30,000
So if you got a really old Mac, it might be worth holding off for a bit.

765
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:34,000
But if you have a, you know, a new ish, you know, back to like.

766
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:38,000
Twenty seventeen forward. It's a pretty easy upgrade.

767
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:42,000
I installed it and everything's working fine. No, no compatibility issues.

768
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,000
It wasn't a big deal.

769
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:49,000
And, you know, I would do it alone for the finder improvements, to be honest with you, because there's several other things in there that are nice to have.

770
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:54,000
Just be warned that because it has airplay now, it takes over Port 5000 on your Mac.

771
00:50:54,000 --> 00:51:00,000
So if you've got stuff running on Port 5000, you can go into the system preferences and turn off airplay format.

772
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:04,000
Rap, really? Yeah. I do run stuff on 5000 all the time.

773
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:08,000
Yeah, it's a thing. You know, there's that kind of stuff that comes along when they add these new features.

774
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:11,000
I get the idea. I like the idea of having airplay on the Macs.

775
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:14,000
You can send stuff to it seems kind of weird that they haven't had that.

776
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:28,000
But I think that, you know, I've criticized Apple in years past for the early 2017 MacBooks that had the bad keyboard and just two ports and for not adding decent workstation features to Mac OS.

777
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:31,000
And I really think they need up their terminal game.

778
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:34,000
I think they could expose more of these file systems and finder.

779
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:38,000
You know, wouldn't it be great if you could just right click on a file and say restore previous version?

780
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:47,000
Why not? But I am also impressed with what you do get in the end is a pretty balanced system now that especially on M1 hardware.

781
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:50,000
Really gets the most out of the hardware.

782
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:57,000
For the most part, stays out of your way most the time and has a lot of really nice quality of life features.

783
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:05,000
And it's backed by a pretty sound file system architecture that's going to keep your data as safe as that hardware can possibly keep it safe.

784
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:10,000
You know, beyond hardware failure, the way they've architected that thing is really, really impressive.

785
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:17,000
So I think actually moderate overall because it's not abrasive to upgrade to is actually one of the better releases in a while.

786
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:21,000
And I look towards the Linux desktop.

787
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:26,000
I always after I do these kinds of things and think, OK, what of this what I pull forward to Linux.

788
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:30,000
And I think the file system architecture is definitely one of them.

789
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:36,000
I think this low power mode, which we're kind of getting that in GNOME 41 and GNOME 40.

790
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:43,000
But I think, you know, something more more system wide, those kinds of things would be really great to see come over to Linux desktop.

791
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:54,000
And I just think that overall, if you're getting yourself one of these new Macs and you're going to be running Mac OS on it, I think I think it's going to be moderate is going to be a good release.

792
00:52:54,000 --> 00:53:02,000
And I would imagine you throw on your favorite virtualization tool on there and you can run some some pretty nice VMs, just they have to be ARM based VMs is the only thing.

793
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:07,000
So that's kind of the thing about it. So you're going to try it or you're going to wait a while.

794
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:10,000
I'm probably going to wait a few weeks. I think it's probably smart.

795
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:16,000
I mean, there's no reason if there's nothing I wanted to give it a shot because I wanted to play around with the new file system stuff.

796
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:19,000
And I figured we'll give it a go.

797
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:26,000
I don't really have any like critical workloads on the Mac. So if something breaks, it doesn't really ruin my day.

798
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:31,000
But that said, I also upgrade with abandon them on the systems that are absolutely critical to my workflow.

799
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:36,000
I'm just that kind of person. Should probably wrap it up. But I want to say thanks to our members.

800
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:40,000
