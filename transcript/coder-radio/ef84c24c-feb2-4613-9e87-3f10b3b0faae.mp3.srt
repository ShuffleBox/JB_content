9
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:46,400
My name is Chris and joining me at an odd time on an odd day is our host, Mr. Dominic.

10
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:47,400
Hello Mike.

11
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:50,240
Hello and happy mystery day.

12
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:52,840
Yeah, it is a mystery day, isn't it?

13
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:55,440
Like why are we doing it on a different day?

14
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,160
What are we going to talk about today?

15
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:59,480
All secrets to be revealed in the show.

16
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:01,160
I am in a new spot.

17
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:04,560
This is my last time on the road that we'll do the show until I'm, you know, until the

18
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:05,560
next road trip.

19
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:06,560
Yep.

20
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,560
Yeah.

21
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:10,540
I'm sure that I'm sort of addicted to them, so I'm sure it'll happen again.

22
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:13,320
But man, 40 days on the road.

23
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:18,080
I am so looking forward to having my office, my desk, my studio.

24
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:22,600
Oh my God, I'm so looking forward to it, dude.

25
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:23,600
It's crazy.

26
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:28,360
But you know what else, as just a total aside and go figure is right now we're like at the

27
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:29,360
best spot.

28
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,480
We've been on the entire trip in Southern Oregon.

29
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:36,960
There's just this, there's a casino down here that Texas has this amazing RV resort that

30
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:41,840
is got glorious high speed internet and shade, and it's just now I don't want to go home.

31
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:45,240
I just want to stay here forever, you know?

32
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:50,120
But then I saw you online, saw what you were doing, messing around with Android emulators.

33
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,120
Like what are you doing over there?

34
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:53,160
Don't you know you're all in on the Apple ecosystem?

35
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,160
Yeah.

36
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:55,160
Well, you know what?

37
00:01:55,160 --> 00:02:02,280
I actually don't tell anybody, but I actually like all technology and I tend to take a pragmatic

38
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,280
view.

39
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,280
You mean like the whole world of technology?

40
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:07,360
Like a pragmatic view on the world of technology.

41
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,360
Yeah.

42
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:12,400
So I did pop open Android studio and I even tested out Maui.

43
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,400
Okay.

44
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,400
But be honest.

45
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,400
What was it a bit getting there?

46
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:18,160
I mean, I'm sure you got it working and you got to try Maui, right?

47
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,160
But come on.

48
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:20,160
It was a pain in the ass.

49
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:25,640
Maui was a pain in the ass because the tooling for Mac just isn't there.

50
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:26,640
Yeah.

51
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:31,000
And the tooling in my VM for Windows also apparently doesn't work right.

52
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,260
The Android AVD, the virtual device would not work.

53
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:36,760
So yeah, it was rough.

54
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:37,760
Sorry.

55
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:41,720
But I did see a successful tweet that you did manage to get it up and going.

56
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:43,840
I got it all up and running and it does look impressive.

57
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,840
It does look promising.

58
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:52,960
Now I have some, a little bit of a Microsoft, what do we call this?

59
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:55,400
Once bitten, twice shy kind of thing going on.

60
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,400
Baggage.

61
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,760
New listeners can listen back to the episode on Windows Phone 8 when I lost a ton of money

62
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:01,760
on that.

63
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,720
I think we all have a little Microsoft baggage.

64
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:04,720
I think we can all relate.

65
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,620
I mean, who doesn't, right?

66
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:10,440
I'm really hoping that this is different.

67
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:15,280
And having said that, I decided to do the project and something stable.

68
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,560
Well what does that mean?

69
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,400
It means not Maui.

70
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,600
It means it didn't make the cut, huh?

71
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:22,600
Let me give you a hint.

72
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:27,520
Give me a C and then if you were to add one to it, but if you were a programmer and you

73
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:34,080
didn't want to like type, you know, C plus C or like C plus one.

74
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,080
What might you do?

75
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:39,720
You might do like a C and a plus sign and then maybe another one.

76
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:42,280
You might, if you really wanted to get into it.

77
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:45,640
By the way, we haven't talked about this much on the show, but my old man level has gotten

78
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:48,880
to the point where I'm like, if I can't do it in Python, I do it in C plus plus and I'm

79
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,960
grumpy about it, but it's fine.

80
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:53,320
Our old man level was pretty high last episode.

81
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:58,480
We got, we got some fired up emails and I didn't see it coming.

82
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:59,960
We got our asses kicked.

83
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:00,960
Ooh.

84
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:01,960
Yeah.

85
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:02,960
Yeah, we really did.

86
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:03,960
We done been straightened out.

87
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:08,880
So we brought up this topic about Apple shutting down the Slack channel about fair pay.

88
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:14,840
And um, I think out of old habit, Mike and I went into like extreme stereotypical boss

89
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:15,840
mode.

90
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,280
Like, well normally we'll just go at it from like how people that run these corporations

91
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:19,280
look at stuff.

92
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:23,040
And we don't even disclose that like, Hey, we're about to do this thing because it's

93
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:26,840
to us, it's just, it is the nature of the beast and it's how they think.

94
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:32,200
But I think we managed to get enough people fired up that it's worth talking about it.

95
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:35,880
He says, this is an email we got him from a listener, Joe, he says, I love the show,

96
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:40,400
but your discussion about workplace organization and pay discussion, it rubbed me the wrong

97
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,960
way.

98
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:46,240
Even by the standards of the incredibly employer rights, happy us discussing pay and other

99
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,960
workplace concerns is legally protected activity.

100
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:53,640
There are rights that the labor movement in the U S fought tooth and nail and died for

101
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:56,160
in the early part of the 20th century.

102
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,400
And even if you are all on the management side, these rules have improved the lives

103
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:05,320
of everyone in the U S I get your comments about outside political organizing, but that's

104
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:07,000
not what the Apple stuff was about.

105
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,840
It is about pay and working conditions and who's getting on and what's getting swept

106
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,480
under the rug by leadership.

107
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:16,240
This is textbook labor relations stuff.

108
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:19,320
Sorry to be the annoying pro worker advocate, but I just felt like you're all were skirting

109
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:23,760
the line of literally advocating breaking employment law.

110
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:24,760
Thanks for the show.

111
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:25,760
Sorry.

112
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:29,140
I got a little ranty labor protections in the U S you're so weak.

113
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:32,920
You got to defend what little bit we have left, Joe.

114
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:38,920
This is a tricky one because I still, I still stand by a lot of what we said in, in the

115
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:41,800
manager running a business to make a lot of money perspective.

116
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:45,840
And I'm, I'm not trying to say it was, there's a big, it's just, if I can interrupt, there's

117
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:49,280
a big asterisk on us versus Apple.

118
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:53,760
You and I are so small that we are below the standards for most of those labor laws.

119
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:54,760
Oh yeah.

120
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:57,840
No, but I think both of you are probably channeling their position when we were talking about

121
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:58,840
it last week.

122
00:05:58,840 --> 00:05:59,840
I mean, right.

123
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:02,400
I was like, Oh no, you will not discuss wages and slack, right?

124
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:08,960
Like because we're small enough that I can give that edict and you know, yay, Florida's

125
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:09,960
employer.

126
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:10,960
Well, right.

127
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,800
I think I was a little callous when I said, you know, this is a lot of people who are

128
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,960
antisocial that don't want to have this conversation.

129
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:17,720
And I still kind of stand by that too.

130
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:25,920
But what I mean by it is discussing pay and how much you make is, is super not done in

131
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:28,880
the U S it's very awkward and I think it might be different on different coasts a little

132
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:34,760
bit, but on the West coast it is, it is like territory you just don't get into.

133
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:37,880
And you know, if you do, it's with people you really trust.

134
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:38,880
It's not just the West coast.

135
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:41,280
It's completely disrespectful to ask someone what they make.

136
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,280
Like, right.

137
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:44,000
It is also, it's a question like you teach your children.

138
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,040
You don't ask that.

139
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:48,760
I think the writer's correct that the Apple case is different, but I think in my head

140
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:53,960
I still had the Google case and the Microsoft cases, you know, we do some military contracting

141
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:55,600
every once in a while.

142
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,600
It's fun.

143
00:06:56,600 --> 00:07:00,400
Making six figures should not be bitching that they have to like do a contract for their

144
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,400
country.

145
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,400
Right?

146
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:08,360
If you don't want to do the job, quit, get no one employment and go fork yourself.

147
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,360
Okay.

148
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,360
Seriously.

149
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:15,080
And if you're not a U S citizen, you're afraid to lose your H one visa, then you don't belong

150
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:16,080
here.

151
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,280
Get out.

152
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,080
That's the one that's going to get us in trouble.

153
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:21,720
But honestly, these are U S corporations.

154
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:26,560
They actually do owe some sort of loyalty to the country.

155
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:32,600
And the fact that like Sundar Patrai would stand up and be like, Oh, we're going to work

156
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:33,720
with our employees on this.

157
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,600
No, you work here.

158
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,600
That's it.

159
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,600
You don't want to work.

160
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,600
You don't want, you have a problem.

161
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,080
The door's over there.

162
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,560
This is why I believe so much in tech education.

163
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:45,320
So these whiny bitches can be fired easily.

164
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:46,320
Right?

165
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:50,720
Like so that there's not such a, a need for good, like Google proof or Microsoft proof

166
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:56,240
engineers, because this is insane because again, I always bring up the special, the

167
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:03,120
inspector, but my personal hero, uh, the president of China, mr ping is not afraid of these people.

168
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,960
They do not have the same problems.

169
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:09,040
You were an engineer at, you know, well look what just happened to Jack Ma.

170
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,040
I think that's the best example.

171
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,040
Right?

172
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,040
Sure.

173
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,040
Okay.

174
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,040
He got a little too mouthy in prison.

175
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:23,400
I know I'm not advocating for fascism, but I sometimes worry that our best technical minds

176
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:26,440
don't understand how good they have it.

177
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:33,940
And like, yes, we are not perfect in any way, but I believe we're the best alternative to

178
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:39,360
what currently exists, you know, on this planet at least maybe, I mean, if the Vulcans showed

179
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:43,520
up, listen, all right, I might be, you know, live long and prosper, right?

180
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:50,420
I might turn coat, but I just, I don't know, like a thing that would have made me happy

181
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:56,240
is if like, you know, Sundar Prachai or, um, Satya Nadella stood up and said, if you are

182
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:00,160
in the divisions that work on these contracts and you refuse to work on them or you leak

183
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,600
or protest, you're simply fired.

184
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:06,200
And none of the Silicon Valley fired, none of this bull where you get six months pay,

185
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:09,360
you're fired, get out for cause.

186
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,360
No unemployment.

187
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:12,040
We're going to, we're going to go after you.

188
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:14,540
Oh, is this another New Jersey episode?

189
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:15,540
I know.

190
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:20,320
I mean, I think it's, I think it's truly how, how it's, it's a valid perspective on this.

191
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:24,320
People also, our grandfathers went to Europe and Asia to fight wars.

192
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,720
I mean, this is crazy.

193
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:31,920
You can't write some code because like, get over yourselves, knock it off you guys.

194
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:39,080
I mean, I, I have to admit I have seen excessive forms of what I think people would commonly

195
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:42,760
describe as entitlement, uh, in the tech industry.

196
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:45,620
Um, but that aside, I think it's really two issues here.

197
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:49,380
You have this entitlement that is some people just have it throughout all different industries

198
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:53,560
and certain people out there think, you know, they're, they're God's gift to a particular

199
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:55,120
industry or something.

200
00:09:55,120 --> 00:10:01,480
You have that as an issue that I think is a separate issue from fair pay and how we

201
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,480
talk about it.

202
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:07,320
And I think it's sort of, it's sort of sad that we don't have like a solution, like a

203
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:12,560
technological solution where people could input information into, into some sort of,

204
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:16,060
you know, free database and it would average out pays and areas.

205
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:20,680
The lady who Apple demanded her, that she use her personal account and then her phone,

206
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:22,820
this is what she's alleging, alleging.

207
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:26,400
And they have pictures of her breasts, like, and go on Twitter if you don't know what I'm

208
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,400
talking about.

209
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:30,360
Like Apple is clearly wrong, right?

210
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:35,320
Like this is, and the pay equity stuff, like I am 100% with you on that.

211
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:40,680
Like there should be no pay discrimination on pay, um, you know, on pay for gender, race,

212
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:42,240
religion, whatever.

213
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:47,520
Um, but it's not one issue, I guess is what I'm trying to say, Chris.

214
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:50,620
What I probably could have said better last week and what I think about when I'm thinking

215
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:56,160
about this week is I still don't really feel like maybe it should be, maybe it shouldn't

216
00:10:56,160 --> 00:11:01,560
be, but I still don't really feel like Apple's Slack instance is necessarily the best place

217
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:06,320
for these kinds of unstructured conversations that are extremely, extremely landmine filled

218
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:09,520
that could lead to all kinds of staff issues.

219
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:13,440
So I'm not really sure how I feel about that because it is maybe equivalent to what might

220
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,880
happen in a break room.

221
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:18,060
If you know, you had a group of employees in a break room, they'd be using the company's

222
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:21,020
facilities to have these conversations.

223
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:27,120
So I'm, I've sort of loosened on it, but ultimately I feel like we need something that's a solution

224
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:30,240
that is company agnostic.

225
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:34,320
It is, it is, it is like a, it is a, it is a more generalized database.

226
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:39,840
So you could have a better idea of what fair pay is across multiple companies.

227
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:43,660
There's a lot I think that has just been naturally suppressed because a lot of this goes the

228
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:48,060
way of the employer and the workers take what they can get cause they want paid.

229
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:53,040
It's not, it's, it's not as cut and dry as I think I was thinking about it last week.

230
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,040
Um, yeah.

231
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:58,760
And the stuff about the personal device and, and all of that, it's, it's so funny and it

232
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:03,080
totally undercuts their message with CSAM and all that kind of stuff, dude, it's super

233
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,080
creepy.

234
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:08,640
It's, it's these kinds of stories that expose the duality of their public image.

235
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:13,080
Oh, like Janice, the two face card, your favorite email came in this week.

236
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,560
Um, uh, was it from Micah?

237
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:15,560
Right.

238
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:16,560
Was that what it was?

239
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:17,560
Uh, yes.

240
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:18,560
Micah.

241
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:19,560
Micah.

242
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:20,560
Yeah.

243
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:21,560
You caught this and then we'd started discussing it and West caught it.

244
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:25,840
Uh, Micah wrote in and he says, I'm regarding the conversation about whether the ship has

245
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:29,120
sailed on the Linux desktop, which we talked about last week.

246
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:33,400
I hate to say this, but in a lot of ways I think it has.

247
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:34,680
Linux 19 is a second career for me.

248
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:38,320
I was a lawyer who taught myself JavaScript and then switched careers.

249
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:41,280
Before I switched, I was a dedicated full-time Linux user.

250
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:43,640
I did all my software development and playing around on Linux.

251
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:48,480
I was really convinced there was no way I would ever use windows unless for some reason

252
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:49,720
maybe somebody hated themselves.

253
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:51,560
They like being trapped in a walled garden.

254
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:58,520
Uh, it was Linux or bust, but then I got my first job as a software developer in a window

255
00:12:58,520 --> 00:12:59,520
shop.

256
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:04,960
Well, I was skeptical at first, but it turns out development in windows is actually pretty

257
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:05,960
painless.

258
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:10,720
Besides VS code, windows terminal and WSL first WSL one and now WSL two, the windows

259
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:14,480
developer experience just isn't the horror show that some concerns on the internet would

260
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,480
have you believe.

261
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:17,640
Hell, native windows development is pretty good too.

262
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:21,320
PowerShell is pretty powerful if you take the time to learn it and common bash commands

263
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:22,360
are alias these days.

264
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:24,380
So really a lot of what you already know works.

265
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:27,500
He goes on to say, what really amazed me though was WSL.

266
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:31,280
It really does virtually everything I need in Linux development and in my workflow.

267
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:32,280
It's fast.

268
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:35,640
I let you get the Linux file system, lets you get access to VS code, IntelliJ.

269
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:37,420
I can seamlessly connect to all of it.

270
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:39,920
It's a damn near native experience, he says.

271
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:44,820
And that's the thing, the stuff I need Linux for when writing code, it's just not generally

272
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:49,360
desktop stuff that, you know, there's nothing wrong with normal plasma.

273
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:54,240
They do their job, but really what I need when I'm writing software is the command line.

274
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:57,400
There's just a lot of talk out there too about Apple's M1 being a game changer and it does

275
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:59,680
seem great from a hardware point of view.

276
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:05,000
But to me, WSL too is the real challenger to desktop Linux.

277
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,280
That's what we should be talking about.

278
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:10,260
We now live in a world where you can get virtually all the benefits of Linux and the universal

279
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:14,720
application compatibility of windows without dual booting.

280
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:19,240
As a Linux user at home, well, I'm starting to find this amazing and a little scary at

281
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,240
the same time.

282
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:25,000
It's WSL, not the M1 that threatens to make Linux desktop totally unnecessary.

283
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:31,300
We literally had this conversation months ago and Micah, I honestly, like I bought that

284
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:39,000
Lenovo ThinkPad and gave it to an employee who then is not here anymore.

285
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:46,200
And then to someone I know, but if I were to buy out, I, okay, how can I phrase this?

286
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:50,600
Once you install WSL2 and I'll plug Penguin because I'm from WhiteFoundry, I like them

287
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:51,600
a lot.

288
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:58,760
It's a Debian based flavor of WSL with a lot of like dev stuff pre-initialized.

289
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:04,280
It's scary how the combination of WSL2, if you stay on the Linux file system, as you

290
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:09,120
said correctly Micah, and use VS Code, it's scary how efficient that is.

291
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:15,680
Now granted, you lack the sort of evidence grease of being on Mac, or shall I say the

292
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:21,600
good taste, but Snow Leopard's never coming back and Chris, I'm still using Addium.

293
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:26,240
Fair, you'd be right at home, you are a natural Windows user.

294
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:34,320
Let me ask you a question, when I do command space Addium, it launches and granted it doesn't

295
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:39,760
scroll by itself anymore and I can't turn it to dark mode anymore.

296
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:45,440
And sometimes when Wes puts an image in, I can't see it, but God damn it, this is good

297
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,000
enough for the enterprise.

298
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,840
It worked pretty well back in the day, I will give it that.

299
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:54,800
I think the key to this entire conversation is what does it matter?

300
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:58,840
Like it's fine, if you end up on Windows but you're using WSL, good, I mean you're still

301
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:04,960
using Linux, you're still utilizing open source and free software, I'm struggling to really

302
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:10,080
figure out what the problem is because for me, the number one problem with Windows will

303
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:15,280
always be there, it is Windows, I do not want to use it.

304
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:17,120
Why is there a problem?

305
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:23,420
If we're all talking about building something great, whether it be Linux server side applications

306
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:32,080
or whatever, do you really care if I'm on Mac and you're on Linux and Wes is on Linux

307
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:36,840
and some random dude I'm making up right now called Paul, no relation to any other Paul

308
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:41,980
as anybody might think of this on the show, is on Windows 11 and bitching about it.

309
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:42,980
Who cares?

310
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:46,920
In a weird kind of sad way, it almost matters more what browser you're using than it does

311
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:49,200
what desktop environment you're using or desktop OS.

312
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:52,040
All right, I'm going to get spicy.

313
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:58,400
The Windows developers that are installing WSL 2, I'm pretty sure they're coming from

314
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:01,940
Mac and they're still targeting Linux.

315
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:08,480
These are, and we talked about this last week and we got some heat, these are Linux developers,

316
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:13,520
they're running in Bash or ZShell or Fish or whatever shell they prefer, but you get

317
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,160
my point, right?

318
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:18,120
They're writing software that runs on Linux.

319
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:22,120
Android developers are running software that runs on Linux.

320
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:28,420
I know I'm repeating myself, but I think we need to, it's just such an important point.

321
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:32,760
Bitching about what desktop environment, an individual contributor to the community, and

322
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:37,200
when I say the community, I mean the tech community, runs is a waste of time.

323
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:41,120
Yeah, and it seems like it's even more of a waste of time now than it ever has been,

324
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,360
you know, when you look at the size of mobile too.

325
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:48,520
Well also, if we're all running VS code, seriously, if we're all running VS code, it like literally

326
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:49,520
doesn't matter.

327
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:52,040
Everybody's just using some Chromium code base, right?

328
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:54,160
It's either an Electron app or a browser.

329
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:58,520
And you can call VS code Addium or like the other 15 editors that are out there, right?

330
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:03,760
Like someone just hired a new guy at TMB and he said, oh, can I use my, you know, I like

331
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,560
this client.

332
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:10,400
And I'm, I mean, apparently we had covered it on the show, I didn't know, called Kraken.

333
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,400
Are you familiar with this?

334
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,400
Oh yeah.

335
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,400
Oh, you know Kraken?

336
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:14,400
Yep.

337
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,400
We talked about it a while ago.

338
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,400
We did?

339
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,400
Mm-hmm.

340
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,400
Good.

341
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,400
I don't remember.

342
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,400
I was probably loaded.

343
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,400
He showed it to me.

344
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,400
I'm like, that's nice.

345
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,400
And then I looked it up.

346
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:26,720
I'm like, dude, you know, you're just running an instance of Chrome, right?

347
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:27,720
Yeah.

348
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:31,080
And his exact words to me, yeah, but I, you know, I'm not a command line guy.

349
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:32,080
Why?

350
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:36,280
My preferred OS is windows.

351
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:41,680
Then I gave him pop OS and we'll, I'll keep updating on his corruption to Linux.

352
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:42,680
Yeah.

353
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:43,680
I'd be curious.

354
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:45,640
Get Kraken works good on Linux too.

355
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:47,000
So, but that's my point.

356
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:51,640
It's the same experience on all three.

357
00:18:51,640 --> 00:19:00,280
I lost the bet to a BSD guy last week for major OS's BSD is real and it just, all right,

358
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:01,280
next feedback.

359
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:04,600
Next listener, Nick writes in and wants to know the value you get from a QA team member.

360
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:09,240
He writes, you mentioned recently that you've been hiring a QA person in your company.

361
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:14,640
What value do you think a QA member will bring to your team, uh, that devs can't already

362
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:15,640
do?

363
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:16,640
I mean, devs can test.

364
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:19,520
So why not just have some of them work on QA for a while?

365
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:23,000
I'm curious to get your thoughts on the QA role in your company.

366
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Thanks Nick.

367
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,080
Damn you, Nick.

368
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,080
You caught me.

369
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:27,080
Okay.

370
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:32,040
So the QA role is just a very, very, very, very, very junior dev role.

371
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:38,920
Uh, they do QA, but we give them dev tests and I don't know if this is going to be a

372
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:43,720
reference that makes sense, but it's basically the, uh, you know, biology 100 class for liberal

373
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:44,720
arts majors.

374
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:45,720
Right?

375
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:46,720
Hmm.

376
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:47,720
Yeah.

377
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:48,720
It's like getting them started, right?

378
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:49,720
Low expectations.

379
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:55,400
It's people we might not have hired for straight dev role at that salary that we're willing

380
00:19:55,400 --> 00:20:01,080
to give a shot on this role and see how they do for about a month.

381
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:02,880
And can I go deeper into this?

382
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:03,880
Oh yeah.

383
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:06,280
Oh my God, this is so bad.

384
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:08,080
This is so bad.

385
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:13,480
We used to treat bootcamp graduates the same as we treated college.

386
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:15,000
It's a super duper junior role.

387
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
I don't even know what to say.

388
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Right?

389
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,040
It's like our, you seem enthusiastic.

390
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:24,960
Normally wouldn't give you the higher job, but we'll give you a shot.

391
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:29,040
And the way I see it, Chris, is it's my way of giving folks a chance who maybe I wouldn't

392
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:30,680
normally just throw out their resume.

393
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:31,680
Right.

394
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:32,680
Right.

395
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:35,400
It's a good way to get somebody in an entry level and if nothing else, they can get some

396
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:40,800
QA work done and if they show the interest in the talents and are motivated, they can

397
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:41,800
work their way up.

398
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,440
It sounds like it's a clever idea really.

399
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:50,780
I think very sly cool lino.com slash coder.

400
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:54,880
Go there to get $100 in 60 day credit on your new account and you can go there to support

401
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:55,880
this here show.

402
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:58,360
You know, it's just over a year we have an independent now.

403
00:20:58,360 --> 00:20:59,360
So thank you.

404
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:02,840
Everyone who's taken advantage of our sponsor offers gives us an opportunity to work with

405
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:05,780
a company that we could enthusiastically recommend to.

406
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:11,920
They started in 2003 as one of the first companies in cloud computing and now 18 years later,

407
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:16,420
Linode is the largest independent open cloud provider in the world with 11 data centers

408
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:17,540
around the world.

409
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:20,800
They are their own ISP too, so they're super fast.

410
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:24,280
Linode's mission though remains unchanged since they started in 2003.

411
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:29,440
Now that they're on their own ISP, now that they really have refined and honed the experience

412
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,480
too, it's a great time to become a Linode customer.

413
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:35,960
I've been watching them really grow over the last couple of years and over time I've taken

414
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:39,360
advantage of some of their ancillary services, I guess you could put it.

415
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:44,120
I mean services that are beyond just great virtual servers like their S3 compatible object

416
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:48,840
storage and their VLAN support and their powerful DNS manager, which makes it really easy for

417
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:51,720
us to kind of quickly set up projects.

418
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:55,440
You would be surprised at how quickly we can get machines going to help supplement a segment

419
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:58,080
Linux unplugged or to test something out for the show.

420
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:02,320
It's something we do pretty frequently and I really appreciate how slick they make all

421
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:03,320
of that.

422
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:07,160
And as you learn how to use the system too, you can really get moving quick.

423
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:10,820
But on top of that, Linode's got Kubernetes support, they got Terraform support, I mean

424
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:16,080
a lot of stuff, but they managed to just display it all with a really clean, simple to use

425
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,080
interface.

426
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:19,920
That's why I think you should go over there and try it, linode.com slash coder, get that

427
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:24,200
$100 and try it out and you'll find they're 30 to 50% cheaper than the major cloud providers

428
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:25,200
out there.

429
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:29,680
66% of companies are saving money now by mixing with alternative cloud providers from the

430
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:35,400
big hyperscalers to companies like Linode and then you're going to find Linode systems

431
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:37,000
really, really scream.

432
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:42,160
And if you ever run into any trouble, they've got fantastic, amazing 24 seven customer support

433
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:44,760
by phone, by ticket, by email, they're going to help you.

434
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:51,400
They also have a ton of how to's, guides and tutorials to get you started and then sort

435
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:55,400
of to round it all out, they've really taken care of people in the community.

436
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:59,240
They support a lot of community, a lot of independent content creators, open source

437
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:03,320
projects, they provide hosting and all kinds of technical expertise.

438
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:04,320
It's pretty cool.

439
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:08,060
And they made this Jupiter colony reunion trip possible as well so that we could go

440
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:10,640
out and see some of you out there.

441
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:13,360
Linode's dedicated to offering the best virtualized cloud computing out there.

442
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:15,480
If it runs on Linux, it runs on Linode.

443
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:20,860
So sign up today at linode.com slash coder and get $100 in 60 day credit on your new

444
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:23,360
account and you support the show.

445
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:28,520
Linode.com slash coder.

446
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:34,600
Well today as we record, Apple just got done unveiling the iPhone 13 pro and the pro max

447
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:38,440
and the mini and all the things that they have now.

448
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:41,720
And well, there's not a lot really for us to dig into.

449
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:44,640
All the models are going to be available to preorder starting the Friday that we record

450
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:47,400
that September 17th at five am Pacific.

451
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:50,440
They're going to ship on Friday, September 24th.

452
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:56,320
They have an A15 bionic CPU with a six core CPU and a five core GPU, which seems to be

453
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:57,440
a pretty nice bump.

454
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,200
They've managed to keep that going.

455
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:02,160
They're adding now a variable refresh rate.

456
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:08,080
They call it, of course, like pro motion and they're offering a one terabyte storage option

457
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:10,200
on the higher end.

458
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,760
Anything about this event strike you?

459
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:18,520
I refuse to answer questions that the IRS may later want you to discuss with me.

460
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:22,760
Yeah, they had some iPads they announced as well, some watches.

461
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:25,400
So I mean, there's a selection of stuff.

462
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:28,880
So OK, the watch stuff struck me.

463
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:29,880
Really?

464
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:33,440
So long time listeners will know back in 2015 I took a pair of heart attacks.

465
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:34,440
Good time.

466
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:35,440
A lot of fun.

467
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:36,440
I have a heart condition.

468
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:37,440
New listeners.

469
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:38,440
Shocker.

470
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:44,120
So I have been I was actually, you know, this course, I was a fan of traditional watches,

471
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:46,760
meaning like, you know, mechanical watches.

472
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:47,760
Right.

473
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:51,160
But once that happened, I switched to a smart watch.

474
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:53,600
I went to I mean, I think we have episodes on the right.

475
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:54,920
I tried the fossil watches.

476
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:56,760
Remember those that were at Google Play?

477
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:57,760
Oh, yeah.

478
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:58,760
Google I.O. rather.

479
00:24:58,760 --> 00:24:59,760
Yeah.

480
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:00,760
Yeah.

481
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:01,760
I tried a lot of the Android watches.

482
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:07,640
I tried way too many of those are terrible and the way the battery life is way too short.

483
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:14,240
I honestly, I'm going to be a day one purchaser of the new Apple Watch.

484
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:18,920
Having this is super inside baseball, but I think it's important.

485
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:25,000
Having a real time kind of tracking of my heart rate and my EKG, you know, as good as

486
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:30,360
Apple can get it or ECG, as they call it, as good as Apple can get it is important to

487
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:31,360
me.

488
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:32,360
Hmm.

489
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:35,880
OK, so much so that I forget how but ugly this watch is.

490
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:39,560
Was there a big rumor that it was going to be like flat edges and all redesigned and

491
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:40,560
a totally different look?

492
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:43,720
And it doesn't look like I was hoping I was hoping it looked like like a regular watch.

493
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:44,720
Right.

494
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:45,720
Yeah.

495
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:46,720
It didn't look like that happened at all.

496
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,000
So that was what I was.

497
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:52,800
But I'm definitely the seven they've better sensors, increased health, you know, software

498
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:54,880
compatibility with external devices.

499
00:25:54,880 --> 00:26:01,280
I'm not loving the idea of having to buy more dongles for Apple stuff, but whatever.

500
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:06,480
From a dev perspective, I'm not sure that the Apple Watch gives you anything.

501
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,800
The iPhone 13, the better refresh rate.

502
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:09,800
That's fantastic.

503
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:15,840
If you're watching movies on your iPhone like an animal, but I mean, games will look prettier,

504
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:20,720
but your average game developer is going to have to focus on older devices anyway.

505
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:25,980
But the thing that struck me and that I impulse purchased was the iPad mini.

506
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:28,320
But there was only one color that was acceptable.

507
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:29,320
Gold.

508
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:30,320
What?

509
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:33,280
It was purple because on brand with the mad botter.

510
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:35,280
Oh, they have a purple.

511
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:36,280
Yep.

512
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:37,280
Heck, yeah.

513
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:38,280
That's cool.

514
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:39,280
It looks fantastic.

515
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:42,040
And I have been an iPad mini supporter for years.

516
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:48,080
And I frankly think Apple has been making a huge mistake by not treating the mini.

517
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:49,880
They treat it like the device you give your kid.

518
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:52,200
No, the mini is a viable tablet.

519
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:53,240
They hardly ever update it.

520
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:56,840
They launched it in 2012 and they've done it with two updates or something ridiculous

521
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:57,840
like that.

522
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:58,840
Yeah.

523
00:26:58,840 --> 00:26:59,840
It's only gotten two updates.

524
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:00,840
Yes.

525
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:04,720
But she's and you can tell when a developer wrote an iPad app and they didn't think about

526
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:09,440
the mini because like it's like the toolbars just like encroach upon the content space.

527
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,440
It's terrible.

528
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:13,080
They're also going to include a smart folio case with it all.

529
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:19,880
You know, this event, from what I did see, I think the virtual events are done with me.

530
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:24,960
I find these now to be kind of boring.

531
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:31,240
It's a perfect sanitized, packaged up version of Apple's reality delivered to you in a live

532
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:32,240
stream.

533
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:33,240
Steve Jobs is dead.

534
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:36,440
I like when it's live because there's there's mistakes.

535
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:38,320
There's ums and ah moments.

536
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:40,840
There's there's just there's a reality to it.

537
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:43,840
Like the device has to actually be able to do the things they say it can do.

538
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:45,640
But in these videos, it could all be CG.

539
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:46,640
It just doesn't matter.

540
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,880
Well, there's more drama to the live performance.

541
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,680
It's an actual stage performance.

542
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:51,760
This is like Santa.

543
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:53,680
This is I mean, this is corporate PR.

544
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:54,820
I mean, they're all corporate PR.

545
00:27:54,820 --> 00:27:59,640
But this is like, if I was a PR executive, I would think this is how all events should

546
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:00,640
go.

547
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:05,640
It's like two hours of mainline corporate PR that is just and they do a fantastic job

548
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:09,720
with the cinematography and the effects and they put it all together in the flow and that

549
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:10,960
they give a lot of thought to it.

550
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:13,120
And I'm not trying to take away from that.

551
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:17,600
But I'm just saying as it lands on me, I can even catch this one live, you know, like,

552
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:18,600
okay, well, we'll see later.

553
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:19,600
I got other stuff to do.

554
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,000
I'm moving my RV.

555
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:25,920
I think for me, I'm more interested in the software side of the Apple platform this year.

556
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:32,040
iOS 15, iPadOS 15, I think, are actually pretty significant, especially on the iPad side.

557
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:36,800
And these devices don't really they'd like there wasn't something that was significantly

558
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:39,240
introduced that I'm like, oh, yeah, well, that's gonna be great.

559
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:43,460
It's like, okay, well, mostly everything I want is going to be software side this year.

560
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:46,380
New cameras are always are always nice to see, I suppose.

561
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:48,240
And promotion is nice to see.

562
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:51,600
And my mini, you know, I got the iPhone mini this time around.

563
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:52,600
Oh, really?

564
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:56,640
I've really been regretting it for for about three, three or four months.

565
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:59,240
Maybe about halfway through, really, for six months now, I've probably wanted to get rid

566
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:00,800
of this iPhone mini.

567
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:03,040
It's got the battery life of an Android phone.

568
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:06,880
So it's completely disappointing, completely unacceptable and imbecile.

569
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:09,560
The camera I miss having the zoom.

570
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:12,200
It gets hot as hell all the time.

571
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:17,880
My battery health is like down to 85 86% already, I assume because I'm having to constantly

572
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:18,880
charge it.

573
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,840
So it's just it's heating up all the time and wearing down.

574
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:23,160
Hang on, Chris, you need to pause.

575
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:27,800
Drew, I'm vomiting right now because he mentioned Android twice.

576
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:34,720
And I've been doing Android student development and there he goes.

577
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:35,720
There he goes.

578
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:36,720
Sorry.

579
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:37,720
All right.

580
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:38,720
Sorry.

581
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:39,720
All right.

582
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:40,720
Let's keep going.

583
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:41,720
So I think I'll get a big one this time.

584
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:42,720
I think I'm going to go the other way around.

585
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:43,720
I'm gonna get a real big one.

586
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:44,720
You're going all the way.

587
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:45,720
Wait, wait, wait.

588
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:46,720
Are you getting the regular one?

589
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:47,720
Are you going pro max, man?

590
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:51,120
So I'm going to I'm going to swing so hard the other direction that my head's going to

591
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:52,840
spin because I got the upgrade program.

592
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:56,840
I understand if you ever get mugged, you could just kill the dude with that.

593
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:57,840
It's a weapon.

594
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:02,400
I got to say, as stupid as it is, the pro res video actually is appealing to me.

595
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:03,400
Really?

596
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:04,400
I know.

597
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:06,040
I actually do a lot of video on my phone for family stuff.

598
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:07,800
I do family videos and stuff.

599
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:10,040
So is it really that much better?

600
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:15,760
Well, any time I can work with uncompressed source or I guess pro res is kind of like

601
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:21,500
what flack is for audio, it's it's compression, but it's lossless compression as lossless

602
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:22,700
as it can be.

603
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:26,880
But when you're working with iPhone footage that's an MP four or something like that,

604
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:32,440
it's already really squished down and anything you do with it is going to double encode it.

605
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:36,040
But with pro res, you can bring it in and work with it and not encode it all the way

606
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:37,240
down until the very end.

607
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:41,720
And so you maintain quality and that's going to matter more as these cameras get better

608
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:42,720
and better and better.

609
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:43,800
You're going to want to be able to maintain that quality.

610
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:47,640
So I mean, it's going to take up a lot of space, but I'm going to use it immediately.

611
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:54,240
I use pro res even on our Linux OBS system in the studio when we're recording video.

612
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:59,340
I record to pro res on Linux because it's just a fantastic codec.

613
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:00,340
And I don't know.

614
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:03,320
I actually haven't done the digging to know if it's actually true, legitimate pro res

615
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:09,000
or if it's some rebrand of some other codec that Apple, they could be doing that, too.

616
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:13,680
But that kind of stuff, those technical details actually do appeal to me.

617
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:17,640
And I think that's where the Pro Max continues to kind of be an appealing phone for people

618
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:20,580
who are technical and into the iPhone.

619
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:23,800
There are actually some of us out there who are geeks and like iPhones.

620
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:25,720
What are you talking about?

621
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:29,560
There's a lot of people out there like that.

622
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:30,560
I know.

623
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:31,560
I know.

624
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:32,560
Just sometimes it feels like people don't think so.

625
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:35,280
I just want to say Mac was the Linux of Linux.

626
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:36,280
You know.

627
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:37,280
Wow.

628
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:38,280
Before Linux.

629
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:39,280
Yeah.

630
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:40,280
Wow.

631
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:42,920
You know, all in all, I think these things are getting pretty boring as far as like,

632
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:45,440
you know, these are not must have devices anymore.

633
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:50,200
They didn't introduce any new technology or like revolutionize some AR app.

634
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:52,160
None of that's really happening anymore.

635
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,160
And good on them.

636
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:54,160
You know what?

637
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:57,040
We don't really need everyone buying new phones every year.

638
00:31:57,040 --> 00:32:00,720
And I don't necessarily think Apple needs your money either.

639
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:03,960
So I think it's great for people who are on like the iPhone 10 right now.

640
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:05,440
This is a no brainer update.

641
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:09,640
But for those of us are on the iPhone 12, unless there's like part of the upgrade program

642
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:12,500
or there's some other reason you'd want to upgrade or like maybe you're super disappointed

643
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:13,960
with your phone.

644
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:16,760
I think this is kind of a skip year for most people.

645
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:22,520
I mean, spoiler, it is for me, except for the iPad mini, which I bought because it was

646
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:23,520
purple.

647
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:26,320
There's probably one other Apple topic we could we could discuss before we move off

648
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:27,320
of Apple completely.

649
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:30,960
Yeah, I think we should talk about the epic lawsuit.

650
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:35,920
Every journalist, every scummy tech journalist is like epic kicked Apple's ass at Apple one,

651
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:36,920
right?

652
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:37,920
Apple straight up one.

653
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:40,360
There's a couple things, though, that I want to talk to you about in here when you look

654
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:41,360
through this.

655
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:46,720
So you know how Apple already had this reader category of apps in the App Store where they

656
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:50,560
could kind of get out of the cut like Netflix is in there and stuff?

657
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:51,560
Yep.

658
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:55,720
This judge is kind of defined a new category for Apple in the App Store where different

659
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:57,100
rules can apply.

660
00:32:57,100 --> 00:33:02,360
That's what's essentially happening here is what what Judge Gonzales Rogers did is essentially

661
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:09,520
say gaming is and can be treated differently than all other app categories in the App Store.

662
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:13,840
People can have different rules about in app purchases and all of that stuff for games

663
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:15,720
than anything else.

664
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:20,240
And games are a huge part of Apple's App Store revenue.

665
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:24,440
According to the ruling, the judge said 70 percent of Apple's App Store revenue comes

666
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:25,600
from gaming.

667
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:29,840
And in there, they're like, yeah, this whole category is can have totally different rules.

668
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:33,440
And so now Apple has the reader category and the gaming category where they can have different

669
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:37,280
rules that don't have to be the uniform same like they used to be.

670
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:39,040
I think that's going to be huge for them.

671
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:41,880
People just sort of won in a weird way.

672
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:46,160
Yeah, because the judge also said not a monopoly near a monopoly, but not a monopoly.

673
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:50,880
They have a 55 percent share of the mobile game transaction market, which is that new

674
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:57,480
category that was defined and extraordinarily, quote, extraordinarily high profit margins,

675
00:33:57,480 --> 00:34:00,200
which can be a sign of monopoly power.

676
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:05,200
But despite considerable profit and power, quote, this is a quote here.

677
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:09,120
These factors alone do not show antitrust conduct.

678
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:10,400
Success is not illegal.

679
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:14,880
Well, then, yeah, that's probably pretty good for Apple, too.

680
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:15,880
Right.

681
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:19,920
I mean, that's got to be that's got to be the icing on the cake here for them.

682
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:22,800
And then they can point to all these changes to say, well, look, we're trying not to be

683
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:23,800
a monopoly.

684
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:25,140
Well, so I really thought about it, right?

685
00:34:25,140 --> 00:34:28,120
Like you can have let's just take the most generous view of this.

686
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:32,360
You can have a like a little button that says buy with your credit card and like strike

687
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:34,800
put something in your app, which I don't think Apple is even allow.

688
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,520
I think it's going to have to open safari.

689
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:40,680
But let's even assume that you can do that.

690
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:44,360
As a consumer, I would always use IAP.

691
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:47,320
I would always use Apple's IAP.

692
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:48,320
It's safer.

693
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:50,240
And if something is terrible, you can get a refund.

694
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:51,240
Right.

695
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:52,240
Yeah.

696
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:55,880
And for memberships and subscriptions, I having all of my memberships and subscriptions in

697
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:56,880
one spot.

698
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:57,880
Yeah, it's invaluable, actually.

699
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:58,880
Yeah.

700
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:03,880
I may even be willing to pay slightly more per month to have an easy cancellation, you

701
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:08,720
know, and I'm way more likely to subscribe if I know I can cancel easily.

702
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:10,960
Just you know, I think that's human nature.

703
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:12,200
And that's what Apple system offers.

704
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:13,440
And if they could keep that somehow.

705
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:16,680
But honestly, man, you could deliver that with some sort of API if they really could

706
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:17,720
be bothered.

707
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:19,600
You know, it's not their style, but if they could be.

708
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:24,400
Yeah, but then I can do that's going to be one of the features of using Apple system

709
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:28,400
for the customer is that easy cancellations, right?

710
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:31,400
No, you have to call and talk to some rep, you know.

711
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:34,520
Well, I'd say the easy cancellations, easy purchase.

712
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:37,460
You already have you already have current payment info because it's how you pay for

713
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:41,720
everything in the Apple ecosystem, including your iCloud storage and crap like that.

714
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:46,140
But additionally, it plugs in the currently it plugs in with their family controls.

715
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:48,520
So my kids have to seek authorization.

716
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:50,200
I get a prompt on my phone.

717
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:54,640
I use face ID to authorize the purchase on my phone for their phone.

718
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:59,240
And then everyone in the family has access to that app to that, you know, all could be

719
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:01,500
done with an API as well, but is unlikely.

720
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:04,480
But Apple has to figure it out because as part of this, the judge is going to have an

721
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:09,440
injunction soon that prevents Apple from banning those external links or buttons or other calls

722
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:11,600
of action.

723
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:14,680
It's not really clear on on what they're going to be able to limit.

724
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:20,140
But previously, you know, this has been to the extent of if you have a privacy policy

725
00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:25,360
and you tap that and it brings you to a, you know, in app safari page so you can read the

726
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:30,840
privacy policy off off your website, if anything in their links out of that, like a like a

727
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:35,920
policy statement or your logo, Apple would deny your apps entrance into the app store

728
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:40,080
simply for linking outside the app for the privacy policy during a payment information

729
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:43,500
like it's they've been extremely strict on this kind of stuff.

730
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:46,240
So they're going to have to find some middle ground.

731
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:47,240
Worst story here.

732
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:49,980
I have personally had the Code Journal iOS app.

733
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:53,480
This is way, way back a decade now.

734
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:57,880
It's to my website at the time, my personal website.

735
00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:03,600
And on there, I had a thing where you could pay me a couple hundred dollars for a I can't

736
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:04,600
remember what I call it.

737
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:08,760
It was like a basically like, should you build an app consulting session, right?

738
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:12,760
And I had like a little ghetto stripe API thing done in Ruby.

739
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:16,640
That was enough for them to reject that version of the app.

740
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:19,280
It was a three click process to get there, though.

741
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:20,280
Yeah.

742
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:21,280
And they did it.

743
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,280
And they did it.

744
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:25,160
Because, you know, they're told to protect the revenue stream revenue.

745
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:28,400
And if they if they let one through the cracks, then it sets a precedence.

746
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:29,400
So they would do it.

747
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:36,440
But ultimately, I mean, ultimately, this face facts the on mobile, the revenue for developers

748
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:39,360
on the iOS stores.

749
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:43,440
If you can only pick one platform, that's that's going to be it, right?

750
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:46,900
That's the interesting thing here, because the only other option really in the mobile

751
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:49,960
space is the play platform and on Google.

752
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:55,520
And they so clearly, in my opinion, are helping each other right now by making these slight

753
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:59,920
adjustments kind of in conjunction with each other, not necessarily the same time, but

754
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:05,240
around the same time and normalizing and standardizing the marketplace and the way they have.

755
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:07,840
They are helping each other.

756
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:12,400
They they they are so dependent on each other to get through this right now.

757
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:13,400
It's gross.

758
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:16,960
And I think we get caught up in the Apple versus Google war.

759
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:21,100
But the reality is these two companies need each other desperately to get through this

760
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:22,880
antitrust stuff.

761
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:24,420
And it's gross.

762
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:27,280
And it's it's completely leaving developers in the lurch.

763
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:31,280
And the regulators will look at and go, oh, well, it's fine.

764
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:32,280
There's two of them.

765
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:33,280
There's a Coke and a Pepsi.

766
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:34,320
And they're keeping each other competitive.

767
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:38,560
But the reality is, is they're they're making concessions where they have to.

768
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:41,880
And they're each they're each looking at each other and working closely together, maybe

769
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:43,960
not directly, but very closely in step.

770
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:44,960
Right.

771
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:48,680
And you get the email that was revealed where, you know, they were talking to each other

772
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:51,240
and saying, let's work as one company on these issues.

773
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:52,240
Yeah.

774
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:53,240
Yeah.

775
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:54,240
And that was a bit ago.

776
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:55,240
But I would imagine that still stands.

777
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:56,240
Right.

778
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:57,240
It's life or death stuff here.

779
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:58,400
So survival.

780
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:00,000
All these lawsuits are about a bit ago.

781
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,000
Right.

782
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:04,280
So who do you think benefits then from I mean, we knew we knew you and I said it from the

783
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:05,280
day one.

784
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:06,400
We knew this was going to go Apple's way.

785
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:07,400
We called it immediately.

786
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:12,520
No one benefits, not even Apple, obviously, but besides Apple, you know, who benefits

787
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:18,000
some crafty big game developer who who somehow has people's credit card information on file

788
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:22,000
that could charge them slightly less, but take advantage of, you know, a three point

789
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:25,800
five or five percent credit card fee and avoid Apple's 30 percent cut.

790
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:27,680
The little guy doesn't get anything from this.

791
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:32,120
I don't have quite the bad look on it that you do, but because I think I think we're

792
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:37,440
at this stage, we're forgetting the very clever political public battle.

793
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:42,040
So Epic fought not only in the court, but they also fought in the court of public opinion.

794
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:44,960
And they played that game better than Apple did.

795
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:49,360
And I think they took Apple down more than a couple of pegs in the eyes of the development

796
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:50,360
community.

797
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:53,280
They lay led with that campaign right away.

798
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:58,080
I mean, they came in and they beat Apple at their own messaging game for months during

799
00:39:58,080 --> 00:39:59,080
this thing.

800
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:01,280
And they got those emails out and that testimony out.

801
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:06,680
I think that is going to be the long term damage that this case did.

802
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:08,600
And that's not insignificant.

803
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:12,920
What is the difference between September and July?

804
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:17,840
If you're an indie developer with limited resources and you can only target I'm sorry

805
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:23,160
for an indie game developer, I'll even make it more specific with limited financial resources

806
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:28,200
and going to target one platform, nothing, nothing.

807
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:33,280
If you want to make money, if you want to feed your family, the answer is still iOS.

808
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:35,240
So Epic has accomplished nothing.

809
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:38,760
And by the way, Epic are not the you know, they're not Joan of Arc here.

810
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:44,200
They're not, you know, some some white as snow virgin warrior coming in, right?

811
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:46,460
They wanted to open the Epic Games store on iOS.

812
00:40:46,460 --> 00:40:49,680
And by the way, you should see the I mean, and this is something the judge mentioned

813
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:55,760
in her 185 page ruling that they pull the same bull on their developers on the Epic

814
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:56,760
Games store.

815
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:57,760
Yeah.

816
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:58,760
And she's like, also, I'm looking at this.

817
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:00,260
This is not really going to impact your bottom line.

818
00:41:00,260 --> 00:41:03,100
You've clearly just optimized your business everywhere else.

819
00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:06,360
And this is the last part you're making great margins, you're not making great margins

820
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:07,360
on.

821
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:08,360
And so you're just trying to optimize this.

822
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:11,080
This isn't going to make or break you guys like she called them out on that, too.

823
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:16,520
Like, I don't know, for me, part of the show is the you know, the plight of the indie developer.

824
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:20,940
And somebody wrote in said, Hey, I'm your team of three people.

825
00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:25,200
We're building a game, we're releasing it on iOS, well, how should we do our payments,

826
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:30,480
I would say do an app purchase and use every new Apple API you can.

827
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:33,600
And if you can do it in Swift, right?

828
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:40,480
Like release right after a new version of iOS, because ultimately, money talks and this

829
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:42,680
bull is just walks, right?

830
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:46,220
Like Epic is full of right the back of the turtle as long as you can really.

831
00:41:46,220 --> 00:41:48,320
But Epic wanted to be a new turtle, right?

832
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:50,900
They wanted to be.

833
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:54,120
They wanted to be their own platform on somebody else's platform.

834
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:55,120
And I hate them all.

835
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:58,320
I missed the dream of the open web from the 90s.

836
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:02,200
There's that there is that an optimist gray is really he's nailed in the chat room.

837
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:05,360
The people who benefit the most from this are the lawyers.

838
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:12,840
Yeah, well, the lawyers get 30% of the fun to help indie developers out of that was cute.

866
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:48,280
JDK 17 was released and we threw a little party for it here.

867
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:52,360
And you know, everybody had champagne, had some cake.

868
00:43:52,360 --> 00:43:53,360
It was grand.

869
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:54,360
Did you know?

870
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:56,480
Did you notice that JDK 17 was out?

871
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:57,480
Did you have a party?

872
00:43:57,480 --> 00:43:58,480
Oh, yes.

873
00:43:58,480 --> 00:43:59,480
I had a Java.

874
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:03,280
I'm Oh, God, you've added me.

875
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:04,280
Chris.

876
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:05,280
Listeners.

877
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:06,280
Yeah.

878
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:09,040
My name is Mike and I have a confession.

879
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:10,040
Oh, no.

880
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:11,920
I no longer use a French press.

881
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:15,560
Oh, oh, oh, are you using a cake up?

882
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:16,960
Did you go cake up?

883
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:18,640
Actually, so this is complicated.

884
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:24,800
Keurig makes a coffee pot, like a regular drip pot with a cake up system.

885
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:26,080
So is it still a cake up?

886
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:27,080
But they're just dripping it.

887
00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:28,080
No, no, no.

888
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:29,720
One side is the cake up system.

889
00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:33,360
Oh, and one side is like a regular like Mr. Coffee system.

890
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:34,360
You got to be kidding me.

891
00:44:34,360 --> 00:44:35,840
Mom, that's serious.

892
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:37,200
I'm looking this up right now.

893
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:38,200
It exists.

894
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:39,200
Yeah.

895
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:41,120
I mean, so you got you got yourself one of these.

896
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:42,120
I see.

897
00:44:42,120 --> 00:44:43,120
Yeah.

898
00:44:43,120 --> 00:44:44,960
Man, I just don't know that Keurig's though.

899
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:49,980
So can you put like ground up your own ground up coffee beans in the drip side?

900
00:44:49,980 --> 00:44:52,340
So straight up on the regular side.

901
00:44:52,340 --> 00:44:54,400
It is a literal regular coffee machine.

902
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:56,040
You put a filter and you put coffee grounds.

903
00:44:56,040 --> 00:44:58,200
I need a link to this thing.

904
00:44:58,200 --> 00:44:59,360
Chat room go find me a link to this.

905
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:00,800
Would you somebody in the chat room find me a link to this?

906
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:03,600
I got to see this Keurig with drip now.

907
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:04,600
Yeah.

908
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:05,600
No, I just can't be.

909
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:06,600
What?

910
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:07,600
Wow.

911
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:08,600
I'm on their website now.

912
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:09,600
I'm like I'm browsing Keurig's website.

913
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:10,600
And you're right.

914
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:12,300
They've gotten into drip coffee.

915
00:45:12,300 --> 00:45:14,480
Is it the K duo single serve?

916
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:15,480
Is that what you got?

917
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:16,480
K duo coffee Mako?

918
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:17,480
Yeah.

919
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:18,480
Yeah.

920
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:19,480
That's that's what I have.

921
00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:20,480
The K duo.

922
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:21,480
Huh?

923
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:22,480
And I never ever use the cake upside.

924
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:23,480
Then why'd you get the duo?

925
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:24,480
You know, I was a recent divorcee.

926
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:25,480
We all done crazy.

927
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:26,480
I did a little crazy.

928
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:27,480
I don't know.

929
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:28,480
Yeah.

930
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:29,480
You got you get it.

931
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:30,480
You get a weird coffee maker.

932
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:31,480
I understand.

933
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:37,160
I did the same thing because like I was too tired for the French presses and whatever.

934
00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:41,040
Well, you know what?

935
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:42,040
I'll put a link in the show notes.

936
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:43,040
I don't know why.

937
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:45,640
You know, JDK 17 is great.

938
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:48,160
It's yeah, it's Java.

939
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:49,160
It'll be fine.

940
00:45:49,160 --> 00:45:50,160
Keep going.

941
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:51,160
It's Java.

942
00:45:51,160 --> 00:45:52,160
It's going to be fine.

943
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:53,160
Right.

944
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:54,160
It's you know what?

945
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:55,160
That could be our tagline for every time we talk about Java.

946
00:45:55,160 --> 00:45:56,160
It's Java.

947
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:57,160
It's going to be fine.

948
00:45:57,160 --> 00:46:01,880
But one actual interesting point about this release, sorry, guys, is it is an LTS release.

949
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:05,680
And the last LTS was JDK 11, believe it or not.

950
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:11,000
So all the new goodness that you've had, I think Lambdas, I don't remember when Lambdas

951
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:12,000
came in.

952
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:16,160
The only Java project I've done in the last few years has been JDK 8 and it's like living

953
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:17,160
in hell.

954
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:18,160
But great.

955
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:19,160
17.

956
00:46:19,160 --> 00:46:22,400
Before we run out of here, I usually when we're on is every now and then if there's

957
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:27,680
a good like punch Facebook in the in the face story as we go, I like to do it.

958
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:28,680
Right in the dick.

959
00:46:28,680 --> 00:46:29,680
Let's do it.

960
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:33,000
Wall Street Journal has a story today that internal documents that have leaked from Facebook's

961
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:38,720
own research shows that Instagram is harmful to a sizable percentage of its users, especially

962
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:43,840
teen girls, but has taken a few steps to remedy it.

963
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:48,400
In depth, internal research shows significant teen mental health issues.

964
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:49,880
Oh, man.

965
00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:55,120
OK, but like, duh, they're evil.

966
00:46:55,120 --> 00:46:58,280
They continue to do evil things.

967
00:46:58,280 --> 00:46:59,860
Honestly.

968
00:46:59,860 --> 00:47:01,880
This is where China has an advantage.

969
00:47:01,880 --> 00:47:03,600
Maybe they just shouldn't exist.

970
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:04,600
Right.

971
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:10,680
But yeah, the problem right now, it's like the other things online push kids towards

972
00:47:10,680 --> 00:47:16,160
social media because I see my kids like, can I get a tick tock dad like what can I upload

973
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:20,520
to YouTube like they get on YouTube and they see this stuff.

974
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:25,420
YouTube is like the platform that like they get all their information from and then they

975
00:47:25,420 --> 00:47:28,160
learn about other social media platforms from YouTube.

976
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:30,280
It all starts with YouTube.

977
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:36,200
Why not a federal law requiring kids not to have Facebook until they're, you know, 18

978
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:37,200
or 21?

979
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:40,360
Hell, they can't have a beer, but they can have Facebook that makes them kill themselves.

980
00:47:40,360 --> 00:47:41,360
That seems great.

981
00:47:41,360 --> 00:47:42,360
Right.

982
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:43,360
Huh.

983
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:45,520
I mean, have we ever talked about limiting technology like that?

984
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:48,680
I mean, I'm trying to think of something that's considered modern technology.

985
00:47:48,680 --> 00:47:51,400
I mean, obviously we we already limit technology like that.

986
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:54,440
The automobile, automobiles and guns.

987
00:47:54,440 --> 00:47:58,320
And I mean, that kind of but I'm trying to think of like modern computing technology

988
00:47:58,320 --> 00:47:59,320
and software.

989
00:47:59,320 --> 00:48:04,160
Pornography is technically not legal for kids to do.

990
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:05,740
So we are to do this.

991
00:48:05,740 --> 00:48:06,740
That is true.

992
00:48:06,740 --> 00:48:07,740
That is true.

993
00:48:07,740 --> 00:48:12,840
And you could probably even find an argument that social media is more harmful than a lot

994
00:48:12,840 --> 00:48:13,840
of porn.

995
00:48:13,840 --> 00:48:14,840
Although maybe not.

996
00:48:14,840 --> 00:48:15,840
I don't know.

997
00:48:15,840 --> 00:48:16,840
I have a five year old son.

998
00:48:16,840 --> 00:48:23,040
I would rather give him a martini right now than let him have a Facebook account.

999
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:24,200
I could totally see what you're saying.

1000
00:48:24,200 --> 00:48:27,320
It's like, yeah, it's less dangerous, less harmful.

1001
00:48:27,320 --> 00:48:31,040
I mean, this is not that I would give my kid a liquor, don't people don't like call Dreyfuss

1002
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:33,200
or whatever or Child Protective Services.

1003
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:34,200
Right.

1004
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:35,200
Right.

1005
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:36,200
No, I follow what you mean.

1006
00:48:36,200 --> 00:48:38,000
Yeah, I feel like this is something everybody knew but didn't talk about.

1007
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:39,000
But they did the math.

1008
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:44,040
And it's like, OK, yeah, young girls, teenage girls are killing themselves.

1009
00:48:44,040 --> 00:48:47,480
And by the way, when we say teenage, these are still children we're talking about.

1010
00:48:47,480 --> 00:48:48,480
And they knew.

1011
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:49,480
Right.

1012
00:48:49,480 --> 00:48:54,140
They did their own research and they found out they knew the whole time.

1013
00:48:54,140 --> 00:49:00,320
So maybe like we just borrow a couple of Chinese cabinet members.

1014
00:49:00,320 --> 00:49:03,320
I'm just kidding.

1015
00:49:03,320 --> 00:49:04,320
Borrow everything else from there.

1016
00:49:04,320 --> 00:49:07,880
You know, I don't know if it might not be a Jersey week, it might be a Beijing week.

1017
00:49:07,880 --> 00:49:11,760
I tell you what, I enjoyed some great egg rolls this week.

1018
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:12,760
Yeah.

1019
00:49:12,760 --> 00:49:13,760
You know what?

1020
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:16,920
I you know, one of the number one things I'm missing from the studio is the air fryer.

1021
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:23,240
I got myself a used air fryer for lunches and make some great egg rolls in that thing.

1022
00:49:23,240 --> 00:49:27,160
Dude, the air fryer is one of the things you feel you don't need.

1023
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:31,740
But once you have one lunch, lunch is like a two minute ordeal.

1024
00:49:31,740 --> 00:49:32,740
You know what?

1025
00:49:32,740 --> 00:49:33,740
I don't even need a deep fryer anymore.

1026
00:49:33,740 --> 00:49:36,000
I got a deep fryer and I'm not even going to use it anymore.

1027
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:37,000
You have a deep fryer?

1028
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:38,000
Yeah.

1029
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:39,000
Oh, yeah.

1030
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:40,000
What kind of oil do you use?

1031
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:41,000
Peanut oil whenever I can.

1032
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:42,000
Yeah.

1033
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:43,000
I just got a wild hair one time.

1034
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:44,640
I was like, I want to get a nice deep fryer.

1035
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:48,540
And I got one and then it made the entire place stink so bad that I don't really want

1036
00:49:48,540 --> 00:49:49,540
to use it.

1037
00:49:49,540 --> 00:49:51,360
So then I was like, I'm going to get an air fryer.

1038
00:49:51,360 --> 00:49:54,160
But because I just bought a deep fryer, I can't go buy a new air fryer.

1039
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:56,980
So I have to get a used air fryer.

1040
00:49:56,980 --> 00:49:59,980
So I got myself a used Phillips air fryer.

1041
00:49:59,980 --> 00:50:03,000
And if the damn thing isn't the best thing I ever did for my lunches, I don't know what

1042
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:06,660
is like because I I will always cut my lunches first.

1043
00:50:06,660 --> 00:50:09,100
Like that's the first thing that goes in my day is lunch.

1044
00:50:09,100 --> 00:50:12,900
And then I end up not eating enough and I go on air and I have an energy crash.

1045
00:50:12,900 --> 00:50:18,240
So being able to throw something in that air fryer and have it kind of crunchy and crispy

1046
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:19,920
without all the oil and the stink.

1047
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:20,920
I'm getting hungry.

1048
00:50:20,920 --> 00:50:21,920
I'm going to miss lunch.

1049
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:27,400
It's just I know I did to actually talk about food.

1050
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:30,520
I cut lunch today because I had to get to this spot so we could record.

1051
00:50:30,520 --> 00:50:32,240
So I just drove through lunch.

1052
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:33,240
Damn.

1053
00:50:33,240 --> 00:50:34,240
All right.

1054
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:36,800
Well, let's wrap it up so you and I can go find something to eat.
