00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
This is KOTORadio, episode 387, for November 10th, 2020.

2
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Hello friends and welcome in to Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show, taking a pragmatic look

3
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
at the art and business of software development and the world of technology.

4
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
This episode is brought to you by A Cloud Guru.

5
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:49,000
A Cloud Guru now includes Cloud Playgrounds, Azure AWS, or Google Cloud Playgrounds sound boxes.

6
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
But they're on ACG's credit card, not yours. Get certified, get hired, get learning, acloudguru.com.

7
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
My name is Chris and joining me, like the stream watcher he is, it's our host, Mr. Dominic.

8
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Hello, Mike.

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
How are you holding up, Chris?

10
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm all right. I will admit I have been tempted by the fruit of another today.

11
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Yes. I feel like I got shot in the back with an M1 Grand Classic rifle. See what I did there?

12
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
It was rough, man, because there was a couple of surprises.

13
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
So Mike and I just got done streaming Apple's Mac Arm event.

14
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
It was actually a pretty tight little stream, nice and quick, which is great.

15
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Gives us a little time to record a reaction for the folks out there.

16
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:33,000
You know, and this is something we decided to do today because the tools of the trade are a big part of this show.

17
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,000
So what we're going to do is we're going to hold some of our other topics on the feedback for next week's episode.

18
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
And we're just going to get into it.

19
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:45,000
So with that, I want to just start right now by thanking the people that make this show possible.

20
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
So that way, then for the rest of the show, we just dedicate it to the topic.

21
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,000
So I'll start with Datadog. Datadog is a new sponsor on the Coder Radio program.

22
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
And they're the monitoring analytics platform for cloud scale infrastructure and applications.

23
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:04,000
This is a great solution if you're across multiple providers, if you have on premises and cloud or anything in between.

24
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
You can see inside any stack, any app at any scale anywhere.

25
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Datadog started in 2010 as developers who were having some some friction with system administrators and they thought maybe there'd be a better way to do this.

26
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
We've never heard that problem before. And that's what inspired them to create Datadog.

27
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:27,000
And then what's really nice is just recently they rewrote their agent thing into Go with Go.

28
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,000
And so it's a super quick deploy, low resources, really simple, and you get so much insights.

29
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
So go to datadog.com slash Coder Radio. You can unify your monitoring.

30
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:42,000
You'll get a 14 day trial. And if you set up a dashboard, you get a free T-shirt.

31
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I love free stuff. They have machine based learning alerts, customizable dashboards, of course.

32
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
They'll have 400, more than 400 vendor backed integrations.

33
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
They make it easy to bring in all these different apps, all these different sources of information.

34
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,000
They make it really easy. You can combine these metrics and traces and logs all in one place.

35
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Makes it really easy and straightforward to improve application performance and reliability.

36
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
And they give you observability in the containers as well.

37
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,000
So you can get a real idea of what your Docker containers or other container systems are doing.

38
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Try them for free. Go to datadog.com slash Coder Radio. See how you can unify your monitoring today.

39
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
And set up a dashboard. Try out the agent. Get a free T-shirt.

40
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:29,000
It's datadog.com slash Coder Radio. You go there, support the show, and you get the 14 day free trial.

41
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Also, thanks to Linode. Linode.com slash Coder. Go there for a $100, 60 day free trial.

42
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Now, you can start with Linode for $5 a month. Linode is server infrastructure that's really quick and easy to set up.

43
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:53,000
And if you are a little more advanced or you need something just outside the regular box, they're going to accommodate you.

44
00:03:53,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Unlike lower class entry level services out there that I have tried to save a buck every now and then.

45
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I mean, I am a small business, but every time I came back to Linode.

46
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
And now I've been using them for over just over two years.

47
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:17,000
And just recently I needed to just completely reimage a Linode to a kind of custom vendor Linux.

48
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
You've probably seen these out there before. And they have an actual guide on how to do it.

49
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
They're totally OK with that kind of stuff. So it's a great platform to learn.

50
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:30,000
But they have a ton of just one click deployments as well. And they have other services outside of virtual servers.

51
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
They have S3 compatible object storage. They have load balancers.

52
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:41,000
So if you're looking to game, if you're looking to learn or if you're looking to build a personal site or the back end for your company infrastructure.

53
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Linode can help you. They started in 2003 as one of the first companies in cloud computing.

54
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:51,000
That's three years before AWS. They know how this works and they've made it better and better over time.

55
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Now they have crazy fast network connections, super fast disk, 11 data centers around the world and they're independently owned.

56
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:05,000
So go there. Linode.com slash coder. Get a $100 60 day credit towards a new account and go there to support the show.

57
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Linode.com slash coder. And a big thank you to Linode for sponsoring the show.

58
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
And thank you to everybody who goes out there and tries it out.

59
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I've been hearing from a lot of you who have supported the network and supported Linode by going to Linode.com slash coder.

60
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,000
And now I kind of want to know what you're doing with it. You've been telling me you're doing it.

61
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:27,000
But let me know. Tweet me at Chris LAS or you can let me know in the Jupiter broadcasting telegram group.

62
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:37,000
What are you doing with your Linode? Linode.com slash coder. And a big thanks to Linode for sponsoring Coder Radio program.

63
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Well, Mr. Dominic, where should we even start? Where do we even start? Maybe with just how tight these productions have gotten.

64
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I mean, this thing was like 45, 50 minutes tops. I mean, it was really quick.

65
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,000
It was quick and brutal. Yeah. Yeah, you're right.

66
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I mean, I was predicting that it would be a bloodbath, but they were though.

67
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I mean, the entire time they were make they were making claims six times faster than the leading the leading comparable PC, five times faster than this.

68
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Eleven times faster than that. I actually wrote these down. These are the claims they were making the entire time.

69
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:22,000
They never once gave us CPU clock speed ever. They would say things like eight cores, which is impressive.

70
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
But they never said what speed those cores are running at.

71
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:33,000
And they never really said much beyond the memory system, other than it's a unified architecture as well, which that's a huge change for the Mac.

72
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
That is not how it is traditionally done on the X86 platform.

73
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:44,000
And I got to imagine it means no third party GPUs. And it's going to eliminate certain types of PCI cards, too, I think.

74
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:49,000
So I think maybe it's good to like what did they gain? Right. Tons of speed, tons of performance.

75
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:55,000
And they could go fanless in the air, which, you know, as they will tell you all the time, the errors are best selling unit.

76
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,000
So I'm sure that's a big win. But I think they lost boot camp.

77
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Right. Yes. Although they claim to have improved virtualization greatly.

78
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:12,000
In fact, emulation, they say in some cases is faster than it would have been on X86 with certain types of GPUs and whatnot.

79
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
That's a remarkable claim there.

80
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:21,000
They they essentially waited until these CPUs were in a state where they could actually shame Intel.

81
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,000
They were essentially shaming Intel with the PC guy coming on at the end.

82
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:35,000
They're claiming that Photoshop and some Photoshop filters work better and faster on our Macs using emulation than using the native X86 version.

83
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:42,000
And they're claiming virtualization is just off the charts, too, although we didn't see much in the way of that in the presentation.

84
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:51,000
First of all, do we believe the claims? I think so, because I do, too, because they got to they got to define the terms and the ground rules a little bit.

85
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,000
So in in the in the ground rules they laid out, I think they can be very competitive there.

86
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Yeah. In particular, they kept talking about machine learning, but it's pretty obvious that they mean their machine learning solution core ML, right?

87
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Not the more common solution, TensorFlow or any of the other alternatives out there.

88
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Yeah, that's one of the things that's becoming more of an issue with Apple is you kind of have to parse their language.

89
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Machine learning absolutely is not machine learning as we know it. It's core ML.

90
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
And perhaps there's easy ways to translate between them. I don't know.

91
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Maybe somebody will create one now. Going back to the unified memory architecture.

92
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I also wonder what this means for eGPUs is just somebody who employs that pretty heavily for my video editing.

93
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I think you're in trouble, right? I think the GPUs are. How would that work?

94
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I don't know. They said, quote, jaw dropping performance a couple of times.

95
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I mean, these claims are pretty big. But you know what I was surprised by the most was the Mac Mini.

96
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Yes. Didn't nobody nobody really talked about that.

97
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,000
But it was so obvious in retrospect because they already had the dev machines.

98
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:52,000
So just refine that. Right. Just make it prettier and give it more memory and a better CPU.

99
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:57,000
And it's got a sting right to be Intel right now.

100
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Yeah, because really like there's some impressive stuff in these ARM chips.

101
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,000
But this is also this is not just a story of Apple kind of trying thing here.

102
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,000
This is a story of Intel just losing. And for reasons that make a ton of sense.

103
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Right. Like, you know, the nanometer, the die set shrink, the nanometer shrink is a bet they made on how they could do it.

104
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:21,000
And they never quite got it right. Yeah. These are five nanometer chips.

105
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Right. And Apple happened to get it right because they were used to, you know, they brought their technology up from a phone where Intel was trying to always go down from, you know, giant Xeons.

106
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Right. Mm hmm. True. What does this mean for like, you know, the savage dunk on basically the tell XPS 13.

107
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:46,000
All right. Like they also had a they had an HP workstation up on screen that they were kind of name and shaming a little bit, too.

108
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
And it was like, you know, more professional grade workstation.

109
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Let's not forget, it's also going to trounce all their other laptops, too, and probably most consumer grade IMAX.

110
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Yeah. Yeah. They also announced the new MacBook Air and MacBook Pro 13. A couple of things that is, I think, going to be a big deal for people that are buying these is it looks like across the line, everything got better video cameras.

111
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:19,000
They're starting to use maybe the front facing iPhone camera. And they have at least in the MacBook Pro 13, they have the new studio grade mics, as they call them.

112
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:25,000
But they're, you know, great mics for a video conference, bad mics for recording a podcast. And they're building that in now.

113
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:32,000
That's that's compelling to see. The Mac Mini started at six ninety nine. The others kind of are at the same price.

114
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:43,000
So the Mac Mini got a hundred dollar price reduction there. Also interesting to note, Apple is still selling the three gigahertz core i5 six core Intel version of the Mac Mini.

115
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:50,000
The only Intel version, they only have one Intel version Mac Mini available for sale now. And it's it's basically twelve hundred dollars.

116
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:57,000
The Mac Mini base six ninety nine, but then upgraded to five hundred and twelve gigabytes of storage.

117
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:03,000
It is eight ninety nine. Of course, you'd want to then also pop that thing up to the Mac 16 gigs of RAM.

118
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:09,000
So if you go with 16 gigs of what they call unified RAM and then you can go up to two terabytes of storage.

119
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:15,000
So say you put two terabytes of storage in this thing, you end up with a seventeen hundred dollar Mac Mini.

120
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:20,000
That's what the real price is. If you wanted to actually use this as a workstation, you might be able to get away with a terabyte.

121
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:26,000
So if you if you're OK with living with a terabyte, that knocks four hundred dollars off. And now it's a thirteen hundred dollar workstation.

122
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:35,000
That's that's compelling. Yeah. If the performance claims are what they claimed, then this thing is probably faster than the iMac Pro.

123
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:41,000
It's it's probably up there, right? It's it's maybe competitive with the Mac Pro if their claims are true.

124
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,000
That's amazing. Eight cores, too. I just you know, the claims are bold, right?

125
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:57,000
I keep hesitating on some of these claims because is it going to be it's great if your application is written natively for iOS or Mac OS.

126
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:02,000
What about like giant Java apps like all the JetBrains suite? Right. Yeah.

127
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:07,000
They showed some complex applications running under Rosetta, too. No, it's true. Right.

128
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:14,000
So it's possible. The other thing that I noticed that they're doing now is they're using active cooling as a feature.

129
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:21,000
So what they have up on they'll have like, you know, when they have all of the features that are available, one of them now is active cooling.

130
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:27,000
So when they have a Mac, they've had to put a fan in. They list it as a feature, which is pretty clever.

131
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:33,000
But I think it's their way of saying we've clocked the CPU up without actually having to talk about the CPU speeds,

132
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:37,000
because they specifically called that out in the mini, too, that because it has active cooling, we're running the chip faster.

133
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:42,000
But they didn't say how much faster. So what do you think this means for everybody else?

134
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:51,000
It's all going to be in the performance. If the performance is as good or perhaps maybe even better in edge cases than they claimed on stage,

135
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:59,000
then the industry has to respond if it is better only in the scenarios in which they have defined and otherwise it is it is worse.

136
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Like here's a scenario I could see easily being a problem is perhaps emulating Intel software means you have to run the GPU and CPU at a pretty high clip.

137
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:20,000
And so these claims of battery life that they're promising completely fall through because they depend on using the lower power CPU cores, which maybe you can't do with emulation.

138
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Right. And so if you're running an X86 upload, you basically get the battery life that you would have gotten on a regular Intel MacBook with maybe some performance improvements in some areas and probably some losses in other areas.

139
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:43,000
And I expect that to be the actual experience until you open up something like Safari or photos or some other Apple application.

140
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
And the thing just screams in those circumstances.

141
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:55,000
That's my concern. If you're not completely committed to the Apple tool chain, that you may lose many of the advantages of this this new engineering.

142
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:02,000
They did kind of more than once in different ways, but one one time directly call out performance gains for Xcode.

143
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Well, you know, you picked the low hanging fruit.

144
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
No, I mean, it's true. There's a lot of room to improve.

145
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Right. It's what I want to see is like can, you know, young designer just starting out, pick up a 13 inch MacBook Pro and realistically work in Photoshop and Illustrator for a couple of years.

146
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Yeah. What I want to know is how how will industry applications and plug in developers respond?

147
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:41,000
So like here at JB, every now and then we throw something over on the Mac load and there's this company called Isotope who makes just these world renowned audio fixing tools.

148
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:45,000
You know, like maybe we have a guest that just has this horrendously bad audio.

149
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:50,000
And to air it, we have to run it through these really specialized tools that radio stations use and whatnot.

150
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:55,000
So that these tools are exact. In fact, I was just looking at one today.

151
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:04,000
It's a tool that can clean up audio that has cracks and and pops in it so it can actually go through and try to remove some of the pops and clips.

152
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:14,000
But it also will help reduce the like if you have a host who is breathing too much into the microphone like that, it can go through and clean that up.

153
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:21,000
And I was just looking at the price of it. It's it's a it's an eleven hundred dollar, twelve hundred dollar software pack.

154
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:28,000
And it very much depends on acceleration. And I just don't know what something like that is going to is going to run like on an ARM Mac.

155
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:33,000
And I don't know what to expect for these plug in developers for Final Cut and Logic and the Adobe Suite.

156
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:38,000
I don't know what to expect from them because in some cases they're dependent on Adobe.

157
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:44,000
In other cases, it's you know, it's a real bounce for them because they have Windows users and that's going to require some big code changes.

158
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:49,000
And there's it's a complicated story for them. And that's going to define how useful this transition is.

159
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:57,000
If it's one of these things where you could say buy a Mac Mini, set yourself up an eight core ARM workstation that is killer fast.

160
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:01,000
And over the next six months, everything just starts kind of trickling through the app store.

161
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:07,000
And you've got these updates that make these applications work great on ARM and give you all these benefits.

162
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:12,000
And it's, you know, happening pretty quick. I think I think it could be pretty smooth.

163
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,000
You know, I could see certain types of users who don't need a lot. Maybe they need a machine for school.

164
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:21,000
They want to play some video games. Now, now this Mac Mini could do something it couldn't do before and play.

165
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:29,000
It can play some video games. The problem I'm going to see here is they said at the beginning of this thing, right off the bat, it's a two year transition.

166
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Yes, it's a two year transition. Here's a couple of machines.

167
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:42,000
So the Mac Pro, the iMac Pro, the stuff that drives the professional industry that's going to force professional software developers to update their applications is going to lag the most.

168
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:52,000
And that's going to make it, I think, a trickier transition for those using it in industrial grade applications like like video editing shops and audio editing shops.

169
00:16:52,000 --> 00:17:00,000
But for end users that don't use those tools or perhaps even for developers that are today primarily just target iOS.

170
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:07,000
That was one of the emails we got in is Patrick writes and he says, Hey, guys, I love the show, but I think you missed the mark a little bit with your Apple developer critique.

171
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:12,000
What you said applies really only if you're a developer targeting cloud and Linux servers, which I think is a huge market.

172
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:18,000
He goes on to say, But if you're making mobile apps or doing web development, Mac OS is still the best platform to be on.

173
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:24,000
I'm in the mobile and web development world and there's no way I could switch to Ubuntu or Windows.

174
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,000
It's not just because of iOS apps can only be built on Mac OS.

175
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
I think it's also with the ARM transition.

176
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:35,000
They're going to submit Mac OS as the premier mobile web development platform with a workable server dev platform.

177
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
That's my two cents, Patrick.

178
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:41,000
He says, By the way, I'm a dev in Germany who uses who doesn't use Seuss at all.

179
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
I know it's weird, but there are a couple of us out here.

180
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:48,000
We have your IP address. Don't worry. I love that.

181
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:56,000
So Patrick says, you know, this mobile and web people who are making mobile applications for iOS and web apps possibly, but maybe not even that.

182
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,000
It's still a ginormous market and there's still nothing that serves them.

183
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
I know you fought this battle yourself.

184
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Yeah, I mean, so there's no two ways about it, right?

185
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:20,000
The case against Macs as dev stations for folks doing like web development and not like the nitty gritty like we're setting up a data center thing to either switch them to Windows or Linux just became a hell of a lot harder.

186
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Right. If you're just doing straight rails development or straight Python development or PHP, whatever, I guess PHP if you hate yourself.

187
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Yeah, I mean, I think a large part of the switcher case just got shot in the face.

188
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
I don't even know how else to put it.

189
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,000
I don't really have much more, but I do have one last question for you.

190
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Do you think realistically something was presented to you today that you are interested in purchasing to add to your tool set here?

191
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Because I know you're hoping for potentially more battery life.

192
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:54,000
They did claim on the 13 inch and certain workloads you could get up to 20 hours of battery life.

193
00:18:54,000 --> 00:19:00,000
But that's like watching a video that they present something that you think is worth busting out the wallet for.

194
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
So I want to hear what you think I'm going to say.

195
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:07,000
I mean, I think it I think it depends on it's always going to depend on what your current workload is.

196
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:12,000
And if you have to target iOS or Mac at all, is that the case at the moment?

197
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:19,000
I wouldn't say at all. Well, there is like maintenance stuff, but not nothing new at the moment.

198
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Sure, sure. I'm going to say no, then that is the correct answer.

199
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,000
No, really. So I'll tell you why.

200
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Now, if I know and I'll tell you what I would get if I was going to get something, the if I did it one,

201
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:39,000
the majority of the engineering work we're doing is very is going to be in Q1, very TensorFlow focused.

202
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Yep. And that's why I kept harping on it. Well, when they say ML, right, what do they mean?

203
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Yep. Also, like, you know, there's the practical. Hey, we're setting up a data center. You know, it's expensive, right?

204
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Don't want to spend money if I don't have to. And honestly, it's not enough of a improvement.

205
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Like my right now, my core problem is not that like my desk workstations or my employees workstations are not fast enough.

206
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:16,000
It's how do we architect these solutions in ways that are, you know, sustainable, that we can predict the development pace, things like that.

207
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Having said that, do I potentially see a gen two in my future or if like, I don't know, my laptop got smashed?

208
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Do I maybe see one in my future? Possibly. Right. But right now, I probably would not get one or I'm not going to get one.

209
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:40,000
And I don't I didn't see enough to compel me to get one. Right. I don't need the 18 hour battery life because there's no traveling right now.

210
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:47,000
And I don't need I don't have a Mac app that I'm supporting that I would be afraid that like I have to get an arm back.

211
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:53,000
So somebody got this in their hands and they wrote up a post that said, you know, Xcode is just next level.

212
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:59,000
These tools are so much faster. My bill times are so much faster the day because they also mentioned that the SSDs are significantly faster.

213
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Twice the performance they claimed. And that's remarkable because I already think the MacBooks were first in class in SSD performance with the T2 chip.

214
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:12,000
But they're claiming even faster disk performance now. They're claiming even faster CPU performance.

215
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:17,000
What if the reviews come back and they're like, this is the fastest computer I've ever I've ever owned.

216
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:25,000
And it's a tiny MacBook Air. That's super compelling. Right. So you could see how you'd add it to your list in the future as possible considerations.

217
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:30,000
We have some customers that like have some legacy Mac stuff we support for them.

218
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:35,000
And I guess I could see a world if they like switched overnight and all of a sudden our stuff wouldn't run.

219
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:39,000
But these are line of business applications. So the Rosetta is just going to work.

220
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Yeah. Yeah. There's that. You may not even be compelled to have to update them.

221
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Who knows? Right. Although I'm sure eventually they'll phase out Rosetta. But it'll be years.

222
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Years. Right. I mean, these are old Objective C apps. They're not going anywhere.

223
00:21:50,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Yeah. I, like yourself, am not necessarily compelled to buy one. What surprised me was the Mac Mini because I could see a world where I have two workstations upstairs.

224
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:08,000
And I could see a world where I take my Linux laptop out and I just put in a permanent Mac Mini.

225
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:14,000
And that's where I do all my video projects. But truth be told is I've I don't really have any current video projects.

226
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:20,000
And I think it's best for me to wait and see how the applications on that side pan out for a bit.

227
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:27,000
It's nice to see Apple have a machine that is $699 or let's say $700, which is just well below a grand.

228
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:34,000
You know, it's for them. It's a compelling price point. I mean, I'd love to see it at $499, of course, but that's never going to happen.

229
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:39,000
And so that I think I tip the hat to them on that. I think that I think they nailed it with the Mac Mini.

230
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:45,000
They've created a machine that is at a very competitive price point for Apple and where they compete.

231
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:50,000
And it, if I was going to get one, would probably be the one for me right now.

232
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:55,000
That's that looks like a pretty nice machine to get in. Just take advantage of the setup I already have.

233
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:00,000
I've got a keyboard and a mouse for my RSI. I've got some 2K displays that I'm very happy with.

234
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:05,000
And I could just rock up and roll. I'd be curious to see if it works with Thunderbolt docks and all of that.

235
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Yeah, but just for me, not in a place right now where I need it.

236
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Macs fall in very, very squarely into the tool category for me.

237
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:22,000
I buy them occasionally and I buy them as production tools because there are two options for some of these applications.

238
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Like I was talking about earlier, Windows or Mac OS. And I just am not particularly fond of Windows.

239
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:33,000
And I'm just not I don't enjoy using it at all. So I'm going to get a Mac, but I'm just not in that spot yet.

240
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:38,000
My apps have to get switched over. Yeah, I think the Mac mini is the runaway here.

241
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:45,000
It does create a concern as someone who actually thinks the iMac Pro is a very good like high end developer workstation.

242
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:54,000
No monitor, no monitor. And I don't. So like you have the Mac Pro, which I know a lot of people were saying, oh, well, there's going to be a, you know, to quote Syracuse, a stripper model.

243
00:23:54,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Right. Not strippers as in dancers, but strippers as in, you know, like a down down market.

244
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:09,000
All they have to do is take the iMac screen and put it in a stand, you know, so you don't have to go buy like these like the LG one, which is not a super bad looking monitor.

245
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,000
But remember how it was not properly shielded and it was creating Wi-Fi.

246
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Yeah, I had I had one of those. They had to replace it like screws up your Wi-Fi.

247
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Yeah. Uh-huh. No, I think the I think what's going to happen is and especially how they were showing the Mac media being used is that they think that they probably aren't going to.

248
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:31,000
So this is my bacon. I'm pretty sure there's not going to be another iMac Pro.

249
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Right. And the the like developer, you know, you're a pro, but you're not Pixar high end machine is just going to be a souped up version of the Mac mini next year.

250
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Or I mean, if if they if they're getting this kind of performance gains in the MacBook Air, if they if when the M2 comes along and they put that in the iMac, because you can see how this is going to go right.

251
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:56,000
And two will be the next wave and everything that's on the M1 gets the upgrade. And then when they do the M3, it'll be the next wave of Max.

252
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:03,000
So the M2 is probably going to be the iMac and it's probably going to just outstrip the iMac Pro in every regard and be quieter.

253
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,000
And you could totally see them just saying, we're kind of done with the iMac Pro.

254
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:10,000
This is so much faster. And you have, you know, X, Y, Z improvements.

255
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:15,000
Just use this and the iMac Pro dies as a weird one off.

256
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:19,000
Right. Because they've never even revved it, have they? They've revved the GPUs.

257
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:25,000
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But yeah, I think the iMac Pro is going to die because remember, the iMac Pro was meant to be the Mac Pro.

258
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Yeah. And then they had the scramble. And then they realized, oh, oh, people out there use Max.

259
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Oh, right. So I think the iMac Pro is just like, unfortunately, a victim of really a product that.

260
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:46,000
I'm sorry, baby, I love you. But a product that doesn't make sense anymore. Right. It's it's not forward looking.

261
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:54,000
If you really need top performance and like and you are Pixar, you probably want upgradeability and you're probably your budget is probably just dramatically higher.

262
00:25:54,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Right. You can spec a Mac Pro to be a Ferrari. Then you're on the Mac Pro and you don't care.

263
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,000
This is just a thing you buy. Right. You're used to spending 20 grand on monitors.

264
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Yeah. If you're a developer, I mean, realistically, when the 16 inch or 15 inch MacBook Pro comes out,

265
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:18,000
if Apple ever gets off their butt and makes an Apple cinema display again, that probably that or the Mac Mini become the ideal like higher end to your,

266
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:23,000
you know, your mic or your Marco and you just like would rather have a better machine.

267
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:26,000
That probably is it. Yeah. I mean, they can do whatever they want.

268
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:34,000
But I don't I don't see a reason to keep the iMac Pro going when I'm pretty sure there's going to be some very depressing benchmarks on my model iMac Pro.

269
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:39,000
Yes. Versus like, you know, the 13 inch MacBook Pro.

270
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:44,000
I think the people who are probably going to really be sore the most, though, are people who bought the MacBook Pro 16.

271
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:49,000
Not that they didn't know it was coming. But, you know, that's a higher end on the MacBook Pro line.

272
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:56,000
And these, you know, the 13s could if what they claim is true in the keynote could trounce it. We'll see.

273
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:03,000
I would be surprised if they didn't. I mean, I think we're going to see benchmarks where the Mac Minis actually trounce the iMac Pro, at least the base models.

274
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Usually when Apple fronts and flexes this much, they tend to deliver because they they're they don't want to be embarrassed and called out, you know?

275
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:16,000
Yeah. I mean, they're still going to have the problem of like this super I mean, I think I hope I hope I'm wrong, actually.

276
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:21,000
But I think they still super optimized for their own stuff a little too much.

277
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:32,000
Yeah. The very last thing is we begin to wrap up. I think it's worth sort of zooming out and appreciating how careful and planned out this transition has been.

278
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:38,000
I think it probably started when they started limiting MacBooks to USBC is when they probably started this transition.

279
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:46,000
And if you look at all of the things they've carefully been putting in place in terms of UI kit replacement,

280
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:54,000
but also just in terms of the way they have been developing Macs for a while and the features they've been bringing into Mac OS

281
00:27:54,000 --> 00:28:07,000
and the way they've been sort of positioning everyone to get ready for this for years now has resulted in them being able to announce these things today and ship them next week.

282
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:15,000
And shame Intel in the performance department when they do it, not just be competitive or maybe slightly slower, but we're going to get there, guys.

283
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:23,000
This is a transition. Nope. Shame them and ship them that shame and ship the orders are up right now.

284
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:35,000
They nailed this thing. They nailed this so hard that I think somebody should write up a history lesson on this because this is they are the king of platform transitions.

285
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:42,000
And when you look back at it, you can see so many little pieces have been have been put into place to make this possible.

286
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:46,000
And you got to tip the hat at them for that. So, yeah, that's worth noting. Yeah, absolutely.

287
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:50,000
I want to say thank you to our Coder QA team. Thank you for supporting the show.

288
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:55,000
You get a limited ad feed as an option and you get the Coderly report every quarter when it comes out.

289
00:28:55,000 --> 00:29:02,000
Just go to Coder QA. Also, I want to mention our sponsor, Cloud Guru, has running Linux servers on Azure.

290
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,000
If this is something you've been interested in, take a look at this. We'll have a link in the show notes.

291
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:12,000
This course is going to provide you with an understanding of Linux on Azure and a practical hands on experience performing key configuration and management tasks.

292
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:20,000
You just start with the basics and by the end of the course, you'll be comfortable planning, deploying and maintaining Linux virtual machines on Azure.

293
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:26,000
You can get started with the link in our show notes. Just go to Coder dot show slash three eight seven.

294
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,000
Mr. Dominic, is there anything else you want to mention before we get out of here?

295
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:33,000
No. Try to resist the urge to buy an ARM Mac, I guess.

296
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:37,000
And if you do get one, write in and tell us your impressions, right?

297
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,000
That's right. That's right.

298
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
We'll live through you vicariously. Coder dot show slash contact.

299
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:45,000
Also, a big shout out to everyone in the chat room and watching us on the live stream.

300
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:50,000
We've been going for over two hours. We got kicked off of YouTube early on and we're still rocking it.

301
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,000
So thank you, everybody. You can join us live at ShabyLive.TV.
