00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
This is KOTORadio, episode 380 for September 21st, 2020.

00:31.000 --> 00:35.720
Hello friends, and welcome to Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show, taking a pragmatic look

00:35.720 --> 00:40.420
at the art and business of software development and the world of technology.

00:40.420 --> 00:44.960
This episode is brought to you by a Cloud Guru, the leader in hands-on training.

00:44.960 --> 00:47.580
The only way to really learn and lock in a new skill is by doing.

00:47.580 --> 00:51.480
That's why ACG provides hands-on labs, cloud Linux servers, and much more.

00:51.480 --> 00:54.460
Get your hands cloudy at acloudguru.com.

00:54.460 --> 01:00.880
My name is Chris, and joining me every single week is our man stationed in Florida.

01:00.880 --> 01:03.640
The developer from down under, it is Mr. Dominic.

01:03.640 --> 01:05.520
How's it going down there, Mr. Dominic?

01:05.520 --> 01:08.140
Top of the morning to you, top of the morning to you.

01:08.140 --> 01:09.640
Top of the afternoon to you, sir.

01:09.640 --> 01:10.640
Top of the afternoon.

01:10.640 --> 01:11.640
Yeah.

01:11.640 --> 01:14.720
We have a time zone difference, and you'd think three hours is not really a big deal,

01:14.720 --> 01:18.520
but like that's an entire different phase of your day.

01:18.520 --> 01:20.360
You know, you're like, you're going into the evening.

01:20.360 --> 01:21.640
I haven't even had lunch yet.

01:21.640 --> 01:22.640
Yes.

01:22.640 --> 01:23.640
Yeah.

01:23.640 --> 01:27.360
It's weird how, but yet you think three hours, that's no big deal.

01:27.360 --> 01:32.280
And over here on the West Coast, I can say it, it does feel like a good portion of the

01:32.280 --> 01:35.240
entire country just runs off of East Coast time.

01:35.240 --> 01:40.840
I feel like every meeting I set up, I actually go into that email exchange just knowing that

01:40.840 --> 01:44.360
they're on the East Coast and just go with East Coast time.

01:44.360 --> 01:49.300
It's like, it plagues us over on the West Coast.

01:49.300 --> 01:51.680
So how has things been since we gathered together?

01:51.680 --> 01:52.680
Good, good.

01:52.680 --> 01:53.680
Yeah.

01:53.680 --> 01:54.680
You know, just coding.

01:54.680 --> 01:55.680
Sleeping.

01:55.680 --> 01:56.680
Coding, sleeping.

01:56.680 --> 01:57.680
Good.

01:57.680 --> 01:58.680
Are you sleeping?

01:58.680 --> 01:59.680
Yeah.

01:59.680 --> 02:00.680
Are you getting your sleep?

02:00.680 --> 02:01.680
I sleep a lot now.

02:01.680 --> 02:02.680
Are you drinking your water?

02:02.680 --> 02:03.680
I have my water today.

02:03.680 --> 02:04.680
I have coffee.

02:04.680 --> 02:07.840
Oh, well now you know that can dehydrate you, so I want you to drink your water.

02:07.840 --> 02:10.440
This is like a physical, what do they call that?

02:10.440 --> 02:11.800
Physical therapy session, right?

02:11.800 --> 02:12.800
You got to stretch.

02:12.800 --> 02:13.800
You got to stretch every morning.

02:13.800 --> 02:14.800
Do your yoga.

02:14.800 --> 02:15.800
Yeah.

02:15.800 --> 02:16.800
Right.

02:16.800 --> 02:18.520
I call it Chris Plus Fitness, and it's $9.99 a month, and I just check in with you once

02:18.520 --> 02:19.520
a week.

02:19.520 --> 02:22.840
You're going to get some really crappy TV shows with it.

02:22.840 --> 02:27.000
You just get this voice call, and because I'm a cheapskate, I just lump it in with our

02:27.000 --> 02:31.440
show, but I do charge you for it, so good for me.

02:31.440 --> 02:33.200
That sounds oddly familiar.

02:33.200 --> 02:35.240
I'm just trying to bring up my services revenue.

02:35.240 --> 02:36.240
You understand.

02:36.240 --> 02:40.040
Well, you do get a better multiple on your stock price for services revenue.

02:40.040 --> 02:42.840
That's for sure, and it seems like Wall Street loves it.

02:42.840 --> 02:45.960
Just like the audiences loved our feedback forum this week.

02:45.960 --> 02:48.920
We got some great feedback, and Mike and I love this.

02:48.920 --> 02:52.560
I'd love to have a problem where some weeks the entire show is feedback, because it not

02:52.560 --> 02:57.480
only gives us a signal of what the audience is interested in, which is rewarding for us,

02:57.480 --> 03:02.180
but it also often leads to conversations that we never even conceived before we sat down

03:02.180 --> 03:03.180
to record.

03:03.180 --> 03:07.560
So please do go to coder.show slash contact, or you can just email... Yeah, I think it's

03:07.560 --> 03:09.520
just coder at jupiterbroadcasting.com.

03:09.520 --> 03:13.600
The safest bet is to use the contact form, because then it goes to all the right places.

03:13.600 --> 03:27.840
There's also the Twitter, which is how Ito... Boy, this is... Ito... I don't know on

03:27.840 --> 03:28.840
that one.

03:28.840 --> 03:32.220
But he says, hey guys, will Coder Radio bring back the sound board?

03:32.220 --> 03:36.120
Last episode I heard a get it out of here and a business mentioned, but they weren't

03:36.120 --> 03:37.920
played in the show.

03:37.920 --> 03:38.920
I don't believe you.

03:38.920 --> 03:41.000
No, I don't know about that.

03:41.000 --> 03:44.520
Whenever we talk about business, we often use the sound board.

03:44.520 --> 03:48.380
But we don't want it to be inappropriate, because then it sort of dominates the show

03:48.380 --> 03:50.240
the entire time.

03:50.240 --> 03:53.960
And like we always say, you don't want to over dominate the show.

03:53.960 --> 03:54.960
Wes was right.

03:54.960 --> 03:55.960
Wes was right.

03:55.960 --> 03:56.960
You don't want it to do that.

03:56.960 --> 03:57.960
So it's sparingly.

03:57.960 --> 04:01.600
We don't want it to be a morning DJ drive, but it is there.

04:01.600 --> 04:03.160
Get out of here.

04:03.160 --> 04:09.280
That was just an amazing pastiche of me being a jackass, except you missed that he's a jackass

04:09.280 --> 04:10.280
one.

04:10.280 --> 04:11.280
Oh, right.

04:11.280 --> 04:12.520
We do have that, don't we?

04:12.520 --> 04:17.520
I don't even know if I, I know I have this one, but I don't know if I kept the other

04:17.520 --> 04:19.240
one for some reason.

04:19.240 --> 04:22.160
There's a couple we've retired over the years.

04:22.160 --> 04:24.720
You know, like we retired the RMS clips too.

04:24.720 --> 04:28.840
It just didn't seem like it was, you know, hip anymore to really be playing those.

04:28.840 --> 04:31.520
And so yeah, there has been some that come and go.

04:31.520 --> 04:33.180
The sound board is a living beast.

04:33.180 --> 04:34.180
That is for sure.

04:34.180 --> 04:35.640
So we continue on with the feedback.

04:35.640 --> 04:40.160
Kevin writes in about OpenSusa and I, I don't know, maybe we touched on a nerve here.

04:40.160 --> 04:46.600
He writes, Mike, I don't know if I can actually read what he says there, but let's just say

04:46.600 --> 04:53.960
he implies that you are familiar with many ladies and men and gentlemen, and that while

04:53.960 --> 05:01.640
Red Hat is a 1000 pound gorilla, Seuss in Kevin's opinion is a solid number two in revenue,

05:01.640 --> 05:03.960
1500 employees and profitable.

05:03.960 --> 05:04.960
Why?

05:04.960 --> 05:09.320
SAP certifies their ERP on Seuss and on Windows.

05:09.320 --> 05:13.560
So thousands of SAP deployments run Seuss on premises and in cloud.

05:13.560 --> 05:17.800
There's a reason the former SAP ops manager runs Seuss as a CEO.

05:17.800 --> 05:24.120
And once an enterprise has a little Seuss managed by a Seuss manager or maybe some salt,

05:24.120 --> 05:27.340
enterprises figure out how they can manage their Ubuntu and Red Hat sprawl just as nicely

05:27.340 --> 05:28.560
as they manage Seuss.

05:28.560 --> 05:32.600
They essentially copied Ubuntu now with free leap code and paid support.

05:32.600 --> 05:34.720
You know, Ubuntu is essentially copying Seuss.

05:34.720 --> 05:39.220
And finally, they have a very nice container play with the rancher acquisition that's integrating

05:39.220 --> 05:42.480
with Seuss's existing container sets right now.

05:42.480 --> 05:43.480
Seuss is relevant.

05:43.480 --> 05:44.880
They are very open.

05:44.880 --> 05:47.680
They contribute lots of real code and they do innovate.

05:47.680 --> 05:49.200
They're not going away.

05:49.200 --> 05:54.600
Ubuntu may have a significant market share, but it's at the cost of revenue.

05:54.600 --> 05:59.560
Again in Kevin's opinion, they continue to try and figure out how to make real money.

05:59.560 --> 06:04.360
They obviously haven't yet or Shuttleworth would have flipped it long before now.

06:04.360 --> 06:07.640
So Mike, I think we touched on a nerve with open Seuss.

06:07.640 --> 06:12.040
I disagree with everything in this email.

06:12.040 --> 06:15.480
So I'll wait to go because I don't want to dominate the response, but what are your thoughts

06:15.480 --> 06:16.480
when you saw this?

06:16.480 --> 06:19.740
Did it give you some perspective on the market that Seuss serves?

06:19.740 --> 06:24.720
So I actually just had a conversation with someone from the Seuss manager project over

06:24.720 --> 06:25.720
at Seuss.

06:25.720 --> 06:30.360
Seuss, it is not called Seuss as I was corrected.

06:30.360 --> 06:34.680
I actually have a customer using it right now, Seuss enterprise, I'm going to do that

06:34.680 --> 06:37.840
every time because I can't help myself.

06:37.840 --> 06:39.360
And yeah, I have not seen it.

06:39.360 --> 06:45.720
Like when I do nothing with SAP, so maybe it is huge in SAP, but it does have market

06:45.720 --> 06:52.000
share, but only in like super, it's like Germany and regulated market, regulated verticals,

06:52.000 --> 06:53.000
right?

06:53.000 --> 06:54.000
Yeah.

06:54.000 --> 06:55.000
You need to have that contract to satisfy.

06:55.000 --> 06:57.560
There's a bunch of like government regulations.

06:57.560 --> 06:59.760
I don't know.

06:59.760 --> 07:00.760
It's definitely a spicy email.

07:00.760 --> 07:07.760
I mean, he makes a point, Seuss and Gano, man, it's killing me.

07:07.760 --> 07:08.760
Welcome to my world.

07:08.760 --> 07:09.760
Yeah.

07:09.760 --> 07:10.760
It's definitely got some market share.

07:10.760 --> 07:16.120
I don't know that I'm interested in getting into a disreward because Linux is like 1% of

07:16.120 --> 07:17.120
the desktop market, right?

07:17.120 --> 07:18.820
So let's not kill ourselves here.

07:18.820 --> 07:24.600
And I understand we're primarily talking about servers, but yeah, if it works, I still wouldn't

07:24.600 --> 07:25.600
pick it voluntarily.

07:25.600 --> 07:26.600
I'm sorry.

07:26.600 --> 07:27.600
Yeah.

07:27.600 --> 07:34.000
I've always kind of held back on my criticism because I respect the engineers at Seuss and

07:34.000 --> 07:37.560
the developers who contribute to it and the community.

07:37.560 --> 07:39.560
And I think they have a lot of innovative ideas.

07:39.560 --> 07:45.600
I think they've been at the forefront of a lot of simplification via Yast and I applaud

07:45.600 --> 07:51.600
them for a lot of the things they've done that when I use Seuss or open Seuss, I feel

07:51.600 --> 07:55.360
like these are unique and they're special.

07:55.360 --> 08:01.520
And I always come across something like these clever, clever bastards, but like yourself,

08:01.520 --> 08:03.920
I don't like using it.

08:03.920 --> 08:09.360
And I have used it in production, the enterprise version, the supported version.

08:09.360 --> 08:12.240
And I had numerous issues with it.

08:12.240 --> 08:17.440
What I find happens here from people who are big into the open Seuss side of things is

08:17.440 --> 08:21.800
they kind of delude themselves a little bit and kind of hand wave away things that really

08:21.800 --> 08:22.800
matter.

08:22.800 --> 08:24.800
1500 employees and profitable.

08:24.800 --> 08:28.720
Yeah, but not so profitable that they haven't been sold half a dozen times in just as many

08:28.720 --> 08:37.400
years and justifying its relevancy because it's required to use SAP doesn't really speak

08:37.400 --> 08:41.820
to the same level of engagement that other distributions get because people are voluntarily

08:41.820 --> 08:44.220
installing them and choosing to run them.

08:44.220 --> 08:49.240
I grant you that you can manage a Seuss or open Seuss or whatever with the same kind

08:49.240 --> 08:51.840
of tools you could manage other Linux boxes.

08:51.840 --> 08:58.840
But the Seuss boxes will always be the exception because they do things just a little bit differently,

08:58.840 --> 09:04.320
a little differently, like Slackware did them, and they kind of branched off from a different

09:04.320 --> 09:10.360
technology point in Linux history and have kept some of that uniqueness that, in my opinion,

09:10.360 --> 09:15.080
when you have two dominant players, Ubuntu and Red Hat, it makes Seuss of the oddball

09:15.080 --> 09:16.080
out.

09:16.080 --> 09:20.260
Now, true, they've made a recent play towards containers.

09:20.260 --> 09:24.520
He mentions the rancher acquisition, I would argue 10 years too late.

09:24.520 --> 09:27.040
I would argue at minimum five years too late.

09:27.040 --> 09:28.040
Spicy.

09:28.040 --> 09:29.040
Yeah, it is.

09:29.040 --> 09:30.260
And they're so proud of it.

09:30.260 --> 09:33.820
That's the worst thing about it is God forbid you say anything about it because this in

09:33.820 --> 09:38.660
particular is quite the area of pride for them because again, they really have something

09:38.660 --> 09:42.640
clever and they have something unique and special just like they do in the open Seuss

09:42.640 --> 09:47.240
a build service, just like they do in just the presentation of the distribution.

09:47.240 --> 09:53.400
And I mean, I used to buy every single version of Seuss in the box with the DVD set and the

09:53.400 --> 09:56.280
manuals just to support the project.

09:56.280 --> 09:58.880
Probably a $90 box set.

09:58.880 --> 10:03.960
I really don't have any animosity, but the reality is the reality and the market backs

10:03.960 --> 10:05.400
me up on this opinion.

10:05.400 --> 10:09.380
And the fact of the matter is their container play was too late.

10:09.380 --> 10:10.380
It's too late.

10:10.380 --> 10:12.400
The industry has built its own solutions now.

10:12.400 --> 10:15.280
And then at the very end here, Kevin, and I'm not trying to come at you, but I'm just

10:15.280 --> 10:18.040
trying to point out some of the policies I see in your argument.

10:18.040 --> 10:21.280
He says, Ubuntu has a significant market share, but it's at the cost of revenue.

10:21.280 --> 10:23.000
Well show me where you can see that.

10:23.000 --> 10:25.820
Because as far as I remember, Canonical is a private company and the disclosure they

10:25.820 --> 10:27.480
do make is once a year.

10:27.480 --> 10:31.240
And that disclosure seems to indicate they're making millions of dollars.

10:31.240 --> 10:35.920
And I mean like 30s of millions of dollars off of Ubuntu support.

10:35.920 --> 10:37.380
They're making quite a bit of money.

10:37.380 --> 10:40.520
So I'm not quite sure where you're saying it's at the cost of revenue.

10:40.520 --> 10:42.260
They seem to be in a really sweet spot.

10:42.260 --> 10:47.880
And now they've just expanded their OEM deals for the desktop version to include HP and

10:47.880 --> 10:48.880
Lenovo.

10:48.880 --> 10:54.240
So now they have Dell, HP and Lenovo as first party OEMs who are paying them a per sale

10:54.240 --> 10:55.780
license fee.

10:55.780 --> 10:59.040
So now they've also made the desktop profitable.

10:59.040 --> 11:02.920
So I just don't really track where Kevin's coming at here, but this is generally the

11:02.920 --> 11:06.140
reality I see painted by most SUSE advocates.

11:06.140 --> 11:11.080
And if this world clicks for them, I say more power to them because it is something that's

11:11.080 --> 11:12.080
unique.

11:12.080 --> 11:13.180
It has a lot of great solutions.

11:13.180 --> 11:17.080
It has a brilliant community and a brilliant development team behind it.

11:17.080 --> 11:19.960
And it's a very high quality distribution.

11:19.960 --> 11:21.220
Just not for me.

11:21.220 --> 11:24.200
Just doesn't fit the reality that I see in the marketplace.

11:24.200 --> 11:26.600
And I think the wider market statistics bear that out.

11:26.600 --> 11:28.240
But have at it.

11:28.240 --> 11:29.240
That's my opinion.

11:29.240 --> 11:32.680
You are welcome to respond at coder.show slash contact.

11:32.680 --> 11:33.680
Hot take, Mike.

11:33.680 --> 11:34.680
Hot take.

11:34.680 --> 11:35.680
Hot take.

11:35.680 --> 11:36.680
Spicy.

11:36.680 --> 11:37.680
Yeah.

11:37.680 --> 11:38.680
Spicy.

11:38.680 --> 11:39.680
Soleus writes in.

11:39.680 --> 11:40.680
So another feedback.

11:40.680 --> 11:41.680
And this one's about Flask.

11:41.680 --> 11:44.480
He says, super happy the show is back.

11:44.480 --> 11:47.380
It's always been a favorite J.B. show, and I'm happy for the opportunity to support the

11:47.380 --> 11:48.880
show via membership too.

11:48.880 --> 11:51.540
Oh, thanks for joining the QA team.

11:51.540 --> 11:55.000
So he goes on to say, Mike recently started talking about Python and Flask.

11:55.000 --> 11:58.960
When COVID hit us, it marked my journey into Python and Flask, and I have been learning

11:58.960 --> 12:00.920
and doing it since March of this year.

12:00.920 --> 12:01.920
Interesting.

12:01.920 --> 12:03.640
I wonder if that's been true for anyone else.

12:03.640 --> 12:07.760
He goes on to say, I was hoping Mike could talk a little bit about his work with Flask.

12:07.760 --> 12:08.760
Any tips?

12:08.760 --> 12:09.760
Any pitfalls?

12:09.760 --> 12:10.760
Maybe some use cases?

12:10.760 --> 12:12.200
Any tests or blueprints?

12:12.200 --> 12:13.200
Does he use them or not?

12:13.200 --> 12:16.320
I also wanted to share a link to Miguel Ginsburg's blog.

12:16.320 --> 12:17.440
I find it really good.

12:17.440 --> 12:20.400
It mainly focuses on Flask, and we'll have a link to that in the show notes.

12:20.400 --> 12:21.520
It says, thanks for coming back.

12:21.520 --> 12:22.740
We missed you.

12:22.740 --> 12:24.680
So any further thoughts on Flask?

12:24.680 --> 12:25.680
Aw.

12:25.680 --> 12:26.680
Yeah.

12:26.680 --> 12:30.000
So right off the bat, yes, I do use blueprints, and I like them a lot.

12:30.000 --> 12:31.000
What is that exactly?

12:31.000 --> 12:32.000
Is that-

12:32.000 --> 12:36.020
So instead of having like at rest requests or whatever it is, whatever the stupid annotation

12:36.020 --> 12:41.960
is in Flask, you can actually create a blueprint file that kind of automagically gives you-

12:41.960 --> 12:43.160
Basic components or-

12:43.160 --> 12:46.740
Well, it's like one file where all the requests for a given model can be.

12:46.740 --> 12:49.520
That's a super, like all the API endpoints, right?

12:49.520 --> 12:51.320
That's a super simplified explanation.

12:51.320 --> 12:52.320
Okay.

12:52.320 --> 12:57.160
But the way I use it is it's a way to organize your code where you just add the blueprint

12:57.160 --> 13:01.680
into your external JSON API, and that's where everything is.

13:01.680 --> 13:06.320
Blueprints can greatly simplify how large applications work and provide central means

13:06.320 --> 13:10.360
for Flask extensions to register operations on applications.

13:10.360 --> 13:11.360
Okay.

13:11.360 --> 13:12.360
All right.

13:12.360 --> 13:15.520
Fancy way to say API calls, right?

13:15.520 --> 13:16.520
Okay.

13:16.520 --> 13:17.520
Yeah.

13:17.520 --> 13:18.520
I didn't know that.

13:18.520 --> 13:19.520
That's great to know.

13:19.520 --> 13:20.520
So you love them.

13:20.520 --> 13:21.520
I love them.

13:21.520 --> 13:25.880
It's one of those things that you either should go all in on it or not though, right?

13:25.880 --> 13:29.480
Because you want consistency in your architecture.

13:29.480 --> 13:35.280
The general things on Flask, if you haven't yet, check out the Pylance thing from VS Code.

13:35.280 --> 13:39.080
That's some slick stuff they've got going over there.

13:39.080 --> 13:41.720
Well then, link to that in the show notes too.

13:41.720 --> 13:45.640
Coder.show slash three eight zero, assuming we remember to do it.

13:45.640 --> 13:46.640
Thanks for writing that in.

13:46.640 --> 13:47.960
And now I just learned a little something.

13:47.960 --> 13:48.960
I'm over here on-

13:48.960 --> 13:53.360
I'm over on the website reading about blueprints now and I didn't even know I'd be getting

13:53.360 --> 13:54.360
to that.

13:54.360 --> 13:57.160
That's what I was talking about when we started the feedback segment, is like you get into

13:57.160 --> 13:59.600
stuff you didn't even know you'd be talking about.

13:59.600 --> 14:05.160
TJ writes into the program and follows up on the topics of developers getting paid for

14:05.160 --> 14:06.520
open source work.

14:06.520 --> 14:11.240
He writes in episode 378, you received a listener message about open source developers not getting

14:11.240 --> 14:12.240
paid.

14:12.240 --> 14:18.360
Well, there was an interesting proposal about dealing with that by Mr. Big Shot, Bruce Perens

14:18.360 --> 14:23.940
at Tebcov 2020, and he links to the WebM file, which we will pass along to the show notes.

14:23.940 --> 14:29.000
The presentation is 44 minutes long and he does get into the issue of creating coherent

14:29.000 --> 14:30.000
licenses.

14:30.000 --> 14:36.700
He talks about maybe a contract law where users would have use case consent that has

14:36.700 --> 14:38.440
been given to them by developers.

14:38.440 --> 14:39.900
I mean, it's it's deep.

14:39.900 --> 14:41.600
It goes really deep.

14:41.600 --> 14:45.640
And I mean, we could probably do an entire show on it if we wanted to.

14:45.640 --> 14:49.280
So I will put the link to the video and then if we get people that seem to be into it,

14:49.280 --> 14:52.280
maybe we make a segment out of it, but otherwise we'll leave it as homework.

14:52.280 --> 14:54.360
That seems fair.

14:54.360 --> 14:55.360
That sounds good to me.

14:55.360 --> 14:57.000
Decision has been made.

14:57.000 --> 14:58.920
All right.

14:58.920 --> 14:59.920
You know what?

14:59.920 --> 15:00.920
We're cranking through this.

15:00.920 --> 15:01.920
I'm proud of us.

15:01.920 --> 15:03.760
So we have one last feedback to get to.

15:03.760 --> 15:05.280
And this is great.

15:05.280 --> 15:07.720
It's from David C. Also welcoming us back.

15:07.720 --> 15:11.380
And he says, I'm writing in to follow up on something I tweeted at you both regarding

15:11.380 --> 15:13.400
the live audio stream.

15:13.400 --> 15:16.880
So basically, I've been listening for quite a long time and I've been around during most

15:16.880 --> 15:18.920
of the live shows whenever I can make time.

15:18.920 --> 15:23.280
I am currently in the enthusiast space, but I'm moving myself little by little towards

15:23.280 --> 15:24.280
game development.

15:24.280 --> 15:29.160
I've been enjoying the J.B. shows for years and Kota Radio specifically as far back as

15:29.160 --> 15:31.040
episode 30.

15:31.040 --> 15:36.160
I tend to work on projects catching up whenever the backlog gets accumulated.

15:36.160 --> 15:37.800
And of course, during everyday life.

15:37.800 --> 15:42.400
All of this is to say I was a frequenter of the J.B. live FM audio stream provided on

15:42.400 --> 15:44.160
the site.

15:44.160 --> 15:47.160
But he finds himself to be very distractible.

15:47.160 --> 15:50.680
And if he leaves it in the browser, he ends up forgetting about it and just closes the

15:50.680 --> 15:52.240
browser.

15:52.240 --> 15:55.200
Something standalone to keep myself accountable and off Twitter is what I was thinking.

15:55.200 --> 15:56.200
That way I don't procrastinate.

15:56.200 --> 16:00.040
Needless to say, I was excited and I started a project.

16:00.040 --> 16:05.120
I recently dusted it off again and it's on my GitHub page, J.B. live radio.

16:05.120 --> 16:06.120
Hmm.

16:06.120 --> 16:08.680
It's super simple and it has some issues.

16:08.680 --> 16:12.320
Typically I'm not typically a JavaScript framework user, so forgive me.

16:12.320 --> 16:16.280
It's a bit rough, but I'd love someone to overlook the current state of the project

16:16.280 --> 16:17.280
on my GitHub.

16:17.280 --> 16:20.480
I know there's unfinished stuff and some of the code might not be perfect, but I'd

16:20.480 --> 16:21.600
love some help.

16:21.600 --> 16:25.160
The idea is to create a simple to use app to play the live stream.

16:25.160 --> 16:29.600
Unfortunately, due to some day job stuff, I'll be unable to attend live this Monday,

16:29.600 --> 16:31.520
but rest assured, I'll catch up quickly.

16:31.520 --> 16:35.040
Anyways, I'm super happy you guys are back and I'm excited to get back to listening.

16:35.040 --> 16:36.200
Thanks, David.

16:36.200 --> 16:39.680
I love it when people build these apps around our stuff.

16:39.680 --> 16:42.680
It's just super cool to see people taking the time to do that.

16:42.680 --> 16:46.520
And I feel like we could be doing more with the audio stream because it's a high quality

16:46.520 --> 16:47.520
audio stream.

16:47.520 --> 16:50.000
We've put in some effort.

16:50.000 --> 16:51.000
Is that the way to say?

16:51.000 --> 16:52.000
I've put some effort.

16:52.000 --> 16:55.600
We have, Wes and I, put effort into making sure it sounds really good and all that kind

16:55.600 --> 16:56.600
of stuff.

16:56.600 --> 16:57.600
So we should be doing more with it.

16:57.600 --> 16:59.680
So an app around that's a great idea, I feel like.

16:59.680 --> 17:00.680
Yeah.

17:00.680 --> 17:02.920
I mean, especially if you don't want to be like in browser tabs while you're listening,

17:02.920 --> 17:07.880
I think that's honestly a great idea, standalone app to get the live stream.

17:07.880 --> 17:09.120
And less resources too.

17:09.120 --> 17:10.120
Right.

17:10.120 --> 17:11.120
Which is what I think he's talking about.

17:11.120 --> 17:12.120
The live stream, right?

17:12.120 --> 17:18.760
The JBLive FM is it's either like the reruns or when we are live streaming that takes over

17:18.760 --> 17:20.160
and it's a it's a live stream.

17:20.160 --> 17:26.720
And what's nice about that is generally we try to strike the balance of low enough bit

17:26.720 --> 17:30.920
rate that you could probably stream it on your phone in the car, but high enough that

17:30.920 --> 17:33.660
it still sounds really good, like on desktop speakers.

17:33.660 --> 17:35.080
So that's kind of where we try.

17:35.080 --> 17:36.080
That's a hard balance.

17:36.080 --> 17:38.600
And we do some processing to make that possible.

17:38.600 --> 17:42.480
And so that's where we came up with the idea and you just put JBLive FM in and if it's

17:42.480 --> 17:46.940
like VLC or your web browser will support it now, it just starts playing and it's either

17:46.940 --> 17:47.940
live or reruns.

17:47.940 --> 17:53.240
It's not really a clear delineation, but it's kind of obvious because the reruns are all

17:53.240 --> 17:56.300
really old.

17:56.300 --> 17:59.400
So yeah, you'll probably figure it out.

17:59.400 --> 18:00.400
Yeah.

18:00.400 --> 18:01.760
No, this is a great idea.

18:01.760 --> 18:02.940
I mean, I'll definitely check it out.

18:02.940 --> 18:07.040
And if we'll have the link in the show notes today, anybody wants to see it is a so it's

18:07.040 --> 18:08.720
an I'm looking at it now it's electron.

18:08.720 --> 18:11.880
You can build it for Mac, Windows and Linux.

18:11.880 --> 18:12.880
Great.

18:12.880 --> 18:13.880
Yeah.

18:13.880 --> 18:15.920
Yeah, I'll probably check this out because you know what?

18:15.920 --> 18:18.920
It's one of those things that just having in your toolbar would be nice.

18:18.920 --> 18:19.920
Yeah.

18:19.920 --> 18:20.920
Yep.

18:20.920 --> 18:27.200
And if you have a ice cast streaming client of choice, put in JBLive FM and it will redirect

18:27.200 --> 18:34.520
you to the live stream URL and it'll just play in your player of choice.

18:34.520 --> 18:39.940
Linode.com slash coder go there and receive a one hundred dollar credit towards a new

18:39.940 --> 18:42.040
account for 60 days.

18:42.040 --> 18:44.580
Linode solves the problem of servers.

18:44.580 --> 18:46.860
It solves the problem of infrastructure.

18:46.860 --> 18:50.760
You simplify your cloud infrastructure with Linode's Linux virtual machines and robust

18:50.760 --> 18:53.220
set of tools built around that.

18:53.220 --> 18:57.360
And they're also solving the price problem because Linode is 30 to 50 percent less than

18:57.360 --> 19:00.600
major cloud providers like AWS.

19:00.600 --> 19:04.040
We use Linode here at Jupiter Broadcasting for our back end infrastructure.

19:04.040 --> 19:05.440
More and more all the time.

19:05.440 --> 19:07.220
The pricing structure is really simple.

19:07.220 --> 19:10.760
You can spin up the machine that matches exactly our needs.

19:10.760 --> 19:14.160
Sometimes like when I'm doing an SSH tunnel server that just does a jump post for me.

19:14.160 --> 19:17.960
Well, that's like a five dollar a month rig and that is great.

19:17.960 --> 19:22.900
But sometimes we're doing things like processing show files and we need a dedicated CPU.

19:22.900 --> 19:24.060
They have that as well.

19:24.060 --> 19:29.200
But beyond the technology, as a small business owner, I feel comfortable relying on Linode

19:29.200 --> 19:33.420
for my critical infrastructure, the stuff that makes my business possible.

19:33.420 --> 19:38.540
And the reason for that is Linode's been around for essentially as long as user mode Linux

19:38.540 --> 19:39.720
has been around.

19:39.720 --> 19:43.280
They're not some fly by night company that got a bunch of VC funding and has an idea

19:43.280 --> 19:44.760
to take on AWS.

19:44.760 --> 19:48.800
No, they've been around since nearly the beginning of this being possible.

19:48.800 --> 19:53.400
A young developer and technologist, Christopher Acker, saw an opportunity to do something

19:53.400 --> 19:58.760
more than just host another application, which is kind of what people really see in user

19:58.760 --> 19:59.760
mode Linux for.

19:59.760 --> 20:01.080
That was the Salesforce model.

20:01.080 --> 20:06.120
But he saw a way of taking cloud computing and making it less complicated, less expensive

20:06.120 --> 20:11.280
and maybe even most importantly, more accessible to every developer, regardless of where they're

20:11.280 --> 20:16.040
located or really what their resources are or who they work for.

20:16.040 --> 20:17.760
That's a massive concept.

20:17.760 --> 20:22.160
He helped pioneer cloud computing and he developed a company to bring that to developers.

20:22.160 --> 20:24.020
And that company is Linode.

20:24.020 --> 20:25.480
They've been in this for a long time.

20:25.480 --> 20:31.680
You fast forward to today and nearly two decades later, Linode is the largest independent open

20:31.680 --> 20:38.640
cloud provider in the world with 11 global data centers serving over 800,000 customers.

20:38.640 --> 20:41.360
And I am personally one of them and so is my business.

20:41.360 --> 20:43.000
And I couldn't be happier about it.

20:43.000 --> 20:47.800
And I couldn't be happier to recommend that you go to linode.com slash coder and receive

20:47.800 --> 20:51.640
a $100 60 day credit towards your new account and try it out.

20:51.640 --> 20:52.840
I think you'll be really impressed.

20:52.840 --> 20:59.080
Linode.com slash coder and a big thank you Linode for sponsoring the Coder Radio program.

20:59.080 --> 21:01.600
Have you been following all of this tick tock hoopla?

21:01.600 --> 21:06.440
I mean, this is getting crazy now and I got to be honest with you as a social network

21:06.440 --> 21:12.640
platform couldn't care less, but as a wider, larger ramifications, it seems like a huge

21:12.640 --> 21:13.640
deal.

21:13.640 --> 21:17.120
I think all app developers need the government now regulating and throwing your apps out

21:17.120 --> 21:18.120
of the stores too.

21:18.120 --> 21:19.120
That sounds like fun.

21:19.120 --> 21:20.720
What could go wrong?

21:20.720 --> 21:25.780
What I find interesting is the threat is essentially the nature of a social network.

21:25.780 --> 21:32.440
Tick tock has a algorithm that shows people things they like and they're concerned about

21:32.440 --> 21:36.840
somebody or some government influencing that algorithm.

21:36.840 --> 21:37.840
Hello.

21:37.840 --> 21:42.600
That is the single threat of every social media platform.

21:42.600 --> 21:44.040
Like let's be real.

21:44.040 --> 21:46.240
This is also the Facebook and Twitter problem, right?

21:46.240 --> 21:47.920
It's not unique to tick tock.

21:47.920 --> 21:52.400
It's just the government is different for the nation that tick tocks from.

21:52.400 --> 21:55.400
You have to find the core functionality of all of these apps.

21:55.400 --> 21:56.400
Yes.

21:56.400 --> 21:57.400
Yeah.

21:57.400 --> 21:58.400
Track spy you and manipulate you.

21:58.400 --> 21:59.400
Right.

21:59.400 --> 22:00.800
Get you to buy shit you don't need and like make you depressed and angry.

22:00.800 --> 22:02.840
Like that's that's what they do.

22:02.840 --> 22:05.280
So did it get banned though?

22:05.280 --> 22:08.880
I guess not.

22:08.880 --> 22:10.280
I think it's not.

22:10.280 --> 22:14.780
It's not because it was supposed to happen at midnight on September 20th.

22:14.780 --> 22:17.120
And as we record today, it's September 21st.

22:17.120 --> 22:22.280
Now, grant you, I'm not following it for the tick tock purposes, but the current news,

22:22.280 --> 22:27.160
as I know, is that President Trump has commented on as of Monday and he says he would not approve

22:27.160 --> 22:31.320
a tick tock deal unless ByteDance ceded its control.

22:31.320 --> 22:33.840
And after that, ByteDance said it would not be doing that.

22:33.840 --> 22:38.200
It would retain an 80 percent stake, which is not ceding control, it's ceding 20 percent

22:38.200 --> 22:39.200
control.

22:39.200 --> 22:43.560
And then ByteDance asserted it will maintain a majority ownership and control over tick

22:43.560 --> 22:50.440
tock global and will not transfer source code or any technology to Oracle and Walmart.

22:50.440 --> 22:55.640
But I think right now the U.S. has delayed the tick tock ban by a week to give time for

22:55.640 --> 22:57.960
all of this to sort out.

22:57.960 --> 23:02.200
But it sounds like it's off to a pretty rocky start just on this first day.

23:02.200 --> 23:07.880
I mean, I probably incorrectly find it hard to care about tick tock.

23:07.880 --> 23:08.880
I got to be honest with you.

23:08.880 --> 23:14.720
You know, it's incredibly popular and, you know, this is where two old dudes that don't

23:14.720 --> 23:20.640
like to dance on the Internet maybe aren't the best people to talk about this.

23:20.640 --> 23:27.080
But you think maybe maybe on the one hand, like, yes, I kind of can see the argument.

23:27.080 --> 23:30.040
But this all just seems kind of like a circus.

23:30.040 --> 23:31.040
Right.

23:31.040 --> 23:33.040
And zoom out on the ramifications of this.

23:33.040 --> 23:37.080
Look at how hostile app stores are at this point to developers.

23:37.080 --> 23:42.080
You can have the platform curator that decides you're not worth featuring.

23:42.080 --> 23:47.760
You have the potential for governments to step in and say a fundamental service you

23:47.760 --> 23:50.040
rely on is going to be removed.

23:50.040 --> 23:52.560
I mean, in this case, I'm not so sure.

23:52.560 --> 23:56.320
But let's say there were apps that used a tick tock back end or tied in with a tick

23:56.320 --> 24:01.340
tock service, much like how we used to have a whole ecosystem of Twitter clients.

24:01.340 --> 24:05.880
If you say back then we're making your living making a Twitter client and some government

24:05.880 --> 24:08.400
would come in and just say, no, no more.

24:08.400 --> 24:10.440
All of those developers are wiped out as well.

24:10.440 --> 24:11.440
Yeah.

24:11.440 --> 24:14.880
And the Twitter client example is perfect because that kind of happened, right?

24:14.880 --> 24:15.880
Not the government, but Twitter.

24:15.880 --> 24:16.880
Yeah.

24:16.880 --> 24:17.880
We don't we don't like this anymore.

24:17.880 --> 24:22.520
That's the that's the other angle is then there are commercial interests that are hostile

24:22.520 --> 24:25.580
that are also going to screw you in the app store.

24:25.580 --> 24:28.120
It's really bad now.

24:28.120 --> 24:32.000
And then you combine that with what seems to be Apple's hostile take to it in terms

24:32.000 --> 24:37.160
of trying to get revenue for services, getting a cut on store revenue and sales revenue and

24:37.160 --> 24:41.720
subscription revenue, but also just the way they dropped iOS 14 is a bit of a bomb on

24:41.720 --> 24:42.720
developers.

24:42.720 --> 24:43.720
And you're like, here you go.

24:43.720 --> 24:44.720
It's done.

24:44.720 --> 24:45.720
Now go ship your apps.

24:45.720 --> 24:47.320
I mean, I thought it was great personally.

24:47.320 --> 24:52.160
Yeah, it probably got you some work because clients had to scramble.

24:52.160 --> 24:53.160
That's right.

24:53.160 --> 24:56.000
I had to pop open the old iMac and be like, all right, let's do this.

24:56.000 --> 24:58.400
Oh, and I picture you sitting there.

24:58.400 --> 24:59.540
You've got a tasty beverage.

24:59.540 --> 25:03.960
You crack the knuckles and you just you just say to yourself, Objective C. Well, no, I

25:03.960 --> 25:04.960
plug it in.

25:04.960 --> 25:09.200
I update Xcode three times, of course.

25:09.200 --> 25:10.200
Yes.

25:10.200 --> 25:11.200
You have to get current.

25:11.200 --> 25:12.200
Right.

25:12.200 --> 25:13.200
Yes, I had to get current.

25:13.200 --> 25:14.200
Yeah.

25:14.200 --> 25:17.200
And then I realized that there's tons of deprecations.

25:17.200 --> 25:20.280
And yeah, so legacy code.

25:20.280 --> 25:22.280
There's nothing like maintenance contracts.

25:22.280 --> 25:23.280
Yeah.

25:23.280 --> 25:28.760
I mean, that's one thing the Apple ecosystem is usually pretty good for just savagely deprecating

25:28.760 --> 25:32.320
things like, OK, sure, because an app should only run for three years.

25:32.320 --> 25:33.320
Right, guys?

25:33.320 --> 25:34.320
That's OK.

25:34.320 --> 25:38.560
It's maybe on the fringe or the edge of developer hostile, but it is slightly developer hostile

25:38.560 --> 25:39.760
to operate that way.

25:39.760 --> 25:41.840
Oh, no, it's it's it's kidding aside.

25:41.840 --> 25:42.840
It's like super bad.

25:42.840 --> 25:43.840
Yeah.

25:43.840 --> 25:47.740
And what I don't get is they have all these NDAs in place, which, by the way, have you

25:47.740 --> 25:51.640
really seen any major leaks of these ARM developer kits?

25:51.640 --> 25:52.640
Not really.

25:52.640 --> 25:54.320
I've seen a few.

25:54.320 --> 25:59.640
I've seen a couple of things, but not like in a YouTube video, doing a tear down or review

25:59.640 --> 26:00.640
or.

26:00.640 --> 26:01.640
Oh, they'll sew your pants right off.

26:01.640 --> 26:02.640
Right.

26:02.640 --> 26:06.040
But that's my point is developers seem to understand that line.

26:06.040 --> 26:09.500
And in and collective here, there's a lot of them that probably have them.

26:09.500 --> 26:14.260
There could be there could be many thousands of units out there and they all seem to be

26:14.260 --> 26:16.000
mostly playing ball.

26:16.000 --> 26:19.020
So I just don't understand why Apple doesn't trust the developers a little more.

26:19.020 --> 26:20.120
They have NDAs in place.

26:20.120 --> 26:21.960
They have mechanisms to pursue them.

26:21.960 --> 26:25.440
If they break them, it seems like they could have given them a heads up.

26:25.440 --> 26:30.120
It ruins the surprise, but it would be great for for developers.

26:30.120 --> 26:35.000
I would argue the most personal and important computer in everybody's life, assuming you're

26:35.000 --> 26:36.640
an iOS user.

26:36.640 --> 26:37.960
Maybe we don't want surprises.

26:37.960 --> 26:38.960
Right.

26:38.960 --> 26:41.560
Like I have a completely different view on this.

26:41.560 --> 26:45.760
Like I if my phone is not working, I'm like out of business.

26:45.760 --> 26:46.760
Right.

26:46.760 --> 26:47.760
That's horrible.

26:47.760 --> 26:48.760
True.

26:48.760 --> 26:49.760
True.

26:49.760 --> 26:50.760
I really don't want to be surprised.

26:50.760 --> 26:51.760
I want more battery life.

26:51.760 --> 26:54.360
I mean, I'll give you just like a side example.

26:54.360 --> 26:57.400
The folks at Panic just made a new app called Nova.

26:57.400 --> 27:02.560
It is a Mac native Mac only editor, and it does not have debugging features, which some

27:02.560 --> 27:06.520
jackass since he was working on Mac decided to spend an hour trying to figure out how

27:06.520 --> 27:08.000
to get it to actually do debugging.

27:08.000 --> 27:09.000
It does not.

27:09.000 --> 27:10.660
And it's a beautiful app.

27:10.660 --> 27:15.440
For those who don't know, Panic is like one of the classic Mac developers.

27:15.440 --> 27:18.600
If you were ever into Apple, you probably know who they are.

27:18.600 --> 27:21.760
Because they're doing like this, you know, it's 100 bucks and then like an annual subscription

27:21.760 --> 27:23.720
when you get updates for forever.

27:23.720 --> 27:27.080
And then if you stop the subscription, you just get the version you have.

27:27.080 --> 27:28.080
OK.

27:28.080 --> 27:30.240
And it works as long as it's compatible with the OS.

27:30.240 --> 27:31.240
Yeah.

27:31.240 --> 27:32.240
Right.

27:32.240 --> 27:37.000
But they immediately got ripped apart by people like on Hacker News coming up with, well,

27:37.000 --> 27:40.440
this editor on the Mac App Store is like two dollars or this one's free.

27:40.440 --> 27:45.640
It's like, guys, you know, and they're kind of defending themselves.

27:45.640 --> 27:49.080
And the whole time I'm thinking, like, this is not an editor that I would use because

27:49.080 --> 27:51.440
I don't primarily work on Mac anymore.

27:51.440 --> 27:53.760
Even if I did, there are some things I don't like about it.

27:53.760 --> 27:57.760
But like, they're just not asking for that much money.

27:57.760 --> 28:06.160
And like if if on the Mac you have a problem getting like a hundred dollars out of people,

28:06.160 --> 28:09.920
then the whole indie software space and this is something I was going to save for the Coderly

28:09.920 --> 28:15.120
report, but just kind of preview here is in a real bad place.

28:15.120 --> 28:18.720
Like you and I have commented for years that one of the weird things about moving between

28:18.720 --> 28:23.460
Mac and Linux is, you know, you used to look at my dock bar and like all those applications

28:23.460 --> 28:24.460
I paid for.

28:24.460 --> 28:25.460
Yeah.

28:25.460 --> 28:26.460
Right.

28:26.460 --> 28:28.640
Whether they were like rogue amoebas, audio stuff or even the simplest app that just

28:28.640 --> 28:33.840
tweaks maybe the way applications behave or window lays out, just even small ones to

28:33.840 --> 28:36.760
go up in your toolbar and do one function are five dollars.

28:36.760 --> 28:37.760
Right.

28:37.760 --> 28:38.760
Magnet.

28:38.760 --> 28:39.760
Right.

28:39.760 --> 28:41.920
Magnet, which is basically gives you tiling like Papa West does.

28:41.920 --> 28:42.920
It's like 20 bucks.

28:42.920 --> 28:47.200
It's like iStat menu, which gives you stuff that just often comes like it's an extension

28:47.200 --> 28:51.080
for gnome shell or it's built into plasma as a plasmoid to get CPU info.

28:51.080 --> 28:52.960
But it's iStat menu is like 30 bucks.

28:52.960 --> 28:53.960
It does a lot.

28:53.960 --> 28:58.080
And it's I guess that's always my disclaimer with these back apps is they always seem like

28:58.080 --> 28:59.920
they do a lot.

28:59.920 --> 29:04.960
They do bring some value and they're usually pretty well designed and functional.

29:04.960 --> 29:09.480
But they're generally equivalents on Linux, like you're saying, are completely free and

29:09.480 --> 29:10.480
just in the repo.

29:10.480 --> 29:11.480
Yeah.

29:11.480 --> 29:17.760
I mean, the wider point is Apple actively trained even Mac users to now like not want

29:17.760 --> 29:18.760
to pay for stuff.

29:18.760 --> 29:19.760
Yeah.

29:19.760 --> 29:25.840
And just this nonsense now with with Epic, I mean, I think Epic's getting a little wacky

29:25.840 --> 29:29.600
with themselves to like some little too theatrical.

29:29.600 --> 29:34.000
Did you see this Apple went back to the court because they want to go after Unreal Engine

29:34.000 --> 29:35.000
anyway?

29:35.000 --> 29:36.000
Yeah.

29:36.000 --> 29:40.080
Apple has now characterized this as, quote, one of the most egregious acts of sabotage

29:40.080 --> 29:43.760
that Apple has experienced with any developer, end quote.

29:43.760 --> 29:47.180
They go on to say this is a direct quote from Apple's filing.

29:47.180 --> 29:52.480
Epic started a fire and poured gasoline on it and now ask this court for emergency assistance

29:52.480 --> 29:53.880
in putting it out.

29:53.880 --> 29:58.980
Even though Epic can do itself an instant, it can do it itself in an instant by simply

29:58.980 --> 30:02.840
returning to the contractual terms that have profitably governed its relationship with

30:02.840 --> 30:06.880
Apple for years.

30:06.880 --> 30:10.160
They go on to say Epic is a saboteur, not a martyr.

30:10.160 --> 30:12.880
They also follow up and go get your f***ing shine box?

30:12.880 --> 30:17.440
I mean, really, it's like, what are you doing?

30:17.440 --> 30:19.560
I mean, they're kind of right.

30:19.560 --> 30:24.120
The thing where I think Apple does kind of have them dead to rights is they went into

30:24.120 --> 30:25.120
that.

30:25.120 --> 30:26.960
They they signed that terms of service.

30:26.960 --> 30:27.960
Oh, it's premeditated.

30:27.960 --> 30:28.960
Right.

30:28.960 --> 30:29.960
And this whole thing was like a premeditated.

30:29.960 --> 30:35.240
You know, they had the commercial ready, the 1984 spoof, right?

30:35.240 --> 30:40.960
But even Google is like aggressively disabling iOS 14 features because of YouTube revenue.

30:40.960 --> 30:41.960
Yeah.

30:41.960 --> 30:44.880
So, you know, the motivation here with Apple always seems to be, number one, does it make

30:44.880 --> 30:46.180
Apple money?

30:46.180 --> 30:48.040
Number two, does it benefit other aspects of Apple?

30:48.040 --> 30:49.880
And number three, does it benefit end users?

30:49.880 --> 30:51.680
And then number four, does it benefit developers?

30:51.680 --> 30:53.680
I think that's their decision tree here.

30:53.680 --> 30:54.680
Right.

30:54.680 --> 30:55.680
No.

30:55.680 --> 30:56.680
Well, and services now, right?

30:56.680 --> 31:00.600
Now services, like, can I get a services revenue is like right up there at number one.

31:00.600 --> 31:01.600
Yeah.

31:01.600 --> 31:02.600
Number one.

31:02.600 --> 31:03.600
Yeah.

31:03.600 --> 31:06.000
And it's and I like, can I fry some bacon?

31:06.000 --> 31:08.520
I know it's not on filter, but I'm hungry.

31:08.520 --> 31:10.360
I bring bacon with me everywhere I go.

31:10.360 --> 31:11.800
Are you kidding me?

31:11.800 --> 31:14.840
That seems perfectly rational to me, I have to say.

31:14.840 --> 31:17.920
Oh, that's got a smoky hint to it.

31:17.920 --> 31:18.920
What is that?

31:18.920 --> 31:19.920
Yeah.

31:19.920 --> 31:20.920
Yeah.

31:20.920 --> 31:21.920
It's Daley's hardwood smoked bacon.

31:21.920 --> 31:22.920
It comes in a huge, huge pack.

31:22.920 --> 31:23.920
90 percent fat.

31:23.920 --> 31:25.640
Well, I think I just felt my arteries clogged.

31:25.640 --> 31:33.140
But anyway, so I am not saying they're doing this intentionally, but I think Apple is actually

31:33.140 --> 31:37.240
destroying the indie development scene.

31:37.240 --> 31:43.880
And I know that's a that's a hottest of hot takes that is a that is a 90 percent fat take.

31:43.880 --> 31:47.800
Up until now, the place that if you were a small independent developer, you went to to

31:47.800 --> 31:54.560
make money, like selling apps or licensing apps or whatever was was iOS, right?

31:54.560 --> 31:57.080
And to a lesser extent, Mac.

31:57.080 --> 32:01.260
And I know people are going to email in like Android success stories, that's fine.

32:01.260 --> 32:03.880
Apple has basically made that impossible.

32:03.880 --> 32:07.920
Like one side effect that I think is getting a little not enough coverage in the I almost

32:07.920 --> 32:12.040
said mainstream media that it's not where I wanted to go with this in the in the larger

32:12.040 --> 32:14.900
tech press is.

32:14.900 --> 32:19.680
When you break down Apple's revenue, one, the app store is making them a boat ton of

32:19.680 --> 32:20.680
money.

32:20.680 --> 32:25.080
Like this whole idea that they're just running it to be nice is nonsense.

32:25.080 --> 32:28.440
Also that money is mostly from like games.

32:28.440 --> 32:29.440
Yeah.

32:29.440 --> 32:34.640
Your app, your panics, your rogues, your, you know, name other prolific Mac developers

32:34.640 --> 32:35.640
are not the one.

32:35.640 --> 32:38.760
And they're all outside of the app store, by the way, the people I mentioned and most

32:38.760 --> 32:39.760
of them.

32:39.760 --> 32:44.480
In fact, the panic in particular writes about their experiences on iOS and not not so good.

32:44.480 --> 32:45.480
So I don't know.

32:45.480 --> 32:46.480
Maybe.

32:46.480 --> 32:49.640
I mean, again, you'll have to listen to the quarterly report, but maybe there's something

32:49.640 --> 32:55.280
here that, you know, when we started this in 2012, it wasn't easy, but it wasn't hard

32:55.280 --> 33:01.720
to like write an app and make a couple hundred bucks, at least now it's hard to make a couple

33:01.720 --> 33:02.720
hundred cents.

33:02.720 --> 33:03.720
Yeah.

33:03.720 --> 33:04.720
Yeah.

33:04.720 --> 33:09.360
I I don't know if I see this move as them trying to consolidate down the market.

33:09.360 --> 33:14.400
It also could simply be as they become nearly a two trillion dollar company.

33:14.400 --> 33:18.240
They have a really hard time conceptualizing the needs of a hundred thousand, two hundred

33:18.240 --> 33:19.960
thousand dollar revenue company.

33:19.960 --> 33:20.960
Right.

33:20.960 --> 33:21.960
They just can't.

33:21.960 --> 33:22.960
They just can't.

33:22.960 --> 33:28.720
And with that, like this just so far past where they're at now, that they really only

33:28.720 --> 33:34.020
know how to negotiate at these larger CEO to CEO terms.

33:34.020 --> 33:40.520
And and apparently Epic just even even a company as large as Epic wasn't big enough to.

33:40.520 --> 33:41.520
Well, I guess they tried.

33:41.520 --> 33:44.760
Actually, if you look at the emails, it seems like they tried, but it didn't work.

33:44.760 --> 33:46.960
I think long term here.

33:46.960 --> 33:49.720
You are going to have even if it's not intentional, you're going to have essentially what you're

33:49.720 --> 33:51.040
talking about play out.

33:51.040 --> 33:54.880
And I think we've been calling this for a while, if you look at this and these I think

33:54.880 --> 33:59.440
why we keep coming back to this on the show, if you look at the root of it is this is what

33:59.440 --> 34:01.240
we've been foreshadowing for a while.

34:01.240 --> 34:03.200
And now we're actually seeing it come to fruition.

34:03.200 --> 34:08.840
And the question is, once again, now we find ourselves with the ground shifting underneath

34:08.840 --> 34:09.840
us.

34:09.840 --> 34:10.920
How do you respond to that?

34:10.920 --> 34:15.160
Or actually maybe put more acutely, how do you survive?

34:15.160 --> 34:16.960
That's that's going to be a great question.

34:16.960 --> 34:20.520
I mean, I I think we should I hate to say keep an eye on it.

34:20.520 --> 34:25.800
But I think one, there is some chance that like the EU slaps Apple and like maybe things

34:25.800 --> 34:26.800
go back.

34:26.800 --> 34:27.800
But I kind of don't think so.

34:27.800 --> 34:30.640
I don't think I think the users have been trained that they don't have to pay for stuff.

34:30.640 --> 34:36.200
Well, and I think if you're hoping the EU or the US justice system saves you, I said

34:36.200 --> 34:38.600
the EU for a reason.

34:38.600 --> 34:40.920
I'm counting on Canada.

34:40.920 --> 34:41.920
Bring on the Mounties.

34:41.920 --> 34:42.920
Oh, yeah.

34:42.920 --> 34:43.920
Yeah.

34:43.920 --> 34:44.920
Yeah, really?

34:44.920 --> 34:45.920
Well, yeah.

34:45.920 --> 34:51.120
I mean, it's it's fascinating because they just it's so entrenched and it's so public

34:51.120 --> 34:56.600
and it really is going to play out and shift the way software is sold and consumed long

34:56.600 --> 34:57.600
term.

34:57.600 --> 34:59.720
So it's it has large ramifications.

34:59.720 --> 35:03.920
And to be fair to like leadership at Apple, they can't really stop.

35:03.920 --> 35:04.920
Right.

35:04.920 --> 35:10.520
Like if they have this leverage to make this money and Tim Cook didn't do it, that would

35:10.520 --> 35:14.000
be a problem for Tim Cook, right.

35:14.000 --> 35:17.880
And to be honest, if you read the emails that have been released in their hearts, they really

35:17.880 --> 35:19.320
believe it is their platform.

35:19.320 --> 35:20.320
It is their users.

35:20.320 --> 35:21.320
It is their devices.

35:21.320 --> 35:22.320
Right.

35:22.320 --> 35:23.320
You're you're just kind of here.

35:23.320 --> 35:24.320
Yeah.

35:24.320 --> 35:25.320
You're a you're a guest in their home.

35:25.320 --> 35:26.320
Yeah.

35:26.320 --> 35:31.440
Apple's argument is, quote, when Apple first created the iOS app store, rather than recreating

35:31.440 --> 35:36.020
the Internet, Apple opted instead to create a safe and trusted place for its iPhone customers

35:36.020 --> 35:40.600
to discover and download apps confident they will work seamlessly and securely with one

35:40.600 --> 35:42.560
tap of a finger.

35:42.560 --> 35:47.440
So that's not saying it's a console, but it's kind of saying it's a console is what they're

35:47.440 --> 35:48.440
kind of saying right there.

35:48.440 --> 35:49.440
It's it's equivalent.

35:49.440 --> 35:51.800
It's more of an Xbox and it is a computer.

35:51.800 --> 35:53.560
I don't think I don't buy that.

35:53.560 --> 35:57.720
I don't think that holds water, but they're going to try, especially when they position

35:57.720 --> 36:02.640
when they position the iPad as a productivity device and the iPhone is a videography tool.

36:02.640 --> 36:07.400
I'm not buying it's a console, but that is their positioning in this case.

36:07.400 --> 36:10.120
And of course, that's what their lawyers are going to do is they're going to argue the

36:10.120 --> 36:13.840
best case they can for Apple and they're going to use the most extreme and harshest language

36:13.840 --> 36:15.200
on both sides.

36:15.200 --> 36:16.200
Same with Epic.

36:16.200 --> 36:17.820
And we'll be talking about this for eight years.

36:17.820 --> 36:19.880
So what other OS could you run, Chris?

36:19.880 --> 36:24.040
Yeah, let's talk about let's OK, let's do the thing that people hate.

36:24.040 --> 36:27.520
But before we go there, I just you mentioned it.

36:27.520 --> 36:28.760
Coder QA dot code.

36:28.760 --> 36:32.440
If you want to become a member of this here program, not only do you support the show,

36:32.440 --> 36:36.520
but you can get a limited ad free version of the show.

36:36.520 --> 36:46.560
And also you do get that Coder Coder quarterly report, Coder quarterly report, which I guess

36:46.560 --> 36:48.360
we're doing at the end of this month.

36:48.360 --> 36:52.360
I think I think we talked about what we're going to do is is we're going to we're going

36:52.360 --> 36:55.440
to record it and then release it and it'll be in the members feed.

36:55.440 --> 36:59.800
And the way that will work is I will actually put it in your live feed.

36:59.800 --> 37:01.880
So you just are in your actual RSS feed.

37:01.880 --> 37:04.220
So if you're already subscribed, it will be there.

37:04.220 --> 37:08.200
But it will also get uploaded to the members area.

37:08.200 --> 37:11.880
So if you just for whatever reason, want to be a member and still prefer to just have

37:11.880 --> 37:15.400
the main show feed, you can go to the log in page.

37:15.400 --> 37:20.720
You'll be able to log in and just download that one off Coder quarterly report.

37:20.720 --> 37:24.320
Otherwise it'll just show up in your feed if you're subscribed to the limited ad feed.

37:24.320 --> 37:26.960
So Coder QA dot co for that.

37:26.960 --> 37:35.240
Now I am slowly and probably in a way that I think would be really annoying to most people

37:35.240 --> 37:40.120
beginning to methodically consider and research a Linux laptop.

37:40.120 --> 37:45.640
And the reason why I start now is because I am in no position now to buy a laptop.

37:45.640 --> 37:49.240
So it's impossible for me to accidentally stumble across the one I want and buy it today

37:49.240 --> 37:52.240
because I literally can't I don't have the funds.

37:52.240 --> 37:53.840
I haven't been paid for a couple of months.

37:53.840 --> 37:56.000
I mean, it's not happening, right?

37:56.000 --> 38:02.440
But if things with the business go right and when it gets close to tax time and I'm late

38:02.440 --> 38:06.680
twenty twenty, maybe early twenty twenty one and I'm looking at things, I think if things

38:06.680 --> 38:12.440
line up, I'll probably be in a position hopefully this would be a milestone to get a Linux laptop.

38:12.440 --> 38:14.340
My previous Linux laptop wasn't mine.

38:14.340 --> 38:16.240
It was owned by a cloud guru.

38:16.240 --> 38:21.880
And so I want something at some point to be my go to Linux mobile machine.

38:21.880 --> 38:28.880
But I want to measure twice, really, and cut once because I have a couple of requirements.

38:28.880 --> 38:35.480
I want something obviously that easily runs Linux with little to zero modification.

38:35.480 --> 38:37.560
But this time around, I'd also like to have a 2K screen.

38:37.560 --> 38:41.140
I think I'm done with 1080p, but I don't really want to go to 4K.

38:41.140 --> 38:44.060
And from time to time, I want to play a video game.

38:44.060 --> 38:49.340
So I'd like it to have a dedicated GPU, ideally a 14 inch form factor, but I would also consider

38:49.340 --> 38:51.840
a 15 inch form factor.

38:51.840 --> 38:54.120
When you add all this up, it's tricky.

38:54.120 --> 38:57.320
I was looking at different systems and.

38:57.320 --> 39:02.840
The one that I obviously went to first was the Bonobo, but I don't think I need that

39:02.840 --> 39:09.040
much power and I don't think I even need that much graphics because I'm not a frequent gamer

39:09.040 --> 39:11.980
and I don't need a 4K screen, I'd like a 2K screen.

39:11.980 --> 39:17.560
So then I thought maybe the Oryx Pro, but they have a 1080p panel in their system or

39:17.560 --> 39:18.560
a 4K screen.

39:18.560 --> 39:20.880
But also I'm not clear on even what graphics I need at this point.

39:20.880 --> 39:23.480
I feel like maybe it's time to consider a full Ryzen system.

39:23.480 --> 39:25.380
Maybe it's time to consider an Intel system.

39:25.380 --> 39:30.380
So first on my list is of consider is System 76, just because, you know, been a customer

39:30.380 --> 39:34.340
for over a decade plus now and I like supporting them.

39:34.340 --> 39:39.080
And also before I stopped using the ThinkPad, I wound up using Pop OS on that and found

39:39.080 --> 39:40.540
it to be pretty great.

39:40.540 --> 39:44.960
So I'm thinking maybe maybe the next one will probably run Pop OS as well.

39:44.960 --> 39:49.100
These are like my current requirements, you know, and then now what I do is I start this

39:49.100 --> 39:54.880
like slow information absorption process, kind of like taking in all of the dynamics

39:54.880 --> 39:58.560
and possibilities and then kind of whittling it down.

39:58.560 --> 40:02.880
And will you remind me, Mike, what your current daily Linux driver is?

40:02.880 --> 40:06.480
Yeah, so I'm on right now, actually, I'm on the Lemur Pro from System 76.

40:06.480 --> 40:09.920
See, that'd be a great option, too, but no dedicated GPU, right?

40:09.920 --> 40:11.560
And it's a 1080 panel.

40:11.560 --> 40:14.040
I could possibly live, I'd prefer 2K though.

40:14.040 --> 40:16.600
I'd really like, that's really the sweet spot for me.

40:16.600 --> 40:17.920
I'm like that.

40:17.920 --> 40:21.600
I do prefer 2K, so again, flame war time.

40:21.600 --> 40:23.920
I think 4K on Linux is kind of crap.

40:23.920 --> 40:25.080
It's still hit and miss a little bit.

40:25.080 --> 40:30.400
It's if you've got all GTK 3 apps or all current plasma apps, cute, you know, toolkit stuff,

40:30.400 --> 40:31.400
not so bad.

40:31.400 --> 40:37.840
But like I have two pretty essential audio programs I use that I don't even know what

40:37.840 --> 40:41.040
toolkit they're using, but it is not high DPI.

40:41.040 --> 40:43.440
It's like old X 11 stuff.

40:43.440 --> 40:44.440
So you brought up a GPU.

40:44.440 --> 40:45.440
Uh huh.

40:45.440 --> 40:46.440
Yeah.

40:46.440 --> 40:50.600
Is this like a desktop replacement here or are we talking, you know, not really because

40:50.600 --> 40:55.160
I really, I just want to play video games with the kids and they don't have crazy powerful

40:55.160 --> 40:56.280
systems.

40:56.280 --> 41:00.160
So it just, you know, dad wants to have the best, obviously.

41:00.160 --> 41:05.400
And I would like to play modern games, but for the most part I'm looking at playing games

41:05.400 --> 41:06.720
from a few years ago now.

41:06.720 --> 41:07.720
Hmm.

41:07.720 --> 41:12.600
So it doesn't have to be a crazy GPU, just a step above what the Intel gives me.

41:12.600 --> 41:16.480
This is where, and I'm not going to do it, but this is where like the Mac book really

41:16.480 --> 41:19.600
kind of checks all those boxes except for the Linux part and the Linux part is just

41:19.600 --> 41:20.940
absolutely essential.

41:20.940 --> 41:22.340
So it's just an on starter.

41:22.340 --> 41:25.960
But you look at the 16 inch Mac book pro or something like that or whatever that come

41:25.960 --> 41:29.760
out arm wise, they generally have dedicated GPU, they generally have good battery life,

41:29.760 --> 41:33.180
they generally have a good screen, they have now a good keyboard, they have a good size

41:33.180 --> 41:36.300
to weight ratio and they check a lot of the boxes.

41:36.300 --> 41:41.600
So I can understand why people buy them, but the price is high a and B it's a non starter

41:41.600 --> 41:45.480
without Linux because that's, that's the entire point of this machine.

41:45.480 --> 41:50.080
I don't really want to like XMN in the chat room is recommending external eGPU.

41:50.080 --> 41:52.000
Yeah, you know what?

41:52.000 --> 41:53.000
That gets weird.

41:53.000 --> 41:54.000
I remember when I did that last year.

41:54.000 --> 41:56.640
Yeah, I, that's what I have been doing.

41:56.640 --> 42:02.560
And frankly the, it's not bad if I'm stationary, but because I'm a dope who chooses to live

42:02.560 --> 42:06.400
in an RV, I'm mobile all the time and I'm tearing my setup down constantly.

42:06.400 --> 42:09.060
So it's always one more thing I have to move around and set up.

42:09.060 --> 42:12.000
But additionally, it's like sometimes the kid and I are just somewhere where we have

42:12.000 --> 42:16.040
our laptops, but I didn't bring the eGPU in my bag, I can't really.

42:16.040 --> 42:20.600
And it's like, well, I can't play Dylan, I'm sorry, I don't, I don't have a graphics card.

42:20.600 --> 42:21.600
It's just weird, right?

42:21.600 --> 42:22.600
So I want it built in now.

42:22.600 --> 42:25.340
So I'm thinking like there's a couple of viable options, right?

42:25.340 --> 42:28.800
Like system 76 has, I think what was it, the Bonobo you were talking about?

42:28.800 --> 42:29.800
Yeah.

42:29.800 --> 42:31.840
The Bonobo workstation, they just refreshed that.

42:31.840 --> 42:33.560
Didn't somebody just partner with Fedora?

42:33.560 --> 42:34.560
Yeah.

42:34.560 --> 42:37.800
Lenovo has some think pads like the X1 carbon, but no GPU there.

42:37.800 --> 42:40.440
Oh, they don't have a model with a GPU still?

42:40.440 --> 42:42.220
There's always the XPS, right?

42:42.220 --> 42:44.760
But like, I think no GPU on the XPS for sure.

42:44.760 --> 42:45.760
Right.

42:45.760 --> 42:46.760
Yeah.

42:46.760 --> 42:47.760
Yeah.

42:47.760 --> 42:51.120
And I'm not sure if this, if the 15 is officially, the 15 inch XPS might have a GPU.

42:51.120 --> 42:56.520
I would love the, something that's the size of the lemur or the XPS with a GPU in there.

42:56.520 --> 43:01.680
And I know that's just probably not possible with our current technology, but oh man, that'd

43:01.680 --> 43:02.680
be the sweet spot.

43:02.680 --> 43:05.360
I just want something that has very low bag cost.

43:05.360 --> 43:10.200
You know, I toss it in the bag and I can, I can feel it, but it's not like 10 pounds.

43:10.200 --> 43:15.280
I mean, I will say my, my one regret in my lemur is that it doesn't have a GPU.

43:15.280 --> 43:16.280
Yeah.

43:16.280 --> 43:17.720
For games or for other uses?

43:17.720 --> 43:18.720
Just for games generally.

43:18.720 --> 43:21.680
The thing is Proton's gotten pretty good and steam's pretty good.

43:21.680 --> 43:28.020
So it's, there's a lot of options now and it's not something I'll do every week even,

43:28.020 --> 43:33.200
but once or twice a month when I want to do it, if I'm going to be spending over $2,000

43:33.200 --> 43:36.280
on a machine, it kind of has to do all the things.

43:36.280 --> 43:37.680
That's a big investment for me.

43:37.680 --> 43:39.080
How do you feel about Nvidia?

43:39.080 --> 43:40.440
I'm okay with Nvidia.

43:40.440 --> 43:44.460
I know that it's, you know, Ryzen's all the rage now and the AMD GPU drivers baked in

43:44.460 --> 43:48.880
are pretty simple, but you know, to be honest with you, I've never really had any problem

43:48.880 --> 43:50.280
getting the Nvidia drivers going.

43:50.280 --> 43:54.840
I think they've got a longterm plan to support Linux and I think they make some pretty good

43:54.840 --> 43:55.840
cards.

43:55.840 --> 43:56.840
So I'm not really opposed.

43:56.840 --> 43:59.360
I am Ryzen curious though.

43:59.360 --> 44:00.360
You're Ryzen curious.

44:00.360 --> 44:03.960
Are you going on the Ryzen message boards, you know, chatting with some people?

44:03.960 --> 44:07.880
Well, I've played around, like in my workstation upstairs, cause I have a desktop, you know,

44:07.880 --> 44:12.440
I still have Linux machines, I just don't have a Linux laptop and my Linux desktop upstairs,

44:12.440 --> 44:15.660
I put an AMD GPU in it and it just works great.

44:15.660 --> 44:18.880
So X and M in the chat is, mentions the new Intel.

44:18.880 --> 44:19.880
Yeah.

44:19.880 --> 44:22.800
So there's some fancy new Intel chips coming out with integrated graphics and some kind

44:22.800 --> 44:24.080
of hybrid GPU mode.

44:24.080 --> 44:25.320
I don't know, man.

44:25.320 --> 44:28.480
I've been told the, you know, that's been the promise every single release is, oh, well

44:28.480 --> 44:32.960
the Intel GPU, this generation really saw some improvements and that's always true,

44:32.960 --> 44:36.000
but the other stuff isn't standing still either.

44:36.000 --> 44:40.160
I mean, here's the thing, if you're looking for like my input, you know, I have a dream

44:40.160 --> 44:42.480
of an all AMD future, right?

44:42.480 --> 44:48.320
Like if I could get basically the machine you described, but like Ryzen full stack,

44:48.320 --> 44:50.560
I'd be super happy.

44:50.560 --> 44:51.560
I don't know.

44:51.560 --> 44:53.360
I worry about things like battery life with that.

44:53.360 --> 44:54.360
We'll see.

44:54.360 --> 44:56.600
I mean, I've heard good things about the 4,000 series.

44:56.600 --> 44:58.960
You know, I was thinking about this over the weekend.

44:58.960 --> 45:00.960
I think I was talking to Joe.

45:00.960 --> 45:06.160
I'm not feeling as strongly right now, but over the weekend I started to feel concerned

45:06.160 --> 45:12.040
about ARM MacBooks and stealing desktop Linux users again.

45:12.040 --> 45:13.040
You should be.

45:13.040 --> 45:18.920
My version of reality is that around the time of Unity and gnome shell relaunching and plasma

45:18.920 --> 45:25.240
four to five, we bled tons and tons of developers to the Mac Apple ecosystem.

45:25.240 --> 45:29.960
And it was right around when OS 10 started getting good Mac laptops transitioned to Intel

45:29.960 --> 45:31.880
and the iPhone had just kicked off.

45:31.880 --> 45:36.920
Like all of these kind of convalesced together and the Linux desktop space was in massive

45:36.920 --> 45:37.920
flux.

45:37.920 --> 45:44.620
And I watched conferences and just metrics on our own stuff transition from predominantly

45:44.620 --> 45:47.040
Linux to Mac books.

45:47.040 --> 45:52.720
And it was a, it was a big, big vacuum for awhile that just sucked up tons of Linux users.

45:52.720 --> 45:59.560
And it seems like with their butterfly keyboard, um, the hit and miss nature of recent Mac

45:59.560 --> 46:03.280
OS updates that some of that had been clawed back.

46:03.280 --> 46:08.880
Also good offerings from Dell and system 76 and now Lenovo had made Linux development

46:08.880 --> 46:12.640
machines attractive once again, and we were seeing it pick back up again.

46:12.640 --> 46:17.440
And I think we're seeing a recovery in that user niche for desktop Linux.

46:17.440 --> 46:21.760
In my opinion, based on metrics I see across all of our shows based on emails that come

46:21.760 --> 46:27.980
in based on experience in the past, it's just my opinion, but I now worry that Apple is

46:27.980 --> 46:34.360
going to crush it with these arm CPUs and they're going to blow the doors off on performance.

46:34.360 --> 46:39.120
And they're going to show people real world workloads that are way faster, that generate

46:39.120 --> 46:42.120
less heat and the battery lasts 15 hours.

46:42.120 --> 46:46.900
And Oh, by the way, the machine has a new form factor, a new screen technology.

46:46.900 --> 46:50.960
It's really kick ass and they're going to just suck all those Linux users right back

46:50.960 --> 46:51.960
up.

46:51.960 --> 46:55.840
I mean, I think you are probably right if, you know, I mean, there's always the chance

46:55.840 --> 46:59.280
that they screw it up, but they've been working on this transition forever.

46:59.280 --> 47:00.280
Yeah.

47:00.280 --> 47:04.880
I mean, if you could get a Mac book that is both faster and with like, you know, 50% more

47:04.880 --> 47:07.720
battery life than a top of the line XPS let's say.

47:07.720 --> 47:08.720
Yep.

47:08.720 --> 47:09.720
Yeah.

47:09.720 --> 47:10.720
That's going to bleed people, right?

47:10.720 --> 47:16.520
There's also the ecosystem effect of iOS apps being able to run on these machines.

47:16.520 --> 47:20.680
So the home assistant project, which is one of the fastest growing open source projects

47:20.680 --> 47:29.080
on GitHub and it's an amazing project, recently released a Mac version of their iOS app that

47:29.080 --> 47:33.640
has been tuned a little bit for the Mac and now integrates the Mac into home assistant.

47:33.640 --> 47:37.680
So it can monitor when your Mac is actively being used versus when the screensaver is

47:37.680 --> 47:41.660
on it can monitor temperature information and feed that back into your home assistant

47:41.660 --> 47:43.240
automation system.

47:43.240 --> 47:49.160
And the reason they were able to flip the switch on that is because of this, this ability

47:49.160 --> 47:51.680
to take iOS apps and deploy them on the Mac.

47:51.680 --> 47:52.680
It's not perfect.

47:52.680 --> 47:56.300
It's still in like the alpha beta stage, but they don't have anything like that for Windows

47:56.300 --> 47:57.300
or Linux.

47:57.300 --> 47:58.300
Yeah.

47:58.300 --> 47:59.300
I mean, that's a community problem though, right?

47:59.300 --> 48:00.880
Like it's open source.

48:00.880 --> 48:04.960
Someone could develop a Windows version or they could, but I guess my point is when you,

48:04.960 --> 48:09.840
you can see how developers are already, even in the open source world, it's not deep into

48:09.840 --> 48:11.560
the Apple ecosystem.

48:11.560 --> 48:15.000
That's not deep into every keynote, like just totally drinking the Kool-Aid.

48:15.000 --> 48:19.800
Even those types of projects are taking advantage of this ecosystem advantage.

48:19.800 --> 48:25.580
So you combine the app availability and deployment possibilities with really good performing

48:25.580 --> 48:26.840
hardware.

48:26.840 --> 48:27.960
I am very concerned.

48:27.960 --> 48:32.400
I am very, very concerned about desktop Linux because I think that developer niche is a

48:32.400 --> 48:34.120
key user base for Linux.

48:34.120 --> 48:35.120
We'll see where it goes.

48:35.120 --> 48:39.700
And I think what's interesting is I'm doing this laptop shopping while this is likely

48:39.700 --> 48:40.700
going to drop.

48:40.700 --> 48:46.920
And the rumor has been that we'll see an ARM MacBook before the end of 2020.

48:46.920 --> 48:50.640
So probably before I buy my next machine, we'll see the first one of these drop.

48:50.640 --> 48:51.640
Yeah.

48:51.640 --> 48:54.320
I mean, I think your fears are probably well founded, right?

48:54.320 --> 48:59.400
It's, you know, it's always the question of, you know, what is the relationship of desktop

48:59.400 --> 49:01.400
Linux to the wider Linux ecosystem?

49:01.400 --> 49:02.400
Right?

49:02.400 --> 49:03.400
Small.

49:03.400 --> 49:04.400
Small is an understatement.

49:04.400 --> 49:05.400
Right.

49:05.400 --> 49:06.400
Right.

49:06.400 --> 49:08.840
Linux is really, really about, you know, the back end technology.

49:08.840 --> 49:09.840
Back end.

49:09.840 --> 49:10.840
Right.

49:10.840 --> 49:11.840
But it's a passion project for me.

49:11.840 --> 49:12.840
No, no, I get it.

49:12.840 --> 49:14.560
I'm not trying to convince you not to get a Linux laptop.

49:14.560 --> 49:16.880
I'm on a Linux laptop right now, though, right?

49:16.880 --> 49:23.640
So my point is I can't see a lot of like web developers given the choice unless they have

49:23.640 --> 49:28.480
just like it's like their passion or they like love Linux as a hobby turning down 20

49:28.480 --> 49:29.480
hour battery life.

49:29.480 --> 49:30.480
Yeah.

49:30.480 --> 49:31.480
And great performance and all of that.

49:31.480 --> 49:35.440
I mean, I gotta be honest, I would be very tempted by that, you know, when COVID is over

49:35.440 --> 49:37.560
and I have to travel around to get all the time.

49:37.560 --> 49:41.680
And if they keep these speakers top of the line like they are in the MacBook 16 and they

49:41.680 --> 49:46.580
keep the microphones top of the line like they are in the MacBook 16 and if they improve

49:46.580 --> 49:51.320
the camera quality by just putting one of their even low end iPhone front facing cameras

49:51.320 --> 49:55.280
now, they would have a very compelling work machine, especially for people that are doing

49:55.280 --> 49:57.900
the work from home and have to be on Zoom calls all day.

49:57.900 --> 50:01.880
And I'm not saying that jokingly like that is a huge demographic now.

50:01.880 --> 50:02.880
They could nail that.

50:02.880 --> 50:06.320
I kind of can't see how they could lose.

50:06.320 --> 50:07.320
Yeah.

50:07.320 --> 50:08.320
There's production issues.

50:08.320 --> 50:13.680
Now, I'm a little, I guess, less like this is the apocalypse for desktop Linux than you.

50:13.680 --> 50:18.540
And like, you know, it should be in theory an opportunity, right?

50:18.540 --> 50:23.880
If Apple trailblazes the path, other vendors who focus on Linux ought to be able to capitalize

50:23.880 --> 50:24.880
on that.

50:24.880 --> 50:25.880
Right.

50:25.880 --> 50:29.240
And maybe they produce an arm powered system of their own or maybe a risk powered system

50:29.240 --> 50:31.400
or an open power PC system.

50:31.400 --> 50:35.400
The scary part to me is, you know, Apple is going to keep that that chip super proprietary.

50:35.400 --> 50:39.600
So does Apple have some kind of we're a trillion dollar company magic that no one can hit the

50:39.600 --> 50:40.880
performance in the battery life?

50:40.880 --> 50:41.880
Yeah.

50:41.880 --> 50:42.880
I think it's called PI semiconductor.

50:42.880 --> 50:43.880
Hey, guys.

50:43.880 --> 50:44.880
Yeah.

50:44.880 --> 50:47.720
But like, let me let me put on my Mr. Monopoly hat.

50:47.720 --> 50:51.080
If Apple makes a better product, they deserve to win, right?

50:51.080 --> 50:55.880
Like that's if surfaces were good and didn't like light your backpack on fire.

50:55.880 --> 50:57.040
That is the thing that happened.

50:57.040 --> 50:59.840
They could look it up, ask Paul Therot.

50:59.840 --> 51:04.080
Then they would, you know, WSL, I actually think the bigger risk to desktop Linux is

51:04.080 --> 51:05.080
WSL.

51:05.080 --> 51:06.080
Yeah.

51:06.080 --> 51:07.320
Well, that's part of it, too, isn't it?

51:07.320 --> 51:09.200
Its pressure is coming from a couple of directions.

51:09.200 --> 51:10.200
Yeah, you're right.

51:10.200 --> 51:12.500
I guess my concern is essentially they're going to make a good product, right?

51:12.500 --> 51:14.640
Which is like what there exists to do.

51:14.640 --> 51:16.720
So I mean, you could have both.

51:16.720 --> 51:22.040
I mean, how many home pods do you have for you need a MacBook, but I haven't bought one

51:22.040 --> 51:23.040
for a long time.

51:23.040 --> 51:26.320
You know, it's like I've got I'm home pod settled now, Chris.

51:26.320 --> 51:28.040
No one has bought one for a long time.

51:28.040 --> 51:29.040
You're right.

51:29.040 --> 51:30.040
You're right.

51:30.040 --> 51:31.040
That's good.

51:31.040 --> 51:32.040
It's good thinking.

51:32.040 --> 51:34.360
Now I have to just kind of move forward and I'll start doing the research.

51:34.360 --> 51:37.920
I would love any suggestions people might have, you know, nothing I'm going to be buying

51:37.920 --> 51:40.280
right away, but something towards the end of the year.

51:40.280 --> 51:42.720
Let me know at Chris Lass on Twitter.

51:42.720 --> 51:45.880
But speaking of bacon, we have a book recommendation.

51:45.880 --> 51:46.880
People Powered.

51:46.880 --> 51:47.880
Yeah.

51:47.880 --> 51:50.880
So I had a Jono Bacon on the M. Dominic show or Mike Dominic show, a show whose name I

51:50.880 --> 51:53.600
keep changing every week because I forget.

51:53.600 --> 51:57.240
We talked about building communities, communitizing communities.

51:57.240 --> 51:59.320
And his book, People Powered, is great.

51:59.320 --> 52:02.840
It's actually given me a lot of insight into why I used to get yelled out on the Ubuntu

52:02.840 --> 52:03.840
forums all the time.

52:03.840 --> 52:04.840
Yeah, it's it's a good book.

52:04.840 --> 52:05.840
I bought it.

52:05.840 --> 52:09.720
Oh, I almost bought not quite a year ago, but just under just under a year ago, I got

52:09.720 --> 52:10.720
it.

52:10.720 --> 52:13.120
And I know they're also doing like live reads now.

52:13.120 --> 52:14.120
Yeah, there's a book club.

52:14.120 --> 52:15.120
Yeah, there's.

52:15.120 --> 52:16.120
Yeah, OK.

52:16.120 --> 52:17.120
Yeah.

52:17.120 --> 52:18.120
And they're.

52:18.120 --> 52:19.120
Yeah, it's like live streamed and all of that.

52:19.120 --> 52:20.120
So check that out.

52:20.120 --> 52:21.280
We'll have a link to that in the show notes.

52:21.280 --> 52:26.040
And you know, you should toss a link in there to that episode of the M. Dominic show or

52:26.040 --> 52:29.200
Michael Dominic show or automated, whatever you want.

52:29.200 --> 52:31.180
But the Jar Jar Binks Hour of Power.

52:31.180 --> 52:33.080
Why didn't you double down on that?

52:33.080 --> 52:34.800
Because I live in Florida.

52:34.800 --> 52:38.120
The Mickey Mouse ninjas would just come out of the ceiling tile.

52:38.120 --> 52:39.120
You're right.

52:39.120 --> 52:40.120
They would just show up at your house.

52:40.120 --> 52:41.120
Excuse me, sir.

52:41.120 --> 52:42.120
All right.

52:42.120 --> 52:46.520
Well, if you think of a toss a link in the show notes, people can hear that, too, because

52:46.520 --> 52:47.520
