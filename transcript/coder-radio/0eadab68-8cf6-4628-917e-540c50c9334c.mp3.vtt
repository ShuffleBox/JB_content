00:00.000 --> 00:15.520
This is Kota Radio, episode 413 for May 10th, 2021.

00:15.520 --> 00:19.440
Hello friend, and welcome into Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show, taking a pragmatic look

00:19.440 --> 00:24.360
at the art in the business of software development and the whole damn world of technology.

00:24.360 --> 00:26.440
This episode is brought to you by a cloud guru.

00:26.440 --> 00:32.240
A cloud guru now includes Cloud Playground, Azure, AWS, or Google's environment on ACG's

00:32.240 --> 00:34.200
credit card, not yours.

00:34.200 --> 00:38.500
Get certified, get hired, get learning at acloudguru.com.

00:38.500 --> 00:44.040
My name is Chris and our hostess with the mostest who's going to help me fight the banks

00:44.040 --> 00:45.040
is Mr. Dominic.

00:45.040 --> 00:46.040
Hello Mike.

00:46.040 --> 00:47.880
Hello, and this episode is brought to you by Goldman Sachs.

00:47.880 --> 00:50.000
Oh crap, we're not supposed to open with that.

00:50.000 --> 00:51.000
Oh no, man.

00:51.000 --> 00:53.440
I need your help to fight the establishment.

00:53.440 --> 00:57.280
Although if we can get paid, that's just as good really, let's be honest.

00:57.280 --> 01:02.200
Maybe that'll be our exit strategy from this whole podcasting thing, going big with the

01:02.200 --> 01:03.200
banks.

01:03.200 --> 01:05.000
Well, how's it going over there?

01:05.000 --> 01:08.360
I have several things I want to check in on.

01:08.360 --> 01:15.000
First and foremost, we are now weeks into Mike's X1 Carbon 11th, what is it, no, 9th

01:15.000 --> 01:16.000
gen.

01:16.000 --> 01:18.540
How is the X1 Carbon lifestyle treating you?

01:18.540 --> 01:19.540
It's good.

01:19.540 --> 01:23.200
Unfortunately, because of the tyranny that is iCloud Keychain, I could not get into either

01:23.200 --> 01:27.920
Squadcast or IRC without getting busting out the Mac.

01:27.920 --> 01:29.480
I think you mean the ecosystem.

01:29.480 --> 01:31.360
Oh, it's a feature, right?

01:31.360 --> 01:33.480
Yeah, it's the ecosystem, dude.

01:33.480 --> 01:35.200
I'm told this is the benefit.

01:35.200 --> 01:38.960
It's kind of a pain in the ass because I was putting the kid down, I was running late,

01:38.960 --> 01:40.360
and I'm like, oh, God.

01:40.360 --> 01:43.480
We should say Mike probably knows about Bitwarden and LastPass.

01:43.480 --> 01:45.280
Mike does know about Bitwarden and LastPass.

01:45.280 --> 01:50.720
I also know about some of the problems, particularly one of those, but let's not pick on anybody

01:50.720 --> 01:51.720
in particular.

01:51.720 --> 01:57.920
But yeah, can I tell you, I'm about four months into my, oh, I might be even longer into my

01:57.920 --> 02:01.760
X1 now, maybe six months into my X1 Carbon.

02:01.760 --> 02:05.920
And I checked the battery health this weekend, and I've been pretty good.

02:05.920 --> 02:07.360
I'm pretty good about my batteries.

02:07.360 --> 02:13.520
I at least, I at least am very mindful of not overcharging or leave my batteries dead.

02:13.520 --> 02:18.280
And this thing's about maybe between four and five months old, and the battery health

02:18.280 --> 02:20.880
is already at 94%.

02:20.880 --> 02:22.240
And I can tell.

02:22.240 --> 02:23.840
That seems quick.

02:23.840 --> 02:24.840
It's very quick.

02:24.840 --> 02:26.000
I'm not happy about it.

02:26.000 --> 02:27.000
I am not pleased.

02:27.000 --> 02:28.920
I'm taking proactive measures, but...

02:28.920 --> 02:30.880
Are you running that Linux operating system?

02:30.880 --> 02:31.880
Yeah, oh, yeah.

02:31.880 --> 02:33.080
Yeah, it came with that on there.

02:33.080 --> 02:36.040
So you're suggesting it's damaging the machine.

02:36.040 --> 02:41.240
Well, I'm using the tools in that GNU slash Linux to preserve the battery for as long

02:41.240 --> 02:42.400
as possible now.

02:42.400 --> 02:47.720
I am deploying a series of tools in which will enable me to try to eek the most out

02:47.720 --> 02:49.560
of it that I can, but I shouldn't have to.

02:49.560 --> 02:50.960
I just shouldn't have to.

02:50.960 --> 02:52.040
I don't know, man.

02:52.040 --> 02:55.320
I try so hard, and then these things get away from me, and then I come back to them a few

02:55.320 --> 02:58.200
months later, and I realize more damage has been done.

02:58.200 --> 03:02.960
And then I build up this guilt that I'm a bad laptop daddy, and that I don't take proper

03:02.960 --> 03:03.960
care of my laptops.

03:03.960 --> 03:04.960
It's just...

03:04.960 --> 03:05.960
It's a bad cycle.

03:05.960 --> 03:06.960
Yeah.

03:06.960 --> 03:08.840
Because you really don't want to charge it all the time, right?

03:08.840 --> 03:10.400
That's the big secret.

03:10.400 --> 03:11.400
Yeah.

03:11.400 --> 03:14.400
Well, I'm pretty sure everybody who listens to this knows, but...

03:14.400 --> 03:15.400
Yeah, I am.

03:15.400 --> 03:18.160
And I pay attention to all my batteries.

03:18.160 --> 03:20.280
It's more aggressive than I'd like to see.

03:20.280 --> 03:21.280
You know?

03:21.280 --> 03:22.280
I've...

03:22.280 --> 03:24.320
I mean, unless the other tools are lying to me, I've got machines that are older than

03:24.320 --> 03:26.720
that that have better batteries at this point.

03:26.720 --> 03:28.280
I just don't really get it.

03:28.280 --> 03:31.200
I suppose it's different for every machine and every battery, and the life cycle of each

03:31.200 --> 03:32.840
battery is going to be different, too.

03:32.840 --> 03:36.400
But I did it again, Mike.

03:36.400 --> 03:37.400
You know?

03:37.400 --> 03:43.720
I am a dumb man who can't think in long-term or short-term windows, mostly.

03:43.720 --> 03:44.720
You know what I'm saying?

03:44.720 --> 03:49.520
I could think for the next three days, and I can think for the next five years, but I

03:49.520 --> 03:52.280
couldn't tell you for the next two weeks to three months.

03:52.280 --> 03:54.440
I'm just a total mess at planning.

03:54.440 --> 03:55.880
Do you suffer from this at all?

03:55.880 --> 03:57.000
Would things especially get busy?

03:57.000 --> 03:58.000
Yeah.

03:58.000 --> 04:01.000
I would say long-time horizons feel more possible.

04:01.000 --> 04:02.160
Short-time horizons feel...

04:02.160 --> 04:03.160
It's like panic mode.

04:03.160 --> 04:04.160
Do what you can.

04:04.160 --> 04:05.160
Yeah.

04:05.160 --> 04:06.160
Put out the fire.

04:06.160 --> 04:07.160
Yeah.

04:07.160 --> 04:08.160
Medium-time horizons get a little fuzzy.

04:08.160 --> 04:09.160
Yeah.

04:09.160 --> 04:10.160
Yeah.

04:10.160 --> 04:11.160
But in what frame are you talking about here?

04:11.160 --> 04:17.360
Well, you think about how Jupiter Broadcasting operates as a business, and our revenue stream,

04:17.360 --> 04:20.000
a good portion of it comes from sponsors, right?

04:20.000 --> 04:25.120
And sponsors work on this contract where you say, okay, we commit to doing this many episodes

04:25.120 --> 04:28.560
for this long, or we'll do them in this order, or whatever.

04:28.560 --> 04:30.840
There's all these details in these agreements.

04:30.840 --> 04:36.760
And I've yet, and I've been doing this for a while, I've been doing sponsored content

04:36.760 --> 04:47.160
for like 11 years, and I still have yet to properly schedule things like known family

04:47.160 --> 04:51.400
trips or holidays into these contracts.

04:51.400 --> 04:56.080
And so I find myself where I'm up against some travel, which for me is happening at

04:56.080 --> 04:59.480
the end of May, and I haven't really accommodated for anything.

04:59.480 --> 05:01.000
I don't really have any planning.

05:01.000 --> 05:07.800
I just don't have the bandwidth to zoom way out and have this master scheduler who's aware

05:07.800 --> 05:12.040
of when tech events are, and when news events are happening, and when big releases are,

05:12.040 --> 05:17.040
and when trips are happening, and when schedules for sponsors, and when co-hosts want time

05:17.040 --> 05:22.760
off, and all of this matrix of information that it's all floating around out there, I've

05:22.760 --> 05:27.220
never been good at bringing it all together and coming out with a master JB timeline.

05:27.220 --> 05:30.720
Like a master control program, if you wanted to say that, yeah.

05:30.720 --> 05:36.360
And so instead I just end up scrambling constantly, and it creates more fires, and it makes going

05:36.360 --> 05:40.200
on a trip, I need to prerecord seven shows.

05:40.200 --> 05:44.080
It's just, that's not possible, not in a week, I can't do that.

05:44.080 --> 05:46.000
Are we doing a special next week again?

05:46.000 --> 05:50.240
I don't think so, I mean, I'll think about it, I'll talk to you, I don't know.

05:50.240 --> 05:51.240
You can do it.

05:51.240 --> 05:54.060
I mean, I don't mind doing some of it from the road too, because sometimes it's kind

05:54.060 --> 05:56.920
of fun, you know, do Coder from the Road or something.

05:56.920 --> 06:00.200
I just want to say, I think we have a WSL special on us.

06:00.200 --> 06:01.200
We could.

06:01.200 --> 06:02.200
We definitely could.

06:02.200 --> 06:04.600
Yeah, I was thinking, it's funny you say that.

06:04.600 --> 06:08.160
I was thinking just last night, it's like, you know, I spent a whole weekend in Windows

06:08.160 --> 06:13.400
10 and screwing around with WSL, and I really don't feel like I relayed a lot of the experience.

06:13.400 --> 06:18.320
I relayed like the highlights of the experience, but I don't know, I feel like I could have

06:18.320 --> 06:21.720
done a better job communicating what that experience was like, because it's kind of

06:21.720 --> 06:25.600
a pivotal thing that's happened, because I still see people chewing on it in various

06:25.600 --> 06:27.280
community discussion areas.

06:27.280 --> 06:29.120
Yeah, I'm super down with WSL.

06:29.120 --> 06:30.960
I mean, let's not talk about it today, but I'm...

06:30.960 --> 06:31.960
All right.

06:31.960 --> 06:32.960
Yeah.

06:32.960 --> 06:33.960
Yeah, we'll save it for the future.

06:33.960 --> 06:38.000
Josh writes in, and he says, I have a question and a comment on Mike's obsession with.NET.

06:38.000 --> 06:42.680
I want to know your thoughts on PowerShell as a viable contender with.NET, you know,

06:42.680 --> 06:47.960
maybe in conjunction with it, because you're able to systematically call C-sharp methods

06:47.960 --> 06:51.720
if you don't want to get dirty with pipes, and you can even integrate it with XAML to

06:51.720 --> 06:52.720
make pretty GUIs.

06:52.720 --> 06:55.960
I just wanted to mention it because it's been an obsession of mine, and Mike might find

06:55.960 --> 06:57.840
it quite useful.

06:57.840 --> 06:59.320
Keep continuing with the great show.

06:59.320 --> 07:04.200
Josh, have you ever, now that you're, you know, smoking the Windows pipe over there,

07:04.200 --> 07:07.440
have you thought about looking at PowerShell?

07:07.440 --> 07:11.440
You know, when I'm in a public restroom, heating the Windows crack on a spoon, it's...

07:11.440 --> 07:13.560
Yeah, that's exactly what's going on.

07:13.560 --> 07:16.360
And this shows you my knowledge of drugs, so I'm pretty sure you don't do that with

07:16.360 --> 07:17.360
crack that...

07:17.360 --> 07:18.360
I think, whatever.

07:18.360 --> 07:25.120
But yes, in fact, the long-defunct Mike Dominic show, we had the PowerShell for Linux dudes

07:25.120 --> 07:30.000
on who were, well, that's their thing, right?

07:30.000 --> 07:31.000
Yeah.

07:31.000 --> 07:32.000
Right.

07:32.000 --> 07:33.000
Right.

07:33.000 --> 07:34.000
Good callback.

07:34.000 --> 07:35.000
So, good callback.

07:35.000 --> 07:36.000
That was maybe a year and a half ago.

07:36.000 --> 07:37.000
Maybe a little less.

07:37.000 --> 07:40.880
But I don't use PowerShell for a very boring reason, and the reason is I've been using

07:40.880 --> 07:42.720
Bash for 4,000 years.

07:42.720 --> 07:48.760
Well, and they've put so much work into making it possible to run Bash now.

07:48.760 --> 07:49.760
That's where I was going to go with this.

07:49.760 --> 07:54.440
I know if I were going to be a Windows-only admin and developer, sure, it'd be worth the

07:54.440 --> 07:59.320
investment of PowerShell, and we absolutely have talked to people that feel it is that.

07:59.320 --> 08:05.040
But when you're more mixed multi-platform, and you've got the option to just run Bash

08:05.040 --> 08:07.400
on Windows, why wouldn't you?

08:07.400 --> 08:08.400
Right.

08:08.400 --> 08:11.520
And before anybody writes in, of course, I know when I'm on Mac, it's ZShell, right?

08:11.520 --> 08:12.520
Screw that.

08:12.520 --> 08:13.520
Get rid of that.

08:13.520 --> 08:14.520
Put fish.

08:14.520 --> 08:16.880
No, I'm just saying the Bash-esque, right?

08:16.880 --> 08:18.240
The more Unix-y shells.

08:18.240 --> 08:22.120
And also, with WSL and Linux, I kind of...

08:22.120 --> 08:23.120
All right.

08:23.120 --> 08:28.600
Today, I was working in Python and.NET and Ruby, because sleep is for people who like

08:28.600 --> 08:30.120
to preserve their sanity.

08:30.120 --> 08:32.480
Two of those things were in WSL.

08:32.480 --> 08:34.580
You could probably guess the two.

08:34.580 --> 08:37.160
And one of them was in Visual Studio.

08:37.160 --> 08:42.000
But yet, all of the command line stuff was being done in WSL.

08:42.000 --> 08:43.280
I actually prefer Penguin.

08:43.280 --> 08:45.360
I know it's a paid distribution.

08:45.360 --> 08:48.120
But again, another callback to the old MacDominic show.

08:48.120 --> 08:49.620
What is it about Penguin you're liking?

08:49.620 --> 08:50.620
Is it Debian-based?

08:50.620 --> 08:51.620
It is Debian.

08:51.620 --> 08:53.360
So you get apt.

08:53.360 --> 08:54.360
You get apt.

08:54.360 --> 08:58.720
They also have a bunch of easy setup commands for common development toolchains.

08:58.720 --> 09:02.760
And they kind of smooth over some of the weirdness with crossing the file system boundary in

09:02.760 --> 09:04.680
WSL, too.

09:04.680 --> 09:10.240
Which when I say the file system boundary, I mean, if you go from, you know, like, slash

09:10.240 --> 09:15.720
mount, blah, blah, blah, to slash mount slash win home, you're now in Windows World.

09:15.720 --> 09:17.760
And that can get a little hinky.

09:17.760 --> 09:22.220
They have a bunch of like, it's literally a command Penguin setup.

09:22.220 --> 09:25.380
And you set up just like, what are you doing?

09:25.380 --> 09:28.320
Like I'm doing Ruby, I'm doing Python, I'm doing dotnet.

09:28.320 --> 09:35.620
But I'm doing dotnet on Docker and Linux, but I want to use Visual Studio as my IDE.

09:35.620 --> 09:37.000
So set it up that way.

09:37.000 --> 09:38.000
And slick.

09:38.000 --> 09:45.240
It's the same apt commands that you were familiar with if you used Debian or Ubuntu, or pop.

09:45.240 --> 09:48.360
But they basically have a script that, you know, it's a batch script, right?

09:48.360 --> 09:52.480
It sequentially runs the commands and you have to consent to the, you know, it's the

09:52.480 --> 09:53.480
same thing you've seen a million times, right?

09:53.480 --> 09:57.720
You have to say, yes, I'm willing to allow you to install this blah, blah, blah, blah.

09:57.720 --> 10:02.440
So this is a little embarrassing for me after 400 and however many episodes.

10:02.440 --> 10:04.800
I don't know how to use databases on Windows.

10:04.800 --> 10:06.160
So I use them all in WSL.

10:06.160 --> 10:07.160
I think 490 million.

10:07.160 --> 10:08.160
I love it.

10:08.160 --> 10:11.320
Let's be honest, that's a better way to go.

10:11.320 --> 10:14.280
Well, and that's what the servers look like anyway, right?

10:14.280 --> 10:15.280
Yes.

10:15.280 --> 10:16.280
Yeah, that's a good point.

10:16.280 --> 10:19.280
I mean, ultimately that's where it's going to be running.

10:19.280 --> 10:21.960
My ability to know a PSQL commands.

10:21.960 --> 10:22.960
Super great.

10:22.960 --> 10:27.500
My ability to run whatever the GUI client from Windows is, whose name I don't remember,

10:27.500 --> 10:31.940
but someone will correct us in the comments for Postgres is zero.

10:31.940 --> 10:33.120
I can do it on the command line.

10:33.120 --> 10:35.720
I just don't know how to use that application.

10:35.720 --> 10:42.040
So let's talk about Dart and Flutter because Grape writes in with a question about using

10:42.040 --> 10:44.760
Dart and Flutter for their project.

10:44.760 --> 10:47.480
Grape says, I can't seem to find a moderate take on this.

10:47.480 --> 10:52.600
Everybody's either on the very, very positive side of using Dart and Flutter or on the very,

10:52.600 --> 10:57.480
very negative side of using Dart and Flutter, and I'm not really expecting other people

10:57.480 --> 11:01.440
to help me for my opinion, but I would like to know your thoughts on using something like

11:01.440 --> 11:05.440
Dart and Flutter for a project that I'm working on to make a single code base for mobile and

11:05.440 --> 11:10.120
desktop apps and potentially a progressive web app in the future.

11:10.120 --> 11:11.120
Kind regards.

11:11.120 --> 11:12.120
Thank you so much.

11:12.120 --> 11:13.120
Grape.

11:13.120 --> 11:16.200
Now, Flutter and Dart are Google technologies.

11:16.200 --> 11:20.920
And I know you know that, Mike, but I'm just reminding the audience that that is traditionally

11:20.920 --> 11:25.480
just been like the elephant in the room when it comes to using these technologies is they're

11:25.480 --> 11:27.200
tied to Google.

11:27.200 --> 11:32.600
And this week, I saw a piece that was released that specifically argued that's all the reason

11:32.600 --> 11:36.600
you need to completely avoid Dart and Flutter is its dependence on Google.

11:36.600 --> 11:43.160
Ergo, you would be dependent on Google and you must avoid that at all costs.

11:43.160 --> 11:46.280
And I think that's some of the strongest criticism about using Dart and Flutter.

11:46.280 --> 11:50.200
And I'm curious to know your thoughts on that particular like very hard line.

11:50.200 --> 11:56.560
I mean, well, doesn't Google for Dart and Flutter have a deal with Canonical or did

11:56.560 --> 11:57.560
I dream that up?

11:57.560 --> 12:01.080
Yeah, well, it's I don't know if I don't know if how much of it's on paper, but Canonical

12:01.080 --> 12:05.280
is committed that their future applications for Linux will be written in Flutter.

12:05.280 --> 12:10.760
And they've also rewritten or begun rewriting their installer using Flutter for the Ubuntu

12:10.760 --> 12:11.760
desktop.

12:11.760 --> 12:14.080
Yeah, I mean, I found this question a little confusing when it came in, because is the

12:14.080 --> 12:17.320
question, should you consider Flutter as a development toolkit?

12:17.320 --> 12:19.320
And the answer is obviously yes.

12:19.320 --> 12:21.640
But is it based on the technical merits, right?

12:21.640 --> 12:25.280
And it depending on what you're trying, you know, the old use the best tool for the job,

12:25.280 --> 12:26.800
or is this because it's from Google?

12:26.800 --> 12:27.800
Should you not use it?

12:27.800 --> 12:28.800
Was that?

12:28.800 --> 12:31.520
Yeah, really, what they're trying to say is, do the people with the extreme opinion that

12:31.520 --> 12:33.680
because it's Google, or do they have a point?

12:33.680 --> 12:38.160
Is there a real risk of that of attaching yourself and your project, and maybe an income

12:38.160 --> 12:41.080
stream, let's say to something that's a Google project?

12:41.080 --> 12:46.040
I mean, the only one thing I would say is I usually don't like these arguments.

12:46.040 --> 12:50.800
But Google has a nasty habit of killing development platforms.

12:50.800 --> 12:55.040
And basically, every other product they've ever launched other than search and whatever

12:55.040 --> 12:57.640
they used to murder Yelp.

12:57.640 --> 13:02.680
So I personally have no problems with Flutter.

13:02.680 --> 13:04.160
I have played with it a few times.

13:04.160 --> 13:05.440
I've done it for the show, right?

13:05.440 --> 13:06.440
We've talked about Flutter.

13:06.440 --> 13:11.280
I keep plugging the show that in my show that no longer exists, but I had a Flutter guy

13:11.280 --> 13:14.160
from Google on the M Dominic show rare Mike Dominic show, right?

13:14.160 --> 13:16.760
Like it's, I have no animosity towards Flutter.

13:16.760 --> 13:22.920
It's just I don't know, I have like 1000s of lines or more than that written in ionic.

13:22.920 --> 13:26.800
And right now I'm doing a lot of stuff with dotnet Maui, but don't tell anybody.

13:26.800 --> 13:32.020
And I kind of don't believe in Dart for reasons that are sort of lame.

13:32.020 --> 13:35.960
If we want to go into that we can, like for me, it's not Flutter, it's Dart.

13:35.960 --> 13:36.960
That's kind of the problem.

13:36.960 --> 13:41.920
I tend to agree just because darts desktop Linux support is not super modern.

13:41.920 --> 13:44.320
And that turns me off.

13:44.320 --> 13:50.640
My major turn off on it is how do you do the math on the risk of Google eventually abandoning

13:50.640 --> 13:51.640
this?

13:51.640 --> 13:56.080
I don't think it's very likely because it's also tied to their fuchsia OS project, as

13:56.080 --> 13:58.840
well as some of their internal application development.

13:58.840 --> 14:03.640
So it seems like it, as far as a Google project goes, something like Dart and Flutter have

14:03.640 --> 14:05.720
a pretty good long future.

14:05.720 --> 14:09.960
And you've got at least 10 years, you could probably, I would imagine a runway.

14:09.960 --> 14:10.960
Maybe maybe it's not.

14:10.960 --> 14:12.240
Yeah, see, that's just it, though.

14:12.240 --> 14:15.840
That is just it is I actually am not confident when I say that I start to question, I go

14:15.840 --> 14:19.960
out maybe five, you know, maybe maybe in three years, they announced they're done.

14:19.960 --> 14:23.080
And then they only announced, you know, support for another couple of years after that, like

14:23.080 --> 14:25.120
who knows with Google?

14:25.120 --> 14:27.620
That's the problem is who knows with Google.

14:27.620 --> 14:28.620
Now that's it.

14:28.620 --> 14:29.620
So that's my position.

14:29.620 --> 14:33.040
And I specifically wanted to create a desktop application, multi platform desktop application.

14:33.040 --> 14:37.320
And I wanted to potentially create something that could go on the web as well as a progressive

14:37.320 --> 14:39.000
web app.

14:39.000 --> 14:43.240
And I wanted something that felt like it was easy to get started in and very modern.

14:43.240 --> 14:45.040
I'd be drawn to Flutter.

14:45.040 --> 14:48.920
I did try it really briefly, and I am no expert by any means.

14:48.920 --> 14:51.320
I mean, we're saying I'm talking just a test project.

14:51.320 --> 14:56.440
But I myself was able to build a test project and get it running on desktop Linux.

14:56.440 --> 14:57.720
And that did strike me.

14:57.720 --> 15:00.800
And the other thing I loved about it is that you can do with, you know, a lot of things

15:00.800 --> 15:06.200
now, but it's that ability to make changes and see a real time update as you're going

15:06.200 --> 15:09.440
that is so appealing once you start building that way.

15:09.440 --> 15:10.440
And Flutter enables that.

15:10.440 --> 15:15.420
So I actually I kind of want to say what's the worst that could happen?

15:15.420 --> 15:19.040
Because you're going to get at least a few years of runway out of this thing either way.

15:19.040 --> 15:22.120
But it does make me uncomfortable saying it.

15:22.120 --> 15:23.840
I don't think you're wrong.

15:23.840 --> 15:30.160
I just think given the choice between like, Flutter and Angular, I would probably go with

15:30.160 --> 15:35.360
the Angular because I mean, I'm not going to do the falsetto, I'll try business.

15:35.360 --> 15:42.280
But like, Angular is a thing if your independent application doesn't work out, you can definitely

15:42.280 --> 15:47.560
contract out for right in the enterprise, where Flutter I know there is a Flutter community

15:47.560 --> 15:52.840
and they're very mad and they yell at me on Twitter, but it's just not as big.

15:52.840 --> 15:56.640
I might have Google Reader PTSD, that might be a problem.

15:56.640 --> 15:57.640
It's not just Reader anymore.

15:57.640 --> 16:00.720
I mean, there's a lot of projects that are fading.

16:00.720 --> 16:01.720
There was Google.

16:01.720 --> 16:04.080
Oh, my God, what was the one years ago?

16:04.080 --> 16:07.000
I spent time like trying to develop something, WAVE.

16:07.000 --> 16:08.000
That was the one.

16:08.000 --> 16:09.000
Me too.

16:09.000 --> 16:14.120
And like, Google has a bad habit of saying they're going to open source great toolkits

16:14.120 --> 16:16.720
to like revolutionize the way you work.

16:16.720 --> 16:22.200
And then just killing them because it's Thursday and they had too much to drink, right?

16:22.200 --> 16:26.040
There you go, trolls, I gave it to you.

16:26.040 --> 16:28.440
But I mean, there's nothing wrong with Flutter.

16:28.440 --> 16:32.920
A friend of mine, Hank, who's a very experienced developer, is doing a lot of stuff in Flutter

16:32.920 --> 16:34.440
and he loves it.

16:34.440 --> 16:39.200
I, for reasons that make a lot of sense to me, but we'll talk about on a different show

16:39.200 --> 16:43.880
and back to doing just a crap ton of.NET and C++, and they're weirdly intermingled

16:43.880 --> 16:50.000
in ways that architecturally makes sense, but with.NET 6 and Maui coming out.

16:50.000 --> 16:54.280
And frankly, I would probably still pick Angular over Flutter just because I've been doing

16:54.280 --> 16:55.780
it for N years.

16:55.780 --> 16:59.120
And that's really the question the writer needs to ask himself, and I apologize for

16:59.120 --> 17:01.200
forgetting the name.

17:01.200 --> 17:06.760
If you're coming in, you know, virginal here, fine, pick whatever you fancy.

17:06.760 --> 17:12.800
But if you're already an experienced developer in Angular or React or Vue or whatever, why

17:12.800 --> 17:15.440
not leverage your skills to ship faster?

17:15.440 --> 17:16.440
Yeah.

17:16.440 --> 17:19.680
And you pointed out the community aspect, and that's something that I don't have a real

17:19.680 --> 17:25.200
good grasp on, but I can guarantee you Flutter doesn't have the larger community.

17:25.200 --> 17:27.400
So I think you make a good point there as well.

17:27.400 --> 17:31.000
No, but I will say, just in defense before people say I'm talking, Flutter, like I've

17:31.000 --> 17:36.880
also done it every year as like a, just like Mike is playing because he's bored and his

17:36.880 --> 17:40.280
son decided it was time to watch PAW Patrol.

17:40.280 --> 17:42.960
And you can get very productive very quickly in Flutter.

17:42.960 --> 17:46.960
Like there is nothing technically wrong with Flutter as far as I can see, compared to the

17:46.960 --> 17:50.040
other cross-platform, you know, Webby stuff.

17:50.040 --> 17:51.040
That's a great benchmark.

17:51.040 --> 17:56.120
Like, what can dad get done while a couple of episodes of something on Netflix are getting

17:56.120 --> 17:57.120
watched?

17:57.120 --> 18:02.560
Listen, while an entire city of adults who have to leave all their emergency services,

18:02.560 --> 18:07.480
including the fire and police departments, up to a 10-year-old boy and a bunch of puppy

18:07.480 --> 18:11.280
dogs, yes, what can dad get done while that is happening?

18:11.280 --> 18:12.280
Yes.

18:12.280 --> 18:15.000
And if you're not a parent, you don't know what PAW Patrol is, don't ever look.

18:15.000 --> 18:18.160
No, you don't want to go down that hole.

18:18.160 --> 18:21.920
Trust me, you're better off.

18:21.920 --> 18:23.840
Lino.com slash coder.

18:23.840 --> 18:28.400
Go there to support the show and go there to get $100 in 60-day credit towards a new

18:28.400 --> 18:32.240
account and try all of the things I'm about to tell you about.

18:32.240 --> 18:36.240
I mean, it really is the best way to spin up something in the cloud.

18:36.240 --> 18:41.200
It's 30 to 50% cheaper than the other cloud providers out there, and they've been around

18:41.200 --> 18:44.240
since 2003, so they really know what they're doing.

18:44.240 --> 18:47.280
And they have hundreds of guides and tutorials to help you get started.

18:47.280 --> 18:48.600
There's lots of good things in there.

18:48.600 --> 18:51.320
And the nice thing about that is you can read a guide and make sure you've done something

18:51.320 --> 18:53.720
right and that you've put it in production.

18:53.720 --> 18:57.820
But you know what I always say, it's like it really kind of matters how good the support

18:57.820 --> 19:00.440
is when you are in an emergency situation.

19:00.440 --> 19:03.480
And that's a bar Linode meets over and over again.

19:03.480 --> 19:06.880
I hear that from the audience who've tried out Linode, and they're blown away.

19:06.880 --> 19:09.960
I've heard from people who have a $5 Linode, and I've also heard from people who are running

19:09.960 --> 19:13.840
a lot of different systems on there, support's really good by phone or ticket, and that matters

19:13.840 --> 19:15.680
when you put something into production.

19:15.680 --> 19:20.800
They have S3 compatible object storage, and we use that for all kinds of innovative things.

19:20.800 --> 19:26.560
Just recently, the Clonezilla project added built-in S3 backup, so you could image a system

19:26.560 --> 19:28.460
right to object storage.

19:28.460 --> 19:29.640
How great is that?

19:29.640 --> 19:33.320
But the question I get from people who haven't tried Linode yet, and they know that I've

19:33.320 --> 19:36.900
been using it for a couple of years now, so I've got some experience, is what's the big

19:36.900 --> 19:39.280
differentiator between one of the other cloud providers?

19:39.280 --> 19:43.880
Well, there's a lot you could choose from out there, but none of them are quite like

19:43.880 --> 19:44.880
Linode.

19:44.880 --> 19:48.960
None of them have all of the components together, the super fast networking, the extremely fast

19:48.960 --> 19:54.640
rigs that just beat everybody else in performance, 11 data centers to choose from, really, really

19:54.640 --> 19:59.960
high-end CPU systems with AMD EPYC processors if that's what you need, or extremely reasonably

19:59.960 --> 20:04.160
priced systems for hosting a blog or a game server.

20:04.160 --> 20:08.080
One click application deployments and all of that is just right there in their very

20:08.080 --> 20:10.240
easy-to-use dashboard.

20:10.240 --> 20:11.480
There's a lot to look at.

20:11.480 --> 20:12.480
There's a lot to try.

20:12.480 --> 20:15.280
So that's why I say you should really just go check it out for yourself and support the

20:15.280 --> 20:18.200
show at the same time, because you're going to get $100 60-day credit.

20:18.200 --> 20:21.280
So why not try it out and see what we've been saying?

20:21.280 --> 20:24.480
See why it's what I've chosen now for a couple of years straight.

20:24.480 --> 20:29.720
So go to linode.com slash coder, get that $100 60-day credit towards your new account.

20:29.720 --> 20:31.080
It's a great way to get going.

20:31.080 --> 20:34.720
There's all kinds of great project management applications you can self-host to if you want

20:34.720 --> 20:36.920
to help organize your team.

20:36.920 --> 20:38.760
That's how I started using one of them.

20:38.760 --> 20:45.080
And then pretty soon, I put a real-time markdown collaboration tool called HedgeDock on there.

20:45.080 --> 20:47.360
And then pretty soon after that, we had NextCloud.

20:47.360 --> 20:52.280
And then pretty soon after that, we had just system after system, really, matrix emails

20:52.280 --> 20:53.280
on there.

20:53.280 --> 20:54.520
Our encoding systems are on there.

20:54.520 --> 20:58.040
I mean, it's really been great because each system we can kind of customize just to the

20:58.040 --> 20:59.040
way we need it.

20:59.040 --> 21:00.880
And there's lots of distributions to choose from.

21:00.880 --> 21:01.880
So go try it out right now.

21:01.880 --> 21:07.000
See what I've been saying at linode.com slash coder.

21:07.000 --> 21:08.000
All right.

21:08.000 --> 21:10.120
This is just a mess.

21:10.120 --> 21:12.600
This was sent into the show and I really feel for them.

21:12.600 --> 21:17.920
A hacker accessed their AWS account and rang up a massive bill.

21:17.920 --> 21:18.920
Did you see this?

21:18.920 --> 21:19.920
Did I?

21:19.920 --> 21:20.920
50k.

21:20.920 --> 21:21.920
50k.

21:21.920 --> 21:22.920
And they haven't heard back from Amazon.

21:22.920 --> 21:23.920
I'm sorry.

21:23.920 --> 21:24.920
I took a small heart attack there.

21:24.920 --> 21:25.920
What did you say?

21:25.920 --> 21:26.920
Yeah.

21:26.920 --> 21:27.920
I know.

21:27.920 --> 21:28.920
It's a lot of money.

21:28.920 --> 21:29.920
It is.

21:29.920 --> 21:30.920
And you know what else the guy said?

21:30.920 --> 21:33.960
His bill is usually like around $1,000 a month.

21:33.960 --> 21:35.560
So he was pretty shocked.

21:35.560 --> 21:39.040
He was pretty shocked when he saw a $26,000 charge from AWS.

21:39.040 --> 21:42.520
How could you imagine?

21:42.520 --> 21:48.800
He opened up a support case immediately and somehow the case got posted twice.

21:48.800 --> 21:50.920
Because of that, the support team marked both cases as duplicates.

21:50.920 --> 21:55.420
Then he had to reopen and then it was resolved again as a duplicate.

21:55.420 --> 21:59.000
And now he's just trying desperately to get a hold of someone at Amazon.

21:59.000 --> 22:00.880
He's emailed people directly.

22:00.880 --> 22:01.880
He doesn't know what to do.

22:01.880 --> 22:04.360
Wait, the Python script wasn't super helpful.

22:04.360 --> 22:05.360
I know, right?

22:05.360 --> 22:09.680
You know, this reminds me of the time, one time when my employer gave me the login to

22:09.680 --> 22:12.840
their AWS account so I could go learn.

22:12.840 --> 22:15.960
And I didn't know anything about AWS at the time.

22:15.960 --> 22:16.960
It was brand new, really.

22:16.960 --> 22:18.800
So not a lot of people did.

22:18.800 --> 22:25.000
And I rang up $2,000 and just idling, just left a machine idling on their account.

22:25.000 --> 22:29.240
$2,000 bill for a machine doing nothing.

22:29.240 --> 22:33.000
We remember years ago, I had this story with Azure and they were like, although I will

22:33.000 --> 22:36.920
give Microsoft one thing, if you have a rep, like, hey man, I really don't want to pay

22:36.920 --> 22:37.920
this $10,000 bill.

22:37.920 --> 22:38.920
They're like, yeah, we don't care.

22:38.920 --> 22:39.920
It's fine.

22:39.920 --> 22:40.920
Yeah, that's good.

22:40.920 --> 22:45.920
Although AWS, I will say, if it's an accident and you only do it once, in my experience,

22:45.920 --> 22:48.440
they do usually cut you some sort of break.

22:48.440 --> 22:50.560
Yeah, as long as you can get a hold of somebody.

22:50.560 --> 22:51.560
That's his problem, right?

22:51.560 --> 22:52.560
Hopefully.

22:52.560 --> 22:53.560
Now he's tweeting about it.

22:53.560 --> 22:54.560
He's posting it on Hacker News.

22:54.560 --> 22:56.120
You know, sending it into podcasts.

22:56.120 --> 22:57.840
It's going everywhere.

22:57.840 --> 22:58.840
Get me Deckard.

22:58.840 --> 22:59.840
I know.

22:59.840 --> 23:00.840
You got to tell a story.

23:00.840 --> 23:01.840
All right.

23:01.840 --> 23:02.840
Here you go.

23:02.840 --> 23:03.840
Stay a while and listen.

23:03.840 --> 23:07.680
Children, we don't use platforms that we don't own until we have a developer, evangelist,

23:07.680 --> 23:10.240
or rep that we have the direct contact to.

23:10.240 --> 23:13.600
And not that he follows you on Twitter, but you can't DM him or her.

23:13.600 --> 23:17.240
No, I want the man's or lady's email address.

23:17.240 --> 23:20.640
You want to be able to call her if possible, but you don't want to be too pesky with that.

23:20.640 --> 23:25.520
The email, DMs, private message, have an account, be assigned to a rep.

23:25.520 --> 23:29.680
Because reps have magical admin consoles where they can make this crap go away.

23:29.680 --> 23:34.480
Man, that is such a great, great point.

23:34.480 --> 23:39.000
If you're going to bet the farm on somebody's platform, you better at least get a rep, right?

23:39.000 --> 23:42.560
I think you just gave everyone their moment of value right there for the show, you know,

23:42.560 --> 23:43.800
passing some sage wisdom.

23:43.800 --> 23:47.320
So I want to run the story past you.

23:47.320 --> 23:51.520
You and I have talked about Docker since the early days, like we have mentioned before.

23:51.520 --> 23:54.040
I've been dying to talk about this, go ahead.

23:54.040 --> 24:00.760
And you have commented early on, on questioning how they were going to earn real money long

24:00.760 --> 24:01.760
term.

24:01.760 --> 24:06.200
And then we've seen clearly this narrative build in the market analysis people, you know,

24:06.200 --> 24:10.360
that class talk about how Docker is struggling to find a path to revenue, Docker can't figure

24:10.360 --> 24:14.160
out how to monetize, etc, etc.

24:14.160 --> 24:18.200
And we've seen all kinds of crazy trajectories where in quote unquote, enterprise software

24:18.200 --> 24:24.440
companies will create large annual support contracts that you have to pay for.

24:24.440 --> 24:28.040
And if you miss anything, you have to pay your missed time before you can get a new

24:28.040 --> 24:31.160
support contract and all that kind of thing.

24:31.160 --> 24:35.640
And Docker hasn't done that, even though they are very much an enterprise development tool.

24:35.640 --> 24:41.160
But they do seem to have identified new pain points that their customers experience in

24:41.160 --> 24:45.760
the Docker desktop for Mac and Windows, and specifically a lot of the feedback around

24:45.760 --> 24:51.840
the Docker desktop application has been around how inconvenient the Docker update processes

24:51.840 --> 24:57.360
and how problematic it has been for developers that are on constrained and metered connections.

24:57.360 --> 25:01.840
And they've also heard a lot of complaints about how the Docker update process works.

25:01.840 --> 25:06.700
And so what Docker has done is they've taken all of that feedback and figured out every

25:06.700 --> 25:11.500
single pain point that they can monetize and now they have implemented a system that encourages

25:11.500 --> 25:15.400
developers to skip updates by pain.

25:15.400 --> 25:21.740
If you don't want to upgrade your Docker desktop today, you can pay to skip an update by becoming

25:21.740 --> 25:23.500
a pro user.

25:23.500 --> 25:28.880
Or if you're part of a team and or you have to just either update or continue to hit dismiss

25:28.880 --> 25:30.100
every single day.

25:30.100 --> 25:35.480
If you're part of a team that pays, a magical bit gets flipped and an option comes on in

25:35.480 --> 25:38.880
the settings that allows you to suppress these notifications.

25:38.880 --> 25:41.680
So it's time for another New Jersey story.

25:41.680 --> 25:42.680
Okay.

25:42.680 --> 25:43.680
Very good.

25:43.680 --> 25:49.440
And by popular demand on Twitter, which tells you how many of our more Egon, this one's

25:49.440 --> 25:50.440
for you.

25:50.440 --> 25:51.440
Oh, Egon.

25:51.440 --> 25:52.440
I don't know, man.

25:52.440 --> 25:53.440
I don't know if he's out there anymore.

25:53.440 --> 25:54.440
I'm starting to doubt it.

25:54.440 --> 25:56.400
I'm pretty sure he's in IRC right now, actually.

25:56.400 --> 25:57.400
Get a hobby.

25:57.400 --> 25:58.400
That's right, Egon.

25:58.400 --> 25:59.400
Get a hobby.

25:59.400 --> 26:00.960
So gather around, children.

26:00.960 --> 26:04.480
It seems an awful lot like, and Chris, we love Docker, right?

26:04.480 --> 26:07.000
We had them on when they were still cloud nine.

26:07.000 --> 26:08.000
Something like that.

26:08.000 --> 26:11.200
Using lots of our infrastructures and containers these days.

26:11.200 --> 26:12.200
Lots lots of containers.

26:12.200 --> 26:14.580
A lot of mine is still too.

26:14.580 --> 26:17.920
But it seems like that's a very stable setup you've got there.

26:17.920 --> 26:21.860
Be a shame if there was an update and something happened to it.

26:21.860 --> 26:23.620
Why don't you pay us for support?

26:23.620 --> 26:26.280
Are you in the middle of a project and don't want to change your environment?

26:26.280 --> 26:29.040
Pay for support and we won't upgrade everything on you.

26:29.040 --> 26:32.600
This feels gross.

26:32.600 --> 26:35.880
And this is where the audience is going to hate me.

26:35.880 --> 26:40.040
You have to have a way to make money from your work going in.

26:40.040 --> 26:43.200
The problem that they have is Docker...

26:43.200 --> 26:49.720
We won't do the Deckard Cain thing again, but we really, really, really should.

26:49.720 --> 26:52.660
They were a VPN hosting company, children.

26:52.660 --> 26:57.560
And they were just trying to sell you VPNs and Docker was an easy way to deploy any development

26:57.560 --> 26:58.560
stack.

26:58.560 --> 27:01.020
They had never heard of Heroku.

27:01.020 --> 27:05.720
And then Dooku came, built on Docker, screwing them over completely, because Linode will

27:05.720 --> 27:08.040
give you a server for like five bucks.

27:08.040 --> 27:11.940
I mean, it really does seem to like underscore that whole they can't figure out how to monetize

27:11.940 --> 27:15.880
this thing and they're just pulling every little possible straw they can.

27:15.880 --> 27:21.160
I mean, traditionally, you have paid to receive updates, not to avoid updates.

27:21.160 --> 27:22.840
That's the core shift here.

27:22.840 --> 27:26.480
But the thing that I think that is kind of inexcusable, because I can kind of understand

27:26.480 --> 27:30.720
some kind of system like this, although 24 hour nagging is a bit much.

27:30.720 --> 27:34.760
But they don't use the native OS notification API.

27:34.760 --> 27:40.200
So you can't just like D&D your box and then avoid these annoying messages.

27:40.200 --> 27:42.360
You know, I don't think that's better.

27:42.360 --> 27:49.080
They are taking a problem they have because of some questionable monetization choices.

27:49.080 --> 27:54.220
The way it happened was Docker being the product ended up being an accident for them.

27:54.220 --> 27:58.080
They thought it was like a value add their secret sauce to their hosting thing.

27:58.080 --> 28:00.160
Their directory, their tools around it.

28:00.160 --> 28:01.520
Well, they had a bunch of crap, right?

28:01.520 --> 28:03.520
They had a bunch of stuff they were trying to sell you.

28:03.520 --> 28:08.200
And I'm not saying it was crap in terms of bad, but they I mean, ultimately, I bet if

28:08.200 --> 28:12.400
they could have gone back, they wish Docker had been more proprietary.

28:12.400 --> 28:17.940
Like maybe with this weird open source version that was gimped, but ultimately commercial,

28:17.940 --> 28:22.600
because what they're effectively doing is, as you say, they're inverting the enterprise

28:22.600 --> 28:27.680
software licensing model, instead of saying, All right, well, you know what, it's open

28:27.680 --> 28:31.800
source up until this point, and now we're closed sourcing it and blah, blah, blah.

28:31.800 --> 28:33.880
They're saying it is open source forever.

28:33.880 --> 28:38.040
But if you don't want to get hammered by updates that destabilize your infrastructure, you

28:38.040 --> 28:41.600
need to pay us, which I mean, sleaziness, right?

28:41.600 --> 28:42.600
Yeah.

28:42.600 --> 28:43.600
Or is it just me?

28:43.600 --> 28:48.160
Where it crosses the line to kind of gross for me is when I read the blog, and they kind

28:48.160 --> 28:53.920
of point by point, break down how they, quote, heard from our community about these problems.

28:53.920 --> 28:59.200
And they kind of identified clay, they clearly, you can kind of see how the whole thing worked.

28:59.200 --> 29:04.160
The team sat down and identified all of the complaints from user surveys and feedback,

29:04.160 --> 29:07.780
and went line by line on the whiteboard and figured out how to turn each one of those

29:07.780 --> 29:10.040
complaints into money.

29:10.040 --> 29:11.720
And that's the part I really don't like.

29:11.720 --> 29:15.800
And it doesn't really affect me because Docker desktop is Mac and Windows only.

29:15.800 --> 29:18.480
But for this story, I gave it a go.

29:18.480 --> 29:19.480
And it's, it's pretty good.

29:19.480 --> 29:20.480
You know, it's pretty nice.

29:20.480 --> 29:22.160
It's, it's not bad.

29:22.160 --> 29:23.160
It's not great.

29:23.160 --> 29:25.920
You know, I don't necessarily feel like I'm missing much by not having it.

29:25.920 --> 29:31.160
But I could totally understand how developers who don't come from a Linux first background,

29:31.160 --> 29:35.440
but want to take advantage of containers on their desktop of choice, would use a tool

29:35.440 --> 29:36.440
like this.

29:36.440 --> 29:40.400
And, you know, I'd be forced to go pro if I was in the middle of a project.

29:40.400 --> 29:43.280
Like you say, I'm not gonna sit there and upgrade.

29:43.280 --> 29:45.320
I just, I don't even do it now on Linux.

29:45.320 --> 29:49.920
I don't upgrade Docker in the middle of some like review or something like that, unless

29:49.920 --> 29:50.920
it's part of it.

29:50.920 --> 29:54.400
But I am running OS two, like my grandfather before me.

29:54.400 --> 29:55.400
That's how you should.

29:55.400 --> 30:01.640
It's good OS, you know, it's OS two warp speed, if we all remember, the, the time OS two completely

30:01.640 --> 30:05.120
blew my mind is I didn't realize this is how IBM did it with their mainframes.

30:05.120 --> 30:09.540
But you take like the system 390 mainframes, they're some of their big boxes.

30:09.540 --> 30:13.840
And in the front of the mainframe, or somewhere in the mainframe is an entirely separate 486

30:13.840 --> 30:18.000
or at the time, that's what it was, it was probably something different PC, there's like

30:18.000 --> 30:22.960
an entirely second PC inside the mainframe, a PC within the, well, the mainframe is not

30:22.960 --> 30:23.960
a PC.

30:23.960 --> 30:24.960
But you know what I'm saying?

30:24.960 --> 30:30.760
And that machine, that old 486 that's inside the mainframe runs OS two.

30:30.760 --> 30:36.040
And so when you connect to the mainframe, you do it through a terminal emulator on OS

30:36.040 --> 30:37.040
two.

30:37.040 --> 30:39.680
So when you turn on the screen that's on the front of the mainframe, which is kind of like

30:39.680 --> 30:43.520
this big console area, that's this awesome, like sitting area that looks like a Batman

30:43.520 --> 30:45.080
Batcave computer.

30:45.080 --> 30:49.720
The screen is actually OS two and the keyboards connected to an OS two box with a terminal

30:49.720 --> 30:53.040
that connects to the mainframe operating system.

30:53.040 --> 30:54.040
It's pretty awesome.

30:54.040 --> 30:56.360
That was my, that was my experience with OS two.

30:56.360 --> 31:02.240
But I just think it's wild to see Docker doing this and I, I disagree with you on the notification

31:02.240 --> 31:03.240
thing.

31:03.240 --> 31:06.340
It's like fine, you want to nag me every 24 hours to update.

31:06.340 --> 31:07.480
That's one thing.

31:07.480 --> 31:12.000
But if you, if you integrate it with the OS, my desktop notification system, I can turn

31:12.000 --> 31:13.880
those off while I'm working.

31:13.880 --> 31:16.320
I can't turn this off while I'm working.

31:16.320 --> 31:22.000
And that, that drives me nuts when applications implement their own notification system.

31:22.000 --> 31:24.640
Just oh, not having it.

31:24.640 --> 31:29.960
And you know, this was sent in to us via Twitter and, and the, the listener that sent it into

31:29.960 --> 31:31.360
us was exactly in that situation.

31:31.360 --> 31:34.720
He's like, I am in the middle of a project and you're telling me I have to pay not to

31:34.720 --> 31:35.880
update right now?

31:35.880 --> 31:39.240
I just restarted my computer.

31:39.240 --> 31:40.240
That's all I did.

31:40.240 --> 31:41.560
You know, I just rebooted it.

31:41.560 --> 31:45.040
No, I restarted Docker desktop and I'm getting this prompt to upgrade or pay.

31:45.040 --> 31:46.040
Give me a break.

31:46.040 --> 31:47.040
I just want to say this.

31:47.040 --> 31:53.280
If you run an enterprise software company, devs are moody folks, maybe annoying them

31:53.280 --> 31:55.320
while they're in the middle of a project.

31:55.320 --> 32:00.280
I think there's a non-zero chance they just don't like use your product again.

32:00.280 --> 32:03.280
Yeah, that's definitely, actually, you know what, it's funny you say that because I'd

32:03.280 --> 32:08.960
say one of the top responses I saw in comment sections was, well, hey, have you heard of

32:08.960 --> 32:10.960
Podman?

32:10.960 --> 32:12.640
Podman is this, you know, alternative.

32:12.640 --> 32:14.440
Like I saw that a lot.

32:14.440 --> 32:19.180

Free t-shirt?

33:41.600 --> 33:42.600
Free shirts?

33:42.600 --> 33:43.600
Okay.

33:43.600 --> 33:45.360
I don't, I haven't gotten a free shirt in years.

33:45.360 --> 33:49.560
Been like too seriously, almost feels like 120 years actually.

33:49.560 --> 33:51.960
I could use a t-shirt Datadog.

33:51.960 --> 33:52.960
Datadog.

33:52.960 --> 33:53.960
Go get one for me.

33:53.960 --> 33:57.300
Datadog.com slash coder radio.

33:57.300 --> 34:01.080
So I don't know if you're following, let's just cover this briefly just so we have captured

34:01.080 --> 34:02.080
it.

34:02.080 --> 34:06.480
I'm just showing some of the highlights that are coming out of the Apple versus Epic trial.

34:06.480 --> 34:07.520
It's already underway.

34:07.520 --> 34:10.040
I can't believe the speed that this thing's moving at.

34:10.040 --> 34:18.320
And basically Epic's lawyers are arguing that iOS should just be more like macOS.

34:18.320 --> 34:22.880
Still have strong security and privacy standards, but allow a gatekeeper type system where third

34:22.880 --> 34:25.540
party applications can be run with some work.

34:25.540 --> 34:30.440
They even suggest that Apple should make it kind of hard so that way you can't just roll

34:30.440 --> 34:36.120
up on a third party app and install it, but that you have to go through a bit of a rigamarole.

34:36.120 --> 34:39.400
That's what they want and that's going to be their core argument going through this

34:39.400 --> 34:40.400
entire thing.

34:40.400 --> 34:43.480
And then they're going to lay out all these examples of Apple not managing the app store

34:43.480 --> 34:48.640
properly and argue that that's the reason that you should allow third party sideloading

34:48.640 --> 34:49.640
on the iPhone.

34:49.640 --> 34:51.160
You think they're going to be able to pull it off?

34:51.160 --> 34:52.160
No.

34:52.160 --> 34:53.160
Probably not, huh?

34:53.160 --> 34:55.600
They have gotten some juicy, juicy deets out there though.

34:55.600 --> 34:58.480
I like the hater raid for iMessage on Android.

34:58.480 --> 35:02.860
That was unrelated to the actual question, but every time we feel like, well, why would

35:02.860 --> 35:04.000
Apple be like that?

35:04.000 --> 35:05.000
They're like that.

35:05.000 --> 35:09.920
It also revealed a conversation where Apple was aware of some bogus versions of Xcode

35:09.920 --> 35:14.080
getting some systems compromised and information compromised and Apple just couldn't really

35:14.080 --> 35:18.420
be bothered to go through the problem of contacting all the individually affected people in their

35:18.420 --> 35:23.240
own native languages, so they just kind of forgot about that.

35:23.240 --> 35:27.160
I feel like we've been covering the story in a way for years, but it's been Mike's Conspiracy

35:27.160 --> 35:32.960
Theory tinfoil hat hour, but Apple is the big company that we've always said they are

35:32.960 --> 35:38.440
and things that don't make financial sense for them, they don't do.

35:38.440 --> 35:42.520
You look at it though and I think they are going to face a reckoning and what happens

35:42.520 --> 35:46.240
here will lay the ground for the next battle.

35:46.240 --> 35:48.600
Just look at podcast subscriptions.

35:48.600 --> 35:52.400
Apple doesn't have to pay a 30% tax when you subscribe.

35:52.400 --> 35:53.700
Apple doesn't have to pay that fee, right?

35:53.700 --> 35:55.800
For Apple, they're paying cost.

35:55.800 --> 36:01.280
But if Spotify wanted to enable subscriptions to podcasts through the Spotify app on iOS,

36:01.280 --> 36:05.680
they would have to give 30% of that subscription to Apple and then Spotify would have to take

36:05.680 --> 36:10.240
their cut and then whatever's left would go to the podcaster and it's literally not tenable.

36:10.240 --> 36:15.440
But because Apple owns the platform and Apple owns the payment process and Apple has the

36:15.440 --> 36:21.520
customer by the balls, they can offer a competing service at a lower cost than anyone else on

36:21.520 --> 36:22.880
the platform can.

36:22.880 --> 36:26.960
And ultimately, I think that kind of combination of an issue is going to be problematic at

36:26.960 --> 36:27.960
least for them.

36:27.960 --> 36:28.960
Right.

36:28.960 --> 36:35.220
But asking Apple not to use their insane platform control in a monopolistic way is like asking

36:35.220 --> 36:38.120
my dog if I drop a steak on the floor not to eat it.

36:38.120 --> 36:39.120
Yeah.

36:39.120 --> 36:41.680
I mean, they built the platform, they built the app store and they built the payment information

36:41.680 --> 36:45.120
and they got the customer to put their payment information into that platform.

36:45.120 --> 36:46.120
Right.

36:46.120 --> 36:52.400
Or it's like if you and I are in Colorado and we're at System76 and I'm drinking, asking

36:52.400 --> 36:57.000
me not to buy five or six Thalios, it's going to happen, right?

36:57.000 --> 37:01.440
So fighting me is only going to create a scene and that's what Epic's doing.

37:01.440 --> 37:02.440
They're fighting Apple.

37:02.440 --> 37:07.120
Apple's like, until someone stops us, until the farmer gets a rifle out and puts barbed

37:07.120 --> 37:09.960
wire around the chicken coop, we're wolves, man.

37:09.960 --> 37:10.960
We're eating all the chickens.

37:10.960 --> 37:12.720
I don't know what to tell you.

37:12.720 --> 37:17.160
Epic seems to be going for a bit of an emotional appeal, sort of like look at what's happening

37:17.160 --> 37:21.360
here and Apple's kind of going for more of a just the facts kind of approach.

37:21.360 --> 37:22.360
I'm sorry to gender.

37:22.360 --> 37:23.360
I'm sorry for this.

37:23.360 --> 37:26.160
But Chris, you and I were both boys in high school once.

37:26.160 --> 37:27.520
Yeah, as far as I know.

37:27.520 --> 37:35.360
Is it not true that the bigger, stronger boys tend to push around, dare I say, use their

37:35.360 --> 37:38.680
better position against the weaker, nerdier boys?

37:38.680 --> 37:40.720
I think you could even take the analogy even further.

37:40.720 --> 37:42.900
Apple isn't a high school student.

37:42.900 --> 37:44.660
Apple is the high school.

37:44.660 --> 37:46.880
Apple is the administrative staff of a high school.

37:46.880 --> 37:47.880
Oh, yeah.

37:47.880 --> 37:51.120
And if the high school wants to sell cookies in the cafeteria, they're going to have a

37:51.120 --> 37:53.280
monopoly on the cookie market in the cafeteria.

37:53.280 --> 37:57.080
Yeah, it's why a Coca Cola in my high school cost weirdly like 350.

37:57.080 --> 37:58.080
Yeah.

37:58.080 --> 38:02.240
And why we have like these ginormous chocolate chip cookies that were clearly unhealthy for

38:02.240 --> 38:05.280
teenagers to be eating the size of my face.

38:05.280 --> 38:09.320
Why are you selling me soda at a 300% markup?

38:09.320 --> 38:11.280
Oh, you need money.

38:11.280 --> 38:12.280
Got it.

38:12.280 --> 38:13.280
Yeah.

38:13.280 --> 38:14.280
I wonder.

38:14.280 --> 38:15.280
We'll see.

38:15.280 --> 38:16.160
There's been a lot of little juicy things here and there coming up.

38:16.160 --> 38:21.700
But ultimately, I love that apparently the epics lawyers epics lawyers are listening

38:21.700 --> 38:26.480
to the Coderadio program because it was about six months ago that I suggested that Apple

38:26.480 --> 38:32.100
should just do a gatekeeper style third party loading where you plug the phone in, it mounts

38:32.100 --> 38:33.100
under finder.

38:33.100 --> 38:34.100
Never gonna happen.

38:34.100 --> 38:35.100
I know.

38:35.100 --> 38:36.100
Never, ever gonna happen.

38:36.100 --> 38:37.100
That's all it would take, though.

38:37.100 --> 38:38.100
That's all it would take.

38:38.100 --> 38:42.120
Best case scenario, you can use a different payment form in your apps.

38:42.120 --> 38:43.120
That would be good, too.

38:43.120 --> 38:45.360
That really that really would that would really be good.

38:45.360 --> 38:50.080
And then Apple's going to trot out every horror story of some some group getting ripped off

38:50.080 --> 38:51.840
and you know, they're going to do it.

38:51.840 --> 38:56.720
Before we go, I wanted to just chat really quickly about remote work because it's just

38:56.720 --> 38:58.680
been an ongoing topic for us.

38:58.680 --> 39:03.800
And there was an article about the 10 best practices for remote software engineering.

39:03.800 --> 39:07.640
You know, one of these standard, you know, things that we'll see from time to time.

39:07.640 --> 39:10.380
And it's like, number one, work on things you care about.

39:10.380 --> 39:12.680
Number two, define goals for yourself, that kind of stuff.

39:12.680 --> 39:13.680
Right.

39:13.680 --> 39:17.140
And what I found fascinating, we'll have a link to this in the show notes, is the hacker

39:17.140 --> 39:23.120
news comments that if you read these from the perspective of a boss or manager should

39:23.120 --> 39:27.300
scare you shitless from ever employing remote workers.

39:27.300 --> 39:32.520
Like here's an example from someone from 14 days ago said, I stopped being able to get

39:32.520 --> 39:35.480
work done at all when they transitioned to work from home.

39:35.480 --> 39:38.760
It gradually tipped me into a low self esteem death spiral.

39:38.760 --> 39:41.840
I tried lots of different approaches to fix it.

39:41.840 --> 39:48.520
More accountability with my manager, new medication, more regular exercise, therapy, a bit of disability

39:48.520 --> 39:49.520
leave.

39:49.520 --> 39:52.640
I even moved to a bigger apartment where I could have my own office, but nothing got

39:52.640 --> 39:54.280
me past my block.

39:54.280 --> 39:55.440
I quit my job.

39:55.440 --> 39:59.160
I spent six months studying and interviewing aggressively and got hired at a higher level

39:59.160 --> 40:01.520
position at a different company.

40:01.520 --> 40:05.880
Somebody responds, I'm in the same boat right now and goes on and on about how they just

40:05.880 --> 40:08.080
can't get any work done.

40:08.080 --> 40:09.080
More people.

40:09.080 --> 40:13.720
In fact, hundreds of people in this hacker news thread, a lot of them complain about

40:13.720 --> 40:17.320
ADHD, official diagnosis, my kids have it.

40:17.320 --> 40:21.200
If something's interesting, I can focus, but when I work from home, remote work is the

40:21.200 --> 40:22.560
worst for me.

40:22.560 --> 40:25.400
Staying on task is a nightmare, this person says.

40:25.400 --> 40:26.400
I've tried medication.

40:26.400 --> 40:30.320
I was on Adderall for a while, but it just doesn't work for me.

40:30.320 --> 40:33.400
When I get blocked, things are boring and it's painful.

40:33.400 --> 40:34.960
I can't even function.

40:34.960 --> 40:36.440
I've tried to stimulate myself.

40:36.440 --> 40:42.520
I've tried to change my focus, but I get so sleepy and my work is absolute crap.

40:42.520 --> 40:46.400
These are all people and I mean, Mike, you can see the link in the show notes.

40:46.400 --> 40:52.000
This thing's full of hundreds of comments, 200 comments from people talking about how

40:52.000 --> 40:55.660
they just can't function at home, about how they're struggling to get anything done.

40:55.660 --> 41:02.640
Some of them are in very dark places and I feel like there is this dirty side to work

41:02.640 --> 41:09.840
from home and homework and remote workers where it truly does not work for some individuals.

41:09.840 --> 41:14.920
This last year and change, people that maybe didn't work so well for were forced into doing

41:14.920 --> 41:17.760
and now we're starting to see more of those accounts because it's not people that were

41:17.760 --> 41:21.760
electing to work from home necessarily, but had to now.

41:21.760 --> 41:28.600
What I am seeing here is a clear sign to me that remote workers could be a huge risk and

41:28.600 --> 41:34.360
that you have to pick very carefully for the right personality type to work in isolation

41:34.360 --> 41:37.320
like that because this thread is full of misery.

41:37.320 --> 41:44.200
So definitely working from home has been more challenging than it used to be for sure.

41:44.200 --> 41:49.600
To the point of I've had to actually hire some childcare to get some crap in order.

41:49.600 --> 41:54.400
When you sent me the link, let's just go through my mental state here.

41:54.400 --> 41:58.480
I thought I was just going to dunk on a bunch of babies whining, but I kind of felt there

41:58.480 --> 41:59.480
were pain.

41:59.480 --> 42:07.640
I don't have any of those diagnosed ADHD and God bless people who do, but I also have a

42:07.640 --> 42:12.880
very recent five-year-old, he just turned five actually a couple of weeks ago.

42:12.880 --> 42:18.840
He sees Visual Studio, he sees Ruby Mine and PyCharm and what he sees is pretty colors

42:18.840 --> 42:20.240
and why can't I do some?

42:20.240 --> 42:21.240
Yeah, sure.

42:21.240 --> 42:23.440
So that's tough.

42:23.440 --> 42:25.680
I find myself working a lot of odd hours.

42:25.680 --> 42:30.880
I find myself now that I have childcare kind of working from home in the mornings when

42:30.880 --> 42:38.580
he's at school, but more and more, it's just easier to take the X1 or the MacBook, whichever

42:38.580 --> 42:44.080
I'm working on that day or even the Lemur if I'm working on that to like not Starbucks,

42:44.080 --> 42:47.640
but we have a local coffee shop that no one would care about if they didn't live in Lithia.

42:47.640 --> 42:49.600
But it's tough.

42:49.600 --> 42:53.520
I think part of it is the lack of childcare options and I know this is going to become

42:53.520 --> 43:00.920
dad or radio if we don't stop soon, but that has been for me personally, tremendously disruptive

43:00.920 --> 43:06.720
because all aftercare was canceled and I also went through a major life change in this last

43:06.720 --> 43:11.960
period that made my home-bound childcare option did not work anymore.

43:11.960 --> 43:17.200
Yeah, our kids were out of school for a huge chunk of time and there was a lot of juggling.

43:17.200 --> 43:21.560
I totally also was going to dunk on all these people and then as I started reading, I understand

43:21.560 --> 43:26.220
because it's even sometimes harder when you're self-employed because you got to kind of wake

43:26.220 --> 43:32.040
up in the morning and you got to get stuff done, but nobody's making you do it.

43:32.040 --> 43:36.820
And if you lose track of something, nobody's going to make sure that you didn't drop the

43:36.820 --> 43:38.440
ball on something.

43:38.440 --> 43:44.380
And so it makes tracking the details of what you're doing necessary and it makes self-motivation

43:44.380 --> 43:49.500
necessary, which can be very hard things that are in short supply when you're stressed out

43:49.500 --> 43:52.080
and stretched too thin.

43:52.080 --> 43:56.080
And that's why I was complaining about my scheduling snafu earlier in the show because

43:56.080 --> 44:00.320
it's like, I've just totally put myself in this situation now.

44:00.320 --> 44:05.040
It's just a total EMP goes off in my schedule and I completely understand and I think what

44:05.040 --> 44:11.800
people have to do is, this sounds so cliche, but they have to come up with a system.

44:11.800 --> 44:14.400
They have to hold themselves accountable to come up with a system and a structure that

44:14.400 --> 44:18.060
works for themselves because nobody else is going to create it.

44:18.060 --> 44:24.040
And it's sink or swim sometimes and there's so many benefits to be able to work from home,

44:24.040 --> 44:28.080
but I have absolutely found that there is some work that is just simply better done

44:28.080 --> 44:29.080
in the office.

44:29.080 --> 44:30.080
Absolutely.

44:30.080 --> 44:35.220
Design, database design, I find anything where you need a chalkboard or a whiteboard.

44:35.220 --> 44:38.120
And I will say, what was interesting to me about this article when you put it in our

44:38.120 --> 44:44.000
Slack was I viewed this from a total like dad radio perspective, right?

44:44.000 --> 44:50.140
Healthcare practicalities stresses you out over time, really tough.

44:50.140 --> 44:57.280
But these folks with ADD and ADHD and there was a bunch of people with other kind of troubles.

44:57.280 --> 45:03.480
I think there's a larger set of people than you or I have ever thought about, I can't

45:03.480 --> 45:08.680
speak for you, but I have ever thought about that have a larger set of complications with

45:08.680 --> 45:09.680
remote work.

45:09.680 --> 45:10.680
I'm going to say problems, right?

45:10.680 --> 45:15.520
They're not really problems there, they make it harder.

45:15.520 --> 45:16.520
I don't know.

45:16.520 --> 45:20.920
I'm hoping with the vaccine and everything, many of these go away, but you saw the thing

45:20.920 --> 45:21.920
about Facebook, right?

45:21.920 --> 45:28.580
They just said anybody who wants to work remotely may do so if they fill out a form and apply.

45:28.580 --> 45:33.080
So I think this change, we've been talking about it for years, but I think the change,

45:33.080 --> 45:36.960
this is the year of the Linux, I'm sorry, no, not that this is the year of the remote

45:36.960 --> 45:37.960
work.

45:37.960 --> 45:38.960
Yes, it is.

45:38.960 --> 45:39.960
Absolutely.

45:39.960 --> 45:42.880
There are places like Facebook that embrace it and then we'll see if they kind of pull

45:42.880 --> 45:47.520
back like we've seen some shops do in the past or if they'll find a balance.

45:47.520 --> 45:53.200
And I know for myself, one of the hardest things about getting motivated when I was

45:53.200 --> 45:58.640
working from home for a company was that white space between meetings was just such a killer

45:58.640 --> 46:02.280
because I couldn't start anything because I had a meeting in an hour and I just got

46:02.280 --> 46:06.520
out of a meeting or something like that, a half hour, whatever it might be, or two hours

46:06.520 --> 46:07.520
even.

46:07.520 --> 46:09.080
It's just you really don't want to get in the groove of something if you're going to

46:09.080 --> 46:12.120
have to stop in an hour and 45 minutes if it takes you a half hour to 15 minutes or

46:12.120 --> 46:13.400
whatever to get in the groove.

46:13.400 --> 46:14.400
And that killed me.

46:14.400 --> 46:19.360
And the way I kind of overcame that, and it's not all that surprising, is I just started

46:19.360 --> 46:23.760
blocking out more time and started rejecting a few meetings.

46:23.760 --> 46:27.560
And I was surprised how far I could take that, but that is not good advice necessarily.

46:27.560 --> 46:31.960
But sometimes your own mental health is worth it and that's just something to consider.

46:31.960 --> 46:35.120
And I'd love to know your tips and tricks for managing and mitigating this kind of

46:35.120 --> 46:38.360
stuff out there if you've kind of tackled this and come out on the other end of this

46:38.360 --> 46:42.960
and have some wisdom to share or have any comments or questions on anything we've talked

46:42.960 --> 46:47.160
about or anything you want to get in the show, please go to coder.show.com and share that

46:47.160 --> 46:48.160
with us.

46:48.160 --> 46:50.960
We have a contact form there you can fill out and it'll get right into our inboxes.

46:50.960 --> 46:55.240
Both of us see it and then we try to read most of them on the air or try to reply to

46:55.240 --> 46:57.760
them directly if we can.

46:57.760 --> 47:00.440
Also a big thank you to our Coder QA team out there.

47:18.640 --> 47:20.960

47:20.960 --> 47:23.920
Mr. Dominic's on social media.

47:23.920 --> 47:24.920

He's at Dumanuco and his company is at the Mad Botter Inc.

47:27.880 --> 47:29.400
Anything else you want to mention, Mike?

47:29.400 --> 47:31.240
Yes, I'm opening a new company.

47:31.240 --> 47:33.880
It's called the year of the Windows 7 desktop.

47:33.880 --> 47:36.280
Hey man, that was a classic.

47:36.280 --> 47:37.760
Just login themes for sure.

47:37.760 --> 47:40.400
And we're going to do everything in real basic.

47:40.400 --> 47:42.240
All right.

47:42.240 --> 47:47.160
