00:20.560 --> 00:24.500
art and business of software development and the world of technology.

My name is Chris, but really, I'm here to make our host shine.

00:44.060 --> 00:45.060
It's Mr. Dominic.

00:45.060 --> 00:46.060
Hello, Mike.

00:46.060 --> 00:47.060
Hello, Chris.

00:47.060 --> 00:50.720
And can I say happy Victory Oracle Day?

00:50.720 --> 00:52.240
Oh, yeah, right.

00:52.240 --> 00:55.240
Big congratulations, right, to the folks over at Oracle.

00:55.240 --> 00:56.240
Wait, what?

00:56.240 --> 00:57.240
Wait, wait, wait.

00:57.240 --> 00:58.240
Hold on.

00:58.240 --> 00:59.440
Updated news item here.

00:59.440 --> 01:00.440
Hold on, Mr. Dominic.

01:00.440 --> 01:01.440
Hold on.

01:01.440 --> 01:02.440
Oh, no, no, no, no.

01:02.440 --> 01:03.440
Oh, no, no.

01:03.440 --> 01:04.440
I got this.

01:04.440 --> 01:05.440
F*** you, Larry Ellison.

01:05.440 --> 01:06.440
Yeah.

01:06.440 --> 01:10.600
It is definitely a victory day for the folks over at Google.

01:10.600 --> 01:13.800
We kid that it's a boy.

01:13.800 --> 01:18.320
This is a story that has been like 10 years in the making, right?

01:18.320 --> 01:19.320
Just about.

01:19.320 --> 01:24.000
And finally came to a conclusion today, but I'm left with questions.

01:24.000 --> 01:25.000
God.

01:25.000 --> 01:26.880
Oh, can we just take the win for once?

01:26.880 --> 01:28.920
Can we just take the God damn win?

01:28.920 --> 01:31.880
I didn't think it was going to happen, but we'll get there first.

01:31.880 --> 01:34.440
I want to know if it's true or not.

01:34.440 --> 01:35.560
Did you buy another HomePod?

01:35.560 --> 01:37.940
No, because I couldn't goddamn find one.

01:37.940 --> 01:39.680
What made you decide to buy a third HomePod?

01:39.680 --> 01:41.040
Two, I get.

01:41.040 --> 01:45.080
Three, well, might as well get four at that point and have another stereo pair.

01:45.080 --> 01:46.080
You know what?

01:46.080 --> 01:48.720
The HomePod is just significantly better than the Sonos.

01:48.720 --> 01:49.720
It is, isn't it?

01:49.720 --> 01:51.000
If you have iOS devices.

01:51.000 --> 01:52.280
Yeah, that is true.

01:52.280 --> 01:53.280
All right.

01:53.280 --> 01:54.280
Well, I just thought I'd have to find out.

01:54.280 --> 01:59.000
I had to because I'm trying to now the trouble is, like, I'm at the point where I don't

01:59.000 --> 02:04.440
they make the HomePod anymore and maybe lower the price to a more, you know, sane level

02:04.440 --> 02:09.480
because I would totally buy I mean, honestly, if I had a multilevel residence or like a

02:09.480 --> 02:13.840
place with a basement, I could be good for five or six HomePods.

02:13.840 --> 02:18.320
All right, now listen, stay a while and listen.

02:18.320 --> 02:20.040
Oh, Decker game.

02:20.040 --> 02:21.040
There you are.

02:21.040 --> 02:22.040
I know.

02:22.040 --> 02:23.040
It's nice, isn't it?

02:23.040 --> 02:24.040
You got to work him in every now and then.

02:24.040 --> 02:25.040
I have a robe update.

02:25.040 --> 02:27.640
I have a very exciting robe update.

02:27.640 --> 02:32.720
So I thought maybe I'd talk a little bit about this because this was an area that I think

02:32.720 --> 02:36.380
is interesting from a small business standpoint and managing your small business.

02:36.380 --> 02:37.640
So I'll come back to that.

02:37.640 --> 02:46.760
But quickly, the update is domestic and US orders should start arriving around May 19th,

02:46.760 --> 02:48.160
May 20th.

02:48.160 --> 02:53.640
We didn't quite make the window and the materials got used and had to be reordered because of

02:53.640 --> 02:57.640
some of the issues that held up the order, which are related to international troubles.

02:57.640 --> 03:00.080
Now, international orders stand by.

03:00.080 --> 03:01.800
I'll have more news for you next week.

03:01.800 --> 03:03.360
We're still trying our best to work that out.

03:03.360 --> 03:07.920
I may have bad news, but either way, we'll get in touch with you as we try to sort that

03:07.920 --> 03:08.920
boy.

03:08.920 --> 03:10.640
A lot of lessons learned.

03:10.640 --> 03:16.560
I have rethought a lot of things and I'm also very excited that we actually have a like

03:16.560 --> 03:20.840
a ship date or an arrival date, perhaps for the robes.

03:20.840 --> 03:26.940
But I feel like as a business, I'm rethinking my entire strategy around swag.

03:26.940 --> 03:30.760
And I think what, when I look back at this as sort of like a post-mortem, I think one

03:30.760 --> 03:39.340
of the primary problems I had was I was attempting to do something that was really, really outside

03:39.340 --> 03:42.760
the norm for like my first thing.

03:42.760 --> 03:48.600
And additionally, I couldn't work with a shop that like shipping internationally was like

03:48.600 --> 03:53.240
the thing they did because of how unique this particular thing was.

03:53.240 --> 03:58.560
And so they were a domestic operation who generally would like just send like a hundred

03:58.560 --> 04:01.000
or 200 units to me.

04:01.000 --> 04:03.860
And then I would ship them out to everybody around the world.

04:03.860 --> 04:06.440
That's generally the type of customer they have.

04:06.440 --> 04:10.920
And instead I was trying to get them to send it everywhere in the world, which they can

04:10.920 --> 04:13.180
do, but it's not their core competency.

04:13.180 --> 04:18.180
And as a result of that, I didn't appreciate how much that would matter.

04:18.180 --> 04:24.600
But now I understand that it seems like for the kind of thing I want to do and to ship

04:24.600 --> 04:29.880
internationally at reasonable rates, because some of these rates to like anybody who lived

04:29.880 --> 04:36.120
in Germany, the original pricing we were working with was $150 of shipping per robe.

04:36.120 --> 04:37.120
Holy crap.

04:37.120 --> 04:38.120
Yeah.

04:38.120 --> 04:42.940
The cheapest international shipping we had was $95.

04:42.940 --> 04:52.120
So it was a range between $95 and almost $200 with the exception of Canada, which is like

04:52.120 --> 04:56.720
$85.

04:56.720 --> 04:58.160
So now we're trying to sort that out.

04:58.160 --> 05:03.800
And it was clear to me what would really work a lot better for an operation like JB who

05:03.800 --> 05:07.680
operates out of the States, but has a worldwide audience that represents a significant portion

05:07.680 --> 05:08.760
of its audience.

05:08.760 --> 05:13.960
I have to build up some sort of operation where we're printing the shipping labels and

05:13.960 --> 05:18.040
slapping them on boxes and boxing them up here and then dropping them off at the post

05:18.040 --> 05:20.280
office and they're shipping them off.

05:20.280 --> 05:22.180
And I'm just not there yet.

05:22.180 --> 05:24.960
So I try to get another company to do that part for me.

05:24.960 --> 05:31.780
And the way they operate it is the way the type of drop shipping they do is they need

05:31.780 --> 05:38.520
all the shipping information and get every robe's destination and then come back with

05:38.520 --> 05:39.520
a quote.

05:39.520 --> 05:43.960
And then of course there's tons of back and forth and trying to find alternative fulfillment

05:43.960 --> 05:48.620
places and all that kind of stuff, which is where we're at right now for the international.

05:48.620 --> 05:54.940
But the domestic orders, what we decided to do was break those off into their own original

05:54.940 --> 05:59.920
order set from the original supplier and just get those out and going while we sort out

05:59.920 --> 06:00.920
the rest of it.

06:00.920 --> 06:05.520
I mean, I learned a lot and I think I've internalized a new strategy for the company and how we're

06:05.520 --> 06:07.220
going to learn how to do this.

06:07.220 --> 06:09.640
I can't just start selling swag.

06:09.640 --> 06:13.720
I can't just turn on a switch and all of a sudden I'm like, you know, stocking swag

06:13.720 --> 06:16.520
and boxing swag and shipping swag.

06:16.520 --> 06:17.520
First of all, it sounds like hell.

06:17.520 --> 06:19.000
And second of all, I have no idea what I'm doing.

06:19.000 --> 06:21.040
And third of all, I have no inventory.

06:21.040 --> 06:28.080
I have to figure out how to get that skill set while not bankrupting the company because

06:28.080 --> 06:32.580
things could go really simple where like I pre-order a hundred robes for a second patch,

06:32.580 --> 06:36.000
stock them here at the studio and then never get them shipped out or never get, you know,

06:36.000 --> 06:37.960
like I could just so many ways I could screw this up.

06:37.960 --> 06:44.480
So I have to build institutional knowledge while not screwing the pooch and keeping the

06:44.480 --> 06:48.360
train on the tracks while we try to build up this new aspect of the business.

06:48.360 --> 06:53.000
But I feel like my lessons learned here are if I want to be serious about how to do this,

06:53.000 --> 06:57.360
I'm going to have to be kind of responsible for at least, at least like, like maybe what

06:57.360 --> 06:59.240
I would do, I guess I'll say it, put it this way.

06:59.240 --> 07:04.460
If I were going to do this again, I would take pre-orders and I would like make, I would

07:04.460 --> 07:05.960
just order 200 robes.

07:05.960 --> 07:09.680
And then once 200 robes were sold, that's as many as we had.

07:09.680 --> 07:13.840
We could do a second batch if we wanted, but I would, and then I would box them up and

07:13.840 --> 07:22.680
ship them out myself with like a label printer and like, you know, on a specific day, a couple

07:22.680 --> 07:26.360
of us are here at the studio boxing things up, loading the car and sending it out a couple

07:26.360 --> 07:27.360
of times a week.

07:27.360 --> 07:28.600
And that's what I would do this time around.

07:28.600 --> 07:33.360
And then, you know, and then maybe open up another 200 orders or something, but I'm just

07:33.360 --> 07:34.360
not there yet.

07:34.360 --> 07:36.360
Or don't do it at all.

07:36.360 --> 07:37.360
Right.

07:37.360 --> 07:38.360
Robes were a stupid idea.

07:38.360 --> 07:39.360
Yep.

07:39.360 --> 07:40.360
Yep.

07:40.360 --> 07:41.360
You shouldn't have done them.

07:41.360 --> 07:42.360
Nope.

07:42.360 --> 07:43.360
Nope.

07:43.360 --> 07:44.360
I warned you.

07:44.360 --> 07:48.400
I was, I felt like a good challenge would, would force me to dive deep into this and

07:48.400 --> 07:50.880
like I'd have to solve it in route.

07:50.880 --> 07:52.360
And that might be true.

07:52.360 --> 07:55.040
Unless we got Reese and Dylan and Abigail, right?

07:55.040 --> 07:58.160
Their daughter, are you talking about, you're talking about a ham slice in the channel?

07:58.160 --> 07:59.160
No, yeah.

07:59.160 --> 08:01.480
We just enslaved the kids and make them box all the ropes.

08:01.480 --> 08:02.480
Oh yeah.

08:02.480 --> 08:03.720
I'm totally going to enlist the kids.

08:03.720 --> 08:04.720
Oh yeah.

08:04.720 --> 08:05.720
For sure.

08:05.720 --> 08:06.720
Like, I mean, I have a 14 year old brother.

08:06.720 --> 08:07.720
He just turned 14.

08:07.720 --> 08:09.720
Um, I'm totally cool with child labor.

08:09.720 --> 08:10.880
I just make it fun somehow.

08:10.880 --> 08:15.160
I'd figure out a way, you know, play some music, make a game out of it.

08:15.160 --> 08:16.160
We need to learn.

08:16.160 --> 08:17.740
No, no, no, no, no, no, listen.

08:17.740 --> 08:20.920
My first job was a janitor when I was in high school.

08:20.920 --> 08:25.400
And uh, for all my young men in the audience, you think girls are neat and clean, clean

08:25.400 --> 08:27.160
a ladies room.

08:27.160 --> 08:29.280
It will change your life.

08:29.280 --> 08:31.080
Should have done something much simpler.

08:31.080 --> 08:32.080
Like a t-shirt.

08:32.080 --> 08:33.080
That'd have been easy.

08:33.080 --> 08:34.080
Could have done a lot of t-shirts.

08:34.080 --> 08:35.080
T-shirts suck.

08:35.080 --> 08:36.080
They do suck.

08:36.080 --> 08:37.080
That was what it was.

08:37.080 --> 08:38.880
I'm so bored of typical swag.

08:38.880 --> 08:40.960
Let me just fix your problem for you.

08:40.960 --> 08:44.420
Do the coder radio beer glass.

08:44.420 --> 08:45.600
Like a Stein kind of thing.

08:45.600 --> 08:46.600
That's an internet.

08:46.600 --> 08:47.600
Yeah.

08:47.600 --> 08:48.600
Okay.

08:48.600 --> 08:50.880
I was even being like lazier than that, but if we can pull off a Stein, that's even better.

08:50.880 --> 08:51.880
Yeah.

08:51.880 --> 08:52.880
That's kind of love 400 thing, you know?

08:52.880 --> 08:53.960
I mean, I'm just saying.

08:53.960 --> 08:54.960
They're hippies anyway.

08:54.960 --> 08:55.960
What are they going to care?

08:55.960 --> 08:56.960
That's true.

08:56.960 --> 08:57.960
What do they even know over there?

08:57.960 --> 08:58.960
Nothing.

08:58.960 --> 09:03.840
I have been actually legitimately looking for like a supplier of, of mugs or cups that

09:03.840 --> 09:06.280
have like a ring around the bottom that prevent tipping.

09:06.280 --> 09:10.400
I mean, if you could get an actual Stein with a hinge on it, that'd be pretty cool.

09:10.400 --> 09:11.400
That would be cool.

09:11.400 --> 09:13.520
But I feel like that's going to have the same problem as the ropes.

09:13.520 --> 09:14.520
I don't know.

09:14.520 --> 09:15.520
Yeah.

09:15.520 --> 09:19.320
And plus, plus shipping something breakable like that probably isn't a good first, uh,

09:19.320 --> 09:20.320
yeah.

09:20.320 --> 09:21.320
Okay.

09:21.320 --> 09:22.320
All right.

09:22.320 --> 09:23.320
All right.

09:23.320 --> 09:24.320
Fine.

09:24.320 --> 09:25.320
Fine.

09:25.320 --> 09:26.320
Fine.

09:26.320 --> 09:27.320
I don't want to dare.

09:27.320 --> 09:28.320
I dare.

09:28.320 --> 09:29.320
I touch the luck monks of feudal Linux observance.

09:29.320 --> 09:30.320
Right.

09:30.320 --> 09:33.560
How about this quarter radio martini glass?

09:33.560 --> 09:34.560
That's right.

09:34.560 --> 09:35.560
On brand.

09:35.560 --> 09:36.560
That's actually very on brand.

09:36.560 --> 09:37.560
I'm just going to say.

09:37.560 --> 09:38.560
Yeah.

09:38.560 --> 09:39.560
Yeah.

09:39.560 --> 09:40.560
That sounds great.

09:40.560 --> 09:43.240
And I can tell you, I do mad butter or martini glasses and that is not very hard.

09:43.240 --> 09:44.240
So.

09:44.240 --> 09:45.240
Hmm.

09:45.240 --> 09:46.240
All right.

09:46.240 --> 09:47.240
All right.

09:47.240 --> 09:48.240
I'm filing that one away.

09:48.240 --> 09:49.240
Okay.

09:49.240 --> 09:50.240
I could see it.

09:50.240 --> 09:52.160
I could see the glass too, like a stir or something.

09:52.160 --> 09:53.160
I don't know.

09:53.160 --> 09:54.280
But anyway, so thank you everybody.

09:54.280 --> 09:58.400
I am going to get these robes figured out and then I'm going to make some like lessons

09:58.400 --> 10:00.880
learned plans that they'll share with everybody.

10:00.880 --> 10:04.680
I went from a business standpoint, I'm going to do in the future, but that's the robe update

10:04.680 --> 10:05.680
for now.

10:05.680 --> 10:12.040
It's just, it's been way more than I expected, although, uh, I did, I do totally acknowledge

10:12.040 --> 10:13.440
I brought it all on myself.

10:13.440 --> 10:14.880
I do this to myself.

10:14.880 --> 10:16.480
It is completely my fault.

10:16.480 --> 10:17.760
I acknowledge that.

10:17.760 --> 10:21.480
I am excited to say robe, Rose in the U S you'll be receiving, you'll be receiving your

10:21.480 --> 10:22.760
robe soon.

10:22.760 --> 10:28.640
Those of you internationally, you'll be hearing from us either with bad news or, uh, an alternative

10:28.640 --> 10:34.320
source or perhaps, perhaps we will be just absolutely forced to do a round two.

10:34.320 --> 10:35.320
I don't know.

10:35.320 --> 10:36.320
I don't know.

10:36.320 --> 10:37.320
I mean, maybe, maybe more robes will be demanded.

10:37.320 --> 10:38.320
You know, we get a lot of emails in.

10:38.320 --> 10:41.040
I feel like you're just making an excuse to do more robes.

10:41.040 --> 10:46.040
I think this whole, like you just saying you're going to do more robes.

10:46.040 --> 10:48.640
Personally, I kind of want to be done with the robe.

10:48.640 --> 10:49.640
It's been a lot.

10:49.640 --> 10:52.200
I don't believe you.

10:52.200 --> 10:55.160
And here's what's going to happen in June.

10:55.160 --> 10:59.560
I'm going to start selling mad botter swag on here because you know what I deliver, you

10:59.560 --> 11:00.560
know why I deliver?

11:00.560 --> 11:02.160
I only sell glass and t-shirts.

11:02.160 --> 11:03.160
Yep.

11:03.160 --> 11:04.160
I know.

11:04.160 --> 11:06.600
You know, a shot glass would be easier to, would have been a lot easier shot glass would

11:06.600 --> 11:07.600
have been a lot easier.

11:07.600 --> 11:10.240
Look at Java jacks, the coder radio sippy cup.

11:10.240 --> 11:13.760
I have been looking, I've been looking something spill proof, but you know what?

11:13.760 --> 11:18.560
A lot of the things that they sell as like a rebrandable swag seem like they're targeted

11:18.560 --> 11:22.280
adults for some reason and not children.

11:22.280 --> 11:25.200
I mean, I feel there was no need for hate speech, but maybe we should just move on to

11:25.200 --> 11:27.360
the actual show.

11:27.360 --> 11:30.960
I think what we need is an artist and sippy cup created by the audience that we could

11:30.960 --> 11:33.600
mass produce or maybe only make a couple limited.

11:33.600 --> 11:34.600
You know what?

11:34.600 --> 11:38.680
The only person qualified to create a sippy cup in the world is me because I will find

11:38.680 --> 11:39.680
every flaw.

11:39.680 --> 11:40.980
There you go.

11:40.980 --> 11:42.200
You could be a good product tester.

11:42.200 --> 11:44.960
Oh, and then I think the other thing I'm going to do in the future, although I haven't worked

11:44.960 --> 11:49.440
out the details on this yet either, is I think I'm going to figure out a way that members

11:49.440 --> 11:54.080
of our shows can get discounts when they buy any of the merch that we do.

11:54.080 --> 11:55.760
Why the hell don't we have new stickers?

11:55.760 --> 11:56.760
Yeah.

11:56.760 --> 11:57.760
And stickers too.

11:57.760 --> 12:00.760
I think stickers are, I think if I'm going to be able to ship robes, I could ship stickers

12:00.760 --> 12:01.760
too.

12:01.760 --> 12:07.000
Dude, I can ship stickers and I'm usually like depressed or hungover or like wiping

12:07.000 --> 12:08.000
somebody's butt.

12:08.000 --> 12:09.000
I mean, come on.

12:09.000 --> 12:14.200
Well, stay tuned because stickers have been a topic of conversation recently.

12:14.200 --> 12:18.080
Before we move on, because we have lots of email to get to, I want to mention that our

12:18.080 --> 12:23.660
friends at a Cloud Guru have a PowerShell core for Linux admins course that I thought

12:23.660 --> 12:26.480
would be particularly useful for our audience.

12:26.480 --> 12:30.120
Now this is an intermediate level course, so you might need to know a little bit of

12:30.120 --> 12:33.680
basics around Linux, but it's really about the concepts of using PowerShell core with

12:33.680 --> 12:39.620
Linux, everything from like getting it installed on a Linux box to using commandlets and using

12:39.620 --> 12:44.920
Visual Studio code, and then you get into some of the more advanced components as well.

12:44.920 --> 12:49.320
And by the end of it, you've got a like working Docker install and SQL server running in there

12:49.320 --> 12:52.220
and you're managing Azure resources with PowerShell.

12:52.220 --> 12:56.000
If you're curious about their PowerShell core for Linux admins course, we will have a link

12:56.000 --> 13:01.960
in the show notes at coder.show slash four zero eight.

13:01.960 --> 13:03.160
Now let's get into the email.

13:03.160 --> 13:04.160
We got a lot.

13:04.160 --> 13:06.480
We had a spicy inbox this week.

13:06.480 --> 13:11.280
Not all of them made it onto the air, but James S. writes in with an idea that I have

13:11.280 --> 13:13.500
a feeling you're going to think is terrific.

13:13.500 --> 13:15.900
He says, Hey guys, I love the show.

13:15.900 --> 13:19.800
The talk about the new Apple Silicon performance in the context of development though has triggered

13:19.800 --> 13:20.920
me slightly.

13:20.920 --> 13:26.960
I've long felt that developers should be working deliberately on low to mid range hardware

13:26.960 --> 13:31.800
because otherwise it's just too easy to hide bad code behind a fast CPU.

13:31.800 --> 13:34.400
The majority of end users don't run the latest and greatest.

13:34.400 --> 13:36.080
They have older hardware.

13:36.080 --> 13:42.520
What do you think of this idea that if a developer has tons of RAM and a fast CPU, they almost

13:42.520 --> 13:47.320
always write code that feels fine on their system, but crawls on hardware that the typical

13:47.320 --> 13:48.920
end user actually has?

13:48.920 --> 13:51.960
James, I'm sure you're a lovely person and I think you're great.

13:51.960 --> 13:53.240
Thank you for listening to the show.

13:53.240 --> 13:55.200
Your idea is stupid.

13:55.200 --> 14:00.620
What a developer should do is have a good computer with a gimped VMs for testing.

14:00.620 --> 14:03.440
So the VMs should be intentionally weak to test.

14:03.440 --> 14:09.720
For instance, on my Mac, my Mac pro, I have good windows VM for dev and a very crappy

14:09.720 --> 14:11.240
windows VM for testing.

14:11.240 --> 14:16.120
And it's like a third of the RAM and a third of the GPU, you know, allocate, you know,

14:16.120 --> 14:19.360
it's VMware, something the allocation, I'm sorry, it's parallels.

14:19.360 --> 14:20.920
I actually keep saying VMware.

14:20.920 --> 14:22.240
I don't use VMware.

14:22.240 --> 14:23.240
Okay.

14:23.240 --> 14:25.280
I think I like VMware better on the Mac.

14:25.280 --> 14:31.520
I agree with your point, James, that for testing, you should use a slightly weaker hardware

14:31.520 --> 14:33.560
or significantly weaker hardware.

14:33.560 --> 14:39.720
I honestly think a good workstation with different virtual machines for different use cases is

14:39.720 --> 14:41.000
the best way.

14:41.000 --> 14:45.680
So again, Chris, I agree with this point that like when I'm testing windows software or

14:45.680 --> 14:51.600
any other kind of software, like Linux, whatever, my VMs for testing have like the minimal specs.

14:51.600 --> 14:56.080
I don't want to have like five machines because that would be great.

14:56.080 --> 14:58.000
I like your answer a little bit better than yours.

14:58.000 --> 15:04.360
My answer was I think most developers keep a lot of their older hardware around.

15:04.360 --> 15:05.360
Not me.

15:05.360 --> 15:06.360
I pour marketing.

15:06.360 --> 15:07.360
Well, yeah.

15:07.360 --> 15:08.360
Yeah, for sure.

15:08.360 --> 15:11.540
But I think some developers have like probably a couple of iterations of machines around

15:11.540 --> 15:15.680
so they can use that for this thing called Q&A where they could actually test it on the

15:15.680 --> 15:17.560
older hardware directly.

15:17.560 --> 15:21.720
I am not a fan of limiting any developer's productivity.

15:21.720 --> 15:26.560
Like if you get in the flow and you are having one of those beautiful moments, I feel like

15:26.560 --> 15:30.440
the machine should be as fricking fast as possible to let you rip.

15:30.440 --> 15:33.040
Like I buy my guys the best machines we can afford.

15:33.040 --> 15:34.040
Amen.

15:34.040 --> 15:36.920
It's the only area where I don't economize in the business.

15:36.920 --> 15:37.920
I don't.

15:37.920 --> 15:38.920
You know what?

15:38.920 --> 15:39.920
Like what?

15:39.920 --> 15:44.240
What's the stupidly dumb expensive machine that the asshole who works for me tricked

15:44.240 --> 15:47.880
me into buying for him from System76, the Oryx.

15:47.880 --> 15:49.520
Oh, that big laptop.

15:49.520 --> 15:50.520
You got the big one.

15:50.520 --> 15:51.520
Yeah.

15:51.520 --> 15:52.520
Yeah.

15:52.520 --> 15:53.520
He's got three monitors.

15:53.520 --> 15:54.520
So I'm like, this is not what was intended.

15:54.520 --> 15:55.520
He's like, I know, but I have two.

15:55.520 --> 15:56.880
I have a giant GPU.

15:56.880 --> 15:57.880
Like you don't need a GPU.

15:57.880 --> 16:00.920
He's like, I know, but you're part of it anyway, you stupid bastard.

16:00.920 --> 16:05.080
Hey, man, you want smooth window manager animations.

16:05.080 --> 16:06.200
Let's be honest.

16:06.200 --> 16:07.200
That stuff matters.

16:07.200 --> 16:10.560
It still crashes if he runs an extension.

16:10.560 --> 16:11.560
That's too soon.

16:11.560 --> 16:12.560
It's too soon.

16:12.560 --> 16:15.880
I actually have big news on that front later in the show.

16:15.880 --> 16:16.880
You're pregnant.

16:16.880 --> 16:17.880
No.

16:17.880 --> 16:20.680
In the genome shell related world that I want to get your take on.

16:20.680 --> 16:24.000
But I think I think VMs are a good answer to the trolling aside, right?

16:24.000 --> 16:27.600
Like the question is, if you're a company, right?

16:27.600 --> 16:32.560
If you're like someone like me where you have you employ devs, it makes sense to buy them

16:32.560 --> 16:37.560
a higher spec machine than have them test in virtual machines that are intentionally

16:37.560 --> 16:38.560
slow.

16:38.560 --> 16:43.960
If you're like one guy, though, obviously keep your old machines back and just test

16:43.960 --> 16:44.960
on those.

16:44.960 --> 16:45.960
Right.

16:45.960 --> 16:49.360
You don't need to buy a crazy iMac Pro that will be obsolete by your MacBook Air within

16:49.360 --> 16:51.240
two years because Apple's evil.

16:51.240 --> 16:52.600
What was I talking about?

16:52.600 --> 16:57.200
Ron writes in, he says, hey, talking about Apple's gross, Dear Coder Radio, there are

16:57.200 --> 16:59.300
two kinds of people who use Apple.

16:59.300 --> 17:04.400
Number one, the technologically illiterate and number two, the insecure.

17:04.400 --> 17:09.320
Group one is terrified of computers and group two is terrified of coffee shop laptop shaming.

17:09.320 --> 17:12.200
Let's debunk some Apple fanboy myths.

17:12.200 --> 17:16.680
Now, I don't know if Ron's trolling us because he spelled fanboy with an I, which I think

17:16.680 --> 17:18.440
I don't know if he's trying to be.

17:18.440 --> 17:25.720
Yeah, he writes the last time I spent 20 hours away from a power source was never so implying

17:25.720 --> 17:27.520
you don't need long battery life.

17:27.520 --> 17:29.920
Well, I have I've definitely done that, but keep going.

17:29.920 --> 17:30.920
Yeah, I know.

17:30.920 --> 17:33.480
And it's like if you've ever gone to an event.

17:33.480 --> 17:35.360
Do you speak at conferences ever?

17:35.360 --> 17:40.480
Yeah, a conference like the battery life, especially when you get to that stupid moment

17:40.480 --> 17:44.760
where you realize you didn't charge, you left your laptop in your bag overnight.

17:44.760 --> 17:46.200
You get there to do the talk.

17:46.200 --> 17:47.260
You didn't plug it in.

17:47.260 --> 17:53.680
And because Apple only lets you have a couple of USB-C ports, you're really in a tight spot.

17:53.680 --> 17:57.140
But battery life matters a lot for me, too, because I spend a lot of weekends completely

17:57.140 --> 18:01.080
off grid where I am only generating power that comes from the sun.

18:01.080 --> 18:04.080
Sometimes in the Pacific Northwest, there's not a lot of sun.

18:04.080 --> 18:05.680
And I'm usually on a Coke bender.

18:05.680 --> 18:06.680
So, yeah, right.

18:06.680 --> 18:07.680
Of course.

18:07.680 --> 18:09.680
And who's going to bother plugging in when you're on a bender?

18:09.680 --> 18:13.080
He says syncing digital content across devices has never been easier.

18:13.080 --> 18:14.760
I cloud isn't needed.

18:14.760 --> 18:17.120
He set up next cloud in ten minutes.

18:17.120 --> 18:20.920
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

18:20.920 --> 18:21.920
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

18:21.920 --> 18:22.920
Ten minutes.

18:22.920 --> 18:23.920
He had next cloud going in ten minutes.

18:23.920 --> 18:24.920
You were wrong when you said next cloud, but keep going.

18:24.920 --> 18:29.760
I mean, this is this is a common thing that I think is hard for our community to understand.

18:29.760 --> 18:33.560
A lot of people have no interest in doing that, even if they have the technical capability

18:33.560 --> 18:34.560
of doing it.

18:34.560 --> 18:35.560
They don't care.

18:35.560 --> 18:36.560
Yeah.

18:36.560 --> 18:40.880
He says staying productive during renders is not about hoping things get faster on the

18:40.880 --> 18:41.880
M1.

18:41.880 --> 18:42.880
It's about organizing your workflow.

18:42.880 --> 18:48.320
My custom PC used for content creation will scorch any Mac in existence.

18:48.320 --> 18:49.320
Wrong.

18:49.320 --> 18:50.320
Stop.

18:50.320 --> 18:51.320
Custom PC.

18:51.320 --> 18:52.320
Yeah.

18:52.320 --> 18:53.320
Wrong.

18:53.320 --> 18:54.320
Right.

18:54.320 --> 18:55.320
Because most people are not buying custom.

18:55.320 --> 18:56.320
They're not customizing their PCs.

18:56.320 --> 18:57.320
Yeah.

18:57.320 --> 19:02.920
So what I think guys like Ron kind of they don't look at the actual market and go, oh,

19:02.920 --> 19:09.560
like there must be a reason why a guy like Marques Brownlee buys the Mac Pro.

19:09.560 --> 19:10.560
Right.

19:10.560 --> 19:12.680
Because, I mean, I'm sure he doesn't like burning money.

19:12.680 --> 19:13.760
He'd rather probably buy that.

19:13.760 --> 19:16.240
He'd rather spend that money on the next Tesla.

19:16.240 --> 19:17.240
He's you know, why?

19:17.240 --> 19:19.960
So why are they buying that Mac Pro?

19:19.960 --> 19:22.760
And the reality is Final Cut.

19:22.760 --> 19:24.080
It's Final Cut.

19:24.080 --> 19:26.300
It's if you ask them, they will tell you.

19:26.300 --> 19:27.680
It's because of Final Cut Pro 10.

19:27.680 --> 19:29.440
Well, this is a developer show.

19:29.440 --> 19:35.480
The reason I buy only System 76 and Macs for my guys is because I know out of the box with

19:35.480 --> 19:38.120
either of those machines, they can get up and running.

19:38.120 --> 19:39.120
Right.

19:39.120 --> 19:40.560
My biggest expense is pay.

19:40.560 --> 19:43.440
And then additionally, like if one of those guys leaves and you want to move that machine

19:43.440 --> 19:47.200
to somebody else, do you want to move them some weird custom built PC or do you?

19:47.200 --> 19:51.560
No, I want to wipe it and put Pop OS whatever or Mac OS whatever.

19:51.560 --> 19:54.880
And then you scale that up for like any company that has like an IT department with a bunch

19:54.880 --> 19:55.880
of employees.

19:55.880 --> 19:58.920
It's just not scalable to do custom PCs.

19:58.920 --> 20:01.760
The custom PCs are, I mean, bully for you.

20:01.760 --> 20:02.760
No, that's great.

20:02.760 --> 20:04.120
Seriously for you.

20:04.120 --> 20:09.640
But when you have like if I was just a solo shop, honestly, I probably would have a custom

20:09.640 --> 20:10.840
PC.

20:10.840 --> 20:17.760
There's still a group of individuals out there who think that what's selling Apple and why

20:17.760 --> 20:21.920
Apple is one of the most valuable companies in the world is because of marketing and fan

20:21.920 --> 20:22.920
boys.

20:22.920 --> 20:24.360
And I don't really need to dwell on it.

20:24.360 --> 20:27.800
I don't think it's, I mean, but I think it's worth realizing that sometimes we can have

20:27.800 --> 20:30.940
real blinders on to what seems to drive the market.

20:30.940 --> 20:35.840
What seems to really drive the market seems to be battery life and performance and I would

20:35.840 --> 20:37.120
say visual appeal.

20:37.120 --> 20:42.160
And then it's something that we don't quite grok as a community is the entire package,

20:42.160 --> 20:43.160
right?

20:43.160 --> 20:44.160
It's a product.

20:44.160 --> 20:51.240
The cloud services and the fancy Apple sales, everything is part of an entire product.

20:51.240 --> 20:53.920
When you roll your own next cloud, that's awesome.

20:53.920 --> 20:57.000
And I have two, I have two next cloud servers.

20:57.000 --> 20:58.000
It's great.

20:58.000 --> 21:00.880
The reality is though, that's not a whole product.

21:00.880 --> 21:05.760
You built a custom PC, you loaded your own Linux on there and built it up just the way

21:05.760 --> 21:06.980
you like it.

21:06.980 --> 21:12.800
And then you set up next cloud to do your syncing and you did it all on your own.

21:12.800 --> 21:13.800
And that's fantastic.

21:13.800 --> 21:18.520
I host a show with Alex called Self Hosted because I love that stuff.

21:18.520 --> 21:24.840
But I have to be aware that the vast, vast majority of the market, like the significant

21:24.840 --> 21:29.120
total vast majority of the market doesn't do that kind of stuff.

21:29.120 --> 21:31.640
And so they need a solution that works well for them.

21:31.640 --> 21:36.860
And the better and faster that solution is, the overall more people are, their technology

21:36.860 --> 21:38.420
experience is improved.

21:38.420 --> 21:43.640
It's easy to dismiss this stuff, but I think it actually, it deserves important consideration.

21:43.640 --> 21:49.080
And then the next questions start to become like, well, how do I make money on this reality?

21:49.080 --> 21:52.400
Like if I want to have a business in software development and this is the reality of the

21:52.400 --> 21:54.480
market, how do I make money on it?

21:54.480 --> 21:58.640
I think that's a fair question to ask too, but maybe it's not.

21:58.640 --> 22:01.920
Maybe your question is, and I'm not saying it is for everybody, but I'm saying often

22:01.920 --> 22:04.200
in the context of the show, that's how we talk about it.

22:04.200 --> 22:06.520
Maybe it's just, how can I have fun with it?

22:06.520 --> 22:10.800
And Ron, that might be the area you're in and you can be wired to a wall and you never

22:10.800 --> 22:15.840
have to go anywhere mobile and you can spend the time to set up Nextcloud and configure

22:15.840 --> 22:19.560
your Android client to sync with your KDE desktop and man, more power to you.

22:19.560 --> 22:23.060
I wish I had more time to do that stuff because I love doing that stuff too.

22:23.060 --> 22:28.880
But you and I, my friend, we are a rare breed and we may be even fewer and fewer in some

22:28.880 --> 22:35.200
ways, at least compared to the overall growth of the mobile and technology market.

22:35.200 --> 22:36.600
Next one comes in from Alex.

22:36.600 --> 22:40.360
Now for him, the Linux desktop just isn't worth the hassle.

22:40.360 --> 22:42.240
He says, first of all, love the show.

22:42.240 --> 22:43.240
You guys are great.

22:43.240 --> 22:47.080
He goes on to compliment us for a bit, but I'm going to skip over that, but I really

22:47.080 --> 22:48.080
appreciate it.

22:48.080 --> 22:49.080
Thank you, Alex.

22:49.080 --> 22:50.080
It's not you.

22:50.080 --> 22:51.080
It's me.

22:51.080 --> 22:52.080
Yes, I got it.

22:52.080 --> 22:53.080
He says, you're great.

22:53.080 --> 22:54.080
And I just don't want to talk about it.

22:54.080 --> 22:55.080
You know, like we focus on it too much.

22:55.080 --> 22:56.080
Geez.

22:56.080 --> 22:57.080
No.

22:57.080 --> 22:59.280
He says, some time ago you asked people to tell you about their work setups.

22:59.280 --> 23:01.440
Remember when we came back, we did that for a little bit.

23:01.440 --> 23:06.120
He says he proudly wrote in about his high end Dell 7 series, 7000 series laptop running

23:06.120 --> 23:08.440
Ubuntu 1804 and i3.

23:08.440 --> 23:11.140
The thing is I really wanted this setup to work.

23:11.140 --> 23:15.920
My employer insists on using some commercial VPN software as well as some other office

23:15.920 --> 23:19.600
software that only runs on windows, but I had it working for a bit.

23:19.600 --> 23:23.140
I felt kind of like the hacker movie version of a developer spitting up new borderless

23:23.140 --> 23:27.600
terminals and i3 and switching workspaces all while never really leaving the keyboard.

23:27.600 --> 23:32.000
I felt productive, but then one day when going to our support desk, trying to get some Linux

23:32.000 --> 23:37.860
corner case fixed, the staff member most knowledgeable on Linux was out and I had a full day of work

23:37.860 --> 23:38.960
ahead of me.

23:38.960 --> 23:44.120
So the solution they provided me was a used Mac.

23:44.120 --> 23:51.020
What I got was a late 2020 Mac Pro fully decked out, i7, 32 gigs of RAM, one terabyte SSD.

23:51.020 --> 23:53.720
And the amazing thing is it doesn't really seem to get all that hot and I don't really

23:53.720 --> 23:58.120
hear the fans to the point where they're audible, even when running Docker or VMs.

23:58.120 --> 24:04.680
I did disable turbo boost, but here's the kicker, Docker for Mac works amazing on this

24:04.680 --> 24:06.000
Intel Mac.

24:06.000 --> 24:11.080
And I just brew install all the GNU core utilities and just eat the annoyance of some of the

24:11.080 --> 24:12.080
brew limitations.

24:12.080 --> 24:18.160
And I'm not really looking back, the setups working really well for me.

24:18.160 --> 24:22.440
And he goes on to mention how he had some problems with gaming, but he decided, you

24:22.440 --> 24:25.000
know, really for that, maybe I should just set up a windows 10 box.

24:25.000 --> 24:30.040
In conclusion, I'm kind of embarrassed to say that I've ended up leaving desktop Linux

24:30.040 --> 24:31.040
behind.

24:31.040 --> 24:35.460
It of course is the only answer for server side work, but my dumb terminal interface

24:35.460 --> 24:43.960
to it is, well, a shiny, expensive, but effective gray slab from the guys in Cupertino, Alex.

24:43.960 --> 24:48.120
That's hard for me to hear, I have to say, as somebody who's been using desktop Linux

24:48.120 --> 24:49.120
for a very long time.

24:49.120 --> 24:55.020
I know you have a religious objection to computers that actually work, but yeah, this is why

24:55.020 --> 24:58.720
Max, this is why there will be no year of Linux desktop, right?

24:58.720 --> 25:02.160
You don't see a lot of people doing blog posts and YouTube videos about switching away from

25:02.160 --> 25:03.160
Linux, right?

25:03.160 --> 25:07.880
There's a lot of blog posts and hacker news stories about switching to Linux.

25:07.880 --> 25:10.800
Let me tell you, how many of them do the blog posts about switching back?

25:10.800 --> 25:13.640
I mean, I'm on an iMac Pro right now.

25:13.640 --> 25:17.600
Sometimes you see it, but you don't see a lot, but I've done several of those blog posts

25:17.600 --> 25:19.560
and I'm on an iMac Pro, right?

25:19.560 --> 25:23.000
Just, I just hate, I hate hearing this.

25:23.000 --> 25:25.400
I really do.

25:25.400 --> 25:26.400
I hate hearing this.

25:26.400 --> 25:31.080
So I mean, I can tell you, I also have hated hearing a lot of things over the last, let's

25:31.080 --> 25:33.840
say six months and it doesn't get better.

25:33.840 --> 25:36.960
So the M1 Pro is coming out in June.

25:36.960 --> 25:37.960
Oh, geez.

25:37.960 --> 25:38.960
Too soon?

25:38.960 --> 25:39.960
Yeah.

25:39.960 --> 25:45.720
If they had a, if they had a 16 core, if they had a 16 core M1 with 32 gigs of RAM and two

25:45.720 --> 25:52.400
terabyte SSD and 27 inch plus screen, that'd be pretty tempting.

25:52.400 --> 25:56.640
The only other like shoe or whatever the term is I'd need to kind of drop would be if I

25:56.640 --> 26:02.800
even got like a whiff that like the Linux M1 support was getting dialed in and it was

26:02.800 --> 26:06.280
like, you know, within the next year it's going to be working for sure.

26:06.280 --> 26:10.080
I think I'd probably pull the trigger, but I, it doesn't mean I, there'd be, I just have,

26:10.080 --> 26:11.800
that'd be one of many machines that I have.

26:11.800 --> 26:12.800
Oh, let's backpedal.

26:12.800 --> 26:13.800
Yes, of course.

26:13.800 --> 26:14.800
No, no.

26:14.800 --> 26:19.220
It's just the reality is the reality is I'd need something mobile and I still need lots

26:19.220 --> 26:22.600
of Linux and it's not going to do those things for me cause I'm not going to get a Mac book

26:22.600 --> 26:23.600
from them.

26:23.600 --> 26:24.600
All right.

26:24.600 --> 26:25.600
All right.

26:25.600 --> 26:26.600
All right.

26:26.600 --> 26:27.600
All right.

26:27.600 --> 26:28.600
There's many, but I'm not, we'll see.

26:28.600 --> 26:29.600
We'll see.

26:29.600 --> 26:32.480
I think Apple is going to stick with the M1 for the remainder of the year and I'm not

26:32.480 --> 26:33.920
really interested in the M1 now.

26:33.920 --> 26:36.900
Now I feel like I got to hold out for something better too.

26:36.900 --> 26:38.920
So that's what I'm hunkering down for.

26:38.920 --> 26:41.580
The Fisher doth protest too much.

26:41.580 --> 26:43.440
Maybe it, I am in a weird place with it.

26:43.440 --> 26:44.440
I'll tell you that.

26:44.440 --> 26:45.440
I can feel it.

26:45.440 --> 26:46.440
It feels weird.

26:46.440 --> 26:47.440
I don't like it.

26:47.440 --> 26:49.040
I'm uncomfortable with it.

26:49.040 --> 26:54.320
And then the other thing that's hard is the lines between GNOME Shell and Mac OS are even

26:54.320 --> 26:59.440
blurrier than ever because now GNOME Shell has gone to horizontal workspace layouts and

26:59.440 --> 27:02.560
they have the same gesture as Mac OS to get to it.

27:02.560 --> 27:04.120
It's just one less finger.

27:04.120 --> 27:08.160
It's a three finger gesture instead of a four finger and they move the dock down to the

27:08.160 --> 27:14.120
bottom now and the whole thing's feeling a lot like the two, the two interfaces are colliding.

27:14.120 --> 27:16.080
It's we've been here before, Sam.

27:16.080 --> 27:17.080
Yeah.

27:17.080 --> 27:18.080
It's a weird overlap.

27:18.080 --> 27:19.080
Scott writes in though.

27:19.080 --> 27:21.560
He says, Hey, I changed my mind for JavaScript on the server.

27:21.560 --> 27:26.640
I once like Mike was just not having JavaScript on the server.

27:26.640 --> 27:30.680
I thought I should always stay in the browser on the client side.

27:30.680 --> 27:32.680
Just use it minimally.

27:32.680 --> 27:37.740
But my mind changed once I learned about server side rendering and it all clicked.

27:37.740 --> 27:42.440
This allows the server to build the fundamentals of a webpage and then just send the browser.

27:42.440 --> 27:46.760
Oh, this is not new Scott, this is not new at all.

27:46.760 --> 27:50.000
Well he says it's nice cause in the browser gets this nice little thing that it can just

27:50.000 --> 27:51.720
display really super quick.

27:51.720 --> 27:55.320
Any additional logic can be, any minimal logic can be done on the client, but the server

27:55.320 --> 27:56.640
does the bulk of the work.

27:56.640 --> 28:01.040
He says it doesn't necessarily negate the idea of flask having an API for jazz code

28:01.040 --> 28:04.840
and then load additional resources, but he thinks it might be worth considering when

28:04.840 --> 28:06.720
you consider server side rendering.

28:06.720 --> 28:08.200
You're not having it though.

28:08.200 --> 28:12.560
It's not that I'm not having it, it's that this has existed for a very long time.

28:12.560 --> 28:19.200
It's not a new idea and this is how everything like ERB and flask and ginger or I guess ginger

28:19.200 --> 28:22.160
would be the flask version of ERB.

28:22.160 --> 28:23.160
It's how it all works.

28:23.160 --> 28:29.120
The server side builds the page and puts it down to the shithole that is the web.

28:29.120 --> 28:34.520
I mean, JavaScript is a language that should not exist.

28:34.520 --> 28:36.960
I have written large things in JavaScript.

28:36.960 --> 28:41.360
I have had to just delete them and I've lost tens of thousands of dollars.

28:41.360 --> 28:42.360
You need a better language.

28:42.360 --> 28:45.320
Well, I can't argue with you.

28:45.320 --> 28:49.000
I'm not going to be, I'm not, I'm not going to die on this hill for this one.

28:49.000 --> 28:55.680
It's I get what you're saying, man, like it's convenient for what you're doing, but it's,

28:55.680 --> 28:56.680
it's not good.

28:56.680 --> 29:00.680
Like it's, it's just, geez, you know, I'm not even going to go into the history of server

29:00.680 --> 29:06.400
side rendering, but it's not a new idea and it doesn't need to be JavaScript.

29:06.400 --> 29:11.660
JavaScript is deeply compromised language we could say.

29:11.660 --> 29:21.280
It's not a pure language that has a fundamental philosophy, elegance, purity.

29:21.280 --> 29:27.800
We could say, you know, say qua machismo, even I'm just off the top of my head.

29:27.800 --> 29:34.000
I'm thinking of a language, your, my criteria, and that might be objective C obviously be

29:34.000 --> 29:35.000
a good language.

29:35.000 --> 29:37.160
JavaScript is a bad language.

29:37.160 --> 29:43.280
I think the fat cat proposes we ban JavaScript from the chat, promise you can't ban JavaScript

29:43.280 --> 29:45.720
just like you can't cure herpes.

29:45.720 --> 29:48.600
It just won't go away.

29:48.600 --> 29:52.360
He said, and then Java Jack says JavaScript is what happens when there's no competition

29:52.360 --> 29:56.640
in browser languages, spicy chat room tonight.

29:56.640 --> 29:57.800
Coder radio happy hour.

29:57.800 --> 29:58.800
I am sorry.

29:58.800 --> 30:02.360
I did start it tonight, but my moaning before the show, yes.

30:02.360 --> 30:06.360
You know, that's why you got to show up live so that way you can catch the moaning at jblive.tv

30:06.360 --> 30:13.040
on a Monday, lino.com slash coder, receive a $100 safety day credit towards your new

30:13.040 --> 30:14.040
account.

30:14.040 --> 30:16.480
Yeah, a hundred dollars, a hundred dollars.

30:16.480 --> 30:17.920
And you support the show.

30:17.920 --> 30:18.920
Linode is awesome.

30:18.920 --> 30:19.920
It's powerful.

30:19.920 --> 30:23.560
And you can simplify your cloud infrastructure with Linode's great prices and modern Linux

30:23.560 --> 30:29.000
virtual machines and tools to develop, deploy and scale applications faster and easier than

30:29.000 --> 30:30.000
ever.

30:30.000 --> 30:31.920
And what I love about Linode is they are independent.

30:31.920 --> 30:36.480
We've been around since 2003 and they are in full control.

30:36.480 --> 30:38.040
They set their own ISP up.

30:38.040 --> 30:39.120
They run their data centers.

30:39.120 --> 30:40.840
They have 11 of them around the world.

30:40.840 --> 30:45.880
Super fast connections, super fast native SSDs, and of course, 40 gigabit connections

30:45.880 --> 30:48.040
coming into each one of those machines.

30:48.040 --> 30:50.300
Linode can really help your ideas come to life on the web too.

30:50.300 --> 30:54.320
If you want to set up a personal portfolio, maybe you want to put a resume online that

30:54.320 --> 30:56.360
looks nice or a status pager.

30:56.360 --> 31:00.020
Maybe you want to host the backend infrastructure for your community's chat platform or something

31:00.020 --> 31:05.160
even else that, heck, I don't really know because I'm not you, but I know Linode can

31:05.160 --> 31:06.160
do it.

31:06.160 --> 31:11.240
They have a full range of systems, dedicated CPUs, dedicated GPUs, $5 a month systems.

31:11.240 --> 31:17.400
They're great and they're 30 to 50% cheaper than the big shops like Azure or that AWS

31:17.400 --> 31:18.400
you may have heard of.

31:18.400 --> 31:22.640
And they have features similar like S3 compatible object storage, cloud firewalls, simple one-click

31:22.640 --> 31:25.320
application deployment, and a lot more.

31:25.320 --> 31:29.200
So you should probably just go check it out for yourself and see why they are our cloud

31:29.200 --> 31:31.320
hosting provider of choice.

31:31.320 --> 31:35.260
Everything we've built and all of the things we have continued to build, it's just really

31:35.260 --> 31:37.240
gotten pretty, pretty awesome.

31:37.240 --> 31:39.060
I should do a machine count at some point.

31:39.060 --> 31:43.320
We run it all on Linode and you can too, linode.com slash coder.

31:43.320 --> 31:47.240
I found them a few years ago, started as just something I was doing on my own as a personal

31:47.240 --> 31:52.060
thing and now I use them for everything and you can too and you can support the show while

31:52.060 --> 31:58.160
getting that $100 credit at linode.com slash coder.

31:58.160 --> 32:00.280
All right, now it's time to talk about it.

32:00.280 --> 32:05.160
The Supreme Court has ruled in Google's favor in the copyright dispute with Oracle over

32:05.160 --> 32:12.720
the use of the, I think it was like 11,000 lines of code or something.

32:12.720 --> 32:20.840
Yeah, it takes back to 2010 when Oracle bought the Java, well bought Sun, and then Java came

32:20.840 --> 32:21.840
along with it.

32:21.840 --> 32:23.880
I looked back at our archives.

32:23.880 --> 32:27.680
This is the story that we've been covering for.

32:27.680 --> 32:36.480
Oh yeah, remember Oracle claimed that Google owed them $8.8 billion and $475 million in

32:36.480 --> 32:43.440
lost potential licensing revenue and then in 2016 a jury found that Google's use of

32:43.440 --> 32:47.960
that structure and sequence and organization of Java APIs was fair use but then the Court

32:47.960 --> 32:52.440
of Appeals and the Federal Circuit overturned that decision into Oracle's favor and it just

32:52.440 --> 32:54.440
went back and forth what felt like forever.

32:54.440 --> 32:58.360
And to be fair, I was initially on Oracle's side because Google literally copy pasted

32:58.360 --> 33:01.160
some of the headers and everything.

33:01.160 --> 33:04.800
But not that they couldn't use the API but that they should pay some damages for literally

33:04.800 --> 33:05.800
copy pasta.

33:05.800 --> 33:06.800
Right.

33:06.800 --> 33:07.800
Come on.

33:07.800 --> 33:11.040
Yeah, it was and the thing I think that we thought was pretty damning was the emails

33:11.040 --> 33:14.560
from the executives that kind of just said we're going to do this and we're either going

33:14.560 --> 33:17.560
to have to license it or fight them in court one day.

33:17.560 --> 33:22.000
If you remember and I did my research today, I actually did my job today, Chris, you should

33:22.000 --> 33:23.000
pat me on the back.

33:23.000 --> 33:24.000
Thank you.

33:24.000 --> 33:25.000
Just for you.

33:25.000 --> 33:26.000
I rang the bell.

33:26.000 --> 33:29.080
They could have used C sharp for free, but because they hated Microsoft, they wouldn't

33:29.080 --> 33:30.080
do it.

33:30.080 --> 33:31.080
Right?

33:31.080 --> 33:32.080
Yeah.

33:32.080 --> 33:33.080
And there was the sense back then.

33:33.080 --> 33:35.080
I mean, you remember back then when they were first starting Android, like the sense was

33:35.080 --> 33:38.200
that the whole world of these devices were going to run on Java.

33:38.200 --> 33:39.520
Well, hang on.

33:39.520 --> 33:43.960
If we're going back, there's only one gentleman that can help us.

33:43.960 --> 33:46.200
Perfect.

33:46.200 --> 33:48.920
I was thinking Deckard Cain, but you went a different direction.

33:48.920 --> 33:51.160
Oh, oh, you mean you like you want to go.

33:51.160 --> 33:52.160
You want to share.

33:52.160 --> 33:53.800
So that's that's that's story time.

33:53.800 --> 33:56.120
Stay a while and listen.

33:56.120 --> 34:01.920
Back in the day, Microsoft was actually a scary company, but now they're a little hippie

34:01.920 --> 34:06.720
company that runs Azure, but they used to put companies out of business.

34:06.720 --> 34:10.000
Yeah, kids, Microsoft was actually scary at one point.

34:10.000 --> 34:11.000
Yeah.

34:11.000 --> 34:14.480
And I guess there was also this feeling at Google that like Microsoft was the big bad

34:14.480 --> 34:15.480
guy.

34:15.480 --> 34:18.360
The world was going to run all these like I remember Blu-ray players back then were

34:18.360 --> 34:19.360
running Java.

34:19.360 --> 34:21.620
Like everything was going to be Java based.

34:21.620 --> 34:23.520
Everything that Microsoft did was bad.

34:23.520 --> 34:29.240
And I think that they figured, well, we'll we'll we'll swoop up a huge amount of developers

34:29.240 --> 34:31.280
who can already target our platform.

34:31.280 --> 34:34.200
That'll get us in the race against Apple as fast as possible.

34:34.200 --> 34:35.880
From India that are cheap, yes.

34:35.880 --> 34:39.600
But yeah, you and I both thought, boy, Oracle could win this, but it would be bad if they

34:39.600 --> 34:40.600
did.

34:40.600 --> 34:44.120
And I actually thought there was a good shot that Oracle was going to win.

34:44.120 --> 34:47.240
I couldn't really comprehend what the knock on effects of that would be.

34:47.240 --> 34:48.880
But so it's on tape, right?

34:48.880 --> 34:54.920
Like I was pretty pissed about this because I felt like just stealing Java.

34:54.920 --> 35:00.360
The problem was Google was kind of right, but I didn't like what they were doing because

35:00.360 --> 35:05.320
this is going to sound super old managed, but Objective C at the time requiring memory

35:05.320 --> 35:10.240
management allowed me just to charge a lot of money that made me very happy.

35:10.240 --> 35:13.800
It seemed like they knew there was some questionable activity to it.

35:13.800 --> 35:16.560
Like they kind of had a sense that maybe they were in a gray area.

35:16.560 --> 35:19.960
Well, in their emails, they knew.

35:19.960 --> 35:26.320
What we have here is kind of like a half decision, though, because the question is are APIs copyrightable?

35:26.320 --> 35:28.080
That's been skirted by the court here.

35:28.080 --> 35:34.860
They focused on fair use and they didn't really establish the copyright precedent.

35:34.860 --> 35:39.240
It's like the case establishes a precedent that if you're copying an API and its primary

35:39.240 --> 35:44.240
purpose is matching interface so the developers can re-implement it, you're in fair use territory,

35:44.240 --> 35:48.600
which it doesn't really answer the primary question of the copyright violation.

35:48.600 --> 35:55.160
So I have a service that copies the API for AWS S3.

35:55.160 --> 35:57.240
I have not talked about this on the show because.

35:57.240 --> 35:58.960
Oh, you mean you really do?

35:58.960 --> 35:59.960
I really do.

35:59.960 --> 36:00.960
For real.

36:00.960 --> 36:01.960
Oh, okay.

36:01.960 --> 36:02.960
That's theoretical.

36:02.960 --> 36:04.400
I've seen Bezos' pecker, let's say.

36:04.400 --> 36:05.880
Thank you, Reddit.

36:05.880 --> 36:09.080
And I'm pretty sure he would slam that right up my bum.

36:09.080 --> 36:12.000
No, you can, I mean, you can.

36:12.000 --> 36:13.280
I run an object storage.

36:13.280 --> 36:14.400
Right now, right?

36:14.400 --> 36:19.400
I could have the exact same programmable interface and my whole thing I do with this is go to

36:19.400 --> 36:24.400
people that are spending a lot of money on S3 so we can set you up in our data center.

36:24.400 --> 36:31.200
Literally, you change the API keys, you change the endpoint, the secret key, all that nonsense

36:31.200 --> 36:35.560
and bam, you're saving thousands of dollars a year.

36:35.560 --> 36:39.080
Yeah, and it can also, like in some cases, yeah, you work with a smaller business that

36:39.080 --> 36:42.240
can be more hands-on, that can be more attentive.

36:42.240 --> 36:47.280
And we can offer you added custom benefits, like whatever crazy stuff you need.

36:47.280 --> 36:52.960
So like I'm spiritually on the side of Oracle with this, but I felt like Google was so brazen

36:52.960 --> 36:53.960
in how they did it.

36:53.960 --> 36:56.520
I mean, we listened to the back catalog, folks.

36:56.520 --> 36:59.080
I was pretty rough on Google.

36:59.080 --> 37:03.480
And Chris was, I mean, Chris said Microsoft was great and we should all run Windows Vista

37:03.480 --> 37:04.480
at the time.

37:04.480 --> 37:05.480
So I don't know.

37:05.480 --> 37:08.080
I mean, like, and I did that like every episode, it was weird.

37:08.080 --> 37:13.040
I just want to say YouTube, Google, I'm sorry, Windows Action Show.

37:13.040 --> 37:19.600
Yeah, joking aside, I feel like I sort of, this is anti-climactic in a way, right?

37:19.600 --> 37:21.160
It doesn't matter.

37:21.160 --> 37:22.160
Nothing happened.

37:22.160 --> 37:24.440
Yeah, I mean, well, it matters.

37:24.440 --> 37:32.840
I think it matters in that if it had gone the other way, then it meant that implementing

37:32.840 --> 37:41.560
an identical API could have set precedent that that is a copyrightable court case that

37:41.560 --> 37:42.560
you could pursue.

37:42.560 --> 37:43.560
What are you talking about?

37:43.560 --> 37:46.040
When I was 19, I tried to open Mercury Broadcasting.

37:46.040 --> 37:52.400
But you know what I mean, like if Oracle had won, it would have set a precedent that other

37:52.400 --> 37:55.560
companies could have sued other individuals who have re-implemented their APIs.

37:55.560 --> 37:56.560
Well, hang on.

37:56.560 --> 38:03.880
If Oracle had won, then Minio as an open source project would fail, and as a company.

38:03.880 --> 38:08.600
Oracle database, which was a clone of IBM database right from the interface layer, would

38:08.600 --> 38:11.120
itself be invalid.

38:11.120 --> 38:15.440
Because let's Deckard Cain style go back here.

38:15.440 --> 38:21.600
Oracle's original business was being a clone of IBM's proprietary databases, but a little

38:21.600 --> 38:22.600
cheaper.

38:22.600 --> 38:23.600
Yeah, I hadn't thought it.

38:23.600 --> 38:24.600
You're right.

38:24.600 --> 38:25.600
I hadn't thought about that in a while.

38:25.600 --> 38:28.240
This is the courtesan calling the prostitute a whore.

38:28.240 --> 38:29.800
I mean, this is not right.

38:29.800 --> 38:36.200
Yeah, it is kind of, you know, but I guess companies change, I suppose.

38:36.200 --> 38:37.520
But there is some irony in that.

38:37.520 --> 38:38.520
It's very simple.

38:38.520 --> 38:42.720
When you're small, you have to work outside the law because you have nothing to lose.

38:42.720 --> 38:47.360
When you're big, like by the way, we don't talk about this on this show because Unfilter

38:47.360 --> 38:48.360
exists.

38:48.360 --> 38:55.320
But Facebook suggesting internet regulations is like the Nazis suggesting housing regulations.

38:55.320 --> 38:56.760
It's just not good.

38:56.760 --> 38:57.760
You don't want it.

38:57.760 --> 38:58.760
Yeah, they have lobbyists.

38:58.760 --> 39:01.880
So that's something they can shape.

39:01.880 --> 39:08.040
When I think about my feelings over the last nearly a decade of this thing, I think a piece

39:08.040 --> 39:15.720
of me wanted Google to have to pay some penance for the stunt they pulled with Android.

39:15.720 --> 39:17.880
I can't ever forgive them for Android.

39:17.880 --> 39:22.320
It is a bastardization of Linux that is horrible.

39:22.320 --> 39:25.440
And they made so many decisions in the name of adoption.

39:25.440 --> 39:26.440
It just doesn't work.

39:26.440 --> 39:31.600
Well, you go back to, remember, they were going with something that was cursor driven

39:31.600 --> 39:35.200
until they saw the iPhone event and then they switched to their Moonshot project, which

39:35.200 --> 39:36.200
was touch driven.

39:36.200 --> 39:39.420
But Android, when it first shipped, you could still dig out the cursor.

39:39.420 --> 39:41.520
It was very much still very touch focused.

39:41.520 --> 39:42.840
How about Project Butter?

39:42.840 --> 39:43.840
Right.

39:43.840 --> 39:46.080
All the time, all the times they had to address the performance.

39:46.080 --> 39:50.080
They slapped together this system that was horribly unoptimized.

39:50.080 --> 39:54.360
I mean, the early versions of Android were really bad because it was not native code

39:54.360 --> 39:55.900
running on these.

39:55.900 --> 40:01.040
So folks who are younger won't remember these ARM processors on mobile were back in the

40:01.040 --> 40:02.040
day.

40:02.040 --> 40:03.040
They were terrible.

40:03.040 --> 40:04.040
Really bad.

40:04.040 --> 40:05.040
Yeah.

40:05.040 --> 40:06.040
Yeah.

40:06.040 --> 40:08.040
The reason iPhone programming was hard and I got to make lots of money doing it is because

40:08.040 --> 40:10.240
you had no memory.

40:10.240 --> 40:12.160
It was terrible.

40:12.160 --> 40:18.140
Loading images in a list view or UI scroll view, if you will, was actually like you.

40:18.140 --> 40:23.300
People had different strategies and I'm sure you can find them on Reddit.

40:23.300 --> 40:28.120
There were blog posts debating what is the right way to load images on iOS because you

40:28.120 --> 40:30.480
didn't have the memory to do it.

40:30.480 --> 40:31.480
Come on.

40:31.480 --> 40:32.480
You know this is true.

40:32.480 --> 40:33.480
Oh yeah.

40:33.480 --> 40:34.720
And it was so much worse on Android.

40:34.720 --> 40:39.660
And then you'll recall, I don't need to recap history, but the incredible compromises they

40:39.660 --> 40:43.960
made with carriers to get great sweetheart deals with the carriers to compete with the

40:43.960 --> 40:49.520
iPhone, like allowing carriers to bastardize up the firmwares with their crappy apps and

40:49.520 --> 40:56.360
tracking that they crossed all these lines in the name of adoption that I felt like created

40:56.360 --> 41:02.720
a product that didn't learn anything from the Windows PC OEM era that makes shipping

41:02.720 --> 41:05.040
updates easy and fast and secure.

41:05.040 --> 41:12.120
And we ended up with an OS that's now in reality in the pockets of millions of consumers with

41:12.120 --> 41:17.680
out of date Linux kernels, out of date Bluetooth stacks, tons of vulnerabilities, vendors who

41:17.680 --> 41:22.600
stopped patching because they didn't have some driver licensing deal that went beyond

41:22.600 --> 41:25.640
two years so they couldn't supply updates past that.

41:25.640 --> 41:31.080
And so now it just gets no fixes and it just sits there open on the internet every single

41:31.080 --> 41:32.080
day.

41:32.080 --> 41:34.860
And there are millions of them.

41:34.860 --> 41:42.640
And then you bring in all of the crap around this that this Oracle suit, which was another

41:42.640 --> 41:49.000
example of Google cutting corners to try to get fast, quick adoption to slam something

41:49.000 --> 41:50.000
into the market.

41:50.000 --> 41:54.800
So then that way they could get all of these hardware manufacturers to switch over to their

41:54.800 --> 41:59.000
crappy platform and have a horrible fight race to the bottom.

41:59.000 --> 42:03.840
LG, by the way, just announced this week they're out of the smartphone business entirely.

42:03.840 --> 42:05.280
That's all Google had.

42:05.280 --> 42:09.040
Google dumped an operating system on the market that drove the value down, that created a

42:09.040 --> 42:14.720
race to the bottom, that created manufacturers to make these horrible deals, these totally

42:14.720 --> 42:18.220
unsupported phones, and now the market is awash in them.

42:18.220 --> 42:22.240
And what makes me sick about it is it's all on the back of Linux.

42:22.240 --> 42:26.480
Linux is at the core of all of these and it's a bastardization of what is a beautiful operating

42:26.480 --> 42:32.880
system that could deliver a secure, free user experience and instead has been perverted

42:32.880 --> 42:39.360
by Google for this use, all while getting their backs patted by the open source community,

42:39.360 --> 42:45.720
loving them every step of the way for their open source stance and their open source support

42:45.720 --> 42:47.620
and their summer of code.

42:47.620 --> 42:52.240
And so we never questioned the almighty Google, even though they've taken the beautiful platform

42:52.240 --> 42:59.400
that is Linux and they've weaponized it as a tracking platform as, and now not intentionally,

42:59.400 --> 43:00.840
an exploit paradise.

43:00.840 --> 43:02.960
But it's all on the back of Linux and I hate it.

43:02.960 --> 43:07.880
They've turned it into slow, the fact that they spent years trying to perfect a goddamn

43:07.880 --> 43:08.880
scroll view.

43:08.880 --> 43:14.820
I'm sorry, but no, I know it seems like I'm being mean, but that is a stupid problem to

43:14.820 --> 43:15.820
have.

43:15.820 --> 43:16.820
Yeah, it's just been a bad product.

43:16.820 --> 43:22.300
And you know what, by the time they finally get it fairly decent, which it's in a pretty

43:22.300 --> 43:26.840
good state now, I enjoy my Pixel, but it's still not as good as iOS.

43:26.840 --> 43:30.240
You know what, if somebody comes to me with a business ID and they have an Android, I

43:30.240 --> 43:32.800
just ignore them.

43:32.800 --> 43:33.800
You just decide right there.

43:33.800 --> 43:34.920
Oh, they got an Android wear watch.

43:34.920 --> 43:35.920
I won't let them in the door.

43:35.920 --> 43:37.200
And I'm not even joking.

43:37.200 --> 43:38.960
I've read VC posts.

43:38.960 --> 43:44.080
People say if a founder comes to me as an Android, no, I don't know how I feel about

43:44.080 --> 43:45.080
that.

43:45.080 --> 43:46.960
It's about taste and you can look that up.

43:46.960 --> 43:50.080
I feel like they've done a better job with Chrome OS that was just brought up by the

43:50.080 --> 43:51.080
chat room.

43:51.080 --> 43:56.000
I feel like that's been better managed by Google from OS, you know what the good mobile

43:56.000 --> 43:57.000
OS was?

43:57.000 --> 43:58.000
Yeah.

43:58.000 --> 43:59.000
Web OS.

43:59.000 --> 44:01.080
Web OS was never going to happen.

44:01.080 --> 44:02.080
Windows Phone 8.

44:02.080 --> 44:03.920
No, it had a registry, dude.

44:03.920 --> 44:05.020
It's out right there.

44:05.020 --> 44:07.680
If it has a registry, it's not on my, it's not going in my pocket.

44:07.680 --> 44:08.680
This is not happening.

44:08.680 --> 44:11.720
Yeah, but web OS was actually the good one and come on.

44:11.720 --> 44:12.720
It was from HP.

44:12.720 --> 44:15.800
It was never going to happen.

44:15.800 --> 44:21.000
For some reason, the Google YouTube algorithm thingy decided to show me commercials of the

44:21.000 --> 44:24.280
Compaq iPack from that era.

44:24.280 --> 44:28.400
So the late nineties, I guess, in my feed and for whatever reason it was right and I

44:28.400 --> 44:31.400
watched it and man, I had one of those.

44:31.400 --> 44:33.080
I actually really liked it.

44:33.080 --> 44:36.760
If you were in that ecosystem and you had like the exchange integration, it was, it

44:36.760 --> 44:37.760
was pretty cool.

44:37.760 --> 44:41.320
I just want to say I was a Windows 95 power user.

44:41.320 --> 44:42.320
Oh yeah.

44:42.320 --> 44:44.720
Did you actually, you know, you gotta get the plus pack then so that way you get the

44:44.720 --> 44:45.720
themes and stuff.

44:45.720 --> 44:47.880
Oh no, I upgraded from 3.1.

44:47.880 --> 44:52.000
And then, and then you had to get the Windows 95 like OSR 2 or whatever it was where they

44:52.000 --> 44:53.560
added USB support.

44:53.560 --> 44:55.080
I couldn't do it.

44:55.080 --> 44:57.320
I was on Windows 95.

44:57.320 --> 44:58.520
But then I got a gateway.

44:58.520 --> 44:59.520
Oh yeah.

44:59.520 --> 45:00.520
Cowbox.

45:00.520 --> 45:01.520
Yep.

45:01.520 --> 45:02.840
Fuckin' the CAS bar.

45:02.840 --> 45:05.320
But then I upgraded to Windows 98.

45:05.320 --> 45:06.320
What's wrong?

45:06.320 --> 45:07.320
Maybe it was great.

45:07.320 --> 45:08.320
Didn't work?

45:08.320 --> 45:09.320
It was slow.

45:09.320 --> 45:10.320
Oh yeah.

45:10.320 --> 45:11.320
You definitely felt it back then.

45:11.320 --> 45:12.320
Felt it.

45:12.320 --> 45:13.320
Especially on low end systems.

45:13.320 --> 45:15.920
You, you and my systems were low.

45:15.920 --> 45:16.920
Yeah.

45:16.920 --> 45:17.920
You felt the pain.

45:17.920 --> 45:18.920
Yeah, you really felt it.

45:18.920 --> 45:19.920
Mm hmm.

45:19.920 --> 45:20.920
Yeah.

45:20.920 --> 45:22.600
It was one of those things where like we were, you know, reminds me of the email we got earlier

45:22.600 --> 45:23.600
in the show.

45:23.600 --> 45:25.880
It's like you have no idea back then.

45:25.880 --> 45:27.300
I mean, it sold new machines.

45:27.300 --> 45:30.240
People would just buy it back then when a new Windows would come out.

45:30.240 --> 45:33.440
That's when people just buy entirely new PCs with Windows preloaded on it.

45:33.440 --> 45:37.280
Then I sort of skipped Vista because I wasn't crazy.

45:37.280 --> 45:38.720
Then I went to seven.

45:38.720 --> 45:41.080
Then I went to Mac and Linux.

45:41.080 --> 45:44.120
And I'm not going to talk about the machine I'm on now because people will send me hate

45:44.120 --> 45:45.120
mail.

45:45.120 --> 45:46.120
Well, besides, you got to replace that thing anyway.

45:46.120 --> 45:48.600
It's got those dirty x86 processors in it, right?

45:48.600 --> 45:50.840
I've done some benchmarks on my MacBook Air.

45:50.840 --> 45:51.840
It's not great.

45:51.840 --> 45:52.840
Yeah.

45:52.840 --> 45:53.840
Oh yeah.

45:53.840 --> 45:54.840
Oh good.

45:54.840 --> 45:56.120
Let's do a little anti-M1 for a moment.

45:56.120 --> 45:58.000
So the iMac Pro crushed it, huh?

45:58.000 --> 45:59.000
No, no, no.

45:59.000 --> 46:01.080
Oh, no, that's not what happened.

46:01.080 --> 46:02.200
Oh, damn it.

46:02.200 --> 46:04.960
It's the iMac Pro has a beautiful screen.

46:04.960 --> 46:05.960
Uh-huh.

46:05.960 --> 46:06.960
Yeah.

46:06.960 --> 46:08.280
But did it beat it on the CPU test?

46:08.280 --> 46:09.760
Tell me it beat the M1.

46:09.760 --> 46:12.840
It's my special little computer and I love it very much.

46:12.840 --> 46:15.440
You're not answering the question, which I think means that it didn't.

46:15.440 --> 46:17.480
Oh, I didn't need to hear that.

46:17.480 --> 46:19.640
Unless the GPU becomes involved.

46:19.640 --> 46:20.900
Ah, yeah, sure.

46:20.900 --> 46:22.080
The air is faster.

46:22.080 --> 46:27.880
Number one out for the x86.

46:27.880 --> 46:34.240
Honestly if I was Intel CEO right now, I would not be making snarky commercials with Justin

46:34.240 --> 46:35.240
Long.

46:35.240 --> 46:37.120
I would be at the bar crying.

46:37.120 --> 46:41.120
That might be my character flaw.

46:41.120 --> 46:43.360
Maybe you can do both, you know, but he is the CEO of Intel.

46:43.360 --> 46:44.360
You can probably do both.

46:44.360 --> 46:45.680
But do you need Justin Long?

46:45.680 --> 46:46.680
I mean.

46:46.680 --> 46:47.680
No.

46:47.680 --> 46:48.680
No, it does.

46:48.680 --> 46:49.680
It's bad too, right?

46:49.680 --> 46:54.280
I mean, the funny thing is, is like you're so he's he's essentially getting on products

46:54.280 --> 46:57.840
that still are shipping with Intel processors and like they still I mean the whole thing's

46:57.840 --> 46:58.840
like they're making funny.

46:58.840 --> 47:02.400
They're making fun of MacBooks, but they're still MacBooks selling with Intel processors.

47:02.400 --> 47:03.400
It was an awkward moment.

47:03.400 --> 47:08.520
Like I just want to say making an advertising campaign campaign dunking on one of your biggest

47:08.520 --> 47:11.440
customers seems super stupid to me.

47:11.440 --> 47:12.920
I don't know.

47:12.920 --> 47:13.920
Yeah.

47:13.920 --> 47:14.920
Yeah.

47:14.920 --> 47:16.400
What do we know?

47:16.400 --> 47:18.320
Datadog.com slash coder radio.

47:18.320 --> 47:19.320
You know what?

47:19.320 --> 47:23.740
Get your code level performance, get it across your entire environment, the whole stack and

47:23.740 --> 47:27.160
troubleshoot issues faster with Datadog.

47:27.160 --> 47:30.240
Datadog's continuous profiler does something amazing.

47:30.240 --> 47:34.200
It automatically collects profiles from your production servers and your applications all

47:34.200 --> 47:39.400
the time so you can analyze any data from any source at any point in time quickly with

47:39.400 --> 47:46.400
minimal overhead and then pop, get it a whole unified picture with their beautiful dashboards

47:46.400 --> 47:50.160
correlated with code performance metrics and other monitoring data from your servers in

47:50.160 --> 47:53.560
these real time beautiful dashboards.

47:53.560 --> 47:58.040
You got to go to datadog.com slash coder radio to see these dashboards and when you're there,

47:58.040 --> 48:03.880
you sign up for a 14 day free trial and you will get a free t-shirt after you create one

48:03.880 --> 48:05.560
of those beautiful dashboards.

48:05.560 --> 48:11.700
You get the dashboard beauty and the t-shirt, but you got to go to datadog.com slash coder

48:11.700 --> 48:12.800
radio for that.

48:12.800 --> 48:17.880
See the log management, the tracing, that continuous profiler in action and see how

48:17.880 --> 48:21.200
great it is to bring it all into one platform.

48:21.200 --> 48:26.480
Datadog enables you to pinpoint the root cause of issues faster than ever and it's a tool

48:26.480 --> 48:28.400
to help you communicate.

48:28.400 --> 48:30.460
Go try Datadog's products for free.

48:30.460 --> 48:35.600
Get that 14 day trial by visiting datadog.com slash coder radio and for a limited time,

48:35.600 --> 48:40.080
if you start a trial and you create that one dashboard, you'll get that free Datadog t-shirt

48:40.080 --> 48:42.640
free swag.

48:42.640 --> 48:48.860
Are you going over to the WWDC website right now to make your plans because it's been announced.

48:48.860 --> 48:51.760
We now know it's going to be virtual again this year.

48:51.760 --> 48:57.880
They are leaning in hard on the Craig Federighi staring at his laptop in a weird way and they've

48:57.880 --> 49:04.040
announced it'll be June 7th to the 11th for the all online program open to everybody free

49:04.040 --> 49:11.520
at no cost and even if you're not a Apple developer or even interested in any particular

49:11.520 --> 49:15.560
thing from Apple, it's kind of fascinating to watch this from a production standpoint

49:15.560 --> 49:20.600
because boy howdy, if these aren't just the peak of virtual conference production, like

49:20.600 --> 49:23.060
nobody does it like these guys do.

49:23.060 --> 49:27.140
They also this year are doing a Swift student challenge and they're going to have additional

49:27.140 --> 49:28.140
details on that.

49:28.140 --> 49:33.080
So teaching the young ones the Swift, it's a big focus at WWDC.

49:33.080 --> 49:34.440
Gotta get the young ones learned up.

49:34.440 --> 49:38.040
I guess if you hate children, that might be a thing you would do.

49:38.040 --> 49:45.320
No, but I mean, I obviously would love someone to look at me like Craig Federighi looks at

49:45.320 --> 49:46.320
the MacBook Air.

49:46.320 --> 49:48.680
I mean, who doesn't want that?

49:48.680 --> 49:53.560
And yes, I'm going to WWDC and no, I don't think there's going to be AR glasses because

49:53.560 --> 49:55.960
battery life.

49:55.960 --> 50:00.000
This is the shit about the Apple community that is so annoying.

50:00.000 --> 50:08.180
The incessant yammering on about like VR goggles or AR or will Apple build a car?

50:08.180 --> 50:09.560
Like get over yourselves.

50:09.560 --> 50:12.260
Like who just wait and see what they ship.

50:12.260 --> 50:14.060
Like this is like the community.

50:14.060 --> 50:20.120
There's so much palace intrigue type stories and rumor mill and they have a giant processor

50:20.120 --> 50:21.440
transition they're doing.

50:21.440 --> 50:23.280
Yeah, they are not shipping.

50:23.280 --> 50:28.760
And first of all, the glasses have a particular problem of the boundaries of physics with

50:28.760 --> 50:29.760
battery life.

50:29.760 --> 50:35.720
And unless they have some amazing battery technology, which honestly, if they have it,

50:35.720 --> 50:39.520
they should license it to everybody because that would change humanity.

50:39.520 --> 50:40.520
Really?

50:40.520 --> 50:41.520
Yeah.

50:41.520 --> 50:42.520
Let's share it.

50:42.520 --> 50:43.520
Share it with the world, right?

50:43.520 --> 50:44.520
Seriously.

50:44.520 --> 50:45.520
No, no, no.

50:45.520 --> 50:49.520
I'm not being a dick to get such battery capacity in such a small package would be a significant

50:49.520 --> 50:53.240
leap in like actual battery physics, right?

50:53.240 --> 50:57.280
Actual like the science of storing energy that would be different, like they would be

50:57.280 --> 51:03.200
dunking on Elon Musk like he was the, you know, junior university basketball team in

51:03.200 --> 51:04.360
their shack.

51:04.360 --> 51:08.200
But if we return to reality, they don't have that.

51:08.200 --> 51:10.980
There's not going to be air glasses.

51:10.980 --> 51:13.360
So it's so annoying.

51:13.360 --> 51:16.720
If you think if this isn't just the way they shouldn't just do this, because I'll tell

51:16.720 --> 51:21.320
you what, man, you get a lot more information this way because you don't have to pay a thousand

51:21.320 --> 51:22.480
dollars to go.

51:22.480 --> 51:25.880
It makes it way more accessible to people that are considering getting in development.

51:25.880 --> 51:30.400
It makes it way more accessible to children specifically who could never get access to

51:30.400 --> 51:33.200
this stuff because they sometimes, you know, they're not old enough to have credit cards

51:33.200 --> 51:34.200
and whatnot.

51:34.200 --> 51:40.080
I think like there is a big net benefit to make this open to all.

51:40.080 --> 51:46.240
And instead of this, like this, like exclusive, only like two thousand people to four thousand

51:46.240 --> 51:47.840
people can make it there.

51:47.840 --> 51:50.640
And it's a thousand dollar ticket and the price is only going to go up because there's

51:50.640 --> 51:52.840
less and less space available.

51:52.840 --> 51:55.500
I appreciate the value of those in-person events.

51:55.500 --> 51:58.400
You know me, I really understand the value.

51:58.400 --> 52:03.880
But this seems like a net improvement for everyone because even a casual like me can

52:03.880 --> 52:08.120
attend these and I can feel more informed and I like to have the technical details of

52:08.120 --> 52:09.120
things.

52:09.120 --> 52:10.980
I am conflicted.

52:10.980 --> 52:14.500
As a dev, I feel like the online format is better.

52:14.500 --> 52:19.600
But as a sales guy or like a business owner, I guess, which is really a glorified sales

52:19.600 --> 52:20.800
guy, right?

52:20.800 --> 52:26.920
There's something about the conference, like pub scene, you know, the hall track, right?

52:26.920 --> 52:31.160
Having said that, WWDC, I mean, I don't want to be too negative.

52:31.160 --> 52:35.400
If there's a good API that I think I could build a cool app on, I'm going to do it.

52:35.400 --> 52:36.400
Absolutely.

52:36.400 --> 52:37.400
Right.

52:37.400 --> 52:38.960
And I'm going to walk this whole thing and I'm going to be on the hunt for something

52:38.960 --> 52:40.080
like that.

52:40.080 --> 52:46.320
But my entire problem, like I'm a, you know, you know this, Chris, I'm a huge iPad believer.

52:46.320 --> 52:49.280
But the problems are Apple's policies, not the technology.

52:49.280 --> 52:53.280
I mean, I don't want to say I'm not going to build something on iOS because obviously

52:53.280 --> 52:58.600
you know me, I get excited and I do something and then I don't ship it because I'm crazy.

52:58.600 --> 53:01.680
Coder bytes is not coming because of trademark reasons, by the way.

53:01.680 --> 53:03.320
So it will be something else.

53:03.320 --> 53:04.320
Oh, man.

53:04.320 --> 53:05.680
We'll get another.

53:05.680 --> 53:08.140
I'm sure there'll be another name out there that'll work.

53:08.140 --> 53:12.160
It's going to be a coder balls inappropriate.

53:12.160 --> 53:15.360
Past Mike was wise, you know, past Mike was much calmer.

53:15.360 --> 53:18.680
No, but I mean, are you excited for WWDC?

53:18.680 --> 53:19.920
I mean, I kind of don't give a crap.

53:19.920 --> 53:20.920
No, I actually am.

53:20.920 --> 53:21.920
I am.

53:21.920 --> 53:22.920
It's the home pods.

53:22.920 --> 53:26.480
It's the it's the it's the cumulative radiation from all those home pods.

53:26.480 --> 53:28.840
OK, no, it's not the home pods.

53:28.840 --> 53:31.120
But I think they I think they're delivering.

53:31.120 --> 53:34.400
I think the iOS platform is looking better than ever.

53:34.400 --> 53:35.840
I find it fascinating.

53:35.840 --> 53:40.960
The last couple of WWDCs we've seen them allow some major changes to iOS we hadn't seen in

53:40.960 --> 53:41.960
the past.

53:41.960 --> 53:43.360
I think the M1 platform is going to get iterated on.

53:43.360 --> 53:45.280
That'll be interesting.

53:45.280 --> 53:48.660
And then I think they'll probably send me into some sort of existential crisis and panic

53:48.660 --> 53:52.200
when I worry that Linux users will leave us all.

53:52.200 --> 53:54.640
But you know, I've I've calmed down.

53:54.640 --> 53:55.640
I've calmed down.

53:55.640 --> 53:59.960
I think I think there is a good a good portion of Linux users out there who will never be

53:59.960 --> 54:02.640
swayed by the shinies of Apple, regardless of what they do.

54:02.640 --> 54:06.520
And I have good news for those of us on the platform, Mike.

54:06.520 --> 54:13.760
This has been sorely needed, a library that essentially plays a role in just defining

54:13.760 --> 54:16.020
the visual language of a GNOME application.

54:16.020 --> 54:18.120
You want to make a GNOME application.

54:18.120 --> 54:24.840
You can use Lib Adwaitia to now do that, sort of like elementary OS's Granite.

54:24.840 --> 54:28.760
This is going to be something that's available to all GTK developers.

54:28.760 --> 54:31.120
It'll track specific releases with GNOME.

54:31.120 --> 54:36.320
So you can target like a GNOME 40 look or a GNOME 42 look, and they'll include guidelines

54:36.320 --> 54:37.880
as well as code.

54:37.880 --> 54:42.080
And the idea will be a library that kind of grows over time that gives developers an ability

54:42.080 --> 54:47.380
to get some of the basics of a standard GNOME application without having to lay out every

54:47.380 --> 54:49.840
single button themselves and decide where it all goes.

54:49.840 --> 54:54.240
It's like the missing library that the desktop environment needed to get application developers

54:54.240 --> 54:55.240
started quicker.

54:55.240 --> 54:56.240
Yay.

54:56.240 --> 54:57.240
Here I come.

54:57.240 --> 55:00.960
I bring my nice little thing and I say, look, Daddy, they finally did it.

55:00.960 --> 55:02.720
They fixed the complaint of yours.

55:02.720 --> 55:04.360
And you give me nothing.

55:04.360 --> 55:09.680
You you smack it out of my hand and you just tell me to piss off.

55:09.680 --> 55:12.840
Well, let me ask you, how many users are going to pay for that software you built with that

55:12.840 --> 55:13.840
library?

55:13.840 --> 55:14.840
Oh, well, OK.

55:14.840 --> 55:15.840
I mean, there's, you know.

55:15.840 --> 55:16.840
Yeah.

55:16.840 --> 55:17.840
OK.

55:17.840 --> 55:18.840
All right.

55:18.840 --> 55:19.840
I admit I acknowledge the payment.

55:19.840 --> 55:20.840
Things a little tricky.

55:20.840 --> 55:21.840
I grant.

55:21.840 --> 55:22.840
Tricky.

55:22.840 --> 55:23.840
It's tricky.

55:23.840 --> 55:25.400
I would call it the battle.

55:25.400 --> 55:26.400
Hmm.

55:26.400 --> 55:27.400
Look, battle.

55:27.400 --> 55:28.400
Hang on.

55:28.400 --> 55:29.400
The six day now.

55:29.400 --> 55:30.400
Hmm.

55:30.400 --> 55:31.400
Hang on.

55:31.400 --> 55:32.400
What was the complete route?

55:32.400 --> 55:33.400
Oh, the Alamo.

55:33.400 --> 55:34.400
Oh, yeah.

55:34.400 --> 55:36.440
Actually, the Alamo, they held up for a while.

55:36.440 --> 55:37.440
Hang on.

55:37.440 --> 55:39.560
Well, a lot of apps do and then they finally fall.

55:39.560 --> 55:40.560
That does happen.

55:40.560 --> 55:42.560
Oh, it's France in World War Two.

55:42.560 --> 55:43.560
Right down.

55:43.560 --> 55:44.560
Sorry, French people.

55:44.560 --> 55:45.560
I'm not sorry.

55:45.560 --> 55:46.560
My stepfather is French.

55:46.560 --> 55:50.640
So you know what we need is we need somebody, somebody to help me prove Mike wrong.

55:50.640 --> 55:54.980
If you're if you're writing Linux applications for the desktop right now and you're making

55:54.980 --> 55:56.040
profits off from it.

55:56.040 --> 56:00.360
I bought a Linux developers company for less than a month of my current rep.

56:00.360 --> 56:01.360
So.

56:01.360 --> 56:02.360
So.

56:02.360 --> 56:03.360
So tell me.

56:03.360 --> 56:04.360
I want to.

56:04.360 --> 56:05.360
I want to.

56:05.360 --> 56:06.360
We're talking desktop Linux here.

56:06.360 --> 56:07.360
Yeah.

56:07.360 --> 56:08.360
Somebody making a desktop Linux app.

56:08.360 --> 56:09.360
Remail it and tell us.

56:09.360 --> 56:13.400
I'm a desktop Linux developer and you are making more than seventy five thousand dollars

56:13.400 --> 56:18.560
a year selling exclusive only selling exclusive desktop Linux apps.

56:18.560 --> 56:19.560
Only.

56:19.560 --> 56:20.560
Why would you limit yourself?

56:20.560 --> 56:21.560
Why not make yourself?

56:21.560 --> 56:26.040
I mean, what if I think Linux has to represent a significant portion of revenue, but to limit

56:26.040 --> 56:27.040
it to only seems.

56:27.040 --> 56:28.040
No, no, no, no.

56:28.040 --> 56:32.320
You got to make at least seventy five thousand on desktop Linux apps.

56:32.320 --> 56:33.320
I will.

56:33.320 --> 56:36.120
And I'm doing this publicly on tape to challenge right now.

56:36.120 --> 56:41.920
I and the Mad about our ink will sell you or not sell you, give you a Thalia from system

56:41.920 --> 56:47.680
seventy six brand new for you and a quarter radio robe if Chris can get off his ass and

56:47.680 --> 56:49.060
actually ship them.

56:49.060 --> 56:54.320
And if you can't do that, we'll give you stickers and a poster because I guarantee that no one

56:54.320 --> 56:55.320
exists.

56:55.320 --> 57:00.120
And when I say developer, I mean, an independent developer, a small team, not you.

57:00.120 --> 57:04.560
You can't say, hey, I work at Red Hat and I listen to the show and ha ha ha or, you

57:04.560 --> 57:06.560
know, my sister brothers.

57:06.560 --> 57:10.880
I want an indie indie developer selling an app.

57:10.880 --> 57:12.440
I don't care what it is.

57:12.440 --> 57:16.720
And then if OK, so if you win, you essentially don't have to give away Thalia.

57:16.720 --> 57:19.920
But if you lose, you got to ship somebody a computer.

57:19.920 --> 57:24.120
But if I if I lose, what are you going to give them, Chris?

57:24.120 --> 57:27.160
J.B. should support the Linux developer community.

57:27.160 --> 57:28.160
Right.

57:28.160 --> 57:32.760
The Mad Vodder is already in maybe like a swag box of like retro swag or something.

57:32.760 --> 57:37.160
Maybe in the Mad Vodder partner, I'll I'll buy you the very expensive computer and he'll

57:37.160 --> 57:38.560
give you some stickers.

57:38.560 --> 57:39.560
That sounds about right.

57:39.560 --> 57:40.560
No, no, no.

57:40.560 --> 57:41.560
It'll be a high value.

57:41.560 --> 57:43.880
It'll be is the highest value I can fit in the box.

57:43.880 --> 57:45.760
I just don't know which size box it is yet.

57:45.760 --> 57:47.400
Highest value thing he has is the rope.

57:47.400 --> 57:48.400
Those ropes are.

57:48.400 --> 57:49.400
Yes.

57:49.400 --> 57:51.920
Basically, they should be sewn in gold at this point.

57:51.920 --> 57:55.320
I just I know we did this at the beginning of the show.

57:55.320 --> 57:56.320
What were you thinking?

57:56.320 --> 58:02.120
And I thought I thought it was a challenge to myself and also saying, come on, right

58:02.120 --> 58:03.120
into the show.

58:03.120 --> 58:04.720
You know that this can't be done.

58:04.720 --> 58:05.720
I think it's.

58:05.720 --> 58:06.720
Yeah, I think it is.

58:06.720 --> 58:08.040
I I God, I would love to.

58:08.040 --> 58:09.040
I would.

58:09.040 --> 58:10.040
What?

58:10.040 --> 58:14.880
OK, if I recall, I actually hired a desktop Linux developer for less than my current rent.

58:14.880 --> 58:19.200
You know, we need to do is we've got to like set like a limit because what if like three

58:19.200 --> 58:20.200
dudes right in?

58:20.200 --> 58:21.200
No, just one.

58:21.200 --> 58:22.200
The first one who does it?

58:22.200 --> 58:23.200
No, no, no.

58:23.200 --> 58:24.200
It's first to the finish.

58:24.200 --> 58:25.200
But you're not even worried about that.

58:25.200 --> 58:26.200
That's not going to be a problem.

58:26.200 --> 58:27.580
It's not going to happen.

58:27.580 --> 58:30.280
And I want to see receipts where to sell them.

58:30.280 --> 58:32.240
And it can't be like steam, right?

58:32.240 --> 58:37.000
It has to be verifiable Linux desktop sales.

58:37.000 --> 58:42.840
So Ubuntu Software Center, hang on, I'm going to go laugh my ass off on you.

58:42.840 --> 58:44.320
Elementary what about the Elementary App Center?

58:44.320 --> 58:49.360
I'm a big fan of Cassidy and Daniel, but nobody's making seventy five thousand dollars.

58:49.360 --> 58:53.480
OK, you can also not be Cassidy and Daniel because I'm sure they have.

58:53.480 --> 58:54.660
But all right.

58:54.660 --> 58:56.920
You may not be the platform vendor yourself.

58:56.920 --> 59:00.400
Coder dot show slash contact for that.

59:00.400 --> 59:04.680
Last Mike's mess hall Christmas.

59:04.680 --> 59:07.760
I got I mean, I got you know, I got I got a lot of gear.

59:07.760 --> 59:10.480
I should just start throwing that stuff in boxes.

59:10.480 --> 59:16.680
So if you'd like to help support whatever this is, you can become a Coder QA team member.

59:16.680 --> 59:18.280
Coder QA dot go.

59:18.280 --> 59:19.280
You support the show.

59:19.280 --> 59:22.680
You get a limited ad feed and we have a Coderly that will be coming soon.

59:22.680 --> 59:27.640
So if you haven't signed up yet, you can get it when it releases, go to Coder QA dot co.

59:27.640 --> 59:30.960
And then when the Coderly is recorded and posted, you'll automatically get it in your

59:30.960 --> 59:33.200
feed along with the limited ad feed.

59:33.200 --> 59:36.800
Or you can download it manually to we also post available for manuals downloads there

59:36.800 --> 59:37.800
for them.

59:37.800 --> 59:39.600
Coder QA because we love our members.

59:39.600 --> 59:41.960
So thank you, everybody over there.

59:41.960 --> 59:46.520
Boy, if you want to win a Thalia and you make five thousand dollars or more by selling software

59:46.520 --> 59:49.840
on the Linux desktop, go to Coder dot show slash contact or you just like to give us

59:49.840 --> 59:50.840
feedback.

59:50.840 --> 59:53.600
We're seventy five thousand, not five thousand.

59:53.600 --> 59:55.440
OK, yeah, right.

59:55.440 --> 59:59.520
It's a big difference, like a big difference.

59:59.520 --> 01:00:00.520
It's a real bit.

01:00:00.520 --> 01:00:06.640
So like it's rogue Amoeba versus some assholes selling a counting thing that he sold, if

01:00:06.640 --> 01:00:08.760
I recall, five hundred dollars worth of licenses.

01:00:08.760 --> 01:00:10.000
Yeah, you can find Mike.

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:11.520
He's at Dumanuco on the Twitters.

01:00:11.520 --> 01:00:13.360
His company is at the Mad Botter Inc.

01:00:13.360 --> 01:00:14.880
I'm there to Chris LAS.

01:00:14.880 --> 01:00:17.080
I don't tweet much, but I try to respond.

01:00:17.080 --> 01:00:20.760
The network is that Jupiter signal where you can get announcements and news and same with

01:00:20.760 --> 01:00:22.880
the show at Coder Radio show.

01:00:22.880 --> 01:00:25.200
How about that?

01:00:25.200 --> 01:00:28.880
Links to what we talked about today are Coder dot show slash four oh eight over there.

01:00:28.880 --> 01:00:33.720
You're going to find that contact form as well as our RSS feed links, really kind of

01:00:33.720 --> 01:00:36.440
all the resources, all the resources.

01:00:36.440 --> 01:00:40.520
And then you go to Jupiter Broadcasting Dotcom and holy smokes, there's like a whole bunch

01:00:40.520 --> 01:00:46.200
of other shows, including Linux Unplugged 400, which landed this week.

01:00:46.200 --> 01:00:47.480
That's pretty great, too.

01:00:47.480 --> 01:00:48.480
You could join us live.

01:00:48.480 --> 01:00:53.700
That's Coder Happy Hour at five p.m. Pacific, eight p.m. Eastern at JBLive.TV, and we'd

01:00:53.700 --> 01:00:56.880
love to have you join us in the chat room or watch live and chat right along.

01:00:56.880 --> 01:00:58.880
It makes a lot of fun for us.

01:00:58.880 --> 01:01:02.160
Thanks so much for tuning in to this week's episode of the Coder Radio program, and we'll

01:01:02.160 --> 01:01:18.680
see you right back here next week.
