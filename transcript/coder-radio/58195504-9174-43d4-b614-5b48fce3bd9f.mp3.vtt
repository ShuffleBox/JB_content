This is KOTOR Radio, episode 396 for January 11th, 2021.

00:16.000 --> 00:20.680
Well hi there and welcome into Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show, taking a pragmatic look

00:20.680 --> 00:24.880
at the art and business of software development and the world of technology.

00:39.680 --> 00:45.640
My name is Chris and joining us every single week is our hostess with the Mac, it's Mr.

00:45.640 --> 00:46.640
Dominic.

00:46.640 --> 00:47.640
Hello Mike.

00:47.640 --> 00:48.640
Wait, hostess?

00:48.640 --> 00:49.760
Did I have a surgery I'm not aware of?

00:49.760 --> 00:51.680
Do you still have the M1 by any chance?

00:51.680 --> 00:52.680
Yes, I do.

00:52.680 --> 00:54.960
I just thought maybe it got sent back since we talked last.

00:54.960 --> 00:56.600
No, well, you know what?

00:56.600 --> 00:58.680
This time the love has stuck.

00:58.680 --> 00:59.680
Oh, oh, okay.

00:59.680 --> 01:01.640
Well, we're going to talk about that in the show today.

01:01.640 --> 01:05.240
Yeah, I do have some axes to grind first.

01:05.240 --> 01:06.240
Oh my gosh.

01:06.240 --> 01:07.240
Here we go.

01:07.240 --> 01:08.240
Here we go.

01:08.240 --> 01:09.240
Here we go.

01:09.240 --> 01:12.520
First of all, why do we not have a shaman?

01:12.520 --> 01:13.520
Yeah, I know.

01:13.520 --> 01:14.520
You know what?

01:14.520 --> 01:18.320
We've been around way longer than the Q conspiracy theory.

01:18.320 --> 01:23.120
I want a dude in a Viking helmet with like objective C brackets, like tattooed on his

01:23.120 --> 01:24.120
chest.

01:24.120 --> 01:25.120
Wearing a robe.

01:25.120 --> 01:26.120
Oh, goddammit.

01:26.120 --> 01:28.520
You know it's going to be a robe, bro, man.

01:28.520 --> 01:29.520
Come on.

01:29.520 --> 01:31.240
The robe rows were out in force this week.

01:31.240 --> 01:33.000
Hey, don't you besmirch the robe rows.

01:33.000 --> 01:36.080
No, I think it's a coup, frankly, by the robe.

01:36.080 --> 01:40.120
They're overthrowing the power of the Coderadio program and we're pushing the robe agenda

01:40.120 --> 01:41.120
forward.

01:41.120 --> 01:42.120
There's no doubt about it.

01:42.120 --> 01:44.480
We're just going to become a show exclusively about robes.

01:44.480 --> 01:45.480
That's all it's going to be every week.

01:45.480 --> 01:48.200
We're going to go to a hotel, get a robe.

01:48.200 --> 01:51.080
This is a little more chintzy than last week.

01:51.080 --> 01:55.280
Fat cat in the chat room says he's going to get a robe tattooed onto his entire body.

01:55.280 --> 01:57.080
That seems like the way to go, to be honest with you.

01:57.080 --> 01:58.080
I don't know how it works.

01:58.080 --> 01:59.880
Let us know, fat cat.

01:59.880 --> 02:03.400
I moved office spaces this week.

02:03.400 --> 02:08.640
So the studio has two upstairs office spaces and I moved to the other one.

02:08.640 --> 02:10.560
But it was a nice chance to just redo everything.

02:10.560 --> 02:14.980
So I got myself a standing desk forever ago, to be honest with you.

02:14.980 --> 02:17.600
It's embarrassing how long ago I bought that, but never put it together.

02:17.600 --> 02:23.760
So I finally got that put together and had the help of the wife and family over, helping

02:23.760 --> 02:25.960
me just move stuff and clean stuff up.

02:25.960 --> 02:29.840
Angela came over and helped grab a few things and wrangle kids.

02:29.840 --> 02:34.320
We just kind of got a big chunk of work done and I got myself a whole new workspace set

02:34.320 --> 02:35.320
up.

02:35.320 --> 02:36.320
It's really nice.

02:36.320 --> 02:39.360
It's like coming into a whole new work experience now.

02:39.360 --> 02:40.360
It's changing my game.

02:40.360 --> 02:43.560
I'm feeling the vibe, the new office vibe.

02:43.560 --> 02:49.320
I actually ordered a replacement standing desk and every second that I'm on this very,

02:49.320 --> 02:52.600
not strong enough to hold my computer, Amazon Day6 desk.

02:52.600 --> 02:53.600
Oh yeah.

02:53.600 --> 02:54.600
Yeah.

02:54.600 --> 02:57.280
Autonomous, I think is the brand, Autonomous IO.

02:57.280 --> 02:59.040
That's the one that I bought too.

02:59.040 --> 03:00.040
That's what I got.

03:00.040 --> 03:05.200
And so it's got four memory positions and I mean really everything's working pretty

03:05.200 --> 03:08.960
well except for now I have to kind of redo my wiring setup because I need to get longer

03:08.960 --> 03:12.240
cables and stuff like that for the all the way up mode.

03:12.240 --> 03:16.640
I think I want to mount the power adapt to the power brick for all the plugs.

03:16.640 --> 03:18.920
I want to mount that to the wall possibly.

03:18.920 --> 03:23.320
So I got to do things a little differently now, but for the first time, I'm investing

03:23.320 --> 03:24.320
in me.

03:24.320 --> 03:31.440
I'm even getting myself, get ready for this, a desk stand for my MagSafe adapter so I have

03:31.440 --> 03:34.040
an actual spot and I can tidy the cord up.

03:34.040 --> 03:35.800
I mean that's how fancy I'm getting.

03:35.800 --> 03:36.800
That is pretty fancy.

03:36.800 --> 03:40.560
I'm going to have like a metal pedestal for my phone, just set it down and it charges.

03:40.560 --> 03:44.640
I'm done with the wires all over the place and the pucks all over the place, looking

03:44.640 --> 03:46.440
like Doc Brown's desk or something.

03:46.440 --> 03:47.440
I'm done with that.

03:47.440 --> 03:48.440
You know?

03:48.440 --> 03:51.680
I feel like I'm a gentleman now.

03:51.680 --> 03:52.960
I got a gentleman desk.

03:52.960 --> 03:56.960
I got one of them big mouse pads too, so like the whole thing's down, you know?

03:56.960 --> 04:02.700
I have to tell you, working on this little desk, I understand what Dark Matter developers

04:02.700 --> 04:04.400
must feel like.

04:04.400 --> 04:07.720
It's like I have literally, this is the worst thing ever.

04:07.720 --> 04:13.200
If I move my hand to slightly the wrong way, something is spilling into this iMac Pro,

04:13.200 --> 04:18.680
which frankly is what it deserves because it's just trounced by the M1, but it was still

04:18.680 --> 04:20.160
$5,000.

04:20.160 --> 04:25.320
How are you getting the angle of the spillage because the iMac's not like, I see a laptop,

04:25.320 --> 04:28.720
that's a target because the most vulnerable components are laying just right there on

04:28.720 --> 04:29.720
the table.

04:29.720 --> 04:32.400
You could easily knock something into the keyboard, which spills into the main board

04:32.400 --> 04:33.400
and it's dead.

04:33.400 --> 04:36.880
But an iMac, that's like up on a foot, you know?

04:36.880 --> 04:40.220
It's way harder to get the beverages to the really important components.

04:40.220 --> 04:41.220
You really got to aim.

04:41.220 --> 04:43.960
You doubt my ability to destroy Apple equipment.

04:43.960 --> 04:44.960
No.

04:44.960 --> 04:46.440
It seems like a bet.

04:46.440 --> 04:49.680
I think what it is, is I'm just trying to fantasize how you're going to pull it off.

04:49.680 --> 04:54.960
Like a ricochet or you were stacking shelves and maybe there was like a beverage up there

04:54.960 --> 04:58.160
that the kid set that you didn't even know was there and the shelf falls and it falls

04:58.160 --> 04:59.160
inside.

04:59.160 --> 05:01.160
The drink comes off the shelf and pours into the iMac.

05:01.160 --> 05:04.640
Just do a little flair bartending and like miss.

05:04.640 --> 05:06.120
Which is probably happening all the time at your place.

05:06.120 --> 05:07.120
I'm sure.

05:07.120 --> 05:08.120
Yeah.

05:08.120 --> 05:11.280
Well, not anymore, but those were the days.

05:11.280 --> 05:12.280
Okay.

05:12.280 --> 05:13.280
Well, so we got a lot of feedback.

05:13.280 --> 05:14.800
I mean, a lot of feedback.

05:14.800 --> 05:18.600
And so if your email doesn't make it into this show, it may make it into the next one.

05:18.600 --> 05:21.200
But we did ask people a little bit about their setups.

05:21.200 --> 05:25.360
And now I'm really curious because they just redid mine and it really came down to like,

05:25.360 --> 05:30.640
man, if I'm going to redo my desk and I have to pull everything out of here anyways, maybe

05:30.640 --> 05:32.680
I should just move rooms where it's got a better view.

05:32.680 --> 05:33.680
It's got airflow.

05:33.680 --> 05:36.800
You know, it was a, it was a big setup.

05:36.800 --> 05:38.800
So then people are starting to write in and tell me about their steps.

05:38.800 --> 05:40.240
I'm like, oh, that's a good idea.

05:40.240 --> 05:41.280
Maybe I'll do that.

05:41.280 --> 05:47.280
So Eric wrote in with his setup for a, he's a suspicion and a software developer by day.

05:47.280 --> 05:54.360
I think he dabbles with R and he said for work, I use a 2018 MacBook Pro and he does

05:54.360 --> 05:56.040
sometimes have a choice.

05:56.040 --> 05:58.640
He has a choice between that or severely locked down windows.

05:58.640 --> 06:01.520
So you know, might as well go with the Mac.

06:01.520 --> 06:05.720
He does some day work with MacBook and Docker containers and VS code.

06:05.720 --> 06:07.940
They mostly use office 365.

06:07.940 --> 06:11.060
He has a persistent team up session going on all the time, logged into some of their

06:11.060 --> 06:15.160
nodes with a web based IDE called R studio server.

06:15.160 --> 06:19.200
But he's been starting to use VS code a lot more with a remote extension for personal

06:19.200 --> 06:20.340
projects at home.

06:20.340 --> 06:21.500
And I love this.

06:21.500 --> 06:24.520
It allows him to, you know, like modify Docker and stuff like that remotely.

06:24.520 --> 06:29.160
But then he took it to the next level, Mike, and you may already know about this, but I

06:29.160 --> 06:34.180
wanted to mention it for the audience in case you didn't know is what Eric is kind of migrating

06:34.180 --> 06:41.220
to and I have set up at home and love it is VS code in a web browser and it's code server.

06:41.220 --> 06:45.740
It's open source and it's essentially VS code in a tab.

06:45.740 --> 06:50.040
And it's just so handy to like throw that up on a Linode or on like a local server that

06:50.040 --> 06:55.080
I have in the RV where I don't use it super often because I prefer to have VS code local.

06:55.080 --> 06:59.280
But every now and then I'm on a machine and it's just nice to have a centralized editor

06:59.280 --> 07:03.580
and you can even edit local files on your server if you set it up particularly the way

07:03.580 --> 07:05.380
I have it.

07:05.380 --> 07:10.120
So are there, I guess there would be performance implications because it's literally an electron

07:10.120 --> 07:11.120
app, right?

07:11.120 --> 07:13.480
So yeah, it's really kind of cool.

07:13.480 --> 07:17.960
I keep wanting this to be a thing and someone's going to have to correct me, but I think it

07:17.960 --> 07:20.560
was cloud nine.

07:20.560 --> 07:25.840
Yeah, years ago we talked like way when we were first talking about Docker with this

07:25.840 --> 07:28.720
whole idea that like you are, you know, you'd go back to the eighties, right?

07:28.720 --> 07:33.040
Your terminal would be just like a really, you know, that eight hundred dollar laptop

07:33.040 --> 07:36.240
from Best Buy and your ID would live in the cloud.

07:36.240 --> 07:39.200
This is kind of that dream, only it's now it's VS code.

07:39.200 --> 07:41.760
Yeah, because I guess all my extensions would actually just work, right?

07:41.760 --> 07:48.080
Because it's just running on another Ubuntu box or if you're, you know, have taste, SUSE.

07:48.080 --> 08:00.320
By the way, I happened to be listening to a certain unplugged podcast of the Linux variety.

08:00.320 --> 08:01.320
Anything you'd like to share?

08:01.320 --> 08:04.480
Well, yeah, I was running SUSE in secret for a week.

08:04.480 --> 08:06.800
I got to admit I was doing that.

08:06.800 --> 08:11.080
I felt like it would derail the show, so I didn't mention it.

08:11.080 --> 08:13.840
And then afterwards I thought, you know, maybe, you know, once I probably should have just

08:13.840 --> 08:14.840
brought it up.

08:14.840 --> 08:18.560
But, you know, I got to say it was all right.

08:18.560 --> 08:20.120
It wasn't it wasn't great.

08:20.120 --> 08:25.680
I unlike probably you, I find you asked to be a vestige of years gone past.

08:25.680 --> 08:27.320
But you really want to use Zipper, though.

08:27.320 --> 08:28.320
Yeah, I mean, I know.

08:28.320 --> 08:29.320
I know.

08:29.320 --> 08:31.080
But I'm just talking about for configuring the system in general.

08:31.080 --> 08:35.040
I actually am not a huge fan of Zipper either.

08:35.040 --> 08:40.000
I definitely like it more than something like RPM or apt RPM or or something like that.

08:40.000 --> 08:48.100
But I think these days it's probably of like, say, Archdebian Red Hat varieties.

08:48.100 --> 08:51.580
It's probably my and then you throw SUSE and it's probably my least favorite package manager

08:51.580 --> 08:52.580
of that group.

08:52.580 --> 08:56.440
OK, I mean, I will say there are niceties in apt that I miss.

08:56.440 --> 09:00.800
It just seems slow to really slow to do any zipper.

09:00.800 --> 09:03.760
It just really seems like I'm really waiting for the package manager.

09:03.760 --> 09:08.080
There's a lot of steps in Zipper that I think, you know, I kind of started to kind of hone

09:08.080 --> 09:14.000
in on the aspect I could really see liking about SUSE and that would be leap on my server,

09:14.000 --> 09:16.320
tumbleweed on my laptop and desktop.

09:16.320 --> 09:20.960
That kind of that kind of idea does resonate with me a lot.

09:20.960 --> 09:24.680
And you know, long term, I think they've made some some clever choices in some areas.

09:24.680 --> 09:30.000
So it's like all things with Linux, it's kind of pick your set of compromises and your sets

09:30.000 --> 09:31.000
of wins.

09:31.000 --> 09:32.000
Really.

09:32.000 --> 09:33.000
Is that another way to say half broken?

09:33.000 --> 09:44.200
Oh, see, well, I think what I prioritize is simple, minimal and whenever possible, built

09:44.200 --> 09:45.200
in.

09:45.200 --> 09:49.160
So if there's a way to just do a way to do something that system D just does it already

09:49.160 --> 09:55.480
or like I prefer to go that route like one of the reasons it's silly, but we we talk

09:55.480 --> 09:56.480
about it on plug.

09:56.480 --> 10:00.760
We actually chose to run Arch Linux on our server here in the studio, and it's actually

10:00.760 --> 10:03.560
kind of an important server to us.

10:03.560 --> 10:11.040
But everything, with the exception of net data and Samba, everything runs in a container.

10:11.040 --> 10:16.400
And so we keep arch on an LTS kernel and we update it semi frequently.

10:16.400 --> 10:19.720
And really everything that we need is taking place in Docker.

10:19.720 --> 10:24.460
And what I love about the setup is it is a minimum viable server.

10:24.460 --> 10:26.020
It doesn't have anything extra.

10:26.020 --> 10:27.920
It doesn't have any additional packages.

10:27.920 --> 10:32.100
It literally has just what you need to get that environment functional.

10:32.100 --> 10:35.120
And so it has a really low maintenance surface because of that.

10:35.120 --> 10:37.360
And it has it's just kind of secure by default.

10:37.360 --> 10:43.160
And it feels like with SUSE, it's kind of the kitchen sink distro, you know, even the

10:43.160 --> 10:46.960
way you download it, they've got like the four point two gig DVD image or do you want

10:46.960 --> 10:52.320
the net install or do you want the five I five eighty six optimize or the X 64 optimized

10:52.320 --> 10:56.760
images and all of that just sort of feels kind of like the old school baked in approach

10:56.760 --> 10:59.340
of Linux and there are advantages to it.

10:59.340 --> 11:02.920
I prefer the minimum distro kind of thing myself for servers.

11:02.920 --> 11:08.040
If you're playing the code radio drinking game, we've had Robros, SUSE, lizards, arch

11:08.040 --> 11:13.040
and rust and R. And by the way, Eric, I believe, is the host of the R podcast.

11:13.040 --> 11:14.040
Very good.

11:14.040 --> 11:15.040
You should go listen to it.

11:15.040 --> 11:18.840
You are probably suffering from alcohol poisoning right now.

11:18.840 --> 11:19.840
So sorry.

11:19.840 --> 11:20.840
All right.

11:20.840 --> 11:24.400
If you're taking shots, the code radio drinking game, you're getting wrecked.

11:24.400 --> 11:25.760
Oh, and objective C.

11:25.760 --> 11:26.760
All right.

11:26.760 --> 11:27.760
Go throw that in.

11:27.760 --> 11:28.760
And the M1.

11:28.760 --> 11:29.760
Did you say that?

11:29.760 --> 11:30.760
Because if you didn't, I did.

11:30.760 --> 11:31.760
Two shots for the M1.

11:31.760 --> 11:32.760
Oh, and I said something insulting about Linux.

11:32.760 --> 11:35.160
So that there we go.

11:35.160 --> 11:40.360
So let's talk about a dev living the M1 lifestyle right now.

11:40.360 --> 11:44.800
Kent writes in, says, hey, guys, responding to your question on last week's show, I work

11:44.800 --> 11:48.520
at an education company and currently I'm building a new website to replace the in-person

11:48.520 --> 11:51.540
training they used to do well because of Covid, obviously.

11:51.540 --> 11:57.360
My dev machine of choice is the M1 MacBook Air with 16 gigabytes of RAM and a 35 inch

11:57.360 --> 11:58.960
external monitor.

11:58.960 --> 12:04.680
It's ultra wide 3440 by 1440 resolution because the company wants to integrate with their

12:04.680 --> 12:06.200
WordPress and WooCommerce site.

12:06.200 --> 12:10.760
I'm working in PHP for the back end, but building out a front end for a section of the WordPress

12:10.760 --> 12:12.600
site with Flutter web.

12:12.600 --> 12:16.680
Eventually this code will be reused to also launch mobile apps for Android and iOS.

12:16.680 --> 12:22.720
And he says, by the way, sign me up for two robes, one for me and one for the lady.

12:22.720 --> 12:23.920
I love it, Kent.

12:23.920 --> 12:24.920
You got it.

12:24.920 --> 12:28.440
Two robes, bros.

12:28.440 --> 12:29.440
So good.

12:29.440 --> 12:33.960
It's like I just, you know, I had an intuitive moment with the audience.

12:33.960 --> 12:35.680
I just struck a chord with them.

12:35.680 --> 12:38.440
Morgan writes in with a quick rundown of their setup.

12:38.440 --> 12:40.160
You mentioned wanting to know a little bit about our setups.

12:40.160 --> 12:44.440
Well, my main programming language is Go Bash and I work with Terraform and Ansible.

12:44.440 --> 12:48.360
A little bit of Podman and K8s is in there, too, with WireGuard connecting everything

12:48.360 --> 12:52.380
using Fedora and CentOS Stream now working good.

12:52.380 --> 12:56.000
And then we use SystemD with a bit of Bash glue to tie it all together.

12:56.000 --> 13:00.840
I'm split between maintaining our Linux distribution, managing the cloud component of our product,

13:00.840 --> 13:04.000
and then of course, keeping our infrastructure for our factory working and hacking on the

13:04.000 --> 13:07.980
code bases for these different projects and sending it upstream when possible.

13:07.980 --> 13:15.040
He's working at a place, or they're working at a place called Holopot.com, H-O-L-O-P-L-O-T.com

13:15.040 --> 13:17.900
in case I'm ready to replace my HomePods with something more pro.

13:17.900 --> 13:23.240
And I checked out their site and holy shit, Holopot Plot, sorry, I keep messing that up.

13:23.240 --> 13:26.240
It's H-O-L-O-P-L-O-T.com.

13:26.240 --> 13:27.240
Looks incredible.

13:27.240 --> 13:28.240
Like incredible speakers.

13:28.240 --> 13:30.200
Yeah, you got to go look.

13:30.200 --> 13:34.700
We had a few people write in, somebody wrote in with a solution on how to use Homebrew

13:34.700 --> 13:40.200
on ARM and Intel, depending on which version you want with only one terminal, using different

13:40.200 --> 13:41.560
environment variables or something.

13:41.560 --> 13:44.360
I'll put a link to that in the show notes if people are interested.

13:44.360 --> 13:45.960
Yeah, that was an interesting approach.

13:45.960 --> 13:48.600
I think your approach is just simpler and easier to...

13:48.600 --> 13:54.240
The only thing that's annoying with my approach is I wish I could set a different visual profile

13:54.240 --> 13:55.920
for like Rosetta Terminal and...

13:55.920 --> 13:57.240
Why aren't you using iTerm?

13:57.240 --> 14:00.960
I mean, you've had a week, give it a go, come on.

14:00.960 --> 14:03.720
It's a better terminal than the Mac OS Terminal, I tell you what.

14:03.720 --> 14:05.680
Okay, why is it better?

14:05.680 --> 14:06.880
First of all, it just looks a little bit better.

14:06.880 --> 14:12.720
It has a lot more configuration options and it has the themes that you're looking for.

14:12.720 --> 14:16.440
What I like about it now, you don't have to do it this way, but you can even set it as

14:16.440 --> 14:19.880
sort of like that drop down Quake Terminal style terminal.

14:19.880 --> 14:20.880
You can actually...

14:20.880 --> 14:24.100
There's lots of guides to configure iTerm like that, so you can hit a key on your keyboard

14:24.100 --> 14:25.760
and it just drops down from the top of your screen.

14:25.760 --> 14:29.000
All right, well, I'll tell you what, as we do the rest of the feedback, I will live install

14:29.000 --> 14:30.000
it.

14:30.000 --> 14:31.000
How about that?

14:31.000 --> 14:33.400
I really like the iTerm layout that I have, so you might like it.

14:33.400 --> 14:34.400
I think it is pretty good.

14:34.400 --> 14:38.920
I mean, in theory, that would solve my problem because then iTerm could just be like...

14:38.920 --> 14:43.480
Because the little dirty secret is I'm almost always in Rosetta Terminal because...

14:43.480 --> 14:46.560
The dirty secret is I'm always angry.

14:46.560 --> 14:50.740
The dirty secret is I use a lot of Ruby gems and Python packages that are not compiled

14:50.740 --> 14:51.740
for ARM.

14:51.740 --> 14:59.780
We also got a tip that you can switch to the Visual Studio Code Insider builds, which I

14:59.780 --> 15:04.520
guess are starting to support the M1.

15:04.520 --> 15:08.720
It wasn't super clear from the feedback, but I guess if you get the Insider builds, you

15:08.720 --> 15:10.600
get M1 support.

15:10.600 --> 15:12.920
That might be something to think about too.

15:12.920 --> 15:17.560
So of course, some setups aren't as swanky as the M1.

15:17.560 --> 15:22.440
Josh writes in, he says, I work as a system admin, primarily in a Windows environment.

15:22.440 --> 15:26.640
I've been doing a lot of PowerShell scripting and PowerShell Linux is a different bag than

15:26.640 --> 15:28.160
in Windows.

15:28.160 --> 15:30.920
Things like AD integration, registry edits, etc.

15:30.920 --> 15:35.400
When I'm not in the office on my Windows machine, I have a ThinkPad T440P running for

15:35.400 --> 15:41.800
door 33 and I have Windows 10 and I have server VMs.

15:41.800 --> 15:46.660
I'm guessing he probably means Windows Server VMs with VS Code for development.

15:46.660 --> 15:51.080
One thing that I noticed is that I really end up spending more time in the VMs than

15:51.080 --> 15:52.880
on my host machine.

15:52.880 --> 15:56.680
So he said I felt like my environment was just kind of unique and janky enough that

15:56.680 --> 15:59.520
I wanted to share it all.

15:59.520 --> 16:06.640
And then, devastatingly adds, I also want to throw some shade on the robe bros.

16:06.640 --> 16:09.400
I just perked right up.

16:09.400 --> 16:15.120
The only people I know who wear robes are my 60 plus year old parents.

16:15.120 --> 16:16.120
Inappropriate.

16:16.120 --> 16:19.660
Well actually, if you live in the south, there are some other people who wear robes but you

16:19.660 --> 16:21.960
definitely don't want to hang out with them.

16:21.960 --> 16:25.960
I feel like our feedback speaks for itself.

16:25.960 --> 16:27.520
There are robe bros out there.

16:27.520 --> 16:28.520
We are proud.

16:28.520 --> 16:32.280
Robe bros also includes ladies, I will mention.

16:32.280 --> 16:36.360
And we are uniting and we are going to change the agenda.

16:36.360 --> 16:41.080
And it's not just men, it's not just women, it's even those tiny humans.

16:41.080 --> 16:46.920
Reece writes in, very short and simple, I'm 13 years old and I want a robe, hashtag robe

16:46.920 --> 16:47.920
bros.

16:47.920 --> 16:48.920
So thank you, Reece.

16:48.920 --> 16:49.920
All right, all right.

16:49.920 --> 16:50.920
Stop corrupting the youth.

16:50.920 --> 16:54.440
This has gone way too far.

16:54.440 --> 16:56.040
I'm telling you, it speaks to the people.

16:56.040 --> 16:57.040
It speaks.

16:57.040 --> 16:58.040
It speaks to the people.

16:58.040 --> 17:01.640
You're going to have a riot on your head if you don't come up with robes.

17:01.640 --> 17:04.120
You know, I think robes are going to bring peace because you know what?

17:04.120 --> 17:05.920
When you're wearing a robe, you're comfortable.

17:05.920 --> 17:07.880
And who wants to riot when they're comfortable?

17:07.880 --> 17:09.920
So last week, that's what we needed.

17:09.920 --> 17:16.360
Come into JB Studios, we got robes, cannabis, and scotch and you just sit back and listen

17:16.360 --> 17:17.360
to a podcast.

17:17.360 --> 17:22.140
Yeah, I feel like the robes are not the operative functioning things there.

17:22.140 --> 17:29.520
So I appreciate Reece lodging their vote and I love that we have 13 year old listeners

17:29.520 --> 17:30.520
too.

17:30.520 --> 17:31.520
So we have a few more setups.

17:31.520 --> 17:33.060
I just want to blast through really quick.

17:33.060 --> 17:38.800
Like I said, there's a whole bunch sent in and if you don't hear yours here, I may cover

17:38.800 --> 17:42.520
it next week or I may just reply directly back to you.

17:42.520 --> 17:46.800
Before I do that, I want to mention that a cloud guru has the Red Hat certified system

17:46.800 --> 17:48.880
administrator exam prep.

17:48.880 --> 17:53.440
In this course, they cover the skills and concepts necessary to pass the Red Hat R-H-C-S-A

17:53.440 --> 17:57.440
exam using a mix of lessons and hands-on labs.

17:57.440 --> 18:01.840
They tie it all together with a challenge lab that really helps you test your skills.

18:01.840 --> 18:05.580
So if you're looking at getting Red Hat certified, check out the link in the show notes and get

18:05.580 --> 18:10.720
started at the cloudguru.com or go specifically to this course with the link that we'll have

18:10.720 --> 18:11.720
in our show notes.

18:11.720 --> 18:15.800
It's a cloud guru's Red Hat certified system administrator exam prep.

18:15.800 --> 18:18.720
The best way to learn is by doing.

18:18.720 --> 18:22.320
For more feedback, this one is an AWS stack from Paul.

18:22.320 --> 18:27.440
Hey there, just writing it with my typical dev stack by day I specialize in AWS and serverless

18:27.440 --> 18:28.920
technologies.

18:28.920 --> 18:34.160
All of our APIs are deployed to AWS Lambda and written in Express.js.

18:34.160 --> 18:38.760
We use a combination of DynamoDB and Aurora Serverless for our databases.

18:38.760 --> 18:42.900
Our front ends are written in Vue.js or Angular depending on the developer and for mobile,

18:42.900 --> 18:44.760
we leverage the Merian forms.

18:44.760 --> 18:50.920
Outside of the day job, I write my games in either straight C or minimal C++ and open

18:50.920 --> 18:56.560
GL and SDL and sometimes I'll pair it with a little good old C sharp and mono game.

18:56.560 --> 18:58.680
That's Paul on the AWS Lambda stack.

18:58.680 --> 19:03.560
In fact, you know, Mr. Dominic, we've got a handful of people using AWS.

19:03.560 --> 19:07.840
So I kind of condensed them down into Paul's email, but that set up, you know, some sort

19:07.840 --> 19:14.540
of JavaScript framework, AWS serverless, probably mentioned three or four times by

19:14.540 --> 19:17.120
people that sent in emails, which that's kind of interesting.

19:17.120 --> 19:18.120
I think.

19:18.120 --> 19:22.200
Yeah, last year I briefly did a project on a Lambda using F sharp, believe it or not.

19:22.200 --> 19:26.860
It was, it's one of those things that was so straightforward in terms of getting it

19:26.860 --> 19:31.600
set up that it's almost, we didn't really cover it too much, but I mean, it's exactly

19:31.600 --> 19:32.860
what it says on the tin, right?

19:32.860 --> 19:33.860
It's a serverless thing.

19:33.860 --> 19:39.060
It turns on, runs your functions, you know, data in, all I was doing is data in data out.

19:39.060 --> 19:43.960
You know what it is about iterm I just realized not to jump around like a maniac, the developers

19:43.960 --> 19:45.920
wear robes when they code.

19:45.920 --> 19:46.920
How did you know?

19:46.920 --> 19:49.440
You're a little predictable.

19:49.440 --> 19:51.600
It feels like a Linux terminal on Mac OS.

19:51.600 --> 19:55.100
It feels like the configuration you get with a Linux terminal emulator.

19:55.100 --> 19:59.160
So Susan wrote in with a really solid arch set up, Susan from Nepal.

19:59.160 --> 20:02.180
They said that they've been listening to the show for quite some time and really love it.

20:02.180 --> 20:06.600
In regards to the question we asked about people's work setups and their stack, their

20:06.600 --> 20:11.040
development machine is a six year old ASUS laptop, but it's held up really well.

20:11.040 --> 20:17.520
It has a fourth gen i7, 16 gigs of RAM, an NVIDIA 950M in there, and it just keeps working.

20:17.520 --> 20:20.680
The dedicated graphics was a total waste of money as I haven't played a single game on

20:20.680 --> 20:25.880
this machine in about 12 years, she says, yeah, I know, right?

20:25.880 --> 20:28.960
The project we're working on our company is large and takes some time to build around

20:28.960 --> 20:29.960
five minutes.

20:29.960 --> 20:34.400
So instead of buying a new powerful machine, we refactor the entire application into modules

20:34.400 --> 20:38.720
and leverage that to reduce the build time significantly.

20:38.720 --> 20:43.720
Now the build time is in, for the different modules, between five to 40 seconds in general.

20:43.720 --> 20:49.560
The OSs that they've hopped through are Linux Mint and Kali and Ubuntu, but in the last

20:49.560 --> 20:52.040
few years have settled on Arch.

20:52.040 --> 20:57.640
It's only broken once, that was for Kernel 5.9 and an Intel video driver, but they quickly

20:57.640 --> 20:58.720
found the solution on the forum.

20:58.720 --> 21:05.760
And other than that, it's really simple, lightweight, that combined with, he says, or they say,

21:05.760 --> 21:11.400
they were a GNOME fanboy, but they were having annoying problems where the display would

21:11.400 --> 21:15.040
stutter from time to time and just got little issues, little paper cuts on GNOME, switched

21:15.040 --> 21:17.160
over to Plasma, never looked back since then.

21:17.160 --> 21:23.320
So the Arch Plasma setup has been totally rocking for them and rock solid, super smooth,

21:23.320 --> 21:28.660
uses less resources without compromising features and makes for a great workstation.

21:28.660 --> 21:33.420
And I just love that, to get Susan's take from Nepal and the idea of these, sometimes

21:33.420 --> 21:35.200
we talk about these absolute latest machines.

21:35.200 --> 21:41.180
This is a 12-year-old laptop running Arch and she's getting perfectly good performance

21:41.180 --> 21:43.800
from it and working, getting the day job done.

21:43.800 --> 21:48.380
And the approach, instead of throwing more hardware at it, was to break the application

21:48.380 --> 21:54.360
up into modules and then build the modules as needed, which go much faster, totally a

21:54.360 --> 21:55.360
valid approach.

21:55.360 --> 21:57.640
Yeah, that's not that crazy at all.

21:57.640 --> 21:59.880
Probably easier for maintenance long-term as well.

21:59.880 --> 22:02.800
So that's also a win when doing that.

22:02.800 --> 22:03.800
Okay.

22:03.800 --> 22:07.680
So the last one, the last one we have for this episode, we have a batch for next week

22:07.680 --> 22:12.680
too, but Mike wrote in and after selling his company and sticking around for a while and

22:12.680 --> 22:16.400
kind of getting the bonus for sticking around, they kicked off what they thought would be

22:16.400 --> 22:19.800
a four-month project, they're now 14 months into it.

22:19.800 --> 22:28.160
They're using AWS, Lambda, DynamoDB, Elasticsearch, S3 of course, CloudWatch.

22:28.160 --> 22:31.440
For the CICD, they're using CodePipeline and CodeBuild.

22:31.440 --> 22:35.800
Their infrastructure as code is Terraform running in the Terraform cloud.

22:35.800 --> 22:39.660
Go on the server side with some JavaScript and Java where there's existing third-party

22:39.660 --> 22:42.040
libraries that are superior and available.

22:42.040 --> 22:45.920
They use, and this is something I wanted to ask, but they use Go's built-in unit testing

22:45.920 --> 22:46.920
capabilities.

22:46.920 --> 22:49.800
Side note, I think that's the question for next week's episode.

22:49.800 --> 22:51.480
How do you test?

22:51.480 --> 22:52.480
Is it old school?

22:52.480 --> 22:53.480
Is it manual?

22:53.480 --> 22:54.480
You're not testing.

22:54.480 --> 22:59.200
You have very specific methodology for building and testing.

22:59.200 --> 23:00.360
Coder.show slash contact.

23:00.360 --> 23:01.360
How do you test?

23:01.360 --> 23:02.360
I'd love to know that.

23:02.360 --> 23:03.880
But here's the interesting thing that Mike says.

23:03.880 --> 23:07.880
My development machine is the XPS 13, the 9380 version.

23:07.880 --> 23:14.640
Usually docked to a Dell UltraSharp 27 4K monitor, JetBrains for the IDE, and SmartGit

23:14.640 --> 23:16.520
for Git interactions.

23:16.520 --> 23:18.520
Serverless has been great.

23:18.520 --> 23:24.520
Switching to serverless has zero regrets for doing so, and follows the latest best practices

23:24.520 --> 23:28.840
and uses the right CI and CD tools for each deployed environment.

23:28.840 --> 23:29.840
And they love it.

23:29.840 --> 23:32.680
He says, I'd love to hear what people are doing for unit testing.

23:32.680 --> 23:37.640
I've grown increasingly dependent on my unit tests to confidently make changes in my platform.

23:37.640 --> 23:41.080
I'm approaching 4,000 unit tests across my code bases.

23:41.080 --> 23:44.000
I recently upgraded from Angular 9 to 11.

23:44.000 --> 23:47.720
It took me about an hour, and that included patching a few issues I discovered thanks

23:47.720 --> 23:48.720
to my tests.

23:48.720 --> 23:52.040
I couldn't imagine doing it without the tests.

23:52.040 --> 23:54.040
I think it's a great question that Mike brings up.

23:54.040 --> 23:56.440
Mike, listener Mike, how do you test?

23:56.440 --> 23:57.440
Let us know.

23:57.440 --> 23:58.440
Coder.show slash contact.

23:58.440 --> 24:03.400
Yeah, testing is one of those things, you're never going to be where you need to be on

24:03.400 --> 24:04.400
it.

24:04.400 --> 24:07.560
You know, and it bites you in all forms, too, because there's also not just, there's not

24:07.560 --> 24:10.800
just, this is the one that bit me, is my environment.

24:10.800 --> 24:13.380
I updated my environment, and that broke.

24:13.380 --> 24:18.840
And so then production, and a production application broke, and I didn't realize it because I forgot

24:18.840 --> 24:20.600
to test the underlying platform stuff.

24:20.600 --> 24:22.680
I just tested the application.

24:22.680 --> 24:24.600
So that, you know, you're always learning.

24:24.600 --> 24:31.160
It feels, that has to be, I think, I think the mindset is, I'm just going to keep evolving

24:31.160 --> 24:32.960
this all the time.

24:32.960 --> 24:35.640
It's like a checklist that I have for the RV.

24:35.640 --> 24:40.720
I've been driving that RV now for like five years, and I still, from time to time, add

24:40.720 --> 24:42.360
up, I need to start checking this.

24:42.360 --> 24:46.480
In fact, I'm not kidding you, last night I had a nightmare that I forgot to check something

24:46.480 --> 24:49.320
and I was driving down the road with my awning sticking out.

24:49.320 --> 24:52.760
That's when I woke up, I woke up like, crap, did I?

24:52.760 --> 24:54.880
Okay, it was just a dream.

24:54.880 --> 24:58.680
See, if you were wearing a robe, you never would have made that mistake.

24:58.680 --> 25:02.640
No, right, because you have one robe for when you're lounging and one robe for when you're

25:02.640 --> 25:03.640
road ready, obviously.

25:03.640 --> 25:04.640
Oh my god.

25:04.640 --> 25:08.880
Yeah, well, there is room for a multi-robe lifestyle, no doubt about it.

25:08.880 --> 25:11.720
You have your winter robe, your evening robe, and your combat robe.

25:11.720 --> 25:12.960
Well, you clearly have to.

25:12.960 --> 25:15.280
I mean, you don't want to wear your winter robe in the summer.

25:15.280 --> 25:17.600
You wouldn't be comfortable, and the robe's all about being comfortable.

25:17.600 --> 25:20.300
You can't wear a white robe after Labor Day, so.

25:20.300 --> 25:21.720
And not be a gentleman.

25:21.720 --> 25:24.680
And you know, sometimes it's special night with the ladies, you want to have a nice red

25:24.680 --> 25:25.680
velvet robe.

25:25.680 --> 25:26.680
I mean, you might.

25:26.680 --> 25:27.680
I don't know.

25:27.680 --> 25:28.680
Maybe you don't.

25:28.680 --> 25:29.680
It's more black velvet.

25:29.680 --> 25:33.040
I'm with you so far.

25:33.040 --> 25:34.360
Linode.com slash coder.

25:34.360 --> 25:38.320
Go there and receive a $100 60 day credit towards your new account.

25:38.320 --> 25:41.200
Linode is the largest independent cloud for developers.

25:41.200 --> 25:45.280
They're our cloud hosting provider for Jupiter broadcasting right now as we are doing this

25:45.280 --> 25:46.280
show.

25:46.280 --> 25:52.400
We're streaming on a brand new Jupiter.tube PeerTube instance hosted on Linode.

25:52.400 --> 25:56.800
And here's what's great about it is on the back end, I'm using Linode's object storage

25:56.800 --> 25:58.160
to store the videos.

25:58.160 --> 26:02.720
So when we post a video on there, it goes through all the various different coding styles

26:02.720 --> 26:08.640
that you need for like mobile and low resolution and HD, and then it stores them on object

26:08.640 --> 26:09.640
storage in Linode.

26:09.640 --> 26:14.240
And the reason why that is fantastic is not only are those files now available via URL

26:14.240 --> 26:17.960
if we want to link to them directly and it means they download super quick and they load

26:17.960 --> 26:22.520
up in the player super quick, but it means we don't have to like carve off like a terabyte

26:22.520 --> 26:27.760
of block storage and then use like 300 gigs and know that OK, well maybe in like six months

26:27.760 --> 26:31.800
we might be using 700 gigs, so we better go for a terrible like you don't have to do any

26:31.800 --> 26:33.160
of that with object storage.

26:33.160 --> 26:36.880
You just use it as you need it and it's super easy to get access to it because it's all

26:36.880 --> 26:42.820
S3 compatible and Linode costs 30 to 50% less than major cloud providers like AWS, Google

26:42.820 --> 26:44.160
Cloud and Azure.

26:44.160 --> 26:50.720
You get a nice balance of technology and price and you can get something like $5 a month.

26:50.720 --> 26:56.480
What I did for our PeerTube instance is I first we tried it just like a two core machine,

26:56.480 --> 26:59.300
four gigs of RAM and did a proof of concept.

26:59.300 --> 27:02.720
We ran that for about 24 hours.

27:02.720 --> 27:06.440
We got an idea of what we wanted and maybe what we might change and then we just nuked

27:06.440 --> 27:10.560
that one and we just set up a new one in the production data center we want to deploy on

27:10.560 --> 27:15.080
and this time I went for something with four CPU cores so that way we can render video

27:15.080 --> 27:19.580
that gets uploaded and leave a couple of cores available for live streaming and it's all

27:19.580 --> 27:21.680
set up and it's ready to go in seconds.

27:21.680 --> 27:25.440
And if you want to get a gaming server going, they have all of the options right in there

27:25.440 --> 27:30.380
to set up a lot of popular game servers like a like a Minecraft server for example or or

27:30.380 --> 27:34.800
an arc server or many others and they have a lot of the options you might want for the

27:34.800 --> 27:40.480
game server, but like maybe it's a creative world versus survival or any kind of mod settings

27:40.480 --> 27:44.340
you might want, they're all in the setup for you right there and an easy to click use interface

27:44.340 --> 27:47.240
and then you hit deploy and you got your own custom server.

27:47.240 --> 27:50.160
So if you want to use it for your business like we do or you just want to use it for

27:50.160 --> 27:55.780
a personal site or service, get started by going to lano.com slash coder.

28:08.160 --> 28:14.000
So there's some hoopla this week I'm a little worried that we're touching the third rail

28:14.000 --> 28:23.280
on this one because there's there is just so much going on right now where world news

28:23.280 --> 28:30.200
is getting into tech and one kind of hit close to home since we were on the air jet brains

28:30.200 --> 28:36.960
really went under the magnet magnifying scope thing what do you call it microscope microscope

28:36.960 --> 28:40.720
thank you jet brains got kind of called out in a way for potentially being like a back

28:40.720 --> 28:45.320
door for Russian hackers and really got a lot of fun throwing at it.

28:45.320 --> 28:51.280
Yeah well that was brought to us by the little bull so and the New York Times actually yes

28:51.280 --> 28:55.840
yeah yeah they said there that Russian hackers may have piggybacked on a tool developed by

28:55.840 --> 29:01.280
jet brains which is based in the Czech Republic to gain access to federal government and private

29:01.280 --> 29:05.880
sector systems you know all the solar winds they say American intelligence agencies and

29:05.880 --> 29:11.720
private cyber security investigators are examining the role of the widely used company jet brains

29:11.720 --> 29:17.960
in a far reaching Russian hacking officials are investigating whether the company founded

29:17.960 --> 29:24.240
by three Russian engineers in the Czech Republic with research labs in Russia were breached

29:24.240 --> 29:29.640
and used as a pathway for hackers to insert back doors into the software jet brains said

29:29.640 --> 29:36.300
on Wednesday that it was not aware of any investigation at all nor is aware of any compromise

29:36.300 --> 29:43.480
and that the team is trying to get more information from the FBI does everything to Russia yeah

29:43.480 --> 29:49.240
I know right and you know it's it's unnamed U.S. officials it's unnamed cyber security

29:49.240 --> 29:55.780
experts and they say things like security experts warn that months long intrusion could

29:55.780 --> 30:00.840
be the biggest breach of the United States network in history but that's like well yeah

30:00.840 --> 30:06.400
okay if all this is true and they compromise systems and they were in for a month or three

30:06.400 --> 30:11.000
then yeah it'd be a really big deal but they throw that in there as if it's already true

30:11.000 --> 30:17.560
as if it's already happened it's it's bull so gather around children when you are hosting

30:17.560 --> 30:23.560
software yourself that you buy from a vendor such as I don't know team cities a popular

30:23.560 --> 30:29.220
solution that jet brain sells and you do not update said software or you are not managing

30:29.220 --> 30:34.520
your hosting right that can be a problem I have a huge issue here because the way the

30:34.520 --> 30:39.600
story was reported it makes it sound like like the jet brains like they're updating

30:39.600 --> 30:44.920
tool or whatever was completely compromised all the solar winds right not the case what

30:44.920 --> 30:50.240
it looks like and you know no one's gonna confirm this yet but I'm hoping that at some

30:50.240 --> 30:56.480
point they do is that there were at least one potentially more unpatched out-of-date

30:56.480 --> 31:04.120
improperly configured team city instances that were being self-hosted by various customers

31:04.120 --> 31:09.600
and that is a vector for compromise just like if you have an unpatched out-of-date WordPress

31:09.600 --> 31:20.120
instance on a server somewhere right so this is nonsense it's nuanced because

31:20.120 --> 31:26.000
it involves understanding that software can be created by a company and deployed by a

31:26.000 --> 31:30.400
user incorrectly and then be used as a vector of attack and if you don't understand that

31:30.400 --> 31:35.080
nuance it just looks like well jet brain sells a bad product right you have to understand

31:35.080 --> 31:40.900
that if a customer is hosting a vendor software and managing it themselves that they are ultimately

31:40.900 --> 31:45.080
responsible for the security of said software yeah and I actually think that's the biggest

31:45.080 --> 31:49.520
disservice by kind of labeling all of this as nation state attacks it sort of reduces

31:49.520 --> 31:54.120
the responsibility of the sys admins that set that up in the first place like that's

31:54.120 --> 31:58.740
on them they set that up incorrectly and it didn't really take somebody with sophistication

31:58.740 --> 32:03.760
it took somebody who was willing to crawl the web and I when I saw this what my first

32:03.760 --> 32:08.680
thought was is how does this impact a guy like Mike who maybe has clients who know he

32:08.680 --> 32:14.280
uses these tools do you worry about it hurting your reputation by association I actually

32:14.280 --> 32:18.480
took to Twitter as one does these days because I was pretty concerned right because we use

32:18.480 --> 32:23.040
Ruby bind we use pie charm it's we're basically a jeopardy shop we actually don't use team

32:23.040 --> 32:29.800
city though so there's that yeah it's it's not great right I don't you know is it going

32:29.800 --> 32:35.860
to make us dramatically change our tooling no VS code is slowly but surely making us

32:35.860 --> 32:42.280
do that yeah I mean if I was using team city I think I might be more concerned having said

32:42.280 --> 32:47.280
that now that they're you know publicly in caps and red letters with the hammer and sickle

32:47.280 --> 32:52.760
next to it publicly known to like non people in the industry as a Russian company which

32:52.760 --> 32:59.800
they are not from the Czech Republic different country that maybe isn't great having said

32:59.800 --> 33:04.280
that a lot of my clients particularly those in like regulated industries also are JetBrains

33:04.280 --> 33:09.900
customers so you know if you're doing Java you're probably wanting you're at least looking

33:09.900 --> 33:15.200
at IntelliJ it may be that their brand and reputation withstands this but yeah I think

33:15.200 --> 33:19.440
they had they're gonna get some crap from like people like honestly stupid congressmen

33:19.440 --> 33:26.040
who are gonna want to like grandstand right yeah I hope I hope there's nothing to be concerned

33:26.040 --> 33:33.240
about I I guess I'd be lying if I didn't say now I kind of have like a bit of doubt about

33:33.240 --> 33:38.280
the company like just a little bit of hmm you know okay like I'm gonna kind of keep

33:38.280 --> 33:42.240
my eye on them now and I think that's super unfortunate because they don't deserve that

33:42.240 --> 33:45.720
before that their action so far had had really you know what they've done is they've made

33:45.720 --> 33:48.740
a good product and they've charged for that product and that seems like it's been a pretty

33:48.740 --> 33:53.520
good business model so maybe this will blow over I hope I don't think it's gonna really

33:53.520 --> 33:57.480
affect them I mean it might I could see it may be affecting like the team city line which

33:57.480 --> 34:01.880
I sure I don't mean to downplay that I know that's a big product for them but just not

34:01.880 --> 34:07.040
the way I run my process so not something I'm interested in I mean I just just like

34:07.040 --> 34:12.720
from my own experience switching the entire IDE infrastructure and the plugins and all

34:12.720 --> 34:17.080
the custom crap you've probably written for them for your entire company based on one

34:17.080 --> 34:23.840
very shoddily reported New York Times article that sounds expensive and bad so okay now

34:23.840 --> 34:27.760
the other thing that's obviously going on right now that has huge ramifications for

34:27.760 --> 34:33.840
our industry is parlor as we recorded now is offline I'm not really familiar with it

34:33.840 --> 34:38.400
but I know it's a social network that's like an alternative to Twitter that has gotten

34:38.400 --> 34:43.400
famous for a lot of well-known people on the right to switch to it after Twitter had started

34:43.400 --> 34:47.320
fact-checking or whatever and you know this whole thing is all kind of been going down

34:47.320 --> 34:52.140
for the last couple weeks if you want more context you can always check out unfiltered

34:52.140 --> 34:55.440
unfiltered.show but there's been a lot of changes a lot of things have been happening

34:55.440 --> 35:01.840
very fast and sometimes you know I think for the better and some I think have have been

35:01.840 --> 35:07.760
sort of like oh boy now the genie's out of the bottle on that one and an AWS pulling

35:07.760 --> 35:13.720
the plug on parlor that was a moment where I went oh whoa well that feels like a whole

35:13.720 --> 35:17.000
other level did you get that sense?

35:17.000 --> 35:21.360
So I gotta be honest with you I don't know what the hell parlor was until this week.

35:21.360 --> 35:26.520
Yeah they went from being famous to offline in about a week.

35:26.520 --> 35:32.680
And I just want to like make sure I understand it's effectively Twitter right but like with

35:32.680 --> 35:33.680
no rules?

35:33.680 --> 35:39.100
Right right well I don't know I really don't know about that but I know that it's been

35:39.100 --> 35:44.040
like promoted as like the free speech social media or whatever which of course attracts

35:44.040 --> 35:46.120
all kinds right.

35:46.120 --> 35:50.080
The question that I had after this happened is it's one thing right if Twitter says okay

35:50.080 --> 35:53.820
we're gonna close your account because that's their service well AWS that's really kind

35:53.820 --> 35:58.980
of become like the infrastructure of the internet that's a whole other level and a lot of dominoes

35:58.980 --> 36:00.160
fall after that.

36:00.160 --> 36:04.720
So but it wasn't AWS first right it was the App Store I think right?

36:04.720 --> 36:07.760
Right Google Play and then the App Store.

36:07.760 --> 36:13.200
And then like Dio preemptively came out and said they wouldn't host them.

36:13.200 --> 36:16.700
So like there's a lot of weirdness here right there's a lot of reporting that like maybe

36:16.700 --> 36:20.080
the guy who founded parlor's wife is a Russian spy.

36:20.080 --> 36:21.080
Oh Russian?

36:21.080 --> 36:27.720
A Russian and this makes me want to talk about honey traps for a minute.

36:27.720 --> 36:35.520
You have Unfilter we have this I have my company where are these Russian women for us Chris?

36:35.520 --> 36:38.200
Where were they when we needed them?

36:38.200 --> 36:40.560
Where is our honey trap money is what you're saying?

36:40.560 --> 36:43.520
Right you want the you want the girl and the investment in rubles.

36:43.520 --> 36:48.360
I mean Jupiter Broadcasting is a podcast network has a reach that far exceeds many very popular

36:48.360 --> 36:49.360
magazines.

36:49.360 --> 36:53.400
You know somebody ought to be in here you know getting some propaganda in this we got

36:53.400 --> 36:57.880
a platform but no none of that Putin money.

36:57.880 --> 37:00.000
Just like a little gas prof cash.

37:00.000 --> 37:04.760
Yeah they got tons of oil money man come on they got so much oil money that they used

37:04.760 --> 37:09.200
to build nuclear powered lighthouses have you looked that up have you seen that on YouTube?

37:09.200 --> 37:10.200
No that's nuts.

37:10.200 --> 37:15.240
One of these days you should look up nuclear powered lighthouses blow your mind what they

37:15.240 --> 37:16.240
were doing.

37:16.240 --> 37:21.720
So come on just a little bit our way would you but I agree what I find to be interesting

37:21.720 --> 37:26.280
is the details that have come out now that parlor is suing Amazon it kind of because

37:26.280 --> 37:29.920
in the lawsuit it sheds a little bit of light on Amazon's rationale for banning parlor they

37:29.920 --> 37:35.440
say this is according to Amazon the team said that it was troubled by repeated policy violations

37:35.440 --> 37:40.320
the email cited 98 posts that incited violence it included screenshots of a call to hang

37:40.320 --> 37:47.240
traders as well as exoneration to start systematically assassinating liberal leaders and supporters

37:47.240 --> 37:51.240
of the black lives movement matter and others in January.

37:51.240 --> 37:54.360
Amazon said publicly they cannot provide services to a customer that is unable to effectively

37:54.360 --> 37:57.120
identify and remove content that encourages or incites violence.

37:57.120 --> 38:01.200
I mean if that you know that kind of that kind of stuff like OK well where does Amazon

38:01.200 --> 38:02.200
draw the line.

38:02.200 --> 38:05.880
Maybe that is where they should be drawing the line but it was just still kind of surprising.

38:05.880 --> 38:08.120
I mean obviously all that stuff is gross right.

38:08.120 --> 38:09.120
Yeah.

38:09.120 --> 38:13.600
I have no defense for it but I do wonder like if you're if you're a small startup and you're

38:13.600 --> 38:18.240
doing some kind of platform does that mean like if you just like fail to moderate your

38:18.240 --> 38:22.240
platform because you're like three guys in a dorm room AWS is going to kick you off if

38:22.240 --> 38:23.240
you get big enough.

38:23.240 --> 38:27.920
I think it definitely means that now because I feel like I mean I don't think any of that

38:27.920 --> 38:33.760
stuff is good and this climate will make it such that any service that is centralized is

38:33.760 --> 38:35.240
vulnerable like that.

38:35.240 --> 38:39.120
Well that's problematic.

38:39.120 --> 38:46.640
I mean we think of Twitter as like the strongly you know kind of like woke moderated platform.

38:46.640 --> 38:48.880
Back in the day Twitter was a garbage pit.

38:48.880 --> 38:49.880
Good point.

38:49.880 --> 38:53.000
Remember Twitter porn which is still a thing but it was like people were doing revenge

38:53.000 --> 38:56.400
porn and like harassment of girlfriends and boyfriends.

38:56.400 --> 39:00.760
If you actually look at the whole history of Twitter it may have been more of a garbage

39:00.760 --> 39:04.480
platform for longer than it's been a woke politically correct platform.

39:04.480 --> 39:05.480
Right.

39:05.480 --> 39:10.840
And then it just you need money to like moderate this crap right like that's one and they want

39:10.840 --> 39:11.840
to sell ads.

39:11.840 --> 39:16.720
Well but like you at some point moderation requires actual moderators and humans are

39:16.720 --> 39:17.720
expensive.

39:17.720 --> 39:18.840
That's my point.

39:18.840 --> 39:24.640
So like I wonder if this is the standard which I kind of am coming dangerously close to saying

39:24.640 --> 39:27.000
this shouldn't have happened which I kind of don't agree with because if you're calling

39:27.000 --> 39:31.800
for political assassinations that's obviously not good and potentially a crime.

39:31.800 --> 39:37.320
But could you make a new Twitter in a dorm room or a new Facebook in a dorm room and

39:37.320 --> 39:42.760
actually satisfy these requirements in a realistic way.

39:42.760 --> 39:46.880
The reason why I say no is because this isn't where it ends.

39:46.880 --> 39:48.080
OK where does it go.

39:48.080 --> 39:49.420
It's an evolving issue.

39:49.420 --> 39:56.200
Not only is a loud speech an evolving and usually narrowing issue but I really kind

39:56.200 --> 40:00.840
of am concerned about other issues that don't seem that impossible.

40:00.840 --> 40:08.680
I could see even within 2021 it comes up a pretty big debate about the US law requiring

40:08.680 --> 40:10.720
back doors and encryption.

40:10.720 --> 40:14.840
It was something that the Obama administration fought for really hard.

40:14.840 --> 40:21.040
It was something that I mean you can find tons of James Comey on YouTube talking about

40:21.040 --> 40:26.280
it and I could see the issue too if radicalization in the US is becoming a bigger and bigger

40:26.280 --> 40:32.320
problem then the need to get access to these private communications is going to become

40:32.320 --> 40:34.160
a bigger and bigger issue.

40:34.160 --> 40:41.720
And so what happens when a service refuses to do that and what is going to be sort of

40:41.720 --> 40:43.960
the system's response to that.

40:43.960 --> 40:47.960
And so just like you may have to moderate or else you're going to be held liable you're

40:47.960 --> 40:52.680
also likely going to have to meet legal requirements when it comes to encryption to operate in

40:52.680 --> 40:53.680
the US.

40:53.680 --> 40:55.600
That's also going to tighten the noose a little bit.

40:55.600 --> 41:00.840
I mean so that's just that's just one example of how the goalpost will always be moved because

41:00.840 --> 41:03.160
society is always always moving.

41:03.160 --> 41:10.300
So you kind of get down to the argument of things change whatever you have to change

41:10.300 --> 41:11.300
with them.

41:11.300 --> 41:15.200
But do you let the market decide that and like you just fail if your platform sucks.

41:15.200 --> 41:21.360
Well I mean you feel you figure if this is if this becomes the new normal it will create

41:21.360 --> 41:24.000
demand for something that's not censored.

41:24.000 --> 41:27.600
It will create demand for something not if you can't host it anymore.

41:27.600 --> 41:28.600
Well yeah.

41:28.600 --> 41:32.680
Or you have to use the tools like you have to build your own system you have to build

41:32.680 --> 41:35.840
your own email server you have to host that yourself you have to build your own e-commerce

41:35.840 --> 41:36.840
platform.

41:36.840 --> 41:39.440
Yeah but that's that's such a lift.

41:39.440 --> 41:43.400
I mean but it is easier than ever.

41:43.400 --> 41:44.400
You know.

41:44.400 --> 41:45.400
True.

41:45.400 --> 41:48.320
There's a lot of packages out there or Docker images or you know I mean there's a lot of

41:48.320 --> 41:49.600
options out there.

41:49.600 --> 41:51.120
See I'm very of two minds on this.

41:51.120 --> 41:55.480
I don't like obviously what I've seen of Parler is probably the worst of it right.

41:55.480 --> 41:57.600
Because it's right when it got taken down.

41:57.600 --> 41:58.600
Yeah.

41:58.600 --> 42:02.080
But I have no problem with like a private business saying hey because I think you guys

42:02.080 --> 42:04.280
are you know unacceptable.

42:04.280 --> 42:08.240
I would use a different word but we're not going to serve you anymore.

42:08.240 --> 42:13.000
You know we're not a public utility and you like if I just like fired a client because

42:13.000 --> 42:17.340
whatever or I refuse to take a client because of whatever it's I think when you get into

42:17.340 --> 42:22.320
cases like it's all it's less the AWS when it's more the app store one that kind of bothers

42:22.320 --> 42:27.800
me a little bit because it's like there is no other way to develop on that platform.

42:27.800 --> 42:33.360
Yeah well the web but yeah yeah but you're you're gimped in a lot of ways right.

42:33.360 --> 42:37.120
And history has shown us specifically with social media platforms people want a native

42:37.120 --> 42:38.120
local app.

42:38.120 --> 42:41.520
Well because they want to do photos want to do filters and it's possible but it's never

42:41.520 --> 42:43.200
going to be as good of an experience.

42:43.200 --> 42:47.920
But again like I wish it wasn't parlor do you know what I mean it would be easier to

42:47.920 --> 42:53.400
kind of get on my heels and be like you know like when hey.com got like pushed around by

42:53.400 --> 42:55.840
Apple that that was easy right right.

42:55.840 --> 43:02.240
This is like well you guys actually did like a way way over any reasonable line you know.

43:02.240 --> 43:07.000
So I don't know I I sort of miss and this is where we're going to be a little you and

43:07.000 --> 43:12.720
I are going to pour one out for Sun I sort of miss the ideal of like the 90s when like

43:12.720 --> 43:16.840
the Internet was becoming a thing and people are just going to develop their software man

43:16.840 --> 43:21.880
and you download the member shareware and it'd be great and we'd be happy and you'd

43:21.880 --> 43:24.760
have like a million little dev shops doing all these crazy things.

43:24.760 --> 43:28.240
And they'd be like news groups that would specifically be like for these types of people

43:28.240 --> 43:32.640
in software that really geek out about this particular thing and computers and that was

43:32.640 --> 43:33.640
great.

43:33.640 --> 43:38.080
I actually still have a very active Usenet connection to you really.

43:38.080 --> 43:42.400
I do I do although I don't quite use it for the same thing anymore but I do follow what

43:42.400 --> 43:43.440
you mean.

43:43.440 --> 43:51.680
And also I guess this is me being an old man but I yearn for a time before Twitter.

43:51.680 --> 43:52.680
Yeah.

43:52.680 --> 43:56.000
Like things were so much better in a lot of ways.

43:56.000 --> 44:03.000
Just slowing the pace of conversation and allowing time for thought and deliberation

44:03.000 --> 44:07.820
and not creating a discourse where your goal is to get as many likes and retweets as possible

44:07.820 --> 44:12.440
so you're always turning the dial up so that we always are getting people engaged.

44:12.440 --> 44:14.720
I think it just brings out the worst in people.

44:14.720 --> 44:15.920
It's negative incentives right.

44:15.920 --> 44:21.400
You're always like I look at my own stats because I'm a I see I'm an attention enthusiast

44:21.400 --> 44:24.620
I was going to say something else there and it's just true.

44:24.620 --> 44:30.360
Like if I can say something mean about Linux that like triples engagement if I say something

44:30.360 --> 44:34.400
nice about Linux it doubles it if I say something negative about Apple forget about it I can't

44:34.400 --> 44:36.520
even keep up with the notifications.

44:36.520 --> 44:37.680
That's so true.

44:37.680 --> 44:43.400
It's like yes for sure yes yes and if we really wanted to play the game we'd intentionally

44:43.400 --> 44:48.280
say something incendiary about Linux or Apple and then we'd cut it and we'd clip it and

44:48.280 --> 44:53.760
then we'd post that as a standalone bite on Twitter and blast it out off to the races.

44:53.760 --> 44:54.760
Right.

44:54.760 --> 44:55.760
Yeah.

44:55.760 --> 44:56.760
And that's what people do.

44:56.760 --> 44:57.760
It's just all right.

44:57.760 --> 45:03.440
Well so let's let's shift gears to a little bit of tech because in your M1 endeavors one

45:03.440 --> 45:07.160
of the things we were talking about last week specifically was the state of Docker and not

45:07.160 --> 45:09.800
being ready for the M1 platform.

45:09.800 --> 45:13.420
I guess have you had any more experiences with trying to get Docker working on that

45:13.420 --> 45:15.300
sucker is the situation improved.

45:15.300 --> 45:19.680
So there is a development release of a Docker version for the M1.

45:19.680 --> 45:20.680
OK.

45:20.680 --> 45:22.400
It's still in dev mode.

45:22.400 --> 45:26.780
It's it's not there yet but you know like we talked about when this M1 first came out

45:26.780 --> 45:30.960
this is going to be a problem that Docker is going to solve pretty quickly.

45:30.960 --> 45:31.960
Yes sure.

45:31.960 --> 45:34.720
I would bet my hat in 60 days we're not talking about this anymore.

45:34.720 --> 45:37.080
That seems pretty aggressive but.

45:37.080 --> 45:42.440
So do you know like they must be doing some sort of VM right.

45:42.440 --> 45:43.700
They must be doing some sort of.

45:43.700 --> 45:48.280
They have to move over to Apple's new hypervisor is the problem which you know to be honest

45:48.280 --> 45:52.840
with you I mean maybe it's totally flushed out but you kind of wonder like what's this

45:52.840 --> 45:57.440
how complete of a product how solid is just that because it seems like those are that's

45:57.440 --> 46:02.760
new plumbing for the OS to begin with and it may be one of those things that needs a

46:02.760 --> 46:07.320
little bit iteration itself but it is interesting to see that they're just plugging away at

46:07.320 --> 46:08.320
it.

46:08.320 --> 46:09.720
I'm just I was just going through it.

46:09.720 --> 46:13.160
Yeah it looks and it looks like they're getting a pretty good amount of engagement too.

46:13.160 --> 46:14.960
So it's going to it'll get there won't it.

46:14.960 --> 46:15.960
You're probably right.

46:15.960 --> 46:16.960
I don't know.

46:16.960 --> 46:17.960
You.

46:17.960 --> 46:22.920
The only thing I think your prediction is just a little optimistic if that new set of

46:22.920 --> 46:27.720
virtualization APIs and Mac OS ends up being kind of half baked then there's really not

46:27.720 --> 46:30.040
it's a kind of out of Docker's hands there's nothing they can do.

46:30.040 --> 46:34.360
I would be very surprised if that's the case because remember people want to run Windows

46:34.360 --> 46:43.040
on Mac too in VMS and that's like a core feature for them data dog dot com slash coder radio

46:43.040 --> 46:48.760
data dog is the unified monitoring and analytics platform that gives you comprehensive visibility

46:48.760 --> 46:52.560
into cloud hybrid and multi cloud environments.

46:52.560 --> 46:56.260
The key is you can really quickly analyze the performance of your Linux servers and

46:56.260 --> 47:02.260
applications in real time you get customizable dashboards that are beautiful.

47:02.260 --> 47:06.120
You should go to data dog dot com slash coder radio just to kind of get an idea of what

47:06.120 --> 47:07.240
the UI is like.

47:07.240 --> 47:10.440
But the nice thing is is these dashboards give you the ability to do all kinds of things

47:10.440 --> 47:14.520
like troubleshoot issues in seconds get a unified view of your metrics your traces your

47:14.520 --> 47:21.880
logs all in one place and they have just turnkey integrations for over 400 different technologies

47:21.880 --> 47:25.560
and you can use data dog as a monitor your Linux boxes the containers and the applications

47:25.560 --> 47:30.580
inside them and then pull in metrics and other data from the rest of your entire stack across

47:30.580 --> 47:36.240
multiple clouds to get visibility and health into the performance of your entire infrastructure

47:36.240 --> 47:37.580
and applications.

47:37.580 --> 47:43.180
So do this get started by going to data dog dot com slash coder radio start a free trial

47:43.180 --> 47:47.080
create a dashboard and data dog will send you a T-shirt.

47:47.080 --> 47:48.580
Yep that's awesome.

47:48.580 --> 47:52.400
It's a nice looking T-shirt too you see when you go to the data dog dot com slash coder

47:52.400 --> 47:58.160
radio URL and that's a great way to get started experience the UI and how you can lay it out.

47:58.160 --> 48:03.480
It's so slick data dog dot com slash coder radio go there start a free trial get one

48:03.480 --> 48:07.340
dashboard set up and then you get yourself a free T-shirt.

48:07.340 --> 48:10.840
Thanks to data dog for sponsoring the coder radio program and thanks to everybody who

48:10.840 --> 48:17.160
supports our show by going to data dog dot com slash coder radio.

48:17.160 --> 48:21.180
So let's do a little M1 update.

48:21.180 --> 48:24.360
You must have a little bit better sense of the battery life at this point.

48:24.360 --> 48:25.360
Days.

48:25.360 --> 48:26.360
Days.

48:26.360 --> 48:27.360
It's out of control.

48:27.360 --> 48:29.480
I actually forgot where I put the charger.

48:29.480 --> 48:34.980
You know I gosh I got I am thinking maybe I I'm trying not to talk myself into buying

48:34.980 --> 48:36.700
one and then you.

48:36.700 --> 48:37.700
You need to do it.

48:37.700 --> 48:38.700
Yeah.

48:38.700 --> 48:39.700
Yeah.

48:39.700 --> 48:40.700
Yeah.

48:40.700 --> 48:41.700
Just get the air get.

48:41.700 --> 48:42.700
I don't.

48:42.700 --> 48:43.700
So I did bump it to 16.

48:43.700 --> 48:46.160
If I should if I was going to do it I should have done it as like a Christmas gift for

48:46.160 --> 48:49.880
my wife or something you know you should have done it at the end of the year for the

48:49.880 --> 48:50.880
write off.

48:50.880 --> 48:53.560
I just missed the taxi window too.

48:53.560 --> 48:56.240
I wonder if those business now I shouldn't even I shouldn't even do a business.

48:56.240 --> 49:01.360
I just I am kind of curious about what it's generally like and you know people been telling

49:01.360 --> 49:04.360
me that it's something you really got to experience to fully understand.

49:04.360 --> 49:05.360
All right.

49:05.360 --> 49:07.780
I am going to tell you right now.

49:07.780 --> 49:14.020
Giving having given it a second chance and less of like a whatever kind of I snarky I.

49:14.020 --> 49:19.840
Yeah it is my favorite computer that I have ever owned ever ever even like the nostalgia

49:19.840 --> 49:22.680
days of of years past.

49:22.680 --> 49:25.840
I wish it ran Snow Leopard.

49:25.840 --> 49:29.880
By the way if you're not blacked out by now you're going to be in trouble.

49:29.880 --> 49:32.360
Yeah that's got to be on somebody's drinking game.

49:32.360 --> 49:34.640
I mean yeah Big Sur is no snow leopard.

49:34.640 --> 49:37.000
Big Sur is the worst part of it.

49:37.000 --> 49:44.600
But just like not having to think about plugging in and this thing goes from asleep to I'm

49:44.600 --> 49:52.760
in my works workspace in like almost instantaneously that is nice and somebody saying but Linux

49:52.760 --> 49:59.800
in the chat Gavin is I'm hoping that system 76 or Dell or one of those guys can somehow

49:59.800 --> 50:12.320
match this because the hardware benefits the speed the no fan no fan it's it's awesome

50:12.320 --> 50:22.600
like it I literally I like maybe I could see a world where I just work on a MacBook Air

50:22.600 --> 50:26.720
for a while because that's the for those who don't listen every week that's the model I

50:26.720 --> 50:32.440
have the MacBook Air it's I mean it's fast enough even in Rosetta I don't notice any

50:32.440 --> 50:37.120
noticeable slowdowns I mean obviously the iMac Pro and the Thaleo have like more RAM

50:37.120 --> 50:40.640
and dedicated GPU so that's a little like certain things are a little unfair right like

50:40.640 --> 50:47.480
the Thaleo runs the flight simulator the air doesn't for obvious reasons but as a day-to-day

50:47.480 --> 50:54.360
computer if the apocalypse ever ends and I can go on trips again having a laptop that

50:54.360 --> 50:59.960
one has no fan and two barely ever needs to be charged is gonna be a game changer for

50:59.960 --> 51:04.200
me yeah the battery life seems just like it would be it would fundamentally change the

51:04.200 --> 51:09.240
way I would use the computer oh and as more people have it particularly like them the

51:09.240 --> 51:16.080
Super Mac community a lot of the like pain points I experienced the first go-around have

51:16.080 --> 51:21.480
just either been people know workarounds or have been resolved and honestly when stuff

51:21.480 --> 51:26.400
starts getting ported to ARM I think I'm gonna see additional performance increases from

51:26.400 --> 51:30.400
where I'm at now yeah that's kind of the funny thing huh it's not even as fast as it's gonna

51:30.400 --> 51:36.080
be in a year right this machine like if I can manage not to pour a goddamn martini into

51:36.080 --> 51:42.480
it or Earl Gray depending on the week it might actually last me more than six months yeah

51:42.480 --> 51:46.240
which is you know that's a lot of commitment for me you know I'm a little good little shy

51:46.240 --> 51:50.120
you know I mean you just miss it but that is that Linux thing is the major blocker for

51:50.120 --> 51:55.160
me that's why I ended up going the route of the x1 and then tried out the XPS 13 and now

51:55.160 --> 52:01.360
I was I was fantasy specking myself a galago pro they don't have the dedicated Nvidia graphics

52:01.360 --> 52:07.480
until February though we all know I'm a shell for system 76 I'm joking by the way people

52:07.480 --> 52:13.360
have read it I am not in fact a show I can't unhear the galago's fan now yeah no fan is

52:13.360 --> 52:17.960
such a big deal too I love that for recording especially recording when I'm on the go like

52:17.960 --> 52:24.840
even the iMac Pro oh gosh oh no oh no don't stop it stop it I can't think about it but

52:24.840 --> 52:29.380
that no fan deal no fan that no fan is a big deal because when I'm on the go my mic is

52:29.380 --> 52:35.820
often right next to my laptop I am super tempted to just take because I've I mean this is way

52:35.820 --> 52:40.560
inside how Mike setting up his new workstation but I have two workstations once the Thalia

52:40.560 --> 52:47.440
because it does specific things and once the iMac because I stupidly bought an iMac Pro

52:47.440 --> 52:52.480
I sort of think the iMac Pro is just gonna become the MacBook Air workstation and that's

52:52.480 --> 52:56.140
it what do you mean you're not even gonna use it I keep going back and forth but like

52:56.140 --> 53:02.880
every time the fan kicks in a part of my soul dies you're like what what is this the 90s

53:02.880 --> 53:08.560
what is this spin and rest in this thing yeah it's like it's like my dog's hair like just

53:08.560 --> 53:13.360
caking in this piece of crap like you know I don't want to tempt you because you are

53:13.360 --> 53:19.400
like super Linux guy but it's the it's the damn console vacation of computers and it's

53:19.400 --> 53:24.520
so frustrating you know don't don't don't buy one because the fan you you will you won't

53:24.520 --> 53:30.200
go back right fanlessness yeah it really is it is frustrating because a lot of the performance

53:30.200 --> 53:35.920
it really appeals to me the battery life the no fan really appeals to me I also I am I'm

53:35.920 --> 53:39.560
pretty convinced that it's just a great chip like Apple probably really knows what they're

53:39.560 --> 53:43.080
doing and it's sort of the ultimate expression of their idea of a computer where that's an

53:43.080 --> 53:47.780
all-in-one that they build from the ground up the hardware OS all of it it's an interesting

53:47.780 --> 53:53.000
idea but without that escape hatch you've been able to load Linux on there I'm just

53:53.000 --> 53:57.640
like it just wouldn't be as useful for me it would be a slam dunk if I was still in

53:57.640 --> 54:02.280
a corporate environment and I had a lot of meetings and calendar invites and all that

54:02.280 --> 54:06.120
kind of you know just stuff that you want to stay up to date with and all that and ran

54:06.120 --> 54:11.340
slack a lot and did all that like I could see it for sure but right now like my main

54:11.340 --> 54:15.160
production tools they haven't been ported to m1 so there's that as well so I'd be running

54:15.160 --> 54:22.240
a lot of stuff under Rosetta well I will say like one of the more interesting effects that

54:22.240 --> 54:30.200
it's had on me I'm weirdly getting used to like native Mac apps again and I'm getting

54:30.200 --> 54:34.720
like you mentioned slack I'm getting increasingly frustrated with slack because it's such an

54:34.720 --> 54:39.120
obvious electron app and doesn't like follow the conventions the right way of for those

54:39.120 --> 54:42.440
who have been listening for a long time I was an iOS developer back when you sort of

54:42.440 --> 54:47.280
like that was like full-time what I did so I lived in the Mac for like ever before I

54:47.280 --> 54:51.720
even really did much with Linux other than college which you know everybody fools around

54:51.720 --> 54:57.720
with Linux in college the like poorly done electron apps really stand out on Mac OS where

54:57.720 --> 55:02.560
they don't on Linux to me I think part of that is just like there's such conventions

55:02.560 --> 55:07.560
on Mac for like how the keyboard shortcuts are supposed to work yep yep we're on Linux

55:07.560 --> 55:10.160
everything is kind of like written in its own weird way and you just have to know the

55:10.160 --> 55:17.560
application but like airmail fantastical and no fan yeah I'm just gonna keep saying it

55:17.560 --> 55:22.600
Chris yeah I do hear that imagine sitting in your rope with no fan yeah you know you

55:22.600 --> 55:27.560
know my my x1 and the XPS 13 I really don't they do have a fan but it's very minimal don't

55:27.560 --> 55:30.660
hear it much so it's my it's getting much better on the Intel side too with the later

55:30.660 --> 55:37.240
processors but you know I think for me my I would I mean the battery life does sound

55:37.240 --> 55:40.880
really good I don't know I'd be tempted I'd be really tempted if they had if some of my

55:40.880 --> 55:44.800
production applications were ported I mean I already am tempted I'm just always tempted

55:44.800 --> 55:50.640
from a technological like tinkering standpoint my one concern is how can they ladder this

55:50.640 --> 55:55.840
up to like a MacBook Pro 16 because if they can actually do that with with like a similar

55:55.840 --> 56:01.260
performance increase that you would have gotten from the errors of Intel age and the sixteens

56:01.260 --> 56:06.760
of you know the last whatever with the I nines I think right if they have the same delta

56:06.760 --> 56:13.080
of performance those machines why would you not get one yeah I just I will right I mean

56:13.080 --> 56:17.960
yeah if anything where like especially for the unfiltered show because I do I do that

56:17.960 --> 56:21.680
all the processing myself there's no editor anything you know an hour and a half show

56:21.680 --> 56:26.320
takes forever to process it really is a pain in the butt don't even don't even get me started

56:26.320 --> 56:33.000
on trying to encode that much video it just is a time it just takes forever it's like

56:33.000 --> 56:36.880
you work all day on something and then it's the evening and you just want to go home and

56:36.880 --> 56:41.720
you're sitting here waiting while your laptop just maxes out and anything that may be dramatically

56:41.720 --> 56:46.040
improved that time would would be pretty hard for me to say no to I've actually thought

56:46.040 --> 56:51.760
about to like well you know the nice thing about the PC architecture is it is possible

56:51.760 --> 56:59.160
to build a just all out powerhouse PC system that outflanks anything an M1 machine could

56:59.160 --> 57:04.440
do you know you could you could really get like a thread ripper going 128 gigs of RAM

57:04.440 --> 57:11.080
four terabytes of PCIe SSD storage you know you could really put a nice GPU in there and

57:11.080 --> 57:16.160
get something that really cranks maybe like an AMD 6800 series GPU and that thing and

57:16.160 --> 57:22.840
it would blast the doors off the M1 I suspect but you know I'd be looking at three thirty

57:22.840 --> 57:27.000
five hundred you know four or five thousand dollars if it's a pre-built you know maybe

57:27.000 --> 57:32.040
even more of it you know six seven depending on the on the manufacturer and it just feels

57:32.040 --> 57:38.440
like give it a year and a half and there and Apple's gonna lap it but it is it has crossed

57:38.440 --> 57:42.240
my mind and it's what drew you know if drew was on the show right now what he'd be telling

57:42.240 --> 57:48.740
me I bet you is build a really powerful Linux system and do all the production tools under

57:48.740 --> 57:55.880
Linux and with a combination of wine and native tools and get 90% of the benefit with without

57:55.880 --> 58:00.680
having to switch platforms because that's the one thing that's still nice about x86

58:00.680 --> 58:05.480
right is if your work case demands it you can really build a system that's really specific

58:05.480 --> 58:09.800
to you and what I struggle with Apple now is the console vacation of these machines

58:09.800 --> 58:15.560
it's like yeah okay I could I could get the same exact thing in various varieties either

58:15.560 --> 58:20.560
with active cooling or without and I can run one operating system and it's not even one

58:20.560 --> 58:24.240
I particularly want to run I don't want to run Big Sur like I probably wouldn't buy a

58:24.240 --> 58:30.000
PC that only ran Windows 10 and it's just that is enough friction that I haven't pulled

58:30.000 --> 58:33.960
the trigger yet but in reality I'm not going to build that rise and thread ripper system

58:33.960 --> 58:38.160
I don't have time to do that I don't have the funds I'm not going to do it but I like

58:38.160 --> 58:43.120
that it's still possible and that's not an option with the M1 I mean your best bet is

58:43.120 --> 58:47.080
adding compute via Thunderbolt but you can't even do an eGPU at this point at some point

58:47.080 --> 58:52.360
we need to talk about eGPUs again because that that was the dream that never came yeah

58:52.360 --> 58:57.240
so this is the thing right I and by the way the MacBook Air that I keep salivating about

58:57.240 --> 59:01.480
was only $1,200 so I would argue that like every other you just buy a better one yeah

59:01.480 --> 59:07.720
which and they like god damn it I hate to admit it but dang it it's true the price points

59:07.720 --> 59:12.480
pretty good right it's yeah I have been thinking about selling the X1 Carbon and maybe getting

59:12.480 --> 59:18.880
an XPS 13 but it's 20 the XPS 13 I'd want to be $2,200 right $1,400 and it's a better

59:18.880 --> 59:23.200
performance and multi-day battery life and a platform that's only getting faster and

59:23.200 --> 59:29.040
has a lot of interesting features and excitement and it's hard to justify that $2,200 even

59:29.040 --> 59:34.080
if I could sell the the X1 Carbon for $1,200 well your justification would be like Linux

59:34.080 --> 59:39.800
is a must-have right yeah you can't hot platforms like I do all the time really I guess you

59:39.800 --> 59:45.600
can obviously but you wouldn't make a lot of sense for other reasons yeah but I worry

59:45.600 --> 59:51.380
a little bit because like the reason they limit to 16 gigs of RAM is because the Apple

59:51.380 --> 59:56.080
Silicon cannot handle more than that I hope this isn't like and it seems silly that it

59:56.080 --> 59:59.760
even could be but like some sort of weird technical limitation they haven't been able

59:59.760 --> 01:00:05.800
to overcome because that although I take it back because this machine has never felt slow

01:00:05.800 --> 01:00:11.480
the MacBook Air for me yeah so what do I care if it has 16 gigs of RAM or 24 or 32 right

01:00:11.480 --> 01:00:16.620
right maybe if more things start using virtualization if you know having to use virtualization for

01:00:16.620 --> 01:00:22.340
more tasks because because it is ARM and not x86 maybe that starts to become a thing but

01:00:22.340 --> 01:00:26.920
so far that doesn't seem to be the case huh yeah huh well I'm gonna I I like following

01:00:26.920 --> 01:00:31.840
along I tell you what I don't know if I'm gonna I was the other when I after because

01:00:31.840 --> 01:00:37.160
after the show I kept messing around with that XPS 13 and I loaded more things on there

01:00:37.160 --> 01:00:41.640
and I just like oh my gosh this is I think I like a lot better than the ThinkPad I like

01:00:41.640 --> 01:00:48.440
the ThinkPad keyboard and I like the weight of the ThinkPad X1 better but the XPS 13 that

01:00:48.440 --> 01:00:56.720
11th gen CPU and that screen and that build quality whoof it's just hard to beat that

01:00:56.720 --> 01:01:02.200
even as even at an i5 it's just a great config so I legitimately I've just I hate that I'm

01:01:02.200 --> 01:01:07.200
always in this zone I'm it's like I can never just get the right setup I think for me the

01:01:07.200 --> 01:01:11.520
perfect maybe the perfect world is some sort of remote desktop solution I don't I don't

01:01:11.520 --> 01:01:16.480
know I feel like I'm perpetually spinning between machines but the last thing I probably

01:01:16.480 --> 01:01:21.400
should do is introduce an M1 in there but sometimes it feels a little tempting I mean

01:01:21.400 --> 01:01:26.640
it will be the last machine you introduce I can guarantee that and then the next thing

01:01:26.640 --> 01:01:31.800
you know I'd be putting an M1 at my desk and it's just welcome to the M1 action show and

01:01:31.800 --> 01:01:39.360
I'm on the other I'm using Mac mini colo Marco warmants coming on yes I don't think so no

01:01:39.360 --> 01:01:44.000
I do want to mention we have a new coderly out so if you would like to grab that just

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:49.160
go to coder qa.co and become a member or if you already are a member it's in the RSS feed

01:02:04.400 --> 01:02:09.840
go follow Mike on Twitter he's at Dumanuco his company is at the mad botter Inc I'm at

01:02:09.840 --> 01:02:14.280
Chris last in the podcast network is that Jupiter signal and the show is that coda radio

01:02:14.280 --> 01:02:18.080
show is there anything else you want to mention mr. Donald before we scoot I know everybody

01:02:18.080 --> 01:02:22.600
should get an M1 MacBook Air you get in a cut you gotta work you gotta work that out

01:02:22.600 --> 01:02:29.240
email Tim you know he lowered my App Store Commission ha ha there you go also links to

01:02:29.240 --> 01:02:34.840
some of the stuff we talked about today is a coder dot show slash 396 you also find our

01:02:34.840 --> 01:02:38.520
contact form there which is a big part of our show or you can email us directly coder

01:02:38.520 --> 01:02:44.000
at Jupiter broadcasting comm also you can join our happy hour we do this show Monday

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:48.560
at 5 p.m. Pacific's 8 p.m. Eastern and then kicks off a little bit of that and we have
