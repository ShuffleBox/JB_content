00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
This is KOTORadio, episode 492 for November 14th, 2022.

00:07.000 --> 00:20.500
Hey good buddy, welcome back to Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show. It's taken a pragmatic look

00:20.500 --> 00:26.040
at the art in the business of software development, and you guessed it, the world of technology.

00:26.040 --> 00:30.560
My name is Chris, and joining us, collating the results from his survey, is the spreadsheet

00:30.560 --> 00:32.400
master, Mr. Dominic.

00:32.400 --> 00:35.000
What's up? I'm no Nate Silver, but I'll give it a go.

00:35.000 --> 00:39.080
I think you might have a better shot. They've really been blowing it recently.

00:39.080 --> 00:41.120
A couple rough cycles.

00:41.120 --> 00:44.680
Date's probably been better than the rest for a little while, but you know what I mean.

00:44.680 --> 00:49.840
It's been rough. It's been real rough. And I've been so busy. I've been implementing

00:49.840 --> 00:54.640
the new NSA recommendations. I'm sure you have too. I'm sure you've been making a big

00:54.640 --> 01:02.280
about face and implementing their new recommendations to use only memory-safe programming languages.

01:02.280 --> 01:07.880
The NSA recommends that organizations use memory-safe languages when possible and bolster

01:07.880 --> 01:13.720
protection through code-hardening defenses such as compiler options, tool options, and

01:13.720 --> 01:17.320
operating system configurations.

01:17.320 --> 01:23.280
With tips like this, we're clearly going to become the cyber leaders of the world, with

01:23.280 --> 01:33.320
hot tips like this. How about this one? Configure your operating system. You needed the experts

01:33.320 --> 01:40.600
at the NSA to tell us that. And use your compiler options. Another hot tip from the National

01:40.600 --> 01:45.000
Spy Agency. It's really good. So I hope you've implemented that.

01:45.000 --> 01:51.160
I know you're trolling a bit, but I actually think there are many, many people who read

01:51.160 --> 01:53.440
this article and probably did get some good tips.

01:53.440 --> 01:59.520
Yeah. These are the same people that keep getting surprised and shocked that ransomware

01:59.520 --> 02:03.520
keeps logging up their data and they don't have backups to recover. Yeah. No, I agree.

02:03.520 --> 02:06.200
They're out there. They are absolutely out there.

02:06.200 --> 02:12.400
The register piece goes out of its way to talk about Rust. But I believe when I read

02:12.400 --> 02:17.080
the agency's actual recommendation on the NSA.gov website, because I hang out there

02:17.080 --> 02:24.200
all the time. I don't think they mentioned Rust. They mention other programming languages.

02:24.200 --> 02:28.160
It's funny because of all the languages they list, Rust is actually probably the most hardcore

02:28.160 --> 02:33.600
of the hardcore in terms of you must account for all your memory until you start throwing

02:33.600 --> 02:38.200
around the unsafe keyword and then you can do whatever you want because, hey, hey, hey,

02:38.200 --> 02:39.200
you know.

02:39.200 --> 02:47.200
Here we go. On page three of their memory safe PDF that they put out, software memory

02:47.200 --> 02:53.840
safety PDF that they put out. On page three, paragraph two, they finally do mention Rust

02:53.840 --> 02:59.160
and they give a shout out to Swift as well. So, okay, I stand corrected.

02:59.160 --> 03:03.920
Those noted Apple fanboys at the NSA.

03:03.920 --> 03:09.880
What a weird thing. I mean, it's good. I think the reason why I keyed a little bit is because

03:09.880 --> 03:17.560
I don't know, it feels about 20 years late. When the options are like, use Java or Go

03:17.560 --> 03:23.200
or Rust, it's like, okay, we could have used this a long time ago. It just is, to me, I

03:23.200 --> 03:26.280
think I have this complex of they can never do enough.

03:26.280 --> 03:27.960
Okay, but what makes it late though?

03:27.960 --> 03:32.600
Well, I mean, if this is stuff people should have known ages ago.

03:32.600 --> 03:41.040
Okay, so the counter argument to this, right, and this ties into my still evolving 2FA debacle

03:41.040 --> 03:47.640
that security equals effort plus money. So a reason that lots of things are written in,

03:47.640 --> 03:54.200
let's say Python, is it is a fast language to develop it, right? This is like the whole

03:54.200 --> 04:00.560
raison d'etre for Rails. You know, the biggest risk if you're a small organization is not

04:00.560 --> 04:04.280
that Saudi Arabia is going to hack your stuff. It's that you're just going to run out of

04:04.280 --> 04:10.080
money or go bankrupt or a bigger competitor who may or may not have any employees left

04:10.080 --> 04:15.640
by the time we're done with the show is going to make a free version of what you're doing.

04:15.640 --> 04:22.240
So I don't know. I mean, compiled languages that enforce strict memory safety? Yeah, they're

04:22.240 --> 04:27.840
definitely like, there is a whole category. This is again, this is the Rust promise. There's

04:27.840 --> 04:34.880
a whole category of error, stability errors, but also security errors that are basically

04:34.880 --> 04:40.520
eliminated if you do things the right way in Rust. And that if is very big, because

04:40.520 --> 04:45.280
if it's two in the morning, and you know that you can slam that unsafe keyboard in there

04:45.280 --> 04:48.920
and get this goddamn thing shipped and not have to have the awkward zoom call the next

04:48.920 --> 04:55.960
day, I'm pretty sure that nine out of 10 of us 99 out of eight times would just slam that

04:55.960 --> 05:01.280
unsafe keyword in there. It's if you are the NSA and have infinite money, this is great

05:01.280 --> 05:05.160
advice. And I think in general, looking at your compiler options is something that I

05:05.160 --> 05:10.920
live in, I often don't do. But certainly that I see to me, that's actually the more interesting

05:10.920 --> 05:14.880
piece of advice out of this. Because like, Oh, right, there are tweaks you can do in like

05:14.880 --> 05:20.520
if you're doing iOS and Xcode to, you know, kind of harden up your application, right

05:20.520 --> 05:26.080
your software. Same for you know, you know, LLVM, CPP, all that stuff.

05:26.080 --> 05:29.240
Well, now we can say Rust has been recommended by the NSA.

05:29.240 --> 05:32.640
It's system 76 and the NSA. That's where all the Rust people are.

05:32.640 --> 05:36.200
All right. Well, you mentioned your two factor woes.

05:36.200 --> 05:37.200
God damn it.

05:37.200 --> 05:41.080
We got quite a bit of feedback on that. So I picked a few Christian wanted to recommend

05:41.080 --> 05:45.680
a GPL three two factor tool says greetings. I'm listening to 491. And you're talking about

05:45.680 --> 05:50.280
your two factor woes. One of my biggest fears was losing access to Google Authenticator,

05:50.280 --> 05:55.440
especially when I had a device requiring maintenance and I didn't think about it in advance.

05:55.440 --> 06:02.360
Then I learned about Aegis or A E G I S. It's a GPL three authenticator for Android that

06:02.360 --> 06:07.080
supports multiple devices, multiple backups and exporting your vault. So if you lose your

06:07.080 --> 06:11.960
device and want to enable another one, you can simply import your vault. No cloud required.

06:11.960 --> 06:19.300
It saved me already once or twice. So A E G I S a GPL Android authenticator.

06:19.300 --> 06:25.080
And then another tip that several people emailed in is they print out the QR codes and store

06:25.080 --> 06:30.560
them in a vault or a secured spot. And then they just manually re import them via the

06:30.560 --> 06:37.520
QR code when they when they need to. How is it going over there? Have you been bit by

06:37.520 --> 06:40.560
anything in the time between now and last episode?

06:40.560 --> 06:45.240
So I have been able to restore everything but my Instagram account.

06:45.240 --> 06:53.160
Okay, which is insane because I log into Instagram via Facebook, but they they really just it's

06:53.160 --> 06:59.180
funny how little integration actually happened there. Right, right. I would say that I'm

06:59.180 --> 07:06.300
still of the opinion that all the workarounds that people have sent. It's just too much

07:06.300 --> 07:12.540
for Uncle Tim or Uncle not Tim Cook, but you know, Uncle Ted to actually do. If the reality

07:12.540 --> 07:17.260
for the normies is you break your phone.

07:17.260 --> 07:22.440
And you're therefore you lose all your two FA if you haven't taken some highly like responsible

07:22.440 --> 07:28.600
I'm a man in a brown suit with a fedora hat on steps to prevent that, then this is way

07:28.600 --> 07:35.400
too far on the security versus convenience scale. Now, if you do in fact work as a Rust

07:35.400 --> 07:40.120
developer for the NSA, well, then maybe that's the outcome you want, right? Like, but if

07:40.120 --> 07:44.880
you're, you know, a dude who just wants to get his Instagram account back, and has a

07:44.880 --> 07:50.920
surprisingly small amount of photos of himself on that account, making the override thing

07:50.920 --> 07:56.640
very challenging, and they have no actual support that you can reach out to.

07:56.640 --> 08:05.240
It's a, it's not worth it. And I don't think that two FA as implemented today is the best

08:05.240 --> 08:10.640
solution. Now, I don't know what the right solution is, I would personally envision a

08:10.640 --> 08:16.000
solution maybe integrated into the operating systems that uses biometrics, i.e. face IDs,

08:16.000 --> 08:20.740
and you know, stuff like that. But I see the problem is I can write the objection to each

08:20.740 --> 08:24.040
of these two, right? What's the problem with face ID? Well, if you don't know how to put

08:24.040 --> 08:30.320
your phone on panic mode, anytime somebody possibly wearing blue can grab your phone,

08:30.320 --> 08:35.120
put it towards your face, and now they've unlocked your phone, right forcibly.

08:35.120 --> 08:39.320
This is one of those things where it would be very easy for me to just be like, haha,

08:39.320 --> 08:46.680
I'm a jackass, and I shouldn't have messed this up, which is true-ish. But if we're supposed

08:46.680 --> 08:52.720
to think about normal users, I think the bar is just way too high, right? There needs to

08:52.720 --> 08:57.000
be some override. And yes, that's going to create security holes. Although, you know

08:57.000 --> 09:00.640
what the biggest security hole is, and I kind of say kudos to Instagram for having absolutely

09:00.640 --> 09:04.640
no support, and I know they have no support because they just keep firing people. It's

09:04.640 --> 09:09.760
always like social engineering, right? You can social engineer your way to lots of things.

09:09.760 --> 09:17.680
Who was that, Chris, that YouTuber, the Infosec YouTube lady, who she pretended to be the

09:17.680 --> 09:21.000
wife of somebody who was in Iraq, and she was just trying to get some information on

09:21.000 --> 09:24.920
some account, and then she had a recording, and she played the sound of a baby crying,

09:24.920 --> 09:27.960
and she acted all flustered, and the guy on the phone finds out, okay, ma'am, I'm sorry,

09:27.960 --> 09:30.320
I'll get you off the phone, and just read out the information.

09:30.320 --> 09:34.600
I don't know about that, but that's brilliant. That kind of social engineering works.

09:34.600 --> 09:38.640
This whole situation sucks. We haven't figured this out. You know, Microsoft and them.

09:38.640 --> 09:43.940
To put a fine point on it, you're saying it's too hard for regular people to use two-factor

09:43.940 --> 09:48.880
authentication. It works for a period of time, they get all in, they get all set up on it,

09:48.880 --> 09:51.640
and then at some point they're going to get bit, and they're going to lose access to their

09:51.640 --> 09:52.640
digital stuff.

09:52.640 --> 09:59.680
Right. It expects too much of you up front. It's too unforgiving, right? You know, I tried

09:59.680 --> 10:04.800
to explain it to a relative of mine, who I am encouraging to use some form of two-factor

10:04.800 --> 10:11.840
authentication, and what I ended up telling him was, think about this. If you get married,

10:11.840 --> 10:18.200
and up front you have to hash out every single argument you're ever going to have at the

10:18.200 --> 10:25.520
engagement dinner, and if you ever encounter a disagreement that was not resolved, you

10:25.520 --> 10:30.360
automatically get divorced. That's what losing your two-factor authentication is, right?

10:30.360 --> 10:38.060
You have no way to handle an unforeseen circumstance. Trust me, if you go on Reddit and ask the

10:38.060 --> 10:41.600
InfoSec people, how do I get around this, they're like, you should have been more responsible,

10:41.600 --> 10:42.600
you freaking jackass.

10:42.600 --> 10:45.360
Yeah, that is true. A lot of victim blaming.

10:45.360 --> 10:50.560
Right, which is amazing because these same very people like to, never mind. Yeah.

10:50.560 --> 10:55.400
I completely agree with you, and I think the same problem actually is also true about digital

10:55.400 --> 11:01.500
photography, although not to the degree of severity, but it's a good example of you can

11:01.500 --> 11:07.280
start to make decisions early on about pictures you're taking that you don't take too seriously,

11:07.280 --> 11:11.360
and then a few years down the road, they're some of the most valuable possessions you

11:11.360 --> 11:14.400
own and you've never really given a lot of thought to how you're storing those photos.

11:14.400 --> 11:21.800
I just recently had to go redo all of that. Also, cryptocurrency self-custody is also

11:21.800 --> 11:27.280
very prone to this problem. If you get it wrong, you lose your investment, quote unquote.

11:27.280 --> 11:32.720
Hopefully you're not investing anything stupid, and on both ends, there needs to be a better

11:32.720 --> 11:35.240
technological solution for end users.

11:35.240 --> 11:40.800
I'll give you an example of something that starts to get there. Now, disclaimer, Bitwarden

11:40.800 --> 11:46.840
is a sponsor on Linux Unplugged, but Bitwarden, it doesn't solve the problem completely because

11:46.840 --> 11:51.400
you have to, you still have to present it to people and tell them to start using it,

11:51.400 --> 11:58.560
but when you do their premium, they integrate the password management, the username generation,

11:58.560 --> 12:05.800
the password generation in autofill, and the two-factor code generation for those services

12:05.800 --> 12:06.800
all in one app.

12:06.800 --> 12:11.600
So you can have your secure passwords, you can have your two-factor codes, and it syncs

12:11.600 --> 12:17.360
across your devices, it's locally encrypted. It is what makes it possible for everyday

12:17.360 --> 12:24.600
users to have some kind of access to this, but you have to give them the value proposition,

12:24.600 --> 12:28.240
and you have to tell them about it and tell them to go do it.

12:28.240 --> 12:33.360
Apple and Google and Microsoft are uniquely privileged because they can build this into

12:33.360 --> 12:39.160
the platform, and they have, you know, Apple has a two-factor system built in, Microsoft

12:39.160 --> 12:42.320
does as well, Google, we're all familiar with Google where we have to go launch another

12:42.320 --> 12:45.880
Google app on another device and approve a login.

12:45.880 --> 12:52.040
Because they have access to the platform and they can trigger actions on the local OS,

12:52.040 --> 12:57.360
they can provide a level of two-factor authentication integration that third-party services and

12:57.360 --> 13:01.920
apps just don't get access to. They just don't get access to those APIs, so they cannot create

13:01.920 --> 13:07.360
a user experience sufficient enough. They're limited in what they can do, and the platform

13:07.360 --> 13:13.480
providers meanwhile are doing like OS native dialogues and push services to get that two-factor

13:13.480 --> 13:17.760
in front of you, and it just makes me think ultimately these platform owners are going

13:17.760 --> 13:23.200
to be the ones that we use as all our centralized IDs because of this very problem, because

13:23.200 --> 13:26.120
the normals will not be able to figure out how to do it on their own.

13:26.120 --> 13:33.240
And then, and my last point on this, it perpetuates this problem that is getting worse and worse,

13:33.240 --> 13:38.420
and we're on the right side of it, we benefit, anybody listening to this podcast benefits,

13:38.420 --> 13:43.960
but there is truly a divide now between people who understand a little bit of technology

13:43.960 --> 13:48.800
and people who have no idea. And the people who have no idea are getting preyed on by

13:48.800 --> 13:53.720
all kinds of spyware and monitoring and digital monetization. Their data is getting looked

13:53.720 --> 13:57.920
at, they're getting tracked constantly by their carrier, by their government, by corporation

13:57.920 --> 14:03.200
X, Y, and Z data brokers. They don't know how to store their own currency if they needed

14:03.200 --> 14:09.000
to. They don't know how to do two-factor authentication. They don't know about tools that enable more

14:09.000 --> 14:17.160
privacy and more secure passwords and secure communications. There is this huge, what we

14:17.160 --> 14:21.240
used to call back in the Bill Clinton days, your buddy, that there's this huge digital

14:21.240 --> 14:29.140
divide now. Actual protection of your identity and your pictures, your memories, your services,

14:29.140 --> 14:35.800
your finances, all of that is diminished if you do not understand this technology. And

14:35.800 --> 14:39.920
the people who do understand it are in a better position to have more protection, to have

14:39.920 --> 14:45.080
more advanced investments, to have superior means of communication that can't be monitored

14:45.080 --> 14:50.960
and censored. The difference is really mattering now. And I feel like this two-factor stuff

14:50.960 --> 14:56.960
and all these other digital trends are part of this broader thing that's developing. And

14:56.960 --> 15:00.960
it's like, you're right, we could figure it out. You could learn from this and probably

15:00.960 --> 15:04.520
never make this mistake again and probably go forward with the system that works for

15:04.520 --> 15:11.900
you. But my aunts and uncles and my mom and dad who, you know, are familiar with computers,

15:11.900 --> 15:15.380
I bet they don't use much two-factor authentication at all. And I don't know if I could even recommend

15:15.380 --> 15:21.240
it to them because if they lost their phone, my mom's lost a phone before, they could be

15:21.240 --> 15:25.560
completely SOL and then guess who they're calling and asking what to do and I won't

15:25.560 --> 15:27.800
have an answer for them. It's gone.

15:27.800 --> 15:34.560
Lino.com slash coder. Go there to get $100 in 60-day credit on a new account and it's

15:34.560 --> 15:38.440
a great way to support the show while you're checking out the best way to run applications

15:38.440 --> 15:43.800
for developers in the cloud. It's just the whole package. I mean, you got to be honest,

15:43.800 --> 15:48.000
it starts with the pricing, 30% to 50% cheaper than the options out there that are not as

15:48.000 --> 15:52.040
good. But you also have the support flexibility. However you like to take that support in,

15:52.040 --> 15:58.240
self-research, contacting via phone, email, ticket, they're there 365, seven days a week,

15:58.240 --> 16:02.840
real people that can help you. And then the performance. Like that really I think rounds

16:02.840 --> 16:06.280
it all out. They got 11 data centers today, they're opening up another dozen throughout

16:06.280 --> 16:11.440
next year. They have an application platform where you can just browse a bunch of really

16:11.440 --> 16:17.400
popular useful tools from GitLab to Nextcloud to Minecraft servers. I mean, the list goes

16:17.400 --> 16:22.620
on. They have database as a service as well. If running a database server isn't your strong

16:22.620 --> 16:28.160
suite and you just want to focus on your application, they offer database as a service, multiple

16:28.160 --> 16:33.760
different databases, MongoDB, they have Postgres and MySQL all available as a service. They

16:33.760 --> 16:38.040
have really powerful rigs if you need something with a lot of compute or you need some GPU

16:38.040 --> 16:42.160
for the weekend, they've got systems that can accommodate that. And they've got nanodes,

16:42.160 --> 16:46.000
little itty-bitty systems that could run a single blog or an instance or a photo gallery,

16:46.000 --> 16:49.280
something simple or maybe a demo site for a client. Maybe you want to use one of their

16:49.280 --> 16:53.220
one-click deployments to do a file manager in the cloud so you can exchange files with

16:53.220 --> 16:58.660
friends, family or a client. I mean, there's so many possibilities and so many opportunities

16:58.660 --> 17:04.440
to learn and you can do it on a great platform that has a great company behind it and great

17:04.440 --> 17:08.600
performance while supporting the show and getting a hundred dollars. That is a real

17:08.600 --> 17:13.980
great deal, isn't it? It's kind of like I think the best deal in podcasting. So head

17:13.980 --> 17:20.000
over to linode.com slash coder, grab that $100 and try it out. Linode makes the cloud

17:20.000 --> 17:27.600
simple, affordable and accessible. Linode.com slash coder.

17:27.600 --> 17:33.380
Just a little after we recorded last week,.NET 7 was released. Microsoft says thanks

17:33.380 --> 17:41.280
to the open source.NET community, there have been 28,000 contributions and 8,900 different

17:41.280 --> 17:47.920
contributors throughout the.NET 7 release cycle. And of course with this is the new

17:47.920 --> 17:53.520
general availability of.NET Maui for.NET 7, which they're quite hyped about in the

17:53.520 --> 18:02.760
performance category. And then going along with all of this was this quite nerdy, very

18:02.760 --> 18:09.580
geeky.NET conference keynote and the link to them all. Microsoft just clearly decided

18:09.580 --> 18:15.960
to let the geeks run this in a way, and I don't mean that in a bad way, in a really

18:15.960 --> 18:23.320
good way. I think Microsoft is striking the balance between casual professional and letting

18:23.320 --> 18:29.760
their genuine personalities of their developers show without going to like too low key where

18:29.760 --> 18:34.680
it just feels like a crappy zoom call and without going all the way to a WWDC style

18:34.680 --> 18:38.040
over the top production with crazy hair and transitions.

18:38.040 --> 18:40.720
I don't think Frederiki can help the hair.

18:40.720 --> 18:44.040
I'm sure they spend a few minutes in hair and makeup making it just right for every

18:44.040 --> 18:45.040
scene.

18:45.040 --> 18:47.400
He might consider buttoning his shirt every once in a while.

18:47.400 --> 18:52.320
Yeah, they get them in just the right shirt too, there's that. So I watched a few of these,

18:52.320 --> 18:56.960
like the state of the.NET Maui one, and I mean it's clearly scripted and planned, but

18:56.960 --> 19:03.280
I think it feels the most audience appropriate out of all of the big corporate demonstrations.

19:03.280 --> 19:08.000
It's not Saatchi up there, it's just the people who work on these teams presenting the video

19:08.000 --> 19:12.840
videos. They're being a little geeky. They're clearly having fun. I liked it. I liked all

19:12.840 --> 19:18.560
of it together as a presentation. The.NET 7 release, the keynote of the state of.NET,

19:18.560 --> 19:22.200
then the state of Maui. It was really smooth.

19:22.200 --> 19:28.480
Yeah, I mean it's a pretty good conference. I know we don't talk a ton about.NET on the

19:28.480 --> 19:34.560
show. I will say they are still pushing Maui and I am doing something in Maui right now

19:34.560 --> 19:39.400
for a customer. It is definitely more stable than it was before, so yay.

19:39.400 --> 19:40.400
Yeah.

19:40.400 --> 19:45.400
C-Sharp 11, which is part of this. If you like C-Sharp, which I actually think is pretty

19:45.400 --> 19:52.880
good language, it's a lot of quality of life improvements. I don't know. See, I do wonder,

19:52.880 --> 19:57.840
the ecosystem, how many people are really adopting the new stuff this quickly, right?

19:57.840 --> 20:02.720
I get the impression it's much like the Java world where people stick to a long-term support

20:02.720 --> 20:04.280
version for a while.

20:04.280 --> 20:06.720
Yes, I do too.

20:06.720 --> 20:14.920
Still, it's good, right? C-Sharp is adopting features at a rate that is mind-bending how

20:14.920 --> 20:21.420
large that language is now, but you can do what you need to do. One thing I'm looking

20:21.420 --> 20:30.760
at pretty intensely is Blazor, which is their kind of web view, inject C-Sharp, cross-platform,

20:30.760 --> 20:38.700
from the WebAssembly solution. It's definitely not 100% ready for primetime in terms of Blazor

20:38.700 --> 20:46.000
cross-platform, which is what I'm looking at, but I guess I would suggest that one,

20:46.000 --> 20:51.140
the presentations are really good, like Chris says. Two, I kind of thought last year that

20:51.140 --> 20:57.560
Maui was headed for the scrap heap, and I think they're actually going to pull it off.

20:57.560 --> 21:01.900
They're doing the work of getting things more stable, not having weird things happen in

21:01.900 --> 21:07.260
Android that don't happen on iOS, or vice versa. It's always going to be what it is

21:07.260 --> 21:14.640
a cross-platform solution, and I still personally put a little more stock into web-based UIs,

21:14.640 --> 21:22.840
but if I was a.NET hardcore person, I would probably be blogging about Maui, doing podcasts

21:22.840 --> 21:26.400
about Maui, because it's pretty sexy.

21:26.400 --> 21:33.400
I'd love to be a fly on the wall of the strategic planning when they're discussing what and

21:33.400 --> 21:38.520
how and when they're going to invest in Maui. I wish they were a little more transparent

21:38.520 --> 21:40.000
about that kind of stuff.

21:40.000 --> 21:45.000
I think it's hard, right? We don't have to go through the history of pain that is Windows

21:45.000 --> 21:51.360
Phone and Metro UI and all that stuff again, but Maui is in many ways the dream that they've

21:51.360 --> 21:56.400
had for a long time. That keeps turning into a nightmare. There's a Bruce Springsteen song

21:56.400 --> 21:58.520
about this called The River.

21:58.520 --> 22:05.880
I think this time, it only took them a decade. They might pull it off. Now, I do a little

22:05.880 --> 22:11.800
wonder if Maui is going to be one of those things that doesn't get huge adoption immediately,

22:11.800 --> 22:18.640
because I think the target, I could be wrong, but I think the target for Maui is going to

22:18.640 --> 22:26.680
be your dark matter developers who are in.NET shops, which is like your major corporations.

22:26.680 --> 22:32.800
It is very focused on bringing your Windows development skills to these other platforms.

22:32.800 --> 22:38.840
I don't see your small pseudo-Indie, whatever, mobile development company is really going

22:38.840 --> 22:44.760
to Maui, unless they're already on Xamarin.Forms or something like that.

22:44.760 --> 22:50.800
That's weird. I guess I'm feeling that it could be kind of like.NET as a whole, something

22:50.800 --> 22:56.600
that the podcast world, the hipsters don't really talk about, but turns out to have tremendous

22:56.600 --> 23:00.340
market share and line of business apps that nobody ever sees the light of day for because

23:00.340 --> 23:02.660
line of business. So we'll see.

23:02.660 --> 23:10.600
We need a name for that blind spot. What would you call that? That ability to just completely

23:10.600 --> 23:14.560
miss an entire category? We call it dark matter, but there's a term for the blind spot that

23:14.560 --> 23:18.640
causes the chattering class not to see it. It's interesting. I think you're right. I

23:18.640 --> 23:21.640
think there's a huge use case out there that many people are missing.

23:21.640 --> 23:26.240
Well, it's because you never see it, right? It doesn't go on the App Store. I'm sure if

23:26.240 --> 23:31.760
we went to insert your Fortune 500, there are tablets running Xamarin.Forms and soon

23:31.760 --> 23:33.560
to be Maui, right?

23:33.560 --> 23:37.220
What do you think the most common use, just Maui specifically, would be if this thing

23:37.220 --> 23:42.960
is successful, it gets traction? As an end user, what's my experience going to be with

23:42.960 --> 23:48.440
it? Is it going to be an app that's cross-platform? Is it going to be a point of sales device?

23:48.440 --> 23:52.820
Is it going to be an enterprise application that's on local devices, maybe some cheap

23:52.820 --> 23:54.880
Android devices, some business owns?

23:54.880 --> 24:00.500
All of the above. So I think it's going to be... And in a weird way, this is a self-inflicted

24:00.500 --> 24:07.740
wound from Apple in their effort to make the enterprise certificates harder to abuse. They've

24:07.740 --> 24:14.040
also made it more of a pain in the ass to do your line of business apps, native iOS.

24:14.040 --> 24:19.580
So I'll give you an example, right? I live in an HOA community. The house is owned by

24:19.580 --> 24:23.880
a big company we've talked about before. They sent a guy because apparently there's a mysterious

24:23.880 --> 24:28.640
HOA violation that I don't know about. Guy comes with some cheap Android tablet. He's

24:28.640 --> 24:32.720
got like an app. He's looking, he's like, there's nothing wrong. I said, I know. Good

24:32.720 --> 24:37.040
talk, bro. But in there, he's going through and I can see it. I'm like, okay, yep. So

24:37.040 --> 24:42.500
that's a view controller and it just pushed it. And I know that it's cross-platform because

24:42.500 --> 24:46.840
while it's an Android device, very clearly the transitions, the animations are all the

24:46.840 --> 24:54.200
old iOS push navigation transition. So that app could very well be like a Maui Xamarin

24:54.200 --> 24:59.480
forms type thing. Or it could be like an Angular Ionic thing, like what I usually do. Think

24:59.480 --> 25:04.940
about this. This company is huge. They have to have thousands of these guys just running

25:04.940 --> 25:07.500
around checking on all the properties they own.

25:07.500 --> 25:10.360
And it's a great example of an app they don't need in the App Store. They don't need that

25:10.360 --> 25:11.440
in the Play Store.

25:11.440 --> 25:16.380
I took my car to a Jiffy Loop. Guy right there, I'm sitting in the car as I work on it, rings

25:16.380 --> 25:20.080
me up, not on a point of sale, on a tablet with a little thing hooked to it. And he's

25:20.080 --> 25:23.240
doing the whole thing. He takes a picture of the mileage, takes a picture of the van

25:23.240 --> 25:26.920
that had to replace a part, takes a picture of the old part, the new part. Right there,

25:26.920 --> 25:28.600
bam, one tablet.

25:28.600 --> 25:30.760
You see in restaurants all the time too?

25:30.760 --> 25:31.760
Absolutely, yeah.

25:31.760 --> 25:38.640
Yeah, and all of those are just basically internal corporate applications in most cases.

25:38.640 --> 25:39.640
Sometimes they're a web app or-

25:39.640 --> 25:43.400
That are actually making money, one presumes, right? They're actually productive, so.

25:43.400 --> 25:48.280
You hope. You hope. You hope. But it's good to see.NET 7 land and Microsoft seems to

25:48.280 --> 25:53.920
be going strong. I mean, nearly 9,000 different contributors to.NET 7. That's a legit open

25:53.920 --> 25:57.520
source project. I mean, it's clearly governed by Microsoft, but it's a-

25:57.520 --> 26:01.000
Well, Microsoft is clearly the core of the Linux community.

26:01.000 --> 26:02.000
Right.

26:02.000 --> 26:03.000
Oh, oh, oh.

26:03.000 --> 26:04.000
I don't believe you.

26:04.000 --> 26:05.000
All right. And also-

26:05.000 --> 26:06.000
Inappropriate?

26:06.000 --> 26:15.400
So, we thought this was coming, and unfortunately it did land just a little bit after we published

26:15.400 --> 26:20.720
last week. Meta announced they're laying off more than 11,000 employees.

26:20.720 --> 26:21.720
Damn.

26:21.720 --> 26:25.320
About 13% of their staff.

26:25.320 --> 26:26.920
Woo, Nelly.

26:26.920 --> 26:37.640
And Zuckerberg says he's not ruling out further layoffs. That's a hard pivot. That's a- man.

26:37.640 --> 26:44.500
And then, this morning, as the stream went live for Coda Radio, Amazon announced they

26:44.500 --> 26:48.560
would lay off approximately 10,000 employees this week.

26:48.560 --> 26:51.960
So that's your backyard. You think it's going to affect the local economy?

26:51.960 --> 26:57.320
I don't know, because the Meta one actually had some significant Seattle layoffs as well.

26:57.320 --> 27:03.840
So, you know, combined, that's 20,000, 21,000, 22,000 people that are going to be looking

27:03.840 --> 27:06.960
for tech work. That's going to change things.

27:06.960 --> 27:12.440
Well, and Apple, not to be outdone, but being much more subtle, as Uncle Tim is, are going

27:12.440 --> 27:16.000
to, quote, be very deliberate in their hiring.

27:16.000 --> 27:21.920
Yeah. And again, he says specifically because of economic uncertainty. You know, Amazon

27:21.920 --> 27:27.400
lost a trillion dollars in value since their new chief executive took over.

27:27.400 --> 27:30.680
I don't think that's his fault. It's just the timing.

27:30.680 --> 27:36.240
No, but the pressure is there to signal to investors. This is what I said weeks ago,

27:36.240 --> 27:40.840
is these tech companies, these leadership tech companies, these lead tech companies,

27:40.840 --> 27:45.420
are going to make some of the most dramatic changes the quickest to signal that they recognize

27:45.420 --> 27:49.840
that they need to be all about value. And they're going to set the trend for all a tech.

27:49.840 --> 27:54.200
That's how it always works with these big five. And that's what's happening right now.

27:54.200 --> 27:59.080
It's happening in this last couple of weeks. We're seeing it play out. It's brutal. You

27:59.080 --> 28:02.680
know, there's going to be listeners that are going to be hit by this. And so, I mean, that's

28:02.680 --> 28:05.480
why we've been talking about it, you know, is to prepare people.

28:05.480 --> 28:13.520
Yeah, it's honestly, it's happening much faster than I think I, for one, would have anticipated.

28:13.520 --> 28:18.080
The meta stuff is kind of like Mark Zuckerberg is on some bender called the Metaverse, right?

28:18.080 --> 28:19.440
Horizons, whatever they call it.

28:19.440 --> 28:23.200
Yeah, what's called the Facebook brand has been burned to the ground. And he's got to

28:23.200 --> 28:24.200
build the next thing.

28:24.200 --> 28:29.000
No, I mean, I mean, the fact that he's burnt more money on trying to make the Metaverse

28:29.000 --> 28:34.600
happen. It's kind of insane. I forgot. I don't remember the figure, but it's billions, right?

28:34.600 --> 28:36.520
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Like 20 something.

28:36.520 --> 28:42.920
Yeah, the Amazon thing seems supernatural and like, like very natural in that I think

28:42.920 --> 28:47.400
this Christmas year, we're going to be reading stuff in the journal and Bloomberg about how

28:47.400 --> 28:51.320
holiday spending is dramatically down from, you know, the last couple years.

28:51.320 --> 28:58.120
Yeah, yeah, yeah, right. It's a consumption overall is going to be lessened. Apple, I

28:58.120 --> 29:02.800
think we talked about it a couple weeks ago, has cut productions of their brand new flagship

29:02.800 --> 29:06.320
of iPhones, because nobody's buying them.

29:06.320 --> 29:07.680
Yeah.

29:07.680 --> 29:10.240
Other than people who break their phone, like me.

29:10.240 --> 29:13.200
Yeah, we're idiots like me on the subscription plan.

29:13.200 --> 29:17.960
Right. Well, you're their best friend right now. You're, you're, you're their bestie.

29:17.960 --> 29:24.800
I don't know. I think I'm kind of hoping that this is like a, the dinosaurs take a hit thing.

29:24.800 --> 29:29.680
And we allow the mammals to rise, i.e. people who actually charge for software. Just something

29:29.680 --> 29:35.120
I'm dreaming about. But it's very possible that this is part of just a cyclical decline

29:35.120 --> 29:37.960
and we're all going to suffer together.

29:37.960 --> 29:41.200
I think the ruthless are going to survive. I know that people aren't going to like hearing

29:41.200 --> 29:46.040
this, but this has got to be part of the reason why Elon's going through Twitter like a wrecking

29:46.040 --> 29:47.040
ball.

29:47.040 --> 29:50.840
I still stand with my conspiracy theory. He was super drunk when he said he'd buy it.

29:50.840 --> 29:55.760
He was super drunk when he sent the letter to them buying it. And now he just regrets

29:55.760 --> 29:56.760
it.

29:56.760 --> 30:01.440
Right. And yeah, well, he just spent $44 billion on something that's not worth $44 billion.

30:01.440 --> 30:05.140
And he wants to turn that thing around. And I would imagine if you buy a company like

30:05.140 --> 30:10.160
that, your first 90 days are going to be the most important and you're going to have investors

30:10.160 --> 30:14.560
breathing down your neck. He knows it also is putting Tesla at great risk. So he's got

30:14.560 --> 30:18.780
to move quick and he's moving like a maniac as a result. He's only listening to people

30:18.780 --> 30:23.080
in his peer group. He's not listening to staff. He's only going to listen to other famous

30:23.080 --> 30:27.040
people at this point. And he's just going crazy. Like you just notice it. Like people

30:27.040 --> 30:31.400
say this is a horrible idea and Elon just steamrolls them. And then a celebrity tweets

30:31.400 --> 30:35.440
back at him and says, hey, man, maybe you should rethink this. And he says, OK, all

30:35.440 --> 30:39.600
right, cool. It's not $20. We'll do $8. What do you think of that? You like that that better?

30:39.600 --> 30:43.440
And then that's what they do. They do $8. It's it's wild. You're just watching like

30:43.440 --> 30:48.760
you're watching the man's process go down in public. And it's got a lot of people uncomfortable.

30:48.760 --> 30:54.560
The other thing I realized, too, is a good percentage. Maybe the majority of people are

30:54.560 --> 30:59.000
just really freaked out by chaos in general. So when anybody injects chaos, they immediately

30:59.000 --> 31:05.800
respond badly to it. But to me, it seems like Twitter was horribly broken. It's a dumpster

31:05.800 --> 31:10.560
fire that causes harm. I've been told that many times. And so if Elon were to actually

31:10.560 --> 31:15.000
destroy it, then that would reduce overall net harm in the world.

31:15.000 --> 31:20.040
Chris is like, let it burn, baby. Yeah, let it burn. And if he and perhaps he makes something

31:20.040 --> 31:25.440
out of it. So, OK, so my problem in this is apparently I have no morals. I just look at

31:25.440 --> 31:33.760
the business problem of Twitter was never worth $44 billion in reality. Right. He walked

31:33.760 --> 31:41.880
in arguably 20 to 30 billion in the hole. Right. A paper loss. Yep. How are you going

31:41.880 --> 31:49.400
to make that kind of money when your product is Twitter? I sort of feel like this is like

31:49.400 --> 31:55.840
a Greek tragedy waiting to happen. And I will admit that I am super addicted to Twitter.

31:55.840 --> 32:02.080
I keep trying to to wean myself a little bit. But I'm paying the eight bucks a month because

32:02.080 --> 32:06.660
I know I got some crap for that. Oh, are you? I haven't done that. I am. Well, for the simple

32:06.660 --> 32:11.720
reason again, it's just a business choice. Do you know how much I've paid for ads on

32:11.720 --> 32:17.960
Facebook, Twitter, other places in the past? Sure. Yeah. So even if it does like gets me

32:17.960 --> 32:23.420
one or two meetings to like try to do an Alice sale or something. Eight dollars a month.

32:23.420 --> 32:28.920
This might be the most affordable marketing campaign. In fact, no, this is the most affordable

32:28.920 --> 32:33.200
marketing campaign I've ever tried to run. And if it doesn't work, I just stop paying

32:33.200 --> 32:39.580
it. Right. It's it's really like to me, it's kind of silly not to try, given that you really

32:39.580 --> 32:44.040
can't do anything with digital advertising below a couple thousand dollars that if you

32:44.040 --> 32:48.960
want it to be effective. So the other thing that has worked for me is podcast ads. And

32:48.960 --> 32:54.480
I often will buy them or YouTube or ads because the problem there is you need to usually make

32:54.480 --> 32:59.200
a video which can be quite expensive for a good one. So eight bucks a month, not a lot

32:59.200 --> 33:02.840
of money. Good for me if it works. Actually good for me even if it doesn't because I just

33:02.840 --> 33:08.920
lose eight bucks a month right for a little while. Not going to get you $30 billion though.

33:08.920 --> 33:17.440
That's just not enough money. And I, I, I will say, like, I do not share the doom and

33:17.440 --> 33:23.480
gloom about, you know, like Elon's evil or the political crap. But Twitter has become

33:23.480 --> 33:30.640
like weird recently. And I when I say weird, I mean, like a little more unstable for me.

33:30.640 --> 33:36.640
And I mean, I mean, technically unstable, right? Like slower, whatever. And I don't

33:36.640 --> 33:43.800
know how he plans to, you're not going to make up $20 billion by getting the customers

33:43.800 --> 33:49.040
to pay at this point. The biggest the people who spend drunk money on advertising are the

33:49.040 --> 33:54.800
auto manufacturers who you are their direct competitor. So I doubt they're eager to write

33:54.800 --> 34:05.200
you a check. And you kind of destabilized your core business, which is Tesla. Because

34:05.200 --> 34:11.440
you got mad at who I think is probably one of the best CEOs of our generation agarwal

34:11.440 --> 34:17.160
because he literally did nothing. It is going to make $312 million, which let me tell you,

34:17.160 --> 34:21.400
he is going to get that money. Galloway has a good thing about this about firing people

34:21.400 --> 34:25.880
for cause I have a very similar story. I had a guy send a customer neo Nazi propaganda

34:25.880 --> 34:29.760
because he got mad at him and he got loaded and he did that. I fired the kid for cause

34:29.760 --> 34:34.840
he took me to court I had to pay the New Jersey. Stupid labor court because they're all you

34:34.840 --> 34:40.440
know, geez, let's just say there's not a lot of elephant judges there. They they don't

34:40.440 --> 34:48.160
give a you pay pay the unemployment no matter what. So agarwal there's no like even legitimate

34:48.160 --> 34:54.440
cause depending on where you are and in the Soviet Republic of California, you're paying.

34:54.440 --> 34:58.800
So no offense to California. But it's just something I think you're right though in Texas

34:58.800 --> 35:03.780
he wouldn't have to pay right in Florida never pay right it's just you have to understand

35:03.780 --> 35:10.400
that he's crazy like he he's not done losing money on this. No, no, he's going to keep

35:10.400 --> 35:15.400
going. Yeah, I would probably be a much mentally healthier person if Twitter kind of just like

35:15.400 --> 35:20.360
went away. Clearly one of the worst mistakes in history. He claims he's working 70 hour

35:20.360 --> 35:26.840
to 80 hour work weeks. I don't know. I I think if you if you think about what's motivating

35:26.840 --> 35:32.360
think if you just if you just solve for what's the fastest way to do something and solve

35:32.360 --> 35:36.920
it. And I think when it comes to these technical breakages that people are noticing, I'm not

35:36.920 --> 35:41.520
saying it's the right thing to do, but I think his whole attitude is, oh, let's get and find

35:41.520 --> 35:45.840
out. Let's just find out around and find out. Let's just see what happens. And when it breaks,

35:45.840 --> 35:48.800
it breaks and we'll fix it. Then I'll bring in somebody who knows how to fix it and they'll

35:48.800 --> 35:53.560
solve for it. I saw him on Twitter. I think it was yesterday morning or this morning talking

35:53.560 --> 35:57.560
about, oh, yeah, sorry, that was down. The guy that wrote this just, you know, did a

35:57.560 --> 36:02.120
horrible job. And then, of course, the developer who wrote it chimes in on the thread. Yeah,

36:02.120 --> 36:06.320
I saw that the Android app was like, what are you talking about, idiot? Oh, my God.

36:06.320 --> 36:10.800
It's so embarrassing. But that's to me symptomatic. You know, it's more embarrassing firing someone

36:10.800 --> 36:14.480
and then having to call them back to rehire them because you realize you shouldn't. Yeah,

36:14.480 --> 36:19.840
yeah, he's moving fast, breaking things. And, you know, there's there's a bit of only Elon

36:19.840 --> 36:27.040
Musk could do this because because he's rich and because of the crew around him. You know,

36:27.040 --> 36:31.160
when you're in his presence, there's people around him who are captured by him. You know

36:31.160 --> 36:37.640
what I mean? They are there to work for him and they see things the way he sees things

36:37.640 --> 36:42.200
and they are there to enable him. And so he is surrounded by teams of people who are there

36:42.200 --> 36:48.600
to enable him. He is profoundly rich. So he truly has f**k you money. And he can kind

36:48.600 --> 36:56.040
of get away with stuff. He can kind of become this job in archetypal character, you know,

36:56.040 --> 37:01.960
where he is totally just coming in like a wrecking ball and tearing everything up in

37:01.960 --> 37:05.840
the name of trying to make it work and fix it and make it better. And I think where the

37:05.840 --> 37:12.640
jury is out is he could completely burn and spin out completely wreck Twitter, leave it

37:12.640 --> 37:18.700
a dying husk and then somebody else awful comes around and snatches it up. Or he flushes

37:18.700 --> 37:25.120
out all of the entitled employees who were slowing things down and making the place a

37:25.120 --> 37:29.120
worse place to work. And he comes up with a core product that while it has some technical

37:29.120 --> 37:33.840
issues in about three months, things are turned around and it's looking pretty good. It's

37:33.840 --> 37:34.840
possible.

37:34.840 --> 37:37.440
Is it $30 billion possible?

37:37.440 --> 37:42.720
Honestly, it seems like an easier problem than landing hundreds of rockets on a platform

37:42.720 --> 37:46.780
that's floating in an ocean that has wind and waves. And I mean, it seems like a simpler

37:46.780 --> 37:50.600
problem than what SpaceX is solving. And he managed to put a team together that could

37:50.600 --> 37:55.560
do that. And Starlink too. Like it all seems like actually out of all of his problems,

37:55.560 --> 37:59.560
out of all of his companies, Twitter actually seems like the simplest because it's truly

37:59.560 --> 38:01.120
just a staffing problem.

38:01.120 --> 38:08.480
I will concede that if he pulls this off, this is like, wow, amazing. Elon's right again.

38:08.480 --> 38:11.180
Gee, like never question him again, right? Invest with him every time.

38:11.180 --> 38:16.400
But he'll never, all the people that are railing him now will never change their tune. They'll

38:16.400 --> 38:17.400
never give him credit for it.

38:17.400 --> 38:23.280
This is the problem, to pull this off, right? It's a consumer product effectively. You need

38:23.280 --> 38:26.680
positive press, which I don't know if you've noticed, not happening.

38:26.680 --> 38:27.680
True, true.

38:27.680 --> 38:30.760
The people who work for you, you actually do need good engineers and they need to not

38:30.760 --> 38:35.240
all hate you. So that's, I would say-

38:35.240 --> 38:36.920
Yep, you got to have a team that's bought in.

38:36.920 --> 38:41.960
A plurality of them don't like you. You made a lot of weird promises that while on some

38:41.960 --> 38:48.160
level people could agree with about censorship and stuff like that, are anathema to advertisers

38:48.160 --> 38:54.600
right now. So there's one revenue stream down and they piss off the press, who you absolutely

38:54.600 --> 38:55.600
are going to need.

38:55.600 --> 39:02.200
I'll put it to you this way. If he wasn't Elon, the way Twitter would die is, okay,

39:02.200 --> 39:08.720
let's just say somewhat right-wingy guy, let's just say Mike Dominic buys Twitter, right?

39:08.720 --> 39:14.120
You know how they kill it? They just don't cover it, right? No traction. You just go

39:14.120 --> 39:15.120
away.

39:15.120 --> 39:16.120
It doesn't matter. Yeah.

39:16.120 --> 39:17.120
Right.

39:17.120 --> 39:18.120
They make it irrelevant.

39:18.120 --> 39:23.000
His kind of sort of crazy persona is helping him, but at some point you need to generate

39:23.000 --> 39:31.920
the revenue and SpaceX, thank you Defense Department and US government. Tesla, literally

39:31.920 --> 39:36.960
thanks Obama, right? Lots of subsidies there, a lot of help. People are cheering for you.

39:36.960 --> 39:41.560
You're being hailed as a hero, a climate change warrior. In this case, he's a villain and

39:41.560 --> 39:48.600
those same forces that propelled him are actively rooting for him to fail and causing him, like

39:48.600 --> 39:51.040
they're not just rooting, they're in the game.

39:51.040 --> 39:56.200
Yeah. I'd say they're successful so far. You're right. And the other reason why I think you're

39:56.200 --> 40:01.440
right is if you go back to the premise, this whole thing was a lark. It was a intoxicated

40:01.440 --> 40:06.000
tweet that he backed himself into a corner and then he got in a fight with the CEO and

40:06.000 --> 40:10.080
he had to take it all the way. And now he's stuck with the serious problem and he's just

40:10.080 --> 40:15.560
going to continue to behave erratically. The consequences of failure seem pretty dramatic

40:15.560 --> 40:21.600
since Tesla is the most successful EV company. Starlink could change internet for all kinds

40:21.600 --> 40:26.400
of people like myself. There's like a lot of consequences to him screwing this up and

40:26.400 --> 40:30.160
it is going to be the process, is going to be in front of all of us.

40:30.160 --> 40:32.440
It's literally going to happen on Twitter, right?

40:32.440 --> 40:37.720
It's a fiat world, my friend.

40:37.720 --> 40:43.800
Tailscale.com slash coder. That's where you go to try it for free for up to 20 devices

40:43.800 --> 40:49.880
and support the show. Tailscale is a zero-config VPN. You'll get it up and going in minutes.

40:49.880 --> 40:54.900
It manages your firewall rules. It takes care of your NAT situation. Devices connect directly

40:54.900 --> 41:00.200
to each other in a mesh flat network using WireGuard's noise protocol. It builds you

41:00.200 --> 41:05.480
the best VPN in the biz and it's so smart about how it routes its traffic too. I think

41:05.480 --> 41:08.760
you're going to be blown away by that. Even if your different devices are separated by

41:08.760 --> 41:14.040
firewalls and subnets, TailScale just works. Everything looks like it's on a flat network.

41:14.040 --> 41:18.520
I was really grateful for TailScale recently when we had a power outage. Bunch of devices

41:18.520 --> 41:23.160
came back up that were using dynamic IPs that I'd forgotten about. So I did know the IPs

41:23.160 --> 41:28.160
of a couple of my systems, but their TailScale IP stayed the same.

41:28.160 --> 41:32.040
So I just connected to them over TailScale and then figured out what the IP address was

41:32.040 --> 41:37.060
for the local LAN. And again, like I was saying, TailScale is real smart. It routes that traffic

41:37.060 --> 41:39.700
over the LAN. It doesn't have to go out to the internet through like some sort of old

41:39.700 --> 41:44.980
school tunnel. It figures out where it's supposed to go and it protects that traffic with WireGuard.

41:44.980 --> 41:48.700
Devices connect directly to each other after you sign in through your existing identity

41:48.700 --> 41:52.360
provider. So whatever you're already comfortable with. If you want to enforce multi-factor

41:52.360 --> 41:55.800
authentication there, you can. If you're using it in a work setting and you want to be able

41:55.800 --> 42:01.800
to deauthorize employees, you can. It's so great. And TailScale VPNs are always on, on

42:01.800 --> 42:07.520
every OS I always use, so it's always there. They've got a GUI based ACL editor, great

42:07.520 --> 42:13.960
DNS features, and it's just dead simple to use. I use TailScale every day. You're going

42:13.960 --> 42:20.600
to love it. So go try it for yourself for free up to 20 machines at tailscale.com slash

42:20.600 --> 42:24.320
coder.

42:24.320 --> 42:30.900
So in today's version of Never Trust the Tech Press, whenever they're covering anything,

42:30.900 --> 42:36.720
the collapse of FTX and Sam Bankman fraud is quite the headline right now. It's what

42:36.720 --> 42:40.960
all the other tech stuff is talking about. But there's one angle that I thought the coder

42:40.960 --> 42:44.360
audience should be aware of just so they know how this stuff works in the future so they

42:44.360 --> 42:51.960
can sniff these things out. It turns out, Vox, I know Mr. Dominic's a big fan over there

42:51.960 --> 42:52.960
of Vox.

42:52.960 --> 42:54.520
I like the verse, yeah.

42:54.520 --> 43:04.980
Vox took direct money from SBF to basically write puff pieces about what a great generous

43:04.980 --> 43:13.440
billionaire he was. They wrote a whole spiel on him. They basically wrote propaganda for

43:13.440 --> 43:20.260
the scammer who was stealing from people and embezzling money and investing it and sending

43:20.260 --> 43:26.480
money to politicians. It turns out he was also just paying Vox Media to just write positively

43:26.480 --> 43:31.880
about him, about him personally, and I'm sure about FTX as a result.

43:31.880 --> 43:36.160
And I think you have to understand, I'll put a link to the thread in the show notes. I

43:36.160 --> 43:39.120
think you got to understand how this stuff works. And this thread kind of reveals, it

43:39.120 --> 43:44.480
pulls that curtain back a little bit. And I know this to be true. We got three emails

43:44.480 --> 43:49.560
this week offering to pay us to bring somebody on the show and talk about them like they're

43:49.560 --> 43:55.180
an expert and a pro. Three of them this week, just this week.

43:55.180 --> 44:00.240
So I thought with all of this, if you're interested at all with all this FTX crap going down,

44:00.240 --> 44:04.880
I'll put a link to that in the show notes. You can go read it for yourself. There's just,

44:04.880 --> 44:08.240
I think, a real revealing that happens there. And the whole thing is sickening, I have to

44:08.240 --> 44:12.440
be honest. I guess I'm glad to see him caught.

44:12.440 --> 44:17.400
You know the other crazy thing about that? It was like a house of 10 of them, a 30 million

44:17.400 --> 44:24.000
dollar mansion in the Bahamas. And they were all sleeping together, living in this house,

44:24.000 --> 44:28.040
embezzling money between their companies. It was all out there in front of the press,

44:28.040 --> 44:33.840
all of it. All available, all of their family connections, everything was there. But it

44:33.840 --> 44:40.840
just didn't get reported on. And instead Fortune magazine ran a piece back in September with

44:40.840 --> 44:47.960
SBF on the cover saying that he was the next Warren Buffett. This guy who turns out to

44:47.960 --> 44:54.960
be a total scammer and basically issuing paper money. They had billions and billions and

44:54.960 --> 45:01.600
billions and billions in liabilities and a couple million in actual funds. That was the

45:01.600 --> 45:06.560
peak example of tech and financing just getting absolutely out of control.

45:06.560 --> 45:15.000
So, do you remember the tech press of the early aughts? If you want to go really hardcore,

45:15.000 --> 45:19.600
some of the quote featured stories. This is pretty common, right?

45:19.600 --> 45:22.280
Yeah, it's probably been an issue in tech forever, I would imagine.

45:22.280 --> 45:25.760
For a long time, right? Or how about Apple was really good at doing this, although they

45:25.760 --> 45:30.800
didn't pay people. But like Access Journalism, they only talk to people they like that say

45:30.800 --> 45:36.560
nice things about them, which makes a lot of sense. I mean, Fox did disclose this. I'm

45:36.560 --> 45:44.040
not necessarily here to defend them. I am a fan of their work, especially The Verge.

45:44.040 --> 45:49.560
But I will say that it's... So I don't know anything about SBF. We've talked about it

45:49.560 --> 45:53.680
before. I'm not super into the crypto stuff. The thing that's caught my eye is the lack

45:53.680 --> 46:00.080
of actual like tech reporting going on. And I think we talked about this privately, right?

46:00.080 --> 46:03.480
They've really... And I can only really speak about The Verge because that's the one I follow

46:03.480 --> 46:10.400
the most. They've really leaned into this like, these are media company thing. And it

46:10.400 --> 46:18.600
feels a little weird. Now, I tend to believe, but I could be wrong, that there are interesting

46:18.600 --> 46:23.960
tech companies being founded that nobody hears about and interesting devices being built.

46:23.960 --> 46:29.160
Software applications being built, stuff like that. And they're somehow not getting, in

46:29.160 --> 46:33.760
my eyes, as much oxygen as they used to. I don't know that that might be unfair.

46:33.760 --> 46:35.000
I completely agree though.

46:35.000 --> 46:39.240
Well, I just look at the front page and it's like four Twitter stories, right?

46:39.240 --> 46:40.240
Yeah.

46:40.240 --> 46:46.120
And I get it. Elon Musk says crazy crap and that's easy clickbait and it is a business.

46:46.120 --> 46:55.120
But we've talked about this with events too. I kind of feel the tech press is like... The

46:55.120 --> 47:02.040
press is in capital letters in bold and tech is like small size font, lowercase italics.

47:02.040 --> 47:06.760
I do believe there must be innovation going on somewhere. Maybe it's not here, right?

47:06.760 --> 47:11.480
Maybe there's some kid in Shanghai doing it. Maybe there's some awesome Indian startup

47:11.480 --> 47:18.040
that we should be hearing about or some biotech invention in Oslo. It doesn't necessarily

47:18.040 --> 47:23.440
need to be Silicon Valley, but it's just, I don't know. I know that's not the story

47:23.440 --> 47:24.680
you were going with. I just...

47:24.680 --> 47:29.960
No, I think you're right. You're right. You zoom out and I see exactly what you're seeing.

47:29.960 --> 47:34.120
I trace it back to VC funding. I trace it back to VC funding, networking.

47:34.120 --> 47:37.000
Wouldn't the VCs want their stuff being covered?

47:37.000 --> 47:41.560
Yeah, but it's all a game, right? Certain VC firms have a lot of credibility and a

47:41.560 --> 47:48.160
lot of brand recognition. So if you're backed by one of those, then all of a sudden the

47:48.160 --> 47:52.160
tech press is just more likely to cover you. And when they talk about you, they'll write

47:52.160 --> 47:56.600
that as something that gives your project or your company authority. You've noticed

47:56.600 --> 48:01.520
this, right? It's like these certain luxury brand VC companies, when they invest in you

48:01.520 --> 48:06.600
like Sequoia, who also invested in FTX, when they invest in you, it's a big deal.

48:06.600 --> 48:13.680
So okay. So that Springboard documentary that Vox did, I think it's on YouTube. It's on

48:13.680 --> 48:21.680
YouTube about the Palm OS and kind of that first generation of what we now call smartphone,

48:21.680 --> 48:28.840
what we used to call PDAs basically, that didn't take off. That was like old Vox, right?

48:28.840 --> 48:33.200
Old The Verge. Really good. They talked to the principals. They talked to engineers.

48:33.200 --> 48:40.600
They talked to designers. It was a refreshing blast of the past. I mean, even the new homepage

48:40.600 --> 48:43.000
looks like Twitter, which is interesting.

48:43.000 --> 48:48.840
Well, before we move off, I want to read something. This is from Sequoia's website. They were

48:48.840 --> 48:54.040
so proud of this that they actually had this publicly posted on their website as an example

48:54.040 --> 49:01.120
of how hip they are. This is why they decided to invest in FTX. They write, that's when

49:01.120 --> 49:06.820
SPF told Sequoia about the so-called super app. Quote, I want FTX to be the place where

49:06.820 --> 49:12.600
you can do anything you want with your next dollar. You can buy Bitcoin. You can send

49:12.600 --> 49:17.020
money in whatever currency to any friend, anywhere in the world. You can buy a banana.

49:17.020 --> 49:22.120
You can do anything you want with your money from inside FTX.

49:22.120 --> 49:28.440
And then it goes on to say, suddenly the chat window on Sequoia's side of the Zoom lights

49:28.440 --> 49:35.400
up with partners freaking out. In all caps, I love this founder, typed one partner. I'm

49:35.400 --> 49:42.080
a 10 out of 10, pinged another. Yes, with three exclamation marks, exclaimed a third.

49:42.080 --> 49:47.500
What Sequoia was reacting to was the scale of SPF's vision. It wasn't a story about

49:47.500 --> 49:53.920
how we might use FinTech in the future or crypto or a new kind of bank even. It was

49:53.920 --> 50:00.800
a vision about the future of money itself with a total addressable market of every person

50:00.800 --> 50:04.480
in the entire planet. This is the hubris.

50:04.480 --> 50:08.360
Do you think they actually believe that though? See, I think that's just marketing bull.

50:08.360 --> 50:15.600
Well, then it turns out that it was discovered that during that entire meeting, SPF was also

50:15.600 --> 50:20.560
playing League of Legends and they thought that was so great. Oh my God, he's so brilliant.

50:20.560 --> 50:27.120
He can pitch us, which was a three sentence pitch about basically he wants to turn FTX

50:27.120 --> 50:32.240
into how you spend your next dollar. He can pitch us while playing a video game. He must

50:32.240 --> 50:33.800
be a genius.

50:33.800 --> 50:35.320
I hate myself so much right now.

50:35.320 --> 50:41.040
I know. They write, actually, this is actually what they say. Not only that, Aurora says,

50:41.040 --> 50:45.400
but League of Legends is kind of a multiplayer online battle arena video game and they explain

50:45.400 --> 50:50.240
why it's really hard and you got to do gang killings. She says, I was watching over SPF's

50:50.240 --> 50:56.120
shoulder and he answered that final question from Sequoia like, yeah, and this guy is in

50:56.120 --> 51:01.840
there playing this game. It's amazing. And then they write that he must be a genius.

51:01.840 --> 51:07.840
We have to figure out how to work with him. He has clear purpose and well understood deliverables.

51:07.840 --> 51:14.360
That's a powerful combination they write. All he said was, we want to be able to spend

51:14.360 --> 51:17.600
your next dollar and they were throwing money at this guy.

51:17.600 --> 51:21.640
If it was Dota, would they have been less impressed? I'm just saying.

51:21.640 --> 51:27.160
There you go. So that is the state of VC and finances and tech and this is the kind of

51:27.160 --> 51:28.680
crap that it leads to.

51:28.680 --> 51:33.400
Okay, so the funnier part of the story to me is if you look at this guy, like just take

51:33.400 --> 51:38.680
a look, knowing nothing about the business, he is the young Mark Zuckerberg mold. He literally

51:38.680 --> 51:44.880
is the stereotype. Went to MIT, physically looks like a Zuckerberg clone, right? Different

51:44.880 --> 51:49.400
hair, but you know, same. Like so much for diversity and inclusion, right guys? We would

51:49.400 --> 51:53.160
just want the rich little white kid who went to MIT.

51:53.160 --> 51:57.580
He played this character well, you know, because he'd wear a hoodie or a t-shirt.

51:57.580 --> 51:59.760
My hat's off to him. Good job.

51:59.760 --> 52:05.560
He pretended like he only drove a Toyota Corolla and that was like the point of when he drives

52:05.560 --> 52:10.920
a Corolla. Of course, it turns out he also has like a garage full of very high-end sports

52:10.920 --> 52:12.800
cars. He lives in a $30 million mansion.

52:12.800 --> 52:17.120
Well, that's part of the character, right? You have to pretend like you actually live

52:17.120 --> 52:21.040
to code and only care about the technology and have this great vision.

52:21.040 --> 52:26.680
And his whole thing was something about just being ultimately altruistic. Like their goal

52:26.680 --> 52:31.040
as a company, his company goal for FTX was, is to make as much money as possible so they

52:31.040 --> 52:35.040
could do as much good in the world as possible. And that's why they were paying off Vox and

52:35.040 --> 52:40.680
others to create this bulls**t image about the most generous billionaire in the world.

52:40.680 --> 52:46.360
And it was all fed into this whole hype image. And the idea was to basically make this guy

52:46.360 --> 52:51.640
the face of the crypto industry. There's reports that he was working with the SEC to do that.

52:51.640 --> 52:56.600
And who knows, man? But it's just a very gross situation. And a lot of people got wiped out

52:56.600 --> 52:57.600
as a result.

52:57.600 --> 53:02.080
And they're playing around with their own stupid crappy token, paper money. And they

53:02.080 --> 53:07.920
used their paper money as collateral. And their collateral was based on their customer

53:07.920 --> 53:12.440
deposits. And when their customers did a bank run after their balance sheet was leaked,

53:12.440 --> 53:18.000
their collateral became worth nothing. And so all of their loans got basically margin

53:18.000 --> 53:23.200
called because the collateral wasn't worth enough anymore and FTX just started collapsing.

53:23.200 --> 53:27.560
And then they suspended withdrawals. Then customers couldn't get their funds out. And

53:27.560 --> 53:33.880
then a few days after that, clearly somebody internally had a backdoor. And they drained

53:33.880 --> 53:36.940
$600 million out of customer accounts and stole it.

53:36.940 --> 53:40.720
It's amazing how everything meant to replace the banking system turns out to be like a

53:40.720 --> 53:43.920
really s**tty 1800s version of the banking system.

53:43.920 --> 53:50.160
Well, I think the red flag is anytime they're screwing around with their own currency, their

53:50.160 --> 53:54.000
own token, that's a red flag. That's an immediate no. Don't do it.

53:54.000 --> 53:56.240
Wait, wait, wait, wait. You don't want mad botter token?

53:56.240 --> 53:57.240
Yeah, exactly.

53:57.240 --> 54:00.320
Jar jar coin coming to you.

54:00.320 --> 54:05.560
It's better to wash this stuff out now than when the Fed does start printing money again

54:05.560 --> 54:10.480
and people go risk on and cryptocurrencies start rallying again. Then this guy just would

54:10.480 --> 54:14.760
have been able to cover up all of this. He was trying to raise millions in funding. And

54:14.760 --> 54:17.480
if he would have gotten that millions in funding a week before he collapsed-

54:17.480 --> 54:19.040
Also been lit on fire.

54:19.040 --> 54:21.560
He would have covered all this up. He would have papered it over.

54:21.560 --> 54:23.960
I just want to say you're adorable right now.

54:23.960 --> 54:24.960
Why is that?

54:24.960 --> 54:29.840
You think that by, or you implied that by washing this stuff out now, that the next

54:29.840 --> 54:34.320
time the money printers go burr, these very same VCs aren't just going to do the same

54:34.320 --> 54:36.360
thing. I mean, are you crazy?

54:36.360 --> 54:38.760
Yeah, I suppose they will. Yeah, I guess they would, wouldn't they?

54:38.760 --> 54:44.600
Yeah. I mean, you know, this stuff is just like the new pets.com, right? Nothing's changed.

54:44.600 --> 54:50.560
It is totally, it is, it is the 2008 financial crisis and the dot com bubble in one event

54:50.560 --> 54:55.280
for crypto. I don't know. I think, I think the more I watch all of this, the more at

54:55.280 --> 55:00.160
all, just all this web three stuff is a total scam. It's all a scam.

55:00.160 --> 55:03.520
I don't think it's all a scam. I think the underlying technology for blockchain actually

55:03.520 --> 55:08.560
has some very boring, very boring applications.

55:08.560 --> 55:14.100
I agree. I agree with that. Yeah. But it is not like this universal database replacement

55:14.100 --> 55:18.600
that all of these projects claim to be and their tokens, they're all fake paper money

55:18.600 --> 55:23.340
and the people behind the projects have been issued the token in advance for free. So whenever

55:23.340 --> 55:27.200
the token goes up slightly in value, they, they make a bunch of money and it's all just

55:27.200 --> 55:32.640
a red flag. There's only one true crypto and that is the Bitcoin, my friend.

55:32.640 --> 55:36.200
No, there is one other currency, a boost baby.

55:36.200 --> 55:43.040
Ask not what your podcast can boost for you, but what you can boost for your podcast.

55:43.040 --> 55:50.200
And you tech sent us 250,000 sats this week showing some love for his favorite JB hosts

55:50.200 --> 55:56.680
and show. Mike, you are freaking awesome.

55:56.680 --> 56:02.920
Suck on that stow, which is not around anymore. Those jerks over at Linux unplugged feel embarrassed

56:02.920 --> 56:08.980
now. Thank you and you tech. We appreciate layout. Uh, tack off seven 51 boosted in live

56:08.980 --> 56:14.080
during the show with a 2009 sats. He was trying out a live boost to see if we got it. He's

56:14.080 --> 56:18.180
hacked together a whole system. He's got like Linode in there. He's sending a boost with

56:18.180 --> 56:25.880
web hooks. Uh, he's got a matrix I think to compose it and it landed. So congrats tack.

56:25.880 --> 56:30.600
You built a, you built yourself a system there. I think that's pretty impressive. Strung it

56:30.600 --> 56:34.440
all together and made it work. That's the nice thing about an open network, isn't it?

56:34.440 --> 56:41.840
All right. Elry seven 41 boosted in with a row of ducks, 2,222 sats. So the two factor

56:41.840 --> 56:47.160
stuff hits super close to home for me. A very close loved one of mine, not mentioning who

56:47.160 --> 56:51.240
because I don't think they want to be identified, just went through all of this and even worse,

56:51.240 --> 56:56.960
they couldn't get any cellular connection. So no SMS for the last two weeks. Oh man,

56:56.960 --> 57:02.960
I'm going to send a contact form with more details. He did. And uh, he essentially wrote

57:02.960 --> 57:08.560
a really great blog post on preventing a two factor authentication crisis. But from everything

57:08.560 --> 57:14.840
he learned, uh, from going through his family member and also listening to your journey,

57:14.840 --> 57:20.400
this looks really great. Uh, he really recommends off the two because again of that cloud sync,

57:20.400 --> 57:23.880
which might be the way I would go to if I was going to recommend anything for somebody

57:23.880 --> 57:29.880
who was non-technical, might be offy. If anybody could tell me why that's a bad idea, I'd love

57:29.880 --> 57:34.160
to hear it. Thank you, Ellery. We will link to the preventing two factor authentication

57:34.160 --> 57:38.960
crisis in the show notes for listeners who want to give that a review. I think that's

57:38.960 --> 57:45.180
probably a good idea. Dennis V boosted in with a hundred sats. Finally, I'm back on

57:45.180 --> 57:49.080
track with the show sending my first boost via the fountain app and the ear and sats

57:49.080 --> 57:53.160
while listening. I just want to say I'm using Yuba key for my two factor authentication.

57:53.160 --> 57:58.200
I needed to read, download the Yuba key authenticator and I had to hold my key onto it. I'm currently

57:58.200 --> 58:02.920
driving a harvester in Australia and as a backpacker from Germany and I had plenty of

58:02.920 --> 58:07.440
hours to catch up on all your podcasts. Any recommendations for other podcasts will follow.

58:07.440 --> 58:13.720
Thanks for all the shows. Listen to them while I'm working. Time goes by fast. Hmm. You have

58:13.720 --> 58:19.120
another show recommendation. My other shows are Star Trek shows, so they're very embarrassing.

58:19.120 --> 58:23.240
If you like Star Trek shows, I got a few recommendations. Oh, I think you should just recommend those.

58:23.240 --> 58:29.000
I like business wars depending on who it is. They just did Chipotle and Taco Bell, but

58:29.000 --> 58:35.280
I'm very boring. Mine are mostly business and news and I listen to sections of ATV.

58:35.280 --> 58:41.400
I recommend The Greatest Generation. It's a Star Trek podcast and it's fun. Hey guys,

58:41.400 --> 58:48.200
don't take themselves too seriously. Purple Dog boosted in with 3000 sats. I wonder if

58:48.200 --> 58:53.040
Purple Dog is Alex. He says, I self host all my important stuff because my backups are

58:53.040 --> 58:58.280
in cloud storage and then they're encrypted locally first. The keys are passwords and

58:58.280 --> 59:02.200
the two factor codes are all in Bitwarden. Bitwarden has that two factor authentication

59:02.200 --> 59:08.800
recovery codes and I can store that in my desk with a Yuba key to unlock that. The TOTP

59:08.800 --> 59:14.120
is for my Authy. If my house ever burned down, I lost everything. I decided I'd use Authy

59:14.120 --> 59:17.360
because the backup password is memorized and I actually don't store that in Bitwarden.

59:17.360 --> 59:23.320
So he's kind of got a mix. Like he's got basically his access to Bitwarden is in Authy and then

59:23.320 --> 59:27.280
he has his other two factors inside Bitwarden. So he kind of has like a disaster plan if

59:27.280 --> 59:31.160
his house burns down using that Authy sync, but he doesn't use Authy for everything. That's

59:31.160 --> 59:36.520
a clever idea, dog. Purple Dog continues with another 2000 sats. You know, I actually kind

59:36.520 --> 59:41.000
of like Chris's ad read voice. It makes it much easier to skip. I already use Linode

59:41.000 --> 59:47.600
Talescale in Bitwarden. That is intentional, I will say. If you use it already, then just

59:47.600 --> 59:52.280
let a friend know, you know, spread the word. Send them Mike's way too sometimes. You know,

59:52.280 --> 59:59.160
there's always more places to visit. That's true. I love this next username. Hybrid Sarcasm.

59:59.160 --> 01:00:04.560
Boost in with 1024 sats. Coming in hot with the boost. Here's a tip for memorizing the

01:00:04.560 --> 01:00:10.200
wife's phone number. Change her name or alias title in the contacts app so the phone number

01:00:10.200 --> 01:00:16.200
is what you see always instead of her name or their name. Only took me a few weeks and

01:00:16.200 --> 01:00:21.280
I have that number down pat. Five years later, still in my head. That's actually a pretty

01:00:21.280 --> 01:00:26.320
good idea is to put it in the contact information. That's, I think I'll do that hybrid. I might

01:00:26.320 --> 01:00:30.220
try that. Yeah, that actually that would help. I, you know, I used to have like a whole list

01:00:30.220 --> 01:00:36.440
of phone numbers memorized and then I got a smartphone. Then I got a phone. Yeah. Yeah.

01:00:36.440 --> 01:00:42.560
Big dot boost in with 1701 sats. The enterprise boost. Make it so we recently gave him advice

01:00:42.560 --> 01:00:47.400
to check out TNG and then last week we mentioned perhaps strange new worlds. He says I definitely

01:00:47.400 --> 01:00:51.520
want to watch strange new worlds. I want to watch rings of power first though. I got a

01:00:51.520 --> 01:00:55.960
few friends who like rings of power and I don't want to enrage them too much. Also,

01:00:55.960 --> 01:00:59.720
I don't watch TV series on a regular basis, so I mostly only watch them every few months.

01:00:59.720 --> 01:01:06.200
So what I do is I watch the first season of each show first. Whoa, this is a, whoa, this

01:01:06.200 --> 01:01:10.840
is wild. I, I don't know if that's allowed. That feels weird. So he doesn't just binge

01:01:10.840 --> 01:01:17.960
it. Yeah. Also, I feel like, I feel like I got to give an honorable mention to lower

01:01:17.960 --> 01:01:22.480
decks. It was a solid season. If you like the fun, I hate fun. If you like fun and funny.

01:01:22.480 --> 01:01:29.720
Yeah, it was a good solid season. So if you've got like, you know, 13, 14 year old kid around,

01:01:29.720 --> 01:01:33.640
it's great. It's great for that kind of thing too. And then I'm going to give up, I'm going

01:01:33.640 --> 01:01:39.880
to give a longterm plug once you get all done their peg to the expanse because that will

01:01:39.880 --> 01:01:43.240
make your life better. So I got, I got it. I got it. I got to give that. I got to check

01:01:43.240 --> 01:01:47.840
it out. That's on my list. Yeah. You got to give it at least five episodes too. I like

01:01:47.840 --> 01:01:53.680
we recommend shows, but we're like, and the first half is terrible. Sometimes you're right.

01:01:53.680 --> 01:01:57.280
You know what? You know what? Sometimes that's how it goes. That takes them a little bit

01:01:57.280 --> 01:02:00.040
to get their feet. Like our first hundred episodes, probably not so high. It's like

01:02:00.040 --> 01:02:04.600
going to bed with me. It's all terrible. No, I'm kidding. Actually, I don't want the review.

01:02:04.600 --> 01:02:10.440
No Yelp reviews, please. Okay. Dave Jones, the pod sage boosted in with those big set

01:02:10.440 --> 01:02:18.880
of enterprise sats 17 double Oh one sats. Dave says the fourth season of TNG is pure

01:02:18.880 --> 01:02:25.480
magic. The cast and the writers just gel together to form something truly new and special. Shut

01:02:25.480 --> 01:02:31.280
up Wesley. I agree, Dave. However, I actually think it, it really starts in season three.

01:02:31.280 --> 01:02:36.120
There's spots in season three, like offspring and a few other episodes that are just so

01:02:36.120 --> 01:02:41.120
good. I like the, I like the cringe of season one though. I don't know. And I technically

01:02:41.120 --> 01:02:46.160
say part one of best of both worlds is probably slightly better than part two. And part one

01:02:46.160 --> 01:02:52.080
takes place in season three, Dave Jones. So is that the old one? That's the mirror universe

01:02:52.080 --> 01:02:57.480
one, right? No. Best of both worlds is when Picard gets assimilated. Oh yeah. Who does,

01:02:57.480 --> 01:03:01.760
first of all, wouldn't it be nice to be assimilated? I feel like that would actually solve a lot

01:03:01.760 --> 01:03:06.760
of problems. Not to mention you'd live forever. And no more food bill. No more food bill.

01:03:06.760 --> 01:03:10.720
No more having to think about nothing. No more having to worry. Talk about a uniform.

01:03:10.720 --> 01:03:16.280
You want to talk about a uniform. Chris's uniform becomes part of the Borg high five.

01:03:16.280 --> 01:03:21.160
Problem solved, dude. Problem solved, right? So great. Oh, I love it. All right. Thank

01:03:21.160 --> 01:03:27.840
you everybody who boosted in a Hannegan, a Hannegan, 4,000 sats. Thank you everybody.

01:03:27.840 --> 01:03:32.080
New podcast apps.com. If you'd like to boost in, you go grab one. Sats are cheap right

01:03:32.080 --> 01:03:35.840
now. They're probably going to be cheap for a while, especially if a 2023 ends up being

01:03:35.840 --> 01:03:39.520
a recession. So don't grab a lot, but grab enough to send a boost in. Why not send a

01:03:39.520 --> 01:03:42.480
little extra in since they're cheap right now? We still love them. They still mean something

01:03:42.480 --> 01:03:47.440
to us. Strike if you're in the U S blue wallet, if you're outside the U S cash app is also

01:03:47.440 --> 01:03:51.840
really great. And if you want to challenge RoboSats, if you've got the tour browser,

01:03:51.840 --> 01:03:56.480
our Coder QA members keep us going. They invest in the ongoing production and the Coderly

01:03:56.480 --> 01:04:02.520
is coming together. It has been a wild, wild quarter. Q4 is a hard one and I blame Halloween.

01:04:02.520 --> 01:04:07.040
It threw everything off. I do. Oh, and I want to thank you all for taking the survey I posted

01:04:07.040 --> 01:04:11.320
a couple of weeks ago regarding languages and frameworks you're using that is going

01:04:11.320 --> 01:04:14.560
into the Coderly.

01:04:14.560 --> 01:04:20.280
You can support the show and get an ad free feed at coderqa.co or do it for all the shows,

01:04:20.280 --> 01:04:25.560
get all the shows ad free at Jupiter.party. That's how you do that over there. And then

01:04:25.560 --> 01:04:32.440
of course we're live on Mondays. We do it at a 9 a.m. Pacific noon Eastern over at Jupiter.tube.

01:04:32.440 --> 01:04:35.200
And then we've got the matrix chat room going during the live show, but it's really going

01:04:35.200 --> 01:04:39.280
all week. Mike and I pop in there throughout the week. Details of that coder.show slash

01:04:39.280 --> 01:04:45.760
matrix. You know, we we could have for all these times we mentioned the matrix, we could

01:04:45.760 --> 01:04:50.720
have had like a Keanu Reeves soundbite or a blue pill thing, you know, whatever it is

01:04:50.720 --> 01:04:54.000
this whole time. We've missed out on that. Oh, you don't want to say red pill. I get

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:58.800
it. Oh, oh, is it? I just never remember which one the blue pill is. Well, although blue

01:04:58.800 --> 01:05:02.600
pill, you stay in the matrix, right? Right. Don't you want to be in the matrix? Yeah.

01:05:02.600 --> 01:05:06.800
I mean, right now I'd love to be in the matrix. Let's call it things. I know now about how

01:05:06.800 --> 01:05:12.040
gullible VCs are. Just send me back. Right. I want to do a what is it? Time with that

01:05:12.040 --> 01:05:17.520
time. What's the one with? Let's go back. Oh, my God. Not Steve Buscemi. Are you talking

01:05:17.520 --> 01:05:22.000
to are you talking about back to the quantum leap? Oh, no. I want to do a quantum leap.

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:29.120
I want to go back to like, give me two thousand nine. Just send me back. New York. Two thousand

01:05:29.120 --> 01:05:33.200
nine. I'll be like, listen, guys, we're going to make an app. It's going to say one word

01:05:33.200 --> 01:05:37.760
and that word is yo. You're going to give me five billion dollars. Amazing. You're right.

01:05:37.760 --> 01:05:43.320
And we know for a fact that they would say yes. We should have known with yo. We should

01:05:43.320 --> 01:05:47.920
have. We should have. No, I should have just, you know, fired everybody. I'll Elon started

01:05:47.920 --> 01:05:54.720
a new company, just went all, you know, all in on conning. I mean, acquiring VC investment.

01:05:54.720 --> 01:05:59.200
All right. Do you have any or you want to send people this week? If you've got a time

01:05:59.200 --> 01:06:05.920
mission, can you come to me? No, I don't know. Dominic, I'm dot com. I'm trying to find something

01:06:05.920 --> 01:06:11.520
more fun than Twitter. But for now, at Dumanuco on Twitter. Yeah, that's matrix for me. It's

01:06:11.520 --> 01:06:15.640
my social network. It is matrix. I'm in the matrix all the time. Yeah. At Kota Radio Show

01:06:15.640 --> 01:06:21.440
is the is the show on Twitter. If if you're doing that, you know, otherwise you can just

01:06:21.440 --> 01:06:25.880
go get links and stuff and just go to our website. That's a good idea. Kota dot show.

01:06:25.880 --> 01:06:30.680
This episode would be at Kota dot show slash for 92 links to everything we talked about

01:06:30.680 --> 01:06:35.480
over there, including our RSS feed. So you just get that nice edited version by Drew

01:06:35.480 --> 01:06:39.180
whenever we publish it. Thanks so much for tuning this week's episode of the Kota Radio

01:06:39.180 --> 01:06:56.720
program. And I hope to see you right back here next week.
