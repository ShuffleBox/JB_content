00:00.000 --> 00:15.640
This is KOTOR Radio, episode 470, recorded June 9th, 2022.

00:15.640 --> 00:20.200
Hello friends and welcome into Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show, taking a pragmatic look

00:20.200 --> 00:25.480
at the art and the business of software development and the world of technology.

00:25.480 --> 00:31.240
My name is Chris and joining us in his podcasting position, it's our host, Mr. Dominic.

00:31.240 --> 00:32.240
Hello Mike.

00:32.240 --> 00:33.240
You're here.

00:33.240 --> 00:35.000
Yes, you are.

00:35.000 --> 00:36.000
You are.

00:36.000 --> 00:40.120
And honestly, that's 80% of the battle, my friend, maybe even 85.

00:40.120 --> 00:41.120
You know what I mean?

00:41.120 --> 00:43.280
That's what I'm sticking with right now.

00:43.280 --> 00:49.960
I sometimes overdo it and I'm in denial about overdoing it until my health starts to fail

00:49.960 --> 00:53.040
and then I zoom out and go, oh, I did it again.

00:53.040 --> 00:55.400
You know, I did it again.

00:55.400 --> 00:57.840
Boy, I am so damn busy and I've been thinking about it.

00:57.840 --> 00:58.840
Why is it?

00:58.840 --> 01:04.400
As a podcaster, you know, why is the guy who's doing podcasts, why am I so effing busy and

01:04.400 --> 01:09.840
I just keep getting busier and I have ways of gauging this, like, you know, when like

01:09.840 --> 01:14.440
you got emails in your inbox that are like about sales and closing a sale, but you just

01:14.440 --> 01:17.520
like haven't gotten to it for a week because you just haven't gotten a chance to get to

01:17.520 --> 01:18.520
your email.

01:18.520 --> 01:22.680
It's kind of weeks, weeks, I'm having weeks of that right now.

01:22.680 --> 01:26.560
And it's like, I thought when I restarted the indie thing, I'd take all these things

01:26.560 --> 01:32.240
I learned and I'd avoid this problem all together again, you know, I'll do better this time.

01:32.240 --> 01:33.240
No, it's way worse.

01:33.240 --> 01:34.240
It's way worse.

01:34.240 --> 01:35.240
This time will be different.

01:35.240 --> 01:36.240
No, it's worse.

01:36.240 --> 01:37.240
And you know what I realized?

01:37.240 --> 01:42.720
A, I went from having a big team to a real small team, but B, I repeated a critical mistake

01:42.720 --> 01:45.160
that I made last time, an absolute critical mistake.

01:45.160 --> 01:49.000
And this is a bit of wisdom I want to pass on to people out there thinking about starting

01:49.000 --> 01:53.720
a side hustle or doing their own gig, only do one job.

01:53.720 --> 01:57.440
I didn't realize it, but I gave myself two jobs.

01:57.440 --> 02:03.800
We got a whole slate of shows over at jupiterbroadcasting.com and that running those shows and creating content

02:03.800 --> 02:07.880
and going through and all the follow-up that it requires, all of the work that, you know,

02:07.880 --> 02:11.420
when you have four or five shows, that's more than a full-time job, my friends.

02:11.420 --> 02:16.140
But then the other thing I did because I was the best candidate for it is I'm also the

02:16.140 --> 02:18.240
ad sales guy, right?

02:18.240 --> 02:20.340
I'm the one that communicates with the sponsors.

02:20.340 --> 02:24.720
I go out there and essentially with ad sales, you're always selling because you're always,

02:24.720 --> 02:27.400
these deals take sometimes six months to line up.

02:27.400 --> 02:30.860
You're always following up your every, you know, every opportunity you get, you're jumping

02:30.860 --> 02:33.000
onto a video call or doing a meeting.

02:33.000 --> 02:36.660
You're always replying to questions or modifications.

02:36.660 --> 02:38.260
It's a full-time job itself.

02:38.260 --> 02:42.880
And both of them never end, right?

02:42.880 --> 02:46.080
There's always a show within a couple of hours that within a few hours that needs to start,

02:46.080 --> 02:47.660
I need to start working on.

02:47.660 --> 02:50.380
I always have to be working on the sponsor stuff, always.

02:50.380 --> 02:54.500
Because if you stop, then like three, four, five months down the road, all revenue stops

02:54.500 --> 02:55.500
coming in.

02:55.500 --> 02:57.300
It's like, it's bad, right?

02:57.300 --> 03:02.260
And so, I think it's a super common mistake in new media that a lot of people that start

03:02.260 --> 03:05.060
their own new media company think it's a really common mistake.

03:05.060 --> 03:08.380
And then I think what happens is most of them burn out.

03:08.380 --> 03:10.520
Like they don't make it 15 years, right?

03:10.520 --> 03:13.940
They make it five, 10 years at most, and then they burn out.

03:13.940 --> 03:18.580
But I just keep going because I'm in denial about it until I like look around and see

03:18.580 --> 03:22.380
like all the rubble around me of things that I have failed to do or forgotten about or

03:22.380 --> 03:23.380
didn't get to.

03:23.380 --> 03:25.100
And I'm like, oh, I've done it again.

03:25.100 --> 03:28.420
And then I start realizing, oh, my health's kind of, I'm kind of falling apart.

03:28.420 --> 03:29.420
What's going on?

03:29.420 --> 03:31.820
Oh, I'm such an idiot.

03:31.820 --> 03:37.340
And I can't believe I find myself here like almost once a quarter at this rate.

03:37.340 --> 03:42.000
It's so frustrating because I'm just so helpless apparently.

03:42.000 --> 03:43.420
Do you just, you know what I'm looking?

03:43.420 --> 03:46.500
I'm looking just to just tell me you struggle like this, too.

03:46.500 --> 03:47.500
I just need to know.

03:47.500 --> 03:48.500
I need to know.

03:48.500 --> 03:49.500
It's not just me.

03:49.500 --> 03:54.220
Between, you know, IT infrastructure, dev, sales, I mean, I don't I don't know how you

03:54.220 --> 03:56.300
avoid not having two or three hats, though.

03:56.300 --> 03:57.300
Right.

03:57.300 --> 03:58.300
Because there's the whole infrastructure side of things, too.

03:58.300 --> 04:00.300
Thank God I get help from Wes on that.

04:00.300 --> 04:03.140
And Alex, you know, Alex has been really helpful there, too.

04:03.140 --> 04:04.260
Those guys are great.

04:04.260 --> 04:05.900
But yeah, there's a lot there.

04:05.900 --> 04:11.260
So just my bit of wisdom that I am my lesson I have learned from this is when you're creating

04:11.260 --> 04:17.500
a job for yourself, try to give yourself just one job and then try to delegate all that

04:17.500 --> 04:18.500
stuff you can.

04:18.500 --> 04:20.460
It's really hard depending on the niche you're in.

04:20.460 --> 04:22.580
Sometimes there isn't the revenue to delegate.

04:22.580 --> 04:24.100
That's always the number one feedback that always comes in.

04:24.100 --> 04:26.580
Oh, Chris, you just need to learn to delegate.

04:26.580 --> 04:27.580
All right.

04:27.580 --> 04:33.660
Well, send that with a with a hundred thousand dollar boost and I'll hire somebody not delegate

04:33.660 --> 04:35.460
in the meantime.

04:35.460 --> 04:37.180
I'm going to have to figure it out on my own.

04:37.180 --> 04:42.180
Well, we got we got a bunch of feedback, people who are working in remote virtual desktops,

04:42.180 --> 04:45.180
something you and I brought up recently on the show.

04:45.180 --> 04:47.300
And I wanted to get to some of this.

04:47.300 --> 04:48.300
Alex Gates wrote in.

04:48.300 --> 04:54.140
He said, my last gig, we configured a medium sized Azure virtual desktop environment and

04:54.140 --> 04:56.260
it was really good.

04:56.260 --> 04:58.540
Anyone that got it pretty much ditched their laptops.

04:58.540 --> 05:03.340
This is primarily because limitations for budgets on new hardware, of course.

05:03.340 --> 05:07.740
Big, crappy company laptops over a powerful remote system.

05:07.740 --> 05:08.860
That makes sense.

05:08.860 --> 05:14.480
The virtual desktops are all RDP based, like I imagine most dev boxes would be.

05:14.480 --> 05:17.740
They did end up having a lot of engineers using the environment with 3D accelerated

05:17.740 --> 05:20.280
CAD setups even.

05:20.280 --> 05:24.620
In a gig like that, I take a virtual remote desktop over a local one any day of the week,

05:24.620 --> 05:28.380
assuming it was on an RDP based system.

05:28.380 --> 05:33.140
And that actually seems to be surprisingly the maker or breaker is what is the what is

05:33.140 --> 05:35.100
the remote connection protocol being used?

05:35.100 --> 05:38.400
Citrix and RDP seem to be the favorite of the audience, and then it kind of goes downhill

05:38.400 --> 05:39.500
from there.

05:39.500 --> 05:43.820
And that just can make all the difference with the latency of the connection.

05:43.820 --> 05:45.740
Kind of on the same line.

05:45.740 --> 05:51.740
Patias shared the joys and the sorrows of running their dev environment on the Google

05:51.740 --> 05:52.740
cloud infrastructure.

05:52.740 --> 05:59.220
They write, I'm a dev ops person for a web hosting company here, and I got some sorrows

05:59.220 --> 06:02.860
and some joys of remote VMs, the joys.

06:02.860 --> 06:06.540
I have easy access to support developers and see what they are seeing in real time and

06:06.540 --> 06:10.780
deploy the same automation on the same OS as our staging and prod environments.

06:10.780 --> 06:12.060
All right.

06:12.060 --> 06:13.140
I've done remote support.

06:13.140 --> 06:15.860
I acknowledge remote supports way better there.

06:15.860 --> 06:17.140
And the staging stuff.

06:17.140 --> 06:21.700
This again, I think, is an area that comes up where people want something they can easily

06:21.700 --> 06:24.340
stage, easily deploy to all the developers.

06:24.340 --> 06:26.340
The biggest issue is resource consumption.

06:26.340 --> 06:32.700
VSCode has a bunch of useful extensions like Live Share and IntelliSense and our devs love

06:32.700 --> 06:33.700
it.

06:33.700 --> 06:37.980
But sometimes it can use one gig of RAM for each remote session.

06:37.980 --> 06:41.600
So resource consumption issues can also run us out of memory.

06:41.600 --> 06:43.340
That can be a problem, though.

06:43.340 --> 06:47.780
This seems like a common issue with any sort of virtual desktop environment, at least ones

06:47.780 --> 06:48.780
that I've run into.

06:48.780 --> 06:51.700
We're planning on moving back to local dev environment based on Docker, but that will

06:51.700 --> 06:55.060
also mean another platform that needs to be maintained since we need to replicate any

06:55.060 --> 06:58.260
changes from our current VM and Ansible based setup in Docker.

06:58.260 --> 06:59.740
There you go.

06:59.740 --> 07:03.900
I mean, that was really, I think, the highlights of it.

07:03.900 --> 07:06.240
We got a note too from Summer Evans.

07:06.240 --> 07:07.580
They love the remote setup.

07:07.580 --> 07:13.560
They say, when the pandemic started, I was working as a.NET developer at a Windows desktop.

07:13.560 --> 07:15.940
We weren't allowed to bring home our desktop computers.

07:15.940 --> 07:18.900
So I ended up remoting into my desktop.

07:18.900 --> 07:20.380
It was horrible at first because of bad internet.

07:20.380 --> 07:24.260
But now that that's been fixed, I work at a company where I work on open source now.

07:24.260 --> 07:27.860
And I have a VPS set up on my own with TMUX and a remote in there for most of my daily

07:27.860 --> 07:28.860
work.

07:28.860 --> 07:29.860
I like it a lot.

07:29.860 --> 07:32.780
I can switch between computers quickly and resume my work at TMUX is way more lightweight

07:32.780 --> 07:33.780
than anything graphical.

07:33.780 --> 07:34.780
I see.

07:34.780 --> 07:38.020
I wonder how that holds up if the internet connection is crappy.

07:38.020 --> 07:41.180
That's definitely where it goes sideways, huh?

07:41.180 --> 07:42.180
Yeah.

07:42.180 --> 07:45.980
So that's getting better, especially, you know, a lot of home connections are wired.

07:45.980 --> 07:46.980
I don't know.

07:46.980 --> 07:47.980
Right.

07:47.980 --> 07:48.980
I mean, have you ever heard of Comcast?

07:48.980 --> 07:49.980
Oh, yeah.

07:49.980 --> 07:51.540
No, I mean, we know.

07:51.540 --> 07:53.580
We know just doing this show for years.

07:53.580 --> 07:58.180
There's some days where things are just bad and there's nothing you can do about it.

07:58.180 --> 08:01.560
Squirrely Dave wrote in to say that he works in Citrix when remote.

08:01.560 --> 08:06.540
And then when he goes into the office, they issue him a Chromebook, which he says, I mean,

08:06.540 --> 08:10.940
that's fine because, quote, I don't actually get any work done in the office.

08:10.940 --> 08:12.340
I mean, but I like it.

08:12.340 --> 08:13.340
It was a jab at you.

08:13.340 --> 08:14.340
It totally was.

08:14.340 --> 08:15.780
It was right on the chin.

08:15.780 --> 08:16.780
Right.

08:16.780 --> 08:17.780
Yeah.

08:17.780 --> 08:19.900
We got more feedback and we'd love to collect some more.

08:19.900 --> 08:22.300
We're recording another episode on Monday in our regular time.

08:22.300 --> 08:28.260
We're doing a special recording right now, a special.

08:28.260 --> 08:29.260
That's right.

08:29.260 --> 08:33.160
Coder on a Thursday because we're getting ready for some travel.

08:33.160 --> 08:35.940
So some extra feedback would be great.

08:35.940 --> 08:41.060
Go over to Coder dot show slash contact or grab a new podcasting app and send us in a

08:41.060 --> 08:42.060
boost.

08:42.060 --> 08:46.600
A quick mention about the London meetup coming up in August.

08:46.600 --> 08:48.140
There's been a day change.

08:48.140 --> 08:52.060
So be sure you're going to meet up dot com slash Jupiter Broadcasting and you've joined

08:52.060 --> 08:53.060
the meetups.

08:53.060 --> 08:55.800
That way, you know all the deets because there are some flight changes.

08:55.800 --> 08:57.380
So there's a slight day change.

08:57.380 --> 09:01.660
Everything's over at meetup dot com slash Jupiter Broadcasting because, yes, Alex from

09:01.660 --> 09:07.300
self-hosted will be in London in August and there is a meetup getting organized.

09:07.300 --> 09:08.300
Mike and I won't be there.

09:08.300 --> 09:10.260
Well, at least not this time.

09:10.260 --> 09:17.380
But when we land that big Ford EV sponsorship and we got, you know, big Ford money, maybe

09:17.380 --> 09:18.380
we'll go do a show in London.

09:18.380 --> 09:19.780
I got that big Ford energy.

09:19.780 --> 09:20.780
I like it.

09:20.780 --> 09:24.060
I like it.

09:24.060 --> 09:29.700
Tail scale dot com slash code or go there to get a free account up to 20 devices.

09:29.700 --> 09:32.020
I love tail scale.

09:32.020 --> 09:37.980
It is a zero config VPN installs on any device in minutes and not a week goes by where I

09:37.980 --> 09:42.260
don't see multiple community members lives change because of tail scale.

09:42.260 --> 09:46.060
Not exaggerating happened this morning before I sat down to record.

09:46.060 --> 09:47.980
Maybe that's why I'm super hyped right now.

09:47.980 --> 09:52.120
A great conversation our telegram group about a user who was transitioning from a really

09:52.120 --> 09:58.740
kind of brittle open VPN setup to tail scale and then using ACLs and exit nodes to really

09:58.740 --> 10:00.780
complete the picture for them.

10:00.780 --> 10:01.780
It's so great.

10:01.780 --> 10:06.060
You see, devices connect directly to each other using WireGuard's noise protocol encryption.

10:06.060 --> 10:09.600
You build a mesh VPN network powered by WireGuard.

10:09.600 --> 10:13.820
You can quickly create secure ACLs to to share one machine with somebody.

10:13.820 --> 10:15.340
It'll bust through carrier grade net.

10:15.340 --> 10:17.500
I can attest to that.

10:17.500 --> 10:22.260
I have been in like I'm not even kidding, like triple net deep and tail scale still

10:22.260 --> 10:23.300
works.

10:23.300 --> 10:26.340
That's how I keep all my family's computers connected so I can do remote support when

10:26.340 --> 10:28.300
my kids aren't at home with me.

10:28.300 --> 10:31.620
It's super handy for getting into my work systems, prepping for a show when I'm on the

10:31.620 --> 10:34.180
road and you'll get it running on just about any.

10:34.180 --> 10:35.180
I've got it on Raspberry Pi.

10:35.180 --> 10:36.180
I got it on my iPhone.

10:36.180 --> 10:37.180
I got it on an iPad.

10:37.180 --> 10:38.620
I got it on my Linux boxes.

10:38.620 --> 10:40.980
It's part of my basic NixOS configuration.

10:40.980 --> 10:44.820
Now when I deploy a NixOS box, it deploys with tail scale.

10:44.820 --> 10:45.820
Seriously.

10:45.820 --> 10:53.000
So go try it for yourself for free up to 20 machines at tailscale.com slash coder.

10:53.000 --> 10:56.060
This is the modern way to do VPNs.

10:56.060 --> 11:00.180
Every other VPN I've ever used feels so old after I've switched to tail scale.

11:00.180 --> 11:06.700
Go try it for yourself, tailscale.com slash coder.

11:06.700 --> 11:12.980
Well I got my HP dev one since we gathered together last time and I know you've been

11:12.980 --> 11:17.720
going all in using it as your daily driver since we last chatted.

11:17.720 --> 11:19.940
I think this is worth talking about more.

11:19.940 --> 11:25.100
In fact, I think this is going to be a big topic of conversation in the Linux community

11:25.100 --> 11:26.420
over the next few weeks.

11:26.420 --> 11:29.620
Yeah, I think so too.

11:29.620 --> 11:30.620
You go first.

11:30.620 --> 11:33.700
I've been waiting for your feedback and you have been quite the tease.

11:33.700 --> 11:35.580
I have been saving it for the show.

11:35.580 --> 11:36.580
You coquettish bastard.

11:36.580 --> 11:37.580
Sorry.

11:37.580 --> 11:43.300
I just wanted to kind of get your live reactions out there.

11:43.300 --> 11:44.300
Capture it raw.

11:44.300 --> 11:52.900
I feel like this is potentially a laptop that is going to fill a very critical space in

11:52.900 --> 11:54.760
the Linux ecosystem.

11:54.760 --> 11:59.580
So traditionally, I can tell you that we have been lacking just something very simple.

11:59.580 --> 12:04.580
When somebody comes and says, hey, I'd like a great laptop to run Linux, what do you recommend?

12:04.580 --> 12:07.820
You have to need a chart of are they a ThinkPad person potentially?

12:07.820 --> 12:09.380
Are they going to be an XPS person?

12:09.380 --> 12:12.060
Should we be sending them to system 76?

12:12.060 --> 12:15.760
There's all of these potential avenues you could go down and you have to ask them all

12:15.760 --> 12:16.760
of these questions.

12:16.760 --> 12:21.780
And there's not just a go to this website and order this configuration.

12:21.780 --> 12:24.500
And that is exactly how it is on the MacBook world.

12:24.500 --> 12:29.300
Pretty much anybody could go buy a MacBook Air M2 now, whatever model they want, even

12:29.300 --> 12:33.660
the base model, and it's going to be good enough for 90 percent of people out there.

12:33.660 --> 12:35.540
We haven't had that in Linux.

12:35.540 --> 12:37.460
We've had all of these variables.

12:37.460 --> 12:42.300
And so I have felt for a long time that Dell was so close to cinching that if Dell just

12:42.300 --> 12:49.140
made it a little bit more discoverable, a little simpler, a little less of a Dell experience

12:49.140 --> 12:55.060
to get the XPS, and if they just kind of leaned into it a bit more instead of kind of fade

12:55.060 --> 13:03.020
like they seem to be, the XPS could have really kind of grabbed that Linux king crown of laptops.

13:03.020 --> 13:07.540
In fact, today as we record a brand new XPS 13 has just been announced, not the Linux

13:07.540 --> 13:12.420
edition, but a new XPS 13 that Linux edition will probably be based on at some point in

13:12.420 --> 13:13.420
the future.

13:13.420 --> 13:17.540
That's been announced and it's more in a direction I'm not a huge fan of.

13:17.540 --> 13:21.540
I mean, it has a new Intel processor in there, it has a smaller motherboard, it has better

13:21.540 --> 13:22.540
battery life.

13:22.540 --> 13:28.980
Those things are good, but it has one USB-C port on each side, two USB-C ports total.

13:28.980 --> 13:32.460
It has a butterfly style chiclet keyboard, right?

13:32.460 --> 13:39.620
It's going the wrong direction in other areas and it's also based around an Intel platform,

13:39.620 --> 13:43.700
which for some of us there's just less enthusiasm about these days.

13:43.700 --> 13:48.720
So it just kind of wasn't quite getting that king status.

13:48.720 --> 13:52.460
And you'd really like it to be a piece of hardware that comes from a tier one OEM vendor

13:52.460 --> 13:57.860
that can ship, that has scale, that has deep supply chain connections, that kind of stuff,

13:57.860 --> 14:00.020
especially these days.

14:00.020 --> 14:06.900
And the HP Dev 1, I think is the best candidate for the king of Linux laptops crown that we

14:06.900 --> 14:09.740
have seen in a long time.

14:09.740 --> 14:12.500
And it just took them getting the formula right.

14:12.500 --> 14:15.980
You can tell where they decided to take risks and you can tell where they decided not to

14:15.980 --> 14:17.100
take risks.

14:17.100 --> 14:21.980
And the risk that they decided to take here was to make a Linux focused laptop.

14:21.980 --> 14:26.140
And then they didn't take a lot of risks with the hardware design.

14:26.140 --> 14:30.020
It's not really anything exceptional, but it's also not below anything you'd expect.

14:30.020 --> 14:33.100
It kind of just got it right there in the middle with the hardware design.

14:33.100 --> 14:34.100
Do you agree with that?

14:34.100 --> 14:36.580
Yeah, I think it's good.

14:36.580 --> 14:40.980
It's definitely, if you're looking for like a wafer thin MacBook Air, this is probably

14:40.980 --> 14:46.180
not for you, but if you're looking for a more practical is the word that comes to mind.

14:46.180 --> 14:48.780
With a slightly better design look than say like a ThinkPad, right?

14:48.780 --> 14:53.100
It's got that magnesium alloy chassis, which at first I thought might be plastic.

14:53.100 --> 14:54.580
I couldn't tell because it was so light.

14:54.580 --> 14:56.380
I actually thought it was plastic.

14:56.380 --> 15:00.660
So then it really kind of came down to how does it work for me?

15:00.660 --> 15:04.820
And I'm still planning to throw like a bunch of synthetic benchmarks at it and a lot of

15:04.820 --> 15:06.540
scenarios which I haven't done yet.

15:06.540 --> 15:11.140
And I haven't still gotten a good grasp of its battery life capacity.

15:11.140 --> 15:18.340
But I do feel like I have a very good grasp on how it works for my kind of maximum workload

15:18.340 --> 15:19.340
scenario.

15:19.340 --> 15:24.940
It's like when I sit down and I set up a laptop for the first time after I've reloaded it,

15:24.940 --> 15:30.580
I will have Steam downloading and installing a game in the background while I have apt

15:30.580 --> 15:38.180
or whatever DNF whatever installing packages while I also have flat pack installing like

15:38.180 --> 15:43.380
30 packages and I will have all of this going while I'm also browsing the web, probably

15:43.380 --> 15:44.580
watching some YouTube.

15:44.580 --> 15:46.260
I have a matrix chat open.

15:46.260 --> 15:47.260
Absolutely.

15:47.260 --> 15:48.260
I have telegram open.

15:48.260 --> 15:49.260
Absolutely.

15:49.260 --> 15:50.620
Probably have slack open as well.

15:50.620 --> 15:55.020
I probably three or four desktops virtual desktops deep while I'm doing this or I'm

15:55.020 --> 15:56.020
doing all that.

15:56.020 --> 16:03.220
If I'm not downloading a Steam game, I'm precaching the shaders for like, you know, the performance.

16:03.220 --> 16:04.220
That's generally how I work.

16:04.220 --> 16:07.580
It's a very ADD style where I have a lot of things going on at once.

16:07.580 --> 16:12.140
And so if I can install a flat pack and a dead package at the same time, I will.

16:12.140 --> 16:17.740
And why not during all of that, which I was doing for a solid three, four hours, the fans

16:17.740 --> 16:22.780
never kicked up that typically almost that just never happens on a Linux laptop.

16:22.780 --> 16:28.940
Even during the precaching of the shaders for my games, the fans did not kick up.

16:28.940 --> 16:30.780
The performance never lagged.

16:30.780 --> 16:33.020
It never it never missed a beat.

16:33.020 --> 16:34.060
I was very impressed.

16:34.060 --> 16:40.020
The only time I heard the fans actually go on was when the game finally started.

16:40.020 --> 16:45.140
Even then, the speakers are so damn good that it was absolutely no issue.

16:45.140 --> 16:49.580
And even with the fans going, it's still quieter than every other laptop I have once the fans

16:49.580 --> 16:56.420
kick up that maybe maybe aside from the MacBook when when I had that experience.

16:56.420 --> 17:01.100
I started getting a little more serious about the laptop because I was like, OK, I just

17:01.100 --> 17:06.420
threw a lot at this and then it loaded my frickin video game.

17:06.420 --> 17:09.420
And then I played my video game on this thing.

17:09.420 --> 17:12.500
That's a big deal, because if I've got a thousand bucks to spend, if I've got twelve hundred

17:12.500 --> 17:15.840
bucks to spend, I game very rarely.

17:15.840 --> 17:18.440
But when I do game, I want to be able to do that.

17:18.440 --> 17:20.240
And that's getting better and better on Linux than ever.

17:20.240 --> 17:26.380
In fact, it's an area where the Linux desktop is significantly more competitive than the

17:26.380 --> 17:27.680
Mac desktop.

17:27.680 --> 17:32.820
And so that's an area where if I'm going to have a Linux box, I want to be able to play

17:32.820 --> 17:34.340
video games.

17:34.340 --> 17:37.660
But on my ThinkPad, where it's all an Intel configuration, the Intel graphics are just

17:37.660 --> 17:38.840
not powerful enough.

17:38.840 --> 17:43.540
And on other systems where I have a Intel and Nvidia, it's a real pain in the neck to

17:43.540 --> 17:44.540
manage that.

17:44.540 --> 17:48.900
And it makes it harder to flip between distributions like a maniac.

17:48.900 --> 17:55.220
This it strikes that balance because that built in integrated AMD GPU is good enough

17:55.220 --> 18:02.260
that I was playing Halo last night on it and it was totally playable.

18:02.260 --> 18:03.300
How new for you, though?

18:03.300 --> 18:04.300
Let's get to the heart of them.

18:04.300 --> 18:07.240
Oh, I haven't played Halo since like the early Xbox days, man.

18:07.240 --> 18:08.620
So it was rough.

18:08.620 --> 18:10.300
Yeah, I tried.

18:10.300 --> 18:12.020
I tried some infinity myself.

18:12.020 --> 18:14.780
It wasn't a good idea.

18:14.780 --> 18:20.420
The other game that I threw at it, which is always very complex, and it sort of it murders

18:20.420 --> 18:26.380
every other system I have, unfortunately, for whatever reason, is Star Trek Online.

18:26.380 --> 18:29.540
It's not even that new of a game, but maybe it's just not super optimized.

18:29.540 --> 18:32.380
Star Trek Online, say you.

18:32.380 --> 18:33.380
Mm hmm.

18:33.380 --> 18:34.940
So like a 10 year old MMO.

18:34.940 --> 18:38.860
Okay, I was thinking, what was I thinking, Stowe?

18:38.860 --> 18:39.860
Yeah, it's Stowe.

18:39.860 --> 18:40.860
Yeah.

18:40.860 --> 18:41.860
Yep.

18:41.860 --> 18:42.860
Yeah.

18:42.860 --> 18:43.860
You know, they've they've kept it going.

18:43.860 --> 18:44.860
It's there still.

18:44.860 --> 18:45.860
It's still going, man.

18:45.860 --> 18:48.260
And so I loaded it on there, which I have.

18:48.260 --> 18:53.500
I have legitimately like 10 years of experience of getting this game working on Linux.

18:53.500 --> 18:56.260
So it's like a great test for me in that regard.

18:56.260 --> 18:58.140
It's so frickin flawless now.

18:58.140 --> 19:06.180
And I'm not a big, big gamer, obviously, but I absolutely felt like this laptop would accomplish

19:06.180 --> 19:10.620
all of my gaming needs, which is a nice box to check for this thing.

19:10.620 --> 19:15.300
And on top of that, I feel like this is not like a blow away trackpad, but it's an above

19:15.300 --> 19:16.300
average trackpad.

19:16.300 --> 19:20.520
It's better than probably every other trackpad out there on on a Linux machine.

19:20.520 --> 19:23.900
This probably has the best speakers of any Linux laptop shipping today.

19:23.900 --> 19:26.140
What was your impression of the speakers?

19:26.140 --> 19:30.700
So I was surprised that I could easily do slack and zoom calls such as the one we were

19:30.700 --> 19:36.220
on, which some pro plugged the show because, you know, you got to have that going without

19:36.220 --> 19:40.020
like a headset or mic or anything, and it was pretty good.

19:40.020 --> 19:45.220
You know, I start off iffy and then I fell in love with the machine until I might as

19:45.220 --> 19:47.140
getting sent back for a replacement.

19:47.140 --> 19:48.860
Oh, oh, yes.

19:48.860 --> 19:49.980
So tell us what happened there.

19:49.980 --> 19:53.180
The USBC charging has just stopped working.

19:53.180 --> 19:59.300
So after a good hustle by the system, 76 people to try to figure out, you know, what was the

19:59.300 --> 20:03.900
software, it was concluded that it's actually a hardware issue.

20:03.900 --> 20:05.760
Could have shorted out whatever.

20:05.760 --> 20:09.620
So I will unfortunately be HP dev one list.

20:09.620 --> 20:14.380
I do have the review unit, but it's such a pain in the butt to kind of move into a whole

20:14.380 --> 20:18.660
system just to have to wipe it, knowing that if I wait till like Monday or Tuesday, I'll

20:18.660 --> 20:22.620
have another one, according to HP.

20:22.620 --> 20:25.460
So super good support, though.

20:25.460 --> 20:30.420
And other than that one issue, I would this was is going to be my daily driver once I

20:30.420 --> 20:31.940
have the repaired unit.

20:31.940 --> 20:36.060
And the reason I care so much about the USBC, are we allowed to talk about that little meeting

20:36.060 --> 20:37.060
we were in or no?

20:37.060 --> 20:38.300
Yeah, I think we should mention it.

20:38.300 --> 20:42.380
You and I were on a call with HP and system 76 where they're kind of giving us the background

20:42.380 --> 20:44.860
deets on how this all came together and whatnot.

20:44.860 --> 20:49.660
Yeah, one of the things I had mentioned was like, okay, so if it has USBC, and it has

20:49.660 --> 20:53.740
power over USBC, because at the time of the call, it was still working, it like died like

20:53.740 --> 20:59.380
two hours later, theoretically, this could be kind of the ideal, you know, I'm just sometimes

20:59.380 --> 21:02.900
your home, sometimes you're on the go, just plug in one cable, and you'll have your whole

21:02.900 --> 21:04.380
workstation ready to go.

21:04.380 --> 21:09.540
Yeah, that port that USBC port does do power delivery and display.

21:09.540 --> 21:12.720
So when that you know, when it works, you know, let's talk about this for a second.

21:12.720 --> 21:16.260
So you know, when you're looking at this, what what makes this like a work machine?

21:16.260 --> 21:18.940
Like is this a is this a viable ThinkPad competitor?

21:18.940 --> 21:21.140
Is this a real work machine?

21:21.140 --> 21:24.140
And there, there's a couple things that we learned in that call.

21:24.140 --> 21:31.540
And that is is that system 76 and HP kind of have a ongoing contract of some kind, you

21:31.540 --> 21:32.540
know, some relationship

21:32.540 --> 21:41.660
Yeah, and Carl, the CEO of system 76 in that call said that system 76 is doing quote, indefinite

21:41.660 --> 21:50.960
q&a on every pop OS, kernel release, every firmware release for the dev one, system 76

21:50.960 --> 21:53.160
and HP are both doing q&a.

21:53.160 --> 21:58.660
And then then they ship it upstream with just with with pop OS, just all other pop OS stuff.

21:58.660 --> 22:02.380
So there's not like a special repo or anything for the dev one users.

22:02.380 --> 22:08.660
But in that conversation, Carl said that the first couple of prototypes they got just arrived

22:08.660 --> 22:13.940
as parts in a box, not even assembled, and that they actually assembled the first one

22:13.940 --> 22:17.660
that they got to play with themselves, they put it together, and they brought that up

22:17.660 --> 22:20.960
to mention it's you know, there's real serviceability here.

22:20.960 --> 22:26.200
In fact, the the the HP laptop, the original HP laptop that this dev one is forked from

22:26.200 --> 22:31.160
has a 10 out of 10 on the iFixit repairability score.

22:31.160 --> 22:32.780
So these are things that I think about.

22:32.780 --> 22:37.140
If I'm thinking about a work machine, right, if I'm thinking about like, I'm thinking about

22:37.140 --> 22:42.660
Brent, right, I'm thinking about Wes, I'm thinking about our our hosts like Mike and

22:42.660 --> 22:43.660
like Alex.

22:43.660 --> 22:47.660
And I'm thinking about what if JB got to a point where when we start working with somebody

22:47.660 --> 22:52.420
just to make sure we had a really good setup, we just sent them a machine pre configured

22:52.420 --> 22:56.700
ready to go to connect in this is your podcast laptop.

22:56.700 --> 23:00.960
This would check those boxes for me, it would have the performance, it would have the noise

23:00.960 --> 23:03.920
profile that I'm looking for in a machine I record with.

23:03.920 --> 23:11.300
And it has the support HP has dedicated support staff just for the dev one line.

23:11.300 --> 23:12.300
That's a big deal.

23:12.300 --> 23:13.860
Like that's a real commitment from a company side.

23:13.860 --> 23:18.160
And I'm curious what you picked up on this, but they won't come right out and say it obviously.

23:18.160 --> 23:22.880
But I think they intend this to be like something iterating on like they do another dev one

23:22.880 --> 23:27.800
in a year or so like this could be a multi product line kind of thing if this first one

23:27.800 --> 23:28.800
is successful.

23:28.800 --> 23:32.460
Yeah, I mean, I think you kind of tried to hold their feet to the fire a little bit.

23:32.460 --> 23:39.660
I think in our call right where it's pretty clear that this is not a one time deal.

23:39.660 --> 23:45.620
I'm curious if they stick with the AMD infrastructure there.

23:45.620 --> 23:50.540
It seems at least to my you know, off the cuff testing, it seems super fast.

23:50.540 --> 23:54.980
And that's just what the base 16 gigs of RAM I mean, I was playing XCOM and getting my

23:54.980 --> 24:00.980
ass handed to me just with fantastic fidelity, though.

24:00.980 --> 24:01.980
Again, this isn't a paid.

24:01.980 --> 24:02.980
This is not again.

24:02.980 --> 24:03.980
Yeah.

24:03.980 --> 24:04.980
Nobody's paying us for this.

24:04.980 --> 24:05.980
Nobody's paying us.

24:05.980 --> 24:06.980
Mike bought his own.

24:06.980 --> 24:07.980
I literally Yeah, that's why.

24:07.980 --> 24:08.980
That's why I can get a return.

24:08.980 --> 24:12.900
And I'm you know, I will I will do the same if at the end of my review, which I think,

24:12.900 --> 24:14.820
you know, I'm trending that way right now.

24:14.820 --> 24:18.740
I haven't thrown like a lot of my media and coding jobs that I haven't done a lot of that

24:18.740 --> 24:19.740
stuff yet.

24:19.740 --> 24:24.740
But one of the things that's giving me a pretty good sense that it's going to work out and

24:24.740 --> 24:29.420
another reason why I think this is a good work laptop is it's an open source driver

24:29.420 --> 24:30.980
stack in there.

24:30.980 --> 24:35.180
And ultimately, when it comes to Linux laptops, that's usually when things start getting a

24:35.180 --> 24:39.180
little buggy on you is somewhere in the driver stack, something isn't working.

24:39.180 --> 24:46.080
As Mike knows, as Mike has run into over the years, Mike is god damn you Qualcomm.

24:46.080 --> 24:51.780
This is one of the reviews, one of the strangest ones I've ever done in that usually I fall

24:51.780 --> 24:57.380
in love when I open the box, because I'm easily bribed by stand ups of robot guys.

24:57.380 --> 25:01.460
But then I start to like see all the flaws, right, the fan kicks up, I get moody about

25:01.460 --> 25:04.780
it, I get a decimal reader, things like that.

25:04.780 --> 25:09.660
This one I was kind of like, okay, well, actually, is that not a plastic?

25:09.660 --> 25:11.880
The battery life is actually pretty good.

25:11.880 --> 25:16.420
Look at it adjusting the screen based on the content on the screen to try to minimize battery

25:16.420 --> 25:20.380
usage, but keep the same relative level of brightness, which I don't know if you've noticed

25:20.380 --> 25:22.220
but it does that if you leave that on.

25:22.220 --> 25:23.220
Yeah.

25:23.220 --> 25:24.220
And it's a hell of a screen too.

25:24.220 --> 25:29.340
I mean, Visual Studio Code still thinks I'm 16 and have like, you know, vampire vision.

25:29.340 --> 25:32.740
So I got to go got to do the command, whatever it is the command shift plus there that's

25:32.740 --> 25:33.740
zoom in a little bit.

25:33.740 --> 25:35.700
That's that's that's just VS code.

25:35.700 --> 25:37.740
I have literally been working in it nonstop.

25:37.740 --> 25:44.100
In fact, I'm probably up until today when I you know, I wanted to like see was a software.

25:44.100 --> 25:48.420
So I did the restore thing, you know, the boot into recovery restore.

25:48.420 --> 25:52.300
It's not software, but it's now wiped and ready to be returned.

25:52.300 --> 25:53.300
Thousand Nits.

25:53.300 --> 25:56.340
I ended up turning it down because it's stupidly bright.

25:56.340 --> 26:00.980
But when I'm sitting in Florida on my porch working and it's Florida, it's super nice

26:00.980 --> 26:04.180
to have it not be completely washed out.

26:04.180 --> 26:05.980
I do tons of video calls.

26:05.980 --> 26:09.520
I look like a potato, but that's not its fault.

26:09.520 --> 26:14.300
If these AMD Ryzen chips keep going the way I think they're going, and if system 76 and

26:14.300 --> 26:18.100
HP stick with that platform, this could be a super viable.

26:18.100 --> 26:19.820
And I think it even is today.

26:19.820 --> 26:21.740
Superviable MacBook alternative.

26:21.740 --> 26:23.660
Plus you get all the games.

26:23.660 --> 26:24.660
And I mean, I'm not.

26:24.660 --> 26:25.660
All right.

26:25.660 --> 26:28.340
So like XCOM 76.

26:28.340 --> 26:31.480
I downloaded Age of Empires four, but didn't get to play it yet.

26:31.480 --> 26:32.480
And Sonic Mania.

26:32.480 --> 26:34.860
So I'm not like, you know.

26:34.860 --> 26:36.420
Super gamer due to, you know.

26:36.420 --> 26:40.840
So I'm sure like for the serious newer stuff, you need the GPU.

26:40.840 --> 26:45.900
But if you like indie games or just kind of puzzle or strategy games, this is just fine.

26:45.900 --> 26:48.620
Also, did you try their insane mouse?

26:48.620 --> 26:49.620
Not yet.

26:49.620 --> 26:50.620
No.

26:50.620 --> 26:53.780
It downloaded the app, the mouse configurator.

26:53.780 --> 26:57.500
If you were like a real gamer, I have a feeling you could do all kinds of crazy.

26:57.500 --> 27:00.580
I don't know if this is still a thing, but like Starcraft macros.

27:00.580 --> 27:04.740
Yeah, it did seem like that mouse has support for essentially little mini macros.

27:04.740 --> 27:09.300
Well, it has programmable, I forgot what they call them profiles or context, something like

27:09.300 --> 27:14.100
that, in that app that was written by system 76 for that mouse on that machine.

27:14.100 --> 27:15.100
Yeah.

27:15.100 --> 27:16.100
It's an interesting bit.

27:16.100 --> 27:18.820
So HP has decided to complete the picture of this.

27:18.820 --> 27:24.840
You can add a system 76 launch keyboard and their mouse, which they are they're actually

27:24.840 --> 27:26.780
pretty proud of this mouse.

27:26.780 --> 27:30.940
They actually dedicate a little bit of their presentation to the mouse.

27:30.940 --> 27:31.940
And you know what?

27:31.940 --> 27:34.740
After they talked about it, I was like, oh, oh, that's why that's why they like it so

27:34.740 --> 27:35.740
much.

27:35.740 --> 27:39.220
They call it the HP 935 creator wireless mouse.

27:39.220 --> 27:43.160
It's an 80 dollar addition, but they boast 12 weeks of battery life.

27:43.160 --> 27:46.660
It does a USB-A dongle or it'll do Bluetooth.

27:46.660 --> 27:49.500
Like Mike said, it has four different profile supports.

27:49.500 --> 27:53.100
And then system 76 made that custom GUI for it.

27:53.100 --> 27:56.060
They're trying to complete a whole picture here, but you notice there's kind of a hole

27:56.060 --> 27:57.660
in this picture they're trying to complete.

27:57.660 --> 27:58.660
Yeah, I did.

27:58.660 --> 28:03.620
I think I believe I brought it up that they really should have some calibrated HP monitor

28:03.620 --> 28:09.160
that's calibrated like that panel in the laptop that is USB-C and it's just optimized to be

28:09.160 --> 28:10.620
the plug in workstation.

28:10.620 --> 28:14.900
Yeah, something that it's like consistent across the two screens.

28:14.900 --> 28:15.900
That'd be perfect.

28:15.900 --> 28:18.760
And apparently nobody else thought of that on the call.

28:18.760 --> 28:20.140
Maybe that's for Gen 2, right?

28:20.140 --> 28:24.900
Because if this thing sticks around, you get the sense that things like Core Boot are going

28:24.900 --> 28:25.900
to be part of it.

28:25.900 --> 28:26.900
Core Boot was on the list.

28:26.900 --> 28:33.900
We asked them about that and they just ran out of time for version one is what they said.

28:33.900 --> 28:39.500
The highlight of the call, I think, would be my fondness of liquor coming up as a quality

28:39.500 --> 28:41.540
assurance metric they have.

28:41.540 --> 28:42.740
Amazing.

28:42.740 --> 28:44.020
Actually happened.

28:44.020 --> 28:45.100
Nicely done, Carl.

28:45.100 --> 28:46.100
Nicely done.

28:46.100 --> 28:50.020
Michael Dominic, I understand you were going to do some spill testing.

28:50.020 --> 28:51.980
But yeah, so that actually happened.

28:51.980 --> 28:55.700
They mentioned it and it does supposedly have a spill proof keyboard.

28:55.700 --> 29:02.100
I tried to get them to really get specific and they were like, well.

29:02.100 --> 29:06.700
Well, you know, yeah, I'm like, well, and then of course I had to tell them it was broken

29:06.700 --> 29:09.700
and the first thing I have to say, I did not spill anything.

29:09.700 --> 29:12.700
Of course you did.

29:12.700 --> 29:14.500
I had to open with that.

29:14.500 --> 29:15.500
I said it's just got to start.

29:15.500 --> 29:16.500
Of course you did.

29:16.500 --> 29:19.180
Yeah, because they know you, man.

29:19.180 --> 29:20.180
They know you.

29:20.180 --> 29:21.180
They know me.

29:21.180 --> 29:26.100
I'm still kind of getting acquainted with it, but I, like you, had a very similar experience

29:26.100 --> 29:32.360
where I took it out of the box, I got it plugged in, but I am so damn busy that I didn't even

29:32.360 --> 29:35.100
power it on for probably, you know, the next day.

29:35.100 --> 29:39.260
I just didn't get, I didn't even get to it because, you know, I don't know, I got a lot.

29:39.260 --> 29:44.100
And so I fired up, I have set up so many laptops over the years that I can start to get a sense

29:44.100 --> 29:48.380
of a machine pretty quickly and get an idea if it's going to be making a lot of noise

29:48.380 --> 29:52.540
and if it feels hot and okay, you know, those, it's passing all of those things.

29:52.540 --> 29:54.500
It's doing a really good job.

29:54.500 --> 30:00.380
It wasn't until I wrapped up the workday and I just kind of, I put everything away and

30:00.380 --> 30:03.780
I just stayed here at the studio a little bit so I could take advantage of the bandwidth

30:03.780 --> 30:07.700
and I just started throwing everything at it because I was kind of in a rush.

30:07.700 --> 30:11.260
And so, you know, I was using it in anger as they say, although, you know, not angry,

30:11.260 --> 30:14.000
but just slamming everything at it.

30:14.000 --> 30:15.580
And that's when it started to impress me.

30:15.580 --> 30:18.720
You know, when a machine can take everything and still has, you can tell it still has more

30:18.720 --> 30:20.840
to give, I like that a lot.

30:20.840 --> 30:24.020
And you can upgrade this thing to 64 gigs of RAM.

30:24.020 --> 30:26.540
So if you need more headroom than 16 gigs, you can do it.

30:26.540 --> 30:29.860
I just don't think you can do it at time of configuration.

30:29.860 --> 30:33.340
But I get the sense too that you could probably replace other components in there as well.

30:33.340 --> 30:37.140
I'm tempted to open up my review unit and see just how serviceable it really is because

30:37.140 --> 30:38.820
they did stress that.

30:38.820 --> 30:39.820
I don't know.

30:39.820 --> 30:44.940
I'm tempted to say this thing is a contender for the crown of king of Linux laptops.

30:44.940 --> 30:46.580
They are in it to win it.

30:46.580 --> 30:47.880
They really are.

30:47.880 --> 30:51.980
And we did ask them, how did this relationship come to be?

30:51.980 --> 30:56.460
That was a question that was asked, which they weren't going to touch on.

30:56.460 --> 31:02.680
And it sounds very much like HP got serious about wanting to get into this segment and

31:02.680 --> 31:05.900
realize they needed a topic expert.

31:05.900 --> 31:14.100
And my observation on that call that we had is that HP intimately understands the hardware,

31:14.100 --> 31:19.100
the supply chain and the relationships, like relationships with AMD.

31:19.100 --> 31:26.180
But System76 truly intuitively understands the Linux community and shipping a product

31:26.180 --> 31:27.940
for that crowd.

31:27.940 --> 31:31.300
And so I think those two things are actually working pretty well together.

31:31.300 --> 31:34.460
It sounds like HP realized they needed that topic expert.

31:34.460 --> 31:38.620
HP reached out to Carl, took a little bit of time.

31:38.620 --> 31:40.540
They started talking.

31:40.540 --> 31:44.500
They kind of realized, OK, actually, there is some things that kind of work here.

31:44.500 --> 31:50.500
And specifically, Carl said, at the end of the day, this is an opportunity to reach more

31:50.500 --> 31:54.180
Linux users on a tier one hardware OEM.

31:54.180 --> 31:57.240
And they didn't build Pop OS to only run on System76 hardware.

31:57.240 --> 31:59.640
They built it for anyone to use.

31:59.640 --> 32:03.320
So it gets Pop OS out there, too, which is a great thing for them.

32:03.320 --> 32:06.100
But I feel like they actually committed.

32:06.100 --> 32:11.260
When you hear that they just kind of banged out a GUI tool to configure HP's mouse and

32:11.260 --> 32:15.740
that they're doing a definite Q&A and they have dev ones in-house that they're testing

32:15.740 --> 32:23.060
firmware releases on and kernel releases on, it seems like often when System76 does something,

32:23.060 --> 32:24.580
they really go all in on it.

32:24.580 --> 32:32.620
So I'm interested to see where this product line goes and when I can get my monitor.

32:32.620 --> 32:34.180
Linode.com slash coder.

32:34.180 --> 32:37.860
Go there to get $100 in 60 day credit on a new account.

32:37.860 --> 32:39.940
And it's a great way to support the show.

32:39.940 --> 32:41.980
Linode is fast, reliable cloud hosting.

32:41.980 --> 32:45.580
Everybody in this audience eventually has a need for that.

32:45.580 --> 32:50.980
And unlike those crazy, hyper-complicated duopoly platforms that want to lock you into their

32:50.980 --> 32:57.580
esoteric interface with their esoteric names for everything, Linode is classic hosting

32:57.580 --> 32:58.740
where you have full control.

32:58.740 --> 33:00.580
I mean, don't get me wrong.

33:00.580 --> 33:01.940
They got a great dashboard.

33:01.940 --> 33:08.260
They make it super easy to do one click deployments and manage your DNS and set up VLANs and work

33:08.260 --> 33:12.740
with whatever infrastructure management tools you might have, like Terraform, Ansible, Kubernetes,

33:12.740 --> 33:13.740
etc.

33:13.740 --> 33:17.900
But also, if you just want to stand up some infrastructure, if you just want to take advantage

33:17.900 --> 33:23.100
of some really fast, really reliable, really well-supported hosting, you want to run something

33:23.100 --> 33:29.740
on Linux, you want to build a project, Linode is great for that, for an individual or for

33:29.740 --> 33:30.740
a business.

33:30.740 --> 33:33.380
Like I run my family gaming servers on Linode.

33:33.380 --> 33:36.980
I've mentioned this before, Starbound, fun little game, right?

33:36.980 --> 33:39.900
Minecraft, kids love it.

33:39.900 --> 33:43.860
Why not create a safe space for them on the internet on my own Linode or like my own Sync

33:43.860 --> 33:46.180
thing server, stuff like that.

33:46.180 --> 33:47.180
But we use it on our backend.

33:47.180 --> 33:51.780
In fact, we're using it more than ever and pretty soon it'll be powering so much more.

33:51.780 --> 33:56.700
And to that end, Linode has just upgraded their managed database services.

33:56.700 --> 33:59.940
So earlier it was just MySQL.

33:59.940 --> 34:01.300
And they launched that in May.

34:01.300 --> 34:04.500
And that's been super helpful because Linode knows how to do this stuff.

34:04.500 --> 34:05.900
They know how to do hosting.

34:05.900 --> 34:08.220
They can take care of that.

34:08.220 --> 34:12.020
Well this week they've added Postgres and MongoDB.

34:12.020 --> 34:14.260
Well we use Postgres for several things.

34:14.260 --> 34:17.500
And Wes and I are already talking about migrating to this.

34:17.500 --> 34:19.580
Why wouldn't you, right?

34:19.580 --> 34:23.220
Outsource the responsibility of that maintenance and monitoring.

34:23.220 --> 34:26.940
All the burdens that make running a database a pain in the butt.

34:26.940 --> 34:28.140
Outsource it to Linode.

34:28.140 --> 34:30.100
Let their experts do it.

34:30.100 --> 34:33.960
I am so hyped that they finally launched this and I can't wait to switch some of our backend

34:33.960 --> 34:35.100
stuff over to it.

34:35.100 --> 34:36.460
That's just great.

34:36.460 --> 34:38.440
I also love their object storage.

34:38.440 --> 34:40.180
I think you'll be blown away.

34:40.180 --> 34:42.500
I think you'll be really impressed.

34:42.500 --> 34:43.500
Go try it.

34:43.500 --> 34:47.460
You'll get that $100 and support the show.

34:47.460 --> 34:53.020
What you do, right now in your browser, you go to linode.com slash coder.

34:53.020 --> 34:57.100
That's a vote of confidence for the coder program and it gets you that $100 for 60 days

34:57.100 --> 34:58.420
on a new account.

34:58.420 --> 35:03.300
Linode.com slash coder.

35:03.300 --> 35:05.000
Well we have a little bit of leftovers.

35:05.000 --> 35:11.420
Just brief leftovers from WWDC and we have some text editor news, drama going on I suppose.

35:11.420 --> 35:13.620
So let's start there.

35:13.620 --> 35:20.060
GitHub has announced they are sunsetting the Atom text editor and the original creator

35:20.060 --> 35:25.900
of Atom has announced that he's introducing Zed, a collaborative code editor written in

35:25.900 --> 35:26.900
Rust.

35:26.900 --> 35:27.900
He's going out like that?

35:27.900 --> 35:28.900
That's right.

35:28.900 --> 35:29.900
He's coming back.

35:29.900 --> 35:34.420
Yeah, although Zed was announced first I believe in the order of events and then the sunsetting

35:34.420 --> 35:37.380
of Atom was announced and you caught that.

35:37.380 --> 35:38.940
You were like, this is weird.

35:38.940 --> 35:43.180
The Atom guy just announced a new project.

35:43.180 --> 35:52.460
And of course it's built in Rust because everything is built in Rust these days.

35:52.460 --> 35:56.140
There's a better way to write code.

35:56.140 --> 35:59.300
Mission critical tools should be hyper responsive.

35:59.300 --> 36:03.140
Real time collaboration products are better software.

36:03.140 --> 36:05.660
Conversations should happen close to code.

36:05.660 --> 36:08.220
Oh yeah, it definitely needs a chat client.

36:08.220 --> 36:14.060
I was just complaining to my wife that ultimately every tech product evolves to have a chat

36:14.060 --> 36:15.060
platform.

36:15.060 --> 36:17.260
Every tech product ultimately has a chat platform.

36:17.260 --> 36:21.060
No, no, no, no.

36:21.060 --> 36:23.060
Honestly I'd give it a go.

36:23.060 --> 36:25.020
I'd give a Rust text editor a go.

36:25.020 --> 36:27.460
I will too just because it's not Electron.

36:27.460 --> 36:29.780
Yeah exactly.

36:29.780 --> 36:32.940
Any thoughts about Atom sunsetting?

36:32.940 --> 36:35.180
I mean it was inevitable, right?

36:35.180 --> 36:41.860
You know, VS Code exists, they were under the same parent, right, GitHub effectively

36:41.860 --> 36:44.220
because Microsoft bought GitHub.

36:44.220 --> 36:47.260
So only one could survive, I don't know.

36:47.260 --> 36:50.500
How many Electron editors do you need?

36:50.500 --> 36:51.500
Just saying.

36:51.500 --> 36:52.500
Yeah.

36:52.500 --> 36:53.500
Yeah, I agree.

36:53.500 --> 36:54.500
I agree.

36:54.500 --> 36:59.660
It feels a little sad because whenever something gets replaced and killed, you know, it's just

36:59.660 --> 37:01.260
but it is the right call.

37:01.260 --> 37:04.020
I happen to know there's audience members out there that love Atom.

37:04.020 --> 37:08.380
Yeah, you hear from them every once in a while every time VS Code releases a new feature

37:08.380 --> 37:09.380
that's tied to Azure.

37:09.380 --> 37:13.260
They're like, ha ha, see, we warned you.

37:13.260 --> 37:16.180
But alas, they also owned Atom.

37:16.180 --> 37:17.180
I think you're right.

37:17.180 --> 37:18.180
Get off my bridge.

37:18.180 --> 37:23.420
All right, little WWDC leftovers, just a couple of things that didn't make it into our show

37:23.420 --> 37:29.340
because I don't know, I was moderately disappointed with our coverage, mostly things I didn't

37:29.340 --> 37:32.460
mention because I was in such a rush.

37:32.460 --> 37:37.460
But then again, I listened to some other podcast coverage and they get so drunk on the hype

37:37.460 --> 37:38.460
that it's embarrassing.

37:38.460 --> 37:40.220
I was going to say, what are you disappointed in?

37:40.220 --> 37:42.580
We managed to stay like not Apple high.

37:42.580 --> 37:43.900
I do think we did a good job there.

37:43.900 --> 37:46.180
We did not get crazy.

37:46.180 --> 37:48.260
We did get a follow up from Apple.

37:48.260 --> 37:51.780
Stage manager on the iPad does require an M1 iPad.

37:51.780 --> 37:54.940
Only the M1 iPads have that virtual memory space.

37:54.940 --> 38:01.100
We suspected, that's right, so speculated, but Apple confirmed.

38:01.100 --> 38:06.220
Also didn't mention it in our coverage, no tease of the Mac Pro, which seems late at

38:06.220 --> 38:14.100
this point, and no hints at all about AR or VR, even though that was massively hype before

38:14.100 --> 38:15.160
the event.

38:15.160 --> 38:18.600
There was nothing there that kind of implied that.

38:18.600 --> 38:22.140
But I think the big thing that we didn't know at the time we recorded, but we now know after

38:22.140 --> 38:31.380
the fact, Apple has created a binary for x86 Linux boxes that's Rosetta.

38:31.380 --> 38:36.940
They've created Rosetta 2 for Linux that'll work on any modern ARM processor, any ARM

38:36.940 --> 38:42.780
processor that meets the 8.2 spec or later can run this Apple Rosetta binary.

38:42.780 --> 38:47.640
Now you got to get your hands on it and the way you get it is pretty ridiculous.

38:47.640 --> 38:51.860
You have to be on a Mac using a hypervisor that's probably Apple's and then you have

38:51.860 --> 38:56.880
to mount a directory inside your VM to get access to it.

38:56.880 --> 39:00.500
But assuming, and I believe it's already happened, the Linux community just figured out how to

39:00.500 --> 39:02.840
extract that and I think that's already happened.

39:02.840 --> 39:10.780
You can throw this conceivably in an x86 container and then go run it on an ARM 8.2 or newer

39:10.780 --> 39:11.820
CPU.

39:11.820 --> 39:14.500
Doesn't have to be a Mac box in theory.

39:14.500 --> 39:19.060
Rosetta for Linux, an actual Linux ELF binary.

39:19.060 --> 39:20.140
That seems like a big deal to me.

39:20.140 --> 39:23.700
That also seems to signal that Rosetta is going to be around for a long time and we're

39:23.700 --> 39:26.940
going to be able to run x86 apps on Macs for a long time.

39:26.940 --> 39:27.940
Yeah.

39:27.940 --> 39:30.500
I mean, I think this is going to be important for some developers.

39:30.500 --> 39:31.500
Yeah.

39:31.500 --> 39:33.620
Rosetta has got at least five to 10 years, right?

39:33.620 --> 39:37.620
I guess the difference, although I don't know, I just was reading speculation, I guess the

39:37.620 --> 39:45.600
difference was Rosetta 1 contained a lot of code licensed from IBM and Rosetta 2 is an

39:45.600 --> 39:47.540
Apple creation.

39:47.540 --> 39:51.340
So they own it all so they could just run it forever and definitely if they wanted to.

39:51.340 --> 39:52.340
Then why not?

39:52.340 --> 39:59.580
I mean, maybe not forever, but also just a side note, not really relevant to the show,

39:59.580 --> 40:04.820
but we didn't really understand at the time, but Apple announced a buy now pay later service

40:04.820 --> 40:08.760
and Apple is actually going to be the lender in that situation.

40:08.760 --> 40:10.540
Apple has just turned into a lender.

40:10.540 --> 40:13.380
I believe they're working with Goldman Sachs again on this.

40:13.380 --> 40:20.200
They will handle the lending themselves for a buy now pay later offering using Apple pay.

40:20.200 --> 40:21.520
How dystopian is that?

40:21.520 --> 40:25.260
It's a long way from the kids with the rainbow apple and the pirate flag.

40:25.260 --> 40:26.260
That's for damn sure.

40:26.260 --> 40:27.260
Wow, man.

40:27.260 --> 40:28.260
Wow.

40:28.260 --> 40:33.820
I mean, we're talking asset trips and ashrams to, we're in a deep partnership with our good

40:33.820 --> 40:38.020
friends at Goldman Sachs and we're now a bank.

40:38.020 --> 40:44.740
Also just to kind of round this out, Intel CEO Pat was talking big at an event, you know.

40:44.740 --> 40:46.500
The word you're looking for is drunk.

40:46.500 --> 40:47.500
Yeah.

40:47.500 --> 40:50.400
I think he might've been drunk or at least delusional.

40:50.400 --> 40:55.700
He said in a quote, in an interview to Axios, he said that they think they can win Apple's

40:55.700 --> 40:56.700
business back.

40:56.700 --> 41:00.780
He says, quote, Apple decided they could do a better chip themselves than we could and

41:00.780 --> 41:05.340
you know, they did a pretty good job, so what I have to do is create a better chip than

41:05.340 --> 41:06.940
they can do themselves.

41:06.940 --> 41:11.860
I would hope to win them back, to win a piece of their business as well as many other pieces

41:11.860 --> 41:13.780
of their business over time.

41:13.780 --> 41:19.340
Now, in other news, I just got this text message transcript, Tim, I'm sorry.

41:19.340 --> 41:20.340
What did I do?

41:20.340 --> 41:21.340
Please call.

41:21.340 --> 41:22.340
No reply.

41:22.340 --> 41:24.780
Tim, I miss you.

41:24.780 --> 41:26.540
Now it's, now, wait, wait, now it's 2 30.

41:26.540 --> 41:28.040
The bar has closed.

41:28.040 --> 41:33.260
You know what, Tim, if you like that M1 so much, then you can have them.

41:33.260 --> 41:36.640
Next day around noon, Pat, you're starting to scare me.

41:36.640 --> 41:37.640
Please leave me alone.

41:37.640 --> 41:38.640
It's over.

41:38.640 --> 41:41.580
I have my own chip engineers now.

41:41.580 --> 41:42.580
All the best.

41:42.580 --> 41:43.580
I wish you a happy life.

41:43.580 --> 41:44.580
Oh man.

41:44.580 --> 41:45.580
Your friend, Tim.

41:45.580 --> 41:49.620
Pat wakes up three hours later at 3 30.

41:49.620 --> 41:51.420
Tim, you're killing me.

41:51.420 --> 41:52.860
I miss you so much.

41:52.860 --> 41:55.140
Have you heard about Gen 12?

41:55.140 --> 41:56.140
Question mark.

41:56.140 --> 41:57.140
Happy face.

41:57.140 --> 41:59.860
No reply.

41:59.860 --> 42:01.340
That is probably exactly what happened.

42:01.340 --> 42:02.340
I think you nailed that.

42:02.340 --> 42:03.860
I think I just got it, right?

42:03.860 --> 42:04.860
I got it.

42:04.860 --> 42:10.580
You know, I watch sometimes the CNBCs and the Intel, Pat comes on, he comes on there,

42:10.580 --> 42:11.580
the Intel CEO.

42:11.580 --> 42:12.580
It's so sad.

42:12.580 --> 42:17.300
And, and they're like, boy, looking at the numbers, Intel is sort of set for like devastating

42:17.300 --> 42:19.820
losses in the latter half of the year.

42:19.820 --> 42:20.820
And he's like, sure are.

42:20.820 --> 42:21.820
I'd be, oh wait.

42:21.820 --> 42:22.820
No, no.

42:22.820 --> 42:23.820
He's like, no, no.

42:23.820 --> 42:24.820
It's going to be great.

42:24.820 --> 42:28.740
There's going to be a big surge of computer purchases in the fall.

42:28.740 --> 42:29.740
And have you heard of Ohio?

42:29.740 --> 42:30.740
Ohio, right?

42:30.740 --> 42:31.740
Yeah.

42:31.740 --> 42:32.740
Oh man.

42:32.740 --> 42:35.980
Like he's just, oh anyways, they're so screwed.

42:35.980 --> 42:36.980
They're so screwed.

42:36.980 --> 42:39.260
But Qualcomm though, they, they are bullish.

42:39.260 --> 42:40.260
They're going to nail this.

42:40.260 --> 42:45.340
Qualcomm's chief executive said on Thursday, they believe the company actually will have

42:45.340 --> 42:51.140
the best chip on the market soon with help from a team of chief, with help from a team

42:51.140 --> 42:56.100
of chip architects who formerly worked at Apple, but now work at Qualcomm.

42:56.100 --> 42:57.100
That's how you do it.

42:57.100 --> 42:58.100
That's how you do it.

42:58.100 --> 43:00.020
Qualcomm's like, we're not even going to pretend anymore.

43:00.020 --> 43:02.060
We're just going to bribe a bunch of dudes from Apple.

43:02.060 --> 43:03.060
Let's go.

43:03.060 --> 43:04.060
That's pretty impressive.

43:04.060 --> 43:05.060
That is.

43:05.060 --> 43:09.660
For the record, if you guys like the sad breakup text message of tech executives, I have many

43:09.660 --> 43:12.180
of those in the bank.

43:12.180 --> 43:15.580
I feel like it could be a series right there.

43:15.580 --> 43:19.780
We did have a couple of boosts come in, but the show, as we record this year's show, I

43:19.780 --> 43:22.780
think our show has only been out for like 12 hours, 13 hours.

43:22.780 --> 43:23.780
Yeah.

43:23.780 --> 43:24.780
We're like back to back.

43:24.780 --> 43:30.940
But the golden dragon sent us in 222 sats, missed a duck, minus one duck today.

43:30.940 --> 43:32.300
So I can get through a week on these sats.

43:32.300 --> 43:35.700
Glad to hear that the dev one is a great system to dev on.

43:35.700 --> 43:40.380
Maybe one you should go full inception on and dev on the dev one using the dev one Linux

43:40.380 --> 43:41.380
distribution.

43:41.380 --> 43:42.380
Whoa.

43:42.380 --> 43:43.980
He sent that in live to the show.

43:43.980 --> 43:44.980
Very sneaky, Doug.

43:44.980 --> 43:45.980
Damn.

43:45.980 --> 43:46.980
All right.

43:46.980 --> 43:47.980
Very nice.

43:47.980 --> 43:49.980
I feel like you get a special boost, Yale, for sending that in live.

43:49.980 --> 43:50.980
Boost.

43:50.980 --> 43:53.200
We also got a thanks from Cos Peeland.

43:53.200 --> 43:56.500
He sent in his classic 3690 sats.

43:56.500 --> 43:59.860
And then we got one in here that I think is going to get you fired up.

43:59.860 --> 44:01.660
I almost don't want to read their name.

44:01.660 --> 44:02.660
See if I can find it.

44:02.660 --> 44:05.780
Because I don't want to read their name on air.

44:05.780 --> 44:06.780
It's Egon?

44:06.780 --> 44:07.780
No.

44:07.780 --> 44:12.140
I'm pretty sure if you don't, we're just going to assume it's Egon.

44:12.140 --> 44:13.140
Yeah.

44:13.140 --> 44:14.140
No.

44:14.140 --> 44:15.140
No, it wasn't Egon.

44:15.140 --> 44:16.140
I know there was one more in here.

44:16.140 --> 44:17.140
Here it is.

44:17.140 --> 44:18.140
Here we go.

44:18.140 --> 44:19.140
Here we go.

44:19.140 --> 44:20.140
All right.

44:20.140 --> 44:27.040
So this was actually a pretty generous 5,000 sats boost from Crashmaster 18.

44:27.040 --> 44:31.620
And he's asking about an app that smells a lot like Alice, and he wants to know if you're

44:31.620 --> 44:32.620
familiar with it.

44:32.620 --> 44:34.660
But I don't even want to give them a plug on air.

44:34.660 --> 44:35.820
Oh, I've not.

44:35.820 --> 44:39.940
I will PM you the name of this.

44:39.940 --> 44:41.420
Here, I'll put the boost in here.

44:41.420 --> 44:43.660
See if you've recognized that name.

44:43.660 --> 44:44.980
Now you tell me.

44:44.980 --> 44:47.260
Anyways, Crashmaster wanted to know.

44:47.260 --> 44:49.300
So I'll pass it along to you.

44:49.300 --> 44:51.780
You go get them, you know?

44:51.780 --> 44:56.460
I hate to see you go into war on the air, but Crashmaster wanted you to be aware.

44:56.460 --> 44:57.460
Mm-hmm.

44:57.460 --> 44:58.460
I'll take a look.

44:58.460 --> 44:59.460
I do not.

44:59.460 --> 45:00.460
This does not look familiar.

45:00.460 --> 45:01.460
All right.

45:01.460 --> 45:02.540
Well, I also want to thank our members.

45:02.540 --> 45:03.660
Thank you very much.

45:03.660 --> 45:07.400
We get offers to do things that you would be surprised.

45:07.400 --> 45:09.900
We have gotten offers to do paid hardware reviews.

45:09.900 --> 45:12.560
We have gotten offers to do paid interviews.

45:12.560 --> 45:17.060
We get approached by all kinds of sponsors that are kind of probably not the sorts that

45:17.060 --> 45:19.100
you would probably prefer to hear from.

45:19.100 --> 45:20.500
And you've created chip executives.

45:20.500 --> 45:23.180
Well, I would take that sponsorship.

45:23.180 --> 45:25.660
I would take that and tell money like that.

45:25.660 --> 45:26.900
Would I use the Intel machine?

45:26.900 --> 45:28.500
No, but I would take their money.

45:28.500 --> 45:29.780
I would love that.

45:29.780 --> 45:33.460
But no, you notice how we don't have mattress sponsors, right?

45:33.460 --> 45:36.860
Or like a Squarespace, like these ones that, you know, come on.

45:36.860 --> 45:41.920
Have you noticed a lot of the higher end podcasts are now offering you, shall we say, sausage

45:41.920 --> 45:44.280
pills for male enhancement?

45:44.280 --> 45:45.880
Isn't that fascinating to watch?

45:45.880 --> 45:51.260
Also having a membership feeds let us do things like avoid dynamic inserts on our back catalog

45:51.260 --> 45:53.100
to monetize the back catalog, right?

45:53.100 --> 45:58.140
It's just the membership is it's it's like a real key pillar to how we do the show.

45:58.140 --> 46:01.860
So thank you to our Coder QA team at Coder QA dot co.

46:01.860 --> 46:03.900
As a thank you, get an ad free version of the feed.

46:03.900 --> 46:06.660
I am working also on a live version of the feed, but it's going to take a little bit

46:06.660 --> 46:11.740
of tech back end work and you get the Coderly report, Coder QA dot co.

46:11.740 --> 46:16.680
I think we should also mention that you and I will not be live the week of the 20th, Monday

46:16.680 --> 46:17.680
the 20th.

46:17.680 --> 46:22.420
You and I are traveling and there will be no Coder live that week, but we will have

46:22.420 --> 46:23.760
one in the feeds.

46:23.760 --> 46:27.940
So we should clarify we are traveling, but because of the laws of physics, we are not

46:27.940 --> 46:33.380
traveling to the same place or together or at the same time in the same space, because

46:33.380 --> 46:34.380
that would right.

46:34.380 --> 46:36.940
That would be you can't have two atoms share the same.

46:36.940 --> 46:41.900
Oh, can we just do a quick Star Trek update before we oh, oh, yeah, totally.

46:41.900 --> 46:42.900
You got a strange already.

46:42.900 --> 46:44.400
You got a strange worlds update already.

46:44.400 --> 46:50.180
I continue to like strange worlds and I have once again finished the original series.

46:50.180 --> 46:53.300
Oh, season three could be the trickiest to get through.

46:53.300 --> 46:54.300
I just finished it.

46:54.300 --> 46:55.300
I've tossed.

46:55.300 --> 46:56.300
Yeah, I just finished it.

46:56.300 --> 46:57.460
I know that can be a little tricky.

46:57.460 --> 46:59.100
It's not that's not the best season.

46:59.100 --> 47:05.020
The last episode is super weird, but I'm at a I'd say a fork, but it's more of a trident

47:05.020 --> 47:06.460
in the road.

47:06.460 --> 47:10.460
The obvious choice, I think, is next generation, but that's the one I've watched the most.

47:10.460 --> 47:16.100
Yeah, I'm a big fan of bald dudes who pretend to be French, but are definitely British.

47:16.100 --> 47:19.100
Yes, they try to retcon that in Picard, by the way.

47:19.100 --> 47:20.100
Do they really?

47:20.100 --> 47:21.100
Yeah, they do.

47:21.100 --> 47:22.100
They try to.

47:22.100 --> 47:26.700
And then, of course, there's like, well, should I give disco another chance because, you know,

47:26.700 --> 47:29.160
Star Trek with good effects is actually kind of cool.

47:29.160 --> 47:35.420
And then there's the one I keep neglecting because I just it's enterprise.

47:35.420 --> 47:40.960
I mean, I was hoping you were going to say that I've never really given it a fair shake.

47:40.960 --> 47:47.060
So that's I just finished season one of Enterprise and I'm just starting season two this week.

47:47.060 --> 47:48.060
Probably this weekend.

47:48.060 --> 47:55.780
Season two, and I initially didn't love Enterprise, but I watched all of it when it aired.

47:55.780 --> 48:00.420
And I have to tell you, rewatching it now, if it's been a while since you watched it

48:00.420 --> 48:04.820
rewatching it now, it is so much better than I remember.

48:04.820 --> 48:09.620
And I think in part because Discovery and Picard have changed my perspectives a little

48:09.620 --> 48:18.820
bit, this this is the last Trek filmed in the traditional Trek style with the character

48:18.820 --> 48:25.180
actors that spanned multiple series and the some of the same production crew.

48:25.180 --> 48:31.080
So it has a very familiar style, but it has the best effects of any of the Trek series.

48:31.080 --> 48:37.980
And the other thing that is extremely enjoyable is everyone is competent at their jobs.

48:37.980 --> 48:40.700
And and they're ahead of the audience most of the time.

48:40.700 --> 48:44.300
Like, you know, when you're watching something, I mean, the characters, not the actors.

48:44.300 --> 48:45.300
Yeah.

48:45.300 --> 48:46.300
Yeah.

48:46.300 --> 48:48.940
You know, like when you're watching something on Discovery and you're like, well, you know,

48:48.940 --> 48:52.100
if they would just do X, Y, Z, this problem would be solved and it's not really a big

48:52.100 --> 48:53.100
deal.

48:53.100 --> 48:56.620
And they don't do that for like three episodes and it drives you crazy in Enterprise.

48:56.620 --> 49:01.100
Right as you start going, well, you know, if they would just they do it, they do it

49:01.100 --> 49:03.820
because they're competent and they're smart.

49:03.820 --> 49:06.660
And it's it's so much better than I expected.

49:06.660 --> 49:08.260
It's so much better.

49:08.260 --> 49:11.080
And it has been very enjoyable to go back and rewatch it.

49:11.080 --> 49:14.660
And if I'm enjoying season one this much, I can't imagine how much I'm going to enjoy

49:14.660 --> 49:19.740
season three and four, because I remember season one and two being the rockiest of them.

49:19.740 --> 49:23.660
And I was just looking at Rotten Tomatoes, you know, now has an audience average score

49:23.660 --> 49:25.580
of seventy nine percent.

49:25.580 --> 49:32.620
And the actors who play Malcolm and Trip, they've recently started a podcast called

49:32.620 --> 49:33.620
Shuttle Pod One.

49:33.620 --> 49:35.140
I believe it's just based on their episode.

49:35.140 --> 49:36.940
They did overcast.

49:36.940 --> 49:37.940
Yeah.

49:37.940 --> 49:40.180
And it's it's on YouTube as a video production, too.

49:40.180 --> 49:43.940
And they've been bringing on former directors and their costars.

49:43.940 --> 49:49.740
They just did one with Rick Berman and they just did a two parter with Brandon Braga.

49:49.740 --> 49:52.420
And you know, they were the people running production at the time.

49:52.420 --> 49:57.180
So you get like I just started watching Enterprise again and then they launched that podcast

49:57.180 --> 50:00.860
and then they're bringing on people and they're talking behind the scenes about the first

50:00.860 --> 50:01.860
few seasons.

50:01.860 --> 50:04.900
It has been so neat.

50:04.900 --> 50:06.700
It's a you got to go Enterprise, man.

50:06.700 --> 50:07.860
You've got to do it.

50:07.860 --> 50:08.860
You got it.

50:08.860 --> 50:09.860
Can I throw two curveballs at you?

50:09.860 --> 50:11.300
Oh, yeah, of course.

50:11.300 --> 50:14.780
I have never completed all of Stargate, but I love Stargate.

50:14.780 --> 50:15.780
OK.

50:15.780 --> 50:19.300
And if I want to be a deep nerd, although I don't know that I have the stomach for this

50:19.300 --> 50:22.660
one, Babylon Five, man, I have tried Babylon Five.

50:22.660 --> 50:23.660
I can't get through that.

50:23.660 --> 50:26.420
I feel like I should like it, but I've never made it past.

50:26.420 --> 50:27.860
I can't get through that first season.

50:27.860 --> 50:29.340
I've tried so hard.

50:29.340 --> 50:33.540
I just watched a YouTube or recap the Babylon Five series and it did make me want to watch

50:33.540 --> 50:34.540
it.

50:34.540 --> 50:36.740
But Enterprise isn't going anywhere.

50:36.740 --> 50:37.740
Right.

50:37.740 --> 50:40.540
So you could do a little bit of deviation.

50:40.540 --> 50:41.780
Have you done The Expanse yet?

50:41.780 --> 50:42.780
No, I have not.

50:42.780 --> 50:44.580
Is that a comedy or is that Orwell?

50:44.580 --> 50:45.580
That's Orwell.

50:45.580 --> 50:46.580
Whatever.

50:46.580 --> 50:47.580
Yeah, that's Orwell.

50:47.580 --> 50:48.580
Oh, boy.

50:48.580 --> 50:49.580
Oh, boy.

50:49.580 --> 50:52.420
I used to just watch TNG over and over again.

50:52.420 --> 50:53.420
I'm freaking out.

50:53.420 --> 50:54.420
Oh, God, Mike.

50:54.420 --> 50:55.420
Oh, God.

50:55.420 --> 50:56.940
I would kill to be you right now.

50:56.940 --> 50:59.980
I am so jealous that you haven't seen The Expanse yet.

50:59.980 --> 51:02.300
So where is The Expanse available to me?

51:02.300 --> 51:03.300
Amazon Prime.

51:03.300 --> 51:04.300
OK.

51:04.300 --> 51:10.460
And I took three passes at the first few episodes because I didn't like the character it initially

51:10.460 --> 51:15.900
focuses on, but that character isn't the main character of the series.

51:15.900 --> 51:20.620
And by the time I got through the first season, I was really into it.

51:20.620 --> 51:24.740
In fact, if a wizard came out of a genie, a genie came out of a bottle and they said

51:24.740 --> 51:27.040
to me, Chris, you can have one wish in the world.

51:27.040 --> 51:29.800
It wouldn't be, you know, rich.

51:29.800 --> 51:32.640
It wouldn't be that I live forever.

51:32.640 --> 51:33.760
It wouldn't be any of that.

51:33.760 --> 51:37.900
It would be make Star Trek like The Expanse.

51:37.900 --> 51:38.900
It is.

51:38.900 --> 51:39.900
Oh, you're writing some checks.

51:39.900 --> 51:40.900
So good.

51:40.900 --> 51:41.900
It is so good.

51:41.900 --> 51:44.720
It's it's what's going to be our future.

51:44.720 --> 51:45.720
What The Expanse.

51:45.720 --> 51:48.780
It's almost it's almost it's almost inevitable.

51:48.780 --> 51:53.540
It's if humanity just kind of spread out into our solar system, but we never go beyond our

51:53.540 --> 51:54.540
solar system.

51:54.540 --> 51:55.540
Right.

51:55.540 --> 52:00.840
Because when because this this show actually takes place with the use of the limitations

52:00.840 --> 52:01.840
of space.

52:01.840 --> 52:02.840
Right.

52:02.840 --> 52:06.520
Because they don't have like crazy technology that wouldn't actually exist.

52:06.520 --> 52:10.880
Combat is incredible because it's like it really, really would be in space.

52:10.880 --> 52:13.540
And they nail the realism so well.

52:13.540 --> 52:16.420
They make such good characters, such good storytelling.

52:16.420 --> 52:19.700
And then on top of that, the books are incredible.

52:19.700 --> 52:24.620
And it's one of those rare things where the books don't really take anything away from

52:24.620 --> 52:25.740
the show.

52:25.740 --> 52:28.000
They just add more context.

52:28.000 --> 52:32.000
You could watch the show and never read the books, or you could watch all of the show

52:32.000 --> 52:35.380
and then read the books, or you could read the book and watch the show together.

52:35.380 --> 52:36.380
Like I've done all of that.

52:36.380 --> 52:37.380
Oh, my God.

52:37.380 --> 52:38.380
Sold.

52:38.380 --> 52:39.380
Sold.

52:39.380 --> 52:40.380
That's what I'm doing.

52:40.380 --> 52:41.380
It's so great.

52:41.380 --> 52:44.700
And the audiobooks from Audible are some of my favorite audiobooks of all time.

52:44.700 --> 52:46.140
You know, you got to go look up The Expanse series.

52:46.140 --> 52:48.140
It's kind of hard because there's like a lot of those books.

52:48.140 --> 52:51.880
Only the first six books are really where the TV show takes place.

52:51.880 --> 52:55.260
Some of the best television ever created ever.

52:55.260 --> 52:56.620
And just give you an idea.

52:56.620 --> 53:01.500
So the show started on sci fi, but it was so expensive to produce that sci fi shut it

53:01.500 --> 53:02.500
down.

53:02.500 --> 53:05.340
But the fans love the show so much they freaked out.

53:05.340 --> 53:08.200
And one of the fans was Jeff Bezos.

53:08.200 --> 53:11.900
So Jeff Bezos just bought the whole thing and moved it over to Prime.

53:11.900 --> 53:12.900
Yeah.

53:12.900 --> 53:13.900
Thanks.

53:13.900 --> 53:14.900
So good, man.

53:14.900 --> 53:15.900
I.

53:15.900 --> 53:18.420
We're so spoiled.

53:18.420 --> 53:19.420
I'd love to watch that again.

53:19.420 --> 53:20.420
All right.

53:20.420 --> 53:21.420
So.

53:21.420 --> 53:26.020
So with apologies to Captain Archer yet again, that seems to keep happening every year.

53:26.020 --> 53:28.800
The Expanse it is and I see that there's seven seasons currently.

53:28.800 --> 53:29.800
So this will take a while.

53:29.800 --> 53:30.800
Yeah.

53:30.800 --> 53:31.800
But they're not too long.

53:31.800 --> 53:32.800
They're so good.

53:32.800 --> 53:33.800
So, so good.

53:33.800 --> 53:34.800
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

53:34.800 --> 53:35.800
Oh, so good.

53:35.800 --> 53:36.800
Oh, man.

53:36.800 --> 53:37.800
Anyways.

53:37.800 --> 53:38.800
I got it.

53:38.800 --> 53:39.800
I got to go lay down now.

53:39.800 --> 53:40.800
I'm so excited.

53:40.800 --> 53:41.800
Let's let's wrap this up.

53:41.800 --> 53:42.800
I'm I'm I'm for Clempt now.

53:42.800 --> 53:45.100
Is there any way you want to send people this week?

53:45.100 --> 53:46.940
Go to Alice.dev.

53:46.940 --> 53:48.420
Nice and easy.

53:48.420 --> 53:49.980
He's at Dumanuco on the Twitter.

53:49.980 --> 53:50.980
We'll have links there.

53:50.980 --> 53:51.980
I'm at Chris Ellis.

53:51.980 --> 53:56.060
The podcast is at Coder Radio Show and the whole network's at Jupiter signal.

53:56.060 --> 53:59.380
You know, there's a whole network of shows.

53:59.380 --> 54:04.140
We did a breakdown on that Rosetta story, the details of that in Linux action news.

54:04.140 --> 54:08.900
And I'm going to do my Linux user's perspective review on Linux Unplugged of the HP Dev 1.

54:08.900 --> 54:13.380
I'll throw some benchmarks at it, really push it all the way in Sunday's Linux Unplugged.

54:13.380 --> 54:14.980
So check that out.

54:14.980 --> 54:18.480
Links to what we talked about today at coder.show slash four seven zero.

54:18.480 --> 54:21.220
That's where you'll find our contact form and our RSS feed.

54:21.220 --> 54:22.220
We'd love to hear from you.

54:22.220 --> 54:25.140
Thanks so much for joining us on this week's episode of the Coder Radio program.

54:25.140 --> 54:34.420
We'll be right back here next week.
