00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,000
This is Koda Radio, episode 461 for April 11th, 2022.

2
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,360
Hello good looking and welcome into Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show, taking a

3
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:25,200
pragmatic look at the art and the business of software development and the world of technology.

4
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:28,240
I'm sitting here in a toasty, rawly North Carolina.

5
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:33,440
My name is Chris and joining us from a swampy Florida, it's our host, Mr. Dominic.

6
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:34,440
Hello, Mike.

7
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:35,440
Hello, Chris.

8
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:36,440
Hello, sir.

9
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:37,440
Hello.

10
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:38,440
Hello.

11
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:40,320
And we should say welcome back to the show, Mr. Payne.

12
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:41,320
Hello, Wes.

13
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:42,320
Oh, hey, boys.

14
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:45,920
If I only knew the words to welcome back Cotter.

15
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:51,560
We're glad to have you here, Wes, and it worked out perfect too, because we were all gathered

16
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:55,840
together here in Alex's bed and breakfast, also known as house, and you were floating

17
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:58,160
through and I said, come on, sit down, let's do a show.

18
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:00,520
Let's do a little Cotter, because the audience has been wanting to hear from you.

19
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:03,800
And it's been too long since I got to talk to Mike.

20
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:04,800
Yeah.

21
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:08,040
So we're gathered here together today.

22
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:11,800
Although it looks like I was looking over the Twitter, as you know, I stalk Mike.

23
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:14,840
And it looks like you were having some car troubles this week.

24
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:15,900
Ah, yes.

25
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:21,440
Once again, technology destroys a perfectly good mechanical device.

26
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:25,440
Apparently the computer in my car has decided that there shall be no fuel injected into

27
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:26,440
my engine.

28
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:27,720
Oh, no.

29
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,760
And it decided this while I was in the car.

30
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:31,020
Oh, yes.

31
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:33,520
So that was a double toe job.

32
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,400
And I'm still waiting to double toe job.

33
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,920
Now that sounds like we're going to explicit rating.

34
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:38,920
And yes, I will.

35
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:43,400
I will update the audience whenever GM decides to do something about it.

36
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:45,900
Man, oh, man, that sucks.

37
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:48,680
That's just one of those wrenches in your life you never expect.

38
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:51,100
And it's just not easy to deal with.

39
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:54,540
You know, Optimus Gray in the chat room points out, this might be one of the few times we

40
00:01:54,540 --> 00:02:00,120
do this here Koder radio program when we're in the same time zone.

41
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,120
That's weird.

42
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:05,640
And you know, you have Koder is like an after lunch thing for you.

43
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:06,640
Yeah.

44
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,640
Right.

45
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:09,440
And for me, it's like a pre-lunch thing.

46
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:12,820
I'm in a totally different time space than you normally.

47
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:14,720
So maybe this episode is going to be a little weird.

48
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:15,720
I don't know.

49
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:18,040
Or you'll be in more in sync than ever.

50
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:19,040
Maybe.

51
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,040
Well, we're going to find out.

52
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,040
We're going to find out.

53
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:25,440
Either way, I think everybody is taking a breath of fresh air, a sigh of relief.

54
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,040
Elon's not going to be on the board.

55
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,560
I know you're looking forward to it, Mike.

56
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,560
I really was, actually.

57
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,600
Yeah, actually, I agree.

58
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:32,760
I was so down for that.

59
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:33,760
Yeah.

60
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:36,680
Today, they announced, oh, he's not going to be on the board as we record today.

61
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:39,460
And there's all kinds of theories this morning as to why.

62
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:43,600
Do you guys have personal pet theories as to why Elon decided not to go on the board

63
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,600
of Twitter?

64
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:47,680
Tesla AI told him not to.

65
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,520
It steered him right away from the board meeting.

66
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,520
I like Wes's better.

67
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,520
Mine is dumb.

68
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:57,360
I think he just realized the SEC was probably not going to put up with his shenanigans forever.

69
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,360
I could see that.

70
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,360
I could see that.

71
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,760
Because he screwed up the filing, too, right?

72
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,560
I think, too, they had a little talking.

73
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,880
Because if you read through this really strange announcement, there's two things that stick

74
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:06,880
out.

75
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:07,880
So weird.

76
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:09,880
First of all, they mentioned a background check.

77
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:12,400
Why do you even say that?

78
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:16,500
And then the other thing they mention in here is that he has a fiduciary responsibility

79
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:20,080
to limit what he says, essentially, is what they say about the company.

80
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:23,600
You have to kind of agree to only talk about certain things when you're a member of the

81
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:24,600
board.

82
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,640
It limits what you can say about Twitter.

83
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,000
And I think that was it.

84
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I think he's like, no way.

85
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,760
I wonder why he hasn't done this before.

86
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:36,160
Why don't Bezos and Musk and Buffet, why don't they buy all these companies up?

87
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,160
You know what?

88
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38,160
Just-

89
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,160
I guess Bezos does it sometimes, right?

90
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:40,160
Washington Post at least.

91
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,160
True.

92
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:42,160
True.

93
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,160
Monsters.

94
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,160
That's a good point.

95
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:45,160
All right.

96
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,160
Well, let's move on.

97
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,160
Boostergram.

98
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:50,960
Boostergram came in from Freak three days ago, 6,000 sats, too.

99
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:55,060
So he just recently switched all over from Android to iOS.

100
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:56,340
Rest in peace, Freak.

101
00:03:56,340 --> 00:04:00,080
And he says the one thing that's driving him crazy is he wants to slap his iDevice when

102
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:04,080
it autocorrects the last word after he presses send.

103
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,340
Android never did that, he said.

104
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:08,660
That is probably the most annoying thing about iOS.

105
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:12,960
I can't tell you how many times the F word has been replaced with duck after I hit the

106
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:13,960
send button.

107
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:16,500
Like, what the duck, you know?

108
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:17,880
I did not realize this was the thing.

109
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:22,040
Now it's been, I don't know, six years since I regularly had an iPhone, but is that a new

110
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,040
development?

111
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,040
No, it's been-

112
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:27,880
I mean, they've been trying to machine learn how to autocorrect for a while, so maybe it's

113
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:28,880
gotten worse.

114
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:29,880
I don't know.

115
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:31,440
But yeah, it's been like that for a bit.

116
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,440
Yeah.

117
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:33,440
Yeah, that does stink.

118
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,440
You poor devils.

119
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,440
I know.

120
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,440
I don't know how we do it.

121
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:37,440
I don't.

122
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,960
We got another boost from Cospeland.

123
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:43,360
He says, okay, guys, what are your thoughts on iCloud versus NextCloud?

124
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,360
What would be the point?

125
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,360
And thanks for the show.

126
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,080
It feels like two separate solutions.

127
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:51,680
I don't know, you'd use NextCloud if you don't want to be on somebody else's cloud.

128
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:52,680
That's it.

129
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:56,080
I can also see maybe you want, you know, you use bits and pieces, like you might need iCloud

130
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:59,840
for some of the iOS specific backup kind of things, right?

131
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,760
But you don't have to do it for everything.

132
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:04,560
You could self host some of the pieces you wanted in your NextCloud.

133
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:08,080
I can see the appeal, like maybe Mike would want to set one up for like his team at some

134
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,080
point.

135
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:10,080
I don't know.

136
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,640
But most people are not using iCloud for the same stuff.

137
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:15,400
Yeah, I don't see iCloud in like a work environment.

138
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:19,400
I know Apple is supposedly coming out with something like that, some kind of like small

139
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,400
business program.

140
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,400
But I don't know.

141
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:25,720
When I think iCloud, I still have scars from core data iCloud having to implement it and

142
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,840
just the massive sync bugs.

143
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:34,080
We had several people that boosted in, boost, asking if they could boost us from the member

144
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,840
feed, which we have not set up.

145
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,080
It's amazing they'd like to do that, but not right now.

146
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,920
But it has us talking internally about how we could do that.

147
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:44,520
We all shows feed did just get the possibility to boost.

148
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:46,000
I just added that before we left.

149
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Nicely done, sir.

150
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Pure, pure, pure.

151
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
All right.

152
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,000
So it looks like something's going on with tea, which is a package manager that is an

153
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,960
alternative to brew.

154
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:58,680
Harold wrote in and I said, I thought maybe you guys would want to take a closer look

155
00:05:58,680 --> 00:05:59,780
at this.

156
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:06,000
Did you notice that they pitched themselves as brew two for web three brew two for, yeah,

157
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
web.

158
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Sorry.

159
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Oh, little nauseous.

160
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
So there's something blockchain.

161
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,320
I'm just curious, did we ever get to the bottom of what is blockchain about this new package

162
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:14,320
manager?

163
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:16,040
You know, I haven't had a chance to actually try tea.

164
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,080
I'm not sure.

165
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,360
Let's find out though.

166
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:22,040
I'm looking at it and I don't get it.

167
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,720
I don't, I don't get it.

168
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,040
How much money did they raise exactly?

169
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,040
Oh yeah.

170
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,040
Did they raise money?

171
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,040
They raised money.

172
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:30,600
This is not, so I think this is my mistake.

173
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:34,680
I thought this was just like a, you know, a successor from brew, like by the creator

174
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,680
of well brew.

175
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:40,940
It also seems to have like slightly wider ambitions, maybe wherever you develop, wherever

176
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:47,600
your CICD runs, however you deploy your app, tea is there, which is, you know, with their

177
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,600
$8 million.

178
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,600
Oh.

179
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,600
Oh.

180
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:56,280
So this is, this is not, this is a somewhat commercial, which is this my open core dreams

181
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:57,760
coming true?

182
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:01,240
Maybe, but now with a web three name.

183
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,240
Of course.

184
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:05,000
Well, you have to get the VC to open your email somehow.

185
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Hmm.

186
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
So this is probably going to warrant further investigation.

187
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Yeah.

188
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
$8 million.

189
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Look at this.

190
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,640
To create a new open source software on the blockchain.

191
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:14,640
Yeah.

192
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:18,200
It's like, you know, for a while we were seeing everybody bacon machine learning and AI into

193
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,200
their product description.

194
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:24,160
And it's like blockchain was a fad before that and then AI took over and now blockchain's

195
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,160
back again.

196
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,160
Blockchain's back baby.

197
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:32,160
And you know, I gotta say just for the record, like I don't think there's a lot of strong

198
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:37,400
use cases for blockchain outside a distributed ledger for a currency.

199
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:39,400
Like it's really good at that.

200
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:42,440
But a lot of times when you see what they're using a blockchain for you go, well that could

201
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:43,920
just also be a database.

202
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:44,920
Hmm.

203
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:45,920
Yeah.

204
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:49,120
And it's like they're using blockchain because it's like cool and stuff, but you know, blockchains

205
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:53,080
are in order to be secure, they're generally not very fast and if they're not very fast

206
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:56,400
and they don't seem to scale what like would you would in theory want for something like

207
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,400
a package manager?

208
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,400
Yeah.

209
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:01,160
You know, they mentioned being decentralized, but exactly how?

210
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,160
Hmm.

211
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,160
Yeah.

212
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:05,680
Don't you want your package manager to in fact be centralized somewhat so that you can

213
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,680
trust?

214
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:07,680
I think so.

215
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,960
I mean, I think maybe you want both, but.

216
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:12,560
Well, so we've just reinvented PPAs.

217
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,560
Congratulations.

218
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:19,120
A couple of weeks ago we read an email from listener Brandon who has a big old raspberry

219
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,760
pie cluster going on.

220
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:21,760
Hooey.

221
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:22,760
Hooey.

222
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:27,800
So he's got three pies and a single pie four and all three are powered with power over

223
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,200
Ethernet, which is awesome.

224
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:31,640
So he's got a little switch to do that.

225
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:35,860
They run Ubuntu with Ubuntu's Kubernetes K3 solution.

226
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:40,140
He's got terabyte hard drives connected to them and then he makes all of the K pods available

227
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:42,780
via NFS.

228
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:43,780
This is so cool.

229
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:49,060
He said, I had a job requirement for me to learn Kubernetes very quickly in order to

230
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:53,400
lead a team building and deploy and that was deploying the K workload.

231
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,720
So he sets up this big old cluster here.

232
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:59,280
He's like, it's not really a big deal, but you know, it's kind of a fun project and if

233
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:04,440
any listeners have a few raspberry pies laying around, it's definitely worth a go.

234
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:07,280
Also it's been astounding to watch the show's 180 on blockchain and web 3 tech.

235
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:10,640
I left the initial episode from last year feeling pretty unhappy about the general sentiment

236
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:14,040
on the show, so it's been good to see a more nuanced take on the tech.

237
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:18,800
The state of the tech in the politics is intersecting and it's actually been pretty piss poor lately.

238
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:22,040
So it's nice to see some people with big ideas trying to create a better future, regardless

239
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:25,000
of how it goes or if it's likely planned to go.

240
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,160
Anyways, thanks for the show, Brandon.

241
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:29,720
Well, there you go.

242
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:32,260
We got a lot of shit for talking about blockchain stuff.

243
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:34,160
We got a lot of shit for that.

244
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,200
We had some good positive feedback too.

245
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:41,080
You know, I also like in that feedback that you hear a lot kind of just the blasé statement

246
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:45,560
that yeah, raspberry pies are great to learn on and all this, but it's just neat to see

247
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:49,320
you really can use like some just cheapo devices you have at home to set up a cluster that

248
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:51,320
actually helps you in a work environment.

249
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:55,080
Yeah, it's not exactly the same, but you learn a lot of really useful skills.

250
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,080
You can put SUSE on there.

251
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,080
You can put SUSE on there.

252
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,080
You can put open SUSE on there.

253
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,080
Or NixOS maybe.

254
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:00,080
Yeah.

255
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,080
Yeah.

256
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,080
Or Ubuntu.

257
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:05,800
All right, last email that comes in.

258
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:08,880
Now, here's the thing.

259
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:11,920
This is a thing we're gonna have to deal with as a show, but we're gonna get through this

260
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,400
together, okay?

261
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,280
We're gonna get through this together.

262
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:17,680
Five is leading a manhunt.

263
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:24,560
So at the meetup this week, Mike was unable to attend, and there began a contingent that

264
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:31,520
broke off that sort of has created this conspiracy bacon that's completely ridiculous that Mike

265
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:35,840
and I are the same person, and Mike is just a voice that I'm doing.

266
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:38,680
So I mean, that's absolutely crazy, but Five writes in.

267
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:42,560
He says, you know, I flew all the way from Minneapolis to talk to Mike about the only

268
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:47,720
real macOS that I would ever think of compiling Objective-C on, Next Step.

269
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:49,480
That's a bold, bold statement, sir.

270
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:50,480
Bold.

271
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:54,520
But he said, you know what, Chris got to find out I'm not a jerk in real life, just a digital

272
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:55,520
space.

273
00:10:55,520 --> 00:11:00,300
Also, he pointed out that the super spreader tent was great, but wasn't the same without

274
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:02,440
our famous Floridian.

275
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:06,320
So one of the things Alex did is he brought a tent where we put like name tags and a book.

276
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,920
Where is that damn book?

277
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,680
That is a very good question.

278
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:12,000
We had over a hundred people, around a hundred people show up.

279
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,360
And a good turnout of Coder fans, that's for sure.

280
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,360
Definitely.

281
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,360
Definitely.

282
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,840
I think there's plotting to go down to Florida now.

283
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:23,480
I mean, I didn't tell them to go for it, but like I said, this group just sort of broke

284
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:24,480
off on their own.

285
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,480
We tried to control them.

286
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:30,000
Well, you know, you can always like hire an actor when you're doing this voice, right?

287
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,320
So that's true.

288
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:36,760
I think it worked out for the best though, because, you know, I was a little, I was like

289
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:39,160
thinking, do I need to like wear a mask?

290
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:43,000
Like how do I make sure that we don't meet at this meetup because I don't want to mess

291
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,160
with the show.

292
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,320
And so we've punted that problem one more time.

293
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,320
You know, I was going to go.

294
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:51,800
I was going to come dressed in a robe, but with just, you know, a space ball style Vader

295
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:52,800
helmet on.

296
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:53,800
Yeah.

297
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:54,800
That's a good idea.

298
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:55,800
It's funny you say that.

299
00:11:55,800 --> 00:12:00,200
A Vader helmet was recommended to me by someone else, but I was worried about it getting real

300
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,880
hot in that Vader helmet.

301
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:03,320
You know, and you got to really commit to that.

302
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:04,320
Yeah.

303
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,320
I'm in Florida.

304
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,320
We define hot slightly differently.

305
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,320
True.

306
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,320
True.

307
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,320
It's a little sticky already.

308
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,320
It won't change anything.

309
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:14,400
You know, I got an email mentioning next steps, so, you know, it's a little sticky already.

310
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,400
Right.

311
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,400
It's already a little sticky.

312
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,680
We had, of course, some local folks show up.

313
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:20,080
We had from Virginia.

314
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:25,360
We had from Pennsylvania, New York, DC, Florida, Canada.

315
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,360
People came from all around.

316
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:27,360
It was really great.

317
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,800
I think we're going to do it again.

318
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,840
Here's an obvious statement in retrospect.

319
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:32,640
There's actually a lot of tech business in Raleigh.

320
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:33,640
Oh yeah, dude.

321
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:34,640
Oh yeah.

322
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:35,640
I didn't realize it.

323
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:36,640
I knew Red Hat was here.

324
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:39,200
I'm kind of a sleeper, you know, you don't hear about it all the way out on the West

325
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,720
Coast necessarily.

326
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:44,840
You northern westerners, whatever you are, you got to come down Dixie.

327
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:48,120
We're blinded by San Francisco and the glittering lights of New York City.

328
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:49,120
And Seattle.

329
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,120
Is Seattle closer to you?

330
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:51,120
Yeah.

331
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,120
Oh yeah.

332
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:53,120
Oh yeah.

333
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,240
We have to stare at the Amazon and Microsoft folks all the time.

334
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,240
Oh.

335
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,240
Speaking of Darth Vader.

336
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:58,240
Darth Balmer.

337
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,840
And I guess Apple's opening up an office here now.

338
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:03,680
So there's going to be an Apple Raleigh office.

339
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:07,240
And then because we're near Virginia, we got, you know.

340
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:08,240
The government crowd.

341
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:11,160
We got some government people coming down too.

342
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:12,160
But that's great.

343
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,200
We accept all types.

344
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,200
So I think we're going to do it again.

345
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:16,640
I think I don't know when, but we'll do it again at some point in the future.

346
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:20,120
So if you didn't make it out, don't worry.

347
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,120
We'll do it again.

348
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:24,440
You're just going to roll the dice one more time, Mike's got another chance to see your

349
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,600
smiling face.

350
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:34,280
To redeem myself and handout, I am ordering DVDs of Snow Leopard for everybody.

351
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,840
Linode.com slash coder.

352
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:40,000
Go there to get $100 in 60 day credit on a new account and you go there to support the

353
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
show.

354
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,840
Linode is fast and reliable cloud hosting.

355
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:45,320
You got to try it for your next project, for the next thing you deploy.

356
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:48,680
It's what I use for everything I've built in the last two and a half years.

357
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:51,760
Especially now that Linode has been rolling out these MVME PCI drives.

358
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:55,360
I didn't realize it, but like one of my boxes, I can just click a button and upgrade it.

359
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,360
It kind of depends on my location.

360
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:00,360
And another one of my boxes I've already upgraded.

361
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:02,160
I love it when things get faster.

362
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:05,860
I've recently been using Linode's tools to help troubleshoot and manage our super in

363
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:08,800
demand matrix server for our community right now.

364
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:11,880
And it's so, so slick to have these dashboards they give you.

365
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:15,480
They're not like overly complicated and they have really sensible thresholds you can set

366
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:16,480
for alerting.

367
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,040
So I know when something's going on.

368
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:21,160
And you know, for this trip, I went in there and I just boosted that system up.

369
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:22,280
I made it a monster.

370
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:25,200
I have a 48 core Linode box right now.

371
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:27,320
And if you're a performance hound, you're going to love Linode.

372
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:31,640
But if you need it for something simple, like a portfolio, maybe a simple GitLab, I don't

373
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:36,140
know, maybe a photo gallery, they have like $5 Linodes that are rock solid and still come

374
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:39,520
with the same great support that the 48 core rigs have.

375
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:45,040
That's what Linode is known for is fantastic support, fantastic performance, and really

376
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:48,480
sticking to the core product and just making it better and better and better.

377
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:52,060
And with 11 data centers around the world, you're going to find something near you or

378
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:53,140
your customers.

379
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:57,400
And since they've been doing this for 19 years, I can guarantee you they're just really in

380
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:58,680
a groove.

381
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:02,400
They're not trying these crazy VC backed ideas and things like that.

382
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:07,560
They're iterating on a product that works and has millions of customers around the world.

383
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:10,880
And they have great features like built in cloud firewall.

384
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:13,560
Their object storage is super useful.

385
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:14,880
They have VLAN support.

386
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:20,640
Of course, they have advanced DNS support, really powerful Kubernetes and Terraform support,

387
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:24,760
super fast networking, bare metal servers, if that's the way you want to go, and a new

388
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:27,760
database as a service, I guess.

389
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,880
That seems like it has a lot of potential.

390
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:33,280
And of course, they wrap it all up with an easy to use powerful cloud dashboard.

391
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:38,320
Man, there's so many reasons we use Linode, but I think you'll find something that fits

392
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,320
for you.

393
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:40,320
You'll see why.

394
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:44,160
And with pricing 30 to 50% cheaper, I think you're going to be happy to stick around.

395
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:46,260
So go get that $100 and try it out.

396
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:47,640
See what we've been talking about.

397
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:52,320
See why we stuck with it for so long, and we love promoting them on our shows, linode.com

398
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,320
slash coder.

399
00:15:53,320 --> 00:16:01,280
Go get that $100 and enjoy it and let us know what you think, linode.com slash coder.

400
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:06,440
So we were just kind of casually talking about the warp terminal a few episodes ago.

401
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:11,980
And we're seeing, I think, a wave of quote unquote developer focused tools get a ton

402
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:17,000
of funding and warp has raised $23 million.

403
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
He's up.

404
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Million.

405
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Did you see this coming?

406
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,360
I mean, $23 million for a terminal?

407
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:24,320
Yeah, kind of, right?

408
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,320
I knew it was going to be a lot.

409
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:29,560
If you look at the way they've been recruiting, and Zach Lloyd, kind of his background, I

410
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:32,840
think he was like head of development or head of product at Google Drive.

411
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:36,280
Or I'm sorry, Google Docs, although isn't that Google Drive now?

412
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:37,560
I have no idea.

413
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:38,560
Yeah, nobody does.

414
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:43,520
Well, I'm on the Google work plan, and they just keep renaming stuff on me just to screw

415
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:44,520
with me, I think.

416
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:47,240
Hey, would you like them to include a little chat in there, too?

417
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:48,240
That would be great.

418
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,240
A separate new one.

419
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:50,240
Yeah.

420
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,240
That doesn't connect.

421
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:52,240
No, I don't need another chat.

422
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,240
God damn it.

423
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:54,360
G chat was fine.

424
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:55,360
It really was.

425
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,360
It was totally fine.

426
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:57,360
It was nice.

427
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,600
Like, oh, Slack is doing the same stuff, by the way.

428
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:03,280
Let's add every feature we can think of, slow the thing down to the point where you get

429
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:08,600
notifications on all your devices because we can't synchronize anymore.

430
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:09,600
What were we talking about?

431
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:10,600
Sorry.

432
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:12,520
Well, we were talking a little bit about Zach Lloyd.

433
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:16,760
You know, he's been grinding away at stuff like this for 20 years, so maybe it's kind

434
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:18,320
of nice that he finally got a big break.

435
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:20,880
I mean, I don't know how he's done previous to this, but...

436
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:21,880
Very well.

437
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:22,880
He was a monkey-muck at Google.

438
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:23,880
Oh, yeah.

439
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:24,880
Fair enough.

440
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:25,880
Fair enough.

441
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:29,480
It's interesting because they've been doing a lot of the rounds, Warp in particular.

442
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:36,440
They keep suggesting that one day the terminal could be open sourced, Warp Terminal.

443
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:39,080
And I've been using it day to day, and I've been getting the updates.

444
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:42,760
It definitely looks like they're...I'm sure they would phrase it differently, but they're

445
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:46,760
looking to go towards a cloud-first development environment.

446
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:51,760
I would not be shocked if there was just a terminal.warp.com, enter your username, and

447
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:52,760
that's your terminal.

448
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:53,760
Mm-hmm.

449
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:56,680
Because the whole thing is...it is Rust native.

450
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:58,240
Is it Rust or Go?

451
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,240
I think it's Rust, right?

452
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:00,600
Yeah, I believe it is Rust.

453
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:01,960
It is Rust.

454
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:06,840
But it's also partially built using stuff from Alacrity, which is interesting.

455
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:11,480
Their kind of value add is, one, they treat the terminal, the graphics, a little differently,

456
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:16,280
so you can do kind of the GUI copy-paste stuff easier than you might in, let's say, Mac

457
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:19,160
Terminal or G Terminal.

458
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:22,800
But they're pushing pretty aggressively on this.

459
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:27,560
You can synchronize your SSH session with a homie, and that's how you can do onboarding

460
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:28,560
for people, right?

461
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:29,920
Setting up tool chain with them.

462
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:35,000
A lot of cloud-first kind of...your settings can live in the cloud.

463
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:39,880
For instance, you have to log in with GitHub, which I know, when this TechCrunch article

464
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:44,280
came out, kind of the first time they've gotten a real lot of attention, the good old boys

465
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:49,360
at Hacker News were not super thrilled to get the login prompt, which I completely understand.

466
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,160
Login to my terminal?

467
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:55,960
Yeah, you know, legit, it's the GitHub...it's literally a GitHub OAuth prompt.

468
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:57,160
I don't like that either.

469
00:18:57,160 --> 00:19:00,880
So for my freedom-loving hippies, except you have to be on Mac because for some reason

470
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:06,520
everybody's doing this all on Mac first, there's FIG, fig.io.

471
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:14,240
And all FIG is, is context-aware auto-completion of your particular tooling.

472
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:19,420
Now they have some they support like NPM, Kubernetes, stuff like that, but I can tell

473
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:24,460
you that I cannot spell the minute I type in NPM because I hate it.

474
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:30,200
And I am actually going to try this on...well, it works with HyperTerminal, the Mac Terminal,

475
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:32,920
obviously, Alacrity, and a few others.

476
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:33,920
Take a look.

477
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:39,200
This is one...theoretically this works on Linux if you're using Alacrity.

478
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:42,600
I wouldn't be shocked if there's a Google Terminal available.

479
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:47,120
They also have a way to just add it directly into ZShell, Phish, or Bash if you don't like

480
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:50,480
have one of the fancy pants terminals that they support.

481
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:54,920
Additionally, it works in the VS Code terminal and the JetBrains terminals if you live in

482
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:55,920
those IDEs.

483
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:56,920
Wow.

484
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:57,920
That's really cool.

485
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:00,680
So this is like...so it's fig.io.

486
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:01,680
I'm kind of impressed.

487
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:02,680
Mike seems to know more.

488
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:05,520
I've actually been using this a little bit at work in my day-to-day playing with it,

489
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:06,640
but I haven't gone that deep.

490
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:09,160
I didn't realize they had fancy terminal integration.

491
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:13,160
I've just been using it like a plain old regular person in iTerm.

492
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:15,720
Oh, so Super Bowl, how are you finding it?

493
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:17,440
I like it a lot.

494
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:23,560
I haven't written any of my own completions or gone super deep into it, but for just running

495
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:28,000
around in the terminal, doing regular Git operations, that kind of stuff, yeah, it's

496
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
pretty handy.

497
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,600
And it's not...I have not found it intrusive at all.

498
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,880
There's never been any of those times I wanted it to just disappear.

499
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:35,840
It's just kind of an optional extra.

500
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:36,840
All right.

501
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:38,340
That's a nice one.

502
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:39,920
And is it open source?

503
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:42,160
Is it commercial?

504
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:43,800
It's MIT licensed, it looks like.

505
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:49,960
Yeah, but there are some...there is like some investment, I believe that Y Combinator backed

506
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:50,960
it.

507
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:53,560
I think they have $2.4 million in funding, maybe.

508
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:54,560
There you go.

509
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:55,560
Oh, I'm the one who wrote the note.

510
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:56,560
That's why.

511
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:57,560
I don't even remember.

512
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:58,560
Yeah.

513
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:01,520
But so this is kind of...we've been talking about these tooling things, and I've been

514
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:06,480
like bitching that people are mean to me because I want to do something open core.

515
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:10,440
And I feel like somehow, under the radar, a bunch of people have gotten together and

516
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:14,240
like, we're going to do terminal stuff, and we're going to basically make it open core.

517
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,760
And are they just not saying open core?

518
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,560
No, they're just not using the word, right?

519
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:20,680
They're saying free for individuals, which is the same damn thing.

520
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:21,680
Interesting.

521
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:26,720
Also, it's kind of nice to see stuff focused on the terminal, like IDEs have been such

522
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,720
a dominant...which is fine, but...

523
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:29,720
Text editors.

524
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:30,720
Mm-hmm.

525
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:31,720
You know?

526
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:34,240
And I think they both kind of give you access to different things.

527
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:37,800
IDEs, you get this big smorgasbord of all kinds of options, and it really does like

528
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:40,200
the epitome of a big gooey app.

529
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:43,400
But there are times where the terminal style of workflow is better.

530
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:48,100
So if you can get some of the kind of like static analysis, semantic stuff, aware of

531
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:53,360
your environment stuff you've come to expect from an IDE in the terminal, heck yes.

532
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:54,360
Win-win.

533
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:57,880
Plus, there's devs that grew up with like fancy IDEs that, you know, they might kind

534
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:02,160
of...a terminal might seem old if we don't sort of backport some of that stuff over there.

535
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:03,160
Yes.

536
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:04,160
That's a good point.

537
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:07,400
It's definitely the season for developer tooling to make money.

538
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:13,480
March 31, Docker announced they raised a Series C of $105 million.

539
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:16,420
And when you go through it, of course, it's bang capital ventures.

540
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:17,420
Of course.

541
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:22,720
They don't even really get very specific why they did it.

542
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:27,000
Their whole reasoning seems to be, well, we think the developer ecosystem is going to

543
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,840
continue to grow like crazy.

544
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:33,640
We expect that this particular market, the Docker address is going to forex over the

545
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:34,800
next year.

546
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:38,240
And so we're going to put money into Docker, even though they don't seem to really have

547
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:41,560
a solid plan, or we're not really sure how these returns are going to work.

548
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:43,800
But this market's growing.

549
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:47,160
$105 million is nothing to sneeze at.

550
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:48,160
Not at all.

551
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:52,040
I'll jump the gun on you, but you know what I've been using in production, and I didn't

552
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:55,080
even know they were sponsoring the show until last week?

553
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:56,080
Tailscale.

554
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:57,080
That's right.

555
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:58,960
Tailscale is awesome, isn't it?

556
00:22:58,960 --> 00:22:59,960
It's beautiful.

557
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:04,600
You can have a bunch of very precariously tied to something Raspberry Pis that have

558
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:08,000
a 5G connection, and you can make sure they're still alive.

559
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Yeah.

560
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,240
And they're all in that flat network.

561
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,240
That's right.

562
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:13,320
I mean, yeah, no doubt about it.

563
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:16,280
Right now, the machine I'm sitting at is connected back to the studio with Tailscale.

564
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:17,680
That's so freaking great.

565
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:20,680
But this is a real, this is a genuine endorsement right there.

566
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:26,760
In fact, why don't we talk about Tailscale?

567
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:28,640
Tailscale.com slash coder.

568
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:31,900
Oh, let's go outside and enjoy the day in the sun.

569
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:32,900
Come on, doggy.

570
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:38,000
I got Archie with me here, and we're in Raleigh, North Carolina, and I'm preparing the show

571
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,540
out here in the sunshine.

572
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:40,540
How nice is that?

573
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:41,540
And I'm using Tailscale to do it.

574
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:45,520
I thought, what a great opportunity to talk about how useful Tailscale is.

575
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:47,120
It's super quick to get started.

576
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:49,680
Just a couple of minutes, you'll install it on any OS.

577
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:51,080
I have it on my mobile devices.

578
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:53,600
I have it on my Linux boxes, ARM and x86.

579
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:56,080
I have it on my VPS servers.

580
00:23:56,080 --> 00:24:00,480
And really before the trip, one of the things I did to prepare was I got Tailscale set up

581
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:03,540
on the last couple of devices that I didn't have it on.

582
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:08,220
Now I'm going to sit out here in the sunshine, and thanks to Tailscale, I'm going to enjoy

583
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:10,440
some vitamin D while I prepare the show.

584
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:14,520
So this is a little bit of out of time ad read, I suppose, but it just seemed like what

585
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:18,760
a great opportunity to really demonstrate the power of Tailscale.

586
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:22,960
Because say I need to get to the booths or I need to get to our notes system, you need

587
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,520
the kind of like web dashboards.

588
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:25,520
You know what I'm talking about.

589
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:28,640
You got tons of these things behind firewalls, and I got some apps on Linode.

590
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:29,920
I got some apps on my LAN.

591
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:34,920
I got some apps on a VM sitting on my box back at the studio.

592
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:39,960
Tailscale brings it all together in one flat VPN, and they use WireGuard's noise protocol

593
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:42,080
to make sure it's super secure.

594
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:45,160
And they support any single sign on system you might already have, which means if you

595
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:48,400
want to use two factor, that's going to work too.

596
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:51,260
And personally, I use it to help with my friends and family.

597
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:55,080
Like for example, I have it on my son's computer.

598
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:58,880
If he has any problems while I'm out here, I just SSH into his machine and take care

599
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:05,800
of it because all of my systems have a static IP address on a flat WireGuard protected network

600
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:08,640
that I set up on each machine in like two minutes.

601
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:11,440
It's really nice to have that peace of mind while I'm traveling and just pull that stuff

602
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:14,960
up like I'm sitting on the LAN, regardless of where that machine's at.

603
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:17,000
And I know it's safe with Tailscale.

604
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,100
So go support the show and try it up to 20 devices for free.

605
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:23,760
Get started by going to tailscale.com slash coder.

606
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:26,240
Wouldn't you like to work out in the sunshine?

607
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:28,600
Tailscale can help make that possible.

608
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:33,400
Tailscale.com slash coder.

609
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:39,020
So you got an email this week from Apple saying that reader apps can now add links for account

610
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:40,700
signups outside the app store.

611
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:46,560
So like, for example, Netflix can provide a link that goes directly to the Netflix website

612
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:52,120
for account signups, which means you could sign up using Netflix's payment system, not

613
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:53,920
Apple's payment system.

614
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,640
What the hell is going on?

615
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:59,200
Is it actually that you can process the payment without Apple getting the cut, though?

616
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,660
I didn't think that was right.

617
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:02,360
How can they stop you?

618
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:04,840
Oh, I think you're required to report it.

619
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:06,200
Oh, OK.

620
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,480
I could see that.

621
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:08,480
I could see that.

622
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:11,720
But they have limits on what you're allowed to do, and they would probably check it in

623
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:13,680
app review, wouldn't they?

624
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:22,360
Yeah, I think it's that you can have the signup form be on your website, but you can't actually

625
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:23,360
not pay them.

626
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:25,560
OK, I just found the language.

627
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:31,280
So the external link account entitlement must provide the reader content, must not offer

628
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:36,280
in app purchases, and must not offer real time person to person services.

629
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:37,760
Yeah, OK.

630
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:39,360
I see.

631
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:42,400
So they no wonder why they're letting this happen.

632
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:45,120
So basically, they're letting you link out to your website to read about it and manage

633
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:47,640
your account, maybe, but not pay for things.

634
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:49,440
Yeah, maybe like account.

635
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:50,440
I don't know.

636
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:52,240
Well, no, it says specifically says sign up.

637
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:56,240
So it's not even like, hey, there's something wrong with my account and real time service.

638
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:59,840
Wouldn't that include like something weird is going on with my Netflix account?

639
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:01,480
So you can't even do the chat stuff, right?

640
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:06,740
You can't even do like the help me, Howard, right, like, wow, just literally just filling

641
00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:07,840
up a sign up form.

642
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:12,360
What a fun loophole, you know, or like a set of hoops you just have to jump through.

643
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:16,760
It's weird to me how this got covered because it was in bold, like most of the tech sites,

644
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:17,760
but it's nothing.

645
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:19,300
Yeah, it really is nothing.

646
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:20,360
It's a big nothing burger.

647
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:21,800
I think we should just move on.

648
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:22,800
All right.

649
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:27,700
There's also this story that I just wanted to kind of clarify on a little bit here.

650
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:33,280
This is a situation, but it seems Apple, as well as a few other companies, were essentially

651
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:38,200
socially engineered into providing private customer data.

652
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:40,920
Meta was also targeted in this.

653
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:48,720
And the reason that they were all got is because the cybercrime group used legitimate law enforcement

654
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:54,920
mail addresses, they compromised legitimate mail accounts, and then sent emails from those

655
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:59,980
legitimate accounts asking for the information, domain was legitimate, you know.

656
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:03,280
And if you've only interacted with these, you know, it's a request that comes from the

657
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:04,280
email, right?

658
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:08,760
There's really no way to avoid this kind of stuff unless we get more serious about identity

659
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:13,900
verification with email, or we get more serious about these companies not holding this data.

660
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:15,400
There's just no other way around it.

661
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:17,960
Yeah, at the kind of scale that we have, right?

662
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:20,520
It's just these events keep happening.

663
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:22,520
And they're not interested in having this data.

664
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:23,980
No, of course not.

665
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:27,120
That doesn't behoove them as a services company.

666
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:30,920
And I'm sure if they don't comply quickly enough, they're open all kinds of liability

667
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:32,600
from the government.

668
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:36,080
So Wes, you are 100% remote work?

669
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:37,080
Yes, I am.

670
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:38,560
And is that staying that way?

671
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:39,560
It is, yeah.

672
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:42,240
Well, Eric Schmidt thinks you're an idiot.

673
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:45,960
He says you don't build a great management team virtually.

674
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:50,960
So you're never going to be management material with your work from home shenanigans.

675
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:54,240
He says, this is a quote from the former CEO of Googs.

676
00:28:54,240 --> 00:29:00,160
He says, quote, it's important that these people be at the office, in my view.

677
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:01,160
It may be true.

678
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:02,160
I'm a traditionalist.

679
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:03,160
He adds.

680
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:04,160
Yeah, maybe.

681
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:07,960
But I think he may be right.

682
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:09,600
I almost kind of think he might be right.

683
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:14,920
Like, how do you build a strong team, a leadership team when you're all remote?

684
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:21,220
In fact, isn't the fact that we're all sitting here in this house right now together kind

685
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:25,560
of indicative of that, even though we're all remote, we find it necessary to come together?

686
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:30,320
Well, I think it might just be sort of a spectrum of how often and what that means, right?

687
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:34,240
I mean, his thought, his end of the spectrum is butt in your seat every day.

688
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:35,240
That's his spectrum.

689
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:37,520
Yeah, so it seems like yes, right?

690
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:41,360
Probably especially for highly coordinating individuals who need to have a lot of dense

691
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:46,880
networks across the organization, that kind of face time is important.

692
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:49,800
But there's a lot of different roles in management.

693
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:53,780
And so you may be doing cross department teams, but a lot of your management may just be,

694
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:57,800
you need to be available on those Zoom calls to help the teams that you're helping out.

695
00:29:57,800 --> 00:30:03,500
Mike, Schmidt says it's not just the practicals about working together in person, but sometimes

696
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:06,240
it's about instilling professionalism in your team.

697
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:10,560
Schmidt says that when he started at Google, for example, he, quote, had an awful lot of

698
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:14,460
college students who were behaving as though the workplace was like a college.

699
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:19,680
He goes on to say, quote, and I used to say to them, this is not a college.

700
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:21,080
This is a professional thing.

701
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:22,280
You can't do that.

702
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:24,080
And or it might be illegal.

703
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:25,560
So please stop now.

704
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:30,560
And he says, this is particularly important for your employees that are in the ages of

705
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:32,380
twenty five to thirty five.

706
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:35,800
They just can't be trusted to work from home and not do dumb things.

707
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:38,280
I don't know.

708
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:39,400
I have mixed feelings on this.

709
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:46,840
I am much less bullish on full remote work than I used to be, but I don't know.

710
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:51,320
It seems like one of those things that's nice if you're Google, right, and you have like

711
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:53,400
the awesome offices, lots of money.

712
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:56,920
You pay people super well, way above average.

713
00:30:56,920 --> 00:31:04,280
And I feel like it's almost not a relevant debate for like small businesses because this

714
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:08,440
is an argument that this this is just done right.

715
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:10,540
This is a race that's been run.

716
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:18,160
You basically have to offer remote work now, specifically hiring developers.

717
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:22,540
If you're in anywhere competitive, right, because you know what, it's it's just a super

718
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:24,240
hard hiring market right now.

719
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:27,760
I think we maybe also, you know, as you're saying that, like the size of the business,

720
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:30,920
what you're doing, the type of team you have all seems like it matters.

721
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:31,920
You know, I agree.

722
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:33,880
There are times like right now at the sprint, right?

723
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:34,880
Like we can get a lot done.

724
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:39,840
We have a lot of high bandwidth, but working with the J.B. crew is like they're some of

725
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:42,760
the best people they've ever done like professional work with.

726
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:43,760
We knit really well.

727
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:45,280
We all have similar temperaments.

728
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:47,280
We get along great, right?

729
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:50,760
That is not what I think the normal average experience, right?

730
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:54,320
Like you meet a lot of people in the office, they're fine people, you're not against them,

731
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:55,760
but they're not, they're not your friends.

732
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:58,440
You might not even like have a good vibe with them.

733
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:02,320
And is that like, that's not the same, the magic synergies that all these execs keep

734
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:03,320
talking about.

735
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:07,960
I just don't think like maybe one out of a hundred interactions is like that less.

736
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:13,800
So Schmidt says it's not a big business versus small business thing, which Schmidt says,

737
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:15,760
he says it is science.

738
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:21,400
It is 30 to 40 years of workplace experience that has shown us that humans are inherently

739
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:26,240
social and he goes on to say that the current virtual tools are not the same as informal

740
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:29,560
networks that occur within a corporation or a business.

741
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:33,400
And so if you can't be in person together, you're just not going to be as competitive.

742
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:34,400
Doesn't matter on your size.

743
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:39,720
It doesn't matter if you have 25 employees or 35,000 employees is what he says.

744
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:40,720
It's an interesting theory.

745
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:43,240
I suppose the market's going to validate one way or another, right?

746
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:46,280
Like if you can be more competitive just by having an office.

747
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:50,040
I feel like what Mike is kind of saying in a way, it's like Schmidt sitting in an awful

748
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:52,520
position of privilege, right?

749
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:57,240
Like easy for Schmidt to say he is, you know, they have the ability to fly people in and

750
00:32:57,240 --> 00:33:00,440
move them if they don't work in the area, that kind of stuff.

751
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:05,160
But yeah, for many folks probably they might have, you know, and folks in our audience,

752
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:08,880
they might already have nicer home working setups than they're going to get in an office.

753
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:12,720
I think if you're going to realistically have an office for, you know, highly talented tech

754
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:17,400
people, you're going to have to push towards that, like make the office awesome for lack

755
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:18,560
of a better term.

756
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:21,000
The whole cafeteria thing, the laundry on site.

757
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,360
I'm going to need a hammock desk.

758
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:27,120
Hammock desk, you know, Sousa memorabilia everywhere.

759
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:28,760
It's the stuff you need.

760
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:35,040
When I was at Dell's Austin office, they had several huge cafeterias with great food, but

761
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:38,160
they also had an onsite doctor.

762
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:42,280
So if you wanted to go see a doctor about something, you could go down into the cafeteria

763
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:47,520
area in one of the main buildings there in the main building and see the doctor right

764
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:48,520
there at work.

765
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:52,520
And you know, for a small business guy who doesn't even have medical insurance, that

766
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:56,840
was like such a trip to think like I could go to the, I could go to work and not only

767
00:33:56,840 --> 00:34:01,280
can I do my laundry and do my, get my eating done and you know, eat my three meals or a

768
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:05,600
day or whatever, but I can also see the doctor all on the same campus.

769
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:06,600
It's mind blowing.

770
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:11,940
It's both crazy convenient and also like a weird, you know, it's, it's almost close to

771
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:15,120
being back paid the sort of, you know, company money again.

772
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:17,320
Anyways, we'll wrap it up in there.

773
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:20,200
I'm going to leave a link in the show notes because this is something that I care a lot

774
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:23,140
about, but it's not relevant to the show in any way.

775
00:34:23,140 --> 00:34:25,000
Maybe somebody out there cares though.

776
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:31,520
There is some research that has been published on the 12th and it's, it says that loud road

777
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:35,060
and air traffic has been linked to greater risk of high blood pressure, heart attacks

778
00:34:35,060 --> 00:34:40,480
and strokes and scientists are uncovering new details about how, what you are hearing

779
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:42,680
and how it can stress your cardiovascular system.

780
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:43,680
How about that?

781
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:46,840
So I'm going to leave it on the show notes because that's probably kind of spooky, but

782
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:51,960
I'm a big proponent of thinking about noise pollution when you're building an office or

783
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:53,120
home or something like that.

784
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:55,040
Oh, you don't say professional podcaster.

785
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:56,040
Right.

786
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:57,040
I know.

787
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:58,040
I know.

788
00:34:58,040 --> 00:34:59,040
And I feel like it's something people just ignore.

789
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,600
So I'm advocating for it.

790
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:01,600
Anyways.

791
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:02,600
I think that's it.

792
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,920
Anything else we want to cover gentlemen, before we wrap it up today, Mr. Dominic, is

793
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:06,400
there anything else you want to talk about?

794
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:07,400
No.

795
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:08,680
Good to hear from you again, Wes.

796
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:09,680
Enjoy the work from home.

797
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:10,680
That's a big change.

798
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:11,680
Nice.

799
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:12,680
Indeed.

800
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:13,680
Thank you, sir.

801
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:15,720
And yeah, nice to hear your wonderful voice.

802
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:18,640
Wes and I get on the plane tomorrow and fly back to Seattle.

803
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:20,120
Back to the sky in our fart tube.

804
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:21,120
Yep.

805
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:24,840
Hopefully it's nice and pleasant, although today it's going to be like 80 degrees here.

806
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:26,680
It's a beautiful day here in Raleigh.

807
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:29,960
And then what do we, we maybe talked about doing a LAN the morning after we get back

808
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:31,920
because we're just that crazy.

809
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:32,920
No rest for us.

810
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:36,440
I also have a meeting scheduled for that morning, but it'll be over pretty quick.

811
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:39,280
It's going to be a busy getting back kind of a thing.

812
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:41,760
There's a lot of stuff I got to follow up on.

813
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:45,080
This is one of those trips where I'm coming back with a big list.

814
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:46,320
You hit pause on your life.

815
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:51,000
You go do, you know, to go take care of some things and then, oh yeah, it all got worse.

816
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,480
It's waiting for you to get back.

817
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:56,440
Also thank you to our members, CoderQA.co.

818
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:57,800
New Coderly is coming soon.

819
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:02,360
You also get access to the show's limited ad feed and you support the show.

820
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:04,300
And it's just a great way to do that.

821
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:07,720
You can also support all of the network shows and get access to all of the special features

822
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:09,280
at Jupiter.party.

823
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:12,120
Join the party at Jupiter.party and support them all.

824
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:14,880
Mr. Dominic, where should we send people this week to find you?

825
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:16,980
At Tumanuku on Twitter.

826
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:19,040
He may also be broken down on the side of the road.

827
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:20,040
So look out Floridians.

828
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:21,040
Yes.

829
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:22,040
Yes.

830
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:23,040
Yes.

831
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:24,040
Yeah.

832
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:25,040
That's more likely than not these days.

833
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:29,240
Keep an eye out for Mike's broken down car and say hi, maybe give him a beverage or something

834
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:30,240
like that.

835
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:31,240
What about you Wes?

836
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:32,440
Is there anywhere you want people to find you?

837
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:33,440
Well, yeah.

838
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:36,360
Hey, look out for a new Linux action news in your feed sometime soon.

839
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:37,360
That's right.

840
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:41,840
If we survive back to Seattle, it'll be there, linuxactionnews.com.

841
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:45,200
This year podcast is at Coder Radio Show on Twitter and our contact page.

842
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:46,480
We'd love to get your feedback.

843
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:47,600
