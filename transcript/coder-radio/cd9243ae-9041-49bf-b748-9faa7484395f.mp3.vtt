00:00.000 --> 00:15.720
This is Kota Radio, episode 474, for July 11th, 2022.

00:15.720 --> 00:19.880
Hey good buddy, welcome back to Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show, taking a pragmatic look

00:19.880 --> 00:24.200
at the art and the business of software development and the world of technology.

00:24.200 --> 00:29.200
Here in my perfectly healthy state, I am joined by our host, Mr. Dominic.

00:29.200 --> 00:30.200
Hello Mike.

00:30.200 --> 00:31.200
Hello Chris.

00:31.200 --> 00:32.840
How are you feeling these days?

00:32.840 --> 00:34.560
A little under the weather.

00:34.560 --> 00:39.000
My son's quest to bring home every pathogen possible continues.

00:39.000 --> 00:40.280
He is impressive.

00:40.280 --> 00:44.160
Only outdone because I have three of them, so I have three different vectors.

00:44.160 --> 00:48.720
But for, you know, a standalone agent, he is quite effective, I have to say.

00:48.720 --> 00:49.720
I'm very impressed.

00:49.720 --> 00:55.620
Well, his summer camp has a splash pad, what is otherwise known as a petri dish.

00:55.620 --> 01:00.760
And I think every time they do a splash pad day, they get the, it's like a high hangover,

01:00.760 --> 01:03.000
but like you didn't even get to do the boozing.

01:03.000 --> 01:04.000
You just get the hangover.

01:04.000 --> 01:08.800
Oh, I can imagine, you know, it's covered in wet moisture, right?

01:08.800 --> 01:10.520
It's, and it's hot.

01:10.520 --> 01:11.880
It's warm.

01:11.880 --> 01:15.560
Kids are all touching their faces, fingers in their mouths, running around.

01:15.560 --> 01:21.380
Hey, um, can we just like super quickly remark on the fact that this whole Elon buying Twitter

01:21.380 --> 01:25.840
thing was an absolute nothing burger that people had an absolute panic attack over that

01:25.840 --> 01:27.200
has now turned into nothing.

01:27.200 --> 01:30.920
In fact, Twitter is actually suing Elon trying to make sure the deal goes through because

01:30.920 --> 01:32.320
he's officially pulled out.

01:32.320 --> 01:33.320
Yeah.

01:33.320 --> 01:38.360
So I decided to, uh, apparently if you tweet Elon's name, you will get yelled at by both

01:38.360 --> 01:43.960
crazy like right wing people and basically the PC principal from South Park at the same

01:43.960 --> 01:44.960
time.

01:44.960 --> 01:45.960
Yeah, it's something.

01:45.960 --> 01:47.160
But like nothing happened.

01:47.160 --> 01:52.080
I guess they're assuming to compel him to close on a deal, but how do you force someone

01:52.080 --> 01:53.400
to like run your company?

01:53.400 --> 01:56.820
I know it's, well, we got a contract, but uh, yeah.

01:56.820 --> 02:00.800
Is the court really going to say, no, Mr. Musk, you must buy this $44 billion company.

02:00.800 --> 02:01.800
Yeah.

02:01.800 --> 02:02.800
What are they going to be like?

02:02.800 --> 02:05.800
We're sending a parole officer to drive you to the Twitter offices and install you in

02:05.800 --> 02:06.800
the CEO chair.

02:06.800 --> 02:07.800
Like what?

02:07.800 --> 02:11.080
Don't you think it's actually possible now that it's going to become a court case, there's

02:11.080 --> 02:14.740
going to be some discovery involved and they may actually have to disclose the data they

02:14.740 --> 02:16.640
do have about the bots on their platform.

02:16.640 --> 02:20.940
Yeah, I feel like this discovery is going to be like super embarrassing for everybody

02:20.940 --> 02:21.940
involved.

02:21.940 --> 02:23.680
This just seems like a really bad idea.

02:23.680 --> 02:24.680
So dumb.

02:24.680 --> 02:25.680
Like take the billionaire.

02:25.680 --> 02:27.840
Well, I guess cause the shareholders can sue too, right?

02:27.840 --> 02:31.640
So I guess the board has to sue him, but it's like, I don't know.

02:31.640 --> 02:36.480
I mean like I kind of think he was just drunk or high, like started mouthing off and it

02:36.480 --> 02:37.880
was like, I'm on a buy Twitter.

02:37.880 --> 02:41.980
I think honestly people don't want to accept that somebody worth billions who's in charge

02:41.980 --> 02:47.840
of giant tech companies that's launching satellites and building electric cars can just like want

02:47.840 --> 02:51.280
to buy a company on a Lark and then a few days later not want to buy a company.

02:51.280 --> 02:53.520
Like I don't think people can wrap their heads around it.

02:53.520 --> 02:59.620
They want that person to be like diligent, very intentional, very well planned.

02:59.620 --> 03:04.000
Did you see the conspiracy theory that he was like playing 40 chess to sell his Tesla

03:04.000 --> 03:05.000
stock?

03:05.000 --> 03:06.000
I'm like, I don't know.

03:06.000 --> 03:07.000
I saw the tweets.

03:07.000 --> 03:08.320
I think he was just stoned out of his mind.

03:08.320 --> 03:09.320
Like.

03:09.320 --> 03:10.320
I think that's what it is.

03:10.320 --> 03:12.720
I think he was having a good time.

03:12.720 --> 03:16.560
And when you're a billionaire, 40, you know, 44 bill to blow, you know, you've got to think

03:16.560 --> 03:17.560
you're a certain point.

03:17.560 --> 03:18.640
Like I could fix this.

03:18.640 --> 03:19.640
They just need some good leadership.

03:19.640 --> 03:20.640
I'll get in there.

03:20.640 --> 03:21.640
I'll fix it up.

03:21.640 --> 03:22.640
You know, you could see him thinking that.

03:22.640 --> 03:23.640
Of course.

03:23.640 --> 03:27.640
And in the meantime, he's got having a couple of kids within a week from each other by two

03:27.640 --> 03:29.560
different ladies, which is amazing.

03:29.560 --> 03:31.620
Oh my God.

03:31.620 --> 03:37.360
You know, when I heard that, I just thought the chaos that must exist in that man's life,

03:37.360 --> 03:41.680
all the angry, I'm just going to say all the angry exes managing all of that and balancing

03:41.680 --> 03:42.880
all of that's impossible.

03:42.880 --> 03:44.920
So it's just going to be constant chaos.

03:44.920 --> 03:47.560
He's in a world of chaos that he created for himself.

03:47.560 --> 03:51.400
Like the only thing, and I'm sure you saw, I took interest in her, a guy who's like free

03:51.400 --> 03:53.400
speech, free speech, free speech.

03:53.400 --> 03:56.280
He got pissed off at Scott Galloway and just blocked him.

03:56.280 --> 04:01.040
Well, wait, you're the one who says there should be no like censorship nowhere.

04:01.040 --> 04:02.040
He had this whole little rant.

04:02.040 --> 04:04.200
He wanted to bring Trump back on Twitter.

04:04.200 --> 04:05.600
He wanted to.

04:05.600 --> 04:06.600
What did he say?

04:06.600 --> 04:07.600
He said, let all of it.

04:07.600 --> 04:10.160
It was something like let all let everybody's freak flag fly, basically.

04:10.160 --> 04:13.520
He also wanted to censor that kid understandably, but he wanted to censor that kid that was

04:13.520 --> 04:14.920
tracking his flights.

04:14.920 --> 04:15.920
That's right.

04:15.920 --> 04:17.460
The kid with the I forgot about that.

04:17.460 --> 04:21.440
Did you see the D.M. screenshots leaked where like Elon was considering offering him some

04:21.440 --> 04:24.120
cash and then Elon decides he doesn't want to pay him.

04:24.120 --> 04:25.680
And actually it was in that thread, too.

04:25.680 --> 04:27.240
You can see there's two different Elans.

04:27.240 --> 04:31.760
There's the Elon that comes out first and says, oh, you know, here's 60 K. Stop doing

04:31.760 --> 04:32.760
this.

04:32.760 --> 04:36.360
Kid comes back with how about 300 K and some Bitcoin.

04:36.360 --> 04:39.320
And then Elon changes his mind, decides, actually, I don't want to pay for this.

04:39.320 --> 04:43.320
Yeah, I just can't even imagine like, you know, we've all done it right.

04:43.320 --> 04:48.280
You wake up after a questionable night on the Twitter or, you know, in the I.R.C. or

04:48.280 --> 04:49.280
whatever.

04:49.280 --> 04:50.280
And you go, what did I do?

04:50.280 --> 04:53.680
You know, for Elon, that's got to be every day.

04:53.680 --> 04:54.680
I imagine.

04:54.680 --> 04:59.320
And then all of a sudden we're having some kind of population like 70s style population

04:59.320 --> 05:00.320
crunch.

05:00.320 --> 05:01.320
Yeah, I don't know.

05:01.320 --> 05:04.400
I maybe I actually do think the birth rates are down in the Western world.

05:04.400 --> 05:05.400
I think that is a thing.

05:05.400 --> 05:06.400
I think it is down.

05:06.400 --> 05:09.120
But I don't think the answer is that Elon needs to have another kid every month.

05:09.120 --> 05:11.080
I don't think that's how you solve that problem.

05:11.080 --> 05:15.680
I mean, you think you'd be smart enough to do the math on that one, but and and just

05:15.680 --> 05:21.040
again for a guy who definitely enjoys his pot and booze, we have to just commend his

05:21.040 --> 05:22.040
virility here.

05:22.040 --> 05:26.000
I mean, with that level of crap running through your blood, the man has a high output.

05:26.000 --> 05:27.000
He has a high output.

05:27.000 --> 05:28.000
Yes.

05:28.000 --> 05:29.000
Yes.

05:29.000 --> 05:30.920
A firm dedication, we should say.

05:30.920 --> 05:34.640
And for people that don't think he knows what he's talking about, go check out the Everyday

05:34.640 --> 05:35.640
Not.

05:35.640 --> 05:39.320
There's a few videos now where Elon is walking around the factory and you can tell he just

05:39.320 --> 05:43.840
he has absolutely every aspect of the production of those rockets absolutely figured out.

05:43.840 --> 05:44.840
It's really impressive.

05:44.840 --> 05:48.880
Isn't that the infuriating thing about him, though, like when like when he's doing what

05:48.880 --> 05:51.000
he's supposed to be doing, he's brilliant.

05:51.000 --> 05:52.000
He's on point.

05:52.000 --> 05:56.920
He's I very I believe him that like SpaceX is going to do incredible things.

05:56.920 --> 05:57.920
Yeah.

05:57.920 --> 06:03.520
But then midnight strikes, we roll a fat blood with Joe Rogan and we're we're wacky like.

06:03.520 --> 06:04.520
Yeah.

06:04.520 --> 06:05.520
You're right.

06:05.520 --> 06:06.520
Yeah.

06:06.520 --> 06:09.120
You know, it's too much of the cult of personality.

06:09.120 --> 06:11.800
People pin too much on one person and then you get disappointed.

06:11.800 --> 06:12.800
Yeah.

06:12.800 --> 06:15.720
And he has teams of, you know, brilliant people.

06:15.720 --> 06:18.420
So speaking of fatal flaws, right.

06:18.420 --> 06:22.780
We got some emails that came in this week and I wanted to cover one that came in from

06:22.780 --> 06:24.020
Mark.

06:24.020 --> 06:28.720
He wonders perhaps if Apple has a fatal fly says, Hello, Rob Bros.

06:28.720 --> 06:33.800
According to the geopolitical strategist, Peter Zahan, Apple will be screwed when China

06:33.800 --> 06:38.880
implodes and it will take multiple years to rebuild the supply chain in the Western Hemisphere.

06:38.880 --> 06:40.240
He's got a clip.

06:40.240 --> 06:41.320
It's about four minutes.

06:41.320 --> 06:44.880
If we'll put a link in the show notes to that, he says, What do you think the tech world

06:44.880 --> 06:51.480
will look like in which the next iPhone takes four to five years to release four to five

06:51.480 --> 06:52.480
years?

06:52.480 --> 06:53.480
So.

06:53.480 --> 06:56.760
I guess maybe for the sake of argument, we go with his premise that China is going to

06:56.760 --> 07:00.200
implode and that Apple will not be able to manufacture over there.

07:00.200 --> 07:02.560
I mean, I guess I guess.

07:02.560 --> 07:05.400
It seems like it'd be a slow decline more than just an overnight thing.

07:05.400 --> 07:10.200
Well, and and, you know, I just I forgot the name of the book, but the recent book that

07:10.200 --> 07:16.600
came out about the Tim Cook, Johnny, I have little tenet when they were running Apple

07:16.600 --> 07:18.640
after Steve died in that book.

07:18.640 --> 07:23.020
The author shares that Tim Cook is not only aware of this problem or this possibility

07:23.020 --> 07:25.840
of a problem takes a slightly different tack.

07:25.840 --> 07:28.680
It's not that they think China is going to implode.

07:28.680 --> 07:32.920
Perhaps they think they might get forced in a position of China, ask them to do some stuff

07:32.920 --> 07:37.320
that's just unacceptable to them or would violate the US laws.

07:37.320 --> 07:39.760
So they're they're already like doing things in Vietnam.

07:39.760 --> 07:40.760
Right.

07:40.760 --> 07:41.820
They're they're opening facilities.

07:41.820 --> 07:45.240
But it takes like years to set up these supply chains.

07:45.240 --> 07:50.720
And one of the challenges and even I'm sure Alex will find it for us and why, you know,

07:50.720 --> 07:55.840
you know, America days, you actually don't have the expertise in like member of that.

07:55.840 --> 07:59.040
Was it Ohio or Wisconsin with the Foxconn plant?

07:59.040 --> 08:00.040
Right.

08:00.040 --> 08:01.040
I know what you're talking about.

08:01.040 --> 08:04.240
It's like there's some fundamental skill sets that we just don't even teach anymore.

08:04.240 --> 08:10.080
We don't invest, frankly, in those kind of, you know, technical tradesmen like education

08:10.080 --> 08:14.280
programs as much as, say, China or even a Germany does.

08:14.280 --> 08:19.400
So I don't think the premise is right, that China is going to implode.

08:19.400 --> 08:22.200
But I do think and it's not just Apple, right?

08:22.200 --> 08:26.880
Many of these multinational companies have to start thinking as Beijing, you know, Wolf

08:26.880 --> 08:28.800
Warrior is their way to glory.

08:28.800 --> 08:32.320
You maybe don't want that huge dependency on them because they will just knock on your

08:32.320 --> 08:35.400
door and say, we want what we want.

08:35.400 --> 08:39.460
When you look at a chart of what might be possible in our future and a different degrees

08:39.460 --> 08:44.760
of the way things are going to go in terms of international relationships with China,

08:44.760 --> 08:47.080
it seems to me it's probably ended up somewhere in the middle.

08:47.080 --> 08:51.960
There'll be plenty of manufacturing that stays there potentially, or it'll move to other

08:51.960 --> 08:54.880
countries where the labor is extremely cheap.

08:54.880 --> 08:55.880
We see this even in Mexico.

08:55.880 --> 09:00.040
A lot of car manufacturers now, you know, build their cars in Mexico.

09:00.040 --> 09:04.400
If you look at the spectrum and you say things, let's say things go quite badly, you know,

09:04.400 --> 09:06.520
so we have to start building here on American shores.

09:06.520 --> 09:12.240
I hate to think of the future we would be in if we were down that path.

09:12.240 --> 09:14.240
But in terms of the states, you know, we have a lot of resources.

09:14.240 --> 09:18.160
In fact, there was just a real big lithium mine, I guess they found here in the states.

09:18.160 --> 09:19.480
We have a lot of stuff that we need.

09:19.480 --> 09:21.160
We just don't have the skills.

09:21.160 --> 09:27.080
It's a solvable problem, but it's a very, very expensive problem to solve.

09:27.080 --> 09:31.400
Well, it's also even infinite money can't make that happen fast.

09:31.400 --> 09:33.440
It's a 10 year, 10 year move.

09:33.440 --> 09:35.680
And it's a very inflationary move.

09:35.680 --> 09:36.680
Very inflationary.

09:36.680 --> 09:37.680
Right.

09:37.680 --> 09:38.680
It's going to be very expensive.

09:38.680 --> 09:42.540
But Chris, when we're finally paying $20 a gallon for gas, which I think is a comrade

09:42.540 --> 09:45.760
Biden's goal, we could all buy a Tesla.

09:45.760 --> 09:46.760
But I think you're right.

09:46.760 --> 09:48.840
You know, Cook's already all over this.

09:48.840 --> 09:50.740
I mean, he's a supply chain guy.

09:50.740 --> 09:54.220
He's if you look at the companies that have been impacted by the supply chain, the top

09:54.220 --> 09:59.360
tier hardware OEMs like HP and Apple and Dell done really well.

09:59.360 --> 10:02.120
They've they've managed this pretty well.

10:02.120 --> 10:03.160
Let's see if we can help James.

10:03.160 --> 10:07.560
He's in search of a tool is, hey, guys, a while back you were kind of complaining about

10:07.560 --> 10:09.600
businesses that run on Xceler access.

10:09.600 --> 10:11.560
I think we touched a nerve.

10:11.560 --> 10:15.400
He goes on to say the implication being that they should have their own custom line of

10:15.400 --> 10:17.040
business application.

10:17.040 --> 10:19.000
I'm a one man specialist repair business.

10:19.000 --> 10:23.520
My requirements don't seem to be in line with any of the CRM or line of business application

10:23.520 --> 10:26.540
or Web apps out there that I've come across.

10:26.540 --> 10:30.360
They have all kind of something that I need, but don't really fit properly and would just

10:30.360 --> 10:31.360
get in the way.

10:31.360 --> 10:35.560
Mostly in a previous life, I was a PHP front end Web developer.

10:35.560 --> 10:40.600
I could knock together a custom application to suit my business needs, but my cost and

10:40.600 --> 10:42.600
time would be huge.

10:42.600 --> 10:47.320
At the moment, I have built a fairly complex Google sheet system that does everything I

10:47.320 --> 10:51.840
need and it's been a great way to prototype data structures and try out different ideas.

10:51.840 --> 10:54.960
I definitely plan to move to a more stable platform, though.

10:54.960 --> 10:58.280
Do you have any suggestions of frameworks or anything else that essentially let me build

10:58.280 --> 11:01.840
a GUI for a MySQL database back end?

11:01.840 --> 11:05.080
He wants like his access, but with his MySQL back end.

11:05.080 --> 11:12.120
Jeez, I feel like I've gotten this question in real life a hundred different ways.

11:12.120 --> 11:16.960
And I hate that I have to say to James, it's like a big old it depends.

11:16.960 --> 11:19.400
I don't like the idea of him building a front end.

11:19.400 --> 11:22.720
To be honest with you, I don't know why, but that just doesn't seem like where James should

11:22.720 --> 11:23.720
be spending his time.

11:23.720 --> 11:29.200
If I were just coming in cold and I was consulting with James on day one, I may change my mind

11:29.200 --> 11:32.040
on day two, but on day one, I'd say don't build it.

11:32.040 --> 11:36.720
Yeah, I'm not even sure what tool would even fit that bill, even if you decided to build

11:36.720 --> 11:37.720
it.

11:37.720 --> 11:43.640
I mean, there's all these weird little like enterprise data visualization tools, but I've

11:43.640 --> 11:47.760
never found one that wasn't basically terrible.

11:47.760 --> 11:53.120
Yeah, I almost wonder if that's what he needs is like something that generates reports.

11:53.120 --> 11:55.400
Maybe somebody out there has a suggestion they could send us.

11:55.400 --> 12:00.200
Wes just shared MetaBase, MetaBase.com to us as a possible tool for James.

12:00.200 --> 12:01.200
I'm not familiar with it.

12:01.200 --> 12:02.200
Hey, thank you, Wes.

12:02.200 --> 12:03.200
MetaBase.

12:03.200 --> 12:04.200
MetaBase.

12:04.200 --> 12:05.880
Check it out.

12:05.880 --> 12:07.840
Maybe there's something great in there.

12:07.840 --> 12:11.120
Scott wrote in, he said he'd had enough of us talking about VS code.

12:11.120 --> 12:15.920
He wanted us to at least take a moment to mention VS Codium and remember that it is

12:15.920 --> 12:20.320
a thing, which then Chris promptly wondered why it's a thing, but it is a thing just like

12:20.320 --> 12:21.420
Chromium is a thing.

12:21.420 --> 12:23.240
There is VS Codium.

12:23.240 --> 12:26.560
It takes out some of the telemetry is I think the big difference.

12:26.560 --> 12:27.560
I don't know, though.

12:27.560 --> 12:33.680
I have to tell you, as somebody who doesn't use the Windows platform and is almost always

12:33.680 --> 12:40.360
on the Linux platform, I feel like telemetry represents a niche user that needs representation

12:40.360 --> 12:41.760
in these companies.

12:41.760 --> 12:46.080
I actually turn telemetry on because I want them to see that a Linux user is out there.

12:46.080 --> 12:51.880
Yeah, that's kind of the golden silver lining, whatever, of Microsoft's creepy stuff is they

12:51.880 --> 12:57.760
get enough people installing VS code or using a Clippy for code whose name I can't remember

12:57.760 --> 13:01.460
from GitHub on Linux, they might actually support it more.

13:01.460 --> 13:05.840
But I totally understand that not everybody has that opinion, and they feel like Microsoft

13:05.840 --> 13:07.920
can go F themselves.

13:07.920 --> 13:12.760
I, however, have just decided I'm actually going to submit that metric.

13:12.760 --> 13:14.920
You know, they probably have so much other data on me anyway.

13:14.920 --> 13:15.920
They don't care, right?

13:15.920 --> 13:19.400
Every time you log into Xbox, they're like, ha ha, they got me the moment I had to buy

13:19.400 --> 13:21.440
Minecraft for my kids, right?

13:21.440 --> 13:23.920
I was like, there's no going out on that.

13:23.920 --> 13:24.920
They got me.

13:24.920 --> 13:28.680
And for those of you who don't have kids, this is not a I wanted to or my kid wanted

13:28.680 --> 13:29.680
to.

13:29.680 --> 13:30.680
This is a must.

13:30.680 --> 13:32.640
This is you will buy Minecraft or you will suffer.

13:32.640 --> 13:33.640
Yeah.

13:33.640 --> 13:36.240
And it's, you know, as far as games go, it seems like a pretty good one.

13:36.240 --> 13:38.440
Hey, guess what?

13:38.440 --> 13:39.920
Guess what?

13:39.920 --> 13:45.960
I got something really special coming up in September on the 29th.

13:45.960 --> 13:54.360
We are getting a very special but limited tour of NASA's Jet Propulsion Lab.

13:54.360 --> 14:01.640
From individuals that are friends of Linux Unplugged, Tim Kanima is a friend of the show

14:01.640 --> 14:07.160
and was involved with the I think he's like the operation lead for the helicopter that's

14:07.160 --> 14:09.520
in the new Mars Rover.

14:09.520 --> 14:13.860
And was a key player in getting JPL to adopt Linux as well.

14:13.860 --> 14:21.520
And so he's extended a special tour to 20 JB listeners in the area in Southern California.

14:21.520 --> 14:27.200
We don't have a meetup page yet because we're trying to also put together a broader meetup

14:27.200 --> 14:30.880
because Linode is sending us on another road trip.

14:30.880 --> 14:35.000
We're doing it around this event to JPL, so we're going to do meetups up and down the

14:35.000 --> 14:36.000
West Coast.

14:36.000 --> 14:39.440
But we need to get an idea of where people are at so we can plan our route and try to

14:39.440 --> 14:43.240
be the most efficient with fuel that we can because it's just a ridiculous time to go

14:43.240 --> 14:44.680
on a road trip.

14:44.680 --> 14:49.080
And so I have created a West Coast crew matrix room.

14:49.080 --> 14:51.600
And I'd like you to pop in there if you're in the West Coast and you think we could have

14:51.600 --> 14:54.640
a meetup in your area, maybe have a suggestion of where we could hold the meetup or where

14:54.640 --> 14:56.520
I could park Lady Joops.

14:56.520 --> 15:02.640
It's bit.ly slash West Coast crew and I will put a link to that in the show notes too.

15:02.640 --> 15:06.000
It's bit.ly slash West Coast crew.

15:06.000 --> 15:08.960
You jump in that matrix room, you just give me some signal and then pretty soon I'll start

15:08.960 --> 15:11.320
putting up a route that we're going to take and whatnot.

15:11.320 --> 15:15.280
You can also boost into the shows and let me know if you're in the West Coast somewhere

15:15.280 --> 15:19.680
between Washington, Idaho, Oregon, California area.

15:19.680 --> 15:20.940
Let me know.

15:20.940 --> 15:22.860
And guess what?

15:22.860 --> 15:24.200
I created you a matrix account.

15:24.200 --> 15:25.600
I'm in the matrix?

15:25.600 --> 15:26.600
You are in the matrix now.

15:26.600 --> 15:27.600
I'll get you the credentials.

15:27.600 --> 15:29.360
But yeah, I've created you a matrix account.

15:29.360 --> 15:33.720
So wait, is it like green and black and has like those weird symbols flying by?

15:33.720 --> 15:34.720
It depends.

15:34.720 --> 15:37.000
Well, I'm going to have to sit you down.

15:37.000 --> 15:40.040
There's going to be like a couple of pills you got to pick from and then like some mirror

15:40.040 --> 15:43.280
stuff you got to play around with, but depending on which way you go.

15:43.280 --> 15:48.040
Let me just get some Hendrix first and the mirror stuff will happen anyway.

15:48.040 --> 15:49.040
All right.

15:49.040 --> 15:51.120
So I don't think you're going to be at the West Coast meetup.

15:51.120 --> 15:52.120
I don't think that's happening.

15:52.120 --> 15:57.200
You know, we'll create a guerrilla East Coast meetup room just to have like a rap thing

15:57.200 --> 15:58.200
going, you know.

15:58.200 --> 15:59.200
Totally.

15:59.200 --> 16:02.000
You know, Brent's going to be in Raleigh for about a month coming up, and I think he's

16:02.000 --> 16:04.440
going to do some micro meetups in the Raleigh area.

16:04.440 --> 16:07.640
It's a little far for you to go for a small one, but who knows?

16:07.640 --> 16:09.720
I might never know what happens.

16:09.720 --> 16:10.720
Food's good up there.

16:10.720 --> 16:11.720
The food's good.

16:11.720 --> 16:12.720
Oh, barbecue.

16:12.720 --> 16:13.720
Carolina barbecue.

16:13.720 --> 16:17.640
Don't even don't even tempt me.

16:17.640 --> 16:23.320
Linode.com slash coder, go there to get $100 in 60 day credit on a new account and you

16:23.320 --> 16:26.720
go there to show your support for this here show.

16:26.720 --> 16:30.280
So it's Linode.com slash coder.

16:30.280 --> 16:34.080
Linode is the developer's cloud with 11 data centers worldwide, and they've been hard at

16:34.080 --> 16:38.840
work for nearly 19 years, creating the absolute best experience for you to run your applications

16:38.840 --> 16:39.840
on.

16:39.840 --> 16:43.560
If you've got massive back end infrastructure that you need to deploy or just a system for

16:43.560 --> 16:46.840
you and your friends, Linode has something for you.

16:46.840 --> 16:49.520
Clouds rolling out, screaming fast new MVME storage.

16:49.520 --> 16:52.320
They've been really upgrading everything since I've been a customer for the last two and

16:52.320 --> 16:56.020
a half years, just continually iterating on the experience.

16:56.020 --> 16:59.680
And that's probably why I like them so much, because just as I'm kind of ready to kind

16:59.680 --> 17:01.800
of take things to the next level, they've got a service for me.

17:01.800 --> 17:06.040
Like I'm just thinking of right now, I had a managed database service and initially it

17:06.040 --> 17:10.520
didn't support Postgres, but they just recently added Postgres support and it's like, OK,

17:10.520 --> 17:11.520
let's go.

17:11.520 --> 17:12.520
I got a few applications.

17:12.520 --> 17:13.520
I'm ready to move over.

17:13.520 --> 17:18.360
Also, we were just doing a massive late night rebuild of one of our aspects of our matrix

17:18.360 --> 17:22.160
service, just one of those things that we should have taken care of a long time ago.

17:22.160 --> 17:25.520
And it was so nice to be able to go into Linode and just say, you know what, a little more

17:25.520 --> 17:26.720
disk storage, please.

17:26.720 --> 17:29.520
Let's resize this disk a little bit bigger.

17:29.520 --> 17:32.080
I've got to go through and clean some stuff up.

17:32.080 --> 17:33.880
Let's just get ourselves a little bit of breathing room.

17:33.880 --> 17:37.520
And just having that kind of flexibility in the Linode dashboard is so nice.

17:37.520 --> 17:40.580
So go take advantage of that hundred dollar offer and see what I'm talking about.

17:40.580 --> 17:45.320
Go play around with their cloud firewalls, their S3 compatible object storage.

17:45.320 --> 17:46.320
There's a lot there.

17:46.320 --> 17:49.880
And with pricing 30 to 50 percent cheaper than other major cloud providers, well, there's

17:49.880 --> 17:51.200
nothing you're not going to love.

17:51.200 --> 17:52.820
And the support, it's real.

17:52.820 --> 17:54.920
It's actually humans are going to help you 24 seven.

17:54.920 --> 17:58.200
They're not going to keep bumping you through some sort of weird tiered system.

17:58.200 --> 18:01.400
You know, there's like a thousand people in that help desk area or something like that.

18:01.400 --> 18:02.400
It's wild.

18:02.400 --> 18:04.520
I can't even believe the hypervisors get away with it.

18:04.520 --> 18:08.000
It's one of the ways Linode really tries to differentiate.

18:08.000 --> 18:09.480
So go check them out.

18:09.480 --> 18:10.480
Support the show.

18:10.480 --> 18:11.480
Learn something.

18:11.480 --> 18:13.640
Go learn something and get that hundred bucks.

18:13.640 --> 18:15.720
Linode dot com slash coder.

18:15.720 --> 18:20.800
That's Linode dot com slash coder.

18:20.800 --> 18:24.540
Well, the Software Freedom Conservancy has picked up where Richard Stallman left off

18:24.540 --> 18:29.720
and has launched tax against Microsoft, several of them, one for Copilot.

18:29.720 --> 18:34.320
They have a big issue with Copilot and they put out a campaign for people to leave GitHub.

18:34.320 --> 18:35.600
They've set up a website.

18:35.600 --> 18:39.840
They want people to leave GitHub, maybe use GitLab, something else.

18:39.840 --> 18:44.940
But they're also taking Microsoft to task this week for banning the sale of open source

18:44.940 --> 18:47.880
applications from the Windows App Store.

18:47.880 --> 18:54.240
A couple of weeks ago, Microsoft quietly updated their App Store policies, adding a new policy

18:54.240 --> 18:58.520
that makes it impossible for open source or other software that is otherwise generally

18:58.520 --> 19:03.240
available for free, meaning in price, not freedom, to be sold.

19:03.240 --> 19:06.000
Apparently they made the change on July 16th.

19:06.000 --> 19:09.960
Even the new rule, once it was discovered, drew criticism from developers because some

19:09.960 --> 19:14.880
free software developers were using the sales in the Windows Store to help raise funds for

19:14.880 --> 19:18.040
their open source project.

19:18.040 --> 19:19.240
Can you guess what's going on here?

19:19.240 --> 19:21.160
Can you kind of see where this is going?

19:21.160 --> 19:22.160
I didn't get this.

19:22.160 --> 19:26.280
I don't see why that's evil because I'm pretty sure there were probably some jerks like uploading

19:26.280 --> 19:30.920
to other people's open source projects, maybe with slight malware modifications even and

19:30.920 --> 19:32.800
trying to sell them.

19:32.800 --> 19:35.440
That is exactly what was happening.

19:35.440 --> 19:39.800
It's understandable and, of course, it's also kind of understandable how Microsoft just

19:39.800 --> 19:44.200
took this ham-fisted approach, all right, we're just going to ban this, right, took

19:44.200 --> 19:46.560
the Apple approach, this is out.

19:46.560 --> 19:52.760
And then, of course, once they heard the protests, they did respond and they modified the policy

19:52.760 --> 19:53.760
now.

19:53.760 --> 19:56.600
And they're making adjustments to the policy to make it possible for the actual developers

19:56.600 --> 19:57.800
to sell their own software.

19:57.800 --> 20:02.080
Yeah, I feel like this is actually Microsoft behaving in a super reasonable way.

20:02.080 --> 20:09.880
I mean, so this is why I think it is a little embarrassing that the Software Freedom Conservancy

20:09.880 --> 20:12.160
is making such a big production out of this.

20:12.160 --> 20:16.600
It reminds me of sort of the chick behavior from the Free Software Foundation that was

20:16.600 --> 20:22.080
like pissing into the wind and just doing silly protests to like raise awareness.

20:22.080 --> 20:27.780
And it, in my eyes, delegitimized the Free Software Foundation in the broader tech community.

20:27.780 --> 20:32.240
And then, inevitably, it began to delegitimize it to some in the free software community,

20:32.240 --> 20:33.440
not all.

20:33.440 --> 20:37.040
And now it feels like we're seeing that exact thing happen now with the Software Freedom

20:37.040 --> 20:38.540
Conservancy.

20:38.540 --> 20:43.520
They're taking small things and exaggerating them to make them sound like much bigger issues.

20:43.520 --> 20:51.820
While still raising valid questions, the manner in which it's being done is a little disingenuous,

20:51.820 --> 20:53.400
in my opinion.

20:53.400 --> 20:57.020
And I kind of hate to see it go this way because the Conservancy was kind of like the professionals

20:57.020 --> 20:58.020
in the room here.

20:58.020 --> 21:02.960
They were taking projects under their umbrella, giving them legal guidance, working with companies

21:02.960 --> 21:08.840
that needed to be worked with to get in support of GPL, and something has shifted here.

21:08.840 --> 21:14.560
It's kind of the last thing the free software community needed was for another one of these

21:14.560 --> 21:18.520
advocacy institutions of theirs to start to lose legitimacy.

21:18.520 --> 21:22.760
Even if, let's say, like the campaign to get people to move off of GitHub was a good one.

21:22.760 --> 21:25.760
And one of their chief concerns is Copilot.

21:25.760 --> 21:29.620
And one of their other chief concerns is, well, SourceForge eventually went to shit.

21:29.620 --> 21:31.320
So inevitably GitHub's going to go to shit.

21:31.320 --> 21:34.320
So we've got to get off of GitHub before it turns into SourceForge.

21:34.320 --> 21:37.080
That's like their second or first reason.

21:37.080 --> 21:38.240
But let's give it to them.

21:38.240 --> 21:39.240
Let's say they're right.

21:39.240 --> 21:42.640
And let's say Microsoft is going to make it worse and worse over time.

21:42.640 --> 21:47.200
It's kind of like the idea that I, as an individual, could go up against the US military.

21:47.200 --> 21:55.040
It's like my teeny tiny, maybe, handgun against their military jets and drones and forces.

21:55.040 --> 22:00.880
The Software Freedom Conservancy going up against GitHub adoption is going up against

22:00.880 --> 22:04.280
a natural tidal wave of user momentum.

22:04.280 --> 22:08.440
It's literally pissing into a tidal wave of user adoption.

22:08.440 --> 22:12.080
It is, unfortunately, a complete waste of resources.

22:12.080 --> 22:14.600
And I don't mean to be nihilistic about it.

22:14.600 --> 22:19.600
But the reality is we all only have so much time and energy and influence.

22:19.600 --> 22:24.520
Why not measure twice, cut once, and exert your influence in areas where you can actually

22:24.520 --> 22:25.560
make a difference?

22:25.560 --> 22:27.800
And instead, they've kind of just doubled down on this.

22:27.800 --> 22:31.640
And in this last week, they've kind of just gone absurd with both the abandoned GitHub

22:31.640 --> 22:37.040
stuff and now with the Microsoft as attacking open source applications in the Windows Store.

22:37.040 --> 22:41.760
As if the Windows Store makes these developers any actual money to begin with, right?

22:41.760 --> 22:44.000
I mean, it's just the whole thing is ludicrous.

22:44.000 --> 22:50.680
I do feel, though, that they have a little firmer footing when they talk about Copilot.

22:50.680 --> 22:52.640
Because there's some fishy.

22:52.640 --> 22:54.680
I'm still using it.

22:54.680 --> 22:58.680
But there's definitely been some cases where it's suggested things that I'm sure it just

22:58.680 --> 23:09.160
ripped off somebody's GitHub, because the variable names seem very idiosyncratic.

23:09.160 --> 23:10.160
But I'm not even sure.

23:10.160 --> 23:14.920
Because then are we just going to say that, well, any innovation on the development assistance

23:14.920 --> 23:18.280
is bad because it might violate licenses?

23:18.280 --> 23:19.280
I don't know.

23:19.280 --> 23:21.400
I feel like that's kind of a ludic perspective.

23:21.400 --> 23:24.200
The nuance there is the derived work, right?

23:24.200 --> 23:30.400
Because these licenses, these free software licenses, have specific clauses about derived

23:30.400 --> 23:31.400
work.

23:31.400 --> 23:35.640
And Copilot is clearly producing derived work, right?

23:35.640 --> 23:39.240
It seems like that connection is real close.

23:39.240 --> 23:41.160
It's one line.

23:41.160 --> 23:44.080
So I think that's where the perhaps that's where the issue is.

23:44.080 --> 23:50.360
But I could totally see them focusing on the Copilot issues, focusing on abandoning GitHub

23:50.360 --> 23:54.880
and attacking Microsoft over the Windows app store that no one uses.

23:54.880 --> 23:58.240
It just feels, again, like the silly stuff that the Free Software Foundation was doing

23:58.240 --> 23:59.240
years ago.

23:59.240 --> 24:01.680
Now, we haven't heard anything from them for years.

24:01.680 --> 24:03.640
And maybe people are just a little wired.

24:03.640 --> 24:05.000
Maybe they're a little worked up.

24:05.000 --> 24:07.120
Maybe they're a little fired up.

24:07.120 --> 24:12.660
Because it came out that Lenart Patering, the creator of Pulse Audio and System D and

24:12.660 --> 24:15.720
several other things, has been hired by Microsoft.

24:15.720 --> 24:22.600
He quietly left Red Hat earlier this year on the DL and ended up at Microsoft.

24:22.600 --> 24:23.680
And we don't really know what he's doing.

24:23.680 --> 24:27.400
But it seems he's still working on System D. So there's that.

24:27.400 --> 24:31.880
Microsoft's like, we will hire every open source maintainer that we can find.

24:31.880 --> 24:35.120
I wanted to just put some perspective on this.

24:35.120 --> 24:40.200
Because I don't know how I even might have been might have been Alex on Twitter that

24:40.200 --> 24:43.280
sent this in or I came across it accidentally.

24:43.280 --> 24:44.280
I found a clip of us.

24:44.280 --> 24:50.080
It must have been from Alex, talking about Lenart in 2014 during all the System D debate

24:50.080 --> 24:51.080
stuff.

24:51.080 --> 24:52.640
And this is you and I in 2014.

24:52.640 --> 24:56.000
So you're going to have to I apologize how ridiculous it sounds.

24:56.000 --> 24:59.720
And I am reading a quote from Lenart Patering in the show.

24:59.720 --> 25:02.120
And I just wanted to play this moment for you from 2014.

25:02.120 --> 25:04.760
He says, I don't usually talk about this very much.

25:04.760 --> 25:07.280
And hence, I figure that people really are not aware of this.

25:07.280 --> 25:10.500
But yes, the open source community is full of assholes.

25:10.500 --> 25:16.080
And I probably, and I probably more than others, am one of their most favorite targets.

25:16.080 --> 25:18.420
I get mail for hacking on open source.

25:18.420 --> 25:20.160
I get hate mail for it.

25:20.160 --> 25:24.920
People have started and stated multiple times petitions on different websites asking me

25:24.920 --> 25:26.600
to stop working on open source code.

25:26.600 --> 25:28.240
You can go Google for it.

25:28.240 --> 25:32.560
Recently, people started collecting bitcoins to hire for a hitman for me.

25:32.560 --> 25:34.640
Yes, this really happened.

25:34.640 --> 25:40.080
Just the other day, some idiot posted a song on YouTube, a creepy work filled with expletives

25:40.080 --> 25:43.400
about me and suggestions of violence.

25:43.400 --> 25:47.640
People post messages and references to artwork in 4chan style.

25:47.640 --> 25:51.260
And there's more, a lot more.

25:51.260 --> 25:56.080
So he talks about how essentially he gets a lot of hate for flipping bits on a hard

25:56.080 --> 25:57.080
drive.

25:57.080 --> 25:58.080
It seems a little out of perspective.

25:58.080 --> 26:01.920
Yeah, to put it mildly, I forgot that he was getting death threats.

26:01.920 --> 26:04.200
Oof, that is rough.

26:04.200 --> 26:08.040
I think I had an interview with him in 2014 or 2015 as well.

26:08.040 --> 26:09.800
And I really respected his intelligence.

26:09.800 --> 26:13.840
I could tell by my interactions with him that he was an extremely bright individual.

26:13.840 --> 26:17.080
And I guess, you know, back then people were a little more radical in the Linux space.

26:17.080 --> 26:22.280
I can't really see that happening today, people raising funds to hire a hitman for somebody

26:22.280 --> 26:24.140
developing something in Linux.

26:24.140 --> 26:26.400
Certainly not in Bitcoin at least.

26:26.400 --> 26:31.360
Yeah, especially these days, let's be honest, you should be using Monero.

26:31.360 --> 26:37.600
But I guess I don't really have any thoughts on him at Microsoft other than I have this

26:37.600 --> 26:45.960
creeping concern about centralization of free software talent in particular around Microsoft.

26:45.960 --> 26:50.120
And I've been having this concern for a couple of years.

26:50.120 --> 26:53.120
And the concern is just getting stronger and stronger.

26:53.120 --> 26:55.440
And I don't think there's anything we can do about it.

26:55.440 --> 27:01.120
But I worry that in a few years, we'll look back and realize that we kind of have been

27:01.120 --> 27:05.400
led into a path where Microsoft has become dominant in the free software community and

27:05.400 --> 27:09.900
the open source tool development, and maybe we're already there.

27:09.900 --> 27:13.440
And I don't know if you've even reflected on it, we just sort of naturally slid into

27:13.440 --> 27:14.440
it.

27:14.440 --> 27:15.920
I mean, what would the alternative be then?

27:15.920 --> 27:22.520
Well, if I were really to go deep, imagine a world where we haven't been living in an

27:22.520 --> 27:25.920
environment of money printing since 2008, right?

27:25.920 --> 27:32.220
So there hasn't been this massive growth in the tech industry and this ginormous consolidation.

27:32.220 --> 27:38.280
And because that money has poured into assets first, and stocks in particular, big tech

27:38.280 --> 27:43.860
companies like Apple and Microsoft and Google and Amazon have really benefited immensely.

27:43.860 --> 27:47.120
And it has given them incredible economic power.

27:47.120 --> 27:50.880
And so they have just gone around and gobbled up every small little company for like for

27:50.880 --> 27:54.960
Apple, you know, like PI semiconductor that worked out really great, right?

27:54.960 --> 27:58.920
There's a few acquisitions that have been solid for these companies.

27:58.920 --> 28:03.840
You got to wonder though, man, like, if the money printer hadn't been going burr, and

28:03.840 --> 28:09.560
these tech companies hadn't just been absorbing from the spigot, maybe we'd have thousands

28:09.560 --> 28:11.920
of small little tech companies.

28:11.920 --> 28:15.680
And maybe we'd have a lot more dispersed and decentralized talent.

28:15.680 --> 28:23.320
Maybe we'd have a lot of small, you know, I like medium sized 500 less tech companies

28:23.320 --> 28:27.780
that are building products that weren't just getting absorbed by Google, Apple and Microsoft

28:27.780 --> 28:32.120
over the last decade, and Amazon, of course, and Facebook, of course, but then sun would

28:32.120 --> 28:35.000
be alive, and we'd all be happy.

28:35.000 --> 28:38.860
And we can't be happy, Chris, we do just that's not in the cards.

28:38.860 --> 28:44.280
And also the money printing is, it's actually really prescient for you to make that the

28:44.280 --> 28:49.800
point because think about like, did you I forgot who published it, but there was the

28:49.800 --> 28:53.940
study on like how much money Uber loses.

28:53.940 --> 28:59.040
And it's just insane, like, effectively, the federal the federal government was subsidizing

28:59.040 --> 29:03.520
drunk people getting rides back from the bar, because those Uber rides just just cost a

29:03.520 --> 29:04.520
lot more money.

29:04.520 --> 29:05.520
Right?

29:05.520 --> 29:07.280
They never got to a point where it's making money now.

29:07.280 --> 29:09.240
They make I think they make money on the food part.

29:09.240 --> 29:10.240
Now.

29:10.240 --> 29:11.400
I think that's actually easier business for them.

29:11.400 --> 29:13.040
I bet man, the fees there are ridiculous.

29:13.040 --> 29:17.320
Well, and they charge the restaurant to Yeah, they get they get they charge everybody.

29:17.320 --> 29:24.320
But it's, it's just crazy, like all this capital was can't even say, basically, it was just

29:24.320 --> 29:29.240
like somebody waved a wand, right and just created it out of whole cloth.

29:29.240 --> 29:35.300
And it was allocated in some pretty crazy ways, like and and our bridges are still rusted

29:35.300 --> 29:39.320
and falling down.

29:39.320 --> 29:43.720
Hail scale.com slash coder go there to get a free personal account for up to 20 devices

29:43.720 --> 29:45.220
and support the show.

29:45.220 --> 29:50.000
scale scale is a zero config VPN, you'll get it installed on your device in minutes.

29:50.000 --> 29:51.460
It'll take care of firewall rules.

29:51.460 --> 29:57.240
It takes care of double carrier grade NAT, it just manages all of that elegantly devices

29:57.240 --> 30:01.540
connect directly to each other using wire guards noise protocol.

30:01.540 --> 30:08.740
It builds you a flat mesh network with the absolutely best VPN technology in the business.

30:08.740 --> 30:10.800
Your devices are connected directly to each other.

30:10.800 --> 30:12.260
They get static addresses.

30:12.260 --> 30:13.320
I love this.

30:13.320 --> 30:18.060
I have a bookmark folder, yes, bookmarks in my browser, where I just now have all the

30:18.060 --> 30:22.680
tail scale IPS of all of the web dashboards and services that I use across my various

30:22.680 --> 30:23.680
devices.

30:23.680 --> 30:28.160
You can quickly and easily create a secure network between your servers, your computers,

30:28.160 --> 30:30.960
your cloud instances, your virtual machines.

30:30.960 --> 30:34.680
When you start thinking about the way you could bring different networks together.

30:34.680 --> 30:35.960
It's a game changer.

30:35.960 --> 30:39.480
It meant that I could have VMs here at the studio where I had a build environment or

30:39.480 --> 30:44.220
a test environment and I could SSH into it from home and keep working on it and get things

30:44.220 --> 30:46.720
going or keep things running.

30:46.720 --> 30:47.720
It's so great.

30:47.720 --> 30:52.120
Even when separated by firewalls or subnets, tail scale just works.

30:52.120 --> 30:54.880
I've now started installing it on friends and families computers too.

30:54.880 --> 31:00.060
One of the very first like aha moments I had was when I was setting up my son's laptop

31:00.060 --> 31:05.360
and I realized I could put tail scale on here and then I can help him when he's at school

31:05.360 --> 31:08.160
or when he's with his mom and I'm not there.

31:08.160 --> 31:11.760
It was just a real aha moment to be able to kind of get access to that machine when I

31:11.760 --> 31:12.760
need to.

31:12.760 --> 31:13.760
It's all just on my network.

31:13.760 --> 31:18.320
Like I've created my own flat network, just my own private layer.

31:18.320 --> 31:22.220
It's really great and you can get started in just minutes.

31:22.220 --> 31:25.960
If you've got five devices, it'll probably take you a minute a device and they all get

31:25.960 --> 31:31.160
set up and it's just beautifully, beautifully connected and if you've got a business that

31:31.160 --> 31:35.840
uses like a single sign on authority, maybe you've got two factor authentication as well.

31:35.840 --> 31:39.200
Tail scale supports that so you can take your security up to the next level with that as

31:39.200 --> 31:40.200
well.

31:40.200 --> 31:43.560
They've got abilities to jump out onto a network too if you want to open that up or you can

31:43.560 --> 31:46.120
share a machine with one other person.

31:46.120 --> 31:49.820
My buddy Alex from Self Hosted and I, we have one machine that we have shared between us

31:49.820 --> 31:51.480
for self hosted testing.

31:51.480 --> 31:55.840
His machine shows up on my tail scale network as just like one of my devices and he controls

31:55.840 --> 31:57.040
that access.

31:57.040 --> 31:58.040
So great.

31:58.040 --> 32:03.720
When you start working with this stuff, it'll start changing the way you work for the better

32:03.720 --> 32:06.280
and you can layer it on just as you need.

32:06.280 --> 32:12.320
I started kind of just simple with tail scale and now I've built new ways of working and

32:12.320 --> 32:14.360
you can try it for free up to 20 devices.

32:14.360 --> 32:17.280

Support the show and get it for free for 20 devices at tailscale.com slash coder.

32:26.120 --> 32:27.440
Well you're going to love this.

32:27.440 --> 32:33.920
It's already taken off in Asia and now it's coming to the US and parts of Europe, a third

32:33.920 --> 32:41.200
party lock screen platform, oh come on, a lock screen platform which is already pre

32:41.200 --> 32:44.000
installed on many Android devices.

32:44.000 --> 32:47.720
It just hasn't been activated in the EU but it's coming to US as well.

32:47.720 --> 32:54.240
And what it is, is it is a way for the OEM or the carrier depending on who installs it

32:54.240 --> 33:00.900
to monetize the lock screen and to show you ads with an app called Glance.

33:00.900 --> 33:05.760
And the company is negotiating with US carriers to lock in a few partnerships to become the

33:05.760 --> 33:12.160
quote out of the box experience of several smartphone models by next month.

33:12.160 --> 33:13.160
That's their goal.

33:13.160 --> 33:20.720
We have so much energy and ability to do horrible things to every surface that we ever see.

33:20.720 --> 33:23.280
Yet we still can't scroll as good as iOS.

33:23.280 --> 33:26.360
It's just, why?

33:26.360 --> 33:30.440
And by the way, the carriers get to put them on?

33:30.440 --> 33:31.440
Or the OEM.

33:31.440 --> 33:33.520
Depends on who gets the final image.

33:33.520 --> 33:35.280
Yeah but the carriers, we can trust them.

33:35.280 --> 33:38.240
They've never done anything stupid to their devices, right?

33:38.240 --> 33:39.640
Yeah, should be fine.

33:39.640 --> 33:40.640
Should be good.

33:40.640 --> 33:42.880
I'm assuming these phones are going to be cheaper.

33:42.880 --> 33:44.440
That's got to be the...

33:44.440 --> 33:45.440
I don't think so.

33:45.440 --> 33:46.440
No.

33:46.440 --> 33:47.440
No?

33:47.440 --> 33:48.440
I don't think so.

33:48.440 --> 33:49.440
Really?

33:49.440 --> 33:50.440
Nope.

33:50.440 --> 33:51.440
Nope.

33:51.440 --> 33:52.440
Nope.

33:52.440 --> 33:53.440
Check out Tailscale.

33:53.440 --> 33:54.440
Right.

33:54.440 --> 33:55.720
And is it still Linode and Datadog?

33:55.720 --> 33:56.720
I don't remember.

33:56.720 --> 33:59.560
You know the good, use Linode.

33:59.560 --> 34:00.560
Definitely check out Tailscale.

34:00.560 --> 34:02.440
But we're not putting it on your lock screen.

34:02.440 --> 34:05.760
So I can't believe this.

34:05.760 --> 34:10.680
And how funny is it that this is rolling out right as one of the headline features of iOS

34:10.680 --> 34:17.920
16 is fully like dynamic information rich lock screens?

34:17.920 --> 34:20.240
Apple is like, how about we make your lock screen useful and nice?

34:20.240 --> 34:22.300
It's like we have an idea. Hang on.

34:22.300 --> 34:28.600
Do you suppose the gals and lads over at Google are sitting there

34:28.600 --> 34:33.500
in their Android division going, oh, man, this is going to make us look like idiots.

34:33.500 --> 34:34.900
This is horrible.

34:34.900 --> 34:37.440
We should buy this glance company and put them out of business.

34:37.840 --> 34:41.840
Or do you or do you think they think this is a great thing?

34:42.380 --> 34:44.640
And I really struggle with this because.

34:45.580 --> 34:48.780
This is only possible because Google made it possible.

34:48.780 --> 34:52.780
This is. At the end of the day, Google's fault.

34:52.780 --> 34:55.780
And you know, I've always felt about that, you know, I felt like they have screwed

34:55.780 --> 34:59.780
the pooch from the very beginning and that they made this they made the Android platform

34:59.780 --> 35:03.780
completely malleable for these hostile actors so that way they could dump on the market

35:03.780 --> 35:07.780
and get rapid adoption. I've always felt that way, and I think they made critical decisions

35:07.780 --> 35:12.780
early on, like the choice to go with Java, the choice to let carriers like Verizon completely

35:12.780 --> 35:16.780
customize and call it droid and completely screw with the brand and everything.

35:16.780 --> 35:20.780
They just completely bent over backwards to get adoption.

35:20.780 --> 35:29.780
And I think here we are over a decade later, dude, in 2022, still dealing with the consequences

35:29.780 --> 35:32.780
of their short term decision making.

35:32.780 --> 35:33.780
That's how I see it.

35:33.780 --> 35:35.780
I don't think they mind.

35:35.780 --> 35:40.780
I mean, I because don't you feel like if they cared, they could just do something about it?

35:40.780 --> 35:42.780
Yeah, that's why I start to wonder.

35:42.780 --> 35:44.780
It's like, how could they even allow this?

35:44.780 --> 35:47.780
Why haven't they closed this up ages ago?

35:47.780 --> 35:52.780
I mean, I don't even want to put this idea in Google's head because I know how they feel

35:52.780 --> 35:56.780
about advertising and the deep, passionate love they have for it.

35:56.780 --> 36:01.780
But why don't they just like build this into Android and put these guys out of business

36:01.780 --> 36:03.780
and just be like, yay, market consolidation.

36:03.780 --> 36:04.780
We win.

36:04.780 --> 36:06.780
That's got to be the way this goes, right?

36:06.780 --> 36:07.780
They have to be thinking this.

36:07.780 --> 36:11.780
Well, they already have the biggest ad digital ad business in the world.

36:11.780 --> 36:14.780
I mean, what are these glance guys doing that special?

36:14.780 --> 36:19.780
Well, they'll they'll do specializations depending on what the marketer wants to do.

36:19.780 --> 36:24.780
Like maybe you want current events glances or sports glances with relative ads, right?

36:24.780 --> 36:25.780
Fitness.

36:25.780 --> 36:29.780
And so then you can like when the user uses a fitness app, you can prevent a fitness glance.

36:29.780 --> 36:33.780
And then with a little discreet ad at the bottom just on the lock screen.

36:33.780 --> 36:36.780
First of all, what relevant ads?

36:36.780 --> 36:40.780
I think maybe once a year I get an ad that actually makes me like click it and buy something.

36:40.780 --> 36:41.780
Yeah, yeah.

36:41.780 --> 36:44.780
My ads have gotten real lowbrow recently.

36:44.780 --> 36:49.780
And I know it's because like the rates of collapse or whatever, but it's dumb.

36:49.780 --> 36:51.780
Like, you know, I have I've taken up cycling.

36:51.780 --> 36:59.780
I bought a bike and I didn't get one of those the water bottle things, you know, that you hang off the.

36:59.780 --> 37:00.780
Yeah.

37:00.780 --> 37:01.780
Yeah.

37:01.780 --> 37:02.780
So I like bought one.

37:02.780 --> 37:03.780
Right.

37:03.780 --> 37:06.780
I Googled the kind that would be compatible with my bike, ordered it, bought it.

37:06.780 --> 37:07.780
No problem.

37:07.780 --> 37:15.780
Now I am tortured every time I look into Instagram or Facebook because apparently I need another one.

37:15.780 --> 37:17.780
I know they're so dumb.

37:17.780 --> 37:20.780
Like they advertise to you after you bought the thing.

37:20.780 --> 37:21.780
It's so dumb.

37:21.780 --> 37:22.780
It's so dumb.

37:22.780 --> 37:23.780
It's like I already bought the bike.

37:23.780 --> 37:24.780
I already got the water thing.

37:24.780 --> 37:26.780
I got the pump for the tires.

37:26.780 --> 37:27.780
I'm good.

37:27.780 --> 37:31.780
Like now I have to now I have to wake up early enough to actually, you know, do it.

37:31.780 --> 37:36.780
But yeah, it's I want less ads in my life.

37:36.780 --> 37:43.780
I again, all the other thing, too, is now this just makes iOS looks yet again so much

37:43.780 --> 37:47.780
more premium than than these kind of schlocky Android phones.

37:47.780 --> 37:54.780
So and I also wonder if iOS 16 announcing this sort of content rich lock screen, which

37:54.780 --> 37:56.780
is a super obvious feature.

37:56.780 --> 37:58.780
So it's not even like it's that innovative, right?

37:58.780 --> 38:02.780
It's clearly an obvious feature, but perhaps it opened the door for something like glances

38:02.780 --> 38:07.780
to their glance to come through and say, well, look, you know, Google hasn't built this feature

38:07.780 --> 38:11.780
in, but you could ship it on your phones today and be competitive with iOS 16.

38:11.780 --> 38:13.780
You know, it's not going to be as good.

38:13.780 --> 38:16.780
And you know, they're going to be tempted to put the ads and like the dumbest places

38:16.780 --> 38:18.780
where you'll accidentally click on them.

38:18.780 --> 38:19.780
Right.

38:19.780 --> 38:23.780
You could see this stupid sales person in the carrier store being like iOS 16 hasn't

38:23.780 --> 38:24.780
even shipped yet.

38:24.780 --> 38:26.780
And this device already has this feature.

38:26.780 --> 38:31.780
Also, having known very well someone who used to sell these kind of phones, they bribe the

38:31.780 --> 38:34.780
sales reps, the OEMs.

38:34.780 --> 38:36.780
And Apple does not do that.

38:36.780 --> 38:40.780
So if you ever wonder why, when you go to the Verizon store, like the kid who walks

38:40.780 --> 38:43.780
up to you is all all about that Samsung Galaxy, whatever.

38:43.780 --> 38:46.780
It's because he gets like 10 bucks per per unit.

38:46.780 --> 38:49.780
They get a little skiff.

38:49.780 --> 38:56.780
Ask not what your podcast can boost for you, but what you can boost for your podcast.

38:56.780 --> 39:01.780
The Golden Dragon boosted him five days ago with a row of ducks.

39:01.780 --> 39:02.780
Two, two, two, two.

39:02.780 --> 39:03.780
I'm a duck.

39:03.780 --> 39:04.780
D.U.K.

39:04.780 --> 39:05.780
Duck.

39:05.780 --> 39:06.780
Loaded with talent.

39:06.780 --> 39:07.780
I love it.

39:07.780 --> 39:08.780
I know.

39:08.780 --> 39:10.780
The row of ducks is great.

39:10.780 --> 39:12.780
Clippy for code is a great analogy, he writes.

39:12.780 --> 39:14.780
That does make more sense.

39:14.780 --> 39:16.780
Talking about our discussion around Copilot.

39:16.780 --> 39:21.780
I was less end of open source and more maybe this is just going to be code paranoia.

39:21.780 --> 39:22.780
I don't know.

39:22.780 --> 39:27.780
But anyways, what is what has driven you to a web terminal versus something like Alacrity?

39:27.780 --> 39:30.780
My guess would be maybe it's program compatibility.

39:30.780 --> 39:31.780
Thanks for the show.

39:31.780 --> 39:36.780
So he's asking you what drove you to such a fancy terminal?

39:36.780 --> 39:37.780
I guess I should have asked that question.

39:37.780 --> 39:39.780
So thanks, Golden Dragon.

39:39.780 --> 39:40.780
Yes, there's two things here.

39:40.780 --> 39:42.780
One, you gave me an opportunity to make fun of Copilot.

39:42.780 --> 39:44.780
So I will do that in one second.

39:44.780 --> 39:46.780
So, yeah, my fancy terminal love.

39:46.780 --> 39:48.780
So on Mac, I like warp.

39:48.780 --> 39:51.780
I think warp is probably the best terminal I've ever used.

39:51.780 --> 39:56.780
I really wish they didn't make you log into GitHub to use it because that just feels kind of icky.

39:56.780 --> 39:58.780
I also wish they would port it to Linux.

39:58.780 --> 40:01.780
It's a native Rust application, native UI.

40:01.780 --> 40:03.780
It's super fast, super good.

40:03.780 --> 40:06.780
They have like their weird AI auto completion.

40:06.780 --> 40:11.780
And because I can't spell, for instance, I think Postgres is spelled with a Q.

40:11.780 --> 40:13.780
It really helps me out.

40:13.780 --> 40:19.780
On Linux, I'm using Tabby, which is a webby-ish terminal.

40:19.780 --> 40:21.780
Why the fancy terminal?

40:21.780 --> 40:22.780
I really can't spell.

40:22.780 --> 40:24.780
I can't stress this enough.

40:24.780 --> 40:30.780
Like writing SQL queries is a pain in the ass because I routinely spell the names of the columns wrong or the tables wrong.

40:30.780 --> 40:34.780
These nicer terminals generally help with that.

40:34.780 --> 40:35.780
Now, you mentioned Alacrity.

40:35.780 --> 40:36.780
I did look at Alacrity.

40:36.780 --> 40:38.780
I almost picked it over Tabby.

40:38.780 --> 40:42.780
I just happened to feel like Tabby is a text rendering.

40:42.780 --> 40:44.780
It has some customization in there.

40:44.780 --> 40:55.780
I try as much as I can to make my workflow on the dev one and the iMac basically the same for the simple reason of I just don't care.

40:55.780 --> 40:56.780
I'm just trying to get my work done.

40:56.780 --> 40:59.780
Muscle memory, as much as you can optimize that.

40:59.780 --> 41:00.780
Yeah.

41:00.780 --> 41:02.780
So it's pretty cool.

41:02.780 --> 41:08.780
I mean, there is a weird thing going on in the terminal space where it's just getting attention now.

41:08.780 --> 41:14.780
Like, it's funny, I was in GNOME Terminal and I guess I said, GNOME, please, you don't have to email me again.

41:14.780 --> 41:16.780
It's not GNOME.

41:16.780 --> 41:17.780
I know.

41:17.780 --> 41:19.780
I've seen the error of my ways.

41:19.780 --> 41:20.780
Bless me, GNOME.

41:20.780 --> 41:26.780
Anyway, and it just feels old compared to some of these newer options.

41:26.780 --> 41:36.780
Having said that, it's very, very sad that you have to install an entire instance of Google Chrome or Chromium to run a goddamn terminal.

41:36.780 --> 41:39.780
But, you know, we've we've begun to make peace with that.

41:39.780 --> 41:40.780
But, yeah.

41:40.780 --> 41:42.780
So CodePilot.

41:42.780 --> 41:43.780
Wow.

41:43.780 --> 41:47.780
I mean, every once in a while it gets something right.

41:47.780 --> 41:49.780
But it's got some interesting ideas.

41:49.780 --> 41:52.780
It's got some really adorable ideas.

41:52.780 --> 41:59.780
It's like it's what I imagine my six year olds would do if I just like clunk them down and be like, all right, you're writing some typescript now go.

41:59.780 --> 42:00.780
Right.

42:00.780 --> 42:07.780
Also, Objective-C, if you really want to screw with it, it has no idea that Objective-C ever existed.

42:07.780 --> 42:16.780
It seems to think it's C++ and it just suggests the craziest non syntax compliant stuff.

42:16.780 --> 42:22.780
It's like I just decided just to open up some old Objective-C code I had in VS Code.

42:22.780 --> 42:28.780
And it has a little indicator on the bottom and you can see the poor bastard spinning like, what is this?

42:28.780 --> 42:29.780
It doesn't know what to do.

42:29.780 --> 42:32.780
Python, though, it's down with the snake.

42:32.780 --> 42:34.780
All right. Nice check in.

42:34.780 --> 42:38.780
I bucky boosts in four days ago with a double boost.

42:38.780 --> 42:40.780
Ten thousand fifty cents.

42:40.780 --> 42:53.780
My feeling is that as a developer, especially a junior developer, you should devote yourself to read documentation and understand what you're doing and writing more and not having it written by a bot and thus having to understand it less.

42:53.780 --> 43:01.780
If abused, this Copilot thing could have an impact on software quality and security, at least until it becomes so good, it completely replaces us.

43:01.780 --> 43:07.780
He says, isn't it as bad as copy and pasting from some from S.O.?

43:07.780 --> 43:08.780
What do you mean by S?

43:08.780 --> 43:09.780
Stack Overflow.

43:09.780 --> 43:11.780
Oh, Stack Overflow, of course.

43:11.780 --> 43:15.780
I always think significant other, but it's like that doesn't seem maybe, although maybe significant other is a developer.

43:15.780 --> 43:19.780
Well, if you're sticking it up for us like Linus, then I would copy and paste from them all day long.

43:19.780 --> 43:20.780
I mean, but he's right.

43:20.780 --> 43:21.780
And we've made that point.

43:21.780 --> 43:25.780
It is in fact, I think he's quoting you perhaps isn't as bad as copy and pasting from Stack Overflow.

43:25.780 --> 43:38.780
He says it's almost as bad as that, but at least there you have to understand that a what you want to solve and be read an explanation of the solution, usually well written and see you have to do the effort to adapt the solution to your specific code.

43:38.780 --> 43:41.780
Laziness rarely brings excellence.

43:41.780 --> 43:42.780
Just my two sats.

43:42.780 --> 43:44.780
Thanks for the great show.

43:44.780 --> 43:48.780
Well, but Copilot, it's just funnier because it suggests stupid things all the time.

43:48.780 --> 43:56.780
So it is funnier for sure, although I haven't thought about the fact that to use Stack Overflow, you got to understand what you're asking for.

43:56.780 --> 43:58.780
And you have to read the explanation usually to.

43:58.780 --> 43:59.780
That's a great point.

43:59.780 --> 44:06.780
And if you actually post on Stack Overflow, you have to have the testicular fortitude to know that you're going to get yelled at.

44:06.780 --> 44:09.780
You better be no matter what you say, you're getting yelled at.

44:09.780 --> 44:12.780
So we did not have a lot of boost this week.

44:12.780 --> 44:17.780
So if you'd like to get your boost and we'd love a good batch for the next episode, you can go grab a new podcast app.

44:17.780 --> 44:19.780
At newpodcastapps.com.

44:19.780 --> 44:25.780
I also have my Fountain FM referral link because Fountain FM is the app I've been using.

44:25.780 --> 44:27.780
If you want to try it out and then I think you'll be able to follow me.

44:27.780 --> 44:30.780
You can see the clips I make and stuff in there.

44:30.780 --> 44:31.780
We did get some thank you boost.

44:31.780 --> 44:34.780
We got thirty six ninety sats from Kaspeland.

44:34.780 --> 44:45.780
We got one thousand six hundred eleven sats from ITGuy05 and four hundred and seventy four sats from KVoc or KPVoc, as I often say, just trying to boost into the next episode.

44:45.780 --> 44:51.780
He likes to do that, which I think is great.

44:51.780 --> 44:57.780
Thank you for those and also thank you to our members, the Coder QA crew over at Coder QA dot co.

44:57.780 --> 45:02.780
We're going to record a new Coderly this week and I got something kind of special already put together for our members.

45:02.780 --> 45:04.780
Mm hmm. Looking forward to it.

45:04.780 --> 45:07.780
We're just going to we're going to wait till you're not dying.

45:07.780 --> 45:10.780
Want to you know, we don't want to over we don't want to overdo it.

45:10.780 --> 45:14.780
So we got to let you hear. Oh, my God. I just had a brilliant idea.

45:14.780 --> 45:16.780
Adds on the robes. What about him?

45:16.780 --> 45:20.780
We should be saying we should be doing. Oh, we should put like patches.

45:20.780 --> 45:26.780
Right. So let's call Linode. Let's sell them like a little Linode logo on the other side of the rope.

45:26.780 --> 45:32.780
I mean, when you're talking about a robe, though, maybe that's an opportunity for a liquor sponsor brought to you by J&R Cigars.

45:32.780 --> 45:36.780
And we might need to modernize, you know, because we're a new media.

45:36.780 --> 45:44.780
We may need to do like cannabis and CBD CBD oils and maybe like essential, you know.

45:44.780 --> 45:50.780
Are we a middle aged single mom taking our little bath? Is that what's happening?

45:50.780 --> 45:56.780
Microdosing. Yeah. But like, you know, because like the lower part of the road, that's got to be like the cheaper ad space. Right.

45:56.780 --> 46:00.780
Well, the most expensive has to be right on your waist where you tie the rope. Right.

46:00.780 --> 46:05.780
We could call that the golden zone. Oh, man. What about like the ends of the robe tie?

46:05.780 --> 46:09.780
We could do it like a karate belt. Right. Where you have like the stripes.

46:09.780 --> 46:16.780
Well, clearly we should probably just wrap up and hang up our headphones and get into the road business because I think we got some serious runway there.

46:16.780 --> 46:19.780
Unless we get some members, you know, the members do keep us going. Coder QA dot co.

46:19.780 --> 46:23.780
You've also got the ad free feed over there as well. Mr.

46:23.780 --> 46:29.780
Dominic, is there anywhere we should send folks to find you this week or look at stuff or I don't know.

46:29.780 --> 46:36.780
Not really. I mean, I don't know. Maybe I'll mention Elon on Twitter to get yelled at again. That's possible.

46:36.780 --> 46:43.780
That's like a great idea. Oh, actually, I do have someone to send people. It has nothing to do with me or you or JB or TMB.

46:43.780 --> 46:53.780
The Web Telescope five o'clock today, we're seeing the first picture, the preview. And then tomorrow morning, Eastern Time, I think it's like 11 in the morning.

46:53.780 --> 47:02.780
NASA's releasing a bunch of the photos. But today I don't know if you saw this because today Biden's going to do like he's doing like a whole little press conference reveal the first photo.

47:02.780 --> 47:06.780
Apparently it's going to be very interesting.

47:06.780 --> 47:11.780
Ah, very cool. Now, pretty soon we'll start our aliens radio. The truth is out there.

47:11.780 --> 47:17.780
I will mention that we have Jupiter tube and you can catch the show live on Jupiter dot tube on Mondays at noon.

47:17.780 --> 47:25.780
Pacific three p.m. Eastern, I probably should mention that the top of the show because you can hit pause on your audio version and go watch the video version as such that it is.

47:25.780 --> 47:32.780
Maybe I shouldn't actually. The Drew version is so much better. But check out Jupiter dot tube for all the live production archives over there.

47:32.780 --> 47:36.780
Links to what we talked about today. Coder dot show slash four seven four.

47:36.780 --> 47:42.780
That's also where you'll find our contact form. Your feedback is a big part of the show. That's why we open every episode with your feedback.

47:42.780 --> 47:52.780
So send that in. Coder dot show slash contact. You'll also find our RSS page over there so you can subscribe in your favorite player or you could get a new podcast app and you search in the directory and we'll show up in there.

47:52.780 --> 47:59.780
It's easy. It's super easy. All right. I think that's it. So thank you everybody for joining us on this week's episode of the Coder radio program.

47:59.780 --> 48:06.780
You know what, man? Why don't we just do it? I'll just go grab the halls. You want to do it? Yeah. We're going to record a Coderly right now. Right now.

48:06.780 --> 48:13.780
Let me just go grab a lozenge so I stop coughing. Yep. All right. Well here on the live stream over at Jupiter dot tube, the show rolls on.

48:13.780 --> 48:20.780
But of course for you on the downloads, which is like, you know, everyone. All of you. Yes. Just be regular.

48:20.780 --> 48:26.780
And also if you're listening live, it's a Coderly so drop trow. That's that's the standard practice.

48:26.780 --> 48:31.780
Yeah. Do we do the Coderly live or do we not let them? We've been doing it live. Let's do it live.

48:31.780 --> 48:37.780
You know what? You know how we like to show off. Bill O'Reilly is coming on, too. It'll be great.

48:37.780 --> 49:02.780
All right, everybody. Thanks so much. See you right back here next week.
