00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,920
This is KOTORadio, episode 484 for September 19th, 2022.

2
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:19,760
Hello everyone and welcome into KOTORadio, Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show

3
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:23,840
taking a look at the art of development and probably the world of technology.

4
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,680
We'll get into all of that.

5
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:30,320
It's Chris and joining us every single week from our base in Florida.

6
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:32,080
It's our host, Mr. Dominic.

7
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:32,640
Hello, Mike.

8
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,240
Hello, Chris.

9
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:35,600
Hello, handsome.

10
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:36,800
You're sounding really good.

11
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:37,920
Sounding healthy.

12
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:39,520
I'm feeling a little better.

13
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:44,480
Granted, I have some menthol powers that work right now, but feeling pretty better.

14
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:47,600
Well, you're a soldier and I'm glad you made it.

15
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,280
I had a question for you because I have a little story.

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,680
Do you ever do the Instacart thing?

17
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:53,840
Order your groceries and...

18
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:57,120
Instacart, in particular, very rarely.

19
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,920
Maybe like once a quarter.

20
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:04,160
I'm trying to lean into it a little bit more because it's been a really busy week as we're

21
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:05,760
preparing for the road trip.

22
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:10,560
And we ended up with the kids on a night that we hadn't originally planned for, but worked

23
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:11,200
out fine.

24
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:16,080
And we thought, oh, you know, on the way home, we'll order some groceries and they'll be

25
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:16,800
there when we get there.

26
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:20,240
And it'll be perfect timing because we'll be arriving right at dinner time and the kids

27
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:21,040
are going to be hungry.

28
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:25,600
So the wife jumps on the old Instacart and orders up a couple hundred dollars worth of

29
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,640
groceries because we need some stuff for the weekend and man, is food expensive here.

30
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:29,680
Wow.

31
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,440
And all is good to go.

32
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:35,360
We get a little push notification as we're heading north saying, guess what?

33
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,840
Your delivery has arrived.

34
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:38,400
Enjoy.

35
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,400
Thank you for being an Instacart customer, et cetera, et cetera.

36
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,600
We think, OK, let's get going.

37
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,040
We've got frozen foods.

38
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:43,840
We need to hustle.

39
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,200
So we rush, rush, rush.

40
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:56,880
We get home, pull up and there's no groceries and I step out and it's instant chaos.

41
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:03,760
Instant chaos the moment I open the door because our neighbor has a friend over who has a couple

42
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:07,520
of dogs and they're just out free roam in the neighborhood and they're in the driveway

43
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,600
and Levi jumps out of the car.

44
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:12,560
He wants to go see the dogs bark, bark, bark, bark, woof, woof, woof.

45
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:15,440
And then the kids jump out, hey, dogs, dogs, you know, so I got three kids.

46
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,880
Oh, look at her daddy's dogs.

47
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:18,160
It's all this chaos.

48
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:21,520
And this neighbor lady comes over, this neighbor lady's friend comes over.

49
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,240
She's half deaf.

50
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,640
She's trying to talk to us.

51
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:27,120
And she says something like, oh, do you live here?

52
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,080
And and we say, yeah, this is this is us.

53
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,160
It's like, oh, I think I just turned away your groceries.

54
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,040
And we're like, what?

55
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,120
What are you talking about?

56
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,800
It's like, yeah, no, somebody just tried to deliver your groceries and I refused the delivery.

57
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,480
I thought they made a mistake.

58
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:44,000
And we're like, wait, why would you do that?

59
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Yeah, I just thought they I thought they made a mistake.

60
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,280
Oh, my sorry about that.

61
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,880
Of course, Instacart's now charged us for the 200 plus grocery order.

62
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:52,960
Yeah, this person's marked it as delivered.

63
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:56,640
We now have to plea with Instacart support to refund us.

64
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,520
They refund us credit in the app eventually.

65
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:02,080
But that doesn't mean we get the groceries.

66
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:07,200
So then we had to go get more groceries and double spend and double time.

67
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,680
I mean, this stuff is a catastrophe sometimes.

68
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:13,680
And so this week, I read that Instacart is planning to do an IPO.

69
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:21,440
You know, this these apps that start on the back of all of these contract laborers who are a little sketch sometimes.

70
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:25,040
Yeah, and then they go and they make billions.

71
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:30,160
And of course, they're they're pitching this entire thing is it's a great opportunity for the employees to buy shares and really invest.

72
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:34,560
Right. Of course, as the economy is going to and people can't afford these prices.

73
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:41,760
I ordered food for the guys last night after Linux unplugged for Thai food was one hundred and twenty dollars for the three of us.

74
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,680
It's just I couldn't believe it. I was shocked.

75
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:47,280
And then the the DoorDash guy gets over there.

76
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,800
He's sitting there for 30 minutes.

77
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:51,440
I text him. I'm like, hey, man, I'm going to have to cancel this order.

78
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,560
This is taking way too long.

79
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,080
And then guess what?

80
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,320
Next thing you know, the order's on its way.

81
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:58,880
Something shady is going on with all these businesses.

82
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:01,680
You know, and they say they're disruptive.

83
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:02,800
I don't think so.

84
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:05,120
I actually think they're exploitive is what I think.

85
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,720
I don't I mean, I'm glad people can go get a little extra work.

86
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:11,520
And, you know, for those people out there that's working for it, great.

87
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:22,000
I mean, it's this isn't a universal statement, but there's something about seeing Instacart and DoorDash and Uber Eats work towards these IPOs and work towards these massive share programs.

88
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:28,160
And meanwhile, as somebody who's on the other end of this, I just keep having a worse and worse experience.

89
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,880
That's all just a little, I guess, start the show with a complaint.

90
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,200
As is our way.

91
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:35,200
You know, the kids these days is really what I'm saying.

92
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:35,920
Yeah.

93
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:38,160
Except for generally, it's usually older folk.

94
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:41,200
So Jacob R. writes into the show, the ads are coming.

95
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:46,160
If it's not a subscription model, more and more app developers are resorting to ads.

96
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,800
And it's not just the independent shops either.

97
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:55,760
In the recent article, which he included, Microsoft is leveraging their ability to deliver ads to the free users of Outlook.

98
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,280
Yep.

99
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,560
He wants to know what your take is.

100
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:05,360
Do you monetize every part of the app you can in a development shop or are there parts that maybe you could intentionally release for free?

101
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,240
The ads are coming.

102
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,400
Should we just deal with it?

103
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:12,400
Should Microsoft just bend and reduce how they monetize their customers?

104
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,800
I mean, it's not really fair to them either, I suppose.

105
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:15,840
So what's your thought?

106
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,120
The ads are coming to ads.

107
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:22,320
He believes that you're going to see it baked into all aspects of the apps that we haven't seen before.

108
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:26,320
At the same time, he thinks maybe it's a viable way to pay developers.

109
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:33,680
So the problem here is that people don't want to pay for stuff, as we've been talking about since 2012.

110
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:44,800
But the new problem that's going to start coming is as more developers turn to ads to monetize, the rates on those ads is going to dramatically go down.

111
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:49,280
So this is kind of a progressive sort of issue, right?

112
00:05:49,280 --> 00:06:00,160
Because the more people turn to this, the more aggressively they're going to have to, you know, basically shove ads into their apps to make the same amount of revenue.

113
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:04,080
And I have had ad supported apps out in the past.

114
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:07,600
That's a that's a tough hustle.

115
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,040
I think you're right, Jacob.

116
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:14,800
I just don't you know, it's one of those things where I think a lot of people that I hear all the time are like, oh, I'm going to make an app.

117
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:18,720
It's going to be like, I don't know, right, like a Magic the Gathering life counter.

118
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,120
I'm going to throw some ads in it and then I'll make money.

119
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:28,480
But the truth is, it's it's just there's just not that much money in it at most scale, right?

120
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,600
Unless you're a huge app.

121
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:39,040
And that's different because at that point, you're not really just like shoving ads in like I add or, you know, Google's AdMob, I think it's called AdMob.

122
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,240
Is it still? I don't know.

123
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,040
I can't keep track.

124
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:43,040
I think they may have changed the name.

125
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:45,680
It's the Google version.

126
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,160
You know, the bigger apps have like ad sales teams, right?

127
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:51,440
They're like podcasts where, well, it's not even true for all podcasts.

128
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,320
We still do it that way.

129
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:55,040
But there are some who just do dynamic insertion of random ads.

130
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,160
Oh, yeah, it's getting huge.

131
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:01,520
It reminds me a lot of the beginning of the App Store when like an app could be like nine bucks or five bucks.

132
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:07,280
And then, you know, we went from nine to five to two to one to ninety or to ninety nine cents rather.

133
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:11,600
And then it just became zero effectively.

134
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,960
Yeah, I don't know. I don't know what to say.

135
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:18,320
It's definitely a collective action problem because, you know, it is always going to be in the individual

136
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:23,520
developers to show incentive to shove more ads into their app, especially if they're not like bespoke

137
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:28,000
apps for like the Apple hipsters, you know, people who don't really care about ads.

138
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,960
But that is going to devalue the ads themselves.

139
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:37,120
So it sucks that we lost this monetization fight, but we did.

140
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:42,640
And yeah, I think it's I know you didn't say just for Indies, but I will say for Indies,

141
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:49,600
getting any amount of money out of end users these days is it's just like any like a buck.

142
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:52,400
Like I buy me one cake up.

143
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:55,440
It's really just not. It's hard.

144
00:07:55,440 --> 00:08:00,240
I mean, I hate to be right, because I know Chris and I predicted this years and years ago,

145
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,800
but this is where we are right now.

146
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,600
Yeah, I'm I am fascinated to see how far this goes.

147
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:08,880
I know there's definitely the conversation in the podcast industry that you and I have

148
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:13,520
talked about a little bit on the show that's evolving really quickly around just dynamically

149
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:18,240
inserting ads and kind of monetizing things that you haven't monetized before.

150
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:22,880
Like the one another initiative that I've seen out there is kind of companies will

151
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:27,280
browse the app store or the play store and reach out to developers and say, hey, have you thought

152
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:30,400
about monetizing your your app with ads?

153
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:33,840
Look at this. We could promise you this this amount based on your downloads.

154
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:38,000
And they're kind of proactively asking developers sort of like these dynamic insert companies

155
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,760
are proactively asking podcasters, but they're all really low numbers.

156
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,680
And they're going to get lower.

157
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:45,840
But the more people say yes, the lower it gets.

158
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:49,200
What I'm trying to figure out, I wonder if you have thoughts is why is it just hitting

159
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,960
so hard all of a sudden?

160
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:54,560
Because the digital advertising market in the broader context is in pretty bad shape

161
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:55,360
right now.

162
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:59,280
A lot of contraction, but it seems like the low end is just exploding.

163
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:00,880
Well, I think a lot's happened, right?

164
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:05,840
And it's it's kind of related to each other.

165
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:10,560
My impression and you would know a lot more from the podcasting side is there's just a

166
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,320
lot more podcasts, right?

167
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:16,240
I remember like JB even before Coder was super niche, right?

168
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,240
It was. Are you a Linux fan?

169
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,040
Are you a techie?

170
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,800
I don't know why you won't bring my Star War star.

171
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:23,440
What is this?

172
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,000
Swo tour?

173
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:25,600
What was the name of the show?

174
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,480
Oh, Stoked was Star Trek online.

175
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:33,840
You had a show dedicated to one MMO that was not even like one of the top MMOs.

176
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,040
No, I'm just a Star Trek fan.

177
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,080
I'm a Star Trek fan.

178
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:36,960
Right, exactly.

179
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,440
And you know what?

180
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,800
The show did decent.

181
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,160
You know, it did decent.

182
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,680
Well, that was that was kind of the thing.

183
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:47,120
And I think that's why we're able to still sell the types of ads that we do because we're

184
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:47,760
so focused.

185
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,920
But I'll give you a great example.

186
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:53,200
So I've been playing magic again and I've been kind of into that kind of gaming world

187
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:53,520
again.

188
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:55,680
Oh, I was completely unaware of that.

189
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:56,400
I know, right?

190
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:00,720
And I'm like, let me see if there's any magic, the gathering podcast.

191
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:03,600
And I just did like a dumb query and overcast.

192
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:07,040
Holy mackerel, like everybody in there.

193
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,720
So I did the same thing for like Linux now.

194
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:13,040
And there's I haven't really looked for new shows on anything in a long time.

195
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:16,080
It's very different than, let's say, 2012.

196
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:19,840
There's every conceivable topic has 100 podcasts.

197
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:20,960
It's really something.

198
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:25,040
Yeah, my fiance loves true crime and she can listen to somebody get butchered in an alley

199
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:29,920
all day every day because that's apparently a thing that people like.

200
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:30,640
Plenty of that.

201
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,400
Yeah, it's remarkable.

202
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:38,240
What you discover, I believe, I mean, because I recently took this, I don't know, over a

203
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:42,000
year ago when we got an email when somebody said, hey, what do you guys think of Web3?

204
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,880
And then I just went down the rabbit hole of, well, I need to at least get a solid

205
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:45,920
understanding of what this is.

206
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:51,280
And so one of the things I did is I went I went podcast shopping and, you know, you

207
00:10:51,280 --> 00:11:00,320
just you type in like Bitcoin or Web3 and there's hundreds and maybe four of them are

208
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,520
any good at all.

209
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:05,600
Like, it's really, oh, the bar needs to be raised.

210
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,640
Otherwise, podcasting is going to get a bad reputation, I say.

211
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:13,520
And, you know, if I just had less on my mind, if I had one less thing to think about, perhaps

212
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,040
I could help solve that.

213
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:17,520
Perhaps the uniform lifestyle is the answer.

214
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,360
MTG Jacob writes in.

215
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,360
He has wise, uniform words.

216
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:24,880
He's glad to hear that you enjoyed TCG Con as well.

217
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:28,640
Hopes you're still going strong with the commander sessions.

218
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:29,360
And standard.

219
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:30,800
OK.

220
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:31,200
Sorry.

221
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:31,520
All right.

222
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:32,880
No, I you know what?

223
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,160
I don't I don't need to know.

224
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:34,560
It's good.

225
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,960
I'm just baby, I'm just happy that you're happy.

226
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:37,600
There you go.

227
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:42,320
He says, I wanted to respond to Chris's dilemma regarding the uniform lifestyle trademark.

228
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,880
I've been doing this for a few years now.

229
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:48,880
Identical shirt, jeans and the same pair of shoes nearly every day.

230
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,320
It's super helpful.

231
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,720
And most people don't really notice.

232
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:57,760
One piece of advice I have for Chris is you will need some variant of shirts for housework,

233
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:00,240
cleaning dishes, messy jobs, essentially.

234
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:05,040
If you want to keep your uniform clothes clean, you don't want manual labor eating away at

235
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,040
your clothes and shortening the lifespan of them.

236
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:10,640
But maybe this is just because I organize cleaning for certain times of the day and

237
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:11,760
I can change accordingly.

238
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:14,240
In any case, I found it very helpful practice.

239
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,800
And if done simply enough, most people don't even pick up on it.

240
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:21,200
All the best and to Chris and keep on tapping, Mike.

241
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:25,040
You know, Jacob, that's a great bit of advice is you do need the work clothes.

242
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:29,040
I think this is my post trip job is to get myself a uniform.

243
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,960
I got to do this even this morning.

244
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:33,680
So I got up early this morning because I didn't sleep much.

245
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:36,960
So I just sort of threw in the towel, you know, decided to get up early and get down

246
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,400
here and discover you put the whole show together.

247
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,960
So I was like, oh, well, I have an easy morning.

248
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:42,880
I would last week.

249
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,400
Yeah, no, you did.

250
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:44,960
You did.

251
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,160
I just, of course, forgot.

252
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:50,800
But I got dressed in the dark and then I got down here and saw what I put on.

253
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:53,920
It was so wrinkled and awful and just so disheveled and doesn't really match.

254
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:57,360
And I'm just thinking, yeah, this is a problem I don't need anymore because there are.

255
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:00,560
Usually one week, one day, if not a couple of days a week where I'm getting dressed

256
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,880
pretty early and just don't even really have the capacity.

257
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,560
So I think it's happening.

258
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:09,040
My only thing is like, if I'm going to do it, I don't want somebody else's logo.

259
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:13,040
You know, I don't like some clothing brands logo like Carhartt or, you know, just as an

260
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:15,440
example, I'd rather have my logo.

261
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:19,760
So that's my then I'm starting to think, well, could I could I make myself something, you

262
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:20,960
know, make a few of them?

263
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,040
That's kind of what I'm thinking.

264
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:23,540
We'll see.

265
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:25,200
Guess what?

266
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:31,280
This is the last coder that's going to sound decent for a while because for like nearly

267
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:33,120
almost the next month, I'm going to be on the road.

268
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,040
Actually, I think I think it's going to sound OK.

269
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,360
Drew and I worked on it ahead of time a little bit.

270
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,240
I sent him a few samples.

271
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,280
He gave me a few tips.

272
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:40,580
He's so great.

273
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:45,920
So actually, I'm hoping it's one of the better sounding in terms of audio quality road trips.

274
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:51,840
But when we hang up, I'm going to do like the last little bits of post-show stuff I

275
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:57,760
have to do and then I'm hitting the road and I'm doing the West Coast tour, meetup.com

276
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,280
slash Jupiter Broadcasting.

277
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:04,320
So by the time you hear this episode, our southern Oregon meetup will have just concluded.

278
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,640
But our meetup near Sacramento is nigh.

279
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:10,000
So we'll have details at meetup.com slash Jupiter Broadcasting.

280
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,640
If you're in the Oregon area and you missed our southern meetup, we're going to have one

281
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:18,160
more in early October in the Portland area.

282
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,200
So details there.

283
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:22,320
Meetup.com slash Jupiter Broadcasting and then future events.

284
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:26,800
Now that we're doing the West Coast this summer, probably checks that box for a while.

285
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:30,880
We're going to do a different area next year, hopefully, if everything goes as planned.

286
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:34,880
And we'll set up location specific chat rooms for every area where we do these types of

287
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:35,680
events.

288
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:39,200
And we have a directory of those in our matrix spaces.

289
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:50,000
But just the easiest way to get to it, honestly, is bit.ly slash matrix meetup.

290
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,520
Linode dot com slash coder.

291
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:54,880
Go there to get $100 in 60 day credit on a new account.

292
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:57,840
Support the show while you're checking out something really cool, too.

293
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:00,000
Linode is fast, reliable cloud hosting.

294
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,160
You got to try it for your next project.

295
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,240
Maybe you want to experiment with something.

296
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:08,000
It's what I use when I'm testing things and then when I flip over to production.

297
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,320
Linode is always rolling out new nice upgrades.

298
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:14,080
They've been improving their UI, which I already think is top notch.

299
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:18,240
But an area they've recently focused on is their one click deployment marketplace.

300
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,960
Oh, I love the new changes.

301
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:23,520
And now I can quickly see the new projects they've added.

302
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:27,600
So like sometimes I'll just spend an evening playing around up on Linode with one of these

303
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,440
new free software projects and learning about it.

304
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:34,560
And if you're a performance hound, just a little bit ago they rolled out MVME PCIe

305
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:37,440
storage, new AMD epic processors.

306
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,040
They are their own ISP.

307
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,680
They have 11 data centers around the world.

308
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,600
I mean, just checks all the boxes.

309
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:47,680
But the other thing that's great is Linode's business is architected in a way where they

310
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,120
have real support.

311
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:52,240
They don't have to just cheap out on the support.

312
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,840
They've built it into their business model.

313
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:54,560
So great support.

314
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,960
You call them, you get somebody, they stick with you till it's fixed.

315
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:02,560
And you combine that with their great documentation, fantastic performance,

316
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:06,160
and how easy it is to integrate with any of your infrastructure management tools.

317
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:09,760
Guys, there's really just nothing that checks all these boxes and is reliable and

318
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:10,960
trustable like this.

319
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:14,960
It's something you can run your business on for a decade or your personal site forever.

320
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:18,240
You can find some cheaper places, I would imagine.

321
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:23,520
But you better be prepared to migrate in six months or a year.

322
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:26,960
You're not going to get this kind of support, or you won't get this kind of performance

323
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,320
or this level of integration, right?

324
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,840
It's just all of these things.

325
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:33,920
Because Linode's had to make a great product for 19 years to get by.

326
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:36,560
And it's a very competitive market.

327
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:40,400
And they figured it out, and they just keep making it better.

328
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:42,000
That's why I keep talking about it.

329
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,560
Because Coder Radio listeners love Linode.

330
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:45,600
They keep signing up.

331
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,360
They become customers.

332
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,720
They recommend it to their friends.

333
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,240
I know you're going to love it too.

334
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:54,400
Go try it out and get $100 for 60 days on a new account and support the show by going

335
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:57,360
to linode.com slash coder.

336
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,080
One more time.

337
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:59,200
Let's do it together.

338
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:04,160
Linode.com slash coder.

339
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:09,200
So Mr. Dominic, you got a first look at something brand new from JetBrains.

340
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:11,680
And I have been absolutely curious to hear your take.

341
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:12,560
You haven't shared it with me.

342
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:13,440
You've been a good boy.

343
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:13,920
I have.

344
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:15,680
Haven't violated any NDAs.

345
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:17,520
But we get to hear what you think now.

346
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:17,920
Yeah.

347
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:19,440
So one, there is no NDA.

348
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:21,520
I just got into the early whatever.

349
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:22,640
You hacker.

350
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,080
Yeah, you just fell out of form.

351
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:31,120
So it was the JetBrains fleet editor, IDE Lite.

352
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:38,640
And if you're familiar with JetBrains, they make PyCharm, RubyMine, Rider, WebStorm.

353
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:42,000
But basically, oh, yeah, IntelliJ, right?

354
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,520
Their big one's IntelliJ, the Java one.

355
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,960
They have a product management cool called Space.

356
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,480
I know virtually nothing about it.

357
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:49,520
I tried a demo of it once.

358
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:50,480
It wasn't my cup of tea.

359
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:53,520
But this is basically a editor.

360
00:17:53,520 --> 00:18:02,880
Think of it as like an IntelliJ Lite, almost like the text wrangler to IntelliJ's BBedit.

361
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:06,640
Now that's a deep Snow Leopard era Mac OS reference.

362
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:11,920
They don't say it, but it feels like it's trying to be the just enough IDE.

363
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:12,960
It's interesting.

364
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:17,360
So I have thoughts and fee-fee's, of course, right off the bat.

365
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:22,880
If you're a hardcore IntelliJ user, this is not going to replace IntelliJ for you at all, right?

366
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:27,360
If you're deep into the refactorings, if you're using all the fun Java tools,

367
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:30,240
like the Spring tools for the annotations and all that good stuff,

368
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:35,040
you're probably going to be sticking with just IntelliJ proper.

369
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,720
They say they're considering open sourcing it.

370
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:45,920
I find that hard to believe given their business model, but maybe they are.

371
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:52,480
It's a lot like VS Code in that you can add plug-ins to it and make it more full-featured.

372
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:56,720
So it straddles that weird, like it starts out as like a...

373
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,640
Like honestly, if this came out a few years ago,

374
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:01,280
this would have been like the TextMate 2 replacement for me.

375
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,160
And when I say a few years ago, time dilates and I really mean like six years ago.

376
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:08,160
I do like it.

377
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:14,400
I'm not trying to kind of slag it off here, but there's a free Electron package

378
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:18,240
free Electron-powered Elephant in the room and that's VS Code.

379
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:18,640
Of course.

380
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:24,880
For reasons of just pure economics and network effects, VS Code has effectively

381
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:27,760
become the de facto standard tool for this type of workload.

382
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:32,000
And frankly, it does a very good job, particularly if you're working in Python.

383
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:35,200
Fleet looks really cool.

384
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,360
I wish it had come out about six years ago.

385
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:43,840
I think it could have become that TextMate 2 replacement for the dev hipsters like me

386
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:46,480
who are willing to pay 70 bucks for an editor.

387
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:52,800
With that said, I've used it straight for about a week and a half

388
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:57,360
and I see no real reason to abandon VS Code.

389
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:01,200
And it does not replace heavier IDEs.

390
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,200
So I am a JetBrains customer, right?

391
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,840
I have whatever it is, their toolbox pack.

392
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:09,760
And for Ruby, I tend to use RubyMine rather than just VS Code

393
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:14,720
because I like just more of the assistance and I'm used to it.

394
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:17,440
It doesn't replace that.

395
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:21,760
It is in a lot of ways a direct competitor to VS Code.

396
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:24,160
In fact, I would just say it is a direct competitor to VS Code.

397
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:27,520
Think of it as Sublime Text 3 on steroids.

398
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:33,600
I think if you are deep in the JetBrains experience, if you just hate Electron,

399
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:40,320
if you just don't like Microsoft, you probably want to take a look at this.

400
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:41,840
This is what's painful for me, right?

401
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,200
I felt this way about Nova too.

402
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,160
Nova from the Panic guys, they're a Mac native editor.

403
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:49,200
There's absolutely nothing wrong with Fleet or Nova.

404
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:51,680
They're really great products.

405
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:53,840
But VS Code exists.

406
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:58,960
VS Code is free and has taken so much of the mindshare on the market share that the plugin

407
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:05,120
story, I don't even wonder if some weird file or some weird things a customer wants me to

408
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:07,760
look at, will VS Code have a plugin?

409
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:09,040
They always do.

410
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:10,000
And it's always good.

411
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:14,160
So I don't know where that leaves us, but a little sad, I guess,

412
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:17,120
because market domination by a behemoth.

413
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:20,960
Yeah, it sounds like you feel there's not really a place for it.

414
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:23,600
It doesn't quite fit anywhere.

415
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,280
It doesn't.

416
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:28,800
So the part of this that I'm sure if anybody from JetBrains is listening to that I'm

417
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:34,640
kind of ignoring because I just don't believe in it, is they have this whole story about

418
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:37,680
spinning up instances of Fleet as like web IDs.

419
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:41,040
We've covered those kind of tools for years, right, Chris?

420
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:44,640
I mean, we did, what was it, Cloud 9?

421
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:45,680
Cloud, yeah.

422
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:46,480
A bunch of them.

423
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:47,440
I can't even remember.

424
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,560
And also VS Code can do that too, right?

425
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:53,040
There are versions of VS Code just running as a node server.

426
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:56,560
I just don't think that's that strong of a use case.

427
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:58,400
And I've had conversations with people.

428
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,120
I'll give you an example.

429
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:00,880
I like the warp terminal on Mac.

430
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,960
I wish I could get a Linux copy of it.

431
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:07,200
Those guys seem to feel pretty strongly that it's more important to get their web-based

432
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,720
distributed terminal up and running.

433
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:10,960
I don't see it, right?

434
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:13,760
This may be one of the things where we're super right about Docker.

435
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:17,680
I might be super wrong about this, but I just don't think your whole Dev

436
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:19,440
stack is going to go into Chrome.

437
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,040
I don't think it's going to go into the web.

438
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:23,280
I mean, is it a web app or is it a native app?

439
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:27,360
Because it seemed to me like kind of the conversation around this was how do we build

440
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:28,960
something that doesn't use Electron?

441
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,480
Well, they've got some weird...

442
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:34,400
So the big problem is their cloud features are quote-unquote coming soon.

443
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:37,520
So to answer your question, I can't really answer it, right?

444
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:39,360
It sounds like a cloud 9 to me.

445
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:39,840
Yeah.

446
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:43,760
They have deep integration with Spaces, which is their own product management tool, which

447
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:49,360
again, if you are deep in the JetBrains ecosystem, then this probably has a lot of just like

448
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:51,680
process advantages for you that make a lot of sense.

449
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:56,320
Yeah, and they pitch things like that collaborative editing just being built in, being native

450
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,960
and then, yeah, integrating with all of those products, like you say.

451
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,240
But so is VS Code, right?

452
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:01,200
Live Share.

453
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:05,280
KP in the chat room says, unfortunately, I feel the same way about JetBrains' issue tracker.

454
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:09,760
A lot of niceties, but I just can't compare with the mindshare of GitHub, GitLab, and

455
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:10,720
Jira and Bitbucket.

456
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:12,800
It's like it's the network effect.

457
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:19,920
But the reason why that's sad is that means they're basically entrenched until they kill

458
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:20,400
their own money.

459
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:27,440
Yeah, I mean, VS Code is, well, one, before we all, you know, render our garments, nothing

460
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,240
is eternal.

461
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:28,560
Yeah.

462
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:32,880
I mean, people couldn't have imagined TextMate being abandoned and dying.

463
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,640
It just kind of was, right?

464
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:35,120
It happened.

465
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:39,440
I know there was a TextMate 3 at some point, I believe, but no, was there?

466
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,520
Was that like an open source, like community thing?

467
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,520
Well, Vim never dies, so I don't know what you're talking about.

468
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:46,160
But I would argue Vim is almost like a utility.

469
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:47,200
Yeah, I'm just kidding.

470
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,480
And nobody's buying Vim.

471
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:48,720
Right.

472
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:52,720
I wanted to love this so much just because I want it to be kind of a hipster too.

473
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:56,960
But it just doesn't make a ton of sense.

474
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:58,880
Interesting problem.

475
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:03,600
And I'm curious, just to kind of top this off, what are your thoughts?

476
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:06,720
If they don't open source this, does this have even less of a shot?

477
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:08,800
I don't think they should open source it.

478
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:10,960
You know where this has a shot?

479
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,320
I'll tell you exactly where this has a shot.

480
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:17,520
Corporate environments that have the JetBrains corporate licenses with strict IT that the

481
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,520
developers can't install their own tools.

482
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:20,720
Sure, good market.

483
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,080
This would be the closest thing.

484
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,440
This would be the VS Code.

485
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,760
So I don't think this product's DOA.

486
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:30,160
I just think if you are an independent developer or someone who gets to make the decision,

487
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:36,400
VS Code does everything you want to do and presumably will continue the, frankly, just

488
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:40,560
insane rate of plugin development and will do more things that you may want to do in

489
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:41,760
the future for free.

490
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:45,600
God, that sucks.

491
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:49,360
Honestly, it's the Google Docs problem, right?

492
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:52,560
Why is there no innovation around word processing and spreadsheets?

493
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:54,400
Well, because Google Docs is free.

494
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:54,880
Yeah.

495
00:24:54,880 --> 00:25:00,240
And Microsoft Office is, for many people who buy a Windows computer, effectively free

496
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:00,960
in some form.

497
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:04,160
Why is there no great Linux mobile operating system?

498
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:06,400
Because Android is free and Android's good enough.

499
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:07,360
People can just use that.

500
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:08,640
Where's my Ubuntu TV?

501
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:09,120
Yep.

502
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,880
Where is your damn Ubuntu TV?

503
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:13,200
Tailscale.com slash coder.

504
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,760
You know, people ask me all the time, they say, Chris, what's your secret?

505
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:16,960
Tailscale, I say.

506
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:20,080
That's where I go to sign up for free for up to 20 devices.

507
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:21,440
It's a great way to support the show, too.

508
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:22,960
Tailscale.com slash coder.

509
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:28,560
You get yourself a zero config VPN that you can get deployed on any of your devices in

510
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:29,760
just minutes.

511
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:36,800
Raspberry Pi, your phone, your VPS, your VM, your various desktops with your crazy setups,

512
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:40,640
it all works with your carrier grade net, your firewall rules.

513
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:41,840
It's smart in how it routes.

514
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:46,000
So it's not just like blasting all of your machine's traffic through the tunnel.

515
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,480
It's the stuff you need to go to the Tailscale network.

516
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,960
Everything else routes through your regular connection.

517
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:53,280
You can leave it connected 24-7.

518
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:56,320
It knows how to route the traffic intelligently.

519
00:25:56,320 --> 00:26:01,680
Something else that Tailscale does that I love is it realizes when two of your nodes

520
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:03,200
are on the same LAN.

521
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:08,320
So if you're talking Tailscale IP to Tailscale IP, it doesn't like route it out to the internet

522
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:09,360
and back in.

523
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:11,120
It goes direct over the LAN.

524
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:12,560
It's so smart.

525
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:17,520
And now, Tailscale SSH allows you to establish SSH connections between your devices in your

526
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:21,760
Tailscale network as you've already set up using your Tailscale access controls.

527
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:24,080
You don't have to manage the SSH keys.

528
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:28,480
It'll authenticate your SSH connection using Wirecard.

529
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:29,600
It's so great.

530
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:32,000
And Tailscale Send, it's kind of like the same thing.

531
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,840
Tailscale Send, it's kind of like AirDrop, but over the Tailscale network to all your

532
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:42,880
Tailscale devices, including your GNU slash Linux boxes and your Windows boxes, you know?

533
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:46,480
I don't know what you run, but Tailscale Send works on all of them, including the command

534
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:50,720
line, which is so handy on a headless server sometimes.

535
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:51,760
So handy.

536
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:56,080
I recently used that to copy my Nix config over to a brand new setup.

537
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:58,960
Get it on there, because Tailscale is like one of the first things I always set up, guys.

538
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,400
It's so great.

539
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:03,760
And you know, copy the config over using Tailscale Send, rebuild the box, my whole workstation

540
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:04,760
set up.

541
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:05,760
It's so awesome.

542
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:09,360
Oh, I could go on forever, but I'll just end with this.

543
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:12,240
Go to tailscale.com slash coder.

544
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:13,440
It's going to change your game.

545
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:18,480
When you're famous and you're walking down the red carpet because your game is so changed,

546
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:19,480
they're going to ask you.

547
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:23,720
They're going to say, hey, you, listener of Coder Radio, what's your secret?

548
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:31,000
And you're going to say, Tailscale, tailscale.com slash coder.

549
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
All right.

550
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,520
I didn't see this one coming, but I think it makes a lot of sense for them.

551
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:37,660
Speaking of consolidation, yes.

552
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:46,000
Adobe has bought Figma for 20 billion, oh, come on, billion, billion pickies up.

553
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,000
Yep.

554
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:50,300
The thing is, it's kind of the same story we were just talking about.

555
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:55,200
It's a tooling story, and it's about, in this case, proactively protecting their market

556
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,200
share.

557
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:59,320
In other words, taking the old yeller behind grandpa's shed and putting a bullet in the

558
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:00,320
back of its head.

559
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:01,320
Yes.

560
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:02,320
Yeah.

561
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:05,640
It reminds me of when the old car companies would buy the little upstart electric company

562
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:10,280
and then just suppress everything they had done, and it goes nowhere.

563
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:11,280
Here's your money.

564
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:12,280
Yeah.

565
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:13,280
Here's an NDA.

566
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:14,280
Now, shut the fuck up.

567
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:15,280
Right.

568
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:16,280
There you go.

569
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:20,080
The acquisition will allow Adobe to incorporate Figma's popular design tools into its widely

570
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:22,320
used portfolio of creative apps.

571
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:25,200
I just want to say the Adobe PR team ought to be fired.

572
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:28,540
They were so close to an amazing Borg reference.

573
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:33,100
All they had to change was incorporate to assimilate, and they were right there.

574
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:36,300
Your biological and technological distinctiveness will become our own.

575
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:37,300
Browser-based technologies.

576
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:39,360
Your life will adapt to service us.

577
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:40,360
To service us.

578
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:43,720
We will rebrand it Adobe Photoshop Lite.

579
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:50,320
They had to do this because what Figma is is a set of design tools designed to replace

580
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:54,520
Adobe and do it better in a collaborative way.

581
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:59,360
That's what Figma is all about, and so that's why they're getting $20 billion, not necessarily

582
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:02,160
because their product was necessarily worth it.

583
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:08,980
I guess Figma hit $400 million in annual revenue, but $20 billion is sort of Adobe's defensive

584
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:14,800
acquisition because they just can't afford to lose that market, and they need that tooling.

585
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:19,700
What do you do when what's succeeding in the market is a tool that's been specifically

586
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:24,840
designed to oust you from small and medium businesses?

587
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:25,840
They were screwed.

588
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:33,360
They panicked, and they spent $20 billion right before a possible tech recession.

589
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:39,400
We may look back at this in nine months or a year and laugh that they spent $20 billion

590
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:43,360
to acquire a company making $400 million.

591
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:49,920
So they spent $20 billion to smother the nearest real competitor to them, and before everybody

592
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:53,320
writes in about Sketch and Acorn, I'm aware of them, but let's be honest.

593
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:54,880
It's not the same.

594
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:59,640
I don't think Adobe's crazy for doing this because one, it's funny money anyway, right?

595
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:02,240
Yeah, I suppose if you've got the money to burn.

596
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:07,160
And to me, the weird thing, I read a bunch of coverage about this, and only one guy in

597
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:12,560
my mind got it right, and I don't remember his name because I suck, but he was the only

598
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:19,160
one to mention the other side of this transaction, the Figma board and the Figma founders, and

599
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:23,960
most importantly, ye olde investors who want ye olde exit.

600
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:28,520
The IPO market, it's dead, Jim.

601
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:29,520
It's dead.

602
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:32,160
Yeah, I think you're thinking of at Jay Finance on Twitter.

603
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:33,880
I think I am, yeah.

604
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:38,640
So these guys, first of all, they sold at their high, right?

605
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:42,860
This is the old, get off the stage while they're still clapping and throwing panties at you.

606
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:43,860
Good work, Figma.

607
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:44,860
Very savvy.

608
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:45,860
Very, very savvy.

609
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:47,220
This was the right move for Figma.

610
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:48,360
It's naive to...

611
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:51,600
I think, honestly, in the next couple months, we're going to see a lot more of this kind

612
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:57,560
of thing because the valuations, we've talked about this a lot, but the valuations on a

613
00:30:57,560 --> 00:31:01,340
lot of these types of SaaS companies are so crazy.

614
00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:06,440
Another big thing for Adobe, why they went to the creative cloud, is the multiples that

615
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:12,880
Wall Street gives you on your share price for SaaS is roughly double, I think, of just

616
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:14,960
like regular revenue.

617
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:22,480
So they may make this 20 billion up in a couple of years, if not less, by having Figma.

618
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:29,920
And just honestly, rebranding it to Adobe Art Studio Cloud or whatever, I'm sure the

619
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:34,360
name will suck, but people will buy it.

620
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:38,760
I know lots of people, myself included, who have an Adobe subscription and are happy about

621
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:41,840
it, but it's the standard, right?

622
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:44,680
If somebody is going to send you a file, they're going to send you an Illustrator file or a

623
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:45,680
Photoshop file.

624
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:46,680
Absolutely.

625
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:47,680
It is.

626
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:49,560
It's just the way it goes.

627
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:50,560
Should this be allowed to happen?

628
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:51,560
I don't know.

629
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:53,000
Ask Lena Kahn.

630
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:56,200
If I was the founder of Figma, would I have done this?

631
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:59,480
You bet your sweet gungan ass I would have.

632
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:00,480
Yeah.

633
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:01,480
Oh, man.

634
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:05,880
I mean, they are set for life.

635
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:07,520
There is that element to this.

636
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:08,520
His name is Dylan Field.

637
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:10,920
He's the CEO of Figma.

638
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:15,040
Him and his leadership team, their families are set for life now.

639
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:16,040
Champagne, baby.

640
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:17,040
Cristal.

641
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:18,040
Let's do it.

642
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:19,040
Yeah.

643
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:20,040
They're rich.

644
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:21,040
They're rich.

645
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:23,400
Figma has eliminated a competitor.

646
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:27,480
They can put it behind their paywall and offer it as a branded Adobe product that they really

647
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:28,560
should probably have.

648
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:31,280
And most importantly, Figma no longer exists.

649
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:32,280
Yeah.

650
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:35,000
Again, it's like, okay, this is the way this goes.

651
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,960
This is probably their best option.

652
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:37,960
This has happened before.

653
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:39,800
Just the numbers got bigger, right?

654
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:41,240
Instagram, Facebook.

655
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:44,840
How many spreadsheet companies has Microsoft managed to buy and destroy?

656
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:47,840
Don't you think, too, though, there's something about the fact that what Figma was successful

657
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:52,120
at was building really good design apps for the web?

658
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:53,120
These are web apps.

659
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:54,120
Yeah.

660
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:57,040
Well, Adobe has been making mouth noises about doing web apps, too.

661
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:58,040
I wonder if that's a factor.

662
00:32:58,040 --> 00:32:59,040
I'm sure it is.

663
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:03,400
But I'm just saying they just paid $20 billion for a company that makes mostly web apps.

664
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:05,640
I mean, they make other stuff, but they make mostly web apps.

665
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:07,560
$20 billion for web apps.

666
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:08,560
Yeah.

667
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:09,560
Good.

668
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:11,960
I mean, nobody does anything for one reason, right?

669
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:17,000
They pay $20 billion for probably the web know-how and the application itself.

670
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:20,480
And of that, $19 billion was to kill a competitor.

671
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:21,480
That's fine.

672
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:22,480
Yeah.

673
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:23,480
Right.

674
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:24,480
Exactly.

675
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:25,480
Yeah.

676
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:26,480
One billion was for the tech.

677
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:27,480
Nineteen billion was to kill them.

678
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:28,480
I completely agree.

679
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:31,880
I just think it's kind of to your point where everything eventually reverts back to the

680
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:33,360
web.

681
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:39,520
And this is a $20 billion bet by Adobe that web apps are ultimately the direction all

682
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:40,920
platforms are going.

683
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:47,480
The web, I think, is just the front end of the future, quote, TM Mike Dominic defined

684
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:52,480
as the next five years, right?

685
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:55,920
We don't have this on the doc, but I've been digging into Oculus development a little bit.

686
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:56,920
Oh, interesting.

687
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:57,920
Yeah.

688
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:58,920
Disappointing.

689
00:33:58,920 --> 00:33:59,920
Yeah.

690
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:00,920
Yeah.

691
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:04,240
It's just icky, right?

692
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:08,520
Once you're used to the freedom of the open web, once you're in a commercial where you're

693
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:13,720
cracking open a Bud Light, driving on your Harley in a denim jacket, towing a Ford.

694
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:15,280
Well, of course you have an F-150.

695
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:17,280
I mean, how could you not?

696
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:18,800
And none of this electric crap, right?

697
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:19,800
I want diesel.

698
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:20,800
Yeah.

699
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:21,800
I don't know, man.

700
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:22,800
It's pretty expensive right now.

701
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:27,440
No, I just filled up my car, my sedan, and I was like, hmm, maybe I could just walk.

702
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:28,440
Yeah.

703
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:33,440
This road trip, the federal rate is like 78 cents or something like that for reimbursement,

704
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:38,360
but I just don't think it's going to cover it because, you know, the RV gets eight, nine,

705
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:43,360
ten miles per gallon, and we're going to the bottom of California.

706
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:44,360
That's going to cost a lot of money.

707
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:45,360
It's going to be expensive.

708
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:46,360
Gas is just going to...

709
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:50,680
And it's in, at least in the continuous states, it's like the state with the most expensive

710
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:51,720
gas too.

711
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:52,720
It's going to be a disaster.

712
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:53,720
Well, you know, California.

713
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:56,520
But we do it because we love the people.

714
00:34:56,520 --> 00:35:00,600
You know, I go to California not because I want to go to California, but because we love

715
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:03,280
the people and we're going to go to JPO.

716
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:05,160
That's going to be a lot of fun.

717
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:08,880
It'll be fascinating to see where this goes, you know, and what other consolidations we

718
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:11,800
see because I think you're right.

719
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:16,220
These companies that can get access to big money or have been sitting on big money, there's

720
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:17,840
some companies that are ready to sell.

721
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:19,640
And these startups that can't IPO now.

722
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:21,460
That's really the...

723
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:25,800
It's the thing is the, you know, this is like the middle school dance.

724
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:28,060
There's just not many dancing partners left.

725
00:35:28,060 --> 00:35:29,860
The girls might say yes now.

726
00:35:29,860 --> 00:35:31,480
That's making the startups.

727
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:33,720
My middle school was Catholic school, so it was kind of weird.

728
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:37,520
But yeah, I don't know, a bunch of the other sort like Snap.

729
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:41,680
I know he went on stage at Code and said he's not for sale.

730
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:42,680
Snap's for sale.

731
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:43,680
Right.

732
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:47,800
So is the weird one where people like to do like their wish boards or whatever.

733
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:48,800
I can't remember the name.

734
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:51,300
It's one of the social labs.

735
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:52,720
There's a bunch of them that are...

736
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:54,200
Everything's for sale now.

737
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:58,000
Everything's in play except for Twitter because I don't know what's happening over there,

738
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,800
but every day it just seems to be getting worse.

739
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:09,000
The Marchi boosted in with one, two, three, four sets on the topic of uniforms.

740
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:13,240
I've lived a less strict form of this for a while, and I think it's valuable for saving

741
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:14,440
brain cycles.

742
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:21,800
I have five plus black v-neck t-shirts and five plus black button down long sleeve shirts.

743
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:25,120
It's hard to think of an occasion when you can't wear one of those.

744
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:27,400
Making a morning selection just easy.

745
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:30,200
I say it's a little less strict because it's not always a hard and fast rule.

746
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:32,960
It's just a default selection that I can always fall back to.

747
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:34,720
Other outfits can still be used.

748
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:38,640
I'd recommend to Chris, just buy lots of one top that you like.

749
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:39,640
That's nice and simple, Marchi.

750
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:44,440
You know, Mike, I've been thinking, I actually think for folks that are working from home

751
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:51,320
too, the uniform lifestyle seems like the perfect compromise because it's ridiculous.

752
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:54,560
When you're working from home, it's this fine line of, do I get dressed?

753
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:56,140
How presentable do I want to feel?

754
00:36:56,140 --> 00:36:59,360
If you have video meetings, there's all these factors.

755
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:03,440
And so again, a uniform makes the work from home lifestyle easier too.

756
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:05,360
Thank you, Marchi.

757
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:08,760
Trev Dev boosted in with a row of ducks.

758
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:13,200
But honest and truly, I am Robin Hood.

759
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:14,360
We were talking about dynamic ads.

760
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:16,400
He says, the jokes on the crappy advertisers.

761
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:23,360
I may be 38, but I went bald at 23 and all I need is my imagination and my razor.

762
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:24,520
What about a bed?

763
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:26,260
Could we sell you on a new bed?

764
00:37:26,260 --> 00:37:29,060
You order a bed online, they ship a tea in a box.

765
00:37:29,060 --> 00:37:33,120
They'll never get it back in that box, but they will let you ship it back to them somehow

766
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:34,600
for free if you don't like it.

767
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:39,280
After you get it all set up, you get your clothes on there, you make your mess on it

768
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:43,580
and you decide you don't like it, they'll let you box it back up somehow and ship it

769
00:37:43,580 --> 00:37:45,200
back to them for free.

770
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:46,200
Somehow.

771
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:49,440
Can I sell you on that, Trev Dev?

772
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,440
That's it.

773
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:51,440
That's all the boost we got.

774
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:53,000
See, people don't like the shows you do when you're sick so they don't boost it.

775
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,000
I know.

776
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,640
They're mourning for me or they're playing MTG Arena.

777
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:58,640
That could be it.

778
00:37:58,640 --> 00:37:59,640
That's probably it.

779
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:00,960
We actually did get some boosts that just didn't make it on air.

780
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,720
I wanted to say thank you.

781
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:04,200
Everybody who does boost in, we read all of them.

782
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:05,600
A couple of shout outs.

783
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:10,240
Jabber Crowley boosted in 500 just saying thanks for the show.

784
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:13,720
Noob Steve boosted, and I'll share this with you privately.

785
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:18,660
He boosted in 4,444 SATs to give us a little more details about Red Hat Linux on those

786
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:20,920
drone systems.

787
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:21,920
Some specifics.

788
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:25,760
But he thought maybe for security purposes we probably shouldn't discuss those bits on

789
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:26,760
air.

790
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:27,760
It's nothing specific.

791
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:29,000
Like no big secrets.

792
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:32,200
But you know, why get into operational security stuff if we don't need to?

793
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:34,800
But we did get more details on where RHEL is used.

794
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,480
And the short answer is everywhere.

795
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:37,480
You were right.

796
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:38,480
Everything.

797
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:39,480
All of it.

798
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:40,480
Off the bottom.

799
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:41,480
Even the things in the sky.

800
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:42,480
Wow.

801
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:45,000
Also, I wanted to say hi to Willy Ramas.

802
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,520
I think that's how you say it.

803
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:47,800
I thank everybody who boosted in.

804
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:50,360
You can do so by getting a new podcast app.

805
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:51,360
Upgrade to a new podcasting.

806
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:52,360
Turn it over.

807
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:53,360
Compatible app at newpodcastapps.com.

808
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:55,360
I also like Fountain FM specifically.

809
00:38:55,360 --> 00:39:01,400
I'll have a link to my profile in the notes where you can follow my boosts and my clips

810
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:02,960
and the ones I do.

811
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:04,000
Or go try Podverse.

812
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,000
The totally GPL one.

813
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:08,660
It's available for Android, iOS, the web, and F-Droid.

814
00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:09,840
And a big thank you to our members.

815
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:11,960
Coderly will be coming your way soon, I suppose.

816
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:13,200
We may have to do it while I'm on the road.

817
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:14,200
Oh yeah.

818
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:15,200
I'm not sure.

819
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,200
We'll figure out a time.

820
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:19,960
But every quarter we do a Coderly report for our members as a special thank you.

821
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:21,600
A little exclusive content for them.

822
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:24,200
They also get an ad-free version of the show.

823
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:29,640
You can go invest in our content production at coderqa.co or all of the shows at jupyter.party.

824
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:31,680
All right.

825
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:34,280
It's exciting.

826
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:36,560
I'm not freaking out at all about leaving right now.

827
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:38,480
I'm not panicked that we're not ready.

828
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:39,480
I'm not freaking out.

829
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:40,480
I promise.

830
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:43,240
Is there anywhere you want to send people before I go have my panic attack?

831
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:44,240
Wow.

832
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:45,240
Wow.

833
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:47,120
Caught me with that one.

834
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:49,840
Just follow me at Dumanuco on Twitter.

835
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:54,320
And I have a special super-duper thing coming out on dominicm.com tomorrow.

836
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:56,400
You will probably be interested in it.

837
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:57,960
You dirty, dirty hippies.

838
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:58,960
Definitely.

839
00:39:58,960 --> 00:39:59,960
Definitely.

840
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:02,000
I think I know what it is and I recommend.

841
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,320
I definitely recommend.

842
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:04,480
All right.

843
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:05,560
That does wrap it up.

844
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:09,880
You can find me on the Twitters at chrisles, the podcast at Coder Radio Show.

845
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:13,040
Our matrix chat room that's going all the time and during our live streams.

846
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:14,040
That's at coder.show.matrix.

847
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:19,800
And of course, we're live on Mondays, 9 a.m. Pacific, noon Eastern at jupyter.com.

848
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:25,760
And links to what we talked about today, those are at coder.show slash 484.

849
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:31,640
You'll find our contact page over there, our subscribe page, all of that goodie right there.

850
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:32,640
It's nice and easy.

851
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:34,880
It's called a web page.

852
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:35,880
Maybe it's a web app now.

853
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:36,880
You tell me.

854
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:37,880
Coder.show slash contact.

855
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:38,880
Thanks for joining us.

856
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:48,640
See you right back here next week.
