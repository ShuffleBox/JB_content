This is Kota Radio, episode 385 for October 26th, 2020.

00:30.000 --> 00:35.940
Hello friends and welcome into Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show, taking a pragmatic look

00:35.940 --> 00:39.920
at the art and business of software development and the world of technology.

00:39.920 --> 00:41.720
This episode is brought to you by a cloud guru.

00:41.720 --> 00:44.520
So many career possibilities in the cloud and so little time.

00:44.520 --> 00:48.120
ACG's learning paths help you take the right course to prepare for architect, developer,

00:48.120 --> 00:50.720
security and many other high paying cloud jobs.

00:50.720 --> 00:54.720
Get hired, get certified, get learning, a cloud guru.com.

00:54.720 --> 00:59.060
My name is Chris and joining us stationed in his podcasting bunker in the heart of Florida,

00:59.060 --> 01:00.640
it is our host, Mr. Dominic.

01:00.640 --> 01:01.640
Hello, Mike.

01:01.640 --> 01:02.640
Hello, Chris.

01:02.640 --> 01:03.640
How are you today?

01:03.640 --> 01:04.640
I'm all right.

01:04.640 --> 01:05.640
How are you doing?

01:05.640 --> 01:06.640
I am.

01:06.640 --> 01:08.000
Well, I was OK.

01:08.000 --> 01:10.660
Yeah, then NASA made an announcement.

01:10.660 --> 01:12.140
They found water on the moon.

01:12.140 --> 01:15.720
I'm not saying it's aliens, but you know, if you were an alien, where would you stash

01:15.720 --> 01:17.200
your ice on the moon?

01:17.200 --> 01:18.200
Right.

01:18.200 --> 01:19.200
Because otherwise, those dirty humans are going to get to it.

01:19.200 --> 01:21.200
But hey, hey, Chris, moon teenies.

01:21.200 --> 01:22.200
Exactly.

01:22.200 --> 01:23.760
That's what I'm thinking.

01:23.760 --> 01:25.940
Now we know we're going to go work on the moon one day.

01:25.940 --> 01:28.240
It's just a matter of when work from home.

01:28.240 --> 01:29.240
Work from the moon.

01:29.240 --> 01:32.240
Is it working if the aliens have us in prison camps?

01:32.240 --> 01:33.240
I'm just saying.

01:33.240 --> 01:34.240
Right.

01:34.240 --> 01:37.520
Actually, you know, I think the low gravity situation might be better on my RSI.

01:37.520 --> 01:40.400
So, you know, write off.

01:40.400 --> 01:42.000
True.

01:42.000 --> 01:43.520
How will it affect mechanical keyboards?

01:43.520 --> 01:45.280
Like will the cherry blue still be?

01:45.280 --> 01:46.280
Yeah.

01:46.280 --> 01:47.280
Yeah.

01:47.280 --> 01:48.280
Will they have that same kind of clack?

01:48.280 --> 01:49.280
I'm not so sure they would.

01:49.280 --> 01:51.360
So just a little bit of a Martian bacon real quick.

01:51.360 --> 01:52.360
Sure.

01:52.360 --> 01:55.040
I mean, you know, I always prepare the bacon here for you.

01:55.040 --> 01:56.600
I've got it all ready to go.

01:56.600 --> 01:59.640
Those who don't listen to unfilter should go listen to unfilter.

01:59.640 --> 02:02.440
But he's not even this conspiratorial.

02:02.440 --> 02:05.120
So within the last year, let's see.

02:05.120 --> 02:10.720
We've had several announcements from NASA regarding Mars, now the moon, and we very

02:10.720 --> 02:14.080
quickly ramped up something called Space Force.

02:14.080 --> 02:15.080
Sure.

02:15.080 --> 02:16.720
Let me tell you Mike's crazy thing.

02:16.720 --> 02:17.720
Here's what happened.

02:17.720 --> 02:21.360
Rudy Giuliani and Donald Trump were in a hotel room, right?

02:21.360 --> 02:24.560
They thought they were meeting someone to quote, interview them.

02:24.560 --> 02:25.560
Sure.

02:25.560 --> 02:28.000
They thought that person ripped off their meat suit and was an alien.

02:28.000 --> 02:29.000
Yeah.

02:29.000 --> 02:30.240
What are you going to do when that happens?

02:30.240 --> 02:32.180
They promptly crapped their pants.

02:32.180 --> 02:33.180
That's what I would do.

02:33.180 --> 02:37.640
And Trump formed Space Force, which he did correctly because this is going to be the

02:37.640 --> 02:39.440
craziest episode of Quota Radio.

02:39.440 --> 02:43.840
I am a firm believer that there will be alien contact within my life.

02:43.840 --> 02:45.880
Oh, that would be so amazing.

02:45.880 --> 02:46.880
It's gotta be.

02:46.880 --> 02:48.920
Why are all of a sudden all this stuff is coming out?

02:48.920 --> 02:53.200
I like your crap the pants theory, but I feel like you could work in Elon somehow, you know,

02:53.200 --> 02:56.000
with SpaceX and Starlink.

02:56.000 --> 02:58.280
So how do we know Elon is himself not an alien?

02:58.280 --> 02:59.280
Right.

02:59.280 --> 03:00.280
Of course.

03:00.280 --> 03:01.280
You know what?

03:01.280 --> 03:02.280
He seems-

03:02.280 --> 03:03.280
He has this technology nobody else does.

03:03.280 --> 03:04.280
I'm just saying.

03:04.280 --> 03:05.280
Mm-hmm.

03:05.280 --> 03:06.280
He's talking about tunnels all the time.

03:06.280 --> 03:07.280
You know, aliens love to live on the ground.

03:07.280 --> 03:10.360
I mean, if you haven't played Resistance on the PS3, it's basically what I believe.

03:10.360 --> 03:11.360
Right.

03:11.360 --> 03:15.440
So this doesn't have anything to do with your new coffee club subscription, does it?

03:15.440 --> 03:20.360
No, but maybe wrong choice starting a coffee club now when going to be on the verge for

03:20.360 --> 03:21.880
perpetual panic attack.

03:21.880 --> 03:22.880
Right.

03:22.880 --> 03:25.360
Well, you want to be caffeinated when the aliens arrive.

03:25.360 --> 03:27.480
You do want to put up some form of fight, right?

03:27.480 --> 03:31.680
Like, you know, I was just kind of thinking to myself, I've got a pretty high rate of

03:31.680 --> 03:36.720
caffeine intake still these days, and mostly it comes in chilled forms, and that just sucks

03:36.720 --> 03:37.720
in the winter.

03:37.720 --> 03:41.300
You know, just it's below freezing outside, and I'm walking out the door with a sugar-free

03:41.300 --> 03:45.080
Red Bull or, God forbid, sparkling water with a caffeine pill.

03:45.080 --> 03:48.600
I mean, I'm an animal these days, and I got to get my act together.

03:48.600 --> 03:52.560
I really got to... If I'm going to caffeinate, I need to caffeinate like a gentleman.

03:52.560 --> 03:53.920
You could still drink Red Bull?

03:53.920 --> 03:55.480
I do the sugar-free Red Bull, yeah.

03:55.480 --> 03:56.480
Oh, yeah.

03:56.480 --> 03:57.480
I drink Red Bull.

03:57.480 --> 03:58.480
I'm shaking like a crack fiend.

03:58.480 --> 03:59.480
Like, it's... Yeah.

03:59.480 --> 04:02.160
I'd have to have like four of those suckers.

04:02.160 --> 04:03.160
Wow, man.

04:03.160 --> 04:04.160
You're... Okay.

04:04.160 --> 04:05.160
Yeah.

04:05.160 --> 04:10.280
Yeah, the caffeine pills are like 200 milligrams when I pop a caffeine pill.

04:10.280 --> 04:16.200
You know, I developed an intense caffeine tolerance when I had sleep apnea, and I've

04:16.200 --> 04:22.280
actually backed off for the last year since I got a CPAP, but, you know, for 10 years,

04:22.280 --> 04:26.960
I developed a Medicaid-through-caffeine approach to the first half of my day.

04:26.960 --> 04:28.240
You know, it's tough.

04:28.240 --> 04:29.240
That kind of habit.

04:29.240 --> 04:30.240
Cold turkey, you know?

04:30.240 --> 04:31.240
No.

04:31.240 --> 04:32.240
The withdrawals would be intense, I'm sure.

04:32.240 --> 04:33.240
Yeah.

04:33.240 --> 04:35.820
See, now I'm just trying to find ways that are like a little more healthy to get that

04:35.820 --> 04:39.080
caffeine fix, and so I've tapered way back on the Red Bull.

04:39.080 --> 04:44.200
What I actually have done, for the most part, is a regime that I take in the morning with

04:44.200 --> 04:50.200
a SodaStream and some bubbly water and a caffeine pill and a B12 supplement and little Mooshrooms

04:50.200 --> 04:55.520
in there, too, to help me get the brain cognitive going, and that's kind of my go-out-the-door

04:55.520 --> 04:56.520
solution.

04:56.520 --> 05:00.920
But in the winter, a cold glass of bubbly water in the morning is not as refreshing

05:00.920 --> 05:03.780
as it is in the summer.

05:03.780 --> 05:06.320
So when you said a coffee club, I was like, well, son of a bitch, that's actually kind

05:06.320 --> 05:07.320
of a good idea.

05:07.320 --> 05:08.320
I don't know.

05:08.320 --> 05:09.320
I'm tempted.

05:09.320 --> 05:11.240
Have you got your first bag yet, or is it too early?

05:11.240 --> 05:15.560
It's too early, although they said they shipped it, so in theory, I could have it before next

05:15.560 --> 05:16.560
week.

05:16.560 --> 05:17.560
But it's a weird deal.

05:17.560 --> 05:20.560
They do single-origin coffee from different regions.

05:20.560 --> 05:23.440
You get to pick the roast and all of that before they ship it to you, which I think

05:23.440 --> 05:24.440
is kind of cool.

05:24.440 --> 05:25.440
Yeah.

05:25.440 --> 05:26.440
Yeah.

05:26.440 --> 05:29.280
So I'm in love with my AeroPress because...

05:29.280 --> 05:31.280
It does make the best cup of coffee.

05:31.280 --> 05:34.720
Like any other addict, I quit coffee briefly, and then when I went back, I...

05:34.720 --> 05:35.720
You went hard.

05:35.720 --> 05:36.720
Went super hard.

05:36.720 --> 05:37.720
Yeah.

05:37.720 --> 05:38.720
Right.

05:38.720 --> 05:39.720
I have burned myself several times.

05:39.720 --> 05:40.720
Yeah?

05:40.720 --> 05:41.720
So...

05:41.720 --> 05:43.880
I think I actually damaged my countertop a little bit in the RV.

05:43.880 --> 05:44.880
I have stains, yeah.

05:44.880 --> 05:50.240
Because they're not built super well, so I'm sitting there wrenching on the AeroPress.

05:50.240 --> 05:53.960
For those of you who don't know, you press down on it, and that pressing down motion

05:53.960 --> 05:57.320
every morning on your countertop does damage after a while.

05:57.320 --> 05:58.320
So I gave it up.

05:58.320 --> 06:03.640
I'm frequently tempted to just go back to the traditional French press and not burn

06:03.640 --> 06:04.640
myself, but...

06:04.640 --> 06:08.860
There's got to be some listeners out there that have a pretty solid caffeine regime that

06:08.860 --> 06:12.800
doesn't leave them feeling strung out at the end of the day, so you've got to go to coder.show

06:12.800 --> 06:18.440
slash contact, peanut42 in the chat room says he suggests mate tea or mix the caffeine.

06:18.440 --> 06:23.160
You start with coffee, then you transition to green tea, and then you finish off with

06:23.160 --> 06:24.160
mate.

06:24.160 --> 06:25.160
See, he does...

06:25.160 --> 06:26.160
He has a bit of a regime there.

06:26.160 --> 06:27.160
That's basically what I do.

06:27.160 --> 06:28.400
I literally wean myself.

06:28.400 --> 06:34.120
In the morning, it's a cup of coffee, then it's black tea, then green tea, and by the

06:34.120 --> 06:38.800
end of the day, I'm down to dandelion tea because I'm a hippie, and I believe that...

06:38.800 --> 06:39.800
Right.

06:39.800 --> 06:41.240
Because if you blow it, you mess your sleep up.

06:41.240 --> 06:42.240
Right.

06:42.240 --> 06:47.240
You can't Captain Picard it and have two Earl Grey hot at like 10.30 at night.

06:47.240 --> 06:48.240
No.

06:48.240 --> 06:52.120
If there is anything fake about Star Trek, anything, it's that, that Captain Picard's

06:52.120 --> 06:53.120
drinking tea.

06:53.120 --> 06:54.120
Yes.

06:54.120 --> 06:55.880
That is the one thing that makes no sense.

06:55.880 --> 06:56.880
It's the one thing.

06:56.880 --> 06:57.880
Otherwise, everything's totally explainable.

06:57.880 --> 07:02.080
Well, we got a whole bunch of feedback, a few more on the Dark Matter developer subject,

07:02.080 --> 07:04.200
and we had a reflective Dark Matter dev.

07:04.200 --> 07:07.960
All of these guys, totally understandable and we are happy to accommodate, have asked

07:07.960 --> 07:10.960
to just remain anonymous for, I think, pretty understandable reasons.

07:10.960 --> 07:14.960
So we're leaving everyone anonymous who is a Dark Matter developer that writes in, but

07:14.960 --> 07:18.600
they write, in response to the Dark Matter developer, I worked at a large retailer in

07:18.600 --> 07:20.960
the US on a specific applications team.

07:20.960 --> 07:24.200
It was about 150 people on this development team.

07:24.200 --> 07:31.160
I was the lead DevOps engineer for the team managing 2000 plus VM deployments of Sousa

07:31.160 --> 07:32.160
10.

07:32.160 --> 07:33.160
Yes.

07:33.160 --> 07:35.160
And eventually Sles 11.

07:35.160 --> 07:36.160
Yes.

07:36.160 --> 07:37.160
Although then he quit.

07:37.160 --> 07:40.920
We were doing so well.

07:40.920 --> 07:42.640
That's true.

07:42.640 --> 07:45.360
The company had a strong push to use Java and Angular.

07:45.360 --> 07:47.680
They had an architecture review board.

07:47.680 --> 07:51.000
This is what I thought was fascinating, Mike, is getting some insights into how this actually

07:51.000 --> 07:52.920
works in these large companies.

07:52.920 --> 07:57.960
They had an architecture review board that would approve languages and deployment platforms

07:57.960 --> 08:00.040
that could be used within the company.

08:00.040 --> 08:05.300
Half the company was stuck in the legacy IBM web sphere world, while the other half was

08:05.300 --> 08:09.880
migrating to an on-premises pivotal Cloud Foundry deployment.

08:09.880 --> 08:14.600
The platform team even went to the extent of writing internal Spring Boot initializer

08:14.600 --> 08:19.720
sites that would set up everything from the Maven module all the way to the repo provisioning,

08:19.720 --> 08:22.160
security counts, load balancers, et cetera.

08:22.160 --> 08:26.520
He goes on to say, they limit a lot more than the programming languages, but it does make

08:26.520 --> 08:28.600
shopping for Java devs easy.

08:28.600 --> 08:30.480
So from a hiring standpoint, it works really well for them.

08:30.480 --> 08:35.520
The role I was in somehow allowed for me to bring in some new software, Prometheus, Ansible,

08:35.520 --> 08:42.880
Docker, Node.js, and some Go, but mainstream adoption inside the company was extremely

08:42.880 --> 08:45.640
hard and ruffled a lot of feathers.

08:45.640 --> 08:51.080
But since COVID, the team is looking to move to a full hybrid model, allowing employees

08:51.080 --> 08:53.480
to work remotely permanently.

08:53.480 --> 08:57.960
In short, the company was clear trying to make its strides to be more cloud-native,

08:57.960 --> 09:01.800
but they ended up having a long road in politics that finally beat me down, and that's why

09:01.800 --> 09:04.080
he left, because they were trying to get to cloud-native.

09:04.080 --> 09:08.280
They were trying to get there, but there was just this cult of the old way of doing things.

09:08.280 --> 09:12.880
And you got architecture review boards and platform teams that said all these things,

09:12.880 --> 09:17.200
and you may have some crazy new idea, but they're just not having it.

09:17.200 --> 09:20.680
And he found it extremely frustrating, which is totally understandable.

09:20.680 --> 09:22.320
But thanks for the reflections on that.

09:22.320 --> 09:23.960
I thought that was interesting.

09:23.960 --> 09:29.120
And yet another email where the full-time working at the desk staff are transitioning

09:29.120 --> 09:32.940
to this hybrid work from home work at the office again.

09:32.940 --> 09:37.040
That is a trend we keep seeing in these emails.

09:37.040 --> 09:38.040
You know my bet.

09:38.040 --> 09:41.560
I think there's no going back to the way things were.

09:41.560 --> 09:45.680
We're not going back to 19, right, 21, 22, so forth.

09:45.680 --> 09:47.940
Couldn't smart employers spin this as a benefit, too?

09:47.940 --> 09:48.940
It's a perk.

09:48.940 --> 09:50.200
It's great for you.

09:50.200 --> 09:54.000
It's good for the environment because it means less people are commuting, so now your company

09:54.000 --> 09:58.180
is more green because they're reducing carbon emissions of their employee, and it saves

09:58.180 --> 09:59.180
them on cleaning.

09:59.180 --> 10:00.360
It saves them on office space.

10:00.360 --> 10:01.600
It saves them on cooling costs.

10:01.600 --> 10:03.700
It saves them on snack costs.

10:03.700 --> 10:07.040
It saves them on parking, I mean, just all these areas.

10:07.040 --> 10:08.160
And salary, right?

10:08.160 --> 10:11.720
We didn't cover it on this show, but there was a story, a bunch of the tech companies

10:11.720 --> 10:17.160
who are allowing remote work are, I don't know what the right word, reducing, nerfing,

10:17.160 --> 10:18.160
prorating?

10:18.160 --> 10:19.440
I don't know what should be the right word.

10:19.440 --> 10:23.600
Your salary, if you happen to live in a, I don't know, if you live in Florida, they're

10:23.600 --> 10:28.580
going to pay you a lower wage than they would pay someone in New York or San Francisco.

10:28.580 --> 10:32.600
So that's interesting for the remote team.

10:32.600 --> 10:33.600
There's that, right?

10:33.600 --> 10:34.600
So they can work that angle.

10:34.600 --> 10:39.600
I've also worked with companies where being remote meant we might be based out of Texas

10:39.600 --> 10:46.120
or we might be based out of Utah, but we can hire worldwide.

10:46.120 --> 10:51.160
It opened their options up to a much wider range of developers and skill sets, and it

10:51.160 --> 10:56.640
also meant they could poach people that, say, had moved to California to work for Google

10:56.640 --> 11:00.940
or work for Amazon here in Washington, they could poach those people and just have them

11:00.940 --> 11:01.940
stay there.

11:01.940 --> 11:05.520
They didn't have to relocate, and that was a huge perk for them.

11:05.520 --> 11:09.400
And in a way, I think they had to pay according to the location they live at.

11:09.400 --> 11:13.480
So if they, say, lived in Montana, they'd probably pay them one rate.

11:13.480 --> 11:17.680
And if they lived, say, in San Francisco, they'd pay a different rate.

11:17.680 --> 11:20.620
So they did scale it based on their location, from my recollection.

11:20.620 --> 11:25.520
But it gave them just a much larger pool than just the local folks, for better or for worse.

11:25.520 --> 11:30.640
Yeah, I mean, especially for technical work, I kind of don't see a reason not to.

11:30.640 --> 11:36.280
I really do think the hybrid model of having some sort of HQ where people can get together

11:36.280 --> 11:39.960
if needed, or for more sales-y reasons, right?

11:39.960 --> 11:45.200
But why would you need to house 30 developers in an expensive office and then have to feed

11:45.200 --> 11:46.200
them candy and...

11:46.200 --> 11:47.200
Red Bull.

11:47.200 --> 11:48.200
You know, moon-teenies?

11:48.200 --> 11:55.180
I remember when I first joined, and I'm 100% serious about this, just to give you an idea

11:55.180 --> 11:56.180
of the scale, right?

11:56.180 --> 12:02.080
When I joined Linux Academy, I worked a lot for like four months out of their main office.

12:02.080 --> 12:06.680
And I think their food and snack budget, because they had this always like refilling the fridge

12:06.680 --> 12:12.280
policy and lunches were brought in on Friday, I'm pretty sure they had more money just invested

12:12.280 --> 12:16.000
in doing that than Jupyter Broadcasting made every year.

12:16.000 --> 12:21.840
You know, just that line item expense for them, the snacks and the free lunch week Fridays,

12:21.840 --> 12:25.480
I think probably cost them more in total than all the revenue Jupyter Broadcasting would

12:25.480 --> 12:26.480
earn in a year.

12:26.480 --> 12:28.520
I mean, it was really...

12:28.520 --> 12:29.820
We joke about it, right?

12:29.820 --> 12:34.520
But when you think about how you actually execute that, there is someone in charge of

12:34.520 --> 12:41.040
the office, and she was running to Costco on company time, expensing her gas, using

12:41.040 --> 12:45.540
a company credit card to buy food, and then she was driving it back, she was stocking,

12:45.540 --> 12:47.800
and doing that every single day.

12:47.800 --> 12:50.160
You know, hundreds of dollars each time, every single day.

12:50.160 --> 12:53.440
It is really expensive, and to be able to cut that back matters.

12:53.440 --> 12:59.440
The issue is really here in the States is broadband, and Benny writes in to really make

12:59.440 --> 13:00.440
us feel bad about it.

13:00.440 --> 13:04.000
He says, hey guys, I've been listening from episode one, and just a couple days ago, fan

13:04.000 --> 13:07.600
out your back, so I've been binging all of the episodes.

13:07.600 --> 13:08.660
That's the way to do it, right?

13:08.660 --> 13:09.660
That's right.

13:09.660 --> 13:10.660
And now he's writing in.

13:10.660 --> 13:14.720
He says, I wanted to comment on your data plan issues in the U.S. and brag about mine.

13:14.720 --> 13:19.880
Here in Israel, my plan, which is LTE, I get 500 gigs a month with no limitations.

13:19.880 --> 13:24.400
I can stream PornHub all day long if that floats your boat, and I get free eSIM support

13:24.400 --> 13:25.400
for my Apple Watch.

13:25.400 --> 13:26.400
God damn it.

13:26.400 --> 13:27.400
I know.

13:27.400 --> 13:30.440
For roughly the equivalent of 17 USD.

13:30.440 --> 13:35.360
Other providers might give you like 150 gigs with no eSIM support for just $8, but hey,

13:35.360 --> 13:37.200
you guys got Trump, so it's all good.

13:37.200 --> 13:39.960
Keep being the masters of podcasting while slaying lizards, Benny.

13:39.960 --> 13:40.960
Thank you, Benny.

13:40.960 --> 13:42.560
I agree on the lizards part at least.

13:42.560 --> 13:46.480
I hate everything about that email.

13:46.480 --> 13:48.520
Why can't we have good broadband?

13:48.520 --> 13:50.400
Monopolies, I guess.

13:50.400 --> 13:51.400
I know.

13:51.400 --> 13:52.400
I know.

13:52.400 --> 13:53.400
I know.

13:53.400 --> 13:58.840
It's a bad situation because now we're getting 5G and there's still these caps and limits

13:58.840 --> 13:59.840
on 5G.

13:59.840 --> 14:04.640
I have to believe at some point things have to shift.

14:04.640 --> 14:08.560
When it becomes more common that your home broadband connection is provided by wireless

14:08.560 --> 14:11.020
than it is wired, something's going to have to shift.

14:11.020 --> 14:12.580
It's going to be schooling, right?

14:12.580 --> 14:13.680
That's going to have to push it.

14:13.680 --> 14:20.360
Or maybe your buddy Space Alien Elon comes in with his Starlink and there's a tribe here

14:20.360 --> 14:27.860
in Washington, not far from the studio, that is demoing Starlink right now and had no connectivity

14:27.860 --> 14:29.120
before this.

14:29.120 --> 14:34.200
Now they have Starlink and they're getting around 20 millisecond response times in pinging

14:34.200 --> 14:38.380
to Google and they're getting 80 megabits on some of their download speeds.

14:38.380 --> 14:39.380
That's not bad at all.

14:39.380 --> 14:40.380
From Starlink.

14:40.380 --> 14:41.380
No.

14:41.380 --> 14:43.580
I mean, it's not Israel good, but we'll take it.

14:43.580 --> 14:47.240
So horrible, horrible story.

14:47.240 --> 14:52.720
I called Spectrum, otherwise known as Bright House, who is Mad Botter's ISP.

14:52.720 --> 14:53.720
We actually have two.

14:53.720 --> 14:58.880
The other one's Frontier, who's in bankruptcy right now because, yes.

14:58.880 --> 15:00.580
So good.

15:00.580 --> 15:03.280
And I said, hey, I would like to upgrade our broadband.

15:03.280 --> 15:04.280
Yeah.

15:04.280 --> 15:05.280
I was like, sure.

15:05.280 --> 15:06.280
All right.

15:06.280 --> 15:07.280
Yeah.

15:07.280 --> 15:08.280
We could definitely get that up for you.

15:08.280 --> 15:09.280
We can get 500 down.

15:09.280 --> 15:11.160
I'm like, yes, I like this.

15:11.160 --> 15:12.160
And wow.

15:12.160 --> 15:13.160
Are you sure you want the top rate?

15:13.160 --> 15:14.160
Yes, I do.

15:14.160 --> 15:15.160
35 up.

15:15.160 --> 15:16.520
I'm just, no, I want the top rate.

15:16.520 --> 15:17.520
Yep.

15:17.520 --> 15:18.520
Yeah.

15:18.520 --> 15:19.520
That is the top rate.

15:19.520 --> 15:20.520
Uh-huh.

15:20.520 --> 15:21.520
You want to know something?

15:21.520 --> 15:22.520
No joke.

15:22.520 --> 15:25.280
Right before this show, I got a call from my Comcast rep.

15:25.280 --> 15:26.280
Oh, God.

15:26.280 --> 15:32.600
My business package, which is $200 a month, expires next month.

15:32.600 --> 15:34.560
It goes up $150.

15:34.560 --> 15:36.960
It's nice when you have a captive market, isn't it?

15:36.960 --> 15:37.960
Yeah.

15:37.960 --> 15:38.960
It sure is.

15:38.960 --> 15:43.160
They're offering me a new bundle, which will cost me $100 more.

15:43.160 --> 15:46.080
I'll get 600 down and 35 up.

15:46.080 --> 15:47.640
That's the best I can get.

15:47.640 --> 15:48.640
35 up.

15:48.640 --> 15:49.640
Same thing.

15:49.640 --> 15:54.240
So if you're Mike and you're insane, what would your next phone call be?

15:54.240 --> 15:57.960
I mean, I don't know if there's many choices when you want steady, reliable broadband,

15:57.960 --> 15:59.560
especially if you're self-hosting stuff.

15:59.560 --> 16:01.240
I mean, I think I'm going to do it.

16:01.240 --> 16:02.520
Here's the funny thing, man.

16:02.520 --> 16:06.280
They're making me take, I think, two phone lines or something, which I told them I'm

16:06.280 --> 16:09.240
not even going to use, but to get the bundle discount.

16:09.240 --> 16:10.720
Actual phone lines?

16:10.720 --> 16:11.720
Yeah.

16:11.720 --> 16:12.720
Yeah.

16:12.720 --> 16:13.720
Okay.

16:13.720 --> 16:14.720
And they have to install them.

16:14.720 --> 16:15.720
Oh, God.

16:15.720 --> 16:16.720
So they have to show the install.

16:16.720 --> 16:20.160
So in order to get around that system, what the guy's going to do is he's going to discount

16:20.160 --> 16:24.000
me a month to cover the install fees, which they have to do with the phone lines that

16:24.000 --> 16:27.440
they have to bundle in order to get me the internet discount that I want.

16:27.440 --> 16:28.880
So stupid.

16:28.880 --> 16:29.880
It's really something.

16:29.880 --> 16:30.880
That is the dumbest.

16:30.880 --> 16:31.880
I know.

16:31.880 --> 16:34.920
I mean, what I'm doing, which is not really feasible, I don't think, for a team, I mean,

16:34.920 --> 16:36.360
maybe four or five people.

16:36.360 --> 16:37.800
I'm investing in LadyJuice.

16:37.800 --> 16:40.320
I'm investing in an industrial grade LTE router.

16:40.320 --> 16:41.320
I received it.

16:41.320 --> 16:45.320
I've just started setting it up, and I'll have an AT&T and a Verizon SIM, and I will

16:45.320 --> 16:53.640
pay out the nose for that, but it is industrial grade reliable LTE as you're going to get.

16:53.640 --> 16:58.200
But in a building, in an office space where you're thinking about running a chat server

16:58.200 --> 17:02.560
and what else, it seems like you got to have an actual wired broadband.

17:02.560 --> 17:03.800
There's just not a lot of other options.

17:03.800 --> 17:05.000
They got us, Mike.

17:05.000 --> 17:07.440
Or you host somewhere else, you know?

17:07.440 --> 17:09.840
Or you go insane.

17:09.840 --> 17:13.480
You call up the ISP, ask to speak to their fiber department.

17:13.480 --> 17:15.040
Oh, they have one?

17:15.040 --> 17:16.920
They have one.

17:16.920 --> 17:17.920
And then you order fiber.

17:17.920 --> 17:19.320
Oh, my goodness.

17:19.320 --> 17:20.640
That's going to be a cost.

17:20.640 --> 17:22.280
It is a cost.

17:22.280 --> 17:27.680
The city permits willing, we are going to have fiber in our plant city facility space.

17:27.680 --> 17:30.560
Man, you could double as a data center now.

17:30.560 --> 17:31.560
That's kind of the plan.

17:31.560 --> 17:32.560
Wow.

17:32.560 --> 17:33.560
Wow, yeah.

17:33.560 --> 17:34.560
That's super reliable.

17:34.560 --> 17:40.520
And of course, exclusively hosting on the premier Linux option.

17:40.520 --> 17:41.520
Right.

17:41.520 --> 17:42.520
Right.

17:42.520 --> 17:43.520
Of course.

17:43.520 --> 17:44.520
SUSE.

17:44.520 --> 17:45.520
Oh, God.

17:45.520 --> 17:46.520
God.

17:46.520 --> 17:47.520
Really?

17:47.520 --> 17:48.520
Yes.

17:48.520 --> 17:49.520
Actually.

17:49.520 --> 17:50.520
It's every time.

17:50.520 --> 17:52.800
Do you know how fast they could possibly get it?

17:52.800 --> 17:53.800
Yeah.

17:53.800 --> 17:57.600
It's a gigabit fiber, so it's, yeah.

17:57.600 --> 18:01.640
And they're running it directly into the space through like a wall.

18:01.640 --> 18:02.640
Potential hiccup, right?

18:02.640 --> 18:04.480
This requires permits.

18:04.480 --> 18:08.000
So hopefully, you know, we don't get nimbied to hell.

18:08.000 --> 18:10.720
But you know, we are going to here look into our other options, but I don't think there

18:10.720 --> 18:11.720
is any other options.

18:11.720 --> 18:12.720
I think it's only Comcast here.

18:12.720 --> 18:13.720
And I don't think they offer fiber.

18:13.720 --> 18:17.200
I think it's just business cable or regular cable.

18:17.200 --> 18:18.200
Yeah.

18:18.200 --> 18:23.160
Well, I was kind of surprised at like, because like, obviously, I didn't wake up and be like,

18:23.160 --> 18:25.400
I'm going to install a fiber line, right?

18:25.400 --> 18:26.400
Yeah.

18:26.400 --> 18:27.400
Right.

18:27.400 --> 18:28.400
But there was no other option.

18:28.400 --> 18:29.480
It's bad.

18:29.480 --> 18:32.600
It's so we talk about work from home, but this is I mean, I guess you don't need.

18:32.600 --> 18:37.720
It's incredible bandwidth, but you need a reliable, solid connection with low latency,

18:37.720 --> 18:39.440
especially for all the video chats.

18:39.440 --> 18:43.580
And then if you're actually getting into hosting services, it's a whole nother level.

18:43.580 --> 18:45.460
So I say good for you.

18:45.460 --> 18:48.200
It's going to be a massive investment, but it'll be reliable as heck.

18:48.200 --> 18:50.920
Do they lock you into a contract like they do with Comcast?

18:50.920 --> 18:51.920
Three years, baby.

18:51.920 --> 18:52.920
Yep.

18:52.920 --> 18:53.920
Yeah.

18:53.920 --> 18:54.920
Yeah.

18:54.920 --> 18:55.920
Yeah.

18:55.920 --> 18:57.520
I think mine's a two year with Comcast.

18:57.520 --> 19:01.460
I'm seriously thinking that if they forced me to get a phone line, I might just see if

19:01.460 --> 19:06.400
I can build like a Raspberry Pi voicemail machine and then just give out the number and say,

19:06.400 --> 19:10.040
call the phone number Comcast made me get and leave a voicemail.

19:10.040 --> 19:14.120
That's actually not a bad idea for the shows you could do like the unfiltered tip line brought

19:14.120 --> 19:15.120
to you by Comcast.

19:15.120 --> 19:16.120
Yeah.

19:16.120 --> 19:17.120
They'll love that.

19:17.120 --> 19:18.120
Yeah.

19:18.120 --> 19:23.040
I mean, maybe that'll get them to stop bundling this stuff is if you just publicly shame them.

19:23.040 --> 19:24.040
It's Comcast.

19:24.040 --> 19:25.040
I know.

19:25.040 --> 19:26.040
Yeah.

19:26.040 --> 19:29.640
I don't think their brand is publicly shamed and they continue on.

19:29.640 --> 19:30.640
All right.

19:30.640 --> 19:34.400
So now we have some follow up from Dinesh who had wrote in about going in the couple

19:34.400 --> 19:35.400
episodes ago.

19:35.400 --> 19:38.200
He says, Hey, Michael and Chris, greetings.

19:38.200 --> 19:42.560
A couple of weeks ago, I asked about you, you gentlemen to share your wisdom on whether

19:42.560 --> 19:46.600
it would be a good idea to go as an independent developer.

19:46.600 --> 19:48.400
Thanks a lot for your comments and guidance on the topic.

19:48.400 --> 19:52.880
I really reconsidered what I was thinking and made me think of new angles and realized

19:52.880 --> 19:55.760
I was turning a blind eye to a couple of items and taking them for granted.

19:55.760 --> 19:57.520
So I think it was a rookie mistake.

19:57.520 --> 20:01.080
I've decided to push back my challenge to go into until a later date.

20:01.080 --> 20:02.960
I'm not completely scrapping the idea.

20:02.960 --> 20:06.520
I think I'm going to work on improving my existing network and build up a small fund

20:06.520 --> 20:10.240
as a safety net and then reassess my situation next year.

20:10.240 --> 20:13.760
Interestingly, I had someone approached me, though, for a side gig just a few weeks ago.

20:13.760 --> 20:17.880
I turned it down due to work commitments, but that would have been a great first bug,

20:17.880 --> 20:19.520
as Mike put it.

20:19.520 --> 20:22.240
So we talked him out of it, which I feel a little bad about.

20:22.240 --> 20:25.600
But at the same time, I think he's got a really solid plan about building a little bit of

20:25.600 --> 20:31.160
a nest egg, building out contact network and taking like a 12-year view with setting an

20:31.160 --> 20:35.480
end goal of by, you know, 12 months, I'm going to try to have these things in place.

20:35.480 --> 20:37.280
That's the way to go if you can.

20:37.280 --> 20:41.120
If you have that luxury, that seems like the ideal way to go.

20:41.120 --> 20:42.120
I like it.

20:42.120 --> 20:43.120
Yeah.

20:43.120 --> 20:44.760
He also had some thoughts on your Vim experience.

20:44.760 --> 20:49.800
He says, I used to be a Vim user and I spent countless days configuring my Vim RC, way

20:49.800 --> 20:51.080
more than I'd like to admit.

20:51.080 --> 20:55.040
He said, I could feel the pain in Michael's voice when he was explaining the trauma he

20:55.040 --> 20:56.640
had been through setting up Vim.

20:56.640 --> 20:59.880
As a fellow Vim user, I understand your pain and I'd like you to consider an alternative.

20:59.880 --> 21:03.760
I'd like to introduce you to Neo Vim or N Vim.

21:03.760 --> 21:08.060
N Vim is still Vim under the hood to some extent, but I'd like to consider it as a separate

21:08.060 --> 21:09.060
text editor.

21:09.060 --> 21:13.200
I've set it up with all the useful functionalities like VS code completions, syntax checking

21:13.200 --> 21:17.600
with alerts, automatic markdown preview, automatic JSON formatting and more.

21:17.600 --> 21:22.560
And what I really love about N Vim or new Vim or Neo Vim is how well it integrates with

21:22.560 --> 21:28.600
Conqueror, a Conqueror of completion, CoC, which provides an ID like experience for me.

21:28.600 --> 21:30.200
Feel free to go through my N Vim config file.

21:30.200 --> 21:31.200
He'll link it for you.

21:31.200 --> 21:38.920
So check out Neo Vim at neo vim.io and conqueror of completion CoC on GitHub.

21:38.920 --> 21:42.600
I mean, you know, I'm so happy with VS code on the command line.

21:42.600 --> 21:47.720
I can understand it, but in the, on the desktop, well, I'll save my thoughts for later.

21:47.720 --> 21:49.400
I think we're going to talk about VS code.

21:49.400 --> 21:53.440
Yeah, I did not unfortunately get an opportunity to try Neo Vim yet, but I will definitely

21:53.440 --> 21:54.440
check it out.

21:54.440 --> 21:59.080
I'm sort of, yeah, we're going to talk about VS code in a little bit.

21:59.080 --> 22:00.080
Yeah.

22:00.080 --> 22:01.080
We've got one last email.

22:01.080 --> 22:03.840
This is from Alex and I wanted to hold it to the end because he's a long time listener

22:03.840 --> 22:08.240
and he wants to challenge our definition of dark matter developer, which I think would

22:08.240 --> 22:09.520
be good because we're still on this.

22:09.520 --> 22:12.720
So if you are out there as a dark matter developer and would like to share your insights on what

22:12.720 --> 22:13.720
it's like.

22:13.720 --> 22:14.720
Come into the light.

22:14.720 --> 22:15.720
Yeah, let us know.

22:15.720 --> 22:17.000
You can come into the light, but we'll keep you anonymous.

22:17.000 --> 22:20.280
We won't, we won't say where you work or what your name is.

22:20.280 --> 22:21.280
It's all private.

22:21.280 --> 22:22.720
And if you use Sue's, you have to mention it.

22:22.720 --> 22:27.480
Really, we're just kind of conducting a bit of a, of a survey in a sense to kind of get

22:27.480 --> 22:31.520
an idea of what it's like to work out there in a nine to five job and have a better understanding

22:31.520 --> 22:32.520
of it.

22:32.520 --> 22:35.360
So if you want to participate that coder.show slash contact and Alex writes in, he says,

22:35.360 --> 22:40.200
I've been listening to the recent episodes with all the talk about dark matter developers.

22:40.200 --> 22:44.600
And I think something has changed since I started hearing the term some years ago.

22:44.600 --> 22:50.040
My understanding is a dark matter developer is someone who doesn't follow the blogs, podcasts,

22:50.040 --> 22:54.260
new technologies and trends, or keep up with online communities.

22:54.260 --> 22:57.800
Instead they just show up and do their job, not trying to push the envelope or learn new

22:57.800 --> 22:58.920
things.

22:58.920 --> 23:04.160
On the show, however, I think people think anyone locked into a legacy technology is

23:04.160 --> 23:05.840
now a dark matter developer.

23:05.840 --> 23:10.480
I think it's completely possible to be locked into say using Java aid or cobalt for certain

23:10.480 --> 23:14.960
projects and still keep your skills sharp and keep up with the broader industry.

23:14.960 --> 23:18.240
Longtime listener here since last 2010, I think thanks for all the work and wonderful

23:18.240 --> 23:19.240
network.

23:19.240 --> 23:20.240
Well, thank you, Alex.

23:20.240 --> 23:24.240
I think what it is, Mike, and then I'll let you jump in on this is I think when we started

23:24.240 --> 23:30.240
the show, that would be how you might define the dark matter developer, more of your cobalt

23:30.240 --> 23:34.160
and old school developers who, who grew up really before there were online communities

23:34.160 --> 23:37.320
and got into the industry and started working and became professionals before there was

23:37.320 --> 23:40.280
podcasts or YouTube.

23:40.280 --> 23:43.280
And so they don't really use those as primary sources of information.

23:43.280 --> 23:48.480
I think that when we started the show over a decade ago, that was, right, has it been

23:48.480 --> 23:49.480
a decade?

23:49.480 --> 23:50.480
I don't know, eight, nine years ago.

23:50.480 --> 23:53.580
I think that was what defined a dark matter developer.

23:53.580 --> 23:59.440
But I think now there's not many developers that I've met who aren't keeping up to date

23:59.440 --> 24:00.440
in some way.

24:00.440 --> 24:04.040
I think it now just, if you're into this area of technology, especially if you're developing

24:04.040 --> 24:08.760
for web technologies or mobile technologies, you kind of automatically have to stay up

24:08.760 --> 24:10.120
to date with what's going on.

24:10.120 --> 24:13.240
You have to keep your operating system up to date to continue to target those platforms.

24:13.240 --> 24:16.080
You have to keep your browsers up to date to target the new browsers.

24:16.080 --> 24:19.760
It's one hand, it's like hand in glove.

24:19.760 --> 24:20.760
You have no choice now.

24:20.760 --> 24:26.680
And so I think we've sort of in a sense updated the term to just mean people who are working

24:26.680 --> 24:31.040
heads down at essentially a nine to five job who don't get any recognition, who maybe don't

24:31.040 --> 24:36.360
get to work on the fancy, shiniest new technologies or toolkits, but they're cranking out reliable

24:36.360 --> 24:42.440
software that an enterprise or a business or a point of sale machine or something that

24:42.440 --> 24:46.560
just gets the job done, doesn't get a lot of credit, doesn't get a lot of notoriety,

24:46.560 --> 24:49.600
but it's what actually makes the world tick.

24:49.600 --> 24:51.880
That's what I kind of see a dark matter developer as these days.

24:51.880 --> 24:53.160
Yeah, it's interesting.

24:53.160 --> 24:57.760
So this email really made me think, because I think you're right that there's been, and

24:57.760 --> 25:01.600
so we see that there's been like creep in the definition, because I'm trying to think

25:01.600 --> 25:08.760
of any developer that I could realistically conjure in my mind that isn't somehow like

25:08.760 --> 25:14.480
on using Stack Overflow or like involved in the wider community, maybe not contributing

25:14.480 --> 25:16.160
and probably not contributing, right?

25:16.160 --> 25:22.560
But you know, it's like, like you said, web development, JavaScript is just such a warp

25:22.560 --> 25:27.640
speed cluster that how can you not follow the blogs and actually be able to do it?

25:27.640 --> 25:30.920
So you accept my modern definition of the dark matter developer?

25:30.920 --> 25:32.160
I think I do.

25:32.160 --> 25:33.960
It's definitely different than the original definition.

25:33.960 --> 25:38.920
But I think you're right that that original definition is simply just not possible anymore.

25:38.920 --> 25:39.920
Right?

25:39.920 --> 25:40.920
Yeah.

25:40.920 --> 25:44.120
I mean, I suppose somebody could still be in a data center writing for a mainframe,

25:44.120 --> 25:49.680
a system 390 somewhere that never has to get up to date.

25:49.680 --> 25:52.080
But I don't even think that's a possible scenario anymore.

25:52.080 --> 25:53.640
I don't even think so.

25:53.640 --> 25:57.920
There's probably a couple of guys in a bunker in Kansas with some nukes that they're writing

25:57.920 --> 26:01.440
Fortran and God hope they have no bugs.

26:01.440 --> 26:02.440
We'll never know.

26:02.440 --> 26:03.560
We'll never know because they're not listening.

26:03.560 --> 26:06.400
So they're not going to write in.

26:06.400 --> 26:12.680
Yeah, but if you are listening and you want to let us know coder.show slash contact.

26:12.680 --> 26:14.960
Thanks to Linode for supporting the Coder radio program.

26:14.960 --> 26:20.760
And remember, visit linode.com slash coder and receive a $100 60 day credit towards your

26:20.760 --> 26:21.760
new account.

26:21.760 --> 26:26.280
Linode started in 2003 as one of the first companies in cloud computing, three years

26:26.280 --> 26:28.640
before AWS and the other cloud providers.

26:28.640 --> 26:30.820
So they really know what they're doing.

26:30.820 --> 26:34.680
And the fantastic thing that gives me confidence to use them for my small business is they're

26:34.680 --> 26:36.280
independently owned.

26:36.280 --> 26:40.440
And they're just founded on a passion of Linux and an understanding, a core understanding

26:40.440 --> 26:41.840
of how the technology works.

26:41.840 --> 26:46.840
And if you've worked in a company before that ships a technology product, you know how important

26:46.840 --> 26:51.920
it is that the people in that company understand what it is they're shipping and making.

26:51.920 --> 26:52.920
That's Linode.

26:52.920 --> 26:54.880
And that's why it matters to me that they're independently owned.

26:54.880 --> 26:57.680
That's why it matters to me they've been around since 2003.

26:57.680 --> 27:01.120
And that's why I deploy my infrastructure for the last two years now.

27:01.120 --> 27:04.720
For two years, I've been deploying my infrastructure on Linode.

27:04.720 --> 27:08.720
As a Linux user and a participant in that community, though, I really appreciate Linode's

27:08.720 --> 27:14.160
support of open source initiatives like Kibun2, like Linux Fest Northwest.

27:14.160 --> 27:20.760
But as a businessman who's doing fancy business, deploying websites and whatnot, and playing

27:20.760 --> 27:25.600
clips and whatnot, I really appreciate the other aspects of Linode too, beyond just hosting

27:25.600 --> 27:30.280
servers at 35% to 50% less than the rest of the industry would cost.

27:30.280 --> 27:35.600
They also offer features like S3 compatible object storage, which is an easy way for you

27:35.600 --> 27:38.600
to store and access data without the need for running a front end server.

27:38.600 --> 27:42.320
It's perfect for data that doesn't regularly change like images or other multimedia files.

27:42.320 --> 27:43.800
I use it for clips all the time.

27:43.800 --> 27:47.440
I use it for offsite backups of databases constantly.

27:47.440 --> 27:49.720
And there's an API to manage all of this as well.

27:49.720 --> 27:53.080
And it plugs right in with Kubernetes and Terraform if that's what you're using to deploy

27:53.080 --> 27:56.600
infrastructure as code, which is probably worth considering.

27:56.600 --> 28:00.920
And if you want to learn a subject like cybersecurity, well, you're going to need to be familiar

28:00.920 --> 28:03.680
with all the Linux based operating systems.

28:03.680 --> 28:07.600
And Linode has just about any distribution you'd want to run.

28:07.600 --> 28:10.320
Even OpenSUSE is out there.

28:10.320 --> 28:13.920
I mean, I don't know why, but they even have a couple of versions of OpenSUSE.

28:13.920 --> 28:15.360
I won't hold it against them.

28:15.360 --> 28:18.360
It's a commitment to quality.

28:18.360 --> 28:22.880
They've also got the Appuntus and the Devians and the Fedoras and the Arches, even Alpine.

28:22.880 --> 28:26.440
So really what Linode does is they provide virtual servers that make it easy and affordable

28:26.440 --> 28:28.240
for you to host anything in the cloud.

28:28.240 --> 28:32.080
I set up a Minecraft server for my kids and I run the Jupiter broadcasting matrix server

28:32.080 --> 28:34.480
and encoding servers and show node servers.

28:34.480 --> 28:36.560
All of that is on Linode.

28:36.560 --> 28:39.720
Also my jump hosts, my VPN servers, I run it all on there.

28:39.720 --> 28:43.920
You can start at $5 a month or you can go up to rigs that have multiple CPUs and GPUs

28:43.920 --> 28:46.240
and really pretty powerful.

28:46.240 --> 28:48.480
They're dedicated to offering the best virtualized cloud computing.

28:48.480 --> 28:52.840
If it runs on Linux, it runs on Linode and you can get a $100 60-day credit when you

28:52.840 --> 28:55.000
go to linode.com slash coder.

28:55.000 --> 28:58.800
That supports the show, lets them know you heard about it here and gives you a $100 60-day

28:58.800 --> 29:00.500
credit towards a new account.

29:00.500 --> 29:05.000
That's linode.com slash coder and a big thank you to Linode for sponsoring the Coder radio

29:05.000 --> 29:06.000
program.

29:06.000 --> 29:09.720
Linode.com slash coder.

29:09.720 --> 29:11.400
Let's move into the hoopla, sir.

29:11.400 --> 29:15.520
And let's talk about the trouble with Gnomes because you and I have recently upgraded to

29:15.520 --> 29:21.120
the latest and greatest and freshest Gnome 3.38 which comes with a lot of nice new features.

29:21.120 --> 29:22.120
Always a mistake.

29:22.120 --> 29:25.240
But it does sometimes come with some downsides.

29:25.240 --> 29:30.640
And sometimes they can be trivial little things that really wreck the Gnome shell experience

29:30.640 --> 29:37.240
and I keep hoping one day to have the ultimate workstation OS powered by Gnome running on

29:37.240 --> 29:42.800
top of a very powerful operating system like Linux and it's so close, Mike.

29:42.800 --> 29:44.320
How's your initial experience gone?

29:44.320 --> 29:47.640
I saw in Slack you ran into some issues.

29:47.640 --> 29:48.640
So let's talk about it.

29:48.640 --> 29:49.640
Okay.

29:49.640 --> 29:53.040
This is going to be a bit of a therapy session, I think, for us.

29:53.040 --> 29:59.600
When designing something called extensions, it's super important that an extension not

29:59.600 --> 30:01.760
be able to cripple your whole system.

30:01.760 --> 30:02.760
Yes.

30:02.760 --> 30:04.600
You might say a fundamental.

30:04.600 --> 30:08.440
But that's just not the case in Gnome.

30:08.440 --> 30:12.240
So I use a very popular extension called Backslide.

30:12.240 --> 30:16.520
I am willing to bet many people listening also use it.

30:16.520 --> 30:22.240
If you don't know what it is, weirdly enough, in Gnome, you cannot have like rotating wallpapers

30:22.240 --> 30:27.240
by default, which I think is insane, but I can't seem to convince anybody to like modify

30:27.240 --> 30:28.240
Pop!

30:28.240 --> 30:29.240
OS to just do that.

30:29.240 --> 30:34.480
Mike, they just added support for being able to even set what folder your pictures reside

30:34.480 --> 30:35.480
in.

30:35.480 --> 30:36.480
Just recently.

30:36.480 --> 30:37.480
Okay.

30:37.480 --> 30:43.200
So this is like a McDonald's parfait of problems here.

30:43.200 --> 30:44.940
That's like a basic feature.

30:44.940 --> 30:50.520
When Windows 7 is dunking on you, you have to just rethink things.

30:50.520 --> 30:54.080
It's one of those many things that existed at one point, and then they took it out to

30:54.080 --> 30:57.860
reimagine, redevelop it, and it just took a while to land.

30:57.860 --> 31:02.760
So like a decade ago, when I ran Gnome 2, my first adventure with Linux in college,

31:02.760 --> 31:08.960
you could in fact, right, have rotating wallpapers, just like on every other desktop operating

31:08.960 --> 31:09.960
system.

31:09.960 --> 31:12.960
And it's worth noting, if you're looking at Linux desktops here, Plasma handles this like

31:12.960 --> 31:13.960
a champ.

31:13.960 --> 31:17.100
It's got a dozen different options with sub options to choose from.

31:17.100 --> 31:18.320
And I think elementary does it too.

31:18.320 --> 31:20.320
I forgot the name of their environment, Pantheon.

31:20.320 --> 31:21.320
Is that right?

31:21.320 --> 31:22.320
Yeah.

31:22.320 --> 31:23.320
Yeah.

31:23.320 --> 31:24.320
All right.

31:24.320 --> 31:28.020
So like it's not that this is like a not solved problem in other places, but okay.

31:28.020 --> 31:29.680
And you got these nice screens now.

31:29.680 --> 31:33.400
You want to put some nice wallpapers up there to really kind of make your screen pop.

31:33.400 --> 31:34.400
I get it.

31:34.400 --> 31:35.400
You want to rotate them sometimes.

31:35.400 --> 31:36.400
You want to rotate them.

31:36.400 --> 31:37.400
All right.

31:37.400 --> 31:38.400
So whatever.

31:38.400 --> 31:40.040
You have to install an extension to do that.

31:40.040 --> 31:45.500
I think that's insane, but I understand that I can't have what I want because I'm a bad

31:45.500 --> 31:47.480
person and this is what I deserve.

31:47.480 --> 31:52.880
One wallpaper by default never changes, but extensions can literally bring down the desktop

31:52.880 --> 31:53.880
environment.

31:53.880 --> 31:54.880
Yes.

31:54.880 --> 32:00.200
So I updated my lemur because one, I'm in plant city all week, so I had to do it over

32:00.200 --> 32:02.440
the weekend if I wanted to do it.

32:02.440 --> 32:06.280
And I wanted some of the new features because I'm, I don't know, I just do, right?

32:06.280 --> 32:07.280
I'm a computer enthusiast.

32:07.280 --> 32:08.280
What do you want?

32:08.280 --> 32:12.240
Well, and also Gnome is in this development phase of hyperdevelopment right now where

32:12.240 --> 32:16.520
each release of Gnome Shell brings usability and performance improvements.

32:16.520 --> 32:17.520
Yeah.

32:17.520 --> 32:18.520
And there's like pop because I run pop.

32:18.520 --> 32:23.240
So like I wanted to see how like the new stacking feature that I didn't know about, you know,

32:23.240 --> 32:24.320
works with the new Gnome feature.

32:24.320 --> 32:27.680
So like there are reasons I want the things I want that maybe other people don't care

32:27.680 --> 32:28.680
about.

32:28.680 --> 32:29.680
Right?

32:29.680 --> 32:30.680
Yeah.

32:30.680 --> 32:32.000
But so the up, you know, it does the dist upgrade thing.

32:32.000 --> 32:33.000
It's fine.

32:33.000 --> 32:34.000
Whatever.

32:34.000 --> 32:36.080
It takes a little while longer than I thought it should, but it's fine.

32:36.080 --> 32:41.520
Boot back into pop, do the decrypt thing, log in all my function keys that have anything

32:41.520 --> 32:47.240
to do with screen brightness or audio all of a sudden don't work.

32:47.240 --> 32:48.240
Oh.

32:48.240 --> 32:51.120
And I'm just like, oh my God, it is pop.

32:51.120 --> 32:52.600
I thought it really thought it was pop.

32:52.600 --> 32:54.760
I'm like, son of a bitch, it's broken.

32:54.760 --> 32:55.760
Of course.

32:55.760 --> 32:56.760
You just did an OS upgrade.

32:56.760 --> 32:57.760
Yeah.

32:57.760 --> 32:58.760
Right.

32:58.760 --> 33:03.480
Then I remembered literally like two years ago, we had basically the same conversation.

33:03.480 --> 33:09.440
I mean, it was only a year ago about I had done a Gnome update and it broke all my stuff

33:09.440 --> 33:11.040
and I like a rage quit and went back to Mac.

33:11.040 --> 33:12.800
It's one of the many times I've done that.

33:12.800 --> 33:13.800
Right?

33:13.800 --> 33:14.800
Yeah.

33:14.800 --> 33:20.560
So I'm like, hang on, let me disable my Pomodoro timer, which it turned out wasn't the culprit

33:20.560 --> 33:21.560
and backslide.

33:21.560 --> 33:23.040
Son of a bear.

33:23.040 --> 33:24.040
It was backslide.

33:24.040 --> 33:28.280
And then I got sass on Twitter like, well, you know, the extension isn't updated to the

33:28.280 --> 33:29.280
new dome.

33:29.280 --> 33:31.080
Like that is not my fault.

33:31.080 --> 33:38.520
I know that the extension shaming that happens that whenever you have a bad experience with

33:38.520 --> 33:43.600
either Firefox extensions or Gnome shell extensions, you get extension shamed and you get everything

33:43.600 --> 33:45.480
from you use the wrong one.

33:45.480 --> 33:47.080
You're holding it wrong.

33:47.080 --> 33:51.960
You shouldn't use extensions at all or hey, don't, you know, you have to update that manually.

33:51.960 --> 33:56.880
All these all these like, well, yeah, maybe gotcha kind of things when really you just

33:56.880 --> 34:01.600
want a workstation that has some basic functionality and you're forced to use extensions to get

34:01.600 --> 34:03.560
it there and then you're shamed for it.

34:03.560 --> 34:04.560
It drives me crazy.

34:04.560 --> 34:10.160
Well, and like, OK, another completely reasonable way you could handle this if you were sane

34:10.160 --> 34:13.200
and cared about user experience.

34:13.200 --> 34:17.720
When you update Gnome and you reboot into the new version, it could be like, hey, dog,

34:17.720 --> 34:19.440
you're running this extension that's not compatible.

34:19.440 --> 34:21.040
I disabled it for you.

34:21.040 --> 34:22.040
Sorry, buddy.

34:22.040 --> 34:25.260
Go figure that out on your own, which is still a bad experience.

34:25.260 --> 34:30.440
But yeah, it's better than me spending forty five minutes in a frickin rage.

34:30.440 --> 34:35.560
I think there used to be code checking in Gnome shell that would automatically disable

34:35.560 --> 34:38.600
extensions, but then sort of aspirationally they thought, well, we're getting to the point

34:38.600 --> 34:42.800
where we're not making as many breaking changes, so we're going to stop forcibly disabling

34:42.800 --> 34:43.800
them.

34:43.800 --> 34:44.800
That is bullshit.

34:44.800 --> 34:46.800
It breaks every time.

34:46.800 --> 34:49.360
Well, I had the experience.

34:49.360 --> 34:51.720
This has been a while now and I've been very cautious.

34:51.720 --> 34:55.040
I have a very minimal Gnome shell extensions approach now.

34:55.040 --> 35:00.840
I still have probably four enabled, which is maybe five even.

35:00.840 --> 35:08.040
I'm not sure I I have learned the hard way that the most innocent thing can really mess

35:08.040 --> 35:09.400
up your Gnome shell experience.

35:09.400 --> 35:15.040
I had something that I do every time I'm on a Mac, I install I stat menus and any time

35:15.040 --> 35:19.820
since and I'm not joking here, probably the late 90s that I've set up a Linux desktop.

35:19.820 --> 35:25.720
I've had something on my screen that displays my CPU, RAM and network usage.

35:25.720 --> 35:33.680
I grew up in a time when I could I could physically sense via sound or sight how my computer was

35:33.680 --> 35:34.680
performing.

35:34.680 --> 35:38.000
There would be lights that would actually flash on the front of the case that represented

35:38.000 --> 35:43.760
disk access and you could hear the disk clicking as it access and I could translate that to

35:43.760 --> 35:44.760
the load.

35:44.760 --> 35:50.240
And so when computers started to get silent and more and more like cores and faster CPUs

35:50.240 --> 35:56.700
and faster disk and quieter disk, I very happily adopted things like GK realm and other tools

35:56.700 --> 35:58.980
that would visualize my computer load.

35:58.980 --> 36:00.980
So I had an analogy for that.

36:00.980 --> 36:07.760
So when Gnome shell came along and it was something I extensively used in Gnome 2 and

36:07.760 --> 36:14.600
I use I still continue to use in plasma, I added an extension to monitor my CPU, my memory

36:14.600 --> 36:15.600
and my network.

36:15.600 --> 36:19.760
Oh, you know, you should know you can't have that extension still available in the extensions

36:19.760 --> 36:20.760
website.

36:20.760 --> 36:23.280
It took me a while to realize it because it didn't happen right away.

36:23.280 --> 36:28.880
I don't know exactly the order of events, but eventually Gnome shell would sort of pause

36:28.880 --> 36:29.880
every now and then.

36:29.880 --> 36:30.880
Yeah.

36:30.880 --> 36:33.120
Like if I would say hit the super key and start a search, it would pause and then go

36:33.120 --> 36:36.760
back and then pause and then go and my mouse would pause with it.

36:36.760 --> 36:42.360
And what was happening is every time the extension called to have the CPU graph and the memory

36:42.360 --> 36:48.100
graph and the network graph call updated because the single threaded nature of Gnome shell,

36:48.100 --> 36:55.280
the entire shell would pause while it addressed that update, while it drew that graph and

36:55.280 --> 36:56.940
then it would resume.

36:56.940 --> 37:01.100
And every now and then it would take literally a perceivable moment where I could see my

37:01.100 --> 37:06.840
entire workstation completely freeze for, say, half a second, and it took me forever

37:06.840 --> 37:08.560
to track it down to that.

37:08.560 --> 37:10.440
It took me forever.

37:10.440 --> 37:13.600
I thought for sure at first I had a hardware problem.

37:13.600 --> 37:15.720
This must be some sort of CPU issue or something.

37:15.720 --> 37:19.280
I was convinced it must be a hardware problem until I tried other desktops.

37:19.280 --> 37:21.400
Oh, it's just so intriguing.

37:21.400 --> 37:22.400
I know.

37:22.400 --> 37:26.180
So right now, funny enough, I'm talking to you on a plasma system, the machine I'm live

37:26.180 --> 37:32.880
streaming on, plasma, the machine I record on, XFCE, but I'll tell you what, still out

37:32.880 --> 37:36.200
of all of them I think I prefer Gnome shell just the way my brain works.

37:36.200 --> 37:37.200
Yeah, I know.

37:37.200 --> 37:40.600
And people were like, dude, you can just install KDE.

37:40.600 --> 37:41.600
I get it.

37:41.600 --> 37:42.600
Right.

37:42.600 --> 37:43.600
And it's good.

37:43.600 --> 37:44.600
It's solid.

37:44.600 --> 37:45.600
Right.

37:45.600 --> 37:46.600
But I lose all my pop stuff, don't I?

37:46.600 --> 37:47.600
Don't I lose like my...

37:47.600 --> 37:48.600
Yeah.

37:48.600 --> 37:49.600
Yeah.

37:49.600 --> 37:50.600
So I like my tiling windows and stuff.

37:50.600 --> 37:51.600
That's the thing.

37:51.600 --> 37:53.600
So right now I'm running Fedora 33.

37:53.600 --> 37:56.000
Ooh, how's that?

37:56.000 --> 38:03.360
You know, there's more hoops, but like if you're comfortable pulling down the pop repo

38:03.360 --> 38:08.240
for pop icons and pop theme, you can pull them down and then they have like this Ninja

38:08.240 --> 38:11.560
build system that just builds and installs the pop theme on Fedora 33.

38:11.560 --> 38:13.680
So I'm using pop icons and pop theme.

38:13.680 --> 38:14.680
Oh, nice.

38:14.680 --> 38:15.680
Yeah.

38:15.680 --> 38:16.680
So that makes it feel a little more at home.

38:16.680 --> 38:22.660
And I feel like I got to tweak the terminal more than I do in pop and it's a simpler Gnome

38:22.660 --> 38:26.680
Shell experience and more upstream Gnome Shell, so you have to add the extensions.

38:26.680 --> 38:33.440
But the clever thing that Fedora does is they put the extensions for Gnome Shell in the

38:33.440 --> 38:34.440
repo.

38:34.440 --> 38:38.600
So you can go into Gnome software and search for extensions and then when they're updated,

38:38.600 --> 38:41.080
it will update them via your package updates.

38:41.080 --> 38:42.880
Are you from the future?

38:42.880 --> 38:43.880
Isn't that obvious?

38:43.880 --> 38:46.640
That's such a great way to solve the problem and Fedora thought of it.

38:46.640 --> 38:49.120
And so it's one of the things I love about Fedora.

38:49.120 --> 38:55.960
The other thing, honestly, that I like is you can really easily add Flathub to Fedora

38:55.960 --> 39:01.920
and then you have all of the software on Flathub is available in Gnome software, Slack, Telegram.

39:01.920 --> 39:06.620
And I personally think Flatpaks for desktop software launch faster.

39:06.620 --> 39:10.280
They start up faster and it also works with the pop theme.

39:10.280 --> 39:12.240
Relative to Snaps or relative to...

39:12.240 --> 39:13.240
Yeah, yeah.

39:13.240 --> 39:16.460
Like when I install a Snap version of Slack, I feel like I have to wait a little bit longer

39:16.460 --> 39:20.040
for Slack to start in the morning and Telegram as well, whereas I feel like Flatpak, they

39:20.040 --> 39:21.040
just fire right up.

39:21.040 --> 39:25.160
Have you noticed, and I don't know if this is just Telegram, so pop complains if you

39:25.160 --> 39:30.920
don't use the Flatpak version of things for reasons I don't understand.

39:30.920 --> 39:33.480
So I deleted it and I installed the Flatpak version.

39:33.480 --> 39:37.960
It didn't adopt the theming for like the window bar.

39:37.960 --> 39:43.180
Yeah, that in theory would be a problem because I don't quite understand how Flatpak has access

39:43.180 --> 39:46.680
to the pop theme technically unless there is a Flatpak layer for it.

39:46.680 --> 39:53.920
But I also, like you may have noticed, which we could talk about here in a moment, is Edge.

39:53.920 --> 39:56.400
Edge uses its own title bar, it doesn't use the native title bar.

39:56.400 --> 40:00.200
So that's still a bit of a problem on Linux in general.

40:00.200 --> 40:05.200
Before we dive into Edge though, right, before we do that, I have had and I'm pretty sure

40:05.200 --> 40:10.600
you have had conversations with people from Gnome and my understanding is like they can't

40:10.600 --> 40:11.600
fix this.

40:11.600 --> 40:13.140
Yeah, not without a massive retooling.

40:13.140 --> 40:14.140
So right.

40:14.140 --> 40:16.600
I'm curious to know what your thoughts are on this.

40:16.600 --> 40:23.520
On September 16th, they announced the Gnome Extensions Rebooted initiative.

40:23.520 --> 40:27.660
So at the sort of completion of Gnome 3.3.8, which you and I are just now getting but has

40:27.660 --> 40:34.700
been done since September, they launched an initiative that is what they say a quote collaborative

40:34.700 --> 40:38.240
effort to address the issues around Gnome shell extensions.

40:38.240 --> 40:42.120
We want to start addressing them by making a number of policy changes and technological

40:42.120 --> 40:44.160
improvements while building a sustainable community.

40:44.160 --> 40:45.160
And here's the problem.

40:45.160 --> 40:47.360
I don't see a lot here that's going to make a difference.

40:47.360 --> 40:49.920
So this is the part I want to get your take on.

40:49.920 --> 40:55.200
They say, number one, proper documentations of how extensions work and reasonable expectations

40:55.200 --> 41:00.120
for an extension developer, build a CI pipeline for extension writers to test their extensions

41:00.120 --> 41:05.200
prior to Gnome shell releases, centralize extensions for break testing on Gnome Git

41:05.200 --> 41:10.780
lab space, and create a forum for extension developers and extension writers to work together

41:10.780 --> 41:12.280
on Gnome releases.

41:12.280 --> 41:16.000
I mean, that doesn't do anything.

41:16.000 --> 41:17.000
It's a good idea, right?

41:17.000 --> 41:24.680
To help the extension community, but just using my specific case, it's completely unreasonable

41:24.680 --> 41:27.920
for me to be annoyed with the backslide developer.

41:27.920 --> 41:33.400
He's made this cool thing for free and great, but the problem is the fundamental design

41:33.400 --> 41:35.480
of the Gnome system.

41:35.480 --> 41:37.720
What I didn't see on this list was an API.

41:37.720 --> 41:42.560
Or like, we will sandbox extensions so that if they crash or have an issue, which isn't

41:42.560 --> 41:44.600
just a nuclear test environment.

41:44.600 --> 41:45.600
Right.

41:45.600 --> 41:46.600
Yeah.

41:46.600 --> 41:50.160
Even if extensions just have their own thread, separate process, even if it just had to be

41:50.160 --> 41:53.960
one process for all of the extensions, I could live with that.

41:53.960 --> 41:58.400
But because it's all integrated in one and they cite security issues that you don't have

41:58.400 --> 42:00.900
to fight if you don't break the Gnome shell up.

42:00.900 --> 42:02.960
They cite memory efficiencies.

42:02.960 --> 42:08.280
I mean, they have some reasons and stuff, and there have been significant improvements

42:08.280 --> 42:11.280
on how it all operates over the last couple of years.

42:11.280 --> 42:16.080
The extension problem you're running into now used to happen every single release for

42:16.080 --> 42:17.680
all of the extensions.

42:17.680 --> 42:19.760
So it has actually gotten better.

42:19.760 --> 42:23.640
So maybe this sort of halfway measure, which I don't mean to talk it down because I'm like

42:23.640 --> 42:26.600
just super grateful for anything they can do to solve the problem.

42:26.600 --> 42:30.440
And I kind of appreciate the technical hard spot they're in, but this feels like a halfway

42:30.440 --> 42:31.860
measure to me.

42:31.860 --> 42:37.400
But even if it's this, I could see just making it possible for developers of extensions to

42:37.400 --> 42:43.640
communicate more efficiently, to give them a spot to go to communicate and to create

42:43.640 --> 42:50.160
some documentation that says, this is what we as a community will expect.

42:50.160 --> 42:51.920
You update within this amount of time.

42:51.920 --> 42:54.560
You participate in the release cycles.

42:54.560 --> 42:57.680
Maybe to put some rails on this process that's right now is a Wild West.

42:57.680 --> 43:02.280
I mean, you have to appreciate, because there really are kind of Kobayashi Marud here, right?

43:02.280 --> 43:08.800
Because if they were to magically go back and fix the actual technical problem, they

43:08.800 --> 43:13.320
will probably break all the existing extensions anyway because it'd be too different, right?

43:13.320 --> 43:14.320
Yep.

43:14.320 --> 43:15.320
They'd have to, right?

43:15.320 --> 43:16.320
But let's...

43:16.320 --> 43:18.880
I mean, I know everybody's going to hate this because it's a performance hit, but a thing

43:18.880 --> 43:25.000
you could do, I think, and I don't know under the hood of GNOME, couldn't you, when the

43:25.000 --> 43:31.280
extensions are loading, check them by version for compatibility with the version of GNOME

43:31.280 --> 43:32.280
Shell you're on?

43:32.280 --> 43:34.520
There was some system in place.

43:34.520 --> 43:38.160
Because then you could just not load that extension and just throw up even an ugly error

43:38.160 --> 43:40.040
alert to the user.

43:40.040 --> 43:42.660
One thing that helps now, but it's not...

43:42.660 --> 43:46.760
You have to know to go look for it, is with GNOME 3.3.8, or maybe that was the release

43:46.760 --> 43:47.760
before...

43:47.760 --> 43:53.000
I think it's actually the release prior, they launched an extensions app that is a GNOME

43:53.000 --> 43:55.200
Shell dedicated app just to see what the...

43:55.200 --> 43:58.040
To turn extensions on or off or to see if they have an error.

43:58.040 --> 44:01.440
You have to know that it exists, and it's relatively new, so it's not like many people

44:01.440 --> 44:04.800
do know, and you have to go there to get the information.

44:04.800 --> 44:09.080
It doesn't give you, as far as I know, it doesn't give you a notification using the

44:09.080 --> 44:12.800
built-in notification system saying, hey, extension XYZ is out of date.

44:12.800 --> 44:17.040
Now, there is an extension to check for updates for extensions.

44:17.040 --> 44:18.040
Hang on.

44:18.040 --> 44:19.520
Let me consult Leonardo DiCaprio.

44:19.520 --> 44:20.520
Hey, dog.

44:20.520 --> 44:21.520
I heard you like extensions.

44:21.520 --> 44:23.640
Yeah.

44:23.640 --> 44:24.640
Extension inception.

44:24.640 --> 44:25.640
I don't know.

44:25.640 --> 44:27.440
So they called the extensions rebooted initiative.

44:27.440 --> 44:31.280
They say their ultimate goal is to get the community to work with each other, have closer

44:31.280 --> 44:36.040
ties with GNOME Shell developers and provide documentation and tools.

44:36.040 --> 44:41.440
And my ultimate takeaway is, I think what we're seeing is a change in attitude towards

44:41.440 --> 44:47.760
extensions from GNOME Shell developers, which before was, we don't really like extensions.

44:47.760 --> 44:52.000
We'd like to build the necessary functionality in, and extensions are just kind of a temporary

44:52.000 --> 44:56.240
measure until we've got it to the point that everybody's happy.

44:56.240 --> 44:58.520
But that day has not arrived.

44:58.520 --> 45:03.120
And I think as time has gone on, they've realized the role that extensions play in the GNOME

45:03.120 --> 45:09.080
Shell ecosystem, not just from like users like you and I, right, but vendors like Canonical

45:09.080 --> 45:14.080
or Red Hat or SUSE who want to ship a experience to customers.

45:14.080 --> 45:16.680
They want these facilities available to them.

45:16.680 --> 45:21.240
Canonical has a curated GNOME experience.

45:21.240 --> 45:23.680
They have like an OEM vendor version that you can do.

45:23.680 --> 45:27.240
It's totally all built into GNOME where you can apply your own set of extensions and that

45:27.240 --> 45:29.620
becomes the base GNOME Shell.

45:29.620 --> 45:32.300
And then Canonical updates those via the repo as well.

45:32.300 --> 45:34.240
They just don't have all the other ones in there.

45:34.240 --> 45:39.820
And so this is something that downstream quote unquote customers of GNOME Shell clearly want.

45:39.820 --> 45:44.480
And I think the project has recognized users are still finding use cases for them.

45:44.480 --> 45:47.120
The downstream quote unquote customers are finding uses for them.

45:47.120 --> 45:51.200
And now as a project, they're coming to the reality that they've got to support these

45:51.200 --> 45:52.200
in some way.

45:52.200 --> 45:53.200
But the cat's out of the bag.

45:53.200 --> 45:54.520
The technical challenge exists.

45:54.520 --> 45:55.960
There's no going back now.

45:55.960 --> 45:57.360
So this is their measure.

45:57.360 --> 46:01.440
Wouldn't the ultimate answer, and we should probably get off this because I'm sure GNOME

46:01.440 --> 46:03.760
folks feel like we're beating up on them.

46:03.760 --> 46:07.560
The ultimate answer is like basic functionality such as switching your background should not

46:07.560 --> 46:10.960
need an extension, right?

46:10.960 --> 46:13.960
I know that's like saying do your homework and eat your vegetables.

46:13.960 --> 46:19.200
I feel like what we have right now is a kind of interesting trifecta of you have a lot

46:19.200 --> 46:26.040
of the just hardcore grueling GNOME Shell development happening upstream with the Fedora

46:26.040 --> 46:27.040
and Red Hat developers.

46:27.040 --> 46:29.080
A lot of them are GNOME Shell developers as well.

46:29.080 --> 46:31.360
And there's a lot of crossover there.

46:31.360 --> 46:37.880
Then you have Canonical who is creating a very curated GNOME Shell experience and adding

46:37.880 --> 46:41.960
value to like the settings panels and stuff like that, that upstream notices and thinks

46:41.960 --> 46:43.320
maybe we should have that.

46:43.320 --> 46:48.120
And then on top of that, you have System76 laying down their improvements to Pop OS,

46:48.120 --> 46:51.600
which is building on top of all of these layers.

46:51.600 --> 46:53.680
And they're adding really interesting things.

46:53.680 --> 46:58.440
And all of this is going into GNOME Shell in one form or another.

46:58.440 --> 47:03.200
And all of its open source code that is available if GNOME Shell wants to integrate some of

47:03.200 --> 47:06.520
this directly or at least get inspired by the idea.

47:06.520 --> 47:08.920
So it will take a while to work its way out.

47:08.920 --> 47:14.120
But if you look at it in that viewpoint, it seems like the desktop is really that that

47:14.120 --> 47:19.680
GNOME Shell desktop is really well positioned for some serious innovation down the road

47:19.680 --> 47:25.240
because you've got Fedora and Canonical and System76 and others out there.

47:25.240 --> 47:28.720
I don't mean to like there's people at Endless, there's people at SUSE, I don't mean to count

47:28.720 --> 47:29.720
anybody out.

47:29.720 --> 47:35.080
But you have all of these high profile deployments that are adding different ideas to the experience.

47:35.080 --> 47:37.480
It's going to result in, I think, rapid development.

47:37.480 --> 47:38.480
So more is to come.

47:38.480 --> 47:39.960
I hope so.

47:39.960 --> 47:44.120
Now, I wasn't sure if we were going to talk about this in the show.

47:44.120 --> 47:48.680
But you and I have both been running Microsoft Edge since they released it for Linux last

47:48.680 --> 47:49.680
week.

47:49.680 --> 47:54.600
I've run it on a Fedora machine, I've run it on an Ubuntu machine, and I've got some

47:54.600 --> 47:55.880
thoughts.

47:55.880 --> 48:00.240
But I'm curious to know what your takeaway experiences are with Edge, where you think

48:00.240 --> 48:01.240
it's at.

48:01.240 --> 48:05.840
I think one of the areas that they launched right out of the gate with is pretty decent

48:05.840 --> 48:06.840
developer tools.

48:06.840 --> 48:08.560
I'm sure you had a chance to look at those.

48:08.560 --> 48:09.560
Curious what you think.

48:09.560 --> 48:10.560
Yeah.

48:10.560 --> 48:16.280
So I really spent a lot of time with the VS Code Edge developer tie-in tools.

48:16.280 --> 48:20.800
And damn, that's compelling.

48:20.800 --> 48:21.800
So okay, wait, wait, wait.

48:21.800 --> 48:22.800
VS Code tie-in.

48:22.800 --> 48:26.000
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, what?

48:26.000 --> 48:29.640
Basically VS Code, if you have Edge installed, it can actually do a few things.

48:29.640 --> 48:35.440
But the one I think is particularly sexy is it can take like your HTML or whatever, your

48:35.440 --> 48:36.440
web assets, right?

48:36.440 --> 48:37.440
That's what's going on here.

48:37.440 --> 48:38.440
Yeah.

48:38.440 --> 48:42.280
And render it in VS Code, and you can do like inspections on it and a bunch of debugging

48:42.280 --> 48:43.280
stuff.

48:43.280 --> 48:45.960
I've only scratched the surface because I literally downloaded it this weekend.

48:45.960 --> 48:47.640
Oh, I'm looking at it right now.

48:47.640 --> 48:49.200
This is amazing.

48:49.200 --> 48:53.280
Yeah, it's very, especially like niggling front end issues.

48:53.280 --> 48:56.640
This is something I would use like all the time.

48:56.640 --> 48:59.920
It's like the Chrome developer tool where you can click through the elements of the

48:59.920 --> 49:03.080
site, and it highlights it in the code explorer.

49:03.080 --> 49:05.800
But instead, now it's happening in VS Code.

49:05.800 --> 49:07.120
It's your actual code, right?

49:07.120 --> 49:10.560
It's not that you have to then go back and like, you know, control F and find it whenever

49:10.560 --> 49:12.720
the div is called.

49:12.720 --> 49:16.880
And they do a live render so you can go through the site.

49:16.880 --> 49:19.720
This is brilliant.

49:19.720 --> 49:23.320
With this launching like this right now, I mean, this kind of just is the tell on what

49:23.320 --> 49:24.880
Microsoft strategy is here.

49:24.880 --> 49:25.880
It's developers.

49:25.880 --> 49:27.320
So go into that.

49:27.320 --> 49:28.320
What is this?

49:28.320 --> 49:30.960
Because this is obviously a ton of work, what they did here.

49:30.960 --> 49:35.680
Yeah, I mean, I look at this and I think there's clear, ones we've talked about before is there's

49:35.680 --> 49:36.960
enterprise use cases.

49:36.960 --> 49:39.680
And I heard a lot of that from the audience.

49:39.680 --> 49:44.880
But when I see this, what I see is Microsoft creating tools for developers who prefer to

49:44.880 --> 49:46.460
run Linux.

49:46.460 --> 49:50.360
They're creating a tool for them so that way they can test what they're building in Edge.

49:50.360 --> 49:54.920
And why not make it a great experience to debug and explore like, and they're leveraging

49:54.920 --> 49:57.680
VS Code in a way that's extremely clever.

49:57.680 --> 50:03.200
Well, it's so super weird right now because like I primarily work in Ruby, Python and

50:03.200 --> 50:06.680
you know, HTML, CSS because everybody has to, right?

50:06.680 --> 50:12.200
Like with, we talked about it a month or two ago, PyLance, their new like super duper Python

50:12.200 --> 50:15.040
tooling for VS Code is awesome.

50:15.040 --> 50:22.720
Like I am a over a decades long JetBrains user and I'm like, VS Code is certainly on

50:22.720 --> 50:24.920
par with PyCharm.

50:24.920 --> 50:29.840
And I think is actually becoming slightly better than a Ruby mine, which those are respectively

50:29.840 --> 50:32.600
the Python and Ruby IDs from JetBrains.

50:32.600 --> 50:35.900
It also doesn't make my laptop sound like a 747 when I boot it.

50:35.900 --> 50:36.900
So there's that.

50:36.900 --> 50:37.900
There's that.

50:37.900 --> 50:39.200
There is, that is a nice aspect of it.

50:39.200 --> 50:42.760
I didn't even mention it, but like the other thing they're doing is they're introducing

50:42.760 --> 50:45.840
something that should have existed as a standard a while ago.

50:45.840 --> 50:51.560
Their take on a storage access API, but they're doing it by like actually going through the

50:51.560 --> 50:55.880
W3C standards committee and all that kind of stuff.

50:55.880 --> 50:56.880
Isn't that refreshing?

50:56.880 --> 51:00.520
Yeah, but it's an awesome, like I looked at the API documentation, it is exactly what

51:00.520 --> 51:01.520
you need.

51:01.520 --> 51:06.440
There's a guide that allows the developer to determine whether they have access to browser

51:06.440 --> 51:07.440
based storage.

51:07.440 --> 51:12.000
And if it's restricted by the user's privacy settings to request storage access from the

51:12.000 --> 51:14.280
user, like kind of a pop up we're familiar with.

51:14.280 --> 51:17.960
And they say this capability can be used to create a graceful fallback experience in cases

51:17.960 --> 51:21.940
when storage access may be restricted by features such as tracking prevention.

51:21.940 --> 51:24.140
And they're creating an API there, which is great.

51:24.140 --> 51:29.720
And this is super important as more and more web based clients just make more sense than

51:29.720 --> 51:32.240
you know, whatever.

51:32.240 --> 51:37.400
And as more and more users, particularly sophisticated users, are running blockers and are unknowingly

51:37.400 --> 51:42.400
like getting crappy experiences on your PWA or whatever, because the blocker just automatically

51:42.400 --> 51:45.240
like denies you a bunch of permissions that you need.

51:45.240 --> 51:52.760
What if what we're about to witness is Microsoft create a kick ass browser that surpasses Chrome?

51:52.760 --> 51:56.440
Because when you think about Chrome, it's an operating system now.

51:56.440 --> 51:58.920
It's got remote desktop capabilities.

51:58.920 --> 52:04.360
It's got all of this incredible amount of technology that it's built on over the years.

52:04.360 --> 52:09.200
And my first impression when I launched Edge for the first time, after I went through their

52:09.200 --> 52:13.320
little wizard that said, we are protecting your privacy, which I'm kind of like, hmm.

52:13.320 --> 52:17.600
And then they asked for me to participate in metrics collection, which I actually decided

52:17.600 --> 52:18.600
to do.

52:18.600 --> 52:24.600
But once you get past that, first experience is, oh, this reminds me of Chrome when it

52:24.600 --> 52:29.360
was new and fast and lean with a couple of surprise features in there.

52:29.360 --> 52:33.040
Like, I think the way they lay out the settings is way better.

52:33.040 --> 52:36.600
I think collections is a really unique idea, especially for a guy like me who likes to

52:36.600 --> 52:40.960
document an article before it changes and suck the whole contents of a website offline.

52:40.960 --> 52:41.960
I miss that.

52:41.960 --> 52:44.560
I used to, funny enough, that was one of the things I used to play around with Internet

52:44.560 --> 52:46.160
Explorer way back in the day.

52:46.160 --> 52:47.840
But now they've brought it to Edge in collections.

52:47.840 --> 52:53.120
But then also, one of the things that I think is telling is this nod towards developers,

52:53.120 --> 52:56.560
this clear, like, this is an area they put emphasis in because they haven't even brought

52:56.560 --> 52:58.320
user sync over yet.

52:58.320 --> 52:59.740
I think that's very telling.

52:59.740 --> 53:03.600
And I could see this going in a direction where Edge becomes a serious contender and

53:03.600 --> 53:04.600
surpasses Firefox.

53:04.600 --> 53:09.640
Yeah, it's going to be tough to be Firefox with Chrome in kind of the cat bird seat and

53:09.640 --> 53:15.600
Microsoft's making a really aggressive play for second, effectively.

53:15.600 --> 53:16.600
So why, though?

53:16.600 --> 53:17.600
Right?

53:17.600 --> 53:18.600
Like, this is the thing I don't understand.

53:18.600 --> 53:23.600
I'm running Linux and Mac every day, all day, right, half and half, actually more and more

53:23.600 --> 53:25.320
favoring Linux.

53:25.320 --> 53:29.720
But the best tools I have are almost exclusively from Microsoft now.

53:29.720 --> 53:31.800
I mean, that's why they're doing this.

53:31.800 --> 53:36.080
You could run Edge on all three, Windows, Mac and Linux, all three major desktops.

53:36.080 --> 53:37.880
That's something right there.

53:37.880 --> 53:42.040
And it's a lot like, like I speculated on Linux Action is I think what they're doing

53:42.040 --> 53:46.960
here is they're saying to the enterprise and they're saying to the world, here's the grown

53:46.960 --> 53:49.240
up version of open source.

53:49.240 --> 53:53.240
Here's the, you know, the business class version of open source software.

53:53.240 --> 53:54.240
Now that's a spicy take.

53:54.240 --> 53:55.240
Yeah.

53:55.240 --> 53:58.000
I mean, you think about where they were when we started this show and now where they're

53:58.000 --> 54:01.960
at now, where they're making money off open source now, right?

54:01.960 --> 54:03.760
That's the position we're in now.

54:03.760 --> 54:08.760
Microsoft has figured out a way to make money by releasing things like VS code as open source,

54:08.760 --> 54:10.480
by leveraging things like Blink.

54:10.480 --> 54:15.520
I mean, one of their core products is based around an open source project now.

54:15.520 --> 54:21.000
And they're going to use that to drive developer adoption of their platforms in a very clever

54:21.000 --> 54:22.000
way.

54:22.000 --> 54:23.320
And I'm not a hundred percent sure if I'm okay with it.

54:23.320 --> 54:26.160
I'm just talking about from like an analyst strategic standpoint here.

54:26.160 --> 54:30.840
I'm not talking about it from, you know, save the web standpoint, but I could see them coming

54:30.840 --> 54:35.680
to the market with Edge, you know, in a really competitive way.

54:35.680 --> 54:38.180
Now, now that I've seen what it's capable of, it feels fast.

54:38.180 --> 54:42.760
The font rendering is I think some of the best on desktop Linux or if you've noticed,

54:42.760 --> 54:44.940
but I think the fonts look terrific.

54:44.940 --> 54:47.880
So I set it as my default browser.

54:47.880 --> 54:48.880
Did you?

54:48.880 --> 54:49.880
Yeah.

54:49.880 --> 54:50.880
I, you know, it's funny.

54:50.880 --> 54:53.260
Anytime I say like this kind of stuff about Microsoft, I get so much crap.

54:53.260 --> 54:58.880
People actually written like articles on open source news websites attacking me for talking

54:58.880 --> 55:01.160
positive about Microsoft.

55:01.160 --> 55:02.160
Just ridiculous.

55:02.160 --> 55:05.280
I'm just saying, I'm looking at the strategy here and I see it and I think it makes a lot

55:05.280 --> 55:06.280
of sense.

55:06.280 --> 55:09.960
And while Google kind of has this, we want the world to use Chrome.

55:09.960 --> 55:14.920
I think Microsoft very cleverly is targeting this at a set of users and they're going after

55:14.920 --> 55:16.280
it.

55:16.280 --> 55:23.520
And you got to wonder if maybe, especially as this DOJ case against Google moves forward,

55:23.520 --> 55:27.920
if maybe public opinion isn't going to start shifting a bit about Google, kind of like

55:27.920 --> 55:29.840
it did during the Microsoft trials.

55:29.840 --> 55:35.720
And if it does, Microsoft is right here with Edge saying, hey, we got the business, we

55:35.720 --> 55:38.280
got the business approved version of Chrome if you'd like to use it.

55:38.280 --> 55:39.280
That's true.

55:39.280 --> 55:40.280
That's true.

55:40.280 --> 55:44.240
And just, but just imagine when we started the show or world where we are like not trolling

55:44.240 --> 55:50.280
and seriously talking about Microsoft being an active participant in a standards community

55:50.280 --> 55:53.280
and not in like a creepy, like we're going to embrace extend extinguish thing, but like

55:53.280 --> 55:56.120
actively they seem like a good actor, right?

55:56.120 --> 55:57.120
They seem like a positive.

55:57.120 --> 55:59.600
I'll go a step further than that.

55:59.600 --> 56:02.920
They may be saving us from total Chrome domination.

56:02.920 --> 56:07.860
And I realize it's blink under the hood, but at least they are another player with leverage.

56:07.860 --> 56:14.640
It's another gorilla in that arena that can assert its opinion and advocate for standards.

56:14.640 --> 56:16.680
We were so, I mean, Firefox is done, man.

56:16.680 --> 56:19.300
It is, Mozilla is cooked.

56:19.300 --> 56:21.080
You're lighting up that hot take, huh?

56:21.080 --> 56:26.560
It's documented on Linux action news after just a year of, and it has gotten so bad that

56:26.560 --> 56:31.100
we've just sort of, we've sort of not decided to cover every Mozilla story because every

56:31.100 --> 56:33.700
week there's some new story about their decline.

56:33.700 --> 56:39.840
Firefox is ruined and it's such a shame because it's such at a good point, like they got that

56:39.840 --> 56:45.000
meteor shooting again back up into the sky, but the support team on the ground just isn't

56:45.000 --> 56:46.000
there.

56:46.000 --> 56:51.100
And Chrome is just dominating the market now, just absolutely dominating the market.

56:51.100 --> 56:55.560
So Microsoft may save us from a total Google web monopoly.

56:55.560 --> 56:58.880
Honestly, like what, and I've mentioned this before, one of my fears is that Chrome was

56:58.880 --> 57:01.000
becoming IE6, right?

57:01.000 --> 57:04.240
I guess I'm not as doom and gloom on Firefox as you, cause I sort of think there's a lot

57:04.240 --> 57:05.960
of smart people there that can.

57:05.960 --> 57:06.960
There were.

57:06.960 --> 57:08.640
Well, they, yeah, a lot of, they did have an Exodus.

57:08.640 --> 57:09.640
Yeah.

57:09.640 --> 57:14.800
So basically I can't have extensions and I can't have Firefox, is that where we're going?

57:14.800 --> 57:15.800
Right.

57:15.800 --> 57:17.480
Although Chrome extensions work great in Edge, so.

57:17.480 --> 57:19.520
By the way, what a move.

57:19.520 --> 57:21.800
Oh, you know that whole ecosystem of extensions?

57:21.800 --> 57:22.800
We got you.

57:22.800 --> 57:23.800
Yeah.

57:23.800 --> 57:24.800
Yeah.

57:24.800 --> 57:28.100
Well, you got to figure a lot of the heavy lifting to getting Edge on Linux and Mac

57:28.100 --> 57:32.200
OS is being done by the Chromium team, right?

57:32.200 --> 57:33.200
Yeah.

57:33.200 --> 57:34.720
I would think so.

57:34.720 --> 57:40.560
So Microsoft is leveraging the hard work of their competitor here and it's open source,

57:40.560 --> 57:42.280
although Edge itself is not open source.

57:42.280 --> 57:45.200
And I think that would actually be a decent move on their part, but maybe not.

57:45.200 --> 57:46.200
We'll see.

57:46.200 --> 57:47.980
I don't know.

57:47.980 --> 57:52.480
Sometimes I feel like they're going to wait like open source things after the fact.

57:52.480 --> 57:55.480
Maybe, or if they were going to do it, they probably would have done it.

57:55.480 --> 57:58.680
Well, I want to say thank you to our Coder QA team.

57:58.680 --> 58:00.020
You go get your quarterly report.

58:00.020 --> 58:02.780
It is out and you get one every quarter.

58:02.780 --> 58:03.780
You support the show.

58:03.780 --> 58:09.200
You also get a limited ad feed and we appreciate every single one of you to help not only cover

58:09.200 --> 58:13.720
the production of the show, but help us be picky and choosy about the sponsors we bring

58:13.720 --> 58:14.720
onto the show.

58:14.720 --> 58:17.460
That's a big part of it as well and keeping the show sustainable.

58:17.460 --> 58:21.920
So you can become a member at coderqa.co and you get a limited ad feed, you support the

58:21.920 --> 58:26.280
show and you get that Coder quarterly report.

58:26.280 --> 58:27.280
It's at coderqa.co.

58:27.280 --> 58:35.520
Now, before we get out of here, I wanted to mention that ISH has made it onto the App

58:35.520 --> 58:38.400
Store and it's actually completely free.

58:38.400 --> 58:41.900
I've been using it for over, I think I talked about it on the show, maybe even almost two

58:41.900 --> 58:43.160
years ago.

58:43.160 --> 58:51.200
It is a project to get a full Linux shell running on iOS using user mode x86 emulation

58:51.200 --> 58:52.880
and syscall translations.

58:52.880 --> 59:00.160
So ISH is an app for iOS, it works great on the iPad or the phone, that emulates a 32-bit

59:00.160 --> 59:03.080
Alpine x86 Linux environment.

59:03.080 --> 59:05.680
You can install software from Alpine APKs.

59:05.680 --> 59:11.840
ISH also acts as a file provider so you can go to the files app in iOS and you can edit

59:11.840 --> 59:18.360
the sidebar and you can turn on ISH to mount, quote unquote, your ISH file system and you

59:18.360 --> 59:24.160
can drag stuff into it from iOS and get access to those files in ISH and you get a full Alpine

59:24.160 --> 59:25.880
x86 environment.

59:25.880 --> 59:29.920
It's brilliant on the iPad Pro, especially if you got the keyboard, you get a full screen,

59:29.920 --> 59:31.800
legitimate x86 Linux environment.

59:31.800 --> 59:35.800
I thought there was no way in hell Apple would let this on the App Store.

59:35.800 --> 59:39.960
So go get it now because they probably won't.

59:39.960 --> 59:42.860
Now that you told them it's on there, it won't be there for very long, when does the show

59:42.860 --> 59:43.860
come out?

59:43.860 --> 59:44.860
Wednesday?

59:44.860 --> 59:45.860
You better download it Tuesday.

59:45.860 --> 59:46.860
Yeah, you better get it soon.

59:46.860 --> 59:50.200
But I don't know if you had a chance to try this, but it still blows my mind when I bring

59:50.200 --> 59:52.240
up a full Linux environment on my iPad.

59:52.240 --> 59:53.240
Yeah, no.

59:53.240 --> 59:58.520
So assuming Apple doesn't rip this down, this will be on my iPad when we resume traveling

59:58.520 --> 59:59.520
if ever.

59:59.520 --> 01:00:00.520
Yep.

01:00:00.520 --> 01:00:01.520
Yeah.

01:00:01.520 --> 01:00:04.440
This, and I think it's, I don't remember the name exactly, but I think it's Termulus,

01:00:04.440 --> 01:00:09.480
which is a terminal app and it can sync your SSH favorites between devices.

01:00:09.480 --> 01:00:11.600
Man, do I use the crap out of that.

01:00:11.600 --> 01:00:15.360
Like if I got to just do a quick SSH into a server to reboot or something like that,

01:00:15.360 --> 01:00:18.280
I have it on both my devices and it's just lovely.

01:00:18.280 --> 01:00:19.940
So a little bonus pick there for you.

01:00:19.940 --> 01:00:24.240
But ISH is a full Alpine Linux environment and somehow, for some reason, it's on the

01:00:24.240 --> 01:00:25.240
app store.

01:00:25.240 --> 01:00:29.320
The guy, the developer that makes it, he had it up for like 70 bucks for the first day

01:00:29.320 --> 01:00:30.640
and they even let that on.

01:00:30.640 --> 01:00:33.680
They let it on at $70 and now it's free.

01:00:33.680 --> 01:00:35.440
Oh, wait a minute, wait a minute.

01:00:35.440 --> 01:00:38.160
Apple would never begrudge anybody for charging a premium.

01:00:38.160 --> 01:00:39.160
I mean, that's like...

01:00:39.160 --> 01:00:41.000
True, that's very true.

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:44.600
That's probably why they let it on actually, like us, someone who finally understands.

01:00:44.600 --> 01:00:45.600
Right.

01:00:45.600 --> 01:00:46.600
The value.

01:00:46.600 --> 01:00:48.080
Well, there you have it.

01:00:48.080 --> 01:00:53.440
We'll have a link to ISH in the show notes, which will be at coder.show slash three eight

01:00:53.440 --> 01:00:54.440
five.

01:00:54.440 --> 01:00:57.800
Mr. Dominic, is there anything you'd like to plug this week or send the people somewhere?

01:00:57.800 --> 01:00:58.800
Something.

01:00:58.800 --> 01:00:59.800
Follow me on Twitter at Dumanuco.

01:00:59.800 --> 01:01:03.040
I will have some SUSE content out this week.

01:01:03.040 --> 01:01:04.040
I'm not trolling.

01:01:04.040 --> 01:01:05.040
Well, I am trolling Chris, but I really will.

01:01:05.040 --> 01:01:06.040
So.

01:01:06.040 --> 01:01:07.040
All right.

01:01:07.040 --> 01:01:08.040
Well, we'll be keeping an eye on that.

01:01:08.040 --> 01:01:11.640
I think the show is at Coder Radio Show, at Coder Show.

01:01:11.640 --> 01:01:13.840
You'll know if somebody yells at you, you got the wrong one.

01:01:13.840 --> 01:01:16.040
Yeah, I kind of just put a bookmark out there.

01:01:16.040 --> 01:01:17.840
I'm at Chris LAS.

01:01:17.840 --> 01:01:19.120
The network is at Jupiter Signal.

01:01:19.120 --> 01:01:21.280
And hey, we'd love to have you join us live.

01:01:21.280 --> 01:01:25.280
We do this show on Mondays at noon Pacific, three p.m. Eastern over at jblive.tv.

01:01:25.280 --> 01:01:26.280
You can hang out in the chat room.

01:01:26.280 --> 01:01:30.840
There's a bit of a pre show, bit of a post show, all of that over at jblive.tv and makes

01:01:30.840 --> 01:01:31.840
the show a little bit better.

01:01:31.840 --> 01:01:32.840
And you help us title it too.

01:01:32.840 --> 01:01:34.480
We'd love to see you on a Monday.

01:01:34.480 --> 01:01:36.400
If not, show's out on Wednesdays.

01:01:36.400 --> 01:01:38.160
You can get it at Coder.show slash subscribe.

01:01:38.160 --> 01:01:39.160
Thanks for joining us.

01:01:39.160 --> 01:01:48.920
We'll see you back here next Monday.
