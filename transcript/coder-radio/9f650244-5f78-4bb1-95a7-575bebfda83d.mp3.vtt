This is Koda Radio, episode 392 for December 14th, 2020.

00:15.000 --> 00:23.000
Hello friends and welcome in to Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show, taking a pragmatic look at the art and business of software development and the world of technology.

00:23.000 --> 00:32.000
This episode is brought to you by a Cloud Guru. A Cloud Guru now includes Cloud Playgrounds, Azure AWS, or Google Sandboxes on ACG's credit card, not yours.

00:36.000 --> 00:44.000
My name is Chris, and joining me like every single week is now Apple's first return of an M1 product customer.

00:44.000 --> 00:47.000
It is our host, Mr. Michael Dominick. Hello, Mike.

00:47.000 --> 00:51.000
Way to just like out me in the intro. That was savage.

00:51.000 --> 01:00.000
Yeah, I know, right? I mean, I just I'm trying to process the tweets that I'm reading because it's like we talk about it on the show, you make a live purchase, we work it out.

01:00.000 --> 01:05.000
And then I'm seeing this tweet, you get the box, you're like, maybe not even going to open it. Tell me you at least opened it.

01:05.000 --> 01:13.000
I opened it and I played with it for a few days. And I will say, if you are in the market for a lightweight laptop and you want to run Mac OS, it's a fabulous choice.

01:13.000 --> 01:15.000
OK, so what happened?

01:15.000 --> 01:18.000
Oh, I have a very specific, very picky issue.

01:18.000 --> 01:22.000
Oh, really? So there is an actual problem because I know you were on the fence to begin with.

01:22.000 --> 01:27.000
One, my tool chain is like I know there's a way to get homebrew and shit working, which is fine.

01:27.000 --> 01:30.000
Yeah, if you want to use Rosetta, which totally fine.

01:30.000 --> 01:35.000
Fine. And it actually runs fine. I mean, Ruby mine runs like dog shit. So does PyCharm.

01:35.000 --> 01:41.000
But that's, you know, that's problematic for me because I basically live in the IntelliJ IDE's whether I'm on Mac or Linux.

01:41.000 --> 01:44.000
All right. We know I'm a little picky.

01:44.000 --> 01:48.000
I mean, some have suggested it, but I don't I don't say it.

01:48.000 --> 01:53.000
The screen's not bright enough. I'm so used to the MacBook Pro. And so there's two things.

01:53.000 --> 02:00.000
The screen's not bright enough. And living with my lemur for so long, I found out that I actually prefer a mat.

02:00.000 --> 02:02.000
Oh, OK. Like a lot. Yeah, sure. Absolutely.

02:02.000 --> 02:06.000
Even though the lemur screen, I think, could also be a touch brighter.

02:06.000 --> 02:09.000
But here's the thing. I don't have like a gauntlet to throw down and say it's crap.

02:09.000 --> 02:19.000
It's a good machine. Right. If you are in the market for a Mac laptop, I would probably recommend you look at the pro because it has the slightly better screen.

02:19.000 --> 02:27.000
But yeah, it's fine. I'm just picky. And I and if you're going to spend the money, right, you got it's got to check the boxes.

02:27.000 --> 02:35.000
Right. And there's this whole other thing where I've been watching my IMAX Pro value just plummet like over the last three weeks.

02:35.000 --> 02:42.000
Yeah. And I'm debating, like, do I just sell it? Sell out now? Do I, you know, switch for something else?

02:42.000 --> 02:49.000
There's nothing in my tool chain that really, quote, needs Mac OS right now that I can't do with like, you know, Max Stadia.

02:49.000 --> 02:55.000
Is that the one? Yeah, we're now. Actually, did you see Amazon? Amazon is now offering Macs on AWS.

02:55.000 --> 03:04.000
So just go that route. I've developed so much muscle memory and pop with all their like window snapping and all that kind of stuff that I'm getting to the point of like,

03:04.000 --> 03:09.000
the IMAX Pro is a great machine, honestly. And you're going to I know you're going to jump down my throat on this.

03:09.000 --> 03:16.000
The limited media production I do, I am just so much more familiar with Apple's tools for that that I do.

03:16.000 --> 03:20.000
I like I do struggle with OBS all the time. Oh, yeah. OBS is a weird piece to begin with.

03:20.000 --> 03:25.000
You know, God bless it. Love the project. But it's got a learning curve, right?

03:25.000 --> 03:37.000
But I'm getting to the point where switching between OS is considering I literally do the same workflows just with like slight concessions to operating system differences and key bindings.

03:37.000 --> 03:46.000
I don't know if I don't just want like some money back off of the IMAX Pro and then I kind of wait for like a Thaleo 2.0 or something.

03:46.000 --> 03:53.000
Although the lemurs fast enough, do I even need something else? Like for the last week, I've basically been working on the lemur.

03:53.000 --> 03:57.000
Yeah, that's definitely part of the math these days. The machines have gotten so good.

03:57.000 --> 04:02.000
You know, and we got people writing in that this is actually something we got a little bit common.

04:02.000 --> 04:06.000
People that would write in would say, hey, you know, I'm on a machine from 2013.

04:06.000 --> 04:14.000
I'm on a machine from 2015 and I've just made some modifications to make it more appealing to me.

04:14.000 --> 04:20.000
And, you know, the processors are still fine enough because if your workload doesn't require crazy fast processors,

04:20.000 --> 04:25.000
there's really not been any compelling reasons to upgrade. I mean, things are incrementally better.

04:25.000 --> 04:33.000
But the M1 series kind of seems like maybe one of those first changes where things are significantly better, but it's still so early in the process.

04:33.000 --> 04:40.000
I thought after the show, the problem you were going to have is that the MacBook Air is still an air.

04:40.000 --> 04:42.000
And I think that's kind of what you ran into with the screen.

04:42.000 --> 04:50.000
And just because it has a new processor and it doesn't mean that it's now all of a sudden a laptop, that's really what you need from a computer.

04:50.000 --> 04:58.000
You probably would be better suited with something like an ARM based iMac Pro, because I am guessing from your kind of workload,

04:58.000 --> 05:05.000
when you need CPU power, you really need it. And that's where something like an iMac Pro style machine would be a lot better for you.

05:05.000 --> 05:11.000
And stick with the lemur for portability and on the go and, you know, a Linux workflow.

05:11.000 --> 05:16.000
I mean, the one big thing the Apple machines have and just answer Fat Cat Pat, incredible name in the chat room.

05:16.000 --> 05:21.000
I do still have the original Thelio, but it's doing a dedicated task and it has been for months.

05:21.000 --> 05:29.000
Is the microphone and onboard speakers to take those ever present Zoom calls.

05:29.000 --> 05:34.000
Yeah, those are those are still really good on that hardware. Yeah.

05:34.000 --> 05:41.000
Oh, wait. Well, you know, by the way, new new new lifetime. So hello to people at the Coder happy hour lifetime. We got started even a little early today.

05:41.000 --> 05:48.000
Started off around five p.m. I was playing a little stadium and Mike joined me a little early and we just kicked it off because we want to get this conversation captured.

05:48.000 --> 05:53.000
And I thought I'd have some email about robes, Mike, you know, I was really looking forward to getting mine.

05:53.000 --> 05:58.000
Honestly, I tell you what nobody wrote in about the Coder robes.

05:58.000 --> 06:06.000
Nobody button, nobody. And I just I thought we'd get like a bunch of great robe swag ideas.

06:06.000 --> 06:11.000
So I went out and I did a little looking and I put some links in the show notes.

06:11.000 --> 06:16.000
I'm curious to know what kind of style you like because so I put the Cadillac in there.

06:16.000 --> 06:22.000
This is an LL Bean. This is the men's rugby robe, flannel line and hooded.

06:22.000 --> 06:33.000
And it starts at ninety nine dollars. So it's a little rich for my blood, but I could see maybe doing a couple special items and then didn't doing something that's not so costly.

06:33.000 --> 06:39.000
This ranges. I found these styles lows thirty five dollars, but I like this, you know.

06:39.000 --> 06:44.000
And so here's what I'm doing, Mike, you know, just because I want to make sure we're going to test this thing from beginning to end.

06:44.000 --> 06:50.000
I'm wearing a robe tonight. Excellent. This isn't a Cadillac robe, Mike. This is a robe at the end of its life.

06:50.000 --> 06:54.000
You know, like when you got one of those robes that you should have thrown it out like five years ago.

06:54.000 --> 07:00.000
My dad, he'd like he'd wear the arsehole out of the pants like he just like blow this the robe out.

07:00.000 --> 07:04.000
And like you knew at that point it was time for him to get, you know, new robe.

07:04.000 --> 07:07.000
And, you know, you just go through him every few years. This one's near that.

07:07.000 --> 07:10.000
I still have the arse on it, but it's not going to be much longer.

07:10.000 --> 07:16.000
And but I thought, you know, let's validate this because it's five thirty p.m. in the Pacific Northwest.

07:16.000 --> 07:20.000
The sun's already set because fucking winter.

07:20.000 --> 07:24.000
And so I'm I'm sitting here in my robe and I here's what I did.

07:24.000 --> 07:27.000
No pants. I mean, wait, pants.

07:27.000 --> 07:31.000
Got to make sure I get my story straight. And then no shirt but robe. Right.

07:31.000 --> 07:36.000
So I'm getting some airflow. I'm getting some comfort. But I still got my working pants on.

07:36.000 --> 07:41.000
You know what I mean? I think with the work from home, the way it is these days in the twenty twenties,

07:41.000 --> 07:46.000
I think this could be a great way for people to go home casual.

07:46.000 --> 07:49.000
You know, you got work casual. This is home casual. Be comfortable.

07:49.000 --> 07:54.000
And imagine if this was a really nice robe with a little hoodie.

07:54.000 --> 08:01.000
So when I had to go outside to get the Uber Eats or something, I could have a hoodie on and then I could have like a little coded radio logo on there.

08:01.000 --> 08:05.000
Right. It's very functional. It's also a boxing style rope.

08:05.000 --> 08:11.000
So should you get into an altercation with, I don't know, some other tech podcast hosts, we can always, you know, just throw down.

08:11.000 --> 08:16.000
Right. And I feel like I could, like, you know, put my fist together and bounce back and forth and I'd look tough.

08:16.000 --> 08:22.000
Anyway, so this is the kind I'm looking for. But this this Cadillac, this LL Bean rugby robe, it's a hundred bucks.

08:22.000 --> 08:27.000
That seems like too much. And that's before we've put a logo on it or made a profit.

08:27.000 --> 08:33.000
So, yeah, I feel like that's not going to sell. So we got it. We got to reel it in a little bit.

08:33.000 --> 08:41.000
So somebody, you know, they need to they need to get off their asses and send us a link.

08:41.000 --> 08:49.000
I have some strong feelings about this. Anyways, getting to the feedback that we did get this week.

08:49.000 --> 08:55.000
So here's what happened. This is why running your own business is a horrible idea and nobody should do it.

08:55.000 --> 09:01.000
So I got this podcast and a big part of what we do in this podcast is is feedback.

09:01.000 --> 09:05.000
And it's a big interaction with the show and the audience. And it's important thing.

09:05.000 --> 09:10.000
Imagine the scenario for a moment, if you could, if you could imagine such a hypothetical situation.

09:10.000 --> 09:19.000
Well, one day the emails just get real light, like just we go from a bunch of emails every day to one or two emails.

09:19.000 --> 09:23.000
You know, maybe we go from a dozen emails a day to one or two emails, maybe just one email.

09:23.000 --> 09:30.000
Well, what's going on? I get this and I start getting this this spam moderator report from Google apps.

09:30.000 --> 09:39.000
Oh, yeah. And I see in there that it's starting to withhold people's emails because we've been getting emails and they're all coming from like the fireside contact page.

09:39.000 --> 09:43.000
And so it thinks they're spam. Right. You've been through this. Yes. Yeah. All right.

09:43.000 --> 09:49.000
Time for me to put on my I.T. hat for a little bit. My first thought was, man, I wish I could just get Drew to fix this for me real quick.

09:49.000 --> 09:58.000
But it's the middle of the workday. And, you know, I realize all of a sudden we're missing out on all these emails from the audience.

09:58.000 --> 10:07.000
And so like it becomes like this. I've got to rescue these emails because in the moderator email I got from Google apps, it says in a day or so, these will be auto deleted or something like that.

10:07.000 --> 10:13.000
Oh, that's nice. That's that's. Yeah. Yeah. We may have lost some. How would I know? How would I know?

10:13.000 --> 10:18.000
Right. So it says, but click here to approve the messages and review them and whatever.

10:18.000 --> 10:25.000
So I click the link and I get a Google apps error message 503 page can't load, blah, blah, blah, whatever it was.

10:25.000 --> 10:31.000
Oh, go figure. I think I finally set down the time aside to work on this and Google apps as an outage, I think to myself.

10:31.000 --> 10:34.000
So I come back the next day. I do it. It doesn't work again.

10:34.000 --> 10:41.000
And of course, I'm starting to try to Google the problem. But you can imagine how horribly ineffective this is.

10:41.000 --> 10:46.000
And and the documentation that Google has is just so verbose and unhelpful.

10:46.000 --> 10:53.000
I dig and I dig and I dig and I discover that my Google apps users have not been enrolled in groups.

10:53.000 --> 10:59.000
All of the Google apps features are on except for groups for some reason. Maybe they're not on by default or whatever.

10:59.000 --> 11:05.000
And in order to go approve these messages, I have to become a moderator of that group.

11:05.000 --> 11:10.000
But I cannot become a moderator of that group because my Google apps account doesn't have groups enabled.

11:10.000 --> 11:18.000
But yet groups is somehow moderating emails. It's it's beautiful. I know it's it's it's like Microsoft in their heyday, isn't it?

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
It's really it's circular.

11:20.000 --> 11:24.000
I was going to say, isn't there a Samba server or an active directory somewhere?

11:24.000 --> 11:30.000
It feels like it. So I figure out how to enable my Google apps account to have group support.

11:30.000 --> 11:37.000
And then I go in there and I approve all these emails. And then it turns out like a ton of people were writing in about all these great keyboards.

11:37.000 --> 11:44.000
So what I've done is I've gone through and I've collected three more just really rad keyboards.

11:44.000 --> 11:48.000
So we're going to talk to that. We're not going to read all the emails. We're not going to spend a ton of time on it.

11:48.000 --> 11:53.000
But there are three really rad keyboards that are like just like nothing you've ever seen before.

11:53.000 --> 11:56.000
So we're going to talk about those. But first, I thought this was kind of nice.

11:56.000 --> 12:03.000
Elias writes in. He says, hey, Mike and Chris. And I wanted to read this email because I know you and I have both.

12:03.000 --> 12:13.000
We've had a really wild 2020 and there has been times where we have even questioned why we are running a business and all of this.

12:13.000 --> 12:17.000
And I gave a little insight into that last week. But there's of course there's even more going on.

12:17.000 --> 12:22.000
And so I thought this is really nice because it shows you sort of the unseen effect of the show.

12:22.000 --> 12:27.000
He says, I wanted to say thank you to you both for all the content you've delivered over the years.

12:27.000 --> 12:32.000
I've been a listener and a supporter for a long time. So I think he's a QA member, too, which is awesome.

12:32.000 --> 12:36.000
While not a developer, the subject has been a passion since I was a child.

12:36.000 --> 12:45.000
After speaking to my manager a few weeks back, I applied for a slot on a bachelor's degree in computing with a focus on software development.

12:45.000 --> 12:56.000
I had my interview this week and thanks to all of the industry lingo and knowledge I absorbed by listening to Koda Radio for the last five to six years, I was offered the spot today.

12:56.000 --> 13:01.000
Starting college at 31 will be an interesting experience, but better late than never.

13:01.000 --> 13:05.000
Anyways, I just want to say thank you for your unknowing help in all of this.

13:05.000 --> 13:08.000
Isn't that nice? I'm going to call that a Koda Radio success story.

13:08.000 --> 13:15.000
Somehow talking about you buying MacBooks has helped people. I don't know.

13:15.000 --> 13:20.000
I'm almost sure that's not the part that helped. I see what you did there.

13:20.000 --> 13:22.000
You're just all fired up from the robes.

13:22.000 --> 13:26.000
Yeah, dude, I got a lot of comfort right now. It makes me more effective.

13:26.000 --> 13:30.000
I got to say, plus, I mean, who doesn't like a little ventilation on the bod?

13:30.000 --> 13:35.000
I was going to say I do own one robe. Yeah. It is a red smoking jacket.

13:35.000 --> 13:38.000
Oh, yes. The full Hugh Hefner.

13:38.000 --> 13:44.000
My opinion is you can have probably too many tech t-shirts, you know, swag t-shirts and whatnot.

13:44.000 --> 13:47.000
Yeah. But you've always got room for like one or two robes.

13:47.000 --> 13:51.000
I mean, I live in an RV and I'm going to have two robes because I got to I got this.

13:51.000 --> 13:54.000
Well, I'll probably what I'll probably do is I'll get rid of this one.

13:54.000 --> 13:57.000
This is my test robe, you know, my minimum viable robe.

13:57.000 --> 14:04.000
I'll get rid of this and I'll upgrade here at the studio with the Koda robe and I might just wear it while I'm doing the show.

14:04.000 --> 14:08.000
It probably has good sound absorbing properties. It's a prototype effectively.

14:08.000 --> 14:12.000
Yeah. Yeah. Minimum Viable Robe. You did it in design, right?

14:12.000 --> 14:17.000
That's all it is. A little click through demo. I think actually my son picked it out like when he was really, really young.

14:17.000 --> 14:21.000
So it's it's getting pretty old now because he's getting way too old.

14:21.000 --> 14:24.000
So let's talk about some of these keyboards. Dom wrote in.

14:24.000 --> 14:27.000
He said, I want to tell you about a game changer keyboard.

14:27.000 --> 14:32.000
I think it's called the Ergodox. It gives you something to do for your thumbs.

14:32.000 --> 14:38.000
It has a relaxing position for your shoulders. It has even some great keys for EMAX users.

14:38.000 --> 14:46.000
He says my EMAX pinky EMAX users. It's programmable, mechanical and has another feature that I'll mention here in a moment.

14:46.000 --> 14:50.000
In fact, I'll wait because that's the raddest part. But you got to go take a look at this.

14:50.000 --> 14:58.000
I'll have a link to all of these in the in the show notes. The Ergodox EZ looks like a keyboard from the Tron movie.

14:58.000 --> 15:07.000
It's although it's not RGB, it's just it's it's a really nice looking split design with a lot of options.

15:07.000 --> 15:13.000
It says it's a cool keyboard. See, OK, you don't like it.

15:13.000 --> 15:18.000
I do not like it. The split Ergo thing makes a big difference for the RSI.

15:18.000 --> 15:23.000
Does it really? Mm hmm. I might have to try it. Yeah, that's that's why I started doing the split keyboard thing.

15:23.000 --> 15:28.000
It's my hands. I'm using the Apple not so magic keyboard again. Mm hmm. Yeah.

15:28.000 --> 15:34.000
And I feel like my hands are turning into the misshapen claw of someone with arthritis.

15:34.000 --> 15:39.000
Yes. Yeah, it really makes a big difference. I've got a couple of split keyboards that I like.

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
In fact, there's been a few that have been sent into the show, too.

15:41.000 --> 15:47.000
One that I feel negligent for not mentioning because it's really kind of up the alley of our audience is the Keyboardio.

15:47.000 --> 15:53.000
The model one, which we had a couple of people write in, I have it here in the studio more as a display piece.

15:53.000 --> 15:58.000
It's one of these keyboards that took a while to be developed because it was done out in the open.

15:58.000 --> 16:02.000
Hang on. Do you have a trophy keyboard? Yeah, I have a display keyboard. That's amazing.

16:02.000 --> 16:10.000
It's it's built into wood. Beautiful wood. And it's got, if I recall, an Arduino inside of it.

16:10.000 --> 16:15.000
And they are working on the model to right now the replacement.

16:15.000 --> 16:23.000
They also have, you should check this one out, a tiny little keyboard, a tiny little mechanical keyboard called the Arteris, I think.

16:23.000 --> 16:28.000
These are like keyboards you've never seen before unless you've specifically gone looking for these keyboards.

16:28.000 --> 16:34.000
They're awesome. And the the Keyboardio is it's it's really different.

16:34.000 --> 16:40.000
It has a different layout than a standard keyboard. But the idea is it's extremely versatile and programmable.

16:40.000 --> 16:47.000
And if that's something that you would enjoy, it's not really something I enjoy. That's why it's a display piece.

16:47.000 --> 16:52.000
It is it is an awesome keyboard for that. Maybe I should sell mine that I have in the studio.

16:52.000 --> 16:55.000
But I just love it. I have it. It's right there. I can see it right from sitting.

16:55.000 --> 17:01.000
So I should confess on the keyboard thing. Yeah, I did almost buy that programmable DOS keyboard.

17:01.000 --> 17:09.000
Yeah, there you go. But I then realized that I would spend so much time programming my keyboard.

17:09.000 --> 17:12.000
I wouldn't actually program the programs that people pay me to program.

17:12.000 --> 17:16.000
That's the thing is I just have to stop playing with it at a certain time. All right.

17:16.000 --> 17:21.000
So this is the thing I was going to mention earlier. Julian wrote in to tell me about this.

17:21.000 --> 17:29.000
He says, to add to your pile of keyboard feedback, I was a happy user of the Unicomp Model M, which is that really big IBM inspired one.

17:29.000 --> 17:36.000
Oh, yeah. But like yourself there, Mike, he said after typing on it repetitively for hours, my fingers really started to hurt.

17:36.000 --> 17:43.000
I eventually became clear to me that I was going to have to switch to something else to avoid RSI, which is like the same scenario I found myself in.

17:43.000 --> 17:45.000
So he does the research that a lot of us have done.

17:45.000 --> 17:53.000
And he said he came to understand that I want to get a keyboard, regardless of which one I get, that supports the QMK firmware,

17:53.000 --> 17:59.000
which is an open source project to make and flash custom firmware to a wide variety of keyboards.

17:59.000 --> 18:05.000
The level of customization possible is mind bending. Multiple layers, different key codes, all kinds of stuff.

18:05.000 --> 18:09.000
He said I did eventually settle for an ortho linear 40 percent keyboard.

18:09.000 --> 18:15.000
It does have arrow keys and it's called the Nui Mini and I absolutely love it.

18:15.000 --> 18:17.000
It's been very good with his RSI, he says.

18:17.000 --> 18:26.000
So this this QMK firmware is what I kind of learned about in all of this feedback once I managed to salvage them all from the Google Spam filter.

18:26.000 --> 18:33.000
And this QMK software project's goal is to develop a completely customizable, powerful and.

18:33.000 --> 18:41.000
They say enjoyable, I thought they're going to say embeddable, enjoyable firmware experience for any project, keyboard or otherwise.

18:41.000 --> 18:43.000
And it's God, this kind of thing is awesome.

18:43.000 --> 18:47.000
When you go there, they show you the types of keyboards they support.

18:47.000 --> 18:50.000
Of course, there's an open keyboard firmware project.

18:50.000 --> 18:53.000
I love it. God damn it, people.

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
It's so ridiculous.

18:55.000 --> 19:01.000
I just I guess I didn't even appreciate how deep this rabbit hole goes because I'm just now getting to this layer.

19:01.000 --> 19:09.000
Ironically, I am in the market for a keyboard, but I'm not sure that I can handle like the we stole this from the 1980s Tron movie.

19:09.000 --> 19:17.000
And so the 40 percent thing I have to say, though, is starting to intrigue me because space is always a premium on my desk because I'm a slob.

19:17.000 --> 19:22.000
I like to have diagrams up because these stupid.

19:22.000 --> 19:28.000
At some point, I'm actually going to do that episode I keep threatening to do about embedded programming and why it's a pain in the ass.

19:28.000 --> 19:34.000
But needless to say, I have to have a lot of documentation, like physical documentation.

19:34.000 --> 19:41.000
I mean, not not like a tab. I'm laughing because I've got right here some documentation, physical documentation.

19:41.000 --> 19:47.000
I have like an iPad with like the other documentation and I'd like just like papers and papers and the stupid keyboard.

19:47.000 --> 19:51.000
This magic keyboard is like so big. Yeah, right.

19:51.000 --> 19:56.000
So I am in the market. But what do I get other than space saving for 40 percent?

19:56.000 --> 20:00.000
The question is, do you really need like the number pad? No, I hate number pad site.

20:00.000 --> 20:03.000
Yeah. And all that stuff. That's what you're kind of just trading that. OK.

20:03.000 --> 20:07.000
And, you know, truthfully, I really haven't missed it.

20:07.000 --> 20:12.000
I thought, you know, because back in my I.T. days, I'd be busting an IP addresses all day on that number pad.

20:12.000 --> 20:15.000
And I thought, well, I need of course I need a number pad, but you really don't.

20:15.000 --> 20:20.000
If you look at your keyboard and you look from control button to control button, that's all you really need.

20:20.000 --> 20:25.000
And then if they can work the arrow keys and the home and insert and end and page up and page down in a way that works for me, I'm set.

20:25.000 --> 20:29.000
Although if you're really hardcore and you have like the keyboard, I have currently the code keyboard.

20:29.000 --> 20:34.000
You can program a layer to allow them shortcuts to be the arrow keys.

20:34.000 --> 20:40.000
Yeah, that is rad that I do love that stuff. There is a time and place for it, to be honest with you.

20:40.000 --> 20:47.000
And so this was going to be my ask to the audience is so we've explored this keyboard stuff just so we don't go on and on forever about it.

20:47.000 --> 20:51.000
What are other kind of because we don't have a chance of avoiding that.

20:51.000 --> 20:57.000
But what are other kind of modifications maybe that aren't as obvious? Like I recently talked about monitor and keyboard.

20:57.000 --> 21:05.000
But what are other modifications to our workspaces that are maybe not as obvious that have helped you work better from home or helped you work better at your office?

21:05.000 --> 21:13.000
Because I've recently just invested a little bit in improving my home, quote unquote, as it is because it's the RV.

21:13.000 --> 21:22.000
But I needed a a really kind of breakdown collapsible setup that didn't take forever to set up or didn't take forever to break down.

21:22.000 --> 21:29.000
And I've kind of gotten there and I'm really loving it, but I want to just refine it a little bit before I talk about it.

21:29.000 --> 21:34.000
And so I'd love to get people's tips on what they've done to make their workspace even better and more awesome.

21:34.000 --> 21:40.000
Because I feel like if we can make that like interacting with the computer with a better keyboard makes a difference.

21:40.000 --> 21:43.000
It's a physical object that you're touching all day long.

21:43.000 --> 21:51.000
And when it's something that I mean, maybe delights you is a little much, but something that at least spark some level of joy when you touch it.

21:51.000 --> 21:57.000
I think it's actually worth investing in. I knew you were going to Marie Kondo me. I was waiting.

21:57.000 --> 22:00.000
I'm so happy you didn't try to do the accent, though, because that could have been problematic.

22:00.000 --> 22:08.000
I was trying not to go so cliche, but I can give you one suggestion on this because it is literally the problem I was whining about on the pre-show.

22:08.000 --> 22:16.000
The big thing that keeps me on the iMac Pro when I'm at my, quote unquote, workstation is somebody wants to pop into a Google Meet.

22:16.000 --> 22:19.000
I don't know why I keep saying Zoom. I do Google Meets more often.

22:19.000 --> 22:28.000
And I can just do that with reasonable confidence and not have to worry about it and hook up the mic or do crazy Bluetooth.

22:28.000 --> 22:29.000
I know what you mean.

22:29.000 --> 22:30.000
That never seems to work.

22:30.000 --> 22:38.000
Where on the Thaleo, because like the two workstations like side by side, it's like honestly, it's easier for me to take those calls on an iPad.

22:38.000 --> 22:47.000
Yeah. Like, is there a monitor that I could give someone money for that is matte and is effectively like an iMac monitor, right?

22:47.000 --> 22:50.000
With the built in decent cameras and speakers.

22:50.000 --> 22:59.000
It doesn't need to be as good, but just something if I have to say, hey, I didn't get that document or, you know, just a quick Slack call, quick Google Meet, that would make my life tremendously easier.

22:59.000 --> 23:03.000
And honestly, it would make selling the iMac Pro a no brainer.

23:03.000 --> 23:16.000
I think the part of what contributes to the iMac Pro always working when you jump on a video call, because I've experienced this myself, is that state doesn't change.

23:16.000 --> 23:24.000
It's like always the default speakers and the default microphone and audio devices are not getting added and removed or changed as default or not from it.

23:24.000 --> 23:32.000
And so that steady state of the audio output and input setting is what makes it work all the time.

23:32.000 --> 23:39.000
And I and so the way you would get it working anything else is to replicate that level of stability on what audio interface is being used.

23:39.000 --> 23:43.000
And if you're using a headset or if you're using Bluetooth or not and just always use one set up.

23:43.000 --> 23:51.000
And that's because that's what I did is I got these kind of silly looking Corsair gaming headphones and they are kind of big.

23:51.000 --> 23:55.000
And so it's not great for video calls, so I don't always use them, but they're RF.

23:55.000 --> 23:58.000
They're not Bluetooth radio.

23:58.000 --> 24:01.000
And here's what's really good about them.

24:01.000 --> 24:08.000
They connect back to a USB dongle that's a sound card that's always connected because the dongle is always in.

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
It's always in.

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
So the sound, the in and out is always there.

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
I might not have the headphones on.

24:14.000 --> 24:23.000
I may not even have them near me, but that sound device is always my default in and out sound device always, and I've gone into pulse audio and I've disabled everything else.

24:23.000 --> 24:27.000
You can just go in there and into the configuration and disable them.

24:27.000 --> 24:29.000
And it works every time.

24:29.000 --> 24:32.000
And then I just turn the headphones on and they connect over RF and they're good to go.

24:32.000 --> 24:35.000
That actually sounds like a very viable solution to my problem.

24:35.000 --> 24:36.000
We should link that in the show notes.

24:36.000 --> 24:37.000
Yeah, I will try to do that.

24:37.000 --> 24:44.000
Yeah, so if you have tips like that stuff to just make it work for you all the time, coder.show slash contact, let us know.

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
Linode.com slash coder.

24:48.000 --> 24:53.000
Go there to get a $100 60 day credit towards your new account and you support the show.

24:53.000 --> 24:55.000
Linode is our cloud hosting provider.

24:55.000 --> 24:59.000
And recently I needed to set up a VPN beast.

24:59.000 --> 25:13.000
And you see Linode has data centers in 11 locations around the world, and I wanted something for my VPN that was spread out because the client I was connecting from can connect to three endpoints at a time.

25:13.000 --> 25:17.000
And of course, if you spread it out, better reliability, better performance.

25:17.000 --> 25:23.000
Linode made all of this possible because unlike entry level service providers, they don't they don't block the back end stuff.

25:23.000 --> 25:29.000
They let me reimagine the server just the way I needed so I could run this crazy proprietary, quote unquote, OS.

25:29.000 --> 25:30.000
It was really just something Linux based.

25:30.000 --> 25:36.000
But you know how these vendors work and it works because Linode is dedicated to offering the best virtualized cloud computing.

25:36.000 --> 25:39.000
If it runs on Linux, you can run it on Linode.

25:39.000 --> 25:46.000
And what I love about them and what gives me confidence to run my business infrastructure on them is that they're an independent company and they have been.

25:46.000 --> 25:55.000
They started in 2003 as one of the first companies in cloud computing three years before AWS because they had a passion for this field.

25:55.000 --> 25:57.000
They saw what technology back then.

25:57.000 --> 25:58.000
It was user mode Linux.

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
They saw what it could do.

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
And they saw how they could build a product around that.

26:02.000 --> 26:22.000
And now, of course, they've they've completely, totally modernized their infrastructure with blazing fast KVM host systems, 40 gigabit connections to the hypervisors, native SSDs, a brilliant interface with complete customizability and things like object storage load balancers and stack scripts that get you up and going in seconds.

26:22.000 --> 26:23.000
I think you're going to be really impressed.

26:23.000 --> 26:27.000
But if you go to Linode.com slash Coder, you get that hundred dollar credit.

26:27.000 --> 26:28.000
You can really cook with gas.

26:28.000 --> 26:29.000
You can see what I was doing.

26:29.000 --> 26:32.000
I was setting up these dedicated CPU rigs to try stuff out.

26:32.000 --> 26:34.000
And that's now where we do our encoding.

26:34.000 --> 26:38.000
That's where our next cloud instances work that syncs the files between us and our editors.

26:38.000 --> 26:44.000
And of course, there's all kinds of other things we use up there for things like clips and object storage is pretty powerful.

26:44.000 --> 26:48.000
There's so much you can do from hosting a website to running your infrastructure.

26:48.000 --> 26:49.000
Try it out.

26:49.000 --> 26:52.000
Linode.com slash Coder and see what it can do.

26:52.000 --> 26:57.000
Thanks to everybody who supports our sponsor, too, because that's what's making this the show free.

26:57.000 --> 27:05.000
You know, between sponsors like Linode and our QA team, it's possible for independent media to release these shows for free.

27:05.000 --> 27:09.000
So thank you to Linode and thank you to everybody who goes to Linode.com slash Coder.

27:11.000 --> 27:17.000
Now, we didn't really have a chance to try out Qt 6 before the show.

27:17.000 --> 27:20.000
Because they are hiding it somehow on their website.

27:20.000 --> 27:27.000
It seems like I saw a place I could go to kind of vaguely download Qt if I gave them all my information.

27:27.000 --> 27:31.000
But it kind of looked like it was version 5, so I didn't want to do it.

27:31.000 --> 27:36.000
But there is a new Qt out and it looks like they've re-architected around Vulkan.

27:36.000 --> 27:39.000
They've leveraged a more modern version of C++.

27:39.000 --> 27:42.000
They're using the next generation of QML in there.

27:42.000 --> 27:48.000
I mean, it looks potentially really good and you spotted Qt for Python 6 as well.

27:48.000 --> 27:52.000
Which I'm sure has you very interested. Have you looked into that at all?

27:52.000 --> 27:54.000
Much like you, I could not find the download link.

27:54.000 --> 27:55.000
Okay.

27:55.000 --> 27:58.000
So I did want to. That was part of my plan for today.

27:58.000 --> 28:03.000
The other big thing is they're using Metal on the Apple stuff, which is kind of a big deal.

28:03.000 --> 28:06.000
This looks like a solid release.

28:06.000 --> 28:12.000
Long time listeners know that I have a tempestuous relationship at best with the cute people.

28:12.000 --> 28:14.000
I wasn't going to say anything.

28:14.000 --> 28:22.000
They're kind of like an old lover who you're not getting along with anymore because their pricing model is...

28:22.000 --> 28:26.000
Listen to the back catalog. I don't need to jump into this again.

28:26.000 --> 28:28.000
They have somewhat changed it.

28:28.000 --> 28:37.000
And at this point, I have to say, I think I'm going to send them a text and be like, hey, how are you doing?

28:37.000 --> 28:39.000
Get the hell out of here.

28:39.000 --> 28:48.000
Because it crosses enough pain points where we're doing all kinds of kind of custom monkey patch solutions to bring things together.

28:48.000 --> 28:52.000
That one, I'm pretty sure I can avoid breaking the GPL anyway.

28:52.000 --> 28:58.000
And two, even if I can't, or if I want to do something more embedded, there's a lot here.

28:58.000 --> 29:05.000
And the Python stuff in particular, since somehow, some way, I got convinced to become a Python shop.

29:05.000 --> 29:07.000
That's a story. That's a story we should tell.

29:07.000 --> 29:09.000
Okay, we can tell it right now.

29:09.000 --> 29:14.000
I accidentally got in a bunch of Python work and I hired a couple of guys who were like...

29:14.000 --> 29:15.000
You just sort of fell into it.

29:15.000 --> 29:17.000
Basically.

29:17.000 --> 29:22.000
Actually, listeners, all the Python clients are listeners of the show.

29:22.000 --> 29:27.000
And I hired some guys originally for...

29:27.000 --> 29:32.000
One guy was like a TypeScript guy and the other guy was willing to learn Ruby, but he was doing C sharp.

29:32.000 --> 29:36.000
And it turns out on the weekends, like their toy of choice was Python.

29:36.000 --> 29:44.000
So we got to the point of, well, almost like 70 something percent of the consulting work is Python now.

29:44.000 --> 29:47.000
Why don't we just keep doing things in Python?

29:47.000 --> 29:54.000
Now, I had to be dragged a little bit because I just have like so much experience in Ruby that it's kind of like...

29:54.000 --> 29:55.000
Starting over again.

29:55.000 --> 29:59.000
Yeah, although honestly, it took like a week and I was like, okay, this is great.

29:59.000 --> 30:02.000
And people can't mess with my indentations,

30:02.000 --> 30:08.000
which I did not know how grumpy I was about people indenting code in ways that I don't prefer.

30:08.000 --> 30:12.000
Until I had a language that forbade that.

30:12.000 --> 30:16.000
So for those who don't know, Python has a significant white space, right?

30:16.000 --> 30:17.000
You can't...

30:17.000 --> 30:22.000
The indentation matters like for the compiler or the interpreter.

30:22.000 --> 30:24.000
There's a few other things here, too.

30:24.000 --> 30:25.000
TensorFlow.

30:25.000 --> 30:28.000
Doing a large TensorFlow project in the new year.

30:28.000 --> 30:31.000
That's Python, right?

30:31.000 --> 30:36.000
Anything you want to do for in-house tooling on a Linux desktop, right?

30:36.000 --> 30:39.000
My iMac Pro aside, we are system 76.

30:39.000 --> 30:43.000
Not to be confused with system 75, which doesn't exist as far as I know.

30:43.000 --> 30:44.000
That'd be a great knockoff brand.

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
By great, I mean awful.

30:46.000 --> 30:50.000
Just like making Ubuntu touch phones, right?

30:50.000 --> 30:54.000
Although I have a corporation to register.

30:54.000 --> 31:01.000
So a lot of our tooling does have to go over to be Linux available if it can't be web.

31:01.000 --> 31:02.000
And what does that mean?

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
Python, right?

31:04.000 --> 31:07.000
But GTK is kind of tough to work with.

31:07.000 --> 31:08.000
It's cute.

31:08.000 --> 31:09.000
It would solve that problem.

31:09.000 --> 31:12.000
More and more, our clients are looking for weird...

31:12.000 --> 31:15.000
I want to get a Raspberry Pi and hook a screen to it.

31:15.000 --> 31:19.000
And huzzah, we're building our own little custom software on our own little...

31:19.000 --> 31:22.000
I won't say jerry-rigged, but kind of like...

31:22.000 --> 31:26.000
Well, I guess I will say kind of just like slap-together device.

31:26.000 --> 31:29.000
With a little dashboard running on a LCD screen kind of a thing.

31:29.000 --> 31:30.000
Exactly, right.

31:30.000 --> 31:31.000
And they're all Linux-based.

31:31.000 --> 31:33.000
And again, Qt would be great there.

31:33.000 --> 31:37.000
And if you want to do it, you could do it natively in Python.

31:37.000 --> 31:39.000
That's where all the support is in.

31:39.000 --> 31:42.000
Again, if we want to do the Qt route, Python.

31:42.000 --> 31:45.000
So it's getting to the point where...

31:45.000 --> 31:47.000
And this is going to be a curmudgeon old man thing.

31:47.000 --> 31:51.000
I have switched languages on platforms so many times in my life now.

31:51.000 --> 31:57.000
I would like a year or two where I just have like one language that is not JavaScript.

31:57.000 --> 31:58.000
Yes.

31:58.000 --> 31:59.000
That can do everything.

31:59.000 --> 32:00.000
I hear you.

32:00.000 --> 32:01.000
Reasonably well.

32:01.000 --> 32:03.000
And is well-supported, right?

32:03.000 --> 32:04.000
Do you think that's age?

32:04.000 --> 32:06.000
Because I've been feeling that way too.

32:06.000 --> 32:09.000
It's age and like having other shit going on and being busy.

32:09.000 --> 32:10.000
Yeah.

32:10.000 --> 32:11.000
You know, it's like...

32:11.000 --> 32:18.000
I was a little grumpier than I maybe should have been to someone who was trying to tell me about this new like zero-market share language.

32:18.000 --> 32:25.000
And I'm just like, yeah, but I can do all of that in Python and Ruby and C++.

32:25.000 --> 32:32.000
And all right, maybe not Objective-C, but it's time to let Objective-C...

32:32.000 --> 32:33.000
What?

32:33.000 --> 32:34.000
Oh, go ahead.

32:34.000 --> 32:35.000
Sorry.

32:35.000 --> 32:36.000
Finish that sentence?

32:36.000 --> 32:37.000
No, no, no.

32:37.000 --> 32:38.000
Never mind.

32:38.000 --> 32:39.000
We're good.

32:39.000 --> 32:40.000
No, come on.

32:40.000 --> 32:41.000
No, come on.

32:41.000 --> 32:42.000
Come on.

32:42.000 --> 32:43.000
It might be time to let Objective-C go.

32:43.000 --> 32:44.000
I got to...

32:44.000 --> 32:45.000
I got to...

32:45.000 --> 32:46.000
Oh, my God.

32:46.000 --> 32:47.000
I got to...

32:47.000 --> 32:49.000
Objective-C doesn't want me to call her anymore.

32:49.000 --> 32:51.000
Objective-C doesn't want me to text her.

32:51.000 --> 32:56.000
2020, I mean, there's been a lot that's happened, but this might be one of the biggest.

32:56.000 --> 32:57.000
Yeah, it's time to let it go.

32:57.000 --> 32:59.000
And honestly, Python is...

32:59.000 --> 33:04.000
The problems I have with Python or more, there's five billion ways for me to do things.

33:04.000 --> 33:05.000
And basically...

33:05.000 --> 33:06.000
Oh, my God.

33:06.000 --> 33:07.000
This is going to sound like a commercial.

33:07.000 --> 33:13.000
But basically, the language is, I think, incredibly intuitive in how things work.

33:13.000 --> 33:19.000
My only kind of pet peeve is I wish there was a little more standardization in API design

33:19.000 --> 33:21.000
on a lot of the packages.

33:21.000 --> 33:27.000
But, you know, I used to code in Objective-C and Ruby and, yeah, so can't really complain

33:27.000 --> 33:28.000
too much there.

33:28.000 --> 33:31.000
How much Python on the server action do you think you might potentially see?

33:31.000 --> 33:37.000
I'm doing a ton, a ton, ton, like the majority of the Python we're writing is server side.

33:37.000 --> 33:40.000
Yeah, that's the other appealing thing about Python, huh?

33:40.000 --> 33:44.000
Yeah, we're actually taking a look at fast API for a project coming up, which I think

33:44.000 --> 33:47.000
Wes had recommended about a month ago.

33:47.000 --> 33:49.000
So that's right now we're doing a lot of flask.

33:49.000 --> 33:52.000
God damn it, I'm a Python guy now.

33:52.000 --> 33:56.000
Yeah, this got weird, you know, because it's just that's that's really something quite

33:56.000 --> 33:57.000
the journey.

33:57.000 --> 34:02.000
And I could see maybe why it makes the M1 a little less convincing, too, because it's

34:02.000 --> 34:04.000
like this isn't this isn't really hitting that.

34:04.000 --> 34:06.000
I mean, you absolutely could do it, right?

34:06.000 --> 34:07.000
You absolutely could.

34:07.000 --> 34:12.000
But it's it's just not really the investment that's going to further that in particular.

34:12.000 --> 34:17.000
Well, and the other thing I should say is all the end devices with like the exception

34:17.000 --> 34:20.000
of I think we have one project that has an Android app right now, but that Android app

34:20.000 --> 34:26.000
is actually a ionic angular app are targeting Linux machines of some variety, whether they

34:26.000 --> 34:31.000
be servers running the one true server OS Sousa.

34:31.000 --> 34:33.000
Oh, right.

34:33.000 --> 34:39.000
You think I'd forget and the world's been so focused on sent us this last week.

34:39.000 --> 34:41.000
It's just I kind of had.

34:41.000 --> 34:42.000
I know.

34:42.000 --> 34:43.000
Yeah.

34:43.000 --> 34:48.000
Or they're like basically Raspberry Pi's were for some of our more frugal clients.

34:48.000 --> 34:50.000
Weird things they ordered from China.

34:50.000 --> 34:54.000
Weird arm devices that are like another arm device, but not quite.

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
There is documentation.

34:56.000 --> 35:01.000
It's in Mandarin and it runs their image of Linux.

35:01.000 --> 35:03.000
And that's it.

35:03.000 --> 35:06.000
And whatever weird bastard version of Ubuntu this is.

35:06.000 --> 35:09.000
Yeah, that is that is a weird thing that we're seeing.

35:09.000 --> 35:12.000
And it just really hasn't sorted itself out.

35:12.000 --> 35:16.000
And it's not like you can't just say, oh, well, arms new because it's been around since

35:16.000 --> 35:17.000
the 90s.

35:17.000 --> 35:19.000
It's not new, especially on these types of devices.

35:19.000 --> 35:21.000
Arm is not not new.

35:21.000 --> 35:24.000
The Raspberry Pi, though, has gotten what is close to a standard.

35:24.000 --> 35:30.000
If you'll allow the loose use of the term just because it has so many deployments and

35:30.000 --> 35:37.000
has such a large community around it, that it is almost the most sure bet, even though

35:37.000 --> 35:42.000
I wouldn't necessarily say it's production grade, even though I run several of them as

35:42.000 --> 35:43.000
servers at home.

35:43.000 --> 35:44.000
No, I would.

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
I'm using them for clients all the time.

35:46.000 --> 35:47.000
Yeah.

35:47.000 --> 35:48.000
Yeah.

35:48.000 --> 35:49.000
I mean, I mean, it's kind of impressive, right?

35:49.000 --> 35:52.000
Because I've been running it for about a year and a half, almost two years.

35:52.000 --> 35:58.000
And I've put them through hell, you know, really hot, like 100 degree, 105 degree ambient

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
temperatures, 108.

36:00.000 --> 36:01.000
I think I even got up to 109.

36:01.000 --> 36:03.000
Did you get that Elon Musk flamethrower?

36:03.000 --> 36:04.000
We're just like, all right.

36:04.000 --> 36:05.000
Yeah.

36:05.000 --> 36:08.000
Well, so I have this area in the RV that's inside a booth seat.

36:08.000 --> 36:09.000
So it's sealed up.

36:09.000 --> 36:14.000
And then I went down to Texas for the summer and it just gets to a point where you can't

36:14.000 --> 36:15.000
really cool it.

36:15.000 --> 36:17.000
Twenty twenty was wild.

36:17.000 --> 36:18.000
It was just a wild year.

36:18.000 --> 36:19.000
Lots a lot's gone on.

36:19.000 --> 36:22.000
And do you want to look back at some of it?

36:22.000 --> 36:23.000
We could save it, too.

36:23.000 --> 36:27.000
But I mean, does anybody want to look back at twenty twenty?

36:27.000 --> 36:32.000
I hope that twenty twenty is like a forest fire in a sense where everything kind of burns

36:32.000 --> 36:33.000
to the ground.

36:33.000 --> 36:38.000
In fact, some of it's still burning and then it grows back and it grows back differently.

36:38.000 --> 36:42.000
But like you look at twenty twenty, it's not what I think going into it at this point of

36:42.000 --> 36:46.000
the year, either one of you thought it either one of us thought it was going to be.

36:46.000 --> 36:50.000
I was I was I was an employee at this point in time.

36:50.000 --> 36:54.000
I think I was just about to find out about the Cloud Guru acquisition of Linux Academy

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
or maybe I maybe we just had.

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
You had a year full of travel.

36:58.000 --> 37:01.000
So we were like, don't think the show is going to be doable.

37:01.000 --> 37:03.000
You're going to be flying constantly.

37:03.000 --> 37:04.000
That changed.

37:04.000 --> 37:05.000
It's wild.

37:05.000 --> 37:08.000
I have I have family members that have lost this.

37:08.000 --> 37:09.000
I mean, it's just been crazy.

37:09.000 --> 37:13.000
But there have been a few wins, I think, in a weird way.

37:13.000 --> 37:15.000
I wanted to start with V.S.

37:15.000 --> 37:19.000
Code and GitHub because it's been a really strong year for this is the year of V.S.

37:19.000 --> 37:19.000
Code.

37:19.000 --> 37:21.000
It's every everybody's using V.S.

37:21.000 --> 37:21.000
Code.

37:21.000 --> 37:26.000
That's it feels like, you know, quote unquote, everybody.

37:26.000 --> 37:30.000
But also GitHub didn't manage to screw it up for another year.

37:30.000 --> 37:32.000
Post Microsoft acquisition.

37:32.000 --> 37:33.000
Right.

37:33.000 --> 37:37.000
They they avoided the merger death so far and it even took them a minute.

37:37.000 --> 37:41.000
But they took a strong stance with YouTube DL that which I was super surprised about.

37:41.000 --> 37:42.000
Yeah.

37:42.000 --> 37:43.000
Yeah.

37:43.000 --> 37:44.000
So that's a good sign.

37:44.000 --> 37:48.000
I think I doesn't mean don't stay on alert.

37:48.000 --> 37:52.000
But I think as far as a software story goes, the GitHub V.S.

37:52.000 --> 37:58.000
Code kind of Microsoft story, Microsoft to write is still one of the more interesting ones.

37:58.000 --> 38:01.000
This has been for a couple of years running now, I think it's going to be interesting.

38:01.000 --> 38:02.000
Is V.S.

38:02.000 --> 38:05.000
Code going to be like text me where it owns all the V.S.

38:05.000 --> 38:06.000
Code cross platform, too.

38:06.000 --> 38:09.000
So but it like owns the market for a while and then something else comes up.

38:09.000 --> 38:15.000
Maybe I sort of think it's going to choke out really any editors that want to come out.

38:15.000 --> 38:16.000
Oh, I think so.

38:16.000 --> 38:16.000
Yeah.

38:16.000 --> 38:17.000
Yeah, I agree.

38:17.000 --> 38:21.000
I just recently reset it up on a new laptop that I got.

38:21.000 --> 38:25.000
And, you know, you search for Linux and there's like themes in there to integrate it better

38:25.000 --> 38:26.000
with the look of your desktop.

38:26.000 --> 38:29.000
It looks like it's a local native text editor now.

38:29.000 --> 38:32.000
There's a pop OS theme that looks really good.

38:32.000 --> 38:34.000
It's like, huh?

38:34.000 --> 38:35.000
Yeah.

38:35.000 --> 38:40.000
And, you know, I installed SFTP support so I can just open up files on my remote home

38:40.000 --> 38:41.000
server and look at it right there in V.S.

38:41.000 --> 38:42.000
Code.

38:42.000 --> 38:44.000
And of course, I've got Docker compose support in there.

38:44.000 --> 38:48.000
So it's showing me if I make a mistake with YAML because it's YAML.

38:48.000 --> 38:52.000
I mean, it renders fonts better than IntelliJ on pop.

38:52.000 --> 38:53.000
Just saying.

38:53.000 --> 38:56.000
It's been an interesting year for them.

38:56.000 --> 38:57.000
I think also I were talking about Microsoft.

38:57.000 --> 38:59.000
It's worth talking about Apple.

38:59.000 --> 39:03.000
They clearly had a knock it out of the park release with the M1.

39:03.000 --> 39:09.000
But I think in general for Apple, they've they've really been kind of impressive this year.

39:09.000 --> 39:10.000
They've kind of won.

39:10.000 --> 39:14.000
I think it was the Wall Street Journal, so they've been recession proof in a sense.

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
They're crushing it in money.

39:16.000 --> 39:19.000
But they're also the iPhone, really solid iPhone this year.

39:19.000 --> 39:22.000
The Apple Watch is probably the best Apple Watch they've ever done.

39:22.000 --> 39:25.000
HomePod mini is a great product.

39:25.000 --> 39:28.000
And, you know, of course, the M1.

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
So it feels like Apple had a super strong year, too.

39:30.000 --> 39:34.000
They're not really slowing down like you might have thought a couple of years ago they were going to do.

39:34.000 --> 39:39.000
Yeah, I think they made the course correction for their pro users and just have I mean,

39:39.000 --> 39:41.000
they're just dunking on everybody else right now.

39:41.000 --> 39:48.000
And they are they're playing a clever, a clever cat and mouse game with federal regulators.

39:48.000 --> 39:53.000
The FTC just announced that they're demanding how a bunch of tech companies handle privacy.

39:53.000 --> 39:55.000
And I don't think Apple was in there.

39:55.000 --> 40:02.000
You know, and then also with regulators, they were they were preemptive with folks that was it make less than a million dollars on the app store?

40:02.000 --> 40:05.000
That was the new app store pricing million bucks.

40:05.000 --> 40:07.000
Yeah, I mean, that was that was clever.

40:07.000 --> 40:10.000
They're playing a game there where they're getting ahead of some of this stuff.

40:10.000 --> 40:13.000
So they're they're staying fairly nimble.

40:13.000 --> 40:19.000
I've been accused a lot on the show as being really negative towards Apple, but I have to give it to them where they've where they've had a solid win there.

40:19.000 --> 40:27.000
But now on the other side, I think also kind of what I was talking about earlier about refining my work from home set up.

40:27.000 --> 40:34.000
So what I have now is pretty close to what I would consider one of my best workspaces ever at home.

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
And that wasn't easy in an RV.

40:36.000 --> 40:39.000
It's like I really like sitting there and using it again.

40:39.000 --> 40:42.000
You know that feeling when you're like, oh, God, this is so great.

40:42.000 --> 40:47.000
And part of what has enabled that was my return to the plasma desktop.

40:47.000 --> 40:50.000
It's truly a power user's desktop.

40:50.000 --> 41:05.000
If you're particular about size of windows, where they open, how they handle multiple virtual desktops and monitors and all those little things like how big a panel is, where that panel is, how the task manager behaves.

41:05.000 --> 41:12.000
If you want to like refine every little thing about your desktop experience, plasma is that.

41:12.000 --> 41:19.000
And I can say now, having used it for several years and I just took some time off and spent a lot of time on Pop OS and Gnome Shell and really liked it.

41:19.000 --> 41:25.000
But coming back to plasma, it was like coming back to my own place after visiting my parents' house.

41:25.000 --> 41:27.000
It was like, oh, yeah, I really I really like this place.

41:27.000 --> 41:30.000
I've really decked it out the way I like it. You know what I mean?

41:30.000 --> 41:34.000
Yeah, I mean, that's that's kind of how I feel about pop except when Gnome crashes.

41:34.000 --> 41:38.000
Well, and I feel like plasma has a better architecture in that sense.

41:38.000 --> 41:42.000
Yes, it does. They've technically they're a little sounder. And I think, you know, Qt's pretty great.

41:42.000 --> 41:48.000
Plasma is a lot of like it's like if you prefer driving a standard over an automatic, you know what I'm talking about here.

41:48.000 --> 41:50.000
I do. It's like you just get a little more control.

41:50.000 --> 41:56.000
You just have your little directly more control of what your desktop experience is, but it takes a little bit more work.

41:56.000 --> 42:01.000
And the project has just killed it release after release after release this year.

42:01.000 --> 42:11.000
They've killed it. They've really done a great job. I've been running Neon and Fedora and Arch where I'm running on really cutting edge plasma releases.

42:11.000 --> 42:16.000
And it just incrementally gets better. It doesn't screw up my custom settings.

42:16.000 --> 42:21.000
It's a desktop that respects the intelligence of their user and it doesn't try to dumb shit down.

42:21.000 --> 42:28.000
And the thing is, is that that manifests in like just how even the frickin screenshot tool works or how the clipboard manager works.

42:28.000 --> 42:35.000
Of course, it has a built in clipboard manager or how the notification systems work or like the networking applet.

42:35.000 --> 42:41.000
It's all it just it has respect for the intelligence of the operator.

42:41.000 --> 42:47.000
And it takes advantage of the fact that I'm sitting on a super powerful workstation.

42:47.000 --> 42:51.000
So plasma desktop, you get one of my best of 2020 this year.

42:51.000 --> 42:59.000
Just thank you guys for solid project this year. And if you're looking to change it up and you want to give it a go, you have my recommendation.

42:59.000 --> 43:04.000
You can go with really curated experiences like you'll get with Sousa or Manjaro.

43:04.000 --> 43:14.000
It can be good places to start or you can get a really vanilla experience and build it up from there with something like Arch or Fedora, which is what I have now started doing.

43:14.000 --> 43:19.000
I don't know if I'd recommend starting there. Kubuntu is also another good starting point as well.

43:19.000 --> 43:25.000
Thank you for letting me have that. I appreciate it because I know it's a little ridiculous, but I felt like I needed to get off my chest.

43:25.000 --> 43:32.000
You mentioned Sousa. So, you know, you tick the box. You should give it to Sousa.

43:32.000 --> 43:39.000
Of course, we have to mention the new religion spreading around the development world. And that is, of course, the good news of rust.

43:39.000 --> 43:44.000
All hail rust. Once you let rust into your heart, everything changes. Rust is love.

43:44.000 --> 43:50.000
I don't think we need to say more about it because we have dozens of hours of saying a lot about it.

43:50.000 --> 43:54.000
Yeah, I mean, it's just obvious. Rust had an amazing year.

43:54.000 --> 44:01.000
What do you think about mentioning the work from home slash what you and I used to call remote working?

44:01.000 --> 44:05.000
Remember when it used to be called remote work? But what do you think of that?

44:05.000 --> 44:08.000
Because you and I have covered that extensively throughout the run of the show.

44:08.000 --> 44:15.000
We talked about it in our Coderly report, but now it's essentially been, I think, mostly a positive.

44:15.000 --> 44:20.000
If you look at 2020, it's been positive for workers in the tech sector, at least.

44:20.000 --> 44:28.000
I mean, it did push IT departments really hard and it required new applications and solutions to be built really fast.

44:28.000 --> 44:29.000
Isn't that nice?

44:29.000 --> 44:30.000
It is, though, in a way.

44:30.000 --> 44:32.000
No, I think it is nice.

44:32.000 --> 44:41.000
Although I heard from a listener who said, yeah, except for we put off an infrastructure upgrade project until next year now, so we're really going to be deep in the technical debt for another year.

44:41.000 --> 44:46.000
But I'm sure a lot of places had to do that. But work from home is kind of like the new normal now.

44:46.000 --> 44:54.000
For a certain type of worker, that's probably a lot of people in our audience, it seems like some form of it will probably stick around.

44:54.000 --> 44:55.000
I think so.

44:55.000 --> 45:03.000
I could see like a work from home a few days a week, work from home whenever you don't feel well, work from home around the holidays.

45:03.000 --> 45:08.000
And then some places could even just you determine when you work from home, like Red Hat does this a little bit already.

45:08.000 --> 45:13.000
You know, you have the spot if you want to come in and work at the office. Otherwise, you choose to work from home for some positions.

45:13.000 --> 45:16.000
Yeah, I don't see a compelling reason to want to go back.

45:16.000 --> 45:19.000
I mean, we've been you and I both been doing it for a long time, though.

45:19.000 --> 45:24.000
Yeah, it is definitely I mean, there is that there is that lower bandwidth communication aspect of it.

45:24.000 --> 45:32.000
There's there's there is no doubt in my mind that if all of the people that we work with were operating out of the building that I am in right now,

45:32.000 --> 45:37.000
if all of us here at JB were working out of here, we'd be doing next level stuff.

45:37.000 --> 45:39.000
We would be at a whole nother level than we are.

45:39.000 --> 45:42.000
I guess that's fair. Assuming the money was there to pay for it.

45:42.000 --> 45:45.000
Right. But that's the big thing for small guys like us.

45:45.000 --> 45:48.000
Yeah. Do you want a landlord breathing down your throat if you have a bad month?

45:48.000 --> 45:54.000
Right. And the truth of the matter is the tradeoff is that we can work with people that you're in Florida.

45:54.000 --> 45:57.000
I'm in Seattle. You know, we can we can work together.

45:57.000 --> 46:00.000
We can sit here in an evening and have this conversation.

46:00.000 --> 46:03.000
So it's the good that clearly outweighs the bad of it.

46:03.000 --> 46:11.000
But I think kind of along with all of that is what's kind of nice to see kind of maybe get pulled back a little bit is the travel for a meeting kind of stuff.

46:11.000 --> 46:14.000
Yeah. That really can now just be taken care of in a video call.

46:14.000 --> 46:17.000
I have mixed feelings on this.

46:17.000 --> 46:21.000
Same for like status meetings on long term projects.

46:21.000 --> 46:25.000
I think it's crazy that I used to like fly across the country to do a status meeting and fly back.

46:25.000 --> 46:33.000
Right. To me, that's nuts. But I think I'd be pretty resistant to doing that going forward unless there's like hardware integration stuff that has to be done.

46:33.000 --> 46:40.000
By the way, I think that's a real sign that something shifted when you look back at what used to be considered normal and go, I can't believe I used to do that.

46:40.000 --> 46:50.000
I used to have I think I still technically do, but I'm not renewing a lounge membership because, you know, I was flying at least once a month, if not twice, three times a month.

46:50.000 --> 46:53.000
And I haven't flown since the pandemic.

46:53.000 --> 46:59.000
I've been home. Right. Yeah. And I just like it seems like, of course, I'm not renewing that. That's ridiculous.

46:59.000 --> 47:08.000
The only thing I will say, though, is I think the death of trade shows is actually bad with the networking factors way worse this year.

47:08.000 --> 47:13.000
Networking factors worse. You know, GitHub universe just happened.

47:13.000 --> 47:20.000
It's it's weird because like for the show is I do enjoy when they all those tech companies kind of just stream their sessions so we can have the content.

47:20.000 --> 47:29.000
I don't have to like deal with that crap. Yes. But for my own work, most of the value of going to a show and GitHub universe is a bad example.

47:29.000 --> 47:34.000
But any show, right, is not the actual sessions. Right.

47:34.000 --> 47:38.000
The sessions are generally a waste of time with everything online.

47:38.000 --> 47:45.000
You just lose all of that, all of that, like meeting up at the pub or bumping into each other for coffee or whatever.

47:45.000 --> 47:56.000
Which for me is a huge factor because like scale every year, I'm going out to lunch, I'm going out to dinner with the audience, you know, listeners of this show.

47:56.000 --> 48:04.000
We've we have packed a porch or I guess a deck of a restaurant during lunch, one of the scales a couple of years ago. It was.

48:04.000 --> 48:09.000
It was an opportunity for me to meet the audience. And that's that's been gone.

48:09.000 --> 48:18.000
But additionally, just talking to you from like a business standpoint, when everything's online, it's available to everybody.

48:18.000 --> 48:22.000
And there's really there's there's there's no there's nothing exclusive about it.

48:22.000 --> 48:28.000
Like for me to cover an event, I have to travel there and I have to like talk to people.

48:28.000 --> 48:31.000
And it's like it's journalism in a sense because I'm interviewing people.

48:31.000 --> 48:36.000
I'm walking around with if people probably 98 percent of the audience has never seen me. I look like a moron.

48:36.000 --> 48:40.000
I've got these huge studio headphones on. I've got a Zoom recorder.

48:40.000 --> 48:44.000
I've got I've got a Sennheiser microphone with XLR cable.

48:44.000 --> 48:50.000
It's way too long because I never can find the right cable. And I'm walking around conferences like this.

48:50.000 --> 48:54.000
And God bless Wes and others who put up with me while I do this.

48:54.000 --> 49:02.000
But it's it's like a form of journalism in a sense. And that's kind of gone now because I can't really do that.

49:02.000 --> 49:09.000
I've tried a little bit like having chats and stuff, but the reality is it's just it's just has not been the same.

49:09.000 --> 49:19.000
So that's from a business standpoint. I've kind of missed that because I felt like I used to be able to go get something kind of unique and exclusive for my shows that I went and I did the hard work for.

49:19.000 --> 49:27.000
And that's gone. It's really not been the same. And that's kind of been a bummer from like a business standpoint and adding something dynamic and new to the shows.

49:27.000 --> 49:33.000
Now, do you think they'll come back? Yeah, I think so. I think because so many people are missing that thing about them.

49:33.000 --> 49:41.000
Also, I think humans, you and I, I think maybe are not as social as the average bear.

49:41.000 --> 49:52.000
Because like a lot of people at the companies that I've participated at, either through employment or through contracts, it seems like the majority of the staff miss being around each other.

49:52.000 --> 50:09.000
And they have like all of these really kind of ludicrous and massively time wasting meetings where they're just like, come and hang out and chat or let's have breakfast together or we're going to have a special talker tell us about something completely unrelated to work.

50:09.000 --> 50:14.000
Because it's like we're hanging out together and they're desperately trying to come up with ways to fill time.

50:14.000 --> 50:24.000
And I've seen this from multiple places and it seems ludicrous to me because my God, why would I want to spend any additional time in a Zoom call that I don't have to?

50:24.000 --> 50:35.000
But people seem to crave these things. And so I have to remind myself that there's also that driving factor out there that perhaps is not the call that you and I feel.

50:35.000 --> 50:43.000
But there are many who do feel that call. And I actually wouldn't be surprised if there isn't a bit of a resurgence.

50:43.000 --> 50:46.000
Perhaps they're kind of they kind of come back with some gusto.

50:46.000 --> 50:52.000
I think some people that tried it out virtually this year and are going to try it out virtually in 2021 will then launch a physical conference.

50:52.000 --> 50:58.000
So I actually think we're going to see a surge a little bit. But I bet you more and more they're live streamed as well.

50:58.000 --> 51:00.000
Yeah. Yeah, I think so. We'll see.

51:00.000 --> 51:06.000
I do not like Zoom meetings, but they're like the home assistant conference was this weekend.

51:06.000 --> 51:11.000
And I actually really enjoyed it. It was not particularly flashy, but they did a good job.

51:11.000 --> 51:15.000
They put an effort into trying to do a good presentation and do things a little bit differently.

51:15.000 --> 51:23.000
And they used a platform designed to be an online conference where you had a lobby, a reception area.

51:23.000 --> 51:26.000
Then you had the speaking rooms and different chat rooms for each.

51:26.000 --> 51:35.000
And I was actually able to get in touch with a speaker. And, you know, I kind of I got just a hint of that original experience for a brief moment.

51:35.000 --> 51:41.000
So it is possible out there. But it has been overall just a huge shift.

51:41.000 --> 51:45.000
The virtual conferences, the virtual meetings, the virtual family get togethers.

51:45.000 --> 51:49.000
We did two different get togethers on Thanksgiving over Zoom.

51:49.000 --> 51:51.000
Of course, I absolutely hate it.

51:51.000 --> 51:56.000
I thought it'd be better if the normals knew about video conferencing, but now I hate it.

51:56.000 --> 52:01.000
Yeah, I hate it. I really don't think there's any redeeming qualities to the Zoom stuff.

52:01.000 --> 52:08.000
Oh, I go back to the phone in a heartbeat. I just. Oh, and nobody can get their audio any good.

52:08.000 --> 52:13.000
And as somebody who does production for a living, I just the bad audio just drives me crazy.

52:13.000 --> 52:18.000
And then the camera angles and all of it, the whole thing is just absolutely horrendous.

52:18.000 --> 52:26.000
But big win for for Zoom and all of them, I suppose. And of course, now Slack owned by frickin Salesforce, which is weird.

52:26.000 --> 52:33.000
Yeah. All right. Twenty twenty. Knock it off. Thank you to the QA team, Coder QA at Coder QA dot co.

52:33.000 --> 52:36.000
I did wrap up the Black Friday sale, but you can still support the show.

52:36.000 --> 52:43.000
You get a limited ad feed and you get our Coderly report and you get the warm fuzzies of making this show possible.

52:43.000 --> 52:52.000
Also, go find our sponsor, Cloud Guru, on social media, which they're at slash a cloud guru on YouTube, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram.

52:52.000 --> 52:58.000
Really, pretty much all of the places where people have a presence just slash a cloud guru and you can find them there.

52:58.000 --> 53:02.000
Mr. Dominic, is there anything we should mention or plug this week before we get out of here?

53:02.000 --> 53:04.000
No, just keep an eye out for that Coder quarterly.

53:04.000 --> 53:09.000
And because I think you and I should discuss when we want to record that because it's the end of the quarter.

53:09.000 --> 53:12.000
And we're going to keep this lifetime. I think this worked pretty well.

53:12.000 --> 53:16.000
It worked well. So join us the new lifetime. See if I can do this time math.

53:16.000 --> 53:21.000
It's Mondays. It's at five p.m. Pacific, eight p.m. Eastern.

53:21.000 --> 53:25.000
And the show kicks off somewhere in there, usually about five thirty eight thirty p.m.

53:25.000 --> 53:29.000
Whatever it's going to be a little hangout time in, maybe do a little video games, chat with you all.

53:29.000 --> 53:32.000
And then we're going to do a show. And it's it's a Monday happy hour.

53:32.000 --> 53:35.000
It's time to kick back and enjoy your evening with Mike and Chris.

53:35.000 --> 53:38.000
And we'd love to have you there, preferably in a bathrobe. Yes.

53:38.000 --> 53:42.000
Yes. Actually, next week, let's all keep we'll keep our bathrooms. Just set it aside.

53:42.000 --> 53:45.000
Get it ready so you don't forget. Join the livestream in your bathroom.

53:45.000 --> 53:51.000
We'll all do a little bit of testing and then we can do feedback in the chat room and make sure we get a high quality design.

53:51.000 --> 53:53.000
This robe thing's going to go in place, as I tell you what.

53:53.000 --> 53:56.000
Yeah, I feel like you're very serious about the robe thing.

53:56.000 --> 54:00.000
He's at Dumanuco on Twitter. His company is at the Mad Bottering.

54:00.000 --> 54:04.000
I'm Chris Lass on Twitter and the podcast network is at Jupiter Signal.

54:04.000 --> 54:08.000
And yes, there's even one more the show at Coder Radio Show.

54:08.000 --> 54:13.000
Links to what we talked about today are at Coder dot show slash three nine two.

54:13.000 --> 54:19.000
My God, we're almost a 400. And from there you can get our contact form, which feedbacks a huge part of the show.

54:19.000 --> 54:22.000
Our RSS feeds all of it at Coder dot show.

54:22.000 --> 54:25.000
Thanks so much for joining us on this week's episode of the Coder Radio program.

54:25.000 --> 54:41.000
We'll see you right back here next week.
