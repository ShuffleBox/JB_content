00:00.000 --> 00:15.880
This is KOTORadio, episode 401 for February 15th, Twenty-Twenty-One.

00:15.880 --> 00:16.880
Well hello there!

00:16.880 --> 00:17.880
Come on in and get cozy.

00:17.880 --> 00:22.200
It's Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show, taking a pragmatic look at the art and business

00:22.200 --> 00:25.620
of software development and the world of technology.

00:25.620 --> 00:27.280
This episode is brought to you by a cloud guru.

00:27.280 --> 00:32.800
A cloud guru now includes Cloud Playground, Azure AWS, or Google Cloud Sandboxes on ACG's

00:32.800 --> 00:33.800
credit card.

00:33.800 --> 00:34.800

00:38.000 --> 00:43.280
My name is Chris, and joining us, like the host of a podcast that he is, it's Mr. Dominic.

00:43.280 --> 00:44.280
Hello Mike.

00:44.280 --> 00:45.280
Unauthorized recording detected.

00:45.280 --> 00:46.280
Yeah, 401.

00:46.280 --> 00:47.280
I mean, how fun is that?

00:47.280 --> 00:48.280
401.

00:48.280 --> 00:49.280
It's perfect.

00:49.280 --> 00:54.280
Now I'm psyched for 404, like that's going to be a good one.

00:54.280 --> 00:57.400
I think 404, we should just actually put a broken link in the feed.

00:57.400 --> 00:58.400
Oh good.

00:58.400 --> 01:02.360
You know, if that somehow lined up with April Fools or something, that would be amazing.

01:02.360 --> 01:03.360
That would be choice.

01:03.360 --> 01:04.360
That would be choice.

01:04.360 --> 01:11.960
So last week, previously on Coder Radio, you had acquired a ThinkPad, and I've been stalking

01:11.960 --> 01:16.520
you on Twitter, and it seems like a journey has commenced for you.

01:16.520 --> 01:20.960
Curious how the initial Mike tries a ThinkPad experiment is going.

01:20.960 --> 01:23.280
So I love the ThinkPad.

01:23.280 --> 01:24.280
Oh, okay.

01:24.280 --> 01:25.840
Remind us which one you got.

01:25.840 --> 01:30.520
It's a ThinkPad Yoga 380 or 360.

01:30.520 --> 01:31.520
It's a year old.

01:31.520 --> 01:36.080
It's not the latest model, because I took advantage of the, they had a like 40% discount

01:36.080 --> 01:42.040
for Presidents Day, and unfortunately this is just a machine for a job, right?

01:42.040 --> 01:43.680
But I finally get it.

01:43.680 --> 01:48.760
I mean, you know, the People's Republic spies aside, great machine.

01:48.760 --> 01:49.760
Okay.

01:49.760 --> 01:50.760
Is this a two-in-one?

01:50.760 --> 01:53.400
Does it like fold around this one?

01:53.400 --> 01:55.760
It folds all the way back and it has a built-in pen.

01:55.760 --> 01:56.760
Yeah.

01:56.760 --> 01:57.960
Oh, that's kind of cool.

01:57.960 --> 02:00.560
And rocking Windows 10, of course.

02:00.560 --> 02:01.560
Windows 10 Pro, baby.

02:01.560 --> 02:02.560
Like a baller.

02:02.560 --> 02:03.560
Okay.

02:03.560 --> 02:04.560
All right.

02:04.560 --> 02:05.880
Best Linux distro ever.

02:05.880 --> 02:06.880
What's drawing you to this?

02:06.880 --> 02:09.200
Because, so I've got a couple of ThinkPads.

02:09.200 --> 02:12.640
So I think maybe I know, but give me an idea of what it is.

02:12.640 --> 02:13.640
To the ThinkPad in particular?

02:13.640 --> 02:14.640
Yeah.

02:14.640 --> 02:16.720
Cause I mean, you could, you know, you could get any Windows laptop.

02:16.720 --> 02:23.480
So I actually had it ordered a Dell XPS 13 and through some shenanigans of chip shortages,

02:23.480 --> 02:28.160
they amended the shipping date to be beyond when the project is supposed to start.

02:28.160 --> 02:29.640
So I canceled that order.

02:29.640 --> 02:30.640
Yeah.

02:30.640 --> 02:35.760
And I asked around on the Twitters, people keep recommending the ThinkPads.

02:35.760 --> 02:39.280
So it just so happened when I went to Lenovo's website, they were doing a Presidents Day

02:39.280 --> 02:42.240
sale and they could guarantee shipping within a week.

02:42.240 --> 02:47.000
And it was like, well, if I buy this slightly older model that still looks pretty good and

02:47.000 --> 02:49.640
you know, this is, this is a cattle, not a pet, right?

02:49.640 --> 02:53.480
It's not like, you know, so I just went with it.

02:53.480 --> 02:58.920
I was having a surprisingly hard time bootcamp on the iMac Pro, just it would crash every

02:58.920 --> 03:01.520
time it fell asleep.

03:01.520 --> 03:04.200
I kept resetting the SMC controller.

03:04.200 --> 03:09.880
And then I found out that like I had to enable some crazy parallels mode to do WSL or any

03:09.880 --> 03:12.040
kind of other hypervisor on.

03:12.040 --> 03:15.360
So it's just like, yeah, that's if you're running into VM, cause I tried multiple things.

03:15.360 --> 03:16.560
I'm just like, you know what?

03:16.560 --> 03:17.560
This is a windows job.

03:17.560 --> 03:20.240
I need a windows machine relative to the job.

03:20.240 --> 03:21.240
It's a small expense.

03:21.240 --> 03:22.240
Right?

03:22.240 --> 03:23.240
Yeah.

03:23.240 --> 03:24.240
Yeah.

03:24.240 --> 03:27.280
And I've always resisted the ThinkPad thing because of, well, there's a lot of them.

03:27.280 --> 03:30.960
Well, I don't know if people remember this, but they had a, there was a scandal, the right

03:30.960 --> 03:31.960
word.

03:31.960 --> 03:32.960
Yeah.

03:32.960 --> 03:33.960
That phishing attack thing, right?

03:33.960 --> 03:37.240
Where they were intercepting or it was like a bogus, some bogus SSL or something.

03:37.240 --> 03:38.240
It fades now.

03:38.240 --> 03:40.280
There was like, they unknowingly were shipping chips.

03:40.280 --> 03:43.640
They claim that had like cyber spying crap on it.

03:43.640 --> 03:45.680
I do remember vaguely now some spying thing.

03:45.680 --> 03:46.680
Right.

03:46.680 --> 03:47.680
Chinese spice.

03:47.680 --> 03:48.680
Shocking.

03:48.680 --> 03:51.440
My problem is, and I say this almost like it's, you know, like I'm, Oh, I'm an old man.

03:51.440 --> 03:54.840
I can't figure it out, but God, there's so many stupid models.

03:54.840 --> 04:00.800
Like I feel like since Lenovo took over, there's several versions of ThinkPads that aren't

04:00.800 --> 04:05.800
like the traditional ThinkPad I think of when I think of an IBM ThinkPad, they're more like

04:05.800 --> 04:08.400
different attempts that they tried and I don't like them as much.

04:08.400 --> 04:11.840
And I don't know enough about the product lines to sort it all out.

04:11.840 --> 04:14.840
So you kind of just took a stab because you mean, did you really know what you were getting

04:14.840 --> 04:15.840
when you picked this thing?

04:15.840 --> 04:16.840
It doesn't sound like it.

04:16.840 --> 04:20.480
So I needed something that could turn into a tablet and do touch.

04:20.480 --> 04:21.900
So I had some limitations, right?

04:21.900 --> 04:24.820
There's the more traditional ThinkPad that doesn't do that.

04:24.820 --> 04:26.120
But no, I had no idea.

04:26.120 --> 04:29.320
I just had the Twitter folks telling me that ThinkPads are amazing.

04:29.320 --> 04:31.640
You know, go ThinkPad if you're going Windows.

04:31.640 --> 04:32.640
Yeah.

04:32.640 --> 04:36.400
But usually that sentence is actually ThinkPads are great for Linux.

04:36.400 --> 04:37.400
But it makes sense.

04:37.400 --> 04:38.400
It makes sense for Windows, too.

04:38.400 --> 04:40.000
I mean, it's just good hardware.

04:40.000 --> 04:41.000
Yeah.

04:41.000 --> 04:42.000
Yeah.

04:42.000 --> 04:43.000
Yeah.

04:43.000 --> 04:45.200
Couple weird things like the function key is where you think the control key should

04:45.200 --> 04:46.200
be.

04:46.200 --> 04:47.200
Yes.

04:47.200 --> 04:48.720
So you're constantly hitting it wrong.

04:48.720 --> 04:50.520
You can swap that in the bios.

04:50.520 --> 04:51.520
You can.

04:51.520 --> 04:52.520
Yeah.

04:52.520 --> 04:55.940
You know, it's funny because I don't have a lot to say on it only because it's doing

04:55.940 --> 04:57.460
the job it's supposed to do.

04:57.460 --> 04:59.080
And I don't have anything to complain about.

04:59.080 --> 05:00.080
Yeah, that's good.

05:00.080 --> 05:02.940
I mean, that's exactly what you want from this type of device.

05:02.940 --> 05:05.440
So does it have enough horsepower for what you're doing?

05:05.440 --> 05:06.440
So far?

05:06.440 --> 05:07.440
Yeah.

05:07.440 --> 05:08.440
I mean, I had to get the model they had in stock.

05:08.440 --> 05:10.360
I probably would have gotten a little more RAM.

05:10.360 --> 05:12.080
I only got 16 gigs.

05:12.080 --> 05:16.520
But to get the presence they discount, I had to go with it had to be a machine they had

05:16.520 --> 05:17.520
ready to ship.

05:17.520 --> 05:22.840
It's interesting, too, because I guess I kind of wondered, coming from the M1 side of things,

05:22.840 --> 05:26.040
if it just would feel too sluggish, too old.

05:26.040 --> 05:29.440
So I guess my expectations are different because it's Windows, right?

05:29.440 --> 05:32.140
No, no, I get you.

05:32.140 --> 05:34.520
It's like you're also you're more used to it, right?

05:34.520 --> 05:37.600
And you haven't experienced Windows on an M1 before.

05:37.600 --> 05:46.000
And so I guess in a sense, you have lowered expectations.

05:46.000 --> 05:47.720
Let's just do an example right now, right?

05:47.720 --> 05:50.240
I just popped open Spotlight instant.

05:50.240 --> 05:54.080
I hit the Windows key on the Lenovo and yeah, there's like a second delay before it brings

05:54.080 --> 05:55.640
up the start menu, right?

05:55.640 --> 05:56.920
But it's a work tool.

05:56.920 --> 05:58.360
It's yeah.

05:58.360 --> 06:03.080
I mean, I go back and forth on this all the time because I want the ultimate performance,

06:03.080 --> 06:05.400
but I also need certain tools to do certain jobs.

06:05.400 --> 06:08.720
I was just wondering because I saw you were tweeting about CAD, too, and I thought, oh,

06:08.720 --> 06:13.080
is that going to be enough to handle a CAD job?

06:13.080 --> 06:14.080
Probably not.

06:14.080 --> 06:16.320
I'm also in the market for a Windows workstation.

06:16.320 --> 06:17.320
Oh, my God.

06:17.320 --> 06:20.480
I mean, people have suggested I violate the Thaleo and just throw Windows on it, but then

06:20.480 --> 06:24.080
I got to set it up again and it's like, oh, that's true.

06:24.080 --> 06:29.240
You know, one way to maybe to do that, because that is a pretty good machine for that thing,

06:29.240 --> 06:31.600
would be maybe just get a new SSD.

06:31.600 --> 06:32.600
Thought about that.

06:32.600 --> 06:33.600
Yeah.

06:33.600 --> 06:34.800
But every time I open it, I break it.

06:34.800 --> 06:38.640
So yeah.

06:38.640 --> 06:42.840
And I guess now this also means you're getting a chance to deep dive back into WSL and all

06:42.840 --> 06:44.360
of that goodness on the Windows side.

06:44.360 --> 06:49.880
I have to say Penguin, the WSL variant that I prefer has come quite a ways.

06:49.880 --> 06:54.200
They fixed my Ruby on Rails problem, granted they had to write a special setup thing to

06:54.200 --> 06:56.780
fix it for for Ruby mine.

06:56.780 --> 07:00.200
You can go back maybe 20 episodes to hear about that.

07:00.200 --> 07:03.960
I mean, Windows 10 is it does the job right.

07:03.960 --> 07:04.960
It's I don't know.

07:04.960 --> 07:05.960
Yeah.

07:05.960 --> 07:09.280
I can't say it's a pleasure to use because things that I think should be really like

07:09.280 --> 07:11.680
not slow.

07:11.680 --> 07:12.680
It kills me.

07:12.680 --> 07:18.680
The start menu is slow to open that like I don't get because spotlight on Mac is fast.

07:18.680 --> 07:22.720
You know, the the dash or whatever they call it on Papa West is super fast.

07:22.720 --> 07:23.720
Right.

07:23.720 --> 07:26.200
But the start menu just seems like laggy as hell.

07:26.200 --> 07:29.360
Got to be that built in dynamic updating stuff that they have.

07:29.360 --> 07:31.800
Yeah, but that seems like a bug, not a feature.

07:31.800 --> 07:32.800
But yeah, cash it.

07:32.800 --> 07:33.800
I'm sure they must.

07:33.800 --> 07:34.800
Right.

07:34.800 --> 07:39.080
But but in other ways, Windows often feels like it's one of the fastest operating systems

07:39.080 --> 07:43.000
at launching actual applications like on the same machine bit for bit.

07:43.000 --> 07:46.600
I swear sometimes Windows starts things twice as fast as other operating systems.

07:46.600 --> 07:47.600
Fair point.

07:47.600 --> 07:53.560
And I will say, since I'm right now developing dotnet software, you can't beat Visual Studio.

07:53.560 --> 07:57.760
Like as soon as I pop up Visual Studio, Windows is like one of the best dev environments I've

07:57.760 --> 07:59.400
had in a long time.

07:59.400 --> 08:02.240
It's anything else I want to do, like email crap.

08:02.240 --> 08:06.920
I had a good win this week because I successfully moved a workflow off of Mac OS.

08:06.920 --> 08:11.120
It was like a thing occasionally we would do where I would have to like update graphics

08:11.120 --> 08:16.040
in a motion template and I managed to render out the things to video that I needed and

08:16.040 --> 08:18.800
then I was able to put it together on Linux for the first time.

08:18.800 --> 08:22.360
So that was really nice because I'm always trying to evaluate how far I can push it,

08:22.360 --> 08:29.440
because in the back of my mind recently, I've been thinking about what if I went all in

08:29.440 --> 08:37.720
on like a Ryzen fast system with a lot of CPU, a lot of GPU, and then I think the other

08:37.720 --> 08:44.280
thing that I've learned is really key is a minimum of 120 hertz monitor.

08:44.280 --> 08:49.920
I have a laptop in that I've been using, the Asus G14, and it has 120 hertz refresh rate

08:49.920 --> 08:54.200
and oh man, everything is smoother.

08:54.200 --> 09:01.640
Moving windows around, turning in games, everything, scrolling, everything is faster and smoother

09:01.640 --> 09:06.280
and I got it without having to switch to an M1 or anything like that and it made me start

09:06.280 --> 09:11.280
thinking because this thing's also a Ryzen based laptop, maybe there's more to this than

09:11.280 --> 09:15.100
I've realized with this Ryzen stuff because I've been on Intel forever and I thought maybe

09:15.100 --> 09:22.280
if I built myself something that had like a minimum of 12 physical cores, minimum 24

09:22.280 --> 09:27.280
gigs of RAM, maybe 32 gigs of RAM, a modern graphics card if I could ever get my hands

09:27.280 --> 09:31.600
on it, and 120 hertz display.

09:31.600 --> 09:35.800
Well of course, I ended up over at the Thaleo configuration screen.

09:35.800 --> 09:36.800
Naturally.

09:36.800 --> 09:42.120
Specking out of Thaleo and it's, I don't want to say it's super expensive because it's cheaper

09:42.120 --> 09:48.000
than like a Mac Pro, but when you go with all these components, the price does get up

09:48.000 --> 09:49.560
there so fast.

09:49.560 --> 09:53.640
So I've been thinking about maybe I could do it in stages, like start with the monitor,

09:53.640 --> 09:56.720
replace that, that should make even my current system feel better.

09:56.720 --> 09:59.320
It's been an interesting discovery though, just that.

09:59.320 --> 10:02.920
That is a big deal that I didn't really appreciate because I hadn't tried it before.

10:02.920 --> 10:03.920
Makes everything better.

10:03.920 --> 10:04.920
It's all better.

10:04.920 --> 10:06.960
You know what else makes everything better?

10:06.960 --> 10:10.760
A quarter radio 400 poster for a limited time.

10:10.760 --> 10:11.760
Buying one right now.

10:11.760 --> 10:14.640
Yeah, this one hasn't been selling like gangbusters.

10:14.640 --> 10:19.600
We definitely sold a few, but I don't know, it's a great poster, but you gotta click the

10:19.600 --> 10:22.880
link in the show notes to get it because we have it over at teespring.com.

10:22.880 --> 10:30.040
It's a Coda Radio 400 word cloud poster to celebrate 400 episodes of the Coda Radio program,

10:30.040 --> 10:35.280
and every title we've ever had for all 400 episodes is in that word cloud.

10:35.280 --> 10:40.200
Plus it has that Sharp, the Sharp new logo that we have that's way better than the logo

10:40.200 --> 10:45.840
we had when the show started, so that's nice to get that updated too.

10:45.840 --> 10:52.680
But maybe, maybe that hasn't sold very many because, rightfully so, people are saving

10:52.680 --> 10:56.120
up for the coder.

10:56.120 --> 10:57.120
The coder.shop.

10:57.120 --> 10:59.720
Hang on, I'm taking a swig of my drink here, hang on.

10:59.720 --> 11:06.100
Like coder.shop, it was like, I can't remember, but it got at least two grand, maybe four

11:06.100 --> 11:12.320
grand for coder.shop, but the coder.shop was on sale for like three bucks.

11:12.320 --> 11:14.980
So anyways, I was like, that's wild.

11:14.980 --> 11:21.560
I actually think, depending on how the robe thing goes, I may get a lot more into swag.

11:21.560 --> 11:27.500
I really like making something and then selling it to the audience, and I think maybe we found

11:27.500 --> 11:28.760
a cool company to work with.

11:28.760 --> 11:29.760
We'll see, we'll see.

11:29.760 --> 11:31.100
This is very much a learning process.

11:31.100 --> 11:35.740
I could really, really get screwed on the international shipping, so I've recently adjusted

11:35.740 --> 11:36.880
the price a little bit.

11:36.880 --> 11:40.680
I'm trying to get quotes for various areas, but they won't give me any estimate unless

11:40.680 --> 11:44.740
I have addresses, so thankfully a couple of audience members have graciously shared their

11:44.740 --> 11:47.880
addresses with me so I can get some international estimates.

11:47.880 --> 11:50.480
But we have rolled out the robe.

11:50.480 --> 11:52.000
It's called the Coder.

11:52.000 --> 11:53.000
It's beautiful.

11:53.000 --> 11:59.320
It's all black with an all-white coder radio logo over the left chest, and it's 65 bucks.

11:59.320 --> 12:00.320
It's a great price.

12:00.320 --> 12:03.280
Then there is like five for domestic shipping.

12:03.280 --> 12:08.440
We'll check the site for international and making adjustments, thecoder.shop.

12:08.440 --> 12:11.880
If there's something that comes up with the international shipping, though, we will totally

12:11.880 --> 12:14.560
communicate it with you, so don't worry about that.

12:14.560 --> 12:19.600
We will let you know for sure, but we will target the second week of March for shipping,

12:19.600 --> 12:22.860
so you've really got to get these orders in soon.

12:22.860 --> 12:26.000
The end of the month, we're going to really, February 28th, we're really going to close

12:26.000 --> 12:29.880
it down because we've got to give the company time to embroider them.

12:29.880 --> 12:32.480
They do that here in the States, and then they get shipped out.

12:32.480 --> 12:37.200
So it's thecoder.shop, and yes, it is a Coder radio robe.

12:37.200 --> 12:42.320
I'm getting one for me, I'm getting one for the kid, getting one for Mike, and I'm going

12:42.320 --> 12:43.320
to get one for Wes, too.

12:43.320 --> 12:47.000
You know what I just noticed about the robes that I never noticed before?

12:47.000 --> 12:48.000
What's that?

12:48.000 --> 12:52.000
They have big pockets, so you can have like a Western Digital or whatever Seagate drive,

12:52.000 --> 12:54.640
just with your like alternative OS, you know?

12:54.640 --> 12:55.640
Yeah, totally.

12:55.640 --> 12:59.080
You could have, or maybe a bottle of beer or something, I mean, they'll fit a bottle

12:59.080 --> 13:00.080
in there.

13:00.080 --> 13:02.760
You could have a bottle of gin maybe, like a little...

13:02.760 --> 13:05.080
Yeah, totally would, man.

13:05.080 --> 13:06.800
I mean, and why not, right?

13:06.800 --> 13:10.400
Save some time, why carry stuff, it just makes you more productive.

13:10.400 --> 13:13.520
Be productive and be comfortable, thecoder.shop.

13:13.520 --> 13:17.920
Pretty excited about that, and what I learned from that, well, you'll see where that goes.

13:17.920 --> 13:23.000
Maybe JB will have some reoccurring swag, well, not reoccurring, but I'm going to go

13:23.000 --> 13:27.640
for nice, cool items, like stuff that you've hopefully not seen a lot of in other places

13:27.640 --> 13:28.680
whenever possible.

13:28.680 --> 13:30.000
That's why we wanted to start with the robes.

13:30.000 --> 13:34.600
Check it out, thecoder.shop.

13:34.600 --> 13:41.040
Head over to linode.com slash coder and get a $100, 60-day credit for a new account, and

13:41.040 --> 13:42.800
then you can really check out Linode.

13:42.800 --> 13:47.240
Now, I've mentioned them, we've talked about how we use them here on the show a lot, but

13:47.240 --> 13:51.040
something that I think you could look at if you are toying around with setting up a new

13:51.040 --> 13:52.560
WordPress site.

13:52.560 --> 13:57.200
If you're like me, there's a lot of advantages to WordPress, but you have a little bit of

13:57.200 --> 14:00.640
concern potentially about the performance.

14:00.640 --> 14:04.800
Well, Linode has something really cool, and I experimented with a lot of different stacks,

14:04.800 --> 14:09.480
and I hands down found this to be the absolute fastest way to run a WordPress site because

14:09.480 --> 14:14.120
it integrates the web server and the cache into one.

14:14.120 --> 14:18.800
It's the open Lightspeed WordPress one-click deployment on Linode.

14:18.800 --> 14:21.640
It gives you access to the open Lightspeed web server.

14:21.640 --> 14:26.680
Of course, it has PHP and MySQL server in WordPress, and it works with its own cache

14:26.680 --> 14:31.280
to make WordPress crazy fast, and it gives you a bunch of good analytics and all of that,

14:31.280 --> 14:34.080
and you can do one-click deployment over on Linode.

14:34.080 --> 14:37.520
They give you 11 different data centers to deploy from, so you can get it right nice

14:37.520 --> 14:40.680
and close to your customers or clients or to yourself.

14:40.680 --> 14:45.120
And of course, they've got block storage, so you could conceivably then hook up the

14:45.120 --> 14:50.560
back end of that WordPress using block storage and just get things really flying.

14:50.560 --> 14:52.520
There's a lot of cool stuff you can do at Linode.

14:52.520 --> 14:57.900
They give you this beautiful and easy-to-use cloud management dashboard that lets you manage

14:57.900 --> 14:59.720
all of this stuff.

14:59.720 --> 15:03.720
But if you want to just get behind the scenes and tweak with stuff a little bit, they totally

15:03.720 --> 15:07.480
enable that, and they pretty much provide you the documentation.

15:07.480 --> 15:11.680
They started in 2003 as one of the first companies in cloud computing.

15:11.680 --> 15:15.120
They didn't just start doing a million different things.

15:15.120 --> 15:19.480
Linode focused in on several things that they could do really well, and that's what they've

15:19.480 --> 15:20.480
done.

15:20.480 --> 15:25.560
They have a virtualized Linux that's really fast, super reliable, and has great networking

15:25.560 --> 15:27.760
and native SSDs.

15:27.760 --> 15:29.280
That's their bag, right?

15:29.280 --> 15:34.240
They've been doing this since before anybody, AWS, Google, other enterprise providers, they've

15:34.240 --> 15:38.920
been doing this for a long time, and they really honed what they do, and they're independently

15:38.920 --> 15:43.280
owned still, which I think is fantastic and gives me a lot of peace of mind.

15:43.280 --> 15:47.680
And then they combine all of that with the best support.

15:47.680 --> 15:52.200
If you've got a huge account or a small account, just the best support, and you can get a little

15:52.200 --> 15:56.640
glimpse of what I'm talking about by signing up today at linode.com slash coder.

15:56.640 --> 16:02.000
Get a $100 60-day credit on your new Linode account, and you support the show.

16:02.000 --> 16:06.920
Unlike entry-level hosting providers that try to lock you in, they're just doing a really

16:06.920 --> 16:11.340
great job of standing up Linux servers and either making it as easy as you'd like or

16:11.340 --> 16:12.820
to go as deep as you'd like.

16:12.820 --> 16:18.680
So get started right now, linode.com slash coder.

16:18.680 --> 16:20.440
What do you think about some feedback?

16:20.440 --> 16:24.160
Now that we've gotten all that out of the way.

16:24.160 --> 16:27.240
I just hope they don't ask for more robes.

16:27.240 --> 16:29.600
I mean, we'll see.

16:29.600 --> 16:34.240
Hopefully this robe thing doesn't put me in the streets.

16:34.240 --> 16:37.160
I mean, the robes are black, but it could put you in the red, right?

16:37.160 --> 16:38.160
Right, exactly.

16:38.160 --> 16:42.940
So Gabriel wrote in and he says, I'm not really quite sure what your problem is. The leadership

16:42.940 --> 16:46.360
for the Rust Foundation hasn't really changed.

16:46.360 --> 16:49.800
The project's been following that model for years now with relatively small changes and

16:49.800 --> 16:51.160
it seems to have worked.

16:51.160 --> 16:52.440
Why are you worried it wouldn't?

16:52.440 --> 16:57.460
So last week we mentioned the Rust Foundation and I said, I'm just, I'm a little concerned

16:57.460 --> 17:01.880
that the way they have this is about, you know, 5,000 chefs in the kitchen.

17:01.880 --> 17:02.880
You remember that?

17:02.880 --> 17:03.880
You remember that conversation?

17:03.880 --> 17:05.560
I do remember it.

17:05.560 --> 17:06.800
Here's my thought.

17:06.800 --> 17:11.560
Just because it has worked and it does work today, I don't think that necessarily demonstrates

17:11.560 --> 17:13.320
that it's going to scale much larger.

17:13.320 --> 17:14.820
We shall see.

17:14.820 --> 17:19.120
That's what was my only pause is like, how do you take something where it's essentially

17:19.120 --> 17:24.480
it's everyone gets a vote, which is good in a lot of ways, but without a structured system

17:24.480 --> 17:30.560
to it, it really seems like it could, it could have the Debian effect times 10.

17:30.560 --> 17:32.800
But you know, maybe not, maybe not.

17:32.800 --> 17:34.640
And I'm not going to wish the worst.

17:34.640 --> 17:37.040
I actually hope it all works great and I'd love to see it work out.

17:37.040 --> 17:41.640
I think it'd be a fantastic way for a project like Rust to be run.

17:41.640 --> 17:42.640
Moving on.

17:42.640 --> 17:47.480
I also was talking last week about RSS, trying to write a little bit of a love note to what

17:47.480 --> 17:50.000
I think really makes the web great.

17:50.000 --> 17:54.880
Chuck writes and he says, you know, RSS is the best, but not every site supports it.

17:54.880 --> 17:58.600
So I rolled my own.

17:58.600 --> 18:04.680
I use wget plus bash to implement an RSS like feed on my digital ocean droplet.

18:04.680 --> 18:08.040
It's the title of the article itself, plus a button to go get the article.

18:08.040 --> 18:10.920
No pictures, no tracking, just the feeds, ma'am.

18:10.920 --> 18:14.820
It updates at the top of the hour, so I'm never tempted to check over and over again

18:14.820 --> 18:15.820
at nauseam.

18:15.820 --> 18:17.380
Oh, I like that too, Chuck.

18:17.380 --> 18:18.800
That's a good way to go.

18:18.800 --> 18:21.160
You avoid the scroll or refresh of doom that way.

18:21.160 --> 18:24.320
You know, if you've read through it, you got to wait a little bit.

18:24.320 --> 18:25.320
I like that.

18:25.320 --> 18:26.480
I like rolling your own solution.

18:26.480 --> 18:30.840
I think that's pretty great if you have any RSS tricks out there, do let us know.

18:30.840 --> 18:31.840
I love Chuck.

18:31.840 --> 18:32.900
I love talking about that stuff.

18:32.900 --> 18:37.040
But now we have a problem to solve and this will be the meat of our feedback this week.

18:37.040 --> 18:40.040
Linuxbytes writes in, hey guys, maybe you can help me.

18:40.040 --> 18:43.880
I'm a Linux sysadmin by day and a coder at night.

18:43.880 --> 18:48.440
I've been working with Linux for some years and working in a data center as a Linux sysadmin.

18:48.440 --> 18:54.260
I'm very grateful to have a good paying job and I don't want to be ungrateful, but I do

18:54.260 --> 19:02.240
love to code and I would like to move over into more of a programming role full time.

19:02.240 --> 19:06.200
Working here is good where he does work, but it takes just a bit of my time away from what

19:06.200 --> 19:08.800
I really want to do, which is programming.

19:08.800 --> 19:10.680
But I am concerned about a couple of things.

19:10.680 --> 19:14.800
How can I make a move without taking a massive pay cut and benefits?

19:14.800 --> 19:19.160
Plus I'm worried that my experience isn't really that much on paper.

19:19.160 --> 19:22.320
I have experience, but mostly it's in the sysadmin area.

19:22.320 --> 19:28.040
If you look at a resume, he's wondering if maybe he should first try to focus on a specific

19:28.040 --> 19:29.360
skill or area.

19:29.360 --> 19:34.440
He says, I use Python today, a little bit of JavaScript and Bash and Git, of course.

19:34.440 --> 19:38.460
I've been using Python for a really long time, basically before it was even a thing.

19:38.460 --> 19:42.200
And I was thinking though, if I wanted to get paid well, I should move more into back

19:42.200 --> 19:47.220
end stuff like working with C for the kernel or perhaps a dynamic language.

19:47.220 --> 19:50.120
But I don't want to invest my time in the wrong spot.

19:50.120 --> 19:52.320
I want to make a wise transition.

19:52.320 --> 19:56.340
My job is not a face-to-face style job, and I like that.

19:56.340 --> 20:00.760
It's mostly nice for my mental well-being, and I work in an environment with email teams

20:00.760 --> 20:02.400
and calls just fine.

20:02.400 --> 20:04.060
I'm not sure if I'm over my head.

20:04.060 --> 20:06.680
Maybe I'm being silly here, the grass is greener sort of thing.

20:06.680 --> 20:08.120
Any feedback would be helpful.

20:08.120 --> 20:09.120
Thanks again, Linuxbytes.

20:09.120 --> 20:13.120
Okay, that's a lot to unpack there.

20:13.120 --> 20:16.680
Starting with, I guess, why not focus on Python?

20:16.680 --> 20:19.600
I mean, not to make this the Python show, but does that stand out to you?

20:19.600 --> 20:24.000
Yeah, it's a little weird because he says back end, but Python primarily is used as

20:24.000 --> 20:25.000
a back end language.

20:25.000 --> 20:26.000
Right.

20:26.000 --> 20:31.000
When I say primarily before people jump down my throat doing embedded, I would care to

20:31.000 --> 20:36.680
wager the majority of folks doing Python are probably doing like Flask, Django, fast API,

20:36.680 --> 20:39.640
stuff like that, like back end services, right?

20:39.640 --> 20:43.080
I think he means something different by back end though, Chris.

20:43.080 --> 20:44.640
I think he means a lower level.

20:44.640 --> 20:47.400
Yeah, like kernel stuff and driver stuff.

20:47.400 --> 20:48.400
Right.

20:48.400 --> 20:50.480
I mean, the answer to this question is kind of lame.

20:50.480 --> 20:53.840
There's no reason you can't do Python and have a good living.

20:53.840 --> 20:54.840
Right.

20:54.840 --> 20:57.160
Unless the reason is you don't like doing Python, right?

20:57.160 --> 20:58.160
Yeah.

20:58.160 --> 21:02.400
If you enjoy working on lower level code, more down to the hardware, memory management,

21:02.400 --> 21:05.320
stuff like that, then obviously do what you want.

21:05.320 --> 21:07.560
I mean, look, I do Python, I do Ruby.

21:07.560 --> 21:12.880
Right now I'm doing a bunch of.NET where I'm about to be shortly because I don't know,

21:12.880 --> 21:16.560
I'm a soldier of fortune here, right?

21:16.560 --> 21:18.560
I don't mean to diminish the question at all.

21:18.560 --> 21:21.760
And I hope the writer doesn't take it this way, but you're going to change technologies

21:21.760 --> 21:27.400
a lot in your career, especially if you're like a freelancer or like in the small consulting

21:27.400 --> 21:28.400
business.

21:28.400 --> 21:29.400
Yeah.

21:29.400 --> 21:30.400
I think he's in like a resume mindset.

21:30.400 --> 21:31.400
Okay.

21:31.400 --> 21:32.400
You know what I mean?

21:32.400 --> 21:33.560
Like, how do I market myself?

21:33.560 --> 21:35.400
Well, then Python is great, right?

21:35.400 --> 21:38.500
Because there's so many opportunities right now in Python.

21:38.500 --> 21:42.400
They may not be necessarily the highest paying opportunities because it is a fairly common

21:42.400 --> 21:43.400
language.

21:43.400 --> 21:47.360
But if you're just looking that you need to get some work, there's absolutely no reason

21:47.360 --> 21:49.280
Python is not a good choice.

21:49.280 --> 21:52.600
If you just think about all the uses of Python, right?

21:52.600 --> 21:57.260
You have TensorFlow, you have Flask, you have Django, you have all the embedded stuff.

21:57.260 --> 21:59.200
You have all the crazy data science stuff.

21:59.200 --> 22:00.760
By that, I don't mean TensorFlow again.

22:00.760 --> 22:04.580
I mean like the stuff that like actual like research universities are using.

22:04.580 --> 22:05.580
Is it Jupyter Notebooks?

22:05.580 --> 22:06.580
Yeah.

22:06.580 --> 22:07.960
All that kind of stuff.

22:07.960 --> 22:11.720
I guess what your take is, Chris, because I feel like maybe he doesn't like Python and

22:11.720 --> 22:12.960
that's kind of the issue.

22:12.960 --> 22:16.760
I wonder though, because, you know, he says he's been following it and dabbling with it

22:16.760 --> 22:19.720
since really it was even, you know, just a glimmer.

22:19.720 --> 22:23.000
But I kind of wonder if he isn't isolating these too much.

22:23.000 --> 22:24.640
Fat Cat in our chat room puts it well.

22:24.640 --> 22:29.300
He says, you could kind of bring it together, bring more scripting into your sysadmin life

22:29.300 --> 22:34.880
so you can then bring programming into your career and maybe move into a DevOps role because

22:34.880 --> 22:40.440
there are absolutely roles out there where you need to have a good skill set in both

22:40.440 --> 22:41.920
of these areas.

22:41.920 --> 22:43.320
That's becoming super common now.

22:43.320 --> 22:44.320
That's great advice.

22:44.320 --> 22:45.320
Right.

22:45.320 --> 22:48.840
And again, for that scripting kind of stuff, Python, it's actually a fabulous choice.

22:48.840 --> 22:52.240
Yeah, I could totes see in that work for him.

22:52.240 --> 22:56.680
Also, I don't mean to like to like talk down when I say, you know, why not do both?

22:56.680 --> 23:01.160
Because and make it sound simple, because I do totally get where you're at.

23:01.160 --> 23:04.920
And I know that you're trying to think about it from a marketable kind of sell yourself

23:04.920 --> 23:07.440
to a to a higher standpoint.

23:07.440 --> 23:11.000
And when you say, well, bring them both together and do a little programming and sysadmin,

23:11.000 --> 23:12.000
it's so nebulous.

23:12.000 --> 23:15.200
And you're like, OK, well, how do I refine that into a message?

23:15.200 --> 23:17.280
I think you're just not at that stage yet.

23:17.280 --> 23:18.480
You're just not quite there yet.

23:18.480 --> 23:22.160
And the good news is, is it doesn't sound like you are in any kind of urgency.

23:22.160 --> 23:24.160
You know, you're not out of work.

23:24.160 --> 23:28.600
You have a job that's paying you sufficiently and it has benefits that cover you sufficiently.

23:28.600 --> 23:32.060
So you actually have a little bit of time to play with here.

23:32.060 --> 23:37.520
And so you may just not have it quite refined yet, but I think you'll get there if you if

23:37.520 --> 23:38.760
you just sort of embrace it.

23:38.760 --> 23:43.560
And our advice is, is, you know, become one with the snake.

23:43.560 --> 23:44.560
Yeah.

23:44.560 --> 23:50.000
Or if you really want to, you know, be pure in heart and soul, objective C is still around.

23:50.000 --> 23:51.000
There it is.

23:51.000 --> 23:52.000
There it is.

23:52.000 --> 23:55.640
Every episode, you get one.

23:55.640 --> 24:00.000
Before we move on, because, you know, we've gotten so many emails since the show's been

24:00.000 --> 24:02.200
back about keyboards.

24:02.200 --> 24:09.000
Did you catch that System76 updated their GitHub repo and now we have way more details

24:09.000 --> 24:11.320
on their new keyboard that they're working on?

24:11.320 --> 24:12.320
I did catch it.

24:12.320 --> 24:14.800
I thought I was dreaming, but I did catch it.

24:14.800 --> 24:18.620
No surprise they're going to be building these in the US in Denver.

24:18.620 --> 24:22.580
They're calling it the System76 launch configurable keyboard.

24:22.580 --> 24:29.520
It says it'll have an open source design down to the PCB, open source firmware, milled aluminum

24:29.520 --> 24:35.560
chassis and that it will support the Linux vendor firmware service, which is great for

24:35.560 --> 24:37.140
Linux users.

24:37.140 --> 24:38.480
People love that kind of stuff.

24:38.480 --> 24:43.960
It's going to have USB-C and USB-A. The key switches can be swapped with any MX compatible

24:43.960 --> 24:46.000
footprint.

24:46.000 --> 24:49.000
I think this is brilliant from their standpoint.

24:49.000 --> 24:52.600
There are people who are running Windows that will want to buy this thing.

24:52.600 --> 24:56.240
It's built in the US that checks a box.

24:56.240 --> 24:57.240
All of that.

24:57.240 --> 25:01.080
Of course, it'll come down to the feel, but I'm kind of excited about this.

25:01.080 --> 25:08.360
I think just based on the amount of conversation that we got out of mechanical keyboards, it's

25:08.360 --> 25:10.320
clear this is a market.

25:10.320 --> 25:12.640
This is a market here.

25:12.640 --> 25:21.040
It's obviously also a pretty good first step into building a laptop, master the keyboard

25:21.040 --> 25:23.120
manufacturing process first.

25:23.120 --> 25:25.920
I'm definitely going to pick one of these up.

25:25.920 --> 25:27.720
That's just basically it, isn't it?

25:27.720 --> 25:28.720
That's basically it.

25:28.720 --> 25:29.720
I want to try it out.

25:29.720 --> 25:33.200
I don't want to say too much until I get my hands on it.

25:33.200 --> 25:35.220
It could be uncomfortable to type on.

25:35.220 --> 25:39.900
It's unlikely, but it could theoretically happen.

25:39.900 --> 25:41.580
I agree with you.

25:41.580 --> 25:43.880
It is exciting to see that in the works.

25:43.880 --> 25:45.060
Yeah, it looks impressive.

25:45.060 --> 25:49.380
I think the challenge is, do they gear it too much towards pop OS or do they just make

25:49.380 --> 25:54.980
a really good mechanical keyboard for all operating systems?

25:54.980 --> 25:59.340
If they get it right, the sweet spot will be totally works with any Linux or probably

25:59.340 --> 26:03.400
even Windows, but if you do use it with pop OS-

26:03.400 --> 26:05.320
You get a couple of sweets.

26:05.320 --> 26:07.280
And it could be a gateway drug to pop OS.

26:07.280 --> 26:08.420
Oh, totally.

26:08.420 --> 26:10.960
Or just system 76 in general.

26:10.960 --> 26:12.520
Even if you just buy their hardware.

26:12.520 --> 26:13.840
So that's going to be neat.

26:13.840 --> 26:18.520
Since the show rebooted, I have a total new appreciation for keyboards.

26:18.520 --> 26:23.920
I kind of feel a little bad for not taking it more seriously sooner because my RSI is

26:23.920 --> 26:25.280
such a huge deal for me.

26:25.280 --> 26:30.420
I'm constantly battling that, but also it's something I'm touching and interfacing with

26:30.420 --> 26:31.520
all day long.

26:31.520 --> 26:32.920
So why not make it nice?

26:32.920 --> 26:34.280
It just didn't make any sense.

26:34.280 --> 26:36.200
So I'm excited to see them get into this.

26:36.200 --> 26:40.460
If you would like to email the show, ask us a question, follow up on anything that we

26:40.460 --> 26:43.940
talk about in this show, we would really like to hear from you.

26:43.940 --> 26:48.800
It's a big part of what we do and I know it takes a minute to sit down and actually go

26:48.800 --> 26:50.140
do that and write it out.

26:50.140 --> 26:54.920
So it's a big ask, but we really appreciate it and it makes the show a lot better and

26:54.920 --> 26:57.080
it keeps us feeling like we're connected to you.

26:57.080 --> 27:01.900
So go to coder.show slash contact for that and let us know what you think about anything

27:01.900 --> 27:05.960
that we've talked about here on the Coder Radio podcast because we like hearing from

27:05.960 --> 27:07.860
you and we are about to get into the hoopla.

27:07.860 --> 27:12.840
So there will probably be plenty of things for you to respond to.

27:12.840 --> 27:14.680
Datadog.com slash Coder Radio.

27:14.680 --> 27:17.080
This here episode is sponsored by Datadog.

27:17.080 --> 27:22.060
They are the unified monitoring and analytics platform for comprehensive visibility into

27:22.060 --> 27:24.320
your cloud, into your on-premises setup.

27:24.320 --> 27:29.440
If you have a hybrid setup, multi-cloud environment, they can monitor all of it.

27:29.440 --> 27:34.020
And when I say the entire stack, I'm talking about key Linux performance metrics or whatever

27:34.020 --> 27:35.800
your server OS might be.

27:35.800 --> 27:40.360
They have tons of integrations into applications themselves and of course they get insights

27:40.360 --> 27:41.680
into the container.

27:41.680 --> 27:45.480
They have an agent you can install that was recently rewritten in Go that's super simple

27:45.480 --> 27:48.720
to deploy and then you get these dashboards.

27:48.720 --> 27:52.400
You got to check out these dashboards, datadog.com slash Coder Radio.

27:52.400 --> 27:56.340
And if you set up even one dashboard in part of the trial, going to that URL gets you a

27:56.340 --> 27:58.320
shirt after you set up that dashboard.

27:58.320 --> 28:04.640
But I'm talking beautiful visibility and visualizations that help you communicate to your development

28:04.640 --> 28:09.420
team or to your sys admins or to your stakeholders, people that need to make decisions.

28:09.420 --> 28:14.420
This is the kind of data you get from this is decision-making data.

28:14.420 --> 28:18.380
It's the ability to quickly analyze performance of all of your servers and applications in

28:18.380 --> 28:23.040
real time and then build a dashboard where you can get a unified view of say metrics

28:23.040 --> 28:27.740
from this applications or traces from these logs all in one place.

28:27.740 --> 28:31.480
And then like I said, with those integrations, you can pull in a lot of different things

28:31.480 --> 28:35.580
that you would probably not normally even consider getting insights into that can give

28:35.580 --> 28:37.560
you a more complete picture.

28:37.560 --> 28:42.400
Get full stack visibility and get an idea of the health and performance of your entire

28:42.400 --> 28:43.400
infrastructure.

28:43.400 --> 28:48.760
So start your free Datadog trial today by going to datadog.com slash Coder Radio.

28:48.760 --> 28:53.460
That lets them know you're here, supports the show, keeps us going and also means if

28:53.460 --> 28:57.320
you set up a one dashboard after you go to datadog.com slash Coder Radio, you get that

28:57.320 --> 29:03.160
free t-shirt datadog.com slash Coder Radio.

29:03.160 --> 29:07.560
There is some things I want to talk to you today about, but it feels like maybe I'll

29:07.560 --> 29:11.200
give an honorable mention to the Python Software Foundations News.

29:11.200 --> 29:16.960
They just got a big check from your buddies over at Google and they're going to use that

29:16.960 --> 29:21.320
to pay for a practically full time developer.

29:21.320 --> 29:27.160
In addition, they're going to use that to develop malware detection for PyPL, which

29:27.160 --> 29:32.040
I actually don't know what that is, and do dynamic analysis of infrastructure based on

29:32.040 --> 29:34.440
this money that Google's cutting them.

29:34.440 --> 29:35.440
Good.

29:35.440 --> 29:38.040
I mean, that all sounds great.

29:38.040 --> 29:39.040
Yeah.

29:39.040 --> 29:40.040
Yeah.

29:40.040 --> 29:42.320
It's always good when people get on the Google T, right?

29:42.320 --> 29:44.760
I mean, it worked out really good for Mozilla.

29:44.760 --> 29:46.680
Oh, wow.

29:46.680 --> 29:48.560
I really thought you wouldn't go there.

29:48.560 --> 29:49.560
I'm sure it's good.

29:49.560 --> 29:50.560
No, it's good.

29:50.560 --> 29:54.640
I mean, it's good until, you know, two and a half to three to four years.

29:54.640 --> 29:55.640
Yes.

29:55.640 --> 29:56.640
I feel like I have to say it's good.

29:56.640 --> 30:00.040
Otherwise, I become every time something like this happens, I'm bad take guy and I don't

30:00.040 --> 30:04.760
want that to be my thing on the show, but I think I'm getting real cynical about this

30:04.760 --> 30:05.760
stuff.

30:05.760 --> 30:10.400
I mean, when I see a big check like this, what I see is influence purchasing, and I

30:10.400 --> 30:13.240
know I shouldn't, but...

30:13.240 --> 30:14.240
That's what I see.

30:14.240 --> 30:15.240
Okay.

30:15.240 --> 30:18.040
That's why I'm keeping my mouth a little shut.

30:18.040 --> 30:22.280
But then at the same time, it's like, you know, kind of necessary.

30:22.280 --> 30:24.960
Like, somebody needs to pay for this work.

30:24.960 --> 30:25.960
Developers got to eat too.

30:25.960 --> 30:26.960
Yeah.

30:26.960 --> 30:29.320
I mean, Google definitely has a big Python investment, right?

30:29.320 --> 30:34.160
We used to make fun that their Google support was the Python script that basically was a

30:34.160 --> 30:38.640
big if-else tree that at the end said, go F off, right?

30:38.640 --> 30:39.640
Like, so...

30:39.640 --> 30:40.640
Yeah.

30:40.640 --> 30:44.940
They write on their post that they not only use it internally for their own development,

30:44.940 --> 30:49.600
but they say it's a crucial part of products that they offer to Google customers.

30:49.600 --> 30:52.480
And so that's one of the reasons Google is stepping up.

30:52.480 --> 30:53.480
You know what?

30:53.480 --> 30:56.720
If you got a lot of money and you are dependent on this stuff, that's probably exactly what

30:56.720 --> 30:58.480
you should be spending your money on.

30:58.480 --> 30:59.780
So I shouldn't criticize.

30:59.780 --> 31:03.720
It's just that cynical nature that I just can't help these days.

31:03.720 --> 31:06.400
That's what happens when you reach 400 episodes, Mike.

31:06.400 --> 31:10.040
Yeah, you and I are jaded old men who are like, you know, we're the guys at the end

31:10.040 --> 31:12.480
of the bar just bitching and moaning about everything, right?

31:12.480 --> 31:13.480
Right.

31:13.480 --> 31:14.480
Well, okay.

31:14.480 --> 31:16.680
So while we're talking about Google, there is another bit of hoopla that I thought was

31:16.680 --> 31:18.960
sort of embarrassing for them.

31:18.960 --> 31:21.760
They have this problem.

31:21.760 --> 31:26.040
They really have been tiptoeing around trying to punt and kick the can for as long as possible.

31:26.040 --> 31:30.600
That is, Apple has implemented like these nutrition labels for privacy in the iOS app

31:30.600 --> 31:31.960
store.

31:31.960 --> 31:35.120
Nutrition labels are screw you, Google and Facebook labels, man.

31:35.120 --> 31:36.120
Right.

31:36.120 --> 31:39.080
And so Facebook's approach was like, oh, oh, well, we're just going to have a horrible

31:39.080 --> 31:41.240
report and we're just going to push forward.

31:41.240 --> 31:42.640
Did you miss the news today?

31:42.640 --> 31:43.640
What?

31:43.640 --> 31:46.680
Zuck and Tim Cook had a little sit down and it did not go very well.

31:46.680 --> 31:47.960
I did not see this.

31:47.960 --> 31:48.960
Oh man.

31:48.960 --> 31:53.560
Apparently leaked reporting says Zuck came out of it saying we have to inflict a maximum

31:53.560 --> 31:54.720
pain on Apple.

31:54.720 --> 31:56.120
I did see that headline though.

31:56.120 --> 31:57.120
I just didn't read the story.

31:57.120 --> 31:58.120
Oh, interesting.

31:58.120 --> 31:59.120
Yeah.

31:59.120 --> 32:06.080
So basically Tim Cook just said, no, no, like we're not going to change anything, man.

32:06.080 --> 32:09.960
So Google has been kicking this can because they didn't want their apps to get labeled

32:09.960 --> 32:12.040
as privacy.

32:12.040 --> 32:16.600
And because I think it comes down to even some of some of what the SDKs might do for

32:16.600 --> 32:22.040
analytics are considered invasive by Apple, probably rightfully so.

32:22.040 --> 32:23.040
What's Google doing?

32:23.040 --> 32:25.300
They're making money off watching your behavior and monitoring your data.

32:25.300 --> 32:31.560
So they've been kicking the can so long that apparently built into the apps was a warning

32:31.560 --> 32:32.860
about it being out of date.

32:32.860 --> 32:38.720
And so people on iOS that would say launch the Gmail app started getting a error in the

32:38.720 --> 32:41.520
application that said this app is out of date.

32:41.520 --> 32:47.440
It goes on to say you should update this app, although of course you couldn't because Google

32:47.440 --> 32:49.840
hadn't done any updates.

32:49.840 --> 32:53.800
Then it says the version you're using doesn't include the latest security features to keep

32:53.800 --> 32:59.480
you protected, only continue if you understand the risk that is at the top of the Gmail app

32:59.480 --> 33:00.480
when you launch it.

33:00.480 --> 33:04.880
I get the log in page and it's just it's it's hilarious.

33:04.880 --> 33:09.320
And Google had to do a server side tweak to make this thing stop showing up to users.

33:09.320 --> 33:10.320
Yeah.

33:10.320 --> 33:16.660
Today they've begun trickle updating apps into the iOS app store, starting with the

33:16.660 --> 33:22.760
YouTube app and music, TV and studio, I think are also getting updated.

33:22.760 --> 33:26.000
Well, probably even more by the time this episode goes out.

33:26.000 --> 33:31.920
But this really seems to have screwed up their game.

33:31.920 --> 33:32.920
I don't know.

33:32.920 --> 33:36.200
I guess when these stupid nutrition labels were announced, I just went, OK, yeah, I mean,

33:36.200 --> 33:41.220
it's a nicer way to visualize the information, but it has clearly messed with Zuck and Google's

33:41.220 --> 33:42.220
game here.

33:42.220 --> 33:43.720
Well, I mean, you know, I'm going to push back a little bit.

33:43.720 --> 33:44.720
I don't think they're stupid.

33:44.720 --> 33:45.720
Right.

33:45.720 --> 33:48.800
I think to people like us and listeners of the show, they're obviously stupid because

33:48.800 --> 33:50.620
we knew what was going on.

33:50.620 --> 33:55.440
But I'm telling you, like if my mom ever updates the apps on her iPhone, oh, you mean the labels

33:55.440 --> 33:56.440
themselves?

33:56.440 --> 33:57.440
Yeah.

33:57.440 --> 33:58.440
I think she would crap her pants.

33:58.440 --> 33:59.440
Right.

33:59.440 --> 34:03.480
Like if it popped up and said, you know, I'm tracking your location, the other websites

34:03.480 --> 34:10.120
you visit, your shopping preferences, every song you listen to, I might track you even

34:10.120 --> 34:12.380
through private browsing mode.

34:12.380 --> 34:16.600
And for our younger listeners, particularly teenage boys, private browsing mode does not

34:16.600 --> 34:19.320
do what you think it does.

34:19.320 --> 34:20.320
Be careful.

34:20.320 --> 34:21.320
Yeah.

34:21.320 --> 34:22.320
You just shouldn't be doing that.

34:22.320 --> 34:25.640
But that's Mike's conservative note for the day.

34:25.640 --> 34:28.160
Use a dedicated browser, kids, kids.

34:28.160 --> 34:30.160
That's what Internet Explorer was built for.

34:30.160 --> 34:31.160
Oh, God.

34:31.160 --> 34:32.160
No.

34:32.160 --> 34:33.160
No.

34:33.160 --> 34:34.160
Yeah.

34:34.160 --> 34:35.160
OK.

34:35.160 --> 34:37.680
I guess I shouldn't call them silly.

34:37.680 --> 34:42.280
I mean, I guess I just didn't really consider it much when they were announced.

34:42.280 --> 34:44.440
I think because you know too much.

34:44.440 --> 34:46.160
I think the average I'm serious about this.

34:46.160 --> 34:50.560
I think the average user just thought like YouTube was this cool free website and app

34:50.560 --> 34:52.160
they could use.

34:52.160 --> 34:56.220
But if they know that it's actually not free, that you're paying, it's one thing to say

34:56.220 --> 35:01.960
that you pay with your data, but to list it out in just an amazing bullet point that Apple

35:01.960 --> 35:02.960
gives you.

35:02.960 --> 35:03.960
Right.

35:03.960 --> 35:04.960
I mean, it's horrendous.

35:04.960 --> 35:06.400
Are they the good guy here?

35:06.400 --> 35:07.400
I guess.

35:07.400 --> 35:08.400
Right.

35:08.400 --> 35:09.400
Good is the point of view.

35:09.400 --> 35:13.400
But yeah, I mean, Apple would much prefer everybody to charge you ten dollars a month

35:13.400 --> 35:16.400
and they get 30 percent of that course and not do this tracking.

35:16.400 --> 35:17.400
Right.

35:17.400 --> 35:20.360
And I thought I would prefer that until I ended up having so many damn subscriptions

35:20.360 --> 35:24.280
that I feel like I'm overwhelmed by the amount of subscriptions I have.

35:24.280 --> 35:28.360
I have been mercilessly cutting subscriptions, except, of course, for unfiltered show on

35:28.360 --> 35:29.360
Patreon.

35:29.360 --> 35:31.760
Oh, oh, oh, wow.

35:31.760 --> 35:32.760
Wow.

35:32.760 --> 35:33.760
Really?

35:33.760 --> 35:40.880
I have this situation where I am the family card on the iCloud stuff.

35:40.880 --> 35:45.920
So anybody who buys anything has to use my card, which means that if the number needs

35:45.920 --> 35:47.720
to be verified, they have to track me down.

35:47.720 --> 35:53.120
But it also means that my mom, like any purchase she makes goes because I made her a family

35:53.120 --> 35:56.600
member for the obvious reasons of the benefits you get.

35:56.600 --> 36:03.100
But anytime she buys music or or anything, any app, it's it's charging to my card.

36:03.100 --> 36:04.320
And it's really annoying.

36:04.320 --> 36:05.320
It's just so annoying.

36:05.320 --> 36:06.680
Like, yeah, they get some things right.

36:06.680 --> 36:11.440
And I appreciate these changes, but there's so many areas that could still be improved.

36:11.440 --> 36:14.560
And I kind of appreciate them doing this, I suppose.

36:14.560 --> 36:19.440
But Microsoft is just going they're just going the completely different direction.

36:19.440 --> 36:20.880
They're just saying, screw it.

36:20.880 --> 36:22.600
We're not going to play that game.

36:22.600 --> 36:30.920
And they have released the xCloud beta for Web that is their Xbox game streaming service

36:30.920 --> 36:38.600
as a Web application, and they are indeed specifically targeting iPad OS and iOS.

36:38.600 --> 36:48.080
Now, you remember there was a bit of a brouhaha in August of 2020 when first Apple said, no,

36:48.080 --> 36:49.200
you're not going to have xCloud on here.

36:49.200 --> 36:50.480
Go screw yourself.

36:50.480 --> 36:56.160
Then they updated their policies to allow xCloud onto the platform, but then informed

36:56.160 --> 37:03.080
Microsoft that they would have to submit each game available on xCloud individually to the

37:03.080 --> 37:11.020
app store so that Apple could make sure each game met the app store's guidelines.

37:11.020 --> 37:12.440
In other words, no.

37:12.440 --> 37:13.440
Yeah.

37:13.440 --> 37:14.440
Yeah.

37:14.440 --> 37:16.640
And, you know, like they don't make Netflix submit every movie.

37:16.640 --> 37:17.640
That's so stupid.

37:17.640 --> 37:23.440
Anyway, so Microsoft noped out and they begun working on this xCloud Web app.

37:23.440 --> 37:25.200
And now they've launched the service.

37:25.200 --> 37:27.520
You know, you have to be like a member and you have to somehow get this.

37:27.520 --> 37:31.200
You have to be an Xbox Games Pass ultimate subscriber and all these all these things

37:31.200 --> 37:33.080
speaking of subscriptions.

37:33.080 --> 37:36.240
But I totally called this when this whole thing went down on the show.

37:36.240 --> 37:37.520
I said this is what they should do.

37:37.520 --> 37:40.040
And here they are actually doing it.

37:40.040 --> 37:45.120
And GeForce now also does it, which I have used on the iPad with a Bluetooth controller.

37:45.120 --> 37:51.880
I have played frickin Windows Steam games on my frickin iPad with a frickin controller

37:51.880 --> 37:52.880
using GeForce now.

37:52.880 --> 37:53.880
OK.

37:53.880 --> 37:56.440
If you haven't tried this, it's not bad if you have a decent connection.

37:56.440 --> 37:57.440
It's not bad.

37:57.440 --> 38:01.400
I'm still super skeptical of all this stuff just because of the vast majority of the country

38:01.400 --> 38:03.520
that has crappy Internet.

38:03.520 --> 38:07.000
And I know I say this like every two weeks now, but I know it's true until we can get

38:07.000 --> 38:11.440
some sort of like big government program to just lay fiber everywhere.

38:11.440 --> 38:12.880
I don't believe in any of this.

38:12.880 --> 38:14.360
And I know you love Stadia.

38:14.360 --> 38:16.320
Your buddy Elon's working on Starlink.

38:16.320 --> 38:17.320
Yeah, right.

38:17.320 --> 38:18.320
OK.

38:18.320 --> 38:20.440
Hey, speaking of failed projects.

38:20.440 --> 38:21.440
Yeah.

38:21.440 --> 38:22.440
Yeah.

38:22.440 --> 38:23.440
TensorFlow with Swift.

38:23.440 --> 38:24.440
We've got this.

38:24.440 --> 38:28.920
I think Swift on the server in general has been a miserable failure.

38:28.920 --> 38:36.560
And I'm someone who financially supported Vapor, which was a Swift on the server project.

38:36.560 --> 38:41.360
And it's sad because it really should have been a contender to Rust and Go, particularly

38:41.360 --> 38:42.360
Go.

38:42.360 --> 38:43.360
I kind of feel.

38:43.360 --> 38:44.360
Yeah, it could have been a contender.

38:44.360 --> 38:47.920
You know, I think because it's Apple's language, it's too tied to iOS.

38:47.920 --> 38:48.920
Yeah.

38:48.920 --> 38:52.400
And the back end development community just didn't take it seriously.

38:52.400 --> 38:56.400
There was that whole IBM partnership that basically just died in the cradle.

38:56.400 --> 39:00.840
I think it's it's a lot of things, obviously, but a couple that stand out to me is so much

39:00.840 --> 39:03.040
momentum in other areas.

39:03.040 --> 39:08.080
And you have server space players like Google that are backing Go.

39:08.080 --> 39:10.640
And that has a ton of weight behind it.

39:10.640 --> 39:12.160
But I think you nailed it.

39:12.160 --> 39:15.200
It's just Swift is it's too focused on iOS.

39:15.200 --> 39:20.520
But the dream early on in the early days of Swift, it kind of made sense in a way because

39:20.520 --> 39:25.960
you could use Swift for the front end and the back end and you could see how that could

39:25.960 --> 39:29.680
be compelling to somebody who just develops in that ecosystem.

39:29.680 --> 39:34.520
And it makes it easy to run Swift apps on a Mac, you know, first for a Mac server, which

39:34.520 --> 39:39.200
is a thing that happens in schools is they have servers that they call servers that are

39:39.200 --> 39:43.280
actually Macs and you could run it on that or you could run on a Linux box and then you

39:43.280 --> 39:45.760
could deploy it on iOS or the Mac desktop.

39:45.760 --> 39:48.600
If you were in that ecosystem, I saw it.

39:48.600 --> 39:50.160
I could see how it made sense.

39:50.160 --> 39:51.160
Yeah, you will.

39:51.160 --> 39:55.720
You will pry that excerpt from your local public school districts cold dead hands, right?

39:55.720 --> 39:59.520
They've had it for 15 years and God damn it, they're keeping it.

39:59.520 --> 40:04.680
There was literally in Linux 511 that released on Sunday of this week.

40:04.680 --> 40:10.600
There is an update in there for the SMC controller in the Apple excerpt.

40:10.600 --> 40:13.040
Oh, no, I'm not joking.

40:13.040 --> 40:14.600
Like schools still use excerpt.

40:14.600 --> 40:15.600
Yeah, yeah.

40:15.600 --> 40:16.840
It's not a joke at all.

40:16.840 --> 40:18.440
Like they they really do.

40:18.440 --> 40:22.440
Yeah, and actually they were really badass in two ways.

40:22.440 --> 40:28.600
They had really cool airflow design, but also they had CPU monitor LED lights on the front

40:28.600 --> 40:32.360
of the case that showed you the CPU load of the server, which is a cool idea.

40:32.360 --> 40:35.960
Should we maybe explain what excerpt is for our younger listeners?

40:35.960 --> 40:36.960
Right.

40:36.960 --> 40:38.560
The the Apple excerpt.

40:38.560 --> 40:46.080
So when Apple got into Intel chips, when they switched over to Intel chips from PowerPC,

40:46.080 --> 40:53.680
a little while after that came their first Intel server called the excerpt.

40:53.680 --> 40:55.680
And it was probably a to you.

40:55.680 --> 40:58.600
I can't remember exactly what the size of it was there to you.

40:58.600 --> 40:59.600
Yeah.

40:59.600 --> 41:00.600
Oh, you know what?

41:00.600 --> 41:01.600
Actually, I'm talking on my arse.

41:01.600 --> 41:04.280
They had a they had a PowerPC version of it.

41:04.280 --> 41:05.280
That's right.

41:05.280 --> 41:06.280
They had that.

41:06.280 --> 41:07.280
In fact, that was one of the reasons they had to update the cooling.

41:07.280 --> 41:08.280
Oh, I didn't know that.

41:08.280 --> 41:09.880
I thought it came out with the Intel trends.

41:09.880 --> 41:11.080
No, no, I remember now.

41:11.080 --> 41:13.640
Yeah, they had they had a PowerPC version.

41:13.640 --> 41:18.080
But it was the Xeon line that I think people people like that's what you'll find on eBay

41:18.080 --> 41:19.080
now.

41:19.080 --> 41:21.880
They had like a 2006, 2008 and 2009 model.

41:21.880 --> 41:24.840
It was first introduced in 2002.

41:24.840 --> 41:27.320
And you can imagine it's kind of expensive because it was Apple.

41:27.320 --> 41:34.120
But they really focused in on making Mac OS a server version of it with an LDAP directory

41:34.120 --> 41:35.120
and everything.

41:35.120 --> 41:39.200
And then you could later on you could get a storage connection that was fiber connected

41:39.200 --> 41:40.400
and really fast.

41:40.400 --> 41:43.320
And they made several of them for, you know, for a while.

41:43.320 --> 41:47.440
I mean, the product ran from 2002 to 2009.

41:47.440 --> 41:49.160
Then they finally they finally killed it off.

41:49.160 --> 41:51.720
They even made a like a cluster version.

41:51.720 --> 41:57.960
If you were going to use it in in a in a cluster, you could get the G4 cluster node.

41:57.960 --> 42:01.040
And that was one that was designed just like no CD-ROM drive.

42:01.040 --> 42:03.040
Certain connectivity was gone.

42:03.040 --> 42:04.560
Only one disk spot.

42:04.560 --> 42:08.360
But it was you could buy a bunch of them if you were you could network them together in

42:08.360 --> 42:09.360
a cluster.

42:09.360 --> 42:10.360
Yeah.

42:10.360 --> 42:11.360
Yeah.

42:11.360 --> 42:12.520
And then they had the LED lights on there.

42:12.520 --> 42:14.480
And it was actually it was cool.

42:14.480 --> 42:17.560
It was it was a pretty good product in in a lot of ways.

42:17.560 --> 42:19.200
It was built really well.

42:19.200 --> 42:23.680
I ended up having a couple of clients that had them and I was always impressed by them.

42:23.680 --> 42:26.280
And I ended up even putting Gen 2 Linux on a couple of them.

42:26.280 --> 42:27.280
And it ran great.

42:27.280 --> 42:28.280
Yeah.

42:28.280 --> 42:30.800
Well, they were really big in the education space, too, right?

42:30.800 --> 42:34.520
Like a lot of schools ran their entire system off of XServe.

42:34.520 --> 42:37.400
I had a client that was a it was a Final Cut shop.

42:37.400 --> 42:41.320
And what they did all day long was edit video for court cases.

42:41.320 --> 42:45.060
And so they were they were an XServe user and they had a couple of them and that big

42:45.060 --> 42:48.600
storage array that they had, too, which back then, you know, was only a few terabytes.

42:48.600 --> 42:49.600
But it was amazing.

42:49.600 --> 42:50.600
A terabyte?

42:50.600 --> 42:51.600
What?

42:51.600 --> 42:52.600
Several, I think.

42:52.600 --> 42:56.280
I think it was like two, two terabytes.

42:56.280 --> 42:57.280
So watch out.

42:57.280 --> 43:00.840
You know, that's going to last forever.

43:00.840 --> 43:05.480
Before we go, thank you to our members over at CoderQA.co.

43:05.480 --> 43:07.120
You make this show possible.

43:07.120 --> 43:12.360
You get a limited ad feed as a member and you also get the Coderly that comes out once

43:12.360 --> 43:13.360
a quarter.

43:13.360 --> 43:14.360
So get that.

43:14.360 --> 43:19.880
Support the show and get that limited ad feed at CoderQA.co.

43:19.880 --> 43:22.760
Mr. Dominic, is there anything you want to plug before we get out of here today?

43:22.760 --> 43:25.240
Just follow me on Twitter at Dumanuco.

43:25.240 --> 43:31.480
And if you have not seen WandaVision, seriously, yes, I'm not I haven't finished it yet.

43:31.480 --> 43:32.640
Really enjoying that.

43:32.640 --> 43:37.600
Also clever, like I think if this is what the Marvel Universe TV series are going to

43:37.600 --> 43:39.400
be like, they're going to be a hit.

43:39.400 --> 43:41.760
Disney Plus is going to drink the blood of peacock.

43:41.760 --> 43:42.760
Yes.

43:42.760 --> 43:43.760
Yeah.

43:43.760 --> 43:45.800
I finally just started The Expanse, by the way.

43:45.800 --> 43:47.160
Oh, how is it?

43:47.160 --> 43:48.160
Really good.

43:48.160 --> 43:49.720
I just got into season two of it.

43:49.720 --> 43:51.960
So I'm really early into it.

43:51.960 --> 43:57.480
But what I find really nice about it is it is really good at building the world.

43:57.480 --> 44:01.680
It feels like a real place that just everything in it feels legitimate.

44:01.680 --> 44:04.880
The characters seem real, the environment, the context.

44:04.880 --> 44:07.820
And then the other thing, and this isn't a spoiler that I really like about it, is it

44:07.820 --> 44:12.580
all as far as I know, I don't know, but it all takes place in our solar system.

44:12.580 --> 44:18.440
So unlike Star Trek or Star Wars, where they're, you know, warping across the galaxy, this

44:18.440 --> 44:21.540
is all just right here in our backyard.

44:21.540 --> 44:25.440
And I love that concept because it is so big and there's a lot you could do with that.

44:25.440 --> 44:26.440
So it's a pretty fun series.

44:26.440 --> 44:27.800
So those are there you go.

44:27.800 --> 44:28.960
Those are two show picks, I guess.

44:28.960 --> 44:29.960
Check it out.

44:29.960 --> 44:35.160
And you know what, ironically, then like a chaser, I follow with a little bit of Seinfeld

44:35.160 --> 44:37.840
these days, which holds up.

44:37.840 --> 44:38.840
It does.

44:38.840 --> 44:41.960
And it reminds you of better days where if you're our age, you think the 90s were better

44:41.960 --> 44:42.960
days.

44:42.960 --> 44:43.960
That's right.

44:43.960 --> 44:44.960
That's right.

44:44.960 --> 44:47.480
You can also find Mike's company at The Mad Botter Inc. on Twitter.

44:47.480 --> 44:48.960
I'm at Chris Lass.

44:48.960 --> 44:50.480
The network is at Jupiter Signal.

44:50.480 --> 44:52.800
And of course, the show is at Coder Radio Show.

44:52.800 --> 44:57.040
Links to what we talked about today, well, that's at our website, coder.show slash 401.

44:57.040 --> 44:58.440
You also find the contact form.

44:58.440 --> 45:02.240

45:02.240 --> 45:03.480

45:05.360 --> 45:09.160
