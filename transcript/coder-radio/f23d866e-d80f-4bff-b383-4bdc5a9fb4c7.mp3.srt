00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
This is Kota Radio, episode 363, for June 24th, 2019.

2
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Hello, and welcome to Kota Radio,

3
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show that takes a pragmatic look,

4
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:46,000
well, at least most of the time, at the art and business of software development and related technologies.

5
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:52,000
My name is Wes, and I'm joined by our very best co-host, Mr. Michael Dominic.

6
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Welcome back, Mike.

7
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Hello, hello.

8
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Now, we're lucky enough to be joined by one other troublesome fellow today, Mr. Chris Fisher. Hi, Chris.

9
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Here comes trouble.

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
That's right.

11
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
That's what they always said. Every IT job I ever went to, and I'd walk up with another guy.

12
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
If it's just me, they wouldn't say that, but two of you, here comes trouble.

13
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Well, you know, you got a buddy, a schemer, someone to help.

14
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Somebody, I know somebody else has had that problem out in IT. Shout out at Chris Elias.

15
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Yeah, well, when I heard you guys were talking about the art and business again,

16
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
at least one of your topics was the art and business of software development.

17
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Those are always my favorite.

18
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Yeah, I mean, it's deep because I love all the tech stuff. I really do.

19
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
And we're going to start with a little of that today.

20
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,000
But, you know, you got to do this for a living, and it gets wrapped up in how you live your life,

21
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
and that kind of, that kind of matters a lot. You only got one.

22
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
A lot of things Mike and I talk about off air is more like the how do you keep at it kind of aspect,

23
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
and that's something we've brought into the show over the years.

24
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,000
And, yeah, I wanted to contribute to that conversation because it's something that,

25
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
even as things have changed here for us as we've become part of Linux Academy,

26
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:01,000
my roles have changed, my work has changed, and that's had strange and different and unexpected impacts on me.

27
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
And I'm just kind of getting to the other side of it, and I've learned some things

28
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,000
and some lessons that I thought I already knew, but you got to learn them again sometimes.

29
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Anyway, so when we get there, I'm excited to talk about it.

30
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
But I know we have a lot of things to talk about today, not just that.

31
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Thanks for letting me be here.

32
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Oh, yeah, of course. How are you doing today, Mike?

33
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I'm good, I'm good. I'm looking forward to our menage a trois once again.

34
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Did you load the new Mac OS Catalina beta?

35
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
No, because I'm not insane.

36
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
No, I got no intentions, no intentions of doing that.

37
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
This is going to be the most interesting in terms of impact just because of the 64-bit transition

38
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
and the read-only system stuff.

39
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
So I am fascinated from an observer standpoint.

40
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
It's interesting to watch them develop that operating system now that, you know,

41
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
we were kind of questioning for a while how much work are they putting in on that side of the fence,

42
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,000
but we're kind of seeing more now, even if half of it is Project Catalyst.

43
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Yeah, I think they're actually, it seems like, it seems like they're about to actually make the Mac

44
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
a competitive workstation platform again.

45
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Another rumor out today, 16-inch MacBook Pro with a new keyboard shipping in September, which we'll see.

46
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Now, how are we, I've been promised a new keyboard before, so when we say new.

47
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Well, you know, there was an interesting omission in a recent interview on a podcast

48
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:26,000
with one of the lead engineers of the Mac Pro, and he said that the current generation of MacBooks

49
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:32,000
were designed and built before their new Pro Services team that they worked with to design the iMac Pro

50
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,000
and the Mac Pro, and that the MacBook Pro would have the same treatment,

51
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
the entire line would have the same treatment is what the statement was.

52
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Interesting.

53
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Can you get the cheese grater form in that form factor?

54
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Well, I think what they're going to do is they're going to come up with a super MacBook Pro,

55
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,000
like a big 16-inch that justifies a completely different keyboard.

56
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
So they'll keep maybe the keyboard on the current MacBook Pro that they just updated.

57
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:00,000
But they'll have a super expensive workstation model for, you know, all the complainers out there.

58
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
So it's a $5,000 laptop is what that means.

59
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Yeah, we should all start a little savings jar somewhere.

60
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Yeah, exactly. I don't think so.

61
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I think, actually, I'm pretty happy. I've come to a new thing, so I'm pretty happy.

62
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I know you guys have got a lot to talk about, though.

63
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
That's not what we're here to talk about today.

64
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Yeah, yeah, you know what I would probably be running on that?

65
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Well, we'll see. We'll get into that.

66
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,000
It might be Kotlin because that's my programming language challenge.

67
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Not quite of the week, but, you know, the one we're doing right now.

68
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Are you doing them weekly now, really?

69
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I thought you kind of changed a little bit.

70
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Like, you're giving a little more room if it needs to really go deep, right?

71
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Yeah, we're alternating.

72
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
So, Mike, you're looking at Go now, so we'll talk about that at the next episode,

73
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
which I'm really looking forward to.

74
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
And you were looking at Kotlin.

75
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Yeah, I've had a little time to sit and play with Kotlin.

76
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Yeah, if you're not familiar, it's developed by JetBrains and managed by, well,

77
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,000
of course, the Kotlin Foundation because everyone's got to have a foundation these days.

78
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:58,000
It's interesting because one version of the story for Kotlin could have been that it was this,

79
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
like, niche little language, right?

80
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Lots of people try to make languages.

81
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Google made Dart, for instance, which seems somewhat comparable and comes to mind.

82
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Most languages don't go anywhere.

83
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Now, JetBrains has some advantages in that they make some of the best software development tools

84
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
in the business.

85
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,000
So they clearly know a lot about, you know, you have to get in your hooks into these languages

86
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
if you're going to make a nice IDE.

87
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
So you learn a lot about how that all works and maybe how to put one together.

88
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,000
It's just, it's been very impressive that Kotlin has become so popular so fast,

89
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:32,000
and, like, in particular with Google adopting it as, you know, language du jour on Android.

90
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
For me, I came from a lot more dynamic languages before,

91
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
and I'd done a little bit of some of the statically typed languages like ML

92
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
way in the past when I was, you know, learning computer science,

93
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
and I hadn't dabbled that much in Java.

94
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I came to Java late in life, and I'll be honest, it was kind of painful.

95
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Mike, I'm sure you can sympathize with that.

96
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Oh, yeah. Oof.

97
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
So how did you work your way through it?

98
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I mean, mostly I just sort of avoided it and used it where I could.

99
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
But it is useful, right?

100
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I mean, the JVM is a fantastic platform to run on top of,

101
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
and there's world-class libraries out there for Java,

102
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:13,000
so you need or at least will want to sort of use those things.

103
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
But things seemed like they really changed kind of recently

104
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
when the situation between Oracle and Google heated up.

105
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Yeah, that's a complicating factor, that's for sure.

106
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Oracle, yeah. Oh, boy, Oracle.

107
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Yeah. It seems like that head-to-head battle sort of started.

108
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000
You saw more and more Android developers start to look at Kotlin,

109
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
and Google itself would start to talk about Kotlin more.

110
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
And if I understand, and I really don't,

111
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
but the little bit that I do seem to understand

112
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
is that Kotlin has a pretty similar syntax and concept

113
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
from a lot of popular languages.

114
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
So it's not a huge transition.

115
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
No, that's what's nice, is to me, it's been a breath of fresh air.

116
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
So it's not going to be like my go-to language.

117
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I still really like some of the more functional things.

118
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Not that we can talk more.

119
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
You can do functional programming in Kotlin.

120
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
It's just not, you know, super aimed towards it,

121
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
like something like Haskell or Clojure is.

122
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
But I didn't, you know, I never really enjoyed Java.

123
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
You can make Java work really well.

124
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
You can do whatever you want.

125
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
It's a very powerful language.

126
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I just find it not a lot of fun to write

127
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
and it doesn't really inspire me to want to use it.

128
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
But you often need to use it places,

129
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
either for performance or just as bindings to hook into stuff,

130
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
libraries that you want to use,

131
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
or you're interrupting with people who use Java.

132
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
And Kotlin seems incredible there.

133
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Now, you could use something like Scala maybe or Clojure,

134
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:37,000
but Kotlin's interoperability with Java is really just first class.

135
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:42,000
And when you're not doing interop, it's just like Java plus plus.

136
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
So if you're creating a Kotlin app or whatever,

137
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
is it running in a Kotlin runtime or the JVM?

138
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Is it a binary app?

139
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Yeah, so it just compiles down to JVM bytecode.

140
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
It can actually, you can actually do both.

141
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
So there is a thing called Kotlin Native

142
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
where you can straight up compile down to native code.

143
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Oh, OK.

144
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
But 99% it's the JVM.

145
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Yeah, so that's the main use case that you see

146
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
or for stuff like running on Android,

147
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
which is similar but slightly different.

148
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:16,000
And there is a weird, there is a weird JavaScript transpiling thing.

149
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I have never done that.

150
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
But, you know, everything has to transpile to JavaScript now.

151
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
So why not Kotlin?

152
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Yeah, that does seem to be the theme so far of these challenges.

153
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
So the thing about JavaScript is that you can't avoid it, right,

154
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
unless you only do back-end work for some service

155
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
that connects other back-end services.

156
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
OK, maybe you're in that narrow field that you've escaped it.

157
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
But if you do anything on the web,

158
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
you just have to use JavaScript, right?

159
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
And JavaScript, it's getting better,

160
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
but it's still painful and inconsistent.

161
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Now, I don't, having just come from TypeScript,

162
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I didn't play a ton with the JS side of Kotlin,

163
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
although I did get it up and running

164
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
and sort of poked around a little bit.

165
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I don't know that I would necessarily choose that over TypeScript

166
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
just because TypeScript seems to be so popular

167
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
in the JavaScript community.

168
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
And you get a lot of the same benefits there

169
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
if you enable those options.

170
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Now you get them in Kotlin by default.

171
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Like, I love the way Kotlin handles null types,

172
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
non-null types, that sort of stuff.

173
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
The way you think about it without...

174
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
It's just, in some languages, you add it on with a monad,

175
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
like maybe or either,

176
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
and you see it everywhere in your code.

177
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
And that can be nice because it is very explicit, right?

178
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
You are thinking about, like, what's the failure case here?

179
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Is this an error?

180
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Kotlin, because they've sort of designed it

181
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,000
and lowered it into the fabric of the language explicitly,

182
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
it just feels a little bit more ergonomic,

183
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
and you kind of forget about it a little bit more.

184
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
We've talked a little bit, they're bringing some of those,

185
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
like you say, they're importing these features

186
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
from other popular languages,

187
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
and then other languages are copying them.

188
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
So it's kind of an interesting way to reflect

189
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
on language design as well

190
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
because JetBrains has been looking around,

191
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
studying what's been popular in the industry,

192
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
and there's been a lot of attempts at this stuff.

193
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Like, Scala seems like a good example,

194
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
where it's a little bit more of a research language, right?

195
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
It's designed and developed by a lot of academics,

196
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
and it's absolutely a production language.

197
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Right, but where Kotlin seems like it's very much

198
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
on the other end of that spectrum.

199
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
It's very much inspired by this Java,

200
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
sort of just, like, robust, professional, no-nonsense.

201
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
We're not going to be that flashy.

202
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Right, our sales pitch isn't that we're

203
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
some sort of unique, innovative language.

204
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
It's more like, well, it's really pragmatic.

205
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
It draws on inspirations from decades of things

206
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
that have worked, which I think is part

207
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
of what's made it easily adoptable.

208
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I think, Mike, you saw this one coming a mile away.

209
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Yeah, I mean, Kotlin, even before Android adopted it,

210
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
or rather Google adopted it for Android,

211
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,000
just, I think at the time when I first saw this come out,

212
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I was working on a very large-scale Java Play application,

213
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:55,000
and the interoperability that Kotlin provided,

214
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,000
even in its early days, just basically being a cleaner

215
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
and, frankly, somewhat less verbose Java

216
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
that could still pull in the client's existing JARs,

217
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
and, you know, so JARs are Java libraries, right?

218
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
And completely, you know, pulling great old dependencies,

219
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
just like your straight Java, was really nice.

220
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Now, having said that, things have changed.

221
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
That was years ago.

222
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I have to agree with Wes that Kotlin maybe wouldn't

223
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
be my first choice anymore.

224
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I'd probably try something a little more functional.

225
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:29,000
For me, that'd probably look more like an F sharp.

226
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,000
But I have to say, given the choice,

227
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
like if I was targeting the JVM again,

228
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,000
I would probably be hard-pressed not to pick Kotlin, right?

229
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I would be pretty enthusiastic about Kotlin over straight Java.

230
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
And some of the irony here is the JDK 11

231
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:51,000
is adopting many of the features of Kotlin.

232
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Right.

233
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Stuff that they had in their compiler

234
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
will now be supported in the host,

235
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
or at least one of their hosts.

236
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
That is interesting.

237
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
It does seem like a good choice, too, you know,

238
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
if you're not going to go pursue some of the more esoteric

239
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
or functional, you know.

240
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
If you have a team and everyone wants to go do Scala

241
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
and you're excited about Scala Z and some of the neat stuff

242
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
in that community, cool.

243
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
But if you just sort of want a better Java,

244
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
you want some improvements, a little modernization,

245
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
really nice IDE support.

246
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Yeah, Kotlin seems like a good choice.

247
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
I'm curious what your process like was here.

248
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Did you try standing up a few things?

249
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Did you look at examples?

250
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Like what's your exploratory...

251
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I usually start by following sort of whatever

252
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
the most official-looking documentation is

253
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
just to try to get a sense of like what's the onboarding path

254
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
for some random person coming from the Internet

255
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
just curious about the language.

256
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
It's good thinking.

257
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Yeah.

258
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
And in this case, it had been a while since I'd used IntelliJ,

259
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
so I got that going.

260
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
I know there's some integrations,

261
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
like they have a sublime text,

262
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
and I did play around with it just kind of using it minimal style

263
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
in the terminal with Vim.

264
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
But it seemed proper coming from JetBrains.

265
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
I should use it in its sort of home environment.

266
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
So that was an interesting part too just because I don't...

267
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
I'm not...

268
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
I mean, I appreciate all the neat features of IDEs

269
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
and I think especially for some of the languages

270
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
in the Kotlin and Scala and Java style,

271
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
like those IDEs are great.

272
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Yeah, it's just not where you live every day though.

273
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Yeah, exactly.

274
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
So that was kind of fun being on that side of the fence.

275
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
It was nice.

276
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
And it is, I mean, you know,

277
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
autocomplete and generating code for you,

278
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:22,000
and it's an interesting alternative style of development.

279
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
But it is in the spirit of, you know, fast feedback cycles

280
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
and giving you information and helping you understand.

281
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:31,000
And instead of a running program, it's a static thing.

282
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
But it feels incredibly dynamic because they're doing so much

283
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
to interrupt and interrogate with the code.

284
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Get development environment set up,

285
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
and then I usually start with just some, like,

286
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
simple academic challenges.

287
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
I've been doing the advent of code because I like...

288
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
They're not purely...

289
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
You know, it's not just like a sorting algorithm

290
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
or something like that.

291
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
It's a little bit of novelty and some, like,

292
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
data loading and processing.

293
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
So you have to start doing some stuff.

294
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Like, you want to start, you know, looking at IO,

295
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
looking at networking.

296
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Sure.

297
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Trying to understand, like,

298
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
how's the concurrency working in this language?

299
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Yeah, when you think about the scope of it,

300
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
it's a lot of things to touch on.

301
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
You might also want to start, you know,

302
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
maybe you want to...

303
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Depending on the type of language,

304
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
maybe you want to try to get, like,

305
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
a web stack up and going.

306
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Of course.

307
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
I didn't do that this time.

308
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
But, right, that's a good one to start a play with

309
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
and see, all right, what's the, you know,

310
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
connections to the databases like?

311
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Now, that's easier here because I was just using the JVM,

312
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
and that was an environment I was already familiar.

313
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
So most of the stuff I was interested in

314
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
was some of the compiler type safety,

315
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
all the little extras that Kotlin's thrown on top.

316
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
It has been fun.

317
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
While I was doing some research,

318
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
I'll have a link in the doc, of course,

319
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
coder.show-363.

320
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
There's a Clojure IDE called Cursive,

321
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:45,000
and it's like a plug-in wrapper sits on top of IntelliJ.

322
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Clojure's a little harder because it is a very dynamic language,

323
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
so you can't do...

324
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Or it's more difficult to do a lot of the static analysis

325
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,000
that you can do for languages like Kotlin.

326
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
It's also a little bit heavier,

327
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:59,000
or at least has more runtime, more dynamic nature,

328
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:04,000
so it can't always or isn't as easy to optimize in certain cases.

329
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Originally, this IDE for Clojure

330
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
was written mostly in Clojure,

331
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
but the developer has recently changed

332
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
a whole bunch of its core to Kotlin

333
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
so that he could get better startup times,

334
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
and he just thought that the interoperability

335
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
with having to, you know, you have to hook into a bunch of Java

336
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,000
because that's what IntelliJ is based on,

337
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
thought that was more pleasant.

338
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
So it seems like that's exactly the use case I was thinking of.

339
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
I wouldn't maybe design my whole data flow pipeline

340
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:33,000
of architecture of my program and choose Kotlin,

341
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
but all the little pieces where I got to touch systems

342
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:39,000
or a little hot loop instead of Java, why not Kotlin?

343
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
I think that's the theme of my review.

344
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Why not Kotlin?

345
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
That's pretty good.

346
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
That's actually kind of a title right there.

347
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Good one.

348
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Nice.

349
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
So now it's go time.

350
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Now it's go time, yeah.

351
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
So now it's go time,

352
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
but are you ready for your challenge for two weeks from now?

353
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Oh, I am excited already.

354
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
All right, all right.

355
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
So you've taken the journey,

356
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
you've held hands with Javaduke,

357
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,000
and if you get that reference, you're old.

358
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,000
And now you knew this was coming.

359
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Objective C.

360
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Oh.

361
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
No way.

362
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
You're throwing the gauntlet down, aren't you?

363
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Wow.

364
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Actually, I mean, part of me thought it was going to be

365
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
the first one he chose,

366
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
so I'm kind of surprised it took this long.

367
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Absolutely.

368
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Okay, I need a little help here then.

369
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Can I get like maybe some suggested first steps?

370
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Like what's the – what would you like to make sure that I –

371
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
what shouldn't I miss when I'm trying Objective C

372
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
and maybe how do I get started?

373
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Oh, yeah, because there's a lot here for Mike.

374
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
So, yeah, there's a lot here, right?

375
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
And, you know, to make it easier,

376
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,000
just do a GNU step, the Linux implementation,

377
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
so you don't have to like worry about Mac VMs.

378
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Oh, well that's nice of you.

379
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
That is nice.

380
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Right?

381
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
I mean, if you want to set up a Mac VM, you can,

382
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
but by the time you do that, it's a huge pain in the ass.

383
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,000
The next version of Swift will be out.

384
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Yeah.

385
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
I would say take a look at GNU step

386
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,000
and try to write any kind of small application.

387
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
It could literally do – I don't care.

388
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
It could do nothing, right?

389
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:15,000
But do it using pure message passing as much as possible.

390
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Oh, wow.

391
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Okay.

392
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Yeah.

393
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Right.

394
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
So take advantage of the dynamic messaging that Objective C has.

395
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,000
So like you could – you could just write C, right?

396
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Because this is a superset of C.

397
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Of course, right.

398
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
You could also write in a very C++-y style.

399
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Try not to do that.

400
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
I mean, you'll have to some, but yeah,

401
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
try to do a lot of the dynamic messaging

402
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,000
and see what it feels like to not have the compiler protect you.

403
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Just sort of pass messages around and deal with it.

404
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Okay.

405
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Just pass them around.

406
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
That's it.

407
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Oh, man.

408
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
I cannot wait to hear how this goes.

409
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
This is – okay, this will be good.

410
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
I'm going to have to get started right away.

411
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
And I just linked to GNU step in the chat,

412
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:56,000
and I tell you, Wes, this project looks like it's well-maintained.

413
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Real.

414
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Mmm.

415
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Oh, it's –

416
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,000
So this might be as much a GNU step report as anything else, huh?

417
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Oh, man.

418
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Look at that.

419
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
That takes me back.

420
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Look at that user experience there.

421
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,000
We've got to put this in the show notes so the audience can take a look at this.

422
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
This is too good.

423
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
And this is, of course, more of a trolly one,

424
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,000
so if it ends up just being a pain, whatever, we can all have a good laugh.

425
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,000
No, this is a great choice, and, you know, it comes up so much.

426
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
It's so much a part of the Coder Radio heritage.

427
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:25,000
I've got to – I need to – this is my journey to explore Objective-C.

428
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
You're a brave man, Wes.

429
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

430
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,000
News about Objective-C 2.0.

431
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
This is going to be amazing, Wes.

432
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,000
I'm not entirely sure when the last time this project was maintained is.

433
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

434
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,000
It may be easier to get a Mac VM going.

435
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
I think some of the listeners did.

436
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,000
They were talking about it in the Telegram.

437
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Hmm.

438
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
I'm pretty close.

439
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
I still haven't cracked it, but I'm really close.

440
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
I'm pretty good on that.

441
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Yeah.

442
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
I'm really close.

443
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
You are.

444
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
You know, you have Hackintosh experience.

445
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Yeah.

446
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
I do, too.

447
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
It's funny.

448
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
I got the GPU working.

449
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
That wasn't the hard part.

450
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
It turns out the hard part has been getting the USB password to work.

451
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:08,000
So my Mac VM detects my Ethernet cards but never gets an IP.

452
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Hmm.

453
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:13,000
And my mouse and keyboard aren't working too well because something's not quite right.

454
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
But it works fine under Windows, so.

455
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
So it's not the underlying scheme.

456
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
I don't think so.

457
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Hard to say, though.

458
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Mac OS.

459
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Excuse me.

460
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Excuse me.

461
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
It's such a black box.

462
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,000
I mean, it's kind of fun to play with and poke with because you don't know what's going

463
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
on, but.

464
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,000
I, as much as I respect what Apple has done with Mac OS, when you do the Hackintosh or

465
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,000
the VM route, you do kind of see under the hood a little bit.

466
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:39,000
You're like, oh, it's just like every other OS.

467
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,000
There's subsystems that are like thought out, up to date, right?

468
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
They put a lot of time and tooling into.

469
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
That's the parts I respect the most, especially as a media production person.

470
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Yes.

471
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
I can really respect that.

472
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
I mean, Apple audio.

473
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Mm-hmm.

474
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Mm-hmm.

475
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
And then other parts, you're like, oh, and then you just, you had some twine left over

476
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
from the nice thing.

477
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Yeah.

478
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,000
And you used that to wrap up the rest into a pseudo POSIX implementation.

479
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Yeah.

480
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
A lot, actually.

481
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
It's a lot like that.

482
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
But, you know, it works, right?

483
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
It does.

484
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
On their targeted hardware.

485
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
It totally does.

486
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,000
In their problem domain, they've got it figured out, and that's what matters.

487
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
They're not solving for me.

488
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Are we ever going to see a server again?

489
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
No.

490
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Well, no, actually, I think, yeah, didn't they, well, they just announced like a SKU

491
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
of the Mac Pro that's designed for rack mount.

492
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
You're right there.

493
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Yeah.

494
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
That's pretty close.

495
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Yeah.

496
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Wow.

497
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:32,000
So it'll have like, I think instead of like handles and wheels, it'll have like rail mounts.

498
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
That'd be pretty, that'd actually look pretty slick.

499
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Not bad.

500
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:39,000
I mean, and, you know, I guess $5,000 for a starting price of a server isn't outrageous.

501
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Right.

502
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Once you put it in that context, it's kind of like, okay.

503
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:46,000
It's just like my real fancy little weird GPU compute cluster that looks pretty.

504
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,000
I mean, you know, if you have a nice aesthetic, you've shown it off.

505
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:55,000
I think that case is ugly as hell, but we should move on to real time follow up here.

506
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Apparently, you can apt install GNU step.

507
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Lucky you.

508
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Give that a try there, Wes.

509
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Try it right now.

510
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
See what happens.

511
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
He's got his ThinkPad right here.

512
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Oh, yeah.

513
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Here we go.

514
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Yeah.

515
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
All right.

516
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Hitting yes.

517
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
64 megabytes coming on down.

518
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
That's all it is, baby.

519
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
GNU step and GNU step tack to Val.

520
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Those are the two.

521
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
I love it.

522
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
I'm excited.

523
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Thank you, Mike.

524
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
I hope you like square brackets.

525
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
I love all kinds of brackets.

526
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
I'm not a, I don't choose between my bracket.

527
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,160
I mean, I think curly is my favorite because it's just really fun, like on a whiteboard

528
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:27,000
to draw, you know, a really pretty curly brace.

529
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,000
No, it intimidates me to try to draw a curly bracket on a whiteboard.

530
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Yeah, it's nice.

531
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,560
I can't draw a curly brace.

532
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:34,240
I always feel like an idiot.

533
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:40,600
So I had kind of a topic that caught my attention that was actually brought up by Mike in our

534
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:41,600
Slack chat.

535
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:42,600
Yeah.

536
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:45,280
So Mike brought it up and then you sort of were sucked into a rabbit hole, I'm pretty

537
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:46,280
sure.

538
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:47,280
As I do.

539
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,400
As I do.

540
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:53,760
Something I noticed when I went independent with Jupiter Broadcasting, I thought to myself

541
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:58,960
originally I'll convert this into what I called a lifestyle business and I'll just run it

542
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:07,920
as a small little business that makes enough living for myself and you know, a few employees.

543
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:11,680
And that was a beautiful dream that was absolutely impossible.

544
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:18,920
When you look at the hustle as a service culture that we now live in, it was never really going

545
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,360
to be sustainable.

546
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:26,040
And there is this pride that has developed in Western culture, even worse in the United

547
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:33,680
States, that Alexis Ohanian, the investor and guy behind Reddit now, really nailed in

548
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:40,120
an interview that Mike found on Wall Street Journal and I'll just read part of his opening

549
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:41,120
statement here.

550
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:46,000
He says, I've spoken out quite a bit about things like hustle porn and the ceremony of

551
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:50,000
showing off on social media about how hard you're working.

552
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:54,720
You see, you all see it on Instagram and you certainly see it in the startup community.

553
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:57,120
It becomes really toxic.

554
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:03,920
And this became like amazingly poignant just this week when over the weekend there was

555
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:13,240
this massive kerfuffle about Ubuntu potentially dropping 32-bit or I-386 support in 1910 Ubuntu.

556
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:16,440
Oh boy, my 32 bits.

557
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:18,560
That was announced last Tuesday.

558
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:22,020
It's actually, we have all the links in Linux Action News.

559
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:28,840
It's actually been in discussion roughly since May 4th, 2018 and I have followed the discussion

560
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:29,840
since then.

561
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:32,440
We've covered it in a couple of our shows actually.

562
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:37,720
But on Tuesday, Will Cook, the desktop manager for Ubuntu, announced that they were officially

563
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:42,240
going to deprecate support for the I-386 architecture.

564
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,240
That was on Tuesday.

565
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:49,160
On Friday, a Valve developer noticed, I guess he wasn't following it super close, but kind

566
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:50,160
of close.

567
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:56,600
And he immediately tweeted that, hey, you know, gonna have to drop support for Ubuntu.

568
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:57,800
This just wrecks gaming.

569
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:58,800
We're out.

570
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:04,840
Not necessarily a Valve position, but this staffer's position who's responsible and part

571
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:05,840
of the team.

572
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:07,800
So he likely has pretty big input or maybe not.

573
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:09,240
Maybe he even has, who knows.

574
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:11,980
But it's not an official Valve communication.

575
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:15,600
But from that tweet, the internet sort of erupted as it does.

576
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:18,600
Like half a dozen articles went live in a matter of hours.

577
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:22,440
A change.org petition was created to force.

578
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:23,440
That's the real sign, right?

579
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:24,440
Yeah.

580
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:27,520
Demand that Ubuntu include 32-bit support.

581
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:34,600
And Canonical responded, you know, considering that this thing broke Saturday morning, their

582
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:35,600
time.

583
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:38,880
They responded by Sunday morning, my time, which is Pacific.

584
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:41,360
So that's a decent turnaround, right?

585
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:43,600
The internet was not satisfied.

586
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:47,880
Once the primary thing they were upset about had been solved, they now had to continue

587
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:49,200
to justify the outrage.

588
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:51,840
Well, once you're spun up, you're just all in the huff.

589
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:54,520
And you need to, you know, there has to be rationale.

590
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:56,520
There has to be rationale.

591
00:24:56,520 --> 00:25:01,100
And so the message changed to, well, you didn't communicate it properly.

592
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:08,060
This broke on a Friday, US time, and it took you until Sunday to say anything.

593
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:10,000
Like why aren't you working 24-7?

594
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,120
You're a multinational company with hundreds of employees.

595
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:17,840
Why don't you have, this is quote, why don't you have decision makers working 24-7?

596
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:20,200
To handle these things, end quote.

597
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:25,160
And I saw a variation of that every couple of hours all weekend long, including up until

598
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:26,800
as we went on air right now.

599
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:28,960
To handle Twitter rage?

600
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:29,960
That's no.

601
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:30,960
Right.

602
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:31,960
Yes.

603
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:34,480
That is the expectation.

604
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:36,900
Why aren't you here answering us?

605
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:42,720
And it builds so fast, like multiple articles get posted, mobs form on Twitter.

606
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:45,040
I mean, we watched this as a crew.

607
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:46,640
We were all kind of, it was really kind of neat.

608
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,520
We were monitoring all these various sources.

609
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:52,040
And so we were really watching this thing from a complete 360 degrees.

610
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:59,080
And it was fascinating to watch these mobs form and these different posts would go alive.

611
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:02,880
And then you would see the, you would just see like a big spike in the social media reaction

612
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:03,880
and the comments.

613
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:04,880
Right.

614
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:10,640
You had different people follow different outlets and they're suddenly, what's happening?

615
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:15,360
And it was all kind of like, even if say, just for the sake of this entire kerfuffle,

616
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:18,440
say canonical stuck to their guns and said, nope, dropped.

617
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:21,720
We're going the route of Catalina in Ubuntu 1910.

618
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:24,200
We are not going to maintain the I-36 architecture.

619
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:25,200
We're done.

620
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:28,760
Now we'll still maintain it for years in 1804 and 1604.

621
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:33,440
So you could probably just grab it from there or grab a PPA or a snap or a flat.

622
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:36,780
Like there was always going to be a solution to this problem.

623
00:26:36,780 --> 00:26:41,120
It was never going to be a disaster, but it went to 11.

624
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:46,280
And then what I thought was fascinating is this demand of an immediate response.

625
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:49,960
And it really enforces this culture we have now entered where if you have a job that's

626
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:53,200
on the internet, you work 24 seven.

627
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:59,180
And we're, we, it happens to us here, um, part because it's, it's both hobby and profession,

628
00:26:59,180 --> 00:27:02,560
but it really is like we have people all over the world.

629
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:04,480
Joe is essentially shifted to our time zone.

630
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:07,960
Like it's really, it really is a big problem.

631
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:12,760
And it, it is a massive contributor to burnout, a significant contributor burnout.

632
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:14,040
That's where I wanted to get your thoughts, Mike.

633
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:15,040
Yeah.

634
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:16,040
I mean, so there's a couple of things here.

635
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:22,400
Like one, I, maybe I'm just confused, but my understanding is like, this is actually

636
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:23,680
not that big of a deal.

637
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:26,260
No, this particular example is not, no, right.

638
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:31,560
The technical problem here is, is again solved with the PPA, but, and I think the Linux action

639
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:33,600
use coverage was much deeper and better.

640
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:36,520
And if you're curious listener go there.

641
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:41,840
Um, but yeah, I mean, we get this all, I get this all the time, uh, Chris and I have, uh,

642
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:48,640
Kovacs on many a Slack conversation about just constant, like basically death marching,

643
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:49,640
right?

644
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:52,680
Um, and I have to tell you, Chris, these are my experience.

645
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:55,520
People generally don't appreciate it.

646
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:59,960
Even if you do pull the all nighter to get that build out or, you know, in the case of

647
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:05,680
kind of the Twitter rage stuff, I've had people tweet a question to me and I didn't respond

648
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:11,720
in an hour because I was like, you know, doing my job and get like three, three follow on

649
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:12,720
tweets, right.

650
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:13,720
Or like emails.

651
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:19,680
It's just, the expectations have gotten crazy from, I remember way back when in my time

652
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:25,740
machine before like social media and Twitter, you would send someone an email and they might

653
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:27,820
not reply until the next business day.

654
00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:30,040
And that was totally normal.

655
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:31,040
It's interesting to me, right?

656
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:32,700
Because it is, I mean, he kind of speaks to it there.

657
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:38,280
It's all about expectations and we're just so bad at being explicit about that and managing

658
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:39,280
them.

659
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:42,680
And once you've got these devices always on with you, you can check all the time.

660
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:43,680
We're just not good at it.

661
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:44,680
I think that's a bit of it.

662
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:45,680
Yeah.

663
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:50,600
It's definitely like, it's hard to set firm boundaries about like, Hey, uh, 7 p.m. till

664
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:52,600
morning is my family time.

665
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:57,520
That's not, that's a hard thing to not, especially as a man, because it seems sort of like not

666
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:59,280
a common thing to ask for.

667
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:04,320
Like, and the challenge here is the whole team knows we all have smartphones that your

668
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:05,320
boss knows.

669
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:06,320
You got a smartphone.

670
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:09,880
Like everybody knows you've got an always on device that's getting these notifications.

671
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:13,120
So if you're not reading it, you're opting not to read it.

672
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:15,160
And some bosses don't respond very well to that.

673
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:18,160
There are other situations where that's not, there's cultures where that's not acceptable.

674
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:20,160
And I think it's really common.

675
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:26,880
It's interesting though, um, from the Reddit co-founders comments here, particularly about

676
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:31,520
the, uh, there's one line that I put out in her doc, all of us who decide to start a company

677
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:37,720
were kind of broken as people, which, wow, a little obsessed might be, yeah, you could,

678
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:39,640
another way to put it is you're a little obsessed with something.

679
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:41,420
I mean, I think you know this too, right?

680
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:45,880
You're driving forward and forward and forward and your competition is not standing still.

681
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:46,880
Yeah.

682
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:47,880
There's competition.

683
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:51,340
There's also, um, just general adapting to the market constantly, especially when you're

684
00:29:51,340 --> 00:29:53,480
dealing with a business that's online.

685
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:57,760
It's incredible how fast things change now, especially for the podcast market.

686
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:59,040
Podcasts are just growing like crazy.

687
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:01,800
Well, there's that new one where you have to subscribe, right?

688
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:05,320
And they've got like Bethany McClain, like there's some crazy stuff going on in the podcasting

689
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:06,320
world.

690
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:09,640
Oh, you're going to get all kinds of things, especially with Spotify and Kimlet and a lot

691
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:10,640
going on there.

692
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:13,160
There's going to, there's going to be subscriptions and premium content.

693
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:14,480
It's going to be just like Netflix.

694
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:15,480
It's.

695
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:16,480
Everyone wants a slice.

696
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:17,480
Oh, that's not happening for us.

697
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:18,800
We're always going to be free.

698
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:20,520
The feeds always going to be easy to find.

699
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:21,960
That's going to be our thing.

700
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:30,600
But, um, I have not learned my lesson here and this is really hard for me to admit because

701
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:32,200
this is super serious.

702
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:37,040
It is literally like something, if I don't figure out, I'm eventually going to kill myself.

703
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:40,240
And it's really humbling to admit that I'm too dumb to figure it out.

704
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:48,160
Like I just, I'm just getting over another physical ailment that knocked me on my ass

705
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:49,700
again.

706
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:54,860
And it ironically affected me exactly in the way that the recovery of the last one did

707
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:59,680
where my, my range of motion is limited.

708
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:01,000
I can't get out of bed.

709
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,320
I can't lift the children.

710
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:03,480
I can't pick heavy up.

711
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:05,680
I can't pick, pick up heavy objects.

712
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:07,400
That's like, that's living your life right there.

713
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:08,400
Right?

714
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:09,400
Yeah.

715
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:11,680
And it was exactly the same thing when I was recovering from the ruptured appendix and

716
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:15,740
it's something happens and I don't take the warning signs and I just assume it's going

717
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:16,740
to be okay.

718
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:22,200
And I just keep pushing forward and even, even when I know, okay, this is your off ramp

719
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:23,200
right here.

720
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:24,200
I don't take it.

721
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:31,640
And I keep going until I'm, until I am physically impaired, until I, until some sort of physical,

722
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:32,680
I just won't stop.

723
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:37,280
I will just keep taking it on more stress and more things until some sort of physical

724
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:38,280
ailment.

725
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:39,280
You're forced.

726
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:41,320
I mean, no choice but to stop.

727
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:42,320
Yeah.

728
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:43,320
It's the hard wall.

729
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:45,240
That's how, I mean, you just kind of kill yourself doing that.

730
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:50,480
And I thought when I ended up in the hospital last September and I spent a hospital bill

731
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:56,500
of $200,000 and seven days in the hospital, I thought, okay, well I guess I finally learned

732
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:57,500
my lesson.

733
00:31:57,500 --> 00:31:58,500
I had to learn it the hard way.

734
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:05,060
And then here I am again and I just, I just can't believe, I can't believe I let myself

735
00:32:05,060 --> 00:32:06,060
do it again.

736
00:32:06,060 --> 00:32:07,600
I wonder if part of, have you been conditioned?

737
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:08,740
I mean before, right?

738
00:32:08,740 --> 00:32:13,400
You were running and managing this whole business and so it was, I mean, just seeing you at

739
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:15,960
that time, it was, you were never off, right?

740
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:18,600
You had stuff to think about and worry and shows to plan and you couldn't stop.

741
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:19,800
You needed to keep going.

742
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:24,200
I think it's also, I think it's a symptom of I haven't fully built like a lever I can

743
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:27,560
pull where I can just be like, hey guys, I'm out for like five days and everything just

744
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:28,560
continues.

745
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:31,260
Because there's a few shows that's like, okay, well now we have to kind of scramble to figure

746
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:35,240
out how to get content for and stuff like that that I'm still producing, like LUP, it's

747
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:38,520
because it's kind of like the main show I do now.

748
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:41,240
And if I'm gone, like how do you, what do we do with that?

749
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:42,240
We don't have a solution.

750
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,240
We still haven't figured that out.

751
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:50,840
And I, there's other things, there's just other, I have other responsibilities now.

752
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:51,840
It's a challenge.

753
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:52,840
It's a real challenge.

754
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:56,960
And I don't know what I'm going to, I just, I've got to learn this lesson.

755
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:58,640
So learn from my mistakes, people.

756
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:04,280
I think too, it's like we're subject to the fact that there's a lot of people who are

757
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:06,240
sort of posturing online.

758
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:11,360
They'll posture as this, and Ohanian touches on this too, they'll posture on all these

759
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:16,260
things that glorify absurd things like, Oh, I'm, you know, I'm, I stay up, I stay awake

760
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:17,960
at night worrying about this particular problem.

761
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:21,560
You'll hear government officials say that all the time, or you'll hear about people

762
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:23,880
that are burning the candle at both ends and they're proud of it.

763
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:26,780
Like I got this out because I don't sleep, you know, like I don't sleep.

764
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:30,120
That's such a, you know, a line of pride for so many people.

765
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:34,120
And the irony is, is like, it's such a short term game and I am learning that so hard now

766
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:38,980
as I get to my mid to late thirties, I'm learning that like, yeah, it really is true.

767
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:42,580
Like there is a limited time you can just cash that check against your body.

768
00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:45,480
And it re like that debt really does come due.

769
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:51,260
And the fact that our culture glorifies this posturing about staying up all night and under

770
00:33:51,260 --> 00:33:57,540
place things like self awareness and self care and nutrition is the real problem here.

771
00:33:57,540 --> 00:34:01,680
And I don't see it changing anytime soon unless somebody gets on the microphone and says,

772
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:05,760
this is a real thing that as somebody who didn't pay attention to this is now at the

773
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:08,000
other end of it saying, you better pay attention to this stuff.

774
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,000
Yeah, the same thing.

775
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:13,160
I mean, you remember Chris, we were doing the show, um, four years ago in 2015 I took

776
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:15,600
a heart attack from this, right?

777
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:21,880
And so this is like, I'm currently got some sort of sickness, but like sinus infection

778
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:27,600
of some weird kind, but still working 14 hours a day cause yeah, it's at some point I think

779
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:34,200
it's almost like becomes like a crazy addiction of like, you feel like you can't stop because

780
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:40,880
if you stop, you know, you, first of all, I think it's easy to set up bad expectations

781
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:47,040
with like customers and in your case, audiences, um, you know, clients, things like that where

782
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:51,920
it's, you know, sometimes things are just going to be late, right?

783
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:55,120
Sometimes you don't need to have three status meetings in a week.

784
00:34:55,120 --> 00:35:01,840
Um, I don't know, I, I constantly go back to, uh, bell labs invented Unix and the C

785
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:06,980
programming language working nine to five with generous martini lunches, right?

786
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:10,680
And somehow we can't build stupid little mobile apps without killing ourselves.

787
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:11,680
Right.

788
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:14,160
And we don't even pay attention to the science, right?

789
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:16,960
It's the culture and the surface level appearances.

790
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:21,280
Even when, you know, there's plenty of, plenty of good science and reasoning to suggest that

791
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:24,720
we should manage ourselves a little better than that and play for the long haul, right?

792
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:28,360
So you can be more productive, get more done instead of being constantly burnt out and

793
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:31,960
slow because you haven't slept and can't think straight.

794
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:32,960
Yeah.

795
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:33,960
Yeah.

796
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:34,960
Yeah.

797
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:35,960
It's funny.

798
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:36,960
I really think so much better.

799
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:42,200
I, uh, I was doing some projects over the weekend and, uh, I've, I've probably set up

800
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:48,920
a mount in FS tab a thousand times, but they, all three kids were in my office and they

801
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:50,320
were all making different noises.

802
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:51,320
They weren't even really talking.

803
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:54,240
They were just making noises and their iPads were making noises.

804
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:57,680
It took me 15 minutes to like figure out what I was doing wrong.

805
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:01,800
I had to read this line a dozen times and then they, I finally said, Hey guys, would

806
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:03,320
you mind playing in the other room for a minute?

807
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:07,160
And when they left and it got quiet and I closed my eyes and I, and I look at it again.

808
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:08,160
Oh geez.

809
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:09,160
Really?

810
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:10,160
God, this is it.

811
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:11,160
Tossed down into that folder.

812
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:12,160
It's one folder up.

813
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:13,160
So stupid, Chris.

814
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:14,160
Yeah.

815
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:17,080
It really, I'm like, I have a totally different brain capacity sometimes and sleep plays a

816
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:18,080
big part.

817
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:19,080
Rest.

818
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:22,720
I was just talking with our buddy Alex, uh, who's often on the Friday stream and makes

819
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:23,720
it unplugged.

820
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:27,540
He's an employee at Red Hat and, uh, as part of that, you know, they get a little vacay

821
00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:32,280
and he took it and he just got done doing a road trip, um, through like a Yellowstone

822
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:33,280
and whatnot.

823
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:38,800
And he said to me that, uh, about, uh, about three or four days into being there where

824
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:39,800
they didn't have any connectivity.

825
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:44,440
And he was just genuinely disconnected from work, um, that he started sleeping better.

826
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:45,440
Right.

827
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:46,440
Takes a couple of days.

828
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:48,640
You gotta really get out of the habit once you realize, well, I can't, there's no point

829
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:50,960
pulling my phone out cause I can't check anything.

830
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:51,960
Yeah.

831
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:55,640
He also said he was more focused and, uh, felt a little more creative when editing photos

832
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:59,520
because he just sort of, not only was the lack of distractions, but it was like the

833
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:04,080
accumulative effect of multiple days of lack of distraction and stress.

834
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:05,080
Sounds like a fun experiment.

835
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:10,400
But meetup is, uh, meetup, meetup.com slash Jupiter broadcasting is, um, if you haven't

836
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:14,600
checked it out, is a page where you set up a bunch of different, uh, study group sessions

837
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:17,760
and one that we have coming up pretty soon is really on point.

838
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:20,520
Meetup.com slash Jupiter broadcasting.

839
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:21,520
Understanding burnout.

840
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:22,520
Yeah.

841
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:24,520
This is going to be, I'm like looking forward to this.

842
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:26,480
And so, uh, when is that?

843
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:30,720
That is tomorrow before a Linux unplugged 1230 PM.

844
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:33,040
So it could be, if you're getting this on a day this came out, it could be like right

845
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:34,040
around there.

846
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:38,800
Meetup.com slash Jupiter broadcasting because we have that and then when we will, and when

847
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:42,200
we do post the video version of it, we'll update that meetup page.

848
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:47,440
So even if you can't make it to the meetup, you could stay up to date by following it.

849
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:52,560
And then down the road, we're going to do a security, um, presentation by, I think it's

850
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:53,560
a Symantec employee.

851
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:54,560
Oh yeah.

852
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:56,960
Explaining some of their threat report internet studies.

853
00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:01,320
And then after that we're doing a five part series, at least that's the plan right now

854
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:02,320
on AWS.

855
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:04,400
Oh, there's a lot to cover there.

856
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:05,400
Mm-hmm.

857
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:06,400
Yeah.

858
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:08,720
And we have a really, really, really, really, really sharp individual who's helping us put

859
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:12,000
it together and we're doing some new stuff, new presentation style.

860
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,160
It's really going to be good.

861
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:14,880
We just put it all out there for free.

862
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:17,680
So it might not all go on the channel though, so you'll want to stay tuned for that.

863
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:18,680
Mixing that up.

864
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:19,680
Yeah.

865
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:22,600
But you can get all the past ones over on our regular Jupiter broadcasting channel.

866
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:23,600
Yes.

867
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:26,720
I feel like though, the one thing that's a little different about this whole go round

868
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:32,080
that is, I feel like the silver lining of my most recent like issues is I'm much more

869
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:36,440
aware of the process and I'm able to keep tabs and I'm like, oh, now I'm at this level

870
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:37,560
and I'm not freaking out about it.

871
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:40,480
I'm not strutting, but I'm like, oh yeah, I'm getting, I'm doing this again.

872
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:43,920
Like I'm, I'm just, um, I'm staying, uh, what's, what would he call it?

873
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:46,200
Um, you know, I'm just staying observant really.

874
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:47,200
Yeah.

875
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:48,200
You're aware of what you're thinking.

876
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:49,200
Sure.

877
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:51,040
You're, you know, you're not going to fix everything straight away, but you're at least thinking

878
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:52,640
about and you're aware that this could happen.

879
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:56,880
I feel like it's a form of mindfulness that sort of reduces the stress of it a little

880
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:57,880
bit.

881
00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:02,920
So, and I like, I feel like because I've been through this, I kind of have a plan to off

882
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:04,120
ramp.

883
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:07,520
Next week I'm going to go on a road trip from Texas to Washington and I think that'll be

884
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:09,000
a nice chance to unwind.

885
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,000
I won't do any shows.

886
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,120
I'll just, me and the lady will drive across country.

887
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:14,600
It'll be a, it'll be a fast, hard drive.

888
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:15,600
Open road.

889
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:16,600
Yeah.

890
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:17,600
Something a little different.

891
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:18,600
Oh, that sounds great.

892
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:21,200
I'll just either drive with the windows down, I think it'll be fine.

893
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:22,200
So I'll be, I'll be all right.

894
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:26,120
See, I like, I've planned my off ramps, like I know myself now and I think I know how to

895
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:30,920
correct it before it becomes major bad, but I, uh, I let it go for too long.

896
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:31,920
It's easy to do.

897
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:33,680
I mean, there's a lot to do and it's, I mean, I think it's especially hard when you care

898
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:35,320
about what you do, right?

899
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:38,800
Because you're, you're extra driven and you can't, can't turn it off.

900
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:39,800
Yeah.

901
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:40,800
That's true.

902
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:41,800
You don't, it doesn't turn off.

903
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:42,800
It don't turn off.

904
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:43,800
Do you have any, any tips, Mike?

905
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:46,920
When you, when you need to find your off ramp or do you do any, um, communicating around,

906
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:50,920
you know, communication expectations or any of that with people you work with?

907
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:51,920
Yeah.

908
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:58,560
I try to like, well, I'm trying now to run a better processes that basically don't have

909
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:03,440
hard dates that are going to be impossible, particularly when you have dependencies on

910
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:06,920
either other vendors or, you know, the customer.

911
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:07,920
That's a big deal.

912
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:08,920
Right.

913
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:09,920
Steph, that's kind of out of your control.

914
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:14,560
Any listeners who are feeling burned out and want to offload some.net or mobile development,

915
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:15,560
call the mad botter.

916
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:16,560
Hey, what's the best way for them?

917
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:17,560
What's the best way for them to reach you?

918
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:20,640
Uh, go to the mad botter.com.

919
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:21,640
That could be a great way.

920
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:24,640
If somebody is struggling with a project, why not hire Mike and his team to do it?

921
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:25,640
Yeah, let Mike do it.

922
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:26,920
They know what they're doing.

923
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:27,920
And if you love F-sharp.

924
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:28,920
Yeah.

925
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:29,920
Oh, what now?

926
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:34,140
All the latest and greatest functional techniques to make sure you get your project quickly

927
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:36,120
and probably on time.

928
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:40,120
If you're looking for just a good time, by the way, call one, no, I'm serious.

929
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:42,200
No, actually, no, check out the Friday stream.

930
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:43,200
I thought it was one nine.

931
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:45,060
No, it is now.

932
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:46,240
Check out the Friday stream.

933
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:47,920
Friday stream.com.

934
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:51,200
The one good thing about Mondays is the Friday stream is published.

935
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:55,960
We stream it live on Fridays, except for this Friday, and then we publish it on Mondays.

936
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:58,400
And you, you went up against Drew, wasn't it?

937
00:40:58,400 --> 00:40:59,400
Oh, yeah.

938
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:00,400
Drew and I.

939
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:02,080
To compete for a game for an audience member.

940
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:06,320
And I don't want to say who won, but let's just say there's a lot on the line.

941
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:07,320
There was a lot on the line.

942
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:08,320
Oh, man.

943
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:09,320
West had lost a previous one.

944
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:10,320
Ooh.

945
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:12,040
I had my honor and self-respect on the line.

946
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:13,040
Yeah.

947
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:16,120
And if you're looking for a new gig, maybe where you're working at right now is burning

948
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:17,120
you out.

949
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:18,320
Linux Academy is hiring.

950
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:23,080
You can go to jobs.lever.co slash Linux Academy or just go to linuxacademy.com and they got

951
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:24,320
a careers link way down on the bottom of the page.

952
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:25,880
And we'll have it on the show notes, too.

953
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:26,880
That's true.

954
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:27,880
We'll have a link in the show notes.

955
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:28,880
Great pay, benefits.

956
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:29,880
You get to work remotely.

957
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:30,880
And you get to hang out with us.

958
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:34,340
Like we're, at the end of this week, we're going to a big old company event.

959
00:41:34,340 --> 00:41:35,340
Come hang out with West and I.

960
00:41:35,340 --> 00:41:36,340
Yeah, that's right.

961
00:41:36,340 --> 00:41:40,320
And, I mean, you know, you get to work on a pretty cool platform that helps people learn

962
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:41,320
stuff.

963
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:42,320
That's true.

964
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:43,320
There are worse things to do.

965
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:44,320
Yeah.

966
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:45,320
And it's a, it's a cool platform, too.

967
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:46,320
You get to hang out.

968
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:47,720
That's over in the show notes, as West pointed out.

969
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:48,720
Oh, yeah.

970
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:53,480
And, well, if you want more Coder Radio, we've got the whole backlog, coder.show.

971
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:58,860
You can find this particular episode, number 363, right there, too, and all the rest.

972
00:41:58,860 --> 00:42:04,040
You want a whole bunch of other great shows, some of them, with Chris, well, jupiterbroadcasting.com

973
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:10,200
has all of that and links to just about everything else, including the calendar page.

974
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:12,480
That's where you can find out when we're here live.

975
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:16,960
We do this show every week, just about 12 p.m. Pacific.

976
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:20,480
And the magic of Google and the internet, well, it'll tell you whatever that is in your

977
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:22,380
time zone of choice.

978
00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:26,640
If that's still not enough content, well, you can also find us on Twitter.

979
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:27,640
I'm at Westpane.

980
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:28,640
Mike, you're?

981
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:29,640
At Dubinuko.

982
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:30,640
And Chris?

983
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:31,640
I'm at ChrisLAS.

984
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:33,480
Yes, you are.

985
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:37,820
We've also got a network account at Jupiter Signal.

986
00:42:37,820 --> 00:42:39,180
Thank you all for joining us.

987
00:42:39,180 --> 00:43:08,240
Come join us here live next week.
