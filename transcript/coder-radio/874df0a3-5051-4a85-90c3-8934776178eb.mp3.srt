00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,760
This is Coda Radio, episode 429 for August 30, 2021.

2
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:18,740
Hello friends and welcome back to Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show, taking a

3
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:24,040
pragmatic look at the art and the business of software development and the world of technology.

4
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:26,380
This episode is brought to you by Cloud Guru.

5
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:29,080
You know, Cloud Guru has the cloud playground.

6
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:35,000
It's Azure, AWS, and Google's cloud on their sandbox, on their credit card, not yours.

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,340
Get certified, get hired, get learning at a cloudguru.com.

8
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:44,400
My name is Chris and joining us like the podcast pro that he is, it is our host indeed, Mr.

9
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:45,400
Dominic.

10
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:46,400
Hello, Mike.

11
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:47,400
What is up, Mr. Fajah?

12
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:51,000
Oh, you know, on the road again, on the road.

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,360
This time I'm in Arizona in like the northern east area of the state trying to stay somewhere

14
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:57,360
where there's shade.

15
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:58,360
Yes.

16
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:03,000
Where I'm going, it's 106 degrees today and I just figured I'm going to wait it out as

17
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,960
long as possible up north and then pounce.

18
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:10,960
So the dumb thing that I'm doing is I'm recording a bunch of my shows today.

19
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:14,760
This is the first one and then I'm just recording for like the rest of the day.

20
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:18,840
The tricky bit is, is we did all the research ahead of time and everybody said the signal

21
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:23,240
was fine and I ended up here in Show Low Arizona and there seems to be some sort of cellular

22
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:27,600
vortex here that just is where cellular devices go to die.

23
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:31,920
Like two out of my four devices are just not working, even with the same carriers.

24
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:37,500
And what does work is, oh, abysmal, abysmal.

25
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:41,600
But it is nice to be here because we're at a golf course, the Bison Golf Club, and it's

26
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:42,960
gorgeous.

27
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:48,560
It is such a cool spot and it's nice to be somewhere that looks built up because since

28
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:55,040
I left Colorado and drove through New Mexico and the western northern area of Arizona,

29
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:58,000
it's like Mad Max land out there, dude.

30
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,040
Stuff has completely collapsed.

31
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:02,160
Buildings are just abandoned.

32
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:06,960
There's teams or groups of people that are like roving homeless people that are caravaning

33
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,960
around out there.

34
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,720
People are fighting over water and fuel.

35
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:14,640
It is legitimately Mad Max out there right now.

36
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,640
Nobody's talking about this.

37
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:21,640
In fact, I thought I should like get my camera out and start capturing some of this because

38
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:22,640
it's wild.

39
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:26,040
If you're not familiar with Mad Max, it's a series of movies that follow the adventures

40
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:28,320
of Max, who's a police officer.

41
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:32,800
It's in the future Australia where they're experiencing societal collapse due to water

42
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:38,120
and other critical resource shortages like fuel, you know, just just the luxury items.

43
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,960
Yeah, you know, just the luxuries.

44
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:40,960
Wow.

45
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:46,360
So you go through that for a couple of days and then you roll into like civilization where

46
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:52,200
there's people with nice cars and nice and water and playing golf.

47
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,560
And it's like none of that's even going on.

48
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:57,080
It's it's it's a crazy disconnect.

49
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:59,560
And I I don't know what to make of it.

50
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:03,560
You know, I always look at that stuff in the lens of like, how does that affect my business?

51
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,960
What impact can I have there?

52
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:07,800
I don't have any of those answers.

53
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,960
So just those observations.

54
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:12,400
But yeah, you know, feels like we're living in Mad Max.

55
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,400
It just wild.

56
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:16,120
And if you haven't seen it, it's a fun movie series.

57
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,120
Get you thinking.

58
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:21,400
Why don't we do a little bit of feedback, though, while my connection holds, who knows

59
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,400
how much longer.

60
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:27,240
Thank you, everybody, who goes over to coder dot show slash contact, by the way, and leaves

61
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,320
us a little bit of feedback.

62
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:30,040
We do appreciate that.

63
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:34,760
Now there was an email that came into the show about junior dev jobs going away.

64
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:38,320
And the writer writes in essentially saying, although it's not loading for me because my

65
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:42,260
connection is so horrible, that when he's gone around and done interview for a junior

66
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:46,460
dev position, it seems like what they really want is somebody with quite a bit of experience.

67
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:50,160
He says here and outloaded, I've mostly been working in smaller businesses.

68
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:54,720
And now when I've gone out and explored, it seems like they have expectations that would

69
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:57,800
really be more like somebody who's a senior developer.

70
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:00,160
He said, I've had a lot of junior roles since then.

71
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:03,240
And I felt like they don't actually really want junior.

72
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:07,000
They want somebody who's just a cheap mid range developer, and they're labeling it as

73
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,640
a junior developer.

74
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,480
Are the junior developer jobs disappearing?

75
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:13,920
I'd love to hear your thoughts and any advice if possible.

76
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:19,680
His point about labeling a position they basically want to just milk for additional work and

77
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,000
pay less kind of did resonate with me.

78
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Did it?

79
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Okay.

80
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,840
So I would be curious about your take first things I think I'm going to have the exact

81
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:28,000
opposite take.

82
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:34,360
I have seen companies that will claim they want something that just is absurdly over

83
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:38,000
the top as an expectation for an entry level position.

84
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,500
You know, five years with technology X when it's only been out for three years, like those

85
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:43,080
are real problems.

86
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:47,520
But I've also seen companies kind of use this as a well, this is a starting position.

87
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,880
And if you work a little extra harder and do these extra things, you know, will promote

88
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:55,000
you to the next tier when really, that's just ends up being the entire job as you take on

89
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,520
a bunch of extra responsibilities that you should have just been getting paid for from

90
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,520
the beginning.

91
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:04,680
Okay, so I am actually currently hiring for a junior Python dev plug, plug, plug.

92
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:10,120
And I've been hiring for junior devs on and off for I don't know, a long time, right?

93
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:15,800
I can tell you from the other side that this is going to be spicy.

94
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:21,040
Things have changed, but I would say they've changed in what the junior devs are expecting

95
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:29,960
life to be like is not so realistic, or I'm gonna put this more than they would have ever

96
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:34,640
dreamed to expect in let's say, 2014, you know, 2012, whatever.

97
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:41,280
For instance, wages for junior devs have in general gone up, but the productivity has

98
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,280
not.

99
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:43,280
Right?

100
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,520
So that's problematic.

101
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:49,880
There has been quite the emphasis on more of like a mentorship and training, which is

102
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:50,880
all great.

103
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:51,880
I'm not against that.

104
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:55,000
I've done more than my share.

105
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,320
The challenge is, you know, to hire anybody, you're not a school, you're not a charity.

106
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:03,520
It does have to ultimately be profitable.

107
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:10,000
And given the risk of a junior developer blowing something up, it has to be significantly profitable.

108
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:15,320
I would kind of push back on this and say, well, what is a fair salary for someone with

109
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:24,160
little to no experience, who's entry level, and the value return has to be, you know,

110
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,200
some multiple of that salary, right?

111
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:28,720
It can't be like they're just barely profitable.

112
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:33,160
I mean, I understand that larger organizations do sometimes have schemes like that, where

113
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:35,200
they put you in like a multi-year training program.

114
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:38,160
Although I think those are even going away.

115
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:42,980
But from my perspective, you know, as a small business owner who owns a dev shop, junior

116
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:45,960
devs come with just a ton of risk.

117
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:48,560
They are the most likely people to blow up your stuff.

118
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:53,480
They're the most likely people to need just tremendous handholding.

119
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,920
And yeah, it's pretty simple.

120
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:58,560
The more you pay someone, the more you expect.

121
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:03,760
And right now with the kind of base wage for junior dev being higher than it's in general,

122
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:08,200
right, this, of course, this will be regional and there'll be technology differences, but

123
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:13,280
with it being quite a bit higher than it ever was before, at least from my perspective,

124
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,440
the expectations are indeed higher.

125
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:19,120
Now, I don't look for the years of experience stuff, but I do expect junior devs to be able

126
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:24,560
to actually do development and frankly, to be willing to do the work that nobody else

127
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,560
wants to do, right?

128
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:33,000
The documentation, the QA, the, you know what, fix this bug, it's crunch time, it's an emergency.

129
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I don't know.

130
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I know that's unpopular.

131
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,800
I know there's definitely a move away from that now.

132
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:40,080
I've seen people write in recommending, like listener Dane wrote it and said, you know,

133
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:43,040
don't have junior developers do documentation.

134
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:46,700
Keep them in code all the time and actually have the senior developers do documentation

135
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:48,320
and data gathering tasks.

136
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:49,480
I could see that argument.

137
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:51,840
I think I see it from your perspective pretty clearly.

138
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:57,640
And for a, for a development shop your size, it feels like there is a role for junior developers

139
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:01,600
and like you're acknowledging, yeah, there's also a risk for my business and we're willing

140
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:05,440
to take that on if we can work with somebody that seems like the right fit.

141
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,120
And he's hiring, plug, plug.

142
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:12,640
But I also can see from the, from the emailers perspective, like there are large corporations

143
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:18,920
that don't, don't really understand the nuance that you just laid out there.

144
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:22,540
And they just kind of label junior as a way to say cheap.

145
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:25,160
Those are two separate issues now that you've laid it out like that.

146
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:29,180
Dane wrote in, cause this is all part of the transitioning from developer to manager conversation

147
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:31,260
we've been having for the last couple episodes.

148
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:36,920
He went on to say that senior engineers want to be given a problem, requirements, limitations,

149
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:40,000
et cetera, but not told how to solve it.

150
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,800
This might be challenging for a manager coming from an engineering background.

151
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:46,100
Lead by asking questions, Dane writes.

152
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:49,880
Even if you know the answer, look for upcoming blockers.

153
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:53,920
Get the engineer to think several steps ahead to help them identify blockers and remove

154
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,960
those blockers well in advance.

155
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:59,520
He says, yeah, there's even very senior engineers.

156
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:03,200
They should probably still be led with questions, but just a different set of questions.

157
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,560
How can this work be shared across multiple teammates?

158
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:09,460
You know, what kind of tasks support the engineers and that kind of stuff.

159
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:12,920
But Dane says, there's a lot more to share, but I don't want to give you a novel.

160
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,120
He did write in a pretty good email.

161
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:17,560
He says also I'm an all shows feed subscriber.

162
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:19,520
I'd love to see that.

163
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:21,040
And I think you've nailed it though.

164
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:24,080
Like you just clearly outlined the junior dev position.

165
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:29,280
And I think people that are applying for a junior dev position should have those expectations.

166
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:34,240
You should kind of be on board with what Mike just said, because it is a risk for the business

167
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,400
as well.

168
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:39,160
And there's generally a lower set of skill sets that you're coming with and that kind

169
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:40,160
of stuff.

170
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,520
So there is a trade off.

171
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:44,680
Asish writes in on the Intel conversation.

172
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:47,120
I guess we've been talking about Intel and M1 a lot.

173
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,120
Who knew?

174
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:51,000
He says, I don't think Intel is going anywhere anytime soon.

175
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,800
And I think he thinks we haven't really given this enough attention.

176
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:58,320
He says Intel is the only top to bottom silicon designer and manufacturer.

177
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:02,240
There's obvious applications such as, you know, use in the DOD.

178
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,240
But it doesn't stop there.

179
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:05,040
You could see all kinds of uses for that.

180
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:09,240
Other companies are reliant on parts of the market that can implode unexpectedly.

181
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:13,200
And because they're so niche, they're physically isolated at the same time.

182
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:16,760
Nations have taken some notes on the consequences in the past couple of years.

183
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:21,640
And it seems folks were forgetting the first fanless MacBooks were Intel.

184
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:23,800
I couldn't even begin to guess, Mike.

185
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:27,360
Intel's got, you know, bare minimum another 40, 50 years.

186
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,360
Do you have a figure in the market?

187
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,360
Yeah, I don't.

188
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,800
I don't think I was saying they're going to go away.

189
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:36,600
They're just not going to be the, quote, best processors for general computers for probably,

190
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:39,520
you know, they won't have another shop for probably five years.

191
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:40,520
I think that's a different conversation.

192
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:41,520
Right.

193
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:42,520
Isn't Intel ever going to file Chapter 11?

194
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:43,520
No.

195
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:44,520
Right.

196
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:45,520
Of course not.

197
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:46,520
No.

198
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,640
And Mike and I are speaking mostly in the context of workstations, you know, developer

199
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:51,640
workstations and production workstations.

200
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:57,280
And also we're frequently thinking about in context of mobile.

201
00:10:57,280 --> 00:11:01,560
And that, I think, is where we see Intel being challenged.

202
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:07,640
I can't even describe the number of emails that we have gotten from people that have

203
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:12,560
said, yeah, I just wanted a really lightweight, very fast, quiet laptop.

204
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,120
And I've gotten that sentiment at the meetups, too.

205
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:17,120
And it's not like it's just this universal thing.

206
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,160
It's not 100 percent of people.

207
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:25,840
But I think there's a lot of people in the communities that our shows appeal to that

208
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:29,080
are driven by sort of the latest and greatest tech.

209
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:32,720
Like there's a part of them that if they have a little bit of disposable income, that latest

210
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,560
and greatest tech is at least fun to tinker with.

211
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:39,660
It doesn't mean they don't also like something like the framework that really is pro right

212
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:40,660
to repair.

213
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:44,640
It just means they're technologically curious, I would say.

214
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:51,400
I've had a lot of really good conversations with several of the small micro meetups that

215
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:58,800
we have done, have been with Koda radio listeners who, you know, just one guy, one guy, listener

216
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,000
Mike, who is awesome.

217
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:05,720
He gave us an aerial tour of Denver when he was unloading his airplane.

218
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:12,600
He sort of like hung his head and pulled a brand new, still wrapped MacBook Air out and

219
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:13,600
put it down on the ground.

220
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,840
And he's like, listen, guys, I'm still using Linux, too.

221
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,720
And I just had I'm like, Mike, you don't have to explain.

222
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,240
I was like, I just want you to know it's not that I'm just switching to the Mac.

223
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,680
I have Linux as well.

224
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:27,520
I just had to build a project for iOS like, no, we understand.

225
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:28,520
We totally understand.

226
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:30,320
So where have I heard that before?

227
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,320
Hmm.

228
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:33,240
Yeah, I know, right.

229
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:35,040
The road trip for me does continue on.

230
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:38,400
I'm going down to Tucson for some repairs and then back up to Colorado for a bit and

231
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,400
then home.

232
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:43,000
And you can follow the journey at colony tracker dot live.

233
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,120
There is a micro meetup link on there.

234
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:49,200
If you'd like to hit that link and chat with me about tech or something like that, I'd

235
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,640
love to grab a bite or a drink and do just that.

236
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:55,440
So colony tracker dot live and if it works, it doesn't always work, but you'll see me

237
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:59,600
there on the live map and see if I'm in your area and then you can hit that micro meetup

238
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,720
link because wouldn't that be fun?

239
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:02,720
Sit around.

240
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:03,720
You know, we could dish on Mike.

241
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:04,720
It'd be it'd be a blast.

242
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:07,520
It'd be a blast.

243
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:09,240
Leno dot com slash Coder.

244
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:11,160
That's where I have that colony tracker hosted.

245
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:12,400
Go there right now.

246
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:17,480
Leno dot com slash Coder and get one hundred dollars in 60 day credit on a new account.

247
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:20,960
Yeah, they're supporting the show and it's a great way to keep the show going is by supporting

248
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,120
our sponsors.

249
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:25,640
And we just enthusiastically endorse Linode.

250
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:29,680
I get them really, to be honest with you, because they started in 2003 as one of the

251
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:32,880
very first companies in this cloud computing thing.

252
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,640
And now they've been doing it for 18 years.

253
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:35,640
They're still independent.

254
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:38,880
They're just now the largest independent cloud provider.

255
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:43,960
They've got 11 data centers around the world and a million customers and businesses around

256
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,080
the globe.

257
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:48,240
But they've just remained focused on one thing that entire time.

258
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:55,120
And geez, you know, I'm I suppose I'm about 13 years into that for the most part.

259
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:59,000
But I they have they maintain a focus much better than I did initially.

260
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,520
I kind of I kind of went meandered all over the place.

261
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:06,040
It's it's it's tricky when you're a when you're a small business and you see a bunch of other

262
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:07,040
things being tried.

263
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:11,400
I could have seen Linode take their eye off the ball, but they never did.

264
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:16,040
They just kept focusing on making cloud computing simple, affordable and accessible to all.

265
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:19,840
And that means if you've been deploying servers for 20 years, you're going to love Linode.

266
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:22,640
And if this is the first time you've ever done something, but you thought, what a great

267
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:24,360
chance to support the show.

268
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,700
It's going to work for you, too.

269
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:29,800
They've got an app marketplace where you can deploy an entire stack or or even actually

270
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,680
just sort of like the first third of a stack.

271
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:35,840
I don't know what the term for that is, but like one that I love to go to my go to is

272
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:41,680
like a Debian base or now actually CentOS base and just enough stuff to run containers.

273
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:44,840
And then I just take everything from there, right, because that's just a pretty straightforward

274
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:45,840
thing.

275
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:48,200
And Linode's connections are so crazy fast.

276
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:52,080
Plus, they have S3 compatible object storage, and I'll often tie that in with my systems

277
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,080
for lots of storage.

278
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:57,640
They have a powerful DNS manager, Kubernetes support if you're clever and you go that way

279
00:14:57,640 --> 00:15:01,200
as well as Terraform and just so much more.

280
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,860
That's why you really got to go check it out.

281
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:06,800
See that they're 30 to 50 percent cheaper than the big cloud providers out there.

282
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:09,880
You know, they could be part of a multi cloud strategy as well.

283
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:14,720
That's something to consider and a great way to learn, a great way to test something.

284
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,520
That's often a use case for me.

285
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:23,920
So go try it all out and get one hundred dollars for 60 days at Linode dot com slash coder.

286
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:29,240
At the end of last week, a lot of hay was made out of Apple making concessions to settle

287
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:37,120
a developer lawsuit and a ton of press ran with this story is sort of an anti-Apple story.

288
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:43,440
Apple had to concede to developers, but now having a few days into this, I'm not as excited

289
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,960
as the press seem to be.

290
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:48,500
I mean, a few changes have happened in the policies.

291
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:52,280
Developers can now communicate directly about alternative payment methods.

292
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:55,200
But there's more to that story.

293
00:15:55,200 --> 00:16:00,680
Apple agreed to maintain a program it's already doing for more for three more years, and Apple's

294
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:04,880
also setting up a one hundred million dollar fund for small developers.

295
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:11,200
However, ironically, 30 percent of that fund is going to the lawyers that made this case

296
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:13,600
happen.

297
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:20,040
And the company has said that it will issue transparency reports around its app store

298
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:23,160
policies for accepting and rejecting apps.

299
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:24,320
What do you think, Mr. Dominic?

300
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,720
Is this the win we were hoping for?

301
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:31,020
I had an interesting kind of journey with this when I first read it, I misunderstood

302
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:34,880
a key tenet of it, the anti-steering stuff.

303
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:35,880
Right.

304
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:39,240
So I thought it was that you could simply have alternative payment solutions in your

305
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:41,760
app where you could at least link to them.

306
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:42,760
That'd be huge.

307
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:43,760
Right.

308
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:44,760
It's not.

309
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:48,000
You can say that there are alternative payment systems that exist in some amorphous place,

310
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,180
but you may not link to them.

311
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:55,720
So that reminds me of Game of Thrones, but I've seen it where Peter Dinklage's character

312
00:16:55,720 --> 00:17:00,900
tells Queen Daenerys, give them dragonglass because they'll feel like you gave them something

313
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:02,680
and really you gave them nothing.

314
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:04,560
So that's, I think, where we are.

315
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:05,560
Yeah.

316
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:09,480
And if you still sell something in the app, you have to use Apple's payment methods and

317
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:12,240
Apple still gets their cut if you sell it via the app.

318
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:17,480
I think The Verge had a great take on this, where the app store is simply too big of a

319
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:23,360
too significant of a revenue item for Apple to really make any concessions at this juncture.

320
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:28,040
People always talk about Apple PR and Apple marketing, and that's why people buy Apple

321
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:29,040
products.

322
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:30,040
And it's such a miss.

323
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:31,040
Right.

324
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:32,600
That's not why people are dropping thousands of dollars.

325
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:39,920
I mean, brand lure is part of it, but it's this is what Apple marketing is good at.

326
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:46,360
They dropped this story in a way and they fed secret partners at press outlets certain

327
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:52,240
talking points, precisely in a way to get this to land as if this was a loss for Apple

328
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:56,040
to look like they lost that they finally had to eat their humble pie.

329
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:59,960
And you know that this is going to come up in congressional hearings in the future.

330
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:04,840
And the fact that all of these press outlets wrote about it really just kind of actually

331
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:07,240
further will further their case.

332
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:10,400
That kind of stuff comes up all the time in those sort of hearings.

333
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:14,120
And you know, like it's true that small business program is pretty great.

334
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:16,480
That covers like 90 percent of the developers in the app store.

335
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:17,800
I mean, I'm not trying to take away from that.

336
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:20,040
I think that's a good deal.

337
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:23,920
And the fact that you can mention alternative payments and maybe send them to a Web page

338
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:24,920
that has stripe.

339
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:25,920
Nope.

340
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:26,920
No, you can't do that.

341
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:27,920
No.

342
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:28,920
You.

343
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:31,800
So my understanding is you cannot have a button or a link in your app that sends them to the

344
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:34,340
payment processing page.

345
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:38,620
You may mention that if they visit, you know, your Web site, that there might be one somewhere.

346
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:40,240
You may not directly link it.

347
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:43,080
Well, oh, man.

348
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:45,120
Right.

349
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,120
That's a shame.

350
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:47,120
I mean, that's a shame.

351
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:50,840
So like Fortnite could be like, yo, dog, we have a Web site, the books might be cheaper

352
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:56,000
there, but they can't be like click here to go to our, you know, blah, blah, blah portal

353
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,200
and save 10 percent.

354
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,260
Yeah.

355
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:06,240
They also made some concessions that aren't really concessions on the search criteria,

356
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,580
basically saying they won't screw with it much more.

357
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:13,080
So the only other real thing of substance here is they are going to issue a transparency

358
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:14,080
report.

359
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:15,500
Does this hold any weight with you?

360
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:17,520
I don't even know what that would mean.

361
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:21,440
I mean, I think about like their supply chain transparency report that they publish now.

362
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:26,200
So what are they going to say, like apps in these categories made, I don't know, X percent

363
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,960
of revenue versus these?

364
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:31,180
I think it's going to be actually more around what was rejected and why.

365
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:34,320
That seems to be the specific language around it is they're going to issue transparency

366
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:37,660
around the approval and rejection process.

367
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:42,080
It's hard not to hear all of this in the context of.

368
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:46,880
Of the disclosures we just got in the epic lawsuit, like, you know, they have unwritten

369
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:49,240
rules about thou shalt not compete with Apple.

370
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:50,240
Right.

371
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:54,080
Yeah, I don't know, even in the best case, transparency doesn't necessarily mean change

372
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,080
either.

373
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:58,680
I agree, but it does suggest that they might receive pushback.

374
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:02,200
They could they could be under more critical review.

375
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:06,960
But that's assuming they actually are legit in what they publish.

376
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:11,960
The more I review this, Mike, the more this feels like just a surprisingly well executed

377
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:19,040
and very clever PR strategy by Apple to take a unrelated developer lawsuit that nobody's

378
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:23,200
been talking about and make it look like they conceded.

379
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:26,720
And then I'm sure this is going to help them in both their epic lawsuit somehow and also

380
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,040
in congressional hearings.

381
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:30,240
Yeah, I feel like that's exactly what it's going to do.

382
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,240
Right.

383
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:34,340
They get to say they made a preemptive concession and that Apple's made a series now of preemptive

384
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:39,880
concessions with the change in the subscription revenue after a couple after what, a year

385
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:43,100
or two with the small business program they launched last year.

386
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:48,780
And now with these additional quote unquote concessions, they can now actually demonstrate

387
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:53,720
like three or four years in a row of changes in concessions they've been making to, quote

388
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:57,200
unquote, remain competitive in the developer marketplace.

389
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,200
I don't know.

390
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:01,880
It all feels like particularly with the judge in the epic case, I forgot, I think this was

391
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:04,720
a verge again who had the good analysis of it.

392
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:08,920
Basically she seems to be harping on the anti-steering stuff, which is this you can't tell people

393
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:10,400
about other payment options.

394
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,520
By the way, it's the same judge.

395
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:16,200
I almost feel like they're kind of offering this as like, okay, your honor, we hear that

396
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:18,240
you don't like this.

397
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:19,240
How about this?

398
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:22,560
Here's our like, you know, we suggest you order us to do the thing we'll voluntarily

399
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:23,560
do anyway.

400
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:24,560
Right.

401
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:30,560
Very much like the Facebook FCC settlement where, you know, the FCC or was it FCC or

402
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:33,640
FTC, I always get the FCC, right?

403
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:35,760
FCC would be the communications agency.

404
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:36,880
FTC is the trade.

405
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,360
So it's FTC you're thinking of.

406
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:42,620
It was FTC was all excited about the 50 billion or whatever it was, billion dollar fine.

407
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:47,280
And Facebook was like, hey, we won and their stock price went up that day, right?

408
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,280
I don't know.

409
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:51,440
I think this is, uh, you know, I got taken by this a little bit the day it came out.

410
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:52,840
Is it gaslighting?

411
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:54,200
I hate that term gaslighting.

412
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:58,600
I think that's something people say when they're just like, I don't know, I don't want to sound

413
00:21:58,600 --> 00:21:59,600
fancy.

414
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:00,680
What would you describe this as?

415
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:02,140
It's some sort of manipulation.

416
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:06,080
It's a, if they're manipulating the perception of what's happened here, but I don't know

417
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,080
what to call that.

418
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:11,840
I mean, you know, the journalists could have done like a better job here, right?

419
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:13,280
They just didn't.

420
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:18,660
Apple spoon fed this to the industrial press, like the big press outlets that don't really

421
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:20,400
follow the nuance of this stuff.

422
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,400
Business press.

423
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,400
Yeah.

424
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,400
Right.

425
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:24,400
Right.

426
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:28,680
And they like Axios and, and the other outlets in that kind of category, they didn't go to

427
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:33,960
like the tech crunch or the John Gruber's or somebody else out there that knows and

428
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,560
understands these policies.

429
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:40,600
They, they went to people who just would, would run with a kind of big tech bashing

430
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:42,120
story.

431
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:45,800
On the surface, this looks like a massive win for developers.

432
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:47,880
And there are a few nuggets in here.

433
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:51,360
You do get a commitment of the continuation of the small business program, which was probably

434
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:55,520
a foregone conclusion, but now, now Apple's got it in writing.

435
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:59,640
There is at least some improvement around communicating the fact that perhaps there's

436
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:03,040
another way to pay, although it sounds like hardly a win.

437
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:07,880
I think Apple did have some big changes in the works for app store search.

438
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:12,080
So that way they could utilize first party data that they now seem to be the sole provider

439
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:16,020
and collector of with the privacy changes in the recent iOS.

440
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:17,780
And I think that's been put on hold.

441
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:21,960
That's good because I think that was Apple getting creepy with the app store, which I,

442
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:23,820
you know, we don't need to see any more of that.

443
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:28,720
So those types of concessions in here, I think are good because they keep things at least

444
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:34,080
on the, in the right direction, but they're really just guaranteeing things that we already

445
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:38,960
had, which I suppose is better than losing them.

446
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:42,960
But at the end of the day, I think this was, and we're going to see more of these and we're

447
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:47,560
probably going to see something similar, although I bet not as well executed from Google.

448
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:53,800
These are the strategic moves that these large corporations make before they get into a congressional

449
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:54,800
showdown.

450
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:55,800
Yep.

451
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:59,960
And we have seen companies do this over and over and over again in that and the epic lawsuit

452
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:02,180
are truly what this is all about.

453
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:06,160
The benefits now that Apple gets to set this narrative that the press took the bait and

454
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:11,920
ran with it so successfully and now has so many people cover it are just, it was one

455
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:17,000
of the better executed public PR maneuvers we have seen from Apple in the Tim Cook era.

456
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,880
I think this is his primary job, right?

457
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:21,920
Keep, keep the regulators off their back.

458
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:26,020
It's not product development, it's not marketing, it's yeah.

459
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:29,120
Keep the profits going, which means keep services revenue up.

460
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:32,960
All right, well, let's change gears.

461
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:38,720
You got the details up on your election day, Linux desktop contest, and we actually do

462
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:42,600
have some kids in the audience that I think would be interested to know what the deets

463
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:43,600
are.

464
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:44,600
Yeah.

465
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:46,320
So basically you have to be a us high school and medical middle school student.

466
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:47,480
It can be anything.

467
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:53,560
Open source has to be on GitHub related to kind of civics or, you know, helping people

468
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:57,760
find a way to vote or anything really civic civics education, right?

469
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:02,000
Any platform, any language, as long as it's open source on GitHub.

470
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Big differences.

471
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:07,560
We're doing three winners, so that's three Thalios and it closes on election day.

472
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:11,960
We're going to announce the winners on election day, so you can just submit it by clicking

473
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:13,400
the link in the blog post.

474
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:16,260
Man, you're getting three Thalios.

475
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:17,260
Three Thalios.

476
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:22,200
I don't even know how I would get together the funds to purchase one, especially with

477
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:24,560
GPU prices right now.

478
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:27,680
You're a madman, but I guess that is the mad modern way.

479
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:28,680
All right.

480
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:29,680
Yeah.

481
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:34,360
Links in the show notes at coder dot show slash four to nine and it'll be titled election

482
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:40,640
day Linux desktop contest from the mad modern and just recently touring that system 76 factory.

483
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:43,880
It made me want a Thalios so bad.

484
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:48,040
You know, when we restarted this show, we talked a lot about our setups and some of

485
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:53,120
the changes we had made and then I end up here in the RV for like a 40 day long road

486
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:59,160
trip and I'm, you know, producing three or four shows a week at a minimum, sometimes

487
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:03,760
five shows a week depending on what's going on and I am every time I am tearing down my

488
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:08,520
setup and resetting it up and this time too, I brought the MacBook with me and had to kind

489
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:12,720
of learn how to conquer that in the right way and I, it made me really kind of stop

490
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:17,800
and think, I think before I ever do something like this again, I'm going to build a permanent

491
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:22,400
setup, something built into the RV, you know, like a, like something that with a fold down

492
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:29,040
screen and a spot to mount the microphone and I could see the M one Mac mini being a

493
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:36,560
pretty clever machine because when you look at it in the benchmarks, the Mac mini is kicking

494
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:43,120
in a NUX butt and it's doing it at half the wattage, like the NUX will be doing, these

495
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:46,360
are really stupid rough numbers so don't take my word for it, but the NUX will be doing

496
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:54,720
it like at 66 watts when its CPUs are going and the M one can do the same job at 30 watts

497
00:26:54,720 --> 00:27:03,600
and do it slightly faster and that for me, I am right now, I am running two laptops to

498
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:07,960
do this, one's a ThinkPad and one's a MacBook and they're sucking down power and they're

499
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:11,680
sucking down a lot of power and I'm running off solar, but I parked in the shade so I'm

500
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:16,080
not getting a lot of solar today so today is a great example of a day where I have a

501
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:21,760
full day of work, I'm recording multiple shows, my equipment needs to be running all day long

502
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:28,600
and I've also got some fans running and I am just barely getting my run covered with

503
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:35,440
solar and so when Apple talks about the power efficiency of the M one and we talk about

504
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:39,760
it in terms of workstations and desktops, I really have this kind of aha moment where

505
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:46,200
I was like oh right, it actually is going to really matter how much power my desktop

506
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:50,880
draws and maybe we should all be thinking about that, maybe we should be asking if our

507
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:55,440
PCs need to have thousand watt power supplies and maybe we should be thinking in general

508
00:27:55,440 --> 00:28:01,640
how can we build these devices to consume less power and maybe 20 years down the road

509
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:04,640
more and more homes are going to be powered off solar and they're going to have to think

510
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:10,800
about what they're doing with their power for the day and I feel like the power draw

511
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:15,080
now of my next desktop, because I don't want it to be a laptop, I want it to be built in,

512
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:21,280
something like I affixed to the wall, the power draw of my next desktop is a huge factor

513
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:24,680
and I don't know, I'm just putting that out there, if other people in the audience have

514
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:28,600
thoughts about power draw because there's, this is coming up, I don't know if you saw

515
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:34,160
this Mike, but I think in my home state of Washington now Dell's no longer selling alien

516
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:39,000
ware desktops because they draw too much power, you see this and I think California's doing

517
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
it too.

518
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,480
Yeah, I did see that, that they're limiting power draw from computers for the environmental

519
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:44,480
reasons.

520
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:50,240
And Apple's just sitting there laughing right now, they go for it they say, it's going to

521
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:51,240
sell more Macs.

522
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:58,120
All right, so I'm on the road a lot and I get asked a question frequently and I hate

523
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:04,180
this question, I always have even when I worked at a nine to five job, what's the next thing

524
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:09,400
for Jupiter broadcasting or what are you doing next or alternatively when I worked at a company

525
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:13,540
it was, where do you see yourself in five years?

526
00:29:13,540 --> 00:29:19,000
This question, it implies the expectation number one for JB that growth is mandatory,

527
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:24,160
I mean, yeah, growth would be nice, but also isn't there a place for like a lifestyle business

528
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:30,840
that gets to a certain size, becomes sustainable and you just like have a goal of keeping that

529
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:33,840
to slightly growing that like, isn't that okay?

530
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:38,940
It seems like everybody always asks the question with the main goal of like, you want growth,

531
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:42,480
you want, we're going to do five new shows or if I'm working for somebody, they want

532
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:47,400
me to say, I want to be running the company in five years and I hate this question.

533
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:49,680
Yeah, I think it's fundamentally a bad question.

534
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:55,940
I know like any, you know, cool business consultant and a muscle teacher will tell you that like

535
00:29:55,940 --> 00:29:59,160
you need to have a goal, but the truth is when you're small, you don't know, you may

536
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:03,800
have things you would like to happen, but a gentle breeze can sway you one way or the

537
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:04,800
other.

538
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:05,800
Yeah.

539
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:06,800
Like stay flexible.

540
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:07,800
Like when, why can't that be a goal?

541
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:10,900
Like I'm staying flexible and I'm always kind of keeping my eye on things.

542
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:15,540
So that way I can respond as market demands, like that seems like a good goal, but nobody

543
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:16,540
likes that answer.

544
00:30:16,540 --> 00:30:17,540
No.

545
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:20,600
I mean, every time I've set like a firm goal in terms of like head count or revenue, it's

546
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:25,920
always been like when something imploded anybody with a goal and then COVID happened, probably

547
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:27,920
was in a bit of trouble.

548
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:28,920
Yeah.

549
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:30,360
I generally don't even answer this question to be honest with you.

550
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:31,360
That's how I handle it.

551
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:34,760
I've probably been asked it 20 times in the last few weeks.

552
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:38,720
And I, you know, I mean I have goals, right?

553
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:43,200
But mine, mine are like, uh, I'd like to maintain and grow the business a bit.

554
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:49,000
And I would, I would love to be able to launch one more show and uh, I would like to set

555
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,520
a new tone in the Linux community.

556
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:55,440
And that's something I've actually been thinking about pretty seriously is how could I position

557
00:30:55,440 --> 00:31:02,260
the shows in such a way that maybe we stopped like this, uh, like shaming people for using

558
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:03,720
a tool different than you.

559
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:05,520
Um, it's just so tribal.

560
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:08,800
And I think it's a huge turnoff to people that are coming into the Linux community.

561
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:13,800
Like I think about, there was a couple of years ago, a mutual friend of ours made a

562
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:19,680
lot of hay that the Linux foundation director, uh, Jim Zimmerman or whatever his name is,

563
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:23,960
sorry, I'm forgetting right now, uh, was using a Mac during the presentation.

564
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:28,240
And you know, um, multiple YouTube videos were made about this and you know, Twitter,

565
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:32,760
uh, threads and a lot of, a lot of public shaming, you know, the people gathered in

566
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:35,480
the circle to, uh, throw their stones.

567
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:41,920
And um, it seems so short-sighted because the reality is that there's probably a lot

568
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:45,360
more people that are running Linux on the server connecting in through a terminal on

569
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:48,120
all kinds of different hardware and desktops.

570
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:52,600
And I think the community has to be way more welcoming to that kind of person.

571
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:57,160
Like if you've got a VPS and a raspberry PI and you know, you consider yourself a Linux

572
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:58,160
user, then you're welcome.

573
00:31:58,160 --> 00:32:01,660
Or if you've, you know, just listening because you're interested, you should be welcome and

574
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:03,760
you shouldn't feel bad for using a Mac.

575
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:09,160
Like I was joking that listener Mike, when we met up in Denver, he felt, he felt legitimately

576
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:12,240
like he had to apologize for a Mac book in our presence.

577
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:15,600
And you know, I'm sitting here right now with one of my machines in front of me is a Mac

578
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:16,600
book.

579
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:19,460
And I don't like that this has become so tribal.

580
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:25,280
And so, so I don't know, just, it's like a, it's a bad attitude in the Linux community.

581
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:26,280
I think makes us look bad.

582
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:27,880
And I think it needs to be extended beyond that.

583
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:32,040
And that would be a goal of mine of trying to reposition our community.

584
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:35,360
And I think our community is well positioned to do it already cause that's already, a lot

585
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:37,280
of our community is already that way.

586
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:41,040
Like doing those kinds of things are goals, but it's, that's, that's not something that

587
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:44,460
you can just say in like an elevator type conversation.

588
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:48,520
And I'd be curious to know what the audience and how they answer when somebody says, what's

589
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:49,520
next for your company?

590
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:55,240
I'd love anybody out there who runs a small business and, and doesn't want it to be huge.

591
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:59,240
You know, of course I'd love growth and more revenue and I, you know, I'd love that kind

592
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:01,480
of stuff, but I'd love your input.

593
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:04,960
And also if you've worked out there in a career and they ask you, what are you doing the next

594
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:06,160
five years?

595
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:07,160
What do you say?

596
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:08,440
How do you handle that?

597
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:10,660
Coder.show slash contact.

598
00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:13,140
Also thank you to our Coder QA team out there.

599
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:15,280
You guys keep us going, keep us independent.

600
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:19,680
And as a thank you, you get a limited ad feed and you get the Coderly that comes out every

601
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:20,760
quarter.

602
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:25,460
And that is that Coder QA.co Mr. Dominic, is there anywhere you would like to send people

603
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:26,460
this week?

604
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:28,320
Just add to Manuka on Twitter.

605
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,600
That's simple.

606
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,160
That's a secret recipe right there.

607
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:34,960
And of course we do have the link for the contest information for those three Thaleos

608
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:35,960
in the show notes.

609
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:41,400
In fact, links to everything we talked about today at Coder.show slash four two nine.

610
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:44,520
You go over there while you're there, you can hit that contact form and let us know

611
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:45,520
your thoughts.

612
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:46,520
That's a huge part of the show.

613
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:50,280
It's a good way for us to gauge the audience interest in an episode, even if you didn't

614
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:51,500
like it.

615
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:56,560
And you also find resources to subscribe in your pod catcher of choice and you could always

616
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:57,680
consider joining us.

617
00:33:57,680 --> 00:34:01,700
Let me tell you, it was quite the investment of effort to get the live stream going this

618
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:02,700
week.

619
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:05,080
And I'm sure it will be for a while while I'm on the road.

620
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:08,160
So go see how it all comes together at JBLive.TV.

621
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:12,600
We do it at noon Pacific, three p.m. Eastern over there, and you can get it converted at

622
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:14,840
Jupiter broadcasting dot com slash calendar.

623
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:16,000
Thanks for joining us.

624
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:24,760
See you next week.
