00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
This is Koda Radio, episode 365 for July 8th, 2019.

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:38,560
Hello, and welcome to Koda Radio, Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show that takes

3
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:47,240
a pragmatic look at the art and business of software development and related technologies.

4
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:53,480
My name is Wes, and I'm very pleased to be joined by that fire-cracking Florvidian who's

5
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:57,680
had one too many fireworks this time around, Mr. Michael Dominic.

6
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:58,680
Hi, Mike.

7
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:00,240
Get off my lawn!

8
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:01,240
I know.

9
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:06,600
I transitioned from being a, you know, like a fun-loving lad in my youth who liked blowing

10
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:07,600
things up, frankly.

11
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:08,600
Yeah.

12
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:12,600
And now I'm a dog owner, so it's just about the worst thing in the world.

13
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:17,400
I think we've got one other person who snuck in in the nick of time.

14
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:18,400
Mr. Chris Vischer.

15
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:19,400
Hello, Chris.

16
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,400
Hey, guys.

17
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,400
Thanks for having me back.

18
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:22,400
Oh, we wouldn't be without you.

19
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,920
I kind of am a little relieved that I'm not the only one.

20
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:26,720
I had the same transition.

21
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,760
Like this year, I was like, oh, can we just not?

22
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:29,760
Yep.

23
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:30,760
It's just, yeah, it's kind of a futz.

24
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:32,880
Honestly, I prefer just the professional shows.

25
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,720
You know, you can go there if you want to see it.

26
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,840
It's usually away from most of the housing.

27
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:38,560
I could even go with another compromise.

28
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:45,240
How about we just all agree from like 8 p.m. to midnight, you have that on the 4th of July,

29
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:46,880
and we'll just all prepare for that.

30
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:50,760
It's like the day before, and today we're recording on the 8th, and my neighbors are

31
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:52,720
still setting off fireworks.

32
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:53,720
Still going strong.

33
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:57,160
I'm kind of like, okay, how about we just compromise, meet somewhere in the middle here?

34
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,160
That's all.

35
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,160
I'm such an old man.

36
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:03,320
I looked up how to do some CSS fireworks, so that's another tech-powered solution.

37
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:04,840
Just don't blow anything up.

38
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:05,840
Use the computer.

39
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:10,040
I just wanted to go out to the neighborhood kids and say, this is the blink tag.

40
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:11,320
Knock yourselves out.

41
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:12,320
You know what?

42
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:14,600
It is the real-life version of the blink tag, isn't it?

43
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:15,600
It really is, right?

44
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:16,600
Good call.

45
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,560
I think that's exactly it.

46
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:22,960
Okay, now, I feel a little fronted here, because every time I come on the show, you guys put

47
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:27,840
Mac news stories in the doc, and I didn't do any of this.

48
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,280
I will back you up on this.

49
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,480
It just happens, and we've talked about it enough.

50
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:32,480
It was Joe.

51
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,860
We want to follow up on stories that we cover, right?

52
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:35,860
It just makes sense.

53
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:36,860
It's our instinct.

54
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:39,840
I think Alan, Jude, and Joe are conspiring against me to get the audience to think that

55
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,920
I'm the Mac guy on the show, is what it is.

56
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:44,400
You guys are just complicit.

57
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:49,600
Despite overseeing the Linux-ification, that's hard to say, but regardless, you made that

58
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,160
happen here in the studio, right?

59
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:53,200
And there's hardly a Mac to be seen.

60
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,360
I prefer the term freeing the studio, Wes.

61
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,920
Oh, freeing the studio.

62
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:58,920
Oh.

63
00:02:58,920 --> 00:02:59,920
Oh, God.

64
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:02,160
It was more about philosophy than functionality.

65
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:03,160
Burn!

66
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,160
Nice!

67
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:07,440
Wow, I am really impressed how you turned that around on me.

68
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,720
Dang it.

69
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:15,120
Okay, well, yeah, so I think the big hoopla story that kind of leads into this thing that

70
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:20,520
I was sort of implying is, A, it's now, as you guys talked about, on the record, that

71
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:22,800
Johnny Ive is officially on the way out.

72
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:23,800
See ya!

73
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:29,480
B, we've had that Wall Street Journal article that said that Cook wasn't involved, and then

74
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:32,480
we had Tim Cook make this super strong response.

75
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,520
Oh, yeah, that was a little awkward.

76
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:39,080
And now, there is what seems to me, at least having followed this for a while, so this

77
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:43,920
is where I get this kind of feeling, is a very intentionally leaked story.

78
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:48,380
Because now we have multiple sources that are claiming that the new MacBook Pro later

79
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:52,880
this year will have a totally new keyboard mechanism.

80
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:56,280
And when you start seeing these kinds of leaks, and I'm curious to know Mike's take on this,

81
00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:01,520
it kind of feels like an intentional leak by Apple to set a narrative after this Ive

82
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,520
announcement.

83
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:07,920
Wait, wait, are you suggesting that they would conveniently try to imply that the crappy

84
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:13,240
keyboard that was way too thin to be useful was the responsibility of a very controversial

85
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:17,080
and famous designer, who that now he's leaving, we can have a good keyboard?

86
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:18,480
Is that what you're trying to say?

87
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:21,320
I mean, it kind of seems that way, Mike.

88
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,520
It kind of seems that way.

89
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:30,200
It wasn't it interesting how Tim Cook, very Clark Kent-esque, flew around the media saying,

90
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:32,920
I make all these decisions.

91
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,080
And now we have a good keyboard.

92
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:38,800
Yeah, I mean, you know, this is some Floridian Gator Bacon.

93
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,440
I don't think Johnny Ive cares.

94
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:42,800
I think he's a knight and rich.

95
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:43,800
Yeah, it's true.

96
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:47,040
I mean, he comes out of this fine in every situation.

97
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:53,080
But if anybody's ever shipped a product, particularly physical products, there's just no way this

98
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,080
just happened, right?

99
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,080
Oh, yeah, right.

100
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:58,040
I mean, it's got to be in the works for a long time.

101
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,400
Oh, no doubt about it.

102
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,400
No doubt.

103
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:05,720
I think it's been, I think the Ive transition has been in the works since Apple Park wrapped

104
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:06,720
up.

105
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:07,720
That's my estimation.

106
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:10,680
If you look back at some of the way they've been communicating about Ive's role and the

107
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:14,360
promotion that he got around then and all of that, it kind of all equals to the beginning

108
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:16,720
of a transition.

109
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:22,720
And I would say there was no winning here for Apple, because if Tim Cook was hyper-involved

110
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:27,640
and trying to be involved in every single design decision, something tells me Johnny

111
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:29,760
Ive wouldn't like that either.

112
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:34,240
So it's either he's not involved enough, or he's too involved, and I don't think there

113
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:38,200
was ever going to be a happy medium because it's just my sense of the personality types

114
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,200
at work here.

115
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:44,040
And Apple's trying to combat the narrative that I perhaps way too hard hit last week

116
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:48,480
that Tim Cook really is effectively an operations guy, right?

117
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:53,840
Because I don't know why, we've all three of us talked about this for a long time on

118
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:57,920
different shows in this show, but for some reason the big tech companies love the idea

119
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:00,720
of the CEO as like the god king coming down and â€“

120
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,720
Right.

121
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:02,720
The tyrant.

122
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,720
Yeah.

123
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:04,720
Yes.

124
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:05,720
I think it's silly.

125
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:08,880
I would actually be more impressed if they came down and said, my name is Tim Cook.

126
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:12,000
I am one of the best operations people in the world.

127
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,320
So I just hired the best programmers and designers to do that for me.

128
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,320
But they can't say that.

129
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:18,320
I don't know.

130
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:19,320
That's what I would say.

131
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:20,320
It seems like a pretty reasonable approach.

132
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:23,120
And how other industries do it, right?

133
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,920
I mean, you're there to operate the business.

134
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,800
The ones that aren't media darling industries.

135
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,280
Although, I mean, Apple does things a little differently, right?

136
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:34,600
And their history has been kind of written by these big design changes.

137
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,960
It was not business as usual.

138
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:41,080
I think we also have to be fair, they're sort of the architect of the celebrity CEO for

139
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:42,080
the tech industry.

140
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,080
Yeah.

141
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:44,080
He's not the first celebrity CEO.

142
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,080
I mean, hello, Edison.

143
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,080
Hello, Mark Shuttleworth.

144
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,080
Yeah.

145
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:52,440
But, you know, for that Silicon Valley area, he sort of is the architect â€“ architect,

146
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:53,440
whatever I'm trying to say.

147
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,640
We're talking about Ken Metcalf, right?

148
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:57,720
No, of course not.

149
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,720
I'm talking about Wozniak.

150
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:04,560
It seems only kind of fair that people still view them in that light.

151
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:08,240
But it's not the reality of a company of their scale.

152
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:15,480
When you look at the people on the team, like Craig Federighi and Phil Schiller, and I would

153
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:19,440
have probably cited Ive before, they seem like exceptionally talented individuals who

154
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:22,680
have been at the company for a very long time.

155
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:25,720
And recently, they've been featured more and more on podcasts.

156
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:31,300
I've actually gotten a chance to hear them in a less structured, less promotional setting.

157
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:32,300
And they're very intelligent individuals.

158
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:35,880
I don't know if you've had that same assessment, Mike, but it seems like, for example, Craig

159
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,800
Federighi really knows his shit.

160
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:38,800
Of course, right?

161
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:42,280
I mean, for all our trolling on this show, which, by the way, is supposed to be entertainment

162
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:43,580
too, right?

163
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:48,520
You don't become a director of insert department here at Apple without being a very smart,

164
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:49,520
very capable person.

165
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,520
Yeah.

166
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:51,520
That was too nice.

167
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:54,080
Yeah, I just expected some further vitriol there.

168
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,080
No, no.

169
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:56,080
All right.

170
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:59,760
So to the topic on point here that really matters to the audience is, depending on who

171
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:05,880
you follow, some people would argue that the MacBook Pro is one of the premier developer

172
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:08,320
systems, especially if you're in Xcode.

173
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:11,600
It's one of your only options, really, if you want to be a mobile developer.

174
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,880
Or if you want to do HomePod development.

175
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:17,960
Still now, if you go work for some big tech company, more than likely, you're getting

176
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:19,480
a MacBook, right, on your first day.

177
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:24,080
So the potential ramifications here are a new MacBook Pro with a larger screen that

178
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:28,960
is, let's just say, in theory, for the sake of this conversation, designed by that new

179
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:34,520
or help design led by that new Pro team, the same team that had influence on the iMac Pro,

180
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:37,440
the new Mac Mini, and the Mac Pro.

181
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:42,040
Let's say they've also been involved in a Mac Pro for professionals, like the King Mac

182
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:43,040
Pro.

183
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:44,040
They're going to have to call it...

184
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:45,040
They can't call it Mac Pro Plus or whatever.

185
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,040
Maybe they will.

186
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:47,040
Is it like a Mac Pro Pro?

187
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,040
Wait.

188
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:49,040
Maybe they'll call it...

189
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,040
What do they call the...

190
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:51,040
Is it X...

191
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,040
What do they call the larger iPhone?

192
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,040
Is it just plus and still?

193
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,040
XL.

194
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:55,040
It's XL.

195
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,040
Maybe that's...

196
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,040
Maybe they'll call it the MacBook XL.

197
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,040
I mean, I don't know.

198
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:59,040
I could see it.

199
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,040
Yeah.

200
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,040
Or they'll just call it the MacBook 16-inch.

201
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:04,040
And it'll just be implied that the 16-inch version is more powerful.

202
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:05,040
Of course.

203
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,040
Right.

204
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,720
And the rumor here is that it switches to...

205
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:09,520
Actually the rumor is they're going to start with a MacBook Air.

206
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:13,440
But I just like for the purposes of conversation, let's say they launch a MacBook Pro larger

207
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,440
screen.

208
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,440
This one even has an SD card reader.

209
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,440
It's got a new keyboard.

210
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:21,040
It's still all USB-C, but it's got lots of USB-C. They're all Thunderbolt 3 ports.

211
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,240
It's got this bigger screen.

212
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,580
It's got a great keyboard.

213
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:25,760
Let's just for the sake of argument say it's like the T480's keyboard.

214
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:26,760
It's quite nice.

215
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:27,760
Okay.

216
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,560
Have they solved the problem?

217
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:30,560
Is the criticism...

218
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:31,720
Is all the criticism done?

219
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:33,560
Is the conversation dead at that point?

220
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:34,560
Or is there more?

221
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:35,560
Is there like a software layer?

222
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:36,560
Right?

223
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,000
I mean, you've got Peru there.

224
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,320
You're probably developing for Linux, at least if you're doing the enterprise side

225
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,320
of things.

226
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,520
It depends on what you mean, right?

227
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:46,880
Are you defining the problem as like the 20-something percent failure rate?

228
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:49,120
Because yeah, if you fix that, you fix that, right?

229
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:52,620
Well also it's just that they're extremely uncomfortable to type on, especially when

230
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:53,620
you're typing a lot.

231
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:55,600
At least for me, maybe because I'm an old typist.

232
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,880
I mean, I've been typing for...

233
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:57,880
Yeah, they hurt.

234
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:58,880
Oh, they hurt.

235
00:09:58,880 --> 00:09:59,880
Oh no, it hurts.

236
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:00,880
Yeah.

237
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:01,880
Yeah.

238
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:05,840
But if they could make it a competitive product like that again, they may solve the criticism.

239
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:08,920
Now ironically, this particular rumor that we have linked in the show notes is about

240
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:10,080
the MacBook Air.

241
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:13,280
The 16-inch won't even get the keyboard this year is what it suggests.

242
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,760
The 16-inch that hasn't even been announced yet.

243
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:20,120
I mean, my issue as a buyer of these devices has always been that this is your most expensive

244
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:23,720
laptop and it is also your most unreliable.

245
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:24,720
Unreliable?

246
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:25,720
What do you mean?

247
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,080
Well, no, it's not...

248
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,440
This is not me asserting this, right?

249
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,440
This is...

250
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,440
People have...

251
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,440
Not Consumer Reports.

252
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,440
There's a...

253
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:34,040
Is it Anandtech?

254
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:35,040
Who does the...

255
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,680
What they think the return rates and defect rates are on all the Apple products?

256
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,160
Oh, the people that try to...

257
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:40,160
Yeah.

258
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,160
Yeah, it is 20-something percent.

259
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:46,960
And for a laptop that is minimum gonna be $2,000 unless you're buying a base model and

260
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:51,000
probably for someone who has heavier needs, 3,000.

261
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
I don't know.

262
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,920
Even if it's just 21%, right?

263
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:56,000
That's not an acceptable failure rate in my opinion.

264
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Boy, that would be...

265
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
No, no, that would be...

266
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,080
If that's true, if that number is true, that would be...

267
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,640
I mean, there's no way it could be that high.

268
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:05,120
Well, I mean, the Wall Street Journal did an entire piece on it, right?

269
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,120
It's not...

270
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,120
This isn't...

271
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,120
I mean, I know they're bad.

272
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,120
I agree with you there.

273
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,120
And they should be a lot better.

274
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:15,220
I feel like I am that guy who always says, oh, the solution to Android's shortcomings

275
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:16,400
is just to flash it with lineage.

276
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:18,400
I'm gonna be that guy for a moment, but...

277
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:19,760
Lay it on us.

278
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:24,680
Apple seems to be moving in the direction of supporting macOS more and more under virtualization

279
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:28,160
to the extent that they're even adding Vert.io drivers to...

280
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,680
Isn't that interesting?

281
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:33,280
Not even just to Catalina, but they're bringing those Vert.io drivers to the...

282
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:35,640
What's the current version of macOS?

283
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:36,640
Mojave?

284
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:41,280
Yes, they're bringing them to Mojave even, in the latest releases of Mojave.

285
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:42,280
Wow.

286
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:45,520
Now, these Vert.io drivers are what allow an operating system to have drivers that are

287
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:47,160
aware it's being virtualized.

288
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:48,720
It's optimized for virtualization.

289
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,360
Yeah, it communicates intelligently with the hypervisor.

290
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,320
And that's not an accident.

291
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,320
Those don't just accidentally...

292
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,320
Whoopsie, Vert.io.

293
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,320
Mm-hmm.

294
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:01,240
And Windows 10 also works really great under virtualization.

295
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:06,760
And when you use an AMD card with PCI pass-through, you can have full GPU acceleration for both

296
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:07,760
of these...

297
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:12,200
You can't do it at the same time, but you can load a VM and have full GPU pass-through

298
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:17,400
for either OS on any hardware you want that supports virtualization.

299
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:19,000
Which is a lot these days.

300
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,160
And I think it's time...

301
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,960
We were just having a pre-show conversation.

302
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:27,760
We have here at the studio and also on our VPSs, we have divorced, as many of you probably

303
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,680
have, the applications from the operating system.

304
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:33,540
Well, now we can divorce the operating system from the hardware.

305
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:34,540
It's all available to us.

306
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:36,680
It just takes a little extra setup, but you do it once, right?

307
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:40,720
Well, you do it once, and then you've got it all configured and ready to go, right?

308
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:45,280
If you are someone like me who mostly is now developing server-side software, and frankly,

309
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:51,040
some Windows desktop, mostly server-side running on Ubuntu, Linux, or SUSE, why would I not

310
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:56,240
just VM, Mac OS, Catalina for when I need it, and literally buy the nicest laptop with

311
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,560
the best eGPU that I could possibly afford?

312
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,140
Would you spend most of your time there?

313
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:01,140
Would you be switching around?

314
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:03,080
Because you still got your question of where are you spending...

315
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,200
It's not super portable.

316
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,080
That's the biggest downside I find.

317
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:08,960
However, there are ways to do...

318
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:13,960
And this is an area I don't really know much about, but on modern, like our laptops, your

319
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:18,000
laptop right there, supports virtualizing the GPU.

320
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:23,720
So you can actually carve out your Intel GPU as a dedicated GPU to the VMs all in that

321
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:24,720
laptop.

322
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:25,720
You just only have Intel graphics.

323
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:28,040
There's a bunch of caveats with that, I thought.

324
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,240
Isn't it like dependent on which...

325
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:32,120
It doesn't matter really, but which one you have and which kind of virtualization.

326
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,120
Yeah.

327
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:36,200
I mean, all of this stuff is pretty hardware-specific, and you've got to know which flags to look

328
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:40,360
through and match up the CPU and the motherboard and how all that works.

329
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:44,520
Like I say, it takes a little bit of work, but then you have sort of the stability and

330
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:47,240
reliability of virtualization under those operating systems, too.

331
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:51,680
So then you gain things like snapshots before an update, before all those kinds of things.

332
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:54,720
So you actually bring a level of stability to your development environment that you don't

333
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:57,240
have when it's running on native hardware.

334
00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:00,040
Like I said, at the top of this, I'm going to be the guy that says, solve all your Android

335
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,320
problems by running lineage.

336
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:05,440
It's not really an option for everybody, but I think maybe it's more of an option than

337
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,440
people realize.

338
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:10,040
Because I'm on a laptop, I didn't think it was possible.

339
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:11,680
And it's game changer.

340
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,240
Especially if like, yeah, like your mic, right?

341
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:16,240
Maybe you just need to run it as a build server for Xcode or something.

342
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:20,320
You just need to get stuff signed and through there, and otherwise you can develop wherever

343
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,320
you want.

344
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:27,960
I guess what it really comes down to is, is the Macintosh hardware and the Mac OS operating

345
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:32,480
system, is it important to you that you are in that ecosystem?

346
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:35,840
And maybe, is it a statement?

347
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,620
Is it a status symbol product?

348
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:43,200
Or is the Mac OS and its applications simply a tool in which you use to get your job done?

349
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:47,080
And maybe, depending on what answer you have for that, maybe that tells you what route

350
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:48,080
to take.

351
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:50,720
Now, can I run the ball forward about five years, though?

352
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:51,840
Well, let's do it.

353
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:57,080
This all makes sense, and this all works because Windows, Mac OS, and Linux are all effectively

354
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:59,560
Windows, I'm sorry, Intel systems, right?

355
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:00,960
They're x86, x64.

356
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:03,760
Yeah, we're all running on the same chips.

357
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:08,200
What happens when Uncle Tim throws down the gauntlet and says, and ARM?

358
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,060
That's what I mean.

359
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:11,200
That comes a lot harder, right?

360
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:13,320
The virtualization, the overhead.

361
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:19,000
I think everything changes, unless there's ARM hardware out there that can, yeah, I think

362
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
everything changes.

363
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,080
But at that point, too, you got to figure a lot of your application workflow would change,

364
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:25,080
too.

365
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:29,880
And you may actually want an x86 version of Mac OS around for compatibility reasons for

366
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:30,920
a really long time.

367
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:34,440
And again, virtualization would really be a good use case there.

368
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:36,000
That would be a fascinating transition.

369
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,560
Yeah, it will be.

370
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:39,440
It's going to be painful, I think, for a lot of people.

371
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:45,400
And maybe it's another reason not to invest in multi-thousand-dollar Mac products when

372
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:47,080
they could be at the end of a line.

373
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:48,880
You mean a $47,000 Mac Pro.

374
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,200
Right, I mean, look at that, right?

375
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:53,440
I mean, even if you could come up with another screen that is still high resolution that

376
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:57,200
can connect to that thing, and there are not a lot of options there, you're still looking

377
00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:01,560
at probably a base $6,000 out the door for the machine once you get it configured, even

378
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:02,700
adequately.

379
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:07,520
Or you could put all of that money into a custom-built PC or a machine you buy that

380
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:08,520
could get you a lot more.

381
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:11,840
And then you virtualize, and that could get you stability in a way you hadn't really considered

382
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:12,840
before.

383
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:17,200
And the trend line for Mac OS has been to support virtualization more and more.

384
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:22,020
It started like five years ago with licensing changes, and the support for it has just accelerated

385
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:23,080
since then.

386
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:28,000
Not to troll, but what if you could have a user land with like a high software compatibility

387
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,080
and a desktop environment used by millions, and a kernel from a different OS that you

388
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:35,800
can work natively in?

389
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:39,520
You kind of trolled last week.

390
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:44,400
I am curious, though, because you mentioned you were doing VS code and having that nice

391
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:45,400
integration.

392
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,400
I mean, how serious are you?

393
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:47,680
Are you actually liking it that much?

394
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:48,680
Is it working for your needs?

395
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:51,400
Do you feel like you're effectively targeting Linux this way?

396
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:53,040
I have deployed software.

397
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:57,040
I have built binaries, a few of them that I've needed.

398
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:02,440
Now, we're mostly talking about server-side software I'm developing, so it's been perfectly

399
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:03,440
fine.

400
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:09,520
But for me, and this is dumb, is that like the WSL stuff is very being worked on.

401
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,360
I'm also using that new fancy terminal.

402
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:14,040
Oh, I have not tried that yet.

403
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:17,840
Which thanks to the listener Sean McBride gave me some pointers on how to set that up

404
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:20,400
because the documentation is not great yet.

405
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:29,040
I mean, as far as doing Ruby and doing some.NET Core, it's just fine.

406
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:30,880
I am interested to see what happens.

407
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:33,960
Like I have a cute project that I just need to pull down and take a look at something

408
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,480
for somebody.

409
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:37,760
What happens if I try to run that in WSL?

410
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:40,080
I think the answer is it's just going to fail.

411
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:44,600
I have to say, if you are a web developer who also needs to touch...

412
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:48,080
You know, it's almost the old Microsoft argument, right?

413
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:50,480
I'm sorry, the old MacBook argument.

414
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:54,440
If you are a web developer who occasionally needs like Xcode for like signing a Cordova

415
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:56,760
or a PhoneGap app, this is great, right?

416
00:17:56,760 --> 00:18:00,400
I do have Windows applications in the field, in the market.

417
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:04,680
The vast majority of the software I write is being deployed, like I said, to SUSE and

418
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:05,680
Ubuntu servers.

419
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:06,680
So that's...

420
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:07,680
Yeah, don't even get me started.

421
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:08,680
I know.

422
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:09,680
I know.

423
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:14,240
We don't want to disparage.

424
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:18,640
Legitimately though, real talk, what about the paper cuts of running Windows?

425
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:22,400
You know, like the fact that the start menu has got all over it, the fact that the Windows

426
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:27,840
updates process takes a decade, the fact that it's a mishmash of UI, all those things.

427
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:28,840
Okay.

428
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:32,040
So I'm waiting on writing the review of this with the experiences.

429
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:33,640
I did intentionally...

430
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:38,320
I am intentionally using hardware that is 100% Linux compatible, just in case I want

431
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:39,320
to slap Pop!

432
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:40,800
OS or elementary or something on this.

433
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:41,800
Nice.

434
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:42,800
Yeah, okay.

435
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:47,720
It is amazing to me how unpleasant the Windows kind of just setting up your machine experience

436
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:48,720
still is these days.

437
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:49,720
Yeah.

438
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:52,380
Like I had to delete Candy Crush.

439
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:53,640
That's ridiculous to me.

440
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:58,120
Yeah, or how fiddly you have to get with the power saving settings and the update settings.

441
00:18:58,120 --> 00:18:59,120
It's not hard.

442
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:04,520
It's just it's lots of fiddly settings that you spend a lot of time overall changing.

443
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:05,520
It's like using plasma.

444
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:06,520
No, I can't.

445
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:09,520
It's kind of fair in a way, actually.

446
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:12,480
I mean, it's all going to be about trade-offs, right?

447
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:16,720
Like I know plenty of people who I've tried to evangelize desktop Linux to who are Mac

448
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,800
people and they're like, are you kidding me?

449
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:19,800
Right?

450
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:23,960
Like I would never do that, you know.

451
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:28,480
I would say that if you're a comfortable desktop Linux user, are you probably going to switch

452
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:30,040
to Windows 10?

453
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:32,520
Not unless you already needed Windows, right?

454
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:34,600
Am I a hundred percent on Windows 10?

455
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:36,040
I am for now.

456
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:38,000
Do I think it will last?

457
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,440
Well, it used to be the case and this is Mike's old man hat.

458
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:47,520
The last time I seriously, seriously ran Windows other than for like a four month job was I

459
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:52,440
think it was Windows, God, I don't even know the word, eight, eight, Windows eight.

460
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:56,560
It has been my experience that Windows machines tend to slow down after a while.

461
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:57,560
Oh yeah.

462
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:58,840
The Windows slow down creep.

463
00:19:58,840 --> 00:19:59,840
We all know that.

464
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:00,840
Yeah.

465
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:01,840
So if that starts to happen, I will probably get frustrated.

466
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:05,120
You know how I get like, you know, pour a beer into it or something.

467
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:07,060
But I want to be careful how I phrase this.

468
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:11,640
I don't think the Linux community should view WSL as a threat.

469
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:13,480
I really actually think it's an opportunity, right?

470
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:15,200
It is a sign that Linux is one.

471
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:20,060
Now maybe it's bad if you happen to be a Dome developer, right?

472
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:22,760
Or the elementary OS team or pop OS team.

473
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:23,760
Yeah.

474
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:24,760
You know what, Mike, is you're talking about this.

475
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:29,600
You know what I realized is this is, um, it is a sign of success, just like wine was a

476
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,920
sign of success for Windows.

477
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:32,920
People want it, right?

478
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:36,600
That's why Microsoft's investing real time and energy and dev hours into it.

479
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:37,600
Okay.

480
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:38,600
Can I come at this from another angle then?

481
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:44,640
So what deficiency is Windows 10 as a desktop addressing that you have found say in a day

482
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:47,560
to day pop OS or modern Ubuntu install?

483
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:51,240
Well, that's an unfair question, right, because I have four Windows applications currently

484
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:52,240
in the field.

485
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,240
So the deficiency is,

486
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:57,120
I mean, aside from that, like I'm wondering, is it, is it app, is the, is application compatibility

487
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:00,820
truly a differentiator for you at this point?

488
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:04,520
Is there things that Windows 10 is doing better that make you think, gosh, even when I'm not

489
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:08,800
managing Windows applications that I'm shipping, there's reasons to stay here.

490
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,120
Actually that is a great question.

491
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:14,400
It turns out that my software application compatibility, other than working on these

492
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:21,360
native Windows apps, is better on Windows and Linux than it is on Mac.

493
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:25,780
Because anything I wanted to use, whether it be entertainment or work, there is either

494
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:31,640
a Linux equivalency, right, or indeed it's a Linux tool that I couldn't use on Windows

495
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:35,820
before, or that I had to install via homebrew for Mac.

496
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:41,880
Or if it's a game, it can run near natively with Lutris on Linux.

497
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:46,520
On Mac, I actually have, like for instance, I am addicted to Magic the Gathering Arena.

498
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:47,520
Great game.

499
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:51,760
For those who don't know, it's, in fact, a former host here, Jason, used to play it all

500
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,600
the time, right?

501
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:57,940
That ran flawlessly on Pop OS.

502
00:21:57,940 --> 00:22:01,680
Doesn't run at all on Mac without some pretty deep wine hackery.

503
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:02,680
Oh.

504
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:05,620
Same thing with my MMO of choice, Star Trek Online.

505
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:06,620
I play it.

506
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:07,620
Oh, dude, yes.

507
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:08,620
I play it on Linux.

508
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:12,680
In fact, I don't play it at all under Windows, and you can't even get it to run on Mac OS.

509
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:15,560
Even with that crossover and wine and all of those things, it's just not happening on

510
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:16,560
Mac OS.

511
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:20,480
So, I mean, for me, and I know this is kind of a sideways way to answer your question,

512
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:25,740
this experience has shown me, when I eventually settle down again, I'm probably going to distro

513
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:28,360
hop a little on Linux or stick with Windows 10.

514
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:35,500
We're probably dual boot, but Mac, you know what, at this point in 2019, I really don't

515
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:39,760
think it's, I don't think you should need to compromise with your operating system,

516
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:45,320
which I know sounds like, you know, not nice, but Pop OS is really nice.

517
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:46,320
Elementary is really nice.

518
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:47,320
Right?

519
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:48,320
Ubuntu is nice.

520
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,400
Now, I follow you.

521
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:54,680
This is the end result of Linux essentially becoming, in a way, a runtime.

522
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:58,840
And then, like I just said earlier, divorcing the applications from the operating system

523
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:03,920
or making it possible to run Windows applications on Linux and Linux application on Windows,

524
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:09,000
all of a sudden, the desktop, assuming you're not subscribed to any particular philosophy,

525
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:14,560
is a lot more fluid and it matters, in some ways, a lot less even.

526
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:15,560
Right.

527
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:20,680
I mean, like, Mac added all that, you know, Exive stuff just to partially to help facilitate

528
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:22,520
running Docker containers in a VM there.

529
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:25,600
I run Docker on Mac OS and it runs just fine.

530
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,640
It's got a, there's a nice GUI for it and everything.

531
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:28,640
It's the craziest thing.

532
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:29,640
Where do you get that GUI on Linux?

533
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:30,640
Yeah, right?

534
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:31,640
It's crazy.

535
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:33,760
It comes with Docker Compose right there.

536
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:34,760
Yeah.

537
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:35,760
Yeah.

538
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:36,760
I know.

539
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:39,280
So, I guess my point is that it's just becoming less and less relevant.

540
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:40,280
Less and less.

541
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:43,400
And then, when you containerize the applications up in flat packs or snaps, it's at a whole

542
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:44,400
other level.

543
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,400
Well, let me ask you.

544
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:49,100
I know we're harping on this, but you guys are, I mean, would it be wrong for me to call

545
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:50,760
you freedom terrorists?

546
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:51,760
No.

547
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:52,760
I would think, yes.

548
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:57,240
Sort of like, I mean, more like, it's more like a love and peace kind of vibe going on.

549
00:23:57,240 --> 00:24:00,320
Less of like a Greenpeace, you know, bomb something going on.

550
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:01,320
Okay.

551
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:02,720
Can I state department spend that then?

552
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:03,720
Yeah.

553
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:04,720
Freedom fighters.

554
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:05,720
Warriors.

555
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:06,720
Sure.

556
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:07,720
Revolutionaries.

557
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:10,960
See, it's less aggressive though, but we're on the path to righteousness.

558
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:13,880
We're freedom recommenders.

559
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:14,880
Have you heard about freedom?

560
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:18,520
Do you have a moment?

561
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:19,520
Are you free?

562
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:20,520
Wait.

563
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:21,520
Are you freedom Jehovah's Witnesses?

564
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:22,520
Is that what?

565
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:27,260
I mean, don't you guys feel that you, like, honestly, JB should just be taking a victory

566
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:28,800
lap here, right?

567
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:29,800
You won.

568
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:33,480
We may have bet on the right horse, I suppose.

569
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:40,240
So, what JB originally sought out to be was really a podcast network about the desktop

570
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:41,240
of Linux, which-

571
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:43,200
Oh, well, never mind.

572
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,200
Yeah.

573
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:48,200
But, you know, things change and evolve, and the network is changing and evolving.

574
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:53,800
We still cover that probably disproportionately to the actual market size, but it's what we're

575
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:55,400
all into.

576
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:59,800
And we are very lucky that more and more of the workloads have come to Linux.

577
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:03,600
So, that has been very fortunate because people want to know what's going on with it now.

578
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:04,600
Yeah.

579
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:06,800
There's a certain spirit of it, I think, that's distilled in the desktop.

580
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:10,660
I mean, in some ways it is separate, but many of the communities that make both software

581
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:11,660
co-mingle.

582
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:14,520
Well, I would say there's honor in fighting a losing battle.

583
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:16,800
And speaking of losing battles, Wes, how's that Objective-C?

584
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:20,560
Oh, Mike, I knew you were going to ask about this.

585
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:22,320
I love these challenges so much.

586
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:23,320
Oh, yeah.

587
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:24,320
Okay.

588
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:28,920
So, you set me on a very different path to the world of Objective-C. And, okay, so I'll

589
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:33,440
be honest, I didn't go down the complicated route of setting up a Mac OS VM.

590
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:41,000
Now, that might be something worth trying in the future, but you encouraged me to explore

591
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,920
what other options existed.

592
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:45,760
And it's been really interesting.

593
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:49,880
I mean, you know I'm interested in programming languages and Objective-C kind of has some,

594
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:51,680
I mean, it's been around for a long time.

595
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:56,760
So, it's got some interesting origins, especially the connection to Smalltalk.

596
00:25:56,760 --> 00:26:03,680
But because I was using the GNU step environment, it kind of felt like a history lesson.

597
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:07,440
It felt like I was studying a dead language in some ways.

598
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:08,440
The GNU step?

599
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:09,440
So, I looked into...

600
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:13,760
If you want to get a modern GNU step live environment, I believe it was last updated

601
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:14,760
in 2017.

602
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:15,760
So, yeah.

603
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:16,760
I looked into that.

604
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:20,720
Yeah, but it's packaged up like the, you know, the compiler and the runtimes and stuff, packaged

605
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:21,720
up in Debian, no problem.

606
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:23,840
So, I was able to pull those down.

607
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:24,840
Got a couple of things compiling.

608
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:29,240
You know, I did Hello World, and as Mike asked, I was playing around with some of the message

609
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:34,280
passing and stuff, which is, I mean, honestly, I can see why Mike loves Objective-C.

610
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:38,760
Now, for me, it was kind of a low level, going back to a little lower level of software in

611
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:39,760
a little bit.

612
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:42,160
Well, it is, what, 30 years old, isn't it?

613
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:43,160
Yeah.

614
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:49,880
But comparing it to C++, as was kind of done at the time, it's remarkably simple.

615
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:53,680
So, you know, even for needing to have a bunch of sort of inherent complexity, because it

616
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:58,480
is lower level, you know, it is targeting sort of complicated environments and doing

617
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:02,960
so in an older style, and running closer to the metal, it's still, I mean, it's still

618
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:05,080
surprisingly civilized, I would say.

619
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:06,160
And would you agree with me, Mike?

620
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:07,920
Is that kind of what you feel about it?

621
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:13,160
I'm sorry, I'm tearing up because it warms my heart that it's 2019, and I somehow got

622
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:14,160
someone to do Objective-C.

623
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:20,600
You know, I find it kind of ironic even that it became popular because of the iPhone, which

624
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:21,600
is such a modern device.

625
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:22,600
It's so weird.

626
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:26,960
It's such a, it's that whole story, and the fact that Java on Android, it's such a...

627
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:29,160
Those are not, it's not how I would have predicted it going.

628
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:30,160
Right, you wouldn't think so.

629
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:31,160
At all.

630
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:34,680
So it's interesting because one, I actually, I didn't say anything to you while you were

631
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:35,920
doing it.

632
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:40,880
I did not expect you to go the GNU step route, because that's actually the harder path.

633
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:43,520
You could have been helping me this whole time, Mr. Dominic.

634
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:47,080
Well, no, it's, well, the option was also set up a Mac VM, which I don't know how hard

635
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:48,080
or easy that would be, right?

636
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,080
So...

637
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:53,440
Honestly, I do kind of want to, I need one of those anyway, not need, but it would be

638
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:54,440
fun to have.

639
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:55,440
I've hackintoshed in the past.

640
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:56,440
So that's in my book.

641
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:57,440
Well, I get mine finalized.

642
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:58,440
Oh, yeah.

643
00:27:58,440 --> 00:27:59,440
Yeah.

644
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:03,620
I agree with everything you said, and I would even wonder if you could expound more on the,

645
00:28:03,620 --> 00:28:05,000
it felt like going back in time.

646
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:12,160
Because I actually think Objective-C is a language that is unabashedly from the early

647
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:13,160
90s.

648
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:17,360
And I know it was older than that, but really, that's when, yes, you know, there were updates

649
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:21,880
later on when the iPhone came out, but it's core, it's concepts, the way it thinks about

650
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:22,880
programming, right?

651
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:25,960
It's direct ancestor is Smalltalk, right?

652
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:29,440
It's like Smalltalk and C++, kind of.

653
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:36,360
But basically, it says that we are object-oriented, but we are a small language, right?

654
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:38,680
I mean, how did you feel about just the size of the language?

655
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:42,080
Yeah, it doesn't, you know, it's not super weighed down by a ton of stuff.

656
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:46,360
And obviously, you know, you get more of that if you're targeting, you know, the Mac ecosystem

657
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:48,680
and using a bunch of their libraries on top.

658
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:53,440
But yeah, you know, C was, I think, the first programming language that, like, you could

659
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:57,080
really count if we don't count Visual Basic Sex, which I don't think we should.

660
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:58,080
What about Real Basic?

661
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:01,280
Half counts, half counts.

662
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:03,760
So it did, you know, it was kind of nice.

663
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:07,760
All of my more recent, you know, low-level experiments have been playing around with

664
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:14,640
Rust or I have done some C++ a few years ago, and I don't have a strong desire to go back.

665
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:15,640
Interesting.

666
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:19,560
I think I could handle Objective-C. I mean, these days, you know, it probably be, it would

667
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:25,560
probably be Swift, but it was an interesting contrast because using the message-passing

668
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:30,280
system it's, and you know, and some of the inheritance from Smalltalk, even for being

669
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:34,200
a low-level compiled language, it's surprisingly dynamic.

670
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:37,720
And I think you miss out on a lot of that, for better and for worse.

671
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:42,120
I mean, there are lots of good things about the extra, you know, static-ness and safety

672
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:48,360
of Swift, but it's an interesting throwback or, you know, it has such a unique place in

673
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:52,920
the landscape of programming language design, and I think it's interesting how popular it

674
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:55,120
got from kind of obscure origins.

675
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:58,240
I have a couple of questions for you.

676
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:03,240
So the second question I'll do first, how cool is it that you can go like back in time

677
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:08,040
with some of this stuff and not, like GnuStep is fairly well-preserved, but not everything

678
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:09,040
is.

679
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:11,400
Like, we need to do better at preserving these things and having ways to stand these up.

680
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:15,520
Well, yeah, I mean, I know like with Smalltalk there's similar things where you can get some

681
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:19,760
of the images and get them to run, and there's even, I forget the name of it, but there's

682
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:22,400
some like modern distributions of it.

683
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:26,920
It is interesting though, because you have different eras of computing, and you can contrast

684
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:30,880
that with, say, looking back at Android versions, which is like impossible, because so much

685
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:34,640
of it is online that you just can't really preserve that environment, so it's nice when

686
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:38,640
you have some of these older languages because they weren't, they just weren't connected

687
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:39,640
systems, right?

688
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:40,640
It's all standalone.

689
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:46,360
As long as you have the source material, and because it was added as part of the GNU project,

690
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:48,680
you know, that's free, so it's preserved.

691
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:54,120
It would be so cool if there was like some archive.org style project that would create

692
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:58,960
like maybe a Linux environment VM snapshot of something in time and then make it available,

693
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:02,480
and you could just start up the entire environment from that time or something.

694
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:06,040
Maybe like a little interactive thing you could go through and maybe explore what made

695
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:08,560
that language unique or explore that environment.

696
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:14,680
Okay, so my first question was, as somebody who's got no experience at this, object-oriented

697
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:22,280
seems like it would get very complex after a while, like is that, can you, am I wrong?

698
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:25,560
Seems like, it seems like for something simple, no problem, you can keep the whole thing in

699
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:30,160
your head, but you start to get to something that's fairly, even somewhat complicated,

700
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:33,680
it seems like it would just become a massive thing to keep track of that you wouldn't be

701
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:35,120
able to keep it all in your head.

702
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:36,120
That's why FP exists.

703
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:37,120
What is FP?

704
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:41,240
Yeah, it sounds like, it sounds like you should stay tuned for the next episode of Coderradio,

705
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:45,320
Chris, because we're going to have a little conversation about functional programming

706
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:50,160
and object-oriented programming and how they fit together and maybe how to combine the

707
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:51,160
paradigms a bit.

708
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:52,160
I like that.

709
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,160
Hey guys, good idea.

710
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:54,160
Well played.

711
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:55,160
Well played.

712
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:59,440
Interestingly, I think Objective-C is kind of neat because like, again, comparing it

713
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:04,480
to C++, the message passing style is just, it just feels a little simpler.

714
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:08,960
So I can see that aiding, and then there's just lots of, you know, you get design patterns

715
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:13,920
and paradigms that one applies for certain abstractions to try to, you know, detangle

716
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:14,920
some of that mess.

717
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:19,720
So do you think for a junior developer, there would be any value in saying, you know what,

718
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:24,560
just for like a weekend, stand up a good new step environment on your arch distro, because

719
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:28,840
that's what you all seem to run and, you know, go back in time?

720
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:30,920
I mean, I got Debian 10 on here.

721
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:31,920
I'm on Debian.

722
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:32,920
Oh, Debian.

723
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:36,000
You know what, you're on the cutting edge, man, Debian.

724
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,640
Debian 10 just came out this weekend.

725
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:38,640
I know.

726
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:39,640
See?

727
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:40,640
Damn it, they got me again.

728
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:41,640
That's amazing.

729
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:42,640
Hey, I'm running Windows.

730
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:43,640
Come on.

731
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:48,760
You know, I would say if they're interested in doing iOS development, yeah, maybe.

732
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:51,800
Like it could be interesting from that perspective as a way to get the toe in the water.

733
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:56,800
If you're just interested from like the historical language stuff, maybe it's better to just

734
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:58,560
play with Smalltalk directly.

735
00:32:58,560 --> 00:32:59,560
Interesting.

736
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:00,560
Okay.

737
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:02,280
But I mean, it's easy enough.

738
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:05,000
No, I don't think I wouldn't dissuade someone from doing it.

739
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
I certainly enjoyed it.

740
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,000
And it might be worthwhile.

741
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:11,760
I mean, I guess even with Swift, it's good to know a little objectivity, right?

742
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:13,160
Just enough to read it, let's say.

743
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:15,400
Oh, I think that's definitely the case.

744
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:16,400
Yeah.

745
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:17,900
That's not going away anytime soon.

746
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:20,480
You're working on a project that's been around for a little bit.

747
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:23,080
Arm six, arm transition.

748
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:27,800
You know, I was also pretty impressed with, I mean, one, it was a stark reminder of the

749
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:32,200
weird history Apple's had with the open source community and some of the license battles

750
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:37,600
and the transition away from GPL software as they distribute it and LLVM and its rise

751
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:38,600
to fame.

752
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:41,280
Like all of that happens in the Objective-C history as well, right?

753
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:43,000
It's part and parcel of that.

754
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Yep.

755
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,040
It's tied to Apple's history.

756
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:47,080
So it's fun to look at that way, too.

757
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:50,880
It's the same reason you can't have a good version of Bash on Mac.

758
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:57,400
All right, well, do we know what Mike's challenge is going to be?

759
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:58,400
Oh, no.

760
00:33:58,400 --> 00:33:59,720
Oh, yes, we do.

761
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:02,580
Now just a little public service announcement.

762
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:05,580
Next week's episode, because of travel, will be prerecorded.

763
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:08,760
So the challenge will be taking a week off.

764
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:09,760
That's right.

765
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:10,760
So there'll be a break there because-

766
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:11,760
Yeah, Mike's going to get a little extra time.

767
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:14,280
Yeah, we're about to record next week's episode in just a little bit.

768
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:16,160
Oh, I won't be here, but they are.

769
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:17,760
Yeah, it'll be.

770
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:20,480
Actually I think it's going to fit in just fine.

771
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:25,960
As you'll see, this is perhaps overdue, but Mike, you got me with Objective-C. So I'm

772
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:30,720
going to give you something close to my own heart, Clojure is your choice this week.

773
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:31,720
Fair enough.

774
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:32,720
I did this to myself.

775
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:33,720
Okay.

776
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:34,720
Yeah.

777
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:35,720
Yeah.

778
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:38,920
So do you want me to give you some starting resources or should I leave you to fend in

779
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:40,360
the fields of Google?

780
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:41,360
You know what?

781
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:44,800
Leave me in the woods because I want to see someone who doesn't know Clojure, where do

782
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:45,800
they go?

783
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:46,800
Okay.

784
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:50,320
Yeah, actually I'm going to be interested to see what you find.

785
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:52,680
You might come across to Westpain Talk if you look hard enough.

786
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:54,960
Oh, now I'll be looking for it.

787
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:59,120
I love it.

788
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:05,120
You both held on to these particular choices much longer than I expected, kept your powder

789
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:06,120
dry for a while.

790
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:07,780
It's all about the slow play.

791
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:08,780
This is the peak now.

792
00:35:08,780 --> 00:35:12,160
Now you're just going to be throwing random things at each other.

793
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:15,080
Now we're going to go for the most annoying language as possible after this, I think.

794
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:16,680
How about the old-scat language?

795
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:20,200
Oh yeah, I mean brain could be included as well.

796
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:21,200
That's a classic.

797
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:22,200
Wonderful.

798
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:25,040
Hey guys, I always appreciate letting me hang out for a bit.

799
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:26,040
It's always nice.

800
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:27,040
Oh, it's fun.

801
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:28,040
Thank you for joining us.

802
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:29,040
Oh no, you quit it.

803
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:31,520
Did you know that we have a great website where people can get all kinds of resources?

804
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:32,520
I think it's coder.show.

805
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:38,400
Coder.show, you can find our RSS feed, you can find ways to contact us, and you can find

806
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:43,360
the whole back catalog of Coder Radio episodes, and I mean, there's a whole bunch of them,

807
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:44,360
so go start listening.

808
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:47,040
You know, we should take a moment too, Mike, if you've got things going on, anything you

809
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:51,400
want to mention or send the listeners, take a moment because we've got a space right here

810
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:53,000
just for you to let them know about it.

811
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,000
Oh, beautiful.

812
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,080
Check out at Team Unico on Twitter and check out themadbotter.com.

813
00:35:57,080 --> 00:36:02,080
We're going to have some cool stuff in about, well I guess since we're doing a time delay,

814
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:03,080
four weeks.

815
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:04,080
Oh.

816
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:07,880
It's better just to follow and see what happens over there.

817
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:09,000
Then you know, yeah.

818
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:12,400
But you can always bookmark it, just check back in a couple of weeks.

819
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:13,400
Easily done.

820
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:17,440
I'll plug, see what do I want, I'll plug at Chris Elias, and also, I'm going to plug

821
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:19,000
user air.

822
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,280
Such a good show.

823
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:22,600
That is like, such a good show.

824
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:26,440
Go check out the most recent episode, and then if you like it, go check out the back

825
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:27,440
catalog.

826
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:29,080
But oh man, such a good show.

827
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:30,920
So we don't give it enough attention.

828
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:31,920
It's great, yeah.

829
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:34,920
And it's a fun diversion, it's a little different than a lot of the other shows on the network,

830
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:38,280
so if you're tired of hearing about tech news, go get some real life news.

831
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:39,280
Error.show.

832
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:41,760
I'm on Twitter too, I'm at WestPain.

833
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:42,760
What?

834
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:43,760
Really?

835
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:46,000
I'm going to go plug your show, Linux Action News.

836
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:51,200
I really enjoyed this week's episode, especially your well-reasoned breakdown of this whole

837
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:53,200
DNS over HTTPS debacle.

838
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:55,200
Oh, Mozilla's an evil Mozilla.

839
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:58,520
Some told me we're going to talk more about this topic.

840
00:36:58,520 --> 00:36:59,520
Yeah, yeah.

841
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:04,600
Yeah, Internet the Mozilla villain is really all kind of just way out there, and so it

842
