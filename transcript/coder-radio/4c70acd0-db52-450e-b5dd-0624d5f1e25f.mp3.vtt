00:00.000 --> 00:10.000
This is KOTOR Radio, episode 482 for September 5th, 2022.

00:10.000 --> 00:20.080
Hey good buddy, welcome back to Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show, taking a pragmatic look

00:20.080 --> 00:25.000
at the art and the business of software development and the world of technology.

00:25.000 --> 00:28.920
My name is Chris over here on the West Coast and our hostess with the mostest over on the

00:28.920 --> 00:30.640
East Coast, it's Mr. Dominic.

00:30.640 --> 00:31.640
Hello Mike.

00:31.640 --> 00:35.160
Happy Labor Day greetings for Florida, where we don't believe in paid time off unless you're

00:35.160 --> 00:36.160
retired.

00:36.160 --> 00:38.160
Or in podcasting either, have you noticed?

00:38.160 --> 00:39.160
Yes.

00:39.160 --> 00:40.160
The only holiday we take is Christmas.

00:40.160 --> 00:41.160
We take Christmas, yes.

00:41.160 --> 00:42.160
Yeah.

00:42.160 --> 00:43.160
Yeah.

00:43.160 --> 00:46.560
I don't think we do a show on Thanksgiving, but that's just because we both like to eat.

00:46.560 --> 00:47.560
Yeah.

00:47.560 --> 00:49.760
We've got to make room for the food.

00:49.760 --> 00:50.760
How are you feeling?

00:50.760 --> 00:51.760
You sound a little stuffed up.

00:51.760 --> 00:52.760
A little stuffed up.

00:52.760 --> 00:58.140
You know, I went to TCGCon last week and one thing that comes with those great in-person

00:58.140 --> 00:59.680
events is the conference flu.

00:59.680 --> 01:00.680
Yeah.

01:00.680 --> 01:02.160
You always got to get, remember we used to call that the con crud.

01:02.160 --> 01:03.160
Now we just call it COVID.

01:03.160 --> 01:04.160
Oh, oh.

01:04.160 --> 01:06.320
How did it go though?

01:06.320 --> 01:08.280
Would you do it again knowing you're going to get sick?

01:08.280 --> 01:09.280
Last week was TCGCon.

01:09.280 --> 01:10.280
It went great.

01:10.280 --> 01:11.280
We talked about it.

01:11.280 --> 01:16.280
This weekend was the Dominaria United MTG pre-release.

01:16.280 --> 01:18.920
Oh, whoa, whoa.

01:18.920 --> 01:21.560
I did two weeks in a row.

01:21.560 --> 01:23.520
This is another magic event.

01:23.520 --> 01:24.520
Another magic event.

01:24.520 --> 01:28.480
I did two days of planes walking and tapping that mana.

01:28.480 --> 01:30.400
I tapped that mana so hard.

01:30.400 --> 01:32.760
It was amazing.

01:32.760 --> 01:36.320
So Squirrely Dave was asking for stats.

01:36.320 --> 01:37.320
Here we go.

01:37.320 --> 01:39.760
Five and O, standard.

01:39.760 --> 01:40.760
Boom.

01:40.760 --> 01:41.760
Won that one.

01:41.760 --> 01:42.760
Ha!

01:42.760 --> 01:46.860
Did a sealed arena sealed, which is the digital version.

01:46.860 --> 01:47.860
Five and three.

01:47.860 --> 01:48.860
That's not a win.

01:48.860 --> 01:49.860
All right.

01:49.860 --> 01:53.000
Did a in-person sealed.

01:53.000 --> 01:54.600
Five and two.

01:54.600 --> 01:58.520
Some reason the arena always has until you lose to three.

01:58.520 --> 02:00.200
The in-person one is based on who shows up.

02:00.200 --> 02:02.520
So that was okay.

02:02.520 --> 02:06.880
I will say that five is my lucky number.

02:06.880 --> 02:13.080
I think what happens is as I progress through the day into the evening, I get more tired.

02:13.080 --> 02:14.080
Sure.

02:14.080 --> 02:16.320
And just a little more lazy.

02:16.320 --> 02:18.020
So yeah, also played some Commander.

02:18.020 --> 02:19.720
It was a long weekend.

02:19.720 --> 02:23.540
If you stay at it, you can probably overcome some of that sleepiness.

02:23.540 --> 02:25.160
You can probably train that out a little bit.

02:25.160 --> 02:27.440
But also, you just kind of started this.

02:27.440 --> 02:28.440
You're doing pretty good.

02:28.440 --> 02:29.440
Right?

02:29.440 --> 02:30.440
This is the second event.

02:30.440 --> 02:31.440
You're doing pretty good.

02:31.440 --> 02:32.440
Pretty excited.

02:32.440 --> 02:36.240
I'm going to, you know, the COVID gods permitting, I'm going to go to TamperNerdCon in November.

02:36.240 --> 02:38.240
I'm playing in two events there.

02:38.240 --> 02:39.240
Yeah.

02:39.240 --> 02:40.240
Ha!

02:40.240 --> 02:41.240
Oh, man.

02:41.240 --> 02:42.240
That's great.

02:42.240 --> 02:43.240
Well.

02:43.240 --> 02:44.240
Well.

02:44.240 --> 02:45.240
I'm looking forward to hearing how that goes.

02:45.240 --> 02:46.240
Yeah.

02:46.240 --> 02:47.240
Come on, folks.

02:47.240 --> 02:48.240
Hit me up on arena.

02:48.240 --> 02:49.240
Let's do this.

02:49.240 --> 02:50.240
Oh, gosh.

02:50.240 --> 02:51.240
Oh, no.

02:51.240 --> 02:52.240
This is going to become a whole thing.

02:52.240 --> 02:53.240
All right.

02:53.240 --> 02:59.200
Well, moving right along before it takes roots, ChunkyPie wrote in about RSI and he had a

02:59.200 --> 03:00.200
few hot tips.

03:00.200 --> 03:01.200
He's in his 40s.

03:01.200 --> 03:04.160
He's been using keyboards since high school.

03:04.160 --> 03:06.960
And of course, every job he's ever had, keyboards.

03:06.960 --> 03:10.280
He's now learning to become a developer, keyboards.

03:10.280 --> 03:13.440
And his big lesson, he says, is the ergonomics really matter.

03:13.440 --> 03:16.760
And the sooner you start taking the ergonomics seriously, the better off you likely will

03:16.760 --> 03:17.760
be.

03:17.760 --> 03:20.120
And as he puts it, keyboards aren't going to go away anytime soon.

03:20.120 --> 03:22.640
So it's best to adapt your workspace now to optimize.

03:22.640 --> 03:25.000
We got a few notes on the RSI subject.

03:25.000 --> 03:26.320
So thank you, everybody.

03:26.320 --> 03:30.160
I appreciate your thoughts there because I agree with the sentiment, like take advantage,

03:30.160 --> 03:33.280
get yourself a good working setup today.

03:33.280 --> 03:37.060
And it's sort of like an investment in your tools, which is your body parts.

03:37.060 --> 03:38.280
We also got some feedback from Adam.

03:38.280 --> 03:40.440
He says, hey, guys, love the show.

03:40.440 --> 03:45.600
For RSI issues, well, it's taken me a few years, but I think I found the perfect solution,

03:45.600 --> 03:47.400
at least in my case.

03:47.400 --> 03:50.920
My desk chair is actually a Staples gaming chair, which has the armrest sitting at the

03:50.920 --> 03:52.880
same height as my desk.

03:52.880 --> 03:57.920
For keyboards, I need a split ortholinear keyboard that lets you split or rebound.

03:57.920 --> 03:58.920
I have two mice.

03:58.920 --> 04:03.520
I switch between them, a Logitech MX Master as my main, and then I have an Anker ergonomic

04:03.520 --> 04:05.280
vertical mouse.

04:05.280 --> 04:09.960
Using this combination has cured 95% of my RSI.

04:09.960 --> 04:11.840
And actually, I'll jump in there, Adam.

04:11.840 --> 04:13.460
I also do this at home.

04:13.460 --> 04:15.080
For some reason, I don't do it much at work.

04:15.080 --> 04:17.240
But at home, I switch between two different mice.

04:17.240 --> 04:21.040
I have the MX vertical, and I have a trackpad.

04:21.040 --> 04:23.680
I think the trackpad is probably harder on my hands overall.

04:23.680 --> 04:26.600
The verticals are really cool mice if you've never seen those.

04:26.600 --> 04:32.860
They look weird, but they really work because you change how you move the mouse.

04:32.860 --> 04:36.600
Instead of a side-to-side wrist action, it's a side-to-side arm action.

04:36.600 --> 04:39.440
It's much easier on the old wrist.

04:39.440 --> 04:41.640
And then there was a topic, Mike, that I talked about.

04:41.640 --> 04:45.720
Just this is what I effing love about this show.

04:45.720 --> 04:50.440
You and I will just randomly toss something out there just as an aside, and then the audience

04:50.440 --> 04:51.440
takes and runs with it.

04:51.440 --> 04:52.760
Because we've got some boosts about this, too.

04:52.760 --> 04:53.760
And Adam wrote in on email.

04:53.760 --> 04:58.840
He says, on the topic of uniforms, I can't believe this, but we had multiple people writing

04:58.840 --> 05:01.280
about uniforms.

05:01.280 --> 05:02.280
I touched on something.

05:02.280 --> 05:03.280
I don't know.

05:03.280 --> 05:04.960
Maybe there's something to it.

05:04.960 --> 05:09.240
Adam says, my daily work uniform is a black t-shirt, black cargo shorts, black socks,

05:09.240 --> 05:11.120
and dark blue shoes.

05:11.120 --> 05:15.440
I work construction, so all black hides the copious amounts of sweating that I do.

05:15.440 --> 05:19.320
With my regular clothes, it's mostly just jeans and khakis and a white or black t-shirt.

05:19.320 --> 05:22.640
I do have a few novelty shirts, like he has his old Last Tux t-shirt.

05:22.640 --> 05:25.320
But he kind of has like, I don't know if I'd call that a uniform.

05:25.320 --> 05:29.080
He kind of has like a set of small range of clothing.

05:29.080 --> 05:30.560
That is almost too complicated for me.

05:30.560 --> 05:33.360
I want just like the same thing all the time, almost.

05:33.360 --> 05:34.680
But we'll see.

05:34.680 --> 05:35.680
We'll come back to that later.

05:35.680 --> 05:37.120
And then Adam had, he had three points.

05:37.120 --> 05:38.760
This is his third point, his last point.

05:38.760 --> 05:40.600
And this one he's taken us to task on.

05:40.600 --> 05:44.160
On a side note, why is everyone raving about the launch keyboard?

05:44.160 --> 05:49.480
I know it's made by System76, but I've seen that build quality and that layout before.

05:49.480 --> 05:52.840
Also, the firmware isn't as open source as everyone claims.

05:52.840 --> 05:54.840
It's based off of QMK.

05:54.840 --> 05:55.840
That is open source.

05:55.840 --> 05:58.840
Also, I'm not sure if you all mentioned it, but I don't think they're going to be able

05:58.840 --> 06:01.840
to support wireless anytime soon because of QMK.

06:01.840 --> 06:04.880
I don't mean to rain on anyone's parade, but I have been in the mechanical keyboard world

06:04.880 --> 06:10.840
for several years and the launch isn't anything new, but keep up the great work.

06:10.840 --> 06:18.960
So I thought this is an interesting little snapshot here because Adam mentions the build

06:18.960 --> 06:25.000
quality before, but I don't think he's ever owned a launch and I'm holding the launch

06:25.000 --> 06:26.000
right now in my hands.

06:26.000 --> 06:29.160
And so I don't know how he can comment on the build quality, which is excellent.

06:29.160 --> 06:31.480
But you know, there's an interesting thing here.

06:31.480 --> 06:34.120
It's like I went and did a little digging around on the open source stuff.

06:34.120 --> 06:38.800
It looks like projects that integrate with the launch, like the keyboard configurator,

06:38.800 --> 06:43.960
it's GPL, the FWEPD stuff is all GPL, the layout, the design, the CAD drawings, that's

06:43.960 --> 06:44.960
all GPL.

06:44.960 --> 06:48.280
I don't know if everything in the firmware is GPL.

06:48.280 --> 06:53.400
I don't really know if it's further than any other keyboard vendor or most keyboard vendors

06:53.400 --> 06:55.640
take it, is that good enough?

06:55.640 --> 06:56.640
Is that where that line is?

06:56.640 --> 07:02.200
And then the other thing is, if somebody else has made a keyboard like this, it doesn't

07:02.200 --> 07:06.320
really matter if System76 is introducing it to a new market, a market that maybe hasn't

07:06.320 --> 07:11.400
bought that stuff before, but trust the build of System76, so they're willing to spend that

07:11.400 --> 07:14.560
money on a keyboard when maybe they weren't before, because that's me.

07:14.560 --> 07:17.800
It was just about the time the launch came around where, you guys know on the history

07:17.800 --> 07:21.680
of the show, I was starting to just consider mechanical keyboards for my RSI, and they

07:21.680 --> 07:24.160
happened to just nail the timing with the launch.

07:24.160 --> 07:28.560
But I was never in that market really before, and it kind of opened my eyes to that.

07:28.560 --> 07:29.560
Yeah.

07:29.560 --> 07:32.720
I mean, the other thing is, you know, longtime listeners know that there used to be a brand

07:32.720 --> 07:35.880
of mechanical keyboard that I religiously used.

07:35.880 --> 07:40.320
People they sense, I don't know if they got a PE bio or what happened, but their quality

07:40.320 --> 07:45.480
has just gone way down in recent years, and they've focused on kind of more whiz-bangy

07:45.480 --> 07:46.480
features.

07:46.480 --> 07:48.560
I don't know, more competition's good, right?

07:48.560 --> 07:54.840
I think I'm using the launch, I'm still testing out the launch small one, the Lite, with the

07:54.840 --> 07:55.840
pink switches.

07:55.840 --> 07:57.200
I think it's pretty good.

07:57.200 --> 08:00.200
I prefer the bigger one because I like the USB hub.

08:00.200 --> 08:04.840
One fair point in his email, though, yeah, right, wireless would be better, but then

08:04.840 --> 08:07.200
you lose the USB hub.

08:07.200 --> 08:11.360
But for the Lite, definitely wireless, because there is no hub.

08:11.360 --> 08:16.480
Still, I kind of like the idea of there's lots of different configurations, lots of

08:16.480 --> 08:19.980
different keyboards made by lots of different vendors, and you just got to find the right

08:19.980 --> 08:20.980
one for you.

08:20.980 --> 08:22.160
It's like building your lightsaber.

08:22.160 --> 08:26.920
Yeah, and you know, there's lots of different hands, and different hands fit better with

08:26.920 --> 08:27.920
different lightsabers.

08:27.920 --> 08:28.920
Right.

08:28.920 --> 08:30.440
Not every Batlet is for you.

08:30.440 --> 08:31.780
You have to find the right one.

08:31.780 --> 08:33.260
Let me tell you.

08:33.260 --> 08:34.260
Let me tell you.

08:34.260 --> 08:35.440
One ear's sewed back on.

08:35.440 --> 08:36.440
Let me tell you.

08:36.440 --> 08:37.440
Exactly.

08:37.440 --> 08:38.440
Not my ear.

08:38.440 --> 08:39.440
Not my ear, of course.

08:39.440 --> 08:40.520
And everybody's different.

08:40.520 --> 08:43.560
We all have different appearances, heights, weights.

08:43.560 --> 08:45.960
For instance, take a look at Takuvma and Kalish.

08:45.960 --> 08:47.480
How much more different could you get?

08:47.480 --> 08:49.680
Yeah, I agree with you there.

08:49.680 --> 08:55.120
So speaking of keeping things similar, perhaps even uniform, DeckBot wrote in about the uniform

08:55.120 --> 08:56.120
lifestyle.

08:56.120 --> 08:58.640
He says, you were discussing the uniform lifestyle.

08:58.640 --> 09:03.020
Where I come from, like my work, there's no such requirement, but I do occasionally travel

09:03.020 --> 09:06.400
for customers, so I'm allotted five free t-shirts a year.

09:06.400 --> 09:10.840
The choices between salesy, a white or blue button-down shirts with tastefully embroidered

09:10.840 --> 09:15.120
logos on the breast, or just black polos featuring the embroidered logo.

09:15.120 --> 09:18.920
Naturally, I chose the black polos since the customer portion of the floor is typically

09:18.920 --> 09:22.900
a dirty industrial environment where everything is coated in metal dust, especially the Linux

09:22.900 --> 09:26.040
welders I'm working with.

09:26.040 --> 09:27.040
Right on, DeckBot.

09:27.040 --> 09:28.480
Tell me more about that.

09:28.480 --> 09:32.440
After a decade of free polos, my wardrobe evolved into a collage of corporate black

09:32.440 --> 09:37.480
polos with generations of marketing and obsoleted logos and slogans that generally pair well

09:37.480 --> 09:39.740
with jeans.

09:39.740 --> 09:41.440
That hits, right?

09:41.440 --> 09:42.440
That hits.

09:42.440 --> 09:47.260
A decade of free polos, my wardrobe has evolved into a collage of corporate black polos with

09:47.260 --> 09:50.440
generations of marketing and obsoleted logos.

09:50.440 --> 09:51.440
That hits.

09:51.440 --> 09:52.440
That hits.

09:52.440 --> 09:53.440
Okay.

09:53.440 --> 09:59.740
He says, in the morning, my choices devolved into what is clean and how old is the logo?

09:59.740 --> 10:00.740
That also hits.

10:00.740 --> 10:04.480
He says, I tend to hang the clean laundry in the back of the closet and just pull shirts

10:04.480 --> 10:06.680
from the front so all shirts are cycled evenly.

10:06.680 --> 10:07.840
I try to do something similar.

10:07.840 --> 10:11.580
He says, I hear JB has a bunch of shirt merch on some websites.

10:11.580 --> 10:15.240
Five to 10 shirts should set you up for daily wear, leaving you nerd shirts for special

10:15.240 --> 10:18.000
occasions, save from daily wear, tear, and abuse.

10:18.000 --> 10:21.400
Thanks for all the shows, DeckBot.

10:21.400 --> 10:24.480
This is something a couple of people touched on is, maybe I should buy my own swag.

10:24.480 --> 10:29.600
I do actually have pretty much all my clothes on my own swag, but they're all old swag.

10:29.600 --> 10:33.400
I feel like I need to do a whole new refurb and then just buy a bunch of them.

10:33.400 --> 10:35.040
But we'll see.

10:35.040 --> 10:36.360
I appreciate the thoughts on uniforms.

10:36.360 --> 10:39.760
We'll leave it there until we get to the boosts for now, but please do keep it coming.

10:39.760 --> 10:41.280
Although, I haven't talked to you about it.

10:41.280 --> 10:43.360
I don't know if it's possible.

10:43.360 --> 10:47.120
At some point in the next two weeks, it'd be really great if we record a double.

10:47.120 --> 10:50.920
You don't have to, but it would just make travel time a little easier that first week.

10:50.920 --> 10:51.920
Yeah, sure.

10:51.920 --> 10:52.920
Let's do it.

10:52.920 --> 10:56.320
So I'm thinking we need the audience to send in as many boosts and contact forms as possible

10:56.320 --> 11:01.000
to help fill our bags, so that way we have plenty to go through, so that way we don't

11:01.000 --> 11:03.280
miss a beat on the prerecords.

11:03.280 --> 11:09.920
And then our last email today comes in from Daniel, and he wants to talk about remote

11:09.920 --> 11:10.920
work.

11:10.920 --> 11:14.760
And I've been kind of thinning these out, not really including most of these, but he

11:14.760 --> 11:18.200
touched on one thing in here that put it over the line, so I wanted to conclude it in the

11:18.200 --> 11:19.200
show.

11:19.200 --> 11:22.480
He writes, I've been listening for a good five years at this point, and I really love

11:22.480 --> 11:23.480
the show.

11:23.480 --> 11:25.240
I wanted to comment on the remote debate.

11:25.240 --> 11:29.600
I will concede that the tooling is good enough to get the job done effectively.

11:29.600 --> 11:32.040
That even includes pair programming.

11:32.040 --> 11:37.600
Nevertheless, losing the social side of things is a deterrent to the work culture.

11:37.600 --> 11:41.520
If you like to play pickleball after work, for example, I might be a little nicer about

11:41.520 --> 11:45.280
the fact that you're failing to execute and putting me behind on something.

11:45.280 --> 11:50.400
But if you're just a name on a screen, well, you're getting blamed in the nicest way I

11:50.400 --> 11:51.960
can think to do so.

11:51.960 --> 11:57.200
Chris, you've called this out before, when we see each other as humans, we work better

11:57.200 --> 12:00.840
and it's very hard to see each other as humans if all we do is talk to each other during

12:00.840 --> 12:04.440
a stand up, even if you have a stand up meeting.

12:04.440 --> 12:08.320
Some of us actually like people.

12:08.320 --> 12:12.740
Daniel has touched on something that I want to phrase a little bit differently than throw

12:12.740 --> 12:14.720
it at you.

12:14.720 --> 12:16.900
I have experienced this with myself.

12:16.900 --> 12:23.120
When I have met someone in person and I conceptualize them as a three dimensional human being that

12:23.120 --> 12:28.760
has an entire life and problems and I actually see it and I learn a little bit about them,

12:28.760 --> 12:34.920
maybe I spend some time with them, I am more generous in a text only conversation.

12:34.920 --> 12:37.560
I am more generous about things slipping.

12:37.560 --> 12:44.060
I am more understanding about their situation versus before then, even though if you would

12:44.060 --> 12:47.560
have asked me before I had met them, I would have told you I was doing those things because

12:47.560 --> 12:49.680
I honestly thought I was.

12:49.680 --> 12:52.960
But I was doing to the best of my ability for the character that I conceptualized in

12:52.960 --> 12:56.920
my mind that I'm interacting with in a low bandwidth means.

12:56.920 --> 13:01.040
But when I met them in person and that exchange became high bandwidth and I learned things

13:01.040 --> 13:04.520
about them, perhaps they didn't even want to volunteer, but it's just observational.

13:04.520 --> 13:12.280
I built out a more complete model of that person in my mind and that model seems to

13:12.280 --> 13:15.560
afford me more empathy for them now.

13:15.560 --> 13:19.120
And I think that makes a big difference in the workplace and the only way you can have

13:19.120 --> 13:24.360
it is if people spend not just like a day together, but maybe some significant amount

13:24.360 --> 13:25.360
of time together.

13:25.360 --> 13:31.360
And I think that makes for a well oiled team and again, I see it here with the JB team.

13:31.360 --> 13:37.400
When we get together for stuff, for events, the team really gels people because their

13:37.400 --> 13:43.220
friendships really kind of reignite, it really kind of gets people fired up for a while.

13:43.220 --> 13:49.140
And it's just there's no way of replicating it online hard as we might try.

13:49.140 --> 13:52.480
And that has made them more productive and it's true for all businesses I've ever been

13:52.480 --> 13:53.480
involved in.

13:53.480 --> 13:54.480
And it's just inescapable.

13:54.480 --> 14:00.120
Yeah, I mean, we're never going to be able to 100% replicate the experience.

14:00.120 --> 14:05.760
I just keep falling back to it kind of doesn't really matter because the ship has already

14:05.760 --> 14:06.960
sailed.

14:06.960 --> 14:12.000
In our industry, remote work is a is a is a fait accompli for the most part.

14:12.000 --> 14:16.400
I mean, even Apple's struggling to drag people back to the office, right?

14:16.400 --> 14:19.080
It's kind of like a natural disaster happened.

14:19.080 --> 14:22.240
And now we have to deal with this and we're going to have to learn a new way.

14:22.240 --> 14:23.720
That's literally what happened.

14:23.720 --> 14:24.720
Exactly.

14:24.720 --> 14:25.720
You might be right.

14:25.720 --> 14:26.720
You might be right.

14:26.720 --> 14:27.720
I think you're right.

14:27.720 --> 14:28.720
Depending on what you think of certain lab.

14:28.720 --> 14:29.720
Heyo.

14:29.720 --> 14:30.720
Let me get the bacon.

14:30.720 --> 14:31.720
Let me get the bacon.

14:31.720 --> 14:35.120
Now, I follow what you're saying, actually.

14:35.120 --> 14:38.960
It's sort of it's like, yes, all those things are true.

14:38.960 --> 14:43.320
And still, we are going to have to figure out a way to do this.

14:43.320 --> 14:45.520
Insert standard metaverse plug here, I suppose.

14:45.520 --> 14:46.520
Well, let's do it on.

14:46.520 --> 14:47.520
You know what?

14:47.520 --> 14:50.160
Let's just do it on small scales as we can individually.

14:50.160 --> 14:53.280
Let's take it upon ourselves, individual responsibility, blah, blah, blah, blah.

14:53.280 --> 14:54.280
That's the worst.

14:54.280 --> 14:55.280
I know.

14:55.280 --> 14:56.280
Right.

14:56.280 --> 14:57.280
In other words, come hang out with us on the West Coast.

14:57.280 --> 14:58.280
We're going to be in southern Oregon.

14:58.280 --> 14:59.840
We'll be in northern California.

14:59.840 --> 15:02.640
We're doing JPL and we're doing a meet up near JPL.

15:02.640 --> 15:05.600
So even if you didn't get your name picked, you can still come hang out with us on the

15:05.600 --> 15:06.600
30th.

15:06.600 --> 15:12.440
And we'll also do another meet up in Oregon in the northern Oregon area on October 7th.

15:12.440 --> 15:15.120
All of this is at meet up dot com slash Jupiter Broadcasting.

15:15.120 --> 15:19.000
And we also have our West Coast crew where we're chatting about details, answering individual

15:19.000 --> 15:23.400
questions, bit dot l y slash West Coast crew.

15:23.400 --> 15:26.040
We'll have new swag on board, brand new swag.

15:26.040 --> 15:28.920
We'll be doing some geocaches as we go out.

15:28.920 --> 15:31.800
And of course, I'll be doing some shows on the road.

15:31.800 --> 15:34.920
In fact, starting to freak out a little bit about that.

15:34.920 --> 15:37.960
So, you know, send us in your feedback.

15:37.960 --> 15:41.000
Coder dot show slash contact or send us in a boost.

15:41.000 --> 15:43.040
New podcast apps dot com.

15:43.040 --> 15:48.440
More appreciated than ever when I'm out there burning gas on the road.

15:48.440 --> 15:50.520
Linode dot com slash Coder.

15:50.520 --> 15:53.420
That's where you go to get one hundred dollars in 60 day credit on a new account.

15:53.420 --> 15:56.480
And it's just a great way to support the show while you're checking something really awesome

15:56.480 --> 15:57.480
out.

15:57.480 --> 15:59.160
I love Linode.

15:59.160 --> 16:01.880
And what does love got to do with it?

16:01.880 --> 16:08.840
I mean, you might just think it's an old fashioned notion, but I'll tell you, love is performance.

16:08.840 --> 16:11.040
Love is knowing you're supported.

16:11.040 --> 16:16.080
Love is knowing that there are 11 data centers around the world dutifully serving your data

16:16.080 --> 16:20.960
up to your customers, your clients, your friends and your family or yourself.

16:20.960 --> 16:27.160
Linode's been building servers designed to run Linux in the cloud the fastest, most reliable

16:27.160 --> 16:32.400
and most economical way possible for nearly 19 years.

16:32.400 --> 16:34.480
That's why I say go try it for yourself.

16:34.480 --> 16:40.000
That hundred dollars will really let you actually try it at Linode dot com slash Coder.

16:40.000 --> 16:42.400
I like to mention the stuff that appeals to me.

16:42.400 --> 16:45.980
And like one of the very first things that always comes to mind is the performance that

16:45.980 --> 16:47.240
really does stand out.

16:47.240 --> 16:53.320
But you know, we're almost three years into this and it has been perfect, really.

16:53.320 --> 16:58.000
I mean, I do not regret a single moment of hosting, feel even more fired up and passionate

16:58.000 --> 17:02.040
about that choice as time has gone on.

17:02.040 --> 17:07.520
And as a business owner, but even just as, you know, an enthusiast, when you make that

17:07.520 --> 17:12.120
choice, when you make a technical foundational choice and it continues to pay off, it continues

17:12.120 --> 17:17.040
to give dividends, it continues to be a good choice, that feels really good.

17:17.040 --> 17:19.180
It's like I made the right choice there.

17:19.180 --> 17:20.180
That has been great.

17:20.180 --> 17:23.400
That's something that is not a problem I have had to deal with.

17:23.400 --> 17:26.600
And they're 30 to 50 percent cheaper than the major hyperscalers out there that just

17:26.600 --> 17:30.000
want to lock you into their duopoly platforms with their esoteric language for the crazy

17:30.000 --> 17:33.880
things they call the different services that they've ripped off from the free software

17:33.880 --> 17:34.880
community.

17:34.880 --> 17:35.880
Like that's how they make their money.

17:35.880 --> 17:39.060
And then they haven't even architected their businesses in a way where they can provide

17:39.060 --> 17:43.520
the support that you need, especially when it's something that's mission critical.

17:43.520 --> 17:45.200
And Linode's done all of that.

17:45.200 --> 17:48.520
And I think it all starts in the DNA.

17:48.520 --> 17:51.520
Linode started because they were passionate about the technology.

17:51.520 --> 17:55.520
They saw where this virtualization tech, this user mode Linux stuff that was coming, they

17:55.520 --> 17:57.180
saw where that could go.

17:57.180 --> 18:00.960
And now, 19 years later, I think they have the best set of options in the business as

18:00.960 --> 18:02.880
they've whittled away and built something incredible.

18:02.880 --> 18:04.080
So go try it out.

18:04.080 --> 18:05.080
Support the show.

18:05.080 --> 18:06.080
Maybe learn something.

18:06.080 --> 18:13.520
And get $100 for 60 days on a new account, linode.com slash coder.

18:13.520 --> 18:17.800
So the show's been on the air for a really long time, really, really long time.

18:17.800 --> 18:21.680
We don't even have the entire back archive on the new website yet because we just launched

18:21.680 --> 18:24.800
the new website last week, but we are adding it.

18:24.800 --> 18:26.440
And it goes back basically 10 years.

18:26.440 --> 18:28.320
I don't even know how that's possible.

18:28.320 --> 18:32.500
We've exceeded the run of Linux Action Show by some bit.

18:32.500 --> 18:36.680
We are on a roundhouse kick to 500 episodes.

18:36.680 --> 18:41.720
And since we're sitting here on a Labor Day recording the pod, we thought, why don't we

18:41.720 --> 18:47.760
look back at this last decade on how tooling has changed, processes, workflow, remote work,

18:47.760 --> 18:48.760
platforms.

18:48.760 --> 18:53.160
Let's just look back in time.

18:53.160 --> 18:56.820
And I'm curious if you have any places you want to start on, you know, things that feel

18:56.820 --> 19:01.760
like major shifts for you, maybe specifically around tooling and things like that.

19:01.760 --> 19:02.760
Yeah.

19:02.760 --> 19:06.640
So I think a lot has changed since we started the show in terms of day-to-day work, right?

19:06.640 --> 19:10.880
I seem to remember talking a lot about, you know, manual testing and QA departments and

19:10.880 --> 19:18.120
yeah, let's pour one out for them while we're pouring one out for Sun.

19:18.120 --> 19:19.120
Yeah.

19:19.120 --> 19:20.120
There it is.

19:20.120 --> 19:21.120
There it is.

19:21.120 --> 19:22.120
There it is.

19:22.120 --> 19:23.120
Automated testing, right?

19:23.120 --> 19:27.400
What I guess you would call TDD was much more of a debate than it is now.

19:27.400 --> 19:28.960
If it is at all.

19:28.960 --> 19:34.480
In particular, the whole DevOps idea basically didn't exist 12 years ago.

19:34.480 --> 19:36.760
And I was a little hostile towards it too.

19:36.760 --> 19:38.240
You were hostile, you know.

19:38.240 --> 19:39.280
I'm a little hostile.

19:39.280 --> 19:40.520
I'm going to pat us on the back.

19:40.520 --> 19:45.560
We did call Docker before it was called Docker when they were.cloud, was that their name

19:45.560 --> 19:46.560
at the time?

19:46.560 --> 19:48.680
Yeah, we had the CTO on, yep.

19:48.680 --> 19:54.600
I remember very distinctly feeling like the blurring of developer and sysadmin was a very

19:54.600 --> 19:55.600
bad practice.

19:55.600 --> 19:57.560
Am I still going to feel that way?

19:57.560 --> 19:58.700
You had some fee-fees.

19:58.700 --> 20:00.440
You had some strong fee-fees, yes.

20:00.440 --> 20:01.440
I did.

20:01.440 --> 20:02.440
I did.

20:02.440 --> 20:06.160
Now, to be fair, the tooling has improved tremendously and things like Ansible have

20:06.160 --> 20:11.280
come along and Git and that stuff has really, really made quite a big improvement.

20:11.280 --> 20:16.760
And now, now I'm the guy that's like deploying changes by updating things on GitHub and then,

20:16.760 --> 20:21.120
you know, letting just things happen in the background and rebuild things for me.

20:21.120 --> 20:23.360
It's a very strange sensation.

20:23.360 --> 20:25.640
It's a strange energy, that's for sure.

20:25.640 --> 20:28.480
But it's the de facto standard now.

20:28.480 --> 20:34.400
In fact, you know, I talked about this, T&B, we moved back to GitHub for the most part

20:34.400 --> 20:38.320
because it's just got too hard to fight the tide with a small team.

20:38.320 --> 20:43.000
It's just easier to set up the either direct GitHub integration, you know, with something

20:43.000 --> 20:48.320
like a DO apps or Heroku, which Heroku is going through some changes.

20:48.320 --> 20:52.280
It's, we should talk about, we need to have a heart to heart with Heroku.

20:52.280 --> 20:55.120
There's some, some stuff's going on over there.

20:55.120 --> 20:58.980
I'm not quite sure I understand it other than that they killed their free tier and raised

20:58.980 --> 20:59.980
all their prices.

20:59.980 --> 21:00.980
Oh yeah.

21:00.980 --> 21:04.880
Which seems adorable, but yeah.

21:04.880 --> 21:06.960
Don't even get me started on GitHub actions, right?

21:06.960 --> 21:08.880
You got a problem, they've got an action.

21:08.880 --> 21:09.880
It's amazing.

21:09.880 --> 21:10.880
Yeah.

21:10.880 --> 21:13.680
I could see a lot of our publishing pipeline based around GitHub actions.

21:13.680 --> 21:14.680
Why not?

21:14.680 --> 21:16.320
It's, it's pretty powerful.

21:16.320 --> 21:21.120
The way we've been able to use actions, the way it just works with Hugo, it is, it is

21:21.120 --> 21:26.540
so, it is so smooth for the deployment of the new site and it makes it possible for

21:26.540 --> 21:29.400
way more people to participate in the process.

21:29.400 --> 21:33.560
And in the old sysadmin days, I would have had to have managed it all with user accounts

21:33.560 --> 21:38.720
and groups and SSH keys and FTP access.

21:38.720 --> 21:41.000
It truly was a worse way of doing things.

21:41.000 --> 21:46.440
And now people can publish things to the website based on like their GitHub level of permissions.

21:46.440 --> 21:51.840
And that makes participating in a community project way more doable.

21:51.840 --> 21:56.800
It also adds a layer of, this is kind of a double edged sword with standardization, right?

21:56.800 --> 21:57.880
And abstraction.

21:57.880 --> 22:01.160
Like you really, you know, you don't necessarily, not everyone in the, in the process even knows

22:01.160 --> 22:02.160
what's going on.

22:02.160 --> 22:03.920
They're not our hosting sponsor right now.

22:03.920 --> 22:10.480
But I just, can I just call out a DO's app platform, which is effectively those sons

22:10.480 --> 22:11.480
of bitches.

22:11.480 --> 22:13.120
It's effectively just Docker containers.

22:13.120 --> 22:14.120
Yeah.

22:14.120 --> 22:18.880
And all they've done is basically saved you the hassle of having to know how to like register

22:18.880 --> 22:24.120
on Docker hub and like, or even run your own little Docker hub and do all of this yourself,

22:24.120 --> 22:26.680
set up, you know, engine X or whatever you're using.

22:26.680 --> 22:31.320
You just point it to a GitHub repo, give it a little YAML file and bam, it pulls it out.

22:31.320 --> 22:33.360
Umbral is a project for self hosting.

22:33.360 --> 22:35.200
It's very much the same thing.

22:35.200 --> 22:36.200
Same idea.

22:36.200 --> 22:37.200
Yeah.

22:37.200 --> 22:38.200
You just get a dashboard.

22:38.200 --> 22:40.880
You click the thing like from an app store, which, you know, just an open source.

22:40.880 --> 22:44.240
And it just does all the Docker stuff, all of the routing stuff in the background for

22:44.240 --> 22:45.240
you.

22:45.240 --> 22:46.240
Oh, well they all have that.

22:46.240 --> 22:47.240
I don't know.

22:47.240 --> 22:48.240
It has like, they have a whole list.

22:48.240 --> 22:49.240
If you want to just like pull up.

22:49.240 --> 22:50.240
I want GitLab.

22:50.240 --> 22:51.240
I want Rails.

22:51.240 --> 22:52.240
I want chicken.

22:52.240 --> 22:53.240
Please.

22:53.240 --> 22:54.240
Mammix.

22:54.240 --> 22:55.240
Did I just go to Mammix?

22:55.240 --> 22:59.480
Mammix is a very compressed version of what's happened to the car industry.

22:59.480 --> 23:04.400
You and I came in just as they were starting to seal up the engines and we watched them

23:04.400 --> 23:09.460
go from like open engines that anybody could work on and build to fully sealed up engines,

23:09.460 --> 23:13.080
but now way more available to, and there's way more people that can like deploy this

23:13.080 --> 23:14.120
stuff now.

23:14.120 --> 23:19.040
And that's what we've witnessed in a really compressed timeline in the run of the show.

23:19.040 --> 23:23.080
To the point where orchestrating your containers has become a thing, right?

23:23.080 --> 23:25.440
There's like a million consultants you want to go around.

23:25.440 --> 23:27.240
They used to sell you agile training.

23:27.240 --> 23:29.120
Now they want to sell you Kubernetes training.

23:29.120 --> 23:30.120
Yes.

23:30.120 --> 23:31.120
Oh my gosh.

23:31.120 --> 23:36.680
And that's, you know, that's kind of, I don't have it on the list, but another big thing.

23:36.680 --> 23:40.480
What the hell happened to the middle managers?

23:40.480 --> 23:47.200
I haven't dealt with a PM who was a pure PM in probably like four years.

23:47.200 --> 23:48.200
Yeah.

23:48.200 --> 23:49.200
I think they're out there.

23:49.200 --> 23:53.920
There's probably a large organizations, but otherwise it's always double duty.

23:53.920 --> 23:56.040
Now it's always somebody else doing double duty.

23:56.040 --> 23:59.720
It seems like, yeah, there's definitely like a PM person, but they're always like also

23:59.720 --> 24:05.280
the DBA or they're like, you know, the guy who runs all the get stuff or he, the one

24:05.280 --> 24:09.360
wizard of Kubernetes who orchestrates all their containers, right?

24:09.360 --> 24:12.960
Or the, or your manager's also playing the role as PM, which is like kind of just doing

24:12.960 --> 24:13.960
double duty.

24:13.960 --> 24:18.160
But you know, I, I'm not necessarily against it because a lot of the PM hasn't been the

24:18.160 --> 24:22.720
best thing to come along and it's sometimes it's added a, you know, it's, it, it adds

24:22.720 --> 24:24.520
stakeholder creep having a PM.

24:24.520 --> 24:26.800
No, I think we should do a jaunty jig on their grave.

24:26.800 --> 24:27.800
I think it's good.

24:27.800 --> 24:28.800
I'm saying this is a feature.

24:28.800 --> 24:32.000
I thought we were going to, I thought we were going to disagree on this.

24:32.000 --> 24:33.000
Oh, no.

24:33.000 --> 24:38.360
I mean, I think if, you know, I like the lead, if you have a DBA, the DBA is a good PM.

24:38.360 --> 24:40.760
The lead developer is probably a great PM.

24:40.760 --> 24:41.760
Like what is a PM?

24:41.760 --> 24:44.840
He organizes your Kanban board and that's another one.

24:44.840 --> 24:47.600
Just the agile has eaten the damn world.

24:47.600 --> 24:48.920
There's no argument anymore.

24:48.920 --> 24:50.760
You're doing agile.

24:50.760 --> 24:54.600
And I know our friend Adam's going to get mad at me, but even like a vet modeling, very

24:54.600 --> 24:57.580
agile ask, very influenced by agile, right?

24:57.580 --> 24:59.800
It's all agile.

24:59.800 --> 25:05.340
There's no one outside of maybe the DOD, even then doing waterfall it's over.

25:05.340 --> 25:07.000
And that's a big change.

25:07.000 --> 25:10.480
If you go back, that was a huge, that was a huge discussion for years.

25:10.480 --> 25:16.000
This huge, huge discussion for years, you know, I didn't even realize it would happen,

25:16.000 --> 25:20.440
but looking back, there's a, there's like the master switch and, and into the plex.

25:20.440 --> 25:26.560
There's a couple of books that are really good at showing how tech is kind of following

25:26.560 --> 25:31.280
the trends of the radio industry and the car industry and all these previous industries

25:31.280 --> 25:33.760
that have come along, even cable television.

25:33.760 --> 25:38.360
And one trend that happens in there is these kinds of philosophies, economics even, right?

25:38.360 --> 25:41.160
You've had Austrian economics and Kenzie and economics, right?

25:41.160 --> 25:49.880
And over time, it just seems that a predominant philosophy does take over.

25:49.880 --> 25:55.000
And you just don't even, when, when it reaches that kind of mass threshold, you don't even

25:55.000 --> 25:57.400
realize it's happening because it's just normal now.

25:57.400 --> 26:00.320
It's just the way everybody, and maybe we don't even call it that anymore, right?

26:00.320 --> 26:02.080
It's just the way things are.

26:02.080 --> 26:03.760
It's just the way you do things now.

26:03.760 --> 26:08.600
You know, I didn't even realize I was doing agile until I had to do the notes for the

26:08.600 --> 26:14.240
show today and I was like, well, let's see, I have a combine born of weekly deliveries.

26:14.240 --> 26:19.840
I deploy to production at least twice a month.

26:19.840 --> 26:25.560
The only thing I don't do is standups because I mean, although we kind of do, we have a

26:25.560 --> 26:30.640
daily check-in, but we don't do like, like there was some stupid ceremony in agile, right?

26:30.640 --> 26:34.680
Like the, you know, the agile consultants were basically, I think flimflam men, right?

26:34.680 --> 26:36.740
Well, that's always the stuff that turned me off.

26:36.740 --> 26:39.600
As soon as you get to the ceremony stuff, I started getting turned off.

26:39.600 --> 26:43.760
I remember one, one place I was a contractor at, they had like this little ball.

26:43.760 --> 26:47.120
It was like one of the, one of those Apple promo balls.

26:47.120 --> 26:48.120
It was like kindergarten.

26:48.120 --> 26:53.140
You couldn't talk unless you had the ball and you had to toss the ball, like playing

26:53.140 --> 26:55.920
catch for, you know, 30 year olds.

26:55.920 --> 27:01.480
I hate that stuff so much and I, I know it's about team building and it even sometimes

27:01.480 --> 27:05.640
works on me when I'm forced to participate, which I hate even more, but I still hate it.

27:05.640 --> 27:06.640
I never want to do it.

27:06.640 --> 27:07.800
It feels like a huge waste of my time.

27:07.800 --> 27:09.240
I'm a professional.

27:09.240 --> 27:12.120
I'm always going to be as professional and polite as I can.

27:12.120 --> 27:16.120
And we'll build a team bond based on the good work and the wins.

27:16.120 --> 27:17.480
That's how you build a team bond is wins.

27:17.480 --> 27:20.600
Well, and there's always the one dude who just can't catch and somebody's coffee lands

27:20.600 --> 27:21.640
in a Mac book.

27:21.640 --> 27:23.160
We're going to say that's what happened.

27:23.160 --> 27:25.640
We're going to say that we're going to use that excuse.

27:25.640 --> 27:26.640
Yeah.

27:26.640 --> 27:27.640
Right.

27:27.640 --> 27:28.640
Okay.

27:28.640 --> 27:29.640
Very good.

27:29.640 --> 27:30.640
Yeah.

27:30.640 --> 27:32.200
You know, one of the things, uh, just kind of while we're touching on all of this is

27:32.200 --> 27:33.400
what we have landed on.

27:33.400 --> 27:37.680
And I think it's for the better is a lot of my processes now are just self-documenting

27:37.680 --> 27:40.880
where in the past all the documentation required me to generate it.

27:40.880 --> 27:45.160
Like when I pushed a production, there's a commit log there where I leave a note, right?

27:45.160 --> 27:49.700
When I configure something in like Nix, there's a configuration comment that I leave behind

27:49.700 --> 27:53.580
or like when we deploy something for the web server and ansible that's self-documenting

27:53.580 --> 27:55.640
ansible is self-documenting now.

27:55.640 --> 28:01.040
And that is a game changer for me because I sometimes do documentation and I do it really

28:01.040 --> 28:04.560
good and then I, and then I like burn out for a year and then I don't do it for like

28:04.560 --> 28:05.560
a year.

28:05.560 --> 28:08.480
So it's a lot of this stuff, a lot of these processes, not all of them, but a lot of these

28:08.480 --> 28:14.040
processes now, you know, the kids these days, uh, they're self-documenting and I think that's

28:14.040 --> 28:15.040
a net positive.

28:15.040 --> 28:16.040
Yeah.

28:16.040 --> 28:17.040
I would just like to add to that list.

28:17.040 --> 28:22.280
The, uh, fast API, the thing Alice has written on, it's, uh, got beautiful self-documentation

28:22.280 --> 28:25.040
and I know the.net folks have something similar.

28:25.040 --> 28:29.040
Uh, shout out to Wes again for turning me on to fast API a couple of years ago.

28:29.040 --> 28:30.040
Super helpful.

28:30.040 --> 28:31.040
You want to talk a little remote?

28:31.040 --> 28:32.700
I mean, that's the elephant in here.

28:32.700 --> 28:33.700
I feel like.

28:33.700 --> 28:34.700
Yeah.

28:34.700 --> 28:37.720
I mean, so, you know, we talk about remote all the time.

28:37.720 --> 28:42.720
I would actually like to twist this into an actual doing development remotely.

28:42.720 --> 28:44.440
Not like, is it good for management?

28:44.440 --> 28:45.440
Are people lonely?

28:45.440 --> 28:46.440
You know, whatever.

28:46.440 --> 28:48.120
Are they wearing pants?

28:48.120 --> 28:53.780
I kind of, so, you know, I've been doing the code pilot experiment and it is comically

28:53.780 --> 28:56.520
bad when it's bad.

28:56.520 --> 29:01.600
But I realized, and again, this kind of came to me last night when I, when I first pitched

29:01.600 --> 29:04.360
you on this idea for the show.

29:04.360 --> 29:06.880
The problem is it's too ambitious.

29:06.880 --> 29:09.680
It shouldn't be trying to write your application good for you.

29:09.680 --> 29:12.400
It should just be a linter on steroids.

29:12.400 --> 29:13.800
Sure.

29:13.800 --> 29:17.200
So let's take the Python case or let's, you know, I think a more common case, let's take

29:17.200 --> 29:19.240
the TypeScript case.

29:19.240 --> 29:25.520
You have TS lint, which is a very good TypeScript linter code pilot should augment that and

29:25.520 --> 29:28.280
say TS lint says you violated this rule.

29:28.280 --> 29:30.620
I looked on the public GitHub repos.

29:30.620 --> 29:34.120
This is how people doing something that looks similar, because I can already do that, right?

29:34.120 --> 29:37.760
Tell you code that looks similar to yours have gotten around this.

29:37.760 --> 29:42.360
Would you like to accept my solution to satisfying the linter rules?

29:42.360 --> 29:44.420
Oh, that's so actually helpful.

29:44.420 --> 29:45.680
That would actually be helpful.

29:45.680 --> 29:51.100
And I could see a world where you, GitHub, they do all kinds of crap.

29:51.100 --> 29:52.400
Why not do this?

29:52.400 --> 29:58.120
Have different accepted linter style guides and say, you know, all right, the mad botter

29:58.120 --> 30:03.840
is adopting, you know, for Ruby, which is a little looser than Python, right?

30:03.840 --> 30:08.440
All these things with the exception of all methods must have parenthesis, right?

30:08.440 --> 30:15.320
None of this, you know, my method space parameter stuff, which is true, which is our style guide.

30:15.320 --> 30:18.660
And GitHub copilot, you just need to know that.

30:18.660 --> 30:25.040
And anybody who's logged into our GitHub on VS code or whatever, you flag that as an error.

30:25.040 --> 30:26.040
Oh, man.

30:26.040 --> 30:29.880
See, and that's when you have to work with other vendors or the customer looks at your

30:29.880 --> 30:30.880
code.

30:30.880 --> 30:33.480
You just look so much more professional when you have one style.

30:33.480 --> 30:37.560
Additionally, we're kind of just accepting linters as a fait accompli here.

30:37.560 --> 30:42.640
Linters were kind of a new, like not new, new, but they have come a huge way in terms

30:42.640 --> 30:44.520
of what they can check for.

30:44.520 --> 30:45.520
And way more common.

30:45.520 --> 30:46.520
Way more common.

30:46.520 --> 30:50.960
If you if you use JetBrains at all, they're built in VS code is always trying to tell

30:50.960 --> 30:51.960
you that you suck.

30:51.960 --> 30:57.040
So you know what I really like about your idea, your tweak to copilot here is it's also

30:57.040 --> 31:01.560
verifiable if it's doing a good job or not, because you're saying, OK, here's my here's

31:01.560 --> 31:02.560
my standard.

31:02.560 --> 31:05.120
I want to be you know, I want you to compare me to.

31:05.120 --> 31:07.720
And that is, did it meet the standard or not?

31:07.720 --> 31:11.080
And is copilot recommending based on the standard?

31:11.080 --> 31:15.280
That's really easy to determine success where right now it's so ambiguous.

31:15.280 --> 31:16.280
So nebulous.

31:16.280 --> 31:18.880
And of course, you could do that with most of these linters anyway, right?

31:18.880 --> 31:23.520
They all have configs and, you know, things like Rubocop is the one I use for Ruby.

31:23.520 --> 31:24.520
And yeah, I can tell it.

31:24.520 --> 31:27.720
Listen, I I hate I forgot the thing I hate.

31:27.720 --> 31:32.480
There's a oh, I think it's too strict on the line length thing because I like to write

31:32.480 --> 31:37.720
objective C style method names that are like Chris gets up, puts on his robe and ties the

31:37.720 --> 31:40.640
sash and make a cup of coffee.

31:40.640 --> 31:41.920
That should actually be two methods.

31:41.920 --> 31:45.440
Oh, this this must be a good day if I'm tying the sash.

31:45.440 --> 31:48.600
Or a really bad day, depending on how you look at it.

31:48.600 --> 31:50.280
Why can't GitHub copilot?

31:50.280 --> 31:51.280
And I think it can.

31:51.280 --> 31:52.280
Right.

31:52.280 --> 31:53.280
I think this is a choice to have to make.

31:53.280 --> 31:54.280
Be like, all right.

31:54.280 --> 31:56.720
I'm the copilot for your organization.

31:56.720 --> 31:59.720
Don't worry about any config files in your individual repos.

31:59.720 --> 32:02.320
I'm just enforcing this globally.

32:02.320 --> 32:03.940
It knows what language you're writing.

32:03.940 --> 32:05.740
It knows what framework you're using.

32:05.740 --> 32:06.740
It knows if you're sleeping.

32:06.740 --> 32:08.000
It knows if you're awake.

32:08.000 --> 32:12.920
Yeah, I'd like that in our show docs just for markdown, you know, be be be be tidy that

32:12.920 --> 32:14.400
up for us.

32:14.400 --> 32:16.920
Huh, clippy at the next level.

32:16.920 --> 32:18.560
That would be really great.

32:18.560 --> 32:19.560
How did we get to there?

32:19.560 --> 32:20.560
I love that.

32:20.560 --> 32:23.520
But I think that's oh, because you're talking about remote tooling, remote tooling.

32:23.520 --> 32:26.800
That's a great example of tooling that could actually help people that are developing remotely

32:26.800 --> 32:29.940
on their own that don't have somebody they can tap the shoulder on.

32:29.940 --> 32:31.840
That's a great that's a great example.

32:31.840 --> 32:32.840
I could see it getting there.

32:32.840 --> 32:33.840
That doesn't seem impossible.

32:33.840 --> 32:38.520
And it actually seems easier than what they're what they seem to be trying to do.

32:38.520 --> 32:39.520
Right.

32:39.520 --> 32:40.520
Right.

32:40.520 --> 32:42.200
I mean, the linters already exist.

32:42.200 --> 32:43.260
They're all open source.

32:43.260 --> 32:48.080
You could just and they they usually output to like standard out because you can run them

32:48.080 --> 32:49.360
on the command line.

32:49.360 --> 32:54.180
So I'm pretty sure you could just intercept those messages like ah, the TSLint actually

32:54.180 --> 32:56.600
has like really good documentation on the error code.

32:56.600 --> 33:00.760
So they could have a simple dictionary of the error codes, look it up and look for code

33:00.760 --> 33:01.760
that looks similar.

33:01.760 --> 33:05.820
It's all stuff they already do, except for the tying into the linter part.

33:05.820 --> 33:12.360
My benchmark for remote tooling, and if the tooling is comprehensive and complete, is

33:12.360 --> 33:19.000
it exactly the same tooling commands and infrastructure when I'm like in Juneau, Alaska?

33:19.000 --> 33:22.360
And if I'm in the office at a desk, are we using the same tools?

33:22.360 --> 33:24.800
Are we, you know, exact same processes?

33:24.800 --> 33:28.840
Then I think, yeah, at a tooling standpoint, everything's even and it's pretty easy to

33:28.840 --> 33:29.840
get there today.

33:29.840 --> 33:30.840
You just have to pick the right stuff.

33:30.840 --> 33:34.840
So, yeah, getting and, you know, in a lot of ways when you're talking about it from

33:34.840 --> 33:40.780
the developers perspective, remote work might be the best thing to have happened to them

33:40.780 --> 33:43.160
in the last decade, right?

33:43.160 --> 33:45.480
It's so great from a focus standpoint.

33:45.480 --> 33:52.060
My home setup is almost, maybe with the exception of once, has always been so much superior

33:52.060 --> 33:53.060
to my work setup.

33:53.060 --> 33:56.920
Because I always, you know, I'm tinkering, I got my chair, I got my desk, I got my screens

33:56.920 --> 33:57.920
the way I like them.

33:57.920 --> 34:03.600
I got the machine that's a ridiculous overbuilt performance hound, at least I used to back

34:03.600 --> 34:04.600
in my day.

34:04.600 --> 34:06.800
But you know what I mean, like you can really build it your way.

34:06.800 --> 34:10.520
You can play your music, you can have your environment, your food, you know.

34:10.520 --> 34:14.520
You don't have to worry about interruptions, you know, that's why some people like combine

34:14.520 --> 34:18.000
working from home with working late too, because then no one's awake, no one's messaging you

34:18.000 --> 34:21.200
and the two together really let you get in flow.

34:21.200 --> 34:22.200
And that's what it's all about.

34:22.200 --> 34:27.400
You all have seen my three 4am Twitter postings when I start my day to do coding before my

34:27.400 --> 34:30.200
wonderful Pokemon obsessed son wakes up.

34:30.200 --> 34:34.440
Oh, Wes has a good add on for the linters.

34:34.440 --> 34:37.180
I can't believe I forgot that language servers.

34:37.180 --> 34:44.320
You can have hardcore IDE level debugging in the command line independently running.

34:44.320 --> 34:46.240
Hello, Wes.

34:46.240 --> 34:48.560
Welcome to the Coder Radio matrix chat room.

34:48.560 --> 34:49.560
Welcome to the matrix.

34:49.560 --> 34:51.760
The show has a dedicated chat room on matrix.

34:51.760 --> 34:55.720
We'll have well, you can just go to Coder dot show slash matrix and you can join it

34:55.720 --> 35:00.000
while we're live or when we're not either way with the chat is always going for the

35:00.000 --> 35:01.000
show.

35:01.000 --> 35:02.000
We got a dedicated spot.

35:02.000 --> 35:05.320
I see somebody added an item to our little bullet point list here.

35:05.320 --> 35:08.040
Well, two items, really.

35:08.040 --> 35:12.160
I think it's I could have added a third now that I think about it, too.

35:12.160 --> 35:17.960
Don't you find it fascinating that over the last decade, unquestionably, Linux and Apple,

35:17.960 --> 35:23.760
both in their own ways, have just exponentially grown, but not at the cost of Microsoft?

35:23.760 --> 35:24.760
Right.

35:24.760 --> 35:28.520
Didn't we early on when this show started, I think we looked at the market as a zero

35:28.520 --> 35:31.040
sum game mostly.

35:31.040 --> 35:35.480
In reality, there was just plenty of money for all of them to soak up, apparently.

35:35.480 --> 35:38.800
And so Apple has become an absolute behemoth.

35:38.800 --> 35:41.900
They were barely in the enterprise when we started the show, barely in the enterprise

35:41.900 --> 35:43.680
when we started the show.

35:43.680 --> 35:47.600
And now they're a massive player, tons of MacBooks in the workplace.

35:47.600 --> 35:50.120
It's very common for developers to have MacBooks now.

35:50.120 --> 35:51.120
Super common.

35:51.120 --> 35:56.280
Linux, there's Linux in the workplace, Linux on the server, Linux vendors, more developers

35:56.280 --> 35:57.460
choosing Linux.

35:57.460 --> 35:58.960
That's been an exponential growth.

35:58.960 --> 36:01.560
Linux and half the **** in your house, right?

36:01.560 --> 36:03.640
And Microsoft didn't have to go broke for any of it to happen.

36:03.640 --> 36:09.640
In fact, Microsoft is more integral to developers outside the Microsoft ecosystem than they

36:09.640 --> 36:10.640
ever have been.

36:10.640 --> 36:12.960
I was like, Microsoft is weirdly on that Linux badwagon, right?

36:12.960 --> 36:17.280
You know, when you talk about Azure, they have the whole Linux IoT platform, too.

36:17.280 --> 36:18.280
Yeah, yeah.

36:18.280 --> 36:19.760
And they're continuing to update it.

36:19.760 --> 36:22.520
Yeah, they sell lots of Linux over there.

36:22.520 --> 36:25.480
Yeah, they've got two distros they're making now.

36:25.480 --> 36:26.560
They're CBL Mariner Distro.

36:26.560 --> 36:31.740
They just recently updated it to make it possible to run on a wider range of hardware.

36:31.740 --> 36:36.080
They're kind of like beginning to build it to run on stuff that's not just Microsoft

36:36.080 --> 36:39.720
purpose hardware or virtual machines, which maybe I don't know how far they go with that,

36:39.720 --> 36:42.080
but I find that to be fascinating.

36:42.080 --> 36:47.440
There's so much going on and that is it's so rich now and you've really had to find

36:47.440 --> 36:51.540
your niche, I think, for most people that are at least trying to ride these trends.

36:51.540 --> 36:54.080
People that have just kind of picked their thing and they've been doing it for a decade

36:54.080 --> 36:55.080
and still working for them.

36:55.080 --> 36:56.080
God bless.

36:56.080 --> 36:58.440
But for most people that are trying to ride these trends, like you've really had to kind

36:58.440 --> 37:00.480
of niche down and you've had to go through that.

37:00.480 --> 37:04.200
You know, you've kind of had to niche down and you had to find a niche that was complementary

37:04.200 --> 37:06.800
to your skill sets and the team you could build.

37:06.800 --> 37:10.280
And you know, when we started, you weren't talking about the snake a lot or hosting on

37:10.280 --> 37:11.280
Linux.

37:11.280 --> 37:14.980
You know, you were really focused more on the consumer side and maybe general and building

37:14.980 --> 37:18.320
tools for developers, perhaps individual developers.

37:18.320 --> 37:23.840
Yeah, no, I definitely gone through a religious conversion of I'm a little more extreme than

37:23.840 --> 37:24.840
you.

37:24.840 --> 37:30.600
I think these front end services are going to not services front end, like maybe a phrase

37:30.600 --> 37:33.480
that it's all going to be the web in some form or another.

37:33.480 --> 37:34.480
Really?

37:34.480 --> 37:35.480
Yeah.

37:35.480 --> 37:36.480
Oh my God.

37:36.480 --> 37:38.760
This might be, I've been corrupted by just writing lots and lots of business software

37:38.760 --> 37:43.480
for the last couple of years, but no one wants to pay for, you know, what I used to call

37:43.480 --> 37:48.880
double native and it's probably not worth it for most business cases.

37:48.880 --> 37:53.920
Honestly, the thing holding the web back is, is Apple.

37:53.920 --> 37:58.200
Apple's just outright refusal to make mobile Safari good.

37:58.200 --> 38:05.480
I mean, yep, but ironically, some of the most complicated web apps in existence are shipping

38:05.480 --> 38:07.640
as iOS apps in the app store.

38:07.640 --> 38:09.800
I just shipped one for somebody.

38:09.800 --> 38:10.800
Yeah.

38:10.800 --> 38:11.800
Yeah.

38:11.800 --> 38:13.980
So there's, it is happening.

38:13.980 --> 38:18.320
So like because of that, those pieces are that groundwork, that skill set, all of that

38:18.320 --> 38:23.480
is getting laid, even though it might be shipping as an iOS quote unquote native app, the tooling,

38:23.480 --> 38:24.880
all of that.

38:24.880 --> 38:25.880
I think you're right.

38:25.880 --> 38:27.680
And here's what I think too.

38:27.680 --> 38:32.480
I think historically things revert to the mean, you know, like the web is the mean,

38:32.480 --> 38:35.840
the web is the standard general platform.

38:35.840 --> 38:39.860
That's why the web's running on Linux servers because that's another general standard tech

38:39.860 --> 38:41.140
platform.

38:41.140 --> 38:47.540
And inevitably, inevitably you just, you just give up, you concede and you just use the

38:47.540 --> 38:48.880
general tech platform.

38:48.880 --> 38:50.800
It's just the way it goes.

38:50.800 --> 38:54.320
Even if you package that up as an app, it's still going to be using web technologies on

38:54.320 --> 38:55.320
the backend.

38:55.320 --> 38:59.640
And you, and you look at some of the biggest fricking iOS apps out there, some of the top

38:59.640 --> 39:06.160
apps on the iOS app store, they can reconfigure parts of that UI on the backend like nobody's

39:06.160 --> 39:08.120
business because it's all web rendering.

39:08.120 --> 39:13.440
We talked about a Ionix new offering for that last week, the same exact idea.

39:13.440 --> 39:17.520
You can reconfigure and even call capacitor plugins as long as the plugins already in

39:17.520 --> 39:21.480
your bundle, right, without updating the actual app.

39:21.480 --> 39:25.480
You know, there is a, there is kind of a little bit of disappointment here though.

39:25.480 --> 39:28.840
I would have bet a few years ago that web assembly would be a much bigger part of our

39:28.840 --> 39:29.840
day-to-day lives.

39:29.840 --> 39:30.840
Yeah.

39:30.840 --> 39:31.840
Yeah.

39:31.840 --> 39:33.080
And that just didn't happen again.

39:33.080 --> 39:40.200
And I think because of Apple, maybe because if it doesn't work on iOS, well, damn.

39:40.200 --> 39:41.720
It's kind of why start the project.

39:41.720 --> 39:43.640
It's kind of a non-start, especially in the States.

39:43.640 --> 39:50.640
I know some of our European audience who we tenderly love is another way to put that.

39:50.640 --> 39:54.520
I believe yesterday or it must have been Friday, I saw a headline that iOS user market share

39:54.520 --> 39:56.000
has actually just surpassed Android.

39:56.000 --> 39:57.000
Did you see that?

39:57.000 --> 39:58.000
Is that possible?

39:58.000 --> 39:59.000
I just believe I saw that.

39:59.000 --> 40:00.000
I find that incredibly hard to believe.

40:00.000 --> 40:01.000
In the US maybe.

40:01.000 --> 40:02.000
Maybe.

40:02.000 --> 40:03.000
Yeah.

40:03.000 --> 40:04.000
I'll double check it.

40:04.000 --> 40:08.360
But my point is, if you had an existing platform, an existing application and iOS came along

40:08.360 --> 40:11.640
and it didn't support iOS, that didn't wreck your world.

40:11.640 --> 40:17.120
But today in 2022, a project is a non-starter if it's not going to support iOS.

40:17.120 --> 40:18.120
Yeah.

40:18.120 --> 40:19.120
Android.

40:19.120 --> 40:24.000
Let's just say a lot of devs don't do a whole lot of testing on Android Chrome because it's

40:24.000 --> 40:27.540
basically Chrome, right?

40:27.540 --> 40:28.880
Just we're on iOS.

40:28.880 --> 40:31.720
Have you seen the leaks that came out this morning?

40:31.720 --> 40:35.760
Definitely definitely definitely not from Apple PR shutting down expectations for the

40:35.760 --> 40:37.880
iPhone announcement tomorrow.

40:37.880 --> 40:38.880
You called this.

40:38.880 --> 40:39.880
I think you might be right.

40:39.880 --> 40:42.360
Ironically, elephant in the room again.

40:42.360 --> 40:43.360
Several of them.

40:43.360 --> 40:44.520
Get them out of here.

40:44.520 --> 40:45.580
Several elephants.

40:45.580 --> 40:47.520
This is coming out on the day of the Apple event.

40:47.520 --> 40:48.520
Yeah.

40:48.520 --> 40:50.160
So tomorrow it's Monday now for us.

40:50.160 --> 40:52.440
So today for you, I guess.

40:52.440 --> 40:53.440
Yeah.

40:53.440 --> 40:54.560
And so maybe we'll be wrong, but you're right.

40:54.560 --> 40:58.840
The leaks seem to suggest smaller notch is the big new feature.

40:58.840 --> 40:59.840
Smaller notch.

40:59.840 --> 41:00.840
Maybe a slightly better camera.

41:00.840 --> 41:01.840
Yeah, of course.

41:01.840 --> 41:02.840
Yeah.

41:02.840 --> 41:05.520
And if you're like me and dropped your iPhone and you don't want to pay the repair, you

41:05.520 --> 41:06.520
might get one anyway.

41:06.520 --> 41:07.700
Although I'm running at 12.

41:07.700 --> 41:12.920
So for me, there probably is more change right in terms of processor and all that.

41:12.920 --> 41:13.920
Yeah.

41:13.920 --> 41:15.760
Oh, actually, it might be worth an upgrade for you.

41:15.760 --> 41:16.760
Yeah.

41:16.760 --> 41:20.760
So it's who who could have leaked something like that?

41:20.760 --> 41:24.240
Who could the source who could have known be?

41:24.240 --> 41:27.320
That Mark Gurman sure seems to have the right phone number.

41:27.320 --> 41:28.320
Sure does.

41:28.320 --> 41:29.320
That source is.

41:29.320 --> 41:32.120
And it sure seems to never get caught by Apple somehow.

41:32.120 --> 41:33.120
Sure is strange.

41:33.120 --> 41:34.120
It's weird.

41:34.120 --> 41:35.120
It's weird.

41:35.120 --> 41:40.760
But Apple's iPhone overtakes Android with more than half of the U.S. market share.

41:40.760 --> 41:43.200
I believe that there are no more iPhones in the U.S.

41:43.200 --> 41:47.960
Well, and if you've ever like sat in a pub, you'll know that Samsung is betting all in

41:47.960 --> 41:53.480
on folding phones, which oh, my God, they're like fourteen hundred dollars to they're really

41:53.480 --> 41:54.480
expensive.

41:54.480 --> 41:55.480
It seems ridiculous.

41:55.480 --> 41:56.480
I don't.

41:56.480 --> 41:57.480
Yeah.

41:57.480 --> 42:02.040
And the thing is, the headline isn't Apple's iPhone 13 overtakes Android.

42:02.040 --> 42:03.500
It's all iPhones.

42:03.500 --> 42:06.400
And Apple loves selling old iPhones.

42:06.400 --> 42:07.400
And what is that?

42:07.400 --> 42:08.720
The iPhone or whatever, the real cheap one.

42:08.720 --> 42:11.000
I got one for for my grandma.

42:11.000 --> 42:12.720
Still a solid phone.

42:12.720 --> 42:13.720
She loves it.

42:13.720 --> 42:14.720
It comes in cute colors.

42:14.720 --> 42:15.720
I mean, why not?

42:15.720 --> 42:16.720
Yeah, it's a good size.

42:16.720 --> 42:17.720
It's got decent battery life.

42:17.720 --> 42:19.840
You know, it's a decent it's a decent deal.

42:19.840 --> 42:20.840
She's happy.

42:20.840 --> 42:24.680
Got her that in a in a past gen iPad, Benny.

42:24.680 --> 42:27.800
She loves it.

42:27.800 --> 42:30.260
Tailscale dot com slash coder.

42:30.260 --> 42:32.760
Go there to get a free personal account for up to 20 devices.

42:32.760 --> 42:35.880
And of course, you support the show if here's what's up.

42:35.880 --> 42:39.040
This is just a little bit of talk between you and me.

42:39.040 --> 42:41.600
I don't want don't share this to anybody else, but I just want to have a private moment

42:41.600 --> 42:42.840
with you.

42:42.840 --> 42:49.000
If you do nothing else today but install tailscale, you can call today because that that's going

42:49.000 --> 42:51.120
to set you up forever.

42:51.120 --> 42:54.000
Like tomorrow's work is a little bit easier.

42:54.000 --> 42:56.000
I love tailscale.

42:56.000 --> 42:58.700
It's so quick to get going to select after like two minutes.

42:58.700 --> 43:02.000
You're done for the day, you know, because I'm giving you permission to take the rest

43:02.000 --> 43:05.340
of the day off when you go to tailscale dot com slash coder.

43:05.340 --> 43:11.920
You're going to set up a zero config mesh VPN in just a couple of minutes that manages

43:11.920 --> 43:16.680
firewall rules, takes care of that dreaded carrier double net situation some of us find

43:16.680 --> 43:23.000
ourselves in, and it connects all your devices directly to each other using WireGuard's noise

43:23.000 --> 43:24.000
protocol.

43:24.000 --> 43:25.340
The good stuff.

43:25.340 --> 43:29.320
This is the stuff that we hoped we'd see hit the market once WireGuard became a thing.

43:29.320 --> 43:34.000
When it was a twinkle in our eyes, you can quickly and easily create a secure network

43:34.000 --> 43:38.360
between your servers, your computers, your virtual machines, your cloud instances.

43:38.360 --> 43:40.920
I even have it as an add on to home assistant.

43:40.920 --> 43:43.640
It's just so wonderful.

43:43.640 --> 43:45.300
And then additionally, you can share with people.

43:45.300 --> 43:49.340
You can set up ACLs that supports DNS if you want to put a DNS server in there.

43:49.340 --> 43:55.580
For me, the real fundamental shift in my game was when I realized all these various devices

43:55.580 --> 44:01.480
like at the studio, at home, my kids' computers, my VM machines I'm working on for projects,

44:01.480 --> 44:07.940
my VPSs, they all now have a static IP on this mesh network.

44:07.940 --> 44:12.520
So then I started realizing, well, I'll just connect to that IP all the time.

44:12.520 --> 44:14.640
And it has changed the way I do networking.

44:14.640 --> 44:17.120
No more inbound firewall rules, gone.

44:17.120 --> 44:20.520
I don't have to worry about any of that stuff anymore.

44:20.520 --> 44:23.860
Now my bookmarks for like the web apps and services that I use that I run on different

44:23.860 --> 44:26.940
servers and stuff, they're all using the tail scale IP.

44:26.940 --> 44:28.160
So it's the same bookmark.

44:28.160 --> 44:32.920
It's the same IP when I'm at home, when I'm at the studio, when I'm over at the kid's

44:32.920 --> 44:36.280
house, it is the same everywhere.

44:36.280 --> 44:40.260
You guys, when we got to that point and then I started doing sharing with different members

44:40.260 --> 44:45.880
of the JB team and we really just, we have built our own little private internet and

44:45.880 --> 44:47.860
it's been so easy with tail scale.

44:47.860 --> 44:52.520
And now tail scale has tail scale SSH, which just makes managing your SSH connections even

44:52.520 --> 44:54.080
easier.

44:54.080 --> 44:55.680
Keep connected with tail scale.

44:55.680 --> 44:56.680
It'll change your game.

44:56.680 --> 45:02.720
It's on the level of like file sync and the types of technologies, you know, collaborative

45:02.720 --> 45:05.280
editing chat.

45:05.280 --> 45:09.960
Like it's just a fundamental tool now, a fundamental tool and it couldn't be built better.

45:09.960 --> 45:15.580
It's a great app, a great team, and you can try it for free for up to 20 devices and support

45:15.580 --> 45:19.240
the show when you go to tailscale.com slash coder.

45:19.240 --> 45:21.600
It just doesn't get any better than that.

45:21.600 --> 45:23.280
I'm thrilled to tell you about tail scale.

45:23.280 --> 45:29.960
Go try it out, tailscale.com slash coder.

45:29.960 --> 45:33.720
Well speaking of Apple, you ready to get yourself an Xcode cloud subscription.

45:33.720 --> 45:37.840
They're now generally available for developers after launching in beta in June.

45:37.840 --> 45:38.840
I am not.

45:38.840 --> 45:39.840
No.

45:39.840 --> 45:44.480
But Mike, this is a whole category of people that have to have access to Apple's platform

45:44.480 --> 45:46.040
that they could monetize.

45:46.040 --> 45:47.040
No.

45:47.040 --> 45:52.160
Here's a little bit of the details.

45:52.160 --> 45:56.440
It's like 15 bucks a month for the base plan.

45:56.440 --> 46:00.920
Subscriptions can be like more expensive if you want to add more compute hours.

46:00.920 --> 46:06.640
So 15 bucks a month gets you 25 compute hours, which is, you know, you know what that means.

46:06.640 --> 46:11.360
However long you use some of the back end, you can get 100 compute hours for 50 bucks,

46:11.360 --> 46:18.360
150 compute hours for 100 bucks a month and a thousand compute hours for 400 a month.

46:18.360 --> 46:23.680
You can configure Xflow to upload and build in the cloud and Apple is going to offer 25

46:23.680 --> 46:28.360
compute hours per month at no cost until the end of 2023 so you can try it out and get

46:28.360 --> 46:29.360
real hooked.

46:29.360 --> 46:33.200
You know, so you can now you can build on your MacBook Air and upload it to Apple.

46:33.200 --> 46:36.240
This has really got to be about getting things ready for Xcode on iOS.

46:36.240 --> 46:38.160
Nah, I don't think so.

46:38.160 --> 46:39.160
No?

46:39.160 --> 46:42.560
Wouldn't you think in order to have a really complete iPad development experience where

46:42.560 --> 46:45.960
you can build applications for Apple's various platforms, you're not going to want to build

46:45.960 --> 46:46.960
all that on an iPad?

46:46.960 --> 46:47.960
I mean, you could.

46:47.960 --> 46:52.640
But wouldn't you just, you know, you do everything on the iPad and you upload it to Xcode cloud

46:52.640 --> 46:55.160
and let it build and deploy to the App Store?

46:55.160 --> 46:59.800
I think to make the development experience on iPad good, this is not like the most pressing

46:59.800 --> 47:01.320
issue.

47:01.320 --> 47:06.920
For instance, you'd have to fix multitasking on iPad, which I don't know how they would

47:06.920 --> 47:07.920
do.

47:07.920 --> 47:08.920
Yeah.

47:08.920 --> 47:09.920
Yeah.

47:09.920 --> 47:13.760
So, you know, I actually think this is for the enterprise because, you know, code signing

47:13.760 --> 47:14.760
is a pain in the butt.

47:14.760 --> 47:18.880
And I can imagine lots of organizations that like hire a contractor, the contractor gets

47:18.880 --> 47:21.240
in a dispute, quits, gets fired, whatever.

47:21.240 --> 47:25.620
And oh, he had all the private keys for all of our iOS stuff and our push notifications

47:25.620 --> 47:26.880
and whatever.

47:26.880 --> 47:29.320
We need to now regenerate everything and revoke all the keys.

47:29.320 --> 47:32.360
It's a huge hassle, huge pain in the butt.

47:32.360 --> 47:36.560
I've had people ask me to do it for them many times when they've either had a nasty breakup

47:36.560 --> 47:38.760
with a vendor or whatever.

47:38.760 --> 47:42.320
In a lot of ways, this is almost like a Jenkins for our Xcode.

47:42.320 --> 47:47.280
Wouldn't it in theory allow an enterprise to deploy cheaper Macs as well with lower

47:47.280 --> 47:48.280
end hardware?

47:48.280 --> 47:50.360
You know, just something enough to run Xcode.

47:50.360 --> 47:54.520
Yeah, but the MacBook Airs are damn powerful now and they're not that expensive.

47:54.520 --> 47:55.520
Today.

47:55.520 --> 47:56.520
Right.

47:56.520 --> 47:59.560
Well, the 20% Tim Cook markup could happen, I guess.

47:59.560 --> 48:02.880
No, I just, you know, you take this thing out a few years, I could see it.

48:02.880 --> 48:06.280
I think where this would really take things to the next level is if it let you develop

48:06.280 --> 48:08.000
on other platforms other than Mac OS.

48:08.000 --> 48:09.000
They will never do that.

48:09.000 --> 48:10.000
Never.

48:10.000 --> 48:11.000
Never.

48:11.000 --> 48:13.800
I would pay for it if they did that.

48:13.800 --> 48:14.800
Yeah.

48:14.800 --> 48:15.800
Right?

48:15.800 --> 48:21.280
I mean, the truth is if you're a medium sized business enterprise, it's just better to buy

48:21.280 --> 48:27.960
a Mac mini, put it in a closet somewhere and centralize all your code signing that way.

48:27.960 --> 48:30.280
And you spend what?

48:30.280 --> 48:35.760
If you really want to go balls to the walls, you spend what 2100, 2200 once.

48:35.760 --> 48:36.940
Take the write off, right?

48:36.940 --> 48:38.400
And then you throw it in the closet.

48:38.400 --> 48:41.600
I have a very sad Mac mini for that reason.

48:41.600 --> 48:45.920
Although my goddamn MacBook Air is faster than it, which now is a MacBook Pro 16 inch,

48:45.920 --> 48:52.520
but all right, so I guess they're not getting a subscription out of you.

48:52.520 --> 48:56.080
No, you know, I mean, there are things they could add to it, right?

48:56.080 --> 49:00.900
Like there used to be, I forgot the name of the service, but where they would actually

49:00.900 --> 49:06.240
test it on different devices and form factors and send you back the screenshots of an automated

49:06.240 --> 49:12.680
like Selenium script running and touching different touch points that would be of value.

49:12.680 --> 49:16.880
But again, this is kind of a product of their own success.

49:16.880 --> 49:19.980
Xcode doesn't suck as much as it used to.

49:19.980 --> 49:25.120
And you could basically do this locally with, well, Selenium, which, but to be clear, the

49:25.120 --> 49:28.440
thing I just described does not appear to be a service they're offering, right?

49:28.440 --> 49:33.040
This really does look like running your Xcode tests, making a build, handling distribution

49:33.040 --> 49:36.480
in the Xcode Cloud.

49:36.480 --> 49:38.840
All right, well, let's round out the show with a few boosts.

49:38.840 --> 49:44.360
We got 2000 stats from Nev who boosted into the show a reliable booster.

49:44.360 --> 49:49.520
He says, Chris, I've been living the UbiForm lifestyle, the uniform lifestyle for 10 years

49:49.520 --> 49:50.520
now.

49:50.520 --> 49:52.440
It's just a plain white t-shirt and jeans.

49:52.440 --> 49:57.440
My biggest recommendation is that you have a few optional clothes like maybe a basic

49:57.440 --> 50:02.040
pair of khakis, maybe a few polo shirts, because every now and then you'll want to switch it

50:02.040 --> 50:03.040
up.

50:03.040 --> 50:05.080
But honestly, it's been fine.

50:05.080 --> 50:09.660
It's one less decision I have to make in the morning other than, is it a pants or is it

50:09.660 --> 50:11.520
a pajamas day?

50:11.520 --> 50:16.120
Okay, I'm kind of really liking this idea, and I'm not sure if I can tackle it right

50:16.120 --> 50:21.160
now because you would not believe the chore list I have to get ready for the...

50:21.160 --> 50:24.680
It's one of these things where getting ready for the road trip, three or four things go

50:24.680 --> 50:28.280
on the chore list every day and maybe one thing comes off.

50:28.280 --> 50:30.600
So it's pretty stressful at the moment.

50:30.600 --> 50:36.880
So I don't think I want to take on redoing my whole wardrobe, but I am really liking

50:36.880 --> 50:38.580
this uniform idea.

50:38.580 --> 50:41.640
So I'm going to touch on this.

50:41.640 --> 50:46.600
If I come up with something that's like with JB branded, I may just make it available for

50:46.600 --> 50:47.800
those of you who want to try it too.

50:47.800 --> 50:53.680
I'm sure it'll get a total of four sales, but I might try it because I like...

50:53.680 --> 50:58.800
I mean, I was thinking about, I don't like wearing other people's logos.

50:58.800 --> 51:03.280
Like I'm going to go to the meetup, I should be wearing JB swag, but I don't know.

51:03.280 --> 51:07.400
All my swag either doesn't fit or it's too small, because I've gotten fat or it's faded.

51:07.400 --> 51:08.960
The stuff that does fit, it's faded too.

51:08.960 --> 51:09.960
It's all old.

51:09.960 --> 51:13.760
Yeah, you should totally wear JB stuff to the shows.

51:13.760 --> 51:15.200
This is one more thing to add to my list.

51:15.200 --> 51:17.320
He's making a list.

51:17.320 --> 51:18.400
All right.

51:18.400 --> 51:23.200
Next boost came in from WM2222sats, a row of ducks.

51:23.200 --> 51:25.560
He says, thanks for your thoughts.

51:25.560 --> 51:29.640
He boosted in last week, mentioned that he was on the spectrum and having some challenges

51:29.640 --> 51:31.560
with his workers and kind of feeling left out.

51:31.560 --> 51:35.020
He says, I think I needed to hear what you guys said, especially the part about it just

51:35.020 --> 51:36.120
being work.

51:36.120 --> 51:38.560
I don't have to be friends with any of my coworkers.

51:38.560 --> 51:42.480
I guess I just had a lot of unrealistic expectations going in.

51:42.480 --> 51:45.360
I would add that my last message didn't really paint a clear picture.

51:45.360 --> 51:48.680
There was somewhat some hostile things I had to deal with, but I think I'm just going to

51:48.680 --> 51:51.480
avoid putting too much into this semi-public forum.

51:51.480 --> 51:53.040
He says, you don't have to read this on air.

51:53.040 --> 51:54.280
I just wanted to thank you all.

51:54.280 --> 51:57.000
But I wanted to read it on air because I think it was an interesting reflection that you

51:57.000 --> 51:58.000
made WM.

51:58.000 --> 52:01.320
And I would say, don't write them off either.

52:01.320 --> 52:07.280
You have friends and you have acquaintances and both are valuable.

52:07.280 --> 52:12.800
And a work acquaintance is a lot like a friend, but sometimes when you stop working there,

52:12.800 --> 52:15.020
that relationship kind of fades away.

52:15.020 --> 52:18.580
But while you're there, it's a good, healthy social dynamic that's productive.

52:18.580 --> 52:21.600
So build acquaintances is what I would say.

52:21.600 --> 52:25.100
And then if they turn into friendships, that just happens organically.

52:25.100 --> 52:28.400
But if they don't, that's fine.

52:28.400 --> 52:30.120
You know, you just get your work done.

52:30.120 --> 52:31.940
Everybody's there to get paid.

52:31.940 --> 52:35.680
So we had somebody boost in from Castamatic with no name, but I wanted to read this boost

52:35.680 --> 52:36.800
on the air.

52:36.800 --> 52:40.480
They sent in 5,000 sats.

52:40.480 --> 52:42.760
They call these things wardrobe capsules.

52:42.760 --> 52:47.200
It's a stupid name, but I've been living the hashtag uniform lifestyle for a few years.

52:47.200 --> 52:48.520
It's hecking great.

52:48.520 --> 52:54.000
If the haters lean into it, all right, I'm feeling good about that.

52:54.000 --> 52:55.680
I'm going to do it, dude.

52:55.680 --> 52:57.280
I'm doing it.

52:57.280 --> 52:58.280
I'm doing it.

52:58.280 --> 52:59.360
I'm going uniform style.

52:59.360 --> 53:02.120
If you if you want to join me, you're welcome, but I'm going.

53:02.120 --> 53:11.040
I recommend a nice pair of black, incredibly tight slacks and a gold long sleeve shirt.

53:11.040 --> 53:14.340
You got to have a couple of pips on the one chest, right?

53:14.340 --> 53:16.160
Maybe some sort of triangle logo.

53:16.160 --> 53:19.200
All right, and just walk around in that every day.

53:19.200 --> 53:22.280
You know, I hear those fabrics are designed for comfort, so that should be great.

53:22.280 --> 53:26.240
Well, you got to have your iPhone out and sound like you're scanning everything.

53:26.240 --> 53:28.400
Maybe have the AR mode on.

53:28.400 --> 53:33.400
I have this app called Science Scanner or Sci Scanner, which is just a it's a knockoff

53:33.400 --> 53:37.000
tricorder, but they can't call it a tricorder because they get sued and they can't use the

53:37.000 --> 53:41.720
tricorder sounds, unfortunately, but it still looks like a tricorder.

53:41.720 --> 53:46.320
I hate to admit that I have gone to a Ren Faire and done the Star Trek lost thing.

53:46.320 --> 53:47.320
Yes.

53:47.320 --> 53:48.320
Yes.

53:48.320 --> 53:49.320
Yeah, it's terrible.

53:49.320 --> 53:56.920
Johnny is our big booster this week with 10000 sats.

53:56.920 --> 54:00.240
After listening to last week's episode or whichever it was, when we talked about Google

54:00.240 --> 54:06.440
reporting that dad for taking pictures of his son for telemedicine, he says, Goodbye,

54:06.440 --> 54:07.600
Google.

54:07.600 --> 54:13.400
And I got to tell you, Mike, I'm still thinking about that story every day.

54:13.400 --> 54:14.840
You're haunted.

54:14.840 --> 54:18.360
Last night, Wes and I were like, you know, we were talking about, is it time for me to

54:18.360 --> 54:21.720
get a new Android device and kind of get an updated experience with Android?

54:21.720 --> 54:24.840
Because it's been since the pixel three and maybe I'm getting a little out of date.

54:24.840 --> 54:25.840
Yeah, yada, yada, yada.

54:25.840 --> 54:26.840
And I start looking at it.

54:26.840 --> 54:28.880
You know, the price seems kind of fair.

54:28.880 --> 54:29.880
And then I think.

54:29.880 --> 54:35.020
No, you know what, I'm not going to get any more ties to this company like that line's

54:35.020 --> 54:36.020
been crossed.

54:36.020 --> 54:37.020
I'm done.

54:37.020 --> 54:40.800
And I'm going to take my photos off of Google.

54:40.800 --> 54:46.480
I have not been using Google Maps for a while that also I sort of crossed that line last

54:46.480 --> 54:47.880
summer.

54:47.880 --> 54:51.440
And I think that story was it.

54:51.440 --> 54:56.480
It's not like it's I'm not freaking out, but I in my mind.

54:56.480 --> 55:01.520
Google is now kind of like a hostile territory, like they're not actively hostile, but it's

55:01.520 --> 55:04.920
like I've walked into a bad neighborhood and I need to be really careful and I probably

55:04.920 --> 55:08.880
need to just maybe move my assets out of that neighborhood.

55:08.880 --> 55:09.980
And it's really stuck with me.

55:09.980 --> 55:12.360
It's not it has not faded since we've talked about that story.

55:12.360 --> 55:15.960
I'm I'm really disturbed by what Google did.

55:15.960 --> 55:19.920
So there's that, I guess.

55:19.920 --> 55:20.920
Sometimes maybe that's a good thing.

55:20.920 --> 55:25.280
Maybe that was the that was the story I needed to hear to kind of make it stick.

55:25.280 --> 55:26.280
Perhaps we'll see.

55:26.280 --> 55:29.080
It's so damn hard.

55:29.080 --> 55:30.080
Like Google search.

55:30.080 --> 55:31.080
I don't know if I can stop using that.

55:31.080 --> 55:33.260
I don't find any other stuff is good.

55:33.260 --> 55:38.480
Gmail find that to be the best Google apps for business.

55:38.480 --> 55:39.480
Also good.

55:39.480 --> 55:40.620
Although I don't really care so much about that.

55:40.620 --> 55:42.360
It's more about my personal stuff.

55:42.360 --> 55:45.440
DPG comes in with our last boost of the week that's going on air.

55:45.440 --> 55:47.180
But thank you, everyone who boosted.

55:47.180 --> 55:49.200
They all get read.

55:49.200 --> 55:50.800
Sometimes I'll read extra ones that don't make into the show.

55:50.800 --> 55:53.480
I'll read them in the live stream.

55:53.480 --> 55:54.640
So your support is appreciated.

55:54.640 --> 55:58.120
And DPG comes in with eight thousand eighty five sats.

55:58.120 --> 55:59.120
B-O-O-S-T.

55:59.120 --> 56:04.080
He says in honor of the new Ryzen processors, I thought this amount was appropriate.

56:04.080 --> 56:05.840
Love the show.

56:05.840 --> 56:08.160
The new Ryzen's look so great.

56:08.160 --> 56:09.160
Yeah.

56:09.160 --> 56:10.160
Yeah.

56:10.160 --> 56:12.320
I hope I hope to have more on that in the future.

56:12.320 --> 56:15.640
I'm feeling like it is time for a new machine.

56:15.640 --> 56:20.360
I wanted to get a new desktop before the pandemic and then the supply chain went crazy and I

56:20.360 --> 56:21.360
thought I can wait.

56:21.360 --> 56:23.040
And now I'm really itching.

56:23.040 --> 56:24.040
I like Bill.

56:24.040 --> 56:26.560
I have built up momentum.

56:26.560 --> 56:28.040
Also just a shout out to Golden Dragon.

56:28.040 --> 56:31.480
He said, hey, guys, just 19 shows until episode five hundred.

56:31.480 --> 56:32.480
Keep up the great work.

56:32.480 --> 56:37.000
We got seventeen oh one sats, an enterprise boost from user seventy nine one.

56:37.000 --> 56:38.600
He just wanted to boost some joy in.

56:38.600 --> 56:40.320
He says, please keep the broadcast coming.

56:40.320 --> 56:45.000
And we got two hundred and twenty two sats from oh a guy one who said, you know what?

56:45.000 --> 56:47.440
Keep the advertising pitches in from time to time.

56:47.440 --> 56:53.040
I didn't grab any this week, but every now and then, sparingly, I'll throw a advertising

56:53.040 --> 56:54.880
pitch email in that we get.

56:54.880 --> 56:59.920
We have had weeks where we have got more of those pitches than we've actually got an email

56:59.920 --> 57:00.920
from the audience.

57:00.920 --> 57:01.920
Yeah.

57:01.920 --> 57:02.920
Yeah.

57:02.920 --> 57:03.920
It's usually.

57:03.920 --> 57:06.480
Isn't like the end of the quarter, we usually get hammered.

57:06.480 --> 57:11.320
Yeah, that's got to be it is they got to figure maybe you're getting ready for the next quarter

57:11.320 --> 57:14.960
and you're going to take anything, you know, you'll just and that does happen.

57:14.960 --> 57:18.760
You know, that is the thing is there's and I was just listening to Strattick.

57:18.760 --> 57:24.660
I don't know if you follow Ben Thompson still, but he interviewed the former CEO of Anchor,

57:24.660 --> 57:29.960
the podcasting platform that Spotify bought, and it will send chills down your spine.

57:29.960 --> 57:34.720
They have figured out that their path to making a lot of money is to monetize the hell out

57:34.720 --> 57:39.100
of little podcasts, you know, podcasts with a few hundred downloads, a few thousand downloads

57:39.100 --> 57:42.000
and just ram them up with dynamic ads and stuff.

57:42.000 --> 57:43.900
So but like aggregate aggregate.

57:43.900 --> 57:47.800
So they'll go to what they'll they'll sell like ten thousand downloads, but they'll do

57:47.800 --> 57:50.760
it by running it across, you know, a thousand shows.

57:50.760 --> 57:52.620
That's super sneaky.

57:52.620 --> 57:56.060
And the only way they can do it is by you have to be on their platform.

57:56.060 --> 57:58.360
They have to be able to dynamically reencode your file.

57:58.360 --> 58:01.600
They have to be able to have to do it in their player so they can track everything that the

58:01.600 --> 58:03.280
player is doing.

58:03.280 --> 58:06.400
And the thing is, is they're coming to podcasters who are struggling and they're just saying,

58:06.400 --> 58:07.400
here's a check.

58:07.400 --> 58:08.400
Come on our platform.

58:08.400 --> 58:11.320
Well, you can work with one of our consultants to migrate over to our platform.

58:11.320 --> 58:13.560
Would you like to schedule a call?

58:13.560 --> 58:18.160
And they're going to basically YouTube up Spotify is going to YouTube up podcasting.

58:18.160 --> 58:19.280
That's why we do the boost, right?

58:19.280 --> 58:21.080
So anyways, go get a new podcast app.

58:21.080 --> 58:23.340
Let's keep this thing decentralized new podcast apps dot com.

58:23.340 --> 58:26.340
Let's not let let's not let's not watch that go this direction.

58:26.340 --> 58:30.300
My God, let's not watch another thing go this direction, please.

58:30.300 --> 58:32.320
Also big thank you to our members who make that possible.

58:32.320 --> 58:35.800
You guys are playing a huge role in letting us be picky, choosing the sponsors we work

58:35.800 --> 58:36.800
with.

58:36.800 --> 58:40.080
I genuinely love working with Linode and Talescale.

58:40.080 --> 58:43.240
Use the hell out of them every single day, right?

58:43.240 --> 58:45.560
That doesn't just accidentally happen.

58:45.560 --> 58:49.680
It's because we had the runway, the opportunity to work with those folks.

58:49.680 --> 58:52.520
So thank you, everybody over there, Coder QA dot co.

58:52.520 --> 58:54.680
Go listen to the Coderly and our Matrix room.

58:54.680 --> 58:56.200
Everybody hanging out in our new Matrix chat.

58:56.200 --> 58:57.200
Thank you very much.

58:57.200 --> 59:00.400
If you want to join that Coder dot show slash Matrix going all the time.

59:00.400 --> 59:01.840
And that might be good on the road trip.

59:01.840 --> 59:02.840
You know, you never know.

59:02.840 --> 59:03.920
There might be updates in there.

59:03.920 --> 59:10.680
And of course, you can watch the show on Monday's nine a.m. Pacific noon Eastern over at J.B.

59:10.680 --> 59:13.600
Live dot TV or Jupiter to Mr. Dominic.

59:13.600 --> 59:14.600
Where should we send folks?

59:14.600 --> 59:16.720
Give them some wisdom, some resources.

59:16.720 --> 59:17.720
Well, sure.

59:17.720 --> 59:22.960
So wisdom never tap out before your attacks that always play stuff in your second main

59:22.960 --> 59:24.240
face.

59:24.240 --> 59:25.920
There's your wisdom.

59:25.920 --> 59:27.800
And follow me on Twitter at Domenico.

59:27.800 --> 59:32.720
You'll get coding magic and my October fest.

59:32.720 --> 59:33.720
Sell it brought.

59:33.720 --> 59:34.720
So you I knew you.

59:34.720 --> 59:35.720
Yes.

59:35.720 --> 59:37.920
I knew I did.

59:37.920 --> 59:40.080
This is my favorite time of year for cooking with beer.

59:40.080 --> 59:43.600
So it looks so good.

59:43.600 --> 59:47.680
Wes and I were actually working on some studio stuff and we hadn't just eaten some fried

59:47.680 --> 59:48.680
tip.

59:48.680 --> 59:49.680
I think we would have had to cook up some brats.

59:49.680 --> 59:50.800
We love the beer.

59:50.800 --> 59:51.800
Beer soaked brats.

59:51.800 --> 59:52.800
It's came out good.

59:52.800 --> 59:53.800
Yeah.

59:53.800 --> 59:54.800
Yeah, I bet.

59:54.800 --> 59:55.800
All right.

59:55.800 --> 59:56.800
