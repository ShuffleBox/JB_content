00:00.000 --> 00:16.000
This is KOTOR Radio, episode 469 for June 6, 2022.

00:16.000 --> 00:19.920
Hello friend, welcome back to Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show, taking a pragmatic look

00:19.920 --> 00:25.640
at the art and the business, the software development, and the world of technology.

00:25.640 --> 00:29.640
Positioned right up here from the sunny Pacific Northwest, we're joined as always by our

00:29.640 --> 00:31.520
host, Mr. Dominic.

00:31.520 --> 00:32.520
Hello Mike.

00:32.520 --> 00:37.840
Hello Chris, and your brother in good hair was spending some time with us earlier.

00:37.840 --> 00:40.160
He's sort of the hair king really, isn't he?

00:40.160 --> 00:41.160
Really the lord of the hair.

00:41.160 --> 00:43.920
The hair force one, you could say.

00:43.920 --> 00:44.920
Something else, I tell you what.

00:44.920 --> 00:48.760
Yeah, I also am wearing my uniform.

00:48.760 --> 00:51.280
You like my new, look at that, huh?

00:51.280 --> 00:53.120
Pretty snazzy Star Trek uniform I got here.

00:53.120 --> 00:56.240
I decided now you can just call me Captain Pike.

00:56.240 --> 01:00.160
Well, I have to tell you, I have seen all but the most recent episode of Strange New

01:00.160 --> 01:05.080
Worlds, and with apologies to President Roslin.

01:05.080 --> 01:06.080
I'm in love again.

01:06.080 --> 01:07.080
Oh, really?

01:07.080 --> 01:08.080
Number one, if you will.

01:08.080 --> 01:09.080
If number one, yeah.

01:09.080 --> 01:10.080
Of course.

01:10.080 --> 01:11.080
I know you.

01:11.080 --> 01:12.080
I know you.

01:12.080 --> 01:16.120
For me, I'm kind of a nurse chapel guy myself.

01:16.120 --> 01:18.640
I could see that, because you're a little more quirky over there.

01:18.640 --> 01:21.840
I'm like, no, I want some command presence.

01:21.840 --> 01:25.600
But you know, to tell you the truth, I am pretty impressed with this new Star Trek series.

01:25.600 --> 01:29.720
You and I recently got on here, and we were yelling at the clouds about the new Star Trek

01:29.720 --> 01:33.760
and the kids that write it, and then Strange New Worlds comes along, and they haven't screwed

01:33.760 --> 01:34.760
it up so far.

01:34.760 --> 01:35.760
Yeah, it's really good.

01:35.760 --> 01:37.440
Isn't it the same writers?

01:37.440 --> 01:40.160
It's mostly the same team, but you know, I've been thinking about this.

01:40.160 --> 01:41.640
Why is it so much better, right?

01:41.640 --> 01:42.960
Why is it better?

01:42.960 --> 01:44.520
And I think I've got a few reasons.

01:44.520 --> 01:50.160
I think number one, they had to break out of their mystery box formula, because it isn't

01:50.160 --> 01:54.400
one overarching story where they build and make more and more intense as the season goes

01:54.400 --> 01:55.400
on.

01:55.400 --> 01:59.080
The problem there, that I always have with Picard and Discovery, is they don't deliver

01:59.080 --> 02:02.200
when they build and they build and they build, and then they just don't deliver.

02:02.200 --> 02:06.680
The ending, like the season finale, it's always such a mediocre delivery.

02:06.680 --> 02:10.680
But with the episodic nature of Strange New Worlds, they can't do that.

02:10.680 --> 02:13.520
They can't just keep opening mystery box after mystery box.

02:13.520 --> 02:17.680
They kind of have to keep it tidy per episode, and they're doing character arc stuff.

02:17.680 --> 02:23.160
But that, I think, has been a big limiter, and I think it's forced them to solve a big

02:23.160 --> 02:24.360
issue that a lot of us had with it.

02:24.360 --> 02:29.720
I think number two, they're working with legitimate source material, right?

02:29.720 --> 02:32.360
This is a 50-year-old pilot they're working with here.

02:32.360 --> 02:34.660
The source material was created by the original team.

02:34.660 --> 02:37.680
It isn't a whole cloth creation like Discovery and Picard are.

02:37.680 --> 02:40.960
Yeah, I mean, they can't have that much source material, can they, though?

02:40.960 --> 02:42.320
They've got to be doing something.

02:42.320 --> 02:46.540
I mean, you've got Spock, you've got Ohura, you've got the Enterprise, you've got Pike,

02:46.540 --> 02:50.120
you've got the Era, you've got all of the stuff that we know about that Era, like the

02:50.120 --> 02:52.080
Klingons, the Romulans, right?

02:52.080 --> 02:56.940
It really provides them, yet it's like a framework.

02:56.940 --> 02:59.860
But because it's so vague, like you kind of just said, there's also a lot they can... It's

02:59.860 --> 03:04.520
sort of like the perfect balance for this new writing team, I think.

03:04.520 --> 03:05.520
This is my theory, at least.

03:05.520 --> 03:10.440
This is... Because you want to look at it almost from a product development standpoint,

03:10.440 --> 03:13.840
because the first couple of versions, Picard and Discovery they launched, I think don't

03:13.840 --> 03:14.840
hold up as products.

03:14.840 --> 03:17.340
I think they had systemic problems.

03:17.340 --> 03:21.480
But then they got this one so far, they've got it right.

03:21.480 --> 03:23.080
Now, they could still screw it up.

03:23.080 --> 03:24.360
But what changed, right?

03:24.360 --> 03:26.560
And was it an institutional thing?

03:26.560 --> 03:27.980
Was it a leadership change?

03:27.980 --> 03:29.280
Was it a team change?

03:29.280 --> 03:32.440
Was it new constraints that just forced a better outcome?

03:32.440 --> 03:33.440
Sometimes it's that.

03:33.440 --> 03:36.240
But I can't help but think, what changed?

03:36.240 --> 03:38.080
What made it a better product?

03:38.080 --> 03:40.240
That I think there's a lesson in there for anybody.

03:40.240 --> 03:43.360
I wonder if it's that we all know how the story with Captain Pike goes.

03:43.360 --> 03:47.800
I think the fans would have an uproar if they did some alternate universe BS and saved him,

03:47.800 --> 03:48.800
right?

03:48.800 --> 03:51.880
I don't know, 40-year-old spoilers, I guess?

03:51.880 --> 03:53.880
Yeah, actually I think it's near 50, actually.

03:53.880 --> 03:54.880
Near 50-year-old spoilers?

03:54.880 --> 03:55.880
Maybe.

03:55.880 --> 03:56.880
Dude doesn't do well.

03:56.880 --> 04:00.120
I mean, he does... Well, it ends badly.

04:00.120 --> 04:01.120
I don't know.

04:01.120 --> 04:02.120
I like it.

04:02.120 --> 04:04.800
I will say, I loved the first couple episodes of Picard, and then I was just like, this

04:04.800 --> 04:08.680
is very... There's just a lot of nothing happening here.

04:08.680 --> 04:09.680
There is that.

04:09.680 --> 04:12.080
So they are right at the point where sometimes New Trek loses me.

04:12.080 --> 04:13.080
I don't know.

04:13.080 --> 04:14.080
It was really good.

04:14.080 --> 04:18.440
And I know this episode I haven't seen yet, Shoreleaf, and I just want to hope that they

04:18.440 --> 04:20.640
have those statues on Ryza.

04:20.640 --> 04:22.560
Oh, is that the next episode?

04:22.560 --> 04:23.560
Huh.

04:23.560 --> 04:24.560
Okay, I haven't seen that.

04:24.560 --> 04:25.560
Oh, maybe I'm not behind.

04:25.560 --> 04:26.560
They come out on Thursdays, don't they?

04:26.560 --> 04:27.560
Yeah.

04:27.560 --> 04:30.160
So it'll be the day after this episode comes out.

04:30.160 --> 04:31.160
So we're recording on Monday.

04:31.160 --> 04:33.160
Today was WWDC 2022.

04:33.160 --> 04:35.720
Yes, we all returned to the mothership.

04:35.720 --> 04:41.200
I am totally discombobulated because I didn't get in until right before the stream starts.

04:41.200 --> 04:44.080
So this is going to be a focus show is what I like to call it.

04:44.080 --> 04:47.360
And I think, you know what you and I need to figure out, which we could have talked

04:47.360 --> 04:48.360
about earlier.

04:48.360 --> 04:50.920
But we got to figure out when we're going to do a double because you're traveling and

04:50.920 --> 04:52.680
I'm traveling soon.

04:52.680 --> 04:56.320
So I was thinking maybe like the next thing we record is a feedback special.

04:56.320 --> 05:00.240
I was thinking that or or we shouldn't be doing this on the air.

05:00.240 --> 05:01.240
I don't think.

05:01.240 --> 05:02.240
But why not?

05:02.240 --> 05:03.240
Production meeting time.

05:03.240 --> 05:04.240
I do have that dev one.

05:04.240 --> 05:06.840
Oh, I think we should talk about that today, possibly today.

05:06.840 --> 05:07.840
First impression.

05:07.840 --> 05:08.840
All right.

05:08.840 --> 05:09.840
All right.

05:09.840 --> 05:10.840
Yeah.

05:10.840 --> 05:11.840
First impressions today.

05:11.840 --> 05:12.840
Yeah.

05:12.840 --> 05:13.840
But we'll chat more.

05:13.840 --> 05:14.840
We might actually need to prerecord two episodes.

05:14.840 --> 05:15.840
I don't know.

05:15.840 --> 05:16.840
But you and I'll sync up.

05:16.840 --> 05:17.840
So I don't have much feedback for today's episode.

05:17.840 --> 05:22.160
But I thought we'd start with a couple of WWDC highlights and what kind of just work

05:22.160 --> 05:25.260
through what you and I found interesting.

05:25.260 --> 05:28.840
Apple mentioned right at the top they have thirty four million developers.

05:28.840 --> 05:29.840
That's a lot.

05:29.840 --> 05:31.600
A hundred dollar a year subscriptions.

05:31.600 --> 05:35.100
I'm sure some of those are free, but thirty four million devs is their biggest number

05:35.100 --> 05:36.680
ever.

05:36.680 --> 05:39.480
They really went all in on Craig Federici this year.

05:39.480 --> 05:43.480
They have like glorious Mission Impossible meets Air Force One.

05:43.480 --> 05:44.720
I actually loved all of them.

05:44.720 --> 05:48.960
They were so on the on the edge of being too much.

05:48.960 --> 05:55.000
But I loved him, especially that one where he super ran like speed and put his hair back.

05:55.000 --> 05:56.900
I might have a man crush on Craig Federici.

05:56.900 --> 06:00.560
The only problem is when he tries to be earnest and he tries to be earnest about your privacy

06:00.560 --> 06:01.560
and stuff like that.

06:01.560 --> 06:02.560
I don't buy it anymore.

06:02.560 --> 06:04.640
I also don't buy his epic basketball shot.

06:04.640 --> 06:06.960
I don't think he made it across town.

06:06.960 --> 06:07.960
OK.

06:07.960 --> 06:08.960
That's where they went too far.

06:08.960 --> 06:11.560
Is the the Swift a track suit?

06:11.560 --> 06:12.560
Yeah.

06:12.560 --> 06:13.560
Yeah.

06:13.560 --> 06:14.560
It was too far.

06:14.560 --> 06:15.560
It was too much.

06:15.560 --> 06:20.880
I feel like that conference where I watched Craig Federici try to claim that, you know,

06:20.880 --> 06:24.100
any kind of sideloading at all would hurt mom and grandma.

06:24.100 --> 06:26.200
It changed forever how I see that guy now.

06:26.200 --> 06:31.440
Like when I see him get all earnest about safety, I just don't really buy it.

06:31.440 --> 06:33.680
It seems like he's acting.

06:33.680 --> 06:36.800
I also thought the Tim Cook stuff seemed a little rushed.

06:36.800 --> 06:38.320
It was just boom Tim Cook.

06:38.320 --> 06:41.620
He was kind of going like he needed another couple of takes.

06:41.620 --> 06:45.680
This was like his first or second take of the read and he was rushing through it.

06:45.680 --> 06:47.260
They didn't treat the audio.

06:47.260 --> 06:49.560
So there's because I'm listening on my studio headphones.

06:49.560 --> 06:52.600
There's a crazy echo on Tim's audio.

06:52.600 --> 06:56.040
They did and they've shot in those locations before without that problem.

06:56.040 --> 06:59.840
And Tim Cook just kind of he just he blazes through the beginning and he blazes through

06:59.840 --> 07:00.840
the end.

07:00.840 --> 07:05.280
They were both clearly shot at the same location at the same exact time of day.

07:05.280 --> 07:08.760
They got like 20 minutes with Tim this time and they just rushed it.

07:08.760 --> 07:12.120
And I find that wild considering this is their most public thing they do now.

07:12.120 --> 07:16.640
I feel like Craig Federighi is just kind of better at the kind of silly, you know, showman

07:16.640 --> 07:17.640
stuff.

07:17.640 --> 07:18.640
Oh, no doubt about it.

07:18.640 --> 07:19.640
Craig's the better showman.

07:19.640 --> 07:27.280
But Tim's previous introductions were much more produced like they were the camera shots

07:27.280 --> 07:28.280
were better.

07:28.280 --> 07:29.760
The audio was better.

07:29.760 --> 07:31.280
Tim's reads were better.

07:31.280 --> 07:33.760
You know, when you're working with somebody who's not familiar with any of that stuff,

07:33.760 --> 07:37.320
they generally need a couple of passes at it before they get a real natural on camera

07:37.320 --> 07:38.320
read.

07:38.320 --> 07:40.520
I didn't really bother with that with the intro or the outro.

07:40.520 --> 07:43.480
And he didn't show up at all in the rest of the video.

07:43.480 --> 07:45.600
Just an interesting observation, I thought.

07:45.600 --> 07:46.960
Probably fine.

07:46.960 --> 07:51.220
I felt like there was an overall theme to this WWDC.

07:51.220 --> 07:57.400
And not to be cliche, but I really felt this WWDC theme was finally like we're finally

07:57.400 --> 07:59.240
getting this stuff.

07:59.240 --> 08:00.820
Some of it it's like I'm kind of angry.

08:00.820 --> 08:04.240
It's only now arriving and some of it's you know, it's great to see it here.

08:04.240 --> 08:07.240
Like they made a big start with the new lock screen.

08:07.240 --> 08:08.600
It looks great.

08:08.600 --> 08:10.480
It reminds me of watch customizations.

08:10.480 --> 08:12.480
But I can't believe we're 10 years into this thing.

08:12.480 --> 08:13.800
We're finally getting this.

08:13.800 --> 08:14.800
Yes.

08:14.800 --> 08:19.880
And the whole profiles thing, which is directly related to the to the lock screen is I looked

08:19.880 --> 08:23.760
it up was a feature of WebOS way back in the day.

08:23.760 --> 08:24.760
Yeah.

08:24.760 --> 08:26.880
And different Android vendors took cracks at this, too.

08:26.880 --> 08:27.880
Yeah.

08:27.880 --> 08:29.720
Generally, Apple does a better implementation when they do.

08:29.720 --> 08:32.960
And they one thing I liked is right off the top.

08:32.960 --> 08:35.560
They're like API for this API for this.

08:35.560 --> 08:39.600
Like the new lock screen, there's a live activities API, the new focus mode.

08:39.600 --> 08:43.000
There's now a focus filter API that extends into apps.

08:43.000 --> 08:44.000
You know, that kind of stuff.

08:44.000 --> 08:45.000
Right.

08:45.000 --> 08:49.080
There's now a new shared with you API for messages so you can reach into their new APIs

08:49.080 --> 08:50.920
for dictation, new APIs for maps.

08:50.920 --> 08:52.520
They just boom, boom, boom, boom.

08:52.520 --> 08:56.460
Every time in the beginning, it didn't keep going like this, but at the very beginning

08:56.460 --> 08:59.980
of the keynote, everything they announced, they said, and there's an API for it.

08:59.980 --> 09:00.980
That's good to see.

09:00.980 --> 09:01.980
That feels right.

09:01.980 --> 09:04.440
Like that's how they should be at a developer conference.

09:04.440 --> 09:08.460
And the one thing that I noticed and I'm curious your thoughts on this.

09:08.460 --> 09:10.900
They are really clever with their messages strategy.

09:10.900 --> 09:14.360
And I think most of the chat room that was watching live didn't get it.

09:14.360 --> 09:18.580
Messages has been this steady iteration of improvements.

09:18.580 --> 09:24.060
A lot of times it's like features other stuff have had like marker group thread as unread.

09:24.060 --> 09:26.040
They just got that.

09:26.040 --> 09:27.460
But it works, doesn't it?

09:27.460 --> 09:30.620
Because you don't want to move the gas pedal on the average user.

09:30.620 --> 09:31.920
And this is an average user app.

09:31.920 --> 09:32.920
Yeah.

09:32.920 --> 09:37.300
I mean, we've been schooled by the younger folks that listen or about the whole green

09:37.300 --> 09:39.040
bubble thing, right?

09:39.040 --> 09:44.680
So I mean, I, you know, I'm notorious for typos and it was funny when he did the one

09:44.680 --> 09:49.820
that said, babe and Gabe, I've done something very similar and you just want to change that,

09:49.820 --> 09:50.820
right?

09:50.820 --> 09:53.820
You just want to like have that not be like something that can come back, you know, 10

09:53.820 --> 09:54.820
years.

09:54.820 --> 09:55.820
Well, I had an embarrassing type.

09:55.820 --> 10:00.260
One of my dad that was one of those things, you know, I was like, oh my God, sorry dad.

10:00.260 --> 10:01.260
Yeah.

10:01.260 --> 10:02.260
It's good to see that stuff.

10:02.260 --> 10:03.260
I suppose.

10:03.260 --> 10:06.860
I think in general, Apple has pretty good family stuff, but I think they finally address

10:06.860 --> 10:08.560
the shared photo album.

10:08.560 --> 10:12.820
We've gotten questions into the show about this and this isn't too revolutionary, but

10:12.820 --> 10:16.180
the idea is that it looks like it's going to use some like face ID.

10:16.180 --> 10:17.180
Yeah.

10:17.180 --> 10:22.060
I mean like identifying the faces in the photo albums, it's going to use location information.

10:22.060 --> 10:27.100
It's going to use your family sharing settings and a feature that I think is clever when

10:27.100 --> 10:32.820
you're in the camera app taking the picture, there'll be a little indication if this is

10:32.820 --> 10:36.740
a photo that's going to your private library or your family library and you can tap to

10:36.740 --> 10:38.660
toggle that.

10:38.660 --> 10:42.120
Nothing really, no developer story here, but I actually really like this from an end user's

10:42.120 --> 10:48.260
perspective because I've got devices I'm taking pictures with, my wife does, now my kids do

10:48.260 --> 10:49.700
and Angela does.

10:49.700 --> 10:51.660
We're all in one family sharing group.

10:51.660 --> 10:55.540
We are constantly trying to figure out best ways to share photos.

10:55.540 --> 10:57.380
And of course, it's all synced to iCloud and backed up.

10:57.380 --> 11:01.980
I mean, for average users, these are table stakes features that again, finally-

11:01.980 --> 11:02.980
Yep.

11:02.980 --> 11:06.220
I mean, I feel the parental control stuff I think was good.

11:06.220 --> 11:10.580
Maybe not super interesting for the show, but it goes into your family sharing thing

11:10.580 --> 11:11.580
right easily.

11:11.580 --> 11:17.100
Oh, you know, every couple of years, kid has to get a new iPad because weirdly enough,

11:17.100 --> 11:18.940
schools use them now, right?

11:18.940 --> 11:21.740
But you want to lock that stuff down if it is not school issued.

11:21.740 --> 11:22.740
Yeah.

11:22.740 --> 11:25.060
And it looks like you're going to be able to set that up up front now, right?

11:25.060 --> 11:27.980
Up front and be able to control it from your device rather than have to be like, give me

11:27.980 --> 11:28.980
the thing.

11:28.980 --> 11:29.980
I got to go into settings, blah, blah, blah.

11:29.980 --> 11:30.980
Yeah.

11:30.980 --> 11:34.500
And a little NFC setup too, so you can bring your phone to their iPad and start just setting

11:34.500 --> 11:35.500
it up automatically.

11:35.500 --> 11:36.500
Yep.

11:36.500 --> 11:37.500
Love it.

11:37.500 --> 11:43.820
I like the kind of just when we jumped over the new shared with you API, depending on

11:43.820 --> 11:49.860
how robust that is, that could be really cool when you tie it to shortcuts, right?

11:49.860 --> 11:53.260
Or even just like automation workflows.

11:53.260 --> 11:57.740
You know, oh, get me all the pictures that grandma sent, right?

11:57.740 --> 12:02.460
I'm in a very family oriented boat apparently right now, but you could see how that could

12:02.460 --> 12:08.460
really just ease a lot of the like, ah, copy, paste, blah, blah, blah, go back, get another

12:08.460 --> 12:09.460
one, copy, paste.

12:09.460 --> 12:10.460
Yeah.

12:10.460 --> 12:14.100
And it'd be a great way to just make sure you're always grabbing the photos and backing

12:14.100 --> 12:17.100
them up and you're not accidentally letting them expire and lose them.

12:17.100 --> 12:20.900
And yeah, especially when you pair with automation, I can see that really nice.

12:20.900 --> 12:24.460
There was one that our chat room was like, I think the most universally against one of

12:24.460 --> 12:25.700
the announcements.

12:25.700 --> 12:31.620
And this was the full CarPlay takeover, your, all your dash, your whole dashboard, everything.

12:31.620 --> 12:35.620
How often does it, I can tell you from my experience, my phone dies all the time, right?

12:35.620 --> 12:38.020
If I'm running around going from place to place.

12:38.020 --> 12:40.300
And also that seems really distracting to me.

12:40.300 --> 12:44.460
I have no doubt they would build in some sort of can't edit while you're moving feature,

12:44.460 --> 12:46.100
you know, accelerometer detects movement.

12:46.100 --> 12:47.540
They just disable editing.

12:47.540 --> 12:48.540
Ford's going to have to build their own UI.

12:48.540 --> 12:52.020
I guess I have to be like, you don't have your iPhone with you fall back to something

12:52.020 --> 12:53.020
sane.

12:53.020 --> 12:56.060
Oh man, that means this is going to suck, right?

12:56.060 --> 12:57.060
I hadn't.

12:57.060 --> 12:58.060
Of course.

12:58.060 --> 13:00.980
So that was like 20 manufacturers are claiming they're going to support this.

13:00.980 --> 13:06.780
I'll play devil's advocate and just say, you know, I, I agree that CarPlay is a mandatory

13:06.780 --> 13:13.420
feature or Android auto if I'm using the Android because ultimately it is a much better experience

13:13.420 --> 13:16.940
than anything that the vendors provide.

13:16.940 --> 13:21.620
And like one of the reasons why I don't really want a Tesla is because I can't do CarPlay

13:21.620 --> 13:22.620
on it.

13:22.620 --> 13:25.900
And I know that sounds crazy and I'd probably get over it, but I love having my podcasts

13:25.900 --> 13:27.620
and my nav and everything can be on my phone.

13:27.620 --> 13:28.900
I can look a route up on my phone.

13:28.900 --> 13:33.380
I can download podcasts on a phone, all that stuff you can do on your phone and then I

13:33.380 --> 13:37.340
can just go plug it into my dash and I have all of it on the screen of my car.

13:37.340 --> 13:38.340
I love that.

13:38.340 --> 13:42.980
Uh, I could see it being a better experience than what any manufacturer is going to make,

13:42.980 --> 13:43.980
but you're right.

13:43.980 --> 13:44.980
They could never depend on it.

13:44.980 --> 13:49.820
So of course it's going to be like an application that's running on the vendor's platform.

13:49.820 --> 13:50.820
I don't know.

13:50.820 --> 13:54.660
It does make you think maybe Apple does have some like division internally that's doing

13:54.660 --> 13:55.660
car stuff.

13:55.660 --> 13:59.700
Even if it's just for these kinds of products and not ever going to result in an actual

13:59.700 --> 14:00.700
car.

14:00.700 --> 14:01.700
Could be.

14:01.700 --> 14:02.700
Yeah.

14:02.700 --> 14:07.620
I personally super excited to see them spend so much time talking about matter up on stage.

14:07.620 --> 14:15.420
Matter is a multi-vendor home automation protocol basically, and it includes Amazon and Google

14:15.420 --> 14:20.540
and Microsoft and the Zigbee foundation and a whole bunch of vendors.

14:20.540 --> 14:25.240
And the great thing about it is it requires to be compliant with the matter standard.

14:25.240 --> 14:31.160
Vendors must implement a local control API so you can control devices over your land.

14:31.160 --> 14:36.780
It's a requirement to be compliant with the spec, no cloud services dependencies.

14:36.780 --> 14:40.300
Now you can use cloud services and you can offer additional services, but the minimum

14:40.300 --> 14:43.580
spec requires that you have a local control protocol.

14:43.580 --> 14:44.580
That's a big deal.

14:44.580 --> 14:49.020
And so to see Apple up on stage pushing it when it's been sort of lagging, I felt was

14:49.020 --> 14:51.340
a big moment for the matter protocol.

14:51.340 --> 14:55.380
I think this WWDC just changed the game for matter.

14:55.380 --> 14:58.180
So for us in like the self-hosting community, this is a big deal.

14:58.180 --> 14:59.180
Yeah.

14:59.180 --> 15:03.900
It would be great if a standard kind of became de facto and we could get.

15:03.900 --> 15:07.220
I don't do a bunch of the home automation stuff, but from what I hear from self-hosted

15:07.220 --> 15:12.140
and just a weird guy I know who complains about it all the time, not Chris, is that

15:12.140 --> 15:14.440
none of this stuff is really compatible.

15:14.440 --> 15:18.620
So like HomeKit's its own little dimension and yeah.

15:18.620 --> 15:23.780
Before we get into like OS and APIs and all that kind of stuff, I just wanted to get your

15:23.780 --> 15:26.440
opinion on the heart stuff they talked about.

15:26.440 --> 15:28.840
They have new tools now to monitor for stroke.

15:28.840 --> 15:30.900
They have AFib history.

15:30.900 --> 15:34.960
They've updated the health app to like display all your AFib information and to export it

15:34.960 --> 15:37.320
as a PDF for your doctor to review.

15:37.320 --> 15:39.740
They seem to have a real focus on heart health.

15:39.740 --> 15:40.740
Yeah.

15:40.740 --> 15:41.740
I think it's all good.

15:41.740 --> 15:42.740
I mean, I use the current stuff.

15:42.740 --> 15:48.060
So when iOS 9 comes out in production mode for Apple Watch, I'll use that too.

15:48.060 --> 15:49.060
I think it's good.

15:49.060 --> 15:53.220
It's a watch is perfectly placed to also get that information.

15:53.220 --> 15:56.540
If you're not wearing it in some weird way, like up your arm.

15:56.540 --> 15:57.540
I like it.

15:57.540 --> 15:58.540
I think they do a good job.

15:58.540 --> 16:02.500
They're pretty accurate if you wear your watch with the proper tightness.

16:02.500 --> 16:07.380
I mean, I kind of like all the fitness stuff as I'm trying to get in better shape.

16:07.380 --> 16:12.860
They seem to, you know, they seem to be really focused on progressing your fitness rather

16:12.860 --> 16:16.200
than just saying hit your steps.

16:16.200 --> 16:20.500
In particular, the heart zone rate monitor is interesting because you could say, I don't

16:20.500 --> 16:24.680
for someone who has a heart problem, you maybe don't want to go above a certain zone, right?

16:24.680 --> 16:31.980
Maybe you want to stay, the goal is to stay low, not to go high unless you have to.

16:31.980 --> 16:33.580
Linode.com slash coder.

16:33.580 --> 16:38.100
Go there to get $100 in 60 day credit on a new account and you go to support this here

16:38.100 --> 16:39.100
show.

16:39.100 --> 16:42.380
Keep the coder program going by going over to Linode.com slash coder.

16:42.380 --> 16:45.120
Linode is fast, reliable cloud hosting.

16:45.120 --> 16:46.420
You got to try it for your next project.

16:46.420 --> 16:48.880
That's how I've deployed everything for the last couple and a half years, but I am so

16:48.880 --> 16:51.060
impressed by the project that we did this last weekend.

16:51.060 --> 16:56.260
We set up PeerTube again on Linode, using its object storage as our backend for our

16:56.260 --> 16:57.540
video storage.

16:57.540 --> 17:04.340
And during WWDC, we had several hundred people live streaming from our Linode PeerTube instance

17:04.340 --> 17:06.480
and it worked fantastic.

17:06.480 --> 17:10.900
And now those videos are up there available for playback, streamed straight from Linode's

17:10.900 --> 17:11.900
object storage.

17:11.900 --> 17:13.740
And they got 11 data centers around the world.

17:13.740 --> 17:18.180
So if you want to deploy something for yourself, they got something close to you or your customers.

17:18.180 --> 17:21.480
If you want something with extremely high throughput, they have AMD epic processors.

17:21.480 --> 17:23.460
They have MVME storage.

17:23.460 --> 17:27.300
They even have 40 gigabit connections coming into the hypervisors, but the best part, they

17:27.300 --> 17:28.820
are their own ISP.

17:28.820 --> 17:30.700
So they just have fantastic connectivity.

17:30.700 --> 17:34.460
And then you combine that with the best support in the business.

17:34.460 --> 17:39.320
The massive hyperscalers that want to lock you into their esoteric platforms can't afford

17:39.320 --> 17:41.300
to do the level of support that Linode can.

17:41.300 --> 17:46.780
And as far as features go and the UI, well, Linode has been refining that for 19 years,

17:46.780 --> 17:49.060
steadily making it better and better.

17:49.060 --> 17:52.540
And now it's the best place to run an application on Linux.

17:52.540 --> 17:55.500
They recently introduced managed databases as well.

17:55.500 --> 17:59.180
I've told you I love their object storage, their cloud firewalls, their alerts that you

17:59.180 --> 18:03.340
can simply configure, their dashboard that makes it simple to see what your machine is

18:03.340 --> 18:07.760
up to, and of course, the support and the performance.

18:07.760 --> 18:12.780
Go build something, go learn something, try something and support the show.

18:12.780 --> 18:22.860
Just go to linode.com slash coder, get that $100 and try it out, linode.com slash coder.

18:22.860 --> 18:30.160
I think the biggest item that got your attention and my attention is the M2 was announced,

18:30.160 --> 18:31.780
and there's a lot here.

18:31.780 --> 18:37.100
50% more memory bandwidth, up to 24 gigabytes of RAM on the base M model, eight core CPU,

18:37.100 --> 18:40.220
that's four high performance, four efficiency cores.

18:40.220 --> 18:47.820
They're saying on average it's about 18% faster than the M1, about 1.9X, that's 1.9 times

18:47.820 --> 18:53.980
the performance of an Intel chip at the same power level, so nearly twice the performance.

18:53.980 --> 18:58.980
And they have a now 10 core next gen GPU, that's two more cores than the M1.

18:58.980 --> 19:04.660
They're claiming 25% better GPU performance at the same power level as the M1.

19:04.660 --> 19:09.380
They have a new next generation neural processor unit in there, a new next generation secure

19:09.380 --> 19:10.920
enclave in there.

19:10.920 --> 19:15.740
The media encoding engine has been greatly improved, multiple 4K and 8K streams, ProRes

19:15.740 --> 19:18.200
encode and decode, et cetera, et cetera.

19:18.200 --> 19:23.540
The new M2 chip, I don't think it's an exaggeration to say they're lapping Intel again, they're

19:23.540 --> 19:26.280
looping them now, it's a loop.

19:26.280 --> 19:28.840
It's a pretty impressive display.

19:28.840 --> 19:33.700
Did you also notice that they had to compare them to old Intel Macs too, just to?

19:33.700 --> 19:37.580
Yeah, that's where it's brutal.

19:37.580 --> 19:38.580
That was really brutal.

19:38.580 --> 19:42.820
So you see it all come together in the M2 MacBook Air.

19:42.820 --> 19:48.180
They touted that the MacBook Air is the world's best selling laptop and it's got a new square

19:48.180 --> 19:49.180
design.

19:49.180 --> 19:54.580
It's 20% thinner, they've popped the screen edge to edge basically, they've brought the

19:54.580 --> 20:03.060
ports back, they brought MagSafe back, it's fanless, oh man, it looks like a killer machine.

20:03.060 --> 20:04.220
It looks like a good machine.

20:04.220 --> 20:08.380
It's got the notch, but I think the notch isn't as big a deal as some people would say.

20:08.380 --> 20:13.640
It's a good machine.

20:13.640 --> 20:17.020
It's like the M1, it's interesting too, the pricing's pretty competitive.

20:17.020 --> 20:21.740
The M1 is now 999 and this one is, what, 1099?

20:21.740 --> 20:25.180
Yeah, 1199, yeah, 1200 bucks.

20:25.180 --> 20:29.420
For a laptop, it's pretty well specced at 1200 bucks.

20:29.420 --> 20:33.260
You could buy the base model and use it for six, seven years pretty easily.

20:33.260 --> 20:35.420
Yep, and then there's the 13 inch Pro.

20:35.420 --> 20:40.300
Well, no, I would destroy it in three days, or when the next model comes out.

20:40.300 --> 20:42.220
Right, of course, accidentally.

20:42.220 --> 20:43.220
Accidentally.

20:43.220 --> 20:48.220
But the MacBook Pro, 13 inch, another respectable choice for those of us who sometimes do air

20:48.220 --> 20:52.260
travel and can't open large laptops because we're chunky.

20:52.260 --> 20:53.260
I like it.

20:53.260 --> 20:56.660
I like how they can't say fans though, they have to say active cooling system.

20:56.660 --> 21:00.140
It's like the most Apple thing possible.

21:00.140 --> 21:02.200
Fans are beneath us, so we say active cooling.

21:02.200 --> 21:06.300
We have an active cooling system to sustain performance, but then they're not really clear

21:06.300 --> 21:11.460
like what the difference is between fanless and active cooling, other than just more performance.

21:11.460 --> 21:15.860
So if you want more performance, you gotta get the Pro, but then you're also getting

21:15.860 --> 21:16.860
fans.

21:16.860 --> 21:18.340
Well, you know how, I mean, you know what it is, right?

21:18.340 --> 21:21.900
They use the low energy cores more in the air and blah, blah, blah.

21:21.900 --> 21:22.900
Yeah, yeah.

21:22.900 --> 21:24.780
No, yeah, they do a good job of managing the fans.

21:24.780 --> 21:28.740
I still have yet to hear the fans in my 16 as far as I can remember.

21:28.740 --> 21:32.380
I think maybe once in the Mac Mini M1, I've heard the fans kick up when I was doing like

21:32.380 --> 21:34.340
a trillion things on it.

21:34.340 --> 21:39.540
They're claiming that it's 39% faster in some photo filter work than the M1, 40% faster

21:39.540 --> 21:44.260
in gaming performance, 20 hours of video playback on the MacBook Pro.

21:44.260 --> 21:49.380
P3 wide color gamut display, $1,300.

21:49.380 --> 21:54.580
It's expensive, but I would argue that if you were to spec an Intel equivalent at $1,300,

21:54.580 --> 21:58.300
I bet you that MacBook comes out on top.

21:58.300 --> 22:01.420
Probably the thing that, I don't know, I'm going to guess you probably care the most

22:01.420 --> 22:05.180
about, maybe not, is Mac OS Ace Ventura.

22:05.180 --> 22:09.100
You know, it kind of blows to be the Alfred app, I guess, because Spotlight's getting

22:09.100 --> 22:12.140
a lot of the features that power users use.

22:12.140 --> 22:15.220
Safari changes, I didn't have time before the show to really read into them.

22:15.220 --> 22:19.860
I'm hoping that Apple is like, although I honestly care more about mobile Safari than

22:19.860 --> 22:21.140
I do Safari.

22:21.140 --> 22:26.860
So let's just like keep embracing standards and not being jerks about things.

22:26.860 --> 22:31.900
No, passkey looks interesting for your password, you know, management needs.

22:31.900 --> 22:35.900
You know, the stuff that I was like, blah, like I never give a crap about mail.

22:35.900 --> 22:40.580
Stage manager, I don't really think that, I use magnet, right?

22:40.580 --> 22:42.300
I like tiled windows, so.

22:42.300 --> 22:46.060
Is this Apple attempting to bring some sort of window management system?

22:46.060 --> 22:47.060
What is this?

22:47.060 --> 22:50.160
So stage manager is this new way to auto arrange windows.

22:50.160 --> 22:52.220
You can group windows together.

22:52.220 --> 22:56.740
It brings one to center focus and slides the other off to like a new kind of dock on the

22:56.740 --> 22:57.740
side.

22:57.740 --> 22:59.380
It remembers window layouts for you.

22:59.380 --> 23:01.300
I'd be interested to see how that works with multi window.

23:01.300 --> 23:05.260
They didn't cover multi window or multi monitor at all with this.

23:05.260 --> 23:06.260
It gathers them together.

23:06.260 --> 23:09.980
Like, so if you have an app that has four or five windows, it'll bundle them all up

23:09.980 --> 23:10.980
for you.

23:10.980 --> 23:12.660
This is not the direction I expected for the Mac.

23:12.660 --> 23:16.800
Um, you know, I think, I think with stage manager, you see Mac and iPad kind of coming

23:16.800 --> 23:19.700
together and I, we have another section about iPad OS.

23:19.700 --> 23:20.700
But that is it, right?

23:20.700 --> 23:24.500
That's, that's the punchline is now stage managers on iPad OS.

23:24.500 --> 23:26.860
Now that feels like a revolution.

23:26.860 --> 23:30.700
This feels like another mission control on the Mac, but on the iPad it feels like a fundamental

23:30.700 --> 23:31.700
feature that's been missing.

23:31.700 --> 23:32.700
Yeah.

23:32.700 --> 23:37.220
I mean, I, I guess, you know, I keep wanting them to just like unleash the iPad and they

23:37.220 --> 23:38.220
did talk.

23:38.220 --> 23:41.300
And this is again where I'm gonna have to look at the dev sessions about new pro app

23:41.300 --> 23:42.300
API.

23:42.300 --> 23:47.180
So I don't know what makes an API a pro API or like a regular API.

23:47.180 --> 23:50.780
Um, so I'm gonna have to look at that.

23:50.780 --> 23:53.820
Things I didn't buy their whole little bragging about gaming.

23:53.820 --> 23:56.500
It's just, no, right.

23:56.500 --> 23:58.300
It's not going to happen on Mac.

23:58.300 --> 24:02.780
Well, wait, before you go onto that, going back to the iPad, they said that apps will

24:02.780 --> 24:10.380
get 16 gigabytes of virtual memory that they added a virtual memory manager to iPad OS.

24:10.380 --> 24:12.340
That seems kind of like a big deal.

24:12.340 --> 24:13.340
Yeah.

24:13.340 --> 24:14.340
Good for Photoshop.

24:14.340 --> 24:15.900
It's going to be great for Photoshop.

24:15.900 --> 24:20.680
Also they introduced real grownup display support.

24:20.680 --> 24:24.780
Like you plug in an external display, you get the full resolution and you can drag windows

24:24.780 --> 24:26.580
between the screens.

24:26.580 --> 24:30.580
You know, I, I've been burned by this so many times where I get like get off a WWC or one

24:30.580 --> 24:31.580
of their events.

24:31.580 --> 24:34.580
I'm like, yes, finally I can do those pro tablet app Star Trek style that I want to

24:34.580 --> 24:35.580
do.

24:35.580 --> 24:38.900
And it's like, well actually these are just basically iPhone apps blown up.

24:38.900 --> 24:43.960
Isn't the issue, honestly, that they could do anything to make iPad OS multitasking more

24:43.960 --> 24:47.660
powerful and at the end of the day, if you don't know if your app's going to make it

24:47.660 --> 24:50.100
through the app store, what's the point?

24:50.100 --> 24:51.180
What's the fundamental issue?

24:51.180 --> 24:52.500
They don't even touch on that.

24:52.500 --> 24:55.660
Well, there's, there's, it's really a two step, right?

24:55.660 --> 25:01.180
One, does the API exist to do what you want to do?

25:01.180 --> 25:08.020
Two, is it somehow skirting or coming close to a perceived edge for maple and you don't

25:08.020 --> 25:09.340
really know what those edges are.

25:09.340 --> 25:13.540
Now I'm still willing to bet now that they've had to do the Epic lawsuit and you know, there's

25:13.540 --> 25:18.580
going to be more of this app store or scrutiny that they're going to be a little less jerk

25:18.580 --> 25:22.700
like about this stuff, but obviously like anything that tries to skirt in app purchase

25:22.700 --> 25:28.460
is always going to, going to be looked down upon, shall we say.

25:28.460 --> 25:31.860
I do wonder about things like why can't we have like a really, really good text editor

25:31.860 --> 25:35.180
that actually can like compile code or like do a debugger on the iPad.

25:35.180 --> 25:37.140
And the answer is because they just don't believe in that.

25:37.140 --> 25:42.940
They want the code that always runs no matter what environment to be downloaded and vetted

25:42.940 --> 25:49.680
via the app store, which is a security thing, but it also severely limits some of the cool

25:49.680 --> 25:55.260
things you might be able to do with an iPad app, right?

25:55.260 --> 26:00.460
I will double check on this.

26:00.460 --> 26:08.100
I hope to be wrong, but I have a feeling these are more impressive demos than, you know,

26:08.100 --> 26:11.500
than actual leaps forward and making the iPad.

26:11.500 --> 26:14.780
You know, when I say a pro app, like I don't know what pro API means.

26:14.780 --> 26:20.340
Like I said, when I say a prop, I mean something like charging significant money for, right?

26:20.340 --> 26:25.900
Significant in the iOS world, I guess is like 14 cents, but you know, like 50 bucks, right?

26:25.900 --> 26:28.820
A yearly subscription, 50 bucks, a hundred bucks.

26:28.820 --> 26:30.900
I don't know that you can provide that full feature stuff.

26:30.900 --> 26:34.340
Now there are some areas you can write apps for DJs, app for podcasters.

26:34.340 --> 26:37.980
Those are people who, although again, you have Spotify and they're Sherlocking the crap

26:37.980 --> 26:38.980
out of you.

26:38.980 --> 26:39.980
So it's true.

26:39.980 --> 26:40.980
Yeah.

26:40.980 --> 26:42.980
You'll see, I've been burned before.

26:42.980 --> 26:44.460
So maybe I hope I'm wrong.

26:44.460 --> 26:48.380
I also wonder how much of this is limited to the M1 iPads.

26:48.380 --> 26:50.580
Some of this new multitasking, multi-monitor.

26:50.580 --> 26:52.220
A lot of it is.

26:52.220 --> 26:53.300
Yeah.

26:53.300 --> 26:56.980
They finally introduced weather kit for iOS.

26:56.980 --> 26:58.660
They bought dark sky.

26:58.660 --> 27:01.140
I can't even remember how long ago.

27:01.140 --> 27:03.980
And they just finally introduced a weather kit API.

27:03.980 --> 27:07.300
I don't know what that means for developers like carrot weather that, you know, they're

27:07.300 --> 27:08.380
an independent weather app.

27:08.380 --> 27:09.380
I don't know.

27:09.380 --> 27:11.260
I don't know who's going to be able to bang out a weather app.

27:11.260 --> 27:12.260
We'll see how that goes.

27:12.260 --> 27:16.900
They also on the iPads, they announced display scaling.

27:16.900 --> 27:20.300
So you don't necessarily have to run in pixel doubled mode.

27:20.300 --> 27:24.940
You could scale it back and get more screen resolution on your iPad.

27:24.940 --> 27:31.400
You combine that with what are they called stage manager and the multi-monitor stuff.

27:31.400 --> 27:35.380
And then maybe you have that $300 magic keyboard with that thing and maybe a hundred dollar

27:35.380 --> 27:37.340
pencil with that thing.

27:37.340 --> 27:41.180
What you have is something that's damn close to a laptop, but it's iOS.

27:41.180 --> 27:45.740
And for some people, I think that actually is a, I don't know.

27:45.740 --> 27:48.580
I still use my 2018 iPad pro and I still like it a lot.

27:48.580 --> 27:52.220
I still find it to be a really good device just for really focused communication.

27:52.220 --> 27:57.580
It's such a big investment that I would only be willing to do it very rarely, you know,

27:57.580 --> 27:59.820
but they're getting there slowly.

27:59.820 --> 28:02.360
Maybe they move so slowly because people upgrade so slowly.

28:02.360 --> 28:06.380
People like you and I, you know, we don't get new iPads that often.

28:06.380 --> 28:09.740
So maybe they just figure they can go at it nice and slow.

28:09.740 --> 28:11.020
Could be something like that.

28:11.020 --> 28:15.380
They also jumping around a bit, talked a little bit more about continuity.

28:15.380 --> 28:17.660
You're going to get FaceTime handoff.

28:17.660 --> 28:19.300
That's actually a pretty good feature.

28:19.300 --> 28:24.700
I think Apple automatically just now has like, if a contact supports FaceTime or something,

28:24.700 --> 28:28.540
when my, anyone in my immediate family calls me now, they're always calling me as a FaceTime

28:28.540 --> 28:30.020
audio call.

28:30.020 --> 28:32.720
So getting FaceTime handoff is nice.

28:32.720 --> 28:38.700
And then in the finally category, iPhone is a webcam available later this year, paired

28:38.700 --> 28:44.180
with a MagSafe clip that mounted on the top of your monitor or your laptop.

28:44.180 --> 28:45.540
You attach the MagSafe clip.

28:45.540 --> 28:48.260
You don't even have to wake the screen of the iPhone.

28:48.260 --> 28:53.180
It immediately wirelessly connects to the Mac as a full res camera.

28:53.180 --> 28:58.440
And then they spent God knows how much time developing this crazy ass niche feature that

28:58.440 --> 29:04.100
uses the wide angle lens of the iPhone to actually capture your desk, your keyboard

29:04.100 --> 29:05.100
and your mouse.

29:05.100 --> 29:09.220
So you can show people your workspace if you want without having to change cameras.

29:09.220 --> 29:13.260
That might be cool for like a VR situation, virtual workspaces.

29:13.260 --> 29:14.260
Maybe, maybe.

29:14.260 --> 29:15.260
Maybe.

29:15.260 --> 29:16.260
I mean, I doubt it.

29:16.260 --> 29:17.260
But yeah.

29:17.260 --> 29:18.260
This is a nice little thing though.

29:18.260 --> 29:21.260
You know, cause you've got good optics on that iPhone and it's got a good image signal

29:21.260 --> 29:25.100
processor and it supports center stage using that wide angle.

29:25.100 --> 29:26.100
So I don't know.

29:26.100 --> 29:29.740
I look at that kind of stuff and I put that all in the nice to have category.

29:29.740 --> 29:33.740
But it seemed like some years are like this more than others, but it seemed like this

29:33.740 --> 29:39.600
was a year where everything was about the Apple ecosystem with the exception of matter.

29:39.600 --> 29:45.740
Everything requires that you are all in as a developer, you're all in as an end user.

29:45.740 --> 29:49.100
It is nothing really new to bring you into the ecosystem.

29:49.100 --> 29:52.380
There wasn't like a new category or something like that.

29:52.380 --> 29:56.900
It was very, very much a deepening that trench.

29:56.900 --> 30:01.080
You know, and I, what I got out of this, when you look at all of the share stuff, the family

30:01.080 --> 30:08.060
integration stuff, the handoff stuff, what I got is Apple is creating an ecosystem out

30:08.060 --> 30:12.940
of your friends and family with the iMessage improvements, with the auto share API, they

30:12.940 --> 30:13.940
are creating.

30:13.940 --> 30:18.620
So now they're extending their ecosystem beyond their like before the ecosystem was watch

30:18.620 --> 30:21.900
phone, Apple TV, Mac, HomePod, right?

30:21.900 --> 30:26.700
Now it's all of those things, but now it's all your family and friends are interconnected

30:26.700 --> 30:29.180
with all those things too.

30:29.180 --> 30:34.140
And now they all are creating a collective dependence on Apple services and Apple messaging

30:34.140 --> 30:35.140
and et cetera.

30:35.140 --> 30:40.260
And making it a pain in the butt to leave the ecosystem, which is we know is their goal

30:40.260 --> 30:45.380
because one of the emails revealed in the Epic trial was on the hardware side, one of

30:45.380 --> 30:51.080
their big concerns is we need a cheap iPhone and we need messages to make sure that parents

30:51.080 --> 30:54.740
don't just give their teeny bopper, you know, a cheap Android device.

30:54.740 --> 31:00.980
This is the WWDC where I think that master strategy becomes kind of obvious on its face.

31:00.980 --> 31:03.380
And now looking back at it, it's clear this is where they were going.

31:03.380 --> 31:06.580
This is why they've always made such great, great family sharing options.

31:06.580 --> 31:08.300
That was always their incentive.

31:08.300 --> 31:14.000
But with this WWDC, it really felt like, Hey, look at the stuff we have and look how it

31:14.000 --> 31:18.080
gets even better when you use these new collaboration features.

31:18.080 --> 31:22.120
Like they talked about sending a link over messages to somebody and instantly kicks off

31:22.120 --> 31:27.220
a collaboration session in an app, FaceTime sharing, where you can be on FaceTime and

31:27.220 --> 31:30.100
you can start a collaboration session and start working on something.

31:30.100 --> 31:33.620
Everybody's name who's working on the doc, good features, good stuff.

31:33.620 --> 31:38.860
But all of it is to reinforce the ecosystem effect when you're working with multiple people.

31:38.860 --> 31:42.940
I thought that was fascinating.

31:42.940 --> 31:48.780
TailScale.com slash coder, this is a secret weapon of mine, it's not so secret, but I

31:48.780 --> 31:49.780
love tail scale.

31:49.780 --> 31:51.500
I think, Mike, you use tail scale.

31:51.500 --> 31:54.380
I think everybody on the network is using tail scale now.

31:54.380 --> 31:55.380
It's so great.

31:55.380 --> 31:56.520
It's so handy.

31:56.520 --> 31:59.640
You create a super quick VPN.

31:59.640 --> 32:03.700
It is a peer to peer connection from your machine to your other machines, all on a mesh

32:03.700 --> 32:04.700
network.

32:04.700 --> 32:07.220
They have a backplane that handles all of the negotiations and connections.

32:07.220 --> 32:09.320
It works with your single sign on vendor.

32:09.320 --> 32:13.020
So that means if you have like an organization that use a single sign on with two factor,

32:13.020 --> 32:15.020
you can integrate it with that.

32:15.020 --> 32:16.020
It supports magic DNS.

32:16.020 --> 32:21.700
So if you put something like a pie hole in your mesh network, then you can start resolving

32:21.700 --> 32:23.980
all of your machines by name.

32:23.980 --> 32:28.280
All of it's protected by WireGuard's noise protocol, which I think is the absolute best

32:28.280 --> 32:30.440
VPN encryption out there.

32:30.440 --> 32:32.460
And I think they're a really clever company.

32:32.460 --> 32:36.080
I think if you go read their blog, you'll get some real insights into the long term

32:36.080 --> 32:38.920
thinking that tail scale has about all of this.

32:38.920 --> 32:43.820
So if you go to tail scale dot com slash coder, you can sign up for free for 20 devices.

32:43.820 --> 32:45.300
And it is so quick to get started.

32:45.300 --> 32:47.420
You can get it running on just about any device.

32:47.420 --> 32:52.900
I bet you you could probably do it in one minute per device on my next OS systems in

32:52.900 --> 32:54.020
probably 30 seconds.

32:54.020 --> 32:55.700
I can get tail scale up and running.

32:55.700 --> 32:57.780
Raspberry Pi's same thing on my phone.

32:57.780 --> 32:58.780
It's in the app store.

32:58.780 --> 32:59.780
You get it installed.

32:59.780 --> 33:00.780
You get connected.

33:00.780 --> 33:01.780
You have the authentication process.

33:01.780 --> 33:02.780
It's so smooth.

33:02.780 --> 33:03.780
It's so smooth.

33:03.780 --> 33:05.200
I want to put this on blast.

33:05.200 --> 33:06.460
You got to go try it.

33:06.460 --> 33:08.620
It's going to change the way you do networking.

33:08.620 --> 33:11.020
It's going to change the way you do VPN.

33:11.020 --> 33:12.020
That's so obvious.

33:12.020 --> 33:14.680
But I think I'm just making that connection for the first time.

33:14.680 --> 33:15.680
That's the power of tail scale.

33:15.680 --> 33:16.680
Go try it out.

33:16.680 --> 33:21.920
Tail scale dot com slash coder.

33:21.920 --> 33:25.820
So you got yourself one of the new HP dev ones.

33:25.820 --> 33:28.140
I have a review unit in route.

33:28.140 --> 33:29.780
You actually bought one.

33:29.780 --> 33:35.400
I bought one and I do apparently have a review unit in route, but you got one anyways.

33:35.400 --> 33:36.600
And you got it quicker that way.

33:36.600 --> 33:37.600
So perhaps that's good.

33:37.600 --> 33:38.600
What do you think?

33:38.600 --> 33:43.740
Do you want to do a first impressions on HP's laptop built for developers that ships with

33:43.740 --> 33:44.740
Pop OS?

33:44.740 --> 33:45.740
Yeah.

33:45.740 --> 33:46.740
So just a quick first impression.

33:46.740 --> 33:48.980
It's only been a few days.

33:48.980 --> 33:51.060
So overall, I like it.

33:51.060 --> 33:58.260
It's I would say it's on par with most Linux laptops you can buy now.

33:58.260 --> 33:59.900
There's some interesting choices in it.

33:59.900 --> 34:05.860
For instance, the glossy screen is super bright, but still glossy.

34:05.860 --> 34:09.080
So I found myself turning up the brightness to fight glare.

34:09.080 --> 34:12.100
Out of the box, the setup experience is great.

34:12.100 --> 34:13.100
It's Pop OS, right?

34:13.100 --> 34:16.060
Which is like Ubuntu under the covers, basically.

34:16.060 --> 34:21.540
So if you know how to do your apt glory, you can set up a dual chain pretty quickly.

34:21.540 --> 34:22.540
The remote encryption.

34:22.540 --> 34:25.140
See, it's difficult not to just be reviewing Pop OS, right?

34:25.140 --> 34:26.140
Yeah.

34:26.140 --> 34:27.140
Yeah.

34:27.140 --> 34:28.140
So, you know, I'm just going to focus on the hardware.

34:28.140 --> 34:31.680
We've talked about Pop a lot and I think it's the hardware.

34:31.680 --> 34:33.900
That's kind of the difference here.

34:33.900 --> 34:34.900
Build quality is pretty good.

34:34.900 --> 34:37.220
It is plastic, which I was slightly disappointed.

34:37.220 --> 34:41.780
I thought it would be metal, but it's a pretty nice, firm plastic, but it doesn't feel flimsy

34:41.780 --> 34:42.780
at all.

34:42.780 --> 34:45.640
It has actual ports, which is which is nice.

34:45.640 --> 34:47.300
No USB-C charging, though.

34:47.300 --> 34:48.300
Barrel.

34:48.300 --> 34:49.780
It's got a barrel charger.

34:49.780 --> 34:50.780
Yeah.

34:50.780 --> 34:52.980
The webcam is OK.

34:52.980 --> 34:55.100
You know, it's what you get on most laptops.

34:55.100 --> 35:00.140
It's got a nice shield on it where you can close the webcam via hardware.

35:00.140 --> 35:04.140
Speakers I would say of the Linux laptops I've used, these speakers are better.

35:04.140 --> 35:05.940
Ah, OK.

35:05.940 --> 35:06.940
Performance is great.

35:06.940 --> 35:13.540
The AMD Ryzen 7 is is doing, you know, doing just fine.

35:13.540 --> 35:16.320
It does come when you buy it with 16 gigs of RAM.

35:16.320 --> 35:17.740
You can configure it after the fact.

35:17.740 --> 35:20.580
I haven't popped it open yet to upgrade RAM.

35:20.580 --> 35:23.940
That's definitely something I think I'm going to do because I work when I'm on the Linux

35:23.940 --> 35:24.940
machines.

35:24.940 --> 35:26.500
I usually have a Windows VM open, too.

35:26.500 --> 35:28.420
But you have to do that after the fact, right?

35:28.420 --> 35:32.300
Because unless I'm missing something here on their order page, I went to go order it

35:32.300 --> 35:34.780
and there's no there's no tweaking of the build.

35:34.780 --> 35:35.880
I found the same thing.

35:35.880 --> 35:37.780
There's no tweaking of the build.

35:37.780 --> 35:38.780
It's you order it.

35:38.780 --> 35:39.780
They ship it.

35:39.780 --> 35:40.780
Huzzah.

35:40.780 --> 35:42.060
Then you upgrade it after the fact if you want or can.

35:42.060 --> 35:43.060
I don't know.

35:43.060 --> 35:44.060
OK.

35:44.060 --> 35:45.600
And they do say you can.

35:45.600 --> 35:46.820
They explicitly say that.

35:46.820 --> 35:48.980
So that's going to be something I'm going to be trying out.

35:48.980 --> 35:51.140
I did not buy the I have a launch keyboard.

35:51.140 --> 35:57.100
I don't you know, I didn't buy the HP creator mouse, but I think we're getting one anyway.

35:57.100 --> 36:00.740
So I like that they're offering to include a system 76 launch.

36:00.740 --> 36:01.740
That's pretty neat.

36:01.740 --> 36:05.820
I mean, it's a really interesting deal from a Linux ecosystem perspective, right?

36:05.820 --> 36:06.820
Yeah.

36:06.820 --> 36:13.060
I definitely hope that there are future versions of this product because I could see, you know,

36:13.060 --> 36:18.220
some some kind of obvious upgrades, like one USB charging.

36:18.220 --> 36:19.220
Right.

36:19.220 --> 36:20.220
What year is it?

36:20.220 --> 36:21.220
Yeah.

36:21.220 --> 36:23.220
I wonder if maybe somebody could send it in over a booster email.

36:23.220 --> 36:25.160
Is this something about the rising platform?

36:25.160 --> 36:26.160
Is that it?

36:26.160 --> 36:27.160
Is that the limitation?

36:27.160 --> 36:29.760
Because my son has a rising laptop and it also has a barrel charger.

36:29.760 --> 36:30.760
Maybe that's it.

36:30.760 --> 36:31.760
Yeah.

36:31.760 --> 36:32.760
Performance rise.

36:32.760 --> 36:34.300
It runs fine out of the box.

36:34.300 --> 36:38.380
Of course, I hit a steam issue because that's what you do when you comment on Linux laptops.

36:38.380 --> 36:43.300
And when I had a weird issue where the terminal kept suspending, but then I just blew out

36:43.300 --> 36:46.900
a couple of dependencies and reinstalled them and it was fine.

36:46.900 --> 36:47.900
Hasn't done it in a day.

36:47.900 --> 36:49.300
So I'm not sure.

36:49.300 --> 36:51.420
No biometrics that I saw.

36:51.420 --> 36:56.220
I'm curious about fan noise, you know, with the rising system, how's temperature and performance

36:56.220 --> 36:57.640
and and that stuff.

36:57.640 --> 36:59.500
So I haven't got it to be loud yet.

36:59.500 --> 37:00.500
Okay.

37:00.500 --> 37:03.740
So hopefully my plan for tonight is to install XCOM and see how we do.

37:03.740 --> 37:08.300
You know, that is where I'd be really curious to hear your opinion, because like I mentioned,

37:08.300 --> 37:13.260
my kid has a rising laptop and for the most part, I just don't even have him turn on his

37:13.260 --> 37:14.900
NVIDIA GPU.

37:14.900 --> 37:20.200
I have him just use the built in rising graphics and it looks pretty damn good.

37:20.200 --> 37:25.940
So the idea that you could have pretty acceptable gaming performance on a laptop with the integrated

37:25.940 --> 37:31.220
GPU is a serious seller for me, because if I'm going to blow, you know, eleven hundred

37:31.220 --> 37:35.340
bucks on a laptop or something, a thousand bucks on a laptop, and it's going to be a

37:35.340 --> 37:40.140
Linux laptop, I really want to play some games because there's so many great games for Linux

37:40.140 --> 37:41.140
now.

37:41.140 --> 37:44.940
Yeah, well, that's and that's one of the big things Linux has for Mac OS, right?

37:44.940 --> 37:47.700
It's just leaps and bounds above it in gaming.

37:47.700 --> 37:49.500
Real time follow up from the chat room.

37:49.500 --> 37:54.860
They have a Dell with a Ryzen that has a USB charger, so it's probably not something specific

37:54.860 --> 37:55.860
to the Ryzen platform.

37:55.860 --> 38:01.100
OK, and I'm sure if we looked deeply that there must be some very similar Windows HP,

38:01.100 --> 38:02.100
right?

38:02.100 --> 38:05.420
Like SKU could be a next generation thing, too, like if they started working on this

38:05.420 --> 38:09.500
a year ago or something to, you know, QA and everything like that.

38:09.500 --> 38:14.780
The only thing I haven't just real quick tested yet is I want to see how much pressure it

38:14.780 --> 38:16.740
can take without getting super loud.

38:16.740 --> 38:20.900
Yeah, it's so far it hasn't gotten loud at all, but I'm always skeptical of that.

38:20.900 --> 38:25.740
I'm curious about your your first impressions of the keyboard and trackpad quality.

38:25.740 --> 38:28.540
You know, the trackpad, it's a little old fashioned.

38:28.540 --> 38:30.780
First of all, it has a nubbin.

38:30.780 --> 38:36.940
The little the little, you know, the old thing pads have like nub in the middle of the keyboard.

38:36.940 --> 38:37.940
The track point.

38:37.940 --> 38:38.940
Thank you.

38:38.940 --> 38:39.940
The track point.

38:39.940 --> 38:44.900
I could not use one in the early aughts and I still can't use them now, so I'm not the

38:44.900 --> 38:46.900
best person to ask about that.

38:46.900 --> 38:47.900
Trackpad's fine.

38:47.900 --> 38:49.500
It's got two dedicated mouse clickers.

38:49.500 --> 38:53.220
You can change that in the settings to do some more gesture stuff.

38:53.220 --> 38:56.620
They do have some interesting gesture stuff enabled.

38:56.620 --> 38:58.020
It's for a Windows trackpad.

38:58.020 --> 38:59.020
It's not bad.

38:59.020 --> 39:00.020
It's good.

39:00.020 --> 39:01.120
You know, non Mac trackpad.

39:01.120 --> 39:02.120
It's pretty good.

39:02.120 --> 39:06.020
I would say it's probably on par with I mean, I have an older XPS.

39:06.020 --> 39:07.820
It's pretty much on par with that, right?

39:07.820 --> 39:09.440
That's I'd say an acceptable performance.

39:09.440 --> 39:11.880
It's not stand out, but it's acceptable.

39:11.880 --> 39:12.980
The keyboard is nice.

39:12.980 --> 39:14.260
I actually like it.

39:14.260 --> 39:20.260
You know, they cut like a circle, like a half circle, and the keys were the track point.

39:20.260 --> 39:21.260
That's what we said.

39:21.260 --> 39:26.820
Where the track point is, which I thought I would find very annoying, but it was fine.

39:26.820 --> 39:27.820
The battery life.

39:27.820 --> 39:32.280
Well, I don't think Pop OS tells you the truth about your battery life because it jumps wildly

39:32.280 --> 39:33.280
all the time.

39:33.280 --> 39:34.920
This is my usage.

39:34.920 --> 39:36.820
It's actually been better than I thought it would be.

39:36.820 --> 39:37.820
Oh, okay.

39:37.820 --> 39:41.180
I'm going to take it on the road and see, you know, a more true test, right?

39:41.180 --> 39:45.060
Getting out of the house, not being plugged in or, you know, what?

39:45.060 --> 39:47.540
What is it really?

39:47.540 --> 39:49.900
What's it like in a realistic usage, right?

39:49.900 --> 39:53.340
Like streaming Spotify and working in VS code with Slack open?

39:53.340 --> 39:54.900
I'd love to hear the results of that test.

39:54.900 --> 39:57.820
Yeah, because this is a machine you need to take with you sometimes.

39:57.820 --> 40:03.180
So, okay, at this stage, where you're at, would you buy something like this for a new

40:03.180 --> 40:04.180
hire?

40:04.180 --> 40:05.180
You got it.

40:05.180 --> 40:06.180
Somebody coming on.

40:06.180 --> 40:09.220
I mean, one of the things you got to give these guys is they got this thing to you fast.

40:09.220 --> 40:10.980
Would you buy something like this for a new hire?

40:10.980 --> 40:14.820
If it holds up and I'm doing kind of a month-long test of it, this could be the easy, like,

40:14.820 --> 40:17.060
you know, mad bot or standard issue.

40:17.060 --> 40:19.020
You're a new random Python or Ruby guy.

40:19.020 --> 40:20.020
Here you go.

40:20.020 --> 40:24.820
I mean, we're mostly buying Linux machines now anyway.

40:24.820 --> 40:30.860
So another nice thing about this machine is right now we have like a bunch of different

40:30.860 --> 40:32.860
S76 and a few Dells running around.

40:32.860 --> 40:36.380
It would be nice to standardize for kind of like lots of reasons, right?

40:36.380 --> 40:40.700
I could maybe get a better deal on buying RAM chips if I could order just like...

40:40.700 --> 40:43.940
It would be great if I could buy it with more than 16 gigs of RAM and not have to deal with

40:43.940 --> 40:44.940
that problem.

40:44.940 --> 40:45.940
Yeah.

40:45.940 --> 40:51.540
But as it stands, you know, the processes I buy the machines, I try to install the dependencies

40:51.540 --> 40:53.700
that I think the person is going to need for the role on them.

40:53.700 --> 40:55.820
I give them the password, blah, blah, blah.

40:55.820 --> 41:01.460
And then I send it back out, which is, you know, very inefficient, but it saves usually

41:01.460 --> 41:04.220
like half a day of I can't get my tool chain up.

41:04.220 --> 41:08.060
And I guess if you were going to deploy Pop OS already, it's getting you just that much

41:08.060 --> 41:09.620
further down that process.

41:09.620 --> 41:10.620
Yeah.

41:10.620 --> 41:11.620
It tends a lot easier.

41:11.620 --> 41:12.620
Right.

41:12.620 --> 41:14.820
And then I know that, like, there's someone for me to yell at if somebody's Wi-Fi card

41:14.820 --> 41:16.940
dies.

41:16.940 --> 41:23.780
So it's got two USB ports to USB-C and HDMI out and of course, a headphone port and then

41:23.780 --> 41:25.220
the barrel connector.

41:25.220 --> 41:27.100
Not bad on the connectivity side.

41:27.100 --> 41:28.100
No, not it.

41:28.100 --> 41:35.300
It's it's I got to say, like for a web dev laptop, I think this is a very viable choice

41:35.300 --> 41:36.300
if you want Linux.

41:36.300 --> 41:43.060
I know that's a lot of caveats, but I feel like the Linux machines are somewhat have

41:43.060 --> 41:48.140
to be judged both against the Macs and the higher end Windows machines.

41:48.140 --> 41:52.340
And but also, if you're like if you're coming to the table saying, I will only buy a pre

41:52.340 --> 41:56.100
installed Linux machine, that's kind of a different category, right?

41:56.100 --> 41:57.100
Right.

41:57.100 --> 41:58.340
This is a tool to do a job.

41:58.340 --> 41:59.340
Yeah.

41:59.340 --> 42:00.340
I need a Linux development environment.

42:00.340 --> 42:01.340
Yeah.

42:01.340 --> 42:02.340
And the pricing is not bad.

42:02.340 --> 42:03.340
All right.

42:03.340 --> 42:04.580
So, you know, I've got a whole battery of tests I want to throw at it.

42:04.580 --> 42:09.020
But I, of course, want to really kind of dissect it, try different distributions on there,

42:09.020 --> 42:10.900
see how Wayland works on there.

42:10.900 --> 42:14.500
You know, I want to throw it through all of the various paces, but I'm content to wait

42:14.500 --> 42:17.940
because your first look here has has answered some of my questions.

42:17.940 --> 42:22.220
Now to be clear, it looks like a glossy display, but they have notes on here that make it look

42:22.220 --> 42:26.780
like they've tried to make it usable in a bright environment.

42:26.780 --> 42:28.700
Did you try using this thing outside?

42:28.700 --> 42:30.020
I did.

42:30.020 --> 42:35.420
So I was able to overcome the glare by turning the brightness all the way up.

42:35.420 --> 42:36.420
Whoa.

42:36.420 --> 42:37.820
That, of course, hammers your battery life.

42:37.820 --> 42:38.820
It gets bright, though.

42:38.820 --> 42:39.820
It gets bright.

42:39.820 --> 42:42.820
I think they said it was like a thousand nits or something crazy like that.

42:42.820 --> 42:49.540
You know, as a Linux user, what I love about this laptop is the idea that with a rise in

42:49.540 --> 42:56.020
GPU and a rise in CPU, I do nothing beyond just install my distro and I've got full

42:56.020 --> 42:57.500
3D acceleration.

42:57.500 --> 43:00.700
I've got full freaking open source graphics.

43:00.700 --> 43:02.900
To me, that's a very compelling starting place.

43:02.900 --> 43:09.860
And it's why I bought my ThinkPad and I went all Intel and the performance has been inadequate.

43:09.860 --> 43:11.700
I have never really been that happy with my ThinkPad.

43:11.700 --> 43:13.740
I still use it.

43:13.740 --> 43:21.500
And I feel like I've learned certain optimizations that I can do that have helped with its performance.

43:21.500 --> 43:26.500
But I feel like it suffers from having a really good GPU and I kind of just missed the latest

43:26.500 --> 43:31.100
gen of Intel CPUs that kind of made up some of this distance.

43:31.100 --> 43:32.860
And I got a generation before that.

43:32.860 --> 43:34.740
And so I've never been really that thrilled.

43:34.740 --> 43:44.220
And now with the Apple M2 generation launching, I know this sounds silly, but I'm kind of

43:44.220 --> 43:47.380
disincentive to buy an Intel based machine.

43:47.380 --> 43:53.200
And I feel like at least when I get a rise in, I'm getting something that feels modern,

43:53.200 --> 43:55.840
even though I understand it's maybe not equivalent like that.

43:55.840 --> 44:04.700
But in my mind, it feels like Intel represents old computing and AMD and Ryzen don't represent

44:04.700 --> 44:05.700
that to me.

44:05.700 --> 44:08.080
I know that's just a pure branding thing.

44:08.080 --> 44:11.780
But when you're trying to decide what you're going to buy, I feel like that stuff kind

44:11.780 --> 44:12.780
of plays a factor.

44:12.780 --> 44:16.840
And then you combine the fact that you get open source graphics stack, I think it kind

44:16.840 --> 44:17.840
of puts it ahead of the pack.

44:17.840 --> 44:19.420
So I am looking forward to getting my review unit.

44:19.420 --> 44:24.100
Yeah, I'm very curious as to your thoughts because I'm just never going to care to install

44:24.100 --> 44:25.820
different disk rows on it.

44:25.820 --> 44:29.320
So for me, it's kind of like just first impressions, right?

44:29.320 --> 44:32.780
Is this a viable machine for a Python dev or an Angular dev?

44:32.780 --> 44:34.940
And the answer is yes, right?

44:34.940 --> 44:35.940
Obviously, yes.

44:35.940 --> 44:39.940
There's I do feel that the target customer here, even though the marketing is very like

44:39.940 --> 44:45.540
devs, devs, devs, I think it's IT manager or guy who owns dev shop buying for their

44:45.540 --> 44:46.540
devs.

44:46.540 --> 44:47.540
Yeah.

44:47.540 --> 44:49.220
Linux enthusiast that wants a nice out of the box experience.

44:49.220 --> 44:50.220
Linux enthusiasts.

44:50.220 --> 44:51.220
Yep.

44:51.220 --> 44:52.220
Yep.

44:52.220 --> 44:53.220
System 76 is market.

44:53.220 --> 44:55.540
Yeah, which is why I find this to be kind of a surprising.

44:55.540 --> 44:58.820
Not yet, I think, delightful partnership.

44:58.820 --> 45:01.020
Oh, you won't remember my bacon.

45:01.020 --> 45:02.020
Yeah, I do.

45:02.020 --> 45:03.100
I do remember your bacon.

45:03.100 --> 45:06.480
Your tasty, tasty, you know, acquisition bacon.

45:06.480 --> 45:07.480
My M&A bacon.

45:07.480 --> 45:08.480
Yes.

45:08.480 --> 45:13.540
I feel like in six months to a year, I want to sit down with Carl, have a drink and just

45:13.540 --> 45:18.200
ask him like, what are your thoughts on this from like a, you know, 50,000 foot strategic

45:18.200 --> 45:20.260
level the next five years?

45:20.260 --> 45:21.860
Like what are your thoughts here?

45:21.860 --> 45:22.860
Is this a new area of business?

45:22.860 --> 45:25.860
Chris, at Stanford, you can do better than a drink.

45:25.860 --> 45:29.300
Well, there you go.

45:29.300 --> 45:30.580
Thanks for giving us that first impressions.

45:30.580 --> 45:32.940
What do you say we do a couple of boosts and then we get out of here?

45:32.940 --> 45:33.940
Sure.

45:33.940 --> 45:34.940
Boost it out.

45:34.940 --> 45:36.420
Four score and seven boosts to go.

45:36.420 --> 45:37.420
All right.

45:37.420 --> 45:42.100
Well, the golden dragon boosted in and he loves giving us the row of ducks.

45:42.100 --> 45:43.100
That's four twos.

45:43.100 --> 45:44.100
You put it in a calculator.

45:44.100 --> 45:45.100
Yeah, I know.

45:45.100 --> 45:46.580
So the golden dragon boosted in.

45:46.580 --> 45:47.580
I'm a duck.

45:47.580 --> 45:48.580
D-U-K duck.

45:48.580 --> 45:50.380
Loaded with talent.

45:50.380 --> 45:55.260
He says, not technically sure if this is cloud, but at my job, we log into a remote server

45:55.260 --> 45:59.500
that runs Microsoft Dynamics AX and it's terrible.

45:59.500 --> 46:02.800
I wish that we would go FOSS and get over with it.

46:02.800 --> 46:07.200
The version we use hasn't been supported for a decade, literally, and has connection issues

46:07.200 --> 46:10.580
all the time amongst other remote issues.

46:10.580 --> 46:13.360
We were talking about remote desktops and working environments.

46:13.360 --> 46:16.720
We did get some feedback on that that I think we'll read soon.

46:16.720 --> 46:25.300
I actually used to support a Microsoft remote desktop session for Dynamics AX and I can

46:25.300 --> 46:30.780
attest that it is an absolute horrible pig.

46:30.780 --> 46:34.860
And when you combine that with limitations of remote sessions and then running multiple

46:34.860 --> 46:41.740
copies on one box and the fact that it's not supported, that's remote sessions done the

46:41.740 --> 46:43.500
worst way possible.

46:43.500 --> 46:45.980
So I feel you golden dragon.

46:45.980 --> 46:50.020
Vine Hummingbird boosted in with a thousand sats four days ago.

46:50.020 --> 46:51.460
B-O-O-S-T.

46:51.460 --> 46:54.700
You folks beat on Windows all the time.

46:54.700 --> 47:02.740
Meanwhile, the entire financial world runs on it and it employs legions of devs.

47:02.740 --> 47:07.180
I think Hummingbird might work for Microsoft.

47:07.180 --> 47:08.860
He's right though, or they are right.

47:08.860 --> 47:14.060
One of us once said Windows 11, or I'm sorry, Windows 10 was the best Linux desktop distro.

47:14.060 --> 47:15.860
You did say that, didn't you?

47:15.860 --> 47:20.180
Then I did the WSL and the WSL 2 challenge and I had the Penguin guys when I did the

47:20.180 --> 47:25.540
interview show and I did a lot of Windows love, mostly sub Linux love, but come on.

47:25.540 --> 47:26.660
It's because it's been a while.

47:26.660 --> 47:27.660
You know what?

47:27.660 --> 47:32.260
We do on average go hard on Windows because we don't like it as a desktop experience,

47:32.260 --> 47:38.180
but there has been several times where we've got to come on the show and been like, no,

47:38.180 --> 47:39.180
Microsoft nailed this.

47:39.180 --> 47:40.900
They've done a good job with this.

47:40.900 --> 47:47.060
It's just far and few, mostly because I think you're bitter over the whole Metro stuff and

47:47.060 --> 47:48.060
Windows stuff.

47:48.060 --> 47:51.060
I shouldn't have said anything.

47:51.060 --> 47:53.340
All right, moving on.

47:53.340 --> 47:54.340
Never forget.

47:54.340 --> 47:55.340
Never forget.

47:55.340 --> 47:58.820
Nix are boosted in five days ago with a row of ducks.

47:58.820 --> 47:59.820
Thank you very much.

47:59.820 --> 48:01.820
And here's something for your trouble.

48:01.820 --> 48:06.980
He says just giving love for the best podcast for developers out there.

48:06.980 --> 48:07.980
What do you think of that?

48:07.980 --> 48:08.980
He must be drunk.

48:08.980 --> 48:09.980
Fuck on that ATP.

48:09.980 --> 48:14.140
Hey, I know you're right.

48:14.140 --> 48:15.140
You're right.

48:15.140 --> 48:16.620
I accept you as you are.

48:16.620 --> 48:21.300
Nixer actually came back in with a double boost boost that I caught the part about the

48:21.300 --> 48:24.260
cloud work and I wanted to send this in.

48:24.260 --> 48:26.580
I work for an MSP remotely.

48:26.580 --> 48:30.900
They actually have a box set up in the office in Texas that I use for support to do remote

48:30.900 --> 48:32.860
into that box from New York.

48:32.860 --> 48:37.500
Any tools that we have uses the web and I just have my local browser on my machine.

48:37.500 --> 48:40.620
Anything else is done on that box in Texas.

48:40.620 --> 48:42.100
They've mailed me a phone.

48:42.100 --> 48:45.700
So all my calls come from that office to our customers like I just work out of the office

48:45.700 --> 48:46.780
in Texas.

48:46.780 --> 48:50.700
I suppose either way, it works OK, though, until someone takes out your power cord in

48:50.700 --> 48:51.700
Texas backs.

48:51.700 --> 48:52.700
Yes.

48:52.700 --> 48:56.780
So because, you know, as a worker, that's just a that's just a free license to take

48:56.780 --> 48:57.780
the day off.

48:57.780 --> 48:58.780
No, no guilt.

48:58.780 --> 48:59.780
No shame.

48:59.780 --> 49:00.780
You know, as a boss, it sucks.

49:00.780 --> 49:01.780
As an owner.

49:01.780 --> 49:02.780
It's horrible.

49:02.780 --> 49:03.780
Yeah.

49:03.780 --> 49:04.780
If it works, I mean, whatever.

49:04.780 --> 49:06.340
I know you don't like it.

49:06.340 --> 49:07.420
I know you don't like it.

49:07.420 --> 49:09.780
You're always and you're always looking at it as a boss.

49:09.780 --> 49:14.100
We also got some thank you boosts, a double thank you boost from Cospe Land and from Elty

49:14.100 --> 49:15.100
Guy O5.

49:15.100 --> 49:16.100
Thank you, everybody.

49:16.100 --> 49:19.740
If you'd like to send us a boost, you can get a new podcast app over at new podcast

49:19.740 --> 49:24.740
apps dot com and you load up with some stats or if you don't want to switch apps.

49:24.740 --> 49:31.200
You can grab Breeze at B R E E Z dot technology for iOS or Android and then you can boost

49:31.200 --> 49:32.840
without switching apps.

49:32.840 --> 49:34.660
Also thank you to our members.

49:34.660 --> 49:36.020
You get something very special.

49:36.020 --> 49:37.780
That is a Coderly once a quarter.

49:37.780 --> 49:40.700
You also get the members feed that has no ads.

49:40.700 --> 49:47.540
I am also working on a live version, which I got to figure out not only some of the tech

49:47.540 --> 49:50.520
details but like what's going to be in that live feed version.

49:50.520 --> 49:52.740
But I am formulating that for the members.

49:52.740 --> 49:58.940
I know probably just a lot of cussing, you know, a lot of cussing, lots of cussing.

49:58.940 --> 50:02.100
Drew cuts it out of the show, but they start the show being like, hey, did you see this

50:02.100 --> 50:03.100
new Metro UI?

50:03.100 --> 50:04.100
Oh, my God.

50:04.100 --> 50:05.100
Mike was logged in.

50:05.100 --> 50:06.100
Yeah.

50:06.100 --> 50:07.100
Yeah.

50:07.100 --> 50:08.100
It's awful.

50:08.100 --> 50:10.740
It's also just a great way to support the show.

50:10.740 --> 50:11.740
Keep us independent.

50:11.740 --> 50:12.740
Working with the sponsors.

50:12.740 --> 50:13.740
We should be.

50:13.740 --> 50:14.740
You know, all that kind of stuff.

50:14.740 --> 50:15.820
Coder QA dot co.

50:15.820 --> 50:17.380
Thanks to our members over there.

50:17.380 --> 50:21.100
Mr. Dominic, is there anywhere you want to send folks this week here on the Coder program?

50:21.100 --> 50:22.100
Sure.

50:22.100 --> 50:23.100
You know what?

50:23.100 --> 50:28.620
Go to Alice dot dev and maybe the end of the week I'll have something on the one on Dominic

50:28.620 --> 50:29.620
M dot com.

50:29.620 --> 50:30.620
The dev one.

50:30.620 --> 50:31.620
I mean.

50:31.620 --> 50:32.620
Oh, further thoughts on the laptop, perhaps.

50:32.620 --> 50:33.620
Very, very nice.

50:33.620 --> 50:36.620
I wonder if my next episode I'll have my review unit.

50:36.620 --> 50:37.620
Wouldn't that be cool?

50:37.620 --> 50:39.260
I think you probably will.

50:39.260 --> 50:40.260
It seems like you should.

50:40.260 --> 50:41.580
I might tweet it out when I get it.

50:41.580 --> 50:42.640
At Chris Alias.

50:42.640 --> 50:46.060
The podcast is at Coder Radio Show and the network is at Jupiter Signal.

50:46.060 --> 50:48.120
There's a whole network of shows.

50:48.120 --> 50:50.120
You might like Linux action news.

50:50.120 --> 50:52.540
Perhaps you'd like to try self-hosted or Linux Upload.

50:52.540 --> 50:53.540
They're all over there.

50:53.540 --> 50:58.620
And of course, the new show Office Hours, where we talk about the back end projects

50:58.620 --> 51:01.180
for the network and more at Office Hours dot here.

51:01.180 --> 51:02.180
Yep.

51:02.180 --> 51:03.180
It's Office Hours dot here.

51:03.180 --> 51:06.500
Thanks to what we talked about today, Coder dot show slash 469 over there you'll find

51:06.500 --> 51:07.500
our contact form.

51:07.500 --> 51:08.500
That's a big part of the show.

51:08.500 --> 51:10.740
We'd love to hear from you and our subscribe page.

51:10.740 --> 51:14.860
Also, we always appreciate you sharing the show or showing up live Mondays at noon Pacific

51:14.860 --> 51:15.860
three p.m.

51:15.860 --> 51:16.860
Eastern at jblive.tv.

51:16.860 --> 51:19.940
Thanks so much for being here on this week's episode of Coder Radio.

51:19.940 --> 51:33.580
See you right back here next week.
