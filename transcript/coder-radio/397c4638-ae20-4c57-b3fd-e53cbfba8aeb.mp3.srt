00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
This is Kota Radio, episode 332, for November 2nd-ish, 2018.

2
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Hello, everyone, and welcome to Kota Radio, Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show, taking a pragmatic look at the art and the business of software development and its related technologies.

3
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
This episode is being recorded, at least for one more week, in the beautiful Pacific Northwest.

4
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:55,000
My name is Chris, and joining me every single week is the man who I hope is defending his home from the invasion of Jar Jar Binks.

5
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
It's our host, Mr. Dominic. Hello, Mike.

6
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:07,000
In a world where gungans take down your stream, there is one man, one man alone in the Pacific Northwest with great hair. I mean, have you seen his hair?

7
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Actually, I think it's Alan Jude. He's the stream fixer. Yeah, we have stream woes today, don't we?

8
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
What's the point of doing a live show if your stream doesn't work? I don't get it. It doesn't make any sense.

9
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Well, that's okay, though. The show goes on live or not. Even if it's just you and me talking to each other, even if I didn't hit record, it'd probably be fine.

10
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:29,000
We have Twitch, which I did not know until today. 332 episodes later, I found out we're on Twitch.

11
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:35,000
There you go, buddy. We've got to keep up with the kids. You know, those kids that are interested in the coding.

12
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
You know what? I went to twitch.tv. There's some weird stuff going on there, man.

13
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
It's a whole other world. It's a whole other internet. It really is.

14
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Mr. Dominic, we are assembling a little early. It'll go out probably around the regular time, but we're assembling a little early because you and I are traveling this week.

15
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:59,000
And as Fortune would have it, we've really had quite the series of stories develop in the last few days.

16
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Plus, we've gotten some feedback, we got some tools, and we got a great question coming in on Twitter that we're going to answer this week.

17
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I think, Mr. Dominic, we have ourselves a special Friday edition of the Coderadio program right here.

18
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
TGIF, baby. There you go. There you go.

19
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Business. Why don't we start with a little bit of hoopla? Let's do the hoopla first this week. We'll get to the feedback later. Let's get to the hoopla first.

20
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:31,000
The hoopla will play into our larger topic of the week, but let's start with Apple's big news this week.

21
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Lana Del Rey.

22
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Yes, there was, wasn't there?

23
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Yes, there was.

24
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:45,000
It really was, to sum it up, it was a Mac Mini and iPad Pro event. There was a MacBook Air also introduced.

25
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:50,000
The 100 million number was thrown out there for the Active Mac Active Mac user base.

26
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:57,000
All these other little tangential things, but you and I, before the event kicked off, were really kind of wondering what's going to happen with the Mac Mini.

27
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Because this is really the developer's entry machine. If you're going to get into the Mac ecosystem and you already have a monitor, why not get a Mac Mini?

28
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Well, until this week, it's been really kind of a joke, the machine. It's been so ignored. It's been so behind the technology curve. It's been so out of date.

29
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Like, I mean, I could just go on, you know, and now we've got a system here that is pretty respectable, I think. What do you think?

30
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Yeah, I mean, this is actually a decent sub iMac Pro workstation, provided you don't do anything where you need a GPU.

31
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Right. Or, you know, if you get the base model, it starts with an i3. So your pricing, your pricing is interesting. Comes in with two base models, $799 and then one that's $1000.

32
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:53,000
So this is the base entry Mac now, right? So if you want to just, you just want to be able to run Xcode, sign some apps and make an iOS app, your minimum, you're spending $800 before tax.

33
00:03:53,000 --> 00:04:00,000
And that's i3 processor, eight gigs of RAM and only 128 gigs of storage, which is basically not enough to use Xcode.

34
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:09,000
So you kind of have to spec that thing up. You have to bump that one up. The next the next sort of a nice tier is a six core Mac mini.

35
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:20,000
That's respectable with 256 gigs of storage and an i5. That's not great, but it's it's usable at that point. That's only eight gigs of RAM, though.

36
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Yikes, eight gigs of RAM. Yeah, I mean, I think to be serious, you're spending at least fifteen hundred, sixteen hundred dollars.

37
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Yeah, just just to get into the range of like reasonable.

38
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:44,000
So my Mac mini with a six core base processor and 32 gigs of RAM and 512 gigs of SSD storage would work out to be nineteen hundred dollars.

39
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Yeah, that's a lot for Apple's cheapest Mac. I mean, I mean, I know this is.

40
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I think I think maybe the conversation we ought to have is should we stop talking about price? It just we just accept that if you're buying Apple gear, it's expensive.

41
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,000
And even there's at 20 percent. I mean, that's basically what you do. You didn't think they were going to do this, though.

42
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:09,000
You didn't think they were going to update the Mac mini. You didn't think there'd be much in the way of Max at all, except for you thought they do an iMac.

43
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:14,000
You got it all wrong. Yeah, I was completely wrong, as is per my usual.

44
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:20,000
You know, everybody expected the iPad Pro because the whole thing leaked. Right. I mean, you could look at pictures of that on Mac rumors.

45
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:31,000
And there's some interesting. I want to say there's some interesting development stuff with the iPad Pro, but there's always that will Apple actually let you do it factor.

46
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:36,000
And I am actually going to try to find that out. Did you get one? Yes.

47
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:42,000
You and I both ordered one immediately, I believe. Yeah, I did. And where perchance did you order one from?

48
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Oh, you're going to help me like that on the show? Oh, I get even. All right.

49
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I suppose it's fair. I'm actually kind of proud of myself because I completely forgot about the Apple event wasn't on my radar at all.

50
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:59,000
And so I was driving into work like I do, do, do, do. I'm like, gosh, you know what, self?

51
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I think I'm going to stop by Starbucks, going to sit down, get myself some bacon, egg bites and a strawberry refresher.

52
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I actually don't like their coffee. Not to be that guy. I know.

53
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:16,000
What was the last thing, the strawberry refresher? Yeah, I got a strawberry refresher.

54
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Let's just keep moving. Just do it live. Just keep going.

55
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:29,000
And I'm sorry. I'm sorry, everybody. And so I get my strawberry refresher and I get my bacon, egg bites, which are killer and crack open the old ThinkPad.

56
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I already feel like a bit of a Luddite at a Starbucks with a ThinkPad, but I crack open the old ThinkPad and I start to get to work.

57
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:41,000
And I kid you not. The thing that took me off to the Apple event is I start seeing your tweets and I go, oh, that's right.

58
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I was going to buy an iPad Pro today because I've been with my my son's iPad broke about a year ago and about a year and change ago.

59
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:57,000
And at that point in time, I gave him my like I had like an iPad Air 2, you know, pretty old, but what do I care?

60
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,000
And so I was like, here, Dylan, you can have mine. I don't need an iPad. So it's been like a year, year and a half.

61
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I haven't had an iPad and I haven't missed it a single bit, really.

62
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:14,000
So I didn't actually expect to be getting one. But as I switched over completely to the ThinkPad.

63
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:22,000
And I've been you see I'm a VP now and I've been involved in a lot of like meetings and calendar invites and corporate KPIs.

64
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Yeah. KPIs and OKRs. Not having a fully sophisticated, like fully realized mail calendaring application platform on Linux is rough because they don't use exchange.

65
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,000
They use Google apps and you can kind of piece it together.

66
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Like I've got MailSpring and I've used Natafire to natify Google Calendar.

67
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,000
And it's like I've got things pieced together, but it's kind of a shit show.

68
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:53,000
It's not nearly as good as it would be if I was on Windows or the Mac. And that's just just the reality of it.

69
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:58,000
If I was just connecting to an IMAP server and hosting my own calendar, it would be 100 percent capable.

70
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:08,000
But when you're interacting with people and you want to check their availability and see what their calendar looks like and invite multiple people and pick a time and set it all up with a with a video conference and all of this.

71
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:15,000
And it's all done over email or Slack. It's just much easier to have some of these more well thought out applications.

72
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I don't know, about September, I started thinking to myself, this is where I could see an iPad kind of being useful.

73
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:26,000
And I started considering buying an iPad Pro back in September.

74
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Because I could do like some dedicated tasks on that machine and then use my laptop for my actual work.

75
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:38,000
And so then but then it was so close, I was like, well, I got to wait now, I can't get the new iPad Pro because they're going to I can't get the old iPad Pro.

76
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:43,000
It's like two years old or whatever at this point, a year into something. I got to just wait.

77
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,000
And so I was just sort of patiently waiting. I was just waiting. I was patiently waiting.

78
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:52,000
And when I saw your tweets about the Mac Mini, I realized that the event was that day.

79
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:57,000
And so I quickly brought up the stream at Starbucks and was like, oh, OK, they're still talking.

80
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Store is still down. So I set myself a little reminder for 15 minutes.

81
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Go buy an iPad Pro and then went back to work and then I just worked 15 minutes later.

82
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:12,000
My timer went off, the store was back open and I ordered the 256 with LTE, 11 inch with a pencil and a keyboard.

83
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Because I'm planning to essentially use this as a laptop on trains, planes and while traveling.

84
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:26,000
And then when I'm not traveling, have it next to my computer as with just like email and Slack up or something.

85
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,000
So we almost got the same rig. Then I got the 11 inch pencil keyboard here.

86
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:35,000
What storage did you get? Let me look at the receipt.

87
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I cried for a while. I know that was I mean, that was bad.

88
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:44,000
You know, ridiculous. This is better. This could do 256 what I got.

89
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Yeah, it's just how can you go? They go up to a terabyte now if you're willing to pay in blood.

90
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
And the thing is, it's like this is going to be a five year machine for now.

91
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
It's not. I can assure you that it's not for me.

92
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Well, yeah, I mean, for tablets have a much longer lifetime with me like tablets, tablets.

93
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I don't need a lot from them. You know, run my email and watch my videos.

94
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I did, though I can't we haven't even mentioned this yet. I did.

95
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I do believe the USBC is what pushed me over the edge because I already have USBC for my laptop.

96
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I already have USB three for our USBC for my pixel three that I switched to a couple of weeks ago that never said anything about.

97
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:28,000
And I've got USBC for several other devices in my home. So being able to put everything on USBC is great.

98
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,000
But I also bought it with a USBC video adapter.

99
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:39,000
So I'm hoping that I can go in hotel rooms and I can play MBR Plex or whatever on the iPad via the TV.

100
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:43,000
And I can use it as because these TVs suck in the hotel rooms.

101
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:49,000
They really do. And so I'm hoping I can use the iPad to like bring with bring with me some shows and stuff.

102
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Yeah. So, yeah, I did get the 256. You know, the USBC was a big factor for me because now all of a sudden it's much more capable.

103
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Right. You can engineer a little IoT devices and hardware to work with it. USBC is an open standard that you don't have to get permission for.

104
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:08,000
I have a I have a legitimate USBC sound interface.

105
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:15,000
It's like a USB audio device that I can plug XLR microphones into that works with other USBC mobile devices.

106
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:21,000
So I have pretty because it just shows up as a USB audio device. I'm pretty sure it's going to work with the iPad, too.

107
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I may actually be able to do shows from that iPad, bro.

108
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Yeah. So I have to be a little honest.

109
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:38,000
The iPad, this iPad Pro USBC is the first Apple device in a long time that has made me interested in native iOS development again, other than like people, you know, offering me money to do it.

110
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Right. I mean, are you how does the port translate to interest in developing for it?

111
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Because I don't need permission. That's a huge deal.

112
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Like the biggest feature, right, the biggest feature for me on this iPad, other than the fact that it makes my 13 inch MacBook Pro look very sad because its processor is in some cases much faster.

113
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:09,000
You know, you can just buy a USBC cable and build your little IoT device as long as it also implements USBC and do whatever the hell you need to do.

114
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:20,000
That opens up for either line of business or just specialty uses. You know, as you know, I've been doing a lot in avionics where I'm writing software that like never sees the light of day.

115
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Right. I wouldn't say I'm dark matter. It's more the void. That's really cool where you don't have to call Uncle Timothy, you know, Uncle May I.

116
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Unless you want to be on the app store, then you just cry, cry, cry.

117
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:40,000
What about the device drivers have to be present on the system? I mean, you are limited in what they that's it's going to happen, though.

118
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Right. Device drivers, you know, there are millions of people on Reddit right now working on device drivers.

119
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Hmm. I believe in that. Like, I'm not even that worried if you really have to.

120
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:55,000
You could certainly roll your own device drivers. Right. There are tons of developers who do that.

121
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Many of them are at BSD conferences, which I think you were just that if I literally listen to it this morning, I'm wearing my meat BSD shirt right now.

122
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Are you wearing your horns? No, but there's horns on the shirt. Awesome.

123
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:13,000
So, yeah, I'm pretty I'm pretty, pretty excited. I mean, I don't know if this is going to sway.

124
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:18,000
I'm at one of these crossroads, which I think we'll talk about in the main topic here, but certainly the iPad.

125
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:23,000
So you remember, Chris, I have a dream where I had. Oh, I do. A beautiful, beautiful R.T. dream, if I recall.

126
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:33,000
It was an R.T. dream of Star Trek style productivity tablets that basically control everything. I'd say house, but I really do mean Starship.

127
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:40,000
And that kind of went like the Battle of the Binaries. It didn't go well.

128
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:45,000
It was I just didn't expect the cloaking for the lack of market share.

129
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Right. Right. Or the fact that they would know exactly how to disable your entire power grid and drop your shields and weapons systems

130
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:56,000
and then destroy everything like literally everything.

131
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:07,000
So, yeah, I'm pretty excited. I mean, I still have this paranoia of like, OK, this is a USB interface, but this is also Apple.

132
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:14,000
So is there some weird stuff going on in the OS that prevents me from doing what I want to do?

133
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:20,000
So that's why I spent a thousand dollars to find out. I feel like I did this the wrong way in hindsight, but.

134
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,000
And comic books will look really good on this and so will Riley books.

135
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:29,000
So even if it doesn't work. I'm hoping like that's my fear.

136
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:33,000
I'm hoping they're not doing something crazy with their USB interface that just like locks it down.

137
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:39,000
No, but I think it'll it'll go the other direction. I think it will start limited and then they'll open it up.

138
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:43,000
You don't put USB on there just to not use it for anything.

139
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:47,000
This is I think I could be completely wrong and I hate I hate to be this guy.

140
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:53,000
But I think if you took a 10 year view at Apple's product lineup.

141
00:14:53,000 --> 00:15:00,000
So 10 years from now, you look back, you put the whole thing like on a chart and a timeline chart.

142
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:09,000
iPad Pro getting USB-C is the first strongest market indicator we have that ARM chips are coming to the Mac laptops.

143
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Oh, well, there's an even stronger one. You know what word we didn't hear during the entire like two hour presentation?

144
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:19,000
I do. In fact, I specifically noticed Intel was not mentioned at all.

145
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:23,000
In fact, they just called the CPUs in the MacBook Air eighth generation.

146
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:29,000
They didn't say Intel a generation. They went out of their way not to give Intel any props.

147
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:36,000
You add USB-C to the iPad Pro. You add USB-C only to the MacBook Air, which just got USB-C.

148
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,000
So here's the great thing. Here's the brilliant thing. Apple plays the long game.

149
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:52,000
I'll give you an example real quick. The Apple Watch with the Series 4 made the transition to 64 bit and nobody noticed because they realize a long time ago.

150
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Remember that byte code middle layer that every app has to use when you submit it and then and then the store builds that we've talked about it before.

151
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Right. And then we did on the show. Yep. And that's yep.

152
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:13,000
That because when they launched the Watch Series 0 five years ago, they knew in five years that they'd have in their product line a watch that was 64 bit.

153
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:20,000
And so at the time when they launched the app, the watch to the market, they said, you just got to use this byte code middle layer. You've got to do it. You got to do it.

154
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
And now they're requiring it for the iPhone.

155
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Right. Which basically what that means is they can recompile your code and theoretically they can compile it to ARM.

156
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Right. That's where this is all going. In fact, this is the long game they play. They play a long game like ATP.

157
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:42,000
John Sircus is very knowledgeable on the Intel roadmap. They have a lot of the he in particular good information on bottom line if you don't want to know the details.

158
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:53,000
And I have when we can talk about this in a minute, Chris, I have been on the AMD Intel comparison thing for about a day now until really screwed up a number of years ago, like about five or six years ago.

159
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:58,000
And basically they're just not the top of the game anymore.

160
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,000
I mean, they're good at some things like their Xeons are still best in breed.

161
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:07,000
But so you figure you figure Intel is in is it is stagnating.

162
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Apple's chips, something like the performance increase from the iPad pro last model to this model.

163
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Some of the CPU compute speed improvement is like 94 percent faster.

164
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:25,000
It's 94 percent faster than the previous model on Geekbench in certain benchmarks.

165
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:31,000
It's benchmarking faster than a core i9 MacBook Pro 2018 edition.

166
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:39,000
So processors and Apple's pulling ahead. Right. And so if they're playing the long game, you start you start limiting all of the MacBooks to USB-C only.

167
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Then when it comes time to switch those mother efforts to ARM, you're not all of a sudden losing all your ports.

168
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:50,000
You've already swallowed that bitter pill. You've swallowed all of the constraints of a physical ARM device when it was an Intel device.

169
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:55,000
So that by the time they switch it out to their a series processors, the physical design doesn't have to change.

170
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:59,000
The port layout doesn't change. You've already swallowed that pill.

171
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Well, and the advantages are pretty, pretty substantial.

172
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Like, let me just give an example. Listeners will know and I know, you know, from about a month ago, my 15 inch MacBook Pro died.

173
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:15,000
So I bought a 13 inch MacBook Pro. This is my travel machine. I'm on it right now.

174
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:21,000
This is low end two point three gigahertz Intel Core i5, eight gigs of RAM for Thunderbolt models.

175
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:31,000
The touch bar model, the iPad Pro I ordered is on almost every metric going to outperform this laptop.

176
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:35,000
And the battery, too. Oh, absolutely. Well, I mean, that's the big thing.

177
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:40,000
I think the next shoe to drop is our Mac OS apps to the Mac App Store.

178
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Once they tell you that those have to compile to byte code. That's it. That's the tell. That's the tell. That's it.

179
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Yeah. And you have in the meantime, you have that framework that won't be called Marzipan that is bringing iPad apps over to the Mac.

180
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Yeah. You bought you, you know, I'm just saying, yeah, I think it I don't think it's a bad time to get the iPad Pro.

181
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:05,000
I'm not here to try to sell anybody on iOS. If it doesn't work for you, that's fine.

182
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
That's not what that's not what this discussion is about.

183
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:11,000
This discussion is really about potential developer opportunities around this.

184
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:17,000
That's really the root of why we talk about this is what are the potential developer opportunities here?

185
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Or also is just as much as part of this conversation.

186
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:25,000
What kind of roadblocks is this going to create for you if you use this tool set?

187
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:31,000
You know, there is a real possibility that the Macs that we're seeing in the next couple of years are going to be some of the last X86 machines.

188
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:36,000
I'm sure they'll take a long fade out process, but I think I think that's super real.

189
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Like, you know, next year, we're supposedly getting a Xeon Mac Mac.

190
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:47,000
I'm sorry, Mac Pro, not MacBook Mac, proper Mac Pro. Right. Do you really want to buy that now?

191
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Like, seriously, like even I who who spends money like a drunk sailor would be like, I don't know about that.

192
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Yeah, especially if you're going to do iOS or Mac development.

193
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
It seems like I think I would want to be on arm.

194
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,000
I think I would want to be where the hockey puck is going, so to speak.

195
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Besides, I mean, how can I buy a Mac Pro when I'm spending all that money on a new system, 76 Thelio?

196
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,000
OK, so let's talk about AMD for a moment.

197
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Yeah, I mean, well, this is this is AMD's moment to shine with Intel's legging.

198
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:23,000
So are you familiar with the Threadripper series of CPUs from AMD?

199
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:27,000
I am familiar. You know, I read the reviews. I follow the trade news.

200
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:33,000
I watch the YouTube videos, but I haven't actually built a Threadripper system.

201
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:38,000
But they're impressive. So, yeah, I went through this playing with the configurator thing about the Thelios.

202
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:44,000
First of all, I have to say, wow, those cases are great. I mean, these are my goodness.

203
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:53,000
So if you haven't seen it yet, audience system 76 has custom built a metal and wood enclosing that is brilliant.

204
00:20:53,000 --> 00:21:00,000
The metal side is like that powdered metal with and Carl tells me it's got like specs of metal in it.

205
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:07,000
And it just looks really nice. And then they have two types of wood finish, a darker wood and a lighter wood.

206
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:11,000
And it looks sharp. The darker wood is very classy, very contemporary.

207
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:15,000
And the lighter wood has a beautiful contrast with the black metal.

208
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:22,000
And they tell me they've they've gone to a ton of effort to make sure there's not like weird gaps between where the wood and the metal meet.

209
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:27,000
You just got to go to system 76 to see it because it's it's probably one of the prettiest cases I've ever seen.

210
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Even the even the back end of even the ass of this case is beautiful. It's just they've done a great job.

211
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:37,000
And we know how you feel. I mean, Chris likes his back, right?

212
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:42,000
I like the mountains and they got mountains on there. I got I got the feels for this machine.

213
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Yeah, I think I think this is a good machine and I've read all the Reddit and someone in the chat is, you know, not thrilled.

214
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:59,000
But you know what? They have done a lot. Their daughter board is a pretty interesting approach, which if you don't know about it, go go ahead and check System 76's website because it's not hyper relevant to Dakota Radio.

215
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:12,000
And I and I think Linus Unplugged covered it better. But what really they have accidentally shown me, which I don't think was their goal, is that AMD has some impressive platforms right now.

216
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Yeah. Oh, OK. Yeah. Oh, interesting. Yeah. Yeah. So like I originally I originally went like, OK, Intel, you know, I was between the core seven and the core X.

217
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Yeah. Yeah. And then I was like, well, Jesus, an upgrade to do Intel. Like, what's the alternative?

218
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:34,000
And then I started going through on this rabbit hole and there are things that Intel is better at. There are things that AMD is better at.

219
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:43,000
But dollar for dollar, you tend to get more raw computing power. And to be clear, I'm talking about once you get up to the core X, the red ripper level, right?

220
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:49,000
AMD's system, which they have available in the studio, they have several skew, which they have available. You can buy an entire AMD system if you want.

221
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Yeah. And I know that AMD, I've been told, supports open source a little more enthusiastically than Nvidia.

222
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:03,000
So if you're going to do AMD, you might do AMD graphics as well. Right. Which for those who don't know, that's our whole rise in architecture platform.

223
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Look at you. You have been doing your reading. Oh, I'm so deep into the AMD now.

224
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Like I have to say, I've always thought of AMD as like the the RC Cola to Intel's Coke.

225
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:22,000
No, it's like the good old days where AMD is pulling ahead again. They're actually competitive. And not only that, but in things that I care about, they're probably.

226
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:27,000
I mean, I'm still not convinced, but I've sure looked at a lot of benchmarks.

227
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:37,000
And I think on a desktop workstation that I'm going to be compiling a lot of C or C like code, you know, in a kind of.

228
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Pseudo multi threaded way, but really not that multi threaded, it may be the case that dollar for value, because remember, the AMD systems are slightly less expensive and you can take that savings and get a real GPU.

229
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:58,000
The thread rippers are the way to go. Now, when I say value, you're still spending like twenty six, twenty eight hundred dollars.

230
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:04,000
So these are not these are not low cost rigs that I'm talking about.

231
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:09,000
But damn, if these aren't pretty. So I have to ask Chris, what do you think I ordered?

232
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Did I order a Mac Mini? Did I order a Thelio? So which one? Oh, you got one. You got one.

233
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:20,000
I said, if so, if so.

234
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Boy, that's a tough call. You know, you got to give me this back. All right. OK, so let's see here. Let's see. Let me think about this for a second.

235
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:36,000
The Mac Mini would would give you the ability to have portable Linux machines. You could remote into the Mac Mini, publish and sign iOS apps.

236
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:55,000
It would solve all my build issues, wouldn't it? Yeah. However, our conversation recently has centered around getting a powerful desktop that runs Linux really well and then something more portable that you could be a Mac, could be a Chromebook, could be a Linux box.

237
00:24:55,000 --> 00:25:08,000
It doesn't matter as much. Hmm. Oh, this is hard. This is hard. I'm going to say I'm going to say I'm going to say I'm going to go with cost.

238
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:14,000
I'm going to say I'm going to say Mac Mini. Wrong. Oh, but there's a twist.

239
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:25,000
M. Night Shyamalan style. I got nothing. Yes. Because here's what happened. I decided to get the Thelia. Really? But I decided they don't ship till December. Yes.

240
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:33,000
And then I went down this rabbit hole of AMD and I got confused. So I am waiting and I'm waiting for one reason now.

241
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:45,000
I want to see what USB-C hacking I can do with the iPad Pro. Hmm. If it's the case that there's a viable opportunity, I don't think I don't think my little MacBook Pro is going to be sufficient.

242
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Sure. But I wouldn't buy a Mac Mini anyway because it doesn't have a GPU and I kind of want to do some gaming. Thunderbolt three, man. It's all about Thunderbolt three these days.

243
00:25:53,000 --> 00:26:05,000
You get it. You know, I've heard so many stories about that, like not. I know. I will. I don't know. I've heard good stories, too, because here's the thing. Here's the thing. The promise is almost too good to pass up one GPU.

244
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:10,000
And then you can share it across all your rigs that have Thunderbolt three. You get a laptop with the temptation is there.

245
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:23,000
In fact, Lenovo has a dock, a Thunderbolt three dock, like it just looks like a dock, just a straight up like Thunderbolt three dock with a GTX 1050 built in and Nvidia graphics card.

246
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:28,000
So you just plug in your dock and your dock includes a video card. Very tempting.

247
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:37,000
I also looked at the Thelio systems because right now we have a big, powerful rig up on DigitalOcean that we're going to be using to do even more work.

248
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:44,000
In fact, I'm going to talk about this more in the Linux Unplugged show, but a little tidbit for the quarter radio audience.

249
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:52,000
Last week's episode was the first Jupiter broadcasting show to be programmatically published.

250
00:26:52,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Yeah. Really? Yeah. It went out. Everything. Full automation. All the publishing fully automatic. Pretty cool. We'll talk more about that later.

251
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:11,000
So what's Thelio? So I'm sure you spec'd one. So it ranges, you know, if I want a really great video card and I get a monitor and a couple other things, I can get it up to 5,500.

252
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:18,000
But like a realistic, I could actually live with this rig, something that would be slightly compromising, but not by much.

253
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:23,000
So here's what I went with. And this is like... You can upgrade these. That's true. That's true.

254
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:28,000
I went with the I'm going with Maple for that high contrast contemporary feel.

255
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:32,000
Which one's Maple? I went with Walnut. Okay. Walnuts. Yeah. The classic rich brown.

256
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:37,000
Which one did you start with? The Major or? Yes. The Major.

257
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:42,000
So we did the same one. So Major you went... Did you go AMD or Intel? I'm doing Threadripper. Yep. I'm doing Threadripper.

258
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:48,000
Okay. I did Threadripper too. I'm doing 1804 for the Linux, Ubuntu, for the GNU slash Linux.

259
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:54,000
And I decided to up it to the 4.3 gigahertz so that way I could get 12 cores. It defaults at 4 gigahertz with 8 cores.

260
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:59,000
I stuck with 8. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know. 12 cores, I don't know.

261
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:03,000
I mean, if this is a really long-term rig, I feel like 12 cores.

262
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:07,000
Well, I think that makes more sense for you, right? Video encoding is going to be more multi-threaded than...

263
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:14,000
32 gigs of RAM. 16 is just not quite enough. 64 would be my ideal, but I can make 32 work for a while.

264
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Same. I upped the default 250 gig MVME. I upped it to the 500 gig.

265
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Same. Yep. Went with that. I did not get a second M.2, but I did choose to get a 5 terabyte 5400 RPM drive.

266
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:36,000
Okay. Interesting. That's just for like media scratch storage, you know, like the larger uncompressed files.

267
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:40,000
It doesn't have to be super fast. It just needs to be large and store it somewhere.

268
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:46,000
Went with the default 1300 watt power supply, and this is where I made my first major compromise.

269
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:54,000
On the GPU, I went with the Radeon RX 550. I would rather go with the RX 580.

270
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:59,000
Really? I went with the 580. Okay, so this is where I get lost. I think I should too.

271
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:04,000
Where are the Radeons these days versus the NVIDIA?

272
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:09,000
Well, the RTXs are a little newer, but people really like the RX series a lot.

273
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:14,000
And the RX series, for my line of work, might be preferred.

274
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:19,000
I don't know though. If I was just going for gaming, because I'm not building the system to game.

275
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,000
If I was going for gaming, I honestly don't know if I could answer that.

276
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:29,000
Because the RTX 2070 is tempting as well.

277
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:34,000
See, I don't even know if I need a GPU, other than just the minimum 2 gig one.

278
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:42,000
So that's why I went with the 550, because I don't know what difference I'm going to see between the 580 and the 550 for my kind of work.

279
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,000
But if I was gaming, I'd be tempted to up it.

280
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:49,000
Didn't do a second CPU, and I didn't do a third or fourth GPU.

281
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:52,000
No, I didn't do any of that stuff. And they offer four GPUs.

282
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
And I didn't get their monitor, because that was just...

283
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,000
Yeah, I saw you tweeting, like, hey, can we see a picture of this? I completely agree.

284
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:04,000
So I think they've picked the right size, 27-inch, 2K, which is 1440p.

285
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:12,000
That is the sweet spot on Linux, because you get a ton of real estate, but you're not going into high DPI territory.

286
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:17,000
So it's all really fast on the machine. Everything looks great.

287
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:23,000
27-inch, 2K is the best resolution for desktop Linux. It's magnificent.

288
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:29,000
But they don't say what brand the monitor is. They don't show any pictures of it. They just say Pro IPS Display.

289
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:34,000
So Carl from System76 responded to me. It's a Vizio, and we can put the exact model in the show notes.

290
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
I bet that's not a bad machine.

291
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:40,000
No, they said they use them internally for color reproduction.

292
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:45,000
So there's things I don't particularly care about, but I'm sure for video production, things like that.

293
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:48,000
I went with a two-year warranty, which I actually think is a bit of a mistake.

294
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,000
For $55, I should probably go to the three-year system.

295
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:54,000
I went three years, because I tend to spill beer into things.

296
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Yeah, you do. And this is, for me, would at bare minimum be a three-year system.

297
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Actually, for desktops, I think I'm actually trending like a decade with desktop PCs.

298
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:09,000
Well, sure, because you can just upgrade the RAM, and you can upgrade the GPU.

299
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
And the disks. And the disks.

300
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:17,000
And even when I take them out of the studio, because maybe I can't go to a newer generation CPU without replacing the motherboard,

301
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:24,000
even when I take them out of the studio, they end up somewhere else in the studio building doing another task.

302
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:30,000
The only desktops that I don't have in production anymore are the ones that are like 13, 14 years old.

303
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,000
All my other desktops that I've ever built, ever, are still in production.

304
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:37,000
I still have an old Mac Mini desperately trying to codesign things.

305
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:40,000
The only machines that end up just dying and going away are laptops.

306
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:45,000
Yeah, well, because it's such a pain in the ass. You can't repair them.

307
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Yeah, GPU goes out or something like that, and it's like, what are you going to do?

308
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
So what's the damage?

309
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:55,000
Total damage, even though I'm with my compromised video card, but upping the warranty to three years,

310
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:59,000
my total damage is $3,498.

311
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
But you have a $700 monitor in there.

312
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:04,000
No, I didn't. I didn't do that. No, I didn't.

313
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,000
What about you?

314
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
My total damage was $2,864.

315
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
Oh, so where did you go cheaper than me?

316
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,000
Yeah, I'm trying to figure out how...

317
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
Did you not get the second hard drive?

318
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
I did not get the second hard drive.

319
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
Yeah, so I got the five terabytes. I need that for scratch media.

320
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:20,000
I got the cheapest one I could. It's 5,400 RPM.

321
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:25,000
Yeah, so that's where... How much are you paying for that five terabyte hard drive?

322
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:31,000
Well, let's see. If I go back to nothing, so it takes $295 off if I...

323
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,000
And I have the 8 gig RX 580 card.

324
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,000
Yeah, that I don't have. I really want that, too.

325
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:42,000
How the hell did we end up... Oh, you upgraded the CPU.

326
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
You went for the higher...

327
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,000
If I were to go back to your CPU, it would take off $499.

328
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:51,000
Yeah, that's... That's in the lowly land of... Yeah.

329
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:56,000
Yeah, I mean, seriously, the next time I want to get a Linux desktop, this is it. For real.

330
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,000
Same for me.

331
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:00,000
I'm not in a position to order this right now. I'm pretty happy with my laptop.

332
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:06,000
But I have considered taking that droplet out of production and putting it here on a local rig, and this would be a good one.

333
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:12,000
Unless I am seduced by iOS development natively because of the new iPad Pro, which is completely possible, right?

334
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:17,000
Nobody's going to have... I mean, the show might be out before, but no one has these till the 7th.

335
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
It'll take me a week or two to evaluate.

336
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
But I think the Theo Major is going to be the way I go.

337
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:25,000
CheeseBacon in the chat room says I should just keep the...

338
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:35,000
Just don't get the 5 terabyte from System76 and get a higher-end GPU and then buy a 5 terabyte drive for cheaper from, like, Newegg or something.

339
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:38,000
Which there probably would be a good Black Friday, so...

340
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,000
Yeah.

341
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:42,000
You know, it is tempting. I got to be honest. It is tempting.

342
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:49,000
If I wasn't just perfectly happy with my laptop right now and have the droplets doing the compute work for me...

343
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:55,000
The problem with the droplets, though, is I know that if I got this AMD video card, I could do...

344
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:59,000
The thing is, these AMD video cards are just super sweet.

345
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:04,000
If you have software optimized for them, and I do, it would be really nice. It would just be really, really nice.

346
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
It would make shows publish faster.

347
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:10,000
And while we're working on automating things, it would be nice to have it even snappier.

348
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,000
So, I don't know. I'll think about it in the new year, maybe, or something.

349
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:17,000
We'll see. I got to see them. I got to see it.

350
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:23,000
I want to see them, I think, before I make a nearly $4,000 purchase.

351
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
It's a lot.

352
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:28,000
And that's, like, a minimum of five-year machine for me.

353
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:32,000
So, that's a five... Not only is it a $4,000 commitment, but it's a five-year commitment, too.

354
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:35,000
That's like a relationship.

355
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:39,000
But they say they might have me out in November. Oh, I guess it is November.

356
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:42,000
And later this month to go down there and check it out.

357
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:46,000
So, we'll see. Maybe I'll do a show from System76.

358
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:53,000
Big developments for ASP.NET Core.

359
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:56,000
It's ditching the.NET framework, and it will be part...

360
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:01,000
This is probably the bigger piece, too. It'll be part of.NET Core going forward.

361
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:05,000
This is a shift. This is like.NET Core becoming the defacto.NET now.

362
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
This is like what we're seeing here.

363
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:13,000
.NET Core is, after a couple of years, emerging as the defacto future of.NET.

364
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:17,000
I think. Your thoughts, sir. What do you think?

365
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:23,000
Yeah, I think this is kind of Microsoft being very direct and saying that

366
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:30,000
the future preferred version of ASP.NET is going to be.NET Core.

367
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:35,000
Which I think makes a ton of sense because I heard from a very reputable source

368
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:39,000
that the dirty little secret of Azure is that most of their virtual machines are being run on.

369
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
Are you ready? No.

370
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
Are you ready? No.

371
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,000
Ubuntu. Oh, I thought you were going to say Mac OS.

372
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:49,000
Yes, it's just a big old Mac mini server.

373
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:52,000
Microsoft is deeply excited about the new Mac mini.

374
00:35:52,000 --> 00:36:00,000
Yeah, so I don't know what to say. I like writing C sharp. It is not a bad language.

375
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:05,000
I don't like doing it on Windows. I like deploying to Linux. I like Docker.

376
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:10,000
These are all things that make a lot of sense to me.

377
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:16,000
I think this is.NET Core as a platform maturing, which, again,

378
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:21,000
I really can't complain about because it's good.

379
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:24,000
It has been a little, it's been a couple of years in the making, hasn't it?

380
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:27,000
Yeah, it's been around for a while.

381
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:33,000
So, moving on then. Let's get to the feedback. Let's get to it.

382
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:37,000
Eric tweeted us at Tumanoko and at Coda Radio Show.

383
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:40,000
I went back into the archives of the Coda Radio program,

384
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:47,000
hoping to get some backstory on how you and Chris both started your independent contractor lives.

385
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:51,000
Can you or at ChrisLS point me to a blog post or a podcast episode?

386
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:56,000
Because I only got back as far as 55.

387
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:04,000
So, what do you say, Mr. Dominic? Should we jump in the Wayback Machine?

388
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,000
Let's do it.

389
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:09,000
I don't know if we've ever covered it in one concise,

390
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:12,000
like this is how we got started as independent contractors.

391
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
So, you want me to start?

392
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,000
I want you to start.

393
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
Let me see that. I'm looking at your cheat sheet here and I see that.

394
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:26,000
Well, you know, I became an independent contractor after years of being an employee.

395
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:29,000
I started early on while I was still in high school.

396
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:32,000
So, I got like a really early start in the IT.

397
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:37,000
Really, I started very early on when I was a junior,

398
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
when I was a sophomore going to a junior.

399
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:44,000
So, like that summer, that summer becoming a sophomore then transitioning to a junior.

400
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
That's when I became employed in the IT industry.

401
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
So, that was quite a while ago now.

402
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:56,000
And it wasn't until a couple of bad jobs where I was kind of pissed off when I left

403
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
that I realized I needed to change.

404
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:04,000
And I think probably most of you will recognize this part of the story.

405
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,000
It's all about who you know.

406
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:10,000
My mom was working for a company that had some IT contractors coming in

407
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
and they were understaffed.

408
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:15,000
And the company that she was working for wanted more of their time

409
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
and the IT company didn't have any more staff.

410
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:21,000
And so, she thought, well, my son knows IT and he hates his job.

411
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:25,000
So, she says, hey, why don't you talk to my son?

412
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
So, I called them up.

413
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:31,000
We had a little meeting scheduled and I talked to them and it sounded pretty good.

414
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
It sounded okay. It sounded all right. I could do that.

415
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:37,000
I could drive around to different places and fix their networks.

416
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:41,000
And as time went on, it turned out I actually had a good knack for that.

417
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:45,000
And I started to learn the ropes because I wasn't directly an independent contractor.

418
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:48,000
I was working for a company that would send me out.

419
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:55,000
And sort of learned like the basics of event tracking and ticket tracking

420
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:58,000
and customer management and that kind of stuff.

421
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:02,000
And worked pretty hard at that for a long time.

422
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:07,000
Really got myself up to sort of the upper echelon of the firm's best clients.

423
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:12,000
And with that came the firm's upper echelon of the most stress.

424
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:16,000
And I think I really was really worn down.

425
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
And I was looking at my situation and looking at my health.

426
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
It's just funny.

427
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:23,000
Funny, history repeats itself now that I tell the story.

428
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:26,000
Like, it really takes until I've run my health into the ground.

429
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:30,000
And then once I've run my health into the ground and I've sort of hit rock bottom health wise,

430
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:35,000
I do like this full life evaluation, which just happened a little while ago, once again.

431
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:45,000
And I realized, you know, I could just take one client or two clients or maybe three clients directly.

432
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:49,000
And I don't need to have 12 clients.

433
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:54,000
I just need, for me personally, I just need like two or three clients and I could make enough money.

434
00:39:54,000 --> 00:40:01,000
And it was with that kind of mindset that I sort of started thinking,

435
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:06,000
well, who can I reach out to that wouldn't be competing with the existing employer,

436
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:11,000
but I have a relationship with or they know me or maybe I know why they might need me.

437
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:16,000
And so I just sort of took my time, took about a month looking at that, building out a contact list.

438
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:21,000
And once I got three clients that were willing to hire me directly,

439
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:28,000
I gave my two weeks at my employer and I became an independent contractor.

440
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,000
And then I just sort of applied the same methodology.

441
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:35,000
I sort of whittled it down from three clients to two clients.

442
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:40,000
And then as the podcasting stuff started taking it off, I whittled it down from two clients to one client.

443
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:46,000
And then as the podcasting revenue started to make enough that I could at least stop doing I.T.,

444
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:51,000
I wasn't making as much, but I could stop doing I.T., I wrapped up that last client,

445
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:55,000
which was sort of perfect because it coincided with them merging with another company that had their own I.T.

446
00:40:55,000 --> 00:41:01,000
department. They didn't need me. So they gave me like it was like a really generous like six month.

447
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:08,000
Like you got in six months, we're no longer need your services or something like this fantastically generous notice for a contract because,

448
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:11,000
you know, of a contractor, you can be called in an office and told you're done.

449
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:17,000
So getting a six month notice was like, wow, this this gives me a six month roadmap now to go get the J.B.

450
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:23,000
revenue spun up to go do that. And so it was a series of sort of reevaluating

451
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:28,000
and then refocusing and reevaluating and refocusing and then eventually went just independent doing the J.B. stuff.

452
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:33,000
But it really started as an employee of another contracting company.

453
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:39,000
And kind of learning the ropes there and then and then going out, I don't think it was absolutely necessary

454
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:46,000
because if you have good customer management instincts and maybe you can work with somebody who knows how to do the books and you've somehow,

455
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:50,000
you know, got a good ticket system, you don't really you know, if you can figure that stuff out, you don't need to.

456
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:54,000
But it was useful for me because I'd come from the corporate world.

457
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:59,000
And really, that was my experience, was dealing in the corporate world.

458
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:02,000
And you need you need a different skill set to be a contractor.

459
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:06,000
But it's not a massively different skill set, like all your core technical abilities still apply.

460
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:11,000
So just it's an amendment of personal skills and management skills that you have to learn.

461
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:17,000
And so I was able to watch this company try that directly, also learn the things that they did that didn't work.

462
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:24,000
And I sort of internalized all of that. And then when I took myself independent, those lessons I brought with me.

463
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:28,000
And so I was able to do something that was more focused on how I work.

464
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:40,000
And really, looking back at it, I could I could definitely now see a trajectory where I grew that and I made that more successful.

465
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:43,000
You know, hired some people to manage some of the clients.

466
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:50,000
So instead of spinning down clients, I could have brought somebody on to manage that client for me and did like a revenue share.

467
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:54,000
And could have grown that sort of like Noah has grown all to speed over the years.

468
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:57,000
But I'm fantastically happy doing what I'm doing.

469
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:01,000
So no longer in fact, I'm no longer even independent. Now I work for Linux Academy.

470
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:04,000
So I've done a full circle. I've gone back to being an employee again.

471
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:08,000
And that's sort of my abbreviated story. I'm kind of amazed that I got it out that fast.

472
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:14,000
What about you, Mr. Dominic? What about what about your what about your origin story?

473
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:20,000
Oh, well, back when the gods were petty and cruel, that is.

474
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
And by the way, a storm just started. So it's perfect time.

475
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:31,000
Holy crap. Did you know I just heard a fact that like you guys have 80 a minimum of like something like 80 thunderstorms a year down there or something like that?

476
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:34,000
It's it's it's yeah, it's a little bit.

477
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:46,000
So, you know, like most nerds start programming around middle school, high school, back in the battle days, I then did odd jobs doing actually was a janitor for a while in high school.

478
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:52,000
I used to work after school. Yeah. And then after that, I went to college on a half scholarship.

479
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:58,000
Half is the important part because, well, this is going to upset our new Linux overlords.

480
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:05,000
But I would I was one of those college not coed, but whatever you call the opposite of a coed who just needed a little money.

481
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:10,000
So I started working at a company running Java applets.

482
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:19,000
And if you don't know what a Java applet is, you're not quite as evil as I am or old or old.

483
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:22,000
They're right from that active X vintage.

484
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:30,000
And you really should just be I I am to this day. Sorry for what I did.

485
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:39,000
Like it's bad. So anyway, work there, you know, but eventually there was one of those jobs that was like they'd hire you seasonally with the company.

486
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:46,000
And I once the name of the company, although they no longer exist, but their whole business was writing marketing kiosks in the mall, which I'm sure still exists.

487
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:53,000
Like an iPad now. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Well, they would just run like IE and we would write this Java applet software to take surveys from people.

488
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:57,000
Oh, that was you. Again, I'm very, very sorry.

489
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:02,000
Yeah. The security vulnerabilities and Java applets are completely my fault.

490
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:12,000
So moving on from there, I did a lot of web development until one day an uncle of mine who was a little bit of an Apple fan.

491
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:17,000
So at the time I was a Windows, not really a deep Windows guy, though, because money.

492
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:23,000
But like I would I was always like getting hand me down computers for like everyone, like your local computer shop is still a thing.

493
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:29,000
Oh, man. And slapping like open to eight, ten or nine or four or nine, ten, whatever.

494
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:33,000
The last one I used, I think the last one I used was nine, ten.

495
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:42,000
And he kind of hooked me up with an iOS device and a original aluminum MacBook, whichever year.

496
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:47,000
So that was around two thousand eight or nine.

497
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:53,000
I started writing very, very rudimentary iOS software because at the time it was just rudimentary.

498
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:57,000
Right. The SDK wasn't that mature. It was brand new from there.

499
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:05,000
I launched a business. It did iOS development until 2014.

500
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:12,000
Got up to 14 employees, ended up being a disaster, moved on to more Webby Linux things.

501
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:21,000
Now I'm doing a lot of aviation software and I am again reevaluating what the next big project I want to take on is.

502
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:25,000
So we had in our first segment about Mac Mini's versus Thelios.

503
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:31,000
The question for me right now is, do I double down and go back to roots and do some iOS native development for a while,

504
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:35,000
given that I have this dream that tablets will be productivity devices?

505
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:45,000
Or do I double down what I think the opposite is and do a lot of IoT small kind of embedded systems, mostly running Linux?

506
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:50,000
That's the abbreviated version of the origin story. Launched a few products between then and now.

507
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:56,000
And it's sort of dramatic with that rain in the background, you know?

508
00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:01,000
Yeah, it's pretty dramatic. I've had everything happen.

509
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:05,000
I launched a Mac app that hit the top of the App Store and then got immediately copied.

510
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,000
Oh my gosh.

511
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:10,000
Remember that? We were already doing the show by then.

512
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:13,000
I got sued by a patent troll.

513
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:22,000
I have hired, fired, shut down company. Yeah, I've done the whole – I mean, I have not yet taken the graceful out that Chris did.

514
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:27,000
But I have to tell you, I at one point did get a job offer from a very large tech company.

515
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:36,000
And I probably like wonder if I should have taken it as I see Chris with his wonderful executive life.

516
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:41,000
So yeah, I'm still in the trenches like trying to find, all right, what's the next product we're going to launch?

517
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
What are we doing, right? Yeah.

518
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:49,000
We just launched our radar system and selling that is – I'm flying around the country trying to sell it.

519
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:53,000
Yeah, it's almost like you go through phases.

520
00:47:53,000 --> 00:48:00,000
I could see that if I was sitting – if this was a job where I just stayed at the studio and I worked all the time,

521
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:08,000
I would probably get too bored and I would want to do something more adventurous and I'd want to do something maybe more risky even.

522
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:11,000
I mean, you got to have fun. You only live once.

523
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:18,000
But I did kind of get lucky so far because I'm a little – I'm hung over but not in the booze sense.

524
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:30,000
I'm hung over today in the travel sense because we decided, Mr. Westpain and I, we ran down to the Portland Users Linux Group last night

525
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:34,000
and we attended their meeting just to have fun.

526
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:38,000
It's just to change it up and meet people in the community and whatnot.

527
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:42,000
And we did. We got to meet a few listeners down there and we drove back.

528
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:47,000
The event in Portland ended at 9 and it's a four-hour drive for me home.

529
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:51,000
So I got home like at 2 a.m. basically because I had to drop Wes off too.

530
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:55,000
And holy crap, am I exhausted today.

531
00:48:55,000 --> 00:49:00,000
But it's – I don't know, if I didn't do that kind of stuff, I'd go batty.

532
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
I'd get bored. I'd go nuts.

533
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:08,000
So you got to have the right – you got to find the right cadence of work for you.

534
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:13,000
And sometimes that only can be accomplished when you are your own boss, when you're working for yourself.

535
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
And you have to enjoy the adventure, right?

536
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:21,000
Self-employment is – let me tell you, there are a lot more lows than highs, right?

537
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:26,000
You're going to launch a lot more products. You're going to do a lot more projects that don't end up being home runs.

538
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:29,000
Might be, right?

539
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
I mean, Chris, how many shows have you launched?

540
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:35,000
Oh, jeez, right. Good point. Yeah. Yeah.

541
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:39,000
Yeah, it took a certain lineup to make us a company that was worth purchasing too.

542
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:44,000
And it took us to working on that for a while. I mean, that is a great point. So many shows.

543
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:47,000
Like I gave you the example just from like the series of Macintosh apps.

544
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:50,000
I have a Macintosh. Wow, dated.

545
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,000
Old.

546
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:59,000
Old Mac OS apps I've launched. Code Journal was a hit but quickly failed because we had like five competitors in three weeks, right?

547
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:03,000
But it did – like of all of them, it did well.

548
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:11,000
Gitmask, which I don't remember if you – it was my master Git commits app, which I intended to be used in a way that wasn't evil.

549
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:14,000
What ended up happening was people were plagiarizing other people's work using it.

550
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:21,000
And it was quickly – got a lot of criticism for that one.

551
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:30,000
So yeah. I'm sure you don't know what it is but what it would do is basically rewrite Git history.

552
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:38,000
So the idea was if you're a consulting company, you don't want when you hand over the repo to your customer them to have everybody's like email address.

553
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:46,000
So you might change it to something like sales at themadbotter.com, right? You just rewrite the whole repo history.

554
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:58,000
What I found out people were doing was taking 1099 contracting jobs with these contracting shops and then subcontracting their work and using the app to rewrite their Git history to be their email address.

555
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:09,000
So – and then I got a lot of very angry emails from people who ran these contracting firms rightly criticizing me for publishing a tool that basically caused them a lot of legal liability.

556
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:14,000
Thank God for the end user license agreement on that one. Yeah.

557
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:18,000
So that's – boy, that's a history right there.

558
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:22,000
That's history. We've done it all.

559
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:27,000
That's good. I'm glad we brought the Wayback Machine today. I'm glad we brought the Wayback Machine. That's good.

560
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,000
So thank you, Eric, for asking.

561
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:37,000
If anybody out there has a story that they could kind of put into like a three-paragraph, two-paragraph email, two-paragraph email, send it in, coder.show slash contact.

562
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
I'd like to get that – figure that out.

563
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,000
Yeah. So how about our tool of the week before we go?

564
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:44,000
How do you pronounce this one? Is it gah?

565
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
I was saying gah, like when gah.

566
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:51,000
Oh, yes, of course. I was thinking gah, like the Klingon dish that is best served alive.

567
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:55,000
You know, you're very Klingon, I got to say.

568
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:56,000
Gah.

569
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
Are you Chukwuma? Is that what you're about to tell me?

570
00:51:58,000 --> 00:51:59,000
Yeah.

571
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:00,000
Chukwuma.

572
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:10,000
I am. You know that – just saying, spoiler alert, that is the super just like anticlimactic. Nothing happens with that. It's just totally like – all right, and now I'm out of here. Anyways.

573
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,000
And season one doesn't count.

574
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
We really should spoiler alert that though. Okay.

575
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:15,000
Yeah.

576
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:18,000
So gah. So tell me about –

577
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:25,000
So gah is a way to bring honor to your – oh, wait, no, wrong thing. It is a dish made of – nope, wrong.

578
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:29,000
Basically, it's terminal themes for Linux terminals.

579
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:35,000
So on Mac, you can upload a terminal theme to your terminal.

580
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:44,000
If you don't like the default theme, let's say you're on Ubuntu and that's just like way too much purple for you, you can go ahead, download this, and you can change to any of these profiles.

581
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:48,000
My preferred theme is Tomorrow Night 80s.

582
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:51,000
Don't laugh. I'm not that old, damn it, Chris. Stop.

583
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:56,000
But yes, I do use Tomorrow Night 80s on everything, and this makes it very easy to put that on.

584
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
But it gives you all the classics, right?

585
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:05,000
In fact, they have a special elementary OS one if you're not on elementary, but would like your stuff to look like it.

586
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:06,000
I have no idea.

587
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:07,000
That's nice.

588
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:10,000
When you're visiting the Mac, you can still have it look like home.

589
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:11,000
Isn't that nice?

590
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,000
I see what you did there. I see what you did there, yeah.

591
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:14,000
All right. So let's see, everybody.

592
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
There's a few details we should probably leave you with.

593
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:21,000
Everything we talked about today is linked at coder.show slash 332.

594
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:26,000
You can also get RSS subscription links at coder.show slash subscribe.

595
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:31,000
And go follow Mr. Dominic on the Twitter at Dumanuco on the Twitters.

596
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,000
He's over there. You can follow him. I'm at ChrisLAS.

597
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,000
What else? Anything else you want to mention before we get out of here?

598
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:42,000
No. Happy trails, Chris. Let's all make it back in one piece without any kind of cloaking devices.

599
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
Safe travels to you as well.

600
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:51,000
And remember that the Klingons can detect if you're using a universal translator, so you've got to read it from the book directly.

601
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:52,000
You've got to read it directly.

602
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:55,000
As we all have learned, we've all learned that.

603
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,000
Well, I guess that's everything I'll say.

604
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,000
If you want to know when we're doing this show live, we'd love to have you.

605
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:05,000
If the streams are working at jupiterbroadcasting.com slash calendar, that's where you can go to see our live schedule.

606
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
And of course, we'd love to hear your thoughts on Twitter.

607
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
But there is that subreddit.

608
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,000
We check it before every show.

609
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:14,000
And that's just as valid as a way to get your feedback.

610
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
That's coderradio.reddit.com.

611
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:20,000
Although if you don't like Reddit and you still want to get your feedback in, tell you what.

612
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,000
Just for you. Just for you.

613
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
Coder.show slash contact.

614
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:25,000
Just for you.

615
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:26,000
Alright, thanks for joining us.

616
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:54,000
We'll see you back here next week.
