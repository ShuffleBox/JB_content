00:00.000 --> 00:08.000
This is KOTORadio, episode 322, for August 13th, 2018.

00:31.000 --> 00:34.920
Hello everybody, and welcome to KOTORadio, Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show,

00:34.920 --> 00:39.840
taking a pragmatic look at the art and business of software development and its related technologies.

00:39.840 --> 00:44.440
This episode is brought to you by our two great sponsors, Linux Academy and Digital

00:44.440 --> 00:45.440
Ocean.

00:45.440 --> 00:47.400
I'll tell you more about those great sponsors as this year's show goes on.

00:47.400 --> 00:48.400
Why me?

00:48.400 --> 00:49.400
Thanks for asking.

00:49.400 --> 00:53.240
My name is Chris, but more importantly is that podcasting ninja, that wizard of the

00:53.240 --> 00:57.200
cute, that man in Florida, it's our host, Mr. Dominic.

00:57.200 --> 00:59.080
Hello Mike.

00:59.080 --> 01:00.080
Hello Chris.

01:00.080 --> 01:01.080
What are we doing over there?

01:01.080 --> 01:03.200
Are we opening one up at the start of the show?

01:03.200 --> 01:04.240
We're opening one up.

01:04.240 --> 01:09.920
The drink of the show today is a Sweetwater Tropical Lover, Berliner Weissbier, out of

01:09.920 --> 01:10.920
Florida.

01:10.920 --> 01:12.680
You know, I'm repping in my new home state.

01:12.680 --> 01:13.680
Yeah.

01:13.680 --> 01:16.440
It sounds like a nice summer beverage too, I gotta be honest with you.

01:16.440 --> 01:17.440
Good call on that.

01:17.440 --> 01:20.800
It's always summer in Florida, and in the summer you basically feel like you're in downtown

01:20.800 --> 01:21.800
Fallujah.

01:21.800 --> 01:22.800
So, you know.

01:22.800 --> 01:23.800
Yeah, that's probably it.

01:23.800 --> 01:26.120
Well then, I guess there's even more reason to drink, Mr. Dominic.

01:26.120 --> 01:30.960
Now I have been looking forward to today's episode since we got off the air last week,

01:30.960 --> 01:34.720
because we've been following along on your cute journey, and it's been generating quite

01:34.720 --> 01:36.640
a bit of interest from the audience.

01:36.640 --> 01:40.560
So we're gonna be doing an update today on that, as well as covering a bunch of feedback,

01:40.560 --> 01:45.360
talk a little Google AMP, talk a little LGPL, and we've got a tool of the week.

01:45.360 --> 01:50.920
It's like a fully rounded out diet, like, you know, like a fully recommended breakfast

01:50.920 --> 01:52.940
when you're eating your cereal, you know, you have to have your orange juice too.

01:52.940 --> 01:56.280
It's like a fully recommended podcast diet.

01:56.280 --> 01:58.320
Hmm, someone's been listening to ATP.

01:58.320 --> 01:59.320
Is that where I got that from?

01:59.320 --> 02:00.560
Yeah, that's where you got that from.

02:00.560 --> 02:03.200
I was trying, I was thinking about that when I said that, where has somebody been talking

02:03.200 --> 02:04.880
about cereal recently?

02:04.880 --> 02:05.880
For 20 minutes.

02:05.880 --> 02:06.880
What?

02:06.880 --> 02:10.840
Okay, well, let's not do that, because I know that got on my mind, and then I started wanting

02:10.840 --> 02:15.020
cereal, and I don't even know where it got in there from.

02:15.020 --> 02:18.240
It's been the weirdest thing, so maybe that's why I got so sick.

02:18.240 --> 02:19.480
Anyways, we won't get into that.

02:19.480 --> 02:20.480
We don't want to talk about that.

02:20.480 --> 02:21.960
Let's talk about some of the feedback we got.

02:21.960 --> 02:22.960
Go ahead.

02:22.960 --> 02:23.960
Read it out.

02:23.960 --> 02:26.720
Qt got people thinking, and this one came in from Johnny, and it's not for him.

02:26.720 --> 02:32.360
He says, hey guys, he says, hey guys, he says, I'm not a fan of Qt at all.

02:32.360 --> 02:34.680
It's a very complex system for simple UIs.

02:34.680 --> 02:36.840
It just has never fit my needs, I guess.

02:36.840 --> 02:41.720
Now if I was a C++ programmer, I may use it, but because of the licensing, I'd probably

02:41.720 --> 02:45.080
shy away from it for anything that's commercial just because of that strange licensing.

02:45.080 --> 02:49.880
I'd probably end up going towards WX widgets if I was forced to use C++.

02:49.880 --> 02:56.160
However, I am a C programmer, so I used a library called IUP.

02:56.160 --> 02:58.080
Check it out when you have a chance.

02:58.080 --> 03:02.480
It's simple and clean and allows you to describe windows in a simple file format that can then

03:02.480 --> 03:03.480
be loaded.

03:03.480 --> 03:06.080
There are even Lua bindings, which I also like.

03:06.080 --> 03:11.560
In my humble opinion, for quick UIs, IUP, or up, IUP, whatever it is, has really been

03:11.560 --> 03:12.560
good to me.

03:12.560 --> 03:15.720
Now, I would like to say that Qt would be the way to go for teams of programmers that

03:15.720 --> 03:16.940
are working on large projects.

03:16.940 --> 03:18.100
Just my two cents.

03:18.100 --> 03:19.320
Really been enjoying the topics.

03:19.320 --> 03:20.440
Really been interested in me.

03:20.440 --> 03:22.680
Keep up the good work, guys.

03:22.680 --> 03:24.840
Now don't say anything, because we have more.

03:24.840 --> 03:29.120
Because then Gary kind of comes in, not to interrupt, but I want you to hear this part

03:29.120 --> 03:30.120
too.

03:30.120 --> 03:31.120
Gary comes in with the other side.

03:31.120 --> 03:33.320
He says, I liked the discussion around Qt and Qt Creator.

03:33.320 --> 03:37.520
I like Qt quite a bit, but I don't love Qt Creator itself.

03:37.520 --> 03:41.520
I don't really work in GUI, so I have no visual artistic talent to begin with, and I'm terrible

03:41.520 --> 03:42.520
at it.

03:42.520 --> 03:44.520
My GUIs make the 80s look good.

03:44.520 --> 03:47.600
But the keyboard shortcuts blow away Visual Studio.

03:47.600 --> 03:51.520
I work on projects where there's three to four million lines of code, and I do it all

03:51.520 --> 03:52.720
mainly on Linux.

03:52.720 --> 03:56.560
And the way I make it work is ZLinux and Windows.

03:56.560 --> 03:58.360
And I have to use Visual Studio.

03:58.360 --> 04:00.120
I'll just use remote desktop.

04:00.120 --> 04:03.680
I used to like Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code, but it seems like it's become clunkier

04:03.680 --> 04:05.520
and larger since it launched.

04:05.520 --> 04:08.120
So I like the Qt, but not so much the Qt Creator.

04:08.120 --> 04:09.120
Gary.

04:09.120 --> 04:10.120
So there you go.

04:10.120 --> 04:16.140
You got Johnny, who doesn't like Qt, and you got Gary, who does like Qt.

04:16.140 --> 04:18.420
And I find that whole thing to be kind of funny.

04:18.420 --> 04:21.400
Just like typical audience response, you have one group that really likes something, and

04:21.400 --> 04:22.780
the other group that doesn't.

04:22.780 --> 04:26.980
But there has been a general level of interest here that I think is pretty big.

04:26.980 --> 04:30.000
And Eric, our last one, and then I'll let you jump in here.

04:30.000 --> 04:34.800
Eric writes in, he says, I wanted to let you guys know that I came across a QML library

04:34.800 --> 04:36.120
for.NET.

04:36.120 --> 04:37.560
It's still in early development.

04:37.560 --> 04:41.080
I don't have any experience with it, so I don't know if it's a good idea or not, but

04:41.080 --> 04:42.480
I thought you might just find it useful.

04:42.480 --> 04:46.560
And then he links us to the GitHub project, qml.net.

04:46.560 --> 04:48.440
That does sound kind of interesting.

04:48.440 --> 04:50.240
So there you go.

04:50.240 --> 04:56.000
That is sort of my slam through of the general temperature of the Qt feedback.

04:56.000 --> 05:01.240
What do you think, Mr. Wizard, Mr. Florida Wizard?

05:01.240 --> 05:02.240
I love it.

05:02.240 --> 05:05.360
And I've summoned a storm just to show my enthusiasm.

05:05.360 --> 05:06.360
Is that what that is?

05:06.360 --> 05:07.360
Wow.

05:07.360 --> 05:08.700
That gives a lot of rain.

05:08.700 --> 05:11.920
So yeah, I mean, we got a lot of feedback on Qt.

05:11.920 --> 05:13.600
A lot of people are interested in it.

05:13.600 --> 05:18.120
Today's episode is going to be largely on Qt.

05:18.120 --> 05:23.400
But I did not know, particularly Eric's feedback, how many different bindings there are for

05:23.400 --> 05:24.400
QML.

05:24.400 --> 05:26.000
Obviously, he found.NET.

05:26.000 --> 05:27.000
There's Python.

05:27.000 --> 05:29.680
I even thought I found a Java binding.

05:29.680 --> 05:35.360
There's just a lot of ways to, I guess, use Qt without actually having to use C++.

05:35.360 --> 05:38.440
Yeah, the.NET one surprised me.

05:38.440 --> 05:39.440
I mean, not that much.

05:39.440 --> 05:42.600
None of these things surprised me that much, but it didn't come up in our conversation.

05:42.600 --> 05:43.600
I hadn't gone looking for it.

05:43.600 --> 05:46.520
So it was nice for Eric to send that in.

05:46.520 --> 05:49.400
I'm pretty excited by the potential.

05:49.400 --> 05:51.360
I think there's a lot there to it.

05:51.360 --> 05:52.360
I don't know.

05:52.360 --> 05:55.520
Maybe you'll change my tune as we get into the show here.

05:55.520 --> 06:00.240
But yeah, I had a story that was submitted into the show that I wanted to chat with you

06:00.240 --> 06:03.320
just as a general hoopla before we really get into the rest of the show.

06:03.320 --> 06:07.920
There is a post over on rockstarcoders.com, which already kind of triggers me.

06:07.920 --> 06:09.040
I can't help it.

06:09.040 --> 06:11.040
And the post goes something a little bit like this.

06:11.040 --> 06:16.400
I've got egg on my face with no fewer than three articles and three YouTube videos bragging

06:16.400 --> 06:21.400
about how great my design work has been lately to get a 500% improvement in our conversion

06:21.400 --> 06:22.400
rate.

06:22.400 --> 06:27.760
And now I've gone and lost a huge chunk of that improvement with some recent changes.

06:27.760 --> 06:30.460
Let's talk about Google AMP.

06:30.460 --> 06:32.800
AMP stands for Accelerated Mobile Pages.

06:32.800 --> 06:37.000
It's a technology Google originally introduced to get web developers to speed up their web

06:37.000 --> 06:39.760
pages for mobile devices and mobile networks.

06:39.760 --> 06:43.680
But in many ways, it seems like a great technology for any device or network who doesn't want

06:43.680 --> 06:44.960
fast websites.

06:44.960 --> 06:46.040
Everyone does.

06:46.040 --> 06:47.960
There's nothing that's all that magical about it.

06:47.960 --> 06:50.720
A big part of the performance boost is simply its standards.

06:50.720 --> 06:58.160
No JavaScript, all inline CSS, and the CSS can only measure 500 kilobytes or less.

06:58.160 --> 07:01.480
You're going to make any page load faster with those requirements.

07:01.480 --> 07:05.260
But Google AMP also hosts the AMP pages from their own CDN.

07:05.260 --> 07:09.920
So certain pages you bump in from organic search results will actually display from

07:09.920 --> 07:11.640
Google's own servers.

07:11.640 --> 07:13.220
And it's very fast.

07:13.220 --> 07:18.000
In organic and recently paid placements on your page, there's even a nifty AMP lightning

07:18.000 --> 07:22.560
bolt icon to let people know it's going to be super fast.

07:22.560 --> 07:25.940
The thing is, as he jumps in on it, he puts his clients through there.

07:25.940 --> 07:31.420
But now he's saying that it has been a dramatic reduction in the traffic to the website.

07:31.420 --> 07:34.600
And he talks about how so there's been some challenges with some AMP pages being broken,

07:34.600 --> 07:38.960
sometimes blank pages are served, sometimes multiple pages on your site are surfaced as

07:38.960 --> 07:41.160
AMP pages.

07:41.160 --> 07:45.680
But the core takeaway is they saw a 70% drop in their conversion rate when they started

07:45.680 --> 07:46.680
to deploy AMP.

07:46.680 --> 07:49.720
And he goes into a series of reasons about this.

07:49.720 --> 07:52.680
But I wanted to just take a moment, since it's up in the hoopla, to discuss it with

07:52.680 --> 07:57.200
you because I've had an opportunity to discuss it with Joe a little bit on Linux Action News.

07:57.200 --> 08:02.880
And our core takeaway is that while it's great for end users to load pages faster, what would

08:02.880 --> 08:06.040
be a lot better is if people just built better websites.

08:06.040 --> 08:15.040
Is that, am I just, am I so insulated as a geek, can I just not wrap my head around why

08:15.040 --> 08:19.880
people can't build slightly better websites or why we can't just do this ourselves?

08:19.880 --> 08:22.560
Why do we need Google to build AMP?

08:22.560 --> 08:24.800
Why can't it be something that people do themselves?

08:24.800 --> 08:28.960
And so when you see things like, well, it's hosted on their own domain, so they take away

08:28.960 --> 08:31.960
our URL, so we lose some of the branding.

08:31.960 --> 08:32.960
People don't know if it's us.

08:32.960 --> 08:35.920
When people share the URLs, our own name isn't in the URL.

08:35.920 --> 08:40.680
There's all these complaints that Google is working to address.

08:40.680 --> 08:44.280
And Google is promising that any web page that matches the performance of an AMP page

08:44.280 --> 08:48.080
will get the same exact treatment in the Google search rankings.

08:48.080 --> 08:51.600
But that's, but come on, that's impossible.

08:51.600 --> 08:56.600
If Google is serving up these web pages from their own CDN, there's no way you're going

08:56.600 --> 09:00.600
to beat that unless you're probably hosting it on Google Cloud.

09:00.600 --> 09:02.960
And it's just a no-win scenario.

09:02.960 --> 09:07.400
And I feel like we are just slowly succumbing to this and we're going to lose independence.

09:07.400 --> 09:11.440
And maybe being an independent publisher on the internet for more than a decade skews

09:11.440 --> 09:17.560
my view of this, but I hate the idea of people sharing links to a Jupiter broadcasting episode

09:17.560 --> 09:22.280
and it's an AMP URL and not a Jupiter broadcasting URL.

09:22.280 --> 09:26.840
Just like I detest the fact that Stitcher re-hosts our content and re-encodes the MP3s

09:26.840 --> 09:32.640
and makes them sound worse, it goes against fundamentally why I'm an independent content

09:32.640 --> 09:33.640
creator.

09:33.640 --> 09:34.880
I hate that aspect of it.

09:34.880 --> 09:37.320
It's just anybody that has pride of their work, you don't even have to be independent.

09:37.320 --> 09:41.640
You could be an employee that works for a newspaper and just have pride in journalism

09:41.640 --> 09:43.080
and you wouldn't want that to happen.

09:43.080 --> 09:45.480
So I've gone on here for a little bit, but I'd love to get your take on it because I

09:45.480 --> 09:47.280
don't think I've ever gotten to pick your brain on this topic.

09:47.280 --> 09:51.380
And if you think, if this is maybe just an issue that these folks over at Rockstar Coders

09:51.380 --> 09:55.520
are blowing out of proportion, maybe my insulated geek bubble is causing me to see this with

09:55.520 --> 09:58.600
rose-colored glasses, but to me, it seems like the solution is people should just build

09:58.600 --> 10:01.120
better sites.

10:01.120 --> 10:05.520
Easier thing is like, is AMP itself something people should be doing?

10:05.520 --> 10:06.520
Yeah.

10:06.520 --> 10:13.120
I would argue no, because like instant apps and things like that, it's just another, you

10:13.120 --> 10:17.760
know, Google takes a lot of these shots and developers implement stuff and then Google

10:17.760 --> 10:20.440
decides they're done with something.

10:20.440 --> 10:22.040
This feels a lot like that.

10:22.040 --> 10:27.920
It also feels a little icky, for lack of a better word, that, oh, if you're as performant

10:27.920 --> 10:33.060
as something hosted on our CDN, on our search engine, we will give you equal treatment.

10:33.060 --> 10:37.280
So what they're saying is this is a way for like SEO people to really game.

10:37.280 --> 10:40.040
That's what this sounds like to me.

10:40.040 --> 10:44.200
Your question about can people build better websites, your old buddy Brian Lunduke has

10:44.200 --> 10:46.560
actually endeavored to answer that question.

10:46.560 --> 10:47.800
His answer is they can, they won't.

10:47.800 --> 10:49.720
And I happen to agree with him.

10:49.720 --> 10:51.140
It's an intentional thing?

10:51.140 --> 10:52.140
People want bad websites?

10:52.140 --> 10:53.140
It's an intentional thing.

10:53.140 --> 10:54.140
They're intent.

10:54.140 --> 10:58.320
Well, no, people want to track and monetize their users.

10:58.320 --> 11:03.360
So what's happening is if you, let's go to like, what the hell, the carer switcher hates

11:03.360 --> 11:04.360
me anyway.

11:04.360 --> 11:13.920
Let's go to recode.net and open up a Chrome window and just look at all the crazy JavaScript

11:13.920 --> 11:18.380
running and actually the Verge is worse, but the Verge is notoriously bad.

11:18.380 --> 11:22.500
That's why I didn't pick on them, although they're the same company now.

11:22.500 --> 11:24.980
It's not that like there's something magical.

11:24.980 --> 11:28.520
Of course, image sizes have gotten bigger, videos, things like that.

11:28.520 --> 11:34.720
But it's the ad tracking, it's the cookies, it's the all kinds of third-party integrations

11:34.720 --> 11:41.120
such as Facebook and you know, frankly, customer analytics firms that most people have never

11:41.120 --> 11:43.720
heard of that's slowing down your web experience.

11:43.720 --> 11:46.400
I think it's definitely, I think that's definitely fair.

11:46.400 --> 11:47.400
It's definitely that.

11:47.400 --> 11:48.560
I don't think it's only that.

11:48.560 --> 11:49.560
Like you look at Jupiter Broadcasting.

11:49.560 --> 11:51.200
Of course, it's not only that, yeah.

11:51.200 --> 11:58.660
Our site doesn't really, I mean, there may still be Google Analytics on there, maybe,

11:58.660 --> 12:00.320
but we don't track for ad purposes.

12:00.320 --> 12:03.420
We don't have any ads on our website, but it's WordPress, you know, because we wanted

12:03.420 --> 12:08.760
a push button publishing system and we just, and so if I had, if I had a dedicated web

12:08.760 --> 12:13.840
developer who could develop a static website that was like updated from Markdown files

12:13.840 --> 12:17.760
in the CDN, you know, however it would work to publish podcasts with a static site, that

12:17.760 --> 12:19.400
would be ideal, wouldn't it?

12:19.400 --> 12:22.520
Not have something that's dynamically generated and all of that.

12:22.520 --> 12:26.280
We have plugins to do all that, but to make it static.

12:26.280 --> 12:31.540
But you get my drift, like I think it's a function of you have to be in this marketplace,

12:31.540 --> 12:36.240
you have to be a player on the web, you have to have a web presence, your app has to have

12:36.240 --> 12:39.360
a website, you know, everything has to have a dot com, every vulnerability has to have

12:39.360 --> 12:44.640
a brand name and it all has to be on, but that's not people's core competency.

12:44.640 --> 12:49.100
So they're forced to use these systems that are super heavy.

12:49.100 --> 12:50.760
It's not just Google Analytics though, right?

12:50.760 --> 12:54.680
Like Google Analytics is less horrible than a lot of the things.

12:54.680 --> 12:59.440
So what's happening is people are using Google Analytics and like five other ad tracking

12:59.440 --> 13:00.940
platforms.

13:00.940 --> 13:06.960
So it's the cumulative effect, particularly on mobile where basically Safari or onboard

13:06.960 --> 13:08.960
Chrome is choking itself to death.

13:08.960 --> 13:09.960
That makes sense.

13:09.960 --> 13:10.960
All right.

13:10.960 --> 13:14.440
Well, I wanted to pick your brain on that just a little bit because if to me, every

13:14.440 --> 13:19.600
time AMP stuff comes up, I guess I feel like it's one of those things that's just sort

13:19.600 --> 13:25.560
of slowly happening and there hasn't been a lot of discussion about if we're okay with

13:25.560 --> 13:27.920
that because it represents a ton of control for Google.

13:27.920 --> 13:30.720
Well, you know, proprietorization of the web, right?

13:30.720 --> 13:31.720
Yes.

13:31.720 --> 13:32.720
Yes.

13:32.720 --> 13:33.720
Yeah.

13:33.720 --> 13:34.720
And re-hosting.

13:34.720 --> 13:35.720
Yeah.

13:35.720 --> 13:36.720
So I don't know.

13:36.720 --> 13:40.080
I guess it just seems like whenever it's in the news, I feel like, well, why don't we

13:40.080 --> 13:41.080
talk about it for a moment?

13:41.080 --> 13:43.160
Let's remind ourselves what we're doing here.

13:43.160 --> 13:46.480
Speaking of reminding ourselves, I'd like to remind you about Linux Academy.

13:46.480 --> 13:48.840
This could be a great opportunity for your continuing education.

13:48.840 --> 13:52.920
You know, the thing is the IT industry moves at a breakneck pace.

13:52.920 --> 13:58.680
And I think we all kind of acknowledge that when we got into the IT industry, but how

13:58.680 --> 14:02.260
do you actually do your due diligence and stay relevant in an industry that changes

14:02.260 --> 14:03.260
that often?

14:03.260 --> 14:08.240
How do you stay current because maybe what you learned 5, 10, 15 years ago isn't directly

14:08.240 --> 14:13.220
applicable these days to deploying a Docker container or something like that.

14:13.220 --> 14:15.000
That's where Linux Academy can come in.

14:15.000 --> 14:18.160
Even if you've got what you need certification wise, you're in the career you want, if you

14:18.160 --> 14:20.960
just want to stay current, it's worth investing in yourself.

14:20.960 --> 14:25.240
So go to linuxacademy.com slash coders and sign up for a free seven day trial and try

14:25.240 --> 14:26.500
out the platform.

14:26.500 --> 14:30.600
They've got great tools if you are ready to go get those certifications and they have

14:30.600 --> 14:34.720
a hands-on lab, so if you're more of a visual learner, if you learn by doing, they've got

14:34.720 --> 14:35.960
great resources for you.

14:35.960 --> 14:38.760
You can spin up to six lab servers on demand.

14:38.760 --> 14:41.320
And something kind of neat they're doing just out there for the community, you don't even

14:41.320 --> 14:45.880
have to be a subscriber, is a couple of new things that I think are worth your time, worth

14:45.880 --> 14:49.760
checking out, including their new Google Cloud weekly show that's coming out on Wednesdays

14:49.760 --> 14:52.200
on the Linux Academy YouTube channel.

14:52.200 --> 14:56.000
So if Google Cloud is on your radar, it's something you're working on, they are posting

14:56.000 --> 14:57.480
a weekly update now.

14:57.480 --> 15:00.920
They're usually about five, I don't know, ten minutes, kind of depends on the topic.

15:00.920 --> 15:03.900
Last week it was about GPU acceleration on Google Cloud.

15:03.900 --> 15:10.080
There's also launch of a Docker study group, and that's going to be on YouTube as well.

15:10.080 --> 15:12.880
So it's probably time to go check out their YouTube channel if you want to be part of

15:12.880 --> 15:17.040
the Docker study group or if you want to get weekly updates on Google Cloud.

15:17.040 --> 15:21.160
Now that's all just free content, but if you go to linuxacademy.com slash coders, you can

15:21.160 --> 15:24.880
sign up for a free seven day trial and try out the entire platform, and they've just

15:24.880 --> 15:28.800
recently launched almost, I don't know if the official number is 200, but it's got to

15:28.800 --> 15:37.040
be near 200 types of hands-on training, content, things for Azure, AWS, Core Linux itself,

15:37.040 --> 15:39.780
Red Hat certifications, and DevOps as well.

15:39.780 --> 15:42.520
It's a ton of content they've just launched in the last few months.

15:42.520 --> 15:46.200
They're always adding and updating the old content so your membership constantly gets

15:46.200 --> 15:47.200
value.

15:47.200 --> 15:51.240
So go get started at linuxacademy.com slash coders, and don't forget about that new Docker

15:51.240 --> 15:56.480
study group and the new weekly Google Cloud show all over on the Linux Academy YouTube

15:56.480 --> 15:58.240
channel, linuxacademy.com.

15:58.240 --> 16:00.000
Just go to YouTube and search for Linux Academy.

16:00.000 --> 16:01.000
You'll find it.

16:01.000 --> 16:05.320
Linuxacademy.com slash coders, and a big thank you to Linux Academy for sponsoring the Coder

16:05.320 --> 16:09.520
Radio program, linuxacademy.com slash coders with an S.

16:09.520 --> 16:13.920
Okay, so let's get into your adventures with Qt.

16:13.920 --> 16:19.300
This has been pretty fun, and your last couple of episodes have covered some of the advantages

16:19.300 --> 16:21.560
about the cross-platform nature of it.

16:21.560 --> 16:26.280
QML, we talked a little bit about last week and why we both were pretty impressed by that.

16:26.280 --> 16:32.320
And now, it sounds like you've had a little time to play with Qt on Windows, which I compliment

16:32.320 --> 16:33.320
you.

16:33.320 --> 16:36.120
You know, we should try to represent the Windows portion of the audience from time to time

16:36.120 --> 16:38.680
because they're out there and they're a decent percentage.

16:38.680 --> 16:43.680
So I'm really curious to know how the adventures have gone on Windows and all of that lot.

16:43.680 --> 16:46.360
Yeah, uh-oh.

16:46.360 --> 16:57.360
So Windows, what can I say about Windows that, yeah, nothing nice to say here.

16:57.360 --> 17:05.160
So yeah, the code I was working with was my code and I was trying to add a dependency

17:05.160 --> 17:06.800
to something called ZMQ.

17:06.800 --> 17:12.720
Now, ZMQ is basically a way to transmit data over ports.

17:12.720 --> 17:19.200
Very common, used a lot in aerospace and embedded systems, things like that.

17:19.200 --> 17:23.720
So one of the requirements I have is this application must run on Windows.

17:23.720 --> 17:28.280
In fact, as of today, the primary platform.

17:28.280 --> 17:33.560
So I took my Qt project and I went to install ZMQ on Windows.

17:33.560 --> 17:37.440
You can look at the post on dominicam.com.

17:37.440 --> 17:40.800
It was a nightmare.

17:40.800 --> 17:45.120
It was unbelievably bad.

17:45.120 --> 17:51.880
So there's like a ZMQ MSI installer, which does not do what you think it does.

17:51.880 --> 17:55.840
And I ended up, and that's why we have a tool of the week, I ended up spending like three

17:55.840 --> 17:59.160
whole days trying to get this to work.

17:59.160 --> 18:03.220
Not understanding, like it would see the library, I'd add the DLL to the project, it would crash

18:03.220 --> 18:08.200
at launch with no output, which if you've ever done Windows devs, you know crash at

18:08.200 --> 18:12.440
launch with no output probably means something wrong with your DLLs.

18:12.440 --> 18:18.680
Then I ran a dependency, one of those dependency crawlers, and sure enough, it was a DLL and

18:18.680 --> 18:26.680
it's on, yeah, the error I was getting is the CBD, so CD debugger process terminated.

18:26.680 --> 18:30.880
It was hot garbage, the definition of dumpster fire.

18:30.880 --> 18:34.120
Now, do you need to be able to develop on Windows to run it on Windows?

18:34.120 --> 18:35.120
Is that a requirement?

18:35.120 --> 18:36.120
Yeah, you do.

18:36.120 --> 18:40.360
It doesn't allow cross compiling generally.

18:40.360 --> 18:49.560
So after about three days, I ended up finding this tool called VC package.

18:49.560 --> 18:53.200
It's a Microsoft tool, I linked to the GitHub in the show notes.

18:53.200 --> 18:59.200
What it basically is is a PowerShell tool that allows you to, it's basically a package

18:59.200 --> 19:00.640
manager, right?

19:00.640 --> 19:06.040
It's a package manager for C++ libraries and dependencies.

19:06.040 --> 19:08.880
You know, apt-get, right?

19:08.880 --> 19:13.960
Because the answer to this problem on Linux was sudo apt installs emq, emq dev.

19:13.960 --> 19:17.240
On Mac, brew brew installs emq.

19:17.240 --> 19:21.320
It really was unbelievably hard to get this running on Windows.

19:21.320 --> 19:27.320
And granted, I will give to our.NET and Windows developer listeners, I am not the super Windows

19:27.320 --> 19:28.320
guy, obviously.

19:28.320 --> 19:32.760
So maybe a more experienced.NET would have been like, of course I install VC package

19:32.760 --> 19:34.480
on every computer.

19:34.480 --> 19:37.000
The package manager should come with the computer.

19:37.000 --> 19:41.560
It is worth noting how enabling a package manager is in terms of just sitting down at

19:41.560 --> 19:47.200
a computer and getting to work, which is most advantageous when you're first setting up

19:47.200 --> 19:49.900
and not as advantageous once everything is set up.

19:49.900 --> 19:52.460
After everything is done, it's not really a big deal.

19:52.460 --> 19:57.100
But that first initial setup period, it makes a huge difference and it makes Windows feel

19:57.100 --> 20:00.120
like an ancient operating system.

20:00.120 --> 20:07.840
Yeah, like DLLs, we could have a whole show about why they're bad, right?

20:07.840 --> 20:15.160
I firmly believe today, after this whole experience, that POSIX-compliant systems are more correct.

20:15.160 --> 20:17.780
Things make more sense.

20:17.780 --> 20:23.840
It's just, I don't know, I mean, I know there's rumors about Microsoft making a Windows derivative

20:23.840 --> 20:27.640
or rather operating system derivative of Linux.

20:27.640 --> 20:35.120
Maybe that's probably only for Azure, but this is no way to live, right?

20:35.120 --> 20:38.720
This is true suffering.

20:38.720 --> 20:43.660
I haven't been this frustrated in probably six years during development.

20:43.660 --> 20:45.660
This was unbelievably bad.

20:45.660 --> 20:48.840
So you think this is one of those edge cases where Windows sort of falls down as a development

20:48.840 --> 20:50.240
platform and not that it couldn't be solved?

20:50.240 --> 20:52.720
Well, Qt could have also had its role for Windows.

20:52.720 --> 20:53.940
I just want to say that.

20:53.940 --> 20:59.280
The Windows support, like on Linux and Mac, it basically finds your dependencies for you.

20:59.280 --> 21:02.080
Now you could say, well, that's because Linux and Mac are POSIX and they just look under

21:02.080 --> 21:06.600
user include and user, whatever user bin, whatever it is.

21:06.600 --> 21:08.240
On Windows, it's a little more magical.

21:08.240 --> 21:12.400
For instance, you might link to a DLL and see program file 0mq, which was the right

21:12.400 --> 21:18.800
answer, which is idiotic as far as I'm concerned.

21:18.800 --> 21:19.880
I feel like I lost the thread.

21:19.880 --> 21:23.320
I'm just mad at Windows for sucking.

21:23.320 --> 21:29.000
How fortunate, before you go on, how fortunate is Apple that a community came together and

21:29.000 --> 21:30.680
created brew for them?

21:30.680 --> 21:32.600
That platform desperately needs it.

21:32.600 --> 21:34.760
Yeah, because Porus is terrible.

21:34.760 --> 21:38.800
I know when we did our Windows 10 experiment, what was it, more than a year ago?

21:38.800 --> 21:44.000
When we did our Windows 10 experiment, I ended up getting a new terminal to replace CMD and

21:44.000 --> 21:45.000
a package manager.

21:45.000 --> 21:46.000
I just had to.

21:46.000 --> 21:50.600
It's funny, I'm on Windows 10 right now for reasons that will become clear at the end

21:50.600 --> 21:58.360
of this show today, but it feels, in fact, I had a conversation before the show.

21:58.360 --> 22:04.280
It feels old, but not on the way of 1950s Flash Gordon, black and white shows, the old

22:04.280 --> 22:05.680
sci-fi show.

22:05.680 --> 22:09.640
It feels old like a typewriter, but not a cool hipster typewriter.

22:09.640 --> 22:15.920
No, what it is, I might be projecting, but what the sense is that I get is, it feels

22:15.920 --> 22:18.720
like you're struggling with solved problems.

22:18.720 --> 22:22.080
These are problems that are solved, why is this something, why is this the thing I'm

22:22.080 --> 22:23.080
wasting my time on?

22:23.080 --> 22:28.960
Why hasn't this platform made it easier for me to just get down and get to working?

22:28.960 --> 22:34.120
The setup procedure for this project on Mac or Linux is you run a batch script that I

22:34.120 --> 22:42.280
wrote called setup underscore Mac, setup underscore Linux, and lo and behold, you're done.

22:42.280 --> 22:45.120
In that script, the script is about four lines long.

22:45.120 --> 22:48.360
It's just a bunch of concatenated batch commands.

22:48.360 --> 22:52.580
Because it's like, and you have to drag and drop this, and you have to go into program

22:52.580 --> 22:54.800
files and your dependency might be there.

22:54.800 --> 22:56.640
Did you give up or were you successful?

22:56.640 --> 22:58.320
I succeeded at the end.

22:58.320 --> 22:59.320
Oh, good.

22:59.320 --> 23:00.960
But I was not a happy camper.

23:00.960 --> 23:04.280
Yeah, yeah, I saw some grousing on Twitter.

23:04.280 --> 23:05.280
I saw some grousing.

23:05.280 --> 23:08.360
Yeah, that's how I usually know something's going on.

23:08.360 --> 23:09.360
Mike's got a struggle.

23:09.360 --> 23:12.160
The struggle's real, and it's just like, you know what it is?

23:12.160 --> 23:18.080
I don't like Windows very much, so I'm just getting progressively angrier.

23:18.080 --> 23:19.080
Yeah.

23:19.080 --> 23:24.480
You go in with a bias towards, like, I get angrier faster with Windows.

23:24.480 --> 23:28.900
Because I have, I don't know, I've spent so many years fixing it in the past that I feel

23:28.900 --> 23:32.000
like my threshold for dealing with it is lower.

23:32.000 --> 23:35.880
Well, and I've also made like a conscious decision in the past to avoid these kind of

23:35.880 --> 23:41.080
problems by like not being a, you know, quote unquote, corporate Windows dev.

23:41.080 --> 23:48.040
And the fact that I was sort of pushed into this, yeah, I'm not, I don't even know.

23:48.040 --> 23:49.040
I don't even know what to tell you.

23:49.040 --> 23:53.280
I mean, of course all platforms are good, but some platforms are more good.

23:53.280 --> 23:54.280
Right.

23:54.280 --> 23:59.280
Yeah, that is an interesting thing when you, like, oh man, boy, do I know that feeling.

23:59.280 --> 24:02.840
When there's some work that you have to do that makes you use a tool that you wouldn't

24:02.840 --> 24:05.800
normally want to use, gosh, oh man.

24:05.800 --> 24:09.400
Yeah, it does make it much harder to deal with annoyances.

24:09.400 --> 24:11.880
And you have to just sort of sit there and be like, this isn't a big deal.

24:11.880 --> 24:12.880
Don't freak out.

24:12.880 --> 24:13.880
You'll get through this.

24:13.880 --> 24:18.240
Well, it's, it's an interesting deal though, as Microsoft tries to appeal to developers

24:18.240 --> 24:24.440
that like, you know, it doesn't take too many clicks or too many commands on the command

24:24.440 --> 24:29.760
proper PowerShell to end up in a box from, you know, Windows 95, right?

24:29.760 --> 24:37.040
It really, I don't, can we kind of just go for it?

24:37.040 --> 24:41.320
It seems like this giant, rich commercial company is innovating less than, oh, I don't

24:41.320 --> 24:48.240
know, Gnome or KDE or like Pop OS, right, Ubuntu.

24:48.240 --> 24:51.040
Even like we bitch and moan about the Mac.

24:51.040 --> 24:52.040
You know what?

24:52.040 --> 24:53.040
Whatever.

24:53.040 --> 24:55.140
The Mac is fine, right?

24:55.140 --> 25:01.440
It's a little annoying that they keep adding iOS features to it, but touch bar is garbage.

25:01.440 --> 25:04.400
But the Mac is not impeding getting work done in any way.

25:04.400 --> 25:05.400
Right.

25:05.400 --> 25:07.920
Especially the type of window you're doing.

25:07.920 --> 25:08.920
Right.

25:08.920 --> 25:11.840
So the question is like, is Windows more targeted at like the business, you know, I think that's

25:11.840 --> 25:12.840
the answer, right?

25:12.840 --> 25:17.760
It's, you know, computer information systems versus comp sci, but it makes me want to throw

25:17.760 --> 25:18.760
up.

25:18.760 --> 25:19.760
We can move on from here.

25:19.760 --> 25:22.460
No, I, I understand what you're saying.

25:22.460 --> 25:27.640
It's like, because I think the space you're interested in is the development space, the

25:27.640 --> 25:30.600
space where you want to get tools, you want to get to work.

25:30.600 --> 25:36.400
And there's a lot of niceties on the Mac side, like the app store where you can install good

25:36.400 --> 25:40.160
editors and things like that pretty quickly, which is not that Windows 10 doesn't have

25:40.160 --> 25:41.160
that.

25:41.160 --> 25:42.160
It's just not as strong.

25:42.160 --> 25:44.920
On Linux, of course, you have package managers, but on top of that, you have distributions

25:44.920 --> 25:49.680
like Pop OS and others that are trying to make it even simpler to just one click install

25:49.680 --> 25:51.360
an entire development environment.

25:51.360 --> 25:55.920
Like Ubuntu Mate, for example, has that software boutique when you first install it.

25:55.920 --> 25:57.680
It is, it's great.

25:57.680 --> 26:01.380
It's basically every major app you'd ever want for the Linux desktop.

26:01.380 --> 26:05.060
Some that are in the repo, some that are outside the repos, you know, and it just pulls them

26:05.060 --> 26:07.860
down for you and gets them set up for you.

26:07.860 --> 26:11.760
And it makes setting up on a Linux desktop, even for somebody who's been doing it since

26:11.760 --> 26:15.800
the nineties, it makes it a super quick, no pain situation.

26:15.800 --> 26:18.600
It's just really nice to get up and get working.

26:18.600 --> 26:22.560
And there's a lot they could do in Microsoft in Windows that they could do to kind of make

26:22.560 --> 26:23.560
that process easier.

26:23.560 --> 26:25.360
I mean, hell really, they have the money.

26:25.360 --> 26:28.960
Why not make an official Windows package manager that is something that's in the community?

26:28.960 --> 26:32.640
I think there is something in the works for that, but there's so many little areas where

26:32.640 --> 26:35.280
they could round, they could round off the rough edges, I guess.

26:35.280 --> 26:36.280
Yeah.

26:36.280 --> 26:37.280
I don't even know.

26:37.280 --> 26:38.280
Right.

26:38.280 --> 26:41.320
Cause it's more to how people package for them as well.

26:41.320 --> 26:44.560
Part of it is how the projects package, how people package and the fact that you would

26:44.560 --> 26:49.320
link to a DLL and C program files seems crazy, right?

26:49.320 --> 26:52.760
The fact that there's like windows was not envisioned as a development environment, I

26:52.760 --> 26:56.040
guess, where Unix obviously was right.

26:56.040 --> 26:59.440
That was the point of using Unix to cover everything, right?

26:59.440 --> 27:02.560
Mac, BSD, Linux.

27:02.560 --> 27:04.200
That feels weirdly fragile, right?

27:04.200 --> 27:08.000
The fact that, you know what it is, this is exactly what it is.

27:08.000 --> 27:11.520
Once you do something on Mac or Linux, cause it's all Unix underneath, you can write a

27:11.520 --> 27:16.600
script, you can have a switch to detect if you're a Mac or Linux, those are minor differences.

27:16.600 --> 27:18.760
And then that spash script is gospel.

27:18.760 --> 27:24.480
On Windows, they're getting there with PowerShell, but it's not as standard and you have all

27:24.480 --> 27:26.480
kinds of crazy dependency problems.

27:26.480 --> 27:27.480
Yeah.

27:27.480 --> 27:33.560
I don't know, the whole DLL thing seems like it's weird and this is where my Mac guide

27:33.560 --> 27:36.280
bias might come in from the past.

27:36.280 --> 27:39.480
Dynamic linking I think is super bad.

27:39.480 --> 27:44.160
Like if you remember Chris from the olden days or not that olden days, Mac apps generally

27:44.160 --> 27:45.400
don't dynamically link.

27:45.400 --> 27:46.400
Yeah, they bundle.

27:46.400 --> 27:47.400
Statically link.

27:47.400 --> 27:48.400
They bundle.

27:48.400 --> 27:49.880
Basically they static link everything.

27:49.880 --> 27:54.400
And that saves the user and the developer, okay, well if you don't have this, I need

27:54.400 --> 28:01.000
a catch to tell you to go install Visual Studio C++, you know, 2012 of, right?

28:01.000 --> 28:04.120
And yeah, your binaries are a little fatter, but.

28:04.120 --> 28:06.600
There's some security ramifications as well.

28:06.600 --> 28:07.600
Because now you're after the developer.

28:07.600 --> 28:09.400
Well, no, dynamic is worse.

28:09.400 --> 28:12.760
Well, the developer, if you intentionally infect your statics, right?

28:12.760 --> 28:14.680
If you intentionally infect your libraries.

28:14.680 --> 28:18.760
Or if you just basically, you know, you ship an old open SSL and it has a vulnerability

28:18.760 --> 28:23.240
and then your app's still using that and say it's not like checking the cert of an HTTPS

28:23.240 --> 28:24.240
server.

28:24.240 --> 28:26.520
There have been some capabilities in the past where applications are still shipping those

28:26.520 --> 28:29.120
old libraries when the system libraries have been updated.

28:29.120 --> 28:31.380
But that's a, you know, that's an argument since the 80s.

28:31.380 --> 28:33.120
So I digress.

28:33.120 --> 28:36.560
Dynamic linking has the issue of, and we'll get into this later with licensing, where

28:36.560 --> 28:41.640
if somebody ships a fraudulent version of a library that you might depend on and the

28:41.640 --> 28:45.840
user mistakenly installs it, your app thinks that's the correct version of the library.

28:45.840 --> 28:50.000
And now maybe all your HTTP traffic is being sniffed or.

28:50.000 --> 28:51.000
Fair enough.

28:51.000 --> 28:52.000
Yeah.

28:52.000 --> 28:53.000
Yeah, that's true.

28:53.000 --> 28:56.200
So speaking of dynamic linking, we're going to get to that later on, but to close your

28:56.200 --> 29:02.840
thoughts out, I think actually to respond to your thoughts, I think you may have nailed

29:02.840 --> 29:03.840
it.

29:03.840 --> 29:09.600
Windows itself wasn't initially conceived as so much as a development platform as an

29:09.600 --> 29:11.960
application delivery platform.

29:11.960 --> 29:16.100
And I know that sounds funny because Microsoft's been pretty good at building developer tools

29:16.100 --> 29:18.000
and developer relations over the years.

29:18.000 --> 29:22.200
But I think when you look at Windows itself, it was meant to be an end user desktop experience

29:22.200 --> 29:23.200
first.

29:23.200 --> 29:24.600
I mean, what would be the right intention?

29:24.600 --> 29:28.280
And that's also why I've never felt like it was a great note as a server.

29:28.280 --> 29:33.240
Like it just seemed a little off tone to me retrofitting something to be something else

29:33.240 --> 29:36.640
instead of using something that was built from the ground up to be that thing.

29:36.640 --> 29:40.840
So I think that's maybe some of the friction you're coming up with, as well as you're dealing

29:40.840 --> 29:45.900
with perhaps an open source project that while is probably the largest, has our largest install

29:45.900 --> 29:50.400
based on Windows, may not necessarily be a Windows first organization.

29:50.400 --> 29:53.560
And that's being reflected in how they care about their packaging, I think.

29:53.560 --> 29:55.320
But anyways, I think we have more to get into.

29:55.320 --> 29:58.760
So I'll take a moment right here and thank DigitalOcean for sponsoring the CoderRadio

29:58.760 --> 29:59.760
program.

29:59.760 --> 30:01.600
Go to do.co slash coder.

30:01.600 --> 30:08.080
No S on that one, do.co slash coder and get a $100 credit for 60 days when you sign up

30:08.080 --> 30:09.080
with a new account.

30:09.080 --> 30:15.960
Now DigitalOcean is a simple, scalable compute platform with industry leading price to performance.

30:15.960 --> 30:20.520
Everything has enterprise grade SSDs, predictable costs and billing, 40 gigabit connections

30:20.520 --> 30:24.560
coming into the hypervisors, data centers all over the world.

30:24.560 --> 30:29.760
And early in the year, DigitalOcean launched a new flexible droplet plan for $15 a month,

30:29.760 --> 30:31.160
which I think this is such a great deal.

30:31.160 --> 30:32.920
This is the best deal, I think, really.

30:32.920 --> 30:36.840
You can mix and match resources the most appropriate for your application.

30:36.840 --> 30:41.760
The one that I go to, my go to test server, three cents an hour, four gigs of RAM, two

30:41.760 --> 30:46.840
CPUs, an 80 gigabyte SSD, three terabytes of transfer, all for three cents an hour.

30:46.840 --> 30:50.240
Then DigitalOcean manages it all with an industry leading dashboard.

30:50.240 --> 30:52.600
It's super easy to use, but very powerful.

30:52.600 --> 30:57.200
A great API that's well documented, lots of lots and lots of applications built around

30:57.200 --> 30:58.200
it.

30:58.200 --> 31:03.280
99.99% uptime SLA, cloud firewalls that block traffic at the network level so they never

31:03.280 --> 31:09.860
even touch your droplet, baked in monitoring, alerting, perfect DNS management, and one

31:09.860 --> 31:12.440
of the best team tools I've ever used.

31:12.440 --> 31:16.600
The thing I love about DigitalOcean is it makes it easy to get up and going quick.

31:16.600 --> 31:20.880
You go from idea to actual production in minutes, which is sometimes the difference between

31:20.880 --> 31:24.800
having an idea and executing and having an idea and never doing it.

31:24.800 --> 31:26.680
It's made a huge difference for us.

31:26.680 --> 31:28.280
Do.co slash coder.

31:28.280 --> 31:33.760
Go there, try it out, no S, get a $100 credit, and kick the tires for 60 days.

31:33.760 --> 31:38.560
You'll really, I mean, with $100 credit, you could really turn that thing up if you want.

31:38.560 --> 31:43.680
They have some super powerful systems with hundreds of gigs of RAM.

31:43.680 --> 31:52.120
I believe last time I checked, it was like, yeah, 196 gigs of RAM, 32 CPU cores, 3.8 terabytes

31:52.120 --> 31:53.120
of disk.

31:53.120 --> 31:59.400
So if you want to use that $100 credit, go for it, do something awesome, do.co slash

31:59.400 --> 32:00.400
coder.

32:00.400 --> 32:05.640
Big thanks to DigitalOcean for sponsoring the Coder Radio program, do.co slash coder.

32:05.640 --> 32:11.160
Mr. Dominic, this cute conversation has got me wondering about one of the big bits of

32:11.160 --> 32:19.360
feedback we've seen, and that is the questions about Qt's legal terms around licensing.

32:19.360 --> 32:23.600
Maybe that's the way to put it, because I'll tell you what, I thought this was a no brainer.

32:23.600 --> 32:28.480
I thought this was a pretty simple, go get a subscription, good to go, you have no problem.

32:28.480 --> 32:33.220
And then I started looking into it and I am way more confused than I thought I would be

32:33.220 --> 32:40.320
after reading their own website, reading forums, reading Quora posts, I mean, Stagg Exchange,

32:40.320 --> 32:42.480
their FAQ, I read their entire FAQ.

32:42.480 --> 32:45.680
Have you run into this issue and is this a concern for you?

32:45.680 --> 32:51.960
Yeah, so the answer to this is from Freddie Mercury, I'm just a poor boy, nobody loves

32:51.960 --> 32:52.960
me.

32:52.960 --> 32:59.720
Meaning you want to use Qt, you want a proprietary app, you might be able to statically link

32:59.720 --> 33:06.280
if you never, ever, ever, ever do anything that would compromise you, but pony up some

33:06.280 --> 33:07.280
money.

33:07.280 --> 33:10.360
And by the way, that subscription is not a subscription.

33:10.360 --> 33:13.920
You have to pay that within 30 days, the total for the year.

33:13.920 --> 33:18.480
Oh, and it's good for one year and each developer has to have a license, right?

33:18.480 --> 33:23.840
It's per developer, any developer that touches the project, if you don't, you're automatically

33:23.840 --> 33:26.260
under the LGPL.

33:26.260 --> 33:32.200
So I had a brief conversation, a couple conversations actually with reps from Qt and the situation

33:32.200 --> 33:37.000
is interesting.

33:37.000 --> 33:43.000
So for our case, to have two developers on this project, it would be immediately over

33:43.000 --> 33:44.000
$11,000.

33:44.000 --> 33:45.520
No way.

33:45.520 --> 33:50.800
Which is just not, that dog don't hunt.

33:50.800 --> 33:55.520
And that's for the first year and then it renews at a much, much more forgiving rate.

33:55.520 --> 34:02.200
But the basic idea is that you can use the LGPL version, the open source version.

34:02.200 --> 34:10.480
You may not include Qt and you have to be very, very careful about what you do, including

34:10.480 --> 34:15.400
you have to share the.0 outputs of your compiled code, which I, for my use case, I think is

34:15.400 --> 34:17.440
not gonna be acceptable.

34:17.440 --> 34:25.640
It feels bad, I mean, Q Richard Stallman, but this is just not an acceptable outcome

34:25.640 --> 34:26.640
for, yeah.

34:26.640 --> 34:28.980
Negative in the freedom dimension.

34:28.980 --> 34:30.800
I mean, I get it, right?

34:30.800 --> 34:36.980
And oh, the other thing, and I heard from a birdie, in the future, more of their components

34:36.980 --> 34:43.760
are not going to even be LGPL, they're gonna be straight GPL unless you have a license.

34:43.760 --> 34:46.440
So those licenses are pretty handsomely priced.

34:46.440 --> 34:49.560
This is pretty disappointing.

34:49.560 --> 34:57.440
So you can ship it if you don't have an annual license, if you dynamically link.

34:57.440 --> 35:00.760
That is the first thing you need to do.

35:00.760 --> 35:06.880
You also need to include, and this is for me the killer, you need to include the.0

35:06.880 --> 35:11.640
output of your compiled code and you need to refer back to Q and you have to have all

35:11.640 --> 35:16.300
the proper disclosures, the normal stuff that you would have to do for a BSD or an MIT license.

35:16.300 --> 35:18.160
And how big of a compromise is that?

35:18.160 --> 35:21.600
Not the dynamically linked part, like take that out, but how big of a compromise is the

35:21.600 --> 35:23.720
rest for you?

35:23.720 --> 35:27.800
The.0 thing is probably unacceptable because there's, you know, I'm working right now in

35:27.800 --> 35:28.800
the aerospace space.

35:28.800 --> 35:32.280
I know that's a terrible way to phrase that.

35:32.280 --> 35:36.700
And decompilers are a thing that exist, right?

35:36.700 --> 35:40.080
And I'm not gonna use any weird obfuscation tool or anything like that.

35:40.080 --> 35:48.360
So while I definitely like it as a development platform, I'm probably going to talk about

35:48.360 --> 35:51.600
it a little more in future episodes.

35:51.600 --> 35:58.960
I can't imagine, you know, a JB or a Madbot or a size company being able to pay this.

35:58.960 --> 36:03.120
I mean, without serious compromises.

36:03.120 --> 36:10.400
Yeah, now to be fair, to be fair, they have a startup licensing plan, but your company

36:10.400 --> 36:17.040
has to end revenue, not profit, but revenue has to make less than $100,000 a year.

36:17.040 --> 36:20.800
And you have to document that.

36:20.800 --> 36:26.560
So to me, that's just not, I mean, we make, you know, more than that.

36:26.560 --> 36:29.600
And I think the hype train just got super derailed here.

36:29.600 --> 36:30.600
I feel a little.

36:30.600 --> 36:31.600
Yeah, I was disappointed.

36:31.600 --> 36:35.960
In fact, it's funny because I wrote these show notes and then I had the final meeting

36:35.960 --> 36:42.320
and it was one of the briefest meetings I've ever had because I said, well, if that's,

36:42.320 --> 36:48.760
you know, if that's just the way it is, if you can't work with me, then we can't afford

36:48.760 --> 36:49.760
it.

36:49.760 --> 36:51.600
I mean, unfortunately that's what it comes down to, right?

36:51.600 --> 37:00.520
We can't drop $11,000 on software licensing when we could use.NET for free.

37:00.520 --> 37:02.000
Mm hmm.

37:02.000 --> 37:04.800
Which is why I'm on a Windows 10 machine right now.

37:04.800 --> 37:05.800
Oh, okay.

37:05.800 --> 37:06.800
There it is.

37:06.800 --> 37:07.800
Yeah.

37:07.800 --> 37:15.640
So it's, it's really, I get why they're doing it and the answer is, well, you know, small

37:15.640 --> 37:19.560
little shops like the Matabot are just not their target customer.

37:19.560 --> 37:20.720
I think that's it.

37:20.720 --> 37:25.520
They're looking at people that are building products for devices and you know, multi-platform

37:25.520 --> 37:30.320
projects that are big projects, they probably figure a couple thousand dollars per dev is

37:30.320 --> 37:33.200
no big deal and it wouldn't be for a large company.

37:33.200 --> 37:35.880
It'd be, that'd be standard operating procedure.

37:35.880 --> 37:36.880
Yeah.

37:36.880 --> 37:43.200
Well, it's unfortunately for some, I mean, I'm very surprised they don't have like a

37:43.200 --> 37:44.440
small business plan.

37:44.440 --> 37:49.200
A lot of companies I've dealt with that do have these kinds of schemes, I mean, pricing

37:49.200 --> 37:52.060
schemes, not in a negative connotation.

37:52.060 --> 37:57.520
When you tell them, hey man, we're like a five person company, they say, oh, well, let

37:57.520 --> 38:00.880
me call my manager, you know, they put you on hold, they fake it for two minutes and

38:00.880 --> 38:04.960
then they come back and say, well, here's what we can do for, you know, somebody of

38:04.960 --> 38:06.520
your size.

38:06.520 --> 38:08.480
That was not the case.

38:08.480 --> 38:09.480
Yeah.

38:09.480 --> 38:10.480
Yeah.

38:10.480 --> 38:11.480
That would have been really bad.

38:11.480 --> 38:12.480
Sorry, buddy.

38:12.480 --> 38:13.480
The price is the price.

38:13.480 --> 38:14.480
Yeah.

38:14.480 --> 38:15.480
That would have been great.

38:15.480 --> 38:19.080
You, you know, that's, that's kind of bad in a way because I'd like to see them be hungry.

38:19.080 --> 38:22.040
I'd like to see them want to hustle a little bit because I'd really like to see this.

38:22.040 --> 38:26.080
I'd really like to see everything they're working on take off in a big way.

38:26.080 --> 38:30.840
It's also bad for your and I's dream of like Linux as a default development platform for

38:30.840 --> 38:32.000
a lot of people.

38:32.000 --> 38:33.000
For commercial applications.

38:33.000 --> 38:34.000
Yeah.

38:34.000 --> 38:36.720
For commercial applications that are a GUI based, right?

38:36.720 --> 38:37.720
That aren't Electro.

38:37.720 --> 38:43.800
Because, well, I mean, I have been painstakingly trying to find a development platform for

38:43.800 --> 38:44.800
this project.

38:44.800 --> 38:45.800
Yeah, I know.

38:45.800 --> 38:49.960
And Qt was perfect, but we just, we just can't do it.

38:49.960 --> 38:58.240
So that means I have no option but to do it on, uh, on windows because that's the platform

38:58.240 --> 38:59.720
you have to deliver for.

38:59.720 --> 39:02.480
We were required, right?

39:02.480 --> 39:06.180
Man, we're, we're, yeah, we're bound.

39:06.180 --> 39:10.340
How often do you suppose some version of this, maybe it's not cute, but you know, some version

39:10.340 --> 39:12.680
of this happens more often than not.

39:12.680 --> 39:17.000
And that's what blocks cross-platform applications is something like this, the tool you need,

39:17.000 --> 39:19.920
you can't use or, I mean, it's just so disappointing.

39:19.920 --> 39:25.560
And I really would, I would love to just see this problem shift because I'm no longer a,

39:25.560 --> 39:27.400
you know, I'm no longer this big advocate that I used to be.

39:27.400 --> 39:29.320
I'm now just a, I used to have a term for it.

39:29.320 --> 39:31.280
Like I used to be an evangelist and now I'm an advocate.

39:31.280 --> 39:32.280
So that's the way I should put it.

39:32.280 --> 39:35.120
I'm no longer a big evangelist for it, but I am still quite the advocate for the Linux

39:35.120 --> 39:39.920
desktop because it's really, there is a piece to it.

39:39.920 --> 39:46.280
When you switch to a stable platform that just works for you and is reliable and doesn't

39:46.280 --> 39:50.800
have a bunch of weird commercial interests dragging it around by the nose, there is a

39:50.800 --> 39:51.800
peacefulness that you have.

39:51.800 --> 39:54.880
Like there's like this confidence in your tool set.

39:54.880 --> 39:59.700
And I want to like spread the good word to people, be like, your entire computer can

39:59.700 --> 40:00.700
be empowering.

40:00.700 --> 40:04.760
You know, you don't have to feel like you're making compromises, but if the applications

40:04.760 --> 40:08.040
aren't there, it's, you know, people are just going to laugh me off.

40:08.040 --> 40:12.760
And you know, you have developers like yourself that are willing to invest time and money

40:12.760 --> 40:16.920
and development efforts into targeting the Linux desktop.

40:16.920 --> 40:20.560
And I'm a, I'm a long time Linux user who would have no qualms about paying for commercial

40:20.560 --> 40:25.080
software, but people just, you know, different things keep coming up that prevent it from

40:25.080 --> 40:26.080
ever happening.

40:26.080 --> 40:30.960
And that's one of the things that locks in the applications on windows and Mac and you

40:30.960 --> 40:34.160
know, predominantly windows because you've got such the install base there.

40:34.160 --> 40:35.160
Wow.

40:35.160 --> 40:36.160
That's really too bad.

40:36.160 --> 40:37.160
That's too.

40:37.160 --> 40:43.480
What kind of project would you still consider using Qt for in the future?

40:43.480 --> 40:47.360
I hate making future predictions cause I'm often wrong as the subreddit will be quick

40:47.360 --> 40:48.360
to tell you.

40:48.360 --> 40:56.680
Um, you know, honestly I hope that Qt company, which is actually their legal name, realizes

40:56.680 --> 41:02.280
that there are a lot of small software development companies out there that could also be there.

41:02.280 --> 41:04.320
Like I have no objection to paying a license fee.

41:04.320 --> 41:08.600
I'm just, we're just not structured in a way that we can pay that much.

41:08.600 --> 41:09.600
Right.

41:09.600 --> 41:14.080
Let's say you were creating, you know, a Jupiter broadcasting soundboard app that was going

41:14.080 --> 41:15.640
to be GPL anyways.

41:15.640 --> 41:16.800
Oh sure.

41:16.800 --> 41:17.800
If it was already, right.

41:17.800 --> 41:23.120
If, if, if the model for a piece of software was that it was like open source, then yeah,

41:23.120 --> 41:24.120
obviously I wouldn't care.

41:24.120 --> 41:27.680
I would just GPL everything.

41:27.680 --> 41:31.520
It's really when you want to go commercial, but you don't have enough funding to buy the

41:31.520 --> 41:32.520
annual.

41:32.520 --> 41:33.520
And that's every year too.

41:33.520 --> 41:38.320
So if this app continues to produce, but you haven't significantly update, the subscription

41:38.320 --> 41:41.480
update is less than the initial purchase.

41:41.480 --> 41:46.280
But you know, even if you have the money, I mean, I don't, I don't know about you, Chris,

41:46.280 --> 41:47.640
but an $11,000 check is a check.

41:47.640 --> 41:55.120
I would think twice about writing or 20 times before I wrote it.

41:55.120 --> 41:59.200
It seems, I don't know.

41:59.200 --> 42:00.200
Obviously they're doing it though.

42:00.200 --> 42:01.200
Right.

42:01.200 --> 42:02.200
A bunch of the Tesla stuff is written in Q.

42:02.200 --> 42:06.400
So I think it really is as simple as they're targeting bigger enterprises that just like

42:06.400 --> 42:07.400
this is a bar tab.

42:07.400 --> 42:08.400
Yeah.

42:08.400 --> 42:12.280
And it might be a way to weed out, uh, support costs, undo burden and support.

42:12.280 --> 42:16.400
You know, if the riff raff can't afford us, then we don't have to waste our support time.

42:16.400 --> 42:19.360
You know, you just, uh, make sure that you could do like a startup tier.

42:19.360 --> 42:20.360
I've seen like this.

42:20.360 --> 42:21.360
I completely agree.

42:21.360 --> 42:22.360
Yeah.

42:22.360 --> 42:25.160
Where, where it was a startup tier where, listen, I understand you don't have a lot

42:25.160 --> 42:26.160
of cash.

42:26.160 --> 42:29.920
You can pay us every quarter and you get like very, you get limited support.

42:29.920 --> 42:31.920
You get two tickets a quarter or something.

42:31.920 --> 42:32.920
Yeah.

42:32.920 --> 42:36.880
I mean, not to go on about this, but that is why I'm a little disappointed is I would

42:36.880 --> 42:39.880
love to see the cute company being competitive in that way.

42:39.880 --> 42:43.520
Cause there is an obvious gap in the market right now, especially for something that's

42:43.520 --> 42:44.920
independent right now.

42:44.920 --> 42:47.600
Uh, and they could really be aggressive and they could go after that.

42:47.600 --> 42:49.920
And it seems like an obvious choice they're making not to.

42:49.920 --> 42:53.080
And that's why I'm a little, I'm a little, you know, who rum about it because it seems

42:53.080 --> 42:57.320
like, oh damn, I was, I was kind of hoping they were going to be more competitive, but

42:57.320 --> 42:58.320
I was loving it.

42:58.320 --> 43:01.520
I mean, I have to say, I have not enjoyed programming as much as I have writing the

43:01.520 --> 43:07.120
C plus plus for the, uh, for the little cute prototype I was doing in this project.

43:07.120 --> 43:08.120
Really?

43:08.120 --> 43:09.120
Yeah.

43:09.120 --> 43:10.120
Yeah.

43:10.120 --> 43:11.120
Yes.

43:11.120 --> 43:12.120
Crazy past Mike.

43:12.120 --> 43:13.120
Yes.

43:13.120 --> 43:14.120
No, I'm not.

43:14.120 --> 43:15.120
I'm seriously, I have not like, you know what I visual studio windows.

43:15.120 --> 43:17.760
I mean, I'm going to lose my lunch, right?

43:17.760 --> 43:22.080
Like it's just in my lunch was sushi, so it's going to be bad.

43:22.080 --> 43:23.080
I loved it.

43:23.080 --> 43:24.940
I w I was so into it.

43:24.940 --> 43:28.120
We were going to have cute episodes for months.

43:28.120 --> 43:34.960
And then it was basically, well, you know, we're in the wrong tax bracket, right?

43:34.960 --> 43:35.960
Like I don't know what to say.

43:35.960 --> 43:39.360
Well, why don't we, uh, why don't we end on some positive news?

43:39.360 --> 43:42.880
So, uh, Android nine came out this week.

43:42.880 --> 43:44.640
There's a couple of new nice features in there.

43:44.640 --> 43:45.640
That's nice and positive.

43:45.640 --> 43:46.640
I said positive.

43:46.640 --> 43:47.640
I know.

43:47.640 --> 43:48.640
Okay.

43:48.640 --> 43:49.640
All right.

43:49.640 --> 43:50.640
I'm trying.

43:50.640 --> 43:51.640
How many devices is it installed?

43:51.640 --> 43:52.640
Oh, you bastard.

43:52.640 --> 43:53.640
You always got to bring it down.

43:53.640 --> 43:54.640
Okay.

43:54.640 --> 43:55.640
How about this one?

43:55.640 --> 43:56.640
Here's some positive news.

43:56.640 --> 44:01.760
iOS 12 developer betas group FaceTime has been removed from iOS 12 and will ship later

44:01.760 --> 44:02.760
in the fall.

44:02.760 --> 44:03.760
Ah, yes.

44:03.760 --> 44:04.760
Apple.

44:04.760 --> 44:05.760
Yeah.

44:05.760 --> 44:06.920
That might be a good sign.

44:06.920 --> 44:07.920
You know what?

44:07.920 --> 44:11.960
Apple punting features and waiting for them to get developed could be a good sign that

44:11.960 --> 44:14.920
I wouldn't necessarily say that's bad that I need.

44:14.920 --> 44:16.380
They could do a little more of that.

44:16.380 --> 44:22.080
You know, ship some max, bake your software a little more, stay competitive because nobody

44:22.080 --> 44:23.160
else is doing it.

44:23.160 --> 44:25.080
Nobody else is staying competitive like that.

44:25.080 --> 44:28.520
So and Microsoft is, but obviously you've run into issues.

44:28.520 --> 44:30.760
Well, Mr. Dominic, I tried.

44:30.760 --> 44:31.760
I gave it a go.

44:31.760 --> 44:32.760
You know.

44:32.760 --> 44:33.760
You tried.

44:33.760 --> 44:34.760
You gave it a shot.

44:34.760 --> 44:35.760
You gave it an honest try.

44:35.760 --> 44:36.760
Here's something kind of positive.

44:36.760 --> 44:37.760
We have a little PSA.

44:37.760 --> 44:41.120
We will be doing a double coder next Monday to compensate for travel.

44:41.120 --> 44:44.400
And so if you would like to join us for a live stream, that'd be a good one.

44:44.400 --> 44:48.800
Go to jupiterbroadcasting.com slash calendar to get that converted to your local time zone.

44:48.800 --> 44:53.080
We usually start around 12 PM Pacific.

44:53.080 --> 44:58.520
I usually get the stream fired up around 1130 AM Pacific and get some music going at jbliv.tv

44:58.520 --> 45:01.000
and you can come hang out for a couple of double coders.

45:01.000 --> 45:05.560
They'll get released in the RSS feed around their regular time-ish, but we'll be recording

45:05.560 --> 45:07.040
both of them next week.

45:07.040 --> 45:08.040
There you go.

45:08.040 --> 45:09.040
There's a positive plug.

45:09.040 --> 45:10.040
You know, that feels good.

45:10.040 --> 45:11.040
I've never been more turned on in my life.

45:11.040 --> 45:12.040
I know.

45:12.040 --> 45:13.200
It is exciting, right?

45:13.200 --> 45:16.640
Every opportunity you and I get to link up and talk is always good.

45:16.640 --> 45:19.680
And next week we're talking about my new favorite dev platform, VB6.

45:19.680 --> 45:20.680
Yeah.

45:20.680 --> 45:21.680
Hey, everybody.

45:21.680 --> 45:24.800
Alright, why don't you tell people where they can get a little more Dominic M in their life,

45:24.800 --> 45:25.800
you know?

45:25.800 --> 45:26.800
Follow me at Dumanuco.

45:26.800 --> 45:30.160
And if you're an attorney who's an LGPL expert, I would love to hear from you.

45:30.160 --> 45:31.160
No kidding, right?

45:31.160 --> 45:32.160
That's part of it is.

45:32.160 --> 45:33.160
Yeah.

45:33.160 --> 45:34.360
Maybe somebody could give you some good advice there.

45:34.360 --> 45:38.160
If you've got thoughts on anything we've talked about today, you can leave us feedback coder.show

45:38.160 --> 45:45.440
slash contact and links to some of the things we talked about are at coder.show slash 322.

45:45.440 --> 45:46.520
I'm also on the Twitters.

45:46.520 --> 45:48.360
I'm at Chris LAS.

45:48.360 --> 45:52.960
The show is at coder.radio.show and the whole network is at Jupiter Signal.

45:52.960 --> 45:53.960
Hey, look at me.

45:53.960 --> 45:56.880
I can remember things that I've said a thousand times, everybody.

45:56.880 --> 45:59.540
And like I mentioned already, we have the calendar page where you can find out about

45:59.540 --> 46:03.040
our lifetimes and we've got the live stream, but I told you about all of that.

46:03.040 --> 46:06.840
So really the only thing I have left to say is thanks so much for joining us on this week's

46:06.840 --> 46:23.840
episode of the Coder Radio program and we will see you right back here next week.
