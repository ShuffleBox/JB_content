00:00.000 --> 00:15.760
This is KOTORadio, episode 419 for June 23rd, 2021.

00:15.760 --> 00:19.680
Hey good looking, welcome into Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show, taking a pragmatic look

00:19.680 --> 00:24.480
at the art and business of software development and the world of technology.

00:24.480 --> 00:26.480
This episode is brought to you by a Cloud Guru.

00:26.480 --> 00:31.520
A Cloud Guru has the Cloud Playground, Azure, AWS, and Google Cloud on their sandboxes and

00:31.520 --> 00:32.560
credit card.

00:32.560 --> 00:33.560
Not yours.

00:38.020 --> 00:43.920
My name is Chris, and battling technical issues so he can podcast, it's our host, Mr. Dominic.

00:43.920 --> 00:44.920
Hello Mike.

00:44.920 --> 00:45.920
Hello.

00:45.920 --> 00:48.040
Man, what a week, right?

00:48.040 --> 00:49.800
Like I'm losing my voice.

00:49.800 --> 00:50.800
You're fighting tech demons.

00:50.800 --> 00:51.800
Oh yeah.

00:51.800 --> 00:53.880
It's not even the half of it.

00:53.880 --> 00:57.560
It's just the last 15 minutes.

00:57.560 --> 00:58.720
This was like crazy.

00:58.720 --> 01:00.000
The M1 failed me.

01:00.000 --> 01:01.000
Yeah.

01:01.000 --> 01:06.400
So what started out as just a quick journey to install a program to capture audio from

01:06.400 --> 01:10.680
an audio device turned into you like booting into recovery environments?

01:10.680 --> 01:11.680
What happened?

01:11.680 --> 01:15.920
Well, first of all, I guess we have to do a little inside baseball for Mac here.

01:15.920 --> 01:24.320
After that, Piezo made by Rogameba, that was a tongue twister, requires a kernel extension

01:24.320 --> 01:28.920
to directly record audio because many, many things in Mac OS require kernel extensions

01:28.920 --> 01:32.020
that you might not think should.

01:32.020 --> 01:40.360
So that used to be just a matter of going into security preferences and enabling it.

01:40.360 --> 01:43.660
Now you have to reboot into a recovery mode, enable it there.

01:43.660 --> 01:48.760
It took a total of four reboots to get this working and it blew away my desktop settings

01:48.760 --> 01:51.720
of all my files organized and my background.

01:51.720 --> 01:52.720
No.

01:52.720 --> 01:53.720
Yep.

01:53.720 --> 01:58.720
God knows what's going to happen after the show when I decide to try to use any of the

01:58.720 --> 02:01.280
Linuxy, Unixy stuff in homebrew.

02:01.280 --> 02:06.160
You think it just reset the PRAM or whatever the hell they call it?

02:06.160 --> 02:07.600
It reset something.

02:07.600 --> 02:08.600
Wow.

02:08.600 --> 02:10.800
That sucks.

02:10.800 --> 02:16.000
Well, imagine a typical user who maybe doesn't even know what a kernel extension is, is trying

02:16.000 --> 02:19.200
to install this software and gets a prompt, hey, you got to reboot and go into a recovery

02:19.200 --> 02:20.760
environment.

02:20.760 --> 02:23.320
And then when you booted back up, it was blocked initially.

02:23.320 --> 02:24.320
It was blocked.

02:24.320 --> 02:25.320
Yeah.

02:25.320 --> 02:27.840
So, and it kept having to reboot to unblock it.

02:27.840 --> 02:28.840
It's just too much protection.

02:28.840 --> 02:30.640
They're turning it into an iPhone.

02:30.640 --> 02:32.080
Ooh, that's a bold statement.

02:32.080 --> 02:33.080
I think they are.

02:33.080 --> 02:37.720
Well, you know, Phil Schiller did say on the stand in the Epic trial that they consider

02:37.720 --> 02:44.360
the openness and I think security vulnerabilities on Mac OS to be unacceptable.

02:44.360 --> 02:48.640
Sounds like they're right on their way of solving it and working out Rogue Amoeba, which

02:48.640 --> 02:54.440
Rogue Amoeba is one of the best software creators on the desktop for any platform.

02:54.440 --> 02:58.120
I mean, they just make incredible software in the audio realm.

02:58.120 --> 02:59.280
I respect that a lot.

02:59.280 --> 03:03.160
And if I were ever going to have a Mac, I would have the Rogue Amoeba apps on there.

03:03.160 --> 03:04.160
They'd have to work.

03:04.160 --> 03:07.080
I'd have to go through all of that, I guess.

03:07.080 --> 03:08.560
What a pain in the neck.

03:08.560 --> 03:09.560
Wait a minute.

03:09.560 --> 03:13.480
Now my desktop background is just, hold on, real time update.

03:13.480 --> 03:16.000
It's just the color blue.

03:16.000 --> 03:20.360
Yet on the other workspace, it's the default, whatever, for whatever version of Mac, I think

03:20.360 --> 03:22.160
I'm on Mojave or something.

03:22.160 --> 03:24.780
Doesn't really generally manifest itself.

03:24.780 --> 03:28.880
But my previous experience with Mac OS when I was doing Hackintosh is it felt like a bit

03:28.880 --> 03:32.680
of a house of cards and you pull out one thing and a surprising amount of things just quit

03:32.680 --> 03:33.680
working.

03:33.680 --> 03:34.680
Yeah.

03:34.680 --> 03:38.440
And you're in a very specific, very defined environment and situation.

03:38.440 --> 03:39.960
Something's super not right here.

03:39.960 --> 03:42.280
Oh well, we can move on.

03:42.280 --> 03:43.840
You're going to have fun after the show.

03:43.840 --> 03:46.140
Yeah, this is wrong.

03:46.140 --> 03:49.960
Unrelated to this, you also picked yourself up a new Thaleo.

03:49.960 --> 03:54.760
I'm extremely jealous because I've been wanting one so bad, but I just can't get over the

03:54.760 --> 03:55.760
GPU prices right now.

03:55.760 --> 03:56.760
Yeah, the GPU prices are nuts.

03:56.760 --> 03:59.240
I didn't go super hard on the GPU.

03:59.240 --> 04:01.240
But yeah, I don't have it yet though.

04:01.240 --> 04:05.320
I guess production's taking a bit longer than I thought it would.

04:05.320 --> 04:08.360
So I will let you know once I have it.

04:08.360 --> 04:14.880
You're a unique individual in that I can ask, on average, when you buy a Thaleo, Mike, how

04:14.880 --> 04:16.720
often does it take to ship?

04:16.720 --> 04:19.880
Because I've never bought one and you've bought several.

04:19.880 --> 04:25.080
Well, that's true because I do those contests, it's always a Thaleo as a prize.

04:25.080 --> 04:26.720
Usually a couple of business days.

04:26.720 --> 04:29.320
Whoa, that's way faster than I expected.

04:29.320 --> 04:32.640
Yeah, I think it depends on what configs.

04:32.640 --> 04:35.920
I noticed that the lower end ones tend to ship faster.

04:35.920 --> 04:36.920
Oh, sure.

04:36.920 --> 04:38.560
Maybe they have the parts in stock already and stuff.

04:38.560 --> 04:39.560
Well, maybe.

04:39.560 --> 04:43.520
I also wonder if they don't like pre-configure a bunch of those because probably they're

04:43.520 --> 04:44.520
high seller.

04:44.520 --> 04:46.160
Yeah, and they're not a huge cost.

04:46.160 --> 04:49.840
Because I did go up to the 12 gig NVIDIA GPU in this one.

04:49.840 --> 04:53.080
I think when the GPU prices come back down, I'm going to be really tempted.

04:53.080 --> 04:54.080
We'll see.

04:54.080 --> 04:55.640
Yeah, well, I'll do my decibel readings on it.

04:55.640 --> 04:58.520
So that's how I am about the background noise.

04:58.520 --> 05:02.040
Yeah, I'll be really interested to know how that is, how that stacks up now.

05:02.040 --> 05:06.720
Well, I'm going to be out at System76 in August.

05:06.720 --> 05:07.720
I'm looking forward to that.

05:07.720 --> 05:11.400
I'm heading out to Denver and also Salt Lake City.

05:11.400 --> 05:16.920
We're going to do meetups at both locations, August 7th in Salt Lake City and August 20th

05:16.920 --> 05:17.920
in Denver.

05:17.920 --> 05:21.880
We'll have all the details at meetup.com slash Jupiter Broadcasting.

05:21.880 --> 05:26.440
And if you're interested in going to a Denver meetup or a Salt Lake City meetup, please

05:26.440 --> 05:27.600
do.

05:27.600 --> 05:32.240
And our friends at Linode are on board with this trip, and not only are they making the

05:32.240 --> 05:37.000
trip possible, but they're going to help us produce some exclusive content during the

05:37.000 --> 05:41.240
road trip that will feature team interviews, the people we go and see.

05:41.240 --> 05:46.420
I'm hoping to get a little bit of the inside story on the creation of the launch keyboard

05:46.420 --> 05:49.240
while we're there, and we'll have an episode on that as well.

05:49.240 --> 05:51.560
And I'll do a few coders live from the road.

05:51.560 --> 05:56.560
So if you're a Coder Radio audience member in those areas, or if you can make it there,

05:56.560 --> 05:57.560
come see us.

05:57.560 --> 06:03.320
Again, August 7th, Salt Lake City, August 20th in Denver, meetup.com slash Jupiter Broadcasting.

06:03.320 --> 06:04.840
I'm really looking forward to it.

06:04.840 --> 06:06.560
It's been a long time.

06:06.560 --> 06:08.800
And the last event I went to really stunk.

06:08.800 --> 06:12.680
It was like almost two years ago, and I regretted going to it while I was there.

06:12.680 --> 06:17.080
It gave me just this horrible, horrible feeling about the future of cybersecurity.

06:17.080 --> 06:18.560
And then that was it.

06:18.560 --> 06:22.200
Then it was lockdown time.

06:22.200 --> 06:24.320
So yeah, it's going to be great to see people.

06:24.320 --> 06:28.640
And I'm getting the RV ready right now, which is not in great shape because my slides broken

06:28.640 --> 06:29.640
and all that.

06:29.640 --> 06:32.940
But working on that at the moment to try to get it ready, and then we're going to load

06:32.940 --> 06:35.680
up and we're going to do a meetup in Denver.

06:35.680 --> 06:38.960
Of course, Mr. Dominic, you are welcome as well.

06:38.960 --> 06:39.960
Everybody's welcome.

06:39.960 --> 06:40.960
Everybody.

06:40.960 --> 06:43.960
I know not everybody can because everybody's got jobs and stuff they got to do, but we're

06:43.960 --> 06:46.440
opening it up to everybody who might be able to make it out.

06:46.440 --> 06:47.440
You know what?

06:47.440 --> 06:48.440
You know, I love System76.

06:48.440 --> 06:52.200
The problem is if I show up in Denver, do I have to bring an extra carry on for another

06:52.200 --> 06:55.320
staleo, a few launch keyboards under my shirt?

06:55.320 --> 06:56.320
Yeah.

06:56.320 --> 06:57.320
Yeah, I know.

06:57.320 --> 07:00.160
That's why I think some of us are going to drive so we can just load up our trunks, you

07:00.160 --> 07:01.160
know.

07:01.160 --> 07:02.160
I'm from Florida.

07:02.160 --> 07:04.000
I just can't even imagine how far that is.

07:04.000 --> 07:06.200
Yeah, I know, right?

07:06.200 --> 07:08.200
Hey, guess what I have right here?

07:08.200 --> 07:09.200
I have a box.

07:09.200 --> 07:10.200
What's in the box?

07:10.200 --> 07:11.200
Let's see.

07:11.200 --> 07:12.200
Stand by, sir.

07:12.200 --> 07:15.960
I'm going to open it up right now here on the show.

07:15.960 --> 07:16.960
It is.

07:16.960 --> 07:17.960
It's a big box, too.

07:17.960 --> 07:18.960
It's heavy.

07:18.960 --> 07:23.120
It's a big box filled with the Coder Robes.

07:23.120 --> 07:25.080
I got a whole batch of them right here.

07:25.080 --> 07:26.080
Yep.

07:26.080 --> 07:27.080
Oh, yeah.

07:27.080 --> 07:28.080
I got mine yesterday.

07:28.080 --> 07:29.080
Oh, did you?

07:29.080 --> 07:30.080
Yes.

07:30.080 --> 07:31.080
Yes, I did.

07:31.080 --> 07:32.080
I took it.

07:32.080 --> 07:33.080
I put a picture on Twitter.

07:33.080 --> 07:34.080
I didn't see it.

07:34.080 --> 07:35.080
I failed in my stocking.

07:35.080 --> 07:36.080
Oh, yeah.

07:36.080 --> 07:37.280
Yeah, yeah, yeah, man.

07:37.280 --> 07:38.680
Turned out great.

07:38.680 --> 07:39.680
Turned out great.

07:39.680 --> 07:40.680
Oh, look at that.

07:40.680 --> 07:41.680
I got a whole batch of them here.

07:41.680 --> 07:42.680
One's for Wes.

07:42.680 --> 07:43.680
Going to give him a Coder.

07:43.680 --> 07:46.880
So when you saw people were sending in their Coder Rope pictures.

07:46.880 --> 07:47.880
Yeah.

07:47.880 --> 07:48.880
Yeah, that's great.

07:48.880 --> 07:49.880
Yeah.

07:49.880 --> 07:50.880
People should keep doing that.

07:50.880 --> 07:51.880
They're not all done yet.

07:51.880 --> 07:55.680
So if you haven't got your Coder yet, there is probably going to be another several week

07:55.680 --> 07:56.680
delay.

07:56.680 --> 07:57.680
I apologize.

07:57.680 --> 08:00.360
But then the next batch and probably the final batch will ship.

08:00.360 --> 08:02.640
And it really is just down to supplies.

08:02.640 --> 08:05.280
We've had a lot of people ask us to do another run.

08:05.280 --> 08:08.880
I will consider it when the whole global supply shortage is over.

08:08.880 --> 08:10.360
You didn't have fun?

08:10.360 --> 08:11.360
Oh, my gosh.

08:11.360 --> 08:13.600
And the threat on this is particular, too.

08:13.600 --> 08:15.320
So it just took them forever.

08:15.320 --> 08:16.840
And so maybe in the fall.

08:16.840 --> 08:17.840
I don't know.

08:17.840 --> 08:19.400
But boy, did it turn out, huh?

08:19.400 --> 08:20.400
It's great.

08:20.400 --> 08:21.400
Woo-Wee.

08:21.400 --> 08:22.400
It really is.

08:22.400 --> 08:23.400
C-C-C-Coder.

08:23.400 --> 08:24.400
Yep.

08:24.400 --> 08:27.640
One size fits all, Tali with pockets.

08:27.640 --> 08:28.640
Classic.

08:28.640 --> 08:29.640
You can wear it.

08:29.640 --> 08:30.640
It's an all day wear.

08:30.640 --> 08:31.640
It's the Coder.

08:31.640 --> 08:32.640
I'm really happy with that.

08:32.640 --> 08:34.680
I'm very, very pleased.

08:34.680 --> 08:35.680
It was nice.

08:35.680 --> 08:36.680
It was nice to see that go out.

08:36.680 --> 08:37.680
God damn it.

08:37.680 --> 08:39.880
It blew away my Xcode tool chain, too.

08:39.880 --> 08:41.680
No way, man.

08:41.680 --> 08:42.680
How can this happen?

08:42.680 --> 08:44.520
All the command line tools are gone.

08:44.520 --> 08:45.520
It reset my terminal.

08:45.520 --> 08:46.520
What did it revert?

08:46.520 --> 08:48.600
Did it revert to some image?

08:48.600 --> 08:53.160
I think it reverted all the utility stuff to base settings.

08:53.160 --> 08:56.840
Yeah, I typed git and it's literally trying to install git.

08:56.840 --> 09:00.760
It's telling me to run Xcode select.

09:00.760 --> 09:04.080
It sounds like it reverted back to, because you know, the system partition stuff's read

09:04.080 --> 09:05.080
only.

09:05.080 --> 09:07.240
Sounds like it reverted back or something.

09:07.240 --> 09:09.440
So it just wiped out everything but user land?

09:09.440 --> 09:11.160
Yeah, sounds like it, doesn't it?

09:11.160 --> 09:12.160
Yeah, obviously.

09:12.160 --> 09:14.080
That explains the settings being weird, too.

09:14.080 --> 09:15.080
Wow.

09:15.080 --> 09:20.000
I deleted the directory under photos, under pictures with all my custom backgrounds.

09:20.000 --> 09:22.200
What the hell?

09:22.200 --> 09:23.520
And it's the same user account, right?

09:23.520 --> 09:25.560
Yeah, I only have one user account on this machine.

09:25.560 --> 09:29.280
You know what's not crazy and unreliable, though?

09:29.280 --> 09:30.280
What's that?

09:30.280 --> 09:31.280
The coder.

09:31.280 --> 09:32.280
Yeah, that's true.

09:32.280 --> 09:35.680
And finally, it's just slow.

09:35.680 --> 09:36.680
Just real slow.

09:36.680 --> 09:37.680
It's just slow.

09:37.680 --> 09:41.880
But a lot of people wrote in and said that the material is higher quality than they expected

09:41.880 --> 09:42.880
and it was worth the wait.

09:42.880 --> 09:44.800
And that's what I wanted to hear.

09:44.800 --> 09:48.600
Rick wants your reaction, maybe my reaction, too, to this.

09:48.600 --> 09:53.520
He writes in, he says, guys, Sir Tim Berners-Lee is launching an NFT for the original Objective-C

09:53.520 --> 09:56.120
source code he used to create the World Wide Web.

09:56.120 --> 09:59.400
I'd love to know your thoughts on this.

09:59.400 --> 10:00.520
What do you think?

10:00.520 --> 10:03.120
It's Objective-C. I love it.

10:03.120 --> 10:05.880
Honestly, if you had the money, would you buy it?

10:05.880 --> 10:06.880
Absolutely.

10:06.880 --> 10:07.880
Yeah, I think so.

10:07.880 --> 10:08.880
Yeah.

10:08.880 --> 10:09.880
I also hate this, by the way.

10:09.880 --> 10:10.880
I do hate this.

10:10.880 --> 10:11.880
I hate this deeply.

10:11.880 --> 10:12.880
I hate it.

10:12.880 --> 10:13.880
I hate it.

10:13.880 --> 10:14.880
I hate it.

10:14.880 --> 10:15.880
Yeah.

10:15.880 --> 10:20.720
But that said, like if Linus Torvalds wanted to make an NFT out of his original Linux commit

10:20.720 --> 10:21.720
or something.

10:21.720 --> 10:24.880
How about an NFT of him throwing in video with a finger?

10:24.880 --> 10:25.880
Yeah.

10:25.880 --> 10:26.880
I don't know.

10:26.880 --> 10:29.580
I think these, I'd actually just rather have a printed version with him with his signature

10:29.580 --> 10:32.840
on it than an NFT though.

10:32.840 --> 10:36.200
Knowing you would have to be on like a nice canvas made only of the finest.

10:36.200 --> 10:37.200
Right.

10:37.200 --> 10:40.360
That'd be great with a sapphire glass frame.

10:40.360 --> 10:43.200
Jeez, man.

10:43.200 --> 10:46.240
I just don't like where this is going.

10:46.240 --> 10:47.240
Where does it end?

10:47.240 --> 10:48.240
I wonder.

10:48.240 --> 10:51.000
And it's not like it's the only copy.

10:51.000 --> 10:54.440
I hear people that try to make the art analogy, but I have a hard time with it.

10:54.440 --> 10:59.140
And I'm not really Mr. Anti-Crypto coin and stuff.

10:59.140 --> 11:01.840
I think Bitcoin gets a bad rap.

11:01.840 --> 11:05.440
I think people that give Bitcoin a hard time for its environmental impact haven't done

11:05.440 --> 11:07.120
any research and don't know what they're talking about.

11:07.120 --> 11:10.360
And they couldn't tell you the environmental impact of everybody switching to electric

11:10.360 --> 11:11.920
cars and charging Teslas in their homes.

11:11.920 --> 11:14.760
And if that takes any more power than a Bitcoin, nobody knows.

11:14.760 --> 11:16.360
And so I think Bitcoin gets a hard rap.

11:16.360 --> 11:18.320
I'm not anti any of this kind of stuff.

11:18.320 --> 11:19.520
I think it's worth exploring.

11:19.520 --> 11:24.520
But something about this NFT stuff where you're selling something that you can make

11:24.520 --> 11:31.320
endless copies of doesn't feel like legitimate and fair to the purchaser.

11:31.320 --> 11:34.840
It's weird because you just described like the people who say they shouldn't have to

11:34.840 --> 11:35.840
pay for software.

11:35.840 --> 11:36.840
Right.

11:36.840 --> 11:40.160
Well, you just made their argument.

11:40.160 --> 11:41.160
It's true.

11:41.160 --> 11:46.480
Well, a topic that Jimmy wanted to write in on is touching on our Linux dying as a desktop

11:46.480 --> 11:47.480
OS conversation.

11:47.480 --> 11:51.880
He says, my dearest sexy coder host, as someone who's run Linux since the late 90s, this has

11:51.880 --> 11:54.940
been something on my mind for the last five years or so.

11:54.940 --> 11:58.880
It seems to me, even as much as Linux has caught up to the other big OSes in terms of

11:58.880 --> 12:03.480
functionality and applications, we're now back in the same place we were about 20 years

12:03.480 --> 12:04.480
ago.

12:04.480 --> 12:11.120
By this, I mean the mobile and their general ecosystems, even with really cool projects

12:11.120 --> 12:15.600
like KDE Connect and where KDE and GNOME are taking their desktops, we're still over a

12:15.600 --> 12:17.060
decade behind.

12:17.060 --> 12:20.260
We're not even playing the same game, let alone the ballpark.

12:20.260 --> 12:24.920
When you're in your 30s with kids, with things in your house like tablets, TVs and cars and

12:24.920 --> 12:29.360
lady tubes all connected and syncing, not even to mention an ever-growing connected

12:29.360 --> 12:34.020
outside world, well, Linux can sometimes feel like a bit of a hindrance, something that

12:34.020 --> 12:38.800
needs to be tweaked constantly to get some of the basic features I've mentioned even

12:38.800 --> 12:40.340
half working.

12:40.340 --> 12:43.120
Not only is that annoying, but then when you're busy and you just want things to work, it's

12:43.120 --> 12:44.280
going to be more of an issue.

12:44.280 --> 12:47.880
We also have the problem that more and more of us, as time goes on, will start to use

12:47.880 --> 12:52.320
our phones for payments, door access and even ID cards.

12:52.320 --> 12:54.000
Linux is out on all of that.

12:54.000 --> 12:57.720
Take that along with Windows now getting better for developers than ever, Apple doing their

12:57.720 --> 13:02.280
thing and automation with servers in the cloud, serverless and containerization.

13:02.280 --> 13:06.640
It's hard to see how Linux is going to stay relevant for most people going into the future.

13:06.640 --> 13:10.760
Only a niche few who are working on the core technology behind the scenes and being paid

13:10.760 --> 13:14.880
by large corporations, assuming fuchsia doesn't get too popular.

13:14.880 --> 13:21.200
It makes me sad to think about this, but another way to look at it is look how far this little

13:21.200 --> 13:26.380
free and open source community and project actually went.

13:26.380 --> 13:31.680
From a small nerdy project, often mocked for being only for hobbyists, to powering the

13:31.680 --> 13:36.160
entire internet and complete infrastructure of every large service billions of people

13:36.160 --> 13:37.160
rely on day-to-day.

13:37.160 --> 13:39.920
Hell, even Windows has it baked in now.

13:39.920 --> 13:44.160
Who would have imagined that in 2008 while tweaking their compass settings on Ubuntu

13:44.160 --> 13:45.520
Hardy Heron?

13:45.520 --> 13:48.800
Linux beat all others and ultimately won.

13:48.800 --> 13:53.480
So if the day comes in the next decade where I have to pour one out for my homie tux, I'll

13:53.480 --> 13:56.120
do it with a smile, fond and proud memories.

13:56.120 --> 13:59.840
I don't think you're ever going to be pouring one out for your homie tux though.

13:59.840 --> 14:00.840
I agree.

14:00.840 --> 14:05.760
I mean, you still have people that are listening to records.

14:05.760 --> 14:11.720
Like, I'm just saying some stuff never dies, but this is going to have, it's going to still,

14:11.720 --> 14:17.240
it will, I think probably for as long as you and I draw breath, there will be Linux servers.

14:17.240 --> 14:21.200
And as long as there are large amounts of Linux servers, won't there always be devs

14:21.200 --> 14:25.840
and sysadmins who want to use what they're running on the server on their desktop for

14:25.840 --> 14:27.440
what they're maybe building for the server?

14:27.440 --> 14:28.600
Yeah, I would go even further.

14:28.600 --> 14:33.080
I think it's going to be as long as you and I draw breath and our grandkids draw breath.

14:33.080 --> 14:36.260
Yeah, it's one of those entrenched forever kind of technologies.

14:36.260 --> 14:39.280
And because of the licensing, they can just perpetually keep it going.

14:39.280 --> 14:41.680
So it's going to be one of those things that just keeps on going.

14:41.680 --> 14:45.280
Like, you know, they stretch out commercial operating systems, you ain't seen nothing

14:45.280 --> 14:46.280
yet.

14:46.280 --> 14:47.920
They just keep rolling, baby.

14:47.920 --> 14:52.660
And talk about this often because it often is perceived as an elitist attitude.

14:52.660 --> 15:01.120
But I actually don't even agree with the premise that if only nerds like developers and sysadmins

15:01.120 --> 15:05.160
and geeks use Linux, I don't buy the premise that's a bad thing.

15:05.160 --> 15:10.840
I think the operating system is particularly good at catering to those particular niches.

15:10.840 --> 15:17.120
And why not build a system that just super delivers to that user base while the commercial

15:17.120 --> 15:20.240
platforms focus on the mythical new user constantly?

15:20.240 --> 15:24.280
I think it's actually a very reasonable place for desktop Linux to land.

15:24.280 --> 15:27.900
And that doesn't mean that it needs to have some cloud syncing service.

15:27.900 --> 15:31.960
It just means that it needs to work with whatever solution I, as a geek, build for myself.

15:31.960 --> 15:37.600
Yeah, I would even take it a step further that the mythical new user is probably going

15:37.600 --> 15:41.080
to increasingly be a tablet or more likely phone user.

15:41.080 --> 15:42.080
Yeah, or maybe Chromebook.

15:42.080 --> 15:43.080
But yeah.

15:43.080 --> 15:44.080
Yeah.

15:44.080 --> 15:48.200
And I know it's been an education, but then, you know, I've never been on the Chromebook

15:48.200 --> 15:49.200
train.

15:49.200 --> 15:50.200
Yep.

15:50.200 --> 15:51.200
Yep.

15:51.200 --> 15:52.200
All right.

15:52.200 --> 15:53.200
Yeah.

15:53.200 --> 15:54.200
All right.

15:54.200 --> 15:55.200
So one more on this topic, then we'll move on.

15:55.200 --> 15:56.200
Tim writes in with a bulletproof Linux recipe.

15:56.200 --> 16:00.040
I use an Intel NUC as my desktop and a Dell XPS as my laptop running for door.

16:00.040 --> 16:03.920
They both have integrated Intel graphics and nothing weird in them.

16:03.920 --> 16:05.880
And you know they're always going to work.

16:05.880 --> 16:07.720
For gaming, I have an Xbox.

16:07.720 --> 16:11.640
For my wife, who isn't really into computers, she uses an iPad.

16:11.640 --> 16:18.520
I used to be really big into Windows and PC gaming, but honestly, Windows 10 wore me down.

16:18.520 --> 16:22.800
Operating systems that make decisions for me on my behalf, that's just a little bit

16:22.800 --> 16:23.800
too much for me.

16:23.800 --> 16:25.360
And I'm never going to go back.

16:25.360 --> 16:29.720
Say what you will, but staying on the rails and just not doing anything out of the ordinary

16:29.720 --> 16:32.360
is all it really takes to use desktop Linux.

16:32.360 --> 16:36.240
Upgrade only when you have time and maintain an Ansible playbook to make it easy.

16:36.240 --> 16:37.800
I love that.

16:37.800 --> 16:40.600
Just all you got to do.

16:40.600 --> 16:41.600
Just learn Ansible.

16:41.600 --> 16:45.840
I said, but that's how you do survive and you won't be tempted to use an operating system

16:45.840 --> 16:50.440
that needs an internet connection to search for a list of locally installed applications.

16:50.440 --> 16:52.920
I kind of agree with Tim to a degree, though.

16:52.920 --> 16:59.000
If your workload allows and you kind of just use Linux on rails, like a System76 system

16:59.000 --> 17:04.860
or like my ThinkPad X1 Carbon that came with Fedora or the Dell XPS developer line, they

17:04.860 --> 17:07.520
are going to work every time you load Linux on that thing.

17:07.520 --> 17:10.560
And they work really, really reliably.

17:10.560 --> 17:16.400
But that is a large user base and it's a very viable customer base.

17:16.400 --> 17:19.840
But it also doesn't work for folks that maybe need to do machine learning and they have

17:19.840 --> 17:23.760
to push their video driver forward and their kernel driver forward or people that are doing

17:23.760 --> 17:24.760
media production.

17:24.760 --> 17:28.440
It also doesn't work for people that are doing development that targets upcoming Linux platforms

17:28.440 --> 17:31.040
like maybe the next version of RHEL.

17:31.040 --> 17:33.160
They can't really ride those rails.

17:33.160 --> 17:37.880
So there are use cases where you need to use Linux, but you can't necessarily use it on

17:37.880 --> 17:39.400
rails like Tim suggests.

17:39.400 --> 17:41.000
But he makes a good point, I thought.

17:41.000 --> 17:43.360
Are you suggesting the Mac-ification of Linux?

17:43.360 --> 17:44.360
In a way it is, right?

17:44.360 --> 17:48.480
I think the developer line, the XPS developer line feels the most like that, in my opinion.

17:48.480 --> 17:52.560
Well, and then some of the stuff you mentioned, System76, that's kind of their whole pitch,

17:52.560 --> 17:53.560
right?

17:53.560 --> 17:54.800
They made a big push, at least last year.

17:54.800 --> 18:00.320
Yeah, and I think with Pop in a way, they're kind of building that, but more oriented at

18:00.320 --> 18:01.320
power users.

18:01.320 --> 18:02.960
Because Pop doesn't feel like they're watering it down.

18:02.960 --> 18:05.800
They're doing tiling window manager and keyboard combinations.

18:05.800 --> 18:06.800
Right.

18:06.800 --> 18:08.280
With Pop, they assume you know what you're doing.

18:08.280 --> 18:15.600
With the current Mac OS, they break your machine when you try to record audio.

18:15.600 --> 18:17.120
Lino.com slash coder.

18:17.120 --> 18:21.500
Go there to get $100 in credit on your new account, and of course you support the show.

18:21.500 --> 18:25.240
It tells Linode, hey, thanks for making the Coder Radio program possible.

18:25.240 --> 18:27.880
Linode is the largest independent cloud computing provider.

18:27.880 --> 18:31.080
No matter what skill level you're at or what technology stack you prefer to use, they're

18:31.080 --> 18:33.220
going to help your ideas come to life on the web.

18:33.220 --> 18:35.040
And their boxes are screaming fast.

18:35.040 --> 18:38.480
A lot of times when people are trying them out for the first time and they send me feedback,

18:38.480 --> 18:39.900
that's number one.

18:39.900 --> 18:41.720
It's faster than I expected.

18:41.720 --> 18:43.740
Linode really knows what they're doing.

18:43.740 --> 18:45.840
They've built out a network of 11 data centers.

18:45.840 --> 18:47.880
They are their own ISP.

18:47.880 --> 18:52.040
They've done super fast native SSDs for each hypervisor, 40 gigabit connections coming

18:52.040 --> 18:56.540
into the machines, and then they wrap it all up with a beautiful, simple dashboard that

18:56.540 --> 19:00.040
doesn't get in your way, but lets you get access to the power features where it makes

19:00.040 --> 19:01.040
sense.

19:01.040 --> 19:02.860
I mean, you can even do your own custom images on Linode.

19:02.860 --> 19:06.020
So if you've got a stack that you want to build and then just deploy that image, they're

19:06.020 --> 19:07.280
going to accommodate that.

19:07.280 --> 19:09.200
They have S3 compatible object storage.

19:09.200 --> 19:14.380
And I point this out because you can do really economical front end Linodes that are using

19:14.380 --> 19:18.360
the S3 object storage as their back end file storage, and you don't have to sit there and

19:18.360 --> 19:20.880
worry about allocating the right storage to that Linode.

19:20.880 --> 19:22.600
It all just works.

19:22.600 --> 19:25.300
And then, of course, anything that's S3 compatible, you can use there.

19:25.300 --> 19:27.680
That includes even just mounting file systems.

19:27.680 --> 19:31.080
Linode also features things like cloud firewalls so you can protect your machines at the network

19:31.080 --> 19:33.960
level and prevent that traffic from banging on your door.

19:33.960 --> 19:38.840
And then when you just want to get started quick, Linode has those one click application

19:38.840 --> 19:39.840
deployments.

19:39.840 --> 19:43.200
I did that recently just for a quick Docker stack as a way to just get an application

19:43.200 --> 19:44.640
up and running and test it.

19:44.640 --> 19:48.560
I'm really grateful for that kind of stuff because if you're working with that tooling,

19:48.560 --> 19:52.840
you get a Linode deployed in like, I don't know, 25 seconds.

19:52.840 --> 19:55.480
It's just really just so quick.

19:55.480 --> 19:59.120
The way I do it with my Linode too is I already have my SSH keys uploaded.

19:59.120 --> 20:04.240
So when I'm deploying a new Linode, I just check the boxes, yeah, attach my SSH keys

20:04.240 --> 20:05.520
to that Linode.

20:05.520 --> 20:09.240
And so they spin it up, and I just SSH into it, and I'm in.

20:09.240 --> 20:11.480
It's so, so great.

20:11.480 --> 20:15.220
And then the Docker stuff was already installed with this particular one click that I did.

20:15.220 --> 20:19.240
So it was just a matter of putting together a Docker compose file and turning the application

20:19.240 --> 20:21.520
on, and I was off and running.

20:21.520 --> 20:24.800
So, so quick, so easy, and then it's really fast.

20:24.800 --> 20:28.520
And I picked the Texas data center, so that would be right in the middle of everybody

20:28.520 --> 20:29.920
that'd be working on the box.

20:29.920 --> 20:34.000
So go get that $100 credit so you can really see what I'm talking about here.

20:34.000 --> 20:35.440
Just a lot to take in.

20:35.440 --> 20:40.400
And so I think $100 really lets you soak it all up, gives you an opportunity to learn,

20:40.400 --> 20:41.400
see what they do for themselves.

20:41.400 --> 20:45.800
So that's why you gotta go check it out by going to linode.com slash coder.

20:45.800 --> 20:54.680
Get $100 in credit on your new Linode account and try them out, linode.com slash coder.

20:54.680 --> 20:56.040
What a week.

20:56.040 --> 21:05.800
New York Times ran a hit piece on Google's CEO saying that he has paralyzing indecision

21:05.800 --> 21:13.040
that locks Google up, and they got a bunch of VPs to go off the record and on the record

21:13.040 --> 21:15.960
to just crap all over him.

21:15.960 --> 21:20.060
One Google executive who departed in February said, if I had to summarize it, I would say

21:20.060 --> 21:23.380
the signal to noise ratio is what wore me down.

21:23.380 --> 21:27.880
Since 2020, 36 Google vice presidents have left the company, and some of them are getting

21:27.880 --> 21:30.180
vocal about why.

21:30.180 --> 21:36.040
Attempting challenges, they are way too risk averse.

21:36.040 --> 21:39.480
Several Google executives told the New York Times that the company is suffering from all

21:39.480 --> 21:44.380
kinds of issues that are related to their size now, including this paralyzing bureaucracy

21:44.380 --> 21:50.240
that seems to really kind of slow down at the top, and a bias, they say, towards inaction,

21:50.240 --> 21:55.520
and a fixation by the leadership on the public perception of the company.

21:55.520 --> 21:58.480
And they say Sundar Pichai has to go.

21:58.480 --> 22:04.360
I don't really know that many regular people who aren't like super-duper tech nerds, really

22:04.360 --> 22:08.120
ever one had the love affair with Google that I think particularly folks like the open source

22:08.120 --> 22:11.440
community definitely did.

22:11.440 --> 22:16.200
So like when I talk to regular people, you know, the normies, if there's a tech company

22:16.200 --> 22:18.600
that they hate, it's almost always Facebook.

22:18.600 --> 22:20.280
Yes, right.

22:20.280 --> 22:24.400
And they're like happy to not spend as much money as they would on an iPhone on a mid-range

22:24.400 --> 22:25.400
Samsung.

22:25.400 --> 22:26.400
Yeah, yeah.

22:26.400 --> 22:27.400
They're proud of their...

22:27.400 --> 22:33.000
Right, I mean, when I talk to tech people, like it's like, you know, the other developers

22:33.000 --> 22:38.160
I know, it's weird because like I kind of always had a little bit of ire towards Google,

22:38.160 --> 22:41.320
but that was me banging my people should pay for software drum.

22:41.320 --> 22:42.320
Right.

22:42.320 --> 22:43.320
They're dumping on the market.

22:43.320 --> 22:44.320
Right.

22:44.320 --> 22:45.880
But I don't think that's what this is about.

22:45.880 --> 22:46.880
I don't know, right?

22:46.880 --> 22:49.880
There was the whole Google tried to get a government, the military contract thing, and

22:49.880 --> 22:51.840
then they have like a worker strike or something.

22:51.840 --> 22:55.800
Yeah, they had a walk, they had a big walkout.

22:55.800 --> 22:59.200
It doesn't read like the typical Google criticism.

22:59.200 --> 23:05.520
What this reads to me as is a bunch of hotshot VPs who had the next brilliant product idea

23:05.520 --> 23:12.920
to take on Company X pitched it, Google didn't act on it, and then Company X came to market.

23:12.920 --> 23:17.940
Like the story that I saw bubble up in the Google ecosphere before this one is that Google

23:17.940 --> 23:23.080
internally has been working on an AirTags competitor, and there's people internally

23:23.080 --> 23:27.720
that are salty that they didn't get it out before Apple got AirTags out, and now they

23:27.720 --> 23:32.520
feel like they're going to look like a MeToo brand when they release their tracker.

23:32.520 --> 23:35.920
And I think that might have been maybe the impetus for somebody to reach out to the New

23:35.920 --> 23:43.620
York Times, or completely alternatively, this entire thing is a brilliant PR piece by a

23:43.620 --> 23:49.360
firm that is really earning their dollar right now, because my read on this is good.

23:49.360 --> 23:51.320
I think this is great news.

23:51.320 --> 23:56.520
The fact that Sundar Pichai takes a while to make a decision as a leader at Google,

23:56.520 --> 23:58.680
thank God, thank God.

23:58.680 --> 24:02.560
And the other part this story touches on is that people are salty they didn't buy Shopify.

24:02.560 --> 24:03.560
Good.

24:03.560 --> 24:05.580
I'm glad Google didn't buy Shopify.

24:05.580 --> 24:09.840
Like when you look at this from a market strategy standpoint right now, there's a lot of heat

24:09.840 --> 24:14.040
coming down from different governments about antitrust.

24:14.040 --> 24:20.840
So maybe having somebody at the helm of the world's most scary data collector that is

24:20.840 --> 24:25.840
cautious and thinking about things and taking his time to make a decision, maybe that's

24:25.840 --> 24:26.940
a good thing.

24:26.940 --> 24:31.600
When I read this, I think that's exactly what I want Google's CEO doing is thinking long

24:31.600 --> 24:35.480
and hard about the decisions and industry moves that they make.

24:35.480 --> 24:42.020
I think this in a way is almost like a PR piece for Google to twist the way the regulators

24:42.020 --> 24:43.020
are going to look at Google.

24:43.020 --> 24:47.880
I'm not saying that's what it is, but it's so good for that that it almost could be.

24:47.880 --> 24:52.840
I love it, so you think there's some VP covetching to the New York Times being like, damn this

24:52.840 --> 24:56.360
Sundar guy, he's not being as rapacious a capitalist as I would.

24:56.360 --> 25:00.720
Well, I mean, yeah, I think it's in a way I'm glad.

25:00.720 --> 25:04.480
I agree that for Google maybe it would be better if he was being a little more ruthless.

25:04.480 --> 25:07.600
They probably should have snapped up Shopify.

25:07.600 --> 25:12.160
They could be a little more dynamic, they could be a little more aggressive, and they

25:12.160 --> 25:14.480
would probably be doing even better.

25:14.480 --> 25:21.160
But dude, Alphabet itself is worth like around $1.6 trillion right now, so maybe they're

25:21.160 --> 25:22.160
not doing it wrong.

25:22.160 --> 25:23.960
You know, Wes in the chat room makes a good point.

25:23.960 --> 25:29.320
There is some rings of truth in there, that Google does seem to lack focus, that their

25:29.320 --> 25:33.000
decisions are slow, and then when they do make a decision, it's generally reactionary

25:33.000 --> 25:35.100
to the market.

25:35.100 --> 25:36.100
Those are all true.

25:36.100 --> 25:40.440
I mean, there's a connected story going on basically in all the press right now of all

25:40.440 --> 25:44.560
the big tech companies are fighting like hell to prevent this regulation.

25:44.560 --> 25:48.280
Yeah, when there's been like in the US, there's been like five different proposals on how

25:48.280 --> 25:51.200
they could break these big tech companies up for antitrust.

25:51.200 --> 25:54.840
The EU's got stuff in the works.

25:54.840 --> 25:55.840
They're getting surrounded.

25:55.840 --> 26:00.880
If you're any of these other tech CEOs, you've just got to hate Zuckerberg the most because

26:00.880 --> 26:02.360
he really brought this down on them.

26:02.360 --> 26:03.360
Yeah, you're right.

26:03.360 --> 26:08.760
Right, well, at the Facebook election, route Cambridge Analytica, the politicians would

26:08.760 --> 26:13.280
not be, it seems weird to say, but not so long ago, the tech companies were like the

26:13.280 --> 26:15.000
great, you know, the great hope, right?

26:15.000 --> 26:16.000
The darlings.

26:16.000 --> 26:17.000
Right.

26:17.000 --> 26:18.000
America's best industry.

26:18.000 --> 26:19.000
Right.

26:19.000 --> 26:20.000
You know, this is the future.

26:20.000 --> 26:22.480
We're going to have all these new and they remember biotech was going to be the next

26:22.480 --> 26:23.480
thing.

26:23.480 --> 26:24.480
Mm hmm.

26:24.480 --> 26:27.680
And, you know, autonomous automation was going to be like a good thing.

26:27.680 --> 26:29.040
Now you say you do automation.

26:29.040 --> 26:32.640
You're like, oh, so you're trying to put my uncle out of a job.

26:32.640 --> 26:33.640
Right?

26:33.640 --> 26:37.220
It's the worm has turned, and it's all because of Marky Mark.

26:37.220 --> 26:38.320
That is an interesting insight.

26:38.320 --> 26:39.320
I think you're right.

26:39.320 --> 26:41.160
That really was the beginning of this whole thing.

26:41.160 --> 26:45.360
And then when they when they hauled him in front of Congress, he's like, I welcome regulation.

26:45.360 --> 26:50.040
Of course, the big companies love regulation because it puts barriers up to little guys.

26:50.040 --> 26:51.480
I'm not so sure Apple does.

26:51.480 --> 26:54.000
You know, did you see the story that Tim Cook called Nancy Pelosi?

26:54.000 --> 26:55.800
Yeah, I saw that.

26:55.800 --> 26:56.800
Yeah.

26:56.800 --> 27:00.640
Also, it's not in the headline, but Google's senior vice president for global affairs,

27:00.640 --> 27:05.680
Kent Walker, also has made many calls to lawmakers in recent days, too.

27:05.680 --> 27:08.080
They're essentially trying to push back.

27:08.080 --> 27:11.000
But I guess the reception's been cold.

27:11.000 --> 27:15.140
Supposedly Pelosi told Cook that she needs specifics on what doesn't work for him.

27:15.140 --> 27:20.560
And Cook says these changes would disrupt iPhones in the market and actually cause like

27:20.560 --> 27:23.320
grief in people's life if you make these changes.

27:23.320 --> 27:29.120
And it's so crazy, man, because basically from the start of the show, you and I have

27:29.120 --> 27:31.320
been saying this is the way this is going to go.

27:31.320 --> 27:33.880
This is the way it's going to go from day one.

27:33.880 --> 27:41.640
And now here we are and I think they're going to get up and Apple is totally unprepared.

27:41.640 --> 27:44.200
You know, they're not making the concessions they need to make.

27:44.200 --> 27:50.240
If Apple would have given up on their 30 percent cut years ago, they'd be in a way better position.

27:50.240 --> 27:55.120
But they antagonize developers to the point where they became outraged and they're trying

27:55.120 --> 28:01.380
to claim that forcing them to open up third party installs on the iPhone would just completely

28:01.380 --> 28:05.720
wreck the iPhone of all security, which is complete and total bullsh**.

28:05.720 --> 28:07.680
Because of course, you'd still have to have a developer account.

28:07.680 --> 28:10.460
You still have to have an entitlement that is signed by Apple.

28:10.460 --> 28:13.240
They would retain the ability to revoke those apps and entitlements.

28:13.240 --> 28:17.760
They could revoke your developer account, even if you didn't go through the app store,

28:17.760 --> 28:19.600
just like they can do now on their platform.

28:19.600 --> 28:22.440
They could do it to third party apps that get sideloaded.

28:22.440 --> 28:24.640
They still could have to require signing.

28:24.640 --> 28:26.920
The whole thing is such bullsh** from Apple.

28:26.920 --> 28:31.800
It's like they don't think it's like they don't appreciate the train that is coming

28:31.800 --> 28:38.280
their way, because what makes Apple work is the integration of everything.

28:38.280 --> 28:43.980
Like if you took one message away from WWDC, it was that all of those features are coming

28:43.980 --> 28:48.780
to all of the platforms at once, iOS, the Mac, the iPad.

28:48.780 --> 28:50.640
They're all getting all of the features at once.

28:50.640 --> 28:54.640
And they work together with things like universal control.

28:54.640 --> 28:58.440
That's what makes Apple's ecosystem compelling, the fact that the AirPods work so well with

28:58.440 --> 29:00.400
the damn phone.

29:00.400 --> 29:05.000
And so if regulation comes in and breaks all this up, they're going to be so screwed because

29:05.000 --> 29:07.240
their secret sauce is taken from them.

29:07.240 --> 29:12.320
And so they are playing with a kind of fire that could destroy them.

29:12.320 --> 29:17.880
And it's wild to watch a company go from nearly dead to now so far up that they're going to

29:17.880 --> 29:19.880
be sliced up by the government.

29:19.880 --> 29:24.880
I mean, are they going to be sliced up or are they going to just have to like take less

29:24.880 --> 29:25.880
than 30 percent?

29:25.880 --> 29:26.880
I don't know.

29:26.880 --> 29:27.880
I'm not sure.

29:27.880 --> 29:29.960
I mean, Apple has been building a legal team for a while.

29:29.960 --> 29:31.560
I don't think anybody is getting broke.

29:31.560 --> 29:37.960
The only one I think might face an actual breakup is for some reason the Instagram thing

29:37.960 --> 29:42.360
seems to have pissed off the lawmakers significantly.

29:42.360 --> 29:45.600
And I feel like Facebook could lose either Instagram or what is it, WeChat that they

29:45.600 --> 29:46.600
own?

29:46.600 --> 29:47.600
Yeah, WeChat, right?

29:47.600 --> 29:48.600
Yeah.

29:48.600 --> 29:53.120
That's what I could see only because like Apple is doing hardware integration and software

29:53.120 --> 29:55.920
integration between their family of products.

29:55.920 --> 29:57.880
Microsoft bundling Internet Explorer.

29:57.880 --> 30:00.760
I mean, that might be how they're looking at this.

30:00.760 --> 30:01.760
Okay.

30:01.760 --> 30:02.760
But let's take me.

30:02.760 --> 30:03.760
Right.

30:03.760 --> 30:08.800
Like one of the reasons I keep floating back to Mac is like as I buy Christmas, right?

30:08.800 --> 30:12.960
The home pods are great or like the AirPods Max, right?

30:12.960 --> 30:17.160
These are I'm using them right now for my audio output.

30:17.160 --> 30:18.160
Right.

30:18.160 --> 30:20.600
I'm using the mic for the input.

30:20.600 --> 30:21.600
These are really nice.

30:21.600 --> 30:26.200
They automagically know which device I'm trying to use.

30:26.200 --> 30:31.200
I don't have to do, you know, the Bluetooth dance that I used to always have to do.

30:31.200 --> 30:33.800
Or I don't have to get cables that are going to get frayed and then only come out of one

30:33.800 --> 30:36.000
ear like my other headphones.

30:36.000 --> 30:39.960
I can, you know, quote, throw, what is it, AirPlay?

30:39.960 --> 30:44.800
Stuff from my computer to my phone to the HomePod to the HomePod in another room and

30:44.800 --> 30:46.240
seamlessly pick it up.

30:46.240 --> 30:47.600
I don't think that's anti-try.

30:47.600 --> 30:49.640
I don't think that's really being a trust.

30:49.640 --> 30:55.680
Now, Apple saying that who can and cannot have software in the App Store isn't either,

30:55.680 --> 31:02.800
to be honest, except when they say users may only get software via the App Store, right?

31:02.800 --> 31:07.920
So I guess I argued myself actually into your position that the problem to me that Apple

31:07.920 --> 31:16.680
has is if I want to, you know, if the mad botter wants to make the next great iPad app

31:16.680 --> 31:22.760
and Apple for some reason doesn't like it, then I'm posed.

31:22.760 --> 31:26.880
I can't go to, you know, Tim Sweeney at Epic and say I want to put it in your store, right?

31:26.880 --> 31:32.440
This is where the whole store analogy kind of falls down because if, you know, if 7-Eleven

31:32.440 --> 31:36.880
doesn't want to carry my slushy brand, well, quick check might or wall on might.

31:36.880 --> 31:37.880
That's not the case on iOS.

31:37.880 --> 31:40.840
I just can't imagine regulators stop at the App Store.

31:40.840 --> 31:44.960
Like they open, once they crack that door open, where else are you going to go?

31:44.960 --> 31:47.240
You could say maybe AirPods need to be broken out or something.

31:47.240 --> 31:48.240
I mean, I don't know.

31:48.240 --> 31:49.240
I don't know.

31:49.240 --> 31:50.240
I don't know.

31:50.240 --> 31:54.760
So the reason why I think is I think there is an appetite in the U.S. public.

31:54.760 --> 32:01.800
So there was a survey done today and 53 percent of the citizens of the states that were surveyed,

32:01.800 --> 32:08.680
53 percent somewhat support Congress's big tech antitrust bills, 44 percent rank tech

32:08.680 --> 32:12.600
regulation as a low priority or the lowest.

32:12.600 --> 32:14.600
I think 53 percent is a pretty significant number.

32:14.600 --> 32:18.800
And the reason why I think it's significant is the poll was actually commissioned by a

32:18.800 --> 32:20.320
tech industry funded group.

32:20.320 --> 32:25.380
So if anything, it's going to like it's going to bring those numbers down because it's depressing

32:25.380 --> 32:26.380
the numbers.

32:26.380 --> 32:29.760
And if the numbers are 53 percent when they're depressed, I'm a little concerned about that.

32:29.760 --> 32:33.180
However, the survey showed that when you were given specific examples of how they might

32:33.180 --> 32:37.720
break up the big tech companies, respondents said they would then oppose them.

32:37.720 --> 32:42.440
But initially the concept of breaking up big tech so that way it's fair for consumers and

32:42.440 --> 32:45.120
small businesses, people like that idea.

32:45.120 --> 32:50.160
And so it gives our Congress critters an opportunity to go up there and sound like they're doing

32:50.160 --> 32:56.500
something for the people and play tough without actually having to do anything that really

32:56.500 --> 32:58.800
is going to change the lives of the American people.

32:58.800 --> 33:02.080
Like there's so many other things they should be focusing on right now.

33:02.080 --> 33:06.240
Even with all the crap we talk about this, but this is what they're going to focus on.

33:06.240 --> 33:10.860
Honestly, if they can get on the other end of this and what's really changed is we get

33:10.860 --> 33:14.480
more access to installing apps on our devices, great.

33:14.480 --> 33:17.920
I think where my primary concern comes from is watching what they did to Microsoft and

33:17.920 --> 33:19.340
how they neutered them.

33:19.340 --> 33:25.820
How Microsoft went and just kind of just became an old slow dog after the antitrust stuff

33:25.820 --> 33:27.560
came in.

33:27.560 --> 33:29.240
For better or for worse, I suppose.

33:29.240 --> 33:32.960
I guess I just I can't get past the idea that they're just going to go for the easy win

33:32.960 --> 33:34.680
and say Instagram can't be part of Facebook.

33:34.680 --> 33:35.680
Yeah.

33:35.680 --> 33:38.680
Oh, and by real time follow up, Reese in the chat room points out it's WhatsApp.

33:38.680 --> 33:41.520
WeChat's the China chat app and it's WhatsApp.

33:41.520 --> 33:42.520
Yeah.

33:42.520 --> 33:43.520
We'll see.

33:43.520 --> 33:44.520
I suppose.

33:44.520 --> 33:46.840
Boy, this stuff is really rolling on though.

33:46.840 --> 33:47.920
It really is coming up.

33:47.920 --> 33:51.920
It's coming up and I think they're not playing a smart game here.

33:51.920 --> 33:55.880
I think the tech companies are about to get rolled by DC and that when you look at other

33:55.880 --> 34:01.100
industries like the defense and oils and other big industries like pharma, they know how

34:01.100 --> 34:04.360
to handle this so much better than these tech companies do.

34:04.360 --> 34:05.600
They suck at this kind of stuff.

34:05.600 --> 34:10.040
I mean, the fact that Tim Cook called Nancy Pelosi and that leaked out is an example of

34:10.040 --> 34:12.240
something that just doesn't happen with the other big companies.

34:12.240 --> 34:15.000
Well, and she obviously leaked it, right?

34:15.000 --> 34:16.000
Yep.

34:16.000 --> 34:17.000
Playing hardball.

34:17.000 --> 34:18.000
Playing hardball.

34:18.000 --> 34:21.120
Good luck, Tim.

34:21.120 --> 34:23.840

35:01.500 --> 35:03.960
just how freaking gorgeous these dashboards are.

35:03.960 --> 35:08.860
They've done an incredible job and I underscore that because that can really make a difference

35:08.860 --> 35:12.840
when you're in a discussion, a meeting maybe with somebody that's upstairs.

35:12.840 --> 35:15.920
You can show them this information and they can grok it.

35:15.920 --> 35:19.880

35:37.600 --> 35:43.760
while you're supporting the show datadog.com slash Coder Radio.

35:43.760 --> 35:47.040
Well speaking of Microsoft, they're doing all right now.

35:47.040 --> 35:52.860
They just hit the two trillion dollar milestone, unbelievable.

35:52.860 --> 35:56.720
Their shares have gained 19% so far this year.

35:56.720 --> 36:03.360
Only Apple and Saudi's Armco or Aramco have hit the two trillion in value, which is an

36:03.360 --> 36:04.440
oil organization.

36:04.440 --> 36:10.640
So Apple and an oil group have hit two trillion and now Microsoft, two trillion dollars.

36:10.640 --> 36:14.560
So I guess maybe they did okay after all that antitrust stuff.

36:14.560 --> 36:15.560
That's huge.

36:15.560 --> 36:17.760
That's sweet, sweet Azure money.

36:17.760 --> 36:23.520
Nadella is just, I mean, he's basically locked himself in the Hall of Fame of CEOs now.

36:23.520 --> 36:30.040
If you're a CEO while your company creates, hits a milestone like this, like he's set.

36:30.040 --> 36:32.840
Even if he does nothing else, remarkable for the rest of his tenure.

36:32.840 --> 36:33.840
Yeah, he's done.

36:33.840 --> 36:34.840
He's good.

36:34.840 --> 36:35.840
Yep.

36:35.840 --> 36:38.280
And you know, congratulations to our friends at Microsoft.

36:38.280 --> 36:40.800
I don't know how much this really matters to the employees there.

36:40.800 --> 36:41.800
Not even a little.

36:41.800 --> 36:46.040
Boy, is it happening in the shadow of Bill Gates just eating a lot of shit these days.

36:46.040 --> 36:47.320
Oh, poor Bill.

36:47.320 --> 36:48.320
I know.

36:48.320 --> 36:52.920
Today, Warren Buffett announced he's leaving the board of the Gates Foundation.

36:52.920 --> 36:58.200
It's like there's a hit against Bill Gates, like a public PR hit.

36:58.200 --> 36:59.800
Honestly, I really think there was.

36:59.800 --> 37:03.800
He was like the last like loved tech guy.

37:03.800 --> 37:05.600
I mean, it sounds like there was some hanky panky.

37:05.600 --> 37:06.600
Yeah.

37:06.600 --> 37:08.100
And you don't think Warren Buffett did any hanky panky.

37:08.100 --> 37:12.000
That's why I find all the Bill Gates stuff kind of like, yeah, I suppose they're all

37:12.000 --> 37:14.160
kind of weirdos.

37:14.160 --> 37:15.160
They're all kind of weirdos.

37:15.160 --> 37:18.440
You don't get that rich and that much power if you don't have like a sense of entitlement

37:18.440 --> 37:20.720
that you just like do weird stuff.

37:20.720 --> 37:21.720
True.

37:21.720 --> 37:22.720
All the things are mine.

37:22.720 --> 37:23.720
Yeah.

37:23.720 --> 37:28.280
Well, so it's all in the shadow of Microsoft becoming hooch.

37:28.280 --> 37:31.680
But Gates is sort of just an after story now, I suppose, about it.

37:31.680 --> 37:32.880
I don't know.

37:32.880 --> 37:33.880
I wonder what's going on there.

37:33.880 --> 37:34.880
I wonder where that leads to.

37:34.880 --> 37:38.600
You think the goal is to just discredit people in tech in general, like big tech leaders?

37:38.600 --> 37:42.960
Because Bezos gets a lot of shit, too, although I'm not a big fan of either one of these guys.

37:42.960 --> 37:48.480
I think that there's just a cultural moment right now where the tech guys are no longer

37:48.480 --> 37:52.200
seen as the level born nerds who are going to build great things that are going to save

37:52.200 --> 37:53.200
us all.

37:53.200 --> 37:54.200
Right.

37:54.200 --> 37:55.200
Right.

37:55.200 --> 37:56.200
Right.

37:56.200 --> 37:57.960
Hey, you know what I didn't realize when we started the show today?

37:57.960 --> 38:00.600
Tomorrow is the big Windows 11 reveal.

38:00.600 --> 38:02.000
I think you mean Windows 10 X.

38:02.000 --> 38:07.120
Now, I think you mean the artist formerly known as Windows 10 X.

38:07.120 --> 38:08.120
Wait.

38:08.120 --> 38:09.120
Wait.

38:09.120 --> 38:10.680
Is this Metro again?

38:10.680 --> 38:11.680
Kind of is.

38:11.680 --> 38:13.000
Whoa, that's a deep cut.

38:13.000 --> 38:14.560
I actually think it's Plasma, dude.

38:14.560 --> 38:16.080
Have you looked at these screenshots?

38:16.080 --> 38:18.280
I just put a link to The Verge in there.

38:18.280 --> 38:19.960
It looks very KDE.

38:19.960 --> 38:23.000
It does have the essence of KDE going on, yeah.

38:23.000 --> 38:28.840
It's like Gnome and KDE had a baby, and it's Windows 11 UI, and a Chromebook.

38:28.840 --> 38:31.080
I do not like the icons in the middle of the taskbar.

38:31.080 --> 38:32.080
That sucks.

38:32.080 --> 38:34.360
No, I don't like anything about this.

38:34.360 --> 38:35.360
Yeah.

38:35.360 --> 38:36.360
So there you go.

38:36.360 --> 38:41.800
Significant updates, Nadella says, Windows 11 will be likely demoed tomorrow.

38:41.800 --> 38:44.440
There's already a leaked version online, so we kind of already know a lot.

38:44.440 --> 38:48.920
It sort of took a lot of the excitement out of the event.

38:48.920 --> 38:50.760
All the rots are already gone over in detail.

38:50.760 --> 38:51.760
Yeah, what does he think?

38:51.760 --> 38:55.120
Does he have a summary of what Paul thinks?

38:55.120 --> 38:56.120
He thinks it's Windows 10 X.

38:56.120 --> 38:57.120
Yeah, okay.

38:57.120 --> 38:58.120
Oh, yeah.

38:58.120 --> 38:59.120
Yeah, yeah.

38:59.120 --> 39:00.120
Yeah.

39:00.120 --> 39:02.880
Because it is, right?

39:02.880 --> 39:06.520
Microsoft also recently announced their 30% cut on PC games is going down.

39:06.520 --> 39:12.000
They're dropping it to a 12% cut for games.

39:12.000 --> 39:15.540
That's 18% of throwing the finger at Apple.

39:15.540 --> 39:19.600
They're expecting Windows 11 to be a free upgrade for any PC running Windows 10 right

39:19.600 --> 39:20.600
now.

39:20.600 --> 39:22.160
That's because it's 10 X.

39:22.160 --> 39:23.160
I think so.

39:23.160 --> 39:28.000
They say this is going to be the Windows release that focuses on Windows enthusiasts.

39:28.000 --> 39:30.280
Are there Windows enthusiasts?

39:30.280 --> 39:31.280
Is that a thing?

39:31.280 --> 39:32.960
He's unaware of such a creature.

39:32.960 --> 39:36.360
I mean, not even Paul Therot, who makes his living writing about Windows.

39:36.360 --> 39:39.560
I would not even describe him as a Windows enthusiast.

39:39.560 --> 39:44.160
If you listen to his podcast, Windows Weekly, I would not categorize him as enthusiastic

39:44.160 --> 39:46.680
or even happy at all.

39:46.680 --> 39:47.680
Right.

39:47.680 --> 39:50.720
I think it's what happens to guys who cover this for a while.

39:50.720 --> 39:51.720
Look at us.

39:51.720 --> 39:52.720
It's true.

39:52.720 --> 39:53.720
Oh, man.

39:53.720 --> 39:59.720
It's just impossible to stay positive after you watch this.

39:59.720 --> 40:04.240
Just take like a decade or so on an OS and you will hate everything about it.

40:04.240 --> 40:05.240
That's true.

40:05.240 --> 40:09.160
Any tool you use extensively, you become aware of all of its problems, and then you kind

40:09.160 --> 40:11.120
of fixate on that for a bit.

40:11.120 --> 40:14.640
So meetup.com slash Jupiter Broadcasting, I just want to mention that one more time.

40:14.640 --> 40:18.600
If you're out in the Denver or Salt Lake City area in August and want to come roast with

40:18.600 --> 40:21.640
us, I imagine it's going to be real hot, right?

40:21.640 --> 40:24.960
In Salt Lake City, it's going to be real hot on August 7th.

40:24.960 --> 40:26.280
Yeah, I would think so.

40:26.280 --> 40:27.280
Why am I doing this to myself?

40:27.280 --> 40:28.280
Why didn't I go up to Canada?

40:28.280 --> 40:29.280
Oh, the border's closed.

40:29.280 --> 40:30.280
Yeah.

40:30.280 --> 40:31.280
Because you miss events.

40:31.280 --> 40:32.280
I do.

40:32.280 --> 40:33.280
That's what it is.

40:33.280 --> 40:34.280
I just decided to do my own thing.

40:34.280 --> 40:35.280
I'll be honest.

40:35.280 --> 40:36.280
I'm tempted.

40:36.280 --> 40:37.800
If I can somehow get away, I might do it.

40:37.800 --> 40:39.120
Oh, how fun would that be?

40:39.120 --> 40:41.000
Do you miss the events at all?

40:41.000 --> 40:42.000
I mean, like-

40:42.000 --> 40:44.160
I don't miss the bad, lame events.

40:44.160 --> 40:45.160
Yeah.

40:45.160 --> 40:51.000
But I think once we get out of this weird state, which we, you know, 2022 in terms of

40:51.000 --> 40:55.520
like no conferences and stuff, I'll probably still, like there was a couple that are good.

40:55.520 --> 40:57.560
Like DevFest Florida, I always enjoyed.

40:57.560 --> 41:02.640
I never went to Southeast Linux Fest and no offense to anybody who runs it, but I've heard

41:02.640 --> 41:03.640
mixed things.

41:03.640 --> 41:07.320
Maybe at a good year, maybe at a bad year, but Linux Fest Northwest, I regret not going

41:07.320 --> 41:08.320
to.

41:08.320 --> 41:09.320
Yeah.

41:09.320 --> 41:10.320
I miss that the most.

41:10.320 --> 41:11.320
That's the one I miss the most.

41:11.320 --> 41:12.320
Yeah.

41:12.320 --> 41:13.320
I really was.

41:13.320 --> 41:14.320
I wouldn't go to WWC at this juncture.

41:14.320 --> 41:20.560
Cause I don't do enough iOSy stuff to care and Google IO is just a train wreck.

41:20.560 --> 41:21.880
Yeah.

41:21.880 --> 41:22.880
And those may stay virtual.

41:22.880 --> 41:23.880
Who knows?

41:23.880 --> 41:24.880
We'll see.

41:24.880 --> 41:27.760
We'll see if it actually stays virtual cause it's just better.

41:27.760 --> 41:33.200
I wonder if by the next time we get together on our regular Monday recording, I wonder

41:33.200 --> 41:34.200
if you'll have a Thaleo.

41:34.200 --> 41:37.720
It might be too soon still depending on parts and stuff.

41:37.720 --> 41:38.720
Probably not if it hasn't shipped.

41:38.720 --> 41:39.720
Right?

41:39.720 --> 41:40.720
Yeah.

41:40.720 --> 41:41.720
It's two business days from pick up.

41:41.720 --> 41:44.240
So even if they would have to have it done tomorrow.

41:44.240 --> 41:45.240
Yeah.

41:45.240 --> 41:46.240
It's a long shot.

41:46.240 --> 41:50.120
Then I still wouldn't get it because it'd be Friday, Monday.

41:50.120 --> 41:51.120
Yeah.

41:51.120 --> 41:58.000
So every day, my buddy Alex from self-hosted, my co-host from self-hosted will be in studio.

41:58.000 --> 42:01.160
So I might invite him to sit down with us if you're open to that.

42:01.160 --> 42:02.160
Sounds fun.

42:02.160 --> 42:04.660
He's going to be staying for the week and we're going to be just hanging out and working

42:04.660 --> 42:05.660
on projects.

42:05.660 --> 42:06.660
Yeah.

42:06.660 --> 42:08.920
I've been kind of getting the studio prepped for him cause.

42:08.920 --> 42:09.920
Prepared.

42:09.920 --> 42:10.920
Yeah.

42:10.920 --> 42:13.080
You know, it's just sort of when I'm just working here, it's just a space for me really

42:13.080 --> 42:17.940
and Wes, but we have a room that he can stay in and stuff.

42:17.940 --> 42:21.180
So it was just getting that ready, getting new linens and stuff like that.

42:21.180 --> 42:25.200
The weird like ancillary things you do to support the business that have nothing to

42:25.200 --> 42:28.600
do with like creating content.

42:28.600 --> 42:29.640
Yep.

42:29.640 --> 42:32.640
Just totally like we're out there getting rooms ready and stuff, but it's so I'm totally

42:32.640 --> 42:34.000
looking forward to it.

42:34.000 --> 42:35.000
So that'll be fun.

42:35.000 --> 42:38.340
And I'm like, that'll, that's going to spice things up for next week.

42:38.340 --> 42:39.340
So there you go.

42:39.340 --> 42:42.280
And maybe we'll have comments on the, I was tempted to try at windows 11.

42:42.280 --> 42:45.480
I may give it a download and try it out before next week's coder.

42:45.480 --> 42:46.480
I might.

42:46.480 --> 42:47.840
Oh, I'm going to try it out.

42:47.840 --> 42:48.840
Are you?

42:48.840 --> 42:49.840
Yeah.

42:49.840 --> 42:50.840
I'm going to try it out.

42:50.840 --> 42:51.840
Yeah.

42:51.840 --> 42:52.840
Okay.

42:52.840 --> 42:53.840
All right.

42:53.840 --> 42:54.840
Why not?

42:54.840 --> 42:55.840
I'll give it a go too.

42:55.840 --> 42:56.840
Well, anything you want to mention before we get out of here?
