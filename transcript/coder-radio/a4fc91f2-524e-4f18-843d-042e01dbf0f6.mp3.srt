00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
This is Coder Radio, episode 448 for January 10th, 2022.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:20,160
Oh, hello and welcome into Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show, taking a pragmatic look

3
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:24,680
at the art and the business of software development and the world of technology.

4
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:30,320
My name is Chris and joining us every single week is our professional podcasting host,

5
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:31,320
Mr. Dominic.

6
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:32,320
Hello, Mike.

7
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:33,320
Hello, Chris.

8
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:35,220
This is my new NPR voice.

9
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:37,760
Here on the show today, we're going to be very calm.

10
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:38,760
Very calm.

11
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:39,760
We haven't made any mistakes.

12
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:42,580
There will be no mistakes in this episode because we are very professional.

13
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:45,800
We definitely haven't done the four count like three times.

14
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:47,920
This is like our third intro now.

15
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:48,920
Totally not.

16
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:53,340
When you're rounding almost 450 episodes, you know, it's just instinctual.

17
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:55,640
So we can't mess up at this point.

18
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:56,640
Right?

19
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:57,640
It's impossible.

20
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:59,080
Even our mess ups are intentional.

21
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:01,400
When the president does it, it's not illegal.

22
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:02,400
Yeah.

23
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:04,520
Nixon became a little Irish at the end there, but I'm working on it.

24
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:05,600
Nixon's going to be joining us soon.

25
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,160
I think you could do a modern Nixon.

26
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:09,080
I think I might be a modern Nixon.

27
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:12,880
Got to get the peace sign going, you know, get your hands above your head, shake your

28
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:13,880
hands.

29
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:14,880
I am not a crook.

30
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:15,880
That's actually pretty good.

31
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:19,400
That might be better than your Jar Jar.

32
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:23,960
As you age, the voices in your head change a bit, I'm evolving from the innocence that

33
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:27,900
is Jar Jar Binks to a more cynical Richard Milhous Nixon.

34
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:31,700
Which Jar Jar was inevitably going to turn into had they continued to develop his character.

35
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:36,320
And not made him a very sad street clown, which is literally what they do in canon.

36
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:41,880
So John wants us to kick off 2022 by going through some of our favorite Mac apps to make

37
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:43,520
it a little more usable.

38
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:49,120
He says, I feel like I live in a bizarro world because I'm kind of a kindred spirit to Chris

39
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:56,080
where I have an M1 Mac and I also have an X1 Carbon running Linux.

40
00:01:56,080 --> 00:02:00,540
So I was wondering, now that you guys have spent some time on the M1 Mac, and I'll be

41
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:05,100
spending more time with it over 2022, do you have like a top five must have applications

42
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:09,400
to cut down on some of the Mac's rougher user interface edges?

43
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:13,440
I know that the free software users out there don't like Mac OS and they don't like you

44
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:19,080
talking about on the show, but I got work to do.

45
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:23,660
And he wants to know what we would recommend for getting installed on the Mac for him.

46
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:25,400
Number one is Parallels.

47
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,600
Number two is Parallels Toolbox.

48
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:31,400
He says it looked like an attempt to just get a subscription from me, but I found them

49
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,900
actually to be useful.

50
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:35,360
He likes Warp, that new terminal that you've been using.

51
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:40,480
He uses Bitwarden for his password management and Visual Studio Code for his text editing,

52
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:41,480
obviously.

53
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:45,740
I didn't want to spend a lot of time on this because I don't have like a great list.

54
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:51,340
I did a deep dive a little over almost two years ago now, and I came up with a bunch

55
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:53,800
of good apps and a lot of those still hold.

56
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:59,480
For me to make the Mac usable, I need a few things like iStat Menu, Bartender is a big

57
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:00,480
one for me.

58
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:04,620
It hides all of the icons up in the system menu bar that can just load up the Mac menu

59
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:06,920
bar now like it's a Windows XP box.

60
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:12,360
So I like Bartender quite a bit, and then Magnet for window management, so that way

61
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:16,240
I can snap windows to each other and snap them to the edge and use keyboard combinations

62
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,240
to throw them around.

63
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,640
I like that a lot.

64
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:23,120
That's probably my top list on top of what he's already listed here with Bitwarden and

65
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,120
Parallels.

66
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:27,360
Do you have any others that I'm missing that you thought makes the Mac a lot better?

67
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,960
Yeah, so I'm right with you on that.

68
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:33,200
Actually you introduced me to Bartender a month ago, a couple weeks ago, whatever.

69
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,760
Magnet is like a must-have for me.

70
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:41,120
Dash, which is a source code library management tool, I don't know how you'd call it, but

71
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:45,640
it's a great indie app that basically you can keyboard shortcut like it just did and

72
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:49,680
open it up and it has different doc sets for different programming languages and platforms

73
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,400
and you can quickly look things up.

74
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:54,320
I use it all the time when I'm on Mac.

75
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:57,160
Warp terminal, by the way guys, thanks for the t-shirt.

76
00:03:57,160 --> 00:04:00,080
Apparently if you tweet at people they might send you a t-shirt.

77
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,720
Has become my go-to terminal.

78
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:02,720
Yay.

79
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:08,800
I'll give a plug for Transmit when I'm looking to deal with S3 buckets or SFTP or Samba or

80
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:13,800
even Dropbox and I don't want to install the client or Nextcloud, I use Transmit from Panic.

81
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:17,640
Paint code actually, but that's like a way to develop it.

82
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:18,880
I don't know if you've ever heard of this app.

83
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:24,560
I think I mentioned it years ago from images that can generate code in Swift, Objective-C,

84
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:30,800
JavaScript, C-Sharp, I think even for Unity now it does the Unity flavor of C-Sharp, so

85
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:34,080
that you're basically not dealing with bitmaps.

86
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:40,640
I also am using Rocket, which is a tiny little app that lets you do the Slack style emoticons

87
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:41,640
anywhere.

88
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:44,320
So you have colon and then you type the name like, you know, pepper.

89
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:48,960
And yeah, you can do it in any app in macOS, which is just a quick way to get to emoticons

90
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,120
if you're that kind of person.

91
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,760
Oh, Fantastical too.

92
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:52,760
Yeah.

93
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:53,760
Yeah.

94
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:56,360
But of all of those, I probably could not give up Magnet.

95
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,600
Yeah.

96
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,440
Magnet is super, super useful.

97
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:04,360
I think if you've got a Mac with a notch, Bartender is kind of mandatory as well.

98
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:07,840
I can't see Apple not building that in in the future now that they have a notch.

99
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:08,840
Yeah.

100
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:10,680
That's the problem with making Mac utility apps, isn't it?

101
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:11,680
Oh, for sure.

102
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:14,800
I mean, Bartender's had a good run, you know?

103
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,240
That's been around a while.

104
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,200
It is time to go, my friends.

105
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,200
Yeah.

106
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,200
Sorry, Bartender.

107
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,200
We love you.

108
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:24,480
Speaking of Mac, we didn't have this on the show, but I have been doing some Swift UI

109
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,480
development.

110
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,480
Oh, yeah.

111
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,480
We talked about this a little bit off air.

112
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,480
How is that going?

113
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:30,160
I weirdly like Swift UI.

114
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,160
I'm sorry.

115
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,160
What?

116
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,160
I just fell out of my chair.

117
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,160
You'll have to say that again.

118
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,160
I know.

119
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,960
I actually kind of like it.

120
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:37,960
Huh.

121
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:41,280
Now, maybe I'll hit some wall, but it's been pretty good so far.

122
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:47,600
It does have some of the, I would say, do things our way-ness that is, you know, Debra

123
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,360
Gur for Apple.

124
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:54,860
But especially to get like just a quick internal app up, it's definitely a good tool.

125
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:56,360
I want to hit this pretty hard.

126
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:57,360
This is iOS.

127
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:00,720
I haven't tried the catalyst or the, you know, that kind of stuff yet.

128
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,920
So you're doing this on the iPad Pro?

129
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,480
Actually, yes.

130
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,600
Wow.

131
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,360
So you're helping bring that future that we fear.

132
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:10,720
No, that's good.

133
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:14,480
I was going to ask you to give me an elevator pitch, but I think you just did with the,

134
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,840
it's a great way to prototype in-house apps and things like that.

135
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:18,280
I could totally see that.

136
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:22,260
It's interesting too, because you can bring over all the UI kit stuff by just wrapping

137
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:27,000
it in a class I'm probably going to blog about called the UI representable.

138
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:32,000
It may not in fact be a class and I think about it, but it's very interesting how they've,

139
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:38,920
I can't say brought over, but they've made it possible to do things the old way when

140
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:45,400
it makes sense, when you have something fussy that you want to do, but not make that easy

141
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:49,440
enough that you wouldn't necessarily want to all the time.

142
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,440
Sounds about right, actually.

143
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:54,420
I mean, for simple views, like for instance, I've been screening around with sign in for

144
00:06:54,420 --> 00:07:01,200
Apple for a few things and the sign in with Apple button, it's like its own thing, is

145
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:08,720
a UI kit control, then there is no Swift UI equivalent, so you have to wrap it.

146
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,720
That's really easy, right?

147
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:13,240
Because it's just like a button and you add a tap gesture and you're done.

148
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:18,080
But for things that are more complex, you can get into some interesting cases.

149
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:22,720
I don't know that I wouldn't just jump to Swift UI if I was making a new consumer facing

150
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,720
iOS app.

151
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:24,720
Right.

152
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:29,000
If you're starting today, even if I was starting like last week, yeah, I follow you.

153
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,240
That is an interesting moment.

154
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,800
That's like a line that's been crossed now.

155
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:36,040
I mean, I could definitely see if you're working for some digital agency and they're like their

156
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:40,320
client is, I don't know, name someone who cares about the brand a lot.

157
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:44,220
Nike telling them, well, we can do this real quick and Swift UI, it'll be fast and perform

158
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:49,340
and be done, but you can't have your fussy, you know, whatever your weird, fussy transitions

159
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:50,340
are, whatever you want.

160
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:53,400
Although I'm not sure that that's a can't, I just think it's one of those things where

161
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,800
you might want to say no because it's a pain in the butt.

162
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,120
You don't really want to do this.

163
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,500
It's going to be a lot of work.

164
00:07:58,500 --> 00:07:59,500
There is some bad here.

165
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:02,040
I don't know why, but we may as well do it today, right?

166
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:08,560
I don't know why Xcode hates my iMac Pro with Xeons, but it definitely does.

167
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:13,560
And it makes this computer feel, this $5,000 computer feel slow.

168
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,040
And it makes me deeply sad.

169
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:17,120
It's funny how that happens.

170
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,280
Horrifically sad.

171
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:24,240
I don't understand what could possibly be happening in the background and why the builds

172
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:29,320
when you do a clean build of what I consider to be not that big of an application.

173
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:32,080
So how can we put this?

174
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,720
Tortoise-like.

175
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:40,360
It does make me miss the raw unbridled power that is Objective-C. But I mean, obviously

176
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:44,400
I need to spend 10 grand on a MacBook Pro now because I'm not giving up Swift UI.

177
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,800
Well, and you got to have speed.

178
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,280
I mean, you know, I mean, let's be honest.

179
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:49,520
What are you going to do, buy three iPads?

180
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:53,020
I really just schedule my tea making around builds.

181
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:54,020
I'm not joking.

182
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:55,020
That's what I do.

183
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:56,020
Yeah.

184
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:57,020
Yeah.

185
00:08:57,020 --> 00:08:58,020
Oh man.

186
00:08:58,020 --> 00:08:59,020
It happens so quick.

187
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:00,020
They just get obsolete so quick.

188
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:02,080
Maybe listener Jacob has nailed it.

189
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:05,360
He says he bought himself the M114.

190
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,240
Listener Jacob has written into the show before.

191
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:10,040
I've had an opportunity to meet him a couple of times.

192
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:14,800
Tried and true open source advocate, Linux user too, but he recognizes the tool when

193
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:15,840
he sees one.

194
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:22,280
He says, I got the 14 inch M1 Pro and I have a workflow that almost exclusively uses the

195
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:24,760
10 neural engine cores.

196
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:26,080
Dying to know what that is.

197
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:31,640
But Activity Monitor gives him bubkiss for utilization information.

198
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:33,720
It's sort of a bummer.

199
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:36,280
He wondered, do you have any thoughts?

200
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:39,100
I'll tell you what the workload is here in a minute, but before I get there, do you have

201
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:45,000
any thoughts on these specialized cores that we see baked in by Apple and by arm makers,

202
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,640
but now Intel as well has announced that they plan to do specialized cores.

203
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:55,280
This seems like maybe this is their solution to heat and energy consumption, right?

204
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:57,280
It's just specialized devices.

205
00:09:57,280 --> 00:10:01,840
If you think about it, you're, especially on a notebook, your big problems are 90% of

206
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:04,840
the time, most users, right?

207
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:08,280
Even professional users are doing like non hardcore stuff.

208
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:09,280
They're not throttled.

209
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:11,440
You know, they're not pushing the throttle to the maximum.

210
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:16,600
They're not whatever rendering video or compiling two files of Swift and Xcode.

211
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:21,260
They're like responding to an email or writing an invoice or doing something like that, right?

212
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:24,120
So those were your efficiency cores come in.

213
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:26,840
I'm assuming he's doing some AI stuff.

214
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:31,520
You could probably have like, and this is what the M1s do, you have like special performance

215
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:34,080
cores, but like some are better for like graphical stuff.

216
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:37,000
The neural engine cores are good for that kind of thing.

217
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:42,840
There's raw high power cores for straight up like compiling throughput, that's not bad.

218
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:48,480
I think everybody's going to have to do this and this is probably going to be the trend

219
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,720
in hardware for the next five issues.

220
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:53,400
Yeah, I totally agree.

221
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:59,680
And I would have to imagine that during this transition, or maybe even after it's normal,

222
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:04,800
there's going to be a lot of, well, this CPU can do this workload and this CPU is best

223
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:10,480
for this workload and it's going to make comparing and contrasting these devices much, much more

224
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:15,100
complicated and it really is going to force people to double down on that.

225
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:19,480
It's a tool and sometimes you buy this tool for this type of job and you buy this tool

226
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,080
for this other type of job.

227
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:23,400
We're already seeing that with the new M1s, right?

228
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:28,560
That for the most part, unless you are doing something rendering video or some other kind

229
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:33,920
of like high intensity graphical work, you probably don't want the max, right?

230
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:38,160
If you're like even like a high end fancy coffee dev, you know, who's just like likes

231
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,160
pretty things.

232
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:40,280
I don't know anybody like that.

233
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:42,800
The pro is going to be more than sufficient for you.

234
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:43,880
Very much so.

235
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:44,880
I got the max.

236
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,360
Yeah, but you do media stuff, right?

237
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:49,440
I do, but I bet I could have got by with the pro.

238
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,080
I really feel that way.

239
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:53,280
I'm not even shitting you.

240
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:55,960
I still haven't heard the fans in this thing.

241
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:56,960
I still haven't.

242
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:59,440
I'm not easy on it, right?

243
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:05,040
I mean, I've got a lot going on, not to mention about 20 Chrome instances.

244
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:08,080
I mean, it's really it's very impressive.

245
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,880
If you want to tax it, just compile.

246
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:13,480
I'll send you a repo, compile some Swift and open 20 Chrome instances.

247
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:14,640
And there you go.

248
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:17,960
I am telling you, I have never in my life experienced a situation where I have bought

249
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:21,000
a new computer and been basically unable to max it out.

250
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,640
I mean, I'm sure I could if I made an artificial workload.

251
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:26,280
Oh, yeah, you could like whatever, right?

252
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:27,880
Like DaVinci yourself to death.

253
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:28,880
Yeah.

254
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,000
I could do with something.

255
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,200
But in my actual workload, this has never happened to me before.

256
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,680
It's like there's just more machine.

257
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:38,740
It always has more to give deal with the dumbfounding thing about this whole conversation is I feel

258
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:42,340
exactly like you feel about my M1 air.

259
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:47,440
It's basically toe to toe with my other than the big, big, big asterisks of I have no good

260
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:51,440
way to run Windows x86 because I need Visual Studio.

261
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:56,560
The reason I didn't buy a pro was I just couldn't justify it with how I mean, the air, the battery.

262
00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:00,880
No, today I was driving around all morning, it was just errands and I had to do some work

263
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:01,880
in Plant City.

264
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:06,000
I didn't even think last night if my air was charged because it's the air.

265
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
It's always charged and it doesn't matter.

266
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Yeah.

267
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,640
Likewise, when I was stuck in the woods a couple of weeks ago, I didn't plan to do any

268
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:14,640
shows from out there.

269
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:18,400
So I had to cobble together kind of like an emergency setup that I have.

270
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:27,360
And the M1 Mac Mini did the job that I'm not kidding you, three x86 PCs do in the studio.

271
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:31,520
I did it with one Mac Mini and it did it sipping power.

272
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:33,800
I think, you know, 25 watts of power.

273
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:38,500
I can't actually understand it because it's that scale of a change.

274
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:41,920
And that's the damn mini because I didn't even have my laptop with me because I didn't

275
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,820
plan to be out there working.

276
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:48,140
So I had to do it all on the mini and it does it fine.

277
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:52,280
Now that is a situation where I'm near the limits of the machine, but I have not yet

278
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:53,520
reached the limits of the machine.

279
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:55,040
But that just kind of shows you the runway.

280
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,040
All right.

281
00:13:56,040 --> 00:14:01,020
So here's what Jacob is doing with those neural cores that sounds really awesome to me.

282
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:06,960
He is running Topaz in the background and he has it chewing over, see if he can see

283
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:07,960
it.

284
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:14,800
It's called Topaz AI Video and it's an enhancement tool that he is bringing in old low res home

285
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:21,400
movies and then this AI upscaler is converting them from 480i to higher resolution and frame

286
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:24,880
rates to look better on his new displays and stuff.

287
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:25,880
Super neat.

288
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:26,880
Well, OK, then.

289
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:27,880
Yeah.

290
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:31,080
And doesn't that seem like the perfect kind of use case for the neural engine?

291
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,080
Definitely.

292
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:34,740
That actually seems like something they probably designed it for.

293
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:40,800
If you guys have any M1 workload tips or great Mac apps that we missed or Windows or Linux

294
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,720
apps, always welcome as well.

295
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,400
Coder dot show slash contact.

296
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:47,080
And our last email today comes in from Jack.

297
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:48,080
Just a quick one, really.

298
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:52,000
He wants to know if you've really had any passing thoughts.

299
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,640
At Flutter, if you've given it a try or have any thoughts on it, because he is thinking

300
00:14:55,640 --> 00:15:00,400
about making a move, especially given the recent announcement from Canonical and their

301
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:04,200
use of Flutter and of course, Flutter's use in Fuchsia.

302
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:10,120
And as a web developer, he started working on a mobile app and realized, geez, Dart and

303
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:12,160
Flutter could be a great solution here for us.

304
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:14,840
So he wanted to know if you had any thoughts on using Flutter.

305
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:17,600
Yeah, we even discussed it on the show, right?

306
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:21,560
And on the Mike Dominic show way back when I interviewed somebody from the Flutter team,

307
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:25,240
I think Chris, I don't recall the last name, I apologize.

308
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:30,040
It's certainly a good framework if you're familiar with that type of development.

309
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:34,780
You know, I ended up not using it because when I was really deep into mobile, I was

310
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:40,480
mostly doing Ionic, which for those who don't know is basically a well, now you could do

311
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:41,480
more.

312
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:43,820
It has Angular and some custom components.

313
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:46,560
Now I think it does view and react as well.

314
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:51,480
I'll be honest, I have a little bit of Google killed my reader PTSD.

315
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:54,760
Basically every product I've liked from Google, they've killed.

316
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:57,880
And when I say every, I mean, except for Gmail.

317
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:00,820
So I did not choose Flutter.

318
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:02,320
Having said that, Flutter has been around.

319
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:06,640
I see a lot of jobs go by like contract jobs that are for Flutter.

320
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:11,980
I would say it's certainly taken a pretty serious place in the, you know, I want a cross

321
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:17,880
platform platform business mobile app world, probably on par with Xamarin.

322
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:21,360
And you know, Xamarin has a good habit of shooting themselves in the face.

323
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:24,960
What do you think of Google being the big effort behind it, the big energy instead of

324
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:27,240
somebody like Microsoft or Apple?

325
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:31,780
You'd have to go back like a hundred episodes or something, but I was kind of not understanding

326
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:37,240
why Flutter had to use Dart instead of like JavaScript or TypeScript.

327
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:40,640
It's kind of off doing its own magical little thing.

328
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:42,240
And this ties into your question.

329
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,500
And that I think the reason for that is Google made it.

330
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:45,500
That's what I was thinking.

331
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:49,120
You know, there was this weird time a couple of years ago where like, and I really do think

332
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:53,120
it was not to get back to Apple, cause I know people hate that, that Apple envy of Apple

333
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:59,240
released Swift and Google felt a lot of pressure to kind of do its own thing, right?

334
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:05,040
I mean, especially at that point in time, the narrative around Android using Java was

335
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:09,700
really at its peak bad because there was several solutions that Google had yet to roll out

336
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:11,320
to improve the situation.

337
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:15,520
So this is where things get weird because they adopted Kotlin from JetBrains for Java.

338
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:16,520
Yes.

339
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:18,960
And Google also, I believe, invented Angular.

340
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:24,100
It's like, it's so weird to me that, you know, Ionic is this like relatively small company

341
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:29,240
that already had Angular running as a really good, if you just want like line of business

342
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:34,880
applications, cross-platform mobile development solution based on the open web and Angular.

343
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:38,080
I always thought it was funny that Google didn't like, I don't know, just eat them,

344
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:39,080
right?

345
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:42,160
Just like buy them or help them in some way.

346
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:45,100
Cause their whole business is they have like an enterprise plan and you can pay them to

347
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:48,400
like co-sign your apps for you and all this kind of stuff.

348
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,880
But I don't know, I guess I would turn the question around and be like, and say, all

349
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:54,760
right, other than Flutter, where am I going to use Dart?

350
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:56,120
And you could say the same thing about Swift, right?

351
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:57,120
Other than iOS.

352
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:02,040
I was going to argue with you on that last point, but I think you're probably right.

353
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:06,400
Especially when you consider outside of some of these canonical and Google projects.

354
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,840
Google and canonical.

355
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:11,640
That's like the Jack the Ripper and Ted Bundy of killing things.

356
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:17,000
I'm not sure that I would necessarily base any major risk on that.

357
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Sorry.

358
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,880
I mean, how the hell does Google ever solve this problem?

359
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,680
I'm still mad about what the hell was it?

360
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:25,680
Not Google work.

361
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:26,680
Google.

362
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:27,680
Wave.

363
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:28,680
Wave.

364
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:29,680
Thank you.

365
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:30,680
The one I'm always bitching about.

366
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:31,680
Wave.

367
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:32,680
That's because we, I think for just a brief minute, I know we did it with some of the

368
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:33,680
shows.

369
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:34,680
We probably did it with Coder.

370
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:35,680
We experimented with using it.

371
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:36,680
We had a wave.

372
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:37,680
Yep.

373
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:38,680
And it was actually really useful for show prep.

374
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:39,680
It's like what Slack should be.

375
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:40,680
Oh, right.

376
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:41,680
It was before Slack.

377
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:43,240
It was way before Slack.

378
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:44,240
Right.

379
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:48,880
Because Slack has yet to like hit 10% of what wave was and Google was like, nah, no, we're

380
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:49,880
done.

381
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:50,880
We're done.

382
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:51,880
We're done.

383
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:54,800
It's, it's been a year and you know how we are.

384
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:58,200
We can't take it.

385
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:59,640
Linode.com slash Coder.

386
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:03,720
Go there to get $100 in 60 day credit on a new account and you go there to support the

387
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:04,720
show.

388
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,360
Linode is fast and reliable cloud hosting.

389
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:07,360
Full stop.

390
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:09,840
Just use it for your next project and see what I'm talking about.

391
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,840
It's always what I use for my projects.

392
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:17,800
Everything I've built for the last couple of years, it's been on Linode and easily Linode

393
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:19,200
just keeps getting better.

394
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:23,000
I mean, it's not, it's not even a contest when you look at the other folks out there.

395
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,880
Linode is constantly pushing the envelope for performance.

396
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:27,460
That's one of the reasons I love them.

397
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:31,280
And they've just rolled out game changing MVME PCIe storage.

398
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,800
They have AMD epic processors.

399
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:37,720
They are their own ISP.

400
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:38,720
You see what I'm saying?

401
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:39,720
It's, it's ridiculous.

402
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:45,300
So if you're a performance hound, man, the reasons to use Linode are just obvious, but

403
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:48,840
maybe, maybe you're a little more practical.

404
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:51,640
Maybe you pick things because they're well priced.

405
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:53,480
Maybe you pick things because they're well supported.

406
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:55,640
Well, Linode checks those boxes too.

407
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:57,240
They've been doing this for 18 years.

408
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:00,720
So over that time they've had to figure out how to get it right and they've remained the

409
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:03,480
largest independent cloud provider in the world.

410
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:08,580
In fact, I would encourage you to consider Linode for a multi-cloud strategy.

411
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:12,680
Maybe you've already got some infrastructure on some of the big hyperscalers.

412
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:16,320
Well Linode's 30 to 50% cheaper than those hyperscalers.

413
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:19,840
Maybe there's a bit of your infrastructure that would be a little better off in a multi-cloud

414
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:20,840
environment.

415
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:25,680
A lot of companies are doing that over 2022 and Linode is one of the best out there.

416
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:29,680
They have a white paper on their site that looks at an analysis of the market when you're

417
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:31,680
in a multi-cloud setup.

418
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:35,880
It could help you figure out some of the real numbers behind a move like this.

419
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:40,880
And I hear from our listeners all the time that when it really matters, Linode's customer

420
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:43,180
support comes through.

421
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:45,880
There's no forwarding you to the next tier.

422
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:49,520
Let me put you on hold while I check with my supervisor.

423
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,320
That's not how they work over there.

424
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:56,120
You call them, you send a ticket in, however you like to work, they get somebody on it

425
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:58,520
24-7 and they take care of you.

426
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:01,440
On top of that, they've got 11 data centers around the world for you to choose from.

427
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:06,360
They have object storage, cloud firewall, backups, and a lot more.

428
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:11,400
So go build something, go learn something, try it for yourself, and support the show.

429
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,560
Linode.com slash coder.

430
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:16,520
Get $100 in 60-day credit and kick the tires for yourself.

431
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:21,680
Linode.com slash coder.

432
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:26,360
Well the story that probably got sent to me the most this week is this developer who corrupted

433
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:30,680
that MPM library that, it's two actually, Colors and Faker.

434
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:31,680
My homie.

435
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:32,920
I love this.

436
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:36,760
This is some gangster ass right here.

437
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:37,760
That's what's up.

438
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:40,860
I mean, I feel real bad for people, but okay, here's the highlights.

439
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:47,220
This first random bleeping computer, they found that two libraries that a specific developer

440
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:50,760
was responsible for had new commits.

441
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:57,000
He added the quote, new American flag module to colors.js yesterday or the day before as

442
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
we're recording.

443
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Yes.

444
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,560
Then pushed it up to GitHub and MPM.

445
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:05,980
They were sabotaged and it ended up doing a loop output of strange letters and symbols

446
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:12,240
that began with texts that reads Liberty, Liberty, Liberty, and then loops over and

447
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,240
over again.

448
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:20,320
Now to put this in perspective, Faker.js sees nearly 2.5 million weekly downloads on MPM

449
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:28,420
and Color.js gets about 22.4 million downloads per week.

450
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:30,400
This is not small stuff.

451
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:34,020
It's baked into some of the Amazon cloud development kits.

452
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:38,120
So some of the very first reports came from Amazon cloud developers.

453
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:44,420
It seems the reason behind the quote mischief as bleeping computer puts it is that the developer

454
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:50,600
was retaliating against mega corporations and commercial consumers of open source projects

455
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:55,800
who extensively rely on cost free and community powered software, but do not, according to

456
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:58,500
that developer, give back to the community.

457
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:03,020
In November of 2020, the developer warned that he would no longer be supporting the

458
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:08,140
big corporations with his quote free work and that commercial entities should consider

459
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:14,640
either forking the projects or compensating the dev with a yearly quote six figure salary.

460
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:20,220
He says, quote, respectfully, I'm no longer going to support Fortune 500 and other small

461
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:22,520
sized companies with my free work.

462
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:26,320
There just isn't much else to say, end quote.

463
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:32,680
And fast forward about a year and a couple of months and it's American flag module time

464
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:37,840
and liberty, liberty, liberty and a bunch of looping crazy output that developers had

465
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:40,340
no idea where it was coming from.

466
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:44,840
And the internet is split right down the middle on this one.

467
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:49,120
Some in the open source community are calling him a hero, bringing attention to a desperate

468
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:54,280
cause and others are calling him essentially a software terrorist that should be banned.

469
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:55,360
Where do you lie?

470
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:57,520
So there's more to the story, right?

471
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:00,660
Before we before we land on all right, yeah, fill in more.

472
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:05,720
So MPM reverted the change he made and then GitHub suspended his account, right?

473
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:07,640
He also has like 100 private repos.

474
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:10,680
Now I am looking at his account right now.

475
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:12,200
It appears to be up.

476
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:16,440
It would be great to get some confirmation is when they say this is they suspended his

477
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:20,360
access, but they left it up so that other people can use this private repos.

478
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:21,880
That seems super.

479
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:23,800
Also like where is the line there?

480
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:24,800
Also it's his.

481
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:25,800
Right?

482
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:27,720
Does he not have the right to destroy his own stuff?

483
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:28,720
Apparently not.

484
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:33,440
Apparently he has the right to use the service as long as he's being a good boy that's productive

485
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,600
that corporate America could make money off of.

486
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:39,800
But the moment he starts creating something unproductive, they block him.

487
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:42,040
Yeah, it's pretty hard to see it any other way.

488
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:45,800
Now sure, he's doing malicious stuff and they probably want to take actions to ensure the

489
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:47,980
trust in their own platform.

490
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:52,900
But man, shutting him down like this and not giving him access to now his own stuff.

491
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:56,640
It really reminds you why if something really matters to you on the Internet, you need to

492
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:57,840
host it yourself.

493
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:00,960
Just like my GitLab instance, you just do it yourself guys.

494
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:01,960
Yeah.

495
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:02,960
Interesting.

496
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,880
There's an interesting couple of meta layers to this, I think.

497
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:10,560
I mean, you do have the people that are saying he's like, you know, a flame out kind of punk.

498
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:13,520
Essentially software terrorism is what some people are saying on Twitter.

499
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:17,800
And then you have the other side that says it's getting to be a desperate situation.

500
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:19,920
He had a plea for help.

501
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,920
Nobody stepped up.

502
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,040
What is he going to do?

503
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:26,980
And you got to figure like, there's probably a pretty considerable emotional strain for

504
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:29,040
somebody in this situation.

505
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:33,640
They are on the verge of burnout constantly.

506
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:35,080
They're struggling financially.

507
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:38,360
They probably can't get their life together because they're torn between too many different

508
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:39,360
priorities.

509
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:42,080
I mean, you could really kind of see how this person may have been going through a year

510
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:43,960
and change of health.

511
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:46,680
And this was sort of a breaking point for them.

512
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:48,240
And I have a hard time getting angry at them.

513
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:50,920
Yeah, no, I'm totally like on the side of this dude.

514
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:55,480
We have come close to this and I know that with all the Mac love and all that stuff,

515
00:25:55,480 --> 00:26:00,200
it's going to be, oh, we're going to get some bad feedback, but the current model of open

516
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:03,260
source just isn't working right.

517
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:10,340
This guy, his package underpins so many projects and he doesn't make a dime.

518
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:12,880
And then he goes and says, hey, and somebody needs to pay me.

519
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:18,840
And because there is no legal obligation to pay for his labor, he just, it's crickets.

520
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:24,840
And let's not forget, like one of the more popular ways that this stuff is used is in

521
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:30,760
the Amazon web development kit, which is something that Amazon puts together to make it easier

522
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:34,740
for developers to create applications on their platform so they can make money.

523
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:36,760
So Amazon can make money.

524
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:38,060
Let's not confuse this at all.

525
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:42,820
The entire reason a company like Amazon puts together a well done SDK is to make it approachable

526
00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:43,820
by developers.

527
00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:46,280
Well, why do they want to make it approachable by developers?

528
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:48,640
So they can make money.

529
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:52,600
I mean, I don't know what to say and I don't know this guy from Adam.

530
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:59,580
He maybe has some other crazy ideas, who the hell knows, but the argument at hand of should

531
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:04,700
people be giving multibillion dollar corporations their labor for free.

532
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:08,400
And I know we're going to get a lot of for this, but wasn't it just like two months ago,

533
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:12,420
people were yelling at us for being rapacious capitalists, right?

534
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:15,860
And I'm basically here picking up my hammer and sickle and be like, no, I don't care if

535
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:19,180
this dude did it in kind of a douchebaggy way.

536
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:20,180
The man is right.

537
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:21,280
He needs to be paid.

538
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:25,140
The lesson I learned from this, or I would suggest, I mean, I already knew this, but

539
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:30,420
I would suggest that younger folks maybe pick up ideals are great until you have to pay

540
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:33,780
the rent and your kid needs the doctor, right?

541
00:27:33,780 --> 00:27:39,460
I'm always banging the open core drum, but honestly, it's easier just to be proprietary.

542
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:44,820
How many times have you read on Reddit or have you covered on your other shows and end

543
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:45,820
this show?

544
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:50,140
Oh, there's some open source project, but the developers stressed out.

545
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:52,100
So he's just, you know, he's looking for money.

546
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:53,100
He's doing a patron.

547
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:58,060
Now he's going to chuck deuces and the project is screwed and people are screwed over.

548
00:27:58,060 --> 00:28:03,700
The solution to that is the richer organizations using these projects need to pay him.

549
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:05,700
And the answer isn't some tip jar.

550
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:09,600
It isn't a sponsor button on GitHub, which by the way, is a centralized platform owned

551
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:10,600
by Microsoft guys.

552
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:11,600
So again, nice.

553
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:13,100
You guys make a lot of sense.

554
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:15,700
Yeah, he would have been screwed if that was his funding model right now.

555
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:16,700
Yeah.

556
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:18,380
I hope he had a self hosted.

557
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:23,580
I mean, more and more I'm becoming like a live in the woods with the lady jubes, right?

558
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:29,260
And just self self host everything because it's getting to the point of what if this

559
00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:34,740
guy, I don't know what this guy does financially, but he says he has 100 private repos.

560
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:37,340
What if they're like repos for clients?

561
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:42,460
Is he going to just get his ass suited to oblivion because he not only cannot do the

562
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:47,980
work for them now, if he doesn't have another local backup, their IP is just lost in this

563
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:50,020
weird terms of service violation.

564
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:54,660
And by the way, what possible terms of service could there be that says you cannot alter

565
00:28:54,660 --> 00:29:00,180
code that you own the copyright for, even if the alteration affects other people?

566
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:05,340
Every open source license I've seen says this code is provided as is with absolutely no

567
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:06,340
warranty.

568
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:10,540
If you've ever booted up a Debian or Ubuntu box, that's what it says right there.

569
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:12,740
I'm struck by those questions.

570
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:18,460
I'm sure GitHub probably has answers, but I would imagine it comes down to people saw

571
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:19,620
this as a GitHub issue.

572
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:24,400
If you look at the trajectory of tickets that came in after this commit was made, it was

573
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:27,980
Amazon cloud developers asking GitHub what's wrong.

574
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:32,700
That's that's so I think that may have been like the beginning context from which they

575
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:33,700
worked from.

576
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:36,380
I remember GitHub is Microsoft.

577
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:40,620
It still feels like Microsoft and Amazon want this to shut up and go away.

578
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:42,760
I have a broader thought on this.

579
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:47,260
When you look at what what how these tools like we have to acknowledge that this isn't

580
00:29:47,260 --> 00:29:52,580
also the shadow of log4j that we're still dealing with right now.

581
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:55,860
Listeners of this show are still sorting through log4j.

582
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:56,900
For sure, for sure.

583
00:29:56,900 --> 00:30:03,900
I look at some of these these lower level tools and libraries as infrastructure code.

584
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:11,660
As a business, I pay taxes to my local city and that helps pave the roads, make sure that

585
00:30:11,660 --> 00:30:14,220
people can actually get to the business.

586
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:15,460
It's sort of that basic stuff.

587
00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:20,620
I pay taxes to my city and the city takes care of some of the things that make it possible

588
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:23,180
for me to have a business.

589
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:26,820
We need to think about this infrastructure code in sort of a similar thing.

590
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:36,020
It's not that this developer is due some percentage of Amazon's revenues, but at the same time

591
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:41,600
he's paving the roads that Amazon's trucks are driving on in the cloud and he should

592
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:43,140
get something for that.

593
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:49,220
We've got to think about this in a way that is actually going to solve the problem.

594
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:54,740
I see one large obstacle that I can't really figure out a way to route around because I

595
00:30:54,740 --> 00:31:02,660
think it's too late and I think it's also this phenomenon, this issue has created a

596
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:06,740
distorted market for Linux and free software development.

597
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:09,660
So let me back up one more time and then I'll explain all what I'm talking about.

598
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:15,020
I would describe free software development as a very organic process.

599
00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:19,660
You can have lots of forks, many different people trying the same thing and over a 20

600
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:24,940
year time period, the strongest survive, things sort of shake out.

601
00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:29,620
You look back at the last, you know, 15, 20 years of Linux and free software, that's clearly

602
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:30,940
the case.

603
00:31:30,940 --> 00:31:35,940
It's often an area of in present day, an area of complaint and criticism.

604
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:40,600
Oh, there's so many desktop environments or we have so many ways of doing X, but then

605
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:46,780
as time moves on, organically things either come together or the strongest survive.

606
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:50,380
It's a lot like evolution, free software development.

607
00:31:50,380 --> 00:31:59,540
When the cloud became the obvious money maker in Linux, we started to have a centralization

608
00:31:59,540 --> 00:32:01,540
of resources.

609
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:09,700
We started to have some development become very, very lucrative and other kinds of development

610
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:13,180
that, quote, have no money in it.

611
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:18,860
We started to see this management of the ecosystem.

612
00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:24,060
We started to see a third party declare some projects winners by financing them and others

613
00:32:24,060 --> 00:32:27,180
losers by ignoring them.

614
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:30,540
And this of course is the Linux Foundation.

615
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:37,300
The Linux Foundation has added significant centralization to what was a totally organic

616
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:41,220
ecosystem and they've picked winners and losers.

617
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:46,860
And because they are human and they have limits, they can't find every little infrastructure

618
00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:52,460
project that's popular on MPM or somewhere else in the ecosystem and slide a foundation

619
00:32:52,460 --> 00:32:54,160
underneath them and help support them.

620
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:56,220
It's just an impossible task.

621
00:32:56,220 --> 00:32:59,580
But because that's where all the money is centralized and you look at all these large

622
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:05,020
commercial companies from Dell to Amazon that are all members, all paying members of the

623
00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:08,360
Linux Foundation, that's where their money is going.

624
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:12,180
It's not going to open collective, it's not going to build out a digital payment system

625
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:16,840
that rewards developers based on their contributions to a project, none of that.

626
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:21,120
It's going to the Linux Foundation, they're picking the winners and the losers.

627
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:28,340
And because their scope can only be so wide, we keep having these log4js or colors.js or

628
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:33,460
whatever it might be that get screwed and left out because they just weren't in the

629
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:36,820
purvey of the all carrying Linux Foundation.

630
00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:41,800
And it also has distorted the economics of free software development such that really

631
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:47,460
the only place to make money is wherever these corporations that are part of the Linux Foundation

632
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:50,780
are presently interested in, which is often like the cloud right now or something like

633
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:51,780
that.

634
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:55,880
And outside of that, nothing pays in Linux and in free software.

635
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:59,180
You could argue it's good in some ways because at least some people are getting paid and

636
00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:04,220
there's at least a foundation that's orchestrating some of this, but with the good, there always

637
00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:05,480
comes the bad.

638
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:11,500
And I believe, having watched all of this for a while, that's the bad, is we've kind

639
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:16,320
of done a go-all-in, one-size-fits-all solution with the Linux Foundation now, which has become

640
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:21,860
massive, and we've centralized resources.

641
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:23,500
And I think this kind of thing is the result.

642
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:26,140
And I don't think we can solve that, to be honest with you.

643
00:34:26,140 --> 00:34:28,900
I think that ship has sailed in Linux land.

644
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:34,540
The world has changed so much from the founding of, I can't even pronounce it, Gnusys, where

645
00:34:34,540 --> 00:34:35,540
was it?

646
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:37,860
They were a contemporary of original Red Hat.

647
00:34:37,860 --> 00:34:38,860
Oh, geez.

648
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:39,860
I don't remember.

649
00:34:39,860 --> 00:34:40,860
I don't remember how they pronounce it.

650
00:34:40,860 --> 00:34:42,520
It's like some play on GNU.

651
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:49,460
And those few companies that were working in open source and weirdly, it was a community.

652
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:54,860
They were competitors in some ways, but since they were all working on the core Linux project

653
00:34:54,860 --> 00:35:00,380
or certain core projects, like the C compiler, it was a community of these little companies

654
00:35:00,380 --> 00:35:01,660
that could all work together in individuals.

655
00:35:01,660 --> 00:35:03,140
And it was great.

656
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:04,940
People had ways to make money.

657
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:07,860
And in particular, that was setting up like web service hosting.

658
00:35:07,860 --> 00:35:12,780
Now with the cloud, I know people are going to hate this, it is effectively free labor

659
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:15,300
for these huge companies.

660
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:16,300
It just is.

661
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:18,260
Do the results seem to speak for themselves, don't they?

662
00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:19,260
Right.

663
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:21,260
They get to charge you for the cloud server.

664
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:25,660
And I've read the feedback, I've read the tweets, I've read the hacker news.

665
00:35:25,660 --> 00:35:28,860
This guy does not need to be the most savory guy on the planet.

666
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:34,180
In fact, he can kind of be someone that maybe I wouldn't want to get a beer with, right?

667
00:35:34,180 --> 00:35:36,540
To actually be correct in his argument.

668
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:38,300
Yeah, those two things can be true.

669
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:44,700
People who maybe are slightly unpleasant can also be correct.

670
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:47,340
So his method, I don't know if I agree with it.

671
00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:52,780
Some of his kind of other things about like Aaron Schwartz and stuff I've read of his,

672
00:35:52,780 --> 00:35:56,020
I definitely wouldn't go down that track with him.

673
00:35:56,020 --> 00:36:02,500
But this, this problem is real and it's also real for tens of thousands, if not hundreds

674
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:07,820
of thousands of other developers who have written projects that are day-to-day important

675
00:36:07,820 --> 00:36:12,100
to these multi-billion dollar corporations and get diddly squat for it.

676
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:16,620
And I acknowledge if we were working on a project and we woke up one morning and Liberty,

677
00:36:16,620 --> 00:36:19,940
Liberty, Liberty was scrolling across the screen in an infinite loop, that'd be very

678
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:20,940
frustrating.

679
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:21,940
Oh, I'd be super mad.

680
00:36:21,940 --> 00:36:23,140
But it's not an impossible problem.

681
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:24,140
You can roll back.

682
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:25,980
And he had no real recourse either.

683
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:29,260
I mean, chiding Mike, you know, would be like, well, then maybe you shouldn't have made it

684
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:30,640
open source.

685
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:36,460
And then it wouldn't have gotten the adoption and you know, he wouldn't have people talking

686
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:37,460
about him on podcasts.

687
00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:38,460
Right?

688
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:39,460
That's true.

689
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:40,460
It worked.

690
00:36:40,460 --> 00:36:43,020
At some point it needs to turn into cheese for the kids.

691
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:44,020
That's all I'm saying.

692
00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:45,020
Right?

693
00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:46,240
It's got to turn into money.

694
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:51,740
And I really hope this doesn't turn into another, well, the culture and the ethos of the software

695
00:36:51,740 --> 00:36:53,620
development community are definitely changing.

696
00:36:53,620 --> 00:36:56,200
They've definitely been changing.

697
00:36:56,200 --> 00:37:02,660
And because this person carries himself apparently in a way that's definitely a little off with

698
00:37:02,660 --> 00:37:08,340
that, that we're going to just once again say, la de la de la, keep on making billions

699
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:14,860
AWS and, you know, Azure and Linux foundation, all those guys, screw the individual developer.

700
00:37:14,860 --> 00:37:17,420
Oh, well, he should have sold consulting.

701
00:37:17,420 --> 00:37:18,420
Right?

702
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:19,420
That's like always the answer.

703
00:37:19,420 --> 00:37:20,420
Well, you could be a consultant.

704
00:37:20,420 --> 00:37:22,660
What if you don't like want to be a consultant?

705
00:37:22,660 --> 00:37:28,260
Or if you don't want to go for AWS, what if because of his personality and how it's spoken

706
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:33,140
he is and perhaps controversial, he couldn't pass the Amazon interview, right?

707
00:37:33,140 --> 00:37:34,140
I could see that.

708
00:37:34,140 --> 00:37:35,140
Yeah.

709
00:37:35,140 --> 00:37:36,140
And it's still clearly valuable work.

710
00:37:36,140 --> 00:37:40,900
Also pin your damn version numbers and your, and your MPM builds and all your dependency

711
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:41,900
management stuff.

712
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:46,540
I was thinking that could be a whole angle we take on this is like, what the hell?

713
00:37:46,540 --> 00:37:47,540
Yeah.

714
00:37:47,540 --> 00:37:51,660
I understand you're upset and I would be super angry too, but this is kind of your fault

715
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:52,660
too.

716
00:37:52,660 --> 00:37:53,660
Yeah.

717
00:37:53,660 --> 00:37:54,660
That's why I figured maybe we shouldn't go too hard.

718
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:56,220
Cause like they've had a, they've had a bad day already.

719
00:37:56,220 --> 00:38:00,220
So you tell me not to go hard after you excoriate the Linux foundation.

720
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:01,220
Yeah.

721
00:38:01,220 --> 00:38:02,660
Well, you know, I've been, you just think about it.

722
00:38:02,660 --> 00:38:05,580
It seems like what's going on, you know, you centralize the power and the wealth.

723
00:38:05,580 --> 00:38:06,580
That's what happens.

724
00:38:06,580 --> 00:38:07,580
Comrades.

725
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:09,660
I will take any apology emails from the other month right now.

726
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:13,060
If you want to sell them.

727
00:38:13,060 --> 00:38:18,420
Hey, just for a limited time, we're going to have the random swag bags up at Jupiter

728
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:19,420
garage.

729
00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:22,580
We're going to clear a little bit so that way we can clear out and make room for new

730
00:38:22,580 --> 00:38:23,580
stuff.

731
00:38:23,580 --> 00:38:27,740
But we still have a few of the Jupiter rocket journals left.

732
00:38:27,740 --> 00:38:30,820
If you get a random swag bag, you can get one in there.

733
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:34,200
We have two colors and it's just kind of random which one you get, but you can also buy the

734
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:35,200
journal separately.

735
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:41,040
We still have a few actually probably about, well, I would say just under 15 left.

736
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:44,060
So there's enough out there for a few of you to, if you're, if you get this after the episodes

737
00:38:44,060 --> 00:38:48,020
come out, you can go grab them before we shut it down for a little bit.

738
00:38:48,020 --> 00:38:51,740
And you know, the fun way to do it is to get the random swag bag, cause then you get like

739
00:38:51,740 --> 00:38:56,100
stuff that we've got that are in the inventory for like stickers or maybe a shirt or maybe

740
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:57,620
a few things like that.

741
00:38:57,620 --> 00:39:04,520
It works out to be a pretty good value and it's all up at Jupiter garage.com.

742
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:06,180
The feedback on this is going to be amazing.

743
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:10,820
This is going to be a rough episode for that poor, for the poor fireside email.

744
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:11,820
I know.

745
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:15,020
I decided to bedazzle my soapbox to make it nice and special.

746
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:17,460
Is it blue bedazzled perhaps blue and green?

747
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:18,460
Yeah.

748
00:39:18,460 --> 00:39:19,460
Oh, green.

749
00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:20,460
Yeah.

750
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:21,460
The green ones I got to get rid of.

751
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:22,460
Yeah.

752
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:28,580
So the wall street journal wrote a piece this week that is a real, a real stinker.

753
00:39:28,580 --> 00:39:29,860
I just hate this.

754
00:39:29,860 --> 00:39:38,340
It's teens dread the green text bubble and it's all about how it's a form of phone elitism

755
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:40,700
because they have blue message bubbles.

756
00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:48,220
And then in a really gross way, Google's official Android account on Twitter tweeted the following

757
00:39:48,220 --> 00:39:53,020
after the article was posted, sort of like doubling down on the opportunity quote, I

758
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:57,860
message should not benefit from bullying.

759
00:39:57,860 --> 00:40:02,660
Texting should bring us together and the solution exists.

760
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:04,940
Let's fix this as one industry.

761
00:40:04,940 --> 00:40:06,980
And then two heart emojis.

762
00:40:06,980 --> 00:40:12,980
What's wrong with us where we consider blue and green bubbles and text message at a form

763
00:40:12,980 --> 00:40:13,980
of bullying.

764
00:40:13,980 --> 00:40:16,120
Now what is going on?

765
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:20,060
If you are a teenage listener of this show, please do you need parental permission?

766
00:40:20,060 --> 00:40:21,060
I don't know.

767
00:40:21,060 --> 00:40:22,060
I don't know how that works.

768
00:40:22,060 --> 00:40:23,060
I guess.

769
00:40:23,060 --> 00:40:24,060
Get it.

770
00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:29,660
Email in if you're sitting in a dark room crying because you are sending green bubbles

771
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:30,660
to people.

772
00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:31,660
Is this serious?

773
00:40:31,660 --> 00:40:32,900
Is this serious?

774
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:34,020
I know.

775
00:40:34,020 --> 00:40:39,540
And what I mean, you know, it really upsets me about it is that Google has created this

776
00:40:39,540 --> 00:40:41,540
problem.

777
00:40:41,540 --> 00:40:47,700
Google currently runs by my count eight different messaging service and they're all bad.

778
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:48,700
They're all bad.

779
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:50,900
And that's not even counting duo and their video.

780
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:52,540
I'm saying just text messaging.

781
00:40:52,540 --> 00:40:55,860
Do you know what wasn't bad wave?

782
00:40:55,860 --> 00:41:00,040
I know they're pushing RCS now, but RCS is not a global standard.

783
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:01,460
I think it's here in the States.

784
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:03,540
I think it's in Australia.

785
00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:04,540
And that might be it.

786
00:41:04,540 --> 00:41:05,540
I don't know.

787
00:41:05,540 --> 00:41:06,540
It might be in Canada.

788
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:10,340
You can't switch an entire platform to a standard that does not exist.

789
00:41:10,340 --> 00:41:12,260
No, you can do it like twice a year.

790
00:41:12,260 --> 00:41:17,620
They've proven that I cannot believe that Google hasn't gotten this better.

791
00:41:17,620 --> 00:41:21,660
Like Google has too many messaging services has been a meme for four years now and it's

792
00:41:21,660 --> 00:41:22,700
only worse.

793
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:25,820
You know, they have a chat system inside Google photos.

794
00:41:25,820 --> 00:41:26,820
I sure do.

795
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:29,740
Did you know that they have a chat system inside Google Pay?

796
00:41:29,740 --> 00:41:30,740
I did not know that.

797
00:41:30,740 --> 00:41:34,260
There's also a chat, different chat system inside Google stadia Jesus.

798
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:37,140
And when you use Google assistant to send a message, that's a different system.

799
00:41:37,140 --> 00:41:39,380
Did they have one that was just like G chat?

800
00:41:39,380 --> 00:41:40,380
That's gone now.

801
00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:43,700
But Google chat and Hangouts is a different system.

802
00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:46,420
And then you've got text messages and RCS messages.

803
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:49,660
Did you know on the business side, it is now separate?

804
00:41:49,660 --> 00:41:53,180
They have like their weird slack clone and then there's like the regular chats.

805
00:41:53,180 --> 00:41:54,660
And I kept getting pings.

806
00:41:54,660 --> 00:41:58,540
I'm like, I don't, this guy says this comes up in Chrome.

807
00:41:58,540 --> 00:42:00,440
Like I don't, I don't see anything.

808
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:03,860
And sure enough, there's like a whole nother window now.

809
00:42:03,860 --> 00:42:06,400
It's just impressive how these get set.

810
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:08,220
So wall street journal runs this piece.

811
00:42:08,220 --> 00:42:09,700
That's clearly a piece of crap.

812
00:42:09,700 --> 00:42:13,580
Then the official Android account doubles down on it and you know, accuses Apple of

813
00:42:13,580 --> 00:42:20,080
bullying by locking people into iMessage when it's just, they implemented a good system.

814
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:22,420
You can go into the settings and turn off iMessage.

815
00:42:22,420 --> 00:42:28,020
You don't have to use it, but text messages, SMS sucks.

816
00:42:28,020 --> 00:42:29,020
It sucks.

817
00:42:29,020 --> 00:42:34,220
That's why Signal and Telegram and Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp are so fricking popular

818
00:42:34,220 --> 00:42:41,020
because text messages suck and Apple recognized that and build a solution into their platform.

819
00:42:41,020 --> 00:42:43,680
And then they saw this as a strategic moat.

820
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:49,980
Of course, of course, Google, on the other hand, boondoggled it.

821
00:42:49,980 --> 00:42:51,420
They screwed the pooch.

822
00:42:51,420 --> 00:42:55,280
They missed not one opportunity, but like eight opportunities.

823
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:59,360
And now they're out on Twitter calling Apple a bully over it.

824
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:03,460
They started with a perfectly good chat system that people liked.

825
00:43:03,460 --> 00:43:07,860
The only problem was it was open source and an open protocol and it could be interconnected

826
00:43:07,860 --> 00:43:08,860
with other systems.

827
00:43:08,860 --> 00:43:09,860
And Google-

828
00:43:09,860 --> 00:43:11,420
God forbid I could run it in Addium.

829
00:43:11,420 --> 00:43:12,860
They didn't want that.

830
00:43:12,860 --> 00:43:14,700
They had a system.

831
00:43:14,700 --> 00:43:20,100
Everybody liked it, but they got greedy and they've never figured it out since then.

832
00:43:20,100 --> 00:43:22,960
So I just want to correct you before you get sued.

833
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:27,780
Google is not accusing Apple of being a bully in this context.

834
00:43:27,780 --> 00:43:33,100
They are accusing Apple of arming the bullies of America to the teeth with these blue bubbles.

835
00:43:33,100 --> 00:43:36,700
Yeah, they're riffing on what the Wall Street Journal basically laid out, but yeah, that's

836
00:43:36,700 --> 00:43:37,700
exactly it.

837
00:43:37,700 --> 00:43:38,700
It's unbelievable.

838
00:43:38,700 --> 00:43:39,700
Yeah.

839
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:45,100
I mean, first of all, what journalist that works for the Wall Street Journal woke up

840
00:43:45,100 --> 00:43:47,380
and said, you know what?

841
00:43:47,380 --> 00:43:52,220
I think these bubbles on my iPhone and maybe they have a SIM.

842
00:43:52,220 --> 00:43:53,220
I do.

843
00:43:53,220 --> 00:43:54,220
I got it.

844
00:43:54,220 --> 00:43:56,220
Get the bacon.

845
00:43:56,220 --> 00:43:57,220
I've always got the bacon.

846
00:43:57,220 --> 00:43:58,220
I mean, get the bacon.

847
00:43:58,220 --> 00:43:59,220
I've always got the bacon.

848
00:43:59,220 --> 00:44:01,740
This is a plant.

849
00:44:01,740 --> 00:44:04,660
Windows Phone 11 is coming.

850
00:44:04,660 --> 00:44:05,660
This is what this is.

851
00:44:05,660 --> 00:44:09,020
They're going to get Apple and Google to destroy each other and then wait for it.

852
00:44:09,020 --> 00:44:16,860
MSN Messenger conquers all, runs the table on your beautiful Nokia Windows Phone.

853
00:44:16,860 --> 00:44:18,360
Actually, you know what?

854
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:21,420
If they had universal messaging, I might be okay with it.

855
00:44:21,420 --> 00:44:27,020
I still don't understand why I can't have Addium just like have all my messaging services.

856
00:44:27,020 --> 00:44:29,180
I mean, Addium is like deeply broken now.

857
00:44:29,180 --> 00:44:33,540
I think part of what tripped Google up is I think it was too late into the game.

858
00:44:33,540 --> 00:44:39,220
They realized they'd screwed up, you know, and what we need is a carrier solution like

859
00:44:39,220 --> 00:44:40,220
with RCS, right?

860
00:44:40,220 --> 00:44:43,060
Because you need something that's supported on the carrier side.

861
00:44:43,060 --> 00:44:46,040
But the only way they were ever going to get that to be successful is if they bake that

862
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:48,980
into the deal a long time ago with Android, right?

863
00:44:48,980 --> 00:44:53,080
And so there's this optimistic, let's get all of these horrible companies that are run

864
00:44:53,080 --> 00:44:57,980
by some of the worst assholes on the planet to accept this new standard around the world.

865
00:44:57,980 --> 00:44:58,980
The League of Evil.

866
00:44:58,980 --> 00:44:59,980
Yes.

867
00:44:59,980 --> 00:45:03,180
Or let's just build something into our own platform recognizing this is an issue that

868
00:45:03,180 --> 00:45:05,620
our users are going to clearly want.

869
00:45:05,620 --> 00:45:08,780
iMessage didn't start like this at the beginning, right?

870
00:45:08,780 --> 00:45:13,300
It was a real basic thing and Apple recognized it was something their users wanted and improved

871
00:45:13,300 --> 00:45:20,860
it over time and just continued to iterate on top of one messaging system, right?

872
00:45:20,860 --> 00:45:23,620
And it's clearly the difference in strategy that ended up winning.

873
00:45:23,620 --> 00:45:28,820
I'm always amazed with how whoever the biz dev person was that did the Verizon Android

874
00:45:28,820 --> 00:45:33,980
deal when Verizon was so clearly desperate for an iPhone competitor.

875
00:45:33,980 --> 00:45:34,980
Droid.

876
00:45:34,980 --> 00:45:38,100
How they failed with so much leverage.

877
00:45:38,100 --> 00:45:39,100
I know.

878
00:45:39,100 --> 00:45:44,580
It's so like, how do you not just walk into that meeting and basically, you know, put

879
00:45:44,580 --> 00:45:46,140
on a black turtleneck, wear your blue jeans.

880
00:45:46,140 --> 00:45:47,140
You got it.

881
00:45:47,140 --> 00:45:50,180
Cause of course you have to dress like Steve Jobs to do this and just like throw your briefcase

882
00:45:50,180 --> 00:45:51,180
on the table.

883
00:45:51,180 --> 00:45:52,180
Okay.

884
00:45:52,180 --> 00:45:53,180
You're Google.

885
00:45:53,180 --> 00:45:55,380
Throw your teenage appropriate book back on the table.

886
00:45:55,380 --> 00:45:56,660
Sorry guys.

887
00:45:56,660 --> 00:45:59,420
And just say here, dog, we want the same deal.

888
00:45:59,420 --> 00:46:02,980
Apple has an agency and if you don't take it, continue hemorrhaging customers and have

889
00:46:02,980 --> 00:46:03,980
fun.

890
00:46:03,980 --> 00:46:04,980
You know what it's gotta be?

891
00:46:04,980 --> 00:46:10,500
Cause if you look back at that original droid launch, which I had, it was terrible.

892
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:17,860
It was so focused on the star Wars branding, the red theme, the whole phone came in a red

893
00:46:17,860 --> 00:46:18,860
theme.

894
00:46:18,860 --> 00:46:19,860
Yeah.

895
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:20,860
But come on.

896
00:46:20,860 --> 00:46:26,100
I think they focused on app store and platform theming and didn't even think about the bigger

897
00:46:26,100 --> 00:46:28,580
picture things that clearly needed to get worked on.

898
00:46:28,580 --> 00:46:29,580
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

899
00:46:29,580 --> 00:46:34,940
They screwed up the actual tenants of a longterm deal because a star Wars film had come out

900
00:46:34,940 --> 00:46:38,380
and it just seemed like a great marketing opportunity, right?

901
00:46:38,380 --> 00:46:41,860
Star Wars has droids, Android sounds like droid.

902
00:46:41,860 --> 00:46:42,860
That's great.

903
00:46:42,860 --> 00:46:43,860
Right?

904
00:46:43,860 --> 00:46:46,900
And then you can make the whole phone theme red because Verizon's brand is red.

905
00:46:46,900 --> 00:46:48,380
What an opportunity.

906
00:46:48,380 --> 00:46:49,380
Okay.

907
00:46:49,380 --> 00:46:53,900
So what they needed to do, if they really had their heart set on this very temporary

908
00:46:53,900 --> 00:46:59,800
star Wars deal is contract George Lucas to be a consultant because I got to tell you,

909
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:05,540
if he had made the deal as poor, poor, sweet Paramount Pictures on the hard way, he would

910
00:47:05,540 --> 00:47:07,380
have got the better side of that deal.

911
00:47:07,380 --> 00:47:08,380
Probably.

912
00:47:08,380 --> 00:47:11,380
There's no way he would have been like, okay, so here's the deal.

913
00:47:11,380 --> 00:47:17,060
But also, can I just, before we wrap up on completely on this, like why not use the same

914
00:47:17,060 --> 00:47:19,500
chat system in all of these apps?

915
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:23,740
Like take advantage of the ecosystem like Microsoft does and Apple does, right?

916
00:47:23,740 --> 00:47:30,820
Why build messaging silos in each of your major consumer facing apps?

917
00:47:30,820 --> 00:47:31,820
Like what's the logic?

918
00:47:31,820 --> 00:47:33,620
Why wouldn't you have them cross connect?

919
00:47:33,620 --> 00:47:35,460
I actually think I know the answer.

920
00:47:35,460 --> 00:47:36,460
Okay.

921
00:47:36,460 --> 00:47:41,540
Remember the old meme of Microsoft as the Microsoft orgs as basically, you know, it

922
00:47:41,540 --> 00:47:44,980
was like seven guys with all guns pointed to each other's head.

923
00:47:44,980 --> 00:47:47,440
That's exactly what's going on at Google.

924
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:51,140
There's different managers and different executives for each of these services and everybody wants

925
00:47:51,140 --> 00:47:52,780
to rule the world, right?

926
00:47:52,780 --> 00:47:53,900
That's got to be it.

927
00:47:53,900 --> 00:47:54,900
That's it, right?

928
00:47:54,900 --> 00:47:59,360
Where at Apple, it's a straight up feudal system where it's like, hey, Uncle Tim wants

929
00:47:59,360 --> 00:48:00,460
this today.

930
00:48:00,460 --> 00:48:03,140
That just means there's weak leadership at Google because somebody should be sitting

931
00:48:03,140 --> 00:48:07,260
at the top going, I'm sorry to tell you Google Photos team, but you're never going to be

932
00:48:07,260 --> 00:48:11,180
the world leading messaging service, you know, or sorry, Google Stadia team, you're built

933
00:48:11,180 --> 00:48:14,180
in messaging platform that's private just to Stadia.

934
00:48:14,180 --> 00:48:17,060
That's never going to take off and, you know, take over the world.

935
00:48:17,060 --> 00:48:18,540
So scratch that idea.

936
00:48:18,540 --> 00:48:21,060
Let's just use the same back end chat system.

937
00:48:21,060 --> 00:48:24,620
That the other thing I was thinking of is the argument's got to be, well, people that

938
00:48:24,620 --> 00:48:29,560
are chatting about photos probably don't want to chat with people that are playing video

939
00:48:29,560 --> 00:48:30,560
games, right?

940
00:48:30,560 --> 00:48:33,600
They're two totally different workflows.

941
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:36,940
You could still interconnect them and have shared usernames across them and whatnot and

942
00:48:36,940 --> 00:48:37,940
ping each other.

943
00:48:37,940 --> 00:48:38,940
That doesn't make sense.

944
00:48:38,940 --> 00:48:39,940
No, that doesn't.

945
00:48:39,940 --> 00:48:44,460
I mean, you would have to restructure, let's just call it Google chat.

946
00:48:44,460 --> 00:48:45,460
Actually they did.

947
00:48:45,460 --> 00:48:49,500
That is what they used to call it and say, all right, Google chat, you guys are a whole

948
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:50,500
division.

949
00:48:50,500 --> 00:48:51,500
Let's talk.

950
00:48:51,500 --> 00:48:53,740
Nancy, you're the, you're the queen of Google chat, right?

951
00:48:53,740 --> 00:48:54,740
You got it.

952
00:48:54,740 --> 00:48:55,740
You're in.

953
00:48:55,740 --> 00:49:02,060
Your customers are the photos team, the, I mean Stadia, come on, but sure.

954
00:49:02,060 --> 00:49:07,100
The Stadia team, I guess the pay team and whatever ridiculous other services Google

955
00:49:07,100 --> 00:49:09,620
comes up with and then kills in three weeks.

956
00:49:09,620 --> 00:49:10,620
Those are your customers.

957
00:49:10,620 --> 00:49:17,500
You have to give them one protocol, one programming interface, and you build the chat product

958
00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:20,460
and they just, you know, they integrate it as they like it.

959
00:49:20,460 --> 00:49:21,660
Exactly.

960
00:49:21,660 --> 00:49:22,660
And that's it.

961
00:49:22,660 --> 00:49:27,500
And, and the cert, you, you can take feedback, but you're not making bespoke changes for,

962
00:49:27,500 --> 00:49:31,220
let's say photos wants to like do some weird image cropping stuff in chat.

963
00:49:31,220 --> 00:49:35,660
No, unless it's a unified rollout for all of chat, it doesn't happen.

964
00:49:35,660 --> 00:49:39,340
And if there's a dispute, well, that's why we have a hierarchy and we go to a meeting

965
00:49:39,340 --> 00:49:43,020
and it's corporate server, but it's passive aggressive, but eventually someone makes a

966
00:49:43,020 --> 00:49:44,020
decision.

967
00:49:44,020 --> 00:49:47,460
You know what I just described and Microsoft, that's how they do it.

968
00:49:47,460 --> 00:49:48,460
Right?

969
00:49:48,460 --> 00:49:53,820
There's a king of all things office at Microsoft and he does whatever the hell he wants until

970
00:49:53,820 --> 00:49:55,500
there's a conflict with another division.

971
00:49:55,500 --> 00:49:56,980
And then they resolve it up the chain.

972
00:49:56,980 --> 00:49:57,980
Yeah.

973
00:49:57,980 --> 00:50:00,440
Somebody up the chain resolves the fiefdom battle, right?

974
00:50:00,440 --> 00:50:03,980
That's what happens to somebody says, all right, well, I know you both have your ideas,

975
00:50:03,980 --> 00:50:06,460
but we're going to test it and then we're going to make a decision and we're going to

976
00:50:06,460 --> 00:50:07,460
go with one of them.

977
00:50:07,460 --> 00:50:09,960
Then everybody get the hell on board instead.

978
00:50:09,960 --> 00:50:12,900
What you have is at Google, everybody's creating their own little fiefdoms and their own little

979
00:50:12,900 --> 00:50:13,900
technology stack.

980
00:50:13,900 --> 00:50:17,140
Well, of course that becomes unsustainable and it's going to make Google more inclined

981
00:50:17,140 --> 00:50:20,340
to want to shut those projects down because of the overhead.

982
00:50:20,340 --> 00:50:21,340
Well, okay.

983
00:50:21,340 --> 00:50:28,100
Nothing can quench the bloodlust of Google killing products.

984
00:50:28,100 --> 00:50:29,540
Very true.

985
00:50:29,540 --> 00:50:31,500
That's probably just baked in, right?

986
00:50:31,500 --> 00:50:32,500
All right.

987
00:50:32,500 --> 00:50:33,760
Well, we'd love to get your feedback.

988
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:34,760
It's a new year.

989
00:50:34,760 --> 00:50:38,340
We want to get the feedback going and get some nice hot pipe and emails in there.

995
00:50:57,180 --> 00:51:01,580
You also as a thank you, get an ad free feed and the Coder Coderly, which we actually have

996
00:51:01,580 --> 00:51:02,980
to start thinking about again.

997
00:51:02,980 --> 00:51:03,980
Right?

998
00:51:03,980 --> 00:51:04,980
Right.

999
00:51:04,980 --> 00:51:05,980
Oh my gosh.

1000
00:51:05,980 --> 00:51:06,980
All right.

1001
00:51:06,980 --> 00:51:09,120
Well, we'll get our heads around that and then members get an access to that.

1002
00:51:09,120 --> 00:51:13,060
And if you want to support the entire network, get every show ad free plus Linux action news

1003
00:51:13,060 --> 00:51:14,940
is the only way to get that one at free.

1004
00:51:14,940 --> 00:51:17,420
You can find that at Jupiter.party.

1005
00:51:17,420 --> 00:51:20,420
Is there anywhere you want to send people this week before we wrap up?

1006
00:51:20,420 --> 00:51:21,420
You know what?

1007
00:51:21,420 --> 00:51:22,700
I'm so into the proletariat today.

1008
00:51:22,700 --> 00:51:24,100
I'm not going to be a vicious capitalist.

1009
00:51:24,100 --> 00:51:25,980
I would like to send you to get lab.com.

1010
00:51:25,980 --> 00:51:28,340
Go check out that open source self hosting guide.

1011
00:51:28,340 --> 00:51:29,340
Right.

1012
00:51:29,340 --> 00:51:30,340
Very good.

1013
00:51:30,340 --> 00:51:34,060
I'll be a bit self serving only to empower the listener.

1014
00:51:34,060 --> 00:51:36,060
So go to self hosted dot show.

1015
00:51:36,060 --> 00:51:37,760
Get all of our self hosted content.

1016
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:38,820
That's all over there.

1017
00:51:38,820 --> 00:51:39,820
You can find that.

1018
00:51:39,820 --> 00:51:40,820
Good call.

1019
00:51:40,820 --> 00:51:45,620
So thanks to what we talked about today, coder dot show slash four, four, eight.

1020
00:51:45,620 --> 00:51:49,280
And last but not least, I'd love to invite you to join us on a Monday.

1021
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:55,140
We do this show at noon Pacific, three p.m. Eastern over at jblive.tv every single Monday.

1022
00:51:55,140 --> 00:51:59,260
You get a little bit extra show, get to hear us screw up, have our mistakes, have some

1023
00:51:59,260 --> 00:52:03,300
fun and get a little bit entertainment at the same time.

1024
00:52:03,300 --> 00:52:06,500
Thanks so much for joining us on this week's episode of the Coder Radio program.

1025
00:52:06,500 --> 00:52:18,020
And we will see you right back here next week.
