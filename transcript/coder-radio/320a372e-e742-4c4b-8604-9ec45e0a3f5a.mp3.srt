00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:43,000
My name is Chris and joining us every single week is our work machine, it's our host, Mr. Dominic.

8
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Hello Mike.

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Hello Chris.

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Hello sir, how are you holding up? You doing alright?

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I'm alright, how are you?

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I'm good, I mean I know it's the final push, you've been pulling in a lot of hours.

13
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I've seen some late night slacks that indicate you're working at all hours of the night and day.

14
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Oh yeah.

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
But you sound good.

16
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Yeah, I took a little bit of a rest today, but yeah, just to not black out on the air.

17
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Usually not our best rated shows.

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I mean it depends, some people love them I would imagine, you know.

19
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
You got to just play it all the niches.

20
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Yes.

21
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:20,000
So I guess I'm a little envious because I've been working seven days a week since I got back from the road trip

22
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:26,000
and the road trip was no walk in the park either, especially the last few weeks of it were really, really rough and tense.

23
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
And I just, I'm dying.

24
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Like you seem like you're managing this, like you're in the final push of a release and it's a lot of hard work,

25
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
but like you're showing up, you're fresh, you even put the show doc together today.

26
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I know.

27
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Like I showed up and the show was ready to go and I'm like, what is going on here?

28
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Meanwhile, I'm like scraping myself together to get down here.

29
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I want to know what your secret is.

30
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
You know, I don't really have a secret.

31
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I mean, I'm sure right after the show I'm going to black out.

32
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
It's like maybe a pacing thing.

33
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Have you changed the pacing the way you're working?

34
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
There's something different.

35
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
You know, I had a good thing going where I was doing early morning hours,

36
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,000
but that fell apart in the last couple of days where I ended up working nights.

37
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:20,000
And I'm not doing much like socially or, you know, I think I've just sacrificed a lot to not get around that.

38
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Yeah.

39
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Optimus Grey points out not doing it from Tucson helps as well, which is a hell-failed state.

40
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I think too, like you make a good point.

41
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:33,000
It seems like for me personally, it's less costly to do those big pushes early in the morning than it is to do late nights.

42
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
And it's the late nights that really burn me out.

43
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Like I've been, so I've been working.

44
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I took time off Saturday.

45
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Absolutely.

46
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I still work Saturday and I'm an hour and a half each way from the studio right now.

47
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Jesus.

48
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
And to just randomly add that kind of commute, you know, you think about it.

49
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Like you don't move house.

50
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
You don't move where your house is very often.

51
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
So you build a life around the commute you have and you create a routine.

52
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
But I'm moving around right now.

53
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:03,000
And so I just randomly for a couple of, for three weeks have an hour and a half commute each direction.

54
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
And you don't just like absorb that kind of commute out of nowhere.

55
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Like you have to cut into stuff and it's just been, it's been brutal.

56
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
So I'm going to head to the woods this weekend.

57
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I'm going to take an early weekend.

58
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I'm going to head out on Thursday.

59
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Yeah, I'm just going to chill out for a while.

60
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
And I'm calling, I'm calling it a reading weekend.

61
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I've got books queued up and I'm just going to read all weekend.

62
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
That's my plan.

63
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
We'll see how it goes.

64
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
That sounds amazing actually.

65
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I hope, I hope it's really nice.

66
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I hope it's refreshing.

67
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
So are you, is this the last few days for you?

68
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Are you like, you're getting super close, right?

69
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Like one week or so?

70
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Super close.

71
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
So next week is launch, come hell or high water.

72
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
The end, the end of the week.

73
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
So it's going to be, it's going to be, you know, it's, it's actually not close.

74
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
It's basically done.

75
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:59,000
But there's always now I'm at that 20% hellscape of, oh, well actually this doesn't seem to work right in the following, you know.

76
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Yeah, I don't know.

77
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Actually the last 10% often the worst, some of the hardest.

78
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Yeah, so I totally get it.

79
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Well, let's see if we can't help an old friend.

80
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
He's written into the show over the years.

81
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Even once back in high school, he says, I wrote in asking about a career direction at the time before I got into college and man, did this work out for him?

82
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Apparently we gave him some good advice.

83
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Check this out.

84
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
He says, I graduated from a top research university in May.

85
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Prior to graduation, I worked in one of the IT departments for a bit over two years.

86
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:34,000
First as a tier one support, then later as management overseeing a large internal software project.

87
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Prior to college, I ran a private IT business for the better part of eight years.

88
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
No, seriously.

89
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Now I'm 23 years old.

90
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I was doing better than I could have ever imagined with a stable income, a business, tech experience, management positions, and I was graduating from college.

91
00:04:49,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Last week, I took a full time management position within the university and subsequently turned down a job that was paying 11,000 more a year for the flexibility of the management position at the university.

92
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:18,000
But yesterday, a week after taking the job, I was fired because of a background check that showed some bad decisions I made in undergrad resulting in a felony, which, by the way, is set to be reduced next month.

93
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Now I ask myself, amid burnout, depression, and needing to pay the bills, is tech the thing I want to do?

94
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
And if so, how can I pursue it with this felony on my record?

95
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I don't know about Mike's relatable background, but I know Chris made some hard career decisions a while back that turned out really well.

96
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Why have you all stayed in tech?

97
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Have you all had to make these kinds of pivots before?

98
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:47,000
What advice might you have for someone who's quite capable of performing with history to prove it, but is struggling to get to the next step of life with a bit of a criminal record?

99
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Thanks for your advice.

100
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
That's tricky and such a shame.

101
00:05:51,000 --> 00:06:04,000
You know, somebody that young to have opportunity like that taken from them because of a bad decision they made when they were even younger and especially when it's about to be reduced next month.

102
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I mean, what a damn shame.

103
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
He didn't want us to use any names.

104
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:17,000
But I feel for him because he's written in several times over all of this journey that he's been on because the show has tracked all of it, and this is where he's at now.

105
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
That's terrible.

106
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I mean, that is just terrible.

107
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I mean, I want to say, first of all, I don't feel like every place is going to punish him for that felony.

108
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I mean, background checks are a lot more common these days, though.

109
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
But in a month or so, it sounds like it'll be in a better position.

110
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Yeah, it'll be in a better position.

111
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I mean, so it sounds like it's going to get kicked out of a misdemeanor or something, right, which often will not be picked up.

112
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I don't know.

113
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I mean, so for folks in a similar position, if you've been like incarcerated, there's the group Underdog Devs.

114
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:58,000
They do great work helping folks get into tech, get jobs at places, you know, that don't have any kind of like clearance requirements or anything like that.

115
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I would say, honestly, it's very strange for you to get the job and then lose it.

116
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
It's taken a while for the background check to come back, Corona delays or whatnot.

117
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I mean, could you imagine the level of burnout after passing up a higher paying job?

118
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:20,000
You know, the high of taking this management position at a university that seems like such a great job, you're willing to pass up more money and then the low of getting fired from it?

119
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I'd be contacting another company, first of all.

120
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
But second of all, yeah, that would be my my move for sure.

121
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Now he's questioning just leaving tech altogether.

122
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Have you ever been in that spot where you're like, maybe I should just get a whole other field, maybe I should just move to an entirely different field?

123
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Let me tell you, I would open a fantastic bakery.

124
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
It's not true, but you know what's weird?

125
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I every every guy that I talk to this, I have this because I've talked about this with friends of mine who are in tech, too.

126
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,000
We all go to restaurants like I'd want to do a barbecue joint.

127
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Everybody I know does. It's restaurants.

128
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,000
It is weird, though, but that's like an even harder business in some ways.

129
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Oh, yeah. Almost guaranteed to fail.

130
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I don't I don't know that that's the best choice.

131
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Yeah, it's really like, what is your skill set and what are you passionate about?

132
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
You can't you can't just go become a farmer.

133
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
You know, it's not just you don't just fall into farming.

134
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:13,000
It's kind of like the same ridiculousness when, you know, a painter gets laid off because he's got bad carpal tunnel and they tell him to go become a coder.

135
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
It's like, give me a break.

136
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Just not how it works.

137
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I mean, looking on the bright side here, though, the market for deaf people is super duper hot right now.

138
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Yeah. So I don't think you're going to be unemployed for too long at all.

139
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Yeah, I think he's down more than he needs to be.

140
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I think he's going to be OK.

141
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,000
You know, take the week or two, chalk it up to a bad experience.

142
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:39,000
I understand that you need income, all that, but it it's super hot and companies are having a super hard time hiring people in tech.

143
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
And I think you'll land on your feet, man.

144
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I don't know. I am I know it's cold comfort, but it's kind of never been a better time to need a different tech job.

145
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Yeah. And I think, too, if you if you got the right hiring person.

146
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Like if I saw your resume and I saw what you've accomplished in a short amount of time,

147
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I'd pretty quickly put together that you're a pretty motivated individual who's probably going to be a go getter.

148
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,000
And I'd look at some of those other things with probably less concern.

149
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,000
But then again, I'm in I'm in a tiny company where I have that kind of flexibility.

150
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:22,000
But what I'm saying is it just takes somebody with some intelligence and some individual capability to think on their own as a as an individual and not as part of a collective to recognize your value.

151
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
It's clear just from that email what you're capable of.

152
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
And people like that don't tend to stay down for long.

153
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
But do please keep us updated because I really genuinely want to hear it.

154
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,000
So let us know. And if you're out there in a similar position or have any tips or experience,

155
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:40,000
if you've been through something like this, relay it to us at Coder dot show slash contact.

156
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
But some guy writes in and he wants an M1 update for Mr.

157
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Dominic. He says, I was curious if Mr.

158
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Dominic could share his experience with using an M1 device to develop, especially in Python and C.

159
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I'm coming from a 2015 MacBook Pro.

160
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
And after breaking the monitor, I figured it was time to upgrade.

161
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I'm holding out for the next generation of M1 devices and wanted to hear how it's been for you.

162
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:07,000
And he also says, Have you figured out when it's appropriate to run the terminal under Rosetta or are you still stumbling with that sometimes?

163
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Always. You just you always just decide to run things under Rosetta.

164
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Is there any issues with that stuff and so on?

165
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Yeah, just always run it under Rosetta. Really?

166
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:23,000
The terminal just always and it's yeah, in fact, I changed it to the thing that's called terminal dot app on mine is the Rosetta terminal.

167
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
And the other one is like I think I call it like ARM terminal or something.

168
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
If you're just you're just going to leave it that way for a while, right?

169
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Let them sort it out for like the indefinite future.

170
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Otherwise, like it's fine. It's fast. It works fine.

171
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,000
I mean, the MacBook Air is still like the best laptop I've ever owned.

172
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
So he asked you like about using ID specifically with C and Python.

173
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
All that's been fine. No, no issues to report there.

174
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Yep. VSCode is amazing.

175
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Python works fine if you want to go the JetBrains.

176
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Although I've pretty much replaced everything with VSCode at this point.

177
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
That's not surprising.

178
00:10:54,000 --> 00:11:00,000
The most interesting thing about this whole M1 for development story is how like not interesting of a story it really is.

179
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
In a way, yeah, right? That it's not this huge issue.

180
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Once you set up terminal to run in Rosetta, you're fine.

181
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:13,000
One last email into the show and I love this kind of stuff because it's just it's great to get tips.

182
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Carl writes in with a cool tool and he says, hello, Chris and Mike.

183
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
About a year and a half or so listener.

184
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
And I want to write in and mention any tool I found.

185
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,000
It's a slick backup that I've managed to configure with Linode's S3 storage.

186
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Previously, I was using R-Sync and tar, but there's a degree of complexity involved in getting that set up.

187
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Yeah, I could see that.

188
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I found Borg backup, he writes.

189
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:39,000
And a side note, I also have a lot of previous years, but previous experience with Borg backup and really liked it.

190
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:45,000
But he continues, it has all the advantages of live compression and data de-duplication like R-Sync.

191
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
But handles all the archiving like tar would as well.

192
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
And it handles encryption.

193
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
He does an offsite backup to S3.

194
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,000
He gets everything up there like his photos, his SQLite databases, his configurations, etc.

195
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,000
He puts it on a Linode S3 bucket using S3FS.

196
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:04,000
He writes, all in all, I find it to be a cost-effective way to back up my development environment and have it all offsite.

197
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
It's better than anywhere else.

198
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
And I got to use the sponsor credit.

199
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Well, isn't that great?

200
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Thank you, Carl.

201
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Also, I'll do a plug for Borg backup.

202
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,000
And I'm going to do a plug, and I think, Mike, you know this too, for object storage, like incredible.

203
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:22,000
And I don't know if you saw this, but last week, Cloudflare announced R2.

204
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:33,000
And R2 is an S3 compatible object storage that can sit in front of another S3 storage like Amazon and doesn't have any egress charges,

205
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
which is where Amazon makes all of its money.

206
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:46,000
So you can use R2 to pull files out of S3 once and then store them and serve them from R2 with no fee other than the service fee.

207
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Amazon's going to have to respond to that.

208
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
That's cutting right in at their profit margin.

209
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Linode.com slash coder.

210
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Well, that's a great place to store your files in object storage.

211
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
And they have fantastic rates, too.

212
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
So go there and try it out.

213
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Go to Linode.com slash coder.

214
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,000
They started in 2003 as one of the very first companies in cloud computing.

215
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Now, 18 years later, they are the largest independent cloud provider in the world with 11 global data centers serving nearly a million customers.

216
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
But their mission has really remained the same.

217
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Just build the best in class experience for hosting.

218
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
And Linode, that nails it.

219
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:29,000
And when you take advantage of that $100 offer, you can see what I've been talking about now for a while.

220
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,000
When we went independent, Linode came on board to support this content.

221
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
And I thought at the time, like, this could be pretty great.

222
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
I've been a Linode customer for a couple of years at this point.

223
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
I've got some experience.

224
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
But I really had no idea.

225
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:49,000
I hear from so many of you out there about the different ways you use Linode and how it solved things that were, like, particularly crunched during the last couple of years.

226
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Like, deploying the one-click Jitsi solution has saved a ton of people from Zoom hell and gotten a bunch of other people out of Zoom hell.

227
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:07,000
If your organization is doing a lot of virtual meetings right now and you'd like to control that infrastructure yourself, but maybe you're not, like, an expert system administrator,

228
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Linode has tons of good documentation that will really help you set these things up correctly and securely.

229
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:21,000
And then additionally, they've got one-click deployments for things like Jitsi and tons of other applications, maybe like Nextcloud or other things you could use to collaborate.

230
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
GitLab and all kinds of tools.

231
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:32,000
One click, you get it going, they'll have a couple of questions for you, you can answer, they'll set up the box correctly, they'll make sure everything's done properly, and then you just keep it running from there.

232
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,000
But they also offer a powerful DNS manager if that's the way you like to go.

233
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,000
They have Kubernetes and Terraform support if that's how you're managing your infrastructure now.

234
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:46,000
And they're 30 to 50% cheaper than the major hyperscaler duopolies who are trying to lock you in all the time to their infrastructure.

235
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
And Linode's support for the community runs deep.

236
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
They made our Jupiter colony road trip possible.

237
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:55,000
They've supported my Linux Fest Northwest that I've gone to for 20 plus years.

238
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:03,000
And they backed some of my favorite open source projects, not because they have to, but because they want to invest back in the community that made what they do possible.

239
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:08,000
That's how you can tell there's people there that truly appreciate and use Linux.

240
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Linode is dedicated to offering the best in virtualized cloud computing.

241
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
If it runs on Linux, it runs on Linode.

242
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:25,000
So go sign up today at linode.com slash coder and get $100 in 60-day credit on your new account.

243
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
That's linode.com.

244
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
It went off the rails there, but I'm going with it.

245
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Linode.com slash coder.

246
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:40,000
There is a lot going on, Mr. Dominic, and I thought maybe we'd start with a couple of the stories you grabbed over the weekend.

247
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
This hermit programmers are dead.

248
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Hit me right in the feels because I've known.

249
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:54,000
You know, especially in the 90s and in the early aughts, you had these really kind of eccentric developers that would be working on the really important part of the code base.

250
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:59,000
And they had they had like just a blank check to behave and do whatever they want.

251
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
I worked at a company once where this guy had the coolest cube.

252
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:09,000
He had built himself a roof and his own custom lighting and he kept it dark in there and he got to dress however he wanted.

253
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:15,000
And nobody talked to him because he was the special, very eccentric developer.

254
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
And this was at an antivirus company.

255
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,000
And he was like he knew the special sauce on how to build the antivirus software.

256
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
That wasn't a rare thing to see at a company.

257
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:29,000
And you linked us to a piece we'll have in the show notes that kind of suggests that person is about to lose their job.

258
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:34,000
So I linked to this because I think there's some value in the article, but I definitely think it's overstated.

259
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Right. There will always be the guy in the basement or the gal in the basement who has to write the firmware.

260
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:45,000
So I know it's a bit of a caricature, but I mean, I know some very nice people who write firmware.

261
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Exactly. Right. I'm nothing against firmware developers.

262
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:56,000
I think what this article gets right is that there is a whole new skill set more like soft skills, communication skills,

263
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:01,000
not wanting to rip the user's throats out for not going on the happy path in your application.

264
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:06,000
That is definitely going to provide increasing job opportunities and value.

265
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:13,000
My issue is I don't think those are replacing your more we'll call them dark matter developers.

266
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Right. I think this is in addition to particularly around the areas of like no code automation,

267
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:26,000
stuff like that, where basically the developer serves as an abstraction machine to keep the users

268
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:34,000
or the end stakeholders away from the technical details in a way that they're still communicating kind of how things work,

269
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
but in some sort of abstracted way.

270
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Yeah. This article doesn't go all the way, but then the second article you linked about the open AI codecs,

271
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:49,000
they basically come out and say, well, really a future programmer's job is plumbing.

272
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:54,000
It's about connecting APIs and building something out of existing wiring.

273
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,000
And it's not so much about actual writing code.

274
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:02,000
And so it'll make it necessary that they actually excel at things like communication

275
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:07,000
and understanding people's needs and expectations and not excel so much of the development,

276
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:12,000
because that's more of just connect these different components together kind of stuff,

277
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
which first of all, I think I agree with you.

278
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:21,000
It's like, yeah, that will be probably maybe even the majority of the jobs that are considered programming at some point.

279
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:26,000
But there still has to be somebody somewhere building that stuff they're connecting.

280
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Yeah. I mean, and I would even argue that's like a realistic look at how programming jobs are now, right?

281
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:37,000
How important is it for companies to have APIs that third party developers can hook into to write whatever line of business app?

282
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Yeah. You could even argue that like using open source packages is a version of that.

283
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:47,000
I think there was an article, I don't remember who wrote it, but like Lego oriented development, I think was the title or something very similar to that.

284
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
We were taking pieces and snapping them together.

285
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Instead of it being extremely frustrating, that makes it sound fun.

286
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:57,000
It makes it sound fun until somebody like changes their OAuth scan, but it's not.

287
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Until you try to do it.

288
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:06,000
He makes the case and again, we have it linked, but there's going to be this explosion of what he labels as middle skilled developers.

289
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
I'll just read just a small excerpt here.

290
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:15,000
He says, the number of programmers is constantly on the rise, but many programmers no longer need to be experts.

291
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Middle skilled developers now do what needed an expert before and experts now do what needed to be a team 10 years ago.

292
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Having all services as standardized APIs and a few packages that can access them all.

293
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Suddenly, the most complex programming task becomes plumbing activity where no programmers are needed.

294
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
I just don't know if I buy that.

295
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
I see that's why I think the article is a bit overstated.

296
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,000
It's funny, like I agree with it to a point.

297
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Yeah, I think middle skilled, if that's what you want to call it, seems kind of derogatory.

298
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:50,000
But middle skilled developers, I could definitely see that being the bulk of the market.

299
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:57,000
And I could see in most business cases, you have a couple of people in your business who are connecting different things together like this.

300
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:05,000
With maybe a little bit of code in between to help, you know, smooth over little bits or translate data or something like that.

301
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:12,000
I mean, it's an interesting question of like, I also kind of picked up on the middle skilled thing and didn't love that myself.

302
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Right.

303
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Is it really like a different middle skilled or is it just a slightly different skill set that maybe as an industry we have historically undervalued?

304
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Yeah, and I think you and I started to touch on this when we were talking about that artificial intelligence text editor,

305
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,000
which I've already forgotten the name of because I'm an old man.

306
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:43,000
There's also Codex, the OpenAI Projects Codex, which is similar in some ways, which you link to in the show notes.

307
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Yeah.

308
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:51,000
The whole idea there is that it's another system that writes code automatically using a few simple prompts and plain language to prompt the developer.

309
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:55,000
And then it kind of does the rest of the actual programming.

310
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,000
I could see companies loving this idea.

311
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:06,000
In their paper announcing Codex, OpenAI scientists acknowledge that in their words, quote, engineers don't spend their full day writing code.

312
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Instead, they spend much of their time on tasks like conferring with colleagues, writing design specifications and upgrading existing software stacks.

313
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Codex creators, this is no longer a quote, but it'll be it's about to be.

314
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Codex creators suspect that the system may, quote, somewhat reduce the overall cost of producing software, end quote.

315
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:31,000
And they say by letting developers, quote, write good code faster, they doubt it will steal jobs.

316
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:39,000
If anything, they suggest automating the grunt work associated with software development will open up the field to a broader range of people, end quote.

317
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:47,000
They called it a new specialty instead of middle engineers or middle developers, whatever the other guy called it.

318
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:53,000
The Codex folks call those developers prompt engineering.

319
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Engineers, they get prompted and craft textual responses to allow the AI to proceed.

320
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:08,000
How about that? That's your new programmer, somebody who can craft textual responses to an AI to auto deploy new code.

321
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Clearly, they're not there yet, but that's where they think they can take it.

322
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:19,000
I suppose I may if I can't be too skeptical because I could play this back in a few years and eat my words.

323
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Yeah, I just don't buy it.

324
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:26,000
We were all going to be coding in Java and thinking about objects for the rest of our lives at one point.

325
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
I'm just saying, right?

326
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
True.

327
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
I mean, VP6 was going to be the language to end it all.

328
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,000
I feel like these kind of pronouncements are nice and clickbaity.

329
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
And there is something true here, right?

330
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:48,000
There is going to be more systems that integrate between different systems and basically do a lot of what a custom developer in-house would have done.

331
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:53,000
But behind the scenes, there's somebody writing like Python or whatever to make that system actually work.

332
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,000
It's just they're giving you a better front end.

333
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Yeah.

334
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
I don't know.

335
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
You know what?

336
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
We've been about to be wiped out for how many years now?

337
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,000
I'm going to take a cynical, skeptical look at this.

338
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:11,000
So if anybody feels very differently, feel free to let us know your point of view, coder.show.com.

339
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:25,000
I think while I'm not saying everyone on the project is, this is their intention, I wouldn't be surprised if some of the executives' intention isn't just to raise awareness about their group and to suck money out of large corporations who can be told,

340
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:33,000
hey, if you fund us and you give us a runway for a few years, we'll develop a tool so you can pay your developers less and hire less developers.

341
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
That's probably how they'd pitch it.

342
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:42,000
If once this tool is fully operational, you could cut your development staff in half and the ones you do have to retain, they'll be the cheap ones.

343
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:47,000
You can see how these executives would have a horrible conversation like this amongst themselves.

344
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:53,000
And then, of course, they flower it up in very pretty language when it's business to business conversations and they're pitching it to the executives.

345
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,000
They don't come out and say it like that, but that's what they're thinking internally.

346
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:02,000
And they think to themselves, we'll get money out of these big companies for a while and tell them the promise of reducing their staffing costs.

347
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:06,000
And in the meantime, you know, maybe they get it working, maybe they don't, but they all get paid.

348
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Nobody's the loser.

349
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:14,000
And these big companies get shown for supporting AI and open AI initiatives and it looks great for them and they become brand ambassadors

350
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:18,000
and they get their logo on the website and everybody goes away fat and happy.

351
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:25,000
And nobody actually has to produce anything that's actually going to make real world code that runs in production somewhere that actually matters.

352
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Nobody ever has to get to that point because there's no benchmark.

353
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
There's no goal.

354
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
It's just sort of all nebulous.

355
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Is that too cynical?

356
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,000
I mean, I think it's a little cynical, but I don't think it's wrong.

357
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,000
So, you know, many things can be true at the same time.

358
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Right.

359
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:46,000
You know, no code isn't just fluff, which I think is a lot of what this stuff really is.

360
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
Right.

361
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
But it's usually not no code.

362
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,000
It's the end user doesn't need to care.

363
00:24:51,000 --> 00:25:01,000
But it's, you know, GitHub bot or whatever it is, isn't going to like put, you know, ThoughtBot or TMB or any consulting company out of business.

364
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:07,000
It's just going to be a tool that people use and there's going to be caveats to the use of that tool.

365
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Right.

366
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:13,000
There have already been concerns about how it may or may not violate GPL and stuff like that.

367
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
So I don't know.

368
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
Yeah, here's my thing.

369
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:24,000
If you wanted to come at me and position it as a learning tool for people just getting started who wanted to maybe connect concepts and get output and see if they're on the right track.

370
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,000
And we're not saying they should take it as gospel and an example of what to learn by.

371
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:32,000
But it could be like how it just is a really kind of bad example.

372
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:43,000
But, you know, the way I learned to create web pages back in the day was by viewing source of other web pages and kind of copying what they did and playing with it until I got my website working.

373
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:49,000
Using it as a tool, these codecs things or the GitHub tool to do that kind of stuff.

374
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
Like if you wanted to pitch it as that.

375
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
Sure.

376
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
But that's not that's not what they're pitching.

377
00:25:53,000 --> 00:26:03,000
In fact, they're going so far as to say we are going to redefine the software development field and people will go from developers to prompt engineers.

378
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,000
But that's it's just it's outlandish, right?

379
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
It is braggadocious.

380
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
It is so over the top.

381
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:16,000
It's like we're going to we're going to redefine one of the largest industries in the world because our open source tool is going to have such an impact.

382
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000
And I may eat these words.

383
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Maybe I'm wrong.

384
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
Maybe it will.

385
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:30,000
But from where I'm sitting today, it seems like it'd be much more rational and reasonable to pitch these things as science experiments and maybe educational tools or coding assistance at best.

386
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Yeah, I mean, that's where I am, too.

387
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:41,000
Right. And I also think there's like a whiff of, you know, trying to once again have like real developers versus whatever these other people are.

388
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:49,000
Hmm. You're right. It sort of segregates the development community up a bit, slices it up into like, yeah, high end developers and prompt developers.

389
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:53,000
I remember like, oh, iOS developers aren't real Cocoa developers.

390
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:59,000
And then there was lots of money in the App Store and a lot of people changed their mind real quick and became iOS developers.

391
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
Yeah. Now that's totally flipped.

392
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:05,000
Yeah. Hmm. Yeah.

393
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000

So go over there, support the show, create a dashboard and get a free T-shirt.

409
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Datadog.com slash CoderRadio.

410
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:32,000
The show moves right along into the second half of the show.

411
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
We've got some good stuff today.

412
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,000
You found one. It's just right up your alley.

413
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:47,000
It's a it's a I guess you could call it a review that shows the coverage test coverage is not necessarily strongly correlated with the test suite's effectiveness.

414
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:54,000
In other words, if shops out there are looking at their test coverage and say, well, look, we have covered 100 percent of the code base with this.

415
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
It doesn't necessarily mean it's effective.

416
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
Greg Wilson writes, we'll have a link in the show notes.

417
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:03,000
One of my recent hobby projects was a blocks based tool for doing basic data science.

418
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:08,000
And I was very pleased when the test suite achieved 100 percent line coverage.

419
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:20,000
However, one of my coworkers found that code coverage was actually a poor prediction of how effective a test suite is at detecting bugs once the size of that test suite itself is accounted for.

420
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:24,000
And he goes through the methodology that they used in good detail.

421
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:37,000
But he writes, in other words, more tests do find more bugs, but it's the number of tests and not their code coverage that has the most predictive value.

422
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:41,000
Surprising to him, but maybe not so surprising to you, is it?

423
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,000
Again, I've been on a journey with testing for a long time.

424
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:52,000
I sort of feel like the way test line coverage became popular was it's a really cool metric for the business development guy at a consulting shop.

425
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
It's measurable, right?

426
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
It's measurable and it's like a bullion, right?

427
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,000
It is whatever it is.

428
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:04,000
But I would argue that many tests that people write aren't really valuable.

429
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:16,000
And more tests that cover your actual line of business core stuff, because this article, it's a summary of two academic papers.

430
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:27,000
But there's kind of a great point where what ends up happening in organizations that require 100 percent line coverage is you just get shallow tests that pass and don't really test all the code paths.

431
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:33,000
They might test trivial things, but not the core functionality of the product.

432
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:41,000
So that's – I mean, I don't know if I agree with – I mean, obviously the data does suggest that more tests are better, but that's different, right?

433
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:48,000
That's more tightly focused smaller tests rather than covering each line of code.

434
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
It's interesting, right?

435
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:52,000
I mean, testing is kind of like fashion.

436
00:30:52,000 --> 00:31:01,000
It was all about test first, then it was TDD, then it was BDD, and then it was like – I forgot what the other one was, but like experience-oriented or something.

437
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:10,000
And now, I don't know, I've personally fallen into this way where I will test the mission-critical stuff like with a lot of obnoxious little tests to try to hit every code path.

438
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:15,000
But I'm sort of not like running Selenium and worried about if the CSS is a little off.

439
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:19,000
I'll just – somebody will tell me or I'll see it visually and just fix it.

440
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:24,000
Is this a point of contention when you are temporarily or you just start working with somebody new?

441
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,000
Is this like a shocking revelation to them?

442
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:30,000
You mean like a new developer or a new customer?

443
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:34,000
Somebody on the team or just somebody you're working with that finds out your philosophy on this?

444
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
Like how does that conversation go?

445
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:43,000
You know, everybody in an interview says testing is important to them, and then I've never met someone who actually did it.

446
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,000
Yeah.

447
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Just like everybody says, you know, read this before you start something or eat your vegetables, right?

448
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Wipe yourself after you – what?

449
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:57,000
Well, some of those I hope are happening.

450
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:00,000
Okay, well, you know, we need somebody out there to help us.

451
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,000
We need a clip that it's like we told you so.

452
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,000
We told you so.

453
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:10,000
But something from the show or some clip or some jingle because since we've restarted the Coda Radio program,

454
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:17,000
it kind of seems like every kind of prediction or speculation we made like 10 years ago, 13 years ago, whatever it was,

455
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:21,000
is essentially now coming true.

456
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:24,000
Like it takes a while for these things to filter through the system apparently.

457
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:31,000
But this morning, we saw another round of Apple executive emails get posted.

458
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:39,000
This shows in July of 2018, Apple was openly talking about a unique arrangement – that's a quote –

459
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:44,000
a unique arrangement with Netflix in regards to in-app purchases.

460
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:51,000
And I know you saw this, and it just feels like it's a smoking gun that while Tim Cook testified in front of Congress

461
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:57,000
saying that they treat all developers the same, this is documentation showing they clearly do not.

462
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:00,000
And that means that Tim Cook lied to Congress.

463
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
I don't know how you get around that.

464
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:05,000
I would urge people to read this email thread.

465
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:08,000
There's something like super evil in it, right?

466
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:15,000
Like if you had a, I would call, not cynical, but realistic view on how the apps must have worked back in like 2013.

467
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:19,000
You know that when we put on our executive hats that everybody really hates,

468
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
this is exactly the kind of stuff we would say.

469
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:24,000
Yeah, like Netflix is an important partner.

470
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:28,000
Netflix is upset about the IAP and that their sweetheart deal was going to end.

471
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,000
So guess what Apple did?

472
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
They made it go longer, right?

473
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
I mean, I don't know.

474
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:36,000
They figured, you know, they talked about it and said, you know what, is it worth it to us?

475
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:39,000
And they talked about why Netflix doesn't feel like they've got a value.

476
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:43,000
They called up Netflix and they talk about the phone call that they had with them discussing it with their team.

477
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:49,000
It's all just an open frank conversation about like how Apple is giving Netflix certain assurances.

478
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:55,000
If Netflix will do X, Y and Z, they'll get a special deal and why the in-app purchase isn't working for them

479
00:33:55,000 --> 00:34:00,000
and how they've done the math and it just doesn't work out long term for Netflix and all of it's right there.

480
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:04,000
It's exactly the cynical kind of bullsh** you'd expect from Apple.

481
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:09,000
Well, Netflix is like, hey, it's strategically important for us to have our customer like contact information

482
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,000
and the billing information.

483
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,000
And Apple is like, yeah, we know.

484
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:17,000
And you could totally see why Netflix is like, this seems bad for us.

485
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:20,000
And Apple is just like, but we need that sweet, sweet in-app purchase revenue.

486
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:24,000
So I'm trying to come back to his words where we treat all developers the same.

487
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:29,000
And I'm trying to think like, well, if I were to really kind of corporate nuance that,

488
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:37,000
so developers is a category of people and that category has subcategories that include reader developers

489
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
and streaming developers and game developers, right?

490
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,000
Like maybe that's what he meant.

491
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,000
That's what they're doing now.

492
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,000
Yeah, now.

493
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:47,000
Like the concessions they've made has all been in what they call the reader category,

494
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:51,000
which is amazingly does not cover Kindle.

495
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:55,000
I'm trying to like back logic what he could have meant now that we know all this.

496
00:34:55,000 --> 00:35:03,000
Like he must have meant by developers, I mean four groups of different kinds of people that we treat differently,

497
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,000
depending on what group they're in.

498
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
It must have been it.

499
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
They will have to do something like that.

500
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:12,000
But it's pretty clear that the dude just made a mistake, right?

501
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
The tides change, man.

502
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:20,000
Like there is legal action happening and it's not all like anti-competitive stuff or anti-monopoly,

503
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,000
but it's close.

504
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:26,000
A lot of it's close in countries all over the world against Apple and Google.

505
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:30,000
Like it is building and it's happening here in the U.S. too.

506
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
Like these tech executives are going to get called in again.

507
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:35,000
Like the whole thing is it's really building to something.

508
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
I'm just not sure what the hell it is.

509
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
Yeah, just going back to the email, right?

510
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:44,000
If you look at Apple's whole argument to the Netflix people, like they even know that it's kind of bullsh**ty, right?

511
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:48,000
It's like, yeah, to provide the best experience and to get our cut, right?

512
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,000
Yeah.

513
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:52,000
I mean, I don't know.

514
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:56,000
The thing that kind of shocked me was years ago when we would talk about these issues,

515
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:01,000
like just the massive amounts of hate mail that it was just like, oh, Mike's evil.

516
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,000
This is speculation.

517
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
You guys are just such Apple haters.

518
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,000
And now it's, you know, now it's crazy.

519
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,000
Now it's the exact opposite.

520
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
Now that this stuff is common knowledge.

521
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
Oh, you guys are such Apple lovers.

522
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
It's really funny.

523
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:15,000
They made a good laptop and I like it.

524
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
And that's it, I guess.

525
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,000
And headphones.

526
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,000
You know, headphones aren't bad.

527
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
I mean, they're pretty practical, really, if you're already in the ecosystem.

528
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
The AirPods Max that I'm wearing right now are fantastic.

529
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,000
Thank you.

530
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:27,000
So we got a tip of the week, which sounds lovely.

531
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,000
Just the tip.

532
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,000
Just the tip of the week.

533
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,000
So what is it?

534
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,000
Is it a Python tip?

535
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,000
It's a Python tip.

536
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:35,000
So Python 3.10 is coming out very soon.

537
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:41,000
In fact, I think they're doing a live stream of getting ready to release it or something

538
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:44,000
I saw on the interwebs earlier today.

539
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:51,000
And a feature that I really, really like in Python 3.10 is the ability to have your return

540
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:57,000
types, you know, be not strong type, but like type hinted to your custom classes.

541
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:00,000
Sounds a little crazy because I said it weirdly, but think about it.

542
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
Let's say we have a custom class called Gungan.

543
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:07,000
Not sure how I got to there, but let's just think it's called Gungan.

544
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:13,000
And we want to have a type checking against our custom Gungan class because, I mean, we

545
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:16,000
don't want any humans or like Twi'leks in here.

546
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
We just want Gungans.

547
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
Yeah, of course.

548
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,000
Yeah.

549
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:24,000
In Python 3.6 and up, you can do this little magical, I'm sure it's not doing anything

550
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:29,000
scary, wink wink, in the background, import from future something called annotations,

551
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:32,000
which is exactly what it sounds like, type annotations.

552
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:38,000
So in this gist, which will be in the show notes, I do a very, very contrived, very,

553
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:44,000
very loose, very somewhat incorrect singleton pattern that shows you that you can indeed

554
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:53,000
do that and that it does sign the static method with the custom type, which believe it or

555
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:57,000
not, you could not do previously for reasons that make no sense to me.

556
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:04,000
But this is all going along with my adventures in Python where I have found that I think

557
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
everything needs a type.

558
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
All methods need a return type.

559
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:15,000
And somebody, I had a somewhat heated conversation with another developer on my team, and I will

560
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
give you the anti-Mike argument.

561
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:22,000
You're trying to turn Python into C-sharp.

562
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:26,000
What I would argue is that our code base is so large now, we can't just keep having to

563
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
flip between files to see what something's doing.

564
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:32,000
Yeah, I mean, sometimes it's bringing the best of things together, right?

565
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,000
Right.

566
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:37,000
So I just wanted to share this little tip for folks who are thinking, oh, I can't do

567
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:40,000
type hinting with my custom classes or my custom types.

568
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,000
Definitely can.

569
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,000
Very nice.

570
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,000
And we have a linky to that.

571
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,000
Yeah.

572
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:48,000
And in 3.10, you don't need the from future import thing.

573
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,000
So I think it's happening.

574
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:54,000
It happened two hours ago, the release party that you mentioned.

575
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,000
Oh, it's going right now.

576
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,000
It's going on.

577
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
It's actually going right now.

578
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:02,000
They started streaming two hours ago, but there's 200 people watching it right now.

579
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,000
I'll put a link to it.

580
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:06,000
By the time the show's out, it'll be over, but you can watch the archive.

581
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
So 3.10 comes out today.

582
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
They're doing the release party right now as we record.

583
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:15,000
And just in time for folks stuck on three whatever and who, or three six plus, can't

584
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:20,000
be three five, and who want to enjoy some 3.10 goodness, you can still have it.

585
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,000
That is pretty exciting.

586
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,000
That's neat.

587
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
Look at us breaking news right here on the Coder program.

588
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:27,000
And then one last link to read later today.

589
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:32,000
You know, Facebook was famous, probably still is really, for that saying, move fast and

590
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,000
break things.

591
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:38,000
And you got to wonder if they haven't just built up horrendous technical debt with that

592
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,000
saying.

593
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:42,000
I noticed you linked, is it to their book, to their move fast book?

594
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:48,000
So this is a book written by actually a podcast fellow podcaster, Jeff Meyerson, I hope I

595
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:53,000
said that right, who did a bunch of interviews of Facebook technical executives and technical

596
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,000
folk.

597
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:58,000
And I love the irony of this was already in the doc before I knew Facebook was down.

598
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:01,000
But I really like that we put this in the day Facebook, especially when it's looking

599
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,000
at that aspect of their culture.

600
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:05,000
Yeah, well, it looks like it's a DNS problem.

601
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:08,000
And I can't say that I've been free of DNS issues.

602
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:15,000
Yeah, it's just it's just it is a bit ironic that it is down the day after horrendous press

603
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,000
like Sunday was brutal for them.

604
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:21,000
There was there was a leaker in the Wall Street Journal and that leaker got interviewed by

605
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,000
60 Minutes.

606
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:25,000
It was like a coordinated attack against Facebook on Sunday from the media.

607
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:28,000
I mean, maybe there's some system admin over there who's like, I can't do it anymore.

608
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
It's just funny that they're down today.

609
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,000
Right.

610
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,000
It's not just Facebook.

611
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,000
It's WhatsApp.

612
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,000
It's Instagram Messenger.

613
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,000
So the book's a pretty good look.

614
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:40,000
I mean, you know, Facebook is a PHP shop.

615
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,000
Yeah.

616
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:44,000
But they've done some interesting things with the hip hop VM.

617
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
And this is a very short book.

618
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:49,000
It's basically interviews with the technical executives and how they make decisions.

619
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:53,000
For all you testing zealots in there, they hired one of the fathers of TDD.

620
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:57,000
And he was surprised at how little testing they have and how it went OK.

621
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:05,000
But Facebook, to their credit, like this whole book is how as their scale and their needs

622
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:10,000
and frankly, their importance to like the world changed, they changed their processes

623
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
and they're always evolving the processes.

624
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:19,000
I am not the biggest Facebook fan, but I think that if, you know, you can dislike what they

625
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:25,000
do, but still respect that they are extremely solid engineering organization.

626
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:29,000
And if you're in this industry, I would strongly recommend you read the short book to kind

627
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
of glean some ideas from how they do things.

628
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,000
Yeah.

629
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
Take the best, take what's worked.

630
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
It looks like a good book.

631
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:39,000
Again, it's called Move Fast and we will have a link in the show notes.

632
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:45,000
They write Facebook strength is having little reverence for accepted sacred cows of software

633
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:50,000
engineering and being willing to adopt more formalized practices when needed to like TDD

634
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,000
when necessary.

635
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
Nice summary there, Mr. Dominic.

636
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,000
I agree.

637
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:59,000
And I think that is, you know, probably speaking of a reading weekend, not a bad one to throw

638
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:02,000
on the list because how many pages?

639
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,000
192 pages.

640
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,000
Yeah, it's super short.

641
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
Yeah, that's great.

642
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:09,000
And it's seven, eight bucks for the Kindle.

643
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,000
That's not bad.

644
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
I want to say thank you to our Coder QA members.

645
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
Sorry, I'm cracking up.

646
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
It's a long day.

647
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
We're about to record a new Coderly.

648
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:23,000
So there's going to be new content for our members, the exclusive Coderly that we do

649
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
every quarter.

650
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:31,000
And if you join our Coderly feed, you can get this one and all the previous ones by

651
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:36,000
going to coderqa.co, become a member, support the show, get a limited ad feed, and in that

652
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:40,000
limited ad feed, you automatically get the Coderly report when it's released.

653
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:44,000
It's usually released a little while after we record because it is as true as time

654
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
allows, of course.

655
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:50,000
And then you can also just stay subscribed to the feed you have today and just grab it

656
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,000
from the downloads area if you're a member.

657
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:56,000
That's at coderqa.co to support the show and get access to the exclusive Coderly and

658
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:59,000
go find our friends at Cloud Guru on social media.

659
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:02,000
They're just slash a Cloud Guru just about everywhere.

660
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:05,000
The YouTubes, the Facebooks, not right now, though.

661
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,000
And the Twitters.

662
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,000
Twitter is still up.

663
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
You can find Mr. Dominic over there.

664
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:12,000
He's at Dumanuco and his company's at the Mad Botter Inc.

665
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
Anywhere else you want to send people this week, Mr. Dominic?

666
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
Nope, that's good.

667
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:21,000
You can find me over there at Chris Elias and the podcast at Coder Radio Show, as well

668
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:24,000
as the whole podcast network at Jupiter Signal.

669
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:27,000
See, we got to get out of here because I'm losing it.

670
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,000
Who knows?

671
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,000
We might start singing soon.

672
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:34,000
You can also find show notes, links, everything we talked about today at coder.show slash

673
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,000
434.

674
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:39,000
Over on that page, you're going to find our contact form as well as our RSS feeds.

675
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:42,000
All of that so you can subscribe, get the show weekly, or send us your feedback.

676
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:45,000
And last but not least, we'd love to have you join us live.

677
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:51,000
