00:00.000 --> 00:15.760
This is Coda Radio, episode 429 for August 30, 2021.

00:15.760 --> 00:18.740
Hello friends and welcome back to Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show, taking a

00:18.740 --> 00:24.040
pragmatic look at the art and the business of software development and the world of technology.

00:24.040 --> 00:26.380
This episode is brought to you by Cloud Guru.

00:26.380 --> 00:29.080
You know, Cloud Guru has the cloud playground.

00:29.080 --> 00:35.000
It's Azure, AWS, and Google's cloud on their sandbox, on their credit card, not yours.

00:35.000 --> 00:39.340
Get certified, get hired, get learning at a cloudguru.com.

00:39.340 --> 00:44.400
My name is Chris and joining us like the podcast pro that he is, it is our host indeed, Mr.

00:44.400 --> 00:45.400
Dominic.

00:45.400 --> 00:46.400
Hello, Mike.

00:46.400 --> 00:47.400
What is up, Mr. Fajah?

00:47.400 --> 00:51.000
Oh, you know, on the road again, on the road.

00:51.000 --> 00:56.360
This time I'm in Arizona in like the northern east area of the state trying to stay somewhere

00:56.360 --> 00:57.360
where there's shade.

00:57.360 --> 00:58.360
Yes.

00:58.360 --> 01:03.000
Where I'm going, it's 106 degrees today and I just figured I'm going to wait it out as

01:03.000 --> 01:06.960
long as possible up north and then pounce.

01:06.960 --> 01:10.960
So the dumb thing that I'm doing is I'm recording a bunch of my shows today.

01:10.960 --> 01:14.760
This is the first one and then I'm just recording for like the rest of the day.

01:14.760 --> 01:18.840
The tricky bit is, is we did all the research ahead of time and everybody said the signal

01:18.840 --> 01:23.240
was fine and I ended up here in Show Low Arizona and there seems to be some sort of cellular

01:23.240 --> 01:27.600
vortex here that just is where cellular devices go to die.

01:27.600 --> 01:31.920
Like two out of my four devices are just not working, even with the same carriers.

01:31.920 --> 01:37.500
And what does work is, oh, abysmal, abysmal.

01:37.500 --> 01:41.600
But it is nice to be here because we're at a golf course, the Bison Golf Club, and it's

01:41.600 --> 01:42.960
gorgeous.

01:42.960 --> 01:48.560
It is such a cool spot and it's nice to be somewhere that looks built up because since

01:48.560 --> 01:55.040
I left Colorado and drove through New Mexico and the western northern area of Arizona,

01:55.040 --> 01:58.000
it's like Mad Max land out there, dude.

01:58.000 --> 02:00.040
Stuff has completely collapsed.

02:00.040 --> 02:02.160
Buildings are just abandoned.

02:02.160 --> 02:06.960
There's teams or groups of people that are like roving homeless people that are caravaning

02:06.960 --> 02:08.960
around out there.

02:08.960 --> 02:10.720
People are fighting over water and fuel.

02:10.720 --> 02:14.640
It is legitimately Mad Max out there right now.

02:14.640 --> 02:15.640
Nobody's talking about this.

02:15.640 --> 02:21.640
In fact, I thought I should like get my camera out and start capturing some of this because

02:21.640 --> 02:22.640
it's wild.

02:22.640 --> 02:26.040
If you're not familiar with Mad Max, it's a series of movies that follow the adventures

02:26.040 --> 02:28.320
of Max, who's a police officer.

02:28.320 --> 02:32.800
It's in the future Australia where they're experiencing societal collapse due to water

02:32.800 --> 02:38.120
and other critical resource shortages like fuel, you know, just just the luxury items.

02:38.120 --> 02:39.960
Yeah, you know, just the luxuries.

02:39.960 --> 02:40.960
Wow.

02:40.960 --> 02:46.360
So you go through that for a couple of days and then you roll into like civilization where

02:46.360 --> 02:52.200
there's people with nice cars and nice and water and playing golf.

02:52.200 --> 02:54.560
And it's like none of that's even going on.

02:54.560 --> 02:57.080
It's it's it's a crazy disconnect.

02:57.080 --> 02:59.560
And I I don't know what to make of it.

02:59.560 --> 03:03.560
You know, I always look at that stuff in the lens of like, how does that affect my business?

03:03.560 --> 03:04.960
What impact can I have there?

03:04.960 --> 03:07.800
I don't have any of those answers.

03:07.800 --> 03:09.960
So just those observations.

03:09.960 --> 03:12.400
But yeah, you know, feels like we're living in Mad Max.

03:12.400 --> 03:13.400
It just wild.

03:13.400 --> 03:16.120
And if you haven't seen it, it's a fun movie series.

03:16.120 --> 03:17.120
Get you thinking.

03:17.120 --> 03:21.400
Why don't we do a little bit of feedback, though, while my connection holds, who knows

03:21.400 --> 03:22.400
how much longer.

03:22.400 --> 03:27.240
Thank you, everybody, who goes over to coder dot show slash contact, by the way, and leaves

03:27.240 --> 03:28.320
us a little bit of feedback.

03:28.320 --> 03:30.040
We do appreciate that.

03:30.040 --> 03:34.760
Now there was an email that came into the show about junior dev jobs going away.

03:34.760 --> 03:38.320
And the writer writes in essentially saying, although it's not loading for me because my

03:38.320 --> 03:42.260
connection is so horrible, that when he's gone around and done interview for a junior

03:42.260 --> 03:46.460
dev position, it seems like what they really want is somebody with quite a bit of experience.

03:46.460 --> 03:50.160
He says here and outloaded, I've mostly been working in smaller businesses.

03:50.160 --> 03:54.720
And now when I've gone out and explored, it seems like they have expectations that would

03:54.720 --> 03:57.800
really be more like somebody who's a senior developer.

03:57.800 --> 04:00.160
He said, I've had a lot of junior roles since then.

04:00.160 --> 04:03.240
And I felt like they don't actually really want junior.

04:03.240 --> 04:07.000
They want somebody who's just a cheap mid range developer, and they're labeling it as

04:07.000 --> 04:08.640
a junior developer.

04:08.640 --> 04:10.480
Are the junior developer jobs disappearing?

04:10.480 --> 04:13.920
I'd love to hear your thoughts and any advice if possible.

04:13.920 --> 04:19.680
His point about labeling a position they basically want to just milk for additional work and

04:19.680 --> 04:22.000
pay less kind of did resonate with me.

04:22.000 --> 04:23.000
Did it?

04:23.000 --> 04:24.000
Okay.

04:24.000 --> 04:26.840
So I would be curious about your take first things I think I'm going to have the exact

04:26.840 --> 04:28.000
opposite take.

04:28.000 --> 04:34.360
I have seen companies that will claim they want something that just is absurdly over

04:34.360 --> 04:38.000
the top as an expectation for an entry level position.

04:38.000 --> 04:41.500
You know, five years with technology X when it's only been out for three years, like those

04:41.500 --> 04:43.080
are real problems.

04:43.080 --> 04:47.520
But I've also seen companies kind of use this as a well, this is a starting position.

04:47.520 --> 04:50.880
And if you work a little extra harder and do these extra things, you know, will promote

04:50.880 --> 04:55.000
you to the next tier when really, that's just ends up being the entire job as you take on

04:55.000 --> 04:57.520
a bunch of extra responsibilities that you should have just been getting paid for from

04:57.520 --> 04:58.520
the beginning.

04:58.520 --> 05:04.680
Okay, so I am actually currently hiring for a junior Python dev plug, plug, plug.

05:04.680 --> 05:10.120
And I've been hiring for junior devs on and off for I don't know, a long time, right?

05:10.120 --> 05:15.800
I can tell you from the other side that this is going to be spicy.

05:15.800 --> 05:21.040
Things have changed, but I would say they've changed in what the junior devs are expecting

05:21.040 --> 05:29.960
life to be like is not so realistic, or I'm gonna put this more than they would have ever

05:29.960 --> 05:34.640
dreamed to expect in let's say, 2014, you know, 2012, whatever.

05:34.640 --> 05:41.280
For instance, wages for junior devs have in general gone up, but the productivity has

05:41.280 --> 05:42.280
not.

05:42.280 --> 05:43.280
Right?

05:43.280 --> 05:45.520
So that's problematic.

05:45.520 --> 05:49.880
There has been quite the emphasis on more of like a mentorship and training, which is

05:49.880 --> 05:50.880
all great.

05:50.880 --> 05:51.880
I'm not against that.

05:51.880 --> 05:55.000
I've done more than my share.

05:55.000 --> 05:59.320
The challenge is, you know, to hire anybody, you're not a school, you're not a charity.

05:59.320 --> 06:03.520
It does have to ultimately be profitable.

06:03.520 --> 06:10.000
And given the risk of a junior developer blowing something up, it has to be significantly profitable.

06:10.000 --> 06:15.320
I would kind of push back on this and say, well, what is a fair salary for someone with

06:15.320 --> 06:24.160
little to no experience, who's entry level, and the value return has to be, you know,

06:24.160 --> 06:26.200
some multiple of that salary, right?

06:26.200 --> 06:28.720
It can't be like they're just barely profitable.

06:28.720 --> 06:33.160
I mean, I understand that larger organizations do sometimes have schemes like that, where

06:33.160 --> 06:35.200
they put you in like a multi-year training program.

06:35.200 --> 06:38.160
Although I think those are even going away.

06:38.160 --> 06:42.980
But from my perspective, you know, as a small business owner who owns a dev shop, junior

06:42.980 --> 06:45.960
devs come with just a ton of risk.

06:45.960 --> 06:48.560
They are the most likely people to blow up your stuff.

06:48.560 --> 06:53.480
They're the most likely people to need just tremendous handholding.

06:53.480 --> 06:55.920
And yeah, it's pretty simple.

06:55.920 --> 06:58.560
The more you pay someone, the more you expect.

06:58.560 --> 07:03.760
And right now with the kind of base wage for junior dev being higher than it's in general,

07:03.760 --> 07:08.200
right, this, of course, this will be regional and there'll be technology differences, but

07:08.200 --> 07:13.280
with it being quite a bit higher than it ever was before, at least from my perspective,

07:13.280 --> 07:15.440
the expectations are indeed higher.

07:15.440 --> 07:19.120
Now, I don't look for the years of experience stuff, but I do expect junior devs to be able

07:19.120 --> 07:24.560
to actually do development and frankly, to be willing to do the work that nobody else

07:24.560 --> 07:25.560
wants to do, right?

07:25.560 --> 07:33.000
The documentation, the QA, the, you know what, fix this bug, it's crunch time, it's an emergency.

07:33.000 --> 07:34.000
I don't know.

07:34.000 --> 07:35.000
I know that's unpopular.

07:35.000 --> 07:36.800
I know there's definitely a move away from that now.

07:36.800 --> 07:40.080
I've seen people write in recommending, like listener Dane wrote it and said, you know,

07:40.080 --> 07:43.040
don't have junior developers do documentation.

07:43.040 --> 07:46.700
Keep them in code all the time and actually have the senior developers do documentation

07:46.700 --> 07:48.320
and data gathering tasks.

07:48.320 --> 07:49.480
I could see that argument.

07:49.480 --> 07:51.840
I think I see it from your perspective pretty clearly.

07:51.840 --> 07:57.640
And for a, for a development shop your size, it feels like there is a role for junior developers

07:57.640 --> 08:01.600
and like you're acknowledging, yeah, there's also a risk for my business and we're willing

08:01.600 --> 08:05.440
to take that on if we can work with somebody that seems like the right fit.

08:05.440 --> 08:07.120
And he's hiring, plug, plug.

08:07.120 --> 08:12.640
But I also can see from the, from the emailers perspective, like there are large corporations

08:12.640 --> 08:18.920
that don't, don't really understand the nuance that you just laid out there.

08:18.920 --> 08:22.540
And they just kind of label junior as a way to say cheap.

08:22.540 --> 08:25.160
Those are two separate issues now that you've laid it out like that.

08:25.160 --> 08:29.180
Dane wrote in, cause this is all part of the transitioning from developer to manager conversation

08:29.180 --> 08:31.260
we've been having for the last couple episodes.

08:31.260 --> 08:36.920
He went on to say that senior engineers want to be given a problem, requirements, limitations,

08:36.920 --> 08:40.000
et cetera, but not told how to solve it.

08:40.000 --> 08:43.800
This might be challenging for a manager coming from an engineering background.

08:43.800 --> 08:46.100
Lead by asking questions, Dane writes.

08:46.100 --> 08:49.880
Even if you know the answer, look for upcoming blockers.

08:49.880 --> 08:53.920
Get the engineer to think several steps ahead to help them identify blockers and remove

08:53.920 --> 08:55.960
those blockers well in advance.

08:55.960 --> 08:59.520
He says, yeah, there's even very senior engineers.

08:59.520 --> 09:03.200
They should probably still be led with questions, but just a different set of questions.

09:03.200 --> 09:05.560
How can this work be shared across multiple teammates?

09:05.560 --> 09:09.460
You know, what kind of tasks support the engineers and that kind of stuff.

09:09.460 --> 09:12.920
But Dane says, there's a lot more to share, but I don't want to give you a novel.

09:12.920 --> 09:14.120
He did write in a pretty good email.

09:14.120 --> 09:17.560
He says also I'm an all shows feed subscriber.

09:17.560 --> 09:19.520
I'd love to see that.

09:19.520 --> 09:21.040
And I think you've nailed it though.

09:21.040 --> 09:24.080
Like you just clearly outlined the junior dev position.

09:24.080 --> 09:29.280
And I think people that are applying for a junior dev position should have those expectations.

09:29.280 --> 09:34.240
You should kind of be on board with what Mike just said, because it is a risk for the business

09:34.240 --> 09:35.400
as well.

09:35.400 --> 09:39.160
And there's generally a lower set of skill sets that you're coming with and that kind

09:39.160 --> 09:40.160
of stuff.

09:40.160 --> 09:41.520
So there is a trade off.

09:41.520 --> 09:44.680
Asish writes in on the Intel conversation.

09:44.680 --> 09:47.120
I guess we've been talking about Intel and M1 a lot.

09:47.120 --> 09:48.120
Who knew?

09:48.120 --> 09:51.000
He says, I don't think Intel is going anywhere anytime soon.

09:51.000 --> 09:53.800
And I think he thinks we haven't really given this enough attention.

09:53.800 --> 09:58.320
He says Intel is the only top to bottom silicon designer and manufacturer.

09:58.320 --> 10:02.240
There's obvious applications such as, you know, use in the DOD.

10:02.240 --> 10:03.240
But it doesn't stop there.

10:03.240 --> 10:05.040
You could see all kinds of uses for that.

10:05.040 --> 10:09.240
Other companies are reliant on parts of the market that can implode unexpectedly.

10:09.240 --> 10:13.200
And because they're so niche, they're physically isolated at the same time.

10:13.200 --> 10:16.760
Nations have taken some notes on the consequences in the past couple of years.

10:16.760 --> 10:21.640
And it seems folks were forgetting the first fanless MacBooks were Intel.

10:21.640 --> 10:23.800
I couldn't even begin to guess, Mike.

10:23.800 --> 10:27.360
Intel's got, you know, bare minimum another 40, 50 years.

10:27.360 --> 10:28.360
Do you have a figure in the market?

10:28.360 --> 10:29.360
Yeah, I don't.

10:29.360 --> 10:30.800
I don't think I was saying they're going to go away.

10:30.800 --> 10:36.600
They're just not going to be the, quote, best processors for general computers for probably,

10:36.600 --> 10:39.520
you know, they won't have another shop for probably five years.

10:39.520 --> 10:40.520
I think that's a different conversation.

10:40.520 --> 10:41.520
Right.

10:41.520 --> 10:42.520
Isn't Intel ever going to file Chapter 11?

10:42.520 --> 10:43.520
No.

10:43.520 --> 10:44.520
Right.

10:44.520 --> 10:45.520
Of course not.

10:45.520 --> 10:46.520
No.

10:46.520 --> 10:48.640
And Mike and I are speaking mostly in the context of workstations, you know, developer

10:48.640 --> 10:51.640
workstations and production workstations.

10:51.640 --> 10:57.280
And also we're frequently thinking about in context of mobile.

10:57.280 --> 11:01.560
And that, I think, is where we see Intel being challenged.

11:01.560 --> 11:07.640
I can't even describe the number of emails that we have gotten from people that have

11:07.640 --> 11:12.560
said, yeah, I just wanted a really lightweight, very fast, quiet laptop.

11:12.560 --> 11:14.120
And I've gotten that sentiment at the meetups, too.

11:14.120 --> 11:17.120
And it's not like it's just this universal thing.

11:17.120 --> 11:19.160
It's not 100 percent of people.

11:19.160 --> 11:25.840
But I think there's a lot of people in the communities that our shows appeal to that

11:25.840 --> 11:29.080
are driven by sort of the latest and greatest tech.

11:29.080 --> 11:32.720
Like there's a part of them that if they have a little bit of disposable income, that latest

11:32.720 --> 11:34.560
and greatest tech is at least fun to tinker with.

11:34.560 --> 11:39.660
It doesn't mean they don't also like something like the framework that really is pro right

11:39.660 --> 11:40.660
to repair.

11:40.660 --> 11:44.640
It just means they're technologically curious, I would say.

11:44.640 --> 11:51.400
I've had a lot of really good conversations with several of the small micro meetups that

11:51.400 --> 11:58.800
we have done, have been with Koda radio listeners who, you know, just one guy, one guy, listener

11:58.800 --> 12:01.000
Mike, who is awesome.

12:01.000 --> 12:05.720
He gave us an aerial tour of Denver when he was unloading his airplane.

12:05.720 --> 12:12.600
He sort of like hung his head and pulled a brand new, still wrapped MacBook Air out and

12:12.600 --> 12:13.600
put it down on the ground.

12:13.600 --> 12:16.840
And he's like, listen, guys, I'm still using Linux, too.

12:16.840 --> 12:18.720
And I just had I'm like, Mike, you don't have to explain.

12:18.720 --> 12:21.240
I was like, I just want you to know it's not that I'm just switching to the Mac.

12:21.240 --> 12:22.680
I have Linux as well.

12:22.680 --> 12:27.520
I just had to build a project for iOS like, no, we understand.

12:27.520 --> 12:28.520
We totally understand.

12:28.520 --> 12:30.320
So where have I heard that before?

12:30.320 --> 12:31.320
Hmm.

12:31.320 --> 12:33.240
Yeah, I know, right.

12:33.240 --> 12:35.040
The road trip for me does continue on.

12:35.040 --> 12:38.400
I'm going down to Tucson for some repairs and then back up to Colorado for a bit and

12:38.400 --> 12:39.400
then home.

12:39.400 --> 12:43.000
And you can follow the journey at colony tracker dot live.

12:43.000 --> 12:45.120
There is a micro meetup link on there.

12:45.120 --> 12:49.200
If you'd like to hit that link and chat with me about tech or something like that, I'd

12:49.200 --> 12:51.640
love to grab a bite or a drink and do just that.

12:51.640 --> 12:55.440
So colony tracker dot live and if it works, it doesn't always work, but you'll see me

12:55.440 --> 12:59.600
there on the live map and see if I'm in your area and then you can hit that micro meetup

12:59.600 --> 13:01.720
link because wouldn't that be fun?

13:01.720 --> 13:02.720
Sit around.

13:02.720 --> 13:03.720
You know, we could dish on Mike.

13:03.720 --> 13:04.720
It'd be it'd be a blast.

13:04.720 --> 13:07.520
It'd be a blast.

13:07.520 --> 13:09.240
Leno dot com slash Coder.

13:09.240 --> 13:11.160
That's where I have that colony tracker hosted.

13:11.160 --> 13:12.400
Go there right now.

13:12.400 --> 13:17.480
Leno dot com slash Coder and get one hundred dollars in 60 day credit on a new account.

13:17.480 --> 13:20.960
Yeah, they're supporting the show and it's a great way to keep the show going is by supporting

13:20.960 --> 13:22.120
our sponsors.

13:22.120 --> 13:25.640
And we just enthusiastically endorse Linode.

13:25.640 --> 13:29.680
I get them really, to be honest with you, because they started in 2003 as one of the

13:29.680 --> 13:32.880
very first companies in this cloud computing thing.

13:32.880 --> 13:34.640
And now they've been doing it for 18 years.

13:34.640 --> 13:35.640
They're still independent.

13:35.640 --> 13:38.880
They're just now the largest independent cloud provider.

13:38.880 --> 13:43.960
They've got 11 data centers around the world and a million customers and businesses around

13:43.960 --> 13:45.080
the globe.

13:45.080 --> 13:48.240
But they've just remained focused on one thing that entire time.

13:48.240 --> 13:55.120
And geez, you know, I'm I suppose I'm about 13 years into that for the most part.

13:55.120 --> 13:59.000
But I they have they maintain a focus much better than I did initially.

13:59.000 --> 14:01.520
I kind of I kind of went meandered all over the place.

14:01.520 --> 14:06.040
It's it's it's tricky when you're a when you're a small business and you see a bunch of other

14:06.040 --> 14:07.040
things being tried.

14:07.040 --> 14:11.400
I could have seen Linode take their eye off the ball, but they never did.

14:11.400 --> 14:16.040
They just kept focusing on making cloud computing simple, affordable and accessible to all.

14:16.040 --> 14:19.840
And that means if you've been deploying servers for 20 years, you're going to love Linode.

14:19.840 --> 14:22.640
And if this is the first time you've ever done something, but you thought, what a great

14:22.640 --> 14:24.360
chance to support the show.

14:24.360 --> 14:25.700
It's going to work for you, too.

14:25.700 --> 14:29.800
They've got an app marketplace where you can deploy an entire stack or or even actually

14:29.800 --> 14:31.680
just sort of like the first third of a stack.

14:31.680 --> 14:35.840
I don't know what the term for that is, but like one that I love to go to my go to is

14:35.840 --> 14:41.680
like a Debian base or now actually CentOS base and just enough stuff to run containers.

14:41.680 --> 14:44.840
And then I just take everything from there, right, because that's just a pretty straightforward

14:44.840 --> 14:45.840
thing.

14:45.840 --> 14:48.200
And Linode's connections are so crazy fast.

14:48.200 --> 14:52.080
Plus, they have S3 compatible object storage, and I'll often tie that in with my systems

14:52.080 --> 14:53.080
for lots of storage.

14:53.080 --> 14:57.640
They have a powerful DNS manager, Kubernetes support if you're clever and you go that way

14:57.640 --> 15:01.200
as well as Terraform and just so much more.

15:01.200 --> 15:02.860
That's why you really got to go check it out.

15:02.860 --> 15:06.800
See that they're 30 to 50 percent cheaper than the big cloud providers out there.

15:06.800 --> 15:09.880
You know, they could be part of a multi cloud strategy as well.

15:09.880 --> 15:14.720
That's something to consider and a great way to learn, a great way to test something.

15:14.720 --> 15:16.520
That's often a use case for me.

15:16.520 --> 15:23.920
So go try it all out and get one hundred dollars for 60 days at Linode dot com slash coder.

15:23.920 --> 15:29.240
At the end of last week, a lot of hay was made out of Apple making concessions to settle

15:29.240 --> 15:37.120
a developer lawsuit and a ton of press ran with this story is sort of an anti-Apple story.

15:37.120 --> 15:43.440
Apple had to concede to developers, but now having a few days into this, I'm not as excited

15:43.440 --> 15:44.960
as the press seem to be.

15:44.960 --> 15:48.500
I mean, a few changes have happened in the policies.

15:48.500 --> 15:52.280
Developers can now communicate directly about alternative payment methods.

15:52.280 --> 15:55.200
But there's more to that story.

15:55.200 --> 16:00.680
Apple agreed to maintain a program it's already doing for more for three more years, and Apple's

16:00.680 --> 16:04.880
also setting up a one hundred million dollar fund for small developers.

16:04.880 --> 16:11.200
However, ironically, 30 percent of that fund is going to the lawyers that made this case

16:11.200 --> 16:13.600
happen.

16:13.600 --> 16:20.040
And the company has said that it will issue transparency reports around its app store

16:20.040 --> 16:23.160
policies for accepting and rejecting apps.

16:23.160 --> 16:24.320
What do you think, Mr. Dominic?

16:24.320 --> 16:26.720
Is this the win we were hoping for?

16:26.720 --> 16:31.020
I had an interesting kind of journey with this when I first read it, I misunderstood

16:31.020 --> 16:34.880
a key tenet of it, the anti-steering stuff.

16:34.880 --> 16:35.880
Right.

16:35.880 --> 16:39.240
So I thought it was that you could simply have alternative payment solutions in your

16:39.240 --> 16:41.760
app where you could at least link to them.

16:41.760 --> 16:42.760
That'd be huge.

16:42.760 --> 16:43.760
Right.

16:43.760 --> 16:44.760
It's not.

16:44.760 --> 16:48.000
You can say that there are alternative payment systems that exist in some amorphous place,

16:48.000 --> 16:50.180
but you may not link to them.

16:50.180 --> 16:55.720
So that reminds me of Game of Thrones, but I've seen it where Peter Dinklage's character

16:55.720 --> 17:00.900
tells Queen Daenerys, give them dragonglass because they'll feel like you gave them something

17:00.900 --> 17:02.680
and really you gave them nothing.

17:02.680 --> 17:04.560
So that's, I think, where we are.

17:04.560 --> 17:05.560
Yeah.

17:05.560 --> 17:09.480
And if you still sell something in the app, you have to use Apple's payment methods and

17:09.480 --> 17:12.240
Apple still gets their cut if you sell it via the app.

17:12.240 --> 17:17.480
I think The Verge had a great take on this, where the app store is simply too big of a

17:17.480 --> 17:23.360
too significant of a revenue item for Apple to really make any concessions at this juncture.

17:23.360 --> 17:28.040
People always talk about Apple PR and Apple marketing, and that's why people buy Apple

17:28.040 --> 17:29.040
products.

17:29.040 --> 17:30.040
And it's such a miss.

17:30.040 --> 17:31.040
Right.

17:31.040 --> 17:32.600
That's not why people are dropping thousands of dollars.

17:32.600 --> 17:39.920
I mean, brand lure is part of it, but it's this is what Apple marketing is good at.

17:39.920 --> 17:46.360
They dropped this story in a way and they fed secret partners at press outlets certain

17:46.360 --> 17:52.240
talking points, precisely in a way to get this to land as if this was a loss for Apple

17:52.240 --> 17:56.040
to look like they lost that they finally had to eat their humble pie.

17:56.040 --> 17:59.960
And you know that this is going to come up in congressional hearings in the future.

17:59.960 --> 18:04.840
And the fact that all of these press outlets wrote about it really just kind of actually

18:04.840 --> 18:07.240
further will further their case.

18:07.240 --> 18:10.400
That kind of stuff comes up all the time in those sort of hearings.

18:10.400 --> 18:14.120
And you know, like it's true that small business program is pretty great.

18:14.120 --> 18:16.480
That covers like 90 percent of the developers in the app store.

18:16.480 --> 18:17.800
I mean, I'm not trying to take away from that.

18:17.800 --> 18:20.040
I think that's a good deal.

18:20.040 --> 18:23.920
And the fact that you can mention alternative payments and maybe send them to a Web page

18:23.920 --> 18:24.920
that has stripe.

18:24.920 --> 18:25.920
Nope.

18:25.920 --> 18:26.920
No, you can't do that.

18:26.920 --> 18:27.920
No.

18:27.920 --> 18:28.920
You.

18:28.920 --> 18:31.800
So my understanding is you cannot have a button or a link in your app that sends them to the

18:31.800 --> 18:34.340
payment processing page.

18:34.340 --> 18:38.620
You may mention that if they visit, you know, your Web site, that there might be one somewhere.

18:38.620 --> 18:40.240
You may not directly link it.

18:40.240 --> 18:43.080
Well, oh, man.

18:43.080 --> 18:45.120
Right.

18:45.120 --> 18:46.120
That's a shame.

18:46.120 --> 18:47.120
I mean, that's a shame.

18:47.120 --> 18:50.840
So like Fortnite could be like, yo, dog, we have a Web site, the books might be cheaper

18:50.840 --> 18:56.000
there, but they can't be like click here to go to our, you know, blah, blah, blah portal

18:56.000 --> 18:59.200
and save 10 percent.

18:59.200 --> 19:01.260
Yeah.

19:01.260 --> 19:06.240
They also made some concessions that aren't really concessions on the search criteria,

19:06.240 --> 19:08.580
basically saying they won't screw with it much more.

19:08.580 --> 19:13.080
So the only other real thing of substance here is they are going to issue a transparency

19:13.080 --> 19:14.080
report.

19:14.080 --> 19:15.500
Does this hold any weight with you?

19:15.500 --> 19:17.520
I don't even know what that would mean.

19:17.520 --> 19:21.440
I mean, I think about like their supply chain transparency report that they publish now.

19:21.440 --> 19:26.200
So what are they going to say, like apps in these categories made, I don't know, X percent

19:26.200 --> 19:27.960
of revenue versus these?

19:27.960 --> 19:31.180
I think it's going to be actually more around what was rejected and why.

19:31.180 --> 19:34.320
That seems to be the specific language around it is they're going to issue transparency

19:34.320 --> 19:37.660
around the approval and rejection process.

19:37.660 --> 19:42.080
It's hard not to hear all of this in the context of.

19:42.080 --> 19:46.880
Of the disclosures we just got in the epic lawsuit, like, you know, they have unwritten

19:46.880 --> 19:49.240
rules about thou shalt not compete with Apple.

19:49.240 --> 19:50.240
Right.

19:50.240 --> 19:54.080
Yeah, I don't know, even in the best case, transparency doesn't necessarily mean change

19:54.080 --> 19:55.080
either.

19:55.080 --> 19:58.680
I agree, but it does suggest that they might receive pushback.

19:58.680 --> 20:02.200
They could they could be under more critical review.

20:02.200 --> 20:06.960
But that's assuming they actually are legit in what they publish.

20:06.960 --> 20:11.960
The more I review this, Mike, the more this feels like just a surprisingly well executed

20:11.960 --> 20:19.040
and very clever PR strategy by Apple to take a unrelated developer lawsuit that nobody's

20:19.040 --> 20:23.200
been talking about and make it look like they conceded.

20:23.200 --> 20:26.720
And then I'm sure this is going to help them in both their epic lawsuit somehow and also

20:26.720 --> 20:28.040
in congressional hearings.

20:28.040 --> 20:30.240
Yeah, I feel like that's exactly what it's going to do.

20:30.240 --> 20:31.240
Right.

20:31.240 --> 20:34.340
They get to say they made a preemptive concession and that Apple's made a series now of preemptive

20:34.340 --> 20:39.880
concessions with the change in the subscription revenue after a couple after what, a year

20:39.880 --> 20:43.100
or two with the small business program they launched last year.

20:43.100 --> 20:48.780
And now with these additional quote unquote concessions, they can now actually demonstrate

20:48.780 --> 20:53.720
like three or four years in a row of changes in concessions they've been making to, quote

20:53.720 --> 20:57.200
unquote, remain competitive in the developer marketplace.

20:57.200 --> 20:58.200
I don't know.

20:58.200 --> 21:01.880
It all feels like particularly with the judge in the epic case, I forgot, I think this was

21:01.880 --> 21:04.720
a verge again who had the good analysis of it.

21:04.720 --> 21:08.920
Basically she seems to be harping on the anti-steering stuff, which is this you can't tell people

21:08.920 --> 21:10.400
about other payment options.

21:10.400 --> 21:12.520
By the way, it's the same judge.

21:12.520 --> 21:16.200
I almost feel like they're kind of offering this as like, okay, your honor, we hear that

21:16.200 --> 21:18.240
you don't like this.

21:18.240 --> 21:19.240
How about this?

21:19.240 --> 21:22.560
Here's our like, you know, we suggest you order us to do the thing we'll voluntarily

21:22.560 --> 21:23.560
do anyway.

21:23.560 --> 21:24.560
Right.

21:24.560 --> 21:30.560
Very much like the Facebook FCC settlement where, you know, the FCC or was it FCC or

21:30.560 --> 21:33.640
FTC, I always get the FCC, right?

21:33.640 --> 21:35.760
FCC would be the communications agency.

21:35.760 --> 21:36.880
FTC is the trade.

21:36.880 --> 21:38.360
So it's FTC you're thinking of.

21:38.360 --> 21:42.620
It was FTC was all excited about the 50 billion or whatever it was, billion dollar fine.

21:42.620 --> 21:47.280
And Facebook was like, hey, we won and their stock price went up that day, right?

21:47.280 --> 21:48.280
I don't know.

21:48.280 --> 21:51.440
I think this is, uh, you know, I got taken by this a little bit the day it came out.

21:51.440 --> 21:52.840
Is it gaslighting?

21:52.840 --> 21:54.200
I hate that term gaslighting.

21:54.200 --> 21:58.600
I think that's something people say when they're just like, I don't know, I don't want to sound

21:58.600 --> 21:59.600
fancy.

21:59.600 --> 22:00.680
What would you describe this as?

22:00.680 --> 22:02.140
It's some sort of manipulation.

22:02.140 --> 22:06.080
It's a, if they're manipulating the perception of what's happened here, but I don't know

22:06.080 --> 22:07.080
what to call that.

22:07.080 --> 22:11.840
I mean, you know, the journalists could have done like a better job here, right?

22:11.840 --> 22:13.280
They just didn't.

22:13.280 --> 22:18.660
Apple spoon fed this to the industrial press, like the big press outlets that don't really

22:18.660 --> 22:20.400
follow the nuance of this stuff.

22:20.400 --> 22:21.400
Business press.

22:21.400 --> 22:22.400
Yeah.

22:22.400 --> 22:23.400
Right.

22:23.400 --> 22:24.400
Right.

22:24.400 --> 22:28.680
And they like Axios and, and the other outlets in that kind of category, they didn't go to

22:28.680 --> 22:33.960
like the tech crunch or the John Gruber's or somebody else out there that knows and

22:33.960 --> 22:35.560
understands these policies.

22:35.560 --> 22:40.600
They, they went to people who just would, would run with a kind of big tech bashing

22:40.600 --> 22:42.120
story.

22:42.120 --> 22:45.800
On the surface, this looks like a massive win for developers.

22:45.800 --> 22:47.880
And there are a few nuggets in here.

22:47.880 --> 22:51.360
You do get a commitment of the continuation of the small business program, which was probably

22:51.360 --> 22:55.520
a foregone conclusion, but now, now Apple's got it in writing.

22:55.520 --> 22:59.640
There is at least some improvement around communicating the fact that perhaps there's

22:59.640 --> 23:03.040
another way to pay, although it sounds like hardly a win.

23:03.040 --> 23:07.880
I think Apple did have some big changes in the works for app store search.

23:07.880 --> 23:12.080
So that way they could utilize first party data that they now seem to be the sole provider

23:12.080 --> 23:16.020
and collector of with the privacy changes in the recent iOS.

23:16.020 --> 23:17.780
And I think that's been put on hold.

23:17.780 --> 23:21.960
That's good because I think that was Apple getting creepy with the app store, which I,

23:21.960 --> 23:23.820
you know, we don't need to see any more of that.

23:23.820 --> 23:28.720
So those types of concessions in here, I think are good because they keep things at least

23:28.720 --> 23:34.080
on the, in the right direction, but they're really just guaranteeing things that we already

23:34.080 --> 23:38.960
had, which I suppose is better than losing them.

23:38.960 --> 23:42.960
But at the end of the day, I think this was, and we're going to see more of these and we're

23:42.960 --> 23:47.560
probably going to see something similar, although I bet not as well executed from Google.

23:47.560 --> 23:53.800
These are the strategic moves that these large corporations make before they get into a congressional

23:53.800 --> 23:54.800
showdown.

23:54.800 --> 23:55.800
Yep.

23:55.800 --> 23:59.960
And we have seen companies do this over and over and over again in that and the epic lawsuit

23:59.960 --> 24:02.180
are truly what this is all about.

24:02.180 --> 24:06.160
The benefits now that Apple gets to set this narrative that the press took the bait and

24:06.160 --> 24:11.920
ran with it so successfully and now has so many people cover it are just, it was one

24:11.920 --> 24:17.000
of the better executed public PR maneuvers we have seen from Apple in the Tim Cook era.

24:17.000 --> 24:19.880
I think this is his primary job, right?

24:19.880 --> 24:21.920
Keep, keep the regulators off their back.

24:21.920 --> 24:26.020
It's not product development, it's not marketing, it's yeah.

24:26.020 --> 24:29.120
Keep the profits going, which means keep services revenue up.

24:29.120 --> 24:32.960
All right, well, let's change gears.

24:32.960 --> 24:38.720
You got the details up on your election day, Linux desktop contest, and we actually do

24:38.720 --> 24:42.600
have some kids in the audience that I think would be interested to know what the deets

24:42.600 --> 24:43.600
are.

24:43.600 --> 24:44.600
Yeah.

24:44.600 --> 24:46.320
So basically you have to be a us high school and medical middle school student.

24:46.320 --> 24:47.480
It can be anything.

24:47.480 --> 24:53.560
Open source has to be on GitHub related to kind of civics or, you know, helping people

24:53.560 --> 24:57.760
find a way to vote or anything really civic civics education, right?

24:57.760 --> 25:02.000
Any platform, any language, as long as it's open source on GitHub.

25:02.000 --> 25:03.000
Big differences.

25:03.000 --> 25:07.560
We're doing three winners, so that's three Thalios and it closes on election day.

25:07.560 --> 25:11.960
We're going to announce the winners on election day, so you can just submit it by clicking

25:11.960 --> 25:13.400
the link in the blog post.

25:13.400 --> 25:16.260
Man, you're getting three Thalios.

25:16.260 --> 25:17.260
Three Thalios.

25:17.260 --> 25:22.200
I don't even know how I would get together the funds to purchase one, especially with

25:22.200 --> 25:24.560
GPU prices right now.

25:24.560 --> 25:27.680
You're a madman, but I guess that is the mad modern way.

25:27.680 --> 25:28.680
All right.

25:28.680 --> 25:29.680
Yeah.

25:29.680 --> 25:34.360
Links in the show notes at coder dot show slash four to nine and it'll be titled election

25:34.360 --> 25:40.640
day Linux desktop contest from the mad modern and just recently touring that system 76 factory.

25:40.640 --> 25:43.880
It made me want a Thalios so bad.

25:43.880 --> 25:48.040
You know, when we restarted this show, we talked a lot about our setups and some of

25:48.040 --> 25:53.120
the changes we had made and then I end up here in the RV for like a 40 day long road

25:53.120 --> 25:59.160
trip and I'm, you know, producing three or four shows a week at a minimum, sometimes

25:59.160 --> 26:03.760
five shows a week depending on what's going on and I am every time I am tearing down my

26:03.760 --> 26:08.520
setup and resetting it up and this time too, I brought the MacBook with me and had to kind

26:08.520 --> 26:12.720
of learn how to conquer that in the right way and I, it made me really kind of stop

26:12.720 --> 26:17.800
and think, I think before I ever do something like this again, I'm going to build a permanent

26:17.800 --> 26:22.400
setup, something built into the RV, you know, like a, like something that with a fold down

26:22.400 --> 26:29.040
screen and a spot to mount the microphone and I could see the M one Mac mini being a

26:29.040 --> 26:36.560
pretty clever machine because when you look at it in the benchmarks, the Mac mini is kicking

26:36.560 --> 26:43.120
in a NUX butt and it's doing it at half the wattage, like the NUX will be doing, these

26:43.120 --> 26:46.360
are really stupid rough numbers so don't take my word for it, but the NUX will be doing

26:46.360 --> 26:54.720
it like at 66 watts when its CPUs are going and the M one can do the same job at 30 watts

26:54.720 --> 27:03.600
and do it slightly faster and that for me, I am right now, I am running two laptops to

27:03.600 --> 27:07.960
do this, one's a ThinkPad and one's a MacBook and they're sucking down power and they're

27:07.960 --> 27:11.680
sucking down a lot of power and I'm running off solar, but I parked in the shade so I'm

27:11.680 --> 27:16.080
not getting a lot of solar today so today is a great example of a day where I have a

27:16.080 --> 27:21.760
full day of work, I'm recording multiple shows, my equipment needs to be running all day long

27:21.760 --> 27:28.600
and I've also got some fans running and I am just barely getting my run covered with

27:28.600 --> 27:35.440
solar and so when Apple talks about the power efficiency of the M one and we talk about

27:35.440 --> 27:39.760
it in terms of workstations and desktops, I really have this kind of aha moment where

27:39.760 --> 27:46.200
I was like oh right, it actually is going to really matter how much power my desktop

27:46.200 --> 27:50.880
draws and maybe we should all be thinking about that, maybe we should be asking if our

27:50.880 --> 27:55.440
PCs need to have thousand watt power supplies and maybe we should be thinking in general

27:55.440 --> 28:01.640
how can we build these devices to consume less power and maybe 20 years down the road

28:01.640 --> 28:04.640
more and more homes are going to be powered off solar and they're going to have to think

28:04.640 --> 28:10.800
about what they're doing with their power for the day and I feel like the power draw

28:10.800 --> 28:15.080
now of my next desktop, because I don't want it to be a laptop, I want it to be built in,

28:15.080 --> 28:21.280
something like I affixed to the wall, the power draw of my next desktop is a huge factor

28:21.280 --> 28:24.680
and I don't know, I'm just putting that out there, if other people in the audience have

28:24.680 --> 28:28.600
thoughts about power draw because there's, this is coming up, I don't know if you saw

28:28.600 --> 28:34.160
this Mike, but I think in my home state of Washington now Dell's no longer selling alien

28:34.160 --> 28:39.000
ware desktops because they draw too much power, you see this and I think California's doing

28:39.000 --> 28:40.000
it too.

28:40.000 --> 28:43.480
Yeah, I did see that, that they're limiting power draw from computers for the environmental

28:43.480 --> 28:44.480
reasons.

28:44.480 --> 28:50.240
And Apple's just sitting there laughing right now, they go for it they say, it's going to

28:50.240 --> 28:51.240
sell more Macs.

28:51.240 --> 28:58.120
All right, so I'm on the road a lot and I get asked a question frequently and I hate

28:58.120 --> 29:04.180
this question, I always have even when I worked at a nine to five job, what's the next thing

29:04.180 --> 29:09.400
for Jupiter broadcasting or what are you doing next or alternatively when I worked at a company

29:09.400 --> 29:13.540
it was, where do you see yourself in five years?

29:13.540 --> 29:19.000
This question, it implies the expectation number one for JB that growth is mandatory,

29:19.000 --> 29:24.160
I mean, yeah, growth would be nice, but also isn't there a place for like a lifestyle business

29:24.160 --> 29:30.840
that gets to a certain size, becomes sustainable and you just like have a goal of keeping that

29:30.840 --> 29:33.840
to slightly growing that like, isn't that okay?

29:33.840 --> 29:38.940
It seems like everybody always asks the question with the main goal of like, you want growth,

29:38.940 --> 29:42.480
you want, we're going to do five new shows or if I'm working for somebody, they want

29:42.480 --> 29:47.400
me to say, I want to be running the company in five years and I hate this question.

29:47.400 --> 29:49.680
Yeah, I think it's fundamentally a bad question.

29:49.680 --> 29:55.940
I know like any, you know, cool business consultant and a muscle teacher will tell you that like

29:55.940 --> 29:59.160
you need to have a goal, but the truth is when you're small, you don't know, you may

29:59.160 --> 30:03.800
have things you would like to happen, but a gentle breeze can sway you one way or the

30:03.800 --> 30:04.800
other.

30:04.800 --> 30:05.800
Yeah.

30:05.800 --> 30:06.800
Like stay flexible.

30:06.800 --> 30:07.800
Like when, why can't that be a goal?

30:07.800 --> 30:10.900
Like I'm staying flexible and I'm always kind of keeping my eye on things.

30:10.900 --> 30:15.540
So that way I can respond as market demands, like that seems like a good goal, but nobody

30:15.540 --> 30:16.540
likes that answer.

30:16.540 --> 30:17.540
No.

30:17.540 --> 30:20.600
I mean, every time I've set like a firm goal in terms of like head count or revenue, it's

30:20.600 --> 30:25.920
always been like when something imploded anybody with a goal and then COVID happened, probably

30:25.920 --> 30:27.920
was in a bit of trouble.

30:27.920 --> 30:28.920
Yeah.

30:28.920 --> 30:30.360
I generally don't even answer this question to be honest with you.

30:30.360 --> 30:31.360
That's how I handle it.

30:31.360 --> 30:34.760
I've probably been asked it 20 times in the last few weeks.

30:34.760 --> 30:38.720
And I, you know, I mean I have goals, right?

30:38.720 --> 30:43.200
But mine, mine are like, uh, I'd like to maintain and grow the business a bit.

30:43.200 --> 30:49.000
And I would, I would love to be able to launch one more show and uh, I would like to set

30:49.000 --> 30:50.520
a new tone in the Linux community.

30:50.520 --> 30:55.440
And that's something I've actually been thinking about pretty seriously is how could I position

30:55.440 --> 31:02.260
the shows in such a way that maybe we stopped like this, uh, like shaming people for using

31:02.260 --> 31:03.720
a tool different than you.

31:03.720 --> 31:05.520
Um, it's just so tribal.

31:05.520 --> 31:08.800
And I think it's a huge turnoff to people that are coming into the Linux community.

31:08.800 --> 31:13.800
Like I think about, there was a couple of years ago, a mutual friend of ours made a

31:13.800 --> 31:19.680
lot of hay that the Linux foundation director, uh, Jim Zimmerman or whatever his name is,

31:19.680 --> 31:23.960
sorry, I'm forgetting right now, uh, was using a Mac during the presentation.

31:23.960 --> 31:28.240
And you know, um, multiple YouTube videos were made about this and you know, Twitter,

31:28.240 --> 31:32.760
uh, threads and a lot of, a lot of public shaming, you know, the people gathered in

31:32.760 --> 31:35.480
the circle to, uh, throw their stones.

31:35.480 --> 31:41.920
And um, it seems so short-sighted because the reality is that there's probably a lot

31:41.920 --> 31:45.360
more people that are running Linux on the server connecting in through a terminal on

31:45.360 --> 31:48.120
all kinds of different hardware and desktops.

31:48.120 --> 31:52.600
And I think the community has to be way more welcoming to that kind of person.

31:52.600 --> 31:57.160
Like if you've got a VPS and a raspberry PI and you know, you consider yourself a Linux

31:57.160 --> 31:58.160
user, then you're welcome.

31:58.160 --> 32:01.660
Or if you've, you know, just listening because you're interested, you should be welcome and

32:01.660 --> 32:03.760
you shouldn't feel bad for using a Mac.

32:03.760 --> 32:09.160
Like I was joking that listener Mike, when we met up in Denver, he felt, he felt legitimately

32:09.160 --> 32:12.240
like he had to apologize for a Mac book in our presence.

32:12.240 --> 32:15.600
And you know, I'm sitting here right now with one of my machines in front of me is a Mac

32:15.600 --> 32:16.600
book.

32:16.600 --> 32:19.460
And I don't like that this has become so tribal.

32:19.460 --> 32:25.280
And so, so I don't know, just, it's like a, it's a bad attitude in the Linux community.

32:25.280 --> 32:26.280
I think makes us look bad.

32:26.280 --> 32:27.880
And I think it needs to be extended beyond that.

32:27.880 --> 32:32.040
And that would be a goal of mine of trying to reposition our community.

32:32.040 --> 32:35.360
And I think our community is well positioned to do it already cause that's already, a lot

32:35.360 --> 32:37.280
of our community is already that way.

32:37.280 --> 32:41.040
Like doing those kinds of things are goals, but it's, that's, that's not something that

32:41.040 --> 32:44.460
you can just say in like an elevator type conversation.

32:44.460 --> 32:48.520
And I'd be curious to know what the audience and how they answer when somebody says, what's

32:48.520 --> 32:49.520
next for your company?

32:49.520 --> 32:55.240
I'd love anybody out there who runs a small business and, and doesn't want it to be huge.

32:55.240 --> 32:59.240
You know, of course I'd love growth and more revenue and I, you know, I'd love that kind

32:59.240 --> 33:01.480
of stuff, but I'd love your input.

33:01.480 --> 33:04.960
And also if you've worked out there in a career and they ask you, what are you doing the next

33:04.960 --> 33:06.160
five years?

33:06.160 --> 33:07.160
What do you say?

33:07.160 --> 33:08.440
How do you handle that?

33:08.440 --> 33:10.660
Coder.show slash contact.

33:10.660 --> 33:13.140
Also thank you to our Coder QA team out there.

33:13.140 --> 33:15.280
You guys keep us going, keep us independent.

33:15.280 --> 33:19.680
And as a thank you, you get a limited ad feed and you get the Coderly that comes out every

33:19.680 --> 33:20.760
quarter.

33:20.760 --> 33:25.460
And that is that Coder QA.co Mr. Dominic, is there anywhere you would like to send people

33:25.460 --> 33:26.460
this week?

33:26.460 --> 33:28.320
Just add to Manuka on Twitter.

33:28.320 --> 33:29.600
That's simple.

33:29.600 --> 33:31.160
That's a secret recipe right there.

33:31.160 --> 33:34.960
And of course we do have the link for the contest information for those three Thaleos

33:34.960 --> 33:35.960
in the show notes.

33:35.960 --> 33:41.400
In fact, links to everything we talked about today at Coder.show slash four two nine.

33:41.400 --> 33:44.520
You go over there while you're there, you can hit that contact form and let us know

33:44.520 --> 33:45.520
your thoughts.

33:45.520 --> 33:46.520
That's a huge part of the show.

33:46.520 --> 33:50.280
It's a good way for us to gauge the audience interest in an episode, even if you didn't

33:50.280 --> 33:51.500
like it.

33:51.500 --> 33:56.560
And you also find resources to subscribe in your pod catcher of choice and you could always

33:56.560 --> 33:57.680
consider joining us.

33:57.680 --> 34:01.700
Let me tell you, it was quite the investment of effort to get the live stream going this

34:01.700 --> 34:02.700
week.

34:02.700 --> 34:05.080
And I'm sure it will be for a while while I'm on the road.

34:05.080 --> 34:08.160
So go see how it all comes together at JBLive.TV.

34:08.160 --> 34:12.600
We do it at noon Pacific, three p.m. Eastern over there, and you can get it converted at

34:12.600 --> 34:14.840
Jupiter broadcasting dot com slash calendar.

34:14.840 --> 34:16.000
Thanks for joining us.

34:16.000 --> 34:24.760
See you next week.
