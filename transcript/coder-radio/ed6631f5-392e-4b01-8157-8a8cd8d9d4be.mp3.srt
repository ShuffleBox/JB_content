00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
This is Koto Radio, episode 374 for September 9th, 2019.

2
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Hello, and welcome to Koto Radio, Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show,

3
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,000
taking a pragmatic look at the art and business of software development and related technologies.

4
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Sometimes it's just all about the related technologies, but you know what? Those are important.

5
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
So important, well, I'm going to need some help.

6
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm Wes, of course, and I'm joined by our favorite rampaging Rubyist, Mr. Michael Dominick.

7
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Welcome back to the show, Mike.

8
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Hello, Wes. How are you?

9
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Oh, wonderful. Nice to be connected with you.

10
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
There's a lot going on out in the software development ecosystem that we find ourselves in,

11
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
so we better get on with our show today.

12
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I'd like to start things off with like a little correction, because you know what?

13
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:19,000
We're here every week live spewing out our opinions, and oftentimes we get something wrong,

14
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
either just totally by mistake or the wrong word comes out.

15
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,000
So last week, we may have implied that the new macOS shell was going to be Phish,

16
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
and I think we both wish that was true.

17
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I know I do, but no.

18
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Some very wise people gave us some feedback over at coderradio.reddit.com,

19
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:42,000
and of course, as we've previously talked about and should well have known, that shell is ZSH.

20
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Yes, it is a Z shell. That's my bad.

21
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I just love Phish shells so much, I thought my dreams were coming true.

22
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Well, we can hope.

23
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
And of course, if you'd like Phish on macOS, well, that's easily done.

24
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
How do you usually install it?

25
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Is that from brew or elsewhere?

26
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Yeah, just brew.

27
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Easy.

28
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
All right, well, let's hit a few more feedback items while we're here.

29
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Just a quick one from Juni.

30
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
What if Perl 6?

31
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Last episode, you guys got on talking about shell scripting,

32
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
interpreted languages, REPLs, and command line interfaces,

33
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,000
and it really just made me think more about Perl 6.

34
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
It's Lispier, it's got more metaprogramming and more of a focus on a REPL,

35
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
and much more modern than Perl 5.

36
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
After three to four years, it hasn't seen the light of day, though.

37
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Would you find it useful?

38
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Like a Python alternative for shorter but maybe more complicated scripts?

39
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Thanks for your opinion.

40
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
So what about you, Mike?

41
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
You know, I don't think we've talked much about Perl at all,

42
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
besides, you know, maybe the odd joke or two that always ends up sneaking in.

43
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I don't think we have either, and we've been doing the show a long time.

44
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I mean, yeah, Perl is a language that has been around for a long time

45
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
that I can tell you I have never used.

46
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
What about you, Wes?

47
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Oh, no, I've used Perl 5 far more than I'd care to.

48
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
There's a lot to like about it, honestly.

49
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
There's a lot of really neat things, a lot of good Lisp influence.

50
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I think it's an interesting language.

51
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,000
It just fell into a kind of strange niche where it was used in very clever ways,

52
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
and there's so many different ways to say things, at least in Perl 5.

53
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
It can be pretty hard, whereas it's easy to see a Python script

54
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
and pick your way through that.

55
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
A lot more complicated if you're not well acquainted with Perl.

56
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Perl 6, though, is kind of an interesting case.

57
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I've not actually played with it, and I think that's unfortunately true

58
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
of many people who'd previously used some Perl 5,

59
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
because it's just a very different language with the same name.

60
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Now, obviously, it's a big version change, but I don't know.

61
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I mean, you know my proclivities for name changes,

62
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
but it seems like there's enough novelty in there.

63
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
There's interesting stuff.

64
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
It deserves consideration probably, at least as much as any random language does,

65
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
and hasn't really seen that just because it's not exciting.

66
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
It doesn't seem different enough maybe, or people just aren't interested

67
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
because it's still got that Perl nomiker.

68
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
And it's tough today, too, because I feel like we're coming out

69
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
with like five languages a week now.

70
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Yes, and many of them have big corporate back-end, right?

71
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
So this is kind of more of an old-school, open-source style language.

72
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
And as we've seen less and less sort of, you know, like sysadmin stuff,

73
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
people writing these quick little shell scripts,

74
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
not in like a bigger language.

75
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Well, it's a different time.

76
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
That it is.

77
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Here's something for you, Mike.

78
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Actually, something for me, too, of course.

79
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
And that's some feedback from our friend Nuclear Nick,

80
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
who's writing to us about Pry.

81
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
In a previous episode, I was amazed to hear that Mike had never used Pry before.

82
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
It's one of the first things I show off to people when introducing them to Ruby.

83
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
And then you guys can go find it in the show notes.

84
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
He's got a great little example of how you can use things like CD and LS

85
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
and all the little affordances that are available in Pry,

86
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
just to make it a little bit easier as you're exploring

87
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
and trying to learn a new language.

88
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
So what do you think, Mike?

89
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Are you willing to give it a try?

90
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I mean, just to gem and stall away.

91
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Yeah, I actually have to give that a shot.

92
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
He's absolutely correct.

93
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I have not used it.

94
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I still have not used it, but you know what?

95
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I'll make it my homework for this week to give Pry a look.

96
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
And if not, I'm sure more people will write in

97
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
and we'll just have to keep shaming you right here on the show.

98
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Listen, just like Game of Thrones, just go shame, shame.

99
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
You'll get there eventually.

100
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
All right, well, here's something that I'm curious about your input on.

101
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
That's our last little feedback item today from Justin,

102
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
and he writes to us about learning web development.

103
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Hey, guys.

104
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I'm currently a senior at Purdue studying cybersecurity and web development.

105
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I'm in a weird place, though, because with web development,

106
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I didn't start in this major.

107
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I've just sort of jumped in now as a senior,

108
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
and I don't have the past three years of classes and background.

109
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Instead, I learned all about IT and systems administration.

110
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Want a new Bantu box set up as a Kubernetes master with 20 nodes

111
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
and your services configured, load balanced, and automatically backed up?

112
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Say no more.

113
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I got that.

114
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:52,000
But want a three-page responsive website about your dog built with Bootstrap?

115
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
That I can't do.

116
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I feel woefully unready, and I was wondering if either of you

117
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,000
had suggestions for structured content around web dev design,

118
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
things I could use to augment my learning.

119
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Thanks a bunch.

120
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Yeah, that's a really interesting question,

121
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
and every once in a while we get a form of this question.

122
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I have to say, if you have this IT background, this IT administration,

123
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
this kind of DevOps-y background, that's great, right?

124
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Everybody's looking for that guy who can do web dev plus DevOps.

125
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
In terms of structured courses, there's obviously the Linux Academy stuff.

126
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
It is a little more on that IT administration pathway.

127
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I think that's a fair characterization.

128
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
At least most of the content.

129
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Yeah.

130
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I used to recommend, when we got this question years ago, Code School.

131
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
They had a, particularly for front-end web development,

132
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:46,000
they had a really good, I think they called it like Pathways of JavaScript.

133
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Unfortunately, when they got purchased by Pluralsight,

134
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
they actually kind of shut down most of that style of content,

135
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
which was interesting.

136
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I don't know of a structured class or format that I would recommend now.

137
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
There's obviously Code Academy.

138
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
There's boot camps, but then you have to pay,

139
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
and you're just getting out of school.

140
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I would maybe look at Code Academy.

141
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
In fact, if you do, I would encourage you to write back in,

142
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
unless Wes has the silver bullet.

143
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
No, unfortunately I don't.

144
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
It can be one of those frustrating things,

145
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
especially in web development where it moves so fast.

146
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
There's plenty of outdated CSS and JavaScript tutorials out there,

147
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
but that's probably not what you want.

148
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
It's especially difficult when you're new and don't know how to filter

149
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,000
what's good or old or outdated information just to find the best sources.

150
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
So unfortunately, no, I don't have a super solid answer,

151
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
but maybe our community can help.

152
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
If you have any favorite web development courses,

153
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
well, please do let us know and we'll pass it along,

154
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
coder.show slash contact.

155
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I do like your point there, Mike, though.

156
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Having that IT background, that is going to be a huge plus,

157
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
and you're probably just going to have to struggle through some things,

158
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
keep playing with the web tech,

159
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
and eventually you'll have enough of it under your belt

160
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
that the rest will start to come easier.

161
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Your point, too, this front-end,

162
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
particularly the front-end JavaScript-y framework stuff,

163
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,000
is so aggressive with how quickly they're moving.

164
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I would rather be starting from his position of knowing IT administration

165
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
and DevOps, at least to a point,

166
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
if someone who studied it in school,

167
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
because you're going to be relearning web technology.

168
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
It's like our story coming up about TypeScript, right?

169
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Yes, exactly. That's key.

170
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
You're going to have to relearn.

171
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
It sounds like you've already got some good skills about learning to learn,

172
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
being able to learn, so pick some stuff.

173
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
If you can find some good tutorials,

174
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I would worry maybe a little bit less just right now

175
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
about if it's exactly the best stack or tech,

176
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
and once you've kind of got all the fundamentals done,

177
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
you've done it once, it makes it a lot easier to jump ship.

178
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Speaking of TypeScript, nothing too deep here,

179
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:54,000
but I just saw an interesting GitHub issue filed by Google,

180
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
and I think this is kind of a fun case study

181
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,000
of two giant organizations collaborating on open source

182
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
and working together out in the open.

183
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,000
So this is Google feedback on TypeScript 3.5.

184
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
We recently upgraded Google to use TypeScript 3.5,

185
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
and here's some feedback.

186
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Now, for background, they write,

187
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,000
recall that Google is a mono repo of billions of lines of code.

188
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
We use a single version of TypeScript

189
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
and a single set of compiler flags across all teams

190
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
and upgrade these simultaneously for everyone.

191
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
So, oof.

192
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Nightmareland.

193
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
That's a big undertaking already.

194
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Yeah.

195
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
So we know and expect every TypeScript upgrade

196
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
to involve some work, and, you know, honestly,

197
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
improvements to the standard library are expected

198
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
and welcomed by us,

199
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
even though they often mean removing similar

200
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
but incompatible things we have in our own code.

201
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,000
However, TypeScript 3.5 was a lot more work for us

202
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
than other recent upgrades.

203
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
There were three main changes in 3.5

204
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
that made it especially painful,

205
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
and we believe most of these changes were intentional

206
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
and intended to improve type checking,

207
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
but we also believe the TypeScript team understands

208
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
that type checking is always just a trade-off

209
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
between safety and ergonomics,

210
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
which that's just an interesting observation

211
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
that doesn't always get made.

212
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
So if you're interested, if you're a TypeScript user,

213
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I definitely recommend kind of just checking this out.

214
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
It's interesting as an insight into, you know,

215
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
how Google used this tech

216
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
and just some of the back and forth between people

217
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
from both organizations, you know,

218
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
operating politely, nicely, productively.

219
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
There's just a lot of, like, polite language here

220
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
that you wouldn't even have to be necessarily

221
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
to phrase it this way,

222
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
but, you know, there's a breaking change,

223
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
and they write,

224
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
historically, when TypeScript has introduced

225
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
type system changes like this, they were behind a flag.

226
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Suggestion, using a flag here

227
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
would have allowed us to adapt to this change

228
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
separately from the other breaking changes in 3.5.

229
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
So there's no, you know, it's not like a bunch of blame.

230
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
It's not being upset.

231
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
It's all just very well articulated.

232
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Yeah, I mean, this is really the full-on

233
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
open source dream here, right?

234
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
And also, what happened to Dart?

235
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
What happened to Dart?

236
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Oh, boy, that's an interesting question.

237
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
That jumped right out at me when you put this

238
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
one on the dock. I was like, huh.

239
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Must suck to be on the Dart team.

240
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I mean, there's so much going on in that space.

241
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
And obviously, Google is

242
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
a giant organization with lots of projects

243
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
underway. Well, we should give the TypeScript

244
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
team credit, right? They have,

245
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
of all the, let's say,

246
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
pseudo-JavaScript-y languages, CoffeeScript,

247
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Dart, TypeScript, we could keep

248
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
going, but why?

249
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I think TypeScript has, I don't want to say

250
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
it's become the standard if you're not using

251
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
straight JavaScript, but

252
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I think it's, I wonder how you,

253
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
what you're seeing, but what I'm seeing when I'm looking at

254
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
people who are looking to employ

255
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
people, people looking for contractors

256
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
to do work, people looking to hire

257
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
dev shops, if it's a front-end job,

258
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
and if they're not just saying, hey, we need

259
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
a web job done,

260
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
they're asking for TypeScript specifically.

261
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Yeah, and I mean, I think

262
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
it's becoming especially popular

263
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
in the cases kind of that it was designed

264
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
for, right? And that's big, large organizations,

265
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
people like Microsoft and Google,

266
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
who have a lot of engineers working on lots of

267
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
projects and find that

268
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
some of the additional structure and

269
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
compile time checking provided by TypeScript

270
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
is really helpful. Google's employee

271
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
here says, I'd like to emphasize that

272
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
we are very happy with TypeScript in

273
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
general, and they're just hopeful that the feedback

274
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
helps make it better. But you're right, I mean

275
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
TypeScript has become, maybe

276
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
not quite de facto, but

277
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
something pretty close. And

278
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
now with RMS talking at Microsoft

279
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
and Google and Microsoft

280
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
collaborating on GitHub together,

281
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
I think we have entered the Kumbaya

282
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
hippie age. Well, we can

283
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
only hope, you know, hey,

284
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
open source benefits everyone. That's right, keep it

285
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
free. Unless, of course, you're on the App Store.

286
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Boom. You pointed

287
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
at us this week to some

288
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
interesting stories actually coming out of multiple outlets

289
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
highlighting something you've been talking

290
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
about on the show for literally

291
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
years, Mike.

292
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
And that's how Apple,

293
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
what Apple does with competitor apps.

294
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Apple does something what they

295
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
call Sherlocking, which has nothing to do with

296
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Benedict Cumberbatch or

297
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
21B Baker Street, and has

298
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
everything to do with an app that was called Sherlock,

299
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
where they simply implemented

300
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
its functionality in an old version. I think it was

301
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
like Mac OS. Higer?

302
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Right, okay, so Sherlock

303
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
was a third party app that you could

304
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
use to go find stuff on your file

305
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
system, right, or integrate with apps and stuff.

306
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Yeah, like Spotlight if you're a Mac user,

307
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
right? Right.

308
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
And they've continued to do this.

309
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
They've kind of always done this, even back in like the

310
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Mac OS 9 days.

311
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
It's one of these topics that

312
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
I wanted to put on the show out of

313
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
pure spite, because for years

314
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
you would get feedback

315
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
back in the bad old days when it was just

316
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Chris and I before you

317
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
joined us with your radiance.

318
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
I interloped, you know. No,

319
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
you were like an angel descending.

320
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
I want everybody to know that Wes

321
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
is angelic.

322
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
You have to be divine to

323
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
be able to understand Clojure.

324
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
I don't know about that, but I

325
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
appreciate the compliment. Yeah, so Apple

326
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
is like hyper aggressive at basically

327
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
and I'm not going to do the whole lecture I used to,

328
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
but commoditizing their compliments, right?

329
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Basically, there's a set

330
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
amount of value per user that is

331
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
available per iPhone. Apple makes sure

332
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
they get the most of it. They aggressively

333
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
drive down software prices.

334
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
And if there is an app

335
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
that is effectively a de facto standard

336
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
for iOS or

337
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
even Mac OS, they will just

338
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
eventually implement that as part of the OS.

339
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Now you could argue, well, that's a better user

340
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
experience. Maybe it is, maybe it isn't, but they have

341
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
not been shy about just

342
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
putting people out of business.

343
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
And giving that iOS, particularly

344
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
for all those years of mobile,

345
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
was really the only platform

346
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
that made any money for independent

347
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
developers. Right, I mean, for a long time

348
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
there had been, that had kind of been the success story,

349
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
right? Here is the platform you can target

350
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
and because in part of some of the things Apple

351
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
has done to make it that way,

352
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
it was a profitable marketplace, at least for a

353
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
time. I think the best case is

354
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
not Apple straight up Sherlocking

355
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
your app, which does happen, but that has been

356
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
happening less and less.

357
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
But how about like if you're Spotify and they just

358
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
make it, you know, financially

359
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
disadvantageous and technically

360
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
disadvantageous for users to

361
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
use you as their preferred service

362
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
over Apple's competitive service.

363
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
This is

364
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
going to be a huge deal as

365
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
we go into more and more automated

366
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
voice technologies where you don't

367
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
have just like, you know, where it's like

368
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
you know, Miss

369
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Miss A, I hope I'm trying

370
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
not to trigger people's echoes,

371
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
you know, Miss Echo, Echo, do this

372
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
or hey,

373
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
so and so, do that.

374
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
The platform vendor

375
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
gets to pick what software is

376
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
actually run, right? There's very

377
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
important defaults there, right?

378
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
And they can make it like they can allow

379
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
third parties were like, I think you can do

380
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
hey, so and so play something on

381
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Spotify, but

382
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
that's garbage, right? That's

383
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
that's not nearly as good. There's no way just to set

384
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
it to Spotify.

385
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
So I think this is an important

386
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
story, and I definitely want to get your perspective,

387
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
but my only criticism of

388
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
kind of the pieces we have here is that they

389
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
focus a little bit, particularly the Washington Post

390
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
went a little bit too much on straight up Sherlocking,

391
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
which is terrible,

392
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
but it's something that's happening less and less

393
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
and they really should focus more on

394
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
the platform vendor giving

395
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
its applications an unfair advantage.

396
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
And that could be anything from

397
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
not charging themselves 30% to

398
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
being able to use

399
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
private APIs.

400
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Right? That's a big one.

401
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
There's a lot to unpack here.

402
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
There's another piece we'll have linked in the show notes from

403
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
the Times, and they talk a lot more

404
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
about some of the search algorithm and what's

405
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
going on there, how changes get made

406
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
and basically, you know, the impact of the

407
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
small team that makes the decisions of

408
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
how that algorithm works

409
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
and point out some things that have changed.

410
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Way back when in 2018, if you searched

411
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
podcast, say, then you'd have

412
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
to wade through like 14 Apple apps

413
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
before you even found the first

414
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
non-Apple app. Now that we should know

415
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
that's no longer the case, but it just goes

416
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
to show there's a lot

417
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
of power there. Yeah, I mean, and the other thing

418
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
I think we both kind of forgot. It's not just

419
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
search, right? It's also app store

420
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
editorial if they decide to feature you.

421
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
One running story we had for a long time was

422
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
we used to track

423
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
ex-Apple employees going independent

424
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
and how quickly

425
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
they became featured, even if their apps were kind of

426
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
you know, didn't do much.

427
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
That is like

428
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
and I'll dig it out, but from 2015

429
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
there was a pretty

430
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
clear analysis, I think Marco Arment, but I could

431
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
be wrong, so don't hold me to that, did that of when his

432
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
app was featured and when it wasn't, and just the

433
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
dramatic difference in revenue.

434
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
So it is a hugely

435
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
controlled

436
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
ecosystem

437
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
to work in as an independent business

438
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
and I

439
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
if that

440
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
is something that I think just needs to be looked

441
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
at, particularly, again, like the

442
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Spotify-like cases. Yeah, and it is

443
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
interesting, like you don't, there's not a lot of communication

444
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
either, right? So you may be working on some

445
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
app that you think will be really successful and fills a hole

446
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
in the ecosystem and Apple might come out

447
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
a month after you launch it and they have

448
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
their better built-in platform version.

449
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Yeah, but again, right, communication is another

450
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
great point. Depending on who

451
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
you are, and I myself had this experience

452
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
where I had clients who were very much favored

453
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
because they were bigger companies and Apple wanted their

454
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
apps in the store, you could actually get

455
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
quite a bit of hand-holding.

456
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
And like you were allowed to kind of wink, wink, nudge, nudge

457
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
bounce ideas, will this be acceptable, this not.

458
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
But if you're just an indie, you're

459
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
a lamb amongst wolves, basically.

460
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Right, no feedback, no responses,

461
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
and just submit it

462
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
and find out, follow the process, Mike.

463
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Exactly, yep. Well, that's

464
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
disappointing. I know we've seen lots of other complaints, you know, there's similar

465
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
platform problems

466
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
like in other industries, for example, Amazon,

467
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
right, there's been complaints

468
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
of similar behavior where they're able to use

469
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
all the access and data and behind-the-scenes

470
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
knowledge they have and launch their own

471
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
products to compete with whatever is successful on their

472
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
existing marketplace. And

473
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
more and more we see that, you know, this default,

474
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
this platform effect, I think it's just going to be

475
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
a continued problem as we shift

476
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
ever more of the things that we consume to

477
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
various platforms running

478
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
online. So, Wes, making

479
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
you king for a day, because I'm actually curious

480
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
what you think about coming this from more of a, like, Linux

481
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Fosse perspective.

482
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Do you think it should just, like, should

483
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
we put on our Elizabeth Warren hat and say, if

484
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
you are the platform vendor, right, if you run the

485
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
App Store, maybe you're just not allowed

486
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
to have your own apps? I guess that's always the

487
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
question. Like, where do you put the boundary, though? Because, like, what's an

488
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
app and what's part of the base OS?

489
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
You're so smart, I was going to trap you.

490
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Would you mandate that, like, there's

491
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
something relevant between how you ship that, right, and

492
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
there's, doesn't compete in the same way because it wouldn't

493
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
show up in the App Store? So, basically, like,

494
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Microsoft saying Internet Explorer is part of Windows

495
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
in 1990, whatever, 1999,

496
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
yeah. Yeah, right, and there's going to be a bunch of

497
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
problems there, too. Well, how about, like, the

498
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
mail apps and the built-in apps on the iOS

499
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
are never actually deleted

500
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
even if you delete them? There

501
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
are some questions, but that's a great point, and, like, Siri

502
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
is part of the operating system.

503
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
So, would this apply to Siri's

504
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
skills?

505
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
I think is the correct word for the API these days.

506
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
And what about something like an Alexa?

507
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Mmm. Mmm.

508
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
You know, it is tricky. There's not a lot of

509
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
clear answers here, unfortunately.

510
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
And I realize I just triggered, like, everybody's

511
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
devices. Sorry. Whoopsie.

512
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
So, I don't know. I don't know that

513
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
what's happening now is what we want,

514
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
but it's hard to say exactly

515
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
what the best way to change this would be. Maybe

516
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
there would be ways to have

517
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
some degree of separation, not necessarily, like,

518
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
a hard ban, but

519
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
ways to make it so that those apps

520
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
had to follow more of the same standards.

521
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
But I don't know how you would impose

522
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
that in a reasonable way, either, and that's a whole

523
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
other question. Yeah, so speaking

524
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
of things that are going to be painful.

525
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Oh, I don't know about that, Mike.

526
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Really? Because I have a feeling we have

527
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
quite a few Python 2 developers in the audience.

528
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
We probably do, and

529
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
they've probably seen this post

530
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
over on python.org.

531
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
It's all about sun setting Python

532
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
2. News is in.

533
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
We have decided that January 1st,

534
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
2020, will be the day that

535
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
we sunset Python 2.

536
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
That means that we will not improve it anymore

537
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
after that day, even if

538
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
someone finds a security problem.

539
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
You should upgrade to Python 3

540
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
as soon as you can, Mike. Not a problem.

541
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
I'm already on Python 3. Yeah, right.

542
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
If you're starting today, just stay away from

543
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Python 2. Just don't, you know, don't touch it.

544
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Stick with Python 3. You'll be way happier.

545
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
It's better. It's getting support.

546
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
It's getting feature improvements,

547
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
and honestly, it's become a pretty nice

548
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
language. Yeah, it is actually pretty nice

549
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
to work in. I mean, it lacks the elegance and grace

550
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
of Ruby, but other than that,

551
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
it's fine. You know, it's

552
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
not a tool for someone as sophisticated

553
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
as you, Mike. It's a tool for us commoners,

554
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
the rest of us out there. Well, right. Like, when you write

555
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Python, you don't weep at the beauty of your

556
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
code. No, I'm too busy getting stuff done.

557
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Oh, I see

558
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
what you did there. No,

559
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
I know you're deeper in the Pythonista

560
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
land than I am. Is this like, I feel

561
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
like Python 2 has been on its last leg

562
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
for a very long time. Yeah, well,

563
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
OK, so I like the rationale

564
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
here. Why are we doing this? We need

565
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
to sunset Python 2 so we can help

566
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Python users. All right. I mean,

567
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
that's a I like the sounds of that.

568
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
We released Python 2 in

569
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
2000, the year 2000.

570
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
We realized a few years later

571
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
that we needed to make big changes

572
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
to improve Python. So in 2006,

573
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
we started Python 3.

574
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Many people read most

575
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
did not upgrade, and we did not

576
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
want to hurt them. So for many years

577
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
we've kept improving and publishing

578
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
both Python 2 and

579
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Python 3. But this makes

580
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
it hard to improve Python.

581
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Their improvements Python 2 can't handle

582
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
and we have less time to work on making

583
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Python 3 better and

584
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
faster. And honestly, yeah,

585
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
I think this kind of just needed to happen.

586
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
It's been one of those transitions. It's been

587
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
going on for so long,

588
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
right? I mean, at this point over a decade

589
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
and for a long time, it felt like it just wasn't

590
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
going to happen. You know, like none of the big

591
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
the big tech giants were really using

592
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Python 3. It didn't feel like

593
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
if you were a contractor or coming into an org,

594
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
you could really go to Python 3 unless you

595
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
were willing to personally go

596
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
spend the hours to convert their code base.

597
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
And there just weren't that many

598
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
big success stories. I think a lot

599
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
of that's changed though. Okay, so

600
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
has it changed

601
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
because, and this is me straight up asking,

602
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
I actually don't know the answer. Is it changed because

603
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
most new platforms

604
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
and new organizations are just starting with Python

605
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
3 or is it changing because there's been

606
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
methodologies around migrating?

607
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
I think there's a lot. Yeah, you have seen more

608
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
more big players make the good

609
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
calls and take on that technical debt and actually

610
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
push forward. And so that's meant they've had

611
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
hours of their own engineers that they can help if they

612
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
do use open source projects. Some

613
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
of them have then contributed as well as the communities

614
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
move too. So more and more of the big

615
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
popular libraries

616
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
that people need are either compatible

617
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
with both or in some cases only Python

618
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
3 now. I think also some of the

619
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
you know, the conversion code has gotten a little bit

620
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
smoother over the years. So there's a nice

621
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
two to three sort of script out there in the library

622
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
that you can use to help ease the transition.

623
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
And you've just at this point

624
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
you have enough

625
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
people out there using it, I guess. I don't know when

626
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
that tipped or how you judge.

627
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
And there's still a lot of holdouts, right?

628
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
There's still popular libraries that maybe haven't

629
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
haven't made the jump yet.

630
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
I'm curious how it plays, you know,

631
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
what part it plays in the larger Python

632
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
resurgence we've seen as well.

633
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Because, you know, there's a time kind of like it was thought

634
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
of along with Ruby. They both had their popular

635
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
web frameworks in that space and sure it was

636
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
doing lots of lots of math and science

637
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
stuff. But those all kind of blocked away in

638
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
you know, little research labs or universities

639
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
somewhere. But these

640
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
days Python's huge.

641
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
The Python is now an

642
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
anaconda. Yeah, I think it is.

643
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
The other thing you've seen a lot of

644
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
just at the same time

645
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
is more Python type checking,

646
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
right? So I think that kind of goes

647
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
hand in hand. More big organizations

648
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
are realizing people like Dropbox say that

649
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
all right, well, we've committed ourselves to

650
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
using this library where

651
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
we've got a lot of code in it and

652
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
we're having problems. So

653
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Dropbox just put out a great sort of

654
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
summary of their journey to type checking four

655
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
million lines of Python.

656
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
They're obviously a big user

657
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
and as they say,

658
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
the dynamic typing in Python made code

659
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
needlessly hard to understand and

660
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
started to seriously impact productivity.

661
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
So they've started

662
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
using MyPy and it's

663
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
a fascinating post because it kind of

664
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
tells the story from when they just

665
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
started using it as sort of a research project

666
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
internally. But now they

667
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
write like present day type checking and type

668
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
hinting is a normal thing for numerous

669
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
developers not only within Dropbox

670
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
but just in the wider

671
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Python community. So in some senses it almost

672
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
strikes me as what's been happening to the

673
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
JavaScript community where you had this old language

674
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
felt stagnant and you just get

675
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
enough developer mass, developer

676
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
time, interest, community

677
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
building and you

678
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
can modernize and change things and get people to

679
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
actually adopt it. I think it does help

680
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
too that really they're not, Python

681
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
3 and 2 aren't like super different, you know?

682
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
You get a print function instead

683
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
of a print statement and then most of the rest of the other

684
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
stuff is just pretty much straight

685
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
up improvements. I don't know,

686
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
just interesting, I just remember for years reading

687
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
comments like, Python 2 to 3 is

688
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
an example of a transition done very poorly

689
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
that you shouldn't do. Yeah, that was

690
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
my impression that like they were effectively

691
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
different languages at this point because my Python

692
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
experience has been, can't

693
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
say entirely in 3 but you know, beyond

694
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
just like little scripts that

695
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
I inherited on like two projects.

696
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
When I'm talking about like writing

697
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
full scale applications in Python, it's

698
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
only been 3. It's curious

699
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
to me how long this took

700
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
if that makes sense, right? Like someone in the chat

701
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
room mentioned it's because like there's

702
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Oracle dependencies if you're an Oracle

703
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
shop. That seems weird though because wouldn't

704
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
Oracle just like also want to

705
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
upgrade? Or am I missing some key

706
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
like technical issue

707
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
between 2 and 3? Well, I mean there's always

708
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
just technical debt too, right? You gotta be willing to spend

709
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
the time and therefore

710
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
money to convert it. So it's

711
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
the business? Yeah, exactly.

712
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
It's the business. The art

713
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
is clear, right? You just gotta move right on.

714
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
Just do the work, right? Okay.

715
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
So speaking of things that

716
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
aren't business. Hey, do you want to play

717
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
some Final Fantasy 7 using the.NET

718
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
runtime? Yeah. Yeah, I do.

719
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
Of course I do. You know I like.NET, Mike.

720
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
Well then do I have the GitHub for you.

721
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
The project

722
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
PSX, X as in Xena,

723
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
is an experimental C

724
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
sharp emulator. You mean

725
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
it's a C sharp PlayStation emulator?

726
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
That's crazy. That's crazy. Yes, because

727
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
emulating C sharp would be weird. Yes.

728
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
No, I like that though. Wow.

729
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
This actually looks pretty cool.

730
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
It's new. It's pure C sharp. So

731
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
that's kind of handy if you're interested in kind

732
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
of seeing how that might be done. I don't know.

733
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
A little bit of F sharp could have gotten in there if you asked me,

734
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
but you know. Yeah.

735
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
Yeah. Well, you gotta get the core stuff written in C

736
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
sharp, right? And then maybe orchestrate it later with

737
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
F sharp above. Could be. Could be.

738
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
This is a sign that someone had a lot of time on his hands.

739
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
Honestly, I love these little projects though,

740
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
because there's such a, especially

741
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
with like games, you know, you have

742
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
the technical, the pure technical side

743
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
of having to make the, you know, make the

744
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
runtime, implement everything, get it all working.

745
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
But hand in hand with that, it's almost

746
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
like archeology, you know, because

747
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
all these consoles did things differently, sort

748
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
of bespoke custom targets

749
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
and hardware and architecture choices.

750
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
So you also gotta go, you know,

751
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
figure out what they did,

752
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
work backwards, and then try to implement

753
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
something that acts the same way

754
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
so that the game actually works. Yeah, and

755
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
it's particularly video game emulators

756
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
because I didn't get

757
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
to dig into this one yet, but I'm definitely going

758
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
to just out of morbid curiosity.

759
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
There was a story we did a couple

760
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
years back about a Game Boy Color emulator, Wes.

761
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
And the guys working on the

762
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
emulator found the ridiculous

763
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
amount of hacks that the Nintendo

764
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
programmers had to do just to

765
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
get a Game Boy that ran in color.

766
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
Like, there is some

767
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
crazy stuff going on, particularly in this

768
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
you know, in that like

769
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
SNES PS1 kind

770
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
of generation of video game console.

771
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
Because remember, they were not working with

772
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
very robust systems. No,

773
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
not at all. You know, one of my favorite

774
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
blogs is the people behind

775
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
the Dolphin GameCube emulator.

776
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
Oh yeah, oh yeah. They do such

777
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
good work over there, and yeah, it's the same sort of stuff.

778
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
You find out the fascinating, crazy

779
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
details. Like, I believe the GameCube

780
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
didn't have like a floating point

781
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
stuff, so a lot of the math was done just as

782
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
integers, so that's like a

783
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
weird thing that they have to deal with and simulate

784
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
and make work all of the time. So don't

785
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
do your accounting on your GameCube

786
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
emulator. Yeah, maybe not, maybe not.

787
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
Yeah, one of my favorite stories, and

788
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
this is kind of tangential, but did you

789
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
know the Dreamcast was also a Windows

790
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
box? Really?

791
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
No, it did not. Yeah, I think it was a

792
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
Windows CE.

793
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
Oh, of course. But

794
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
it had two modes. It had like a Windows mode and a

795
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
non-Windows mode. As one might

796
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
expect, that did not go well for Sega.

797
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
Oh, what a time, yeah. But the people

798
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
writing the emulators have to now emulate both

799
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
environments, which is super

800
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
interesting. Of course.

801
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
Well, it looks like they've made a good

802
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
start here. Don't

803
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
go using this expecting to have a great time

804
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
playing games, but if you're interested

805
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
in learning C Sharp, or

806
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
you know, maybe trying your hand at writing

807
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
an emulator if you're already experienced in C

808
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
Sharp, well, go check it out.

809
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
If only there were one in Rust.

810
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
Ah, yes. Well, maybe we can

811
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
dream, or you can start working

812
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
on it, Mike. Yeah, I have all that free

813
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
time, yeah. I do have something to

814
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
placate you. It's not in Rust, so I

815
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
know, I know, I'm sorry, but

816
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
it is written in Go, and

817
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
it's a pick

818
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
from one of our feedback items earlier.

819
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
Yeah, that's right. Nuclear

820
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
Nick recommends FZF,

821
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
which is a fuzzy

822
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
finder, right, for your terminal. So

823
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
this goes hand in hand with what we talked about last time, which is

824
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
just improving your command line experience,

825
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
better ways to interact with the

826
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
system. So if you haven't heard of

827
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
FZF, well, go

828
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
check it out. It's a general purpose command line

829
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
fuzzy finder. You pull it up,

830
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
it has a nice little curses

831
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
style interface. You start typing, and

832
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
it goes out, it's indexed to your system,

833
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
and immediately brings you up options

834
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
of, oh yeah, well, that text

835
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
is found in this file, and it's got a nice little

836
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
interface too, where you can sort of move between

837
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
the files, and it's got a preview pane, so I think

838
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
it works especially well

839
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
for people listening to this show, who might have a lot

840
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
of text-based source files

841
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
laying around. Yeah, I'm going to have to start

842
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
using this. Yeah, I was going to say, do you use any tools

843
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
like this? Because I know you spend a decent amount of

844
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
time, you know, playing around in the terminal.

845
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
Yeah, I spend a lot of time in the terminal. I don't, I mean,

846
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
Fish shell

847
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
helps a little bit, but

848
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
this is definitely going to be a more robust solution, because

849
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
Fish shell can do some, you know, more advanced

850
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
find and search stuff. But

851
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
this is like taking that, and

852
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
oh, it's a Vim plugin? Yes!

853
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
Now I'm just getting excited.

854
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
Oh, don't you love that? You know, that

855
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
makes me think, not for today's show, but maybe sometime

856
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
soon we should talk a little more about editor

857
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
setups, and talk a bit

858
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
more about Vim plugins, and what you like to use.

859
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
And how I gave up on Emacs again.

860
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
And how you, okay, yeah, well, alright, we're just going to

861
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
have to slot that in. I think we've

862
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
packed this show with enough this time, so let's

863
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
get out of here, but please do join

864
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000

865
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
show live pretty much every

866
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
week. Now if you want to find out what time that is,

868
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
is the easiest way.

869
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
It's 12pm Pacific, but I don't know

870
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
what time that is for you. You're going to have to go
