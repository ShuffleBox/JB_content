00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,720
This is Coder Radio, episode 472 for June 27th, 2022.

2
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:19,840
Hello friends, welcome back to Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show, taking a pragmatic look

3
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:24,600
at the art and the business of software development and the world of technology.

4
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:30,280
My name is Chris and joining us from his base of operations, it's our host, Mr. Dominic.

5
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:31,280
Hello Mike.

6
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:35,240
Yes, unfortunately, my wings doth had been clipped.

7
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:38,560
I thought this was going to be like one of those crazy energy shows where you were like

8
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:40,200
remote from your mom's house.

9
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:41,320
I was supposed to be.

10
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:46,400
So I had a fabulous trip planned for my son, a six-year-old by the way, who if you paid

11
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:54,840
attention on Twitter, he has the most, if I say so myself, the most balling Pokemon card

12
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:55,840
binder.

13
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:56,840
Binder?

14
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:57,840
Do they still call him that?

15
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:58,840
Oh yeah.

16
00:00:58,840 --> 00:00:59,840
Yeah.

17
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:00,840
You got to organize them all in the binder for sure.

18
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:04,560
He's very, very annoyingly, let me tell you something.

19
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:10,240
This kid, a fighting type and a fire type, shath never be on the same page.

20
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:11,240
Oh man.

21
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:12,520
My kid got into this big time too.

22
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:13,560
He's still into it really.

23
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:15,000
It's damn fortunate though.

24
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Five bucks a pack.

25
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Oh yeah.

26
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,200
It's a Florida, cigarettes are free, abortions are illegal, but cigarettes are free.

27
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:24,160
You know, you just buy a pack of camels, it's cheaper.

28
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:25,160
But Pokemon.

29
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:26,160
Pokemon.

30
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:27,160
You got to pay for them all.

31
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:28,160
You got to pay, you got to pay for all.

32
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:30,640
And I thought there was 151 Pokemon.

33
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,560
I was corrected.

34
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,600
There are like 600 Pokemon now.

35
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:35,600
Oh yeah.

36
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,480
Well they keep having all these Pokemon derivatives.

37
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:38,600
They're like crypto.

38
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:42,800
So we bought the Pokemon sword and shield because obviously we want to both attack and

39
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:43,800
defend.

40
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:44,800
Yeah.

41
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,720
Like what happened to Pikachu?

42
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,840
And they're both, they're both like 50 bucks.

43
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:49,840
Sword and shield.

44
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,840
You got to buy two $50 games.

45
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,720
And then they just came out with some DLC that hit right before our road trip.

46
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:57,040
So of course my son comes to me.

47
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,040
He can hear you.

48
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:59,040
No, no.

49
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,040
Oh yeah.

50
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,040
You're right.

51
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,040
I probably shouldn't give him any tips.

52
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,680
I shouldn't give him any tips, but I got, I got hit up for the DLC right before the road

53
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:04,680
trip.

54
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:05,680
Go figure.

55
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:06,680
Oh, I'm about to get hit up for it.

56
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:11,440
I disabled the wifi on the Nintendo because old man Mike is, daddy Mike is buying the

57
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:16,720
SD cards cause I'm not around with any online stuff here.

58
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:22,480
I'm sure dear listeners, you can tell that your good friend Mike is in a mood because

59
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:25,280
I have spent a fortune this week.

60
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,720
Should I tell them how much I spent on the plane tickets or is that too much?

61
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:28,720
Oh yeah.

62
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:31,120
I'd be curious to know cause I know it's crazy right now.

63
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,120
$2,459.

64
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:36,840
Oh, you could, that's like a, that's like a decked out Mac book.

65
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:39,120
It's actually not, which is the worst part of that.

66
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,120
I suppose so.

67
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,120
Yeah.

68
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,640
So I told my kid like, this is his treat, you know, his birthday present, everything

69
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:45,880
rolled into one, my birthday present.

70
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:46,880
Nope.

71
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:47,880
Cancel that out.

72
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:54,040
Cause my boy presented with a cough and no fever for two days, man.

73
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,040
Right before the train.

74
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,800
Can I, can I have someone to filter here?

75
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,800
Yeah.

76
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,800
What do you got?

77
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,120
So I took them to two different doctors in two days.

78
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,760
Neither of them would treat the boy.

79
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:04,760
What do you mean?

80
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:05,760
They wouldn't treat him.

81
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:06,760
They wouldn't treat him.

82
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:07,760
I mean, they were nice.

83
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:08,760
They examined them.

84
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:09,760
They were kind, whatever.

85
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,760
They would not, uh, they threw up their hands.

86
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:13,840
You know what they said?

87
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:14,840
You know what they said?

88
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:18,480
They say, if he gets any worse, you can come back, but otherwise stay home if he gets,

89
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,760
but what else could it be?

90
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,960
What, what was their excuse for not treating him?

91
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,120
Oh, it's going to be COVID.

92
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,600
It's going to be, you know, it could be COVID man.

93
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:26,600
Yeah.

94
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,800
So this kid is crying.

95
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:28,800
This kid is upset.

96
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,400
This kid's not feeling well.

97
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,960
My whole life just took a detour, which is fine.

98
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:33,960
It's being a parent.

99
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:34,960
Yeah.

100
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:37,280
But this morning we get up.

101
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:40,080
Boy has a hundred, a hundred and something fever.

102
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:46,120
So me and my fiancee Mariah are, listen, it's, you know, it's like when an aircraft carrier

103
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:49,760
is getting bombed, everybody get off the ground, fly, fly, fly, right?

104
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:50,760
Everybody's moving.

105
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:51,760
Yeah.

106
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:52,760
We gotta, we gotta respond.

107
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:53,760
Everybody has a job to do here.

108
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:54,760
Let's go.

109
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:55,760
Figure this out.

110
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:56,760
Get him to the doctor.

111
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:57,760
Oh, I can't see him until a few hours.

112
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,280
I have never wanted to kill an old person more in my life.

113
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,280
Yeah.

114
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:05,040
I know like that parental instinct protect kicks in and you're like, you don't understand.

115
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:10,360
I mean, I, I know this is not woke, but super dad mode is like, I will destroy this building.

116
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,360
Yeah.

117
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,360
I'm not joking.

118
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:15,400
Give me my stapler back and give my kids some antibiotics.

119
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:22,280
So after several days of the same three doctors refusing to give my son antibiotics, guess

120
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:23,280
what they told me today?

121
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,280
Okay.

122
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:25,280
What?

123
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,280
Oh, well, yeah.

124
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:27,760
I guess he needs antibiotics.

125
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:28,760
Yeah.

126
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:29,760
Yeah.

127
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:30,760
Huh?

128
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:31,760
Funny.

129
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:33,400
But the boy, a six year old gets to suffer.

130
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:37,000
It's like using Linux, like, does he need to suffer?

131
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,520
But he, no, no, he doesn't.

132
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:40,440
It's like forcing someone to use Linux.

133
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:44,200
I mean, it's terrible, but don't you, don't you force him to use Linux though?

134
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,200
Don't you have him?

135
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:49,960
You actually, he, he, he, he requests Linux because only he doesn't know this and we'll

136
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:54,840
never tell him, but, uh, only on the Linux on the Thaleo it's Sonic mania.

137
00:04:54,840 --> 00:05:00,360
Let me tell you, my son is very, in fact, Chris, we just saw Sonic the Hedgehog two

138
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:04,680
at home streaming on a Peacock or Paramount or whatever.

139
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,040
That's a fun movie.

140
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,040
We loved it.

141
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:11,600
First of all, I have to say, I don't get why everybody says Knuckles talks weird.

142
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,560
Knuckles seems super reasonable to me.

143
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:16,260
That Knuckles is always how I pictured Knuckles in my head when I was playing the game.

144
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:17,260
It was great.

145
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:19,840
It was a great, a great time.

146
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,720
But yes, so I am not in New Jersey.

147
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:29,680
I am down South with my reptilian brethren and this is all somehow, somehow Wes's fault.

148
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,680
Yeah, of course.

149
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:34,280
Once I figure out how Clojure was involved, you won't, you won't believe what Wes did

150
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:35,280
to me.

151
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,280
Oh, tell me, tell me.

152
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:41,080
I, last week we prerecorded because I was taking the family on an annual trip to Bozeman,

153
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:42,080
Montana.

154
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,920
It's the best swimming around in Bozeman, Montana.

155
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:47,000
The kids just look forward to it all year round.

156
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,080
Like school gets out and they're immediately asking how many days until we go to Bozeman.

157
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:55,440
Few days before we left, I started to realize I was coming down with something.

158
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,900
I wasn't sure what it was.

159
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:01,680
But as time went on, I started to realize I was getting actually pretty sick.

160
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:05,880
And I got about as sick as I did the first time I got COVID before the vaccine was out.

161
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:06,880
Oh Jesus.

162
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:10,340
And this is my third time, my third time around with it.

163
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:11,340
You have COVID?

164
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:12,340
I'm pretty sure I had COVID.

165
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:13,340
Yeah.

166
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:15,840
I did not end up getting myself tested because I just stayed at home and isolated.

167
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:16,840
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

168
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:17,840
Oh my God.

169
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:18,840
They didn't want to see me.

170
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,520
So it was like, well, okay.

171
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:23,600
I don't, I don't really have like a standing doctor I go to anyways.

172
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:27,460
So when that kind of thing happens, I just go to lockdown now because this is potentially

173
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:30,200
my fourth time around with it, fully vaccinated.

174
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,200
And I still get it.

175
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:35,540
And it was this time, it was almost as rough as it was the very first time.

176
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:38,820
The last couple of times I think I potentially had it were pretty mild.

177
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:40,400
So you know my deal with COVID, right?

178
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:45,680
The first time I took a stroke and you remember because I was, I was, I was in bad shape for

179
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:46,680
a couple of days.

180
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:47,680
Yeah.

181
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:50,480
Like full on mentally disabled mode.

182
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:52,360
And the second time I just threw up a lot.

183
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,360
I don't know why.

184
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,560
I didn't know it could affect your stomach.

185
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,560
Yeah, it does.

186
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,560
It can.

187
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:00,280
I don't believe you now because trust me, I lost about 50 pounds.

188
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:02,280
I was just thrown up.

189
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:05,900
This time I got all the traditional symptoms people are getting.

190
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:08,720
I'm still slightly plugged up today.

191
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:14,480
My ears have cleared up a little bit, but I still, you know, I, I got myself good enough.

192
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:18,080
We went on the trip, but the first couple of days of the trip, which were drive days,

193
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,320
the first few days were just drive days.

194
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:20,320
Sure.

195
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,320
Sure.

196
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,320
I felt like hell.

197
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,320
How was the trip by the way?

198
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:24,320
Oh, it was great though.

199
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:25,320
The trip turned out great.

200
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,320
They really was a, it was a good trip.

201
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,640
You were, you were well enough.

202
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:32,280
This is, see, this is just Chris and Mike hanging out that the advertisers pay for now.

203
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:36,800
I feel, I don't mean to need to move off this, but I feel I should just say one thing.

204
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,600
It is abnormal to take a stroke from COVID.

205
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:43,960
That is because for new listeners, Mike has a born in heart problem.

206
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:45,200
Very bad.

207
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,200
Mike's been butchered.

208
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,200
You can listen to the old episodes.

209
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:52,680
A guy named Alex on Twitter is for some reason reviewing all the old episodes.

210
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,640
How great has that been though?

211
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:57,880
It's been pretty great because you know what he says, you know, cause he finds like these

212
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:01,880
old nuggets and it's like, I was so tempted to talk about it in the show cause I'm kind

213
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:02,880
of glad you brought it up.

214
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,360
I'm sort of dying to talk about it.

215
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,360
Yeah.

216
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,360
Okay.

217
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,360
All right.

218
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,360
Good.

219
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,360
So I mean, cause you know, we love it.

220
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,360
We love it when we nail it.

221
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:12,840
And it's so, so this, so Alex has been listening to the bad catalog and tweeting clips of like

222
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:13,840
past predictions.

223
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,400
What was, he got a good one.

224
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,400
You had a really good call.

225
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,220
There was a couple of mine too, but there was one that you made that was the weird one

226
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:20,480
that he missed was though.

227
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,480
What?

228
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,480
Docker.

229
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:27,480
And he might, but he's way, but he's like eight years back in that catalog right now.

230
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,480
He's yeah.

231
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:31,880
But Docker, the Docker thing was before your Apple arm transition call.

232
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,720
That might've been before I had kids.

233
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:34,720
The Docker one.

234
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:35,720
I don't know.

235
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:36,720
It's all, it's all blurry.

236
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:37,720
No, you just had a kid.

237
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:38,720
Okay.

238
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:39,720
Yeah.

239
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:40,720
Probably.

240
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:41,720
Yeah.

241
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:42,720
Oh, it's been a long time.

242
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:43,720
So, all right, let's get into the feedback.

243
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:47,840
Speaking of feedback, we did get sent into the show, but yeah, Alex and his, you know

244
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:50,840
what Alex, Oh man, if you're listening, but by the time he gets to this, it's going to

245
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:51,840
be years later.

246
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:52,840
Dude.

247
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:53,840
You know what?

248
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:59,400
I'm going to cause Alex DMS me sometimes because he's a, Alex is a Linux user by the way.

249
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:04,000
I just, and by the way, didn't nobody see my Twitter today of the beautiful package

250
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:09,320
that an angel named Gabriel, which is also the ups guys name at my head.

251
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,320
Yes.

252
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,320
What?

253
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,320
What?

254
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,320
What did you get?

255
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,320
I was too busy.

256
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,320
I was distracted by the dev one and the cat.

257
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,320
That was the package.

258
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,320
Not the cat.

259
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,320
Okay.

260
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,320
The cat is sort of a, a freeloader.

261
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,320
Yeah.

262
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,760
So I mean, it's the internet, so it's always safe to have a cat in the picture.

263
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:23,880
I've done the metrics.

264
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:28,200
It's, it's almost necessary to have the cat in the picture actually, but the dev one,

265
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:33,840
and let me tell you this step one, I can say with apologies to the HP crew, it does work

266
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:34,840
on USB charging.

267
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:35,840
Good.

268
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:39,080
So that was, it took about a week to get that turned around a week and a half.

269
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,080
So I wrote my review.

270
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:44,080
I don't know if you have a link in the show notes on a, on my blog, dominicm.com.

271
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,200
I can't, I literally don't know cause I'm.

272
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,200
We will.

273
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,200
Okay.

274
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:50,360
Chris did all the work because I was dealing with kids stuff.

275
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,360
Love you, Chris.

276
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,360
Loving you.

277
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:55,400
Well, I have two dev ones in the house now.

278
00:09:55,400 --> 00:10:01,160
One is the review one, but I don't like to put like confidential stuff on review units.

279
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:03,040
I feel that's not a good idea.

280
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,040
Yeah.

281
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:05,040
That one works fine.

282
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,920
What idiot puts Captain Planet Giffies in their blog?

283
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,400
Oh, that's my website.

284
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:12,720
Oh, this is already my favorite review you've ever done.

285
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,280
This is, this is already my favorite.

286
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:16,280
It was the Captain Planet Giffies in the pictures.

287
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:17,280
Yeah.

288
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:18,280
It's good overall, actually.

289
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:19,520
This is the high quality post.

290
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:22,240
I have a Gen Zer in my house now.

291
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:25,840
So my Giphy game is just, it's going up.

292
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:28,040
Prepare, prepare yourself.

293
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:29,040
I'm ready, dude.

294
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,040
Okay.

295
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:31,040
So I got mad.

296
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:34,800
I returned one because you know, Mike's unreasonable, whatever I write about in the post.

297
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,280
I was a bit of a jackass.

298
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:38,280
I bought another one.

299
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:44,520
It is quicker, amazingly to buy a def one than to get an exchange.

300
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:45,700
I don't doubt it.

301
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:49,000
Their supply chain game is, is like on point.

302
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,160
36 hours.

303
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,160
That's crazy.

304
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:57,400
I ordered, I ordered one and I think we put the order in like, yeah, it was maybe 36 hours

305
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,400
later.

306
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,400
It was here at our doorstep.

307
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:01,200
It was really impressive.

308
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,200
Supply chain?

309
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,200
What supply chain issues?

310
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,600
So wait, wait, you ordered one?

311
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,600
I ordered one.

312
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,080
I'm not going to use it personally.

313
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:14,040
I ordered one for Brent because he's had machine troubles for years and it's been kind of affecting

314
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,120
production.

315
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:18,480
So he's going to do an extended review for Linux Unplugged, ship him one.

316
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:24,880
He is, if you ever, if you ever need a guy to do like a few hours of QA, you should hire

317
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:25,880
him.

318
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:30,480
He is like, I'm seriously considering giving him the title of chief QA officer at JB because

319
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:33,240
if anyone will find a problem, it's him.

320
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:36,720
I'm legit going to hire Brent when I know Brent from our Slack.

321
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:40,020
And two, I drink a lot and I write a lot of code and that's not a-

322
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:41,020
There you go.

323
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:42,020
He'll find a bug.

324
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:44,080
Some of those UFOs are literally my fault.

325
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:47,440
They're just drones going wacky.

326
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,360
So anyway, my father's computer woes.

327
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:54,160
I can't remember the listener's name, but he sent in a, I'm sorry, I should've grabbed

328
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:57,000
the name, a ThinkPad, which we'll have linked in the show notes.

329
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,680
I don't love this machine that was linked.

330
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:00,760
It's like a $380 ThinkPad.

331
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:02,160
My father hates it more.

332
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,160
Keep going.

333
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:04,260
Oh really?

334
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:05,600
You know what he hates?

335
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,600
What?

336
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:09,780
Why would anybody want a laptop that looks like a spoiled clam?

337
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:12,760
So laptops, just not going to happen.

338
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:13,760
Really?

339
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:16,000
Like a used MacBook or something.

340
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Are you fucking kidding me?

341
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
An Apple?

342
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Oh really?

343
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Oh, okay.

344
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
What about like a Limor?

345
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,280
You know, I think they're about to update the Limor.

346
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:26,920
He wants to know if IBM still makes computers.

347
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:28,400
He's 79 years old, dude.

348
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:30,800
I think I want to have a long conversation with your dad.

349
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:31,800
You would love my dad.

350
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:34,800
Actually, you being my dad at a bar, we'd all get along very well.

351
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:38,320
I'm thinking I'd also probably figure out a lot about you by talking to your dad.

352
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:41,080
I'm starting to see, I'm starting to hear some similarities here.

353
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:46,720
I mean, I have, okay, so I appreciate the feedback.

354
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,360
The man wants a tower.

355
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:55,680
He wants the tower to be a tan, just a straight tower, no lights, quote, no bullshit.

356
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:59,080
What happened to the CD-ROM drive and where's my floppy disk drive?

357
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:02,840
You know, I mean, in terms of like backing up your config files, a floppy disk could

358
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:03,840
be useful.

359
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:06,720
We're making fun a little bit, but he used to have, not the floppy disk, what's the

360
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:07,720
bigger one?

361
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:08,720
The super disk, the skin?

362
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:09,720
The zip drive?

363
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:10,720
Zip drive.

364
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:11,720
Yeah, those are great.

365
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:14,120
That shit holds a lot of, and he's an accountant, right?

366
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,120
So it's just texts.

367
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,600
I mean, it's effectively text files.

368
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:20,920
Well, I mean, after you format them, it's like 97 megabytes, but yeah.

369
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:30,080
Well, you know, so I'm going to be making a call to Canada for Linus Tech Tips to build

370
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:33,300
the most powerful computer the 80s could never have built.

371
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:35,240
That would actually be a fun project.

372
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:38,480
But it's going to look like it's from 1986.

373
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,040
That's where we're going here.

374
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:42,000
Man, that would be a fun project.

375
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
We should do that.

376
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,480
Like, yeah, if we had a video.

377
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,480
We should just do it.

378
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:46,480
F**k them.

379
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:47,480
We should just do it.

380
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:48,480
Who needs the Canadians?

381
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,480
Who needs the Canadians?

382
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:53,160
Also, Canadians, never install Steam on Linux.

383
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:54,160
Never install Steam.

384
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,240
You know Steam is going to blow up your whole thing.

385
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,240
It's not for Canadians.

386
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:58,280
It's for Americans only.

387
00:13:58,280 --> 00:13:59,280
Everybody knows that.

388
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:03,560
So Jacob wants your idea on ways for non-Apple developers to collect feedback.

389
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:06,720
He says, you know, getting the right amount of feedback is not easy.

390
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:10,580
Apple kind of holds your hand in this process and creates a solution.

391
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:11,580
Some background here.

392
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:15,260
He says with WWDC behind us, we're now in beta for the new Apple software.

393
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:19,720
Their feedback app really lowers the bar for non-technical folks to report issues.

394
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:24,760
In contrast, I have no idea how I'd ever report an issue with a Windows app or maybe something

395
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:25,760
in the Linux community.

396
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:26,760
It seems all over the map.

397
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:31,400
It seems like feedback is a crucial part of ensuring software delivers the intended value.

398
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:34,920
What are some good techniques to ensure that the barriers to feedback are set at appropriate

399
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:35,920
levels?

400
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:39,960
In other words, how do you get great feedback from your users?

401
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:41,160
Have you thought about this much?

402
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,160
Because this is...

403
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:44,980
I suffer with this, yes.

404
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:46,220
This is a problem.

405
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:47,920
If you figure it out, please let me know.

406
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:48,920
Right.

407
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:55,400
I, okay, I had a conversation about three months ago.

408
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:59,760
Brilliant woman, smart lady on the phone, but she's one of the employees at one of my

409
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,700
customer shops.

410
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:08,080
And she said, Mike, this goddamn website is broken.

411
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,460
Okay.

412
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:10,460
Not a problem.

413
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:11,460
We're here for you.

414
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:18,080
If you pay us, right, like, no, you know, the normal customer service stuff.

415
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:22,600
And then she says, yes, it's broken on my, and then she answers random Android phone

416
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:23,600
here.

417
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:24,600
Mm-hmm.

418
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:25,600
Why is it broken?

419
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,600
I can't log in.

420
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:30,360
You're not, you're not supposed to be.

421
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:34,600
So it's a real specific case, but this is, I think, an illustrative example.

422
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,840
We user agent limit the login.

423
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:41,480
So yes, of course you can spoof it, but we don't allow mobile devices because they want

424
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:44,940
people would do a buy IP address.

425
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:49,800
It's basically an administration website for their company on their physical soil.

426
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:50,800
Sure.

427
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:54,860
And so they don't want just random IPs on a carrier network.

428
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:58,040
So the way we've done it is we block all carrier IPs.

429
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:02,440
We block anything that is not a desktop or a laptop computer, right?

430
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:05,160
Like Chrome, regular Chrome.

431
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:08,840
And yeah, that's, I mean, but this was a serious bug.

432
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:11,200
Like people were mad.

433
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:14,160
It was a hell of a thing.

434
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:17,640
I don't know how you do, could do, and to get the feedback, the way I got the feedback

435
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:18,800
is I called her, right?

436
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:21,800
I just straight up got on the phone.

437
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:22,800
Yeah.

438
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:26,800
You know, we did have a blog article we read weeks ago that just talked about sometimes

439
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:31,460
the best way is just to contact your users directly, but you got to collect that information

440
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:32,460
too.

441
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:37,800
I mean, I would suggest if, if you can make people sign up for an account and then save

442
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:42,920
that information, you can maybe do like an email form, but it's tough, man.

443
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:47,240
It's when I used to have code journal, the feedback I got was like nasty shit on the

444
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:48,240
app store.

445
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,240
You know what I mean?

446
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:54,400
Like some edge case that I had never tested or whatever, which I know is not the answer

447
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:56,880
you're looking for, but it's a problem.

448
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:00,960
I would like others ideas and input coder.show slash contact or boost in your thoughts.

449
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:01,960
All right.

450
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:07,120
So Peter writes in and who wants our take on a topic that I think when you, when you

451
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:15,600
reflect on how our kids respond to things like Robux and Pokemon and DLC downloads,

452
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:22,080
it's not that crazy to consider that people will be willing to spend money on fashion

453
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:23,080
in the metaverse.

454
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:25,240
And so Peter wanted to know what we thought about this.

455
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:29,160
Meta is launching an avatar store with designer clothes.

456
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:36,640
So like clothing designers are working with meta to create fashion that you can purchase

457
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,840
in the metaverse.

458
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:42,000
And I don't know if this is the implementation, but I think this is actually going to be a

459
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,720
thing in a big way.

460
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:51,140
In fact, I would think by the time that my kids are my age, the virtual economy is probably

461
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:53,880
going to be larger than the physical economy.

462
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:55,940
You've described hell, but keep going.

463
00:17:55,940 --> 00:18:02,460
And I think the reason for that is just there's so many efficiencies and incentives for these

464
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:06,620
companies to get in the business of selling us virtual goods.

465
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:08,360
It is such a boondoggle for them.

466
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:10,080
It is such an opportunity.

467
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:14,640
And there's also just the great ESG aspect of it.

468
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:20,560
You know, if they're selling you virtual clothes, then that's a benefit to the environment because

469
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:24,680
they're using less resources, less natural resources, less farming.

470
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:26,680
No, no, no.

471
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:27,840
It's better for the environment.

472
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,240
It's virtual.

473
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:32,280
It's good for struggling economies when the West is really struggling right now.

474
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:35,240
We need new markets and it's not manufacturing, right?

475
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:36,600
It's not building things.

476
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:38,720
Or we could like decide that we don't want to lose.

477
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:39,720
But that's a different conversation.

478
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:40,720
Right.

479
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:41,720
Yeah.

480
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:42,720
Yeah.

481
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:43,720
Well, let's just assume that's not happening.

482
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:44,720
Let's just assume we're going into a future where.

483
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:45,720
Let's assume failure.

484
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:46,720
Great.

485
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:47,720
Yeah.

486
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:48,720
We're kind of into a failed.

487
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:49,720
Yeah.

488
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:54,000
I mean, the economy was super strong and people were great and we, you know, we had huge manufacturing.

489
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,480
I still think there would be this huge push to sell virtual goods.

490
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:01,040
I think it's just too great of an opportunity and everybody's going to get on board and

491
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:02,160
they're going to get people hyped.

492
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,160
I hate it.

493
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:05,660
There's only one virtual good you should buy.

494
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:09,320
And that's a quarter radio rope in the metaverse.

495
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:14,140
We should be like the the cultists of Cthulhu with our black rope.

496
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:19,120
So I completely reject this because it lacks the one.

497
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:24,400
Frankly, I would say uniform clothing option that is necessary for any reasonable life.

498
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,400
The rope.

499
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,400
Of course.

500
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,400
Well, here's why.

501
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,000
I'll play devil's advocate.

502
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:35,240
If there was a world in where you had a singular avatar that represented you across all services,

503
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:37,000
all social media platforms.

504
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
He'd be wearing a rope.

505
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Yes.

506
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Yes, he would.

507
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Yes.

508
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Sure.

509
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,920
But if there was that one avatar and you could modify it and you bought yourself an outfit

510
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:50,520
and it worked across all platforms, I could almost see an argument because that's like

511
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:52,940
a virtual representation of yourself.

512
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:56,960
But what we're going to get and we all know this is the case, what we're going to get

513
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:01,640
is like a dozen of these services with all of them selling their own avatar clothing.

514
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:04,240
You mean Apple's not going to integrate with Facebook?

515
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,240
Shocking.

516
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:06,240
Right.

517
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,240
Exactly.

518
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:10,240
And Google and they're and they're all going to have once once VR meetings become the new

519
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,240
hotness.

520
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:13,120
You know, you and I really want that to happen.

521
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:17,160
I feel like I think we're going to be crying in a couple of years.

522
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:18,160
I think.

523
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,160
Yeah, they're going to screw it up.

524
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:20,160
It's not going to work.

525
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:24,040
Because how does Jupiter Broadcasting and the Mad Botter have a VR meeting?

526
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:28,560
If I'm not saying this is true, but if Jupiter Broadcasting is on, let's say, Microsoft Teams

527
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,800
and the Mad Botter is on Google Work, how do we have a meeting?

528
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:31,800
Right.

529
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:32,800
Well, you already have that problem today.

530
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:34,440
It's like, OK, well, so let's set up a call.

531
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:35,440
Great.

532
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,440
How do you want to connect?

533
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:37,440
Do you want to use Zoom, Google Hangouts?

534
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:38,440
You want to use JetSea?

535
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:39,440
Do you want to use a phone call?

536
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:40,440
Like, what do you want to do?

537
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:41,440
Oh, FaceTime?

538
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:42,440
OK.

539
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:43,440
All right.

540
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:44,440
All right.

541
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:45,600
You know, it gets just all these crazy services right now.

542
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:46,600
None of them work together.

543
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:49,480
So, yeah, of course it's going to be like that.

544
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:52,400
You know, I got an email that asked me, like, hey, we kind of stopped talking about the

545
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:55,240
virtual office and it's because of this stuff.

546
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:58,120
Because we thought about it, talked about it and got really depressed.

547
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:03,480
Like, there is, if it could just be something that was truly decentralized, that was an

548
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:11,320
open protocol, that it was like the web, you know, like TCBIP and HTTP, yeah, OK, it could

549
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:12,320
work out.

550
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:16,360
But I think you and I being in a virtual room together, a virtual studio, it would be awesome

551
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:19,720
to actually make it a virtual studio so it felt like we were doing this together, being

552
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:22,100
able to see each other, use hand movements.

553
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:24,260
I actually think there would be a benefit in production there.

554
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:25,260
But you're right.

555
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:26,260
I don't.

556
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:27,260
It's always going to be this.

557
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:28,260
I don't.

558
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:29,260
Because you're from the Northwest and I'm from New Jersey and you will think that I'm

559
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:31,880
assaulting everything in the room as I talk.

560
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:36,620
You will think that I've gone full, you know, I've gone full Keanu Reeves and John Wick.

561
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:37,620
They killed my dog.

562
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:38,620
And you know what?

563
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:39,620
**** these guys.

564
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:40,620
I'm going for it.

565
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:41,620
Yeah, you might be right.

566
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:45,920
That's what our three New Jersey listeners were like, I get that joke.

567
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:47,520
So yeah, we're not happy about it.

568
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:50,800
You know what it is, man, is I'm struggling not to just have like a super negative take

569
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:54,360
on it because that's I'm more than happy to do it for you.

570
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:59,560
Yeah, it just feels cliche, like, you know, it's I don't want to be new technology bad,

571
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:00,560
right?

572
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:01,560
Because that's so easy.

573
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:02,560
It's so common.

574
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:03,560
New technology bad.

575
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:04,800
But it's not new technology.

576
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,480
It's not new technology, right?

577
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:07,480
It's old.

578
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:09,880
It's a number of older technologies packaged up.

579
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:11,720
See, this is the problem.

580
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:15,720
And I'm going to quote what is it and and recent Horowitz or what the guy's name is?

581
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:16,720
I don't remember.

582
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:21,280
But they promised us flying cars and they gave us Twitter.

583
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:23,800
We haven't had any real new technology in a long time.

584
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:28,560
And don't even lay that blockchain crap on me because I I'm very sorry for all of your

585
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:32,480
college funds, by the way, that seems to have gone the wrong way.

586
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:35,280
You know, he's a big blockchain guy, that Horowitz.

587
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:36,280
He's a big.

588
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:38,440
Oh, but he you know, but he's a big everything guy.

589
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:42,760
If I said blueberry pie, the man probably owns like three bakeries, right?

590
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:43,880
I just may be.

591
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:45,120
You might be right.

592
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:47,700
Just a quick aside about the crypto thing.

593
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:53,280
If this crash means that we lose some of these ridiculous coins out there and some of these

594
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:55,400
scams, that's a correction.

595
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:56,400
It is.

596
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,400
It is a correction.

597
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:00,720
And the fact that some people in that space are stepping in and bailing out some of these

598
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:03,400
projects and some of these companies, it's a damn shame.

599
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,400
Super bad.

600
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,400
Let them burn.

601
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:06,400
We need a forest fire.

602
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:12,680
Yeah, it 2021 and 2020, we're just it got out of control.

603
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:16,720
And it's it's a beast beyond any regulatory body's ability to manage.

604
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:20,360
Do you know what the biggest crypto coin is, though, right?

605
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:21,360
Stable coins.

606
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:22,680
The biggest digital dollar?

607
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:23,680
No, there's one.

608
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:24,680
What?

609
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:25,880
USD, baby.

610
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:27,680
Most dollars are not physical.

611
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:28,680
They're not paper.

612
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:29,680
Right.

613
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:31,960
It's it's this is a losing fight.

614
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:37,960
I love Bitcoin because we all want to purchase Ayahuasca on the Internet and not be tracked.

615
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:42,240
Yeah, I actually still I still am fairly confident long term in Bitcoin.

616
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:44,160
But the rest, I think I'll need to die.

617
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:45,880
I like the underlying technology.

618
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:50,720
I think the idea that the government would ever allow and I mean our government would

619
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:56,400
ever allow you to have a transaction that they can't trace is right.

620
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:59,520
Well, let's make no mistake, though.

621
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,040
Every transaction on Bitcoin is public.

622
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:02,040
It is horrible.

623
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:07,040
And also, didn't the FBI like seize a bunch from that?

624
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:08,040
Yeah.

625
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:09,040
They just took it.

626
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:10,040
Right.

627
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:11,040
This is.

628
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:12,040
Yeah.

629
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:13,040
Yeah.

630
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:14,040
They're like one of the biggest holders of Bitcoin at this point, because of all the

631
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:15,040
Bitcoin they seized.

632
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:20,480
So that's supposedly they're going to sell it with apologies to Attorney General Garland.

633
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,480
Sell your coin, my friend.

634
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:22,920
I don't know what to say.

635
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:26,760
I say this dip is a great opportunity to buy some stats and boost the show.

636
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:28,520
And we'll see how things play out long term.

637
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:29,520
That's my robes.

638
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:31,720
My robe coin, you know what?

639
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:32,720
Robe NFT, man.

640
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:33,720
No, I didn't.

641
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:36,200
I actually was thinking about it.

642
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:38,640
This show is just off the rails.

643
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,080
We sell robes.

644
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,080
We did.

645
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:42,080
No, we should.

646
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:43,080
We are.

647
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:44,080
We're doing it again.

648
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:45,080
We did.

649
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:46,080
Yeah.

650
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,080
We got to get back.

651
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:48,080
I agree.

652
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:49,080
We got to get every day at two in the morning.

653
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:50,080
I'm going to call you and we're going to until you just do it.

654
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:56,320
We also need to sell cocktail glasses and Coderadio branded headphones that the Bluetooth

655
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,800
does not suck on Linux.

656
00:24:58,800 --> 00:24:59,800
That's the full set.

657
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:00,800
No.

658
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:01,800
No pants, though.

659
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:02,800
Are you thinking wireless headphones?

660
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:04,800
I'm thinking wireless, my man.

661
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:05,800
Hmm.

662
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:06,800
So you're coding.

663
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:08,000
You're loaded.

664
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,360
You're listening to Coderadio.

665
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:14,220
You're correctly angry at Swift.

666
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:18,720
And you love Objective-C. I think I know who the customer for this might be.

667
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:19,720
Craig Federighi.

668
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:20,720
Hang on.

669
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:23,520
I got to unbutton one more button.

670
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:24,520
Make sure.

671
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:25,520
All right.

672
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:26,520
I'm down to.

673
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:27,520
There you go.

674
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:28,520
All right.

675
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:29,520
I'll take that hair.

676
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:30,520
All right.

677
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:31,520
You know what?

678
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:32,520
Craig Federighi's hair, I don't even want to try.

679
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:36,160
He's, you and Craig, actually, you're the one who could step up to Craig Federighi.

680
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:37,160
I'll take him on.

681
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:40,120
I mean, you know, because he's got a, you know, he's got a crew doing that swoop before

682
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:41,120
he goes out there.

683
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,120
Right.

684
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:43,120
And this is all natural, baby.

685
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:44,120
There ain't no crew here doing this.

686
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:45,120
He's got like eight hairdressers.

687
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:46,120
Right.

688
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:47,120
Right.

689
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:48,120
This is one man.

690
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:49,440
And this is one man not trying very hard.

691
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:52,480
So if I tried hard and got a crew, I think I could out hair him.

692
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:54,480
You know where we're selling all of this?

693
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:55,960
In our sponsor Metaverse.

694
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:57,520
Hey, that's right.

695
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:58,520
Metaverse.

696
00:25:58,520 --> 00:25:59,560
Go to the Metaverse.

697
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:01,040
Get yourself an avatar.

698
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:03,800
Actually, instead of the Metaverse, go to our Matrix chat.

699
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:07,960
I have set up a space for meetups.

700
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:09,240
We have a London meetup coming up.

701
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:10,920
So there's a dedicated London chat room.

702
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:12,880
I have a Pacific Northwest chat room.

703
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:15,400
And I have a virtual like mumble chat room meetups.

704
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:18,080
I just want to pass this along as we do future meetups.

705
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:21,000
There will be one in September as well on the West Coast.

706
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:25,120
We'll have discussions in our Matrix chat room.

707
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:26,920
And you know, just want to get the word out there.

708
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:28,560
How do I get in there and troll people?

709
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:29,560
Good question.

710
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:33,200
So go create an account at matrix.org if you don't have a Matrix account already.

711
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:38,080
And then our server is just jupiterbroadcasting.com, so you'll search it up and I'll put a link

712
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:39,080
in the show notes.

713
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:40,080
So once you have an account, you click it.

714
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:41,080
It'll take you right to our system.

715
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:42,080
It is slick.

716
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:47,480
You just first have to get an account and we have closed accounts on JB, although if

717
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:49,860
you wanted to wait a little bit, we could probably get you one.

718
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:53,960
But we have account creation closed on the JB server for the time being just to kind

719
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:55,720
of keep things under control.

720
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:58,120
I mean, can I send them pictures of snow leopards?

721
00:26:58,120 --> 00:26:59,120
Yeah, definitely.

722
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:00,120
Yeah, definitely.

723
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:01,120
It supports markdown, too.

724
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:03,440
So you could even have bullet points about snow leopard.

725
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:07,880
OK, well, that's really all I care about.

726
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:09,560
Linode.com slash coder.

727
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:13,400
Go there to get one hundred dollars in 60 day credit on a new account and you go there

728
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:14,760
to support the show.

729
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:18,440
You guys know the Linodes where we've built everything for the last two and a half going

730
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:22,160
on two point seven years.

731
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:23,160
I love it.

732
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:27,480
I mean, I just don't see myself building anywhere else because Linode strikes the balance right

733
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:34,320
with performance, with price, with support and honestly for us, flexibility.

734
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:37,840
Sometimes I just want to do a one click deployment with like an Ubuntu box and Docker or Debian

735
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:41,760
and Docker and sometimes I want to build it up from scratch and they let me do that full

736
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:42,760
range.

737
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:48,440
When I needed to do some crazy custom Linux distro for a VPN setup I had, it was no problem.

738
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:52,440
You know, Linode's been rolling out upgrades the entire time I've been a customer, too,

739
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:55,760
which is pretty damn impressive when you consider they're nearly 19 years old, but yet they're

740
00:27:55,760 --> 00:28:00,240
still investing, they're still improving, they're staying competitive.

741
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:03,320
While they're 30 to 50 percent cheaper than those hyperscalers that want to lock into

742
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:06,920
their crazy platforms, MVME was a game changer for us.

743
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:10,800
But I think the biggest thing for us is going to be this managed database service they offer

744
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:11,800
now.

745
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:15,760
Started back in May with MySQL, but now they've expanded it to Postgres and Mongo.

746
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:20,320
And this week, and I'll have a link in the show notes, they released a guide to migrate

747
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:25,000
your Postgres existing database to the managed database system.

748
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,000
This to me is a no-brainer.

749
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:30,360
I mean, JB has been and can run and manage our own databases.

750
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:31,360
We absolutely have.

751
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:34,440
Probably one of our most active databases now is our matrix server database.

752
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:36,540
Pretty crazy.

753
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:39,320
But why not defer to Linode's expertise?

754
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:42,800
Their infrastructure, their people that know how to run this kind of stuff.

755
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:46,040
And I can also reorganize some of our Linodes as a result of this, too.

756
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:49,040
So there's going to be optimizations in that regard.

757
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:52,840
So it's just a great opportunity if you need a MySQL, Mongo, or Postgres database and you

758
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:56,920
want somebody that's a real expert to just take care of that back end for you so your

759
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:57,920
database just works.

760
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:58,920
It's database as a service.

761
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:00,880
It's here and it's at Linode.

762
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:03,380
So get started by going to linode.com slash coder.

763
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:05,120
Get that hundred bucks.

764
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:06,560
Try out the database as a service.

765
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:09,640
Try out deploying a super fast rig or a value rig.

766
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:12,580
I mean, with a hundred dollars, you can really kick the tires and try it.

767
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:14,040
That's confidence on Linode's part.

768
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:15,360
They know you're going to like it.

769
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:18,320
And it's just a great way to learn something and support the show.

770
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:23,560
linode.com slash coder.

771
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:29,260
So GitHub Copilot has launched and it is 10 bucks a month.

772
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:32,920
And I'm flying with my drunken robotic friend.

773
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:33,940
You signed up.

774
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:35,480
You actually signed up.

775
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:36,980
I paid for a year.

776
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:40,360
And this is the dumbest pair programming partner I've ever had.

777
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:41,360
You went right in.

778
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:46,400
How did you go from this is horrible and going to get me in legal trouble to here's a year

779
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:48,520
of subscription.

780
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:51,320
How did you make that jump?

781
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:57,240
My stepdaughter is a Gen Z. She's 14 and she introduced me to the phrase YOLO.

782
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:58,600
And you know what?

783
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:05,720
If there's anything that our friend Alex listening to all the CoderRadios might learn, I seem

784
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:07,720
to without saying it be very YOLO.

785
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:08,720
And you know what?

786
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,720
I wanted to see how good this Codepilot is.

787
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:12,120
Let me tell you something.

788
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:13,120
It's pretty fucking bad.

789
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:14,120
Really?

790
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:16,840
Is it pretty, but is it like dumb?

791
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:17,840
Just like bad code?

792
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:20,440
It's like the drunkest junior developer I've ever met.

793
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:21,560
And let me tell you something.

794
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:27,400
Having been a very drunk junior developer myself in the past, I don't understand what

795
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:28,400
I paid for.

796
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:32,680
Well, they describe it as a coworker who might need a little review.

797
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:35,960
That's what you paid for, according to Microsoft.

798
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:39,360
So you're saying it's not actually like a coworker.

799
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:41,840
I'm saying don't, don't do it.

800
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:44,440
The other problem I would have with it is not only is it not going to give you very

801
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:49,560
good suggestions, but couldn't it be putting you into some kind of potential legal ambiguity?

802
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:54,240
No, because the only thing I'm using it for is a video game I'm running for my son.

803
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,600
Well, I can't say video game.

804
00:30:55,600 --> 00:31:01,800
It's a Minecraft mod because my son has very sadly picked up the Pokemon problem, but he

805
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:03,720
wasn't happy with just regular drugs.

806
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:05,920
He had to go to f***ing Fentanyl.

807
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:08,360
And when I say Fentanyl, I mean Minecraft.

808
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:11,340
Yeah, boy, that is, that is the good stuff.

809
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:13,400
And now he wants to code some mods.

810
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:14,400
Yep.

811
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:15,400
That's always the direction it goes.

812
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:16,400
Been there.

813
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:17,400
Been there.

814
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:19,120
Have fun in the dot Minecraft directory.

815
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:20,920
You'll be in there for years.

816
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:21,920
I'm super curious.

817
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:24,840
How do I get a Minecraft mod on the Xbox S?

818
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:25,840
Is that even possible?

819
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:26,840
Oh, no.

820
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:27,840
No, you got to buy.

821
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:28,840
That's bedrock edition.

822
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:30,440
And you can only, you can just buy those mods.

823
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:32,440
You don't get to actually do those mods.

824
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:33,760
Only the Java edition.

825
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:34,760
Can you actually.

826
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:35,760
So I have to buy another.

827
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:40,840
Well, I used to have a license, although God knows where it is to the Java Linux edition

828
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:41,880
on my old.

829
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:42,880
But we're going back.

830
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:46,880
I mean, this is like Coder Radio episode six, right?

831
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:50,360
We're going way back when I played around Minecraft.

832
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:54,080
You might as a Xbox, if you bought it on the Xbox, you might get access to both if you

833
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:56,620
log into the Xbox account on the on the web.

834
00:31:56,620 --> 00:32:01,360
So if anybody is looking for some intern work doing some Java and Kotlin development.

835
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:06,040
So you know, before we get off Copilot completely, I thought this was a poignant tweet.

836
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:10,140
Senior oops engineer on Twitter wrote GitHub Copilot is incredible.

837
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:12,680
It just sells code other people wrote.

838
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:17,280
But because it's an A.I., it apparently is allowed to launder that code without being

839
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:19,500
a, quote, derivative work.

840
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:22,320
What an amazing grift.

841
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:27,760
And your your buddy, Drew DeVault, not Drew, our editor, but Drew DeVault said that free

842
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:32,320
software licenses impose obligations on the user in terms of governing attribution, sub

843
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:37,680
licensing, distribution, patents, trademarks, relationships and with relationships like

844
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:42,180
the Digital Millennium Copyright Act and GitHub's Copilot is trained on software governed by

845
00:32:42,180 --> 00:32:47,640
these terms, he writes, and it fails to uphold them and enables customers to accidentally

846
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:50,200
fail to uphold these terms themselves.

847
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:54,980
Essentially, the argument comes down to whether or not the model constitutes derivative works

848
00:32:54,980 --> 00:32:56,840
of its inputs.

849
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:58,760
Microsoft argues it does not.

850
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:06,360
However, these licenses are not specific regarding the means of derivation or derivation.

851
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:09,360
So essentially the licenses don't say this is a derivative or this is not.

852
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:11,040
They just say any derivative.

853
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:13,920
And so Microsoft is attempting to kind of walk that line.

854
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:19,120
But Drew argues that it's kind of clear since these licenses are not specific and essentially

855
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:20,560
are meaning any kind of derivative.

856
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:21,560
Any terrified work.

857
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:22,560
Right.

858
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:23,560
There you go.

859
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:24,560
Is that a word?

860
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:25,560
I don't know.

861
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:26,560
Derived.

862
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:27,560
Yeah.

863
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:28,560
Derived.

864
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:29,560
Derived.

865
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:30,560
Derived.

866
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:31,560
There you go.

867
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:32,560
Derived is it.

868
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:33,560
Yeah, I said it wrong.

869
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:34,560
It just doesn't work.

870
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:35,560
So who cares?

871
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:38,320
It seems like today's problem.

872
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:42,080
Like if anything, isn't the problem actually once this thing works, which probably isn't

873
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:43,080
inevitable.

874
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:45,560
I mean, I've been spending, what, 10 years now.

875
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:47,520
Oh, hey, happy anniversary, my love.

876
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:49,920
It was in June when we started.

877
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:50,920
Wow.

878
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:52,280
We just blew right past that.

879
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:53,280
How about that?

880
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:54,280
We missed it.

881
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:58,840
But, you know, I've been bitching and people have been yelling at me that I say open source

882
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:03,940
needs to be paid for and it shouldn't be free as in beer, it should be if you believe in

883
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:07,920
free as in freedom, you got to get that, got to get the couple of shekels, you got to get

884
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,720
some money.

885
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:13,320
But when you don't do that, this is what happens and I don't know.

886
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:14,320
I don't know.

887
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:16,960
To me, it's like knocking the milk carton off the table and crying that there's milk

888
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:17,960
on the floor.

889
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:19,680
So why did you pay for a year of it?

890
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:22,800
I was DMing with Linux users.

891
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:23,800
I was, I don't know.

892
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:26,920
I mean, I actually am kind of glad you did because, you know, we get some real hands

893
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:27,920
on.

894
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:29,180
No, no one's glad I did.

895
00:34:29,180 --> 00:34:30,180
Let me tell you something.

896
00:34:30,180 --> 00:34:31,180
All right.

897
00:34:31,180 --> 00:34:34,040
I'm going to tell you about the game I'm writing for Minecraft.

898
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:35,040
We're doing two things.

899
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:37,800
We're doing a game in Unity, which I hate Unity.

900
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:41,400
So we're probably just going to do it in monogame, which is for folks who don't know X name.

901
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:45,240
I'm basically trying to teach my son programming, right?

902
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:51,680
So that's all C sharp, but it doesn't even match the style of your code correctly.

903
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:53,600
It's really sloppy.

904
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:56,800
Like it's, I thought it would help him.

905
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:59,800
I put it on the laptop that he and I work on together.

906
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:06,400
I honestly thought it would be something for, you know, he's six, right?

907
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:08,880
So if he's struggling, I don't want him to feel bad.

908
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:10,260
I know it's hard.

909
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:13,900
C sharp is a gigantic language, frankly.

910
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:16,320
It's not a good language like objective C.

911
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:17,320
I do now.

912
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:18,320
I mean, I have been for weeks.

913
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:19,320
Are you kidding?

914
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:20,920
I mean, you've trained me now.

915
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:25,080
Well, but it's, there's like a lot of stuff, like for instance, string.

916
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:28,000
How many ways are there to concatenate a string?

917
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,760
And objective C zero, because you shouldn't be doing it.

918
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:31,760
Sorry.

919
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:32,760
There's actually a number of ways.

920
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:33,760
I'm being a dick.

921
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:34,760
I don't know.

922
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:36,920
I thought copilot could help the kid out.

923
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:39,160
And all we're doing is we have something working.

924
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:43,280
It's the little dude jumps from platform to platform.

925
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:46,880
It's very more ghetto Mario S you know, it's good.

926
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:52,640
And then we tried a Minecraft Moz, which I now understand why that doesn't work.

927
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:57,960
The problem is the kid is very eager to hit tab and just like let it auto complete nonsense.

928
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:59,200
Yeah, I would be too.

929
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:02,600
We accidentally got a barometer in the game somehow.

930
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:03,600
Yeah.

931
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:04,600
Oh man.

932
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:05,600
Yeah.

933
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:06,600
Okay.

934
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:11,520
Well, I mean, I'd be curious if you checked back in with it in like six months to see

935
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:12,520
if it's gotten any better.

936
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:14,480
Cause that's my fear is it actually gets good.

937
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:18,640
I'm hoping he just gets better and starts running Fedora like a real man.

938
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:19,640
Oh God.

939
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:25,320
Speaking of.net and whatnot, I just wanted to mention that friend of the show, Jeffrey

940
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:29,520
Snover, who they called me down to Microsoft, we had, I think we were critical about something

941
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:30,880
and they wanted to chat with us.

942
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:34,840
And so they invited me down there and I did an interview with Jeffrey and they let me

943
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:39,360
talk to anybody I wanted with the recorder on that, you know, didn't hide anything.

944
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:43,760
And it was really great because I got a real genuine insight into the transition Microsoft

945
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:46,520
went through over the last seven years.

946
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:48,600
And Jeffrey was a big part of that.

947
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:50,040
Really big part of that.

948
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:54,280
Jeffrey was also critical in Microsoft's adoption of PowerShell.

949
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:57,180
In Microsoft looking at the data center in a different way.

950
00:36:57,180 --> 00:37:01,240
In Microsoft looking at the data center possibly from a command line first perspective instead

951
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:02,440
of gooey in the data center.

952
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:03,440
Oh yeah.

953
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:04,440
Yeah.

954
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:06,600
And also just a lot of Linux adoption and open source culture adoption.

955
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:13,600
So Jeffrey tweeted about four hours ago as we record, after 22 awesome years at Microsoft,

956
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:18,840
18 of which were awesome in a good way, it's time for me to try something new.

957
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:19,840
So he's moving on.

958
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:23,160
His last day will be Friday, July 1st from Microsoft.

959
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:25,760
And I think he's a friend of the open source community, he's a friend of the show and he

960
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:30,120
tweeted a fantastic video that I played a little bit on our pre-show, which will be

961
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:35,520
up on Jupiter.tube of the process he had to go through to convince Microsoft to make some

962
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:36,520
of these transitions.

963
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:40,760
And that's why he said here, 18 plus of which were awesome in a good way.

964
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:43,560
There was a few years that weren't so great and he talks about those in the video that

965
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:44,560
I played in the pre-show.

966
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:47,200
So I'll put a link to that in the show notes.

967
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:49,480
So anyways, just wanted to say congratulations to Jeffrey.

968
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:50,480
Yes, congratulations.

969
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:51,480
That's fabulous.

970
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:55,240
I mean, it's on to good and better and greater things.

971
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:56,240
I am sure.

972
00:37:56,240 --> 00:38:00,560
I'm sure someone maybe or maybe, maybe he's just going to take it easy for a while.

973
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:01,600
That's what I hope he does.

974
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:02,600
He's definitely earned it.

975
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:03,600
You know what?

976
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:05,200
I just want to say we should all retire.

977
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:10,720
Yeah, I had a real realization that every show I do comes with a serious cost to my

978
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:11,720
health.

979
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:14,040
So is it me coughing up a lung that's making you realize that?

980
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:17,440
No, this show really, I think this show probably has the least cost to my health.

981
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:21,960
It's probably, it's, we've done, we've been doing this for so long, you know, like it's

982
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:22,960
easy.

983
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:26,600
But all the other shows, like they take so much damn work, not that this show doesn't

984
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:31,240
take work, but relatively speaking, you know, it doesn't, it's not the same kind of work.

985
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:32,880
It's a different, it's a much more stressful work.

986
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:33,880
Well, you know why?

987
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:39,760
Cause this is a, your co-host on the show is a gentleman who every once in a while shows

988
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:40,760
uploaded.

989
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:41,760
It's happened.

990
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:46,240
And then you got to walk them through it and get it, get them the fuck off the air.

991
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:47,240
Yeah.

992
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:48,240
That's not so bad though.

993
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:49,800
I mean, really it could be worse.

994
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:50,960
He could be talking about BSD.

995
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:52,680
Oh, that's really all I was going for.

996
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:53,680
Yeah.

997
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:54,680
That gets that.

998
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:57,200
That's where it gets rough.

999
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:59,440
TailScale.com slash coder.

1000
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:03,760
Go there to get a free personal account for up to 20 devices and of course you're supporting

1001
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:04,760
the show.

1002
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:10,460
If you haven't heard, TailScale is a zero config VPN and installs on any device in minutes.

1003
00:39:10,460 --> 00:39:11,800
It takes care of firewall rules.

1004
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:19,000
It manages NAT, including the dreaded double carrier NAT, which I have to contend with.

1005
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:23,500
Devices connect directly to each other using WireGuard's noise protocol encryption, building

1006
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:28,160
a mesh network using the best VPN security in the business.

1007
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:30,840
I absolutely love this invention.

1008
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:34,960
I knew years ago when WireGuard was getting work done that we'd see products like this,

1009
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:39,060
but I just didn't picture something as simple and straightforward as TailScale.

1010
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:41,280
They have this really awesome process.

1011
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:43,960
You're going to get just about any device up and running in minutes.

1012
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:45,920
I've got it on my mobile devices.

1013
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:47,480
I have it on my Raspberry Pis.

1014
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:48,920
I've got it in my VMs.

1015
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:51,420
I've got it on my NixOS machine.

1016
00:39:51,420 --> 00:39:54,920
Every NixOS machine I install, installs with TailScale.

1017
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:57,360
It's so simple to just add it in there too.

1018
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:59,960
And of course I love that it's backed by WireGuard.

1019
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:01,360
That's the genius of it.

1020
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:05,920
And if you want to use an enterprise with your single sign on and using two factor authentication,

1021
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:07,580
supports all of that.

1022
00:40:07,580 --> 00:40:10,840
And I love that the TailScale VPN is always on.

1023
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:14,040
And it's intelligent about the way it routes traffic too, so you're not just accidentally

1024
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:16,520
sending everything over the TailScale interface.

1025
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:18,980
It's really smart about what it routes over there.

1026
00:40:18,980 --> 00:40:22,040
And now all my machines have a static IP regardless of where I'm at.

1027
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:25,560
So if I need to get to a service or if I need SSH in or if I need to copy a file, this kind

1028
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:29,100
of stuff happens all the time, especially when I'm traveling, but it just happens between

1029
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:31,160
home and the office constantly too.

1030
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:32,520
TailScale solves it.

1031
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:36,520
TailScale solves it in a way that almost nothing solved it before.

1032
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:40,320
And it's so simple and straightforward to use and you can get it for free up to 20 devices

1033
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:41,920
and support the show.

1034
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:46,440

1037
00:40:55,320 --> 00:41:02,760
Ask not what your podcast can boost for you, but what you can boost for your podcast.

1038
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:03,760
That's right.

1039
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:05,400
We got some boosts to get to here.

1040
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:08,560
The Golden Dragon boosted in seven days ago with a row of ducks.

1041
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:09,560
I'm a duck.

1042
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:12,560
I'm a UK duck loaded with talent.

1043
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:13,560
Money's tight right now.

1044
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:16,800
I hope I can eventually find a dev one on the secondary for a decent price.

1045
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,880
I recently got ahold of some Python books.

1046
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:19,880
Don't worry.

1047
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:22,480
I drink all the time and buy them every two days.

1048
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:23,800
Just DM me.

1049
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:24,800
You'll be fine.

1050
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:27,800
It may need a new keyboard, but it'll be fine.

1051
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:30,960
I recently got ahold of some Python books to learn with.

1052
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:31,960
Anything I should be aware of.

1053
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:33,840
Boy, if you were starting a Python journey.

1054
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:34,840
You know what my man?

1055
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:35,840
DM me.

1056
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:41,520
I'm going to send you some more stuff and a couple TMB swag and Chris, with your permission,

1057
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:43,560
I have some vintage coder swag.

1058
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:44,680
Ooh, do it dude.

1059
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:46,240
I'm talking green coder.

1060
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:47,720
Remember the old green logo?

1061
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:50,800
I found it in a box from when I got divorced.

1062
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:56,400
The bottom of a box, I have a whole pile of them of the old coasters and some of the stickers

1063
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:57,720
yet.

1064
00:41:57,720 --> 00:42:00,800
The first ones.

1065
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:04,800
Although time has been cruel, so I would not trust these on like any tables that you care

1066
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:05,800
about.

1067
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:07,160
I don't know, man.

1068
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:08,160
I still use a couple of them.

1069
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:09,160
They still work.

1070
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:10,160
I have one on my desk.

1071
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:13,800
I thought it was the last one that I looked and I have like, I have like 50 of them.

1072
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:14,800
There you go.

1073
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:15,800
So yeah, man.

1074
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:16,800
DM me.

1075
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:17,800
I'll get you some stuff.

1076
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:18,800
There you go, Dragon.

1077
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:19,800
That's awesome.

1078
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:20,800
All right.

1079
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:26,680
Marcel boosted in seven days ago with a discounted row of ducks, 222 sats says, I love the sci-fi

1080
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:27,680
section.

1081
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:28,680
Talk about my love.

1082
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:29,680
We must.

1083
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:30,840
Would love to watch The Expanse too.

1084
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:31,840
If I can find it.

1085
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:32,840
I've heard so many great things.

1086
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:33,840
Thanks for the recommendation.

1087
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:35,840
It's on Amazon, Amazon prime, if you have that.

1088
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:36,840
The Expanse.

1089
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:37,840
I'm sorry.

1090
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:41,440
We got some emails in there like Mike's got to watch this and you know it, you saw it,

1091
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:42,440
you know it.

1092
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:44,800
I know it, but I saw something else.

1093
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:50,680
My beloved leathered out, armed with a bow and arrow, you have no idea what I'm talking

1094
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:51,680
about.

1095
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:53,680
I'm thinking like Xena, Hercules.

1096
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:59,500
No, this is, this is the new, the Star Trek, Strange New Worlds, they did a fantasy edition

1097
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:04,440
and she was like a ranger and she being a first officer.

1098
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:05,560
Number, what's your name?

1099
00:43:05,560 --> 00:43:06,800
Rachel Romay.

1100
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:10,080
Is that, is that her name, Marissa Romay?

1101
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:14,040
I refuse to acknowledge that I don't remember her name cause I feel like I'll get canceled.

1102
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:16,720
But it's Oona, it's, it's Oona on Strange New Worlds.

1103
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:17,720
Yeah.

1104
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:18,720
You got a, you got a real Oona thing going.

1105
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:20,280
If you know, you always do.

1106
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:21,440
You like a powerful women.

1107
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:22,440
I can tell.

1108
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:23,440
I am suffering.

1109
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:24,440
My fiance is very powerful.

1110
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:25,940
She's very angry.

1111
00:43:25,940 --> 00:43:32,420
I mean that in a general way and, but there's president Rosalind, which, listen, the Cylons

1112
00:43:32,420 --> 00:43:38,480
were, were dicks, like fighting the Cylons, you know, it's, it's something, but Oona,

1113
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:39,480
we should move on.

1114
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:40,480
You need to go.

1115
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:42,040
She got the command presence.

1116
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:43,040
All right.

1117
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:47,880
Space Ninja boosted in with also a row of ducks, 2,222 sats.

1118
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:48,880
Oh, thank you.

1119
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:49,880
Thank you very much.

1120
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:52,000
And here's something for your trouble.

1121
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,160
Adam is dead.

1122
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:54,160
Long live Adam.

1123
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:56,280
I guess I'm switching back to Vim.

1124
00:43:56,280 --> 00:43:57,280
That's hardcore dude.

1125
00:43:57,280 --> 00:44:02,320
Wait, you're going from Electron editor to Vim.

1126
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:03,320
That's what I thought.

1127
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:04,320
I'm like, well, but.

1128
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:05,320
I love you.

1129
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:06,320
Go with it.

1130
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:08,040
But don't, don't stop at Vim.

1131
00:44:08,040 --> 00:44:09,040
Let's talk about Emacs.

1132
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:15,300
I, I, Father, bless me, Father, for I have sinned.

1133
00:44:15,300 --> 00:44:18,800
It's been probably a week since my last confession at this point.

1134
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:19,800
Yeah.

1135
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:20,800
Well, let's see.

1136
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:21,800
It's been about one week since we've done the show.

1137
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:22,800
So.

1138
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:23,800
Yeah.

1139
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:27,320
I used to be an Emacs user until I got my first job doing high OS dev.

1140
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:31,600
I opened up, uh, Oh my God, what's the Mac version of Emacs called?

1141
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:32,600
It has a name.

1142
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:35,840
Are you thinking of BB edit or are you thinking of no, no, it's actually Emacs.

1143
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:36,840
Oh, you know what?

1144
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:37,840
I'm just going to look this up.

1145
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:38,840
Cause this is Emacs.

1146
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:39,840
You've got Emacs on the man.

1147
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:40,840
It's not just Emacs.

1148
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:44,760
It's a, is it some BSD like non canoe version?

1149
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:45,760
Yeah.

1150
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:48,480
No, there's some Mac version.

1151
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:49,480
It's a gooey.

1152
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:50,480
Yeah.

1153
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:51,480
Yeah.

1154
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:52,480
Yeah.

1155
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:53,480
Of course.

1156
00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:54,480
Yeah.

1157
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:55,480
Okay.

1158
00:44:55,480 --> 00:44:56,480
Okay.

1159
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:57,480
Apparently that's old school.

1160
00:44:57,480 --> 00:44:58,480
We're going back like 15 years, but I'm with you.

1161
00:44:58,480 --> 00:44:59,480
I'm with you.

1162
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:00,480
Okay.

1163
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:01,480
Whatever.

1164
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:02,480
So it's a Darwin, Darwin, max, the Emacs.

1165
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:03,480
Okay.

1166
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:05,240
Well, we don't call things Darwin anymore.

1167
00:45:05,240 --> 00:45:08,040
You know, that's not a thing that we don't talk about Darwin anymore.

1168
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:09,040
You know what?

1169
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:10,040
Say the name.

1170
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:11,720
That's all I'm just going to say.

1171
00:45:11,720 --> 00:45:14,880
Space Ninja does say that he's excited to see what the Adam creator has planned next.

1172
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:16,720
Wasn't that going to be like a rust based?

1173
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:20,880
I've been using warp warp scrape, but I'm not going to like let someone have telemetry

1174
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:22,320
in my terminal.

1175
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:26,280
But that seems like a bad plan anyway.

1176
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:28,800
So Emacs, I open up Emacs per se on the job.

1177
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:32,000
I'm a, I'm a brand new iOS developer.

1178
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,000
The world is great.

1179
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,800
I'm in Chelsea, New York.

1180
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:38,880
I can't even afford a beer downstairs cause I didn't know I was getting ripped off.

1181
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:39,880
I open Emacs.

1182
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:40,880
My boss comes over to me.

1183
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:41,880
Who's the CTO?

1184
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:43,360
Which tells you how small the company was.

1185
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:44,360
Yeah.

1186
00:45:44,360 --> 00:45:46,760
And he says, are you kidding me?

1187
00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:47,760
I said, what?

1188
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:48,760
What did I do wrong?

1189
00:45:48,760 --> 00:45:49,760
Day one.

1190
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:51,800
Oh my God.

1191
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:55,400
Get that off my machine right now.

1192
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:57,720
And from that day forward, I was a FEMM user.

1193
00:45:57,720 --> 00:45:58,720
Wow.

1194
00:45:58,720 --> 00:45:59,720
Yeah.

1195
00:45:59,720 --> 00:46:03,120
I had a, yeah, I've had a, when I was a young lad in IT, I had a rough, somebody came up

1196
00:46:03,120 --> 00:46:08,400
as I was spooling ethernet cable and basically had a freak out about how poor my spooling

1197
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:11,760
gave me a whole tear, tore me down over my spooling ethernet.

1198
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:14,400
There are no multi-line comments.

1199
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:16,000
I learned that one the hard way.

1200
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:17,000
Oh.

1201
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:18,000
Ooh.

1202
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,000
Ooh.

1203
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:20,000
All right.

1204
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:25,480
So Eric, seven days ago with 15,000 sats, boost.

1205
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:29,680
Now he says, Mosh is for if the internet is crappy.

1206
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:31,560
It's a Tmux session for bad connections.

1207
00:46:31,560 --> 00:46:35,760
And David actually wrote into the show this week too and said, I recommend Mosh on weak

1208
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:36,760
connections.

1209
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:42,600
I didn't mention it, but last week we were talking about bad connections and using Tmux.

1210
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:47,280
Mosh is the secret weapon for bad connectivity, cellular connectivity.

1211
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:48,440
It's great.

1212
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:49,440
It's great.

1213
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:53,940
One of the tricks, one of the tricks it does is it does a local echo back when you type

1214
00:46:53,940 --> 00:46:58,440
to make it look like things are real super fast and it handles intermittent connectivity

1215
00:46:58,440 --> 00:46:59,940
and all that kind of jazz.

1216
00:46:59,940 --> 00:47:05,160
In my misguided youth, I once did a job for a company that I can't name, but let's just

1217
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:08,960
say they are down with both Mufasa and Lord of Vader.

1218
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:13,240
And yes, Mosh was part of the toolkit to see if they were getting responses.

1219
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:14,240
Yeah.

1220
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:17,160
And it rides on top of SSH, so you're still getting the security of SSH.

1221
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:20,880
See, and it's pretty much in every single distros repo.

1222
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:23,080
So it's really easy to get installed.

1223
00:47:23,080 --> 00:47:26,240
It's also in homebrew if you're on the Macintosh.

1224
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:27,480
I really do recommend it.

1225
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:30,980
So both thank you to David and Eric for sending that in.

1226
00:47:30,980 --> 00:47:39,200
And then we did get a thank you boost Freak sent in 8,472 sats to say thank you guys for

1227
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:40,200
the show.

1228
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:41,200
So thank you Freak.

1229
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:47,400
I think the worst part of this for me is I still don't understand what podcasting 2.0

1230
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:48,400
is.

1231
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:53,960
When I started talking about it, I was so focused on the boosts, but it's just an update

1232
00:47:53,960 --> 00:47:59,480
to the RSS spec that allows for a standardized way to do things like alternative enclosures.

1233
00:47:59,480 --> 00:48:03,200
You could do like Opus and MP3 transcripts.

1234
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:04,200
Whatever happened to AUG?

1235
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:05,200
Remember AUG?

1236
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:06,200
Yeah.

1237
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:10,280
AUG Vorbis was used quite a bit, but then the patents expired on MP3.

1238
00:48:10,280 --> 00:48:14,360
And so everybody just kind of said, all right, well, now that the patent is just sort of

1239
00:48:14,360 --> 00:48:21,120
cleared up, it just went all MP3 to the point where a lot of the platforms that are in podcasting

1240
00:48:21,120 --> 00:48:26,400
now like Spotify and iTunes and Google and et cetera, et cetera, they don't even allow

1241
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:27,760
you to upload an AUG file.

1242
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:28,760
You can't even do it.

1243
00:48:28,760 --> 00:48:29,760
Really?

1244
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:31,080
They actually block it by the file type?

1245
00:48:31,080 --> 00:48:32,080
Yeah.

1246
00:48:32,080 --> 00:48:36,980
The services don't even, they don't even recognize it as a valid file format.

1247
00:48:36,980 --> 00:48:41,880
So podcasting 2.0 is like taking a lot of these things that different vendors had kind

1248
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:46,660
of modified the RSS spec on their own, and it's just making a spec out of it that application

1249
00:48:46,660 --> 00:48:47,660
developers can follow.

1250
00:48:47,660 --> 00:48:53,160
And so there's a handful of new podcast apps over at newpodcastapps.com that support these

1251
00:48:53,160 --> 00:48:54,160
specs.

1252
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:59,920
A real time update, apparently beer, pretzel, sausage, and a tour are on Alex.

1253
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:01,540
So Whoa, dude.

1254
00:49:01,540 --> 00:49:05,720
You know, but then we got to actually get together in person in real life.

1255
00:49:05,720 --> 00:49:09,440
You and I will never meet, so you'll go to Berlin, I'll go to Munich.

1256
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:10,440
We'll divide and conquer.

1257
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:11,440
Conquer in Europe?

1258
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:14,240
See, I'm not sure that I would use.

1259
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:16,080
That was probably the wrong language.

1260
00:49:16,080 --> 00:49:20,880
Although I do have a meeting with an uncle of mine who's very angry right now.

1261
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:21,880
Yeah.

1262
00:49:21,880 --> 00:49:24,640
Is he very angry?

1263
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:30,560
I would say he is disappointed at the fall of the Soviet Union.

1264
00:49:30,560 --> 00:49:34,080
Very disappointed comrade.

1265
00:49:34,080 --> 00:49:39,960
I remember when we were great, I was young intelligence officer, I might have taken car

1266
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:44,400
battery to the balls of many Westerners.

1267
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:46,520
This is a we got a I'm sorry.

1268
00:49:46,520 --> 00:49:47,520
I'm sorry.

1269
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:48,520
Yeah.

1270
00:49:48,520 --> 00:49:49,520
I apologize for it.

1271
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:50,520
It's you know what?

1272
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:51,520
Drew loves you anyways.

1273
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:53,560
Are you know who else loves you is our members.

1274
00:49:53,560 --> 00:49:55,160
The coder QA crew.

1275
00:49:55,160 --> 00:49:56,160
They do.

1276
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:57,160
They do.

1277
00:49:57,160 --> 00:49:58,160
And you know what?

1278
00:49:58,160 --> 00:49:59,160
I think we owe them a show next week.

1279
00:49:59,160 --> 00:50:00,160
We do owe them.

1280
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:01,160
You're right.

1281
00:50:01,160 --> 00:50:02,400
And the other thing I'm working on for them, although it's still in the it's in the plumbing

1282
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:08,020
phase, but I am working on getting them the much requested live feed so they can get the

1283
00:50:08,020 --> 00:50:12,480
full raw live feed, which will probably make some of them cancel their membership.

1284
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:14,840
But it'll be available as an option along with the ad free.

1285
00:50:14,840 --> 00:50:18,120
They can they can hear me choke and understand the heart disease.

1286
00:50:18,120 --> 00:50:20,620
They can hear me manage you a little bit more.

1287
00:50:20,620 --> 00:50:21,620
They can hear the swearing.

1288
00:50:21,620 --> 00:50:23,440
The pre and post shows really why people like it.

1289
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:25,160
I think I'm less crazy.

1290
00:50:25,160 --> 00:50:26,920
I'm just gonna say the recorded version.

1291
00:50:26,920 --> 00:50:27,920
I sound less nuts.

1292
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:28,920
Yeah.

1293
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:29,920
Yeah.

1294
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:30,920
That's what we pay drew for.

1295
00:50:30,920 --> 00:50:33,000
But you know what?

1296
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,700
Like some people, they that's why they tune in live, right?

1297
00:50:35,700 --> 00:50:39,600
It's like the folks that like the live stream, but they just can't make it on Monday at noon

1298
00:50:39,600 --> 00:50:40,600
Pacific 3 p.m.

1299
00:50:40,600 --> 00:50:41,600
Eastern.

1300
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:42,600
Like that's like 90 percent of people.

1301
00:50:42,600 --> 00:50:45,960
So I feel like you're defining unfiltered listeners right now.

1302
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:48,120
Maybe they're out there still.

1303
00:50:48,120 --> 00:50:49,120
Hello you.

1304
00:50:49,120 --> 00:50:50,120
But thank you to our members.

1305
00:50:50,120 --> 00:50:52,920
If you'd like to become one to get access to the ad free version, the Coderly report

1306
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:56,340
that we do once a quarter and the live feed once it is available.

1307
00:50:56,340 --> 00:51:00,360
That's all at Coder QA dot co or you can sign up to support the entire network at Jupiter

1308
00:51:00,360 --> 00:51:01,360
dot party.

1309
00:51:01,360 --> 00:51:04,600
Then you get all the bonus features for all the shows, be a pro.

1310
00:51:04,600 --> 00:51:07,680
And I am I am working on Chris to get those ropes back.

1311
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:08,680
Yeah, you are.

1312
00:51:08,680 --> 00:51:09,680
I love it.

1313
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:10,680
Where should we send people?

1314
00:51:10,680 --> 00:51:12,240
You got you got like a URL.

1315
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:14,740
You got like a website, you know, these things that you can put up.

1316
00:51:14,740 --> 00:51:17,080
There's this whole hypertext transport protocol.

1317
00:51:17,080 --> 00:51:18,080
And then there's.

1318
00:51:18,080 --> 00:51:19,080
Yeah.

1319
00:51:19,080 --> 00:51:22,040
Well, it's really it's crazy, man, because then you can put like text.

1320
00:51:22,040 --> 00:51:25,320
I would like to send to you one or nine and one or one one one.

1321
00:51:25,320 --> 00:51:26,320
Yeah.

1322
00:51:26,320 --> 00:51:27,320
OK, sure.

1323
00:51:27,320 --> 00:51:28,320
And then you'll have like a text file.

1324
00:51:28,320 --> 00:51:30,320
And if you end it like dot HTML, just add to it.

1325
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:32,520
Add that to go on Twitter.

1326
00:51:32,520 --> 00:51:33,520
That's fine.

1327
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:34,520
Oh, OK.

1328
00:51:34,520 --> 00:51:35,520
Easy.

1329
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:38,880
But that's not like a URL, man, like, you know, the web's going it's going to be a web

1330
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:39,880
of URLs.

1331
00:51:39,880 --> 00:51:40,880
You got to check it out.

1332
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:41,880
All right.

1333
00:51:41,880 --> 00:51:42,880
Fine.

1334
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:43,880
HTTPS, I guess.

1335
00:51:43,880 --> 00:51:44,880
Alice Dot Def.

1336
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:45,880
There you go.

1337
00:51:45,880 --> 00:51:46,880
Yeah, I like that.

1338
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:48,480
I'll plug Jupiter Tube.

1339
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:51,880
We are streaming Coder Radio at Jupiter Dot Tube.

1340
00:51:51,880 --> 00:51:53,600
The live version gets archived there.

1341
00:51:53,600 --> 00:51:56,780
It is a total free software streaming platform.

1342
00:51:56,780 --> 00:51:59,880
It's like YouTube in a box, but it's peer to peer.

1343
00:51:59,880 --> 00:52:00,880
So that's neat.

1344
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:01,880
And I'll mention it.

1345
00:52:01,880 --> 00:52:02,880
Jupiter Dot Tube.

1346
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:03,880
If you want to check it out.

1347
00:52:03,880 --> 00:52:04,880
And you can also catch live stream shows over there.

1348
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:08,640
Also, the links to what we talk about, the things here in this show that come up, things

1349
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:10,700
are available over on our websites.

1350
00:52:10,700 --> 00:52:16,700
That's available at HTTPS and you put a colon in there slash slash Coder Dot Show and then

1351
00:52:16,700 --> 00:52:22,540
slash WAC 472 and then you'll get links to what we talked about today.

1352
00:52:22,540 --> 00:52:24,120
It's real super easy like that.

1353
00:52:24,120 --> 00:52:28,960
Our contact form is over there as well at Coder Dot Show slash contact and our RSS feed

1354
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:31,800
that's a Coder Dot Show slash subscribe.

1355
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:33,740
Actually it's just Coder Dot Show slash RSS.

1356
00:52:33,740 --> 00:52:35,120
It's really simple.

1357
00:52:35,120 --> 00:52:36,120
It's super great.

1358
00:52:36,120 --> 00:52:39,960
I mean, we can't make this much easier for you guys if you get this up.

1359
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:40,960
Not on us anymore.

1360
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:45,520
And also, I'm 100 percent sure I have whatever my son has because I just yeah, you're dying

1361
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:46,520
over there.

1362
00:52:46,520 --> 00:52:47,520
Yeah.

1363
00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:48,520
I hope you're all right.

1364
00:52:48,520 --> 00:52:49,520
We'll check in on you.

1365
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:50,520
The worst part is I'm drinking tea and water right now.

1366
00:52:50,520 --> 00:52:53,600
I if I'm going to do a bad show, I'd like to be drunk.

1367
00:52:53,600 --> 00:52:54,600
Yeah.

1368
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:55,600
Well, maybe next week.

1369
00:52:55,600 --> 00:52:56,600
There's always next week, man.

1370
00:52:56,600 --> 00:52:57,600
Maybe.

1371
00:52:57,600 --> 00:53:00,240
All right, everyone, thanks so much for doing this week's episode.

1372
00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:28,680
We'll see you right back here next week, hopefully, if Mike doesn't die.
