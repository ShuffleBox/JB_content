00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,720
This is KOTORadio, episode 476 for July 25th, 2022.

2
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:19,240
Hey there good buddy, welcome back to Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show, taking

3
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:25,500
a pragmatic look at the art and the business of software development in the world of technology.

4
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:30,240
My name is Chris and sitting there with a very, very special hat, it's our host, Mr.

5
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:31,240
Dominic.

6
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:32,240
Hello, Mike.

7
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:33,240
Hello.

8
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:34,240
Hello.

9
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:35,240
Hello, sir.

10
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:36,240
I like the whole vibe today.

11
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:39,440
You feel like, I don't know, in my ears, you just feel closer.

12
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:40,440
It's intimate.

13
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:42,160
It's like you're right here whispering into my ear.

14
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:43,160
Love it.

15
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:45,000
I think it's this new audio pipeline.

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,920
Anyways, I saw the news that you got yourself one of them little baby launches.

17
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:50,640
Yeah, it's a review unit.

18
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:51,640
I'm using it right now.

19
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:53,400
So I don't know if you could hear that.

20
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:55,040
It's quieter, isn't it?

21
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:56,040
It's quieter.

22
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:57,040
It's smaller.

23
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:58,040
Is it much smaller?

24
00:00:58,040 --> 00:00:59,800
Yeah, I'm going to live in it a little longer.

25
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:00,800
It's not that much.

26
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:01,800
It's weirdly smaller.

27
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:02,800
Okay.

28
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:08,360
I definitely could see who the user for this is, though for my money, I think I prefer

29
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:13,320
the classic launch, particularly because you know that USB hub is super helpful.

30
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,860
So when it's smaller, what did they sacrifice?

31
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:19,640
Does it not have the F keys and like, does it not have the home and page up buttons along

32
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:20,640
the side?

33
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,640
What was, what was?

34
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:22,840
It has the home and page up.

35
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:28,320
The arrows are aligned like, so the right arrow is aligned with the end key and there's

36
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,160
no space between them.

37
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:33,480
The number and function row is one combination row.

38
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:35,280
I'm looking at mine right now as you talk.

39
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,920
So I'm like, I'm like visualizing it as you.

40
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:38,920
Okay.

41
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:39,920
Hmm.

42
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:40,920
Good experience.

43
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:44,760
I got, I got the pink switches, the quiet switches, which I, you know, I'm usually more

44
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:48,680
of a middle of the road kind of clicky guys, but this isn't bad.

45
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:52,800
I mean, I do type a one L I think I have enough muscle memory for the bigger one.

46
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:58,080
One that it is something of a change, but I could see people who maybe are just ever

47
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:01,360
so slightly more desks and strains wanting this.

48
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:05,940
The only additional thing I think I would want that might make me like this model better

49
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:09,120
than the classic launch is for its small size.

50
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,880
It really should be wireless.

51
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:13,080
Oh, wireless would be killer.

52
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:16,200
Cause then it'd be like a fancy like magic keyboard replacement.

53
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:20,120
Now I can understand when it's a USB hub, USB hub and whatnot, why you couldn't have

54
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,120
one wireless.

55
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:28,680
But interesting, maybe that's a launch three, you know, you never know, you never know.

56
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,960
You got to figure too, they got to make it smaller if they're ever going to get it built

57
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,940
into a laptop.

58
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:36,720
So if they're ever going to get it into a laptop, they got to keep working that down.

59
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:42,320
Chunky pie wrote into the show and he's feeling the call of the M says, I love listening to

60
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:45,200
you guys talk about programming in four 75.

61
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:49,080
Uh, he says your conversation over declarative UI was interesting.

62
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:56,320
I hate programming UIs and dealing with all the text boxes, buttons and screen sizes.

63
00:02:56,320 --> 00:03:01,360
Now here's the thing, Mike, he says, I love Linux and I love supporting made for Linux

64
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:07,640
laptops, but guys, those new M one and M two Mac books are sexy.

65
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:10,800
I can't wait till Asahi Linux is 100% baked.

66
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:14,520
I think I'm going to have to get an M two or an M three at that point.

67
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:16,720
Love what you're doing.

68
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:23,120
Now I think you'll recall that your humble co-host here proclaimed that he was concerned

69
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:29,380
that over the years, and I think it's been about a year since he made this concern public,

70
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:34,360
he was concerned that we would see a drainage to the Mac from the Linux community, much

71
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:40,240
like we did when the whole genome three unity situation happened.

72
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:44,580
We saw a big exodus to the Intel Mac platform and then that happened to be right around

73
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:46,720
when Apple did a processor transition.

74
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:50,960
Here we are again, Apple's doing a processor transition and I feel like we're going to

75
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:55,860
see a big exodus to the Mac and I think we have, I kind of actually think my prediction

76
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:59,720
has bared out just based on a lot of anecdotal data.

77
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:05,600
Yeah, I think it's, it's, uh, in fact we have something to show from a John Grouper, which

78
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:10,600
I know is super Apple fan person, but you can't, you can't fight the numbers and the

79
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:15,360
power efficiency on these M1 chips and M2 chips, but more of the M1s.

80
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,240
That's something the industry just needs to catch up to.

81
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:19,640
I mean, there's really no two ways about it.

82
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:26,560
The situation with multi monitors and high DPI and high refresh rate, while it's not

83
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:31,180
like amazing on the Mac, it's so much better than Linux.

84
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:38,640
Our buddy Brent is down at Alex's house and Alex has a bunch of nice screens and Brent's

85
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:43,000
kind of experiencing for the first time what it's like when you have an NVIDIA GPU and

86
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:48,120
you got some high DPI, high refresh rate screens and using the plasma desktop and things sometimes

87
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:53,080
just don't work, they get rearranged, the monitors get weird refresh issues.

88
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:57,060
Like there's, he's running into all these problems and I have to tell you, I have heard

89
00:04:57,060 --> 00:05:00,680
from a lot of people in the audience that like, yeah, I got a Mac book, it's just worked

90
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:04,520
so good with my external monitors, you know, the battery lasts all day.

91
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:09,680
Funix enough, right, I don't really hear about a lot of people defecting to Windows.

92
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:14,520
You hear about the WSL stories and how it's great, but those are existing Windows users,

93
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:15,520
right?

94
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:20,720
But I hear a lot of Linux users converting to the Mac.

95
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,760
You and I both know a former Linux podcaster who's no longer a Linux podcaster who switched

96
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:27,760
to the Mac.

97
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:30,600
I don't know, I think it'll ebb and flow, to be honest with you.

98
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:34,360
I think the Linux desktop is in kind of this vulnerable transition point right now where

99
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:38,440
we don't have open source NVIDIA drivers, but in a year or two, that's going to be really

100
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:39,680
solid.

101
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:46,120
We're really on, like we're seeing good momentum on the transition to Wayland, but not really

102
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,120
fully there yet.

103
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,120
It doesn't work for everybody.

104
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:50,640
There's a lot of things like that right now.

105
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:51,640
We'll see.

106
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:54,960
Stone writes in, he says, hello, long time listener, first time caller.

107
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:58,600
I was listening to the latest Coder episode and wanted to drop my two cents on the declarative

108
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,720
UI portion of the show.

109
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:06,640
For background, I'm a Flutter developer and I have been working in Flutter since sometime

110
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,080
during the V1 release.

111
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:13,720
I also work in ReactJS and I've tried my hand at Xamarin or I think it's maybe Xamarin,

112
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:17,880
React Native and even a little bit of UW Piskis.

113
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:23,280
To the point of write once and it looks great everywhere, I have to say Flutter is the closest

114
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:28,120
to this dream of all of the alternatives that have been discussed.

115
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:33,320
Unlike other cross-platform frameworks, Flutter uses its own rendering engine, allowing for

116
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:38,400
custom UI elements that really do look like the same thing no matter what platform it's

117
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,560
running on.

118
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:42,840
This is opposed to the way other cross-platform libraries work in which essentially just a

119
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:47,180
library that translates to a native UI and makes it harder to have consistent look and

120
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:51,920
feel across platforms like iOS, Android or the desktop.

121
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:56,920
Now, I'm not saying it's perfect by any stretch of the imagination.

122
00:06:56,920 --> 00:07:01,400
Productive development, while technically officially supported, still runs rather horribly

123
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:05,640
on mobile browsers and he goes on to say there is still an amount of work needed to make

124
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:08,640
the UI adaptive based on device size.

125
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:14,040
However, the overall polish, performance and ease of development outweighs the cons in

126
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:16,040
my opinion.

127
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:24,320
I've brought multiple production applications to market using Flutter and I think we'll

128
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:29,020
only see more examples of this as the platform matures.

129
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:35,040
One thing though, to warn anyone considering Flutter, at some point you will have to gain

130
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:37,920
some basic knowledge in Swift and Kotlin.

131
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:41,520
This is if you want to actually hook into the platform's native function, think like

132
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:45,560
local authentication, where plugins are not available or you're just going to have to

133
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:47,280
do something where you write it yourself.

134
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:50,440
He says, looking forward to the upcoming meetups too.

135
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:52,800
Yeah, you probably agree with this take.

136
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:53,800
Yeah, for sure.

137
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:59,240
This is, I mean, we keep hearing about the Flutter, what we call them, the Flutter birds

138
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:01,360
keep chirping at us.

139
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:06,080
I will say, Chris is right, like every other cross-platform framework, you're eventually

140
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,880
going to have to drop under the hood.

141
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:12,280
It might take a while, you might have to ship a few apps without doing it, but one day you're

142
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:14,760
going to have to and just be prepared.

143
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:17,440
Good input and feedback though.

144
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,440
Thank you, Stone.

145
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:19,440
I like hearing about that.

146
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,480
I just, I got a tingle about Flutter recently.

147
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:25,040
Just seeing more and more like just things in the community and whatnot of projects people

148
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,120
are working on.

149
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,960
Who knows?

150
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:32,080
Maybe you can come tell me at some of our upcoming meetups, because holy smokes do we

151
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,480
have some meetups.

152
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:39,140
Meetup.com slash Jupiter broadcasting, Friday, August 5th, 6pm local time.

153
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:42,680
There is a meetup in London and I'm trying to think if there's anything else I need to

154
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:47,120
relate to you about that, but the details are at the meetup.com page.

155
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:51,080
And then we have all of the dates for our West Coast tour.

156
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:54,460
Those are also at meetup.com slash Jupiter broadcasting.

157
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:55,780
Start signing up for that.

158
00:08:55,780 --> 00:09:03,440
And then last but not least, this is the big one, the tour lottery form.

159
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:09,900
If you are in the Pasadena area and would like to get a tour of JPL, you can join the

160
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:15,120
lottery at linuxunplug.com slash JPL.

161
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,920
Really quick little form we have on Nextcloud.

162
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:21,180
You fill that out and then we're going to run a little script to pick 15 names and probably

163
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:24,480
five or so backups just in case somebody can't make it.

164
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:30,640
We just ask that if you sign up that you can definitely be in the area when it is time,

165
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:37,760
which is September 29th around 12.30pm in the Pasadena area at the JPL offices.

166
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:40,760
So that's going to be pretty awesome, but it's such a limited availability.

167
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:48,200
We had to do it as a lottery, so it's linuxunplug.com slash JPL for that.

168
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:50,400
Linode.com slash coder.

169
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:54,640
Go there to get $100 in 60-day credit on a new account, and of course it's a great way

170
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,280
to support the show.

171
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:58,880
Linode is fast, reliable cloud hosting.

172
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,120
You really got to go try it.

173
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:02,960
That's why they're giving you a hundred bucks to see what I'm talking about, because they

174
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:05,800
do it so much better than everyone else.

175
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:08,980
The best way to understand that is to experience it.

176
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:12,840
And speaking of experience, if you're brand new to deploying a server, they've got a marketplace

177
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:18,260
where you can deploy all kinds of useful things, like a system ready to go with Docker or Git

178
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:19,420
lab instance.

179
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:24,600
Perhaps you want Drupal or one that I just was looking at and I thought, geez, I should

180
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,440
mention this on the show.

181
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:32,980
They have Easy Panel, which is, well, as it says, it's an easy panel based on Docker that

182
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:38,800
lets you deploy Node.js, Ruby, Python, PHP, Go, and Java applications in their intuitive

183
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:39,800
control panel.

184
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:42,040
It manages the SSL certs.

185
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:45,600
You can even run commands on the command line through the browser interface.

186
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:49,740
And of course it integrates with GitHub, so you can push and pull your code down to it.

187
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:52,260
And that's just a one click deployment on Linode.

188
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:56,340
And if you're a pro, they got options for you too, including guides that let you build

189
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:58,720
systems up from the ground up.

190
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,560
They even have bare metal rigs.

191
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:05,800
And one of the back end features I love on Linode is their S3 compatible object storage.

192
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:06,860
It's so handy.

193
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:11,640
We use it for all kinds of storage for systems that are kind of always accumulating data,

194
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:15,320
like our Nextcloud instance or our PeerTube instance, but it's also just a great way to

195
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:19,800
distribute certain high availability files, like XML files for an RSS feed and things

196
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,080
like that.

197
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:24,600
And they've been doing this for nearly 19 years, so they've managed to build the best

198
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:27,560
way to run applications on Linux in the cloud.

199
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:31,280
With 11 data centers around the world, they are their own ISP, so their connection is

200
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:32,400
super fast.

201
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,940
And they're always investing back into the hardware.

202
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:37,440
They just recently added MVMe PCI storage.

203
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,880
Before that, they upgraded AMD EPYC processors.

204
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:46,480
They've just launched a database as a service, service.

205
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,800
There's probably a better way I could say that.

206
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:49,800
But I think you know what I mean.

207
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:52,720
I mean, I could just go on and on, but I think probably the best thing to do would be to

208
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,860
get that $100 and try it.

209
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:55,860
Why not get that $100?

210
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:58,160
Leave it on the table and go support the show.

211
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,240
Go to linode.com slash coder.

212
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:05,080
Once again, that's linode.com slash coder.

213
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:09,880
Well, John Gruber was feeling spicy this week.

214
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:16,280
He's got Apple Silicon is an inconvenient truth as opposed to one of his, I guess, links.

215
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:18,240
I don't know what he calls them.

216
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:24,200
But he's calling out a trend that I've noticed and you may have noticed, but recently, certain

217
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:33,520
review outlets like the Wirecutter and Ars Technica are excluding the MacBooks, the M

218
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:35,800
series MacBooks from comparison.

219
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:43,220
So they'll compare, say, the Surface Go 2 and they'll compare it against other X86 laptops,

220
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:46,520
but they won't put the M series machines in there.

221
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:53,480
And what's a little sticky about that, when they reviewed the Surface Go 1, they absolutely

222
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:54,760
compared it against MacBooks.

223
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:56,400
They were just Intel MacBooks at the time.

224
00:12:56,400 --> 00:13:01,220
But when they made the transition to the M series, they kind of quietly just stopped

225
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:05,640
comparing the Intel laptops to the MacBooks.

226
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:11,600
And Gruber writes that he's quite certain that the reviewers are just essentially leaving

227
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:17,120
it out because they don't want to piss off the PC fans in their audience.

228
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:21,760
And that he says, quote, Apple Silicon is profoundly an inconvenient truth for many

229
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:28,000
computer enthusiasts who do not like Macs, so they've gone into denial.

230
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:34,800
And to appease them, he postulates, Wirecutter, Ars and others are just taking the Macs out

231
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:38,080
of the comparison altogether.

232
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,240
Is that what's going on, do you think?

233
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:42,240
Or is there maybe something less dramatic?

234
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,320
I think there's a couple things going on, right?

235
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:49,080
On the flame side, I would even add that, you know, people like to get review units,

236
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,080
right?

237
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:54,480
But pissing off the people is usually not done, right?

238
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:55,480
You're right.

239
00:13:55,480 --> 00:14:00,620
Like if they make the surface book to look like a clown in the battery life department

240
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:05,000
and in the temperature department, then there might not they might not get access to another

241
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
one.

242
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Right.

243
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:11,960
I mean, the reality is, if you're not, for some reason, bound to Windows, and you're

244
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:17,440
just like, oh, you know, a regular non, let's say non Linux enthusiast.

245
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:22,320
There's not a real good reason not to buy a Mac other than maybe price.

246
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:26,220
But even then, those errors are pretty affordable, the M1 errors.

247
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:32,880
So yeah, I kind of think this is Intel and AMD have to get their shit together.

248
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:36,760
And the lead is pretty significant for Apple Silicon right now.

249
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:38,880
I'll play devil's advocate just for fun.

250
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:45,360
I'll say that perhaps what's going on now is just a realization in the marketplace that

251
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:50,440
if you're buying a Windows laptop, there is probably a motivator that's putting you into

252
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:52,520
the Windows ecosystem.

253
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:55,160
And so you're not really in the market for a Mac.

254
00:14:55,160 --> 00:15:00,400
So it's probably more fair to compare the Macs against Macs and the X86 boxes against

255
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,120
other Wintel systems.

256
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:05,280
I mean, because you see, you could take this as far as, well, why isn't there an Ubuntu

257
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:06,280
system in the mix?

258
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,280
And right.

259
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:08,400
Like, where do you draw the line?

260
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:12,680
So they have to look at the actual consumer market and go, well, if you're shopping for

261
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:14,920
a surface go, you're in the Windows ecosystem.

262
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:19,860
So therefore we'll compare it to other comparable Windows ecosystem laptops.

263
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:21,600
It's not a complete picture.

264
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,800
It's like a slicing of the market.

265
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:25,440
But maybe that's what's at play here.

266
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,760
I mean, that does make sense.

267
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:31,780
I would also say that price range stuff, particularly with the M2s and MacBook Pros, they could

268
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:35,360
argue that, well, we're looking at a price budget and these are just way out of it.

269
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,360
Yeah.

270
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:39,920
Although the go, you know, I mean, the goes like the price of an air, right?

271
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,080
I don't, I don't know for sure.

272
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:46,080
But I so I think the point that Gruber makes in there because he makes this kind of ham

273
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:48,600
fisted comparison to climate change deniers.

274
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:53,080
And I think what I take from that comparison is.

275
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:57,920
If he if they were demonstrating the benchmarks and the comparisons against the MacBook, it

276
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:06,120
would put pressure on the PC OEMs to do better, to produce computers that consume less power,

277
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:09,800
that produce less heat, that have faster disk drives.

278
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:13,360
You know, he would put pressure on them to produce better machines.

279
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:17,440
And so it'd be long term better for the entire market.

280
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,280
I don't I don't think that's actually how things work.

281
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:20,280
Right.

282
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:21,280
Like what is Intel?

283
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:25,800
OK, well, Intel will just, you know, crank the knob to faster and less power.

284
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,880
Yeah, they're not going to do that.

285
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:28,880
Right.

286
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:29,880
Like Intel.

287
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:33,240
I say AMD has something more of a chance.

288
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:37,280
But even then, it's Apple really has a winner here with with this Apple.

289
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:41,640
And I know people aren't going to like to hear that, but it's just the truth.

290
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:46,240
Yeah, especially when you consider they've been able to scale it from watches to set

291
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:50,640
top boxes, phones, tablets and something like the Mac Studio.

292
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:51,960
Yeah, that's pretty impressive.

293
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:53,160
I have to give it to them.

294
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:56,160
OK, but let's talk about where they're not so impressive.

295
00:16:56,160 --> 00:17:04,800
This is both the most ridiculous small change ever and a monumental moment that took a decade

296
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:08,120
to actually make happen.

297
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:13,920
Netflix is rolling out an external subscription button for iOS users.

298
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:16,520
Just to kind of give you some history here.

299
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:18,700
This has been a back and forth for a long time.

300
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:25,960
And back in 2018, Netflix just removed the ability to subscribe within Apple's ecosystem

301
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:29,560
altogether because of Apple's 30 percent cut.

302
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:33,320
So now there's a button in the app to subscribe.

303
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:36,960
We hit that a message comes up that says, quote, you're about to leave the app and go

304
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:39,000
to an external website.

305
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:44,520
And then it also tells you that the transaction will have Apple have no responsibility if

306
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:49,440
things go sideways and that subscription management will have to be done independently.

307
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:50,440
You're not going to get that.

308
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:52,280
You got to do that on Netflix's site.

309
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:57,000
And once they once you clear that message, their page comes up and it's a pretty big

310
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
message, too.

311
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:03,760
It's like a full screen modal dialog that comes up with big, bold text that tells you

312
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:07,360
you're going somewhere dangerous, basically.

313
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:11,560
But you get to do it and then you get to subscribe outside of the Apple ecosystem via the Web

314
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:12,560
browser.

315
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:13,560
Right.

316
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:18,880
And the app developer in this case, Netflix gets to basically have that customer relationship,

317
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:21,080
which is what they always wanted.

318
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:24,640
Netflix just wants to be in a relationship with you, Chris.

319
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:25,920
Yeah, directly.

320
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:28,420
They don't want they don't want it to be a three way.

321
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:30,360
They just want it to be a one on one thing.

322
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:31,360
Nomination to.

323
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,360
Yeah.

324
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:33,400
This, though.

325
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,400
It's so funny.

326
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,400
Right.

327
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:39,720
What we're talking about is ostensibly Netflix is now allowed to put a link that opens up

328
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:43,600
the Web browser and shows a page where you can subscribe.

329
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:46,100
That's all that's happened.

330
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:51,280
And it's taken almost quite literally the run of this entire show to materialize.

331
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:52,280
Yeah.

332
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:53,280
So far.

333
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,280
Yeah.

334
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:55,280
That's where we're at right now.

335
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:57,000
That's where things are at these days.

336
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:01,120
But there's small little things like I've noticed, too, that Google, I think it's in

337
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:02,120
the EU.

338
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:03,120
I could be wrong.

339
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,120
I apologize.

340
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:05,840
I didn't grab this before the show.

341
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:11,680
But Google is now also allowing another payment processor in a rather large Western market

342
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:13,400
that isn't Google.

343
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:15,280
They're allowing a third party payment system.

344
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,360
And now Apple is expected to do the same.

345
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:19,920
But we don't have details on that yet.

346
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:25,000
After a dozen years, I don't know how long the app store has been around 10 years more.

347
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,200
And this we've gotten this far.

348
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,200
Apple held the line.

349
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,840
The other watches on the wall.

350
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:38,120
Yeah, I think Apple rightly recognized several years ago that the app store is a 20 year

351
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:39,360
moneymaker for them.

352
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:40,360
Right.

353
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:44,040
You can buy a device once every couple of years, but you hopefully are going to get

354
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:49,240
to the point where you're subscribed to Apple Arcade and you're buying an app every couple

355
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:50,240
apps a month.

356
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:52,600
You got a couple of subscriptions going right.

357
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:53,880
They don't need it to be a lot.

358
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:54,880
Right.

359
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:59,520
And if they could get 15 bucks, 20 bucks out of you a month, they're happy, right?

360
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:01,720
And the app store is a huge player in that.

361
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:05,680
And I think that's why they just fight it so relentlessly, because long term, I think

362
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:09,360
they see it as kind of how they're going to get rent.

363
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,500
Sweet, sweet recurring revenue.

364
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:15,120
Everybody loves it, man.

365
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:17,400
Talescale.com slash coder.

366
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:20,240
Go there to get a free personal account for up to 20 devices.

367
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:23,080
And of course, it's a great way to support the show.

368
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:26,120
Tale is my favorite VPN solution by a mile.

369
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:31,320
It's a zero config VPN that installs on any device in minutes, manages your firewall rules

370
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:35,200
and it works from anywhere, even in double carrier net situations.

371
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,000
I can attest to that.

372
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:41,800
Devices connect directly to each other using wire guards, noise protocol, building you

373
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:46,200
a mesh network with the best VPN security in the business.

374
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:51,080
And you'd be surprised how quickly and easily you can create a network between your servers,

375
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:55,480
your computers and your cloud instances and create one flat network where everything has

376
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:56,720
a static IP.

377
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:01,200
And yeah, you could even put a pie hole system in that network or any DNS server and you

378
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:04,560
can start doing name resolution in your Talescale network.

379
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:08,400
I use it to keep all of my family computers connected, all of the studios computers connected.

380
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,400
It's how I do tech support.

381
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,400
It's how I do work.

382
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:13,240
It's a major component to be able to get to.

383
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:16,220
Well, they're not even like super secure resources.

384
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:19,240
Actually the resources that are just not secure enough.

385
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:20,960
And so I don't want to put them on the public web.

386
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:23,400
I don't even want to open up ports on my firewall.

387
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:28,300
And now with Talescale, I don't have any inbound ports on any of my firewalls.

388
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:29,300
That's huge for me.

389
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:34,560
And I have it running on x86 arch servers, Raspberry Pi is running open, suits a tumbleweed.

390
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:37,120
I have it on my iPhone, my iPad, my next box.

391
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:40,480
I mean, everything you get up and running in just minutes, they have it for Windows

392
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,480
and Mac, of course.

393
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:43,460
I should probably make that statement, but it's obvious.

394
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:45,840
And they even have like binaries available for a Linux system.

395
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,960
Say you're on silver blue like I was and just want the binary.

396
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:50,160
They got that to devices.

397
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:51,160
Keep going.

398
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:53,800
And you know, the work with your existing identity provider as well.

399
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:56,880
So you can easily enforce multi-factor authentication.

400
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:02,380
Say if you're in a business and the fact that Talescale VPN is always on on every OS I use

401
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:06,600
and has a slick little GUI, including there's even a really nice gnome extension out there

402
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:08,560
to get the GUI in the gnome menu.

403
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:09,560
It's just dead simple.

404
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:11,020
It works every time.

405
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:16,600
It's super reliable and you're protected by WireGuard to go try it yourself for free and

406
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:17,600
support the show.

407
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:21,480
Go to talescale.com slash coder again.

408
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:26,960
That's talescale.com slash coder.

409
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,560
Well, I hate to say it, and I truly do mean this.

410
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:34,120
I really hate to say it, but it does seem like the tech hiring slowdown is starting.

411
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:39,840
Big tech layoffs and hiring freezes are prompting recession fears that are actually trickling

412
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:44,520
into other parts of the industry, according to an article at the Washington Post that

413
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:48,360
was I think it went live like on Friday or something of that extent.

414
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:51,600
And it captures a lot of the moves by the big tech industry.

415
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:56,640
Last week we found out that Microsoft has laid off a thousand staff.

416
00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:01,360
Microsoft has also halted hiring in the Windows team and the office divisions for May at least

417
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:02,360
and perhaps beyond.

418
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:03,360
We just don't know.

419
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:04,920
This is old information that just came out.

420
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:08,660
Intel has told employees it would not hire more staff in the PC chip division and it's

421
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:11,480
reevaluating company priorities.

422
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:16,320
Google has announced it is hiring more cautiously, saying, quote, it is time to be prudent.

423
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:23,240
Apple has announced that it is doing a hiring pause amongst, quote, economic uncertainty,

424
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:25,480
saying it's tapping the brakes.

425
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:32,080
Google is switching from a hiring slowdown to a complete hiring halt for at least two

426
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:38,280
weeks with a reevaluation how they're going to proceed for the rest of the year.

427
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:41,840
It's kind of all happening and I hate it.

428
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:45,200
I hate to see this and it's not it's not an emergency.

429
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:48,040
It's not like everything's crumbling.

430
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:51,820
But I think the analogy that people are hitting the brakes now, they're tapping the brakes

431
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:52,820
are still on the freeway.

432
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:55,680
We're still going down the freeway, but they're tapping the brakes and we're starting to see

433
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:56,680
a backup.

434
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:57,680
That's a bad analogy.

435
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:58,680
But you know what I mean?

436
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:00,600
So I think there's a couple of things going on here.

437
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:01,600
I apologize.

438
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:06,600
I forgot the name of the podcast I was listening to, but they had a pretty prominent VC on

439
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:07,600
there.

440
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:12,960
I think it was something and it was hilarious listening to this guy, Chris.

441
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:18,560
He could barely like withhold his glee because really the valuations were too high.

442
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:20,280
The salaries were too high, especially.

443
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:23,080
I'm talking your startups, right?

444
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:30,520
And you know, a lot of these companies don't make money, not even just the big boys, but

445
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:32,760
I think we're going to feel this first in the startups.

446
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:35,320
We're going to see a lot of calling there.

447
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:38,760
We're going to see far less generous compensation offers.

448
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:42,760
And I wouldn't be surprised if some of the bigger firms use these where you have to come

449
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:49,040
into the office as a way to get people to self basically sell fire right to quit.

450
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:52,880
And then they'll start reevaluating salaries, basically pulling them down at the higher

451
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:56,660
end, which is an interesting kind of dichotomy we have.

452
00:24:56,660 --> 00:25:01,360
We have like service industry workers, hospitality workers, their salaries are generally going

453
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:02,360
up.

454
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:08,560
And I just saw, you know, my buddy owns a pub and 17 bucks an hour for a dishwasher,

455
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:09,560
which was like crazy.

456
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:11,400
God, I almost want to do that.

457
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,400
Right.

458
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:16,160
But the high end is going to go down because honestly it was overheated, right?

459
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:22,760
These startups were throwing money like they're like it's going out of style and I can't get

460
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:23,760
over it.

461
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:24,760
Stress it enough.

462
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:28,440
They don't make money and they're not as honorable as Sun Microsystems.

463
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:31,300
So you know, we can't tolerate them not making money.

464
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:32,520
They have to fail.

465
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:36,400
I agree with your thesis to a degree.

466
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:43,680
I think if we were to continue to see an economic tightening, we were continued to see a hawkish

467
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:44,920
fed policy.

468
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:46,680
Yes, I think you're right.

469
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:53,280
You would see kind of this reckoning, a return to the mean, an actual return to values and

470
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:56,680
fundamentals that, you know, drive profits and revenue.

471
00:25:56,680 --> 00:26:03,600
And I have worked for a couple of VC funded companies, you know, in the mid hundreds to

472
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:06,360
few hundred to 700 employee range.

473
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:09,960
I bet anybody listening that has to knows exactly what I'm about to say is 100% true.

474
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:14,520
I saw so much money wasted, like it like stuff that when I ran my business, we would never

475
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:19,800
even consider because, you know, everything we bought was really carefully calculated.

476
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:25,360
But I mean, I just saw unbelievable expenses on all kinds of stuff, travel stuff and office

477
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:30,440
stuff and just things that they had groups of people working on that would never produced

478
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:31,440
a penny.

479
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:35,360
They just were complete 100% cost center and that kind of stuff.

480
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:36,600
We've just seen that.

481
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:41,880
We've seen that as like a like a sickness spread throughout American business culture.

482
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:47,560
I think anybody listening who works at a company with more than 100 people probably has something

483
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:52,280
that goes on at their business that is a 100% total cost center that doesn't produce anything

484
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:57,000
beneficial for the company, the kind of stuff that if you are life and death, you know,

485
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,560
just survive by every paycheck kind of thing you would never allow.

486
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:04,840
But when you've got money coming in, it sort of makes it easy to just kind of ignore that

487
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:09,560
stuff like the saying is that, you know, when the when the when the when the tide is in

488
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:12,760
and everybody's out swimming and having a great time, everybody looks like they're having

489
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:13,760
a party.

490
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:17,340
But when the tide goes out, when the when the money slows down, when the tide goes out,

491
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:19,800
you see who's been swimming without their shorts on.

492
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:23,000
And so I would agree with your thesis if we got that far.

493
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,640
I don't think we'll get that far.

494
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:28,720
I think the money printer will turn back on probably in November, somewhere between now

495
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:31,380
and November, but probably not right yet.

496
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:34,540
And when that happens, the money will get dumped back into the tech sector just like

497
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:35,540
it always has.

498
00:27:35,540 --> 00:27:38,480
Oh, oh, I hope not.

499
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:39,840
It'll be mega bubble time, buddy.

500
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:40,840
We've been printing money.

501
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:46,840
We have been on a financial bender since 2008 with maybe one or two moments of clarity in

502
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:47,840
there.

503
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:52,400
And fortunately, right, if you're an addict, you eventually have to go through the withdrawals.

504
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:54,160
It's it's time to go through the withdrawals.

505
00:27:54,160 --> 00:28:00,600
It's time to I mean, come on, look at these dumb businesses that were being started.

506
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:05,600
Look at how these companies that make no money have effectively D I would argue they devalue

507
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:11,760
actual like modestly profitable, you know, what could grow into from small to like medium

508
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:18,120
sized firms, because it's all growth, growth, growth, you know, IPO, whatever, turning a

509
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:19,120
profit.

510
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:20,120
What's the product?

511
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:23,560
Remember Silicon Valley action, Jack Barker talking to Richard Hendricks, I will never

512
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:25,160
compromise the product, Richard.

513
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:26,720
And he's like, Oh, the algorithm?

514
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:27,720
No, you idiot.

515
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:28,720
The stock.

516
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:31,680
It's like, it's crazy.

517
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:32,720
It's all effectively.

518
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:36,220
And I know you love crypto, but it's all effectively like a securities.

519
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:37,220
It's a casino.

520
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:38,220
Basically.

521
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:39,220
Oh, crypto securities?

522
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:40,220
Yeah, absolutely.

523
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:41,220
Well, not just crypto.

524
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:43,280
The stock in these startups.

525
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:44,640
What's is what's the difference?

526
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:45,640
Why not call it?

527
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:46,640
You know,

528
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:47,860
well, the two are related, right?

529
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:52,860
The reason why you've seen crypto and NFTs just go crazy is because they're securities

530
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:54,820
that Wall Street guys are playing around with that.

531
00:28:54,820 --> 00:28:59,400
The money that's been pouring into crypto isn't coming from Wall Street bets, a sub

532
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:00,400
Reddit, right?

533
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:01,400
Like, yeah, a handful of it is.

534
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:05,620
But they're a drop in the bucket compared to the billions on Wall Street that are screwing

535
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:07,700
around with off the book securities.

536
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:08,700
I completely agree.

537
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:11,280
Have you ever hang out at Wall Street bets?

538
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:13,160
Yeah, I've been in there a couple of times.

539
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:14,920
I mean, like literally twice.

540
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:16,440
Have you noticed over the last month?

541
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:19,520
I read my some my Reddit feed now and I tend to read.

542
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:20,520
I don't know.

543
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:22,200
I've somehow been drawn to read it again.

544
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:24,240
But I never comment because Oh my god.

545
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,600
Yeah, good call.

546
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:31,160
A lot of it is like less, you know, diamond hands to the moon, bake this, you know, we're

547
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:33,600
the apes, whatever the hell that means.

548
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:37,640
And now it's like, I just lost $20,000 and my wife is divorcing me.

549
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:38,640
Yeah.

550
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:39,640
Yeah.

551
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:40,640
There's a lot of that right now.

552
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:41,640
A lot of that going on.

553
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:46,560
It's like, yeah, well, do you like you were only doing well, because, again, I'm gonna

554
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:47,880
say it.

555
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:50,220
The Fed had everybody on a frickin bender.

556
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:54,200
And I think right now people just haven't really fully realized it yet, because it's

557
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:59,240
been so normalized, because it's been happening in the background for so long.

558
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:01,580
I don't think it's totally clicked yet.

559
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:06,480
I don't think people have made the connection to the state of employment, the state of the

560
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:09,120
tech industry and the money printer.

561
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:11,320
I think they're just too distant for most people.

562
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:13,680
See, this is the problem.

563
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:20,200
The tech industry, I feel like in a lot of ways is going through some sort of transition.

564
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:22,360
I know this is welcome to old man radio.

565
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:28,480
When we started the show, it was all about like, crazy ideas, you know, mobile, mobile,

566
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:32,680
mobile, rapid product of rapid, you know, MVP is we talked a lot quick break things

567
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:36,280
a lot about agile, right in different forms of that.

568
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:43,760
And now it seems like tech and media are like in this weird or serpentine, polyamorous orgy

569
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:45,240
with politics.

570
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:50,200
Well, all of the tech companies wanted to become media stars and media platforms.

571
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:52,040
All the media companies want to become tech companies.

572
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:53,040
It's great.

573
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:54,040
Yeah, everybody.

574
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:58,920
They all want to be streaming platforms, or they all want to be media.

575
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:03,280
Nobody realized that the only reason they're at this crazy college party at the scrap party

576
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:07,360
is because, you know, Pledgemaster Fed was just bringing the kegs in.

577
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:08,360
Let's go.

578
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:09,360
Let me tell you something.

579
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:11,400
As a man, I think you can.

580
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:13,680
I think Chris will go with this, Chris.

581
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:17,480
If you had to ask me to identify a bender, if you had to pick of all the hosts, who could

582
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:19,480
identify a bender when he sees one?

583
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:20,480
It's got to be me.

584
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:21,480
Oh, I think so.

585
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:22,480
Yeah, I would.

586
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:23,480
I would agree.

587
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:26,400
I think we've been on a what is it, 14 year bender.

588
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,720
It's time to stop.

589
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:30,880
It's time to you know, there's going to be some vomiting.

590
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:35,800
There's definitely going to be some tragic cases of startup founders losing everything,

591
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:37,880
but you never had it.

592
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:38,880
It was a lie.

593
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:42,040
So yeah, but it's a yeah, but it's a little bit different when it's like, say, you and

594
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:43,040
me.

595
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:44,040
Right.

596
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:47,060
If like, if this thing, if this thing gets really rolling, it's probably going to wipe

597
00:31:47,060 --> 00:31:51,440
out the advertising market and it may wipe out people's appetite for development projects

598
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:52,440
as well.

599
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:54,800
Well, it's going to yeah, everybody's going to get hit.

600
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:56,420
It's but what's the alternative?

601
00:31:56,420 --> 00:31:57,820
We just keep going.

602
00:31:57,820 --> 00:31:59,080
That's exactly what they're going to do.

603
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:00,080
Yeah.

604
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:01,800
I mean, you can't do this forever.

605
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:02,800
Nope.

606
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:06,840
But, you know, he could probably do it for another cycle.

607
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:08,160
Our sons will get to fix it, right?

608
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:09,160
Our kids will get.

609
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:11,680
Oh, I think it's going to bite us.

610
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:14,440
Oh, I think we'll be around for it.

611
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:16,680
There's a lot of moving pieces to something like this.

612
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:24,200
But at the end of the day, the Fed policy is to make changes to their policy that increase

613
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:25,200
unemployment.

614
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:29,240
The idea being that if you increase unemployment, you'll reduce demand.

615
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:31,160
You'll cool the market.

616
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:34,680
That should have a lowering effect on inflation.

617
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:39,360
I know this is this is this is a long way removed from development.

618
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:42,460
And you're probably wondering how it all kind of connects together.

619
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:45,240
The way it all connects together, what Mike and I are trying to tell you with this entire

620
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:51,480
discussion has been about is this is directly connected to the health of the tech industry.

621
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:54,400
It is directly connected to the employment market.

622
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:57,960
It is directly connected to the indie business market.

623
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:00,080
It is a one for one thing.

624
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:04,240
Whatever the Fed policy changes, it directly impacts the tech market directly because this

625
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:12,720
tech market has thrived during a period of loose economic policy, loose money, easy money,

626
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:14,440
better than free money, really.

627
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:17,760
So that's changed for now.

628
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:22,560
And as long as it stays in this state, the tech industry will take more and more hits.

629
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:24,320
The health will deteriorate.

630
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:26,260
I imagine it's not forever, though.

631
00:33:26,260 --> 00:33:31,500
But that's how this all kind of comes back together is it is directly correlated.

632
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:36,320
When you hear about the Fed hiking rates, that makes money more expensive for these

633
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:38,320
companies that operate off of loans.

634
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:42,160
I mean, you hear about how Apple has so much money in the bank, right?

635
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:44,780
They just sitting on tons of money, like two trillion dollars.

636
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:48,520
They legit they decided to become a credit card company because they didn't know what

637
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:49,520
to do with it.

638
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:51,200
And now they're a buy now pay later.

639
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:56,560
How did Apple manage to run operating expenses while putting all of their money in an offshore

640
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:57,980
savings account?

641
00:33:57,980 --> 00:33:59,280
How do they do that?

642
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:02,500
They take loans because they have a guaranteed collateral.

643
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:04,120
They have that balance.

644
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:07,060
They can take out loans like crazy against it.

645
00:34:07,060 --> 00:34:12,480
They get access to loans in a way that average people like us just can't even comprehend.

646
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:13,640
You know, you want a few bill.

647
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:14,640
Here you go.

648
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:15,640
Here's a line of credit.

649
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:16,640
Apple, here's a few billion line of credit.

650
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:18,000
No problem at all.

651
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:23,960
And when the interest rates are lower than inflation, it tends to work out better for

652
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:25,800
a company like Apple to take a loan out.

653
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:26,800
And that's what they've been doing.

654
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,840
They've been getting access to easy money like that.

655
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:30,960
And that easy money is going away.

656
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:32,960
That's just it right there.

657
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:35,680
The loans cost more now because the base rates are going up.

658
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:36,680
Yeah.

659
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:41,600
But on a positive note, if you are a you know, someone looking to be an entrepreneur, I hate

660
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:45,040
to say it, but particularly if you're young and don't have things like kids, dogs and

661
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:51,520
mortgages, this type of environment, a crash is always a great time to start up.

662
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:56,760
Not like in the VC way, but it's it still will be possible, of course.

663
00:34:56,760 --> 00:35:02,140
But there will be opportunities coming from don't forget, we are still experiencing changing

664
00:35:02,140 --> 00:35:03,880
dynamics of remote work.

665
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:07,280
Covid apparently decides it wants to visit again.

666
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:09,400
And something about somebody slept with a monkey.

667
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:14,640
I don't know what the hell happened there, but probably a BSD user.

668
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:19,200
So if you want to create, you know, the next.

669
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:24,320
Just please don't create Uber for something right, but some interesting technology product

670
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:29,480
that maybe works with these trends that you can bootstrap.

671
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:32,000
This is still a pretty good time.

672
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:36,240
If you focus on where things are transitioning to, because I don't I don't know what Chris

673
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:38,720
thinks, but I don't think we're done with our Covid hangover.

674
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:40,640
Yeah, seemingly not.

675
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:46,160
At least we have the Provo lax or whatever it is that the plies are elected.

676
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:47,720
At least we have that now.

677
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:49,440
So hopefully that's helping people.

678
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:51,080
But I think you're totes right.

679
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:56,200
Like these types of markets are a time to build and invest.

680
00:35:56,200 --> 00:36:00,480
And then when the market turns around, you want to be in a position to catch that wave.

681
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:04,440
And the only way you're going to be ready is if you've been building something, creating

682
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:08,720
a bit of credibility, creating a bit of network effect around it.

683
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:12,960
And then when things pick back up and there's market demand again and people are looking

684
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:16,360
for the solution that you've created, you're there for it.

685
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:21,800
These types of downturns that we're in right now can be beneficially life changing for

686
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:25,620
a career trajectory or for somebody that wants to start an independent business and has the

687
00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:30,000
ability to hunker down, survive and weather the storm.

688
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,000
The next wave.

689
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,000
Yeah.

690
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,000
Yeah.

691
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,000
Right.

692
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,520
And also when these things tend to happen, there's still markets amazingly that do all

693
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:38,760
right and are still hiring.

694
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:42,860
And so it's just a matter about finding those places and even some regions still end up

695
00:36:42,860 --> 00:36:44,960
doing better than other regions as well.

696
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:47,160
So it's not all a bad thing.

697
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:51,200
And I think maybe that's the part we could focus on a bit more is these are actually

698
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:52,920
great valleys of opportunity.

699
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:56,920
And when you start to look at it as a moment of opportunity.

700
00:36:56,920 --> 00:37:00,160
You start to think, God, I hope I hope the down market lasts long enough.

701
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:01,160
I hope I have enough time.

702
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:02,160
Right.

703
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:03,160
You start to.

704
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:06,680
It changes your mindset about it instead of like, oh, God, here we go.

705
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:08,480
How long is this going to take?

706
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:11,400
Oh, I'm bracing myself instead of that.

707
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:14,000
It's a oh, I hope it's a down market the last while.

708
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,320
I hope I hope I have enough time to build this thing.

709
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:17,320
Right.

710
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:20,440
That's actually, you know, a nice mindset shift.

711
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:22,600
It helps you get through it.

712
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:25,560
But Chris is probably right because we live in a cynical world and there's an election

713
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:26,560
coming up.

714
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:32,200
So the Fed will probably start putting money again here.

715
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:36,120
Just not what your podcast can boost for you.

716
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:39,400
But what you can boost for your podcast.

717
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:40,400
Boostagray.

718
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:41,400
All right.

719
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:42,800
Well, we got some boost this week.

720
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:46,480
Optimus Gray boosted in with a big one.

721
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:49,240
He is coming in with a big row of ducks.

722
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:52,400
Twenty two thousand two hundred and twenty two sets.

723
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:59,980
Now, he was listening live and was just enjoying the show.

724
00:37:59,980 --> 00:38:04,680
We stream over at Jupiter Dot Tube on Mondays at noon, Pacific three p.m.

725
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:05,680
Eastern.

726
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:11,680
We're not yet live in the podcast apps, but that is part of the podcasting to do spec

727
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:14,560
is the ability to actually live stream in the podcast app.

728
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:19,920
So you just subscribe to Kota Radio and when we're live, it'll just show up in your podcast

729
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:24,520
player as a live item that you could just listen to, tap it and just tune into the stream.

730
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:29,040
And then when the stream is over, it goes away and then the actual edited version takes

731
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,040
over and replaces it.

732
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:32,440
It's a pretty neat system.

733
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:34,280
So we'll be there one day.

734
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:38,760
But we're not there yet because step one is getting to the point where we're satisfied

735
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:44,800
with creating and generating our own RSS feeds, which we're just kind of at the beginning

736
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,600
of that.

737
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:52,400
Next boost comes in from Yukon Cornelius with two thousand sets.

738
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:57,080
I'm curious to know if the GitHub Copilot models make their way individual studios,

739
00:38:57,080 --> 00:39:00,120
A.I. autocomplete, what do they call that, Intellisense?

740
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:02,600
I've used V.S. one at work.

741
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:06,520
It supposedly scans my code base to provide the recommendations.

742
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:10,080
No mention of scanning GitHub, though it seems to be true.

743
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:14,440
The Visual Studio recommendations often seem like they were coded by me.

744
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:17,920
I found the feature actually saves me a ton of time.

745
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:24,800
Visual Studio offers a custom version of Copilot that scans your own code for the training

746
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:25,800
model.

747
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:27,600
Saves him a ton of time, he says.

748
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:34,400
The Copilot and V.S. code also does that in addition to whatever external sources it scans.

749
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,880
Have you found that useful?

750
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:36,880
As a form of autocomplete?

751
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:37,880
Yeah.

752
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:41,240
I mean, I tend to use the same patterns over and over again because I'm old and you will

753
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:44,640
pry my delegate pattern out of my cold dead hands.

754
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:46,120
I use what works.

755
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:47,840
Me and Deckard Cain were there.

756
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:48,840
No, it's useful.

757
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:55,720
I mean, the thing about Copilot is it's basically better Intellisense, but when it's wrong,

758
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:57,760
it's freaking hilarious.

759
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:02,760
The Golden Dragon boosted in with a gigabyte of sats, 1024.

760
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:05,440
Holy crap, that's too much sats.

761
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:12,680
He says, Mike, you need to go grab yourself some Microsoft tactical wear.

762
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:14,240
I don't know if you saw this.

763
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:15,240
Tactical?

764
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:21,920
Yeah, they've launched the hardware division designed by one of Microsoft's creative directors,

765
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:29,720
and it's like super retro cheesy Microsoft swag, including pants that cost like $150

766
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:30,720
cargo pants.

767
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:31,720
No, that's not going to happen.

768
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:34,080
I mean, they've got a little Microsoft logo on there, man.

769
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:35,080
Don't you want it?

770
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:36,080
Come on.

771
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:37,560
Actually, they look really comfortable.

772
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:38,560
I'm not going to lie.

773
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:41,040
They're not like standard CACULA, like a different material.

774
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:42,920
They're $150 pants, Chris.

775
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:43,920
I know.

776
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:44,920
I know.

777
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:45,920
I know.

778
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:47,080
But they're tactical pants, man.

779
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:48,080
They're tactical pants.

780
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:50,480
Don't you go spending our rope budget.

781
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:52,320
All right.

782
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:53,320
You're right.

783
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:54,320
No, you're right.

784
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:55,320
You're right.

785
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:56,320
You're right.

786
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:57,320
All right.

787
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:58,320
I'll simmer down.

788
00:40:58,320 --> 00:40:59,320
I'll simmer down.

789
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:00,320
We got a double boost from the Golden Dragon.

790
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:03,740
He sent us in a little small row of ducks saying that things had him feel a little awkward

791
00:41:03,740 --> 00:41:08,160
at episode 475, like maybe we were getting a little Linux betrayal-y when we were talking

792
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:10,720
about how you could use Windows, Mac, or Linux these days.

793
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:12,200
He didn't like it too much.

794
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:17,000
So to make up for it, he sent us a triple boost with another row of small ducks.

795
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:21,120
Honestly and truly, I am Robin Hood.

796
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:27,320
Now he's bringing up the whole east and north and south, the Carolina thing.

797
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:30,920
I hate to get into the Carolina barbecue thing again, but he's doing it, so we're going in

798
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:31,920
there.

799
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:33,120
I feel like we don't have a choice.

800
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:35,760
It's vinegar-based sauce, guys.

801
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:39,320
It's a kind of waste nothing but the squeal type approach.

802
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:40,320
It was trendy.

803
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:44,400
Oh, when you add it to your meat, it can make it super tender and juicy.

804
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:45,680
All right.

805
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:46,680
I don't know, man.

806
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:50,680
If I'm going to rely on a sauce, I feel like it's maybe not great barbecue.

807
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:51,680
That's just my thing.

808
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:56,560
Like the barbecue, you should be able to eat it without sauce, and then if you add sauce,

809
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:57,560
it makes it better.

810
00:41:57,560 --> 00:42:00,160
You're just throwing down like that?

811
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:05,840
Dude, send your feedback to chris at jupiterbroadcasting.com.

812
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:07,000
I'm just saying.

813
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,000
I'm just saying.

814
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,160
If you disagree, boost in.

815
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:10,160
We'll make it work out.

816
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:11,160
We'll figure it out.

817
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:12,160
You're a bad man.

818
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:14,640
That's some bold stuff you've got going there.

819
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:15,640
I know.

820
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:16,640
It offends people.

821
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:21,560
Oh, a guy sent us in a multi-part boost, 444 cents.

822
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:23,720
I think you guys should check this out.

823
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:29,200
It's an article by the New Yorker, Mario not so super at 40.

824
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:32,320
It's probably, he says in the second part boost, best read in Mario's voice.

825
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:33,960
It's a me, a Mario.

826
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:38,560
And the whole thing is an article written in Mario's voice.

827
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:43,160
And it hits a little close to home about how life's harder for Mario at 40.

828
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:48,880
Like things like, so basically I wake up and it's like, I can't move my back, like at all.

829
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:53,880
So I go to Dr. Mario, no relation, and he's like, Mario, when's the last time you had

830
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:54,880
a physical?

831
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:58,420
And I'm like, can't you just look at my back like a normal?

832
00:42:58,420 --> 00:43:00,280
And he's like, no, no.

833
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:03,180
I'm starting to think there might be an underlying problem.

834
00:43:03,180 --> 00:43:06,160
And it just, the whole thing goes on.

835
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:08,040
It's about life at 40.

836
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:10,880
And I'll leave it for you to read.

837
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:14,600
I'll have it linked in the show notes, thanks OA guy.

838
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:17,000
Nothing like that to make me feel old.

839
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,600
He did send us a double boost though.

840
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:21,520
Another row of duckos, boost.

841
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:25,280
He says, still prefers Vim over TextMate and BB Edit.

842
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:26,280
Very good.

843
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:32,920
We got 3,737 stats from TrevDev, and he says, in regards to comments last week we made about

844
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:36,320
using Windows, Mac and Linux being fairly interchangeable, he says, I'd like to gently

845
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:41,840
remind you both that the three distros, Windows, Mac and Linux, are not really on equal footing.

846
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:45,800
Linux is clearly superior, and it doesn't come with the bloat of Windows.

847
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:48,200
Embrace, extend, and extinguish.

848
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:50,440
We are currently at the extend phase.

849
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:53,000
WSL is the extend phase.

850
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:56,260
Does that mean extinguish is like the next phase that Linux is gonna die?

851
00:43:56,260 --> 00:43:57,260
Is that what you mean?

852
00:43:57,260 --> 00:43:59,560
I'm pretty sure Linode is like, eh, I don't think so.

853
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:06,000
Yeah, TrevDev, I'm curious if you think that Windows could actually extinguish Linux, because

854
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,000
it just doesn't seem possible.

855
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:13,440
As long as you're gonna have any kind of substantial server market, it's gonna be beneficial to

856
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:16,240
have the desktop around in some capacity, right?

857
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:20,800
I mean, you gotta have a dev platform, you gotta have a test platform, so I think as

858
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:25,200
long as you have a substantial server deployment, I think you're always gonna have a Linux desktop

859
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:26,320
of some form.

860
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:28,880
I don't know if it'll be the king desktop, but I think it'll always be around, but I'm

861
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:34,320
curious to know, TrevDev, if you think they actually could extinguish Linux altogether.

862
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:38,120
LRAI 7.41 boosted in with 2,245 SATs.

863
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:39,120
Boost!

864
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:42,880
He actually has a correction on my comment about how JB is using Cloudflare.

865
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:47,520
He says, I only know because I've been helping with the new website that's under development,

866
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:50,760
and he says, you're not really using any of the fancy features of Cloudflare like Mike

867
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:51,760
was actually talking about.

868
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:53,200
You're just using it for DNS.

869
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:57,200
Yeah, I know, but we could turn that stuff on.

870
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:59,840
But it's a hell of a DNS provider.

871
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:00,840
It sure is.

872
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:01,840
It sure is.

873
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:03,080
I actually have liked it.

874
00:45:03,080 --> 00:45:04,560
I didn't want to.

875
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:05,560
I was very resistive.

876
00:45:05,560 --> 00:45:06,560
Why?

877
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:08,040
What's your beef with Cloudflare?

878
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:11,440
I think they want to be like the Walmart of network services.

879
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:15,400
I mean, I don't mean that in a bad way, but I just mean that like in a huge market dominator

880
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:16,400
way.

881
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:21,320
Well, yeah, we need to get to where there's only one company named Mom, right?

882
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:22,320
That's exactly it.

883
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:23,320
Isn't that what we're doing here?

884
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:24,320
We are.

885
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:25,320
That is exactly what's happening.

886
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:26,320
That was my only hesitation.

887
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:29,200
I think you get it, right?

888
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:30,200
It's just a little concerning.

889
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:31,680
I feel like I've seen this before.

890
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:33,840
Yeah, you're probably right.

891
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:38,240
That's a future rival reference for for the Gen Z-ers in the crowd.

892
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:39,240
It's good.

893
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:40,240
We watch holds up.

894
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:41,240
It does hold up.

895
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:43,300
It's a little too close to home on certain episodes, though.

896
00:45:43,300 --> 00:45:44,300
No kidding.

897
00:45:44,300 --> 00:45:45,300
You should.

898
00:45:45,300 --> 00:45:46,300
You should.

899
00:45:46,300 --> 00:45:48,960
You should watch it with a post covid eye.

900
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:52,440
Double boost from Ellery 741.

901
00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:54,360
Just checking out Podverse.

902
00:45:54,360 --> 00:45:55,640
Thanks for the awesome show.

903
00:45:55,640 --> 00:46:00,360
So Podverse, just a quick tangent here, Podverse is one of these new apps, these new podcasting

904
00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:01,360
apps that are pretty great.

905
00:46:01,360 --> 00:46:06,200
They've got an iOS, an Android and a Web version, and it's all open source.

906
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:08,360
But here's what's really cool.

907
00:46:08,360 --> 00:46:13,160
So I interviewed the developer, one of the developers, the co-founder for office hours.

908
00:46:13,160 --> 00:46:18,020
And then after he came on office hours, he agreed to help us out with the new website

909
00:46:18,020 --> 00:46:19,360
that we're working on.

910
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:26,320
And so now our embedded player on our new website is the Podverse MP3 player.

911
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:31,560
We've gotten they worked with us to make their web player that they have embeddable and that

912
00:46:31,560 --> 00:46:33,480
it can point at our own files.

913
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:37,960
And so when the new website launches, we're going to have a Podverse player that has like

914
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:44,240
chapter support and playback speed support, boost support all right there built into the

915
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:46,840
web player, open source, GPL, baby.

916
00:46:46,840 --> 00:46:51,440
And Mitch at Podverse has been helping us out with a new website to make it all possible.

917
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:53,280
And he loves Coderio so much.

918
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:55,200
He included it twice in his directory.

919
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:56,880
There you go.

920
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:57,880
You know what?

921
00:46:57,880 --> 00:46:58,880
Let's get it in there a third time.

922
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:01,120
Oh, you know what that is?

923
00:47:01,120 --> 00:47:03,480
I know that beautiful old artwork.

924
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:04,480
What is it?

925
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:05,480
What did you find?

926
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:06,480
That's the old member.

927
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:08,200
We have changed feeds way back when.

928
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:09,200
Oh, yeah, yeah.

929
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:10,200
That's what that is.

930
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:11,200
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

931
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:12,200
Because it is.

932
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:13,200
Yeah.

933
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:14,200
2017 feed update.

934
00:47:14,200 --> 00:47:15,200
That's what that is.

935
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:16,200
Good old days.

936
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:17,200
The old feed.

937
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:18,200
The old logo.

938
00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:19,200
You know, I don't mind the old logo.

939
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:20,200
I like the old logo.

940
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:22,120
We never did new coasters for the new logo.

941
00:47:22,120 --> 00:47:23,120
We should.

942
00:47:23,120 --> 00:47:26,720
We should do it, too, but I just, you know, the old logo I remember thinking when we were

943
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:30,440
trying to figure out looks like how the hell do you even the show had launched yet?

944
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:36,120
Like, how the hell do you even visualize the show like we can't just have like HTML code

945
00:47:36,120 --> 00:47:37,120
or something.

946
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:42,280
And now if we did a logo, it would just be a MacBook with a bottle of gin poured into

947
00:47:42,280 --> 00:47:43,280
it.

948
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:44,280
Amazing.

949
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:46,880
If you want to check out Podverse, it's like Podverse dot FM.

950
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:49,040
It's one of the apps at new podcast apps dot com.

951
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:54,000
And it's neat because it's because it's GPL, it's also an asteroid if that's how you roll.

952
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:57,480
And then we did get a series of thank you boosts.

953
00:47:57,480 --> 00:47:59,040
Five thousand sats from L.T.

954
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:02,840
Guy for episode four seventy five and then an additional five thousand sats from L.T.

955
00:48:02,840 --> 00:48:06,400
Guy of double five for episode four seventy four.

956
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:08,040
We got some lead sats from A.V.

957
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:12,040
Parker and we got some future sats for seventy six from K.P.

958
00:48:12,040 --> 00:48:13,040
Vuck.

959
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:15,320
Thank you, K.P. for boosting the future.

960
00:48:15,320 --> 00:48:17,920
If you'd like to send us a boost, you could try out Fountain FM.

961
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:21,320
I'll have a link in the show notes, which is like my link.

962
00:48:21,320 --> 00:48:26,200
I think it connects you to my account so you can see my clips and that kind of stuff.

963
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:30,620
But you can just also grab any any of the new podcast apps that look interesting to

964
00:48:30,620 --> 00:48:32,700
you at new podcast apps dot com.

965
00:48:32,700 --> 00:48:34,040
And one more note.

966
00:48:34,040 --> 00:48:37,840
I was on the podcasting two dot o podcast.

967
00:48:37,840 --> 00:48:39,860
I think it's episode ninety four.

968
00:48:39,860 --> 00:48:41,600
And we talked about the podcast biz.

969
00:48:41,600 --> 00:48:42,780
We talked about advertising.

970
00:48:42,780 --> 00:48:43,940
We talked about memberships.

971
00:48:43,940 --> 00:48:47,840
We talked about standards and Spotify and all kinds of things.

972
00:48:47,840 --> 00:48:49,480
Those are actually a really fun chat.

973
00:48:49,480 --> 00:48:54,760
So if you're interested in that kind of stuff, go check out the podcasting two dot o podcast.

974
00:48:54,760 --> 00:49:00,080
I think it's episode ninety four titled Bell's out is the episode I'm on.

975
00:49:00,080 --> 00:49:01,720
I got good news for our members.

976
00:49:01,720 --> 00:49:06,360
The new Coderly report is out to do to do to do.

977
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:11,700
It took me a little bit longer than normal because I was slammed recently, but it turned

978
00:49:11,700 --> 00:49:12,700
out really good.

979
00:49:12,700 --> 00:49:15,820
This is one I think it's worth becoming a member for if you're not already.

980
00:49:15,820 --> 00:49:20,460
We did a little look back at like twenty fourteen, twenty fifteen early days of the show and

981
00:49:20,460 --> 00:49:24,120
replayed some moments where we kind of talked about issues at the time and then we reflect

982
00:49:24,120 --> 00:49:28,720
on them now or some predictions we made, one that I got massively wrong and a couple that

983
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:29,720
we got right.

984
00:49:29,720 --> 00:49:32,680
But we it was just it was more fun than I was expecting.

985
00:49:32,680 --> 00:49:36,840
Thanks to Alex, too, for for clipping a lot of those and tweeting them at us.

986
00:49:36,840 --> 00:49:39,680
So we had a good batch to go through from the past because he's been going through the

987
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:40,960
back archive.

988
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:44,740
So the timing just worked out good and I thought it turned out really well.

989
00:49:44,740 --> 00:49:45,860
So it's a new Coderly.

990
00:49:45,860 --> 00:49:48,400
It is live now in your members feed.

991
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:53,280
Or if you're subscribed to the public feed, you can also just go to your member full dashboard

992
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:56,600
and you can download it directly and just play it if you like.

993
00:49:56,600 --> 00:50:00,280
And if you want to become a member and you're not one yet, Coder QA dot co become one of

994
00:50:00,280 --> 00:50:01,920
our QA members.

You get access to every every Coderly so you get all the previous ones to you support the

996
00:50:06,520 --> 00:50:12,960
show and you get an ad free version of the feed so you get all the Drew's nice hard work

997
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:17,920
but without the advertisements in it, you know, for your preferences.

998
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:18,920
