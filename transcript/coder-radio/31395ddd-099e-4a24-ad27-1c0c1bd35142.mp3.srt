00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
This is KOTORadio episode 378 for September 7th, 2020.

2
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Hello friends and welcome to Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show, taking a pragmatic look at the art and business, software development, and the world of technology.

3
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:47,000
This episode is brought to you by a Cloud Guru, the leader in hands-on cloud training. The only way to lock in a new skill is by doing.

4
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:55,000
That's why ACG provides hands-on labs, cloud Linux servers, and much more. Get your hands cloudy at acloudguru.com.

5
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:03,000
My name is Chris and joining us every week is our host from the other coast. It's Mr. Jar, I mean, Mr. Michael Dominic. Hello, Mike.

6
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
What's up? So happy to be here.

7
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Wait, that was Mario.

8
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:13,000
You know what? I've sometimes thought your Jar Jar is a little Mario, which I kind of prefer. I got to be honest, doesn't trigger me as much.

9
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Is it because I'm Italian, you racist fiend? Is that why?

10
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Yeah, obviously, clearly. It's not because you just sound exactly like him.

11
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Couldn't be.

12
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I'm super elated to be here today because we had a terrific response to the Coder QA team. Thank you everybody who went to coderqa.co and became a member.

13
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:40,000
We'll talk more about that in a little bit. But the other thing that's really exciting is we managed to get Wes for today's episode, mostly because we struck him on a day off.

14
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
And so he had no excuse. Hello, Wes.

15
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Hello. Yeah, I mean, what could be better on Labor Day than a little bit of labor of love? Coder Radio.

16
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I know. This right here is documented proof that Mike and I are still not great small business time management guys because here we are working on Labor Day.

17
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
And if we really had it together, we probably wouldn't be.

18
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Your machines.

19
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Yeah, that's what it is.

20
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:07,000
You just never stop working, which you're right. It's not good for the family or the health, but maybe the bottom line.

21
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
What's a Monday when you've already worked a Sunday?

22
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I am like on cloud nine today because Linux Action News is back and everybody's freaking out. They're loving it. Episode 153 Linux Action News dot com slash 153.

23
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:30,000
If you want to stay up to date on what's going on in the world of Linux and open source, if it impacts your career or if it benefits you to stay informed, just check out Linux Action News dot com because you get it in like 30 minutes or less.

24
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Just a nice tight summary.

25
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:39,000
And Joe and I have been following this stuff forever, so we've got some insights and contacts we can reach on to inform our opinions.

26
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:44,000
And I'm really proud of it. Linux Action News dot com slash 153. It's back.

27
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
You know, a product launch is a big deal.

28
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
You know, it's like it's that's like that's our version of a product launch right there.

29
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Exciting, stressful.

30
00:02:53,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Finally, I can stop keeping up on the Linux News myself and just let you and Joe take care of it.

31
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Yeah, exactly. Yeah.

32
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Wes really has this time management thing down. He's delegating. I like it.

33
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Yeah. I mean, it's smart, right? Outsource your news collection.

34
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Now, we do have a little bit of feedback to get to. Coder dot show slash contact.

35
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Joey wrote into the show about freeloading enterprise users.

36
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
So get your flame retardant pants on, gentlemen, and let's answer this question.

37
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Also, I like that I think Joey is maybe a new listener or messed this one up because it's, quote, Hi, Chris, Wes and pain.

38
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
You know, if we change the spelling, it might just be derogatory about old Mike over there.

39
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Yeah, maybe it's just, you know, P-A-I-N, right? Thanks, man.

40
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
OK, that kind of works pain in my Georgia. That's right.

41
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:49,000
He says, I wanted to bring your attention to a topic that I'm confident will be interesting for your audience and you guys to talk about.

42
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Recently, there has been a big move by large industry players, including Microsoft, to stand behind open source, quote unquote.

43
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,000
However, one of the overlooked aspects is the fact that these open source developers are not paid for their work.

44
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:07,000
And often software companies take their open source work and repackage it and sell it for millions.

45
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:15,000
How can this be sustainable? And won't these projects just eventually be taken over by the large companies like Microsoft and Amazon?

46
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Do you have a hot take on that, Mike?

47
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:24,000
So I'm a little confused by that, to be honest. There's a lot of contribution in terms of money going on.

48
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,000
And isn't it the case that like Microsoft now employs a bunch of people who work on Linux?

49
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Yeah, I think, you know, what they're probably what Joey's probably referring to is, Wes, maybe you can help me jog my memory, but there's been a couple of database projects recently in the last two years.

50
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Like Mongo?

51
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Yeah, that's one that have that have really struggled with companies like Amazon or Microsoft repackaging it up or essentially ripping off,

52
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:55,000
reimplementing and making millions and not financially contributing to the project.

53
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I think and those projects have been fairly vocal about it. So that's probably where Joey's getting this from.

54
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I kind of see part of where it's coming from.

55
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Yeah. Well, I think there's multiple things here.

56
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Like there's open source in the sense of the license and then there's like open source in the sense of community and like individual project maintainers and owners.

57
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:18,000
And maybe there's more and more of a trend where your open source project gets successful.

58
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Either you start a small business that you try to build and then you run into problems because Amazon wants to sell your stuff to a larger scale than you ever could.

59
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Or you just end up hired by one of these giant companies and keep working on your project.

60
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:38,000
And do either of those really fully count as the thing that maybe Joey's getting to around the spirit of open source?

61
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I guess the part that I could see where it's unsustainable is if these products so overshadow the original product or project,

62
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
it may be hard for them to get talent to work on it.

63
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,000
And then they could sort of shrivel, I suppose.

64
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
But this is what I go back to.

65
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:04,000
This, A, isn't a new problem and, B, hasn't really been fully solved for any particular slice of the market.

66
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
But when you go back in time, this has really kind of been going on forever.

67
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,000
It is a little more pronounced now because of the scale, I think, of cloud services.

68
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:23,000
But large enterprise companies ripping off entire sections of open source stacks and then implementing them under the scenes and not telling you about it or not having to release the license depending on the project is super common.

69
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
It's a practice that already happens.

70
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:31,000
And I think a lot of developers that are working in this space probably already know that before they even get started, that it's a reality.

71
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Is the problem the creators of the projects not being able to make money?

72
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,000
And just because I'm contractually obligated, I have to mention Sun and Java at least once a month.

73
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Yeah.

74
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:45,000
So it's a problem that West makes some open source project and then Oracle comes in and is like, great job, West.

75
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Thanks for the BSD license.

76
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
We're just going to commercialize this.

77
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Have some cake.

78
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
In part, that's part of it.

79
00:06:51,000 --> 00:07:04,000
And then I think where it's really kind of the double whammy is if one of these projects decides, you know what we're going to do is we're going to offer our own hosted version of our project fully managed for a service fee.

80
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,000
And then AWS comes along and offers the same thing as part of AWS.

81
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
For pennies on the dollar, Chris on Amazon.

82
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Yeah.

83
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Got it.

84
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
And then it's like a double whammy at that point.

85
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:18,000
And that is like, boy, that's hard because that was their revenue path to sustainability.

86
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
And that's clearly been eclipsed.

87
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
But at the same time, it's sort of the way the market works.

88
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
And when you make something for free, somebody can take it and build on top of it.

89
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I think there's a solution for this.

90
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
There's this new technology.

91
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
A guy who comes to my user group, his name is Bill.

92
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
He calls it.

93
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:41,000
He wrote a letter to the hobbyist something about stealing software or like, I don't proprietary.

94
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Is that a word?

95
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Yeah.

96
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
You know, we ought to try as a shareware model.

97
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Oh, yeah.

98
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Let's bring on the three point five inch floppies.

99
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Let's do it.

100
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Yeah.

101
00:07:50,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Speaking of your friends who come and hang out at groups and and their buddies with Bill, Tim Sweeney and some of his cohorts have their latest filing.

102
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:12,000
They're asking for a preliminary injunction, but also in the court filing, they release data on numbers of users and the impact this whole shenanigans has had.

103
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:20,000
So Epic says Fortnite has one hundred and sixteen million iOS users, which is a third of the game's three hundred and fifty million total users.

104
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Oh, crap. Wow.

105
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Oh, yeah.

106
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
And this one kind of hurts.

107
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:32,000
They say their iOS daily active users declined by 60 percent since its removal from the app store.

108
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
That is pretty significant.

109
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Now, it's not going to kill them, but that is a decent chunk.

110
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Hundred and sixteen million users out of three hundred and fifty million total.

111
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I mean, they're really playing with fire here.

112
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:50,000
But I suppose you could look at this from another angle and say we've got to change these policies before that share gets even larger.

113
00:08:50,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I guess. I mean, I know I had a pretty spicy take that was unpopular on Twitter that like the judge said and Apple said you could just go back on and pay them 30 percent during the lawsuit and that would be OK.

114
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Yeah, that did seem like a decent compromise on Apple's part.

115
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Right. But Tim Sweeney again shares many character flaws with me.

116
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Has decided to lose a bunch of money for no reason.

117
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I don't kind of get this.

118
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
It's an interesting stand to just, you know, fully rely on.

119
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
We're just going to keep complaining.

120
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I suppose it does let them make these continued arguments.

121
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
If they went back on, they wouldn't have these big numbers to drop.

122
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Maybe, you know, slightly smaller numbers anyway.

123
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I guess.

124
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Yeah. And the damages would be a lot less.

125
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Now, Miguel Itacasa on Twitter had a pretty popular thread and I'm curious to get your guys' take on this.

126
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:47,000
He says, I bet Fortnite could work in Safari without going through the App Store like Confucius famously said in 500 B.C.

127
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:53,000
When there is a billion dollar budget, there is a way to compile the code to WebAssembly.

128
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
I mean, isn't there something to that?

129
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:06,000
And of course, the Twitter thread goes to point out all of the GL limitations and file size limitations like 10 megabyte module limitations and these things.

130
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,000
But Miguel's response to all of that is, yeah, but where there's money, there's a way.

131
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:19,000
And you essentially identify the technical problems and you build accommodations for them and you just avoid the App Store altogether.

132
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I mean, I don't think you could pull that off, at least not on mobile Safari.

133
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
But Wes, what do you think?

134
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Yeah, I think that would be the trickiest part.

135
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:32,000
It doesn't seem like Apple's gone out of their way to support all the things that might make this easy to do.

136
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Yeah.

137
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
But there is that point.

138
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I mean, you know, Epic has a lot of resources to throw at these things.

139
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:48,000
It would probably also be beneficial for that ecosystem for, you know, a major game and company to start pulling more resources into it and explore if that might actually be workable.

140
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Yeah, it's an interesting thought experiment because there are tons of limitations right now.

141
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:57,000
There's no WebAssembly threads in Safari's WebAssembly implementation.

142
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
It doesn't have WebGL2, but Firefox and Chrome have had that for years.

143
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
And it's never going to.

144
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:12,000
There's also, like, I think the game install on devices once all the assets are pulled down is like 30 gigs.

145
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Yeah.

146
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Yeah.

147
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:20,000
There is a little weird back and forth, too, in this thread, you know, where on one side people criticizing this idea are pointing out some of the problems.

148
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
And then Miguel's response is basically, well, you've got money.

149
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
You could do it.

150
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:29,000
And then the other side of things is people pointing out, well, how is Apple going to respond to this?

151
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
And him not really liking any of that sort of theorizing.

152
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:42,000
So I'm not not sure it's a real fair playing field on what money really makes possible because at some point there are actual technical limitations, especially on a tightly controlled platform.

153
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Hand wave money is essentially his answer.

154
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Right.

155
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I completely disagree.

156
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Having used Xamarin forms when it was independent and after Microsoft bought them, by the way, Miguel is the Xamarin guy for people who don't know.

157
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Let me tell you something.

158
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Microsoft just injecting those Benjamins has made it so much more stable.

159
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Is that sarcasm or is that sincerity?

160
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
I can't.

161
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
You know what the saddest part?

162
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
It's 100 percent sincere.

163
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Yeah, OK.

164
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I mean, money definitely goes a long way.

165
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Don't get me wrong.

166
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Yeah, it's possible if you have the right team.

167
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
I mean, we put man on the moon in the 60s.

168
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
So with a calculator, effectively.

169
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:24,000
But I think Wes is right that Apple will probably, if you even try this, react in a very I I'm going to cry if I think about what they might do.

170
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Right.

171
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Like they're they're not going to take it.

172
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
I don't know.

173
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I don't buy it.

174
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
I see you don't think so.

175
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:44,000
I find this take that Apple wants to hurt the Web and that Apple wants to limit what the Web can do kind of ludicrous and ridiculous on its face, because not only did the iPhone originally launch with 100 percent focus on Web apps.

176
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:49,000
But if you look at overall in totality, Safari has been extremely competitive on mobile.

177
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Yeah, it doesn't have WebGL to.

178
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Yeah, it doesn't have WebAssembly threads.

179
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Well, yeah, isn't that competitive just mean it's the browser to use that works well on the device that you paid a lot of money for?

180
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:06,000
I mean, I think one of the things that you got to fundamentally credit them for is rendering the real Web, not the baby Web on a mobile device.

181
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:22,000
And then the other super clever thing they did is they figured out that if a user double taps in an area that seems to be associated with a CSS element, zoom in specifically to that element to take out sort of the play in the zoom and bringing things like WebGL and other features to mobile.

182
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
And making it a very competitive mobile browser.

183
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:31,000
If you look at that, like they pioneered that essentially mobile browsers before the iPhone really sucked.

184
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
And so I don't think Apple has gone out of their way to limit Safari.

185
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,000
I just I don't think it is the number one priority on the platform.

186
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
And so it lags in some areas.

187
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Well, and doesn't it just make sense that they have a business interest in incentivizing things to focus on the App Store anyway?

188
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:53,000
I mean, I would say I bet Apple would define web browsing and web applications very differently.

189
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Like they want a great browser for you to go to like New York Times dot com.

190
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:01,000
But I don't think they want people building full featured Web apps and using Safari instead of the App Store.

191
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
I could be wrong.

192
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Maybe.

193
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,000
But then why would they have invested all of the energy they have into making it possible?

194
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:15,000
And why do they still make it possible for you to put website bookmarks on your main iOS long screen as an icon like an app?

195
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Well, isn't there always a balance there?

196
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Right. You've got to give users what is helpful to some extent, no matter what, even if it isn't exactly what you wish they were doing.

197
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Yeah. And as someone in the chat saying every other browser on iOS is, in fact, Safari.

198
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Right. They block.

199
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
So, yeah, I don't know.

200
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Yeah. And as of as of the current released OS, you can't even change the default web browser 10 years into the platform.

201
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:45,000
So ridiculous. But I guess that's changing in iOS 14 for certain approved browsers.

202
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Oh, yeah. Can't innovate my ass.

203
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:54,000
That's right. Just aside, we are doing Koda Radio Live again on Mondays if you'd like to join us.

204
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:59,000
So do head over to Jupiter broadcasting dot com slash calendar to get it in your local time.

205
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:03,000
It's noon Pacific, three p.m. Eastern for us at JBLive dot TV.

206
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
And we'd love to have you in the chat room.

207
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:11,000
There's, you know, a couple of times a week now live shows we got to live to live shows a week right now and feeling pretty good.

208
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Speaking of doing things for the consumers, there's a story that was dropped in the notes that I can't really necessarily see a downside to.

209
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
So we'll just wrap up the Apple stuff with this quote.

210
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Later this year, the App Store will help users understand an app's privacy practices before they download the app on any Apple platform.

211
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:39,000
On each app's product page, users can learn about some of the data types the app may collect and whether that data is linked to them or used to track them.

212
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
You'll need to provide information about how your this is to developers.

213
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:51,000
You'll need to provide information about how your apps privacy practices, including the practices of third party partners who code integrates with your app.

214
00:15:51,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Facebook SDK. Exactly. Mm hmm. In the App Store Connect starting this fall and the way it kind of is being sold to users as a type of nutrition label for privacy that'll show up on all App Store apps on all Apple platforms.

215
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Is there anything bad about this from a user's perspective, Mike?

216
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:19,000
I mean, I can understand from monetization from Facebook and users users.

217
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Yeah, that was the hell with them. They won't pay five dollars for an app. This is more paperwork for developers. I'm against it.

218
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:30,000
It is for sure. I mean, I mean, I want to get to that, but I just mean we have to keep in balance here for the end users.

219
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
This seems like a net win now. I totally appreciate. Yeah, I'm trolling.

220
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Well, no, I mean, for the developers, this does is a major pain in the ass.

221
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:42,000
I wonder if, you know, we already have nutrition labels and like life and do people read them.

222
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:52,000
So I think about like the analytics, you know, packages that people can get the track app usage and crash reports and even can do pretty significant data collection.

223
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:58,000
That is in a lot of apps. Yes, it is. That's bad. I don't know what to say.

224
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:03,000
I mean, forget about that. The Google SDK is in the Facebook SDK is alone are.

225
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:09,000
You're going to see a lot of scary stuff and all the apps you use, right? Yeah, that's where it's kind of funny is.

226
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:14,000
You're right. It will be annoying to developers, but it's probably something they should have done a little bit better job thinking about already.

227
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Just having to drop all these things in there that. Yeah, right. Well, you know, this big corporation takes care of it.

228
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,000
And I just include it because I need this one feature. That's what it is.

229
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:27,000
This should have been in there from day one. And now developers have been running amok, you bastards.

230
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:33,000
And now you got caught. You got caught reading clipboards. You got you got caught tracking people.

231
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:37,000
They've delayed something like then they just delay some aspect of of the tracking blocking stuff.

232
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:42,000
But yeah, well, that's because Facebook fought them, right? Like literally Apple blinked.

233
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Yeah, it's interesting they blink on that, I guess, because Mark Zuckerberg is a lot more stealthy than Tim Sweeney is what we're learning, right?

234
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Well, maybe, although one is a policy that they agreed to when they entered the app store and one is a policy that is being applied retroactively.

235
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:02,000
So maybe Apple is just. More considerate in that scenario, is that crazy?

236
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:07,000
You seem pretty bullish on this. So, like, do you think this is going to impact how you you guys download applications?

237
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:14,000
I mean, for my kids, it might. Yeah, sure. Yeah. OK, I could see that. And my wife, I could see it mattering.

238
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:20,000
I'm already kind of skeptical, you know, when it comes to my usage, but I could definitely see it for them.

239
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:33,000
My daughter accidentally downloaded a Roku app remote control and it somehow got her to agree to a $15 a month subscription to enable the app's functionality.

240
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Roku? Yeah, it's just Wi-Fi, right? It's just sending Roku remote commands over Wi-Fi.

241
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:44,000
It auto detects the Roku device and just sends it commands over the API, right?

242
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Fifteen bucks a month. And so I'm looking at my email. Thankfully, I caught it right. But I mean, after after it charged me and I even had it turned on to like ask for my permit.

243
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:59,000
I don't know what happened, but it's tricky the way it gets people into it. And she didn't know she was doing anything wrong.

244
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:04,000
So it's a complicated thing. So that's the next. But that'll be the next frontier and all that kind of shenanigans.

245
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:09,000
And I think it matters because it definitely has knock on. It's going to impact the Play Store for sure.

246
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Also, obviously, this is all going to play into larger antitrust stuff that the ball seems to start rolling there more and more.

247
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:22,000
All of these stories will play into that dynamic.

248
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Let's take a break and tell you about Linode cloud hosting Linode dot com slash coder and you'll get a hundred dollar 60 day credit towards your account.

249
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:46,000
One hundred dollars. Linode dot com slash coder. Simplify your cloud infrastructure with Linode's Linux virtual machines and robust set of tools to develop, deploy and scale your modern applications faster and easier.

250
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:53,000
They have 11 data centers around the world, enterprise grade hardware and their next generation network, which is fast.

251
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:57,000
They have a lot of nice rigs, too. Now, the shared plans start at five dollars a month.

252
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:04,000
So that dollar credit you could I mean, you could do anything you want. Right. But I actually would encourage you to play around with their configurator.

253
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:10,000
It is slick. They have a ton of OS options. They have easy ways to deploy with one click.

254
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:15,000
They also have what I have messed around with a little bit for setting up different WordPress installations.

255
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:21,000
They have these stack scripts that make it really easy to set up a really high speed WordPress deployment.

256
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,000
And you can just it's all really easy to read the script and make your own.

257
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:30,000
So that's nice. Of course, everything's SSD, 40 gigabit connections that come into the machines.

258
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,000
They have a beautiful cloud manager and a nice way to track everything that's happening.

259
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:42,000
And if you want to integrate it in with something a little bit larger, more production grade, they have fast and simple Kubernetes cluster deployments.

260
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Really easy to get going. They also have a container orchestration engine to make it simple to manage multiple containers, dedicated GPU rigs.

261
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:58,000
You just have to go to linode.com slash coder for a $100, 60 day credit. That's linode.com slash coder.

262
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,000
They're my cloud provider now. I've been using them for about two years.

263
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:07,000
And we just built a matrix server on there for the network, and it just screams.

264
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:13,000
It really is great performance. This is reliable infrastructure. They have been in the game for a long time.

265
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:17,000
They're trusted by a lot of leading tech companies, and they've been in the community.

266
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Linode.com slash coder and thanks to Linode for sponsoring the CoderRadio program.

267
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:27,000
All right, gentlemen, so why don't we get into something kind of neat?

268
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Something special happened since last week that really didn't get very much attention.

269
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:40,000
On the 5th of September, C++20 was approved, which I didn't really understand or appreciate what this meant.

270
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:46,000
So I did a little bit of reading before the show, and now I understand that this will be the sixth revision of the C standard.

271
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:53,000
I like that some of the positioning around this has very intentionally been another opportunity for you to consider C++.

272
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:59,000
The standard became technically finalized by the WG21 at a meeting in Prague in February of 2020.

273
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:03,000
So we knew this was coming, but it just happened.

274
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,000
The draft was approved just recently as we got together today.

275
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:14,000
And I like this idea as a topic, Mike, which you suggested because no one's really talking much about C++ in 2020.

276
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Yeah, well, you know, all the cool people like Wes are on Clojure, Elixir, some language he's probably inventing in a basement somewhere.

277
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:30,000
What we really have to appreciate is that C++ is the only language that steering committee is also a venue for a Bond film.

278
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:34,000
They're in Prague. I'm assuming they're playing Baccarat, right?

279
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
That's what I'm picturing. I'm thinking, right? Yeah.

280
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:41,000
A lot of slinky dresses. It's a good time. Yeah. Fancy cars. Fancy cars.

281
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Drinks that are stirred, shaken, not stirred, not stirred, shaken, not stirred.

282
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Yeah, right. I'm going to pitch it to Wes in a second.

283
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:54,000
The over overriding thing that I got as I was reading up on this, it's just how damn big C++ is as a language.

284
00:22:54,000 --> 00:23:02,000
And I mean like big in terms of like it has all the features I've basically heard of and basically any language, right?

285
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,000
You can program in many different ways. It's a little nuts.

286
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:09,000
I've been playing with it some for a kind of fun side project.

287
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:14,000
There's like a new way to do pointers that didn't exist the last time I actually had to do C++.

288
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:19,000
So that's amazing. I don't know, Wes, have you have you fooled around with modern C++ at all?

289
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Yeah, that's what's been interesting. You know, I have played a little bit, but I did most of my C++.

290
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Well, probably like 10, 15 years ago. So it's kind of fascinating to watch.

291
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:35,000
I do think you're onto something just, you know, looking around at people commenting on the release.

292
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:45,000
I like this. Even as a C++ programmer with too much spare time, it has become obvious that learning and using all of C++ is beyond impractical.

293
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:51,000
To the point where I find that my C++ code more than ever looks kind of just like C.

294
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:59,000
And yet, you know, I think C++ suffers a bit from being, you know, a little bit legacy despite being more modern.

295
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:09,000
And where you get into, you know, you see a lot of arguments is that like what standard is used, what standard parts of the standard are being supported for the compiler that you are actually using.

296
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:20,000
And then, of course, the problem with a lot of, you know, long term, long lived languages is like, how do you how do you learn what modern best practices are if all the tutorials are out of date?

297
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:28,000
And, you know, I think there's been a lot of pushback, especially compared to a language like Rust where, yeah, C++ has pioneered a lot of these zero cost abstractions.

298
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:37,000
But you got to know more about it versus a language like Rust that, you know, those are pushed right from, you know, right from the start of the tutorial that this is the way that you go.

299
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Yeah, I mean, a great example of that is so a big feature in C++ 20, which should be easy for me to say, but isn't, is modules, right?

300
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:51,000
They've introduced modules, which I am not a deep C++ guy, so I don't know a whole lot about.

301
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:59,000
But if you read the back and forth on the groups, there is quite a lot of controversy about how that was done, how that should have been done.

302
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:05,000
And it almost reminds me of like, you know, we always end up with that argument of like, what is the tasteful subset of the language, right? Right.

303
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:13,000
So I don't know. It's I mean, it's still not Objective C, so I'm not particularly excited, but whatever. You have nowhere to go from there, right?

304
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:24,000
I cornered you into the Objective C. That's hard to beat. Well, I think the other question is going to be, you know, how if you are a C++ advocate and you're really excited about C++ 20,

305
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:35,000
how do you go spread that word and get, you know, folks who are interested in doing a little lower level stuff, who, you know, some of the advantages, speed, control, specificity of C++ might be useful.

306
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:40,000
How do you convince them that it's worth learning and going through all the warts and figuring that out?

307
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:53,000
You know, like the module stuff's really interesting. But again, like if you if another option might be learning Rust or another modern language that has better or at least more modern concepts of, you know, package and dependency management,

308
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:59,000
it might still be an excellent tool for folks who've been doing it for 10 years. But how do you keep that mind check going?

309
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Well, that's a great point about Rust, right? Because I have in the doc here, I have Rust, Go, and Swift. All three of them share one thing in common.

310
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Well, in addition to not being as good as Objective-C. I just can't help myself.

311
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:20,000
All of them were created with the idea that they would be basically C++ but better or like C++ without the C or something like that, right?

312
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:31,000
And I mean, Swift, even Swift, which is why I include that disgusting thing on this list, because Chris Latner himself said he wanted it to be like Objective-C and C++ without the C.

313
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:39,000
So how do you convince someone who's like new that they're going to? Yeah, like you're saying, right? You got to deal with, you know, 30, 40 years of warts in C++.

314
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:54,000
I know it's not 40. When you could just like, I don't know, write in Rust and learn that you're a bad programmer because nothing compiles or write and go and get a cute plushie from Google or write in Swift and have an inferior development experience.

315
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,000
Wow. But you get to go to WWDC, then you can justify that.

316
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Not in 2020, you don't maybe. No, it's true. It's true. You know, the thing, just as an observation, is Rust is front and center in a PR announcement, much like machine learning or AI is.

317
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Just last week, Amazon announced AWS Bottle Rocket, which is a container Linux distribution.

318
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:27,000
And right there, front and center in the official Amazon press release, they talk about how the user land is full of Rust tools that they've written. It's Rust, Rust, Rust.

319
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:30,000
Why? I don't get that at all. Is that a selling point for a container solution?

320
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:36,000
It is, I think, because Rust is known as the safe language, the safe language to write your tools.

321
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:41,000
And that's sort of just sort of like it's almost like a celebrity programming language now.

322
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:48,000
And it's like why you have movie stars in your movie, in your big action movie, you want to have Sylvester Stallone.

323
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:55,000
If you're releasing something that's supposed to be safe, reliable and enterprise grade, having Rust on the label sells.

324
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Who are they selling to?

325
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:05,000
Developers, IT admins, sys administrators. You know, I mean, in this case, in this example, this is the AWS Bottle Rocket project that they announced.

326
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:08,000
It's open source. It's up on GitHub. It's pretty wild.

327
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:12,000
The whole thing's there, the issue tracker, the Kanban board, all of it.

328
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:18,000
They got their Trello thing going on. And it's all there.

329
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:25,000
And yeah, the tools are all the user land tools, as they call the space above the kernel, as they put it, is all Rust.

330
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,000
So it's a distro.

331
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Yeah. Yeah, it's a full distro.

332
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:39,000
Sitting on top of a lot of essentially best practices now using containers to deploy your applications and taking advantages of eBPF in the Linux kernel,

333
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:48,000
taking advantage of SE Linux and all that stuff and making it designed with the idea that you're not SSHing in, but you're probably using it with an orchestration system.

334
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:54,000
And I don't think it's any just mistake or accident that Rust is featured in their promotional material about it.

335
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:59,000
Right. I mean, I think it goes back to that sort of like the defaults and where the community pushes you.

336
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:05,000
I mean, I've definitely seen some pushback on the Rust hype from experienced C++ programmers who point out that like, yeah,

337
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:11,000
a lot of these same sort of concepts, abstractions, you can write clean and safe C++ code.

338
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:19,000
I think the question is, A, how often does that happen, especially for some X random software with a mixed range of experienced developers?

339
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,000
But then B, it doesn't have that same air, right?

340
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,000
When someone chooses Rust, you see that, oh, yeah, right.

341
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:32,000
They want those safety features. And even if they're doing a bad job of writing Rust, which the people writing the PR never check out or look at,

342
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,000
it just has that air of the community takes that seriously.

343
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:39,000
Well said. Right. You can write Rust and turn off all the safety features, right?

344
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Like literally unsafe the whole application. Yeah.

345
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Yeah, I think that's really well said. That's why I kind of compare it to tossing in machine learning, if possible, to a press release with a product, a tech product.

346
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:56,000
If it's a monitoring product or something, something that uses the cloud, you know, it often will have machine learning and artificial intelligence.

347
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,000
And they just kind of include it in the press release. And it's vague.

348
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:05,000
It doesn't actually tell you what the implementation is or how useful it is or how core to the product it actually is or what it actually does.

349
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:10,000
But they still put it in there. And it's kind of like that. But it sells or else they wouldn't do it.

350
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:15,000
Salad shack now with machine learning. I actually would be down for that.

351
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:23,000
If there was a salad shack that could learn the salad I liked and maybe even suggest future salad ideas, kind of seems like a great idea.

352
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:28,000
Whoever is listening, there is your next great app opportunity. The salad genie for Chris. There you go.

353
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:32,000
And Mike only charges 30 percent as a licensing fee.

354
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:40,000
Yeah. There you go. Per salad. Now, you imagine like an Uber Eats that you just open up on your phone and you just push a button and it just knows what you'd want and gets it for you.

355
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,000
That'd be that's what Google ought to use all their AdWords machines for.

356
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:50,000
It's just fascinating to watch this language continue to evolve. And then I'll also be curious to see, you know, we've already seen some movements.

357
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:57,000
We were just talking about Linux, you know, some movements to support maybe using Rust to write like some modules for the Linux kernel.

358
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:05,000
When will that start creeping into like some of the major adopters like scientific computing or, you know, game engine design that C++ is really entrenched in?

359
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Like, is that going to start shifting and what kind of time frame is that going to take before you start seeing Rust sneaking in there or another language?

360
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:18,000
Didn't I say, yeah, Microsoft is adopting Rust, April, August 4th, 2020.

361
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:27,000
Microsoft is adopting Rust and, quote, Rust is the industry's best chance at safe systems programming.

362
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:34,000
Oh, geez. And they say here C++ can't be fixed. Coming in hard, coming in real hard.

363
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
I'm sorry, I need some ointment for the flames.

364
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:42,000
I'm going to I'll drop a link to this in the show notes of audience members. That's probably a that's a good one to read for a moment.

365
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:47,000
Seems kind of spicy and I like it. Huh. The best chance, Microsoft says.

366
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:56,000
And there's an article at Medium written by somebody at Microsoft, Tino Carr, I think, on Microsoft's adoption of Rust and why they're adopting it.

367
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:05,000
Microsoft determined that 70 percent of security patches pushed towards computers are related to memory related bugs.

368
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:10,000
So I mean, that's saying something. They certainly have plenty of C++ and that their operating system of theirs.

369
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:15,000
Yeah. And yeah, right. Defaults matter. And you can do those things with C++.

370
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:21,000
But if you know, if you can't always trust that that's going to happen, maybe something that makes it easy and right there already.

371
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:25,000
So you've got extra safety. So, Mr. Payne, you doing any any developing for the day job?

372
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:30,000
Anything you've been working on? Sure am. You know, actually, I've been having a lot of fun.

373
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:38,000
I'm doing Python development at the moment and I've been using this neat framework called Fast API, which I was trying to hint to Mike that maybe he should check out.

374
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:44,000
Oh, really? Python. So not closure. Is that a challenge, sir?

375
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:48,000
You know, maybe it is. Yeah. I would love to see if because you've been doing some Python, too.

376
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:55,000
Right, Mike? Not only am I doing some, I'm hiring another Python developer. Plug, plug, plug. Oh, hey.

377
00:32:55,000 --> 00:33:01,000
Where do they get info for that? If I was prepared, I would have put up the job post. So maybe next episode we'll have it.

378
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:06,000
Follow me on Twitter. We'll have it for next episode for sure. There you go. This is interesting, Wes. So fast API.

379
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:14,000
What's this do? Well, you know, it's an it's a framework for Python that really just tries to make things very nice for developing APIs.

380
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:20,000
And, you know, so much of stuff these days. It's either computers talking to computers or humans talking to computers.

381
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:27,000
And you're going to need an API. And some of the frameworks that have existed currently can do a lot more than that.

382
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:32,000
Right. I mean, they can make just sort of simple Web apps. They can be a background API.

383
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:41,000
They've got all kinds of integrated ORM solutions, maybe maybe solutions like Django that has like support for building forms built into it.

384
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:47,000
Fast API just sort of gets out of your way, provides some really nice integration with a library called Pydantic.

385
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:58,000
It's a data validation library that takes advantage of Python's somewhat recent introduction of type hinting to just provide a lot of nice affordances out of the get go.

386
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:04,000
So you can stand up your API. It comes with, you know, open API and Redoc built right in.

387
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:09,000
It's got data validation right integrated into the solution with really nice error messages by default.

388
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:16,000
So you can focus on actually doing the hard work of the back end of the API calling out to other services and databases that you actually need to talk to.

389
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:26,000
Wow. Hey, check this out. Neil linked in the IRC on the live stream to Fedora Magazine dot org, which talks about building a small Web service using fast API.

390
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:31,000
This is pretty cool. This is a great walk through introduction to it. Oh, neat.

391
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:38,000
This is really it came out kind of recently to June. June 1st, 2020, as we record, it's at least fairly recent.

392
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:42,000
Neat. Well, how did this come about? Because this is actually I did not expect Python to be your answer.

393
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:49,000
I have to tell you, I thought it'd be something either much more esoteric or I don't know, something really enterprising.

394
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:54,000
I guess I just don't I don't think of Python when I think of enterprise software development.

395
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:59,000
Yeah, you know, I mean, I think it sneaks in in more places than you might suspect.

396
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:04,000
Python's also been improved recently, somewhat recently with, you know, better async support.

397
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:07,000
So there's better concurrency built into the language.

398
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:12,000
And yeah, there are going to be some, you know, high scale services where maybe Python isn't going to work for you.

399
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:23,000
But for a lot of APIs and web applications where a lot of your, you know, a lot of your calls end up being dominated on latency calling into the database or other large operations.

400
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:30,000
Python works pretty well, and it's just so developer friendly, you know, like it's easy to get started with, especially with libraries like fast API.

401
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,000
And it has such a rich ecosystem. Yeah.

402
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:37,000
If you if you want to call into, you know, any cloud service, yeah, they've got a Python API.

403
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:40,000
If you want to use any database, they've got a Python API.

404
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:45,000
Yeah. And the reality is, I know I know a lot of enterprise applications that do use Python.

405
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:49,000
So I don't I don't know. I just didn't expect that. But it's pretty great.

406
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:54,000
Yeah. Well, a good majority of Google right of of their support stuff is actually like all Python.

407
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:58,000
So, yeah. Yeah. I mean, I've used entire backup systems that are powered by Python.

408
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:04,000
Chatham points out Ansible is written in Python. A lot of Red Hat's tools. I mean, tons of. Yeah.

409
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:09,000
But I just thought that what I expected. So, Wes, how does this compare to like a flask?

410
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:15,000
It's a little more purpose driven, I'd say. You know, flask is great. I've used flask before and enjoyed it.

411
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:21,000
But it's a little more loosey goosey, perhaps you might say. I mean, like you can do whatever you want in flask, which is awesome.

412
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:28,000
But if you're really just like trying to get like an API that you can build to a standard, you have fewer choices.

413
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:35,000
And that can be a good thing because like fast API has chosen your data validation library for you, which is Pydantic.

414
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:41,000
Which I've been enjoying a lot. And so it really sketches this model where right from the get go, you're defining, you know,

415
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:45,000
request and response types that are leveraging Python's type hinting.

416
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:52,000
And all of that's integrated so that that gets pushed into the open API specification for you so that that's already provided for you.

417
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:55,000
And, you know, for your clients to consume if they want to go that route.

418
00:36:55,000 --> 00:37:00,000
And then in the back end, as you're writing it, you know that you've already validated all this data.

419
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:04,000
It's also got just nice basic features like, you know, it's going to catch any uncaught exceptions for you.

420
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:09,000
Make sure that just turns into a 500 without any embarrassing back end info.

421
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:15,000
It's like they've taken all the bits of like, I need to write a thousand APIs to expose these new features for my clients.

422
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:22,000
I want to make that as fast as possible and not have to deal with all the little fiddly bits and choosing which library over here that might handle this one part of it.

423
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:26,000
I'm noticing automatic interactive docs, too. That's awesome.

424
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:35,000
Exactly. Right. It's just like it's none of it's none of it's stuff that you couldn't do in any other framework or just building yourself by assembling libraries.

425
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:41,000
But sometimes your application isn't unique enough to really warrant that kind of special care and attention.

426
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:44,000
And I think that's the use case that fast API shines.

427
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:53,000
And you've seen it somewhat for like, I think, as more people are doing machine learning and Python's pretty big in that community can be a nice way to serve up models, interact with those systems.

428
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:57,000
It probably won't be the best if you're trying to build like a classic Web application.

429
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:00,000
Yeah. OK. Maybe use Flask or, you know, especially Django for that.

430
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:08,000
But if you're really sort of an API driven business or project, it's probably worth just checking out.

431
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:19,000
The other part I like is that it's just, you know, it's really I have mixed feelings about about, you know, the adoption and strong opinions around static types in general.

432
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:28,000
But I think that they found a really nice sweet spot here of leveraging sort of the optional typing that's been added to Python and focusing like you see it all over their docs.

433
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:33,000
It's clearly a focus is having those type ins partially for that, you know, that you can go do more static analysis.

434
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:39,000
But also they recognize the importance for new users and developers of integration with the IDE.

435
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:46,000
And because there is so much type information provided in these libraries, you've got auto complete just about everywhere you might expect.

436
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:51,000
And it does a pretty good job of, you know, having a similar experience to an actually statically type language.

437
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:55,000
So what's your environment for doing this Python work? What do you mean?

438
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:58,000
So you mentioned IDEs, are you using PyCharm or Code?

439
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:02,000
I thought this time around, I've used PyCharm a little bit in the past, but it's been a long while.

440
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:07,000
I've also had a totally Vim based setup, which I liked pretty decently.

441
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:11,000
I'm not like a, you know, a huge IDE super rich support.

442
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:14,000
I kind of enjoy like having a terminal open and then like an editor open.

443
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:17,000
And I'm going to be in a REPL anyway, probably if I can.

444
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:22,000
But I thought I'd strike the middle ground this time around since I was setting up, you know, building new projects, working on new stuff.

445
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:26,000
I just totally invest and try out VSCode and I've been having a lot of fun with that.

446
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:29,000
Oh, another VSCode user.

447
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
A code convert, you could say.

448
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:36,000
Yeah, it is funny. I still find myself like I use Vim half the time anyway for editing some stuff.

449
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:41,000
But as like a separate Python dedicated window, it's really nice.

450
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:44,000
I've also actually been enjoying the Git support a lot, too.

451
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:47,000
Yep, absolutely. Those are some of the reasons I just love it.

452
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:55,000
That and it's got a fantastic YAML plug in. It's got a fantastic Markdown plug in, you know, SFTP opening files on remote servers.

453
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:58,000
It's just it's a treat. It really feels slick.

454
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:01,000
I just I'm really happy with it. I mean, I'm open to trying other ones.

455
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:04,000
But interesting. I love it.

456
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:07,000
So all three of us because that's what you're using mostly these days, too, right, Mike?

457
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
Yeah, I'm actually all on code now.

458
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:14,000
People are going to think we're fanboys, but it's just what works for us.

459
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,000
They're bought and paid for by Redmond.

460
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:19,000
Yeah, making that big V.S. code money. Yes.

461
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:24,000
Well, it was just this morning.

462
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:35,000
I was really kind of feeling how no events have started to impact myself and sort of what I would normally be doing business wise.

463
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:38,000
I assume, Wes, you must be doing the work from home thing.

464
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:42,000
And Mike, I was also curious to get an update from you on the business stuff, but I'll share mine here in a moment.

465
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:48,000
But Wes, what about you? With this new gig, are you are you doing the work from home thing from the start, essentially?

466
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:51,000
Yeah, you know, actually, it was kind of weird.

467
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:54,000
It's the first time I did an entirely remote onboarding as well.

468
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:57,000
Like, I have never been into the office.

469
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:03,000
I did have to go run over to my manager's house because he had a laptop that I picked up from him in a socially distanced manner.

470
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:06,000
You know, so that was a little awkward and a weird like first way to meet in person.

471
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:09,000
But the interview, the interview was online. The onboarding was online.

472
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:12,000
At this point, I don't know if I'll ever even have to go into the office.

473
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:17,000
Interesting. Yeah, I wonder if that's going to be true for a lot of people.

474
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:23,000
And I feel like it's going to impact podcast downloads.

475
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:28,000
I got a note from a guy today. He's like, oh, I just tuned into Linux action as I didn't know it was done for a while.

476
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:32,000
I didn't know it was off the air. You know, people are just kind of now catching up on their podcast.

477
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
But what about you, Mike? Is the business feeling it?

478
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:39,000
Or at this point, have you reached a new normal for the sort of lockdown state, no events kind of thing?

479
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:44,000
I think we've pretty much gotten used to it. I mean, I was pretty early on locking down because I'm crazy.

480
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:50,000
I will say not having like community events has been starting to feel that.

481
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:55,000
Yeah, but same. Other than that, it's you know, I'm sitting and I have my little standing desk in my home office.

482
00:41:55,000 --> 00:42:00,000
Now I'm happy. I'm fine. I'm wondering how much even comes back next year.

483
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:04,000
Right. Not a thing. And if it lasts that long, I wonder how much comes back.

484
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:13,000
And that would be a loss, I think, because for me, it's it's a big part of I think how I get connected with the fact that we actually make something.

485
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:21,000
Because otherwise I just sort of put it out there and maybe hear from one percent of the audience, maybe two percent of the audience.

486
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:25,000
And, you know, it's true. And, you know, that's just the reality of it.

487
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:36,000
But it after a year of not talking, not actually speaking to a real human that listens, you know, other than like through Bumble or through a chat, it's it's it's unsettling.

488
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:51,000
Because when I go to these meetups and I know you guys know this is true, but like you you end up with a table full or wherever you're at of people who are interesting, like they're in the industry or they're they're trying to get into the industry or they have a history.

489
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:57,000
Like all these really interesting details in it. For me, it helps me connect with the fact that there's real people out there that are really listening to the show.

490
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:02,000
And a lot of them are doing things that I really admire or find super interesting.

491
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:08,000
And that kind of gets me going and keeps me motivated. I'm not really having any motivation problems, but I do feel like it's sort of dipping.

492
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:16,000
But also there's been no event for us to really cover show wise, like we haven't gone somewhere and done something from the show floor and covered it.

493
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:19,000
Right. So it's just been lacking from the network all year.

494
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:25,000
And I kind of miss doing that, too. I find it interesting the different modes of like remote interactions as well.

495
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:36,000
My team's sort of been exploring that around stand ups and like when do we communicate and when do you need to communicate, you know, sort of blocking issues like I need to talk to you so we can resolve this for work stuff.

496
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:45,000
But then also trying to figure out like how often do we actually just need to have a chat where we all sit around and bullshit so that, you know, like we feel like we're a team and see each other's faces.

497
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:50,000
And, you know, what you might replicate hanging out in the lunch room. That is a hard thing to get right.

498
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:55,000
And it can be a really hard thing when you're a really busy team as well, because then it's kind of hard to justify doing that kind of stuff.

499
00:43:55,000 --> 00:44:03,000
And you always get one or two people that are there with the mics on mute and they're like typing away and you can see they're not even like looking at the video call.

500
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:09,000
What did you say? Oh, sorry. Yeah. Yeah. Right. And I find those Zoom meetings kind of fatiguing, too, because you always sit there and nod and smile.

501
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:16,000
Mm hmm. Yeah. Mm hmm. So, yeah, it's hard to get that. It's nothing like having the team all together in the same space.

502
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:24,000
Let's just take like Linux Fest Northwest or the one that happens in South Carolina, whose name I never remember or Ohio Linux Fest, which is coming up soon.

503
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:29,000
So you think they're just not going to happen or you think people are going to migrate virtual?

504
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:33,000
I think it's I think it's going to be virtual, which there's parts of that that I like.

505
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:38,000
You know, you can get core aspects and it makes it available to more people. I like all that stuff.

506
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:43,000
I've been able to attend events that I'd never attended before. So that's positive.

507
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:52,000
But the hallway stuff, the going out to eat, the building relationships over a period of time, you know, like Alex from Self Hosted.

508
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:58,000
We met at Texas Linux Fest and then we met at another fest that happens, you know, like three or four months after that.

509
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:04,000
And we just resumed a conversation that started at Texas Linux Fest and then took it online.

510
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:09,000
And then Linux Fest Northwest came around and the next thing you know, we have Self Hosted.

511
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:23,000
And it was just this process of meeting someone, going out, sharing a drink, sharing a meal and talking about similar things and making a connection that is possible online, but just is so low bandwidth in comparison.

512
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:29,000
That's it. It takes a lot longer to really suss out like, do we vibe on that human to human level?

513
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:32,000
Because we're just talking over the little little bit of text.

514
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:43,000
It's truly a bandwidth issue. It's like your human senses need more resolution than I think video provides, than seeing somebody from the top up, you know, half up.

515
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:50,000
And when you're out and about, you know, at an event, you interact with people in a technical sense, but also it's like regular humans, which you don't always see online.

516
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:55,000
You get to see how they, you know, comport themselves at the restaurant. You get to see how they interact with other people and strangers.

517
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:58,000
And it gives you a much richer view of a person.

518
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:10,000
I'm really glad you said that, because that is a huge aspect of it for me is you when you're only online, when everything's virtual, it's like social media is reality in a way.

519
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:15,000
People the way people present themselves and the photos they share and the topics that they talk about.

520
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:26,000
But when you go to an event and that same person is there, you see a three dimensional human being who is maybe actually a little overweight or doesn't have all their stuff together and also has flaws.

521
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
And isn't a perfect person.

522
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:43,000
And that was a huge, huge revelation for me as the journalist aspect of this job, because I often go in with press credentials, which means I get access to the journalist area and meeting some of these names in tech journalism.

523
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:51,000
And taking them from like these these icons and tech journalism to just these human beings that are clearly flawed.

524
00:46:51,000 --> 00:47:00,000
And and that was for me, it was like, oh, oh, I see. They're not like it's not like this impossible thing that I could never aspire to.

525
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:05,000
They're just a guy or a gal who's been working at this for a long time. They're just like everybody else.

526
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:17,000
And not having that veil of social media removed from time to time, I think, makes me feel like I live in this echo chamber that is super intense and often doesn't fully represent my point of view.

527
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:26,000
Not all the time, but just on various things. And maybe makes me feel like I'm not like that's not a game I'm good at.

528
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:31,000
I'm not good at social media. I don't tweet a lot. I don't share a lot of stuff. I try to reply to people, but it's just not where I'm.

529
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:40,000
It's so it makes me feel like I'm not as good at at the job because that's when you're online and everything's virtual perception is reality.

530
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:51,000
And it's not an area I really have the motivation or energy to be hyper competitive in. I don't feel like tweeting 17 times a day about stuff and taking pictures of every little thing.

531
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:56,000
And like every now and then I'm inspired, like when I'm out in the woods or something, I'm inspired to take a photo and I'll share that.

532
00:47:56,000 --> 00:48:03,000
But that's about it. Or if Levi's being cued. Yeah, obviously, if the pups being cute, that's got to get shared.

533
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:11,000
Actually, the reality is probably zero point one percent of all the adorable Levi pictures ever get shared. I mean, we need more.

534
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:18,000
But you know what I mean? Like without these in-person events, I feel disconnected in a way and I feel like it's not real.

535
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:21,000
It's not real life. It's just it's not it's not there. It's not connecting for me.

536
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:26,000
There is a couple of community events that I routinely go to. They're like quarterly right in Tampa.

537
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:33,000
Three of them have tried to do these online, like almost like a replacement kind of thing, right?

538
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:39,000
Like virtualize it. And it's just awful. I mean, I I don't know, man.

539
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:44,000
To me, it doesn't work without like the side, you know, of, oh, let's just run in and grab a beer or a cup of coffee or something.

540
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:52,000
It's very just feels like another Zoom meeting, right? Where somebody is pitching something and just not loose, very formal.

541
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:56,000
And you don't have those breakaways, right? Like those ways to be like, oh, I'm clearly driving with you.

542
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:59,000
That's like I'm just going to chat with you in the corner for a little bit and get to know you better.

543
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:03,000
You can't do that on a Zoom meeting, at least not without a lot more awkward formality.

544
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:11,000
Right. It's the difference between when I interview someone and we get connected on a tool and we're live and I say, OK, and well, you know,

545
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:18,000
and it's all this big buildup versus going to their house and sitting down with them and recording an interview of just a chat in a chair.

546
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:22,000
It's like these virtual meetings, you're kind of on you're presenting a little bit.

547
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:25,000
There's a camera on you. It is a human being. I think we can't help it.

548
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:33,000
When when you see your face in a little box and you see other people are watching you, there's just parts of your brain that turn on.

549
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,000
You're in presentation mode. At least that's how it works for me.

550
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:40,000
And that's not to say I can't hang out with a friend or something or a family member on a call.

551
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:46,000
And that's fine. But for these conferences and events, for me to actually be comfortable,

552
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:52,000
I probably need to have my camera off because otherwise I feel like I'm distracted by the fact that I'm sort of in presentation mode.

553
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:57,000
But then it's sort of it even reduces the network effect even further.

554
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:03,000
I know I'm I'm clutching about something that I, you know, I should just be grateful is even happening because these events are taking a real beating.

555
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:09,000
But I guess at this point into it coming into September and I'm thinking about how usually October.

556
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:13,000
Well, this is what makes me this is what got me started thinking about this, actually, unless I'm wrong.

557
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:17,000
I think the last event I did was Texas Cyber Summit, which was in October.

558
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:22,000
Yeah, you're right. Wow. That really was like a universe ago.

559
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:30,000
Yeah. And, you know, it's like, you know, after after a breakup, you know, you want to go out and like be free and flaunt it.

560
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:37,000
You know, I feel like I want to get out there and, you know, shake my moneymaker and, you know, socially distance maybe.

561
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:41,000
But now that's a vision. Yeah. I think he means his microphone. He's shaking his microphone.

562
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:46,000
Oh, yeah. You know what? They're talking to people and seeing people and stuff like that.

563
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:51,000
But so do you feel that once this is over, you're going to go out hard or do you think it's going to take a toll?

564
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:57,000
I don't know. I don't know. Like I envisioned a lot more live content in 2020.

565
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:02,000
I even pictured doing some of these shows on location somewhere because why not?

566
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:05,000
Like I've been doing this for so long. Why not change it up?

567
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:10,000
Maybe if I can find a spot that kind of has a live feel but isn't too distracting and loud, it could be a lot of fun.

568
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:17,000
Take a train ride down to Seattle, set up a little temporary recording space and doing it live from downtown Seattle today.

569
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:29,000
I thought I'd be doing a lot of that in 2020 and I've done none of it because it was the winter and then and then the COVID lockdowns and it really hit Seattle hard initially.

570
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:33,000
So it just all came to halt and all the events got canceled.

571
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:38,000
I ended up not being able to make it to scale and Linux fest got canceled and just boom and all shut down.

572
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:49,000
And so a year has gone by and what I thought would be a rather common part of the business and the content has not even materialized at all.

573
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:54,000
And it's woe is me, right? I mean, I'm not trying to make it sound like it's some big loss,

574
00:51:54,000 --> 00:52:03,000
but it's something I just have been reflecting on recently and thinking how I envisioned at the beginning of the year things would play out really differently in that regard.

575
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:14,000
Right. And you miss a couple of conferences and you're like, OK, well, that sucks. But then after a while you realize, yeah, you'd really do have this yearning in some human part of you that wants that connection.

576
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:22,000
And there's the aspect of employment, too. I feel that conferences are a great way to network and get jobs if you're looking for work.

577
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:31,000
A lot of times they're actively recruiting at booths and there's always folks who have open positions that are walking around in the hallway track.

578
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:37,000
I see it happen every conference I go to. Yes. And that that could be really useful right now.

579
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:44,000
And that's also not happening. And I realize it can't. But as soon as it's safe to return, I will go back out myself.

580
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:51,000
I think it's an important aspect of community building and building all these relationships and seeing these people who we talk about in the headlines actually in person.

581
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:56,000
But it's not for everybody. I get that. So anyways, let's end it on something positive.

582
00:52:56,000 --> 00:53:05,000
And I want to say thank you to the Coder QA team. Last episode, we announced that we were launching a membership program to help keep the show sustainable.

583
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:13,000
And we would include a few perks for those members. And you can go to Coder QA dot co if you want to sign up.

584
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:20,000
You get what I'm calling a very limited ad feed. There are some contractually obligated ads in there, but they're very they're tight and tidy.

585
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:30,000
But it's essentially ad free, but it's fully produced and edited otherwise with the full mix. And it's available when you sign up at Coder QA dot co.

586
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:35,000
And I just want to say thank you to everybody who became part of the Coder QA team. Now we have next.

587
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:40,000
I say the end of this quarter, right? That's when you need to do our code early.

588
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:44,000
Did I get it? You code early. You got it. This is our new thing.

589
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:50,000
We're doing West is we launched a membership program to help cover the production cost of the show and keep it sustainable.

590
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:55,000
And as a thank you to the Coder QA team, we have the ad free feed with limited ads.

591
00:53:55,000 --> 00:54:04,000
And we have the quarterly coderly quarterly update where we'll look back at trends and news items and stories from the show and kind of do a recap.

592
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:12,000
I love that. Yeah. Yeah. I'm also I am kind of cooking up other ideas for the membership stuff like annual shows.

593
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:18,000
And if you're a member of any of the programs you would get and kind of other perks that are just applicable to all members.

594
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:23,000
So you've been thinking about it. I don't know if there's any more Jar Jar coupons.

595
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:30,000
I forgot to check before we went on air, but you can try coupon Jar Jar to get to get it knocked the two dollars off knocked up.

596
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:35,000
Boom, not just cut it right off. Crazy Chris is cutting two dollars off if you use promo code Jar Jar, although it may be all used up.

597
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:41,000
But go to Coder QA dot co to find out. And then it's just six dollars a month forever as long as you keep it active.

598
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:44,000
Thank you to everybody who did sign up for that. It was really nice.

599
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:49,000
And so it's super nice because, you know, not everything is in place yet.

600
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:56,000
Right. Like we don't really have a long runway at the moment, and it's not a certain future by any stretch of the imagination.

601
00:54:56,000 --> 00:55:07,000
And if it wasn't for the goodwill of the community and the great folks behind the scenes that help make it all possible, like Mike and Wes and and others.

602
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:15,000
I don't think I could even be attempting something like this at this point in time, but I'm hoping that we've got the right recipe.

603
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:19,000
We've got the right combination of people and we've got the right support from the community.

604
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:25,000
So it's really, really nice to see people jumping on the Coder QA team, Coder QA dot co.

605
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:28,000
And that's all I have for that. Mike, you got anything you want to send people to?

606
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:34,000
I know you said you might have a job opening soon. Where where would people be best to like stay tuned for that kind of thing?

607
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:38,000
I would go to themadbotter.com or follow me on Twitter at Dumanuco.

608
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:41,000
Excellent. Excellent. I can do that. That's easy enough.

609
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:45,000
There are host bio links in the show notes, too, which will take you to Mike's Twitter.

610
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:52,000
Mr. Payne, we ought to plug Linux unplugged the double recording on Sunday, which is the 12th, I think, or the 13th.

611
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:55,000
It is the 13th. Yeah, we've got a double coming up.

612
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:59,000
Yeah. So check the calendar on Sunday, the 13th.

613
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:02,000
We're doing an extra Linux unplugged if you like to do the live thing.

614
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:07,000
And of course, we'll have a regular episode. You can catch Wes and I on Linux unplugged every single Tuesday.

615
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:10,000
The same bat time, really. Just a different bat day.

616
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:13,000
You can do it at noon over there as well at jblive.tv.

617
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:17,000
You can follow the show at Coder Radio Show on Twitter.

618
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:28,000
We also have links to the membership at Coder dot show, links to everything we talked about, including stories and more at Coder dot show slash 378.

619
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:33,000
Thanks so much for tuning this week's episode of the Coder Radio program. We'll see you right back here next week.
