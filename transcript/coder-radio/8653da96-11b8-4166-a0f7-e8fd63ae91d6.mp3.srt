00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
This is KOTOR Radio, episode 449 for January 17th, 2022.

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Hello friends and welcome back to Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show,

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
taking a pragmatic look at the art and the business of software development

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
and the world of technology.

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
My name is Chris and joining us right now, right at his microphone,

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
it's our host, Mr. Dominic. Hello, Mike.

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Hello, hello, hello.

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Oh, listen to you. You sound good. You sound strong. You sound well fed.

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm well fed. I'm on 64 gigs of RAM on my Pangolin.

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I am rocking it out. As my son would say, I am rocking this party.

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Let's go. That's what my son says all the time. Everything's let's go.

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I think it's a YouTube thing.

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Mine is, let's rock. He saw Sing, the old one, the first one.

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
And I guess somebody must say, let's rock this party.

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Okay. All right. Okay. Now I was just making references to,

16
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
here I am scrolling on my Twitter and Twitter really wants me to see

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
your delicious steak that you're grilling up these days.

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
It was epic.

19
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I kind of feel like you're on a roll with the food.

20
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I mean, have you entered a new phase of like cooking?

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Is this like our buddy Brent, he likes to cook to like clear his mind, right?

22
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
He gets Zen when he's cooking.

23
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I love grilling. And since I live in Florida, otherwise known as,

24
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
is it summer still?

25
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Is it always summer there? I don't,

26
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I can't remember the last time I saw the sky to be honest with you.

27
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I put on a sweater and long pants because it was 60 degrees.

28
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
You bastard.

29
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
And it wasn't just a sweater. Can we still say this?

30
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
It was full on Cosby sweater. Like it was, it wasn't like a light little thing.

31
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
No, it was.

32
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Well, can I just say that I really liked that visual.

33
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I mean, my Cosby sweater grilling.

34
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Yes. Yes.

35
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
And I slept in the, in the coder robe,

36
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
which I will say for heat retention is what you want.

37
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Oh yeah.

38
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
You want to wrap an Xbox 360 in it.

39
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
People who come visit me at the studio have to just live with the fact that I'm

40
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
rocking a robe all the time.

41
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
They just got to get their heads around that cause it's, it's what's happening.

42
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,000
So we got some emails into the show from last week's episode.

43
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
We kind of were given the wall street journal a hard time for saying that Apple

44
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
was bullying people with the blue dots in iMessage.

45
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Well, Liam writes in and he says the green shame is real.

46
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,000
He says, Hey geezers, as someone who went to high school, the post in the post

47
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:31,000
iPhone world, I can confirm the green bubble bullying does exist for the clicks

48
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
that care iPhones are a status symbol.

49
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
And in some people's eyes, you'll be seen as quote a poor.

50
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
If you don't send blue bubbles, he goes on to point out that, yeah, of course,

51
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
SMS and MMS is a huge disaster.

52
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Google is incompetent, but he wraps it up with this.

53
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
It's Americans' refusals to abandon SMS.

54
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Apple wanted to do more than SMS offered and saw a fantastic way to market their

55
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
platform.

56
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Google wanted to copy their success, but got bored after a few years.

57
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,000
The problem with both platforms is SMS was still dragged along to communicate

58
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
with each other.

59
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I've managed to convert most of my friends to Telegram over the years, but I

60
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,000
doubt most Americans will ever switch away from SMS, iMessage or whatever a big

61
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
platform slash market buys next.

62
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
We had several in this regard, but we had one more that I thought we should touch

63
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
on.

64
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Isn't people rejecting green bubbles?

65
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Aren't they actually rejecting the crappy functionality of SMS?

66
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Isn't that what's actually happening?

67
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
And it's represented as a green bubble.

68
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
And perhaps they don't understand that it's the show that is SMS.

69
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
But that's really what's happening is consumers are saying you're degrading our

70
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
experience.

71
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
We want everyone to have a blue bubble.

72
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
And then what they're really saying is we don't want anybody using SMS.

73
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I mean, teenagers, I know a lot's changed in the world, but teenagers are still

74
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
kind of dicks, right?

75
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
And always have been.

76
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
So if it wasn't this, I think they would just find something else.

77
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I mean, I remember when I was a kid, the BMX biking was like the new thing,

78
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
right?

79
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
You know, the Dave Muir, all that kind of stuff.

80
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Sure.

81
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
The rich kids like had the whatever.

82
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I don't remember the name of the brand right now, but the brand name bike,

83
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
right?

84
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,000
You know, the fancy bike was whatever Tony Hawk's brand of skateboard,

85
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
all that kind of crap.

86
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
And the normal kids had like Walmart, right?

87
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Like Mongoose was the Walmart brand.

88
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I guess I feel like kids are just jerks and are going to make fun of kids who

89
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
don't have what they have.

90
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
There is an element of that.

91
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,000
So Rundle wrote in and said, you know, it's really bad in the group chats.

92
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
One on one, you know, it's not so bad the platforms can kind of coexist.

93
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
But in group chats, that's kind of where the whole bullying dynamic gets

94
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,000
created because it's sort of it's an inclusion issue where some don't really

95
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
get to participate and some even get excluded from a group chat because they

96
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
don't have the functionality.

97
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
And we also had a listener write in that said that they are aware of stories

98
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
where teenagers threaten self-harm if they didn't get iPhones because there's

99
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
so much social pressure around this.

100
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,000
The general sentiment was you and I were just not young enough to appreciate

101
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
how much of a real issue this is.

102
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:08,000
But I'm still not convinced by any of these emails that Apple necessarily has

103
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
a special blame here.

104
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,000
First of all, they invested billions to make their brand kind of a prestigious

105
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,000
brand, and they built a good user experience.

106
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:22,000
And what's the point of doing all that if not to leverage it all to create

107
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
something that people like more than SMS?

108
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Google wishes they could do this, right?

109
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
They wish they were in this position, and they absolutely would be trying to

110
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
keep people on their own chat platform if they could.

111
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
And since we've been on the air, they've launched two more chat platforms.

112
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:40,000
What would obviously solve this, and I think would be a very savvy move on

113
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Apple's part, is release an iMessage app for Android.

114
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I know there was those emails where they debated it, and that's where some of

115
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
this bullying angle comes from.

116
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
So I'm in this place where we had a few listeners who were kind of like,

117
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
okay, old guys, but this is upsetting and it's bad for us.

118
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:00,000
And I don't want to poop on their experiences here.

119
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:05,000
But is this not the same thing, and I can use an example because there's a

120
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
teenage girl who lives in my house and I now understand the horror that is

121
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:15,000
that, you know, who has the coach bag versus the insert generic target brand

122
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
here, right?

123
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Isn't it like the same thing or just like, you know, who has the PS5?

124
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:28,000
It just feels like normal kid crap that I'm happy to blame Apple for lots of

125
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
stuff, but this is like they did a good job.

126
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:36,000
They made the luxury version of the product, and now you're asking them to

127
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
not be a luxury brand.

128
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,000
It's like, would you ask Neiman Marcus to be more like Walmart because like

129
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Neiman Marcus is fancy and people might be snooty about it.

130
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
One aspect of this is having kids myself.

131
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I've watched them as they get older become aware of brands.

132
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
You know, they kind of go from being completely oblivious to brands or such

133
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
a thing to becoming aware of brands.

134
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:00,000
And then in some cases, giving a lot of thought of what brands do I like?

135
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
You know, that's an interesting psychological thing that they go through

136
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
where they start kind of attaching themselves to different brands as time

137
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
goes on and thinking about it from that perspective.

138
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
So I can understand the cultural issue there.

139
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:16,000
But the other thing that's difficult here is if it's that big of an issue.

140
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Well, then I mean, like I got my kids an iPod touch on eBay for 80 bucks.

141
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,000
An iPhone XR is still a fantastic phone.

142
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
It's going to get updates for years.

143
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
You can get it for $180 on eBay.

144
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I don't even really buy the price argument really.

145
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I can only really understand two reasons why people wouldn't do it.

146
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Philosophical, they refuse to participate in Apple or they don't know.

147
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
They're uneducated.

148
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:51,000
They are an uneducated consumer and that is rife with issues.

149
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I could think of another reason, actually, for a kid.

150
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I know this is like blasphemy, especially for a tech dude.

151
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I don't and maybe I'll beat my words.

152
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I don't know that giving young kids smartphones is appropriate.

153
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
But if they're on an Android device and they have green bubbles,

154
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
I think that's already been that that hurdles already been.

155
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Well, you've already right. You've OK. You've already crossed that line.

156
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Yeah. Then when does it stop?

157
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Are you buying like a bootleg console now?

158
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Like you saw you saw the email that the listener wrote in that said that

159
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:23,000
they know of a kid that got a brand new brand new Galaxy

160
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
and they wanted to take him back for an iPhone.

161
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I don't know. I mean, Apple did a good job with branding.

162
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Yeah, I'm still struggling. It feels really like Google blew it and Apple didn't.

163
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
And now what happens is people kind of I hate this.

164
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:45,000
But human nature seems to be to like use shame to get people to adopt the cultural norms.

165
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:50,000
And it's gross. But what we and we kind of notice it when it happens in a new area.

166
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
But we kind of turn a blind eye once we've all kind of adopted that new norm

167
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
and we don't really pay attention and notice it anymore.

168
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
And I don't like it at all.

169
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:02,000
And I think in part why things like WhatsApp and Telegram do really well.

170
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
And I think one of the reasons why they do really well outside the states

171
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,000
is because SMS and Americans it was a weird adoption with texting.

172
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
It took us a while to get it.

173
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
And when we finally did get it, it was SMS that stuck.

174
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Where other nations kind of took cellular technology to a new level faster.

175
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,000
They adopted it at a different point and they adopted messaging a lot faster as well.

176
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
And so when something like WhatsApp or Telegram comes along,

177
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
they're really proficient in these domains.

178
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Where Americans are kind of stuck in the early days of cell with our carriers,

179
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
with the way we treat our phones, all of it.

180
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,000
In fact, there's even still really just unspoken weird norms between generations.

181
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I'm shocked when my phone just rings and somebody's calling me out of nowhere,

182
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
which is generally somebody, one of the older members of my family.

183
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Because anybody my age usually sends me a text first, say, hey, are you around?

184
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Can we chat?

185
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
You know, we usually do that kind of thing.

186
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
And then, you know, and my kids, my kids, they don't really ever call each other

187
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
unless they're gaming.

188
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
And then they FaceTime each other.

189
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,000
It's like they have the weird, they're always texting unless it's gaming time.

190
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I've noticed that it's so strange to me.

191
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,000
The solution is, is to educate people to get off of any of these proprietary

192
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
platform specific chat applications.

193
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Oh, dude.

194
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Do some research, find the one that works for you and move.

195
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:16,000
You know, it just takes somebody in your group to have a little leadership.

196
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
We've drug people between Viber and Slack and Telegram.

197
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I mean, like, you know, it's just, you've got to just set a path

198
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
and get people to move.

199
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I know it sounds impossible, especially with kids.

200
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I'm being idealistic there, but Discord has gotten, has picked up a lot of this too.

201
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Yeah.

202
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
You know, Discord has benefited a lot.

203
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
So we're seeing a real fracturing in the market.

204
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,000
People, I think around our age, at least in my family and kind of friend group,

205
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:45,000
are using like Slack or Teams, literally depending on what their organization bought, right?

206
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:50,000
There's weirdos like me and you who still use IRC, but that's such a dying.

207
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I mean, but all the younger folks that I know, especially my like teenagers, like relatives,

208
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
they're in Discord all damn day, all day.

209
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
And it's like their one program, Discord, their one chat program.

210
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Yeah.

211
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
It's Slack for all the casuals.

212
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Right.

213
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Listener Chris writes in, and we were talking last week about FakerJS and ColorJS

214
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,000
and how they took down the GitHub account and kind of brought us onto the topic

215
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
of how we've really more and more over the years landed on,

216
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
if you really need something, you got to host it yourself.

217
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:24,000
And listener Chris writes, I agree, but isn't there a way to enjoy the best of both worlds?

218
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Like for example, put your code up on GitHub and then mirror it on your own instance

219
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,000
with GitLab or GitT or whatever you use so that when they do take it down,

220
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
it's their loss, not yours.

221
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Is there a sweet spot?

222
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,000
When I thought about this question, I tried to zoom it out to, you know, small operations,

223
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,000
but operations like yours and mine have infrastructure, you know,

224
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
so that means more infrastructure.

225
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Where do you draw the line?

226
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Something I've been thinking about recently,

227
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,000
as we're rebuilding a couple of our servers here at the studio,

228
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:00,000
we have nearly 45 servers in the cloud, and we have one server now,

229
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,000
and we're going to two, maybe even three servers here in the studio for storage purposes,

230
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
just to kind of cache stuff locally.

231
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
So my infrastructure and how much I'm willing to invest in all of this

232
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
and where I allocate, that's all been on my mind recently,

233
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
especially, I guess, because it's the beginning of the year,

234
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:19,000
and I'm thinking like, okay, this is the time to really sort this out.

235
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,000
You know, more and more, I find myself going more towards self-hosting.

236
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I used to be cloud all the things.

237
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Now I'm kind of getting, well, but, you know, in the cloud,

238
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
somebody else ultimately holds the data and gets to decide when,

239
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:38,000
if ever things get deleted, hint, it's almost never,

240
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,000
you have to pay an ongoing fee, and if you have the expertise at some point,

241
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,000
so like I self-host GitLab, right, and it just ends up being cheaper

242
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:51,000
for what I need than using GitHub, you know, enterprise.

243
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Now granted, I self-host GitLab CE, so that's whatever.

244
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,000
The big thing I think is my email, and the problem with that,

245
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:04,000
it's so hard to get out of Google for a business once you've been in it for years

246
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
that I don't even know how I would do that migration.

247
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Yeah, I hear you on that.

248
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Because there's like documents, there's contracts, there's documentation.

249
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
You mess the DNS up and you don't get email for a couple of days.

250
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Right.

251
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Well, and it's just having that searchability and drive, honestly,

252
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:23,000
to be like, you know, this customer came back from like a year and a half ago

253
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
and they want an update, I don't even remember like this, you know,

254
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
what we did, right, what the configuration was.

255
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,000
So being able to go and see, oh, okay, so this is running like Python, whatever,

256
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Rails, whatever, go from there.

257
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Having said that, I find myself more and more kind of creeped out

258
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,000
by just the pent-opticon I appear to be living in.

259
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,000
I think if I were to do it all over again, if there was like a, you know,

260
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,000
we did Alice in Wonderland this time, so let's say like a Wizard of Oz

261
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
themed company, it probably would be self-hosted.

262
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
And I would listen to self-hosted every week to get my tips.

263
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Heyo, self-hosted.show.

264
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,000
I have a lot more comfort with something that, say, I host up on Linode

265
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:11,000
that I build or install the application and I run a thing there

266
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:16,000
than something where I go to a company and I pay a service for that application.

267
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,000
I think in part because it feels more like my own infrastructure.

268
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,000
But where it gets tricky for me is the sweet spot for self-hosting

269
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:30,000
is things that require a lot of storage or we're also considering

270
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,000
doing some of our encoding here just because then we don't even have to

271
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
bring the files up to the cloud, we can just do it all here,

272
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
which would have some advantages.

273
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
So we're looking at that kind of workflow stuff and where to kind of

274
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
split the difference.

275
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:47,000
And over the night, one of the services that is hosted on,

276
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
I don't want to out them because they're friends of the show,

277
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
our website's old.

278
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:58,000
It's been running on this service for, I don't know, 12 years.

279
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
It's old school.

280
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
A friend of the network set it up for us over there,

281
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
really helped us out a lot over the years.

282
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:11,000
But there was like an explosion in Canada last night and it took out

283
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
their fiber lines to their data center.

284
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:17,000
So the Jupiter Broadcasting website was down from about the point

285
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:21,000
we published Linux Unplugged until about 4 a.m. this morning.

286
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
That stinks, right?

287
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:27,000
And it's like one point of failure and it's on an old stack.

288
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:32,000
And my thought right there was if I was self-hosting this,

289
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:37,000
I would just probably spin this up on another Linode in a different area

290
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
or something or I would fire it up here and open up the port.

291
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:48,000
You have that kind of self-control and governance when you have that.

292
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,000
There's not much I could do other than – well, I couldn't –

293
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,000
the backups are stored there too actually now that I think about it.

294
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
That's not good.

295
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
But so yeah, I don't even really have a –

296
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
I couldn't really even get to the backup.

297
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
It's stored on a different system,

298
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
but you still have to connect to the same data center.

299
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
So yeah, there's not much I could do and I just had to wait it out.

300
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
And considering an explosion knocked it out

301
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:13,000
and they got it back up within 24 hours, I suppose that's a good thing.

302
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,000
But it made me think a little bit about in the future

303
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
when we address that old infrastructure, which we're going to try to do this year,

304
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:23,000
how do I really want to run it and do I want to self-host?

305
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
And I think I do.

306
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
I think for that, for our website, I think I do

307
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
because I want to do something a lot simpler too.

308
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
So it shouldn't be a big bunch of overhead.

309
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
I don't know.

310
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
I'm still on the fence.

311
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
I'd like to know what the audience thinks too.

312
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Yeah.

313
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,000
One last email before we wrap up the feedback section.

314
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Josh writes it.

315
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Hey guys, I recently found out about JetBrains' new VS Code competitor, Fleet.

316
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Right now it's in closed beta, but there's a few videos out there showcasing it.

317
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
What are your thoughts on it?

318
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Do you think it'll replace VS Code for you guys?

319
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Keep up the good show, Josh.

320
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Would you be willing to give JetBrains' text editor, it's an IDE really, a go?

321
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Yeah, I'm definitely going to try it out.

322
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Am I going to drop VS Code?

323
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Probably not.

324
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,000
I mean, I'm always looking for the best tool for the job.

325
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:15,000
You know, as we've said for going on 13 years now,

326
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:20,000
I have to say for a paid tool, they have a hell of a bar to hit.

327
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Yeah.

328
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Since VS Code has effectively replaced PyCharm and RubyMine for me,

329
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
which are also JetBrains products.

330
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:31,000
And clearly they need a Mario extension, you know, to compete with VS Code.

331
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Yes.

332
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
That's so great.

333
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,000
And I'll be amazed if Nintendo hasn't DMCA'd it yet,

334
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,000
but that you can place the original Mario Brothers in VS Code.

335
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
It's a TypeScript extension.

336
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Yeah, that's pretty great.

337
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Okay, so there's like weird innovation and competition going on in the text editor.

338
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:53,000
And honestly, the terminal space, I didn't even put this in the doc because I was lazy today,

339
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:58,000
but I'm using a terminal that Wes recommended called Tabby when I'm on Linux.

340
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
It's pretty good.

341
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
And I'm using Warp on Mac.

342
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,000
I don't know what's going on, but dev tools have never been better.

343
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,000
So to answer the writer's question, yeah, I'm definitely going to try Fleet.

344
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:13,000
And if it hits a, you know, a spot that I need it, I'll use it.

345
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:17,000
I mean, I have no, you know, like weird loyalty to VS Code.

346
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:22,000
I just, you know, the big caveat is VS Code is free.

347
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Yeah, the real question is what does it take now to unseat VS Code?

348
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
How good does the product have to be?

349
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
They do have a few things in here.

350
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:37,000
They have it built in to connect to remote machines and do like the build on a remote machine.

351
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:41,000
They have Google Docs like integration, so you can create a shared workspace.

352
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:46,000
You can have people join yours, real time collaboration in there, that kind of stuff.

353
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
It's all integrated.

354
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:53,000
And of course, they write built from scratch based on 20 years of our experience developing IDEs.

355
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
And of course, they've baked in IntelliJ, so that's all in there.

356
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Yeah, I mean, it's a Java editor, right?

357
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Like all their products are, so that's fine, I guess.

358
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
VS Code is like, I don't know.

359
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
It just seems like such a high par.

360
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Yeah.

361
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,000
And I really want it to work.

362
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
But I'm trying to think, like, what would they have to?

363
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Okay, the only annoying thing in VS Code is the same annoying thing I think all the apps have on Linux.

364
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,000
That it doesn't seem like it's zoomed in right.

365
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
It's always seems small.

366
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Thank you.

367
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Freaking thank you.

368
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:33,000
I feel like I'm an old man going into the accessibility and it's still not all, even when I crank it up, it's still not appropriate.

369
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
It's something not right.

370
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
But it's fine on Mac, which is weird.

371
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
It's like, fine.

372
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
It adopts the system.

373
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:47,000
But on Linux, like I ended up pumping the font up until I realized there's just a, it's like control plus to zoom in the editor section.

374
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
And then it looks like it makes sense.

375
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
You got to do both, right?

376
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,000
You got to pump the font a little bit and then pop up the whole UI one.

377
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,000
But then sometimes I swear to God, it runs slower when you do that.

378
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
It does.

379
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
I shouldn't have said anything.

380
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:06,000
But I have a feeling that's one of those like weird Linux issues where the people like electron just doesn't really care.

381
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Here's what they say about fleet in the frequently asked questions.

382
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
The question is, will fleet be open source?

383
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Here's their answer.

384
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:18,000
No, we are considering open sourcing parts of the product or the technology behind it.

385
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Stay tuned for details.

386
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Doesn't that sound like open court?

387
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Yeah, we can't call it that.

388
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,000
No, they're going to open source enough that people build extension because that's really the strength of VSCode, right?

389
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Is that somebody literally took the time to write a Mario extension.

390
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Yeah.

391
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
God bless them.

392
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Good luck.

393
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Linode.com slash coder.

394
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Go there to get $100 in 60 day credit and you go there to support the show.

395
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:51,000
If you just need a simple personal server for a blog or a portfolio, maybe a game server or you're looking to set up a VPN, you can trust Linode has you covered.

396
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:57,000
But if your business needs something that's reliable and can scale when you go viral, well, Linode can help there as well.

397
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:01,000
In fact, they reliably serve millions of visitors every single day.

398
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:08,000
And unlike entry level hosting services that lock you into their platform, Linode gives you the full back end access and customize.

399
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
So you can control your server in a way that fits your needs.

400
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:15,000
And over time, I've only had to do that a couple of times where I've really got down to the metal.

401
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:20,000
But I've always been impressed with what they let me do and what they trust their users with.

402
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,000
And their DNS manager allows you to easily switch your domain over to a new server.

403
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:29,000
You can manage SSL certificates and all of the tooling is open source.

404
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Their back end is fast.

405
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
They have 11 data centers for you to choose from.

406
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,000
In fact, they could be perfect for a multi cloud strategy in that regard as well.

407
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,000
So why not try that $100 to test it out?

408
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Maybe use it as an opportunity to performance test your network because they have 40 gigabit connections coming into their systems.

409
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
So you could really test things and learn about things.

410
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:54,000
And they have tutorials to help you get up and going like with something like Iper, for example, if you do want to do some diagnostics.

411
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,000
We use it for everything we've deployed in the last two and a half years.

412
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,000
And with pricing 30% to 50% cheaper than other major cloud providers,

413
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:07,000
it's kind of obvious why 66% of companies out there are looking to save money with a mix of alternative cloud providers

414
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:11,000
instead of relying on just one locked in hyperscaler.

415
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Go check out Linode, support the show and get $100 to kick the tires. linode.com slash coder.

416
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Do you have a home server?

417
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:27,000
The concept maybe is a little normal now, especially for developers or people in IT.

418
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:32,000
But there was a time where Microsoft was trying to sell a product called the home server.

419
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
And I got a little audio for you guys.

420
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
This is something really special.

421
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Picture Microsoft trying to convince the general public that they need a server at home.

422
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Hey, Billy. Daddy and I brought home a Windows Home Server to help organize our family.

423
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
What's that?

424
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Well, Billy, a server is...

425
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Me! I'm a stay-at-home server!

426
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Wow!

427
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Let's go, Billy. I'll show you what a stay-at-home server is all about.

428
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
I'll have him home by dinner.

429
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Eh, keep him till morning.

430
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Okay.

431
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Servers work in offices, helping to connect and protect the information of the people who work there.

432
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Why don't you work in an office?

433
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Your home is my office.

434
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:21,000
I work for your family, doing the same types of things that those servers do in the office.

435
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:25,000
They think they're so special with their striped pantaloons and business jargon.

436
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Staying home is a full-time job!

437
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Okay, let's go.

438
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Now, with Windows Home Server, your grandma can see pictures from your last soccer game she missed.

439
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
She had Bridge Club.

440
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Well, grandma did lose some dough on a pony named Bridge.

441
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
I love ponies!

442
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
So does grandma.

443
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:51,000
So that was Microsoft's, like, convince you to buy a Home Server ad from back in the day.

444
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
And I got one of these things. Did you ever see these?

445
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:58,000
They were about a book tall, they weren't very big, and you could stuff several drives in them?

446
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
I mean, I know about the meme, but...

447
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:07,000
It was a typical Microsoft thing, where they tried to work with a few OEMs, so HP put out a bunch of hype, a couple of others did,

448
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:11,000
and then Microsoft, I think, worked with HP to produce this Home Server,

449
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:18,000
and they even did a special version of Windows Server where they pooled the disk together and they created media shares,

450
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:22,000
and that's how I could stream videos to my PlayStation for a bit.

451
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:28,000
And the product wasn't really that bad, but only about two years in or so, Microsoft eventually killed it,

452
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:34,000
even though a rather large community grew up that was deploying and developing applications to run on it,

453
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,000
and there was a whole ecosystem being created.

454
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:42,000
But Microsoft just felt like they couldn't convince the public to run a Home Server.

455
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:49,000
And now here we are, you know, some seven or eight years later, maybe ten years, and self-hosting,

456
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:54,000
and people running things on a Raspberry Pi or a spare PC is more popular than ever.

457
00:24:54,000 --> 00:25:01,000
You have things like Plex, and there's a ginormous category of open-source applications

458
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,000
just for the purpose of running on people's home network on their Home Server.

459
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
So do you have anything like this at home?

460
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Kind of. I mean, it's not used for the family, but I have a Mac Mini build server.

461
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
You don't throw Plex on there or something?

462
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:18,000
No, I always want to get into the Plex thing, and then I'm too lazy to actually...

463
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Oh, it's great. Jellyfin, also quite great. Free version.

464
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Which one is Jellyfin?

465
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Jellyfin is essentially a community rebuild of Plex without the subscription parts.

466
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Oh.

467
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Yeah, and I think Plex has a little bit more polish,

468
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:38,000
but Plex also has to kind of go down the rabbit hole of trying to look legitimate,

469
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,000
so they're trying to do lots of partnerships with junky movies and streaming stuff,

470
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:45,000
and Jellyfin doesn't bother with any of that. Just let you stream your stuff on your server.

471
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,000
So Jellyfin's like, put all your pirated sh** on me and we'll be fine.

472
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
Great.

473
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,000
But something that I've been wondering, and I think this would be something the audience

474
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:56,000
probably could give us some feedback on, is I'm considering taking a box

475
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:01,000
and just setting it up as a VM server, probably using something called Proxmox,

476
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:07,000
which is essentially a Linux distro that just creates a tool that you can create new VMs

477
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:13,000
or containers on. It gives you a whole web UI to manage everything, kind of like VMware ESX.

478
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Then I thought from there I could do a lot of fun experimentation stuff,

479
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
but I don't really have anything specific in mind yet,

480
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:25,000
but that's kind of where I'm drifting towards is a big VM server with some storage,

481
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:31,000
and then just spin up stuff, testing on demand, that kind of thing.

482
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:35,000
But I'll put a link to that. Mommy, why is there a server in the house animation video?

483
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:38,000
There's some weird innuendos in there.

484
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:42,000
I think Microsoft was trying to like shock people a little bit to get them to share it.

485
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:47,000
Yeah, the mom being like, keep them overnight. I'm like, I don't know about that.

486
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Yeah, and then like the grandma really likes ponies.

487
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
And then there's like another one later on.

488
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Because grandpa's on like a horse. Is that what you're going for?

489
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:58,000
No, no, I don't think so. My God, dude. I don't know.

490
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
I don't know what the implication was.

491
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,000
Listen, Balmer did a lot of weird shit.

492
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:06,000
I was going to mention too that Blizzard just did a big layoff.

493
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,000
They just laid off like 40 employees or something like that recently.

494
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Wow. Yeah, I don't know what's going on.

495
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,000
I don't know if it's, I think it's some like scandal thing.

496
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,000
I don't think it's like a financial thing.

497
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Aren't they in like trouble again?

498
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Because they're Activision, right? Doesn't Activision own Blizzard?

499
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,000
I think so.

500
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:26,000
Yeah, so they're in some kind of, I don't, we were the wrong show to talk about this.

501
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:32,000
But I could have sworn they got in some kind of like legal issue with the state of California.

502
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,000
Oh, probably. That sounds about right. That sounds about right.

503
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Speaking of getting in trouble in the state of California, a Twitter thread cropped up just a little bit

504
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:46,000
after we recorded last week that were screenshots of emails from Apple execs where they're basically debating,

505
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:52,000
I think we should be getting a 30% cut of Lyft and Uber's membership programs.

506
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:58,000
Like not just in-app purchases, but the membership programs that of course,

507
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,000
they knew Uber and Lyft were inevitably about to launch.

508
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
So that is about to happen.

509
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:07,000
June 26, 2018, Apple's going back and forth debating if they should get a cut or not.

510
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Like they're the king, you know?

511
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:16,000
Yeah, so it's also Monday and I saw you taking a victory lap.

512
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:22,000
Listen, I have been a bit of a B-I-T-C-H about this because I was right the entire time.

513
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:27,000
And yeah, so they want to put up a little toll booth and be on the iPhone and be like,

514
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,000
yo, you're taking money. We'll take 30% of that.

515
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
Oh, or maybe 15. Sorry.

516
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:37,000
So, you know, around the world, there is a lot of legal action against Apple and Google.

517
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:43,000
Some of it is in regards to how in-app purchases are handled, if third-party payment services are allowed.

518
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:46,000
This has happened in South Korea. It's happened in the Netherlands.

519
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:54,000
And we have some details on how Apple and Google plan to handle this kind of situation

520
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:58,000
where they have to, by law, allow a third-party payment system.

521
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,000
And it's truly twisted.

522
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:04,000
You know, it's brilliant. It's amazing.

523
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:07,000
It is. It's diabolical.

524
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Apple's approach to allowing third-party payments for in-app purchases in the Netherlands

525
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,000
will follow Google's approach in South Korea.

526
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:21,000
So, like we expected on the show, Google set the framework with their approach in South Korea,

527
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:28,000
exactly like we called it, and now Apple is going to allow developers to use these third-party payment systems,

528
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:33,000
and they will still need to pay Apple a fee, even if they use Stripe, etc.

529
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:37,000
And when you consider that they still have to pay Apple a fee,

530
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:42,000
and now they have to pay Stripe a fee in total, they're going to be paying more.

531
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,000
Apple and Google are going to tell developers, basically,

532
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:49,000
fine, instead of giving us a 30% cut, the fee is now 26%.

533
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:55,000
Once you give Stripe their 2.9% and plus 30% per transaction with a worse user experience,

534
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
you're overall going to be worse off.

535
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:03,000
It's a diabolical way where Apple and Google have figured out a way to meet the letter of the law, but not the spirit.

536
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:06,000
So you essentially end up as a developer paying more.

537
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:11,000
You get a worse user experience, and Apple and Google get to claim that they followed the law

538
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:15,000
and that they're all good. They can go back now to their work.

539
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:23,000
You have to at least appreciate the truly satanic level of elegance in this system,

540
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:26,000
because you know that they're also going to have some API,

541
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,000
that all these third-party processors have to use.

542
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:35,000
Just like when you get a W2 or a 1099, the IRS already knows what you made.

543
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:39,000
There's literally no reason for you to fill out a tax return unless you own a business.

544
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:43,000
But they want to see if you're going to try to lie, and they're going to fine you.

545
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:50,000
Apple's just going to let you fork yourself over, and they may in fact make more money.

546
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:54,000
Seriously, it's unbelievable.

547
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,000
Yeah, it's just now Stripe also gets a piece of the pie.

548
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:02,000
And your 2.9% goes right to hell the minute somebody whips out an Amex, by the way.

549
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:06,000
Oh, man. Way to go.

550
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
It's beautiful.

551
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:13,000
The message kind of is, is don't f*** with us because this is what we're going to do, and you're going to be worse off.

552
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:16,000
Yeah, I mean, they effectively won the Epic case, right?

553
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Like, they won. I don't know what to say. They're going to win.

554
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,000
We have thoughts about the EU, Ms. Nuland, if you're there.

555
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:28,000
Wow, really? I don't know. I mean, is that? OK, I'm going to do it, but...

556
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
F*** the EU.

557
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,000
That's right.

558
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:34,000
Nobody's going to get that reference, though. You know, they're just going to think we're, you know...

559
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
You know, people really don't get it.

560
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:41,000
I tried to explain to some folks who were over this weekend why I find that so hilarious.

561
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:46,000
And they asked me if I've been, like, doing crack. So that's how that conversation ended.

562
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,000
Victoria Nuland. That's who you go look up. Victoria Nuland. You can look it up.

563
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Do you know what else Ms. Nuland would hate?

564
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,000
What?

565
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
AR and VR headsets, baby.

566
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
That's true. That's very true.

567
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:07,000
Yeah, what do you think of this? The rumor is M1 Pro-like performance, 8K display, and a $2,000 price tag for an Apple AR VR headset.

568
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:12,000
This is coming from Gurman. So, of course, everybody in the Apple community snapped up and listened.

569
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:18,000
I mean, I have not yet been convinced that this is something anybody should want. So...

570
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,000
True.

571
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:24,000
I totally buy, like, the HoloLens, the enterprise, like, industrial use for these things.

572
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:29,000
And I think that's very, very interesting and, like, a cool place for development.

573
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:32,000
So gaming would be the obvious use, right? For consumers.

574
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:36,000
Yeah, you know they're going to lean on the Apple Arcade developers to port over.

575
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,000
Have you played many Apple Arcade game circuits?

576
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:42,000
I mean, a couple of them are good. A couple of them.

577
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
Yeah, I mean, two grand is a lot of money.

578
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:50,000
Oh, I agree. The price needs to be $600 all-in, like, with accessories that you need and everything.

579
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
Yeah, first of all, it'll never be $600 all-in from Apple.

580
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,000
No, no.

581
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:59,000
I mean, I feel like this is a thing where everybody wants this to happen, and by everybody I mean Apple and Facebook,

582
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:03,000
and I will go to my deathbed as calling them Facebook because that's who they are.

583
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
By the way, according to Gurman, he says,

584
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:15,000
I've been told pretty directly that the idea of a completely virtual world where users escape to, like what they might do in the meta platforms, that's off limits from Apple.

585
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,000
That's what Gurman writes.

586
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,000
So then, what is it?

587
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:22,000
I'll tell you. And I'll tell you why you're going to buy it, too.

588
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
Oh, because I'll drink too much and have my credit card out with it.

589
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
That's why I'm going to buy anything.

590
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,000
You know who the customer is? Anybody who bought AirPod Maxes.

591
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
Son of a bitch. That's me.

592
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:38,000
I know. And I'll tell you why. Imagine a world where we've actually kind of resumed travel again,

593
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:43,000
and you can slip on your AirPod Maxes and this headset.

594
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:46,000
So you got like nearly $2,800 worth of Apple gear on your head.

595
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:53,000
But when you're on the airplane, you are in the most awesome, amazing theater with great experience

596
00:33:53,000 --> 00:34:00,000
where Apple has worked with content developers and creators to create movie experiences and television experiences specifically for this device.

597
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:05,000
You've got your AirPod Maxes sound with their virtual surround sound, which is actually quite legit,

598
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
and you've got the noise canceling in there.

599
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:12,000
You have got the greatest experience for a theater on the plane you could possibly think of.

600
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,000
It's going to make traveling so much better in that regard.

601
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:20,000
Secondarily, and I've mentioned this to you before, if you had a real big Zoom culture,

602
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:25,000
everybody was doing video meetings all the time, this would be a lot better experience.

603
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:32,000
And say you could buy some like Android version for $600, and you and I could be in a virtual studio right now.

604
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:35,000
And because we don't actually have to worry about the acoustics of the virtual room,

605
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:40,000
we could even have an audience with chairs where people could come and actually attend a virtual Coda radio event

606
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,000
with you and I sitting there. I could have a virtual mixer in there.

607
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:48,000
And we could be putting on a show in a virtual reality where you could see my movements, my hand.

608
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:52,000
I'm moving my hands about right now as I talk, and you would see me doing that.

609
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:58,000
And we could flag each other. When we're doing shows in the studio, the hosts that are in studio with me,

610
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,000
we have hand gestures and flags when somebody says, hey, I want to get a word in or something like that.

611
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
Or we can just look at each other.

612
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:10,000
Just that kind of unspoken body language while you're recording makes the show flow so much smoother.

613
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:14,000
You don't have people talking over each other. There's no weird pauses. It's just fantastic.

614
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,000
And you could get that in a virtual environment, and you could have people attend.

615
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:20,000
It could be like a real thing that we put on on the regular.

616
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,000
So you kind of think about it in like the context of like company meetings

617
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:27,000
where everybody goes to a meeting or a Zoom event where you're collaborating.

618
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:30,000
And you start thinking it's already happening.

619
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:36,000
I mean, like the Home Assistant open source project was a massive project that's really moving very aggressively.

620
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:41,000
They do all of their content and development planning in VR now as a team.

621
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:46,000
They said it's been very effective because one of the things is that it's lower latency

622
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:52,000
because you're not streaming H.264 video bits. You're streaming just the positional data.

623
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
And so you get a lower latency experience as well.

624
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:58,000
And you can see when someone's looking down at their laptop or doing whatever.

625
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,000
So it's those kinds of use cases.

626
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:05,000
And I could see Apple being particularly good at it with the App Store model.

627
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:08,000
You got family sharing. You've got the fact that if you maybe buy it,

628
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:14,000
if you buy the app for your VR headset thing, you also have the iPhone equivalent thing or watch controls.

629
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,000
You could see them integrating it pretty good with the ecosystem.

630
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
Better than probably anybody else could.

631
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:24,000
So if I make a cup of coffee, are they going to charge me 30% if I'm in my VR meetings with you?

632
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
We talked about this last week. Excuse me.

633
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:31,000
I definitely could see because we live in a nightmare hellscape of a time,

634
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:36,000
us doing like a JB, I don't know, conference, right?

635
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,000
Theater.

636
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:41,000
Right. Like where we get all the hosts together and it's like I'm ragging on the BSD guys,

637
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
even though I don't think they're still around.

638
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
We have Alan there just so we can make fun of him, right?

639
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
Just so we can make fun of him.

640
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:50,000
The BSD now hasn't been shown a while, but we're going to do it anyway.

641
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:56,000
But two grand for like regular people who aren't producing content that they run ads on,

642
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:59,000
that seems, I don't know, man, it seems like a lot.

643
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,000
Way too high.

644
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,000
Especially when you know Zuck is going to give this shit away to people who don't know better.

645
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
You know that's where this has to go.

646
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:08,000
Eventually there has to be a real cheap device,

647
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:13,000
something that corporations can afford to buy four, five, six, a thousand of at a time.

648
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:18,000
Yeah. I mean, and also the idea of doing a VR meeting at the mat botter would just end up in a fight

649
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,000
about text editors and where the brackets go after an if statement.

650
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,000
So I don't.

651
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,000
Yeah. JB would be an argument about which platform to use.

652
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
As you tout Linux from your M1 Mac.

653
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,000
Right.

654
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
And I'm on the Pangolin saying how good Mac is.

655
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,000
Yes.

656
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
With my M1 powered headset with my watch.

657
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,000
Yeah.

658
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,000
With your watch.

659
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,000
It really gets kind of ridiculous.

660
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,000
I agree. And I don't I'm not convinced it's going to be successful.

661
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,000
If they could get the price right.

662
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:44,000
I could see I could see a couple of use cases in that regard.

663
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:48,000
I know this sounds really kind of dystopian, but you know, like I have a couple of grandparents.

664
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:51,000
It's like it's probably their last.

665
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:56,000
I mean, I mean, the last couple of years and I haven't seen them for two years because of COVID.

666
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
This is not going to happen.

667
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,000
This is not likely.

668
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:03,000
But, you know, a generation or two, if there's a situation where you could get together as a family

669
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
and at least be in VR, that might be better.

670
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,000
I don't know.

671
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:11,000
Because we tried the Zoom thing and it it I just wanted to get off that Zoom call so fast.

672
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:14,000
I don't know. I could see some use cases, but you're right.

673
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:17,000
Apple's going to is going to price it way too high.

674
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:21,000
But I think you have to have something that feels nice because it's going to be on you.

675
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
And I think you got to have those 8K displays.

676
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
And the other thing they're going to build in is like this.

677
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:30,000
They're going to build in, according to Gurman, support for prescription lenses, too.

678
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
I don't buy it.

679
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:35,000
You just basically took a wish list of what you would want an AR headset.

680
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:38,000
I think Gurman maybe this is what they would like to do.

681
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:43,000
You know, I feel like people have people checked Gurman's record recently.

682
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:46,000
I mean, I know I feel like he's got a one out of three right now, but I might be wrong.

683
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:53,000
I don't I mean, I don't really track it, but he's usually close, but not the details he gets.

684
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,000
And the timing.

685
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:57,000
I think he did nail the arm rollout.

686
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,000
He nailed the arm rollout.

687
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,000
Yeah, he has more on the arm.

688
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:06,000
He's he isn't he the dude who made that like super ambitious that by 2023, they're going to be all arm, including the pro.

689
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:09,000
I could absolutely see them experimenting.

690
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:14,000
I mean, if you see where this is going, this is how Apple's going to think about it.

691
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
Where else can we get the app store?

692
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
Oh, Jesus Christ.

693
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
You're right, but it's terrible, right?

694
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:24,000
Exactly. So they're from there from the perspective of where else can we deploy the app store?

695
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
Where else can I get my 30%?

696
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:30,000
Yep. All right. So just taking a breath.

697
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:33,000
People keep telling me that this is where it's going.

698
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
All this AR VR stuff.

699
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
Meta metaverse.

700
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:40,000
But is it like is there really a desire for this?

701
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:45,000
Or is this something that these companies just want to make a thing because they need a new goldmine?

702
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
Oh, very much.

703
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:52,000
Yeah. You know what it feels like is when the TV industry really wanted 3D to be a thing really bad.

704
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:56,000
They had to have that go.

705
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
Consumers are just not interested.

706
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:05,000
Honestly, when I see the art concepts of the quote unquote metaverse, it looks so much like the mid 90s,

707
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:11,000
early 90s information superhighway renderings and drawings that people fantasize the Internet might look like.

708
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
Have you read any William Gibson?

709
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,000
Yeah.

710
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
Because that's what they're talking about.

711
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:19,000
I have two thoughts really on this.

712
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:25,000
Number one is I think ultimately something in the middle of what we're looking at is what's going to shake out.

713
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:28,000
I could see with it seems like there's some trends.

714
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
You've got remote work.

715
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
You've got people looking for ways to collaborate better.

716
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,000
Like that's clear.

717
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:37,000
And there's always people looking for the ultimate content experience.

718
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:40,000
Maybe you're in the market to get a 8K television.

719
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:43,000
Well, then all of a sudden 2000 bucks doesn't seem so bad.

720
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:48,000
So you could see a couple of bits of the market on the high end where there's a justification for it.

721
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:52,000
And it's going to be eventually somewhere in a more reasonable price range, probably the cost of an iPhone.

722
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,000
Sure.

723
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
But there's a big caveat in the price there.

724
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:58,000
That 8K TV is for your entire household and friends.

725
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
That 2K is per person.

726
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:06,000
Now, I'm thinking like somebody who's just maybe they live by themselves and they got some cash to burn kind of situation.

727
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:13,000
But where I think it gets a little dystopian is it came out yesterday that Walmart has filed for trademarks

728
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:19,000
and other things at the patent office for a Walmart cryptocurrency, Walmart NFTs,

729
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:29,000
and the ability to basically sell any kind of virtual good from lawn ornaments to shoes to all everything that they sell at Walmart.

730
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,000
Now they want to sell virtually.

731
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
Oh, no.

732
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:37,000
Nike is planning to start selling virtual Nike shoes that you'll get for your virtual avatar.

733
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,000
Here's what I think it is.

734
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
And this is where it kind of gets a little dark.

735
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:44,000
I think we look around and things are kind of crumbling.

736
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:48,000
And so the idea is, well, let's just get everybody buying and selling virtual goods.

737
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:51,000
We don't have to make anything real anymore.

738
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
And we can plug people in.

739
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
We've got everybody hooked up to the Internet now.

740
00:41:55,000 --> 00:42:04,000
And they can come do these virtual things and they can live in squalor and have crap, but they can have a great virtual identity.

741
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:07,000
So we just went from William Gibson to Aldous Huxley.

742
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
Let's give them the Soma and let them chill out.

743
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:16,000
And then don't you think it's also kind of interesting when people are really concerned right now or a group of people,

744
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:22,000
you know, not everyone, but some people are very concerned about how they're perceived online, how you refer to them.

745
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
They think a lot about their avatars.

746
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:33,000
Those kind of tendencies seem like they would incline someone to want to create a virtual identity that could be anything they want it to be.

747
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:36,000
Like if I were to create a virtual avatar of myself, I might create it looking like me.

748
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:41,000
But there's probably a lot of people out there that would prefer to look like something else.

749
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:49,000
And this is going to give them that opportunity to participate in a virtual space where they can represent their true identity as they'll probably see it.

750
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:57,000
I could see that making someone inclined to want to just live in that existence because you could kind of imagine sort of the dissatisfaction when you disconnect from that

751
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:05,000
and you come back to your real life where you're actually that different physical shape or thing or whatever, right, whatever the difference might be.

752
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:08,000
You know, maybe you like to be a flying cat. I don't know.

753
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
Are you nine cat? Is that what you are?

754
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:15,000
And then when you get back in real life, you're not a flying cat. And that's pretty that's pretty boring and disappointing.

755
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:24,000
You have just described a person who is living a horrifically miserable life and probably needs some help.

756
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:29,000
And if you're right, that means these big companies are basically going to monetize despair.

757
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:32,000
They don't already. But maybe don't you think that's a sad thing?

758
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:37,000
You just like a sad kind of situation to be in.

759
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:41,000
That's why I hope it's something it's something more in between.

760
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:53,000
Like it becomes a better way for us to connect as a as a globe where we kind of treat each other more like real people like, you know, I know Optimus Gray in the chat room because I met him in Denver.

761
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,000
Oh, cool.

762
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:57,000
And I wonder if we could maybe have more.

763
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:03,000
Maybe VR would give us more of that kind of connection and maybe that'd be a good thing. So maybe there's an upside to it.

764
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:06,000
It may not go full Ready Player One, right?

765
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:10,000
That's just it seems like kind of.

766
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:14,000
You know, Nike can make unlimited virtual shoes and there's no slaves involved.

767
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:17,000
There's no environmental impact, right?

768
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
As a company, that's a lot of upside.

769
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:25,000
Yes, but not not being in the slave trade, I assume is on somebody's Excel sheet.

770
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
Oh, my God, dude, this took a turn.

771
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
Yeah, I know. I know.

772
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:33,000
And and so I think that's why Apple is trying to message it right from the very beginning.

773
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,000
We're not trying to metaverse here.

774
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:40,000
Remember the 90s when like it was going to be a decentralized network and we were all going to like live in this la la la happy.

775
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,000
We'd have our little digital storefronts.

776
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:51,000
And remember that anybody know, you know, if this were really to happen, don't you think there would just be a counter movement to like embrace real life and exercise?

777
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:57,000
Like you almost wonder if you wouldn't have like a counter movement begin that actually gains momentum.

778
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
Like nothing ever just happens like this.

779
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:06,000
There's always naysayers and, you know, just never is never a smooth transition where we just all get sucked in.

780
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:12,000
I mean, of course, there will be a counter movement, but will it be successful on the whole to the best of the population?

781
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:20,000
No, ever since we went real hard on Web three, I've I've been kind of going down the rabbit hole and I've been reading about these different companies and their different initiatives.

782
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:25,000
And there are a lot of big, big players behind some of these metaverse companies.

783
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:37,000
And some companies are announcing like real estate and offices like companies that have recently announced that they're going to work from home only have now also announced that they're opening an office in a metaverse.

784
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:43,000
And of course, the metaverse right now is just different companies, virtual reality environments that you got to connect to via an app on a Oculus.

785
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
Hey, you know what? Fine.

786
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:49,000
Sue me, Disney. We got to do the Jar Jar Coder NFT.

787
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
Totally, dude.

788
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:54,000
We just have to do it. Let's see if we can get some money. I'll split it. Let's do 50 50.

789
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
Yeah, let's do it on one day.

790
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:03,000
I probably will do it like a J.B., not a not like a currency, but just like a coin, you know, because we did do challenge coins before.

791
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
But I got to wait for all this to shake out. Do something legit.

792
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:09,000
We should do if this metaverse crap actually takes off.

793
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:13,000
We sell the code, the coder robe right for your app.

794
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:14,000
Of course, man.

795
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:19,000
People can get a robe and you don't have to spend like four months torturing yourself. See?

796
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:22,000
Dude, we could we'd have a swag shop that you could visit in the metaverse.

797
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:23,000
Absolutely.

798
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:26,000
I could have a creepy little room that's all Alice in Wonderland themed.

799
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,000
Yep.

800
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:30,000
You buy the robe on the back end. It's an NFT kind of thing.

801
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:33,000
But as an end user, you know, you don't ever know.

802
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:36,000
And the price of the robe. We make it like the block chain, like crypto.

803
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,000
Sure.

804
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:41,000
Gets more expensive as people buy it. Thus, we incentivize people to buy it early.

805
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:46,000
And for every 200 robes sold, I will find a Snow Leopard disc.

806
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:49,000
Digital NFT one, of course, and send it to you.

807
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:50,000
Right. Yeah. Yeah.

808
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
We wouldn't want a physical one. We'd clutter things up.

809
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:55,000
No, those are mine and I snuggle with them when I'm sent.

810
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:58,000
I think this is brilliant, you know, and everybody can get their robes and hold.

811
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:01,000
And then one day they'll be worth millions.

812
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:09,000
No, they won't be worth anything because the planet will die and all these servers will go down and we'll all just realize this was just data bits, ones and zeros and servers.

813
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:10,000
But hey, listen.

814
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:14,000
You know, actually, maybe the only thing that survives, you know, somebody else, some alien aliens will come by.

815
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:21,000
They'll power up the server and it'll be all our virtual crap that survived and everything else has fallen apart and degraded.

816
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
Wow. Oh, wow.

817
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:26,000
Well, anyways, don't you want to keep this going?

Well, Mr. Dominic, is there anywhere you would like to send people this week?

825
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
I mean, therapy, I don't know.

826
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:59,000
No, I'll go to go to the matter.

827
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:07,000
I'll say go over to Coinbase and buy yourself some crypto suckers.

828
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:13,000
