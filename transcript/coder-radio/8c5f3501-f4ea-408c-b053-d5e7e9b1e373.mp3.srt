00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,920
This is KOTOR Radio, episode 444 for December 13th, 2021.

2
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:19,600
Hello old friend and welcome back to Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show, taking a

3
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:25,960
pragmatic look at the art and the business of software development and the world of technology.

4
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:29,980
My name is Chris and joining us perched right there next to his microphone like he was just

5
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:36,140
last week, it's our host, Mr. Dominic. Hello, Mike. Hey, how are you? Oh, you really want to know?

6
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:41,580
Sure. I want to know how you're doing. I'm okay. You know, busy, busy, busy. Been writing a lot of

7
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:47,660
C sharp last week. I could tell because, you know, the tweets and the slacks have dropped down. So

8
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:51,500
you must be pretty busy. I mean, you pop in from time to time, but yeah, a little bit of crunch

9
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:56,460
time. So how are you? I sound like you. I sound like you're like you're ready to explode. Remember

10
00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:00,380
how we used to say, you know, I'm going to go postal? Remember how that used to be a phrase

11
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:06,300
back in like the 90s? Maybe it was. I do remember. Yeah, that's how I feel. I mean, I don't know what

12
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:10,700
I got to do to make sure the end of the year does not turn out to be such a damn grind fest every

13
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:17,580
time. But I forgot just how bad end of your grind can get when you run your own business. And boy,

14
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:22,300
am I getting it this year. Ground into the ground. Let me give you a taste of like my last four days.

15
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:26,620
This is just a taste. You're not going to believe this, but it's all absolutely true. I'll start

16
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:31,420
with the more believable. We've had some new projects in the works and I just killed one of

17
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:37,740
them that we've been working on for a while and it's hard. You know how that goes, right? And on

18
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:41,020
top of that, we're trying to figure out and coordinate moving the live time for Linux,

19
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:45,580
unplugged moving the record time for Linux action news and tweaking some of the stuff there while

20
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:50,700
also figuring all that stuff out. Also, like trying to figure out a new network wide membership

21
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:56,140
program that involves different platform providers, legal contracts and like all this stuff,

22
00:01:57,100 --> 00:02:01,820
while also trying to keep the content rolling in the weekly shows. Of course, of course,

23
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:04,620
while all this is going on, all of like the new show stuff I was trying to figure out,

24
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:09,340
I couldn't sleep. So I hadn't slept for days. And of course, it's the fucking holidays. So ho,

25
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:15,020
ho, ho. I got to like buy gifts and see family on the weekends all the time. That's been great.

26
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:22,220
And legit this weekend, I lit my robe on fire. What do you mean you lit it on fire? I lit the

27
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:27,900
coater on fire. Like actually on fire? Yeah, I got bad. So I do this family holiday shopping trip

28
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:32,060
with my dad and we didn't do it last year because of COVID. But we did it this year and we got some

29
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:37,660
whiskey and some cigars and I had a cigar. You know, I don't I don't smoke very often, but I had

30
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:43,100
a cigar. So you had fire and an accelerant. Yes. It was a newer version of the rope because I gave

31
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:47,260
my dad a robe and I had a robe. It had like a little bit of this like peach fuzz on it.

32
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:53,260
So I'm sitting in my chair, manspreading, right? And leaning over, lighting my big gentleman's

33
00:02:53,260 --> 00:03:00,060
cigar on fire. And a piece of the gentleman's cigar falls down between my legs. Like so it's

34
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:05,500
already scary because as other gentlemen out there know, when object begins to fall between

35
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:11,180
your legs in your crotchular region, you instinctually like close your legs, right?

36
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:11,820
Right.

37
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:17,260
But it was a big chunk of fire. I kind of stopped myself. But now I don't know because I flinched.

38
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:23,500
I don't know where this ember is. Right. But what I see is like when you turn on a propane heater

39
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:28,380
and there's like this plume of fire that just goes across the entire heater. That's what my

40
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:32,780
robe did because of the peach fuzz that was on there. So I'm sitting here and all of a sudden

41
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:37,420
I just see this plume of fire that spreads out between my legs and my ass starts getting hot.

42
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:42,220
Like, I'm not even kidding you. I'm like, I think I get it, but then my ass starts getting hotter

43
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:46,140
and hotter. And I'm like, oh, crap. So I'm like, I'm taking the robe off. Right. Throw the cigar

44
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:49,420
because I'm not even thinking anymore. So I just throw the cigar on the carpet like an idiot,

45
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:53,980
although it was fine. I rush to take the robe off. I throw the robe on the floor and I start

46
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:58,140
stomping on it. Right. Because I'm trying to put out the fire. And everybody's like,

47
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:04,540
what the hell just happened? And I figure the robe must be completely destroyed. Right.

48
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:10,300
I pick it up. I open it up. Look at the inside. I can see where the ember fell, but I think it

49
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:14,940
was just the peach fuzz that lit on fire because the rest of the robe looks completely unscathed

50
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:20,300
like a shield. Maybe Thor's hammer. Maybe that's a better analogy. The robe is like Thor's hammer.

51
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:24,060
So then the wife, you know, I get home and I'm like, you're not going to believe what happened.

52
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:27,820
And she says, what? And I'm like, go look at my robe. And, you know, she takes out the robe.

53
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:32,060
I was like, what? And she's like this little burn mark here. I'm like, the whole thing was on fire

54
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:36,860
for a second. No, she says, it's fine. How could it have been? It's not even singed.

55
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:43,740
So, you know, the peach fuzz took one for me. That's amazing. And, uh, what is it? Antimaneum?

56
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:47,900
What is that? That Wolverine's made out of? Adamantium. Yeah. Adamantium. I think that's

57
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:52,780
what the robe was made out of. Cause it's just fine. It's unscathed. You know, that'll put hair

58
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:59,020
on your chest though. I don't drink much, but I was out shopping and we went to dinner and it's

59
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:04,460
been stressful. So I got myself a couple of tequilas. And now it's like, I'm having a three

60
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:10,780
day hangover. It was Saturday. Today's Monday. And I still feel like, I honestly don't know how

61
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:14,140
people drink these days and not feel like hell because for me, it does. It just makes me feel

62
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:19,340
like hell. So that's been my last few days. Yeah. I don't touch tequila, that stuff, even smelling

63
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:25,340
it. It's like, killing projects, burning ropes, moving shows around, which when you move time

64
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:29,260
shows, right? You got to coordinate with the host. You know this, we got to coordinate with the

65
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:33,420
editor. We got to make sure that we can do it at this particular time. You know what it's like

66
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:37,900
when you're doing it for two shows at the same time and trying not to miss a beat. It's a

67
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:43,500
nightmare. It's just been a nightmare. All of it's just been horrible. So I'm in a good mood today.

68
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:52,060
So let's do some damn emails. Actually, Mike R writes in with some handy guides for developers

69
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:56,540
that are looking to port over to M1 hardware. But he also wrote, and he said, you know what,

70
00:05:56,540 --> 00:06:00,540
I kind of agree with Chris's M1 Max experience where, yeah, it's fast. It's really nice.

71
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:07,260
But I was oversold. I was oversold on the performance. And what it is, it's like every

72
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:11,660
component you can tell is really performing at its peak. You know, the disk system, the memory

73
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:17,820
bandwidth, the CPU, all of that is really great. But it's not like, oh my God, my life has changed.

74
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:21,740
It's just, oh, finally it's as fast as it should have been. He said, so I've been making a guide

75
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:25,100
for the last couple of weeks. It's not perfect. It still needs a lot of work, but I wanted to share

76
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:29,660
it with anyone that would find it useful. It's the Apple Silicon guide on GitHub. He also has a VS

77
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:33,580
code guide. I perused through this. And the reason why I wanted to bring it up in the show, and I'll

78
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:41,340
put a link in the notes, is for somebody like me who's coming from Linux and isn't quite sure what

79
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:45,020
all the little ins and outs are of getting macOS humming on this thing and what settings to tweak,

80
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:49,580
this is a great, great guide for that. I mean, he does a fantastic technical breakdown of the

81
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:53,980
architecture as well, but then he gets into the specifics of porting an application to Apple

82
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:59,980
Silicon, debugging kernel extensions, working with the audio core, all this stuff that I really had

83
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:03,740
no idea about because it's all a foreign language to me. And I found it to be pretty useful if

84
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:08,140
you're coming from that angle. And I just wanted to say thank you to Mike R for sending that in.

85
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:13,020
We'll have a link in the notes about that. So if you've got any M1 strugs, check it out.

86
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:13,580
Cool.

87
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:19,180
Yeah, not much to add, just kind of a FYI. So Vikram writes in with a feature request for the

88
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:23,580
Coder Radio program. He says, you mentioned something in an episode once and I wanted to

89
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:27,580
go look it up, but I wasn't sure what episode or where it was. So I looked in several show notes,

90
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:32,220
couldn't find it. I thought maybe it was on Linux unplugged as well. I'm never really able to

91
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:35,820
remember because I listened to both of them. I looked in the show notes and I did find that

92
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:40,300
you talked about it in Coder Radio, but it's possible as mentioned elsewhere. So I thought,

93
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:44,860
you know, it'd be really nice is a more advanced search. Something like elastic search for the

94
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:50,940
show notes would be amazing for podcasts in general. Well, it just so happens the orange

95
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:56,380
one wrote in about a rad show notes tool he's made for the whole network. The orange one says,

96
00:07:56,380 --> 00:08:01,260
Hey folks, a while back I helped Alex from self-hosted build a show notes site at

97
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:07,420
notes.jupiterbroadcasting.com. We collaborated in the self-hosted discord and people seem to like

98
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:12,460
it quite a bit. So I made a post on my website about how I put it together. And this is actually

99
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:16,300
a really great read. He uses a lot of different technology that we talk about a lot on the show

100
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:23,580
to build this. He says that he's recently been falling in love with Python. He was a Ruby guy,

101
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:28,220
but Python has been getting his attention. So he thought he'd make a good little section on the

102
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:31,580
show and I'll put a link in the show notes. So go check this out if you haven't yet. It's

103
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:38,060
notes.jupiterbroadcasting.com. And from here you can search all the shows and it's not perfect

104
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:43,820
because it's not doing transcription to, you know, voice to text, but it is a very good search that

105
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:49,580
goes through the tags and the links and all that stuff. Another resource. I love it.

106
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:54,140
notes.jupiterbroadcasting.com. At some point I'll talk to the orange one maybe and figure out,

107
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:58,620
you know, get the story, how he built it. But we do have a link to his blog in there.

108
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:04,460
And I think probably what stuck out to me is just kind of how well he broke it all down

109
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:10,220
and how he renders the content, how he parallels some of the work, where he's hosting, obviously

110
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:15,580
Linode, where it's at now, all that kind of stuff's in there. I don't know. Thank you. You know,

111
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:21,740
I am running my arse off doing some of this stuff. Proper show notes search that searches all of the

112
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:27,820
shows at once. Well, that's definitely something that I've wanted to do, but like it's not even on

113
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:32,700
my list. There's so much going on. No, it's not an easy task either. No. When am I going to find

114
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:36,140
time for that? Or when am I going to get funding for that either? All right, so let's take a look.

115
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:42,940
This is written in Python. Excellent choice. Mm hmm. Mm hmm. Yeah. Let's see server.py. So what is

116
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:50,780
it? Ooh, let's see. Flake. This is good radio right here. This is what happens when somebody

117
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:54,780
clicks the wrong button and then loses their place. I'm liking it though. I like the live

118
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:59,500
breakdown. Let's see. Template theme. GitHub workflows. How fancy. I thought I just saw

119
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:03,340
server.py. Did I lose my mind? I mean, that's totally possible. If it was going to happen,

120
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:11,260
it probably happened live. It was scraped.py. I just want to just hang on. There's there's he's

121
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:18,540
using what is it? Ginger. Oh, and then of course he's also using MK docs to build out the pages.

122
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:24,620
Okay, cool. So he's using flake like a good developer. Look at that. Mm hmm. He's got dev

123
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:29,580
requirements and real requirements separated. And he's got it all running in a container

124
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:35,500
environment using traffic as a proxy to bring the request in and out. And it's all provisioned with

125
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:42,620
a mixer of ansible and terraform. How about this? All right. I know. Well, la de da, sir.

126
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:48,220
I bet you if I hired a guy to do this job, he might not even do it this good, right? That's

127
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:54,060
so crazy. Wow. He's even got GitHub workflows for like actually scraping. Wow. All right, cool.

128
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:58,940
Got to keep that data current, right? Mm hmm. So thank you to the orange one for building that for

129
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:07,580
us. lino.com slash coder. Go there to get $100 in 60 day credit on a new account. And you go there

130
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:12,220
to support the show. Linode is the developers cloud with 11 data centers worldwide. They have

131
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:17,420
something near you or near a customer. And they've been hard at work for 18 years creating the best

132
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:21,580
experience for running applications on Linux. If you're the type likes to build it up from the

133
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:25,740
ground yourself, or if you prefer one click deployments or integrating in with an existing

134
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:31,020
infrastructure management tool set, Linode has excellent options for you. And the performance

135
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:37,740
is mind blowing. I simply wouldn't host all of JB's stuff there, right? I want the audience to

136
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:43,420
have a good experience. I mean, they have the best customer support 24 7365. They have a beautiful

137
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:48,860
dashboard, tons of documentation, a brilliant community. But it's performance, right? That's

138
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:53,180
the number one thing for me. And they're just super fast. And they've been rolling out screaming

139
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:59,100
new MVME based storage, PCIe MVME storage, super flexible S3 compatible object storage on the

140
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:03,740
backend. We use that all the time. I mean, this dashboard, I mentioned it because it brings these

141
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:08,140
things together. You hear things like object storage, block storage, you know, and it's like,

142
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:11,260
Okay, what does that mean? Well, you go into the dashboard, you'll figure it out. And you'll start

143
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:15,580
using enterprise grade tools in minutes. If you've been using Linode for anything longer than five

144
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:20,460
minutes, you realize it's pretty special. And as you start to get in more invested, like you start

145
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:24,860
to learn the tooling around it, like the API, and the command line tool and that kind of stuff that

146
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:30,700
just makes your use of Linode even more efficient. So from the best customer support, super fast

147
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:35,420
rigs and super fast networking, and a Linux culture that runs deep, you know, they're clicking my

148
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:41,740
buttons. Maybe they'll tap your buttons too. I'm not sure where I'm going with that. There's a lot

149
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:45,340
of reasons though to choose Linode. And I think you should check it out. And $100. In my opinion,

150
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:50,700
it puts it over the top. So go get that $100 in credit and support the show. linode.com slash

151
00:12:50,700 --> 00:13:01,020
coder. So did you hear about this log for shell bug? It's a bug in log4j. And it's stupid simple

152
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:07,340
to exploit it. You could change your web browser's user agent early on, you could just simply rename

153
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:12,460
your iPhone with this string in there. And you could actually exploit the flaw in Apple's iCloud.

154
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:17,340
What it is, is this log4j application parses logs. And when it encounters a string,

155
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:21,100
because you're often capturing the commands that your users are passing by, when it captures a

156
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:26,300
string, you can make a request to the JNDI engine, which is this, I don't really know it very well,

157
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:30,860
but it's a mechanism that will let you like connect to an LDAP database or something like that.

158
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:36,220
And you can send a URL to it. So it could also go out to like an external server. And that's where

159
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:40,860
you can have it go out, get a payload and then come back and execute it. And you can actually

160
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:44,220
have it execute something like on the command line or something like that, depending on how you

161
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:49,500
exploit this thing. There's a patch out, of course, because they went public with it last week.

162
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:57,340
But even before the proof of exploit code was public, eight days, in fact, before the proof of

163
00:13:57,340 --> 00:14:01,820
exploit code was public, there were attackers taking advantage. They knew ahead of time.

164
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:07,580
Oh, yeah. You know, and it started with crypto miners, of course, actually got to go make a

165
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:14,940
quick buck on a coin, I guess. I don't know. Now it's moved up to like professional attackers

166
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:20,620
and researchers using this vulnerability and log for J to execute vulnerability scan behind

167
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:24,460
firewalls and find vulnerabilities inside people's internal networks and whatnot.

168
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:27,980
I heard you like vulnerabilities. So I put some vulnerabilities behind your firewalls

169
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:34,620
with vulnerabilities in your vulnerabilities. What's so wild about this is it was discovered

170
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:39,820
as a Minecraft flaw because the users could actually put like the execution commands in

171
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:43,980
a Minecraft command. The server would log the command and then they could get it to execute

172
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:48,060
the code and they could exploit the Minecraft server. That's I think how this actually first

173
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:53,980
became discovered. I just want to say we have hit the Java gold standard here. A bug that hits

174
00:14:53,980 --> 00:15:00,300
enterprise Java discovered via Minecraft. One of the more famous, you know, client side Java

175
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:05,100
applications out there. We did a complete breakdown and analysis in Linux Action News.

176
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:08,700
I should mention that. So if you want to know all the details, LinuxActionNews.com.

177
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:14,860
But the proof of concept code, that's the thing that gets me comes out on the 9th. Eight days

178
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:18,860
before that, you start seeing people exploit this. And I want to know how the hell that happens.

179
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:25,420
This is bad enough because log for J is one of those little bits of pieces way down the stack

180
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:28,300
that you don't even think about when you're thinking about securing your infrastructure,

181
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:33,020
right? Because this thing's just handling your logging. Are you really thinking about remote code

182
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:38,300
execution with your logs? And don't you actually want to log the commands that the users were

183
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:41,580
executing? So you know how to troubleshoot, you know what they were doing. Like you actually need

184
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:47,500
that data. It's such a catch 22. There's just, I feel like there's no solution to this kind of

185
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:51,740
stuff because we have so much of this type of software deployed throughout all of our

186
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:55,580
infrastructures. You know, the more dependencies and as more complicated your stack becomes,

187
00:15:55,580 --> 00:16:00,380
just the wider the surface area, right? For you to get hit with one of these. So,

188
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:05,020
I mean, there's been some high profile MPM vulnerabilities that you use an MPM package.

189
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:08,860
And MPM, we haven't covered much, but yeah, MPM has been having a real hard time.

190
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:12,140
It's been bad. This is an issue that's like pervasive.

191
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:15,100
Well, this is an issue with like all modern software development, because everybody's

192
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:18,940
basically Lego-ing a bunch of packages together, right? It could happen to anybody. I mean,

193
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:23,900
RubyGems has had some in the past, theoretically PIP code, right? I think I'm sure PIP has.

194
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:27,340
I just don't know about it, but this is the downside.

195
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:33,500
Vulnerability goes back to like 2006. And it just really underscores no software infrastructure can

196
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:39,260
remain static. You always have to plan to update it down the road. Even if the core application

197
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:44,060
doesn't get updated, you have to figure out a way to build an update to underlying OS and libraries.

198
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:46,700
You have to be able to build for that.

199
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:49,660
And that is not always as easy as you think it could be.

200
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:54,060
I would imagine. You build something, and then you update these libraries and you change things.

201
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:57,900
It's something that we don't talk a lot about. But when you change some of this stuff for security

202
00:16:57,900 --> 00:17:02,140
purposes, it sometimes changes how long a function takes to execute.

203
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:05,740
And that can mess with a lot of stuff. Just something like that.

204
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:08,780
Yeah, I have actually a real-world example from a few years ago when,

205
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:11,580
remember the Heartbleed OpenSSL stuff?

206
00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:12,220
Oh yeah.

207
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:18,060
They pulled the Ruby Gem that worked with SSL 1, and you had to use a newer version.

208
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:22,140
Fine. But that newer version wouldn't work with older versions of Rails.

209
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:23,180
Oh yeah.

210
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:27,340
So now, to get a security update, you're upgrading your entire application

211
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:31,340
to whatever the new version of Rails is. And depending on how far back you were,

212
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:35,740
the level of change we're making became more and more significant.

213
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:41,340
That kind of stuff, sometimes you find out about it ahead of time, and sometimes it's stuff that

214
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:45,820
is sort of so low on the list that nobody really makes a big noise about making an update like

215
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:49,340
that, and it bites you, and you don't even really know where in the stack it happened.

216
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:53,020
It's such a hard problem. But there is a patch out there.

217
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:59,100
Any version of JVM released after 2019 doesn't have the vulnerability.

218
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:03,420
Of course, the problem is, there's a lot of deployments of older JVM out there.

219
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:05,980
Even Steam, you know?

220
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:06,300
Yep.

221
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:12,220
Steam and iCloud. Even these huge groups that, a big part of their business is their online service,

222
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:16,780
they end up on old versions of JVM. And anybody who's ever worked in a large enterprise or medium

223
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:21,420
business has seen this happen. Good luck. I've been hearing from a lot of you out there that

224
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:25,500
have been scrambling to patch. I don't miss that hustle. Good luck to you.

225
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:32,380
I'm going to do an ad for Linux Action News, and I'm going to play a clip right here about the

226
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:40,460
funding model. So a big part of this is Log4j has not been getting properly funded at all.

227
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:45,660
For the last decade, it's like two dudes working on it by themselves. And it's become this key

228
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:50,140
piece of infrastructure for all these billion dollar companies. And they're like, we'll pay us.

229
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:53,100
And it's not that simple. That's what this clip addresses.

230
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:59,100
Google and Amazon, you know, they're not going to go and log4j's Patreon and become a Patreon

231
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:03,020
supporter in one of their tiers, right? That's not how these massive companies work.

232
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:09,980
That's not how these massive companies work. They live in the land of invoices, POs, and ACH

233
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:16,460
payments, not PayPal payments, not Patreon payments, not GitHub sponsors. That's just

234
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:20,780
not what these companies do. They have finance departments. They don't have individuals that

235
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:27,020
have PayPal accounts that go support some developer. So we need a way that's not a big

236
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:35,420
foundation or some law firm, but some platform that lets developers get paid in the language,

237
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:39,820
in the means that these companies want to do it. And I know this sounds odd, but I can tell you

238
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:44,380
from being on this end, there has been multiple situations where we're like, we don't have a way

239
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:49,100
to pay this guy because he doesn't want to work with PayPal or there's this restriction because

240
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:54,140
of the country he's in. And it's so much more complicated than just send them a tip. And

241
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:58,300
it gets even more complicated when you have these companies with policies and procedures,

242
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:01,660
and they're used to interfacing with other businesses, not individuals.

243
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:05,660
It's a really hard problem to solve. LinuxActionNews.com.

244
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:11,820
I do have a few things on our list that have been sent in by the audience,

245
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:19,260
and one that I know you tagged me with earlier in the week that just demonstrated the absolute

246
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:25,020
control Apple has over their app store. It came out that Microsoft has quietly told Apple it

247
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:31,340
was willing to turn big Xbox exclusive games into dedicated iPhone apps. In other words,

248
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:40,060
Microsoft offered to bring AAA Xbox exclusives to the iPhone if it meant Apple would ease up

249
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:45,500
on their streaming policy for Xbox's new gaming stream, Xbox Cloud Gaming or XCloud.

250
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:51,100
And Apple didn't budge. And it's weird because these emails came out and it's like Microsoft

251
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:56,300
trying to wheel and deal here with Apple. And you can, I mean, can you imagine taking something

252
00:20:56,300 --> 00:21:00,780
that is an exclusive video game like Halo or something to your platform and being willing

253
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:04,380
to make an iPhone app out of it just to get Apple to crack the door a little bit?

254
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:09,260
Apple's answer was, um, no.

255
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:13,260
Yeah, maybe they figured this is like a hundred year economy for them or something.

256
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:18,460
They fight for this thing. Like it's going to be the way they make money for the next hundred years.

257
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:23,020
Yeah, I think they correctly understand that. I mean, listen to the show from a few weeks ago.

258
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:30,060
Being a middleman is a big business right now in the digital economy. And as Judge,

259
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:35,740
I forgot her last name, Judge, um, oh, right. Well, the judge in the Apple epic cake will tell you

260
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:41,260
the gamers are spending the most money here. So let's go ahead and be in the middle of that

261
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:47,900
transaction. So then Microsoft in March of last year came with like a second compromise because

262
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:51,980
remember Apple's response was you can't stream, but you could submit those thousand games as

263
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:56,940
individual apps to the store. So Microsoft's like first, how about we give you a couple exclusive

264
00:21:56,940 --> 00:22:01,100
and then you let us stream that didn't work. Second approach. Second set of compromises is

265
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:05,900
okay. Microsoft will propose that we will create those hundreds or thousands of individual apps,

266
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:10,220
and we will submit them to the app store. But you let us make those essentially like

267
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:15,500
shortcuts. So we don't have to stuff the whole cloud gaming in one little app, the whole

268
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:19,980
infrastructure. They argued that this essentially how watch OS apps work already. It would just be

269
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:24,620
something they did on the iPhone. They said that they have the tech in there. They could do it.

270
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:28,460
Each app would be around 150 megabytes. They'd have like a runtime and they get you connected

271
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:32,540
to the cloud service. It'd be a legitimate app. It'd just be an app that gets you up and connected

272
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:36,860
to that specific game. And this part's embarrassing too, because they say things like that's fun.

273
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:40,620
There's a typo in here. Listen to this. He says, quote, we're excited that we are close to finding

274
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:47,180
a solve to bring the Xbox game pass library to iOS. We wanted to follow up on details you requested.

275
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:51,580
Were they close? Wait, they weren't. No. And you know, they even said, we think we could get those

276
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:55,580
apps down to 30 megabytes in size. So they download real small. That'd be easy for you guys

277
00:22:55,580 --> 00:23:01,660
to review and approve and nothing. Apple's like, but, but, but you missed the point. That's not

278
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:07,420
our problem. It's so transparent that it's almost, I almost feel icky saying it because it's like,

279
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:13,420
no, that's crazy. And of course, in-app purchases became a big sticking spot. That was just an area

280
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:17,820
Apple was unwilling to compromise on no matter how they came to do this. Yeah. And we should know,

281
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:21,660
we don't have it in the notice. Apple just won an injunction against the order saying they had to

282
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:30,060
allow alternative payment methods and apps. It's good to be the king. Yeah. I forgot who wrote it.

283
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:36,140
I think it was a, was it Jeff Atwood? I think so. Way back when about one of what now seems like a

284
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:41,580
super quaint controversy regarding the app store. I could just look it up. The article was entitled

285
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:46,940
at the pleasure of the king or something. It seems worse today than it did then. That's the thing.

286
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:51,580
I think what has been striking me about all this serving real time, serving at the pleasure of the

287
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:58,060
king. That's what it was. Yeah. As this conversation has evolved on the show, I've realized it's worse

288
00:23:58,060 --> 00:24:03,580
than I think we ever thought it was going to be in a lot of ways. In so many ways, we were originally

289
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:09,420
focused on things like getting free software in the app store or sideloading. And now it's really,

290
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:14,620
you're right. It's about this middle management control that they can extort over developers and

291
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:21,260
over end users. And Apple has made it clear. They very much see the iPhone as an appliance type

292
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:26,460
console device with a curated console like experience. It's not a personal computer. It's a

293
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:32,140
console. They also see apps not as really their own programs, but as extensions of iOS. Yeah. At

294
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:35,980
first I was resistant to that when I'm thinking, but the more I hear and the more I kind of just

295
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:42,540
like, I've been following this. I mean, the level of control here is pretty substantial, perhaps.

296
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:47,500
Do you think they view it the way they do the way they view apps? Do you think they view them as,

297
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:51,500
you know, developers should be grateful that Apple's building this and that they're just

298
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:55,500
extensions of the OS? Do you think they view it that way because they create the app?

299
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:57,820
Well, I think they basically said that in the courtroom.

300
00:24:57,820 --> 00:24:59,980
Okay. Did they? Okay. Yeah. I kind of recall that.

301
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:02,620
They didn't use the word grateful, but they said, you know, we invest all of this. We

302
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:06,300
built the platform. We need to, I mean, Tim Cook just said it outright. He dropped, he didn't even

303
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:09,900
like, he dropped the whole veneer of security. He's like, we need to recoup our investment,

304
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:13,020
which is laughable because they definitely have.

305
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:19,900
I mean, I'm not even thinking app store. I'm thinking like iOS core APIs, things like ML APIs

306
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:26,220
and audio and video APIs will let you access the camera. I wonder if they view themselves as well.

307
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:27,980
We've done most of the hard work.

308
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:31,500
I think they think both, right? The hardware, the APIs, the SDKs.

309
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:32,300
Right. Of course.

310
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:36,860
But Apple has always been like this, my way or the highway. I think the difference is nobody

311
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:43,420
could have foreseen or nobody did foresee how substantial to their business being a middleman,

312
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:46,380
right? Being, you know, that app store fee was going to be.

313
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:47,100
Yeah.

314
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:51,980
And they are a publicly traded corporation. I know people are going to write in and say,

315
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:56,940
it's not true, but basically, you know, Tim Cook wants up until the right every quarter.

316
00:25:56,940 --> 00:26:02,140
I mean, if you told me I can make 30% of somebody else's business just by like being there,

317
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:04,060
I would be happy.

318
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:07,820
You know, the thing is, is Microsoft is not necessarily the customer you want to piss off

319
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:14,540
because they have a lot of influence with regulators now. Like they played that game.

320
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:18,780
They have figured out how to influence. I mean, look at look at the way they got that

321
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:22,140
Pentagon project or the CIA. It is whatever it was. I can't remember. God,

322
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:24,860
this is not my day for recollection. I shouldn't take in my B12.

323
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:30,700
Pentagon, CIA, MI6, listen, Men in Black. That is the contract I want.

324
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:36,060
You don't take a deal like that away from Amazon without being super savvy in Washington.

325
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:40,620
And so I'm just saying, like, you go around and you do this. You do this kind of stuff.

326
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:43,500
You know, they're screwing with Microsoft's moneymaker.

327
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:47,900
Microsoft wants to turn this Xbox cloud streaming thing into a whole thing that can reach a whole

328
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:52,540
new generation of users that never even buy Xbox hardware. And Apple is a very key part

329
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:57,100
of that strategy. And they're with Microsoft's money here. And the reality is they're being

330
00:26:57,100 --> 00:27:01,260
unreasonable and they're stringing them along, getting their people to waste times on proposals

331
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:05,420
and looking at trying to contain their entire streaming platform in a single app and doing all

332
00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:10,140
this kind of bull that Microsoft's going to get pissed about. And it's the exact kind of thing

333
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:14,620
that they're going to sit down with some regulator and say, look at this. And it's going to end up

334
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:19,980
biting them in the ass. And I know you know that and they must know that. So then it leads me to

335
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:25,900
conclude that the end goal, whatever the end goal is of the App Store, must be one of the highest

336
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:32,780
priorities of the organization because they are willing to bring federal regulation down upon them

337
00:27:32,780 --> 00:27:37,340
to save what they got. I mean, it's the only place where their growth is is not as limited,

338
00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:41,260
right? Like one of the problems in the last quarterly report that they were doing the

339
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:47,020
guidance for was that they've basically saturated the possible iPhone market, right? It's now

340
00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:52,060
people upgrading. I mean, sure, people die and people are born or whatever, but it's the growth

341
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:58,620
area. In fairness, though, this whole idea of streaming game services, I'm going to put on

342
00:27:58,620 --> 00:28:03,340
my tinfoil hat. I'm pretty sure that's the future of game development. And it's going to suck for

343
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:08,060
game developers, let you know, because again, it's going to be another like almost like sharecropping

344
00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:14,540
deal where you're getting paid X cents, whatever it is per, you know, active minute. Very much like

345
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:18,700
if you've ever known authors, how Kindle Unlimited works, it seems like a good deal. It's really not.

346
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:22,060
It's not unless you're like JK Rowling, right? Unless you're one of our Stephen King and then

347
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:27,980
sure, because you have so many people reading it. But I have GeForce now and I do like that I can

348
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:33,340
buy the game in steam often and play it on GeForce now. But what ends up actually kind of being the

349
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:40,460
nice thing about it as time goes on is they're upgrading the streaming service to RTX 3080 cards

350
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:45,100
with, you know, all their fancy features. I can't even buy one of those right now. Like I'd have to

351
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:49,980
pay this service for two or three years before it would equal the cost of a single graphics card.

352
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:53,740
And by that time, a whole new generation of graphics cards are on the market. And when you

353
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:57,180
look at the part shortages and you look at the cost of these things and you look at the fact that

354
00:28:57,180 --> 00:29:03,100
my purchasing power is less with inflation going crazy, it just seems almost more practical to just

355
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:07,100
have a game streaming service now because they'll just keep upgrading the GPUs because they're

356
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:13,020
fricking Nvidia. You know, I actually really have had pretty good success, even unlimited

357
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:17,340
connectivity. I know everybody thinks it's impossible, but I've done it once on LTE

358
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:21,180
and I've done it a lot on Starling and it's worked just fine.

359
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:25,580
Real time update. I just was able, speaking of gaming, to get an Xbox X.

360
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:30,620
Oh, really? Yes. My dad just got an S. I played the new Halo for the first time this weekend.

361
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:36,140
It's good. I have an S, but it's going to go in another room because I need my digital content

362
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:41,980
everywhere. I got to say, games are looking good on that thing. And Halo, you know, full

363
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:47,020
on surround sound support. So like Bullets or Wiz and Pass behind my head. And it was fun.

364
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:51,420
I haven't played a good Xbox game in these current generations. And I know Halo is not,

365
00:29:51,420 --> 00:29:55,020
you know, pushing the graphics all the way to the ultimate, but no, I really like it.

366
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:58,220
So what made you, because I know you're a Switch guy too, but are you just kind of like me kind

367
00:29:58,220 --> 00:30:02,700
of getting done with the games on Switch right now? Yeah. I mean, I've wanted one for a while

368
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:06,460
and it's just, it's more, I got an email from Walmart because I have that weird Walmart.

369
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:11,100
Alert thing? No, they're Prime. I don't know what they call it.

370
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:16,780
Oh yeah. So they do a thing now where they periodically get them in PS5s.

371
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:21,580
And if you're part of their, whatever Walmart Prime is, you get first dibs.

372
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:25,980
Uh-huh. So I just went in and cause I do it on the app, right? So you're logged in,

373
00:30:26,540 --> 00:30:31,180
you just like your information saved. Wham bam. There's your Xbox.

374
00:30:31,180 --> 00:30:34,540
Oh, I probably shouldn't know this. Now it's not coming until January.

375
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:36,620
Is there a particular game you're looking forward to?

376
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:42,860
Probably Halo. I mean, so I haven't done serious gaming in a long time. I just got back into it.

377
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:46,940
I just finished Assassin's Creed Origins. So I think I'm going to pick up Odyssey and then

378
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:50,380
Valhalla. Yeah. It's going to look good. Oh, I think so.

379
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:55,260
I just bought the new Metroid Dread on Switch. I have a two, I haven't played it yet.

380
00:30:55,980 --> 00:30:57,340
It's hard. Is it?

381
00:30:57,980 --> 00:31:03,500
A lot of it is about speed and getting through the map as fast as possible. Now,

382
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:08,540
the thing that I love about it being an old fart is that it's a 2D side-scrolling like

383
00:31:08,540 --> 00:31:10,220
the original Metroids. Nice.

384
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:14,300
Yeah. I really like that. And only of course they bring in moments that are 3D cause they're using

385
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:17,500
a 3D rendering engine to actually do it. Like they do with the Mario games now.

386
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:21,020
Pretty good game so far. I have not gotten very far, but that's a great example of like,

387
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:27,820
I aspire to be gamer. I aspire to be like somebody who can just switch his brain off

388
00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:33,420
and sit down and play for a couple of hours. And it's a rare game that I can actually do that with

389
00:31:33,420 --> 00:31:37,580
and Breath of the Wild was probably the best at it because it's so engrossing.

390
00:31:37,580 --> 00:31:41,660
You know, so that's a special treat for me when a game can hold my attention and I'm not thinking

391
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:46,540
about work. It's like a special escape. So I hope, I hope the metaverse is real.

392
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:53,500
I hope VR takes off because psychologically I think it'd be great for me. If I could go upstairs

393
00:31:53,500 --> 00:32:00,060
after this show and put on a VR headset and be at the beach, I think that'd actually be pretty good

394
00:32:00,060 --> 00:32:05,580
for my mental state. That's my one VR experience that I've really truly had by myself where I

395
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:11,660
wasn't like at a tech demo or with a group of friends. I have an Oculus like DK1 or whatever

396
00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:16,540
they were. Nice. I was here in the studio one night all by myself and I hooked it up to the

397
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:21,980
studio machine and launched one of their demos. And it was a raft in the middle of the ocean

398
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:27,500
with a little cabin on this wood raft. And I could climb up the ladder and sit on top. There's a

399
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:32,220
chair up there. And I just sat there on this raft in the middle of the ocean and it had headphones

400
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:37,900
and all that kind of stuff and just chilled the hell out for like 15 minutes. And I actually felt

401
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:42,860
like I was there. And it was like, whoa. It's probably what like people who love meditation

402
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:46,460
and really feel like they get something out of it probably was as close to that as I get.

403
00:32:47,260 --> 00:32:51,820
I just found it to be great. So I'm all for it. The rumors are that Apple's building one. I've

404
00:32:51,820 --> 00:32:57,660
thought about getting the Quest. So if anybody out there uses VR for like chill out time and has

405
00:32:57,660 --> 00:33:01,900
experience with ways of doing that, I'd kind of like to know. I know it's a weird angle, but

406
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:09,260
coder.show.contact. Let me know. Get that Quest. You know, before we move off Apple completely,

407
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:15,420
this was sent into the show too. You remember when we were talking about the child nudity detection

408
00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:19,580
stuff, the CSAM scanning that they were going to do on the iPhone? Yeah, the CSAM scanning. Yeah.

409
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:24,300
So this is interesting. So Apple's walked that back. But with iOS 15.2, which is rolling out,

410
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:30,460
they are including the nude image detection in kid iMessage. If you've got an iCloud family and

411
00:33:30,460 --> 00:33:35,020
you've got people on there that are children, like my kids are set up, then their iPhones,

412
00:33:35,020 --> 00:33:39,660
iPads or Macs or whatever will analyze incoming and outgoing messages received and sent through

413
00:33:39,660 --> 00:33:46,140
the Messages app to detect nudity. If the system finds a nude image, the picture will appear

414
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:51,580
blurred and the child will be warned before viewing it. If the children attempt to send a nude image,

415
00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:57,180
they'll also be warned. In both instances, the child will have the ability to contact a parent

416
00:33:57,180 --> 00:34:01,820
through the Messages app about the situation. But now this has changed from how it was before.

417
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:08,460
Parents will not automatically receive a notification. But the wider CSAM scanning

418
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:13,980
of your iCloud photo database is not being rolled out at this time. What do you think? I guess this

419
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:18,460
kind of seems like a pretty sensible compromise. How do you feel as a parent though about the

420
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:23,020
automatic notification no longer happening? That was actually the one feature I actually liked.

421
00:34:23,740 --> 00:34:27,580
Yeah. I mean, so we're going to have hilarious Reddit posts of it blurring out like Big Bird

422
00:34:27,580 --> 00:34:31,260
and stuff, right? Messing up and think, you know. Totally. It's going to be a meme.

423
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:34,540
It's going to be a meme. I don't know. This is a hard problem, right? You, you,

424
00:34:35,180 --> 00:34:40,220
you know, on some level, I mean, we both have kids. You definitely don't want your kids doing

425
00:34:40,220 --> 00:34:43,660
stupid things that are going to possibly follow them for a long time.

426
00:34:43,660 --> 00:34:48,540
And every iPad you give a kid comes with messages. Yep. But it's, it's also,

427
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:57,660
I would say almost impossible to have 100% surveillance of your child. So I don't know.

428
00:34:57,660 --> 00:35:05,500
I don't like this very much. I mean, I don't, I also don't like a lot of things very much when

429
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:14,300
it comes to like kids and technology. I sort of, I don't necessarily agree. Okay. Well,

430
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:19,260
we'll walk it back a little bit, right? I, I'm not convinced that like Kappa doesn't go far enough,

431
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:27,660
right? It's just like too easy to have kids on these social apps, even though they're not supposed

432
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:36,300
to. Oh man. Tiktok, I swear is going after my younger kids. Like it's wild. I know. And it's,

433
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:42,780
it's a constant near daily battle. It's strange. And like YouTube is just like dying. Like I showed

434
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:47,580
my kid one video on YouTube and I could see his eyes like he was getting sucked into the black

435
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:52,300
hole. And I was like, now you're done. That's it. Well, first of all, it's 16 by nine and it's

436
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:58,940
longer than 24 seconds. So come on. This goes into the next question. What age should your

437
00:35:58,940 --> 00:36:03,100
kids have these devices? Right? Yeah. And so I know we're supposed to be talking about Apple,

438
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:08,140
but I sort of think it's kind of a parenting problem. I mean, your kid can't send stupid

439
00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:13,180
iMessages if he or she doesn't have iMessage. True. Here's the flip side. Being who I am,

440
00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:17,660
I pretty much had, you know, my kids had a Linux laptop and a tablet before they probably should

441
00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:22,860
have. Well, yeah, my kids are so much more technically literate than pretty much everyone

442
00:36:22,860 --> 00:36:28,060
else in their peer group, everyone else. And like some of their friends, they're horrible at using

443
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:32,220
the iPad. They're horrible at video games and they don't know how to use controls. Like, and now

444
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:35,980
they're getting at an age, you know, 12, 13, where like it's starting to become common that their

445
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:40,380
friends want to play video games and know how to use technology and stuff like that. And the friends

446
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:45,420
in their social groups who have had really strict parenting on this, they don't know how to use

447
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:50,460
strict parenting on this. They really seem like they're behind all the other children in a very

448
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:57,020
important area. My son did not have his own iPad for a while until he went to kindergarten. And

449
00:36:57,020 --> 00:37:03,340
while there are other options, other devices one could buy like a Chromebook, the best way for him

450
00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:09,340
to do all of his homework is on the iPad, which is mind bending to me. Yeah. My kids get issued

451
00:37:09,340 --> 00:37:13,580
a Chromebook from their school. They can do some of it on their iPad, but for their school, it's

452
00:37:13,580 --> 00:37:17,420
the iPad or it's the Chromebook. Even the kindergartners have them. I guess technically

453
00:37:17,420 --> 00:37:21,740
I could whip up, open a Chrome tab, but then he's like on my computer and I feel like he's more

454
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:26,940
likely to damage it. So it was just easier to get him a mini. But see, I see what you're saying about

455
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:30,460
the parents who are super strict, like putting their kids behind him. My son like has a switch,

456
00:37:30,460 --> 00:37:34,620
right? He knows how to, he knows how to hook up the switch doc. He beat me at Mario the other day.

457
00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:40,220
It's a good proud moment. Also a hard moment. Very hard for me.

458
00:37:40,220 --> 00:37:46,140
Yeah, but it is addictive. I mean, telling him it's time to get off the Nintendo is like,

459
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:50,380
it's like someone who's got a problem. It's not, I mean, he's a lot better than he used to be,

460
00:37:50,380 --> 00:37:55,420
but it's, I know one of my kids is having a harder time with that. The other two seem to have found

461
00:37:55,420 --> 00:38:00,780
a pretty healthy natural balance, but one of my kids got three total is definitely struggling.

462
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:08,540
And my hope is to help guide them to learn how to manage this. Oh, being around people, you know,

463
00:38:08,540 --> 00:38:13,180
who have more kids and things like that. I now definitely get the damage that these social apps

464
00:38:13,180 --> 00:38:18,300
are doing in particular to like teenagers, right? I guess I'm hoping I can help them navigate it and

465
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:23,260
learn to manage it and when to turn it off and when to turn it on. But I mean, what do I know?

466
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:27,260
You know, this is the first time I've ever done this. And you and I are on Twitter all the time.

467
00:38:27,260 --> 00:38:32,620
So I mean, come on, I kind of wish I could go like live on some big piece of land somewhere,

468
00:38:32,620 --> 00:38:38,220
like in Montana and just not have them exposed to any of this. But that also is probably going

469
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:42,860
to not serve them when they're adults. I'll just have to live on my farm for the rest of time.

470
00:38:42,860 --> 00:38:44,700
A title suggestion, Coder Farm.

471
00:38:46,460 --> 00:38:52,300
I want to thank our members at coderqa.co. You guys are our army that keeps us going.

472
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:56,220
And we appreciate you. You can now get an ad free version of the show,

473
00:38:56,220 --> 00:39:02,220
ad free, support the show and get the Coderly report. We've also launched the network membership

474
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:07,980
at Jupiter.party. So you can for the price of two shows, although right now it's $2 off for a year.

475
00:39:08,620 --> 00:39:13,340
So for less than the price of two shows, you can get access to all the show special feeds,

476
00:39:13,340 --> 00:39:18,700
including the Linux unplugged live stream, self-hosted post show, the Coderly report,

477
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:22,460
all in one feed. And it's the only way to get Linux action news ad free.

478
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:27,420
So that's at Jupiter.party. If you're a Coder QA member, we still appreciate you. And

479
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:31,500
even if you're not in the spot to be a member, even if you're just a listener,

480
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:35,660
maybe you take a moment to tell a friend about the show. We really appreciate that too.

481
00:39:35,660 --> 00:39:39,340
Thank you very much. Mr. Dominic, is there anywhere you'd like to send people this week?

482
00:39:40,060 --> 00:39:44,540
Follow me on Twitter at Domenico and go to Alice.dev if you have legacy data to move.

483
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:51,820
Who doesn't? As we can see from these JVM vulnerabilities. Oh yeah. Everybody does.

484
00:39:51,820 --> 00:39:56,380
Everybody does. Let's see. I'll plug the telegram. The network telegram is at

485
00:39:56,380 --> 00:40:01,260
jupiterbroadcasting.com slash telegram. We'd love to have you join the conversation there.

486
00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:06,140
We also have a matrix server with a Coder Radio matrix feedback room and discussion room. We have

487
00:40:06,140 --> 00:40:12,300
two different Coder Radio rooms. That matrix server is colony.jupiterbroadcasting.com.

488
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:17,260
Links to what we talked about today are at Coder.show slash four, four, four. But that's

489
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:22,140
just fun to say. You'll find our contact form over there as well as our RSS feed. We'd love

490
00:40:22,140 --> 00:40:25,820
to hear from you. Your feedback is a big part of the show and you can always join us live on a

491
00:40:25,820 --> 00:40:31,740
Monday. We do it at noon Eastern 3 p.m. Well noon Pacific 3 p.m. Eastern. I'll get it right someday.

492
00:40:31,740 --> 00:40:56,140
Thanks for joining us. We'll see you right back here next week on Coder Radio.
