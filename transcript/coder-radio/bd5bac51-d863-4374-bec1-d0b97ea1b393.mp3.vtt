00:00.000 --> 00:15.000
This is KOTORadio, episode 430 for September 6th, 2021.

00:15.000 --> 00:24.000
Hey friend, and welcome into Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show, taking a pragmatic look at the art and the business of software development and the world of technology.

00:24.000 --> 00:32.000
This episode is brought to you by a cloud guru. You know, they got that cloud playground over there. Azure, AWS or Google cloud sandboxes on their credit card.

00:32.000 --> 00:37.000
Not yours. Get certified, get hired, get learning at a cloud guru dot com.

00:37.000 --> 00:43.000
My name is Chris and helping me navigate this crazy world of podcasting. It is our host, Mr. Dominic. Hello, Mike.

00:43.000 --> 00:47.000
How's the sweat in there, Fisher? Oh, I mean, hi.

00:47.000 --> 00:51.000
It is. It is all kinds of hot and sweaty. Sticky.

00:51.000 --> 01:00.000
Record humidity in Tucson while I'm here, which is also meant record bugs, record bugs, 20 year record for bugs.

01:00.000 --> 01:06.000
And they bite. They all bite. So I'm covered in bug bites. Yeah, we kind of broke down in Tucson.

01:06.000 --> 01:12.000
You know, we came down here to get something fixed, our slide, which had been broken since May.

01:12.000 --> 01:20.000
And then as we're leaving the shop, I hear this really loud rubbing noise, almost like, you know, you're driving with your e-brake on kind of a sound.

01:20.000 --> 01:25.000
And although it's not my e-brake, I stop, look around, don't see anything.

01:25.000 --> 01:28.000
So I see if I can reproduce it. Sure enough, I can reproduce it pretty quickly.

01:28.000 --> 01:36.000
This time we take another look and we see that on the rear driver's side, part of my suspension, a Sumo spring has cracked.

01:36.000 --> 01:44.000
These things are marketed as indestructible, by the way. It has cracked and fallen onto my tire and it's rubbing against my inner dually tire.

01:44.000 --> 01:50.000
And it's potentially damaged the tire. My suspension is compromised in the back rear.

01:50.000 --> 01:57.000
So I decide, crap, we got to park it for a little bit. Well, this is a Friday before the long Labor Day weekend.

01:57.000 --> 02:02.000
And I didn't really appreciate it. Three p.m. on a Friday, how all of Tucson would shut down.

02:02.000 --> 02:06.000
And so I still it's we're now recording this on a Monday.

02:06.000 --> 02:12.000
I still haven't got a hold of anyone to find a replacement part or a shop that will see us because everybody's closed for the long weekend.

02:12.000 --> 02:19.000
So screw Chris. It's just been horrible because, you know, it's been one hundred hundred and five every day and we don't have hookups.

02:19.000 --> 02:23.000
So we're running off generator at best, which means our air conditioning, our generator and our power.

02:23.000 --> 02:28.000
There's this constant dance of heat and it's been a lot to manage.

02:28.000 --> 02:33.000
Then yesterday comes along. We get a notification about a very severe thunderstorm in our area.

02:33.000 --> 02:39.000
Oh, OK. All right. Next notification. These are like, you know, the phone buzzes like the amber alert kind of buzz.

02:39.000 --> 02:45.000
Another buzz comes in. God, massive dust storm. Take shelter now.

02:45.000 --> 02:48.000
Don't go outside. Another message comes in.

02:48.000 --> 02:53.000
Huge hailstorm, quarter size hail, dime size hail, inch size hail.

02:53.000 --> 02:57.000
Like they just keep upping it. They sent three different notifications for the hailstorm.

02:57.000 --> 03:02.000
Then after that passes. Tornado. I'm not even kidding you.

03:02.000 --> 03:06.000
A tornado hits the area. We're just kind of on the edge of it. So we just had a lot of wind.

03:06.000 --> 03:12.000
Then I'm not kidding you. We get flash flooding all within the span of three hours.

03:12.000 --> 03:18.000
None of this was in the forecast. And it starts when it's one hundred and four degrees outside.

03:18.000 --> 03:26.000
It's just unbelievable. So there was a slight break in all of this because there was periods of like downtime between each major storm.

03:26.000 --> 03:35.000
And we went out there and the wife and I jury rigged the suspension up with with a bungee cord so we could get down the road and get the hookups.

03:35.000 --> 03:40.000
And get at least air conditioning going. So now I'm sitting in this RV park. I don't even know the name of it.

03:40.000 --> 03:49.000
I don't even know where I am. Just waiting for shops to open so I can see if somebody can fix my damn suspension so I can hobble this thing home now.

03:49.000 --> 03:56.000
That's my world right now. That's my world. How has your week been? I'm sure I'm sure it's been at least slightly better.

03:56.000 --> 04:02.000
Yeah, definitely far less eventful. I did have a little problem, but nothing that involves losing electricity.

04:02.000 --> 04:12.000
So are you aware of these services that, quote unquote, scan websites for malware and other basically like reputation verification stuff?

04:12.000 --> 04:16.000
Oh, yeah. Yeah. In a negative way, I'm familiar with these.

04:16.000 --> 04:25.000
So last week we were doing the show and someone after the show, but it's actually Drew, messaged me in our Slack saying, hey, your site is blocked on edge.

04:25.000 --> 04:30.000
I was like, that's kind of weird. OK. Right. I love that Drew's checking edge for you.

04:30.000 --> 04:37.000
Yeah. And, you know, I have an upcoming launch, which is going to involve, like, you know, advertising and driving traffic.

04:37.000 --> 04:42.000
So it's kind of like, huh, that's a problem. Right. Not that it's, you know, dominant, but edges.

04:42.000 --> 04:47.000
It's doing all right, actually, in the market. It's doing all right. Right. It helps that it's from Microsoft.

04:47.000 --> 04:54.000
So whatever, whatever. So I check. Sure enough, it's blocked on mine. Like, huh, what the hell?

04:54.000 --> 05:00.000
Get the error. This site is known to contain malware. I'm like, what the hell?

05:00.000 --> 05:06.000
This is my business like boring WordPress marketing site. Right. And fairly freshly updated, too.

05:06.000 --> 05:14.000
Yeah, it's updated fairly recently. Right. I mean, we have another sub sub site coming up for the new the product launch.

05:14.000 --> 05:20.000
But that one like isn't that one was fine, which is where it's up. If you're clever, you can find interesting.

05:20.000 --> 05:25.000
OK, but we're not, you know, officially launched. So I'm getting nervous because, you know, I'm making arrangements,

05:25.000 --> 05:30.000
advice, keywords, all that good stuff. And I can't for the life of me figure out what the hell is going on.

05:30.000 --> 05:34.000
So I read the error. It's malware. I'm like, that's kind of weird.

05:34.000 --> 05:39.000
So then I have a couple of my guys are digging into it and I'm digging into it.

05:39.000 --> 05:47.000
And I find that there's some like services I had never heard of that have listed the site as malware.

05:47.000 --> 06:00.000
And what it looks like has happened is a lot of the big name browsers and like virus detection tools actually buy their ratings list from other services.

06:00.000 --> 06:05.000
Right. It's like a lot like how the a lot like how the spam blacklist works for some mail providers,

06:05.000 --> 06:09.000
like a couple of different groups put together these lists and then people just subscribe to these lists.

06:09.000 --> 06:13.000
And whatever goes on there gets blocked. It's not like they're not checking it.

06:13.000 --> 06:18.000
Yeah. Finally, I found this like no name company that apparently thought the site had malware.

06:18.000 --> 06:23.000
There's like a whole petition process I went through. And for the life of me, I couldn't figure out when.

06:23.000 --> 06:27.000
And they don't want to respond to you with, like, you know, an actual response.

06:27.000 --> 06:33.000
I eventually got an email from somebody. And what caused them to flag my website as malware?

06:33.000 --> 06:36.000
It's like a wild guess. Hmm. OK. All right. OK.

06:36.000 --> 06:45.000
I'm going to guess they're using some scanner and the scanner picked up like some like best practice kind of issue.

06:45.000 --> 06:48.000
I couldn't I don't know what it would be. No. OK. What?

06:48.000 --> 07:04.000
Apparently, they just scanned it. And for a three day period, I had a nonlinked private URL security through obscurity to share an XE of an internal piece of software we use as a team with an outside source.

07:04.000 --> 07:07.000
Oh, like just throwing it up there so you could get a link for somebody.

07:07.000 --> 07:10.000
I just threw it on the server just to get them the link. Oh, man.

07:10.000 --> 07:16.000
And their policy, their policy is they don't care what it is.

07:16.000 --> 07:20.000
If the extension is dot XE, it's malware.

07:20.000 --> 07:25.000
Yeah, I suppose because they figure like you could you could name something notepad XE and it could be a root kit or something.

07:25.000 --> 07:30.000
Right. They don't check. So which is interesting, though, because, like, well, let's say you have a website and then you have like an FTP server.

07:30.000 --> 07:35.000
But let's say it's open. Does that mean your website's automatically listed as blacklisted?

07:35.000 --> 07:41.000
Because there were ISPs that you couldn't get to my site from that bought the service and blocked it at the ISP level.

07:41.000 --> 07:45.000
You know, it's interesting that Chrome must be using a different list than edges.

07:45.000 --> 07:48.000
So I've learned a lot about this. Google does their own.

07:48.000 --> 07:53.000
Ah, this service is weird because it sells the ISPs and enterprises.

07:53.000 --> 07:57.000
And I guess Microsoft SmartScreen must somehow also use it.

07:57.000 --> 08:05.000
But it's like when I finally got more information about it, they have a whole unpublished list of things that they consider no nose.

08:05.000 --> 08:10.000
Although ironically, if you have a DMG file, which is a Mac executable, they don't they don't care.

08:10.000 --> 08:14.000
Oh, jeez. Well, I suppose it's not directly. I mean, because you have to mount it first.

08:14.000 --> 08:18.000
But or even like a dot app, a dot app would be directly.

08:18.000 --> 08:24.000
Right. Or like if you have a XE in a zip, they don't they don't they don't get that.

08:24.000 --> 08:31.000
Yeah, that's good. Yeah, that's fine. And it's actually one of the features they sell on where they say we check malicious executables.

08:31.000 --> 08:35.000
But like they consider any executable malicious.

08:35.000 --> 08:41.000
So my thinking in this is if I was selling independent software directly again and it was for Windows.

08:41.000 --> 08:46.000
That would preclude me from having like some secret URL where you can, like, you know, download.

08:46.000 --> 08:50.000
Yeah, you have to have like a separate demo site or something or even like a demo, right?

08:50.000 --> 08:55.000
Even like a shareware version. Yeah. Yeah. Huh. Well, you know, in a way, it's a good thing.

08:55.000 --> 09:02.000
You were even able to track it down at all. If it was, say, Chrome and it was Google's automatic search discovery thing.

09:02.000 --> 09:05.000
How would you ever get anybody to do anything or tell you anything about it?

09:05.000 --> 09:12.000
I mean, it took it took quite a bit of effort to get a response. But yeah, oh, man, that's tedious and totally not what you want to be working on.

09:12.000 --> 09:16.000
Well, it's one of those things that like it's obnoxious, but like ultimately it is my problem.

09:16.000 --> 09:21.000
Yeah, I kind of I mean, in this case, it seems a little extreme and it's always kind of an embarrassing look, too.

09:21.000 --> 09:25.000
And it's like, right. So now I you know, I look like my site's been compromised.

09:25.000 --> 09:28.000
And if anybody comes across this in their browser, what are they going to think?

09:28.000 --> 09:33.000
Well, they're not going to like hire us or buy anything from us. Right. Right. That's the problem.

09:33.000 --> 09:39.000
Yeah. Yeah. Thanks, God. Yeah. She's so rough week all around.

09:39.000 --> 09:48.000
Well, zero wrote in and he said some of the hit home. And I've been seeing this a lot on like Hacker News comments and Reddit and other places.

09:48.000 --> 09:53.000
He thinks essentially the desktop Linux train sailed a long time ago.

09:53.000 --> 09:57.000
And it's just time that we take lessons and start over with something fresh.

09:57.000 --> 09:59.000
I don't know if he has like fusion mind or what he says.

09:59.000 --> 10:13.000
Imagine building and documenting the best repairable computer in the land with a Unix like OS that is great for everyday tasks when that computer is built by an advertising powerhouse that is environmentally friendly and their message is taken seriously.

10:13.000 --> 10:16.000
Then the next renaissance will kick off.

10:16.000 --> 10:22.000
I think a lot of people feel this way, that, you know, we're just on the verge of a breakthrough with right to repair.

10:22.000 --> 10:29.000
He says we should continue pushing for repairable devices and take a general strike on devices that aren't repairable.

10:29.000 --> 10:35.000
And while I like the sentiment, it's just never going to happen. And I don't mean to crap on this idea.

10:35.000 --> 10:38.000
I feel like we need to work within the constraints of reality here.

10:38.000 --> 10:47.000
For a lot of people, an easy to repair laptop is driving 25 minutes to a store and handing them your laptop.

10:47.000 --> 10:55.000
And, you know, they take care of it. And then you come back two days later and they hand you either a repaired laptop or a brand new laptop.

10:55.000 --> 10:59.000
For a lot of people, that's that's the kind of repairability they want.

10:59.000 --> 11:06.000
I don't know. He says, I heard a wise man who said the choice that makes you more independent is often the harder one, but the more correct choice.

11:06.000 --> 11:14.000
Building and joining huge communities dedicated to spreading awareness for decentralized kind of movement would do wonders for a renaissance.

11:14.000 --> 11:16.000
We're just on the verge of a renaissance, Mr. Dominic.

11:16.000 --> 11:19.000
I don't buy it. OK.

11:19.000 --> 11:23.000
Do you think his point about the desktop train for Linux has sailed?

11:23.000 --> 11:28.000
It's a weird mixed metaphor, but I've seen similar sentiments online a lot recently.

11:28.000 --> 11:33.000
Like people just sort of getting to the point of they missed the boat. They missed the opportunity.

11:33.000 --> 11:37.000
They have the server. They have most of mobile. They have a lot of IoT.

11:37.000 --> 11:40.000
Isn't that enough? They being Linux, the desktop, they miss that.

11:40.000 --> 11:46.000
And it just seems to be like something people are casually throwing around on in online conversations now.

11:46.000 --> 11:51.000
I mean, I certainly feel like for me, like a year ago, I was much more optimistic about it.

11:51.000 --> 11:58.000
Well, probably two years ago. See, it's difficult to say this without getting into gnome bashing, but.

11:58.000 --> 12:05.000
Yeah, it definitely sailed. Right. But it wouldn't be it wouldn't be desktop Linux if it wasn't the way it is.

12:05.000 --> 12:10.000
Right. Just the fact that like. This is weird, right? Because like Pantheon is good.

12:10.000 --> 12:16.000
Gnome is good. KDE is fine if you're a psychotic. But.

12:16.000 --> 12:21.000
The gnome is not good. Right. Pantheon is good up to their resources.

12:21.000 --> 12:27.000
And I like, you know, the Danielle and Cassidy and it's fine, but it.

12:27.000 --> 12:31.000
It's just, you know, it's elementary, right? It's not it's not a huge project.

12:31.000 --> 12:35.000
I mean, it's huge relative to open source, but it it's not Mac OS is my point. Right.

12:35.000 --> 12:41.000
Yeah. There's always a way that you can look at a gnome Pantheon or less so KDX.

12:41.000 --> 12:49.000
I feel like Katie is kind of. More doing its own thing, which I definitely respect and I respect all these projects.

12:49.000 --> 12:54.000
All right. You know, everybody knows I'm a show for System 76. I've read the comments.

12:54.000 --> 13:00.000
I really thought it was going to get there because of pop. But what's happened with pop.

13:00.000 --> 13:03.000
And if you're careful, you can kind of see this on Twitter.

13:03.000 --> 13:07.000
They have this weird, uncomfortable relation, and this is me, like I know I've spoken to them at this.

13:07.000 --> 13:12.000
Not at all. Right. This is not them. This is me. They seem to have this weird relationship with Gnome.

13:12.000 --> 13:16.000
That's not really good or healthy or healthy.

13:16.000 --> 13:21.000
And every once in a while, late at night, you'll see one of the engineers over there just like bitch that bitch out.

13:21.000 --> 13:24.000
You know, right. And it's well deserved.

13:24.000 --> 13:30.000
And, you know, I've I've spoken to Neil from the Gnome Foundation. So it regarding other things.

13:30.000 --> 13:35.000
And I'm not like saying anybody's right and it is wrong. Just a difference of vision, really.

13:35.000 --> 13:39.000
Well, it's an inefficiency. Right. Like, how do you make the Linux desktop better?

13:39.000 --> 13:46.000
You make it Mac. Right. You have one desktop unified, controlled. This is what you get.

13:46.000 --> 13:50.000
But then it wouldn't be Linux. I don't think that would fly for the Linux community.

13:50.000 --> 13:54.000
Hmm. I can I can see where a lot of people are coming from.

13:54.000 --> 13:58.000
And I hate to also relitigate the past, but I can see a few pivotal moments.

13:58.000 --> 14:04.000
I think the Gnome 2 to Gnome 3, KDE 4 era.

14:04.000 --> 14:11.000
I just say Wayland. Yeah. The long transition to Wayland, this transition away from to unity and also the transition away from unity on canonical side.

14:11.000 --> 14:18.000
And then at a at a higher, more important level, because I think all of those were were some significant paper cuts,

14:18.000 --> 14:25.000
but they weren't the death blow. But I think what also has played a huge factor here and it's going to be obvious as soon as I say it is mobile.

14:25.000 --> 14:31.000
And the commercial operating systems just did a lot better job at integrating into a mobile ecosystem.

14:31.000 --> 14:38.000
And maybe that's only like when it comes to like streaming services and music streaming and the kind of stuff that consumers are into.

14:38.000 --> 14:41.000
They nailed that stuff better, especially on the Mac and iOS side.

14:41.000 --> 14:50.000
But, you know, really just on the Mac on iOS side, but they did a lot better job where Linux didn't really ever get off the ground with the strategy there.

14:50.000 --> 14:53.000
And ironically, you can build all this stuff yourself.

14:53.000 --> 14:57.000
Like you could set up a pretty nice Linux workstation with the plasma desktop.

14:57.000 --> 15:02.000
You get the right kernel, you get the right configuration, the right hardware, and then you install something like KDE Connect.

15:02.000 --> 15:09.000
And you've got integration better than between your desktop and an Android device, better than anything any commercial desktop operating system is doing.

15:09.000 --> 15:16.000
But it's just not it's not in a way that a commercial industry could package up and run with.

15:16.000 --> 15:29.000
And you then had also just through these changes in toolkits and desktop strategies and and sort of a singular developer story never emerging properly for the desktop in particular.

15:29.000 --> 15:32.000
I think you never got a lot of traction with commercial applications.

15:32.000 --> 15:38.000
And so the commercial vendors out there, like the stereotypical Adobe's, they remain committed to the platforms they already support.

15:38.000 --> 15:42.000
And there was never really any value in supporting the Linux platform.

15:42.000 --> 15:49.000
And I think over time, a lot of people just decided that was not an acceptable compromise for them.

15:49.000 --> 15:56.000
So for many, many people that have those requirements, the desktop train did sail, if you will, a long time ago.

15:56.000 --> 16:05.000
And then you have a slow sort of coming to terms with it that you where you see people kind of popping off online where they've hit their limit and they're just popped off.

16:05.000 --> 16:11.000
And now they just went and bought themselves an M1, like a Linux content creator that both you and I follow announced on Twitter this weekend.

16:11.000 --> 16:15.000
They just went out and got a MacBook Air M1 and, you know, the whole setup.

16:15.000 --> 16:20.000
Oh, DM me later. I'm curious. I know, right?

16:20.000 --> 16:24.000
No, it's it's it. Well, I just want to like just backtrack a little bit here.

16:24.000 --> 16:33.000
I don't think especially younger listeners will remember like how controversial some of canonicals desktop stuff was just several years ago.

16:33.000 --> 16:40.000
Right. Unity was not like we just tossed out unity like it's oh, yeah, unity, you know, it's hot dogs and beans.

16:40.000 --> 16:44.000
That was a big fight and it was a nasty fight.

16:44.000 --> 16:47.000
And I think it had a significant cost internally at Canonical.

16:47.000 --> 16:50.000
I just want to say this name, Lenard Pottering mean anything to anyone?

16:50.000 --> 16:56.000
Because like there was some and I'm not trying to pick on him visually, but like even back then,

16:56.000 --> 17:04.000
one of the things that kind of always kept me half out of the Linux space was there's a lot of big egos that like are somewhat openly hostile to people making money.

17:04.000 --> 17:08.000
Right. That too. That is definitely a thing that has been even worse in the past.

17:08.000 --> 17:15.000
Yeah, it's it's just easier to I mean, this is where I think elementary does an awesome job.

17:15.000 --> 17:24.000
They get in a way that I don't even think like honestly, like pop does like elementary understands what you need to provide.

17:24.000 --> 17:29.000
They do have a thriving indie developer ecosystem and frankly, an app store.

17:29.000 --> 17:34.000
They give you an SDK. You can do other things, but they bless a specific set of APIs and language.

17:34.000 --> 17:39.000
And in their case, it's Vala. Whether you think Vala is a good choice or not, it's a little weird.

17:39.000 --> 17:42.000
I would have gone with something a little more mainstream in the other world, but it's a good language.

17:42.000 --> 17:46.000
It is very similar to C sharp.

17:46.000 --> 17:54.000
And you know what? If you want to be a app developer on elementary and obviously it can cross over to other GNOME based test apps,

17:54.000 --> 18:01.000
then they have a beautiful developer site that is documented and you can go do that.

18:01.000 --> 18:04.000
Right. And the software center that you can monetize with.

18:04.000 --> 18:08.000
I'm sorry. I call that the apps or software center. Right. And they not only do they make it possible,

18:08.000 --> 18:19.000
they make it easy and they seem to understand the mindset of an independent developer in a way that even like canonical just frankly did not with the canonical software center.

18:19.000 --> 18:21.000
I'm sorry, the Ubuntu software center.

18:21.000 --> 18:25.000
They just sort of lack the critical mass to make that impact.

18:25.000 --> 18:30.000
And it really needed to be something that would be cross distribution, too.

18:30.000 --> 18:37.000
What they've what elementary has done needs to, say, be applicable to every GNOME slash GTK based desktop environment.

18:37.000 --> 18:42.000
And if that was the case, then you'd have a pretty clear developer story, but you just don't.

18:42.000 --> 18:46.000
It's one of those things like one of my dark fantasies is that, you know, because this is way inside baseball.

18:46.000 --> 18:52.000
But Cassidy used to work at System 76 that like they were Dell would just simply by elementary.

18:52.000 --> 19:00.000
Right. Make it proprietary and say this is our Linux desktop and basically make the Mac OS of Linux.

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
I await your hate mail.

19:02.000 --> 19:09.000
I'd like to see Dell do that and then System 76 focus on delivering an environment to more power users, which is what I like.

19:09.000 --> 19:11.000
I like that they're doing that with pop. Yeah.

19:11.000 --> 19:14.000
Pop definitely is like, are you an engineer? Great. Right.

19:14.000 --> 19:18.000
Yeah. And that, you know, that is something I still think really works for Linux.

19:18.000 --> 19:30.000
And I kind of wonder if that isn't a completely and totally valid market all on its own to address is the engineers and the developers and the sys admins out there.

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
Like, it seems like that's a plenty good market.

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
It just means we're not going to get a ton of commercial applications.

19:34.000 --> 19:45.000
And I see what I what I'm still struggling with is a is a larger position where I'm trying to change my mindset like that, like that content creator who switched to the M1.

19:45.000 --> 19:52.000
I'm trying to change my mindset into thinking you can still be a Linux user and even a Linux advocate and not use it on the desktop.

19:52.000 --> 19:56.000
And I inherently don't believe it, but I'm saying it and I'm trying to make myself believe it.

19:56.000 --> 20:01.000
Because like when I saw that tweet that he grabbed an M1, I was like, you got to be effing kidding me.

20:01.000 --> 20:06.000
And I realized I was doing the tribalism thing that I just ranted about last week.

20:06.000 --> 20:09.000
Yeah. You were asking a question. Let's let's take somebody like me. Right.

20:09.000 --> 20:14.000
I program primarily for Linux servers and then like little IOT devices that are almost all running Debian.

20:14.000 --> 20:21.000
But their servers are running out of Ubuntu or SUSE because, you know, if you're saying you're running SUSE, excuse me.

20:21.000 --> 20:24.000
I just I just got a little sick in my mouth. Do you need to clean up?

20:24.000 --> 20:28.000
Do you need to like a little wet nap? I need to lay down for a minute.

20:28.000 --> 20:33.000
But I do the most of that, like the majority of the time now I'm doing that on a Mac.

20:33.000 --> 20:36.000
Right. Am I not developing for Linux?

20:36.000 --> 20:41.000
That's the exact question that I have been kicking around in my head since this weekend and maybe even a little bit longer.

20:41.000 --> 20:45.000
And I think you are because you're creating software for Linux.

20:45.000 --> 20:50.000
You're selling a product that runs on Linux. You're just doing it from a different operating system.

20:50.000 --> 20:53.000
Can I take it to the next logical step? Yeah.

20:53.000 --> 20:57.000
Let's say I could mathematically prove that I developed more software more efficiently,

20:57.000 --> 21:03.000
less errors running Mac OS because of whatever familiarity, whatever tooling I'm used to.

21:03.000 --> 21:05.000
Then I do one, let's say Ubuntu.

21:05.000 --> 21:12.000
Wouldn't it be in the best interest of, quote, Linux community for me to actually be a Mac user?

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
Assuming the output is better software.

21:14.000 --> 21:19.000
Let's just say as a premise to the argument, we proved it mathematically that it was so.

21:19.000 --> 21:25.000
Yeah. Hmm. And you could probably make the same argument for somebody who's sticking with Windows, but maybe using WSL.

21:25.000 --> 21:29.000
Well, and isn't WSL just Linux anyway, right? Without the desktop.

21:29.000 --> 21:34.000
And although they actually can run like desktop applications, so they're even blurring the line further.

21:34.000 --> 21:37.000
I'd like to know what the audience thinks. Coder.show slash contact.

21:37.000 --> 21:41.000
I think we have to expand the definition to say yes.

21:41.000 --> 21:45.000
I think it does. I think we can't consider the definition to be just a desktop user.

21:45.000 --> 21:50.000
Tyler wrote in, he said, regarding 429, where you talked about the Linux Foundation director using a Mac.

21:50.000 --> 21:54.000
I agree that on the grand scale tribalism should end, he says.

21:54.000 --> 22:01.000
But I think people, the Linux foundations should represent Linux, the community, not the Linux corporate deep pocket.

22:01.000 --> 22:05.000
That's just my take. Love the show. Keep up the great work. Thanks, Tyler.

22:05.000 --> 22:11.000
There is also an extreme example. Like, should the people running the Linux Foundation be running Linux?

22:11.000 --> 22:18.000
And is it different than, say, Satya Nadella using a Mac instead of a surface?

22:18.000 --> 22:22.000
I don't think people the Linux Foundation see Linux as a desktop product at all.

22:22.000 --> 22:25.000
I don't even think it factors in. That's exactly what I was going to say.

22:25.000 --> 22:30.000
If we were to like Wonder Woman last saw the Linux Foundation board members, they'd be like, yeah, Linux is a kernel.

22:30.000 --> 22:37.000
And a set of technologies that we help get adopted in the market. And it's not desktop technologies.

22:37.000 --> 22:46.000
This actually ties right into the previous conversation, because if you define Linux as software that runs atop the Linux kernel,

22:46.000 --> 22:52.000
I'm sorry, as the kernel itself, and then being in the Linux community is writing software that runs on Linux,

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
then that is a very broad definition.

22:54.000 --> 23:02.000
Because really the fighting, the stupidity, the tribalism happens at the user land layer of, and I don't use land, it's a wrong word, don't jump down my throat.

23:02.000 --> 23:08.000
How many times have I bitched about GNOME not being able to run extensions without crashing?

23:08.000 --> 23:13.000
Yeah, I mean, I think you're right. A lot of the tribalism is at the user level. I think that's fair.

23:13.000 --> 23:23.000
I think in that world, it actually has to be okay for the people running the Foundation to not use Linux, assuming that everything the Foundation runs.

23:23.000 --> 23:25.000
But they are using Linux. Wait, wait, wait, wait.

23:25.000 --> 23:26.000
On the server?

23:26.000 --> 23:33.000
Not just on the server. That's ****. In their house, in their home, I guarantee you, there are devices that are running Linux.

23:33.000 --> 23:34.000
True, true.

23:34.000 --> 23:40.000
They may not know it, right? Listen, my mom runs Linux. If I told her, she'd have a heart attack, but actually she wouldn't care.

23:40.000 --> 23:47.000
But she does run Linux, but she just doesn't know. She doesn't know. I know because her stupid coffee machine crashed and it was a Debian prompt.

23:47.000 --> 23:48.000
Oh, that's amazing.

23:48.000 --> 23:49.000
Yeah.

23:49.000 --> 23:53.000
I don't think I'd consider her a Linux user though, right? I think maybe the line is-

23:53.000 --> 23:55.000
Why not? Why not? She hits a button on-

23:55.000 --> 23:56.000
Because it's not by choice.

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
She voluntarily bought that machine.

23:58.000 --> 23:59.000
True.

23:59.000 --> 24:03.000
No one put a gun to her. Isn't that winning? See, isn't this winning? Winning?

24:03.000 --> 24:09.000
Seriously, if we have regular people who are just, you know, random ladies in their 50s who are accountants, right?

24:09.000 --> 24:15.000
That bought a coffee machine for a stupid amount of money because she really likes cappuccino.

24:15.000 --> 24:17.000
This is another conversation we won't go into.

24:17.000 --> 24:27.000
But like this stupidly expensive coffee machine is in fact running a single board computer with Debian.

24:27.000 --> 24:34.000
Is that not creating regular real world Linux users?

24:34.000 --> 24:37.000
Everybody with a Nest thermostat is running Linux.

24:37.000 --> 24:38.000
I suppose, yes.

24:38.000 --> 24:41.000
Everybody with a Chromebook, right? Everybody with an Android phone.

24:41.000 --> 24:52.000
I mean, if you broaden the definition to the point of Linux is the kernel, then not only has Linux just like wildly won on market share, it's dominant.

24:52.000 --> 24:53.000
Right.

24:53.000 --> 24:59.000
And everybody you know is a Linux user, unless like there's the five guys who like intentionally buy things with BSD on them.

24:59.000 --> 25:01.000
They frighten me. They exist.

25:03.000 --> 25:08.000
lino.com slash coder. Go there to get $100 in 60 day credit on your new account.

25:08.000 --> 25:13.000
And of course, you go there to support the show. You know, this here show is made possible by you taking advantage of our sponsors offer.

25:13.000 --> 25:17.000
And Linode is one that we can enthusiastically recommend and endorse.

25:17.000 --> 25:19.000
They've been around for 18 years.

25:19.000 --> 25:27.000
They are the largest independent cloud provider in the world with 11 data centers and nearly a million customers and businesses around the globe.

25:27.000 --> 25:34.000
But for the last 18 years, they have focused on making cloud computing simple, affordable and accessible and reliable.

25:34.000 --> 25:37.000
I think that's definitely worth mentioning and performance.

25:37.000 --> 25:40.000
That's the number one reason why I chose Linode initially.

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
And now I stick with them for a ton of reasons.

25:42.000 --> 25:46.000
I use the crap out of their S3 compatible object storage.

25:46.000 --> 25:50.000
Anything that can talk S3 can talk to Linode's object storage.

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
So I use it for the back end of next cloud.

25:52.000 --> 25:55.000
We use it for just sharing files when we don't need to necessarily use next cloud.

25:55.000 --> 25:58.000
I've used it to share videos and movie clips.

25:58.000 --> 26:01.000
Maybe I want to send somebody a link to something instead of putting in a large attachment.

26:01.000 --> 26:03.000
I put it up on object storage.

26:03.000 --> 26:09.000
And one of the things I love about it is they have a Linode command line client and you can do all kinds of stuff.

26:09.000 --> 26:10.000
It's not just for object storage.

26:10.000 --> 26:17.000
We can manage your systems, but it'll also manage object storage, upload files, mark them public, etc.

26:17.000 --> 26:21.000
It's so quick and handy to just point that thing at a file, get it up on the object storage and share it.

26:21.000 --> 26:24.000
They also have super fast networking, one click application deployment.

26:24.000 --> 26:30.000
So if you just want to test something, you can deploy an entire stack or you do like I do.

26:30.000 --> 26:35.000
I'll often just deploy a base system with a container runtime, get everything right.

26:35.000 --> 26:37.000
One of the things I like about Linode is they build them really smart.

26:37.000 --> 26:40.000
I've gone through them with a fine tooth eyeball, I guess.

26:40.000 --> 26:41.000
And they've looked at their setup.

26:41.000 --> 26:45.000
I've looked at the repos they're using, made sure everything's legit using the correct GPG keys.

26:45.000 --> 26:47.000
It's all there.

26:47.000 --> 26:54.000
And on top of that, they have these community stack scripts that are pretty neat and you can audit them and see what they're going to do and sometimes swap out different distributions.

26:54.000 --> 26:58.000
And if you really need to get down to the metal, they'll even let you do custom OS loads.

26:58.000 --> 27:03.000
I've done that before and rumor has it they're also working on bare metal systems.

27:03.000 --> 27:04.000
How about that?

27:04.000 --> 27:10.000
You know, there's really just no better time to try out Linode because right now you get $100 and you support the show.

27:10.000 --> 27:15.000
And it's a great way to send them a message and say, hey, going into the next year, keep supporting the Koder radio program.

27:15.000 --> 27:19.000
If some of you take advantage of our offer right now, right before I send them an email saying, hey, guys, you want to renew?

27:19.000 --> 27:22.000
It would work out great.

27:22.000 --> 27:24.000
So go over to Linode.com slash Koder.

27:24.000 --> 27:29.000
If you ever run into any trouble, they've got the best customer support in the biz.

27:29.000 --> 27:32.000
Phone, ticket, chat, even social.

27:32.000 --> 27:33.000
They're going to help you with that.

27:33.000 --> 27:37.000
Plus, they have hundreds of guides and tutorials and their community support runs deep.

27:37.000 --> 27:40.000
You know, they made our Jupiter colony reunion trip possible.

27:40.000 --> 27:50.000
And I didn't really understand even when I was booking it, how important that was going to be to get out there and get to see some people and and realize that our audience is real people out there in the real world.

27:50.000 --> 27:59.000
I can't tell you how helpful mentally that is for me because I kind of live in this social media echo chamber getting feedback via email and Twitter.

27:59.000 --> 28:02.000
So to go out there and meet people, it keeps me going.

28:02.000 --> 28:05.000
It keeps me energized when I'm stuck down here in Tucson at 100 degrees.

28:05.000 --> 28:06.000
And Linode made that possible.

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
I mean, that's going to keep me going for a while.

28:08.000 --> 28:13.000
I really appreciate their support of some of my favorite open source projects through hosting and monetary support.

28:13.000 --> 28:17.000
They're just a class act and I can fully endorse them.

28:17.000 --> 28:19.000
So go check them out at Linode.com slash Koder.

28:19.000 --> 28:28.000
Get one hundred dollars and 60 day credit on your new account and support the show at Linode dot com slash Koder.

28:28.000 --> 28:31.000
Well, we have a couple of more emails to get into.

28:31.000 --> 28:40.000
Parker wrote in to tell us all about how he uses his phone, which is like a one plus six to work with a remote keyboard and do everything on the road.

28:40.000 --> 28:45.000
And then when he needs an extra screen, he just Chromecast it to his monitor and he has V.S. code on there.

28:45.000 --> 28:47.000
He says it doesn't break a sweat.

28:47.000 --> 28:50.000
LTE connectivity means he has data just about everywhere he goes.

28:50.000 --> 28:53.000
I think he's kind of laughing at us with our big laptops.

28:53.000 --> 28:58.000
But the best part, he's 12 years old and a child shall lead them.

28:58.000 --> 29:00.000
All right. All right.

29:00.000 --> 29:03.000
No, it would be. Yeah. OK.

29:03.000 --> 29:06.000
I'm glad it works for you. I know.

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
I mean, it's a neat idea.

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
You know, he has he's on to something.

29:10.000 --> 29:13.000
I kind of like it, but it just wouldn't work for me, I don't think.

29:13.000 --> 29:16.000
No, it wouldn't work for me. But no, seriously, if that works for you, that's awesome.

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
And obviously, especially for young people, right?

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
Sometimes access to hardware is a challenge.

29:20.000 --> 29:24.000
Whenever almost all these kids have phones now, which is disturbing to me.

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000
But yeah, good on you, Parker.

29:26.000 --> 29:31.000
Yeah. And it's a great way to get by when you don't have the budget as a 12 year old to buy a bigger computer.

29:31.000 --> 29:34.000
I mean, I bet I bet he could compile Objective C on his phone.

29:34.000 --> 29:37.000
Hmm. Hmm. Our last email comes in from Rosetti.

29:37.000 --> 29:41.000
He noticed a nice update for V.S. code that he thought might interest us.

29:41.000 --> 29:45.000
He says, I think Microsoft was listening to your complaints very closely as they do.

29:45.000 --> 29:46.000
As of course.

29:46.000 --> 29:53.000
And the Visual Studio Code update for September has revved up the Python extension support.

29:53.000 --> 29:56.000
Of course, if you've already got it before, you might want to go get an update.

29:56.000 --> 29:59.000
They are touting all kinds of new features in here,

29:59.000 --> 30:05.000
including the Intellisense support has been updated for Python 2.7.

30:05.000 --> 30:10.000
Hey, yeah. Yeah. Wonderful. I know.

30:10.000 --> 30:14.000
But I wanted to give it an honorable mention because I know you love this extension

30:14.000 --> 30:17.000
and it just got a nice update. They fixed 80 bugs in it.

30:17.000 --> 30:19.000
You know, they did the whole thing.

30:19.000 --> 30:27.000
They've also updated the hosted version of Visual Studio Code to have top grade Python editing support now, too.

30:27.000 --> 30:29.000
So that's nice to see.

30:29.000 --> 30:33.000
Yeah, this is this is great. I mean, I, you know, make it better.

30:33.000 --> 30:35.000
I use it every day. So there you go.

30:35.000 --> 30:37.000
Keep making it better. Yeah. Keep making it better.

30:37.000 --> 30:40.000
If you want to send us an email, we'd love it. Coder dot show slash contact.

30:40.000 --> 30:43.000
Anything you want to talk about, we want to hear about it.

30:43.000 --> 30:46.000
And just a reminder, I am still on the road.

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
Eventually, I guess I'm parked at the moment.

30:48.000 --> 30:52.000
I'm stuck in Tucson for a couple of days, but I don't plan to stay here.

30:52.000 --> 30:56.000
So as soon as I get it fixed, I'm getting the hell out of here.

30:56.000 --> 30:58.000
Tucson is hell. I'm sorry, guys.

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
If you live in the Tucson area, I don't know how you do it.

31:00.000 --> 31:03.000
Just about every town I visited on this road trip, I've liked a lot.

31:03.000 --> 31:07.000
Salt Lake City kind of sucked because the wildfires were super bad.

31:07.000 --> 31:09.000
And Salt Lake City had the worst air quality in the world at the time.

31:09.000 --> 31:12.000
And I never got to leave the campground because I was working so much.

31:12.000 --> 31:14.000
So I couldn't really enjoy Salt Lake City.

31:14.000 --> 31:20.000
But Tucson, I have been stuck here the entire time and there is nothing to do here.

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
And there's no shade.

31:22.000 --> 31:26.000
And the only place to go is the top of Mount Lemmon or LeMond.

31:26.000 --> 31:28.000
I don't know how you pronounce it.

31:28.000 --> 31:32.000
It's a nice drive and there's a lot of cool ecosystem stuff to look at.

31:32.000 --> 31:37.000
But you got to go up eight thousand feet into the air to get down to 70 degrees.

31:37.000 --> 31:39.000
Wow. So I'm not shitting you, dude.

31:39.000 --> 31:43.000
There were a couple of days, two of them, where we didn't know what else to do.

31:43.000 --> 31:46.000
So we just got in the car and we were getting heat exhaustion.

31:46.000 --> 31:49.000
And so we got in the car and we drove to the top of this mountain

31:49.000 --> 31:53.000
and we pulled over into a parking spot and just slept because we were so exhausted

31:53.000 --> 31:55.000
and not sleeping well because it was so hot.

31:55.000 --> 31:57.000
It's been hell.

31:57.000 --> 32:00.000
So probably not sticking around in Tucson very long.

32:00.000 --> 32:03.000
Could have tried to get up to Flagstaff and then get up north faster.

32:03.000 --> 32:08.000
But if you're going to be on my route, go over to ColonyTracker.live

32:08.000 --> 32:11.000
if you're in this area and watch where we head.

32:11.000 --> 32:15.000
And if it looks like I'm heading your direction, there is a micro meetup link on that page.

32:15.000 --> 32:18.000
Let me know. I'm still doing micro meetups on the way home.

32:18.000 --> 32:21.000
I love getting a bite with Coder audience members.

32:21.000 --> 32:24.000
They're some of my favorite. Don't tell the other podcasts.

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
But the Coder radio listeners are some of my favorite.

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
It's because he's secretly a Mac fan.

32:28.000 --> 32:30.000
What? How dare you, sir? How dare you?

32:30.000 --> 32:34.000
Besperch me like that. Besperching me.

32:34.000 --> 32:39.000
Apple is delaying the rollout of its CSAM detection that we talked about not too long ago.

32:39.000 --> 32:41.000
Apple says they're going to hit the pause button

32:41.000 --> 32:44.000
and take additional time over the coming months to collect input

32:44.000 --> 32:47.000
and make improvements before releasing these, quote,

32:47.000 --> 32:50.000
critically important child safety measures.

32:50.000 --> 32:52.000
Did Apple just get majorly embarrassed?

32:52.000 --> 32:54.000
Do they actually blink?

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
Yeah, they've had a couple of rough weeks PR wise.

32:56.000 --> 32:59.000
Yeah, there's also that employee Slack channel they shut down about fair pay,

32:59.000 --> 33:03.000
which, let's be honest, I can understand why they shut that thing down.

33:03.000 --> 33:05.000
I mean, I think you and I will agree on this.

33:05.000 --> 33:08.000
The way you prevent these problems, Apple, is you don't allow it in the first place.

33:08.000 --> 33:10.000
This is like the base camp thing.

33:10.000 --> 33:14.000
They got a lot of hay for being progressive, whatever, blah, blah, blah.

33:14.000 --> 33:17.000
At your core, your business, your job is to make money.

33:17.000 --> 33:22.000
So it is a great policy to have, if you were the owner of a business,

33:22.000 --> 33:25.000
that people are not to discuss their pay

33:25.000 --> 33:30.000
and your business communications are to be used for the business.

33:30.000 --> 33:34.000
You're not a social whatever, right?

33:34.000 --> 33:36.000
You're not an activism group, you're a business.

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
Keep it that way.

33:38.000 --> 33:43.000
I guess it's attractive from a PR perspective to pretend like you are,

33:43.000 --> 33:46.000
and that just, I mean, that base camp right in the butt, right?

33:46.000 --> 33:49.000
Isn't that the same kind of line that Apple is walking?

33:49.000 --> 33:51.000
Well, it's the same thing, right?

33:51.000 --> 33:55.000
They talk about pay inclusivity, they talk about getting diversity right at the company,

33:55.000 --> 33:58.000
but then when the employees start talking about it amongst each other,

33:58.000 --> 34:00.000
they shut that thing down fast.

34:00.000 --> 34:03.000
Well, it's like, and they're always careful to, with their keynotes,

34:03.000 --> 34:07.000
track how many of what types of people go on stage, right?

34:07.000 --> 34:11.000
They do all this stuff, and that's great, I guess,

34:11.000 --> 34:14.000
but the minute it starts costing the company money or the executives strife,

34:14.000 --> 34:17.000
notice how quickly they shut it down.

34:17.000 --> 34:19.000
I don't know, to me at the core, if you're a business,

34:19.000 --> 34:21.000
why are you pretending to be anything else?

34:21.000 --> 34:22.000
Right.

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
There's no shame in being a business.

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
Well, they don't want to look as just a business, though.

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
They want to look at, they want to be Apple,

34:28.000 --> 34:31.000
the company that's changing the world through health

34:31.000 --> 34:35.000
and through environmental activism and all that kind of stuff, right?

34:35.000 --> 34:39.000
They want to be seen as a progressive company,

34:39.000 --> 34:42.000
and it's all part of their branding.

34:42.000 --> 34:44.000
There's no such thing.

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
No animal exists.

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
I know, that's the great thing about this story,

34:48.000 --> 34:52.000
is it kind of like, it's the crack in the veil that shows you the reality

34:52.000 --> 34:55.000
that they're a business, just like the business you're probably working,

34:55.000 --> 34:58.000
the listeners probably working at right now.

34:58.000 --> 35:01.000
It's the same kind of like, at the end of the day,

35:01.000 --> 35:03.000
they exist to make money,

35:03.000 --> 35:07.000
and if you screw with the money source, they're not going to tolerate it.

35:07.000 --> 35:11.000
And that's why they allow cute dog chat and funny dad joke Slack channels,

35:11.000 --> 35:14.000
but they're not allowing equal pay Slack channels.

35:14.000 --> 35:17.000
But to your point, they should just have no non-work chatter, right?

35:17.000 --> 35:20.000
It should just be all official work all the time,

35:20.000 --> 35:24.000
so that way now they're not playing favorites and getting called out for it.

35:24.000 --> 35:27.000
Yeah, I mean, granted, you can't sit on everybody's shoulder and monitor,

35:27.000 --> 35:30.000
well, I guess you can actually monitor every Slack communication,

35:30.000 --> 35:34.000
but I doubt you're going to dump on people for doing,

35:34.000 --> 35:38.000
hey, happy birthday to Maria because it's her birthday, right?

35:38.000 --> 35:41.000
Or, hey, John, congratulations on having the kid.

35:41.000 --> 35:43.000
Of course you're going to have some non-work chatter,

35:43.000 --> 35:46.000
but maybe the company systems are not a platform

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
for discussing political or social issues.

35:48.000 --> 35:49.000
I don't know.

35:49.000 --> 35:52.000
Because what if one manager is a conservative and one is a liberal?

35:52.000 --> 35:54.000
Does that mean they can't work together?

35:54.000 --> 35:56.000
That seems crazy to me.

35:56.000 --> 35:59.000
What you're essentially saying then is go set up a private chat

35:59.000 --> 36:02.000
for those conversations, and for a tight-lipped company like Apple,

36:02.000 --> 36:03.000
that causes leaks.

36:03.000 --> 36:06.000
Well, no, I'm saying if you and I are both, you know,

36:06.000 --> 36:09.000
hardcore progressives, which I think it's safe to say we're not,

36:09.000 --> 36:11.000
listen to one filter.

36:11.000 --> 36:13.000
Sorry, Chris, I didn't mean to out you.

36:13.000 --> 36:15.000
And we work together, right?

36:15.000 --> 36:18.000
We should do that somewhere else other than JB, right?

36:18.000 --> 36:21.000
We should like meet at a bar or something.

36:21.000 --> 36:24.000
And like that's our private time, that's our private forum.

36:24.000 --> 36:27.000
We are people who are entitled to full lives,

36:27.000 --> 36:29.000
and I'm not saying people can't have opinions,

36:29.000 --> 36:34.000
but I don't think it should be in the company chat.

36:34.000 --> 36:38.000
But the problem is that requires you have the nerve

36:38.000 --> 36:41.000
to actually have social interactions with people

36:41.000 --> 36:43.000
and ask the hard questions.

36:43.000 --> 36:47.000
And the brilliant thing about our modern society is now you can order food

36:47.000 --> 36:49.000
without ever having to see or talk to the delivery person.

36:49.000 --> 36:52.000
You can order a car and say you don't want to talk to them,

36:52.000 --> 36:54.000
and you can set up Slack channel so you never have to have

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
these uncomfortable conversations in person.

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
Come on, man. Really?

36:58.000 --> 37:00.000
I think that's part of why it happens.

37:00.000 --> 37:03.000
We're always bitching that some of our fondest memories before COVID

37:03.000 --> 37:06.000
were for me, you know, doing the system 76 super fan thing

37:06.000 --> 37:10.000
or some of the little developer conventions that I would go to

37:10.000 --> 37:12.000
when I lived up in New York and now down here in Tampa.

37:12.000 --> 37:13.000
Oh, I agree.

37:13.000 --> 37:15.000
Honestly, like, you know this.

37:15.000 --> 37:18.000
I'm usually probably one of the most conservative people in the room,

37:18.000 --> 37:19.000
right?

37:19.000 --> 37:21.000
I don't mind dealing with other people.

37:21.000 --> 37:24.000
What's wrong with dealing with other people?

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
I think it's a social anxiety thing that a lot of people have.

37:26.000 --> 37:29.000
They don't want to have these hard conversations in person.

37:29.000 --> 37:34.000
And so they've migrated to text chat and Slack was just the low hanging fruit.

37:34.000 --> 37:36.000
I think it just think about this.

37:36.000 --> 37:41.000
This problem, pay inequity, has existed as long as businesses have existed.

37:41.000 --> 37:42.000
Sure, of course.

37:42.000 --> 37:45.000
Employees had to sort this out before Slack existed.

37:45.000 --> 37:50.000
It's just that Slack was the easiest, least socially awkward way to do it.

37:50.000 --> 37:54.000
And so more people at a larger scale than ever were able to take advantage of it.

37:54.000 --> 37:57.000
But I'm not trying to defend in equal pay.

37:57.000 --> 38:01.000
Like if two people are doing the same job, they should be making the same wage regardless.

38:01.000 --> 38:03.000
That's self-evident and obvious.

38:03.000 --> 38:07.000
What I am arguing here for, though, is that there is a way for employees to handle this

38:07.000 --> 38:11.000
that doesn't actually use, I'm sorry, employer resources.

38:11.000 --> 38:14.000
You know, this story has been played really negative for Apple.

38:14.000 --> 38:17.000
And I think the only reason it has is for the reason you pointed out, that it goes against

38:17.000 --> 38:20.000
their sort of progressive image that they like to put out there.

38:20.000 --> 38:25.000
But if Apple, if this was coming from Bank of America or if it was coming from Boeing,

38:25.000 --> 38:27.000
everybody would be like, yeah, of course, Boeing's doing that.

38:27.000 --> 38:29.000
They shouldn't be, but of course they are.

38:29.000 --> 38:33.000
But because it's Apple, it's this whole, oh my gosh, oh my gosh, does Tim Cook know about this?

38:33.000 --> 38:36.000
You know, does he know? Tim Cook's progressive.

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
It's just ridiculous.

38:38.000 --> 38:42.000
It's more of the breathless coverage that people have around all of this.

38:42.000 --> 38:46.000
And I think the bigger story in a way, and it's overshadowed, is the fact that they actually

38:46.000 --> 38:48.000
blinked over this CSAM stuff.

38:48.000 --> 38:49.000
It's probably not gone.

38:49.000 --> 38:51.000
It's probably going to come back in some other form.

38:51.000 --> 38:53.000
Oh, it's not gone. It's not gone. Yeah.

38:53.000 --> 38:55.000
The whole thing seems weird.

38:55.000 --> 38:57.000
It just came out of nowhere.

38:57.000 --> 38:59.000
Like they didn't talk about it at WWDC.

38:59.000 --> 39:03.000
It's a major aspect of the operating system, and they didn't even mention it.

39:03.000 --> 39:06.000
And then mid-August, they announced it.

39:06.000 --> 39:10.000
And then by September, they've retracted it with no new deadlines.

39:10.000 --> 39:15.000
And that's just left looming over iOS users that one day this thing's going to get deployed on their system.

39:15.000 --> 39:17.000
Yeah, but I mean, I think ATP covered this really well.

39:17.000 --> 39:21.000
There's something going on over at Apple where the PR is just getting killed.

39:21.000 --> 39:25.000
Although I say that, but they did that great coup where they snookered most of us, frankly,

39:25.000 --> 39:27.000
in the potosphere or whatever you want to call it.

39:27.000 --> 39:29.000
Right around the new app store, concessions, quote unquote.

39:29.000 --> 39:31.000
Which are not, in fact, concessions.

39:31.000 --> 39:33.000
You get nothing, right?

39:33.000 --> 39:35.000
Yeah, that is a savvy PR game.

39:35.000 --> 39:37.000
No, they behave like a business.

39:37.000 --> 39:42.000
They care and thought into where they make money, and they were sloppy with everything else.

39:42.000 --> 39:44.000
That makes it, actually, yeah.

39:44.000 --> 39:47.000
Totally lines up.

39:47.000 --> 39:51.000
The other thing, you know, they announced that I was kind of uncomfortable with,

39:51.000 --> 39:56.000
but really has gotten very little critical reception, is the iCloud Relay.

39:56.000 --> 39:59.000
They're privacy-centric, like half VPN.

39:59.000 --> 40:00.000
Like, really?

40:00.000 --> 40:04.000
You're just going to take all my traffic, and I have the iOS beta on my iPad.

40:04.000 --> 40:09.000
And every time I connect to Wi-Fi, I get a notification telling me that all my traffic is being relayed through iCloud.

40:09.000 --> 40:13.000
I can't imagine that Verizon's particularly happy about that kind of thing.

40:13.000 --> 40:15.000
Because I know they, you know, for those who don't know,

40:15.000 --> 40:18.000
your ISP almost certainly sells your internet traffic.

40:18.000 --> 40:19.000
Right.

40:19.000 --> 40:23.000
Well, and wireless carriers are also trying to make sure that you're not streaming too much video or whatever,

40:23.000 --> 40:25.000
and they want to reshape your packets.

40:25.000 --> 40:28.000
And if it's going through some sort of quasi-VPN.

40:28.000 --> 40:32.000
Although it is important to say that iCloud Relay is not, in fact, a VPN.

40:32.000 --> 40:35.000
It is just like a proxy relay, yeah.

40:35.000 --> 40:37.000
But it's happening, and nobody really seems to care.

40:37.000 --> 40:42.000
And it's like, that seems like a point where an authority could come along and ask for records,

40:42.000 --> 40:47.000
and Apple would have to produce them, and now your internet traffic is all on file at Apple.

40:47.000 --> 40:52.000
Right, but without it, your internet traffic is all on file with your ISP anyway.

40:52.000 --> 40:54.000
True.

40:54.000 --> 40:57.000
And in the case of mobile, your ISP is your carrier, right?

40:57.000 --> 40:59.000
So I don't know. I mean, I feel...

40:59.000 --> 41:03.000
And it feels like a little bit with the CSAM stuff and this iCloud Relay stuff,

41:03.000 --> 41:07.000
if you don't trust Apple to manage and run this thing properly,

41:07.000 --> 41:09.000
you probably shouldn't be buying an iPhone.

41:09.000 --> 41:11.000
Maybe that's your sign.

41:11.000 --> 41:13.000
But your other choice is to trust Google.

41:13.000 --> 41:14.000
Yeah, I know.

41:14.000 --> 41:16.000
And forget about Apple and Google.

41:16.000 --> 41:18.000
You got to trust Verizon or AT&T or whatever.

41:18.000 --> 41:19.000
Is T-Mobile still around?

41:19.000 --> 41:20.000
Yeah.

41:20.000 --> 41:25.000
You know, John, that crazy guy with the pink shirt's gone, so I don't pay attention to him anymore.

41:25.000 --> 41:27.000
Right. It's the only time I cared.

41:27.000 --> 41:30.000
Yeah, you know, Google's already doing the CSAM scanning, too.

41:30.000 --> 41:32.000
Yeah, Google's been doing it. They're like, all right, whatever.

41:32.000 --> 41:35.000
We've been doing it in Google Photos for like 10 years. What do you want?

41:35.000 --> 41:38.000
Yeah, so you're not going to get away from it.

41:38.000 --> 41:43.000
Speaking of pain, I understand that my buying seven laptops a year is about to get more expensive.

41:43.000 --> 41:45.000
Oh, yeah, yeah.

41:45.000 --> 41:49.000
This is, you know, I worried about this about three or maybe six months ago.

41:49.000 --> 41:51.000
I said, we're going to get to a point where the price is going to go up

41:51.000 --> 41:54.000
and the only company that can afford to buy chips is going to be Apple.

41:54.000 --> 42:00.000
Well, now we have a report that TSMC is expected to prepare its biggest price hike in a decade,

42:00.000 --> 42:04.000
which is going to impact many sectors, including like cars and other tech sectors.

42:04.000 --> 42:10.000
But it seems that TSMC is also looking to weed out so-called double bookings

42:10.000 --> 42:13.000
that a lot of companies have done in which clients place orders for more chips

42:13.000 --> 42:17.000
than they actually need just to try to get enough inventory so they can hoard, I suppose.

42:17.000 --> 42:23.000
I don't know, but it's made it hard for TSMC to really get an idea of what the real picture is.

42:23.000 --> 42:27.000
So part of the reason they're raising the rates is to make it too expensive for people to do that.

42:27.000 --> 42:32.000
And the smaller nanometer processors are where the prices are going to go up the most, a.k.a. Apple.

42:32.000 --> 42:34.000
But Apple is going to just pay a ton of money into this thing.

42:34.000 --> 42:38.000
They've already announced that Apple has signed a new contract and they're going to go all in.

42:38.000 --> 42:42.000
And so Apple is going to get their chips made and everybody else is going to fall in line

42:42.000 --> 42:44.000
and they're all going to have to pay more.

42:44.000 --> 42:47.000
And you think about it like not a lot of them have the margins like Apple does.

42:47.000 --> 42:52.000
Apple could afford to eat this cost raise or they could happily pass it on to consumers.

42:52.000 --> 42:55.000
And Apple consumers would pay the increased price.

42:55.000 --> 43:01.000
If they have to raise the price by $200 or $150 on a laptop, Apple consumers are going to pay that

43:01.000 --> 43:08.000
where Dell consumers and HP consumers might not or Chromebook buyers where it's even more price sensitive.

43:08.000 --> 43:13.000
I really feel like we are entering into this crazy awkward two-year lag

43:13.000 --> 43:19.000
where the tech industry is just kind of going to stagnate where we don't have really increases in GPU speed.

43:19.000 --> 43:26.000
We don't have any actual practical increases in CPU speed because nobody can get the parts out in the market except for Apple.

43:26.000 --> 43:30.000
And it's happening in the same time frame that they've made this M1 transition.

43:30.000 --> 43:33.000
So they've got a unified hardware platform that is custom to their own.

43:33.000 --> 43:36.000
They've got a unified software platform that is custom to their own.

43:36.000 --> 43:41.000
They've got the pockets and the relationship deep enough with the fab to be the ones to still get the chips

43:41.000 --> 43:46.000
even when there's a shortage and they have the margins where they can eat the price increases.

43:46.000 --> 43:52.000
And I just feel like this is going to be a couple of year period where we're dealing with these supply shortages

43:52.000 --> 43:57.000
where Apple is going to emerge in a way stronger position than they already are

43:57.000 --> 43:59.000
and the rest of the industry is going to be knocked on their ass.

43:59.000 --> 44:02.000
And I don't think this is a good thing at all.

44:02.000 --> 44:06.000
And I was down at System76 and when I talked to Carl six months ago, he's like,

44:06.000 --> 44:09.000
I think in about six months things are going to be turning around.

44:09.000 --> 44:12.000
Well, I was just there and I was just having a new conversation with him about this.

44:12.000 --> 44:17.000
And he's like, I don't think it's getting any better this year and I think it's going to go into next year.

44:17.000 --> 44:23.000
And for System76, they've had to take their own capital

44:23.000 --> 44:26.000
and use that capital to buy the hardware they need.

44:26.000 --> 44:30.000
Like they are spending more for gear than they ever have right now.

44:30.000 --> 44:34.000
And how long can something like that be sustainable across the industry?

44:34.000 --> 44:37.000
I have many feelings on this. All of them are negative.

44:37.000 --> 44:39.000
So, yeah, me too, man.

44:39.000 --> 44:44.000
I guess, I mean, you kind of implied it, but I don't see this as a 18 months to 24 month problem.

44:44.000 --> 44:46.000
I see this as a five year problem.

44:46.000 --> 44:49.000
And we've just stagnated for the last couple of years already.

44:49.000 --> 44:51.000
We're already in a stagnation phase.

44:51.000 --> 44:53.000
OK, so I was going to talk about this week.

44:53.000 --> 44:55.000
I just purchased a gaming laptop that should arrive Wednesday.

44:55.000 --> 44:57.000
Oh, neat.

44:57.000 --> 45:00.000
Yeah, because I'm getting my second shot vaccine time.

45:00.000 --> 45:03.000
I'm going to be dying because apparently if you have a heart condition, you get the vaccine.

45:03.000 --> 45:04.000
It could hurt.

45:04.000 --> 45:07.000
Yeah. First one sucked. Second one's going to suck more.

45:07.000 --> 45:10.000
Yeah. You know what else, though? But assuming you survive, which I hope you do.

45:10.000 --> 45:11.000
I'll survive.

45:11.000 --> 45:14.000
That's going to be fun for you and the boy. Like, that's going to be a blast.

45:14.000 --> 45:17.000
Yeah. So but I'm going to be off for like two days this week.

45:17.000 --> 45:20.000
Yeah. I already planned it. So I got this Lenovo.

45:20.000 --> 45:23.000
It's a Legion. Is that their gaming sub-brand?

45:23.000 --> 45:27.000
Oh, that sounds right. I've never actually really heard anybody that bought a Lenovo gaming laptop.

45:27.000 --> 45:28.000
That's cool.

45:28.000 --> 45:31.000
Well, the price was unbelievable. 64 gigs of RAM.

45:31.000 --> 45:34.000
Whatever stupid Nvidia card.

45:34.000 --> 45:39.000
Two hard drives, one's a terabyte, one's two for like fourteen hundred dollars.

45:39.000 --> 45:42.000
Yeah. What size screen, you know?

45:42.000 --> 45:44.000
I think it's 15.

45:44.000 --> 45:47.000
It looks like I'm looking at their Web page. It looks like it's 15.

45:47.000 --> 45:49.000
That's a nice looking rig, actually.

45:49.000 --> 45:52.000
Yeah, it seems fine. We'll check it. I know. I'll see how it goes.

45:52.000 --> 45:58.000
But that machine, because of this chip shortage, I think is going to be on point for the next three, four years.

45:58.000 --> 45:59.000
Yeah.

45:59.000 --> 46:03.000
Without any like eGPU chicanery or, you know, anything like that.

46:03.000 --> 46:08.000
Because we're just not going to progress the I think particularly I think like GP.

46:08.000 --> 46:16.000
The whole GPU situation is weird because the crypto miners and, you know, how much ML stuff actually runs on GPUs, not CPUs.

46:16.000 --> 46:17.000
Right.

46:17.000 --> 46:29.000
I like I can't get a PS5 with that retail price if I sacrifice a goat and draw a pentagram, you know, in the blood of a Windows 7 user on the ground.

46:29.000 --> 46:31.000
Right. I just it's not going to happen.

46:31.000 --> 46:39.000
No, I don't think so. And Ford has like parking lots of trucks that they can't sell because they have no, you know, no chips.

46:39.000 --> 46:50.000
So I don't see. I guess I like even if one, it's super bad that TSMC produces such a high percentage of the world's chips.

46:50.000 --> 46:54.000
Like maybe competition would be a good thing.

46:54.000 --> 46:57.000
Like my kind of can we have one of Mike's nationalistic wet dreams?

46:57.000 --> 47:00.000
Oh, yeah, I love those. Let me get my notepad.

47:00.000 --> 47:05.000
I think Apple needs to like Tim Cook needs to go away.

47:05.000 --> 47:16.000
When you get somebody who's more like Steve Jobs that wants to own the entire stack and they just need to build a factory in some flyover state and like, I don't know, man.

47:16.000 --> 47:20.000
There are Republicans everywhere who will give you tax incentives and charge, you know, income tax.

47:20.000 --> 47:25.000
Right. Like if you employ the people in their state who are on the dole, like maybe we should just do this.

47:25.000 --> 47:28.000
I mean, Tesla's moving to Texas for that reason.

47:28.000 --> 47:36.000
Do you think, though, Steve Jobs, I think I think was under Steve Jobs watch, probably with Tim Cook running operations that they, you know, it was Tim Cook who pitched it.

47:36.000 --> 47:40.000
Yeah. Yeah. Well, I mean, the whole the whole China, the manufacturing thing happened under his watch.

47:40.000 --> 47:46.000
So I don't know if he would undo that. Well, so the challenge is like there used to be lots of manufacturing companies in China.

47:46.000 --> 47:50.000
Yeah. And now for this, it's basically a TSMC.

47:50.000 --> 47:53.000
Intel does some of their own fabbing. Yeah, it's Intel.

47:53.000 --> 48:00.000
But, you know, like nobody's really. But they're Intel. Yeah. And Intel's just like sort of struggling getting their own together right now.

48:00.000 --> 48:09.000
That's really the rough part is like Intel Intel could have been in a great position right now to, you know, to be the source of parts.

48:09.000 --> 48:14.000
But it just seems like they're too busy doing restructure after restructure internally.

48:14.000 --> 48:21.000
You know what just occurred to me? This is the third or fourth week that we have harped on the failure of Intel to, I guess,

48:21.000 --> 48:24.000
basically do the do the process shrink. Right.

48:24.000 --> 48:32.000
Well, it's kind of disappointing in a way, because if I could snap my fingers, I would I would like to see x86 getting all these gains that you see on the arm side.

48:32.000 --> 48:40.000
I would love to see x86 just continue on for another 20, 30 years as the performant low power option in the market.

48:40.000 --> 48:43.000
It's not it's not going to know. But wouldn't that have been amazing?

48:43.000 --> 48:46.000
Wouldn't that have been best case scenario for software compatibility purposes?

48:46.000 --> 48:55.000
It would have been. I mean, although having said that, well, I should have mentioned this. So the Lenovo I ordered is running the new Ryzen, whatever, fancy.

48:55.000 --> 48:58.000
Oh, yeah, sure. Mm hmm. Yeah, it's nice to see that actually shipping now.

48:58.000 --> 49:06.000
AMD is doing some interesting stuff on the, you know, x60, whatever, AMD 64 architecture.

49:06.000 --> 49:11.000
But, you know, throw an M1 at somebody and watch them cry.

49:11.000 --> 49:14.000
Right. I mean, the problem is the M1 is just like, hey, we're just better in almost everywhere.

49:14.000 --> 49:21.000
Especially for people who care about the power usage, you know, because I was looking at many AMD systems and they're pulling in like 60, 70 watts.

49:21.000 --> 49:25.000
And I was looking at Mac mini systems for the same job and they're pulling in like 30 watts.

49:25.000 --> 49:27.000
That's a big deal when you're on solar.

49:30.000 --> 49:35.000
Datadog.com slash Coder Radio. You know, this episode of Coder Radio is sponsored by Datadog.

49:35.000 --> 49:40.000

So go check out Datadog, support the show and start monitoring your environment in real time with their fantastic dashboards.

51:04.000 --> 51:07.000
That's Datadog.com slash Coder Radio.

51:10.000 --> 51:13.000
I feel a challenge in the air, Mr. Dominic.

51:13.000 --> 51:14.000
Challenge!

51:14.000 --> 51:19.000
I saw you tweeting about 100 days of code and my eyes and ears perked up.

51:19.000 --> 51:29.000
Yeah, so you know, we get a lot of feedback and I particularly get a lot of trolling about the, I forgot what it was, seven languages in seven months or something we did with Wes.

51:29.000 --> 51:32.000
And I want to do something bigger than it, right?

51:32.000 --> 51:37.000
So I keep seeing this on Twitter, this 100 days of code thing, and every once in a while I'll tweet something.

51:37.000 --> 51:40.000
But it's kind of hard because I don't want to tweet out like client code.

51:40.000 --> 51:49.000
And so I've been tweeting out like the new Alice stuff, but I feel like there should be some way.

51:49.000 --> 51:58.000
And honestly, I'm curious for your feedback for like not to recreate the language challenge, because I think that was actually in a weird way too hard.

51:58.000 --> 52:05.000
It's just like going from zero to new language in a week was not fun.

52:05.000 --> 52:15.000
But to do something similar to that where it's like, for instance, you know, the new version of Alice is actually written on fast API, which a thousand thank you's to Wes because he recommended that to me.

52:15.000 --> 52:22.000
So I've been doing a lot of flask before and flask is great, not distinct flask, but fast API is pretty cool.

52:22.000 --> 52:29.000
The guy who made it also has something called SQL model, which is an interesting other library coming out or that has come out.

52:29.000 --> 52:43.000
That seems like content that people would like to hear about and that might help people in our audience who are thinking about picking up some Python or are Python developers, but maybe are working on something a little more mainstream like Django.

52:43.000 --> 52:48.000
Behind that, I'm thinking also about Maui, which for folks who don't know, I don't know why you wouldn't know this.

52:48.000 --> 52:53.000
Maui is the new like dotnet six unified stack.

52:53.000 --> 53:01.000
That might be interesting to look at, but I see I don't know, right, Chris? The problem is the universe of like new development tools coming out.

53:01.000 --> 53:05.000
It's like so big. How would I narrow this down?

53:05.000 --> 53:10.000
Yeah. And how to make it useful for people right in a way that actually provides value. That is tricky.

53:10.000 --> 53:19.000
You know, Solomon on Twitter suggested talking about the challenges that programmers face and if a hundred day challenge of coding could help.

53:19.000 --> 53:29.000
Like like I've used I've used personal challenges in the past to learn something new, like each day challenge myself to try something in a new way or do a new thing.

53:29.000 --> 53:35.000
Is that useful? I mean, I definitely feel that the hundred day challenge in particular.

53:35.000 --> 53:40.000
Which helps because, you know, the more you write code, the better at it you are.

53:40.000 --> 53:47.000
I I definitely feel that myself, like if I go, you know, a couple of days where I don't write any like meaningful code.

53:47.000 --> 53:54.000
I I make more stupid mistakes. I have to look things up a little more, you know, like indie jams where it's like what I need to do.

53:54.000 --> 53:58.000
So they call those before COVID. They used to do them all the time.

53:58.000 --> 54:05.000
You'd like go to some vendor who had an API, have pizza and build like a little stupid app on their API.

54:05.000 --> 54:11.000
Hackathons, hackathons. Oh, yeah, sure. I will say for the for the coding challenge, we do it West.

54:11.000 --> 54:16.000
It definitely forced me out of my comfort zone in a lot of ways, right? Yeah, that can be good, which is good.

54:16.000 --> 54:22.000
Not necessarily a good thing if you're smack dab in the middle of an intense project, but it can be good if you've got the capacity.

54:22.000 --> 54:26.000
Right. So I guess they're good. I mean, you just don't take it too far, right?

54:26.000 --> 54:34.000
Like I like to do a little code contest just about every day with their little coding puzzles and I do a rotation of languages on them.

54:34.000 --> 54:39.000
Although, spoiler alert, Ruby and Objective C are actually falling out of the rotation.

54:39.000 --> 54:45.000
My two favorites. Oh, no. Yeah. You should write somebody, you know, complain a little bit.

54:45.000 --> 54:49.000
Maybe they'll change it. No, I mean, I'm I'm not. No, the prompt is just the prompt.

54:49.000 --> 54:56.000
You do it in whatever language you want. It's me. Oh, what? Yeah. Are you OK?

54:56.000 --> 55:03.000
Do you need to lie down? It's just not practical. I spend more time in Python and C sharp and C plus plus.

55:03.000 --> 55:10.000
The times are changing. All right, well, we could get some input from the audience.

55:10.000 --> 55:15.000
They could tweet you at Dumanuco or they could email us coder dot show slash contact.

55:15.000 --> 55:19.000
Give us some ideas because I like what I like.

55:19.000 --> 55:22.000
I think the idea of making it useful and valuable to people is a good one.

55:22.000 --> 55:27.000
So that way they can take something from it if they participate or not possibly.

55:27.000 --> 55:34.000
Exactly. Hmm. Although we did do a challenge once before the Katy Perry challenge and I still use that advocate.

55:34.000 --> 55:38.000
Oh, yeah. That's true. Yeah, that is true. Yeah.

55:38.000 --> 55:41.000
One of these days we're going to do a plasma challenge, I tell you what.

55:41.000 --> 55:46.000
Could do a could do Python. You know, our friends over at a cloud guru have data preparation for Python, of course.

55:46.000 --> 55:50.000
Now, that's right. They'll quickly cover how to connect to various database types.

55:50.000 --> 55:52.000
That's good. Then we'll jump into using pandas.

55:52.000 --> 55:59.000
So everybody likes a panda. And I'll look at examples of cleansing, missing and outline data, as well as data visualizations and explorations.

55:59.000 --> 56:06.000
So if you got to get your data cleansed or you got to do some exploration and you want to know about pandas and it's time to get a little happy with the snake,

56:06.000 --> 56:12.000
they have got data preparation for Python. We'll have a link in the show notes or you can go to cloud guru dot com for that.

56:12.000 --> 56:15.000
But I have a sense that Python is probably not going to be one of the challenges.

56:15.000 --> 56:18.000
Maybe that could be fun. Well, like fast API could be a challenge, though.

56:18.000 --> 56:21.000
Right. It's a new framework. So that's the thing I'm thinking.

56:21.000 --> 56:26.000
Like, that's my whole thing. I don't think the challenges should just be languages.

56:26.000 --> 56:33.000
There's a big difference between writing, let's say, C++ because you're like coding in the unreal engine and writing C++

56:33.000 --> 56:38.000
because you're, you know, writing something for an IOT device. Right. Sure.

56:38.000 --> 56:41.000
There's a Python in particular is just like huge. Right.

56:41.000 --> 56:47.000
Python ML code is very, very different than Django website code or flask website code.

56:47.000 --> 56:55.000
Python IOT code, which for those who don't know, the reason people use Python IOT other than it being like really.

56:55.000 --> 57:02.000
Enjoyable to work in is Python is like a like, see, basically there's a layer you can.

57:02.000 --> 57:07.000
In fact, there's a Jesus. I forgot the name of the thing, but you can compile it down.

57:07.000 --> 57:10.000
See, Cython, see, on what the hell is it? I don't remember.

57:10.000 --> 57:12.000
Someone will correct us in the feedback. We'll have it next week.

57:12.000 --> 57:15.000
But yeah, I like it. I like the idea a lot.

57:15.000 --> 57:19.000
You know, you see you ruminate in there before that second shot and you're getting some good ideas.

57:19.000 --> 57:21.000
It's like shower thought time. Do you have shower thoughts?

57:21.000 --> 57:23.000
Is that a thing for you where you're in the shower and you get your best idea?

57:23.000 --> 57:29.000
You know, I figure out what's wrong with my SQL crews, the shower all the time, like all the time.

57:29.000 --> 57:35.000
There's something about the shower and Postgres that really it's just it works for me.

57:35.000 --> 57:37.000
It clicks. I don't know. Just goes together. Yeah.

57:37.000 --> 57:40.000
A hot, steamy shower and Postgres that that's a show title.

57:40.000 --> 57:44.000
Steamy Postgres shower. I bet our Coder QA team members already know all about it.

57:44.000 --> 57:50.000
You know, we post the Coderly report for them every quarter and you can support the show by going to Coder QA dot co.

57:50.000 --> 57:57.000
You help us stay independent. You get a limited ad feed and you get that special bonus Coderly episode every quarter.

57:57.000 --> 58:00.000
Always recorded in a Coder bathrobe. Boy, oh, boy.

58:00.000 --> 58:07.000
I you know, Mike and I know Mike knows because we've been talking about this off air, but people are still sending in their robe emails about how much they love them.

58:07.000 --> 58:10.000
Honestly, man, I think you need I think you need to. It's time.

58:10.000 --> 58:13.000
You think it's no, it's well, of course, but it's time for Robe V2.

58:13.000 --> 58:17.000
Maybe I've been thinking about it or slippers, slippers.

58:17.000 --> 58:21.000
I think the number one thing that has made me feel really good is people thought it was going to be high quality,

58:21.000 --> 58:23.000
but didn't expect it to be as high quality as it is.

58:23.000 --> 58:29.000
And so I feel like we got that part of it right now. It's really just a matter of like being able to ship on time,

58:29.000 --> 58:32.000
be able to, you know, source it and all that kind of thing. So I got to start looking into that.

58:32.000 --> 58:36.000
Who cares? People are waiting months for for GPUs right now.

58:36.000 --> 58:44.000
They'll wait a couple of months for a robe. Tell you what, tweet tweet at Dumanuco your robe pictures and I will harass Chris with them.

58:44.000 --> 58:48.000
All right. So at Dumanuco for his personal account, the company is at the Mad Botter Inc.

58:48.000 --> 58:50.000
I'm over there at Chris LAS.

58:50.000 --> 58:55.000
The whole network is at Jupiter Signal. And this here podcast has its own handle on the Twitter at Coder Radio Show,

58:55.000 --> 58:59.000
which is good for news announcements and releases. Is there anywhere else you want to send people, Mr.

58:59.000 --> 59:03.000
Dominic? Not yet. But if I ever ship this last goddamn 20 percent, I will.

59:03.000 --> 59:10.000
No kidding, right? Oh, we all wait in anticipation. Well, links to what we talked about today are at Coder dot show slash four three zero.

59:10.000 --> 59:14.000
You'll also find our contact form over there, our RSS feed so you can subscribe.

59:14.000 --> 59:18.000
Turns out it's a Web page. So what we've done is we've hyperlinked a bunch of stuff.

59:18.000 --> 59:23.000
You just go to Coder dot show for our hyperlinks using the hypertext transfer protocol.

59:23.000 --> 59:25.000
You're going to love it. And you can always join us live.

59:25.000 --> 59:28.000
We do it at Mondays at noon Pacific, three p.m.

59:28.000 --> 59:30.000
Eastern over JB Live dot TV.

59:30.000 --> 59:33.000
We love having you join the chat room and help us title this here show.

59:33.000 --> 59:36.000
But that does wrap us up for this episode of the Coder Radio program.

59:36.000 --> 59:49.000
We'll see you right back here next week.
