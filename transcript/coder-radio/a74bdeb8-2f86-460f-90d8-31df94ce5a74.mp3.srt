00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,760
This is KOTOR Radio, episode 465 for May 9th, 2022.

2
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:19,460
Well hey, good looking, welcome in to Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show, taking a

3
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:25,160
pragmatic look at the art and the business of software development and the world of technology.

4
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:29,080
Sitting right here in Seattle, my name is Chris and our host joining us from the East Coast

5
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:30,080
is Mr. Dominic.

6
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:31,080
Hello, Mike.

7
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:37,680
Hey, welcome to Florida and also brought to you by CNN plus, wait, what, what happened?

8
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,160
You canceled us already?

9
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:40,160
Yeah.

10
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:43,320
Well, you were, you enjoying Jake Tapper's book club?

11
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:44,560
You know, that was their big hit, right?

12
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:46,760
I actually thought that was a joke.

13
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:48,160
I didn't think it was real.

14
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:49,160
That was real?

15
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:50,160
Yeah.

16
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:51,160
Yeah.

17
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:53,640
I liked Scott Galloway's show, but I liked it, but I kind of didn't like it.

18
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:56,440
It's just like rich, fancy people being rich and fancy.

19
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:59,400
Mmm, living vicariously through CNN plus.

20
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:00,960
Carousel, oh, keep going.

21
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,800
Are you doing all right?

22
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,820
Today is a weird day to be recording.

23
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:10,400
We are like in the sixth day of just like crash after crash after crash in the market.

24
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,960
I mean, it's gleeful for you and I, so I don't know what you're talking about.

25
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:14,960
It is.

26
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,440
We are such twisted bastards.

27
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:17,440
It's so funny.

28
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:19,320
Like the whole market's down.

29
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:24,560
People's 401ks are trashed and I'm not making light of that, but you and I are both like

30
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:25,560
called it.

31
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:30,560
I'm enjoying an Elijah Craig on the rocks as I watch all these motherfuckers burn.

32
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:31,560
It's just, we got feedback.

33
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:35,200
They're like, you guys are old and grumpy and a bunch of doomers and you always think

34
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,360
things are about to go bad.

35
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:39,640
And see about two weeks, three weeks ago, we did a, at the end of the episode, we were

36
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:42,960
just like, hey guys, just so you know, like it's probably going to be kind of economically

37
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:43,960
tough for a bit.

38
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:44,960
And you know, we're out there.

39
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,440
Well, because we lived through the crash, I'm sorry, but we lived through the.

40
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:48,440
The last one.

41
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:53,480
We have a roughly a half a decade between us or a decade almost.

42
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:54,480
It's just a number baby.

43
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:59,760
I know I, I, sweetheart, I love you no matter what, baby, don't worry, but the.com crash,

44
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:00,760
I was too young.

45
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:01,760
Oh, I wasn't.

46
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:02,760
Yeah.

47
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:03,760
Yeah.

48
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:04,760
You, that's what I'm saying.

49
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:08,200
Between us, we've lived through, baby, this is the same song.

50
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:12,120
I don't know why we're being like super in love with each other right now.

51
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:16,040
You know, when, when time gets tough and we, uh, when we get to do a real good solid, told

52
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:18,600
you so you and I just would get close, we get real.

53
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:24,240
You know what this song is about us, honestly, Carly, Simon, the song was also about that

54
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,240
dude.

55
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,240
It's one of those things.

56
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,240
I think it's a small business.

57
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:29,560
You're more tuned into as well because I think that, and I don't mean to characterize it

58
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:33,580
like this in a negative way, but I think a lot of people that pushed back, gave us feedback

59
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:34,800
that like you guys are crazy.

60
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:35,800
There's no crash.

61
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,200
I think they're nine to five version.

62
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:41,200
They just don't watch the market like us, like a business person does because it's just

63
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,380
different consequences.

64
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:43,380
And I'm not saying that negatively.

65
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:45,940
I just think it's a different set of priorities.

66
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:49,120
It's a stupid old folktale, but the canary, it was not really a folktale.

67
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,120
It's true, right?

68
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:55,880
I mean, small business guys, like real small, like our size, we feel everything six months

69
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:56,880
before everybody else.

70
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:57,880
Yeah.

71
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:03,480
I mean, we, our private conversations, you know, you know, I've been taking just hiring

72
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:08,200
these people, the reason, and we're going to get to the feedback, but I'm just a pre

73
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,260
defense.

74
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:16,200
The reason I don't think these wages that kids are asking for sustainable is because

75
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,680
we're going into a crash.

76
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:24,440
Why would anybody want to pay someone 70 plus when they don't have to, when the market will

77
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:27,480
not sustain that wage next year?

78
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:31,960
And that's not really a moral or judgment call on the, on what the wage is or isn't.

79
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:37,560
I would rather hire someone at 65 and, and as a young kid at a college and keep them

80
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:42,840
for five years, then hire them at 70, have them be non-profitable, non-sustainable and

81
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,600
have to frankly let them go.

82
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:48,840
I think the thing that you and I are not quite saying out loud, but what we both see coming

83
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:53,680
is a flip in the market where it's been really those who are looking to get a job.

84
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:57,480
It has been their market and it has been a really great time to look for a job.

85
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:01,240
And when a recession hits, that tends to reverse that trend.

86
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:05,920
And there is actual psychological studies that show that people transition from a, you

87
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:10,920
should be lucky to have me mindset to a, a job that just pays the bills so we can get

88
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:11,920
by mindset.

89
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:15,120
It's not a, it's not a great, it's not a great place to be emotionally for the country.

90
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:19,560
Well, first of all, our country is schizophrenic, but you told me I can't do any more than filter

91
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:20,560
content.

92
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:28,480
So, um, also folks, if you're running out of recession, if you're feeling cold, perhaps

93
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:34,240
General Electric or JCP and L or New Jersey central power and light, all companies who've

94
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:40,760
tried to turn my lights off at one point, if you're cold, wrap yourself in the comfort,

95
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:48,640
the love, the judgment free affection of a Coderradio rope.

96
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:49,640
That's so great.

97
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:50,640
Hey, you know what?

98
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:55,840
Looking back, man, and reflecting on that, the Coderradio robe was at the, what now feels

99
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:58,440
like kind of the beginning of the supply chain issues.

100
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:59,440
Right?

101
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,440
No, you're right.

102
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:01,440
We were there, right?

103
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:05,520
We couldn't get, listen, if folks who don't have a Coderradio robe, I couldn't get threads

104
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:06,520
and stuff.

105
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:09,820
It was like it kept coming down to thread and folks that don't have, we should describe

106
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:10,820
the robe, right?

107
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:11,820
It's a black robe.

108
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:12,820
It's a bathrobe, right?

109
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:13,820
A black robe.

110
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:14,820
Uh, I don't, what do you call the rope?

111
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:19,360
Oh, it's a, it's a type of type of real, it's a really plush towel material that is, it's

112
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:23,160
both towel and robe and I forget the name of it, but we got like a really high quality

113
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,160
one.

114
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,800
So you can even put it on wet, you know, that kind of thing.

115
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:32,520
But the fact that we can't print, like get robes is, man, I couldn't get Ram chips at

116
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:34,480
reasonable prices.

117
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:40,280
And we've been frankly, kvetching about this for what, eight months, 10 months?

118
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:41,280
I suppose.

119
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,280
Yeah.

120
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:43,280
But we've been getting a little more poignant about it recently.

121
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,000
Well, you know, we're in our feelings.

122
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,160
It's a, it's a, it's a season of feelings right now.

123
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,160
I, okay.

124
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,160
So I'm not making light of it.

125
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,320
I know it, it sucks.

126
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,320
The whole tech world is hunkered down right now.

127
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,840
No, it blows.

128
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:58,720
Also there is a silver lining for someone like my dad who was hoping to retire this

129
00:05:58,720 --> 00:05:59,720
year.

130
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:00,720
This sucks.

131
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:04,760
And if you are in your twenties, your thirties, or maybe even your early forties, this could

132
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:06,880
actually be a really great investment opportunity.

133
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,840
No, this is your moment.

134
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:12,240
Also, if you're kind of wondering like what the hell is going on?

135
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,040
Why is everything crashing?

136
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,040
Why is oil down?

137
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,040
Why is gold down?

138
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,040
Why is silver down?

139
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,560
Why are all the tech stocks down?

140
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:22,160
I have been doing a Bitcoin podcast with the Bitcoin dad.

141
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,960
It's called the Bitcoin dad pod.

142
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:24,960
Yeah.

143
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:25,960
Okay.

144
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:26,960
It is.

145
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:27,960
Yep.

146
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:31,840
In episode five, we talk about the overall monetary system and the issues there.

147
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:36,520
And then in episode 14, we talk about issues that are going on with some of the major assets.

148
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:39,560
So the Bitcoin dad, he's traditionally trained in economics.

149
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:42,600
He went to school for that to become like a big economic egghead.

150
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:46,040
So he has a really sound understanding of the economy.

151
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:49,400
And then I chime in on the technicals and stuff like that and just help move the show

152
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,400
along.

153
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:54,240
But episode five, the whole show has been really good, but five and 14, even if you're

154
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:59,120
not interested in Bitcoin and you just want to understand what the hell is going on at

155
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,300
the bigger picture.

156
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:04,780
Why I'm recommending this is it's a really level-headed take.

157
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:09,000
It's weirdly non alarmist, even though we're talking about stuff at a pretty massive scale.

158
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:14,540
Well, we're almost certainly going to be in a 1970s level recession.

159
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:16,760
There is some real fundamentals that would suggest that.

160
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:19,440
And so also I'm saying is if you're curious, go check out that, we'll have it linked in

161
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,440
the show notes.

162
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,440
Bitcoin dad, you said?

163
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,440
Yeah.

164
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:23,440
It's the Bitcoin dad pod.

165
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,680
So listen to that.

166
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:27,320
And I just want to say I made a thousand bucks on Dogecoin.

167
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:32,120
And for any IRS agents, this show, much like Tucker Carlson's is not necessarily factual.

168
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,120
Yeah.

169
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,080
Could just be a, what did he say?

170
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,080
A character I play.

171
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,080
Yeah.

172
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:38,080
A character.

173
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,080
Yeah.

174
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,080
It's a character.

175
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,080
Yeah.

176
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:42,080
It's a character who's making money on it.

177
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,080
It's really important that the IRS never listen to the show.

178
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,080
Okay.

179
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:46,080
All right.

180
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,080
There we go.

181
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,080
Moving on.

182
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,080
We do have some feedback.

183
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:52,440
Eddie has a moral dilemma, which we seem pretty qualified to answer.

184
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:53,840
Welcome to dad radio.

185
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,240
We're very upset too.

186
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,240
Okay.

187
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:00,880
So he said, I did some contract work for a company that rhymes with smell and probably

188
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:03,400
due to my hard headedness, I ran into some issues.

189
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,400
I wanted to run past you.

190
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:08,400
You see, I'd get an order to do a job through a small it company I worked for.

191
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:12,760
So like smell was contracting with his small company.

192
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:13,760
Super use of this.

193
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:14,760
Yep.

194
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:19,040
His job was to drive to the job site, usually in Missouri or Illinois, and then complete

195
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,840
the work order that they had sent me.

196
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:23,200
He said he get paid for gas and time on the job.

197
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:27,800
He's fine with all of those details, but the devil was in them details.

198
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:30,160
So here's an example that he want to run past us.

199
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:34,640
So he'd get the order and the order would tell him that they just got a computer that

200
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:38,560
was bought by smell and it needed to get transferred all the settings from their old computer

201
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:40,800
needed to get transferred to the new computer.

202
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:47,660
And on the work order, they specifically told him to use the USB bus and a USB disk to transfer

203
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:53,760
the files, which he said added a considerable amount of time to the billing, just hours.

204
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:56,480
That's going to be slow, slow as yeah.

205
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:00,560
And so he didn't want to be bored out of his mind with the data slowly transferring, watching,

206
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:05,020
you know, you know, 11 megabits a second or whatever it was then probably USB two.

207
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:10,080
So he'd hook it up to the SATA bus or the might even been before SATA, he says, and

208
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:13,160
he just transferred right there over the local disk bus.

209
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:17,000
Of course, now smell didn't like it when he did things that way, but they never really

210
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
fired him.

211
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,640
He just wasn't following orders like a good robot, he says, and he just didn't agree with

212
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:24,440
some of the questionable methods.

213
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,600
Thankfully it was, you know, competent, got the job done.

214
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:31,600
So it was never really an issue, but he wonders what we would do in a similar ethical dilemma.

215
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:36,040
Would you have just gone the USB route and, you know, add another four hours to the bill?

216
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,040
What would you do?

217
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:40,100
Uh, no, the answer is no.

218
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:45,940
I think if smell is who I think smell is, this is not the first time I've heard of something

219
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:46,940
like this.

220
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:53,400
Uh, I'll let Chris speak for himself cause I know there's possibly a relationship there.

221
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:57,280
I've never, I've never dealt with technical support outside of like calling them for my

222
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,280
own stuff.

223
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:00,120
I like how you just like didn't even give the cover.

224
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,120
All right.

225
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,120
So smell, right?

226
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,120
Right.

227
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,120
We're talking.

228
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:05,120
Yeah.

229
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,120
Okay.

230
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,120
But maybe Drew could beep that out.

231
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,120
I don't know.

232
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,120
We'll find out.

233
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,240
I got to tell you, there is a reason that I closed my business account with those people.

234
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:12,240
Smell.

235
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,240
Yeah.

236
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,240
I'm going to have to leave this one alone.

237
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,240
I wasn't super.

238
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,240
Yeah.

239
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,240
Here's what I see.

240
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,240
Cause I've been.

241
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,240
All right.

242
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,240
You've been that guy.

243
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,240
Cause here's the thing, dude.

244
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:22,240
I'm so damn good.

245
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,880
I've been in this position dozens of times, hundreds of times.

246
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,240
This is my default position.

247
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,240
Stop.

248
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,240
I told my fiance that this morning.

249
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,240
I'm so damn good.

250
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,240
I can do this position.

251
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,240
And you know what?

252
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:35,080
I just want to say I'm, there's a reason I'm drinking Elijah Craig at three o'clock of

253
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:36,080
the afternoon.

254
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,080
Well done, sir.

255
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,080
Well done.

256
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,080
Well done.

257
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,200
Oh, you got me there.

258
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:45,720
I would actually very frequently be the guy that was the fastest at getting the task done

259
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:46,720
in the company.

260
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:47,720
And so.

261
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:49,920
Again, not a feature for the fiance, but keep going.

262
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:53,000
Not a great feature for the, for the guys running the company either.

263
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,760
They like to see, you know, if they can send out one guy and he builds six hours to do

264
00:10:56,760 --> 00:11:02,440
a job and I build three hours and the customer is even happier, they're not happy, right?

265
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:03,900
The incentives don't align.

266
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:06,080
So it becomes a question of fraud, right?

267
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,080
Seriously.

268
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:13,040
If, for instance, I do contract development, I think it is my job.

269
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:18,020
And I always, if I can find like a BSD or Apache license package to do something quicker

270
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:21,120
for a customer, I do it in the contracts.

271
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:24,520
It says I'm going to use those kinds of open source stuff anyway.

272
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:28,560
And my goal is to deliver as many deliverables as quickly as possible.

273
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:29,960
And I hope they hire me again, right?

274
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:32,040
You know, I'm with the writer here.

275
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:36,040
I think it's up and you should not do it the bad way to make more money.

276
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:38,440
I would face this issue frequently.

277
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:42,840
And I'll tell you, this is where it makes all the difference to be your own boss versus

278
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:45,560
work for people that are telling you how to do the job.

279
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:52,560
Because the actual solution here is to charge for the overall solution you're providing,

280
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,160
not for the hours it took you to solve it.

281
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,160
Bing, bing, bing.

282
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:56,160
It's called Alice.

283
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,160
Yep.

284
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:58,160
Yeah.

285
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:04,280
So you basically create a standard price for PC transfer, you know, PC transfer is $300.

286
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:07,560
You're incentivized then to get that done as fast as possible.

287
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:08,900
Get it done in 45 minutes.

288
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:10,020
Get it done in an hour, right?

289
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:13,880
Because then you're just making money that so you have to sell it instead of on the hours

290
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:16,960
you have to sell it based on the task of the solution.

291
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:20,280
hourly billing sets up a confrontational relationship.

292
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:22,600
It only makes sense for custom work.

293
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:23,600
Right?

294
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:29,080
Like we have a fantastic customer in Canada, we're doing they're in the agricultural business.

295
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:32,020
But they want things exactly the way they want.

296
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:33,840
They want what they want.

297
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:37,960
So we do it the way they tell us we have a meeting almost every week.

298
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,300
It's fantastic.

299
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:45,420
But for things like maintenance and support of existing hardware, the corruption in hourly

300
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:46,420
billing is terrible.

301
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:50,660
The incentives don't align with the customer or the person doing the billing.

302
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:54,180
The only person that really was had their incentive aligned their incentives aligned

303
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:55,360
there was smell.

304
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:58,680
Can I give you a real example to just just for the listener?

305
00:12:58,680 --> 00:12:59,680
Yeah.

306
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:03,080
So Alice, right, we sell Alice as an annual license.

307
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:06,440
My incentive is one for them to be happy.

308
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:09,560
But also, I'm going to make the same.

309
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:10,560
There's three tours of Alice.

310
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:16,160
But let's say I'm going to make the same, you know, n dollars, let's call it $7,000.

311
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,320
No matter what.

312
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,320
What do you think, Chris?

313
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:21,320
Am I sitting there looking for ways to slow down the job?

314
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:26,160
Or am I as aggressively as possible setting up their Alice instance?

315
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,160
Yeah.

316
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:28,160
And they like that, right?

317
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,160
They want that.

318
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:30,160
Yes.

319
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:33,720
I understand where Eddie's coming from when he's not the boss, and so it's like for him,

320
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:37,040
the moral dilemma is do I keep my job and do it the slow way?

321
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:40,000
And then you know, the other thing is you got to like try to look busy during all that

322
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,720
time because the customers are always kind of keeping an eye on you.

323
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,840
You know, you're in a bad position, man.

324
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:47,240
Like it doesn't sound like Eddie's there anymore.

325
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:53,520
But Eddie, can I recommend a different company who bills so much and cancels people's credit

326
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:54,720
accounts?

327
00:13:54,720 --> 00:14:03,360
I won't call them plum, but they might be a pear or an orange, perhaps.

328
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:07,520
Certainly not a Macintosh, which is a specific type of fruit.

329
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:09,920
You want to do an apples to apple kind of comparison, you're saying?

330
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:12,040
Oh, I definitely don't want to do that.

331
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:13,040
No.

332
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:15,160
Well, I got really good news.

333
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:17,080
Special announcement.

334
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,560
Longtimer Remy has written back in.

335
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:19,560
Oh, God.

336
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:20,560
Did he summon Egon?

337
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:21,560
Sorry.

338
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:26,400
He says, I am a longtime listener, but I'm not as long nor as famous as Egon.

339
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:28,000
That's how he starts his email.

340
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,400
Every email, honestly, should be getting with a shout out to Egon.

341
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:33,260
The long timers, no.

342
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:37,840
And I also appreciate that Remy still spells his name in a way where I can read it appropriately

343
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:40,740
because when he first started emailing in, he spelled his name the correct way, which

344
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:41,780
I would always butcher.

345
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:46,520
So now he writes in a way where my childlike brain can read it correctly.

346
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:51,380
So after just recently writing in about macro keyboard shortcuts, he says, I'm in the process

347
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:53,800
of trying to sell my own GPL software.

348
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:56,240
It's a small monitoring app written in Qt and C++.

349
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:00,720
If you want to check it out, it's at leafnode.nl.

350
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:03,840
But I am not really necessarily looking for free advertisements.

351
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:06,620
You don't have to mention it, but I already did, Remy.

352
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:07,760
You are going to get it no matter what.

353
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:08,760
Keep going.

354
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:09,760
He says, the price is low.

355
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:13,940
I'm not looking to make a profit because actually, I don't really want to get into a gray area

356
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:16,600
and I don't want to have to run a company.

357
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:21,040
And plus, I just kind of hate exposing my private data to any public company to register

358
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:25,260
and would that gray area be the Qt license, perhaps?

359
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:26,320
Perhaps un peu?

360
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,840
I think it's like a business legal thing in his country.

361
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:29,840
I don't know.

362
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:30,840
OK.

363
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:34,380
He says, I haven't gotten on a mobile app store yet, but the download includes an APK

364
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:35,380
for Android.

365
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:38,040
The app itself can export its source code.

366
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:42,140
I've built that in so that even when the binary is distributed, users can still get the source

367
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:43,140
code.

368
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:47,680
A hypothetical scenario here is when it's up on the Play Store and then I can't export

369
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:48,960
the source code to the user.

370
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:51,880
So he's concerned about this and GPL violations.

371
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:55,520
And I'm wondering, why not just link to it like an about page under a hamburger menu

372
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:56,520
or something?

373
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:57,520
That's like legit what I was going to say.

374
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:58,520
OK.

375
00:15:58,520 --> 00:15:59,520
But here's this real question.

376
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:01,360
So he's looking at the Linux deployment.

377
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:04,540
He's got a script right now that will build an app image.

378
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:07,400
It will compile Qt statically.

379
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:08,880
It's based around Ubuntu 18.04.

380
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:14,680
He says, it works on most modern Linux boxes that have app image support, which is like

381
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:15,680
everything.

382
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,360
But he's kind of curious.

383
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:20,080
What do we recommend for packaging this thing up?

384
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,800
He says, I see that snaps have a-

385
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:22,800
Oh, no, no, no.

386
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:23,800
I'm not touching Linux packaging.

387
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:24,800
Go.

388
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:25,800
Is that how you feel now?

389
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:26,800
Is that how you feel?

390
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:30,760
I have gotten into some nasty, nasty fights.

391
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:31,760
That's what Remi's concerned about.

392
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:33,720
He's worried about snap blowback, he says.

393
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:40,440
Do what you want, but the stakes are so low.

394
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:42,680
So you're saying the risk isn't worth the return.

395
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:43,680
It's not worth it.

396
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:44,680
Do it.

397
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:45,680
Do what you want.

398
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:53,080
My personal opinion is that I would take a.deb over a snap or a flat, especially a flat

399
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,080
pack.

400
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:57,960
Which, you know, everybody likes flat pack, and I've heard the recent Linux unplugged

401
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:58,960
and whatever.

402
00:16:58,960 --> 00:16:59,960
Here's the thing.

403
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:00,960
Here's the thing.

404
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:03,840
I think flat packs have gotten a lot more accepted.

405
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:07,320
It's really only in Ubuntu land where they're still tricky, but every other distro.

406
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:08,920
Well, so I run Ubuntu, right?

407
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:09,920
I run Pop.

408
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:10,920
Yeah, and it's huge.

409
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:11,920
It is huge.

410
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:12,920
Right, right.

411
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:13,920
So it-

412
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:14,920
Well, okay, Pop's got flat pack support.

413
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:15,920
Pop's got flat pack.

414
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:18,600
I mean, regular, straight up Ubuntu does not.

415
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:21,760
It does, but it's not very great.

416
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,080
I mean, you know-

417
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:24,080
Well, here's the thing.

418
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:25,080
Here's the thing.

419
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:32,240
Flathub is actively working on a way for developers to monetize, and it is a large repo of software,

420
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:34,240
and it's desktop focused, and-

421
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,240
I heard this before.

422
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:37,000
Canonical is working on the Ubuntu app store.

423
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:43,120
I bought, you remember, years ago, I bought an Ubuntu app to rebrand it, remonetize it,

424
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:48,360
and I made, the guy I bought it from made enough money to buy a cheeseburger, literally.

425
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:49,360
He made a video about it.

426
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,360
His name is Zane Swafford.

427
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:51,480
He's a great kid.

428
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:52,480
He worked for me.

429
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,120
It's different this time, man.

430
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:55,120
Oh, of course it is.

431
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,120
How come?

432
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:57,120
Oh, I didn't know.

433
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,120
Okay.

434
00:17:58,120 --> 00:17:59,120
Yeah.

435
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,120
This time will be different.

436
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:02,280
It is not tied to any particular distro.

437
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:04,480
There was no universal packaging format back then.

438
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,280
It was all tied to dab and app.

439
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:08,400
So why is flat better?

440
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,600
I don't use flat packs.

441
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:15,120
I use, so, and I know we're going to get, I use snap, but my preference is straight

442
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,120
dabs.

443
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:17,120
Right.

444
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:21,020
I will install a.deb deal and just do the deep package thing on the terminal.

445
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:23,400
That's the way I like to do it, but tell me why I'm wrong.

446
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:26,760
I think a dab is a pretty reasonable, and you're going to, you're going to get probably

447
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:29,320
80% of your, maybe 70% of your user base.

448
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:30,900
So I'm not trying to say don't go with the dab.

449
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:35,200
And I don't even think I'd argue that a flat pack is necessarily better than an app image

450
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,200
or a snap.

451
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:39,320
I think what I would argue is that just the network effect has gotten to the point now

452
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:41,480
where flat packs are starting to become a superior choice.

453
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:46,720
It's sort of like it's becoming the, it's becoming the DMG of the Linux desktop, even

454
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:49,280
though app image is pretty close to that.

455
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,280
It's simple.

456
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:53,720
It works with all software centers, you know, it's straightforward to get a flat pack installed

457
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:54,720
on Linux.

458
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,160
Now app image is also a great way to go.

459
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:59,160
I just probably wouldn't do snaps like everybody else.

460
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:05,880
I have a pony in this race and it's app image because they're the same thing.

461
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:09,440
Mac OS has been doing this for years and it's been fine.

462
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,440
Right?

463
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:11,440
Yes, it takes more storage, blah, blah, blah.

464
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:12,440
A lot of technical reasons.

465
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:15,340
Maybe you don't want to do it that way, but who cares?

466
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:17,260
People buy terabyte hard drives now.

467
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:21,680
And there is the app image hub, which kind of acts like a flat hub.

468
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:22,840
That to me is part of it.

469
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:23,840
I guess.

470
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:28,880
I think you got to have a front end to find new apps, recently updated apps.

471
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:29,880
You got to have a place.

472
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,480
I think that's what makes the app stores work.

473
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:35,720
I'm at the point where I'm starting to, again, they don't pay me.

474
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:39,360
I just like the stuff they put out.

475
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:43,600
Where I think system 76, thinking about pop OS is right.

476
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:49,640
That these Linux deck tops are for technical people, for developers, for engineers.

477
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:52,680
And at some point you're just going to have to pop open the terminal, right?

478
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:56,320
You're just going to have to do it out of the old way.

479
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,640
I mean, is Dash old?

480
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:05,180
I know this is heresy, but if I became the ruler of Linux, I think I would target the

481
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:06,880
user you just described.

482
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:11,740
And then what I would say is, from henceforth, all tutorials and how-tos will take place

483
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:13,440
on the command line.

484
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:16,160
Because it's a consistent UI across all Linux.

485
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:17,240
It's not just Linux.

486
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:23,480
You know, the Mac podcasts, love you all, please don't be mad.

487
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:26,520
But the real technical ones, guess where they live?

488
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:29,360
They live in ZShell, which is Mac Bash, right?

489
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:33,580
Well, ZShell exists everywhere, but Mac, the default is ZShell.

490
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:34,760
For some reason, yeah.

491
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:36,080
The reason's the GPL3.

492
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:37,080
Yeah.

493
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:38,700
But like, you know what?

494
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:39,800
It's Unix.

495
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:44,320
Like Mac and Linux, it's weird that there's that animosity between the communities, because

496
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:46,840
they really are, they're not just kissing cousins.

497
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:49,240
They're Cleopatra and her husband slash brother.

498
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:53,000
Yeah, especially when you have things like Brew or Nix, and you can get package management

499
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,600
going on the Mac.

500
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:59,680
And yeah, I think System76 is targeting the right user with Pop, and that it is that technical

501
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:01,160
user who just wants to get to work.

502
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:03,440
I think I'm going to buy a Thaleo tonight.

503
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:08,280
I think Remi just wants to give, he wants like maybe your best talk him out of trying

504
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:10,680
to ship and sell GPL software pitch.

505
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:11,680
Do you have one?

506
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:12,840
Because he's asking for your opinion on it.

507
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:14,720
I think we both know what that is.

508
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:18,160
Yeah, I am going to do the same thing very soon.

509
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:19,160
Okay.

510
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:20,960
I hope it's open core.

511
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:23,160
Remi, michael at the madvador.com.

512
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:25,160
Drop me a line.

513
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:27,360
We need to talk.

514
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:33,080
So Chris, you know, and the listeners know that I have been trying to revive the open

515
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:34,400
core business model.

516
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,520
I've noticed a few comments.

517
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:40,640
Can I just put my balls on the table like Eric Bachman or Erlich Bachman?

518
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:43,200
I'm going to open core Alice if I can.

519
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,200
Really?

520
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:46,280
I'm wondering how this is going to work.

521
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:47,960
So let's start there.

522
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:51,300
You're thinking you open source and you even said GPL there.

523
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:52,300
And then what?

524
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:53,940
Sell plugins, extra functionality?

525
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:57,680
So I said open core and GPL, which I guess is open source too.

526
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:58,680
So yeah.

527
00:21:58,680 --> 00:21:59,680
Free software though.

528
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:00,680
It's what it is.

529
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:01,680
It's free software.

530
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:03,560
I'm going to get back just for a second, right?

531
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:07,480
What Alice actually is because we talk about it like, you know, oh, great, great idea.

532
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:08,480
Yeah.

533
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:12,280
So Alice is automation and data translation software.

534
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:17,600
I have a term that I use for my customers called universal data fluency.

535
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:23,520
Basically the software looks at the shape of the data to translate it into other data

536
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:24,800
sources.

537
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:28,900
So we had a partnership at close, which is a CRM.

538
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:34,180
We could look at data from HubSpot, which is another CRM and translate it into close.

539
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:37,480
Right now we actually focus on contractors for Alice.

540
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:38,860
We do service Titan.

541
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:42,120
We're going to do house call pro next year.

542
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:45,240
The idea though is we do Google suite, right?

543
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,240
Google.

544
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,240
What the hell do they call it now?

545
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:50,840
Google for business used to be just G suite is not still called G suite.

546
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:51,840
No, it's not.

547
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:55,500
It's I mean, I usually, I usually call it like Google apps for business that they yelled

548
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:58,640
at me because I had the old name up and the old names or something.

549
00:22:58,640 --> 00:22:59,640
Is it Google teams?

550
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:01,640
It's like Google for, I don't know, whatever.

551
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:05,400
I think it's now called Google wishes it invented Slack for business.

552
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:06,400
Let me put it this way.

553
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,720
We also integrate with Slack.

554
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,000
Thank you, Chris.

555
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:13,560
And teams and office three 65 and whatever the Google version of that is, which is weird

556
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:17,440
because I've been a Google customer for over a decade and a half.

557
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:24,600
But hey, Google, my love, stop rebranding your, just stop renaming things and maybe

558
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:29,800
bring back a, the X and PP based chat and maybe while you're at it wave and we're never

559
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:32,840
going to get all your, your, your reader.

560
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:33,840
You want to talk about that?

561
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:34,840
Do we have to go here?

562
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:37,040
Yeah, actually I've moved on.

563
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,040
I've moved on reader.

564
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:40,840
I've made peace with actually it's all the other stuff.

565
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:44,840
I'm already pre upset about stadia so much for my Alice plug, but let's, let's, let's

566
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:45,840
have our feelings.

567
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:46,840
No, no, no, no.

568
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:47,980
We have to say the names.

569
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:49,780
We have to say the names.

570
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:52,520
Google has killed every product that was ever good that they made.

571
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:53,520
Sorry.

572
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:54,520
Google is better.

573
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:55,520
It was better than Twitter.

574
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:58,160
Google plus is still better than Twitter and Facebook combined.

575
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:04,680
I love the Google plus, but anyway, all right, so integrates with Slack, integrates with

576
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:07,600
all the different business areas and it helps you move data between those things.

577
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:12,800
It sounds like that's core functionality as far as you're concerned or is Slack like outside

578
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:13,800
core.

579
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:15,680
That's an interesting question.

580
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:18,720
So we are having a problem.

581
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,640
Should I just air my dirty laundry here?

582
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:21,640
Oh, probably.

583
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:24,760
I mean, it's good for the ads, right?

584
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:31,520
Our best customers are, how should we say, a little traditional in their it stack.

585
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:32,600
They don't have Slack.

586
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:34,640
They don't have teams, honestly.

587
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:40,160
They have Google, but they don't understand why Gmail keeps changing on them and they're

588
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:42,840
to say they're upset is a dramatic understatement.

589
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:46,560
They're basically their most modern communications tools.

590
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:47,560
Probably email.

591
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:52,160
You know, I'll just give you the numbers, our most popular integration, Microsoft access.

592
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:53,160
Of course.

593
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:55,720
Oh man, I bet I could have predicted that.

594
00:24:55,720 --> 00:25:03,400
We have fire stations, fire truck repair companies, military contractors, and a whole lot of like

595
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:06,560
actual contractors, like folks who are literally building buildings.

596
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:11,120
I mean, I don't know about the military, but all these other ones like manufacturing parts

597
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:17,520
or like where it's a shop, it's like a machine shop or construction, all these places, offices,

598
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:19,920
they're all places that get somebody who knows just enough.

599
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:24,480
They're dangerous just enough to build something like an access or an Excel.

600
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,480
That's classic.

601
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:27,160
Oh, oh, my mom.

602
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:31,280
So I'm not going to say where she works because she would literally cut my left that off.

603
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:34,160
But my mom is an Excel ninja.

604
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:35,640
She has done things.

605
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:37,880
I didn't tell you this, but I'll tell you on the air.

606
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:42,160
I bought a book called Python Workout, 50 lessons every week.

607
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:43,160
We're going to do one.

608
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:47,080
I'm going to put it on GitHub, public, you're going to love it.

609
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:51,120
She could do them in Excel and half the time I couldn't Python.

610
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:54,400
A pivot table to her is life.

611
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:57,480
Like she is so powerful.

612
00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:02,000
I actually asked her just like I just start throwing programming problems at her as a

613
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
go on.

614
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Just go on Excel.

615
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
Yeah.

616
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Do it in Excel.

617
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
There's a whole programming language.

618
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,600
The problem is Excel changed.

619
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:09,600
Yeah.

620
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,000
These things used to run businesses.

621
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,360
Oh, you would be horrified.

622
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:15,360
They still do.

623
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:16,360
Oh, OK.

624
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:19,240
Yeah, I mean, I've seen it in my time, so I can only imagine.

625
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:22,000
I've always wondered, like, how long could this possibly last?

626
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,280
And it sounds like forever.

627
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:24,280
Yeah.

628
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:25,560
Much longer than I thought it would.

629
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:30,600
So listeners, if any of you know what I'm talking about when I say Microsoft Access,

630
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:32,760
because I'm pretty sure that that's a relic, right?

631
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:35,560
I know they know they know they don't know.

632
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:36,560
They know access.

633
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:41,400
My God, I hope that would actually if people don't know millions in and tell me as you're

634
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:43,040
listening to this right now, send us a boost.

635
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:49,480
Did you know or did you not know about access and have you ever used it or seen it?

636
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:50,920
Tailscale.com slash coder.

637
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:54,400
Go there to get a free personal account for up to 20 devices.

638
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:55,520
And of course, you support the show.

639
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:59,080
So it's tailscale.com slash coder.

640
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:01,640
Tailscale is a zero config VPN.

641
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:03,820
It installs on any device in minutes.

642
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:05,360
It manages your firewall rules.

643
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:07,680
It helps you with double dreaded NAT.

644
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:14,480
I recently learned that one of the co-founders of Tailscale has parents that retired into

645
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:15,700
an RV.

646
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:20,560
And so he went out to their RV and made sure that Tailscale worked through carrier grade

647
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:21,560
NAT.

648
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:23,360
Man, am I grateful for that.

649
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:26,120
That is the scenario I use it all the time.

650
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:31,520
Tailscale creates a decentralized flat network for your systems protected by WireGuard's

651
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:32,520
mesh protocol.

652
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:37,760
And then Tailscale runs this backplane that you can authenticate to using a single sign-on

653
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:38,760
system.

654
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:43,480
So if you work with a like a business single sign-on system and it uses two factor authentication,

655
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:44,480
Tailscale supports that.

656
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:48,400
Of course, it has support for DNS, so you can set up a DNS server in there and actually

657
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,300
address everything by name.

658
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:52,540
And Tailscale VPNs are always on.

659
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:53,540
They're smart.

660
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:57,120
So they send the traffic that's supposed to talk to those machines through the VPN, and

661
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:00,300
not all your traffic, which means you can leave it on all the time.

662
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:02,000
So every device remains connected.

663
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:09,240
I'm talking, I have Raspberry Pis, I have an iPad, I have lots of desktops, I have containers,

664
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:13,920
and I have VPSs, and I have VMs all on this Tailscale network.

665
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:17,960
It's allowed me to build my own internet, and you can set it up and try it for yourself

666
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:22,520
for free for up to 20 machines by going to tailscale.com slash coder.

667
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:25,000
And keep an eye out for a future Linux Unplugged.

668
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:30,080
I have an interview with one of the founders of Tailscale, and it's really insightful.

669
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:33,600
And he talks about how they've built it to be sustainable, even for the free accounts.

670
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:35,800
But it's just a great service.

671
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:39,360
It's changed the way I work, and it's going to change the way you work, maybe you support

672
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:41,720
your friends, your family, or connect your devices.

673
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:44,080
Go build your own internet and support the show.

674
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:48,080
Get started at tailscale.com slash coder.

675
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:57,880
Yeah, so I'm, okay, so my idea for the open-coring of Alice, and I'm going to say core, and please,

676
00:28:57,880 --> 00:29:01,000
please stop sending me fascist emails.

677
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:04,860
Not emails from fascists, literally saying that I'm a fascist because I like open-coring.

678
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:07,880
It's really mean, like it's unnecessary.

679
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:14,760
So the way I architected Alice is a little psychotic, for lack of a better word.

680
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:17,360
There's a core automation engine, right?

681
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:24,800
It runs the services, it does timers, it does webhooks, it does several versions of dedupe,

682
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:25,800
deduplication.

683
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:27,640
Oh, sure, yeah, I bet.

684
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:34,440
The obvious ones you'd think of, I have my own little method that seems faster, but I'll

685
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:38,320
be honest with you, performance has become an issue, and I'm playing with the underlying

686
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:39,880
Python runtime.

687
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:45,160
I actually am considering porting her to the.NET.

688
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:52,600
I don't know if you know this, but so.NET has a Python runtime that seems pretty performant.

689
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:57,440
There's challenges there because they're, I mean, this is a whole conversation, but

690
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:00,040
I'll give you the one I told my six-year-old.

691
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:02,660
It's a McDonald's parfait, right?

692
00:30:02,660 --> 00:30:06,920
There's a layer of yogurt, there's fruit, there's granola.

693
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:09,060
Yeah, you gotta have that.

694
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:11,440
Maybe like a little breading or something, I mean, I don't know.

695
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:16,300
The idea is that the layers may, I think, now right now they're a little tightly coupled

696
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:21,320
and I need to do some work on that, but I think maybe by this time next year, I can

697
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:28,320
uncouple the core, the yogurt part, and make that an open core automation engine.

698
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:29,660
Hmm, yeah.

699
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:30,720
And why wouldn't I do that?

700
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:36,880
I really think the pushback you've gotten on open core is probably just a vocal minority

701
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:41,400
because I think, I mean, I think you could even, you don't even really have to use the

702
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:42,400
language.

703
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:45,760
You know, you could really just talk about how this is the project, it's open source,

704
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:50,260
it's free software, these additional commercial modules are available, and you almost could

705
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:54,100
even not even say the words open core, but people would get it.

706
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:59,940
So the way I bill for Alice is there's that 5,000, like that's the minimum, right?

707
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:04,560
And then the more integrations, and if you want us to host it, obviously that costs something,

708
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:05,560
right?

709
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:07,100
For hosting in PlanCity.

710
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:09,500
But I bill for the additional integrations.

711
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:15,840
So I'm not suggesting I'm going to make the integration layer or the, you know, data translation

712
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:18,360
layer open source.

713
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:20,560
That could be something that's also custom per customer.

714
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:21,560
I could see that.

715
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:22,560
Yeah.

716
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:23,560
Well, we do a lot of custom work, right?

717
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:30,400
So see, I have memories, and frankly, I know you do, right, of the old days where you had

718
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:36,600
companies that were living the open source lifestyle, a free software package, right?

719
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:37,600
Open source.

720
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:44,800
But to be super clear, when I say the yogurt part is going to be open source, I mean, GPL,

721
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:47,080
like straight up GPL.

722
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:48,720
I want to charge for the integrations.

723
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:52,280
I want to charge for some of the data translation stuff.

724
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:55,160
So I have talked to three attorneys.

725
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:57,160
How's that going?

726
00:31:57,160 --> 00:32:03,680
Mike, take a shower, have a glass of water and a cup of coffee and go to bed.

727
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:07,360
What are you out of your mind?

728
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:13,160
And the last one was, so killing yourself, like, why don't you just kill yourself?

729
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:14,160
Sorry, kids.

730
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:18,680
I have a divorce lawyer, I have a business lawyer, I actually have two business lawyers

731
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:24,560
because one of my business lawyers literally quit being a lawyer to go raise cattle, which

732
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:26,440
tells you how fun being a lawyer is.

733
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:29,040
Man, that's probably the way to go, let's be honest.

734
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:31,400
But even her, she was like, you're insane.

735
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:36,440
You know, what is the difference between open core and free software in terms of a corporation,

736
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:38,960
in terms of a business?

737
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:42,040
It seems like you actually have a business behind an open core model.

738
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:45,120
There's an actual business where the free software project, sometimes there's no business,

739
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:47,120
there's just a guy.

740
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:51,400
KP says in the chat, open core is great, just tell an AWS, find out your product, or they'll

741
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:53,760
just write their own plugins from placers.

742
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,040
There's that, there's that, yeah.

743
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:56,520
So it's possible, right?

744
00:32:56,520 --> 00:33:01,000
Like, Chris knows, and I think you all know that I've been thinking about this for a year

745
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,000
and a half now.

746
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:05,040
I'll be honest with you, the reason I haven't done it is I'm frankly scared.

747
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:08,960
Yeah, I think that's probably your biggest risk there is somebody creates commercial

748
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:11,840
plugins that replace what you do.

749
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:15,280
And that almost would be a great problem to have too at the same time, because the scale

750
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:19,320
you would have to reach to show up on their radar and then to have customers that want

751
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:23,400
it for them to implement that would mean that you're, you know, you're probably at hundreds

752
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:24,600
of employees at that point.

753
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:26,520
Could I make a evil announcement?

754
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:27,680
Oh yeah, let's do it.

755
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:29,600
Not to turn this into an ad for Alice.

756
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:35,720
We're also, oh, giving dates is painful because I've been wrong every time.

757
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:42,600
By next year, we're going to have a self-service GUI reporting tool where folks who pay for

758
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:49,160
the GUI reporting tool can use the internal, the yogurt, right?

759
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:52,320
Part of Alice to create their own reports.

760
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:53,320
Working on that now?

761
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:54,320
Oh yeah.

762
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:56,280
It's a, it's a web interface.

763
00:33:56,280 --> 00:34:05,340
I want an iPad interface, but I, do you remember that episode where, what's his name?

764
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:06,340
Number one.

765
00:34:06,340 --> 00:34:07,340
Oh, Riker.

766
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:10,320
Riker mutinied against the card.

767
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:11,320
No.

768
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:13,760
My employees will not allow me to open Xcode again.

769
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:16,200
Are you telling me there's a Riker mutiny episode?

770
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:18,540
Am I blanking on this?

771
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:19,540
You are.

772
00:34:19,540 --> 00:34:20,540
I can think of it.

773
00:34:20,540 --> 00:34:22,760
I can think of a Jakota mutiny episode on the holodeck.

774
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:25,480
It's the one where he and Q merge.

775
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:27,960
Q offers him to be kind of a mutiny.

776
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:28,960
You're right.

777
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:33,320
And he turns Wesley into like this huge stud and Wes is like, Oh, what's up mom?

778
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:37,120
Which is weird too, troubling in so many ways.

779
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:38,120
Yeah.

780
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:40,840
Oh, by the way, can we respond to the Star Trek feedback or no?

781
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:41,840
Oh yeah, sure.

782
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:42,840
Sure.

783
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:43,840
Boost a gram.

784
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:44,840
Boost.

785
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:45,840
All right.

786
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:47,400
So we did get some Star Trek feedback.

787
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:52,280
In fact, we got a rage boost from a middle-aged dev sent in 500 sats.

788
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:56,360
I love discovery season four, however, I missed out on most of enterprise and I will check

789
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:57,360
it out.

790
00:34:57,360 --> 00:35:01,560
I do remember those and Dorian antennas wiggling though, which was great.

791
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:05,200
We had a few people in telegram respond to that.

792
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:09,920
We were just not appreciating the emotional journey that discovery takes you on when we

793
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:11,680
were talking about discovery.

794
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:15,640
I think spoiler free, but did you catch strange new worlds, which has launched?

795
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:20,080
Don't, don't spoil it because it's just new, but parents of Coder radio, this is the time

796
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:22,640
to maybe make your kids go away.

797
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:24,640
You have two seconds.

798
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:26,080
Get out of here.

799
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:29,080
One two.

800
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:34,420
I'm a big fan of the uniforms in discovery in a strange new worlds.

801
00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:35,560
Big fan.

802
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:36,560
Big fan.

803
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:37,560
All right.

804
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:38,560
I mean, that's positive.

805
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:39,560
I thought you were going to drop a bomb.

806
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:40,560
Nope.

807
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:45,080
It's a, it's, it's a specific uniform that I like, but yeah.

808
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:47,480
Oh, is it in the sick pay?

809
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:51,920
I refuse to answer any questions that might cancel me.

810
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:52,920
All right.

811
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:53,920
I got you.

812
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:54,920
But yeah, I, all right.

813
00:35:54,920 --> 00:36:00,800
I think my, my take on the strange new worlds is that it is probably the best first episode

814
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,040
of any of the new Trek.

815
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:03,400
No, it's kidding aside.

816
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:04,400
It's really good.

817
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:05,400
Right?

818
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:11,620
Like I, I, I wasn't going to watch it until we got our nasty emails and I did because

819
00:36:11,620 --> 00:36:15,920
I'm a coward and I loved it a little too much though.

820
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:16,920
Yeah.

821
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:17,920
So, okay.

822
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:20,320
Just between you and I, Chris, no one else can hear this, right?

823
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:21,760
No, it's just private now.

824
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:25,200
So, so Mariah bought a dress for the wedding, right?

825
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:26,200
Oh yeah.

826
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:27,200
Right.

827
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:32,920
I lit it on fire and I bought her a yellow star trip.

828
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:33,920
She's going to love that.

829
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:35,240
She's just going to love that.

830
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:39,400
I just want to say she, she is not super thrilled.

831
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:41,800
I can't imagine.

832
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:42,800
All right.

833
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:47,600
Next boost comes in boost from DPG says, I want to recommend the new Lego star Wars games

834
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:48,600
in the Skywalker Sega.

835
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:53,360
It's been a blast playing with my younger cousin, plenty of nostalgia, may the force

836
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:54,760
be with you.

837
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:57,440
He's also says there's a bunch of Jar Jar stuff in there.

838
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:58,960
In fact, I'll jump right to it.

839
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:04,440
Crashmaster 18 wrote in with a thousand sats, Mesa happy to hear Jar Jar.

840
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:09,440
And for what it's worth, I like all the star Wars movies and I like Picard too, but I can't

841
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:10,560
get into discovery.

842
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:11,560
Tried repeatedly.

843
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:14,560
I can't believe people are encouraging this Jar Jar thing.

844
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:17,880
They're actually using their sats to encourage more Jar Jar Binks.

845
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:20,320
I don't think these people appreciate what they're doing to the show.

846
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:27,400
You know, they're not thinking this through Mesa stand with captain Vorka, bringing the

847
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:28,400
world together.

848
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:32,200
I just want to say this one more time and I really hope we stopped being a social commentary

849
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:37,840
podcast, but a captain Lorker was the most interesting captain of Star Trek ever period.

850
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:39,860
Second only maybe to Cisco.

851
00:37:39,860 --> 00:37:44,000
And I have this weird thing where me Cisco and Lorca are, nevermind better than Sean

852
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,000
Luke.

853
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,000
Yeah.

854
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,000
Sean Luke, you know, he's too perfect.

855
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,280
Well, they take him down a few pegs in Picard.

856
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:52,040
So if that's your thing, you'll enjoy Picard.

857
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:56,600
I have watched Picard and watching an old man suffer from dementia is not great.

858
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:57,600
Oh geez.

859
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:58,600
Oh geez.

860
00:37:58,600 --> 00:37:59,600
I'm actually impressed.

861
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:01,240
He reacted the hell out of that final episode.

862
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:03,080
You know who the hero of Picard is?

863
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:04,080
Seven of nine.

864
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:05,080
Who?

865
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:06,080
Lorca?

866
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:07,480
I'm filled with rage right now.

867
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:08,480
Are you insane?

868
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:09,480
Who?

869
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:10,480
Dodge.

870
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:15,680
But the OG Dodge first episode, they jump her, they put a hood on her and that girl

871
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:17,480
steps right up to the plate.

872
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:18,720
You're right.

873
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:24,040
And when they try to kill captain Picard or Admiral Picard, if you were, listen, fighting

874
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:28,760
someone on a college campus or whatever the hell Starfleet thinks it is.

875
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:31,560
I have gotten to physical altercations on the college campus.

876
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:32,560
Let me tell you something.

877
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:33,560
I can't believe it.

878
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:34,560
Of course you have.

879
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:35,560
Yes.

880
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:38,280
We both hurt each other by missing each other and hitting walls.

881
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:39,280
Oh my God.

882
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:43,120
I, you two, you two hot heads fighting each other and then punch on the wall is God.

883
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:44,320
I wish I could have seen that.

884
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:45,320
I'm bleeding.

885
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:46,320
Are you okay?

886
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:47,320
Like it's,

887
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:48,320
fights over.

888
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:50,800
Oh my God.

889
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:51,800
And attacked us.

890
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:53,560
The, the, the, the, the building jumped.

891
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:54,560
Yes.

892
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:56,040
So I wish I could have seen that.

893
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:58,480
Nev kicked off a challenge last week.

894
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:00,400
He's now coming through with 5,000 sats.

895
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:03,640
Jim, I hereby challenge you to install gen two for a week.

896
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:07,120
If you manage this challenge successfully, I will give you 5,000 sets.

897
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:09,380
At the end of the week, you can submit a Neo fetch.

898
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:14,200
That's a program you can install on the command line and give me a screenshot of it and submit

899
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:16,320
a pull request to his get lab.

900
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:19,080
He's got it linked in the show notes, so we'll put a link to that.

901
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:20,620
And then you get the 5,000 sats.

902
00:39:20,620 --> 00:39:24,920
If you complete the gen two challenge, I think they might've already connected in the matrix

903
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:26,320
too, which is awesome.

904
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:29,200
I'm not positive, but I think it might've been happening.

905
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,200
Oh my God.

906
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:31,200
It's not me.

907
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:32,200
Okay.

908
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:34,560
I don't have to insult you into new, no, some guy named Jim does.

909
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:36,800
Sorry Jim, but maybe you'll enjoy your set.

910
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:38,640
Jim, you did this to yourself.

911
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:44,060
Also puppy Linux for life saved my ass more times than y'all could ever.

912
00:39:44,060 --> 00:39:45,060
Puppy Linux.

913
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:49,040
Also system rescue CD also really good for saving your bacon.

914
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:50,040
System rescue CD.

915
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:51,040
Shout out.

916
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:52,520
I like how I have the crappy old version.

917
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:53,520
Yes.

918
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:58,320
The good version.

919
00:39:58,320 --> 00:39:59,600
Linode.com slash coder.

920
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:04,600
Go there to get $100 in 60 day credit on a new account and you go there to support the

921
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:05,600
show.

922
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:07,720
Linode is fast, reliable cloud hosting.

923
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:11,240
You got to go try it for yourself or your next project to go learn something.

924
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:14,360
Maybe they have a one click deployment of something you've been wanting to try for a

925
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:15,360
while.

926
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:18,960
That's the first place I check when I learn about a new open source project.

927
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:22,360
Sometimes I just browse their marketplace just to learn about new projects.

928
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:27,680
And because I actually do that, I noticed that they update it pretty frequently as well.

929
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:28,960
There's a lot of nice things in there.

930
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:35,800
And I always mentioned things like Jitsi GitLab or Nextcloud or lots of popular gaming servers.

931
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:40,360
I run a couple for my kids up there, but of course you can also use it to deploy your

932
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:43,600
entire infrastructure for your business in the cloud.

933
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:51,680
And it's not like this super intense, hyperscaler, esoteric platform where all of the jargon

934
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:56,400
and the skills only apply to that platform, which essentially is creating a new form of

935
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:58,120
cloud lock-in.

936
00:40:58,120 --> 00:40:59,920
That's not the game Linode plays.

937
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:03,760
What they play is the value, the performance and the service.

938
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:07,520
There's not a lot of people competing in this space and nobody does it like Linode because

939
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:10,040
they've been around for 19 years doing this kind of stuff.

940
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:12,880
They've recently been rolling out MVME PCIe storage.

941
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:16,240
So if you have applications that need super high performance, like I'm talking serious

942
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:18,840
IOPS, they've got disks for that now.

943
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:24,760
They've got AMD EPYC CPUs that consistently benchmark higher and faster than the competitors.

944
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:31,160
11 data centers around the world where they are their own ISP, so they control their connectivity.

945
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:32,160
It's great.

946
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:37,720
40 gigabit connections coming into the hypervisors, they got SSDs, MVMEs, they got the RAMs, they

947
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:38,720
got the CPUs.

948
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:42,520
I mean, it goes on and on, but what really matters and what I hear a lot is the support.

949
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:45,640
I mean, I could just, I could rattle on about all the features.

950
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:48,840
I use the crap out of the object storage.

951
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:51,520
That's why I say just go take advantage of that $100.

952
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:57,080
That's like real working money, especially when you see these prices, they're 30 to 50%

953
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:58,080
lower than the hyperscalers.

954
00:41:58,080 --> 00:42:03,360
So like that $100, you can really try this thing and actually see what I'm talking about.

955
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:07,680
And it's also just great for anybody who might want to deploy a portfolio or a website.

956
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:08,880
It scales.

957
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:09,880
It's great for individuals.

958
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:10,880
It's great for businesses.

959
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:13,120
It really hits that sweet spot.

960
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:16,840
You can take it even further with things like their API, their documentation.

961
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:23,720
Go try it out and support the show, linode.com slash coder.

962
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:25,720
Can we have a pop topic?

963
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:26,720
Sure.

964
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:35,000
So I'd like to, with respect, ask you, what terminal are you using right now?

965
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:38,960
The machine I'm sitting at is plasma and I love console on the Mac.

966
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:44,880
I'll use iterm for most my like day long work and then like quick stuff, I'll just use the

967
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:45,880
terminal.

968
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:46,880
It's so kind of depends.

969
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:49,480
And then I actually just use the GNOME terminal on GNOME.

970
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:53,080
So I have been taking a journey into the land of terminals, eh?

971
00:42:53,080 --> 00:42:58,640
There are so many new terminals now and I have to say, I'm not going to say negative

972
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:04,800
about the ones I don't like, but warp, we've talked about them before, made the right choice

973
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:06,560
by not going electron.

974
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:07,560
Yeah.

975
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:09,960
That's just not where you want an electron app, is it?

976
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:12,720
So folks that don't know, I use an app called magnet app.

977
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:16,480
It adds like snap tiling and also keyboard commands, stuff that should be built into

978
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:19,000
the window manager of Mac OS, that kind of stuff.

979
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:23,980
Stuff that literally exists on pop OS for free, but I paid $20 because I hate my life.

980
00:43:23,980 --> 00:43:31,480
I will say, and I say this with love, the font rendering for some reason, we've talked

981
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:41,600
about this before, on Mac terminal, terminal.app, the fonts look crisper and bigger than on

982
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:42,600
warp.

983
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:45,200
And this is the one that kills me.

984
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:51,280
So I opened the same file, same Python script, in vim, on pop OS.

985
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:54,240
Now, this is not the newest release, so I apologize.

986
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:57,840
I'm not insane, so I didn't update it.

987
00:43:57,840 --> 00:44:02,760
And in VS code, the font is like a quarter of the size in VS code.

988
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:04,200
It's like half size.

989
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:08,440
I have just decided in the last year, I'm just popping up the font size on all that

990
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:09,820
stuff now.

991
00:44:09,820 --> 00:44:12,120
Have you messed with VS code setting sync at all?

992
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:20,000
No, I'm afraid to do the sync because my settings on Mac and pop are different, but how does

993
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,000
it work?

994
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:26,200
I'm not a heavy config tweaker of VS code because I'm installing it and removing it

995
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:28,720
so frequently that I don't want to get tuned to the weeds.

996
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:34,160
But I decided to authenticate it with my GitHub account, and then I sync across my font and

997
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:35,720
font size.

998
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:37,760
And I pop it up to like 18.

999
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:39,200
Now I have pretty big monitors too.

1000
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:41,440
No, I'm right there with you, 18, I'm at 16.

1001
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:50,120
I mean, but on the Linux terminal, right on the GNOME terminal, because I'm running pop,

1002
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:52,980
it's size 13 and they look the same.

1003
00:44:52,980 --> 00:44:55,400
That seems like a problem in Electron.

1004
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:56,400
Is this on a 4K screen?

1005
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:59,200
I'm wondering if it's like a difference in scaling.

1006
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:05,360
I can tell you exactly what screen it's an old Dell UltraSharp, I don't remember the

1007
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:11,040
model, but UltraSharp 27 inch, 250, 60 by 1440.

1008
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:12,040
That's what it is.

1009
00:45:12,040 --> 00:45:16,800
Man, that is, it's such a tricky resolution for Linux to get right in some use cases.

1010
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:19,120
250, that's a normal resolution.

1011
00:45:19,120 --> 00:45:26,920
I know, it's because it's right on the edge of requiring high DPI, but not quite.

1012
00:45:26,920 --> 00:45:31,160
I think you'll find it's a little bit better in the new pop because it has GTK4.

1013
00:45:31,160 --> 00:45:36,400
Wow, but there's other dependent, I mean, I'm not keen to upgrade right now.

1014
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:42,920
So why that specific, and I hope this is valuable to people, but hell, you're helping me now.

1015
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:43,920
Why?

1016
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:44,920
Why?

1017
00:45:44,920 --> 00:45:45,920
It's not 4K.

1018
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:51,920
Right, I think it gets down to how things get rendered on that particular toolkit.

1019
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:54,400
So if you're, say you're on GTK with X11.

1020
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:57,320
Oh, no, no, no, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm GDome, right?

1021
00:45:57,320 --> 00:46:04,080
I'll get the exact versions, 2004, the last LTS, not the new one, right?

1022
00:46:04,080 --> 00:46:09,840
On the laptop itself, it's a system 76, I think it's a lemur, right?

1023
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:13,340
It's a black one, it's a little black one.

1024
00:46:13,340 --> 00:46:15,600
It's beautiful on its own screen.

1025
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:19,840
The minute I plug in that HDMI cable, everything is fine.

1026
00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:20,840
Everything's lovely.

1027
00:46:20,840 --> 00:46:24,020
Until I open it, like it's Slack, it looks like **** too.

1028
00:46:24,020 --> 00:46:25,680
That's what it is.

1029
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:31,440
Newer versions of Electron on Linux do support resolution scaling, but I don't know if that's

1030
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:34,280
actually shipped in things like Slack yet.

1031
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:36,720
Electron uses an older toolkit.

1032
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:41,440
I think it's GTK, but I think it's like an older GTK.

1033
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:46,800
What's strange is when I go to Plant City and I plug it into the 19, whatever, the 1920

1034
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:49,680
by 1080, it looks fine.

1035
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:50,680
So you're right.

1036
00:46:50,680 --> 00:46:51,680
You must be right.

1037
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:52,680
It's got to be the scaling.

1038
00:46:52,680 --> 00:46:53,680
Yeah.

1039
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:55,820
A couple of more boosts before we get out of here.

1040
00:46:55,820 --> 00:46:59,640
Eric Jr. sent in 5000 SATs for absolutely no reason.

1041
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:04,220
From Funny Money, AKA Tom, he sent in 10,000 SATs just to say keep up the great work and

1042
00:47:04,220 --> 00:47:06,140
files copying sent in 10,000 SATs.

1043
00:47:06,140 --> 00:47:09,420
We really got some really great support last week.

1044
00:47:09,420 --> 00:47:13,360
And we also got people asking if they know of any open source projects that are on the

1045
00:47:13,360 --> 00:47:15,360
Lightning Network.

1046
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:17,000
I'm trying to collect a list.

1047
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,600
Here's my thinking.

1048
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:25,200
In the podcasting 2.0 spec, which includes things like transcripts, chapters, embedded

1049
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:30,500
images, it includes things like alternative download types, and it includes these boosts.

1050
00:47:30,500 --> 00:47:34,240
So in that spec, it's an RSS namespace spec.

1051
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:36,680
It's an open source namespace spec.

1052
00:47:36,680 --> 00:47:41,400
And you can put things in there like a value tag with a Lightning address.

1053
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:47,060
And that tells podcasting 2.0 compatible clients, like I have the support for this feature.

1054
00:47:47,060 --> 00:47:53,620
So like transcripts, you can have a transcript namespace in the RSS XML that points to where

1055
00:47:53,620 --> 00:47:55,300
the transcript lives at.

1056
00:47:55,300 --> 00:47:59,660
And then the app, when it loads the podcast, it can load the transcript because it sees

1057
00:47:59,660 --> 00:48:04,020
that namespace in the XML for the transcript URL.

1058
00:48:04,020 --> 00:48:07,440
And it goes and grabs that text, same with chapters, images.

1059
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:10,360
So one of the things we could actually start doing if there was enough people with podcasting

1060
00:48:10,360 --> 00:48:14,960
2.0 apps is we could actually have an image of what we're talking about show up on the

1061
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:17,040
screen now if we wanted to.

1062
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:20,760
I'm really excited about the possibility of transcripts because then it makes the shows

1063
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:25,340
infinitely more searchable, which is super useful from like just looking back in the

1064
00:48:25,340 --> 00:48:29,640
archive, finding when we talked about stuff and getting some Google juice because they've

1065
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:33,980
never really gotten around to making audio super searchable.

1066
00:48:33,980 --> 00:48:37,880
So it's a whole set of features and I'm just kind of scratching the surface.

1067
00:48:37,880 --> 00:48:42,520
Like here's another example, like if you've ever seen, like in the old days we'd have

1068
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:47,000
on a download app for an episode, we'd have the MP3 link, we'd have an MP4 link, we'd

1069
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:51,080
have like a mobile link, we'd have all these different versions of the file.

1070
00:48:51,080 --> 00:48:55,400
Well in podcasting 2.0, they're cleaning that up and they're making it so that way you could

1071
00:48:55,400 --> 00:49:00,000
just have one entry that has multiple file type options.

1072
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:04,600
Another example, and this is the last one I'll use, is they're making it possible for

1073
00:49:04,600 --> 00:49:10,200
music publishers to basically say in their RSS feed, this is actually an album.

1074
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:15,440
And so it can tell the podcast UI, again if it's podcasting 2.0 compatible, it can tell

1075
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:21,680
the podcasting UI, render this as a music album, not a weekly podcast series.

1076
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:24,880
And so then it'll say things like, you know, artist and album.

1077
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:25,880
Oh cool.

1078
00:49:25,880 --> 00:49:31,120
Yeah, it's really stuff that we've needed for a long time to compete with Spotify and

1079
00:49:31,120 --> 00:49:35,080
YouTube and Facebook and everybody who wants Apple that wants to get on this.

1080
00:49:35,080 --> 00:49:38,800
And the best part is, is that it's an open source community spec, there's lots of people

1081
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:43,120
contributing to it, there's multiple apps being created at newpodcastapps.com.

1082
00:49:43,120 --> 00:49:46,160
It's really got a lot of good momentum and one of the namespace things in there is this

1083
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:47,780
value block.

1084
00:49:47,780 --> 00:49:50,780
Right now it's Lightning which uses Bitcoin.

1085
00:49:50,780 --> 00:49:54,080
That's just an implementation detail and I think Lightning is a good one because with

1086
00:49:54,080 --> 00:49:59,640
Lightning you can send stupid cheap amounts of money, like seven cents, right?

1087
00:49:59,640 --> 00:50:02,300
You can't do that with the existing payment rails.

1088
00:50:02,300 --> 00:50:08,340
We have people that listen to this show that stream us some sats every minute as they listen.

1089
00:50:08,340 --> 00:50:09,680
Just a handful of sats.

1090
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:13,720
And you know, it's probably, in some cases it could be less than a penny.

1091
00:50:13,720 --> 00:50:14,720
But it adds up.

1092
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:17,400
And you can't do that with PayPal or Stripe.

1093
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:20,000
The fees are like a couple of bucks, right?

1094
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:21,160
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1095
00:50:21,160 --> 00:50:25,000
And so Lightning is the part of the backend that makes this possible.

1096
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:30,400
In this value namespace tag, in the RSS feed, you can do splits.

1097
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:33,960
So one of the things I'm thinking about is I want to do splits with certain open source

1098
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:35,920
projects that we use to produce these shows.

1099
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:39,840
So when people boost these shows, a split of it goes to an open source project.

1100
00:50:39,840 --> 00:50:43,620
But these open source projects need to get on the Lightning network first and so if people

1101
00:50:43,620 --> 00:50:48,120
know of open source projects that are accepting Lightning payments, let me know because that's

1102
00:50:48,120 --> 00:50:49,120
something I could see doing.

1103
00:50:49,120 --> 00:50:53,160
I could also see down the road splits with a host or somebody who helps us produce the

1104
00:50:53,160 --> 00:50:55,120
show or all kinds of things.

1105
00:50:55,120 --> 00:50:56,760
Shout out to Drew.

1106
00:50:56,760 --> 00:50:58,720
Let's split some Lightning money with Drew, right?

1107
00:50:58,720 --> 00:50:59,720
Let's do it.

1108
00:50:59,720 --> 00:51:00,720
Come on.

1109
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:02,920
Listen, Drew has saved Chris's life a hundred times.

1110
00:51:02,920 --> 00:51:03,920
Chris is crazy.

1111
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:04,920
Oh man.

1112
00:51:04,920 --> 00:51:05,920
You've heard him live.

1113
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:06,920
He's nuts.

1114
00:51:06,920 --> 00:51:07,920
Just nuts.

1115
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:08,920
It's definitely Chris and not me.

1116
00:51:08,920 --> 00:51:09,920
Absolutely.

1117
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:14,640
I think the biggest resistance right now is crypto looks really scary, especially with

1118
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:20,560
the market tanking and people don't know the difference between Bitcoin and all of the

1119
00:51:20,560 --> 00:51:22,160
other crypto currencies.

1120
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:24,680
It's sort of like there's a lot of operating systems and people don't know.

1121
00:51:24,680 --> 00:51:25,680
You mean Miccoin?

1122
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:26,680
Yeah, right.

1123
00:51:26,680 --> 00:51:27,680
Miccoin and scam coins, right?

1124
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:28,680
There's a lot of...

1125
00:51:28,680 --> 00:51:31,400
There's Windows, there's Mac OS, there's Linux, there's the right tools for the right job.

1126
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:33,160
Different ones have different fundamentals.

1127
00:51:33,160 --> 00:51:35,880
It's the same thing with crypto technology and blockchains.

1128
00:51:35,880 --> 00:51:37,340
A lot of them are scams.

1129
00:51:37,340 --> 00:51:40,760
Some of them are a good idea but just don't have the solid fundamentals.

1130
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:42,200
And then there's Bitcoin.

1131
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:45,900
And so that's why I like the Lightning Network because it's based on some solid fundamentals.

1132
00:51:45,900 --> 00:51:47,960
But it could be anything.

1133
00:51:47,960 --> 00:51:52,420
If you could get the payments right, it could be a stripe backend for that value namespace.

1134
00:51:52,420 --> 00:51:56,680
And so the podcasting 2.0 stuff is really about all of these new things that need to

1135
00:51:56,680 --> 00:52:02,340
come to podcasting and then about working with podcast app developers to actually incorporate

1136
00:52:02,340 --> 00:52:03,340
those things.

1137
00:52:03,340 --> 00:52:05,640
And it's not a lot right now.

1138
00:52:05,640 --> 00:52:08,800
Frountain and Castamatic are the ones I use.

1139
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:14,360
Some apps like Overcast and AntennaPod have implemented bits and parts of the podcasting

1140
00:52:14,360 --> 00:52:15,360
2.0 spec.

1141
00:52:15,360 --> 00:52:16,360
And some of the...

1142
00:52:16,360 --> 00:52:21,320
There's some really nice web podcasting players which have almost all of the features.

1143
00:52:21,320 --> 00:52:26,140
And it's gonna require us on the backend to develop new tooling to produce the RSS feeds

1144
00:52:26,140 --> 00:52:27,840
with all of these features.

1145
00:52:27,840 --> 00:52:29,320
But I'm all about it.

1146
00:52:29,320 --> 00:52:32,440
I think transcripts are one of the things I'm the most excited about along with the

1147
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:33,540
value tag.

1148
00:52:33,540 --> 00:52:36,380
I could quickly see some shows doing...

1149
00:52:36,380 --> 00:52:41,420
Like LAN could be a great example of we have six stories in an episode of LAN and we could

1150
00:52:41,420 --> 00:52:45,340
have the headline image up as we're talking about that story each chapter because each

1151
00:52:45,340 --> 00:52:46,920
story has a chapter.

1152
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:51,200
A standardized way to do chapters is another nice thing that's also searchable on the web.

1153
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:53,520
That's part of the podcasting 2.0 spec.

1154
00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:57,640
And then on top of all of that, it also has a good crediting system to make it really

1155
00:52:57,640 --> 00:53:02,280
clear who's a host, who's a guest speaker, who's a community contributor and all of this

1156
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:04,920
information that the listener might want to know.

1157
00:53:04,920 --> 00:53:08,980
So it's all out there at newpodcastapps.com if you want to get it on the client side.

1158
00:53:08,980 --> 00:53:13,440
I'm also kind of covering the development of all of this in office hours as we begin

1159
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:16,160
to build the tooling on the backend this summer.

1160
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:20,040
We have a really good conversation going on on the GitHub for Jupyter Broadcasting about

1161
00:53:20,040 --> 00:53:21,040
some of that stuff.

1162
00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:23,960
And then the development of that's gonna be covered in office hours.

1163
00:53:23,960 --> 00:53:25,400
Office hours, not here.

1164
00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:28,920
For all of that, because it's gonna be a summer of projects.

1165
00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:31,620
Wes Payne is a mastermind of this thing.

1166
00:53:31,620 --> 00:53:34,340
He's gonna be like the CTO of this project.

1167
00:53:34,340 --> 00:53:37,600
He's gonna get veto power for anything too crazy.

1168
00:53:37,600 --> 00:53:39,760
But he's kind of got a really good outline of it already.

1169
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:43,800
Honestly, my life would be so much better if Wes could just veto my decisions.

1170
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:45,600
Oh, everything, right?

1171
00:53:45,600 --> 00:53:49,780
Like we should just submit stuff to Wes over Slack and he just needs like a voting thing

1172
00:53:49,780 --> 00:53:51,280
that he just hits yes, no on, right?

1173
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:56,680
Like I should pull up to a gas station, be like, Wes, it's for, by the way, 420 gallons.

1174
00:53:56,680 --> 00:53:58,680
Oh, oh, please, please.

1175
00:53:58,680 --> 00:54:01,120
Oh, come on, are you busy?

1176
00:54:01,120 --> 00:54:03,280
I paid 589 yesterday.

1177
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:04,280
Get out.

1178
00:54:04,280 --> 00:54:05,560
I did.

1179
00:54:05,560 --> 00:54:06,560
That's wild, dude.

1180
00:54:06,560 --> 00:54:07,560
Really?

1181
00:54:07,560 --> 00:54:12,520
I now pay more just over what I used to pay to fill up my truck, which had more, a larger

1182
00:54:12,520 --> 00:54:13,520
tank.

1183
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:17,920
I now, for my little golf with like a 10.8 gallon tank, I now pay more than I did in

1184
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:19,080
my big Dodge truck.

1185
00:54:19,080 --> 00:54:24,420
I have spent more money on food and gas and I did the math and it was depressing relative

1186
00:54:24,420 --> 00:54:25,420
to my income.

1187
00:54:25,420 --> 00:54:31,160
I have actually gotten poorer or less well off, I guess I should say, because I'm, you

1188
00:54:31,160 --> 00:54:33,580
know, you and me are not poor.

1189
00:54:33,580 --> 00:54:36,660
This is like, I feel it because you and I are not the only ones, listeners out there

1190
00:54:36,660 --> 00:54:37,660
feeling it too.

1191
00:54:37,660 --> 00:54:41,520
That's why like, I kind of laugh about the market because I have to, but I also really

1192
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:43,880
know it's rough for people too.

1193
00:54:43,880 --> 00:54:45,080
I connect with that.

1194
00:54:45,080 --> 00:54:50,800
Well, this has been a interesting experience the last couple of years with the COVID and

1195
00:54:50,800 --> 00:54:55,100
with the market going, I think, frankly insane.

1196
00:54:55,100 --> 00:54:57,480
Probably the wildest rides ever.

1197
00:54:57,480 --> 00:55:00,840
And you know, I was so scared about going independent in the middle of COVID.

1198
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:01,840
I know you were.

1199
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:02,840
I know.

1200
00:55:02,840 --> 00:55:03,840
I remember.

1201
00:55:03,840 --> 00:55:05,400
But this seems actually in some ways scarier.

1202
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:11,360
I think you and I, and not just personally, like, you know, an important part of the show

1203
00:55:11,360 --> 00:55:17,360
for me, maybe I'm in the feelings, is for people opening small businesses, right?

1204
00:55:17,360 --> 00:55:18,360
Yeah.

1205
00:55:18,360 --> 00:55:23,860
It's Coderadio, sure, whatever, but I don't know that you should right now, honestly.

1206
00:55:23,860 --> 00:55:28,040
It feels like a hunker down, collect your, you collect your nuts, squirrel them away.

1207
00:55:28,040 --> 00:55:29,640
Well, I mean, that's your choice, Chris.

1208
00:55:29,640 --> 00:55:32,080
I respect your lifestyle if you want to collect nuts.

1209
00:55:32,080 --> 00:55:33,080
Meanwhile, what?

1210
00:55:33,080 --> 00:55:34,960
You're going to be collecting gold and Bitcoin?

1211
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:38,800
I mean, that's, that's what I, that's where I keep going back.

1212
00:55:38,800 --> 00:55:39,800
That's the silver lining.

1213
00:55:39,800 --> 00:55:45,120
And I just think this is one of the things now that I'm managing, right, for the business,

1214
00:55:45,120 --> 00:55:50,080
trying to not trying to make this too, too gloomer, but like this could have a downturn.

1215
00:55:50,080 --> 00:55:51,080
Did you just say gloomer?

1216
00:55:51,080 --> 00:55:52,080
Isn't that a thing?

1217
00:55:52,080 --> 00:55:53,720
A doom and gloomer?

1218
00:55:53,720 --> 00:55:55,040
It's new to me, but I like it.

1219
00:55:55,040 --> 00:56:00,560
You could see, you could see how this could ultimately result as a decline in the advertising

1220
00:56:00,560 --> 00:56:04,760
space, especially in the tech advertising space as this gets rougher and rougher.

1221
00:56:04,760 --> 00:56:10,200
And so that's why when we went independent again, I focused on memberships and I'm so

1222
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:11,880
super grateful for our members.

1223
00:56:11,880 --> 00:56:16,360
I feel like the boosts are additive because they allow people more one time, one time

1224
00:56:16,360 --> 00:56:19,920
contributions or additional on top of contributions.

1225
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:24,520
And I think if I had my S together and the, and the chain, the supply chain was working,

1226
00:56:24,520 --> 00:56:28,240
I could probably try to add a little bit of a swag sale arm to, to try to make up for

1227
00:56:28,240 --> 00:56:29,240
it.

1228
00:56:29,240 --> 00:56:32,240
But it's like, this is my thing to manage now this year that I didn't really plan for,

1229
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:33,400
but I mean, it's what I got to do.

1230
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:34,720
Well, but you need money.

1231
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:37,960
That's that's, that's the way my man, can I pitch an idea?

1232
00:56:37,960 --> 00:56:38,960
What you got?

1233
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:43,080
Torture Mike or, oh wait, not Mike, Jar Jar.

1234
00:56:43,080 --> 00:56:46,840
So I will in character talk like Jar Jar Binks.

1235
00:56:46,840 --> 00:56:47,840
Oh God.

1236
00:56:47,840 --> 00:56:51,320
And Wes gets to pick a coding challenge for me.

1237
00:56:51,320 --> 00:57:02,760
This is a paid only video or VR at my, at my discretion, at my discretion event, a pay

1238
00:57:02,760 --> 00:57:07,360
per view watching me want to choke West to death because Wes is like, I'm like, Wes,

1239
00:57:07,360 --> 00:57:08,840
you're going to pick like some normal language.

1240
00:57:08,840 --> 00:57:09,840
No closure.

1241
00:57:09,840 --> 00:57:16,680
We need like some really dramatic music, you know, got to have some dramatic lighting changes.

1242
00:57:16,680 --> 00:57:21,920
And then as I get an, and also obviously people can tip me and boost because why would I do

1243
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:23,200
this sober?

1244
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:24,840
So how about this?

1245
00:57:24,840 --> 00:57:30,200
I will become more like Jar Jar as I'm irritated and I don't get to know.

1246
00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:37,640
So you, you give me a brand new Ubuntu or I prefer pop or Mac machine and I have to

1247
00:57:37,640 --> 00:57:39,840
install the tool chain too.

1248
00:57:39,840 --> 00:57:41,320
We got to back off this note here.

1249
00:57:41,320 --> 00:57:45,560
Wes says he's concerned this is turning into some sort of weird coding only fans with Mike

1250
00:57:45,560 --> 00:57:48,880
and he's not sure he wants to be involved with that.

1251
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:50,200
I feel like Wes will do it.

1252
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:51,200
I don't know.

1253
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:52,200
Come on.

1254
00:57:52,200 --> 00:57:53,200
Do it.

1255
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:54,200
Oh, you'll probably do it.

1256
00:57:54,200 --> 00:58:00,120
I just want to say how many languages and how many weeks I got killed, Elm closure is

1257
00:58:00,120 --> 00:58:01,120
I'm like a magneto.

1258
00:58:01,120 --> 00:58:03,120
I'm saying the names in rage.

1259
00:58:03,120 --> 00:58:04,120
Come on, Wes.

1260
00:58:04,120 --> 00:58:05,120
Wes was right.

1261
00:58:05,120 --> 00:58:06,120
Or you know what?

1262
00:58:06,120 --> 00:58:07,120
Worse.

1263
00:58:07,120 --> 00:58:08,760
Put it to the matrix chat room.

1264
00:58:08,760 --> 00:58:10,860
Let them have their, have their way with me.

1265
00:58:10,860 --> 00:58:11,860
That came out wrong.

1266
00:58:11,860 --> 00:58:12,860
Hey, look at you.

1267
00:58:12,860 --> 00:58:14,760
You're giving, you're giving them a, no, you give them a shout out, let them have their

1268
00:58:14,760 --> 00:58:15,760
way with you.

1269
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:16,760
They'll love it.

1270
00:58:16,760 --> 00:58:18,680
They're just, they're probably just glad you're giving them some attention.

1271
00:58:18,680 --> 00:58:19,680
Let's do it.

1272
00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:20,680
Matrix chat room.

1273
00:58:20,680 --> 00:58:26,160
In fact, if someone can figure out how to get my IRC stuff to matrix, that's not me.

1274
00:58:26,160 --> 00:58:27,160
I would be very happy.

1275
00:58:27,160 --> 00:58:28,160
There you go.

1276
00:58:28,160 --> 00:58:30,120
That's probably not going to happen because we don't have the bridge.

1277
00:58:30,120 --> 00:58:35,520
So what about like, I'm just saying pay-per-view torture, Jar Jar, who doesn't want to torture

1278
00:58:35,520 --> 00:58:36,520
Jar Jar?

1279
00:58:36,520 --> 00:58:37,520
I would love to watch.

1280
00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:40,240
I don't know if I want to be involved with the production because you know, it's a lot

1281
00:58:40,240 --> 00:58:46,240
of Jar Jar, but if I could watch, maybe have a few beers, some nachos, put it up on the

1282
00:58:46,240 --> 00:58:49,840
big screen, you know, now I'm starting to enjoy myself, I'm thinking.

1283
00:58:49,840 --> 00:58:54,480
I'm just saying, I mean, you need, let's raise some revenue.

1284
00:58:54,480 --> 00:58:55,480
Let's do it.

1285
00:58:55,480 --> 00:58:56,480
Let's do it.

1286
00:58:56,480 --> 00:58:57,480
In the meantime, where should we send folks?

1287
00:58:57,480 --> 00:58:58,480
Alice.dev.

1288
00:58:58,480 --> 00:58:59,480
Go check it out.

1289
00:58:59,480 --> 00:59:00,480
Go see it.
