00:00.000 --> 00:09.280
This is KOTORadio, episode 333 for November 26th, 2018.

00:30.880 --> 00:36.000
Oh hi you and welcome to KOTORadio, Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show taking a pragmatic

00:36.000 --> 00:41.680
look at the art and the business of software development and its related technologies.

00:41.680 --> 00:47.600
This episode is maybe the last one for a while, recorded in the rainy and gray Pacific Northwest.

00:47.600 --> 00:53.600
My name is Chris, and joining me, like a soldier always at his post, even when we're not doing an

00:53.600 --> 01:00.160
episode, is our host, Mr. Dominic. Hello, Mike. I'm sorry, when I was at a bar, what happened?

01:00.160 --> 01:03.040
No, I think you were stuck in traffic, actually. Yeah, that's true.

01:03.840 --> 01:08.400
You know, I guess the two things are related. You go to a bar, you have a work meeting at lunch,

01:08.400 --> 01:14.800
and then you get stuck in traffic. I haven't actually had that problem where I can't make

01:14.800 --> 01:20.960
it to a show, because like a gentleman, I schedule my travel during non-KOTOR days.

01:20.960 --> 01:26.720
I see what you did there. But man, the most recent travel, I have been stuck in traffic

01:26.720 --> 01:31.360
in a way I have never been stuck before. And that comes from a professional former commuter.

01:31.360 --> 01:36.560
It has been bad, so I do understand. And to make up for it, we're just going to have a

01:36.560 --> 01:45.520
great episode, right? Yeah. I mean, easy, right? No problem. I actually, I think I feel like this

01:45.520 --> 01:50.720
episode is jinxed, if I can be honest with you, because 15 minutes before we started, I just

01:50.720 --> 01:56.800
learned that I'm leaving Washington on Sunday. And I sound like I'm still processing, like,

01:56.800 --> 02:01.120
how does that impact my life and my show production? I'm still trying to figure that out.

02:02.080 --> 02:05.120
It's one of those things. Well, I thought we knew that, because the live audience will get

02:05.120 --> 02:09.440
a little treat at the end of this show. Yeah, yeah. One of us, oh shit, I'm leaving too.

02:09.440 --> 02:12.960
Yeah, exactly. I know, we're prerecording for you, but it turns out we need to be

02:12.960 --> 02:16.160
prerecording for me. Also prerecording. You and I have to stop this whole-

02:16.160 --> 02:19.920
I know. So can we take a tangent about my recent travels?

02:19.920 --> 02:25.200
Yeah, let's do it. So, you know, if there was to be a Bible written by laptops

02:25.920 --> 02:32.560
about angels and devils, I think I might be Satan. Yeah, I agree. I had two casualties

02:32.560 --> 02:36.800
on this. Now, this was a three-legged trip. We went to Tejas. No, you did.

02:36.800 --> 02:43.440
Then, yes, I did. San Antonio. Then to New Jersey, also known as Military City, for those who don't

02:43.440 --> 02:47.840
know. I'm not kidding. Oh, right, for your new clientele for the app.

02:47.840 --> 02:54.800
Yes. And then to New Jersey, and then a quick detour into New York City. By New York,

02:54.800 --> 02:59.120
I had no more laptops. Wait a minute. Okay, so you start the trip

02:59.120 --> 03:02.640
with two laptops, and by the time you get to New York, you got no laptops?

03:02.640 --> 03:10.080
No laptops, and I did not get mugged. So, okay, so I'm packing, right?

03:10.080 --> 03:13.920
Yeah. And I throw in the Mac cable, the USB-C

03:13.920 --> 03:19.760
brick thing. I throw in the Galego cable. Wait, wait, your Galego cable? Your Galego

03:19.760 --> 03:22.480
doesn't charge over USB-C? It does not.

03:24.000 --> 03:27.360
I'm sorry, what? Is this the old Galego, or is this a current Galego?

03:27.360 --> 03:32.400
This is the Gen 2, or 3, whatever the Gen before the one you would buy today is.

03:32.400 --> 03:35.200
Okay. Yeah. For the laptops I buy,

03:35.200 --> 03:42.080
it actually has been a little while. So, okay. Turns out the Galego cable I bought,

03:42.080 --> 03:45.440
brought, was not in fact a Galego cable. Oh, man.

03:45.440 --> 03:50.240
Sucks. And that's the machine I needed for Tejas. So I, in my infinite wisdom,

03:50.880 --> 03:56.400
buy a cable in the airport. Sure. It's kind of fun. Did you do it from

03:56.400 --> 03:58.640
a vending machine, or did you go into one of the actual stores?

03:58.640 --> 04:03.360
You know, they have those vending machines that are super tempting.

04:03.360 --> 04:05.120
That was a weird experience. And yes, I did.

04:05.760 --> 04:09.200
Oh, you did. You used the vending machine. I've always wanted to do that.

04:10.080 --> 04:13.440
You know what? I was so sure my credit card was going to be stolen by the end of that whole

04:13.440 --> 04:15.360
process. I know, right? Yeah.

04:15.360 --> 04:18.880
But I had no choice. I mean, I got to do this demo. There's no way out of this.

04:19.680 --> 04:24.240
So this was a brand that I've never heard of before. And I honestly don't know the name,

04:24.240 --> 04:29.200
because it came in a little plastic pouch, like a Ziploc bag that one would, you know...

04:29.200 --> 04:30.880
Not a box?

04:31.600 --> 04:34.640
It was the only one. It was one of those universal ones with like 10 different

04:34.640 --> 04:37.040
attachments. And you're like, one of these has got to work.

04:37.600 --> 04:42.320
And it turns out it did. So I'll give them that. So whatever, I throw it in my bag,

04:42.960 --> 04:48.160
because I got in, I got a ride to the hotel. Are you Ubering? What are you getting to the

04:48.160 --> 04:50.240
hotel with? I lifted it, but same difference.

04:50.240 --> 04:53.520
Yeah, yeah. Yeah. It sent me a notification that it was

04:53.520 --> 04:56.800
some percentage off. I don't know why. You're like, yes, please.

04:56.800 --> 05:02.160
I'm like, sure. Sounds like a deal. You know what? I got in like 9.45,

05:02.160 --> 05:04.880
and I hadn't eaten, right? Like, this is one of those situations where, you know...

05:04.880 --> 05:06.560
Oh, man. So you're exhausted.

05:06.560 --> 05:11.360
A whole bit. Flight delayed. So I'm like, you know what? I'm starving. I go to the hotel

05:11.360 --> 05:16.800
bar and order a salad. But the first thing I do is check into my room, plug in the computer

05:16.800 --> 05:21.120
to this cable. But I turn it on and I let it run updates. It seems fine.

05:21.120 --> 05:25.200
I guess what I should have noticed was an error message saying that the cable was no good.

05:25.200 --> 05:27.120
What error message? What error message?

05:27.120 --> 05:30.320
I don't know, some kind of like pop up that said like not charging.

05:30.960 --> 05:33.040
No. This isn't a thing.

05:33.040 --> 05:36.480
Well, all right. Well, let me tell you, this is what I've heard digging through forums.

05:37.520 --> 05:40.160
So, but anyway, I didn't check, right? So I just turned it on.

05:40.160 --> 05:42.720
Right. You're hungry. It's nine o'clock at night.

05:42.720 --> 05:46.240
I had a little my fi puck, because I don't use hotel Wi-Fi, because I'm not crazy.

05:46.240 --> 05:48.000
Atta boy, you really got this down.

05:48.000 --> 05:51.200
Right. Well, I, you know how much I travel. I mean, yeah, you do. You have to have it down.

05:51.200 --> 05:54.880
It's just worth the, you know, 20 bucks a month to Verizon for the Wi-Fi puck.

05:54.880 --> 05:57.760
Whatever. I do the updates and I, you know what? I want it to download,

05:58.640 --> 06:02.640
like make sure the demo ran, whatever, whatever. But I was tired and I was hungry. So I get

06:02.640 --> 06:06.480
downstairs and I do chicken wings. You do a salad, really? You do a salad.

06:06.480 --> 06:08.960
I do chicken wings. Cause who can screw up chicken wings?

06:09.600 --> 06:13.040
Well, here's my thing. Well, I could not get a salad because they had no salad.

06:13.040 --> 06:18.560
So I ended up having to wait for what they call the quesadilla. And you would think in Texas,

06:18.560 --> 06:23.200
it would be good, but it was weird. Oh, you're in Texas. Yeah. They don't have salad in Texas.

06:23.200 --> 06:27.600
Yeah. No. The young lady just looked at me like I was on drugs. So then, you know,

06:27.600 --> 06:31.200
I'm sitting there waiting for my food. They were very busy. Remember, this is election night we're

06:31.200 --> 06:36.560
talking about. So this is back a while. And you know, I'm sitting, there's a convention there.

06:36.560 --> 06:40.560
I'm talking to people from the convention doing my salesy thing. Yeah. To be honest,

06:40.560 --> 06:45.920
the convention doing my salesy thing, get upstairs and I'm beat. It's gotta be 1130.

06:45.920 --> 06:49.600
And I have to meet the customer in the morning. And you're out of your time zone too.

06:50.160 --> 06:56.320
I'm out of my time. 1130 local time. Right. Right. So my time, what is that? 2 30. So I get

06:56.320 --> 07:04.000
upstairs, go to sleep, wake up, turn on my laptop, a strange fan noise and beeping.

07:04.000 --> 07:13.120
Oh no. Yeah. So I go, I do the first meeting. Fine. I whip out the Mac book,

07:13.120 --> 07:17.280
install a windows bootcamp partition. I'm sorry. Wait, wait, wait. So was the Galago at this point

07:17.280 --> 07:22.640
just unusable? It wouldn't turn on. Ah, okay. So you brought two machines. Second machine's the

07:22.640 --> 07:28.000
Mac book. Mac book. Is this a USB-C Mac book or is this amazing? It is USB-C. Okay. All right.

07:28.000 --> 07:33.200
And I had the correct adapter that came with it. Right. So I partitioned the drive bootcamp,

07:33.200 --> 07:37.680
whole thing. I let it run all day cause Griffin runs on Linux and windows, right? It doesn't

07:37.680 --> 07:42.800
run on Mac. So fine. We run the windows version. No big deal. Most, you know, the Linux version

07:42.800 --> 07:46.480
is, it doesn't matter. Right. For the, for the end of, for the purposes of a demo,

07:46.480 --> 07:51.200
it doesn't matter. Right. So if you've got windows 10 on there and Griffin runs fine,

07:51.200 --> 07:55.600
good to go. Runs fine. Good to go. So that's how I did my whole Tejas trip.

07:57.120 --> 08:01.120
Fly to New Jersey. Now I'm still thinking it's just a bad cable and there's nothing

08:01.120 --> 08:03.760
wrong with the Gallico, right? Like, you know what? My mistake. I didn't take the

08:03.760 --> 08:09.840
cable that they sent with it. Get to New Jersey and a relative of mine who runs a small business

08:10.800 --> 08:15.920
has a problem. She had left her computers plugged in and it destroyed her only computer.

08:15.920 --> 08:21.200
No. Like from a power issue? Yeah. So I try to recover it. It's toast.

08:22.400 --> 08:28.640
What kind of machine is this? It's a desktop? This is like a cheapo. Windows box? Yeah. Best

08:28.640 --> 08:34.560
fights. This is nothing. So I'm thinking, you know what? Gallico is fine. I'm sure if I plug

08:34.560 --> 08:39.440
it into the right cable, whatever. I have Mac build servers in the cloud. Now I'll just give

08:39.440 --> 08:45.440
her the Mac book or Mac book pro cause she's in a bind. Yeah. Oh man. Wow. So I wipe all my stuff

08:45.440 --> 08:52.240
off. I give it to her. No, you formatted it. Everything's backed up. I didn't lose any data.

08:52.240 --> 09:02.800
Oh man. Okay. Okay. So, so I fly to, you gave her a Mac book while you're in the state of unknown

09:02.800 --> 09:07.920
hardware at that particular point. So I had the iPad pro we ordered on the live show for the

09:07.920 --> 09:13.200
Apple event. I had shipped there to New Jersey. So you acquire the iPad pro at this point?

09:13.200 --> 09:19.600
Acquired the iPad pro and I spent the rest of my entire trip solely working on the iPad pro.

09:19.600 --> 09:24.320
No shit. No. Yeah. That's exactly what had to happen. And, and wait a minute. So you're telling

09:24.320 --> 09:29.520
me you never got the Gallico working again? Ah, so I get back to the sunshine state.

09:30.160 --> 09:33.680
I thought I had it at first. I thought I couldn't get it to turn on. Then I got it to turn on

09:34.320 --> 09:37.280
about two hours ago. I thought I had it working and now it doesn't hold the charge.

09:38.880 --> 09:44.240
So it will work on AC power. It will not work, which is useless to me. Right? Right. Cause it's,

09:44.240 --> 09:48.800
you're traveling. I'm traveling. So I might just send it and see what they charge me.

09:48.800 --> 09:54.400
System 76 to repair it, which is fine. Or I might do something else. I don't know. I,

09:54.400 --> 09:56.960
I have to say that I'm thinking of going back to punch cards.

09:58.720 --> 10:02.480
Yeah. Right. Just pack them all up. Put them in a bag. I am like, I am like the,

10:02.480 --> 10:08.960
the apocalypse of laptops here. Yeah. That's why I was asking you guys in the, in the JV Slack.

10:08.960 --> 10:14.000
So how's that Dell XPS 13 look? Yeah. Well, I mean, the nice thing about the iPad pro I gotta

10:14.000 --> 10:19.360
say is the USB-C charging. So I recently went, I just got back from Texas actually.

10:19.360 --> 10:24.800
And the thing that was really nice for me is I brought one charging cable with me. Funny enough,

10:24.800 --> 10:30.880
I bought a, I, I not, not because I have a Mac book, but I brought the Mac book pro charging

10:30.880 --> 10:38.160
cable. And then I took with me my Lenovo T four 80 and an iPad pro and my pixel three. And I was

10:38.160 --> 10:46.640
able to charge all of my devices with one cable. It was glorious. It was, I can't, for somebody

10:46.640 --> 10:51.840
who's like frequently quickly traveling right now, it was, it was liberating to bring one.

10:51.840 --> 10:58.240
USB-C's gotta be a requirement for whatever I do here. Cause this all started because I mistook

10:58.240 --> 11:03.120
my wife's old Dell XPS cable, which then I got yelled at for taking her charger

11:03.120 --> 11:09.520
for my Gallego cable that wasn't paying attention. Interestingly, I also got the iPad pro,

11:09.520 --> 11:14.320
as you know, I got like the cheapest one I could with LTE on a pencil and the keyboard,

11:14.320 --> 11:23.040
which is still a ridiculous amount of money to spend for a device, but unrelated. I also just

11:23.040 --> 11:29.120
kind of have started waking up at 4 am for, for months now I've been waking up at 4 am. And

11:29.120 --> 11:35.040
what I do is I, I go generally eat like breakfast and I watch something on YouTube and then I try

11:35.040 --> 11:39.600
to go back to bed and maybe I sleep for 30 minutes. And so instead of what I've started

11:39.600 --> 11:43.680
doing about a month ago is it just got up. Like if I wake up at 4 am without an alarm clock,

11:44.320 --> 11:50.480
let's just get up. But then like, seriously, what the frick do you do with yourself? You're up at

11:50.480 --> 11:56.400
4 am like not 5 am not 6 am. Like, what do you do with yourself? Because you go on Twitter and

11:56.400 --> 12:02.480
fight with Kara Swisher. That's what you do. That's what you do. What I did. And I know this makes me

12:02.480 --> 12:07.920
sound like a total douchebag, but it, it fricking works for me is I took the iPad pro and I started

12:07.920 --> 12:11.840
going out to like coffee shops and stuff. And I just started working from there before I even

12:11.840 --> 12:18.080
come into the studio. So I have like, I have this, I have this period of time that is around other

12:18.080 --> 12:23.920
people that keeps me awake. It keeps me alive. It, it, it prevents me from falling back asleep.

12:23.920 --> 12:27.760
And then I come into the studio and I do my real work. But during this period of time,

12:28.800 --> 12:34.480
you know, two hours, an hour and a half, whatever it is, I am exclusively using the iPad pro right

12:34.480 --> 12:41.200
now. I feel like a d-bag, but so it's really working for me. I ended up writing scripts on

12:41.200 --> 12:47.760
the iPad pro using ISH to, and oh my God, it actually worked. Yeah. So you and I are both

12:47.760 --> 12:54.160
using ISH then. This is great. This is, this is a, you have to, you have to get on like the test

12:54.160 --> 12:59.680
pilot program, but it is an entire Linux environment, an Alpine Linux environment

13:00.400 --> 13:06.880
on the iPad. It is even emulating x86 hardware, which is disgusting, but it's, it works.

13:07.600 --> 13:11.920
Well, no, you know what's more disgusting? The iPad pro was more powerful than every device

13:11.920 --> 13:16.480
I've destroyed on this trip. Oh man. Let me tell you the speed and performance that,

13:16.480 --> 13:21.600
so here's the other reason. So the iPad pro it doesn't work for anyone out there who's

13:21.600 --> 13:27.360
never used iOS before. If you're not a happy existing iOS user, do not waste your money

13:27.360 --> 13:31.040
buying one of these things. It's not for you. If you use the Linux desktop and you don't have

13:31.040 --> 13:37.840
an iOS device or you love Android, don't get the iPad pro. It's not a device for you. If

13:37.840 --> 13:43.600
you are an existing and established iOS user and you understand the limitations of iOS,

13:43.600 --> 13:49.280
and you can excel within those limitations for certain types of workflows, I think you

13:49.280 --> 13:53.760
should consider it because I'll give you an example. I get a lot of emails that I have

13:53.760 --> 13:59.440
to convert to PDF and then save the Dropbox. That is a two second process on the iPad pro.

13:59.440 --> 14:04.560
I have to do a lot of Slack and other apps that would be electron on my Linux desktop

14:04.560 --> 14:10.160
that are native applications on the iPad pro and it's fast. It feels better, right?

14:10.160 --> 14:15.840
I do all my go to meetings, Zoom meetings, and all that stuff on the iPad pro. It's so much

14:15.840 --> 14:20.240
better than the Linux or Windows experience. It's way better. It's just way, it's way better.

14:20.240 --> 14:24.240
I shared Google drive and walked them through a doc. I had a meeting this morning and walked

14:24.240 --> 14:27.840
the folks through a document on an iPad pro and I don't think that any idea was on an iPad.

14:27.840 --> 14:32.880
Yeah. And then if you want to participate in the expensive Apple ecosystem, then things

14:32.880 --> 14:38.400
like the AirPods work really well with the iPad pro so you can be somewhere and you can

14:38.400 --> 14:43.120
just open the AirPod case and put the AirPods in and you're doing a, you're doing a virtual meeting

14:43.120 --> 14:49.040
right there from a, from a fricking tablet. And to see how far I could push this, I just recently

14:49.040 --> 15:01.520
got a USB-C to USB-B cable from Amazon. And I hooked up a production grade Zoom U22 audio

15:01.520 --> 15:08.640
interface to my iPad pro with an XLR microphone, like a professional studio microphone, a microphone

15:08.640 --> 15:14.400
that costs $300. And then you have to buy the $60 XLR cable and the audio interface and then plug

15:14.400 --> 15:19.440
all of that into the iPad pro. But I, you know, I have all that stuff. So I just got this like

15:19.440 --> 15:27.280
$9 cable, hooked it up and I'm able to input high grade studio quality microphone audio into the

15:27.280 --> 15:28.720
iPad pro over USB-C.

15:28.720 --> 15:35.280
So when I got my hands on mine, before I decided to give the MacBook away, I did some testing on

15:35.280 --> 15:41.600
the USB-C interface, that's accessible via Swift or theoretically Objective-C on the iOS SDK,

15:41.600 --> 15:47.760
but I did my tests in Swift. It's not locked down. I mean, they don't make certain things easy. So

15:47.760 --> 15:51.520
you have to write your own, like file, like there's a lot of stuff. If you want to do something,

15:51.520 --> 15:57.680
you have to do it, right? But well, storage sucks, but everything else, audio devices,

15:57.680 --> 16:05.920
interface devices, video devices, monitors, HDMI, ethernet, or even using a tablet in a factory,

16:05.920 --> 16:11.760
let's say to flash IOT devices or IOT boards. If you have USB-C to USB-C and you have a custom app

16:11.760 --> 16:17.360
on iOS, technically that's just like an opening up. I mean, this isn't gross oversimplification,

16:17.360 --> 16:22.480
but opening a port and just flash it onto the board. Well, this could be a real,

16:22.480 --> 16:25.600
it could be basically do anything you want. Maybe. I mean, you got to keep in mind it's Apple and

16:25.600 --> 16:28.800
they're going to lock this shit down as much as they can. No, it's not locked down. I literally

16:28.800 --> 16:31.840
did it. It's not locked down. Yeah. I mean, it's, yes, but at the same time-

16:31.840 --> 16:36.640
Going outbound, right? I'm talking outbound. So I'm talking your code on iOS goes over USB-C

16:36.640 --> 16:39.280
and interacts with another device. I'm not talking about modifying the system.

16:39.280 --> 16:44.800
Yes. Okay. All right. Absolutely. Yeah. Yeah, there, I agree. I have had, and you too, it's funny,

16:45.360 --> 16:49.600
really super condensed amount of travel. Oh man, I wish I had my, um,

16:49.600 --> 16:55.360
I don't have the app with me, but I've done something like 60,000 miles in the last like

16:55.360 --> 17:01.200
four months. Um, it's just, it's unbelievable. I'm like, I get like access to clubs and stuff.

17:01.200 --> 17:04.080
Like I can go in the Alaskan lounge now and just-

17:04.080 --> 17:10.720
Nice. Yeah, it's great. But I tell you what, I, I, I totally spend all of that time surveying

17:10.720 --> 17:18.480
everyone in the lounge and not really, really, I mean, there's some, but I mean, really almost

17:18.480 --> 17:24.320
everyone is using a tablet of some form in the lounges and at the airports and on the plane.

17:24.320 --> 17:29.120
And yeah, I'm a dick bag, but I'm buying the premium seating or once or twice, maybe first

17:29.120 --> 17:31.760
class, but every now and then too, like- Naughty boy.

17:31.760 --> 17:34.560
Yeah. Well, I haven't submitted those expenses yet. We'll see how that goes.

17:34.560 --> 17:39.920
But, um, I, I also am, I'm coaching it up, you know, 95% of the time and-

17:39.920 --> 17:42.480
Yeah, I'm, I'm, I'm coach plus usually, but that's about it.

17:42.480 --> 17:48.400
Coach plus my, yeah. Coach plus is my average with some coach and the rare first class only

17:48.400 --> 17:50.480
when it's like the only seat available.

17:50.480 --> 17:54.800
Although I, I did treat myself to business class this time and I was like,

17:55.360 --> 17:57.280
you can call me Mr. Dominic. Thank you.

17:57.280 --> 18:00.080
And you get, you get the free booze. You get the free booze.

18:00.080 --> 18:04.880
Free booze. Well, you know what's funny? I have flown so many Southwest United flights

18:04.880 --> 18:08.240
now in the last few months. Yeah. I get free booze tickets anyway.

18:08.240 --> 18:11.680
Oh, really? That's nice. Yeah. Well, have you ever been on a Southwest flight?

18:12.640 --> 18:15.840
Oh, I mean, yeah, but not recently. Nobody wants you sober. Nobody wants to be sober.

18:15.840 --> 18:20.960
Well, so, uh, if you want the commuter flight between Washington and Texas,

18:20.960 --> 18:25.200
you go with Alaska airlines. It's a nonstop three hour, 50 minute flight. So,

18:25.200 --> 18:31.680
I signed up for their lounges and I'm at the bar and I'm there with probably, I don't know,

18:31.680 --> 18:37.040
15 other people and all of us are on tablets. Now, the great thing is, is it's all, you can drink

18:37.840 --> 18:41.600
just part of the membership. So, if you fly better after having a few drinks,

18:42.320 --> 18:45.040
I do everything better. Which airline is this? Alaska you said?

18:45.040 --> 18:49.200
Yeah, it's Alaska. Yeah. Delta. I'm also looking at Delta now because I'm flying enough on Delta

18:49.200 --> 18:53.200
that I might, I might be able to fly better. I'm not sure. I'm not sure.

18:53.200 --> 18:56.240
I'm flying enough on Delta that I might, I might be able to get into the Delta lounge.

18:57.040 --> 19:02.320
Same thing. Yeah. United is a respectable two drinks. Oh, really? They limit you.

19:02.320 --> 19:06.400
Well, you can, they free to, uh, you pay for the rest.

19:06.400 --> 19:09.920
I will tell you, I mean, I don't get, I don't get sloshed cause I think they're making them

19:09.920 --> 19:12.880
a little on the light side, but, uh, I've never walked out of an,

19:12.880 --> 19:16.960
I've never walked out of an Alaska lounge without at least three drinks for free.

19:17.920 --> 19:21.200
Well that, and I don't know about you. Oh, the other thing is I was carrying,

19:21.200 --> 19:23.920
I didn't tell you about the TSA. This is going to be a weird show folks. Sorry,

19:23.920 --> 19:28.960
but this is hilarious. So I was carrying 3d light scanners in my luggage.

19:28.960 --> 19:35.040
Wait, what? Yeah. Go to peel 3d. I was carrying one of those. Just peel 3d. Google it. If you

19:35.040 --> 19:40.960
people are interested. Um, the TSA was very, very unhappy. Really?

19:41.760 --> 19:48.560
Well, they look like, uh, weird guns. Are you doing regular animal style PS TSA? Like

19:48.560 --> 19:52.880
I did not. I did not get my pre-check approved yet because I didn't go do the, uh, I still have to

19:52.880 --> 19:57.600
go do that. What's the matter with you? What is it? Two laptops, two skaters.

19:57.600 --> 20:01.200
It's 10 times easier than getting your passport and getting your passport. Isn't that hard?

20:01.200 --> 20:05.040
You, you, uh, you, you just do a quick interview and you're done. And I know,

20:05.040 --> 20:08.960
I know I gotta go do it. Everybody's got TSA pre-checked. So there are lines. So don't think

20:08.960 --> 20:12.800
it's going to save you a ton of time, but it means you don't have to empty your bag.

20:12.800 --> 20:16.720
You don't have to take off your shoes. I mean, I'm telling you, man, I have gotten through with

20:16.720 --> 20:21.360
stuff that is not legal. And I mean, I shouldn't say that because they're probably listening,

20:21.360 --> 20:26.240
but the TSA pre-check is the way to go. That's for sure. Because when you look at my audio

20:26.240 --> 20:30.560
recording equipment, it looks like it's like a bomb. Like it just looks like I'm carrying a

20:30.560 --> 20:36.880
legal contraband, like custom motherboards. Right. I have, I have circuit boards. I have

20:36.880 --> 20:42.160
coiled cables. I have tubular devices that have modules in them. I mean, it looks like I am

20:42.160 --> 20:48.080
carrying like a weapon of mass destruction. And so TSA constantly would be like, what is this? What

20:48.080 --> 20:52.240
is this? So I got the pre-check and now they still scan the bag, but they've never stopped me.

20:53.040 --> 20:58.880
So you got to get the pre-check or clear. Okay. I got to try that. I don't, I don't know what clear

20:58.880 --> 21:04.960
is. Anyway. Well, clear is another, it's like a, it's a commercial competitor to TSA that, that a

21:04.960 --> 21:09.760
lot of airports contract. So if you haven't seen clear, then it's not one for you to sign up.

21:09.760 --> 21:15.280
All the airports I go through have clear. Yeah. So you're, so you, you traveling with two bags is

21:15.280 --> 21:21.520
super heavy. Are you checking luggage every time? I had to check one. So what I figured out, so I

21:21.520 --> 21:26.880
was depositing some of this hardware in Texas. So the trip, as soon as I got to Texas, everything

21:26.880 --> 21:30.240
was a lot simpler because then I didn't need to check a bag because it was one of those situations

21:30.240 --> 21:37.200
where it's like a luggage set. So one bag was just equipment protected by clothing, which was checked,

21:37.200 --> 21:41.840
which I did get a lovely note from the TSA that it was searched. And the other bag was the rest of

21:41.840 --> 21:46.720
the crap and some clothes. So you get the iPad pro, you get some time to play with it before you

21:46.720 --> 21:52.800
hand over the Mac book back book. Did you set it up new? Did you transfer from an iCloud image? What

21:52.800 --> 21:57.280
I never transfer. I always set it up. Do you, I did this time. I went new this time. Yeah. Yeah.

21:57.280 --> 22:02.560
I just don't trust the iCloud. Did you get the pencil with it? I did. I spent way too much on a

22:02.560 --> 22:07.680
tablet. Yeah. Yeah. What are your impressions though of the pencil? I'll, I'll, I'll tell you

22:07.680 --> 22:12.320
mine just to put them out there. So you know what my bias is. I also got the Apple pencil because I

22:12.320 --> 22:15.840
thought, you know, if I'm going to get an iPad, I haven't bought one for three or four years.

22:15.840 --> 22:20.320
If I'm getting an iPad, I'm going to get an iPad. I'm going to get one with LTE. I'm going to get

22:20.320 --> 22:24.720
one with the keyboard. I'm going to get one with the pencil. And I, I knew that since I bought my

22:24.720 --> 22:28.880
last iPad. In fact, it's the reason I did not buy the last iPad pro because I knew I was going to

22:28.880 --> 22:32.560
spend a lot of money and I just wasn't ready to spend that money. So I want everybody to understand

22:32.560 --> 22:38.720
that like, you know, this is something I calculated three years out, but it was still a painful

22:38.720 --> 22:46.960
purchase for me. And when I got the, when I got the pencil, I was very worried that it would be a

22:46.960 --> 22:52.960
total fucking waste of money because it's way too expensive. And it only works with this iPad,

22:52.960 --> 22:57.520
doesn't work with my phone, doesn't work with any of the kids I have. It doesn't work with my

22:57.520 --> 23:03.680
iPad. It doesn't work with any of the kids iPads, doesn't work with a Dia's iPhone. It only works

23:03.680 --> 23:12.720
with my super nice iPad pro. So, and I don't draw. I stick figures. CPG gray makes me look like a

23:12.720 --> 23:19.920
child. So I was really concerned that I wouldn't get any use out of the pencil. But what I realize

23:19.920 --> 23:24.720
now after using it for a few weeks is the pencil is the new mouse in a lot of ways. Has your

23:24.720 --> 23:31.440
thought changed? Not exactly, but I think you should keep going before I jump in. Well, I'm

23:31.440 --> 23:40.080
using it for tech selection, cursor, cursor, like positioning. And I mean, part of that is because

23:40.080 --> 23:43.760
the fricking iPad doesn't have the ability like you have on the iPhone where you can press down

23:43.760 --> 23:49.200
on the keyboard and you get a mouse cursor, which you basically can convert the iPhone keyboard

23:49.200 --> 23:56.320
into a trackpad, which is great for editing text. But you know what's way better at working with

23:56.320 --> 24:00.800
text is a larger screen like the iPad, but you don't fricking get that push down on the keyboard

24:00.800 --> 24:07.040
functionality. So I use the pencil for that quite a bit. A big part of my show prep is highlighting

24:07.040 --> 24:13.360
sections of articles for news. The pencil works great for that. And just kind of finessing the

24:13.360 --> 24:19.840
interface. I use the pencil quite a bit for that as well. So I have found it to be kind of like

24:19.840 --> 24:30.640
mouse 2.0 in a lot of ways. So I like the pencil a lot as well. My issue was that apps we still

24:30.640 --> 24:37.360
don't take advantage of the pencil. And I kept wanting it to be able to do things that I felt

24:37.360 --> 24:44.080
were very intuitive, that it just doesn't do. Right. If the app support of the pencil was as

24:44.080 --> 24:50.880
good of support as they have for the keyboard, it would be great. Like the keyboard is surprisingly

24:50.880 --> 24:56.720
well supported. You can hold down the- Yeah, it's really good. Yeah, you see all the available

24:56.720 --> 25:03.760
commands. Well, and a weird collection of Mac, like if you've used a Mac for a long time,

25:03.760 --> 25:11.600
Mac keyboard shortcuts just work. Which I find- Yeah, yeah. Like Alt-Tab and copy and paste and

25:11.600 --> 25:15.520
all those kinds of things. As Varitunda points out, in a way, we're rediscovering the stylus.

25:15.520 --> 25:22.640
And it is that. Going back to our travel theme here, what works really, really well for my lady

25:22.640 --> 25:28.960
and I is to do a Google image search of a high resolution calendar. So like January or December,

25:28.960 --> 25:33.840
like a basic business calendar. And then she takes that image from Google images-

25:33.840 --> 25:37.920
Wait, wait, a basic picture. Does it come with a pumpkin spice latte? I can't let that one go.

25:37.920 --> 25:44.480
No, you know what I'm saying? Like it's just like the most clear grid calendar for like January 2019.

25:44.480 --> 25:49.840
Oh yeah, sure. Okay. It's just really plain, just a high resolution. Like somebody just created this

25:49.840 --> 25:55.600
and then posted online. So what she'll do on the iPad Pro is she'll go Google images for like

25:55.600 --> 26:01.040
February, January. She'll get a great looking calendar that has basically nothing on it.

26:01.040 --> 26:06.480
She saves that to the photos or actually no, I'm wrong. What she does is she imports that photo

26:06.480 --> 26:12.720
into a new note. And then she brings that into Apple notes and she illustrates our entire month

26:12.720 --> 26:18.560
on these calendars. Like she can pinch to zoom to get like a lot of working room in a particular day.

26:18.560 --> 26:26.080
And she can illustrate an entire like road trip or I'm planning to go to Fosdam, which is

26:27.120 --> 26:31.920
in Brussels. Like that's a massive trip because I'm leaving from Texas, not Washington because

26:31.920 --> 26:37.360
I have to go to Brussels mid trip. So it's one of those, okay, we're going to travel to here,

26:37.360 --> 26:39.920
then we're going to fly to here, then we're going to drive to here, then we're going to

26:39.920 --> 26:43.280
fly to Brussels, then we're going to fly back and then we're going to drive to here.

26:43.280 --> 26:47.440
And I'm a visual person. And so being able to actually draw all that out on a calendar,

26:47.440 --> 26:52.400
goes from like nebulous concept that I can't wrap my head around to, oh, okay, well now I'm going to

26:52.400 --> 26:56.800
prep the team to expect when I'm going to be gone. It really makes a difference.

26:58.480 --> 27:02.080
And it's the pencil, it's not a mouse. You know what I mean? Drawing.

27:02.080 --> 27:07.200
Yeah, no, I get it. Right. Drawing makes, well, it's because it's like I take notes by hand still.

27:07.200 --> 27:11.760
And it's just because like I can just quickly draw up like a simple UML diagram, right? I get

27:11.760 --> 27:15.440
people who have worked with me will know that like, I'm a big fan of just walking up to the

27:15.440 --> 27:18.800
whiteboard. Let's just like draw it with the system. What didn't broad strokes look like, right?

27:19.760 --> 27:25.280
Do you agree though, that no one should buy this? And it is an extremely limited platform

27:25.280 --> 27:29.360
where the operating system is one of the biggest constraints and that it is a total waste of money?

27:30.160 --> 27:31.920
Well, I don't like absolutes, right?

27:31.920 --> 27:38.480
I feel like it is both one of the best computers I have ever owned in my entire life going back

27:38.480 --> 27:44.160
to the 80s. And it's also one of the biggest wastes of money because a lot of that power is

27:44.160 --> 27:54.400
just completely untapped. So it's weird for me. Like, you know, I had to draft my flight simulation

27:54.400 --> 27:58.400
rigging to be my desktop. That's what I'm talking about. I'm in the elementary partition right now

27:59.360 --> 28:06.080
because I've destroyed all my laptops. And the iPad Pro is not quite as powerful as this machine

28:06.080 --> 28:11.440
because yay, graphics card. Right. But it's not that far off either, right? Like this is...

28:11.440 --> 28:17.040
I mean, if you deal with a machine that's all Intel parts, the iPad Pro probably kicks its ass.

28:19.040 --> 28:24.080
It is in a weird way, the best portable computer. And I'm going to use the word computer here

28:24.880 --> 28:31.040
that I have ever owned or I think seen. That's not like just a giant thing that dies in 45 minutes.

28:32.400 --> 28:37.360
But because of Apple's weird hangups about software distribution and like how you can

28:37.360 --> 28:43.120
access and use the system and frankly, file access, which I never thought in 2018,

28:43.120 --> 28:48.880
going on 2019 very shortly, that I would be complaining about like, you know, file access.

28:48.880 --> 28:54.400
Yeah, kind of. I mean, in a way, though, the integration with cloud services is pretty slick.

28:54.400 --> 28:59.520
Like if it's in iCloud or everything on the cloud or in Dropbox. Yeah, you're set. Yeah, exactly.

29:00.480 --> 29:07.040
I don't know about that. Right. Oh, totally. It's I want it on a USB thumb drive, to be honest with

29:07.040 --> 29:11.280
you. And I'd like to then copy it to the local iPad storage, which is crazy fast.

29:14.000 --> 29:18.640
I am hoping that like, like, you know, the USB port being relatively open

29:19.360 --> 29:23.440
gives me a lot of hope that like, you know what, they're going to make this a true utilitarian

29:23.440 --> 29:27.360
device. And I know it's not going to happen because it's Apple and whatever, but they're

29:27.360 --> 29:32.480
going to come close enough that it doesn't that it's OK. Yeah, right now you're still very like

29:32.480 --> 29:38.640
like I watched the announcement live and I bought the NBA 2K game.

29:40.800 --> 29:45.760
It's awesome, right? Like, you know what? I haven't really done console gaming in a while.

29:46.640 --> 29:50.320
I don't do a lot of PC gaming, but for like games like Civilization and, you know,

29:50.320 --> 29:53.920
like Rogue Legacy, indie games. But even then, I barely get to play anymore.

29:54.800 --> 29:58.160
To me, if you just showed me like a video of someone playing that game,

29:58.160 --> 30:02.400
like without showing me the device, I would assume they were on like an Xbox 360,

30:02.400 --> 30:06.800
right? Even like a low budget Xbox. I know it's phenomenal. It's right.

30:06.800 --> 30:11.680
I mean, have you tried the NBA game? It's the graphics on this thing are they're

30:11.680 --> 30:16.400
literally console level graphics. It's it's unbelievable what Apple's doing. So that's why

30:16.400 --> 30:20.720
it strikes me as funny that you think the big problem is the file system. Like, I agree with

30:20.720 --> 30:24.160
Wes and I don't think that's the big problem. I think that's a problem. I think the big problem is

30:24.160 --> 30:29.200
Apple's general philosophy of not letting app developers basically treat it like a PC,

30:29.200 --> 30:37.920
which is what it is. Yeah. Okay. All right. I mean, I guess and maybe this is a mistake on my

30:37.920 --> 30:44.880
part, but I'm giving them a pass until WWDC and iOS 13. If they don't fucking make good in June

30:44.880 --> 30:50.240
with iOS 13, then it's on like Donkey Kong. I'm going to be so good. What do you what do you mean?

30:50.240 --> 30:55.680
What do you what do you mean? What's good? iOS 13 needs to be an iPad focused release. It needs

30:55.680 --> 31:00.960
to make the iPad a real machine like it needs to be all about all of these little rough edges.

31:00.960 --> 31:06.960
And the file system is not it. Like, I don't think it's not the OS. It's even like forget about like

31:06.960 --> 31:12.400
the OS being like kind of mobile focus and a little bit of a pain in the ass. And it's built

31:12.400 --> 31:16.640
for a phone. Right. Yeah. Well, yeah. I mean, certainly there's quality of life things, but I

31:16.640 --> 31:20.000
feel like we're talking about two different things where I'm talking about the fact that

31:20.000 --> 31:25.360
Apple will reject apps that do things that are like interesting with the device. Ah, okay. Like,

31:25.360 --> 31:29.360
if I believed all right, let's let's let's back it out there. And thank you for to our new owners,

31:29.360 --> 31:34.000
Linux Academy. They're going to hate this. If I believed that I could write an iOS app,

31:34.000 --> 31:37.360
just like I could like submitted elementary app or even a Mac OS app today.

31:38.800 --> 31:42.960
I would not even look at replacing my dead laptops with anything but a Mac.

31:44.240 --> 31:49.200
Because this is the see what annoys me is this is the tablet device that could fulfill my long

31:49.200 --> 31:55.200
standing or Windows RT tablet dream. But I have no faith that they're going to actually allow

31:55.200 --> 32:00.400
developers to do what needs to be done. Right. Right. And this is where I think the iPad Pro

32:00.400 --> 32:05.120
is not an appealing purchase to most people. This is what I was getting at. It's the apps

32:05.120 --> 32:12.000
aren't powerful. Well, I mean, they're they are very powerful within the limitations that Apple

32:12.000 --> 32:15.760
allows them. I have been very I mean, they're beautiful and they're fast. I mean, powerful as

32:15.760 --> 32:21.120
an they're getting they're getting legitimately, though they're getting way the fuck better than

32:21.120 --> 32:25.520
they used to be. And I don't swear a lot on this show. Usually that's that's your domain.

32:25.520 --> 32:30.480
My department. Right. I have had a couple of come to Jesus moments with the iPad Pro

32:31.040 --> 32:36.000
where I have I kid you not on two different occasions. This is my thought process.

32:37.680 --> 32:42.800
Oh, OK, so I will never do this again on any other OS other than iOS.

32:42.800 --> 32:49.680
For two different major video mother effing editing and audio mother effing editing,

32:49.680 --> 32:56.880
I have I have seen a lot. Yeah. Oh, my. Oh, oh, oh, my goodness. Oh, my goodness. Basically,

32:56.880 --> 33:04.000
there is a Final Cut equivalent for iOS that is. Yes, there is. Fantastic. And it is efficient.

33:04.000 --> 33:10.640
It is clean. It is fast. It totally takes advantage of the iPad hardware. And then

33:10.640 --> 33:18.320
there is a multitrack audio editor called Fairight that is available for iOS. And it is

33:18.880 --> 33:24.560
perfect at exactly the type of workflow that I now have with audio editing, because I now have

33:24.560 --> 33:30.080
Joe and Ham that edit these shows for us. I'm not doing the show editing. But anytime you hear

33:30.080 --> 33:36.240
real time audio, anytime you hear a clip or a sound effect, that's from me. And I make those edits.

33:36.240 --> 33:46.240
And Fairight is a multitrack audio editing system that is perfect on the iPad Pro. It is perfect

33:46.240 --> 33:53.360
with the keyboard. And it is exceptionally perfect with the pencil. And I can bang out audio in

33:54.240 --> 34:00.960
seconds with this thing. I have now successfully edited six different audio projects using Fairight,

34:00.960 --> 34:07.040
including audio that I have captured over the USB interface into the iPad Pro directly into Fairight

34:07.040 --> 34:13.680
and MP4s that I have downloaded from YouTube using shortcuts to download them from YouTube

34:13.680 --> 34:19.120
and automatically import them into Fairight. Like I hear a great clip. I can then create just by the

34:19.120 --> 34:26.320
share menu an action that downloads that video and then extracts the audio from it and then imports

34:26.320 --> 34:32.480
that audio into Fairight. And I can be editing as fast as the internet connection allows. And it is

34:32.480 --> 34:39.280
10 times faster than I could ever do on the desktop. I'm not going back. I'm always doing that

34:39.280 --> 34:48.800
via iOS from now on. My mind is actually blown. My brain is scattered across the back of the wall

34:48.800 --> 34:57.120
here. Chris, you're seducing me. I mean, the apps are getting way more powerful. They are

34:57.120 --> 35:03.520
way more powerful. No, I agree with you. I've played with the USB interface. So for a show

35:03.520 --> 35:12.000
called Coder Radio, there was no code reason why I can't do like the literal 75 field notebooks

35:12.000 --> 35:16.960
full of app ideas I have. Well, except for there's no Xcode for iPad. No, no, no. I mean,

35:16.960 --> 35:22.560
I mean, I don't care. I'll do it on a Mac, right? Two or Windows if I'm using Xamarin, or hell,

35:22.560 --> 35:30.000
I could do Xamarin on Linux now because yay, JetBrains Rider. How do I see everything you

35:30.000 --> 35:35.520
just told me makes me think that I'm a little dated on my view of the app review team here.

35:36.720 --> 35:43.360
That I'm still fighting a battle from like 2013 2014. Well, I think it's not your fault. I blame

35:43.360 --> 35:50.240
Apple because Apple since the beginning has made this iPad versus laptop comparison. I mean, there

35:50.240 --> 35:55.520
was quotes from Steve Jobs about how the iPad was going to be the real computer and that laptops

35:55.520 --> 36:02.240
are going to be trucks. And then even in the most recent Apple event, they had a comparison of iPad

36:02.240 --> 36:06.240
sales where they were just blowing away laptop sales. And they were making the comparison right

36:06.240 --> 36:12.160
there on their gigantic projector saying how much more iPad sales there are than laptop sales.

36:12.160 --> 36:20.880
So Apple is themselves stoking this conversation of comparing tablets to laptops, which then makes

36:20.880 --> 36:26.560
everyone compare tablets to real computers that can do real work. That it's not a fair comparison

36:26.560 --> 36:34.880
yet. But if you look at this as a new device that supplements the work and does not replace the work

36:34.880 --> 36:41.440
of the x86 type computer or the desktop computer or the laptop computer, but maybe except for

36:41.440 --> 36:48.160
but maybe accelerates at certain limited types of workflows, your slack, your emails, your audio

36:48.160 --> 36:53.680
editing, your video editing, maybe your photo workflows. Because think about how this thing is

36:53.680 --> 36:59.600
built. It's built with CPU cores that are hyper accelerated at specific kinds of tasks,

37:00.240 --> 37:05.600
photo manipulation, processing. No doubt. Right. So it's not a replacement, is it? It is a

37:05.600 --> 37:10.800
supplement, isn't it? It is a supplement and not a replacement. And so if you think about how you

37:10.800 --> 37:16.800
work, like for me in the morning, I prefer to do more conceptual work. I'll write out show docs.

37:16.800 --> 37:22.160
I'll make big plans for the for the department for the week. I'll email people that are on the

37:22.160 --> 37:27.680
East Coast. Like I'll do these things that are more mental and I'll do that in the morning

37:27.680 --> 37:34.720
from an iPad because it's slack, it's air mail, it's telegram, it's Zoom. Exactly how I do it.

37:34.720 --> 37:42.080
Yeah. Well, and and and with that in mind, then it just really comes down to is it worth the money

37:42.080 --> 37:46.800
when you combine the performance? It's a little rough, though. It's rough, isn't it? It's like,

37:46.800 --> 37:50.720
are you willing to buy a phone, a laptop, a desktop and a tablet?

37:51.600 --> 37:55.920
Like, I got to be I got to be honest with you. If I had known like the day I was watching

37:55.920 --> 37:59.920
Lana Del Rey and drooling on myself that for those who didn't see the Apple event,

37:59.920 --> 38:05.200
Lana Del Rey was the singer. I I almost certainly would have ordered the iPad with

38:05.200 --> 38:10.880
with the Apple branded case and the Apple branded pencil. You know what I mean? Like,

38:10.880 --> 38:16.320
yeah, because that was I mean, it was a thousand dollars. Mine was mine was, I think,

38:16.320 --> 38:20.880
a little over tax. It was like thirteen hundred. Yeah, that's a laptop. I mean, seriously, that's

38:20.880 --> 38:26.720
your. Yeah, it is. It is. Now, for me, I'm in a situation where my laptop has now been purchased

38:26.720 --> 38:36.480
by my employer. So I no longer have to finance the lab. And Chris rub that salt. So this is really

38:36.480 --> 38:42.480
my computer. This is this is the first computer I've ever bought since I've gone full time working

38:42.480 --> 38:48.480
for someone else that is paying for my equipment. And legitimately, I don't expect to buy another

38:48.480 --> 38:54.400
computer. And when I travel and I was trying to get to this point earlier, what what seems to

38:54.400 --> 38:58.800
validate what you and I are talking about and the reason why I'm really kind of willing to go all in

38:58.800 --> 39:09.280
on this subject is when I when I'm in the airport, when I'm traveling, I I almost exclusively see

39:09.280 --> 39:14.480
tablets. Now, I have I have seen a couple of laptops. I recently told a story on Linux Unplugged

39:14.480 --> 39:21.200
about a Microsoft employee who was trying to make a convertible laptop work. But the reality is they

39:21.200 --> 39:27.280
just they crush your available space and they make they make it so that even the space that a

39:27.280 --> 39:34.160
12 inch laptop takes up is not enough. Plus, you got crappy power that you can maybe plug into.

39:34.160 --> 39:38.320
So if you have something that charges over USB, you're way better off. But secondarily,

39:38.320 --> 39:44.400
kind of just the like the just the nuts and bolts of it is when you're traveling. So you're in an

39:44.400 --> 39:52.160
airplane. The the media experience where you can watch videos and the TV shows that are on a local

39:52.160 --> 39:59.680
server, sure, it's just way better on mobile devices. It it really effing sucks on Windows.

39:59.680 --> 40:07.600
I watched a passenger just recently spend nearly an entire four hour flight trying to get Windows 10

40:07.600 --> 40:13.600
to stream the videos because you got no Internet. Right. So if you need to go get a flash update or

40:13.600 --> 40:18.880
something like that, your S.O.L. You're done. Right. But if you're on a iOS or Android device,

40:19.520 --> 40:23.760
you've got the app installed and you're good to go. It's HTML5 because there's no flash.

40:25.600 --> 40:30.080
So I just want to throw one point here as someone who spent a lot of money and time trying to make

40:30.080 --> 40:38.720
WinRT work. I hate two in one devices. I want them to die. Yeah, because each side is sort of

40:38.720 --> 40:44.240
two minutes compromised. Yeah, right. It sounds like a good idea, but it's just not. It's an

40:44.240 --> 40:49.200
awkward tablet. The software you have the right to make that work is actually really shitty and

40:49.200 --> 40:53.760
complicated. What most people do is just like take the desktop version and just like blow up the

40:53.760 --> 41:00.080
buttons a little bit. It could you know, I could see it working if we had 10 years of iteration

41:00.080 --> 41:06.320
on software design to make it work right. But it is so rough right now that it is supremely

41:06.320 --> 41:09.760
frustrating to use. Yeah, and I don't I don't think that's the direction things are going.

41:09.760 --> 41:14.880
I mean, for all my skepticism about the iPad Pro, I have a feeling next time Chris and I are done

41:14.880 --> 41:20.480
taking planes. I'm like, so let's talk about Mac OS Mojave because that's what I'm all kidding

41:20.480 --> 41:27.120
aside. Do you think so? I actually think in a way it makes me a better Linux user to have an iPad.

41:29.120 --> 41:31.360
So, again, I'm thinking about developer opportunities, though.

41:31.360 --> 41:39.360
Yeah, I think there this is see my vision of the of the tablet revolution was going to be that

41:39.920 --> 41:43.840
there would be pro level applications for tablets that really made a lot of sense.

41:43.840 --> 41:49.120
Ah, see my pro on my computer and my consumer like basic bitch apps are on my tablet.

41:49.120 --> 41:54.000
But you're like a hyper pro, right? I'm talking pro apps like write some company

41:54.000 --> 41:59.840
who has like a hangar or a factory, some custom tablet app for their format or quality control

41:59.840 --> 42:03.840
people or something like that. Right. Yeah. And then that makes a lot of sense for them.

42:03.840 --> 42:09.760
Yeah, I. I'm very conflicted, Chris. You know, you've really hurt me here. This is.

42:13.040 --> 42:17.600
I feel like it is a it's a rich person's toy and not that I am rich. I am not rich,

42:17.600 --> 42:24.000
but it is. Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Vice, Mr. Gore, Mr. Gore. Nobody. Nobody in my situation

42:24.000 --> 42:29.200
after years and years and years and years and years of grinding it out to make a podcast network work

42:29.200 --> 42:33.040
is is rich. Nobody. I don't know about a podcast network, but tell me more about

42:33.040 --> 42:39.040
grinding it out for 10 years. Oh, yeah. It just leaves you devastated. Right. So I mean, at best,

42:39.040 --> 42:47.200
at best, I'm back to not even, you know. Oh, I had. Oh, what was it? Oh, just something just

42:47.200 --> 42:54.000
recently just crossed my. Oh, garbage bags. So, yeah, garbage bags. This is how my life has changed.

42:54.000 --> 43:01.680
I'm not rich, but. So my garbage really stinks right now in my house, you know, my RV, it's

43:01.680 --> 43:07.040
full of garlic. I roasted a I roasted a bunch of garlic and then I like I threw out like the husks

43:07.040 --> 43:12.880
and everything and the and the garbage just frickin reeks in a delicious way. But it makes

43:12.880 --> 43:19.280
because the RV is only 47 feet long, it makes the whole RV smell like garlic. And we're going into

43:19.280 --> 43:25.120
two days of this whole RV smelling like garlic. And I'm sitting there in the RV finally by myself

43:25.120 --> 43:30.480
for the first time in weeks. And I'm thinking to myself. Why haven't because the garbage is only

43:30.480 --> 43:33.920
half full because I haven't been home much and neither has the idea and neither of the kids.

43:33.920 --> 43:39.520
So, like, why is the garbage only half full? And yet I'm still putting up with the smell,

43:39.520 --> 43:44.720
like, why haven't I taken it out yet? And I'm like, am I that lazy that I haven't just collected

43:44.720 --> 43:49.600
the garbage and taken it out in the last couple of days? And then I realized, oh, no, what it was

43:49.600 --> 43:55.920
is I didn't want to waste the money. The negative space in the garbage bag. I only have so much room,

43:55.920 --> 44:00.560
right? I mean, I only have so much money. I can only buy so many garbage bags. And if we run out

44:00.560 --> 44:05.840
of garbage bags before my next paycheck, I can't buy any more garbage bags. So we need to make

44:05.840 --> 44:10.720
every garbage bag last and therefore everything must smell like garlic for the next three days,

44:10.720 --> 44:16.400
because God forbid that I throw out a garbage bag that is half full. And I'm sat there and I realized,

44:16.400 --> 44:20.720
you know what? I can now afford more garbage bags. I can take that out.

44:20.720 --> 44:24.800
Do you know what the worst part of this conversation is? That's exactly what I do with

44:24.800 --> 44:30.480
garbage bags. Till they're full to the brim, baby. It doesn't matter if they reek, right?

44:30.480 --> 44:32.480
Yeah. Hey, listen, let me burn some candles.

44:32.480 --> 44:37.040
I mean, that's why, like, I say all this stuff about the iPad Pro with, like, a lot of couching,

44:37.040 --> 44:43.200
because to me, like, I understand how much that money means. $1,200. And I didn't even get enough

44:43.200 --> 44:51.280
storage. But, because I got the 256 gig unit. But here's how I feel about the iPad Pro now.

44:52.080 --> 44:58.720
I'm not shitting you when I say, when I look back at the last 20 plus years of me building

44:58.720 --> 45:05.040
and buying computers, this is one of the best computers I have ever bought. And with that said,

45:05.040 --> 45:14.400
if I were to fill this iPad up, I will buy another iPad Pro. Because, in fact, I can already envision

45:14.400 --> 45:20.400
how multiple iPad Pros would make me more productive. I have never had a computer that

45:20.400 --> 45:25.600
has been so universally successful in how I use it for work, how I use it for pleasure,

45:25.600 --> 45:30.400
how my little daughter wants to use a computer, and how my fiance wants to use a computer.

45:30.400 --> 45:37.040
I have never had a machine that has been that successful across that range of work demands,

45:37.040 --> 45:46.720
while having outstanding battery life, mind-blowing performance, and USB-C universal charging. It,

45:46.720 --> 45:53.120
to me, is one of the best computers I have owned in the last 25 plus, maybe 30 years.

45:56.320 --> 45:58.000
I actually agree with everything you just said.

45:58.000 --> 46:02.800
Really? Even with all the limitations of iOS and Apple's ecosystem?

46:02.800 --> 46:06.080
I still don't think the limitations are really iOS. I mean, my file system complaint,

46:06.080 --> 46:11.280
I think you correctly shut down as being petty. That's my word that Chris did not call me petty.

46:11.280 --> 46:12.080
Please don't tweet.

46:13.280 --> 46:18.880
What about, okay, but what about the limitations of iOS? It's a thing like XMM points out. What

46:18.880 --> 46:21.200
about multiple fricking user accounts? iOS is-

46:21.200 --> 46:24.560
We're going to get there though, right? That's iOS 13. That's going back to your argument.

46:24.560 --> 46:29.040
The limitation that, the only thing that stops me from just calling up the Apple

46:29.040 --> 46:34.880
business rep like, yo, ship me a MacBook, is has app review found Jesus?

46:36.160 --> 46:41.200
If I come up with something really cool for iOS, and I spend the next

46:41.200 --> 46:48.080
N months developing it, and being a variable, of course, am I just going to get rejected?

46:49.680 --> 46:52.720
You know what I mean? Am I going to have another winter of no product launches?

46:52.720 --> 46:57.360
Yes. Unless they really figure it out. And I don't, I mean,

46:57.360 --> 47:02.160
Fairight, to be honest, really is impressive. It's an amazing, it's one of those unassuming

47:02.160 --> 47:08.160
applications when you launch it, it seems simple. It gets, I mean, it even says,

47:08.720 --> 47:15.200
it says, I recognize that you've hooked up the Zoom U22 USB audio interface. It has the full

47:15.200 --> 47:20.720
name of the device and everything. So that's, I mean, that's getting close.

47:20.720 --> 47:28.880
I am trying to figure out like Photoshop's coming to iPad,

47:30.560 --> 47:33.280
that app you're discussing for editing video and audio.

47:35.280 --> 47:41.040
What is it that Apple sees this device as? Because right now I see it as a case by case basis.

47:42.000 --> 47:44.880
They like Photoshop, so Photoshop goes in. They like media production,

47:44.880 --> 47:48.960
so media production is okay. But what if you want to do something a little crazier,

47:48.960 --> 47:52.560
right? Or not, I don't like the word crazy, but if you want to do something a little more

47:52.560 --> 47:59.920
engineering-y. Because this is the Windows RT dream, the trademark pending, come true.

48:00.800 --> 48:04.160
It really is. Like from the device, you know what, that A whatever processor is amazing.

48:05.280 --> 48:08.800
I mean, if you want, if you're really nerdy, go look at the Geekbench scores.

48:10.080 --> 48:15.520
I could buy a new MacBook Pro today and it would not be as powerful in most cases as this iPad Pro,

48:15.520 --> 48:19.280
unless I just spend like $3,000. It could do more though.

48:19.280 --> 48:25.040
It could do more. But as a software developer who has a lot of experience in Coco,

48:26.080 --> 48:30.240
I should really be able to capitalize on this, not to be a dirty capitalist.

48:30.240 --> 48:36.960
I know, I agree. But the fact that if I spend all hundreds of man hours working on this,

48:36.960 --> 48:40.560
my dogs are raging Android fans and they're really upset. I don't know if you can hear

48:40.560 --> 48:47.760
them in the background. If I spend months developing a iOS-specific pro-level engineering

48:47.760 --> 48:53.920
product, what assurance would I have that Apple doesn't turn around and just say, no?

48:58.160 --> 49:02.800
Let's say they say yes. What assurance do I have they don't just feature some competitor one day,

49:03.680 --> 49:07.760
or at the same time? The whole gatekeeper thing still rubs me.

49:07.760 --> 49:13.120
Yeah. Yeah. If it's a pro machine, we need to be able to load our own pro applications.

49:14.400 --> 49:18.080
I would think I should be able to write custom... Like Riffin is a product I sell

49:18.720 --> 49:23.360
that is not on any app store. You have to call me and you buy it.

49:23.360 --> 49:28.240
Or Jupyter Broadcasting is developing this automation system to encode, upload, publish,

49:28.240 --> 49:34.000
and distribute podcasts. That is a very custom piece of software. It's never going to be approved

49:34.000 --> 49:38.080
in the app store, but it would be great to be able to execute that stuff from the tablet,

49:38.080 --> 49:42.320
especially one that could encode audio and video super fast, like the iPad Pro.

49:42.320 --> 49:45.360
And they're never going to say okay to that. That's never going to get accepted.

49:47.680 --> 49:51.200
So it's not really pro. I would challenge, why do you need the app store?

49:51.200 --> 49:55.760
For these type of customers, why do you need the app?

49:55.760 --> 50:00.240
Right. They should have called it the iPad Plus, not the iPad Pro.

50:00.240 --> 50:06.720
It's not a professional machine. It is a pro consumer machine that is really, really kick ass

50:06.720 --> 50:13.040
at doing consumer workflows or basic, you know, mid-level management and up workflows.

50:13.040 --> 50:18.240
People that are making things and creating things, we have to use crazy shims like ISH,

50:18.240 --> 50:23.680
which is emulating an entire x86 stack and then running Alpine Linux on top of that.

50:23.680 --> 50:28.000
You know what? You know what? That's my tool of the week, ISH.

50:28.000 --> 50:32.080
That's my tool of the week, ISH, but it is insane the way that works.

50:32.080 --> 50:32.960
It's so good, man.

50:33.840 --> 50:37.120
But it's so messed up what those folks have to do to get that app to work.

50:37.120 --> 50:39.360
Yeah. It's one developer as far as I understand.

50:39.360 --> 50:40.720
It's one guy. Yeah, that's my understanding.

50:40.720 --> 50:44.480
One guy, and he's got a lot of plans. And I'm using it right now.

50:44.480 --> 50:46.480
And it's got a package manager. It's great.

50:47.440 --> 50:52.800
Well, you know what? They let ISH in. So again, you said no, but maybe I am dated.

50:52.800 --> 50:55.600
It's not from the app store. You got to get the test pilot.

50:55.600 --> 50:57.120
Oh, that's right. You got to be on test flight.

50:57.120 --> 50:58.720
Yeah, test flight. That's what it is. Test flight.

51:00.160 --> 51:03.920
Yeah. So we'll see. I think that's actually a bellwether.

51:03.920 --> 51:04.640
If ISH-

51:04.640 --> 51:08.480
Like if ISH is in the app store, then I think I'm just wrong.

51:08.480 --> 51:13.760
And, you know, I'm not even asserting that Apple's the problem here actually.

51:13.760 --> 51:15.600
I don't know. That's my concern.

51:15.600 --> 51:19.680
We'll see. Maybe people haven't tried. I doubt it. I doubt it. We'll see.

51:19.680 --> 51:32.080
Command lines, ISH, or God forbid, God forbid, Apple ship the BSD user subsystem for iOS

51:32.080 --> 51:34.480
that actually gives you access.

51:34.480 --> 51:37.520
Wait, wait, wait. Can we just summon Alan? Alan, let's go.

51:37.520 --> 51:42.240
I know, right? I mean, Apple could ship this. It doesn't need a whole x86 emulator.

51:42.240 --> 51:46.240
Apple could expose the user land, even in a contained environment.

51:46.240 --> 51:51.920
They could expose some of the user land utilities that are there on the iPad running natively in iOS.

51:51.920 --> 51:53.280
It's all there.

51:53.280 --> 51:56.880
The fact that you have to construct a virtual machine and then build a user land on top of it

51:56.880 --> 52:01.760
with a distribution that's built for containers is ridiculous and shouldn't exist.

52:01.760 --> 52:08.400
And Apple could just flick their fingers and create a subsystem for iOS,

52:08.400 --> 52:12.720
like Microsoft has for Windows and like Google is doing for Chrome right now.

52:12.720 --> 52:15.360
And if Apple wants to keep up with what their competitors are doing,

52:15.360 --> 52:18.560
they better take a look at this and they better take a look at ISH.

52:18.560 --> 52:21.760
And in their best interest, they better let this thing in the app store

52:21.760 --> 52:23.840
because otherwise they're going to get left behind.

52:23.840 --> 52:27.440
People want access to Bash. They want the command line.

52:28.720 --> 52:32.560
And it's there. Apple just doesn't give it to you right now.

52:32.560 --> 52:34.160
I'm going to abstract that out a little bit.

52:35.040 --> 52:39.200
You and I want Bash, right? And in some cases when I'm drunk, Z shell.

52:39.200 --> 52:42.560
Developers want, but developers want Bash.

52:42.560 --> 52:45.120
But people in general just want to get their job done.

52:45.120 --> 52:46.640
And they, you know, I got to be honest with you.

52:46.640 --> 52:49.520
Like we get some criticism on Reddit that I'm always talking about hardware.

52:50.480 --> 52:52.800
I am so tired of paving laptops.

52:52.800 --> 52:53.600
Hmm.

52:54.320 --> 52:56.160
Like this is a dumb problem to have.

52:56.160 --> 52:58.640
It is right. It's so exhausting.

52:58.640 --> 53:00.240
Like, you know, who's working for me?

53:00.240 --> 53:05.040
My very boring, very ugly Dell Optiplex tower that's sitting here, right?

53:05.040 --> 53:08.320
I hooked up a throttle and a trigger to it to make it a, uh,

53:08.320 --> 53:12.800
and put in a beefier graphics card. And it was my flight sim machine.

53:12.800 --> 53:18.000
Now I needed it as a desktop. So it has an L I booted it in its elementary partition.

53:18.000 --> 53:20.160
I needed more storage. I'm sorry.

53:20.160 --> 53:21.920
And people call me an old man on Twitter for this.

53:21.920 --> 53:28.480
You know what I did, Chris? I bought a terabyte, 720 RPM drive or 7,200 RPM drive.

53:28.480 --> 53:32.720
And I, and one of the many open days when I opened the case, by the way,

53:32.720 --> 53:37.120
Wait, wait, what you have, you have a physical drive that you're putting in your desktop.

53:37.120 --> 53:39.200
A physical drive that you're putting inside a machine.

53:39.760 --> 53:42.160
And it took me, and I had my two year old sitting next to me.

53:42.160 --> 53:44.800
I let him help me with that. I let him do one of the latches.

53:45.360 --> 53:50.080
It took like 10 minutes and it's shared between the Linux partition and the windows one.

53:50.080 --> 53:50.560
Yeah.

53:50.560 --> 53:55.600
And it just, it's like not, not to like troll Apple. It just works.

53:55.600 --> 53:58.640
And otherwise the hard drive was a hundred percent full.

53:58.640 --> 54:02.160
I was going to have to buy a new machine or do a crazy external thing, which I think is crazy.

54:02.160 --> 54:08.880
It doesn't have Thunderbolt. So like, I don't know, man. I'm tired of this crap.

54:08.880 --> 54:11.680
I'm tired of being like, I got a new laptop. Here's for a few,

54:11.680 --> 54:13.600
which is weird because next episode we have a laptop review.

54:14.400 --> 54:17.760
Yeah. I was just going to, so at the beginning of this, I was going to ask you

54:17.760 --> 54:23.280
if you had imaged or if you had started a new, but either way you go, it's pretty freaking

54:25.120 --> 54:29.440
easy for me to say it's really painless because you have all of the app store

54:29.440 --> 54:36.080
or restores. So you can restore any app you've ever bought. And if you're a LastPass user,

54:36.080 --> 54:41.760
the integration of LastPass and Face ID means that you can just pop into the app,

54:41.760 --> 54:46.640
go to the login screen, Face ID checks your face and it logs you into the application and Bob's

54:46.640 --> 54:53.200
your uncle, you're signed into the app. My point is the process to set up an iPad is 10 times faster

54:53.200 --> 54:58.400
than the process to set up a PC. In some of, in some respects is because I can do about 10 times

54:58.400 --> 55:04.080
less stuff, you know, but the stuff I can do, holy shit, man. I got that set up. So I got that iPad

55:04.080 --> 55:10.000
set up and good to go in two hours. It takes two days for a laptop for me. I got to fiddle through

55:10.000 --> 55:14.640
everything. Well, that's the thing. So let's say like, I want to jump on this iPad per opportunity

55:14.640 --> 55:18.560
and then we should wrap up because we have another recording. He's going to take, let's just say like,

55:18.560 --> 55:22.800
I got up tomorrow morning and like drove to the app store and bought a MacBook pro, right? It will

55:22.800 --> 55:30.640
take me because I have other things that I need to do at least, at least until the weekend to actually

55:30.640 --> 55:36.640
be up and running. Yeah. And yes, I'm finicky. And I got to spend at least an evening to get the

55:36.640 --> 55:42.880
basic stuff going though. Right. And evening, I got to get Dropbox, got to get all that stuff set up.

55:42.880 --> 55:48.720
You still run Dropbox. Yeah. Doesn't that eat your CPU on Linux? It's a long story. Don't get me

55:48.720 --> 55:55.680
going. Okay. We can save it for next week if you want. Yeah. Because I had it on my elementary

55:55.680 --> 56:00.880
partition here and then I was like, Oh, this is terrible. I just installed a library this morning.

56:00.880 --> 56:07.280
In fact, had to build it myself and then do the whole install process to trick Dropbox on a couple

56:07.280 --> 56:14.720
of my systems to use XFS because Dropbox has dropped support for everything, but extended

56:14.720 --> 56:21.520
for on Linux. And I use XFS because it's a better file system. So that's what I spent my morning

56:21.520 --> 56:27.600
doing that and being told I'm flying to Texas on Sunday night. So, all right, Mr. Dominic,

56:27.600 --> 56:32.000
well, I know we have much more to get into, including some cute follow-up and correction,

56:32.000 --> 56:37.760
some community feedback and some new laptop news. So tell people in the meantime where they can find

56:37.760 --> 56:42.960
you throughout the week and what you're doing. They can find me on Twitter at Dumanuco and at
