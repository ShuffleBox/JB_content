00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
This is Coder Radio, episode 301, for March 19th, two-thousand and eighteen.

00:30.000 --> 00:39.000
Hi everyone and welcome to Coder Radio, Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show, taking a pragmatic look at the art and business of software development and its related technologies.

00:39.000 --> 00:45.000
This episode is brought to you by our two great sponsors, DigitalOcean and Linux Academy.

00:45.000 --> 00:48.000
I'll tell you more about those great sponsors as this here show goes on.

00:48.000 --> 00:53.000
Why me? Thanks for asking. My name is Chris, but more importantly, our host.

00:53.000 --> 00:58.000
Why he's something special on the shores of Florida, it's Mr. Dominic.

00:58.000 --> 01:03.000
Hello, Mike. Welcome and Chris to the new era of Coder Radio.

01:03.000 --> 01:08.000
You always got to really come in hard on that intro, right?

01:08.000 --> 01:14.000
Like you just got to come in hard and make sure everybody's got their earphones adjusted to the proper volume.

01:14.000 --> 01:19.000
I have watched enough Vietnam movies to know you always go in hot.

01:19.000 --> 01:23.000
Yeah, that's true. That's true. And you know what? You stick to it. You are a consistent man.

01:23.000 --> 01:26.000
Well, it's good to be with you on the side of on the other side of 300.

01:26.000 --> 01:32.000
You know what? I feel like we were just doing this. I feel like we just did this like a couple of days.

01:32.000 --> 01:35.000
Well, St. Patrick's Day was a void. Actually, I have to say something.

01:35.000 --> 01:41.000
Oh, yeah, because I've noticed and I did not prep you for this. So this is another one of my curveballs.

01:41.000 --> 01:47.000
I have gained some sort of reputation for being a fan of the libations.

01:47.000 --> 01:50.000
I'm sorry. Could you be more specific?

01:50.000 --> 01:57.000
Gin, beer, scotch. If we listed them all, it would take too long.

01:57.000 --> 02:05.000
I spent this St. Patrick's Day completely sober because my poor wife got sick through not drinking,

02:05.000 --> 02:10.000
but through the evils that is having a son that doesn't let us sleep for 72 hours in a row.

02:10.000 --> 02:14.000
You got to be tactical with your drinking. And when when one of your offspring is sick,

02:14.000 --> 02:24.000
you've got to avoid bringing the body down because it gets you more vulnerable to their to their in general plague like their structure.

02:24.000 --> 02:32.000
I just eagle eyed listeners will know I've been drinking tea for the last month on the show because kids are basically plague rats.

02:32.000 --> 02:36.000
That's true. And I got three of them. So let me tell you right as you wrap up on the next.

02:36.000 --> 02:42.000
I don't know how you were alive. Like the oldest is sick again. You know, you can't start.

02:42.000 --> 02:46.000
They got to be sick. I have one and he's sick at least a week a month.

02:46.000 --> 02:50.000
It's it's amazing. Twenty five percent of the year this kid is sick.

02:50.000 --> 02:54.000
I don't remember being like this when I was in school. I don't remember getting sick that much, to be honest with you.

02:54.000 --> 02:58.000
Well, when you and I were kids in the Soviet Union, we weren't allowed to be sick.

02:58.000 --> 03:05.000
Right. Uncle Joe Stalin would kick our ass. Yeah, we had well, we had two things with the trains ran on time and everybody got their cough syrup.

03:05.000 --> 03:10.000
That was the two things. And everything was licensed under the GPL because we were communist.

03:10.000 --> 03:16.000
So we've got some some feedback emails that came in over at Coder dot show slash contact.

03:16.000 --> 03:23.000
And you've got I've got a problem. Yeah, you've got a you've got a thing like an airing that needs to happen right here towards the top of the show.

03:23.000 --> 03:27.000
So listeners know that I love system seventy six.

03:27.000 --> 03:32.000
You might be and I am super fan. Perhaps I am a super fan and I will full disclosure.

03:32.000 --> 03:40.000
I do have a small business arrangement with Ryan Sipes, formerly of System 76, going on right now, which has nothing to do with them.

03:40.000 --> 03:45.000
Everything to do with the mad botter. He's doing some PR for us.

03:45.000 --> 03:54.000
What I don't love is their new marketing tactic, because I had a plan and it was going to be a secret and it was going to be great, Chris.

03:54.000 --> 04:00.000
I was going to do a John Gruber detailed style review of Pop OS 1804.

04:00.000 --> 04:07.000
And then I got a notification in my Google notifications that Pop OS 1804 testing ISO.

04:07.000 --> 04:13.000
That's all I got. I looked. I'm searching for this ISO.

04:13.000 --> 04:20.000
Someone felt it would be a good idea to write a blog post that an ISO was coming, quote unquote, soon.

04:20.000 --> 04:25.000
Let me help you. Never do that. Give a date.

04:25.000 --> 04:30.000
Give a download or give nothing. And nothing is the best answer.

04:30.000 --> 04:36.000
I understand why you don't want to commit to a date. I am so annoyed by this blog post.

04:36.000 --> 04:40.000
It's unbelievable. So can you tell me what happened? Tell me what happened, brother?

04:40.000 --> 04:43.000
Because I'm not familiar with the blog post you're talking about.

04:43.000 --> 04:47.000
Oh, well, if you just go to blog, it's simply 76 is the current one.

04:47.000 --> 04:49.000
But we can we can find a link for the show notes later.

04:49.000 --> 04:59.000
Okay. My issue is that, like, I love their concept of a OS for creators, developers, IoT, roboticists, all that kind of thing.

04:59.000 --> 05:04.000
Right. I have been having people install Pop OS here at the Mad Botter.

05:04.000 --> 05:07.000
So I have I have two interests in this one.

05:07.000 --> 05:11.000
I want to make sure if there's any training curve that I can get ahead of that.

05:11.000 --> 05:15.000
Right. Since, you know, that's a productivity hit.

05:15.000 --> 05:22.000
And two, I think someone needs to do these in-depth reviews. And I figure, why not me?

05:22.000 --> 05:28.000
Given that, you know, system 76 Pop OS has gotten a sort of beige reception.

05:28.000 --> 05:36.000
I figure I'm more friendly. Let me do the review. And maybe that can be a good thing for the community.

05:36.000 --> 05:42.000
But like. I. It's hard, right?

05:42.000 --> 05:49.000
Like, we all love Ryan Sipes. I mean, you might want to punch him in the face. But it's just his face.

05:49.000 --> 05:56.000
I love you, Ryan. I mean, it could. I don't know that you don't want to.

05:56.000 --> 05:59.000
You know, that's that's good. Well, I mean, he does.

05:59.000 --> 06:05.000
He used to have a bad habit of dressing like a let's just say questionable magician.

06:05.000 --> 06:08.000
Oh, that's a long story.

06:08.000 --> 06:12.000
The new community manager who I hear is a nice guy I have never spoken to.

06:12.000 --> 06:17.000
I've met him on a couple of occasions, just actually while I was at scale, I had a couple of conversations with him.

06:17.000 --> 06:20.000
And I want to be fair because I don't like making these personal.

06:20.000 --> 06:25.000
Like, I don't always do like the blogging for the mad botter. Right. Sometimes other people do that.

06:25.000 --> 06:32.000
I always do my own blogging at Dominic M Dotcom. But it's not true that I do 100 percent of the mad botter's blogging.

06:32.000 --> 06:36.000
So maybe like the community manager doesn't. I don't know what the corporate structure is over there.

06:36.000 --> 06:41.000
Maybe they don't do it. But like sending a blog talking about an ISO that's, quote unquote,

06:41.000 --> 06:48.000
coming soon is like saying to your dog, I will feed you, quote unquote, soon TM.

06:48.000 --> 06:51.000
Wow. Wow. You are really fired up about this.

06:51.000 --> 06:58.000
I'm a little annoyed by this because it's obvious clickbait. And like I really.

06:58.000 --> 07:05.000
Controversy time, I feel like System 76 is the apple of the Linux community, or that's what they ought to be with all the positive.

07:05.000 --> 07:09.000
I'm talking like nineties, Apple, positive connotations, late nineties.

07:09.000 --> 07:16.000
So like, don't do really like scumbag marketing moves to get clicks.

07:16.000 --> 07:21.000
If you have an ISO, give it to me. If you don't have it, then don't. But don't talk about it.

07:21.000 --> 07:29.000
But isn't really isn't Papawes, I mean, isn't maybe Papawes more about branding and positioning System 76?

07:29.000 --> 07:37.000
It's a marketing thing. Yeah. Right. That. Listen, my hope is that Papawes.

07:37.000 --> 07:43.000
I have a dream, Chris, that one day I can just order machines from System 76 that are completely stable with Papawes.

07:43.000 --> 07:49.000
And I have nothing to think about. Right. That is, you know, what the customer service people can use and QA people can use them.

07:49.000 --> 07:55.000
And yeah, it's all good. Right. It's just it's just you open up out of the box and it's pretty much good to go.

07:55.000 --> 08:00.000
How is that different than, say, Ubuntu 1804 LTS, though?

08:00.000 --> 08:05.000
It's different because I'm talking about pre-installed, I mean. Oh, OK, OK, I see.

08:05.000 --> 08:11.000
Yeah. Yeah. So that's part of it is you want a vendor that supports it and you want somebody you can call up on the phone when you have a problem.

08:11.000 --> 08:21.000
That I can yell at. What I don't want is like this odd focus on marketing.

08:21.000 --> 08:26.000
Which why would you tell me an ISO is coming soon if not to hype and get clicks?

08:26.000 --> 08:31.000
Right. That is exactly why. One hundred percent. You could just give me an ISO.

08:31.000 --> 08:35.000
And I don't mean me personally. I mean everyone. Right. This isn't like Mike is mad.

08:35.000 --> 08:40.000
He didn't get on earlier this life. So this is Mike is mad because I thought they were better than this.

08:40.000 --> 08:44.000
And I feel bad because I've met them and I like Carl and I know all of them.

08:44.000 --> 08:48.000
But like if this is the direction you're taking your marketing, reevaluate.

08:48.000 --> 08:53.000
Well, I think you've got a good idea. And listen, Ryan was no shrinking violet.

08:53.000 --> 09:00.000
Right. Well, you know, I think I think your idea taking like a really detailed approach to the review.

09:00.000 --> 09:05.000
Well, John Gruber. Right. I want to I plan to do an Ars Technica style review.

09:05.000 --> 09:10.000
Yeah. What I don't want is for shit like this. So I get an ISO and they say, well, it's actually not done in six months.

09:10.000 --> 09:17.000
It's going to be different. Yeah. That's yeah. Yeah. You maybe you ought to talk to him about it and tell him, you know, this is what I'm thinking about doing.

09:17.000 --> 09:21.000
Yeah. But I'm from New Jersey and this was the meanest, most aggressive way I could.

09:21.000 --> 09:24.000
Sure. Sure. I mean, I might get their attention, but I mean, that might be a way to go about it.

09:24.000 --> 09:32.000
I am thinking about doing this. I wonder, too. I wonder. I wonder what the I wonder if there's a big difference in the experience on laptop versus desktop.

09:32.000 --> 09:41.000
I doubt it. But, you know, if it's going to be a serious distribution for getting work done, it could kind of use something like that to get people talking about it.

09:41.000 --> 09:44.000
So it's not a bad idea. No, I think it's good for everybody.

09:44.000 --> 09:54.000
I think what happened here is somebody did some really good, you know, blog post title SEO optimization.

09:54.000 --> 10:01.000
And adding this extraneous clause of the sentence was a was a good way to really juice the post.

10:01.000 --> 10:06.000
You know what? That's what happened when I when I when I get the treat bag out and I open it up and I grab one of those things out.

10:06.000 --> 10:10.000
And if I don't if the dog if I don't like reward the dogs like, well, what are you doing?

10:10.000 --> 10:15.000
He gives me a look like, come on, you know better than that to tease me like that. Come on.

10:15.000 --> 10:19.000
Angry dogs. Are you sure you were angry dogs?

10:19.000 --> 10:23.000
Let me know. All right. So we've got a couple of emails that came into the show.

10:23.000 --> 10:28.000
Let's start there. I did find that blog post. So I'll try to remember. I think I already closed it like a jerk.

10:28.000 --> 10:33.000
But I did. I did find if you just look for Google, you can go search for System 76 Pop.

10:33.000 --> 10:40.000
The first one comes in from Matthew, and he has a question about it's sort of an interesting way to look at this.

10:40.000 --> 10:46.000
What are your opinions about manufacturers hiding a slew of instructions inside their chipsets?

10:46.000 --> 10:52.000
I know after this, all this talk went viral with the recent exploits and, you know, things like Meltdown Inspector.

10:52.000 --> 10:57.000
It's just been a news wildfire. But it also shows how far back these unknown machine instructions have been existing.

10:57.000 --> 11:02.000
I'm curious on your opinion of manufacturers hiding their instructions and whether those should be documented.

11:02.000 --> 11:08.000
Another I'll just throw another example is the Intel management chips that are running their own operating system.

11:08.000 --> 11:12.000
Like they have a full fledged TCP IP stack and a kernel.

11:12.000 --> 11:16.000
And it's a full operating system that's running on these little management chips.

11:16.000 --> 11:19.000
And you have your baseband. Here's another example in your cell phone.

11:19.000 --> 11:24.000
A lot of people say that's essentially its own independent operating system.

11:24.000 --> 11:35.000
We even have adapters from Apple, right? Those lightning adapters that actually have like video conversion chips in the lightning plug.

11:35.000 --> 11:45.000
Like they've put a little teeny tiny ARM computer inside the lightning plug and it does a H.264 conversion out to analog video.

11:45.000 --> 11:50.000
It just it's remarkable where we have these things embedded now.

11:50.000 --> 11:56.000
I don't have strong thoughts on it because it's been this way, as he points out, since the 90s.

11:56.000 --> 11:59.000
It's not like it's totally new information.

11:59.000 --> 12:04.000
Wait a minute. People do bad things for profit. Was it bad, though? Holy shit, Chris.

12:04.000 --> 12:07.000
How else are you going to pull this off? In this case, it's pretty bad.

12:07.000 --> 12:13.000
Yeah, I mean, it has it has led to a lot of the thing that the thing to do it responsibly would have been.

12:13.000 --> 12:17.000
You don't ship it until you have a way to update it and keep it secure.

12:17.000 --> 12:23.000
But I'm sorry, I got confused. We're talking about processor instructions or Android. Oh, oh, oh, shoot. There we go.

12:23.000 --> 12:31.000
So Aaron writes in. Just wanted to say I love the updates to the show, specifically the chapter markers, which makes it easy to use in podcast.

12:31.000 --> 12:38.000
Yeah, we've got a few people. So they're loving that. Mike, I work for a small dev shop in Boulder, Colorado, probably not unlike your company.

12:38.000 --> 12:46.000
In the past, many shows you've been concisely describing a number of ideas that I've had rolling around in my head that I haven't been able to articulate very well.

12:46.000 --> 12:53.000
Myself, he goes on to say, whether it be testing, staffing, serverless, Macbook Pros, etc.

12:53.000 --> 12:59.000
I think you've been spot on. It's been fun to get some clarity on the ideas I've been wrestling with.

12:59.000 --> 13:03.000
Cheers, longtime listener of Koda Radio and Jupiter Broadcasting in general.

13:03.000 --> 13:07.000
Well, thank you, Aaron. It's nice to hear from somebody this fabulous email.

13:07.000 --> 13:11.000
So I love it. Speaking of the hardware, can we do a little hardware update?

13:11.000 --> 13:16.000
And I saw this weekend that you tweeted out you were doing some sort of firmware update to your Galago Pro.

13:16.000 --> 13:19.000
We probably should have included this earlier. But how did that go?

13:19.000 --> 13:29.000
Did that solve your power and fan problems? Because we had a couple of people write in that were curious if the battery life improved and your fans were less loud, I guess.

13:29.000 --> 13:44.000
So the note in the firmware update for this one was that it would improve the battery discharge issue, which I think is a diplomatic way to say the battery life might suck a little less.

13:44.000 --> 13:51.000
I don't honestly know if that's true because I just did it on Sunday or Saturday and it's currently Monday.

13:51.000 --> 14:01.000
Right. And I mostly run in, you know, plugged in with hook to a monitor. I will say that I think the fan spins up less, which I've done.

14:01.000 --> 14:10.000
This is the third firmware update on the Galago. And each time the fan has gotten progressively less aggressive, I don't know exactly what that means.

14:10.000 --> 14:21.000
I'm worried they may just be throttling the CPU to do that. But I have no proof of that. And I am still relatively happy with my Galago Pro.

14:21.000 --> 14:26.000
I do need more battery life to make it a effective travel laptop.

14:26.000 --> 14:30.000
Yeah, that limbo continues, I know.

14:30.000 --> 14:40.000
Yes, sir. Yeah. You know what? Let's talk about Linux Academy for a moment. If you've been limbo for a little bit, consider Linux Academy. This could be your next step. LinuxAcademy.com slash coders.

It's everything from the ground up to the cloud services down to the tools that run the operating system.

15:11.000 --> 15:17.000
I love the fact that they have instructor mentoring too. This really shows you that Linux Academy puts this stuff first.

15:17.000 --> 15:27.000
It's not one of the things they do, it's what they do. Linux Academy hires full time instructors, real humans that are happy to advise and answer questions.

And of course, they have courses created specifically to prepare you to go take the certification exams as well as in-depth nuggets is what they call them in-depth courses.

15:52.000 --> 15:56.000
They call them nuggets on specific topics. So you've got an hour to learn something tonight.

15:56.000 --> 16:04.000
You can just do a nugget or you go down the deep courseware and they'll help itemize it all out, break it out into hours, tell you how long it's going to take.

16:04.000 --> 16:16.000
It really helps me wrap my head around it all. LinuxAcademy.com slash coders as well as study guides and downloadable comprehensive resources and lesson audio, iOS and Android apps and their course scheduler.

And a big thank you to Linux Academy for sponsoring the Coder Radio program, LinuxAcademy.com slash coders. Mike, I slipped this one into the show notes right before you connected.

16:37.000 --> 16:43.000
There's two big announcements this week that happened about five hours ago as we record this episode.

16:43.000 --> 16:53.000
The first one is they're both around gaming, which we don't talk a lot about, and they're not games themselves, but the back end services for game developers to use.

16:53.000 --> 17:02.000
Amazon has a new API that they're announcing called Game On and it helps developers add like e-sport competitions and rallies and leaderboards to their application.

17:02.000 --> 17:07.000
They provide all the back end infrastructure, but it's got a really unique Amazon twist on it.

17:07.000 --> 17:18.000
So picture it. It's Sicily 1983 and you're working on the next big app and you want something like a race feature or whatever and you use Amazon's back end infrastructure for it because it's powered by AWS.

17:18.000 --> 17:27.000
So you know it's going to be pretty solid. But fittingly for Amazon, there's also a product fulfillment aspect to the new API.

17:27.000 --> 17:37.000
So competition organizers like developers or people that are running the games can offer up real world prizes to players, assuming it's available on Amazon.com.

17:37.000 --> 17:42.000
And then Amazon will handle the process of getting it to the winner.

17:42.000 --> 17:56.000
So the developers don't have to deal with any of that intermediary stuff. So say you want to send somebody gaming goggles or a new gaming keyboard as an award for maybe being the champion for a weekend tournament.

17:56.000 --> 18:08.000
You just now will just be able to present the winner with a box. They tap that, the window opens up to the Amazon page, they log into their Amazon account, click the next box to accept the prize and they're done.

18:08.000 --> 18:19.000
The prize is on its way. The developer never had to touch any of that. Competitions as far as the API go could be open to all. They can be locked down on a regional basis, even tightly GPS restricted.

18:19.000 --> 18:29.000
Game On is of course built on top of AWS. It's designed to work cross platform. As long as your game is available to make API calls to the internet, you can use it.

18:29.000 --> 18:36.000
It'd be at mobile, console, desktop. It should all work just fine, Amazon says. And they've tested it with some games already.

18:36.000 --> 18:45.000
Now at the same time, Mike, check this out. Facebook also making a play three hours ago. Three hours ago, just a little bit after Amazon's announcement.

18:45.000 --> 18:56.000
Facebook announces that they are going to integrate an API into games for developers that will allow them to live broadcast their game into the Facebook newsfeed.

18:56.000 --> 19:09.000
And Facebook will also offer a reward system to reward fans who watch by providing in-game items or bonuses. And Facebook is positioning this as a potential to let your video streams have viral growth.

19:09.000 --> 19:16.000
And perhaps sell more copies of the game when you see it in your Facebook newsfeed. You can have a little link to the game in there.

19:16.000 --> 19:27.000
Facebook is going to provide an SDK to make all of this work. It'll be one click broadcast for the gamer. And then on the newsfeed, it will have the game. It'll be somebody that you know.

19:27.000 --> 19:37.000
And it'll also have a little link to buy that game. And then you can also have in-game rewards that are rewarded via Facebook. How about that?

19:37.000 --> 19:47.000
Oh crap, it's Godzilla versus Mothma. I mean, isn't it interesting that just within hours of each other, they announced these big SDKs and APIs and all of this for video games?

19:47.000 --> 19:50.000
And it's both of them are targeted at desktops or mobile.

19:50.000 --> 19:59.000
You know, as I was muted and you were reading about Facebook having this too, all that came into my head was the 90s Mortal Kombat movie. The kid screaming, Mortal Kombat!

19:59.000 --> 20:07.000
I could see Zuck and Bezos, although I think Bezos is going to take him apart. Oh, never mind.

20:07.000 --> 20:11.000
Yeah, you know what? I know what you mean. Let's talk about that. Let's talk about David versus Goliath.

20:11.000 --> 20:26.000
And I was wondering, did you pick this topic because of my yet-announced situation? Or is this unrelated to the situation that I talked about you privately with on Slack?

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
I don't remember what that situation is.

20:28.000 --> 20:32.000
Well, there's going to be changes here at Jupiter Broadcasting very soon.

20:32.000 --> 20:40.000
And it sort of puts JB at this precipice where I decide, do I want to be a company with lots of employees and be large by lots?

20:40.000 --> 20:51.000
In my definition, it would be like 15. Or do I want to be a small, lean one or two person shop that stays small on purpose?

20:51.000 --> 20:54.000
Yeah, so I completely was thinking of myself.

20:54.000 --> 21:00.000
Would you like to discuss the JB thing?

21:00.000 --> 21:06.000
I'll just say this. We're going to make a formal announcement soon.

21:06.000 --> 21:20.000
But Rekai gave his notice at the beginning of the month that at the end of the month he would be quitting to do Twitch streaming full-time, which you can find at Rek.net if you want to follow him.

21:20.000 --> 21:24.000
And so we've been transitioning for the last few weeks.

21:24.000 --> 21:33.000
And episode 300 happened to fall during this transition, so it got lots of nice new podcast features because it came right during the cycle of cleaning house on the back end.

21:33.000 --> 21:36.000
And so we've been preparing for this for a few weeks.

21:36.000 --> 21:43.000
I don't want to take too much thunder away from him because he's going to come on user error, Linux unplugged or something, and we'll do a proper going away.

21:43.000 --> 21:56.000
But it's it has it's sort of been good for me in a way because when I have employees, then it's sort of predetermined that I'm going to be a shop that at least has employees.

21:56.000 --> 22:03.000
Maybe have several employees, has some producers, has all these people, you know, editors like that's the size of the company.

22:03.000 --> 22:11.000
But I have found that to be restrictive in some ways and prevents me from making certain decisions.

22:11.000 --> 22:21.000
So I've also fantasized about having just a small operation that still has some scale, still has contractors working with us, a couple of people behind the scenes.

22:21.000 --> 22:32.000
But, you know, is tight and nimble and is sustainable, sustainable in a way that doesn't exhaust me and in a way that doesn't crush me with cost.

22:32.000 --> 22:41.000
And I've been stuck at this precipice of how do I accomplish that when I have NPRS out there now that are producing pretty great stuff?

22:41.000 --> 22:45.000
Red Hat. I'm not sure I love the show, but now Red Hat's in the business of making podcasts.

22:45.000 --> 22:55.000
Like this is starting to become an area where people can just have like The New York Times has a daily news show and they have 15 people working on just that one show.

22:55.000 --> 23:06.000
Just one show has 15 people, one guy to go get quotes, one gal to go get music, one person to do research like it's just 15 people for that one show.

23:06.000 --> 23:18.000
And I'm talking about doing eight shows a week, seven or eight shows a week with really one or two people behind the scenes having worked with our, you know, working with our hosts and working with our contract producers and stuff.

23:18.000 --> 23:34.000
But I'm trying to decide, can I be a small, high quality shop that is proud of what it produces that can remain competitive with the large podcast networks that are now are now setting up because they have a they have a presence in traditional broadcast?

23:34.000 --> 23:41.000
It's like this. It's a it's a huge type of competition because fundamentally we're all competing for people's time.

23:41.000 --> 23:45.000
People only have so much time in the week to listen to podcasts.

23:45.000 --> 23:54.000
Right. Right. So. So it is funny. We are really on a parallel road here, right? I put in our doc today as a potential title being David, right?

23:54.000 --> 23:59.000
And I put the segment as staying small, David Veig alive. I have been on a similar journey.

23:59.000 --> 24:10.000
I think we've hinted this in the show, right? Where, you know, my business has gone through its ups and its downs and its downs and its ups.

24:10.000 --> 24:23.000
And. Most of that was some mistakes on my part, but like as the mobile market matured, bigger players got into the game, right?

24:23.000 --> 24:34.000
And, you know, I talked about on 300, which was just Thursday now, about when I first opened up the first time it was me and two other companies.

24:34.000 --> 24:40.000
I'm using, in quotes, little LLCs or S Corps in New Jersey that were the mobile developers, right?

24:40.000 --> 24:48.000
That looked very much like me in terms of like capital, none structure process, you know, all of that stuff.

24:48.000 --> 24:56.000
In fact, the reason I wrote the show notes the way I did today was. Over time.

24:56.000 --> 25:05.000
You know, I think we've talked a lot about this a lot for me on the show where I've had to compete with.

25:05.000 --> 25:10.000
Competition that I don't understand, right?

25:10.000 --> 25:20.000
Like the Goliaths to my David, so the big marketing companies who decided they were just going to throw money at the mobile problem and mobile development would be a loss leader for them, right?

25:20.000 --> 25:24.000
Because they're really selling ad services and ad buys and all that stuff.

25:24.000 --> 25:28.000
But yeah, boy, that's true for my industry, too, with some of these large podcasts.

25:28.000 --> 25:38.000
Right. Or, you know, I don't mean to exclude one nationality, but frankly, Indian companies who if I say ten dollars, they say five.

25:38.000 --> 25:49.000
Right. They can basically do a project at less than my cost because I have one of my core values is I only hire US people.

25:49.000 --> 25:59.000
And that's for practical but also non practical reasons, too. Right. So it puts me in a position of always fighting the bigger man.

25:59.000 --> 26:05.000
And then and then there's the other side of it where, you know, the ThoughtBots of the world do in some level compete with me.

26:05.000 --> 26:11.000
But for me to win, the client must not be able to afford ThoughtBot.

26:11.000 --> 26:21.000
Right. That's that's the answer. It is. I cannot. I've been doing this for 10 years. I can't think of a case where I beat them.

26:21.000 --> 26:30.000
And they're more expensive. Right. So I and for good reason, I mean, not that we do bad work, but they're bigger.

26:30.000 --> 26:34.000
Right. And they're the Goliath to my David. And I don't mean to single them out because there's lots of Goliaths.

26:34.000 --> 26:41.000
Right. There's hell. There's pivotal. There's hell. McKinsey and Company is starting a consulting tech wing.

26:41.000 --> 26:52.000
Right. Which is a goddamn nightmare to me. PwC has one, too. Like I. All right, can I just open the kimono here to do it?

26:52.000 --> 26:59.000
This is always bad for me, but good for the show. OK. Last night, me and my my man, Dave, who's you know,

26:59.000 --> 27:08.000
my CTO, got into a conversation around 10 at night about, you know, we have this role open.

27:08.000 --> 27:16.000
We call the customer champion. It is a blend between a QA engineer and an account rep.

27:16.000 --> 27:22.000
OK. And we have tried to hire for this role a number of times over the years.

27:22.000 --> 27:30.000
And we've always found that the minute we hire a salesperson or a support person, anyone who's not like a direct billable,

27:30.000 --> 27:38.000
like we don't have to tell the client it's not a developer. Trigger some sort of downturn.

27:38.000 --> 27:46.000
On the other hand, we have what do you mean by some client triggers a downturn, triggers a downturn in your company?

27:46.000 --> 27:52.000
Well, I see we're very we're like Jupiter Broadcast. We're a very small business. We are a cash operation.

27:52.000 --> 27:56.000
So what happens is we have no line of credit, no access to capital.

27:56.000 --> 28:03.000
If there should be a difference between an invoice or more importantly, the cost on a project versus the revenue.

28:03.000 --> 28:13.000
Right. Sure. So. I want to be careful how I phrase this.

28:13.000 --> 28:21.000
We have been. OK, originally I had a very.

28:21.000 --> 28:30.000
Traditional agency mindset, right? I had a room of customer service people way back when,

28:30.000 --> 28:39.000
even before we did the show, which, you know, according to the people who email us is when the dinosaurs run.

28:39.000 --> 28:44.000
And we were very customer support heavy, which.

28:44.000 --> 28:48.000
Because of things that happened that you can look at, Dominic, I'm not coming to the archives.

28:48.000 --> 28:53.000
I decided it was actually like the wrong focus. We ought to be.

28:53.000 --> 28:59.000
You know, this is the fundamental thing, like I always cringe when I say digital agency because.

28:59.000 --> 29:06.000
I fucking hate those guys. I'm sorry, but like. I just can't stand them.

29:06.000 --> 29:10.000
Because I'm not in the same business of them. We're an engineering company.

29:10.000 --> 29:14.000
And the problem is people want to pay us as though we were a digital agency.

29:14.000 --> 29:18.000
Right. And like we even made a product for digital agencies.

29:18.000 --> 29:25.000
But. I have a lot of empathy for them. But being a digital agency sucks.

29:25.000 --> 29:34.000
Yeah, I mean, they make no money and I'm using the word they because really most of my revenue comes from pure engineering work now.

29:34.000 --> 29:39.000
All the like agent, all the agency stuff we just don't do right.

29:39.000 --> 29:50.000
We don't do apps or optimization. We don't do SEO. We don't do, you know, any of the aftermarket services one might expect because they're just not profitable.

29:50.000 --> 30:03.000
And, you know, I made the decision in 2015 that that entrepreneurial, that consumer facing business was just awful for us.

30:03.000 --> 30:11.000
And I made that decision based on a CPA writing up, you know, a three year audit saying, hey, you've made no money on all these projects.

30:11.000 --> 30:14.000
And it's these few enterprise projects that actually carried you through. Right.

30:14.000 --> 30:19.000
So it's not a business I want to be in.

30:19.000 --> 30:27.000
The problem is to be a pure engineering company we have found or I have found.

30:27.000 --> 30:36.000
Is really hard when you're a team of, you know, right now we're down to four people, but let's say four to 10 people.

30:36.000 --> 30:43.000
Because people don't see you that way. Right.

30:43.000 --> 30:47.000
And you get into strange situations like I don't even know what angle you want to take.

30:47.000 --> 30:51.000
I know I have a bunch of stuff in the notes, but like, let me take the simplest angle.

30:51.000 --> 30:57.000
Let's say big dev shop in Boston gets a lead and we get the lead.

30:57.000 --> 31:05.000
We lose every time because they can afford to have an engineer be the salesperson on that job.

31:05.000 --> 31:11.000
We simply can't afford that. Right. Like our margins are not such that that can happen.

31:11.000 --> 31:15.000
So what happens is I'm the sales guy, but I have other commitments.

31:15.000 --> 31:18.000
I myself am on a staff log job. Right.

31:18.000 --> 31:28.000
There is a ton of. There's a ton of disadvantages to being David in this equation.

31:28.000 --> 31:31.000
Yeah. And I'll let you interject here if you have any parallels.

31:31.000 --> 31:41.000
So one of the things that I've reflected on is I think you have to stay super nimble in a way that small businesses have never had to really wrap their head around.

31:41.000 --> 31:48.000
There is a way of doing business on the Internet that is way faster paced than any sort of traditional brick and mortar business.

31:48.000 --> 31:53.000
It sounds cliche to say it, but until you live it, you can't even really visualize it.

31:53.000 --> 31:58.000
Your entire business sometimes can have to change on a day.

31:58.000 --> 32:05.000
And the more structure you have around a business, the slower it turns.

32:05.000 --> 32:23.000
And that's definitely that's definitely become the case for my business is it went from something that wasn't really all that important in terms of like my income or how it impacts my day to day and didn't have very many people dependent on it for their income or how it impacted their day to day.

32:23.000 --> 32:28.000
And, you know, you could you could really yank the wheel and just go a totally different route.

32:28.000 --> 32:33.000
No more Linux action show. We're doing the computer action show. And oh, that was horrible.

32:33.000 --> 32:49.000
OK, we're doing the Linux action show again. And you can you can make these crazy kind of just over the top decisions that allow you to sort of really stay nimble and try something and experiment in the market and then even maybe fail a bit without significant ramifications.

32:49.000 --> 32:54.000
As the business becomes more key to my income, now it's my sole source of income.

32:54.000 --> 33:03.000
And there's several people who work for us where it's their sole source of income. It is way less appropriate to take risks like that.

33:03.000 --> 33:11.000
It also means it's harder to implement new things or shift direction because you have certain things that are the way you make money.

33:11.000 --> 33:21.000
You know, you certain shows are the shows that make money. And so there's that's where the attention, the time, the focus, the resources goes, just like certain development projects with certain clients are the ones that actually pay the bills.

33:21.000 --> 33:29.000
And so that's by its very nature, because the business must survive where the majority of the blood flows.

33:29.000 --> 33:34.000
And so when I've been looking at when I've been looking at, well, do I want to replace him with another employee?

33:34.000 --> 33:40.000
Do I want to you know, do I maybe want to reduce in other places like to be honest, it's appealing to me.

33:40.000 --> 33:46.000
It's appealing to me because it just needs to be it doesn't have to be a huge podcasting enterprise.

33:46.000 --> 33:51.000
It doesn't have to be what people usually casually call a lifestyle business where I can just live right now.

33:51.000 --> 33:58.000
Right. So. So, yes. So like this is this is exactly the line of thinking we ended up on last night.

33:58.000 --> 34:03.000
The gentleman's name is Dave. If you listen to show, you know about Dave.

34:03.000 --> 34:10.000
So like, what does it mean? So you hit my point, too, right? What does it mean to be small and stay small?

34:10.000 --> 34:15.000
And you said it, right? It's a lifestyle business. It's being big enough to do the job correctly.

34:15.000 --> 34:24.000
But not that you can't respond or move. Well, so I think a problem is.

34:24.000 --> 34:33.000
You know, we have partners that want us to grow. But no one's willing to.

34:33.000 --> 34:39.000
Growth is actually dangerous. Right. And a lot of I'm curious if you feel this, too.

34:39.000 --> 34:45.000
Right. As a business owner, like growth is where the business owner takes on risk.

34:45.000 --> 34:51.000
Every time we've grown has when I have been at my most exposed, my most at risk because you end up not being able.

34:51.000 --> 35:01.000
Maybe it's different in podcasting, but I know for dev shops like, you know, we can't say no to this questionable deal.

35:01.000 --> 35:05.000
We have to take it because we just hired three people. You know, I know that definitely does happen.

35:05.000 --> 35:15.000
A podcaster that I know is currently running ads that he swore he would never, ever, ever do because like they crossed a certain line.

35:15.000 --> 35:20.000
And he's doing them now because he just hired more people. Exact same thing.

35:20.000 --> 35:23.000
Yeah, it's been in my back. It's been the background of my thought process.

35:23.000 --> 35:27.000
I have to say, right. ATP running like BlackRock was quite interesting. Yeah.

35:27.000 --> 35:37.000
Or BlackRock rather like it's and I love ATP. I'm not trying to criticize Marco, although I've done it in the past. It's.

35:37.000 --> 35:43.000
Scale is in a way a curse, I think. Hmm. Yeah.

35:43.000 --> 35:54.000
You know, I have this commitment to like having people on payroll and that is very expensive when you don't have financing options because they have to get paid over two weeks.

35:54.000 --> 35:58.000
Yes. Come what may. Right. Client stiffs you.

35:58.000 --> 36:04.000
I have one client who pays us when he feels like it. And I just have to like account for that or fire him as a client.

36:04.000 --> 36:10.000
Right. Like this is this is just not a good way to be.

36:10.000 --> 36:17.000
And, you know, you're dealing with all these Goliaths, these I'm sure in your case, right. Twits relay.

36:17.000 --> 36:21.000
Right. I'm sure, you know, I don't I don't think really is really bigger than you.

36:21.000 --> 36:25.000
But Twit is definitely bigger than you. NPR, Wall Street Journal.

36:25.000 --> 36:34.000
I have ThoughtBot pivotal. And, you know, it's really mostly ThoughtBot, though, that keeps me up at night, to be completely honest with you.

36:34.000 --> 36:41.000
So I have a choice. Right. I think you are David. I'm David. Look, I am. I'm a little Jewish guy right here. Here's a giant.

36:41.000 --> 36:50.000
What do I do with Goliath in front of me? Do I a follow the Bible, take my slingshot out and take a shot at him?

36:50.000 --> 36:56.000
Do I be avoid him? Do I run away? Right. Running is an option.

36:56.000 --> 37:02.000
Or do I try to make a deal with Goliath? Right. Can you can you partner with Goliath?

37:02.000 --> 37:06.000
And I think this is a great place for an ad. All right. That's a good question.

37:06.000 --> 37:12.000
Can you? Wow. Hmm. All right. I'm going to think about that while I tell you about our friends over at Digital Ocean.

37:12.000 --> 37:21.000
Go to actually, no, don't I mean do but go to this URL, do.co slash coder for a limited time. You can sign up with a hundred dollar credit at Digital Ocean.

37:21.000 --> 37:25.000
You can really rock that. So go to do.co slash coder to get that.

37:25.000 --> 37:28.000
It's simplicity at scale. They have wicked fast infrastructure.

37:28.000 --> 37:40.000
Everything is SSD based from the three cents an hour rig, which I love or the five dollar a month rig all the way up to the ones that have hundreds of gigs of RAM or massive, massive disk or their spaces,

37:40.000 --> 37:45.000
which is amazing or block storage. Also great. Also SSDs.

37:45.000 --> 37:50.000
And you can get started less than 55 seconds. They have data centers all over the world.

37:50.000 --> 37:54.000
They get out of your way so you can just start building and deploy applications.

37:54.000 --> 38:06.000
And if you want to deploy something that's completely built, like with an Ubuntu LTS base or a CentOS or Debian base and a Docker container and all of the things you need between done, they have lots of great choices for that.

38:06.000 --> 38:11.000
And if you want to build it yourself, even using free BSD, if you like, you can also do that.

38:11.000 --> 38:18.000
Just start by going to do.co slash coder. And now Digital Ocean is rolling out flexible droplets for fifteen dollars a month.

38:18.000 --> 38:24.000
You can mix and match resources depending on what your application needs.

38:24.000 --> 38:36.000
Love that. do.co slash coder to take advantage of that. And once you go there, check out some of the great free open source tools that have been built around the Digital Ocean API.

38:36.000 --> 38:39.000
So that's what happens. You know, when Digital Ocean rolls out features, it's all in the API.

38:39.000 --> 38:46.000
It's all clearly documented, easy to understand. So you have a great community of builders that are creating applications around it.

38:46.000 --> 38:50.000
This one I thought was particularly great if you wanted to speed up a WordPress site.

38:50.000 --> 39:00.000
Digital Ocean Spacesync. This is a WordPress plugin that will sync your media library in WordPress to a Digital Ocean Spaces container to really speed it up.

39:00.000 --> 39:05.000
To make that page load faster, to help with your Google page rank. This is a great way to go.

39:05.000 --> 39:12.000
It's a free plugin built around the Digital Ocean API. digitalocean.com. do.co slash coder.

39:12.000 --> 39:18.000
And a big thank you to Digital Ocean for sponsoring the Coder Radio program. do.co slash coder.

39:18.000 --> 39:23.000
Hey, you know, before we go on too, should we just do a one quick plug skis?

39:23.000 --> 39:32.000
We have the Coder Radio 300 swag and merch. teespring.com slash coder 300 for the t-shirt or the hoodie in multiple colors.

39:32.000 --> 39:38.000
Man, that hoodie is like, oh man, look at that blue. That is a handsome looking hoodie.

39:38.000 --> 39:45.000
That 300 logo really pops on there. And of course the t-shirt, it is getting warmer out sooner, so maybe go grab yourself a t-shirt.

39:45.000 --> 39:52.000
We've also got the Coder coasters, which people are loving. You can get them for $1.50 a coaster.

39:52.000 --> 39:56.000
And I think they come in like six packs. Go grab a few. These will be going on for a little bit.

39:56.000 --> 40:01.000
We'll have links in the show notes because it's a Zazzle URL. I have some right here. Love them.

40:01.000 --> 40:06.000
Coder coasters. And then one, don't we have, oh yeah, the poster. We have the poster too.

40:06.000 --> 40:10.000
The poster. I was going to say, Anshu sent me the poster. That is a fine looking poster, Chris.

40:10.000 --> 40:12.000
Oh, you got it. You got the poster?

40:12.000 --> 40:16.000
Well, she just sent it to me, but she sent me a proof of it first.

40:16.000 --> 40:21.000
Yes, I have seen it and it is a great poster. I love it. So we'll have links to all that.

40:21.000 --> 40:26.000
The shirt, the hoodie, the coaster, and the poster in the show notes to celebrate 300.

40:26.000 --> 40:29.000
Now we're on the other side of it. We're on 301.

40:29.000 --> 40:31.000
Doesn't it feel weird?

40:31.000 --> 40:35.000
So can you team up with Goliath? Is that a thing you can actually do? Is that even an option?

40:35.000 --> 40:37.000
I didn't think that was actually a possibility.

40:37.000 --> 40:43.000
So I have been facing Goliaths of a varied sort, right? And I do apologize to Thoughtbot because I keep using them.

40:43.000 --> 40:49.000
But the reason I use them as an example is they're well known. And frankly, there's nothing I can do that would hurt them.

40:49.000 --> 40:57.000
So competing with them was basically suicide because going toe to toe with Thoughtbot on Rails Development

40:57.000 --> 41:02.000
was like going toe to toe with Evander Holyfield on, you know, fast maneuverable boxing.

41:02.000 --> 41:04.000
Wasn't good.

41:04.000 --> 41:06.000
Not a good idea.

41:06.000 --> 41:11.000
The only thing I had was price, right? Like competing on them at price was a different ballgame.

41:11.000 --> 41:18.000
Or location right there in Boston. At the time, they had no New York office. Then they had a New York office, and that was less good.

41:18.000 --> 41:22.000
Avoidance. You can avoid Goliath. You absolutely can.

41:22.000 --> 41:28.000
Let's take, again, I'm using myself as an example, but we can use Chris in a second, just to be fair.

41:28.000 --> 41:31.000
I could just simply not sell Rails services.

41:31.000 --> 41:37.000
Thoughtbot doesn't do much beyond that. They do a little bit of mobile, but they insist on native, so I could do cross-platform.

41:37.000 --> 41:41.000
These are all, if you've listened to the show for a long time, you'll notice these are all things I've done.

41:41.000 --> 41:50.000
Chris has a, I don't want to put words in your mouth, but is it fair to say that you have a Linux focus, which like Twit doesn't?

41:50.000 --> 41:52.000
Yeah, absolutely. Yeah.

41:52.000 --> 41:59.000
Right. So like I feel this show being super Mac focused is not beneficial, even though we were first, by the way.

41:59.000 --> 42:05.000
It does not help us, because the Mac people got wise, and they stepped up to the plate.

42:05.000 --> 42:07.000
They got plenty of shows. Plenty of shows.

42:07.000 --> 42:12.000
You know, I listen to a lot of them. They all agree with each other.

42:12.000 --> 42:14.000
They're just the same show over and over.

42:14.000 --> 42:18.000
Yeah, I've been unsubscribing like a champion, because it's getting –

42:18.000 --> 42:25.000
Like, I don't understand how – this is a side note. How could there be this much consensus in the Mac community?

42:25.000 --> 42:33.000
Because like I use a Mac quite frequently, and I can tell you there are things that are not good, guys, and it's not just the keyboard.

42:33.000 --> 42:35.000
I know we all agree the keyboard's crap.

42:35.000 --> 42:45.000
There's like a lot of communities, my response to that is they have a very, very active discussion within a narrow spectrum of the overall available conversation.

42:45.000 --> 42:48.000
Right. Like let's just take the top of the show.

42:48.000 --> 42:52.000
I have been accused in the past of being a System76 fanboy, and you know what? I am.

42:52.000 --> 42:56.000
I like what they're doing. I like the people. I think they're good people doing good work.

42:56.000 --> 43:01.000
But I – you know, they send me review units. They ask me to come to Superfan.

43:01.000 --> 43:06.000
Fine, they think I should – you know, they see me as more of a press person than I think I am.

43:06.000 --> 43:08.000
But then I'm going to tell the truth of what I actually think, right?

43:08.000 --> 43:11.000
I feel no loyalty to like lie to them.

43:11.000 --> 43:18.000
In fact, I would argue that like if you are an Apple fan or a Dell fan or a System76 fan, and you're just like sugarcoating stuff,

43:18.000 --> 43:25.000
and you're afraid to say what is what you think or the truth on a platform, then you are actually disservicing them, right?

43:25.000 --> 43:30.000
Criticism is good, right? Like I do read the comments. I ignore the trolly ones.

43:30.000 --> 43:35.000
But like, you know what? I think I should get a shield for my sound quality for the show, right?

43:35.000 --> 43:39.000
Like don't you feel that way, Chris? Like valid criticism is actually a favor.

43:39.000 --> 43:41.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah. So I agree.

43:41.000 --> 43:43.000
And healthy. It's healthy for an ecosystem.

43:43.000 --> 43:48.000
Yeah, yep. I was just – you know, I'm getting to the end of season one for Tech Talk today.

43:48.000 --> 43:52.000
Just ran that as a little experiment asking, you know, if we do a season two, what do people want?

43:52.000 --> 43:56.000
And some of the changes people want aren't ones that I'm like, oh, really? Okay.

43:56.000 --> 43:58.000
But then I think about it and go, okay, that's what they want.

43:58.000 --> 44:01.000
And that makes sense why they want that. That's what the market wants.

44:01.000 --> 44:07.000
And so I don't really – nothing is so perfect of my own that it can't be criticized, you know? I mean it's –

44:07.000 --> 44:12.000
Right. Like listen, I've written infinite loops, right? Like it's – everybody makes mistakes.

44:12.000 --> 44:13.000
Yep.

44:13.000 --> 44:22.000
So can you partner with Goliath? I want to say not really.

44:22.000 --> 44:23.000
Yeah.

44:23.000 --> 44:24.000
I have tried several times.

44:24.000 --> 44:25.000
Right.

44:25.000 --> 44:30.000
And I actually don't know if you've tried. Do you want to jump in here or do you want me to take it?

44:30.000 --> 44:39.000
Boy, you know, it's – tried is an interesting – there has been back and forth conversations like between us and Twit over the years.

44:39.000 --> 44:46.000
And they sometimes are fruitful and sometimes they sort of get lost just sort of being passed around between people or whatever.

44:46.000 --> 44:50.000
And I don't have a big appetite for that either. So I don't know.

44:50.000 --> 44:54.000
It's really a challenge of getting on their radar before they'll be willing to talk to you.

44:54.000 --> 44:59.000
So – and they're in a different – they're in kind of a different category, not Twit, but like say NPR.

44:59.000 --> 45:01.000
They're kind of in a different layer.

45:01.000 --> 45:05.000
Well, their business is fundamentally different, right? I would say Twit is more like you than NPR.

45:05.000 --> 45:06.000
Yeah.

45:06.000 --> 45:12.000
Right, for sure. I mean – well, NPR is also not profit. I mean, they're kind of a crappy example, but –

45:12.000 --> 45:13.000
Yeah.

45:13.000 --> 45:31.000
You know, what I have found is bigger companies – and I'm not just thinking about like – in fact, I've never actually spoken to Thoughtbot because I feel like I already know the answer.

45:31.000 --> 45:38.000
You know, I've spoken with platform vendors and if you listen to the back catalog, you might know who I'm talking about.

45:38.000 --> 45:42.000
They always say the right things in the meeting, right?

45:42.000 --> 45:49.000
They promise a lot of stuff, but then when you hit the mat – you know, we used to be 14 people.

45:49.000 --> 45:56.000
And I tried to call on a partner of ours to help when we had a slight downturn.

45:56.000 --> 46:03.000
And they basically said, well, technically, we didn't sign the paperwork and no, right?

46:03.000 --> 46:19.000
And that has – like I've tried to put that behind me, but the reality is like at the end of the day, you're going to – I don't know if you're an old music fan, but the Eagles, Duel & Dolan, you're going to that shootout at high noon alone.

46:19.000 --> 46:21.000
Right, if you own a small business.

46:21.000 --> 46:23.000
Yes.

46:23.000 --> 46:28.000
It's weird, like I have partnered with other small businesses and you know what?

46:28.000 --> 46:30.000
That has been good.

46:30.000 --> 46:45.000
Partnering with the big guys like the insert blank contracting company that has lots of Google ads if you ever search mobile development and Google or insert platform vendor that is a fan of certain sharp languages.

46:45.000 --> 46:50.000
They're always there until you need them.

46:50.000 --> 47:00.000
What you really need as a small business is we had a downturn, we had an unexpected cancellation, you said you could funnel me clients, I need a deal and I need it within 90 days.

47:00.000 --> 47:03.000
Well, actually, you don't qualify.

47:03.000 --> 47:04.000
Right?

47:04.000 --> 47:09.000
Like there's always like some sort of issue.

47:09.000 --> 47:33.000
And maybe it's as simple as like we took your show out of the featured section because you said something bad about us all at Apple or maybe it's a certain company who now preaches about empathy in a book that was way too early to be written because really, they are who they've always been and Brian Lunduke is right.

47:33.000 --> 47:35.000
I don't know, right?

47:35.000 --> 47:45.000
Like I don't want to call people to task, I just want to say that my experience dealing with the big companies, they say all the right things, they will buy you a very nice lunch.

47:45.000 --> 47:49.000
And let me tell you, run up that bar tab because that's what you're going to get.

47:49.000 --> 48:05.000
Other than that, maybe you get a couple of glasses of Johnny Black, but when you're on the mattresses, when you have a client that can't pay or doesn't pay or you need, and this is probably particular to engineering shops.

48:05.000 --> 48:10.000
When you need them to, all right, you told me for a year now, you've been telling me you could funnel me work.

48:10.000 --> 48:13.000
Well, actually, we sent it this offshore shop.

48:13.000 --> 48:16.000
Sorry.

48:16.000 --> 48:19.000
And there's nothing you can do about that.

48:19.000 --> 48:23.000
It's like the scorpion that rides on the back.

48:23.000 --> 48:30.000
Well, a good friend of mine is very keen to tell me about the scorpion and the frog whenever I get upset about this stuff.

48:30.000 --> 48:33.000
A scorpion is a scorpion is a scorpion, right?

48:33.000 --> 48:34.000
Doesn't matter.

48:34.000 --> 48:37.000
It will always sting you.

48:37.000 --> 48:41.000
So my answer to this is no, David can never deal with Goliath.

48:41.000 --> 48:46.000
The only way to deal with Goliath is Rocky Balboa stick and move.

48:46.000 --> 48:47.000
Avoid them.

48:47.000 --> 48:48.000
You can never partner with them.

48:48.000 --> 48:50.000
It's always going to be an abusive relationship.

48:50.000 --> 48:57.000
And unless you think you're going to an acquisition scenario, which is different.

48:57.000 --> 49:02.000
Other than that, I would like to see like a united like a NATO.

49:02.000 --> 49:08.000
And I've talked about this when like what was the company was suing app developers for patent.

49:08.000 --> 49:16.000
I would like to see a NATO of like small development shops where it's like, actually, you screwed over 50 percent of us.

49:16.000 --> 49:18.000
So now none of us will deal with right.

49:18.000 --> 49:22.000
And we will blackball anyone that does.

49:22.000 --> 49:25.000
It will never happen because people are dumb and self-interested.

49:25.000 --> 49:29.000
Yeah. Yeah. And then somebody to build a business around serving to those people.

49:29.000 --> 49:32.000
Right. Exactly. Yeah.

49:32.000 --> 49:36.000
Well, Mr. Dominic, is there any other parting wisdom you'd like to leave people throughout the week to send them?

49:36.000 --> 49:41.000
Maybe they can go forth and learn more about you, what you're doing, where you are at or something like that.

49:41.000 --> 49:46.000
Yeah. If you're running out of time to listen to podcasts, go ahead and only listen to JB.

49:46.000 --> 49:48.000
There you go. That's good advice right there.

49:48.000 --> 49:49.000
That's good advice.

49:49.000 --> 49:54.000
Go check out the last couple of episodes of season one of tech talk today, tech talk dot today.

49:54.000 --> 49:58.000
