00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
This is Kota Radio, Episode 389 for November 23rd, 2020.

2
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Oh, hey there. Welcome in to Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show.

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Taking a pragmatic look at the art and the business of software development and the world of technology.

4
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
This episode is brought to you by a Cloud Guru.

8
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,000
My name is Chris, and I think perhaps planning to fry a turkey live on the show.

9
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
It's our host, Mr. Michael Dominick. Hello, Mike.

10
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Gobble, gobble.

11
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Frying something on the show might be your credit card.

12
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Oh!

13
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Shots fired.

14
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Yes, we're going to get to it, but it's an exciting perhaps live purchase.

15
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
We'll find out. We're going to walk through it on the show here in a little bit.

16
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Settle down, Chris. We can't give up, you know.

17
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
No, I know. And, you know, we have our traditions.

18
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Like the people used to have their holidays, we have our traditions.

19
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
And one of those is we start with feedback here on the program.

20
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
And we have some good feedback.

21
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
So I thought, you know, we'd read a batch of them.

22
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
But then, you know, we do have perhaps something to get into in the second half of the show.

23
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
So we're just going to do three emails this week, you know, just to keep it nice and tidy.

24
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Plus, I got a turkey smoking at home, so I got to wrap this up, you know.

25
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I estimate I got seven hours, but made a big mistake, I think.

26
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
And that is what some people recommend you do.

27
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
And this is the problem with recipes.

28
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:07,000
They have like this entire story that you have to skim to get any kind of information.

29
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Or if you go on YouTube, you have to sit through like their cold open and then their intro.

30
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
And then, God forbid, like some sort of like call out to subscribe and hit the bell.

31
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
And then you watch the video that they tell you how to smoke the turkey.

32
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
And it's a process, Mike, let me tell you.

33
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
It's a process.

34
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Yeah, see, if I had a smoker, I'm pretty sure I would smoke even more laptops.

35
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Boom.

36
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
You would find a way to sneak one in there.

37
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I was smoking some chicken over the weekend.

38
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
And this is, it's a pellet fed smoker.

39
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
And it's going right along.

40
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
And I come inside.

41
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I'm getting other things ready.

42
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
About an hour goes by.

43
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
And I come outside and I realize that my daughter had unplugged it when she was trying to help me with something else.

44
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
And just left the smoker.

45
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
So this is a test run.

46
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
So I got her at home smoking right now while I'm down here in the studio.

47
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
So we'll see how things turn out.

48
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000
But I think the mistake I made is I tried to like heat blast it to crisp up the skin.

49
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
And I think it just got things too hot.

50
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
So, you know, because the goal with smoking is low and slow.

51
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
So be careful on the YouTube videos you pick.

52
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Yeah, so you don't want to go too hot too fast.

53
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
No, you got to take your time with it, you know.

54
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
That bird is a lady.

55
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Really warm it up.

56
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Okay, let's just move on.

57
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
All right.

58
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
All right, Shad writes in.

59
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
And he's stuck at a fork in the Indie Roads.

60
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
He says, hello.

61
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Hi there.

62
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Hey, Shad.

63
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I'm a software developer specializing in a platform that is small enough where over time I was able to establish a bit of a name for myself.

64
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,000
At the same time, it's big enough where there is plenty of work if you're good.

65
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Similar to Chris, I was independent.

66
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
And then I went to go work full time.

67
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
And well, now I'm back independent again.

68
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Eighty to ninety percent of my income comes from a mix of my own long term clients and subcontracting for larger shops.

69
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
The rest comes from some product sales and shorter one off projects.

70
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I think a lot of us are pretty familiar with that mix.

71
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
He goes on to say what I need advice is regarding where to go from here.

72
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I have made some attempts to hire a part time help with the product promotion, maybe somebody with project dev work.

73
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
But I really haven't had much luck.

74
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:17,000
The town pool for developers in the platform I work on is small and I've had trouble finding people.

75
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
The fact that it's small is probably why he's able to eke out some value in that market.

76
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:28,000
But he goes on to say, I've worked with some offshore developers, but the time difference was too challenging and it was easy to just do the work myself.

77
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Additionally, much of my hourly work comes from subcontracting, which I cannot outsource.

78
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I'm making really good money right now, but I'd like to reduce my dependency on hourly work in the long term.

79
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I really enjoy development and coming up with solutions for small business problems.

80
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I don't mind doing some project management, but I don't think I'd enjoy it primarily.

81
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
And I don't think I'd enjoy focusing on managing a team.

82
00:04:51,000 --> 00:05:00,000
The only two paths I can see are to keep doing what I am doing and increase my rates over time or hire some help with a good background.

83
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:09,000
And then train them in the specific platform that I work on over time, knowing that it will cost me in the short term, but hopefully maybe pay off down the road.

84
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
So he's wondering if we have any advice for him here.

85
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
You know, he's find himself a good niche, but the problem is he's the only one that can do it.

86
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:21,000
And he doesn't really say this, but I suspect he's burning out because he seems like he needs direction.

87
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
He doesn't know where to go from here because like he's making good money.

88
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:30,000
He says he's got a mix, 80 to 90 percent of his income comes from a mix of long term clients and subcontracting.

89
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
So he's got some diversified income there.

90
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:44,000
So he doesn't actually really say quite what the problem is, but I'm guessing it's single point of failure, burnout, trying to think of how to make money without having to do so much of the hands on work himself, that kind of longer term thinking.

91
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Yeah, a couple of things definitely jump out to me.

92
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
One, how careful he is not to tell us the platform.

93
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I bet it's Android.

94
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
It's not Android.

95
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
So the subcontracting thing kind of is a flag to me.

96
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:59,000
That is almost certainly his lowest paying work and tell us if it's not.

97
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:05,000
So I would start trying to phase that out and do more direct contracting at slightly higher rates.

98
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:16,000
In terms of finding other developers, that's a dog's breakfast, man, because anybody, if it's a rare platform, anybody who could do it is not going to want to do it for less.

99
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Oh, great point.

100
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
And you need margin.

101
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Like really, you need like a lot of margin for that to make sense because people, people get sick, people screw up.

102
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Do you really want to manage developers?

103
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
The other thing he didn't mention was productizing his stuff.

104
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Sometimes that can be super helpful.

105
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Like back in the bad iOS development days and potentially in the future, we had productized like app shells that we would sell.

106
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
So you write the app shell once.

107
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
It's like a drop in, you know, you're a business.

108
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,000
This is an app for you to I think we need someone for like pizzerias or something weird.

109
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,000
And we would like sell it, license it to you for like two thousand dollars.

110
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Right.

111
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Instead of charging you for custom development.

112
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:01,000
And that was really more of a sales problem where you could get someone who's like a biz dev guy to just sell that.

113
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:06,000
And, you know, if you've ever seen Glengarry Glen Ross, get that boiler room running.

114
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Right.

115
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
So I don't know, man.

116
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I mean, it's going to depend on the platform.

117
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:16,000
If it's something like old and esoteric that not a lot of people know, I don't know what your margins are like.

118
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I don't know if you're charging a lot or charging a little.

119
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:27,000
But if you're not making, I would say like 50 percent above what you're paying, you're probably going to end up really not making too much profit given all the other costs.

120
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
And keep in mind, if you actually employ someone, there's lots of taxes.

121
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Yeah, it's very it's very complicated, very quick.

122
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
People cost a lot more than what you offer them when you hire them.

123
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Right. Then it will vary by your state, too.

124
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
So. Mm hmm. Mm hmm.

125
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Yeah, that's all really sound.

126
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:48,000
You wonder, like, is his goal long term just to have a lifestyle business that makes enough money for him to be happy?

127
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Right. That's really what's the goal there?

128
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
And maybe it's a maybe it's more of a curation of clients.

129
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
And like you said, winding down some of the subcontracting.

130
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Yeah, that is a tricky one.

131
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I think your point is really sound that in that particular niche, if somebody is capable of doing it, they may just already be out doing it and they don't really need you.

132
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
So, Chad, that's a good one.

133
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Let us know where you go with it. Yeah.

134
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
And congratulations on going independent again.

135
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I bet you that's a story I'd like to hear.

136
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Listener Chris writes and he says, I've been enjoying the show, but I have to ask who uses a laptop for development?

137
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:26,000
They make sense in times when the market leaves and they maybe have a good power per dollar as a custom system.

138
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,000
But nothing compared to what you can get with a PC tower.

139
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
And who really needs 20 hours of battery life when developing?

140
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Why would you want anything less than three screens in a machine that can execute tools and compile it as fast as possible, which only a desktop can do?

141
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
That actually sounds like an older version of me.

142
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
It's funny enough. I used to really be big on the go super powerful desktop.

143
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Then go light and portable on the mobile.

144
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Because my answer to that is, can't you have both?

145
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Yeah, I would just say get both. That's where I'm kind of.

146
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Yeah, I mean, it's what you do, right?

147
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
It's not like this. You're not joking around here.

148
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
You're not kidding yourself.

149
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
It's like you're so you're you're really committed to this.

150
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
This is what you're doing and you want to make it work for you.

151
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
All form factors. Mobile's critical.

152
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Yeah, I would say, especially if you're independent, like, you know, the plague aside, I used to spend like roughly a third of my time traveling.

153
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Right. So having a decent laptop that can do development without, you know, chugging was important.

154
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Yeah, but yeah, that's I think, although I would argue I think a lot of like places that have developers are just buying Dell XPS and.

155
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
At the Apple MacBook Pro's. Wow. Wow.

156
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
What are those called? That was bad. Yeah.

157
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I mean, I think it's if you could only buy one, I think you could if you could only buy one and mobile work is not a priority.

158
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I think listen to Chris probably has a good point.

159
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
You do get more bang for your buck with a PC.

160
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,000
You know, I have a several year old PC as my primary workstation.

161
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,000
It's now losing to the review machines that I bring in the laptops.

162
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,000
But it took a while, you know, it took it really held its own for three years.

163
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:07,000
And I could still throw in more disk, more GPU, more RAM.

164
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
So it's like not even maxed out. It's not at the end of its life.

165
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
And it's it's perfectly capable now.

166
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:20,000
So I do feel like you get longer, longer of a work class machine when you go with a desktop tower with proper cooling and all of that.

167
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:28,000
But the M1 and all of that may be changing some of that paradigm. If you just look at the benchmarks we're seeing now, it made some of that may be shifting.

168
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,000
But we'll get to that. Linux Danish wrote in says, Hi, Chris and Mike.

169
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I wanted to comment on your Dark Matter developer discussion and get some feedback on the new points in the Apple Silicon discussion to the Dark Matter point.

170
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
What do you call himself? Linux Danish?

171
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Yeah. Linux Danish maintains a couple of specific legacy IT systems supporting system engineers in a highly controlled and regulated industry.

172
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:59,000
We have benefits, regular hours, decent pay, bureaucracy and no Windows the whole nine yards.

173
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I don't think he means the OS kind. I think he means like actually no Windows.

174
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Oh, I thought he legit meant Windows. Oh, yeah. Yeah, I know.

175
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
It's a weird dunk on Windows for no reason.

176
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I'm not in the department doing the development all of the time.

177
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I'm now headlining new products, so maybe it's different there.

178
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:22,000
But for my team, the tyranny of the defaults tend to reign when we are choosing our tools.

179
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:31,000
We can just use about any technology as long as it's included in the offline Visual Studio installer on the Red Hat ISO or the Windows ISO.

180
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Technically, we can go through the bureaucracy to get new things, but it's so much effort that it isn't really viewed as worth it most of the time.

181
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:50,000
The end result is that it's a major deal for me when things are built in, whether they be tools like Git and Visual Studio, Python 3 or just standard libraries and language features.

182
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:55,000
So so like when the vendor starts to ship it, it really makes a difference, even if it's been available online.

183
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
That's an interesting point.

184
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Now to hardware, says I wanted to echo the experience of the MacBook owner who realized that he has been using the same laptop for years perfectly fine.

185
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Only mine is a Windows laptop. It's a Dell Precision from 2014, and it's still trucking along just fine.

186
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Honestly, it can be kind of annoying when you're looking to upgrade.

187
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Maybe I should just start drinking coffee the way Mike does.

188
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Yeah, every episode. Apple Silicon, there is a lot of hubbub right now about how Apple has just revolutionized the tech industry beyond Raspberry Pi's and the Pine Book Pro.

189
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
I'm not that familiar with the state of arm for general computing these days.

190
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:38,000
My understanding was that most other vendors haven't been able to really match Apple's performance in their phones.

191
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Do you guys think that the rest of the industry will be able to release competitive ARM products or will Apple just end up the performance unicorn among the rest of the field?

192
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
And he has a little bit of bacon to fry, too.

193
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:55,000
He says, due to the rise of system on a chips, he has a little conspiracy.

194
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Is everything going back to the pre IBM PC clone days, back when everything was in-house designed and purpose built for that specific system?

195
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Or is it different this time? And if it is, why?

196
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Now, this is an interesting question because we actually got a couple of versions of this that came into the show over the week that essentially assert that Apple building

197
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:22,000
the silicon, Apple building the casing, Apple building the operating system, Apple building the cloud services.

198
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:30,000
All of it is one cohesive more like Sun Microsystems than we have seen since Sun Microsystems.

199
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Let's pour one out real quick for Sun.

200
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Yep, there we go.

201
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Still hit you, Oracle. Still hit you.

202
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
I wonder if they are going to be a performance unicorn for a little bit.

203
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:48,000
You know, because these M1 Macs, they're not making threadripper machines with 64 gigs of RAM and quad GPUs cry.

204
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Let's not get ridiculous here.

205
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:55,000
But they are making just about every laptop owner out there kind of look at their machine going, why can't you do that?

206
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
And some Mac Pro owners.

207
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Yeah.

208
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Who have seen some disappointing benchmarks.

209
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:08,000
And we've seen TensorFlow update for the M1 and TensorFlow is saying very positive things, which we were really wondering how that was going to look on the M1 series.

210
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:16,000
You know, what it fundamentally comes down to with some of these applications and the performance we're seeing is, and I said this in our analysis of the live event,

211
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:23,000
is what we are seeing is Apple has executed on just about every key point of this transition.

212
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,000
And I got to give them credit for doing a good job.

213
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
They got Mac OS switched over to 64 bit.

214
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
They ate that sandwich a couple of years ago.

215
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
They started building in the security stuff that they needed.

216
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:43,000
They've created APIs like Metal and Grand Central Dispatch that goes all the way back to core elements of how the operating system handles things.

217
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Oh, GCD. That's so classic.

218
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
I thought you'd like that.

219
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Yeah.

220
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:58,000
But they've been laying this groundwork now for many Mac OS releases so that if the application relies on any of these built in APIs, it's accelerated.

221
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:04,000
It's using native ARM code paths and it's getting any kind of CPU acceleration the OS can offer it.

222
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,000
And I think that's a fascinating bit of pre-work that they did.

223
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
And now here we are and you're running applications.

224
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:15,000
And if the UI calls to Metal to render part of the UI, well, that's accelerated.

225
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:20,000
If it uses GPU rendering to do some of the computation, that's accelerated, even if the app is x86.

226
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:27,000
And so it's like they nailed, they fricking nailed x86 application performance.

227
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
And I just didn't see that.

228
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:36,000
You know, I just I thought that would be the area where this transition was going to be the little bit that they didn't talk about.

229
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
It was going to be the quiet part that nobody wanted to talk about.

230
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:43,000
And it was the failure of the M1 transition as x86 code ran like dog snot.

231
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,000
But the reality is they nailed the Rosetta transition.

232
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:51,000
They got everything on the Mac OS in line and ready to go.

233
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:58,000
They began iterating on multi-core and different system on a chip designs for iPad Pro years ago, which is was obviously in preparation for this.

234
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Like they got all of these things right.

235
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:07,000
And, you know, I'm I'm I got to I got to call I got to call an impressive play when I see it, even if it wasn't for my team.

236
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
I think Apple really nailed it.

237
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,000
So let me give you some more Mac OS trivia.

238
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Do you know? And since I'm asking the question, it should be obvious.

239
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Which release of Mac OS GCD was released in?

240
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
I think it was Snow Leopard.

241
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Yeah, of course it was Snow Leopard. Come on.

242
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Because I remember the whole thing was like, well, there was two things about Snow Leopard was that it was the big fix.

243
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,000
It was like the no thing's really going to change. Big fix release.

244
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Oh, but by the way, we're introducing this entirely new way to manage processes and cores.

245
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Right. So as a user, it's like we didn't change anything.

246
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Everything is the same as a developer. It's like here's 4000 new APIs.

247
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Have fun.

248
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Datadog.com slash Coder Radio.

249
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Today's episode of Coder Radio is indeed sponsored by Datadog, which is the monitoring and analytics platform for cloud scale infrastructure and applications.

250
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Do you know how your applications and services are performing right now?

251
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,000
What about the ones that are across different service providers or in containers?

252
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:06,000
You can see inside any stack, any app at any scale anywhere with Datadog.

253
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:15,000
They've been around since 2010, and their founders set out to solve the problem of system administrators and developers not being able to communicate and having the same set of data to work from.

254
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:24,000
And from that, they just created this beautiful dashboard system you can use with now machine learning based alerts, customizable dashboards, over 400 vendor integrations.

255
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,000
It makes it really easy to bring in all these different sources of data.

256
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:36,000
And then you can pivot and move between the metrics and events for fast troubleshooting when you need it for that or when you need to know how an application is performing for development.

257
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
And it's all in one place.

258
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,000
And Datadog also gives you observability into things like container performance.

259
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:47,000
So if you have applications running inside your container, you can see how each individual container and application is doing inside there.

260
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
It's definitely worth a try.

261
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Go to datadog.com slash coderadio.

262
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Try it for free for 14 days when you go to datadog.com slash coderadio.

263
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:59,000
And if you set up a dashboard or install the agent, you get a free t-shirt.

264
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,000
But you got to go to datadog.com slash coderadio.

265
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,000
You can see it all in one place with Datadog.

266
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Datadog.com slash coderadio.

267
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
So, Mr. Dominic, are you still on Big Sur?

268
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
How did that go for you?

269
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
I know last week you just done the install.

270
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,000
And did you rip it off there or are you?

271
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Nope.

272
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:19,000
I am.

273
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
You know what?

274
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
I'm making a major life change.

275
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
I am saying yes to Big Sur.

276
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
What?

277
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Inappropriate.

278
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Really?

279
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:32,000
You know, at this time of year, we often say what we're thankful for.

280
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:37,000
In my case, that would not be self-control.

281
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
OK.

282
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:42,000
So, allow me to tab out over here.

283
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Allow us to go to the holiest of sites, store.apple.com.

284
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Oh, boy.

285
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Now, we go to Mac because I'm not you.

286
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
I'm not buying a HomePod.

287
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,000
We're greeted by a MacBook Air and a MacBook Pro.

288
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
All right.

289
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
I'm going to go.

290
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
I'm going to go see this.

291
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Store.apple.com.

292
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
All right.

293
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Now, which one are you considering right now?

294
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
So, originally, I was considering the Pro.

295
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
OK.

296
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:14,000
But in what I can only describe as a Urza-like feverish research tangent and lots and lots

297
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
of YouTube videos.

298
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Familiar with this process myself?

299
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:23,000
It seems to be that the difference between the Pro and the Air is like a fan.

300
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Right.

301
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,000
And they can actually get roughly the same-ish performance.

302
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Now, we were just talking about with the listener who wrote in how we like beefy workstations

303
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:37,000
but then nice, small, thin laptops, right?

304
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Yep.

305
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,000
So, I think I'm going to Air with a hesitation.

306
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:46,000
I heard one kind of sketch review site was saying that the Air screen is dimmer.

307
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
I think they typically are a little bit dimmer than the Pro screen.

308
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Hmm.

309
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
But do you ever run them at 100% brightness?

310
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Yeah, because I'm freaking blind.

311
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Oh, OK.

312
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
But, I mean, how bad?

313
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Yeah, you know what?

314
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
It's probably fine.

315
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
So, then we're in the Air.

316
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Mm-hmm.

317
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Now, I notoriously don't keep my laptops for a very long time.

318
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
True.

319
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:10,000
They sometimes have unfortunate smelting accidents or smoking accidents or mixology accidents

320
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,000
and, more recently, green tea accidents.

321
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
I mean, we could just say accidents in general, right?

322
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
I mean, you know.

323
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
True.

324
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:21,000
I like to make sure the audience knows that I vary my destructive patterns with Apple

325
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
laptops.

326
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Fair, fair.

327
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Yeah.

328
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,000
So, you're greeted by, first of all, an embarrassing default configuration of 8 gigs of RAM and

329
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
6 SSD.

330
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Yeah.

331
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,000
I don't use a lot of storage because, you know, most of my stuff is just, like, code.

332
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,000
But 8 gigs of RAM, ugh.

333
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Can you really tolerate that?

334
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
And you can never upgrade it.

335
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
And you can never, ever upgrade it, right?

336
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Yeah.

337
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
So, you know.

338
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:49,000
So, I think what I'm going to do is take the base model, double that RAM.

339
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
OK, I'm following along.

340
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,000
So, base MacBook Air with 16 gigabytes of unified memory.

341
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Yeah, I don't care about storage because I honestly never use a lot of storage.

342
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
So, you're going to leave it at 256?

343
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
You're not even...

344
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
I'm going to leave it at 256.

345
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Wow, OK.

346
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Well, because if you look at it, if you up the storage, it's actually insane not to take

347
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
the other.

348
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Oh, no, it isn't because they don't give you the RAM.

349
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,000
They don't give you the RAM upgrade by default on the more expensive model.

350
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
No.

351
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
These cheap bastards.

352
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Come on.

353
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
It's 2020.

354
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Well, I think this is, you know, I mean, the Air traditionally has been the Facebook

355
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
machine.

356
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
This is not the Facebook machine.

357
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:27,000
It was, you know, the homework machine, but now it is, you know, now it's, well, things

358
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
have changed.

359
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
It's the junk on the XPS machine.

360
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Yeah, well.

361
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Oh, I want this in silver.

362
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Hmm.

363
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
See, it's a tough call.

364
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
You know what?

365
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,000
No, I'm going to go with the I'm going to go with the base, this 256.

366
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
I don't need it.

367
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Yeah.

368
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Yeah.

369
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Yeah.

370
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
All right.

371
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
So, final cut.

372
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Get that nonsense out of here.

373
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Don't need that.

374
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Nope.

375
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Then we click add to bag.

376
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,000
$1,200, which, you know, AppleCare.

377
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
No.

378
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Who would need that?

379
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
That.

380
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
What kind of monster?

381
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
And then we.

382
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
It thinks I'm in Canada.

383
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Wait.

384
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Did I go to store.apple.ca like an idiot?

385
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:10,000
You know, you wanted it with that honorary maple syrup that they include with every.

386
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
I just wanted it to, like, be nice to me.

387
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
And it's coming on Christmas.

388
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Really?

389
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Yeah.

390
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
December 17th to 24th.

391
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Well, happy, you know, happy Merry Christmas days to you.

392
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:27,000
So you're going to go with the MacBook Air 16 gigs of RAM 256.

393
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,000
That's a pretty decent build because you're not going crazy.

394
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:34,000
You could go with something that's way more expensive, which would probably be probably

395
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,000
be too much with this generation because, you know, they're going to quickly get replaced

396
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:41,000
and probably with superior housings and touchscreens and whatnot.

397
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:45,000
So probably a good call not to just max it out.

398
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Yeah, I don't think maxing it out would actually make sense only because I have.

399
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Oh, my God.

400
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:56,000
I can't do Apple Pay because I upgraded my iPhone and don't have the old phone.

401
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Apple is Optimus Gray things.

402
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:02,000
It's actually between the Canadian store and the Apple Pay checkout option.

403
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,000
He thinks it's Apple just trying to slow your roll.

404
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Yeah.

405
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Apple's like, you know what?

406
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
This guy.

407
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
We love our air.

408
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
We're not.

409
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
You can't have one.

410
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Like you're.

411
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
We know this guy.

412
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
This guy's out of control.

413
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,000
So I open my iPhone and OK, we're ordered.

414
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Why did I have to do that on my phone?

415
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Really?

416
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
That's interesting.

417
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
That was odd.

418
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
So it's ordered just like that.

419
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Just like that.

420
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Boy, they make it easy to spend money.

421
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Yes.

422
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,000
And they don't test if you've been drinking either, which I'm sure is a feature for them.

423
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:33,000
I'll tell you, I have also decided on a laptop myself.

424
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
You tease.

425
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
I told you I was in that phase.

426
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
You know, I was trying to figure it out.

427
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:43,000
I used to have a ThinkPad T480, but had to send that back with, you know, going independent

428
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
again.

429
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,000
I was trying to figure out what was the right machine for me.

430
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:51,000
And I wanted to see what Apple had to offer with the ARM processors because I'm going

431
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
to spend my hard-earned money.

432
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:57,000
I want to spend it once and I want to get the maximum value that I can.

433
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:03,000
And I just recently had that Dell Precision 5570, I think it is, which is a monster multi,

434
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:08,000
you know, 64 gigs of RAM, big old GPU, monster Xeon CPU.

435
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
Right.

436
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
17 inch high DPI screen.

437
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Infinity edge to edge, just gorgeous.

438
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:18,000
And I could really see myself enjoying a laptop like that.

439
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,000
You know, if I'm going to go big, it's a big, it's the thinnest, it's the world's thinnest

440
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
big laptop.

441
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
And I could really enjoy it.

442
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,000
But I don't need a Quadro video card.

443
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
No, really nobody does, right?

444
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:33,000
No, and that's what I've been trying to figure out is, so what I've been stuck on for a long

445
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,000
time is do I need a dedicated GPU or not?

446
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:41,000
I like the idea that if, you know, I was going to maybe play a game with the kid, I could

447
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:46,000
just crack open my laptop anywhere and GPU is good to go, can just start playing.

448
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,000
But the reality is it happens, that is a rarity.

449
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,000
It's more like we plan to do it and then we sit down and do it.

450
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:57,000
And I have this eGPU enclosure, which I invested money in and I use it as a dock.

451
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,000
So I'd have to come up with some other solution if I got a laptop with a video card.

452
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,000
And I invested in a video card a couple of generations ago.

453
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:09,000
I could just replace that video card and then my other systems that have Thunderbolt also

454
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
get a new video card.

455
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,000
That's a nice feature.

456
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,000
But of course, the new Macs don't support eGPUs.

457
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Oh, boy.

458
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:23,000
I looked really, really, really hard at the updated recently Galago Pro.

459
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:27,000
But I ultimately, you know, was playing with combinations there and I just really can't,

460
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:32,000
I couldn't come to a configuration that I ultimately wanted to pull the trigger on.

461
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:40,000
So I have narrowed down my list of laptops, but ultimately I think the one I'm going to

462
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:47,000
pull the trigger on, I'm waiting until Black Friday, is the ThinkPad X1 Carbon preloaded

463
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
with Fedora.

464
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
You're such a hipster.

465
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
Fedora.

466
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
I know.

467
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
I know.

468
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
And I think that'll be the laptop.

469
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
I haven't decided for sure.

470
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,000
I'm still kind of kicking around.

471
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:02,000
I'm also considering, like if there was a brand new updated Meerkat, I think I would

472
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:06,000
consider going with that and then building it into a desk.

473
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:12,000
But, you know, you're looking now, when you go to buy a laptop, it's really, it's not,

474
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:16,000
there's not anything that really quite hits my perfect spot for a machine because I'd

475
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,000
like something that is portable, that has good battery life.

476
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:22,000
And if it's going to have Intel, I'd like the absolute latest Intel processors.

477
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:28,000
And the majority of the market seems to have 10th gen processors and 11th are the latest.

478
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,000
I think out of all of them, the only other one that I'd most seriously consider would

479
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
be the Galago Pro right now.

480
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,000
But I'm not 100% convinced yet on which way to go.

481
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,000
So I think I'm going with the X1, but I haven't decided yet.

482
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
I may end up waiting.

483
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
I don't know.

484
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,000
We'll see.

485
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
I mean, now that you've got this, I'd like to hear your experience with it.

486
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
It is always fun.

487
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:50,000
There's a collector aspect in me that's always thinks it'd be nice to have the first ARM

488
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:54,000
generation of something that seems kind of appealing, but it's not enough reason for

489
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,000
me to pull the trigger on that.

490
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:58,000
So I'm just curious, like why Fedora?

491
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:02,000
Like is Fedora, I guess, well, you could, you could wipe out any machine and put Fedora

492
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,000
on it anyway, I guess.

493
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:06,000
Well, in part because that's what it's loaded with.

494
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,000
Okay.

495
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
That's what I was asking.

496
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
Was it like a feature that it was preloaded with Fedora or?

497
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Yeah.

498
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:14,000
And I sort of want, part of it is I kind of want to do an advocacy purchase a little bit.

499
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:18,000
There's that component of it is to sort of register with Lenovo, Hey, this ThinkPad,

500
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
you know, with Fedora loaded on it.

501
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:24,000
And it also, or you can choose Ubuntu also.

502
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:30,000
And I may keep Fedora on there very likely just to sort of run it as an experiment a

503
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,000
bit.

504
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,880
It's sort of, there is that sort of, I don't know if journalism is the right, but there's

505
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:36,000
that curiosity that wants to then talk about it.

506
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
Yeah.

507
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Chris, we're journalists.

508
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,000
Oh yeah.

509
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Oh yeah.

510
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,000
Buying laptops.

511
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Oh yeah.

512
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,180
But whatever you call, there's like that, I want to explore and then discuss it.

513
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:48,000
And I want to, I want to have that experience because that's the product.

514
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,960
And I like the idea of registering to vote with Lenovo and saying, yes, thank you for

515
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:52,960
supporting Linux.

516
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:56,200
But I'm not sure because the Dell XPS line is very tempting as well.

517
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,840
Dude, I saw somebody with one.

518
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,440
Those are so nice.

519
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:06,720
The thing is, and this is where the Galago and the XPS have not quite got me, is on the

520
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:09,900
X1 Carbon, I can get a 2K resolution screen.

521
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:10,900
You have all the options.

522
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:12,320
You can go to 1080p.

523
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:13,320
You can do 4K.

524
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:14,600
Oh, that's really cool.

525
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:18,400
I've wanted a 2K laptop screen for years.

526
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:22,240
For years and years, I've wanted it because I love it on my desktop, just absolutely love

527
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:23,240
it on Linux.

528
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:28,640
I just think it's the perfect resolution for desktop Linux on a 2K, on a 27 inch screen

529
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,560
is bliss for me.

530
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:33,520
And 2K on a laptop screen, I think would also be really great.

531
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:35,680
It would be the same size, but I still think it'd be really great.

532
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:39,200
And that's an area where the X1 is nudging ahead.

533
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:44,280
Plus it has Thunderbolt so I could still take advantage of my eGPU, which the Galago Pro

534
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:46,240
has Thunderbolt 4.

535
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:47,760
So that's also very tempting.

536
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:48,760
Yes, it does.

537
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:50,520
And it does work.

538
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:53,560
So yeah, there you go.

539
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:54,760
So you're going to be getting the MacBook.

540
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:57,480
I'll probably be getting, I'm going to either get, I'm either going to end up with one of

541
00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:02,160
those two laptops, but I think I'm leaning the X1 so that way I can kind of do an advocacy

542
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:03,160
purchase.

543
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:04,160
That does sound nice.

544
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:05,800
The 2K, I didn't know what came with the 2K screen.

545
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:06,800
That's...

546
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:07,800
Yeah.

547
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:10,400
The 2K, being able to register a vote for a Linux machine.

548
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:13,760
And I've had a thing, I've just had a ThinkPad and it worked really well for me.

549
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:14,760
So...

550
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:15,760
Yeah.

551
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:17,440
People keep suggesting I buy ThinkPads because they're sturdy.

552
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:20,080
Let me assure you guys, I will find a way.

553
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:21,080
Yeah.

554
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:22,080
They're fine.

555
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:23,080
Yeah.

556
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:26,160
My takeaway review is I liked mine and I would do it again, but I would like a better screen

557
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:30,160
and I would like it not to be so thick, but yeah.

558
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:31,160
So there you go.

559
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:35,560
Although I won't, I'll be, mine will be like another fugue state of research like you just

560
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:42,640
went through and watching some videos, calling a few people and then I'll be making my purchase,

561
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:47,560
but I'm probably going to wait, take the holiday and then check on Black Friday sales and try

562
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:48,560
to pull the trigger.

563
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:49,560
Damn.

564
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:50,560
I don't know, man.

565
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:51,560
Sorry.

566
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:52,560
The 2K screen.

567
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:53,560
That's kind of a thing.

568
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:54,560
It's really nice.

569
00:29:54,560 --> 00:30:00,640
So moving on to things that will hopefully bring me roughly $1,200 that I just spent.

570
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:03,760
Apple is reducing the app store cut to 15%.

571
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:08,520
That will be great for the 98% of developers who make no money.

572
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:09,520
Yeah.

573
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:13,440
Yeah, because if you really look at it, it's just a few whales in the app store and then

574
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:14,440
everybody else.

575
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:17,760
This is like karate kid level jujitsu here, right?

576
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:22,520
They get all these happy indie developers, myself included, and still get to say F you

577
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:23,520
to Epic games.

578
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:24,520
Yeah.

579
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:28,760
And it's, I mean, it's nice because if you make less than a million dollars, you just

580
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:32,000
got, you just got Apple's tax cut in half basically.

581
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,440
So it's less than a million from the app store by the way.

582
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:36,440
Right.

583
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:40,000
And like, I don't know, be a consulting business, right?

584
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:44,400
Though I don't make that much money because I'm sad, but they call it the new small business

585
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:47,360
program and it will go into effect January 1st, 2021.

586
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:48,360
Oh, really?

587
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:53,640
I thought the way they sent the press release out was Tim Cook emailed Tim Sweeney, subject

588
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:54,640
line F U.

589
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:57,760
They just sent him a PDF.

590
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:58,760
Yeah.

591
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:03,400
Um, you know, I, you gotta wonder, you gotta wonder if they're not looking at going, so

592
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:05,800
can we set up some LCs here or what?

593
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:07,720
So I did say I had another surprise, right?

594
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:09,200
I'm just going to go ahead and leak it.

595
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:14,720
I am looking for a few good beta testers in the next 60 days for an iOS app.

596
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:15,720
Oh, yes.

597
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:16,720
Whoa.

598
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:21,160
Um, and maybe I'll send you some vintage quarter radio coasters cause I found a box of them.

599
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:22,160
Nice.

600
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:24,000
The old, old logo at the green one actually.

601
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,640
So I got one in the studio.

602
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:30,560
I have my T on one right now actually, cause these guys have held up for like, I don't

603
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:31,560
know.

604
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:32,560
We bought them five years ago.

605
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:36,760
I know this thing is actually taking some serious spills and it's here that's still

606
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:37,760
strong.

607
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:38,760
I'm sorry.

608
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:41,720
You don't think mine have taken spills, right?

609
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:42,720
Of course.

610
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:47,520
So why can't Epic just be like, we're awesome games, LLC and like every year just open a

611
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:49,360
new LLC and be like, ha ha.

612
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:50,360
Yeah.

613
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:51,360
I don't know.

614
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:54,560
I think the only gotcha is if you made a million dollars from the app store at any point in

615
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:58,240
the year prior, then you're disqualified for the following year.

616
00:31:58,240 --> 00:31:59,480
So you would still keep it.

617
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:04,400
So like if in March you made a million and $1, it would be in January that you lose the

618
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:05,400
break.

619
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:06,600
I think so.

620
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:08,000
Which seems nuts to me.

621
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,000
Yeah.

622
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,000
Yeah.

623
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,480
But can you believe this though?

624
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:13,480
Can you believe this has happened?

625
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:14,480
A fifth?

626
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:17,200
This has been the unmovable object since forever.

627
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:20,620
Since we started this show, this is the 30% cut has been unmovable.

628
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:25,320
It's gotta be the pressure from, from Congress and you know, the DOJ and all that kind of

629
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:26,320
stuff, right?

630
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:27,320
It's gotta be preemptive action.

631
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:29,000
Kind of is a significant change.

632
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:34,240
The economics of the platform because 15% is like still crazy if you like have your

633
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:38,480
own credit card processing, but uh, you know, it's not that bad, right?

634
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:42,000
You can, you can kind of make that work better than a third.

635
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:47,480
Well, it's 15% for one of the most high value app stores literally in the world.

636
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:51,760
They manage the CDN, they manage the storefront, they manage the payment processing.

637
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:54,320
They do the marketing for better, for worse.

638
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:57,040
Like they do all of that for that 15% now.

639
00:32:57,040 --> 00:33:02,800
I mean, when it was 30%, it was like, ah, that seems like a little too much, uh, 15%.

640
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:05,860
Honestly that's, if you think about it in terms of what it would actually cost to feature

641
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:09,280
an application in a brick and mortar store back in the nineties and eighties, welcome

642
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:10,280
to Babbage's.

643
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:11,400
It was more like 50%, right?

644
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:12,400
It was much more.

645
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:13,400
Yeah.

646
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:14,400
Well, they're a best buy used to really screw developers.

647
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:17,600
It was like you got 30, it was like the other way, right?

648
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:18,600
They got 70.

649
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:23,040
How about, remember the old, uh, well, I might be going inside baseball, but so before kids,

650
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:27,960
before smartphones, there was a programming language called Java that was made by a wonderful

651
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:31,560
company named Sun that we're all, again, pouring one out.

652
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:32,560
Yep.

653
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:33,560
I'm sorry.

654
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:34,560
Damn it.

655
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:38,440
Um, it just, you know, cuts me every time twice in one episode too.

656
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:39,880
God damn it.

657
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:41,360
What's wrong with you?

658
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:46,160
Uh, there used to be these Java, was it Emmy micro edition?

659
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:47,160
Am I right?

660
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:48,160
Oh yes.

661
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:49,160
Yes.

662
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:54,640
And you know, I did some Java Emmy development way back when it was the transition from evil

663
00:33:54,640 --> 00:34:00,760
applets to iOS and the deal was the company would like make an app and the only way to

664
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:06,080
get it was to deal with Verizon, which you can imagine how awesome that could be.

665
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:11,720
And literally the company who make, made the quote unquote app got like 20% of the revenue.

666
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:12,720
Yeah.

667
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:14,520
It was the same thing for a Palm pilot, right?

668
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:15,520
Like, yep.

669
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:16,520
Yep.

670
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:20,040
It was literally controlled by the carrier, which is just how things worked back then.

671
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:21,040
Yeah.

672
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:22,040
Oh, and it's Verizon.

673
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:23,520
Just like you were too small or whatever.

674
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:24,520
Sorry.

675
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:25,520
Sorry.

676
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:26,520
Yeah.

677
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:27,520
Yeah.

678
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:28,520
So, yeah.

679
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:30,240
And then there was no mobile web to speak of.

680
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:31,720
There was the baby web.

681
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:32,720
Oh my God.

682
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:35,960
The a text only browser on your little flip phone.

683
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:36,960
Yeah.

684
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:38,440
So you know who's not happy about this though?

685
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:39,440
Huh?

686
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:41,320
The creator of Ruby on rails, DHH.

687
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:43,840
He's who spicy Twitter feed.

688
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:45,780
About the cut in price.

689
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:46,780
About the cut.

690
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:47,780
Yeah.

691
00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:48,780
Yeah.

692
00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:49,780
What is the logic for that?

693
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:55,580
His whole point is Apple's doing this to hopefully duck, you know, antitrust and because only

694
00:34:55,580 --> 00:34:57,700
big developers actually make the money.

695
00:34:57,700 --> 00:35:00,040
So they're getting a bunch of goodwill and not losing money.

696
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:01,040
Well, how was that?

697
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:02,040
How was that bad though?

698
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:04,240
Well, he wants them to open up to other payment products, right?

699
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:08,120
Like, Oh, so he wants, he wants them not to do this change.

700
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:12,880
So that way they get in trouble by federal regulators and then they're forced to go,

701
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:13,880
right?

702
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:14,880
Right.

703
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:18,360
And that's always how those things go is they always go best case scenario when regulators

704
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:22,860
get involved versus a company who just proactively makes the change.

705
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:27,760
They would most nominally be negotiated from some sort of federal investigation anyways,

706
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:29,120
and does it ahead of time.

707
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:30,880
Federal government never has to get involved.

708
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:34,600
Company makes change and users win, but I mean, well, who, what do I know?

709
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:35,600
Right?

710
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:38,040
This is like Apple saw the writing on the wall and was like, all right, may a cold,

711
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:40,240
but let's just do this right.

712
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:43,720
And also there's the rumor, I don't know if you caught this one, that they're gonna in

713
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:48,160
the iOS set up flow when you're starting, uh, starting, you know, like getting on your

714
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:53,400
phone out of the box, they're apparently in the, this is, I heard through the grapevine

715
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:58,440
going to start suggesting third party apps for defaults, actively suggesting them.

716
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:00,920
So like they're basically saying, DOJ, please don't hurt me.

717
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:01,920
Right?

718
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:02,920
Browser banner.

719
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:03,920
Oh dude.

720
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:06,420
I didn't even crap.

721
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:07,920
Everything comes back to IE six.

722
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:08,920
Yeah.

723
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:11,000
It's the preemptive browser banner before they're told to do it.

724
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:14,200
Just like Google has the search auction in some EU markets.

725
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:15,200
Yeah.

726
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:16,200
So I don't know.

727
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:17,200
I actually am excited about this.

728
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:21,760
I think with the new arm unification with, I think if long time listeners of the show

729
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:26,560
know, I pretty much think the iPad is probably the best computer for lots of nonenthusiast

730
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:27,560
people.

731
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:30,280
And I'm, I'm gonna try it again.

732
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:34,560
I'm dipping my toes back into the iOS tool and you will pry my objective C from my cold

733
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:35,560
dead.

734
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:39,280
Now I'm doing swift and I'm really crying in the shower quite a bit.

735
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:43,920
I'll tell you what would really be a game changer is if it turns out to be doable to

736
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:45,580
get Linux on these things for me.

737
00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:49,040
And that would be great because Linus talked about it.

738
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:53,160
He, he posted it earlier that, uh, he, uh, he thinks these Mac books would be great if

739
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:54,160
you can get Linux on them.

740
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:56,720
And so I thought, okay, that's kind of interesting idea.

741
00:36:56,720 --> 00:37:00,920
And then I saw this interview with a, your good buddy, your pal, Craig Federici there.

742
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:01,920
Getting a little hot over here.

743
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:02,920
Hang on.

744
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:06,920
He said, and I quote, there's nothing technically preventing windows from running on the M1

745
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:07,920
Macs.

746
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:08,920
Yeah.

747
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:12,520
Microsoft just, and you know how good Microsoft is at getting windows 10 on arm.

748
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:13,520
Ooh.

749
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:14,520
No, no, no.

750
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:18,080
That means then if you can get windows running on it, then you can get Linux running on it.

751
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:19,080
Yeah.

752
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:20,080
Well, didn't you see the Linux iPad thing?

753
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:21,080
No, no.

754
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:22,080
Is this a thing?

755
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:23,080
This is a thing.

756
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:24,080
How did I not see this?

757
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:26,320
Like, I don't know why it exists, but someone is trying to make that.

758
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:27,320
Huh.

759
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:28,320
I don't know about that, man.

760
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:29,880
They showed Linux running on it.

761
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:30,880
No, no.

762
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:31,880
Yeah.

763
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:32,880
That was in VM.

764
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:33,880
Oh, it was in a VM.

765
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:34,880
Okay.

766
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:35,880
CFED's talking about running it natively.

767
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:37,680
You just got to write the drivers, I guess.

768
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:39,960
I mean, I don't know exactly how that would work.

769
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:42,640
Listen, if you could, you know what?

770
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:47,120
I believe in the Linux hippies.

771
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:48,480
Linode.com slash coder.

772
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:52,200
Go there to receive a $100 60 day credit towards your new account.

773
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:54,680
Linode.com slash coder.

774
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:56,680
Linode is my cloud provider.

775
00:37:56,680 --> 00:38:00,720
I discovered them a couple of years ago after I started working and I thought, you know

776
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:01,720
what?

777
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:05,800
I better, I better set up my own servers that aren't mixed in with the business stuff now

778
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:07,600
that I'm an employee.

779
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:11,060
I went over to try out Linode because I'd seen them at Linux Fest and just about every

780
00:38:11,060 --> 00:38:14,920
other event I have attended and I've known about them because they've been around forever.

781
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:19,040
In fact, Linode was one of the very first cloud providers.

782
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:20,040
One of the first.

783
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:24,080
They beat AWS by three years, so they've been around for a little while and I was familiar

784
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:26,120
with them and I thought, I'll go try them out.

785
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:30,020
So I went over to Linode and I signed up for an account and I'll say my expectations were

786
00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:34,120
high because I was pretty familiar with what the other vendors offered for configuration

787
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:37,400
and management and they exceeded my expectations.

788
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:40,600
And I stuck with them for a couple of years and by the time Jupyter Broadcasting was going

789
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:44,920
independent again, there was just no question where I was going to deploy the new work infrastructure,

790
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:47,400
the new systems that we had to set up.

791
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:50,460
Linode is my cloud hosting provider and I host all of the new infrastructure that we're

792
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:52,760
building for Jupyter Broadcasting 3.0.

793
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:57,480
It's got native SSD storage, 40 gigabit network connections, a revamped easy to use cloud

794
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:58,480
manager.

795
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:02,120
I love the cloud dashboard, but honestly, you know what I just kind of use super, super

796
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:04,280
fast and quick all the time?

797
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:06,580
Is Linode command line interface.

798
00:39:06,580 --> 00:39:11,500
You can get a command line interface really easy to set up and then you can set, like

799
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:17,040
what I do is I set ACLs or upload object files all the time for the object storage.

800
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:22,240
If I play a sound, that right there, that came from an object storage, how about that?

801
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:26,200
Yeah, it's really cool and I use the command line to just take care of all that stuff,

802
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:30,260
but you can spin machines up and down if you don't want to use the dashboard.

803
00:39:30,260 --> 00:39:33,040
And their costs are really impressive.

804
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:37,600
They're 30 to 50% less than major cloud providers like AWS or Google.

805
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:41,060
They have 11 data centers around the world, so you can pick something that's close to

806
00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:44,840
you or something that's close to a client, or maybe you want something spread out and

807
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:49,360
do a little redundancy, but with machines starting at $5 a month, why not?

808
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:54,360
They have machines that go up from there with dedicated GPUs and CPUs and lots of RAM.

809
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:59,280
Over the weekend, I set up a new server just within a couple of clicks, eight gigs of RAM,

810
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:02,460
dedicated CPU, and I set it up in Dallas, Texas because I kind of wanted it in a nice

811
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:05,680
central point in the States.

00:40:31,340 --> 00:40:39,920
This week, Stadia announced that it will be playable on iOS in Safari via a progressive

820
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:44,800
web app, which I totally suggested and I said, I don't know how it'd be possible in a coder

821
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:49,800
radio not too long ago, because you just think about the size of data that they have to transfer

822
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:53,960
and what Safari's limits are, but they're making it work.

823
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:57,680
And they have a dedicated app now, but it's just like a little hub that lets you see your

824
00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:02,760
friends and your inventory, kind of basic.

825
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:07,120
And so they're going to open up to public testing and you're going to be able to play

826
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:10,320
your Stadia games that nobody uses in their browser.

827
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:13,600
I think Amazon's Luna gaming service is also doing this.

828
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:14,600
So I actually have Stadia.

829
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:16,380
No, I know, I do too.

830
00:41:16,380 --> 00:41:17,380
You don't want it.

831
00:41:17,380 --> 00:41:21,740
It's kind of impressive that they got this working in iOS Safari, like the tech, I would

832
00:41:21,740 --> 00:41:24,540
love to hear more about the tech, but yeah, it's, you know.

833
00:41:24,540 --> 00:41:27,800
That's kind of how I felt about it is it is actually technically very impressive.

834
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:31,200
Like I think over the years we've lamented Google killing products.

835
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:41,140
You know what, if Stadia has got to go, yeah, yeah, I got it because I thought, you know,

836
00:41:41,140 --> 00:41:44,640
this could be the great equalizer that would equalize no more.

837
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:49,040
This again, going back to this laptop thing where it's like, do I need a GPU or not?

838
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:51,840
Well, no, not if Stadia can stream at all.

839
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:53,140
Yeah, it's doable.

840
00:41:53,140 --> 00:41:55,160
The tech is doable.

841
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:56,840
I bought Red Dead Redemption.

842
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:58,600
It's not, it's playable.

843
00:41:58,600 --> 00:41:59,600
It's fine.

844
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:02,720
I briefly had like the Super Pro and I got to play Metro, but it was crap.

845
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:05,880
Like it really suffers from bandwidth fluctuations.

846
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:07,160
Yes, it does.

847
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:13,400
I have played it over mobile in the woods and yeah, I just thought I wanted to try to

848
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:14,840
see if it was technically possible.

849
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:16,280
It's camping Chris Fisher style.

850
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:20,880
I'm just in the woods playing Red Dead Redemption.

851
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:23,560
And when the game starts up, it's a heavy snow scene.

852
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:28,860
So the compression just, yeah, and so, and it was, it was mixed results for sure.

853
00:42:28,860 --> 00:42:31,680
But I was impressed it was even technically possible.

854
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:35,780
I even was on board with OnLive back in the day, which was a different streaming service

855
00:42:35,780 --> 00:42:37,720
that required a dedicated application.

856
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:38,720
Also didn't work.

857
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:39,720
Yeah.

858
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:42,200
I mean, it worked okay, but it's like, it's better for some kinds of games and other kinds

859
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:43,200
of games.

860
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:44,200
And yeah.

861
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:45,920
But you know, this is the way it's going.

862
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:49,220
PlayStation has a streaming service, Microsoft has a streaming service.

863
00:42:49,220 --> 00:42:53,600
How can that be when we have duopolies or in a lot of cases, monopolies in the US for

864
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:54,600
bandwidth?

865
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:57,680
So can you explain how, um, hashtag 5g?

866
00:42:57,680 --> 00:42:58,680
I don't know.

867
00:42:58,680 --> 00:42:59,680
Okay.

868
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:00,680
Yeah.

869
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:06,520
I, it is, it is funny because it's like, um, for some people it's hard to even watch a

870
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:12,360
streaming video, let alone a game that often requires more bandwidth and lower latency.

871
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:14,400
And it's, it's bi-directional.

872
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:19,280
I might be going to my data center just to like watch Netflix and 4k off the dedicated

873
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:20,280
fiber.

874
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:21,280
I know.

875
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:22,280
Right.

876
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:24,800
I, it is, it's a, it's a, it's a bad situation.

877
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:27,860
And when we say all this and the listeners that listen outside the States, they always

878
00:43:27,860 --> 00:43:32,680
like to write in and jab us a little bit for like their, so it's like greetings from Israel

879
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:36,080
or any other country with an internet policy that actually makes sense.

880
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:37,080
Right.

881
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:40,640
The reason why I threw Stadia out a while ago as maybe they should make a progressive

882
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:46,380
web app is it sort of felt like a Hail Mary kind of, kind of solution to an apps for problem

883
00:43:46,380 --> 00:43:52,080
that just seems impossible because this 15% that Apple has done here doesn't solve the

884
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:59,320
other problems that developers like Epic and Google and Microsoft have where, um, as an

885
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:04,520
iOS user, I don't, I mean, I actually may use Stadia more if I could play it on my iPad.

886
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:05,520
I really might.

887
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:08,080
I mean, you must have much better bandwidth than I do.

888
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:09,080
I mean, I'm on Comcast.

889
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:10,720
I mean, it's all right.

890
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:14,920
I mean, at home I'm on cellular, so I can't do it there, but here, right, right.

891
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:15,920
Yeah.

892
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:17,400
I mean, I mean, I don't know.

893
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:20,600
I actually think I do have just based on our recording data.

894
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:22,840
I think I do have it, but no, I think you actually do.

895
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:23,840
Right.

896
00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:24,840
Like it's, but it's not great.

897
00:44:24,840 --> 00:44:26,320
It's not like the best of the best.

898
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:27,320
Huh?

899
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:31,200
Like right now, my average latency to Google servers, my, my, my, my ping milliseconds

900
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:32,200
is 20.

901
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:33,200
That's kind of high.

902
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:37,120
Of course, I'm also live streaming and doing a video call with you at the same time.

903
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:38,120
True.

904
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:41,920
I am using the internet for other things, but transcoding shots of Federici on buttoning

905
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:42,920
a shirt.

906
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:43,920
Oh, geez.

907
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:46,480
Just him opening up that Mac book over and over again on loop.

908
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:47,480
That was weird.

909
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:50,280
I, you know, every, you know, I think Apple was saying mean this, they're like, they're,

910
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:52,160
they're trying to create the meme opportunities.

911
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:53,160
Yeah.

912
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:56,400
Well, there was a hashtag Federici for four days, so he got it.

913
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:57,400
Yeah.

914
00:44:57,400 --> 00:44:58,400
Well, yeah.

915
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:05,160
Hey, I guess it sells max actually, uh, snark aside, I should just be better about this.

916
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:07,080
Like, he seems like the perfect guy to run that position.

917
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:08,200
Like he really knows his stuff.

918
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:09,200
He's got passion for it.

919
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:10,200
Oh no.

920
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:11,200
I used to doing a great job.

921
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:12,200
Yeah.

922
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:14,840
I've, I just liked that they, I liked that they leaned into the fact that he never buttons

923
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:15,840
a shirt all the way.

924
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:17,440
It just like went for it.

925
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:18,440
Right?

926
00:45:18,440 --> 00:45:19,440
Yeah.

927
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:20,440
Yeah.

928
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:21,440
Very much so.

929
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:22,440
Well, so yeah, there you go.

930
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:24,240
I mean, we'll see, we'll see if, um, we'll see if other streaming providers follow suit.

931
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:26,760
We'll see if more applications launched to Safari.

932
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:30,160
This also is interesting because you're going to be able to potentially set different default

933
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:31,160
browsers on iOS.

934
00:45:31,160 --> 00:45:32,160
Yes.

935
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:34,760
But Chrome on iOS is still going to be Safari.

936
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:35,760
So.

937
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:36,760
Yeah, that's true.

938
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:37,760
Yeah.

939
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:39,600
Like it's weird where they're backing down.

940
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:40,600
Right?

941
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:43,120
Cause like we mentioned Stadia and whatever, what is it?

942
00:45:43,120 --> 00:45:44,120
X cloud?

943
00:45:44,120 --> 00:45:45,120
Is that the Microsoft one?

944
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:46,120
Yeah.

945
00:45:46,120 --> 00:45:47,400
But those apps aren't even allowed in the store.

946
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:48,920
Forget the percentages, right?

947
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:51,560
Cause you have each individual game has to get reviewed still.

948
00:45:51,560 --> 00:45:52,560
Oh right.

949
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:53,560
That's not going to happen.

950
00:45:53,560 --> 00:45:54,560
Right?

951
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:57,280
There's a specific rule against streaming game services.

952
00:45:57,280 --> 00:45:58,280
That's just not going to happen.

953
00:45:58,280 --> 00:45:59,280
Right.

954
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:03,400
So I don't know why that rule exists, but it does.

955
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:04,400
Yeah.

956
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:08,200
I do wonder if they like just gave up on app review, but then I don't know, then my relatives

957
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:09,200
will download malware.

958
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:11,040
This is why you should get a Librem 5.

959
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:12,880
You know, they're shipping their production models now.

960
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:13,880
Don't you know?

961
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:16,240
I'm sure you must, you probably have a team of people developing apps for it.

962
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:17,240
I'm sure.

963
00:46:17,240 --> 00:46:18,240
Oh, Oh God.

964
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:19,240
Yeah.

965
00:46:19,240 --> 00:46:21,240
We have a whole room of, uh, I don't even remember what that is.

966
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:23,080
What is the Librem 5?

967
00:46:23,080 --> 00:46:25,680
That's Purism's a Linux powered phone.

968
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:26,680
You know what?

969
00:46:26,680 --> 00:46:27,680
Ubuntu Touch.

970
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:28,680
All I'm going to say.

971
00:46:28,680 --> 00:46:29,680
It's still out there.

972
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:30,680
It's Ubiports.

973
00:46:30,680 --> 00:46:31,680
Ubuntu TV.

974
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:32,680
Okay.

975
00:46:32,680 --> 00:46:33,680
Well that's, that's not out there anymore.

976
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:37,160
I'm going to do some technical projects if you want me to for like an hour and a half.

977
00:46:37,160 --> 00:46:38,160
Nope.

978
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:39,160
Nope.

979
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:40,160
I don't think so.

980
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:42,320
Actually, uh, you know what I should mention before I forget is I'm going to do a Black

00:46:42,320 --> 00:46:43,880

It's, uh, it's the end of December.

993
00:47:12,080 --> 00:47:15,200
This is the, the saddest quarter where we have to pay taxes.

994
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:16,200
Yeah.

995
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:17,200
Hmm.

996
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:19,720
We conveniently always buy a laptop around this time of year.

997
00:47:19,720 --> 00:47:20,720
Yeah.

998
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:21,720
Isn't that funny how that works?

999
00:47:21,720 --> 00:47:22,720
Isn't that funny how that happens?

1000
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:23,720
Oh, so what happened?

1001
00:47:23,720 --> 00:47:24,720
I needed a laptop.

1002
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:25,720
Oh yeah.

1003
00:47:25,720 --> 00:47:28,360
It was a work machine.

1004
00:47:28,360 --> 00:47:32,280
I would rather, I would, I mean, there's a part of me that, yeah, anyways.

1005
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:34,360
Maybe we'll save it for the quarterly report.

1006
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:36,000
I'll save my opinion there for that.

1007
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:37,000
Yeah.

1008
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:41,120
Um, so if you want to get that and the previous one we've released, that's at CoderQA.co.

1009
00:47:41,120 --> 00:47:45,040
And thank you everybody who, uh, supports the show directly.

1016
00:47:58,120 --> 00:47:59,800
We've had our, it's been a really great return.

1017
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:03,840
Um, you know, the, the show has been back now for a little bit and I think, uh, some

1018
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:08,520
people are still finding it, but overall I think a lot of people stayed subscribed, hoping.

1019
00:48:08,520 --> 00:48:10,960
And um, so it's been a really nice, it's been really nice.

1020
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:13,960
And so one of the things that, uh, both Mike and I, I'm going to speak for you now, uh,

1021
00:48:13,960 --> 00:48:15,520
are thankful for is, uh, you guys.

1022
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:16,520
So.

1023
00:48:16,520 --> 00:48:17,520
Yes, absolutely.

00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:18,520
Thank you everybody.

1025
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:21,400
Um, Mr. Dominic, is there anything you want to mention or plug before we get out of here?

1026
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:22,400
Uh, no.

1027
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:25,160
Uh, follow me at Dumunuku on Twitter, companies at Madder Botter Inc.

1031

Fat cat says in the chat room that we need merge is right.

1032
00:48:34,320 --> 00:48:35,320
We do.

1033
00:48:35,320 --> 00:48:36,320
I just want to do it right when I do it.

1034
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:39,200
I don't want to just like, you'll see like a lot of places or YouTubers, they'll just

1035
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:43,300
throw their logo on like anything that auto generates merge.

1036
00:48:43,300 --> 00:48:44,300
And I don't want to do that.

1037
00:48:44,300 --> 00:48:46,120
I actually, this is way inside baseball.

1038
00:48:46,120 --> 00:48:50,800
I actually just got a very messed up a box of TMB merge that I'm sending back.

1039
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:51,800
Yeah.

1040
00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:53,600

1041
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:54,600
