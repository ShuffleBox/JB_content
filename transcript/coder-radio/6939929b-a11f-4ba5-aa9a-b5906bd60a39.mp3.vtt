This is KOTORadio, episode 386, for November 2nd, 2020.

00:31.000 --> 00:35.000
Hello friends and welcome into KOTORadio, Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show

00:35.000 --> 00:39.000
taking a pragmatic look at the art and business of software development and the

00:39.000 --> 00:43.000
world of technology. This episode is brought to you by a Cloud Guru. A Cloud

00:43.000 --> 00:47.000
Guru now includes Cloud Playgrounds, Azure AWS, and Google Cloud Sandboxes on

00:47.000 --> 00:52.000
ACG's credit card, not yours. Get certified, get hired, get learning.

00:52.000 --> 00:59.000
A CloudGuru.com. My name is Chris and joining us is our host, Mr. Dominic, with

00:59.000 --> 01:02.000
no Florida jokes. Hello, Mike.

01:02.000 --> 01:05.000
Hello, Chris. Hang on, I just got to push down on this beautiful single-serve

01:05.000 --> 01:09.000
French press here. There we go. Feel that plunge.

01:09.000 --> 01:13.000
Did you get your first bag of coffee of the month?

01:13.000 --> 01:17.000
I did. You can hear me pouring it, I'm sure. Right from Kenya this month.

01:17.000 --> 01:18.000
Oh, how is it?

01:18.000 --> 01:24.000
I like it as an afternoon coffee. It's very earthy, very smooth, not very strong.

01:24.000 --> 01:27.000
And you know, to start off my day, I really need the French baguette to the face

01:27.000 --> 01:29.000
coffee.

01:29.000 --> 01:31.000
Yeah, your breakfast coffee.

01:31.000 --> 01:36.000
My only complaint is that this is a coffee you need to French press or pour

01:36.000 --> 01:43.000
over. The AeroPress, you know, you have some loves that are like, you know,

01:43.000 --> 01:46.000
Romeo and Juliet till the bitter end when you're choking on blood and

01:46.000 --> 01:48.000
hemorrhaging internally.

01:48.000 --> 01:49.000
Right.

01:49.000 --> 01:52.000
Then you have some that are more like the movie Grease, where it's really just a

01:52.000 --> 01:56.000
summer love. And that would be my relationship with the AeroPress.

01:56.000 --> 01:59.000
That tends to be mine. My wife sticks with it. But here's what I say to you,

01:59.000 --> 02:03.000
sir. If you're going to all the trouble being a fancy guy with your fancy mail

02:03.000 --> 02:06.000
order coffee, what are you going to do? Not use the AeroPress when this

02:06.000 --> 02:11.000
perfectly picked coffee arrives at your house? Like, you got to give it the best

02:11.000 --> 02:12.000
treatment possible.

02:12.000 --> 02:16.000
So this is one of the few times I wish this was a video show. I would show you

02:16.000 --> 02:20.000
my single serve bamboo wood French press.

02:20.000 --> 02:21.000
Oh, my God.

02:21.000 --> 02:23.000
That is what I would do, sir.

02:23.000 --> 02:28.000
Oh, I'll tell you what. I didn't sleep last night. I think maybe 45 minutes.

02:28.000 --> 02:29.000
Oh.

02:29.000 --> 02:35.000
Yeah. So I'm doing – when I have a night of no sleep, I have a pack of

02:35.000 --> 02:39.000
sugar-free Red Bull that I go for. I don't bother with the coffee. I don't bother

02:39.000 --> 02:43.000
with the caffeine pill. I go with the sugar-free Red Bull because, you know,

02:43.000 --> 02:46.000
you just need the kick. I'm just trying to get myself through half the day,

02:46.000 --> 02:49.000
and then I'm going to allow myself an opportunity for a nap in the afternoon.

02:49.000 --> 02:55.000
But I just – I don't know. You know, it's just so much going on, and with the

02:55.000 --> 02:58.000
election and everything, I just – my mind is going 100 miles per hour on work

02:58.000 --> 03:03.000
stuff and world stuff, and boy, am I just looking forward to things settling

03:03.000 --> 03:04.000
down a little bit.

03:04.000 --> 03:07.000
Yeah, you're doing some live coverage of that on Unfilter, aren't you, or my –

03:07.000 --> 03:10.000
I will be. Yes. Yes, I'm that crazy.

03:10.000 --> 03:13.000
If I fall asleep during the show today, I guess I didn't get the Red Bull mix

03:13.000 --> 03:14.000
right.

03:14.000 --> 03:16.000
I'll just scream, Seuss, and you'll wake right up.

03:16.000 --> 03:21.000
No doubt about that. We'll be getting to that. We'll be getting to that.

03:21.000 --> 03:24.000
But we do have some Dark Matter Dev follow-up to get to.

03:24.000 --> 03:27.000
This one is a Dark Matter Dev for decades.

03:27.000 --> 03:30.000
He says, hello, guys. I'm a longtime listener of Coder Radio.

03:30.000 --> 03:34.000
I recently listened to the discussion you had about Dark Matter developers

03:34.000 --> 03:38.000
with Mike, and of course, I am one of those. I work for a global bank.

03:38.000 --> 03:43.000
I use Java 8, an Oracle database, and ReactJS. The software we develop is a

03:43.000 --> 03:46.000
software managing one of the bank's internal systems. It has a couple of

03:46.000 --> 03:48.000
hundred users spread across the globe.

03:48.000 --> 03:53.000
Of late, there is a large push inside the bank to, quote, adopt the cloud.

03:53.000 --> 03:57.000
So recently, I've gotten to play with Kubernetes, OpenShift, Docker, et cetera.

03:57.000 --> 04:00.000
All the developers in my team use cloud desktops for development.

04:00.000 --> 04:04.000
Cloud desktops managed by the internal IT team, they're slow.

04:04.000 --> 04:08.000
They break often, and they make life miserable for the developer.

04:08.000 --> 04:11.000
I don't mean to laugh. I just didn't expect it to go that direction.

04:11.000 --> 04:15.000
He says, but, you know, the job pays well. I have reasonably good job security,

04:15.000 --> 04:18.000
and people I work with are some of the nicest out there.

04:18.000 --> 04:21.000
My boss seems pretty great. We get along just fine, and COVID-19 hasn't

04:21.000 --> 04:23.000
really affected our employment at all.

04:23.000 --> 04:26.000
I've been a Dark Matter developer for a couple of decades.

04:26.000 --> 04:30.000
I started programming COBOL systems on IBM mainframes and then moved on

04:30.000 --> 04:32.000
to other technologies as time went on.

04:32.000 --> 04:36.000
For me personally, the benefits of being a Dark Matter developer has

04:36.000 --> 04:39.000
outweighed the costs. Granted, enterprise software isn't the most exciting

04:39.000 --> 04:45.000
thing to work on. However, it has given me a reasonably good work-life balance

04:45.000 --> 04:51.000
and given me the opportunity to travel to places and meet people I never would

04:51.000 --> 04:55.000
have met growing up as a middle-class kid in India.

04:55.000 --> 04:57.000
I listen to your podcast, so keep up with the technology news.

04:57.000 --> 04:59.000
It's always interesting to listen to you and Mike talk about experiences

04:59.000 --> 05:03.000
running a software business. Keep up the great work, and thanks to Mike

05:03.000 --> 05:07.000
and you for producing entertaining and informative content.

05:07.000 --> 05:10.000
Best regards, Mr. Anonymous.

05:10.000 --> 05:13.000
Dark Matter developer for decades, and he says he looks back on it, Mike,

05:13.000 --> 05:14.000
and says it was all worth it.

05:14.000 --> 05:17.000
Yeah, sure, right. Different strokes for different folks.

05:17.000 --> 05:21.000
I think it's a good data point for people listening that are in the

05:21.000 --> 05:24.000
perpetual, should I go indie, should I work for myself, should I build my

05:24.000 --> 05:28.000
own product and sell it directly, or should I go work for someone else?

05:28.000 --> 05:32.000
That's why we started asking about kind of just getting people's input

05:32.000 --> 05:35.000
and thoughts about being a Dark Matter developer, so we had a better

05:35.000 --> 05:38.000
kind of database, you know, to pull from.

05:38.000 --> 05:41.000
And JVP writes in as a Dark Matter developer.

05:41.000 --> 05:44.000
Now, here's the thing. He's been programming for various jobs over the years,

05:44.000 --> 05:48.000
but where he works now, he's been there for eight years, and the software

05:48.000 --> 05:52.000
only runs on Windows, so he wanted to share a bit of a Windows perspective

05:52.000 --> 05:55.000
that doesn't get a lot of attention here sometimes, I suppose.

05:55.000 --> 05:57.000
It is the best Linux, this drill.

05:57.000 --> 06:00.000
It hurts because it's becoming true.

06:00.000 --> 06:03.000
Well, other than SUSE.

06:03.000 --> 06:05.000
I got to focus. I'm going to get through this email.

06:05.000 --> 06:08.000
Drew, do not edit his sigh of rage out.

06:08.000 --> 06:11.000
We are going to address that. We are going to address that.

06:11.000 --> 06:15.000
But first, he says our software runs only on Windows, so I want to share that perspective.

06:15.000 --> 06:18.000
Windows 10 has the same bloat problems that other versions had, and it's

06:18.000 --> 06:22.000
compounded by antivirus and anti-malware that gets more and more complex each year.

06:22.000 --> 06:26.000
The antivirus software feels like a rootkit at this point, and since I don't

06:26.000 --> 06:30.000
really have admin control on some processes, you simply can't just sit down

06:30.000 --> 06:33.000
at a fresh install of Win 10 and compare it to anything else without at least

06:33.000 --> 06:37.000
running it for two to four years, which is maybe the amount of time I spend

06:37.000 --> 06:39.000
between IT upgrades at best.

06:39.000 --> 06:43.000
This leads me to trying to do most of my work on my personal laptop running

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
Ubuntu because of these frustrations.

06:45.000 --> 06:49.000
One of my horror stories has seen a message pop up that updates and rebooted

06:49.000 --> 06:52.000
and was forced right in the middle of a presentation to a customer.

06:52.000 --> 06:55.000
This actually happened to me, and I couldn't stop it from happening,

06:55.000 --> 06:58.000
and I ended up having to return to the customer the next day.

06:58.000 --> 07:02.000
When I contacted IT, he just said that there must have been a delayed update

07:02.000 --> 07:05.000
for more than five days, and then there was nothing he could do about it.

07:05.000 --> 07:08.000
Oh, my God.

07:08.000 --> 07:12.000
You just feel like you have no governance over your computer when that happens.

07:12.000 --> 07:13.000
He goes on.

07:13.000 --> 07:16.000
Windows 10 has broke a lot of things in software terms.

07:16.000 --> 07:20.000
People usually mention that Windows has a largely good legacy compatibility

07:20.000 --> 07:24.000
and that rebasing would be unheard of because of this compatibility,

07:24.000 --> 07:27.000
but honestly, all of the software that worked fine in previous systems,

07:27.000 --> 07:32.000
like on Windows 2000 and XP, stopped working in Windows 7,

07:32.000 --> 07:35.000
and then things changed even more with Windows 10.

07:35.000 --> 07:38.000
Nobody in the industry took Windows 8 seriously, he says.

07:38.000 --> 07:42.000
The idea that WSL could lead to a flipped architecture is one I think

07:42.000 --> 07:43.000
isn't too far out there.

07:43.000 --> 07:46.000
We've seen Microsoft be adept at changing strategies

07:46.000 --> 07:48.000
for such a large corporation.

07:48.000 --> 07:51.000
The move to Azure seems to be their number one priority,

07:51.000 --> 07:54.000
and my two cents is that the strategy to drop Windows

07:54.000 --> 07:59.000
and license revenue in order to be better positioned for Azure deployments

07:59.000 --> 08:01.000
makes sense.

08:01.000 --> 08:03.000
I think Microsoft would pivot quickly.

08:03.000 --> 08:06.000
Well, as quick as a giant ship can, he says.

08:06.000 --> 08:09.000
With all of these crews that worked together to turn the rudder,

08:09.000 --> 08:10.000
they could get there.

08:10.000 --> 08:13.000
They could easily create a reverse WSL that could run Linux

08:13.000 --> 08:18.000
and support a reference architecture base with something like 90% compatibility

08:18.000 --> 08:22.000
and functionality, something similar maybe to Proton on Linux.

08:22.000 --> 08:25.000
Just think of the amount of money that they could throw at this versus Valve.

08:25.000 --> 08:29.000
I don't know if the Windows license model is something that gets shareholders

08:29.000 --> 08:31.000
excited anymore.

08:31.000 --> 08:34.000
Keep up the good content, thanks, JVP.

08:34.000 --> 08:36.000
I think his point in here about Windows 10 compatibility

08:36.000 --> 08:39.000
and Windows compatibility getting hyped up,

08:39.000 --> 08:41.000
every time we've talked about that, in the back of my mind,

08:41.000 --> 08:44.000
I've always been like, is that really everyone's experience?

08:44.000 --> 08:48.000
Because a large part of my IT career was solving compatibility issues

08:48.000 --> 08:52.000
between Windows issues and software that corporations just had to run.

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
I agree with him here.

08:54.000 --> 08:58.000
I think Windows 10 gets sort of like this Solaris-like credit for compatibility

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
that just isn't fully deserved.

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
There's some, for sure, but I don't think it's fully deserved.

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
Can we just exclude Windows 8?

09:04.000 --> 09:05.000
Yeah.

09:05.000 --> 09:08.000
And then I feel more correct in that it was compatible the whole time?

09:08.000 --> 09:11.000
Yeah, and I'm still not biting on the storyline that Microsoft

09:11.000 --> 09:15.000
is going to make a reverse WSL to make Windows run on Linux.

09:15.000 --> 09:18.000
I don't know if I'm seeing that.

09:18.000 --> 09:19.000
We'll see.

09:19.000 --> 09:23.000
You know I was hot on it, and I feel bad that I forgot who wrote the post,

09:23.000 --> 09:26.000
but there was that post we covered a few weeks ago basically saying...

09:26.000 --> 09:27.000
It was Hayden.

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
It was Hayden, right, that people like me were on crack,

09:29.000 --> 09:32.000
and yeah, I've seen the error of my ways.

09:32.000 --> 09:35.000
Okay, I think this is our last Dark Matter Developer one.

09:35.000 --> 09:37.000
This is Cold Fusion Hell.

09:37.000 --> 09:39.000
That's a little redundant, but okay.

09:39.000 --> 09:40.000
I know, right?

09:40.000 --> 09:42.000
It's a cold fusion day in hell.

09:42.000 --> 09:45.000
Anonymous writes, I wanted to give my two cents as a Dark Matter Developer.

09:45.000 --> 09:49.000
I used to work at an MSP that only did government work.

09:49.000 --> 09:52.000
Most of the devs worked their nine to five hours and were good at their jobs,

09:52.000 --> 09:55.000
but had zero desire to learn more.

09:55.000 --> 09:58.000
We had one modern application written C sharp,

09:58.000 --> 10:02.000
but most of our work was supporting ancient web apps using CFML,

10:02.000 --> 10:06.000
which, by the way, is Cold Fusion markup language.

10:06.000 --> 10:10.000
It screws up my life, he says, in more colorful terms.

10:10.000 --> 10:14.000
Having to use CFML along with its terrible sibling, Cold Fusion Server,

10:14.000 --> 10:17.000
ended up being one of the main reasons I quit,

10:17.000 --> 10:20.000
as I didn't want to get left behind technologically.

10:20.000 --> 10:24.000
Now, this is something I've wondered if Dark Matter Developers worry about this,

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
is if they get stuck and strapped to these old techs

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
if they feel like the industry is leaving them behind.

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
Now, we haven't got a lot of emails that have said that,

10:30.000 --> 10:33.000
but this one from Anonymous does seem to address that.

10:33.000 --> 10:36.000
He goes on to say, CFML does have its perks.

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
It's super easy to create a decent database connection,

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
and the server GUI was simple to use,

10:40.000 --> 10:44.000
but there are many reasons why it's not very popular.

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
Sort of like Seuss, he says.

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
Seriously, it's in there.

10:48.000 --> 10:51.000
All this said, I think there's a direct correlation

10:51.000 --> 10:53.000
between what a dev has to work on

10:53.000 --> 10:55.000
and their desire to learn more and be better.

10:55.000 --> 11:00.000
Working day in and day out on boring government applications is soul sucking.

11:00.000 --> 11:03.000
Well, I'm glad you got out of Cold Fusion hell.

11:03.000 --> 11:06.000
That was our Dark Matter Developer feedback,

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
and I felt like that was a pretty good batch.

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
We're still receiving your feedback.

11:10.000 --> 11:13.000
We'll probably be featuring less and less in the show,

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
but we actually don't mind still receiving it.

11:15.000 --> 11:17.000
It helps inform our opinion,

11:17.000 --> 11:19.000
and if there was something particular that was great,

11:19.000 --> 11:21.000
I'd promote it up to the show.

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
linode.com slash coder.

11:23.000 --> 11:28.000
Go there for a $100 60-day credit towards a new account.

11:28.000 --> 11:31.000
Linode is cloud hosting done just right.

11:31.000 --> 11:33.000
If you're a total beginner,

11:33.000 --> 11:35.000
they've got a way for you to get things done.

11:35.000 --> 11:37.000
But if you're an expert, if you're a pro,

11:37.000 --> 11:39.000
you know what you're doing with the server,

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
then Linode is unlike any other service out there.

11:41.000 --> 11:44.000
They're going to give you full access to the backend

11:44.000 --> 11:47.000
and control to your server so you can make it fit your needs.

11:47.000 --> 11:49.000
They've got a DNS manager that'll let you switch

11:49.000 --> 11:51.000
and change all of the DNS stuff you need.

11:51.000 --> 11:54.000
The disk manager to set up new disks is great.

11:54.000 --> 11:58.000
All of that is what I consider to be table stakes at Linode.

11:58.000 --> 12:01.000
But on top of that, they have things like object storage

12:01.000 --> 12:04.000
and Kubernetes support and Terraform support

12:04.000 --> 12:07.000
and node balancers and alert integration.

12:07.000 --> 12:10.000
See, they started in 2003 as one of the first companies

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
in cloud computing, so they've had some time

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
to figure out what customers really like.

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
I mean, this was three years before AWS.

12:16.000 --> 12:18.000
They had people putting their infrastructure

12:18.000 --> 12:21.000
in production three years before AWS,

12:21.000 --> 12:23.000
and they're independently owned through all of it.

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
They were founded on a love for Linux

12:25.000 --> 12:26.000
and open source technologies.

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
And I started using them a couple of years ago,

12:28.000 --> 12:31.000
and now all of JB's infrastructure runs on that.

12:31.000 --> 12:35.000
We have one physical server now.

12:35.000 --> 12:39.000
When I started doing this with Mike 200 years ago,

12:39.000 --> 12:42.000
we were still at the phase where the servers

12:42.000 --> 12:45.000
were in racks in data centers.

12:45.000 --> 12:48.000
And we actually had a two-week lead-up process

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
before we could get an additional server in the rack.

12:50.000 --> 12:53.000
And then I actually had to pay for its power

12:53.000 --> 12:55.000
and all of its transfer.

12:55.000 --> 12:59.000
And now with Linode, you can get a $100 60-day credit,

12:59.000 --> 13:02.000
and their base rigs start at $5 a month.

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
So if you just need something like an SSH jump host

13:04.000 --> 13:07.000
or a VPN endpoint, that's great,

13:07.000 --> 13:09.000
and you could do a lot of other things with that rig too.

13:09.000 --> 13:13.000
But you can go with something that has a lot of CPUs

13:13.000 --> 13:14.000
or a lot of GPUs.

13:14.000 --> 13:17.000
What we do is we offload our encoding now.

13:17.000 --> 13:21.000
Our editors submit a FLAC file to a server on Linode,

13:21.000 --> 13:23.000
and then it does all of the heavy lifting,

13:23.000 --> 13:26.000
all of the encoding to the various video versions

13:26.000 --> 13:29.000
and audio versions, all server-side on a Linode.

13:29.000 --> 13:31.000
So if you need something simple or you need something

13:31.000 --> 13:34.000
with a lot of performance, they're going to have you covered.

13:34.000 --> 13:37.000
And they're usually 30% to 50% cheaper

13:37.000 --> 13:39.000
than any of the other big commercial providers,

13:39.000 --> 13:41.000
so you'll save money too.

13:41.000 --> 13:46.000
And they have a 99.9% SLA, so uptime is pretty great.

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
I don't think you're going to have any problems with that.

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
So with the prices, it's cheap enough to learn,

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
and you can dial it in for production

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
and still save a ton of money.

13:54.000 --> 13:55.000
So go check them out.

13:55.000 --> 13:57.000
They provide virtual servers that make it easy and affordable

13:57.000 --> 13:59.000
for you to host anything in the cloud,

13:59.000 --> 14:01.000
from games to applications to a resume

14:01.000 --> 14:03.000
to your company's backend infrastructure.

14:03.000 --> 14:04.000
It's all there.

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
Linode is dedicated to offering the best

14:06.000 --> 14:07.000
virtualized cloud computing.

14:07.000 --> 14:10.000
If it runs on Linux, it runs on Linode.

14:10.000 --> 14:12.000
So go to linode.com slash coder.

14:12.000 --> 14:13.000
You support the show.

14:13.000 --> 14:14.000
You let them know you heard it here.

14:14.000 --> 14:18.000
You get that $100 credit for a new account for 60 days,

14:18.000 --> 14:20.000
and you get the whole process started.

14:20.000 --> 14:23.000
You support the show, get something great, linode.com slash coder.

14:23.000 --> 14:26.000
And a big thank you to Linode for sponsoring the Coder Radio program,

14:26.000 --> 14:29.000
linode.com slash coder.

14:29.000 --> 14:32.000
We touched on a couple of nerves right out of the gate.

14:32.000 --> 14:36.000
Hans writes in, talking about being in development hell.

14:36.000 --> 14:37.000
He says, hello, guys.

14:37.000 --> 14:38.000
Love your show.

14:38.000 --> 14:39.000
Please keep it up.

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
A couple of times over the recent episodes,

14:41.000 --> 14:43.000
the topic of Apple's relationship to developers came up.

14:43.000 --> 14:46.000
You postulated that they put users, profit,

14:46.000 --> 14:51.000
and pretty much everything else above developers on their platform.

14:51.000 --> 14:55.000
Well, I work on iOS apps for a living for a large corporation,

14:55.000 --> 14:58.000
and I think Apple is doing a good job in a lot of areas.

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
They have great devices.

15:00.000 --> 15:03.000
The annual iPhone update seems to be getting more marginal every year,

15:03.000 --> 15:04.000
but it's still a pretty good update.

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
Swift is an awesome programming language.

15:06.000 --> 15:09.000
Nobody likes square brackets and semicolons except Mr. Dominic.

15:09.000 --> 15:12.000
Clearly, this email is written by an insane person.

15:12.000 --> 15:14.000
Yeah, well, we'll get to that, too.

15:14.000 --> 15:16.000
But that being said, here we go.

15:16.000 --> 15:20.000
That all being said, Mike could not be more right.

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
He's healed.

15:22.000 --> 15:25.000
Developers are clearly a second-class citizen on their systems.

15:25.000 --> 15:29.000
However, what annoys me even more is they claim Mac OS is, quote,

15:29.000 --> 15:31.000
the world's best system for developers.

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
The best system for developers?

15:33.000 --> 15:34.000
My ass.

15:34.000 --> 15:37.000
First of all, GNU userland tools eat their BSD counterparts

15:37.000 --> 15:40.000
that ship with Mac OS for breakfast.

15:40.000 --> 15:43.000
Ever found a Stack Overflow answer about how to do something with set or grep

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
and then realized it doesn't work on your Mac?

15:45.000 --> 15:49.000
Then every year at WWDC, they tell us how they've rewritten half of Xcode

15:49.000 --> 15:52.000
and how it's X percent faster.

15:52.000 --> 15:56.000
Yet in 2020, it still crashes when I switch between Git branches,

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
can't reliably do incremental builds,

15:58.000 --> 16:02.000
and overall, beach balls left and right, clogging up the whole system.

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
The spicy take right there.

16:04.000 --> 16:07.000
And one I've heard echoed, I got to say.

16:07.000 --> 16:08.000
But they don't stop there.

16:08.000 --> 16:11.000
Not only do they force us to use their crappy IDE,

16:11.000 --> 16:14.000
they also require us to run their CI machines on Mac OS,

16:14.000 --> 16:17.000
an operating system without a headless mode

16:17.000 --> 16:20.000
and without any reliable machine orchestration framework.

16:20.000 --> 16:24.000
Administering Mac OS build server means regularly logging into a graphical user interface

16:24.000 --> 16:28.000
to confirm dialogues or install updates by hand.

16:28.000 --> 16:34.000
Could any system Windows Apart be less suitable for running a CI machine?

16:34.000 --> 16:35.000
Or take Docker.

16:35.000 --> 16:39.000
It runs on Mac OS, but the performance is light years worse than on Linux

16:39.000 --> 16:42.000
because the absence of the Linux kernel means it has to resort to virtualization.

16:42.000 --> 16:47.000
In my opinion, Mac OS is far from being, quote, the best choice for developers.

16:47.000 --> 16:48.000
Linux obviously is.

16:48.000 --> 16:51.000
Honestly, with the direction Microsoft is heading into,

16:51.000 --> 16:54.000
I would even say Windows is starting to be a better choice than Mac OS.

16:54.000 --> 16:59.000
I think developers use Macs because you need a Mac to publish apps on Apple's platform

16:59.000 --> 17:00.000
and they're pretty sexy machines.

17:00.000 --> 17:01.000
That's all.

17:01.000 --> 17:03.000
Just my two cents, Hans.

17:03.000 --> 17:07.000
Yeah, so one of the mysteries of the universe as far as I'm concerned

17:07.000 --> 17:10.000
is how so much money and effort goes into Xcode

17:10.000 --> 17:13.000
and it's always half busted.

17:13.000 --> 17:18.000
It's got to be that they're constantly having to add stuff to keep up with the phone production, right?

17:18.000 --> 17:21.000
New screen shapes, new features in chips,

17:21.000 --> 17:25.000
and just stuff that they have to constantly be working to support in Xcode, I guess.

17:25.000 --> 17:29.000
Well, I know Xcode got briefly better and then when Swift came out,

17:29.000 --> 17:35.000
they had to add all the Swift support, which was just dog terrible in terms of performance.

17:35.000 --> 17:37.000
Like, awful.

17:37.000 --> 17:40.000
Now, that's because Swift is an inferior language.

17:40.000 --> 17:42.000
Nailed that right off the bat.

17:42.000 --> 17:43.000
Right.

17:43.000 --> 17:49.000
In terms of the BSD tools, yeah, okay, but a couple years ago,

17:49.000 --> 17:52.000
you had pointed out that when you're on a Mac,

17:52.000 --> 17:55.000
you're generally using proprietary paid graphical tools, right?

17:55.000 --> 17:58.000
And I think that your average developer working in a Mac full time

17:58.000 --> 18:01.000
who doesn't like touch Linux in particular

18:01.000 --> 18:05.000
doesn't really think in terms of like I'm going to script my way to glory

18:05.000 --> 18:09.000
and pipe everything from crept to whatever, blah, blah, blah.

18:09.000 --> 18:11.000
Now, some do, right?

18:11.000 --> 18:16.000
When I work on a Mac, I still constantly get mad that ZShell is different than Bash

18:16.000 --> 18:17.000
because I keep forgetting.

18:17.000 --> 18:18.000
Sure.

18:18.000 --> 18:19.000
I don't know, right?

18:19.000 --> 18:22.000
I don't know why this is –

18:22.000 --> 18:25.000
and Chris, you're going to have to correct me here.

18:25.000 --> 18:32.000
I would think that like Apple would want developing iOS apps to be super not frustrating

18:32.000 --> 18:38.000
considering it's actually an expensive thing to do and it's just a brutal marketplace.

18:38.000 --> 18:42.000
But yeah, they seem – maybe it is just like the rapid cadence of iOS

18:42.000 --> 18:46.000
that they have to keep adding crap to Xcode and it keeps bloating it.

18:46.000 --> 18:51.000
I would suggest and it is an absolute crime that they don't sponsor this show,

18:51.000 --> 18:54.000
JetBrains does have app code.

18:54.000 --> 18:56.000
It is good.

18:56.000 --> 19:00.000
It does suffer from the third party tool working in the Apple ecosystem curse

19:00.000 --> 19:05.000
of every year they get hammered by Apple because they have to catch up.

19:05.000 --> 19:06.000
But yeah, Xcode is awful.

19:06.000 --> 19:09.000
I just had a problem this week where I was working on my Mac

19:09.000 --> 19:13.000
and it was just inconvenient to like switch machines back to the Lemur

19:13.000 --> 19:15.000
because it's just annoying.

19:15.000 --> 19:19.000
But somehow in the background, the Mac App Store had updated Xcode,

19:19.000 --> 19:21.000
which whatever, right?

19:21.000 --> 19:26.000
But that breaks my command line tools like GCC, which I was coding in Ruby.

19:26.000 --> 19:30.000
So that's kind of important because all the Ruby –

19:30.000 --> 19:34.000
many of the gems have to compile C++ extensions or C extensions.

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
And that's just like a dumb problem to have.

19:36.000 --> 19:37.000
I then had to open Xcode.

19:37.000 --> 19:41.000
Like I just had to know that I had to do the Xcode select thing

19:41.000 --> 19:45.000
and make sure like re-simulink or reinstalls whatever it had to do.

19:45.000 --> 19:48.000
In my case, GCC, but there's a bunch of stuff it does.

19:48.000 --> 19:49.000
That's really stupid.

19:49.000 --> 19:51.000
Yeah, it feels old and busted.

19:51.000 --> 19:55.000
It reminds me of the old days on Windows when like you need to install Visual Studio

19:55.000 --> 19:57.000
if you would like to have C++ at all.

19:57.000 --> 19:58.000
Yeah.

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
I mean, I'm obviously a little biased,

20:00.000 --> 20:04.000
but I feel like Mac OS sort of lost its competitive edge

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
as a developer's workstation.

20:06.000 --> 20:09.000
I think it really did offer something special early on.

20:09.000 --> 20:13.000
Years ago, there wasn't really a great laptop solution.

20:13.000 --> 20:16.000
I mean, when Macs really kind of started kicking off for developers

20:16.000 --> 20:21.000
is when the Transition x86 came and Wi-Fi was rough on Linux.

20:21.000 --> 20:24.000
Power management was rough on Linux.

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
The desktop UIs were new.

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
Plasma was just a new version.

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
Gnome Shell was just a new version.

20:30.000 --> 20:35.000
And Apple came along and by the time x86 shipped on the Apple platform,

20:35.000 --> 20:38.000
which is ironic because they're about to switch to ARM now,

20:38.000 --> 20:42.000
but by the time the x86 Mac started to ship, Mac OS was in a good place.

20:42.000 --> 20:44.000
Adobe was fully on board.

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
Microsoft was fully on board.

20:46.000 --> 20:51.000
You could get a Mac with actual real legit Microsoft Office

20:51.000 --> 20:54.000
and Adobe Photoshop and Internet Explorer

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
and whatever else you needed back then.

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
Yes, Internet Explorer was one of the things.

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
And you could get a real Unix command line.

21:00.000 --> 21:05.000
Proprietary applications, polished UI, Unix command line.

21:05.000 --> 21:10.000
That was a great combination and it sold millions of MacBooks,

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
no doubt about it.

21:12.000 --> 21:17.000
But as time went on, the cloud became more and more dominated by Linux.

21:17.000 --> 21:22.000
Shipping applications as containers became commonplace.

21:22.000 --> 21:25.000
The desktop side of Linux got a lot better.

21:25.000 --> 21:27.000
It got a lot more professional.

21:27.000 --> 21:33.000
Vendors like Dell, HP, and Lenovo are all now selling Linux laptops.

21:33.000 --> 21:37.000
System76 and companies like them have their game brought up to the next level.

21:37.000 --> 21:41.000
They've spent this last decade iterating and learning like crazy.

21:41.000 --> 21:44.000
And so you have this common runtime aspect,

21:44.000 --> 21:47.000
this general technology platform that is Linux.

21:47.000 --> 21:51.000
And it's so easy to get a Linux workstation for development set up and going

21:51.000 --> 21:53.000
because you have repositories of software.

21:53.000 --> 21:56.000
You have command line tools to install your software.

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
It's things developers love.

21:58.000 --> 22:01.000
And Microsoft is quickly adopting much of this.

22:01.000 --> 22:04.000
Meanwhile, Apple has been heads down on the iPhone.

22:04.000 --> 22:09.000
And they just have let the Mac as a core concept kind of age.

22:09.000 --> 22:11.000
They've updated the UI here and there.

22:11.000 --> 22:12.000
They've updated the Mac line.

22:12.000 --> 22:15.000
They're making a big investment in a transition to ARM.

22:15.000 --> 22:19.000
But fundamentally, it's not going to change the fact that Mac OS just isn't

22:19.000 --> 22:21.000
an ideal development platform anymore.

22:21.000 --> 22:25.000
And you can spend time getting Mac OS tweaked and installing dozens of

22:25.000 --> 22:29.000
third-party tools that will cost you a minimum of $5, go as high as $35,

22:29.000 --> 22:31.000
and you'll need to get 10 of those installed.

22:31.000 --> 22:32.000
You can kind of get there.

22:32.000 --> 22:35.000
Or you can just like descend into homebrew hell, right?

22:35.000 --> 22:37.000
Yeah, yes, absolutely right.

22:37.000 --> 22:40.000
I think they've lost their competitive edge to a large degree.

22:40.000 --> 22:44.000
And the transition to ARM will probably help, but not a full solution.

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
Oh, I think it's going to help a lot.

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
So I'm bringing you some Applewood bacon today.

22:48.000 --> 22:49.000
Oh, really?

22:49.000 --> 22:50.000
I set you right up for this.

22:50.000 --> 22:51.000
You know, I was okay.

22:51.000 --> 22:53.000
I mean, I was going to go lizard, but we'll go bacon.

22:53.000 --> 22:54.000
Let's do it.

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
We do not eat or harm lizards in any way.

22:56.000 --> 22:57.000
People do.

22:57.000 --> 22:58.000
People do.

22:58.000 --> 22:59.000
Fried lizard could be a thing.

22:59.000 --> 23:03.000
It has burned into my brain with a smoky sort of sweet maple aroma that

23:03.000 --> 23:05.000
they showed GNOME.

23:05.000 --> 23:07.000
Yes, it's GNOME, not gnome.

23:07.000 --> 23:09.000
Please don't get me all that.

23:09.000 --> 23:12.000
And I'll put the link on their Apple Silicon demo.

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
I don't think the folks at Apple are stupid.

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
I think many of them are very smart developers, right?

23:16.000 --> 23:19.000
And they know that they're by their own admission,

23:19.000 --> 23:21.000
their biggest pro market is devs.

23:21.000 --> 23:25.000
I think just like is always the case, Apple is a little slow to the game.

23:25.000 --> 23:29.000
But I think they're going to do something Linuxy or maybe they'll embrace

23:29.000 --> 23:31.000
the dark side of BSD even further.

23:31.000 --> 23:32.000
Right?

23:32.000 --> 23:35.000
I really don't think they're just going to see this market because they're

23:35.000 --> 23:36.000
not stupid, right?

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
They're not going to.

23:38.000 --> 23:40.640
They're not going to let Dell sell a bunch of XPS 13s

23:40.640 --> 23:46.400
or System 76, but whatever, the Lemur, the Darter.

23:46.400 --> 23:48.680
I don't see them giving this up this easily.

23:48.680 --> 23:53.320
Now, I do see some sort of insane virtualization thing

23:53.320 --> 23:57.200
because of the, I think, pretty impressive performance

23:57.200 --> 24:00.320
they're going to get on Apple Silicon.

24:00.320 --> 24:04.200
But I think people are ringing the death

24:04.200 --> 24:05.560
bell a little early here.

24:05.560 --> 24:07.760
Well, you're convincing me in two regards.

24:07.760 --> 24:10.680
Number one, I vividly remember them demoing

24:10.680 --> 24:12.840
GNOME Shell up on stage.

24:12.840 --> 24:13.920
And they made a point.

24:13.920 --> 24:15.880
Yeah, and they were particularly talking

24:15.880 --> 24:19.360
about accelerated Linux virtualization.

24:19.360 --> 24:20.440
Yeah, that, you're right.

24:20.440 --> 24:23.560
And that does seem to indicate a bit of a tell,

24:23.560 --> 24:24.880
I guess you could say.

24:24.880 --> 24:28.640
The other thing is it is a classic Apple maneuver

24:28.640 --> 24:31.280
to wait just a little too long to the point

24:31.280 --> 24:34.120
where everybody's like, what the hell's going on here?

24:34.120 --> 24:35.680
They've lost it.

24:35.680 --> 24:36.920
They've dropped the ball here.

24:36.920 --> 24:38.240
What's going on, Apple?

24:38.240 --> 24:41.240
When you start having people in the technology crowd

24:41.240 --> 24:44.240
that are talking like that, you wait another six months,

24:44.240 --> 24:47.440
and that's usually when Apple will come up with something.

24:47.440 --> 24:49.320
You've just seen them do this over and over again

24:49.320 --> 24:50.200
over the decades.

24:50.200 --> 24:53.060
They are often a little late, but they generally

24:53.060 --> 24:54.440
execute really well.

24:54.440 --> 24:57.080
And so I could see that also proving your point.

24:57.080 --> 24:57.880
We'll have to see.

24:57.880 --> 24:59.240
We may find out more.

24:59.240 --> 25:02.280
But speaking of lizards, Hans did have a postscript.

25:02.280 --> 25:06.320
He says, I've been laughing my ass off about the Seuss jokes,

25:06.320 --> 25:07.200
but don't bash them.

25:07.200 --> 25:08.280
It's not so bad.

25:08.280 --> 25:10.640
I mean, yes, I'm from Germany.

25:10.640 --> 25:13.680
That goes without saying, Hans.

25:13.680 --> 25:16.580
And yes, I have a little bit of a corporate background

25:16.580 --> 25:18.480
where I have to use it, he says.

25:18.480 --> 25:20.520
But I think it's a rather well-made system.

25:20.520 --> 25:21.680
And you said it himself.

25:21.680 --> 25:22.400
He's a crazy guy.

25:22.400 --> 25:24.320
So he's a Seuss guy.

25:24.320 --> 25:26.760
So just a little data point for us.

25:26.760 --> 25:28.720
And he's German, too, which also seems

25:28.720 --> 25:31.000
to be quite common among the Seuss users.

25:31.000 --> 25:34.880
Well, you know, when an IT person declares himself

25:34.880 --> 25:39.200
in Germany, they actually hand you a Seuss laptop.

25:39.200 --> 25:41.320
I don't know what's going on with you at this point,

25:41.320 --> 25:44.720
because I'm getting tweets from you that I think

25:44.720 --> 25:46.240
are just designed to troll me.

25:46.240 --> 25:50.760
You even pinned a Seuss a tweet on your Twitter timeline.

25:50.760 --> 25:52.520
I was wondering if you'd see that.

25:52.520 --> 25:53.720
Oh, I noticed.

25:53.720 --> 25:54.760
Oh, I noticed.

25:54.760 --> 25:58.200
So I get this tweet the other night.

25:58.200 --> 26:00.700
Hey, Chris, I'm moving another server to hashtag Seuss,

26:00.700 --> 26:03.240
and it feels so good.

26:03.240 --> 26:06.200
And of course, everybody on Twitter notices.

26:06.200 --> 26:09.720
And I feel like perhaps the audience and I

26:09.720 --> 26:12.120
need to stage some kind of intervention with you.

26:12.120 --> 26:14.720
This only ends in you quitting Linux, I feel.

26:14.720 --> 26:15.880
This is what happens.

26:15.880 --> 26:18.720
You go this route, it ends in you quitting Linux.

26:18.720 --> 26:21.120
All right, you know what?

26:21.120 --> 26:24.080
I've been Perry Mason defending my reptilian client

26:24.080 --> 26:25.600
for several weeks now.

26:25.600 --> 26:27.400
What's the case for the prosecution?

26:27.400 --> 26:30.240
What is wrong with open Seuss server?

26:30.240 --> 26:32.800
I'm using Seuss as an umbrella.

26:32.800 --> 26:34.840
Well, I'd say a couple of things.

26:34.840 --> 26:36.320
It is an oddball distribution.

26:36.320 --> 26:38.880
Some things are just done a little bit differently.

26:38.880 --> 26:41.640
No other distribution has Yast, so it's sort of a sunk cost.

26:41.640 --> 26:43.840
Anything you learn in Yast is not going to really apply

26:43.840 --> 26:45.120
to any other distribution.

26:45.120 --> 26:47.800
I'd say additionally, it feels old in a lot of ways.

26:47.800 --> 26:50.600
It has some Slackware heritage, the layout, the design.

26:50.600 --> 26:52.160
In some ways, it just feel old.

26:52.160 --> 26:53.520
Additionally, one of the things that I've

26:53.520 --> 26:55.480
noticed at a global level of the project,

26:55.480 --> 26:58.720
and they're going to hate that I say this, but I mean, it's true.

26:58.720 --> 26:59.880
They already hate you, don't worry.

26:59.880 --> 27:02.200
They have a little bit of not invented here syndrome.

27:02.200 --> 27:05.400
And it does result in great results and great products,

27:05.400 --> 27:07.440
but it also results in them investing

27:07.440 --> 27:11.040
a ton of time and effort into stuff that nobody ever touches.

27:11.040 --> 27:12.440
I'll give you a couple of examples.

27:12.440 --> 27:15.280
Open build service, absolutely brilliant.

27:15.280 --> 27:19.120
It could be a public service for the free software community,

27:19.120 --> 27:21.580
and it really hasn't seen much growth at all.

27:21.580 --> 27:23.000
It's got adoption by some.

27:23.000 --> 27:25.320
Nobody really, it never really gets traction, though.

27:25.320 --> 27:27.760
If Canonical or Red Hat did the same thing,

27:27.760 --> 27:30.600
it would be the number one thing in, like I mean, look.

27:30.600 --> 27:33.280
When Flatpak and Snaps came out, it's all we talk about now.

27:33.280 --> 27:35.000
Meanwhile, open SUSE build service

27:35.000 --> 27:37.400
has been around for 200 years.

27:37.400 --> 27:40.320
There's also things like, they try to do things

27:40.320 --> 27:43.120
before anybody else, but nobody follows their lead,

27:43.120 --> 27:44.760
because they're kind of insignificant.

27:44.760 --> 27:46.500
So they don't really end up being a trendsetter,

27:46.500 --> 27:47.960
so much as just different.

27:47.960 --> 27:50.400
And their implementation of ButterFS

27:50.400 --> 27:52.400
is a fantastic example of this.

27:52.400 --> 27:54.680
Way ahead of the pack, first they were on RiserFS,

27:54.680 --> 27:56.380
but nobody switched to that.

27:56.380 --> 27:58.520
And then Hans turned out to be a murderer,

27:58.520 --> 28:01.280
and not really working on the project

28:01.280 --> 28:02.400
after he got sent to jail.

28:02.400 --> 28:07.240
So they quietly transitioned off of RiserFS to ButterFS,

28:07.240 --> 28:08.680
and they've been there for years.

28:08.680 --> 28:11.080
And meanwhile, nobody used it.

28:11.080 --> 28:13.320
And ZFS got more and more popular.

28:13.320 --> 28:15.860
ZFS got notoriety on Ubuntu,

28:15.860 --> 28:19.800
and Canonical built it into their LTS version of Linux.

28:19.800 --> 28:22.880
And now, finally, after all these years,

28:22.880 --> 28:26.440
because not by any doing of SUSE,

28:26.440 --> 28:28.320
Fedora is now shipping ButterFS.

28:28.320 --> 28:30.080
And Fedora can say, look, the SUSE guys did it,

28:30.080 --> 28:30.920
and it was fine.

28:30.920 --> 28:33.280
And that's about the extent of their contribution

28:33.280 --> 28:36.280
and impact on shaping the landscape of desktop Linux.

28:36.280 --> 28:38.000
And it's, I don't say this with joy,

28:38.000 --> 28:39.600
I don't get any pleasure from this,

28:39.600 --> 28:41.600
but just having observed SUSE,

28:41.600 --> 28:44.160
they kind of just seem to be off into a world of their own.

28:44.160 --> 28:45.440
They sometimes get it right,

28:45.440 --> 28:47.640
and sometimes get it really kind of better

28:47.640 --> 28:48.920
than anybody else.

28:48.920 --> 28:51.280
But it doesn't really change anything.

28:51.280 --> 28:53.400
It doesn't really change the way the rest of Linux works.

28:53.400 --> 28:55.520
So it's not like you have some advantage

28:55.520 --> 28:57.800
by being on SUSE and you learn how the new thing works

28:57.800 --> 28:59.320
before anybody else is doing it.

28:59.320 --> 29:01.040
You just learn how it works the SUSE way.

29:01.040 --> 29:04.240
And that is even true of their ButterFS implementation.

29:04.240 --> 29:06.580
They have their very own unique ButterFS implementation.

29:06.580 --> 29:08.920
So I guess when I look at it,

29:08.920 --> 29:10.960
I look at it as a bit of an oddball distro

29:10.960 --> 29:13.040
that doesn't have a lot of community support,

29:13.040 --> 29:15.560
that doesn't have a particularly strong brand

29:15.560 --> 29:19.300
compared to its competitors, which are just dominant.

29:19.300 --> 29:23.520
And I don't see a lot of density in cloud deployments either,

29:23.520 --> 29:26.360
which I think is a bellwether for the future of the distro.

29:26.360 --> 29:28.860
You don't see entire stacks of containers

29:28.860 --> 29:30.640
built off of SUSE.

29:30.640 --> 29:32.360
You don't see tens of thousands

29:32.360 --> 29:35.200
or millions of deployments on AWS.

29:35.200 --> 29:38.120
You have to go to a provider that really knows Linux

29:38.120 --> 29:39.960
to get SUSE really, like Linode.

29:39.960 --> 29:41.000
Linode has SUSE,

29:41.000 --> 29:43.640
but that's because they're a bunch of Linux geeks.

29:43.640 --> 29:46.480
And I think that has gotten a little better over time,

29:46.480 --> 29:49.720
but it still pales in comparison to CentOS

29:49.720 --> 29:54.660
or Debian or Ubuntu's deployment on VPSs and cloud services.

29:54.660 --> 29:56.180
So that's part of it.

29:56.180 --> 29:58.880
Yeah, I mean, I don't really see a market share

29:58.880 --> 30:00.920
as something I necessarily care about.

30:00.920 --> 30:04.560
Also, to be super clear, I'm talking about server side, right?

30:04.560 --> 30:05.400
Right, right, right.

30:05.400 --> 30:07.040
So, you know.

30:07.040 --> 30:08.880
I mean, I think it's a decent product.

30:08.880 --> 30:11.160
Yeah, I think you're a little dismissive

30:11.160 --> 30:12.540
of the build service though.

30:12.540 --> 30:13.640
I gotta be honest with you.

30:13.640 --> 30:17.560
Yeah, well, just because like it hasn't gone anywhere.

30:17.560 --> 30:20.800
Like it got some adoption and, you know,

30:20.800 --> 30:22.600
like even some, like you might say,

30:22.600 --> 30:24.100
competing projects use it.

30:24.100 --> 30:26.360
And that is a cool statement

30:26.360 --> 30:28.680
from like a community standpoint.

30:28.680 --> 30:30.400
But beyond that,

30:30.400 --> 30:33.360
like nobody's deploying software at scale with it

30:33.360 --> 30:34.200
in a commercial space.

30:34.200 --> 30:35.600
What do you mean it hasn't gone anywhere?

30:35.600 --> 30:37.360
Of all like the competing products,

30:37.360 --> 30:39.380
I mean, this is a risky opinion

30:39.380 --> 30:41.800
because we're talking packaging now,

30:41.800 --> 30:44.000
but I think it solves it in the best way.

30:44.000 --> 30:45.240
No, I actually agree with you.

30:45.240 --> 30:46.800
I think it does.

30:46.800 --> 30:49.500
And I think it's the one that's most approachable

30:49.500 --> 30:50.340
by the community.

30:50.340 --> 30:53.440
Anybody, you don't have to be a SUSE user

30:53.440 --> 30:56.000
to use the open SUSE build service.

30:56.000 --> 30:57.700
You also forgot Rancher, right?

30:57.700 --> 31:00.300
Now will they take it and make it SUSEfied?

31:00.300 --> 31:01.140
I don't know.

31:01.140 --> 31:02.400
I guess the bet is,

31:02.400 --> 31:04.100
the bet is that they're gonna build up

31:04.100 --> 31:06.660
a bigger and bigger presence on on-premises

31:06.660 --> 31:07.840
and on some server cases,

31:07.840 --> 31:09.460
and that there's an ecosystem there

31:09.460 --> 31:10.760
that you could become an expert on

31:10.760 --> 31:11.760
and kind of differentiate.

31:11.760 --> 31:13.240
I guess that might be the bet.

31:13.240 --> 31:16.360
The bet is there are basically two viable options

31:16.360 --> 31:18.040
and the canonical people are gonna get really mad.

31:18.040 --> 31:20.520
But right now there are really two viable options

31:20.520 --> 31:22.480
for regulated spaces in the US

31:22.480 --> 31:23.900
in terms of Linux distros.

31:23.900 --> 31:24.840
Yeah, yeah.

31:24.840 --> 31:27.360
It's RHEL, who is owned by IBM,

31:27.360 --> 31:30.280
who is a consulting company, right?

31:30.280 --> 31:32.680
That's automatically problematic for me.

31:32.680 --> 31:33.780
And it's expensive.

31:33.780 --> 31:34.620
And it's expensive.

31:34.620 --> 31:37.160
And there's SUSE who has a much smaller presence here.

31:37.160 --> 31:38.000
And let's not forget,

31:38.000 --> 31:40.920
I am laying fiber optic cable and building a data center.

31:40.920 --> 31:41.920
True.

31:41.920 --> 31:44.020
So the way I would probably build that myself

31:44.020 --> 31:49.020
is an Ubuntu or CentOS virtualizer host.

31:49.020 --> 31:52.920
And then I would run SUSE and VMs for the applications

31:52.920 --> 31:53.760
that need it.

31:53.760 --> 31:56.580
Well, I will say buying hardware with SUSE on it,

31:56.580 --> 32:00.260
or SUSE on it, is surprisingly challenging.

32:00.260 --> 32:02.740
Kuzuntai is what they say when you ask for SUSE.

32:02.740 --> 32:04.420
Yeah, they're like, did you mean Windows Server?

32:04.420 --> 32:05.660
Ha ha ha.

32:05.660 --> 32:06.940
Oh man, come on.

32:06.940 --> 32:09.220
So that is fair, right?

32:09.220 --> 32:10.180
Like that is one of,

32:10.180 --> 32:12.340
I would say the largest downside of SUSE,

32:12.340 --> 32:14.900
like it's weird to me that there are not more vendors

32:14.900 --> 32:16.500
offering SUSE services,

32:16.500 --> 32:18.940
which say that three times fast.

32:18.940 --> 32:21.460
Because it is like one of the accepted,

32:21.460 --> 32:23.180
like one of the two main accepted

32:23.180 --> 32:26.500
for regulated spaces, distros.

32:26.500 --> 32:27.340
Right?

32:27.340 --> 32:28.260
It just is.

32:28.260 --> 32:30.420
And the other one is RHEL, so.

32:30.420 --> 32:31.740
Yeah, that is definitely true.

32:31.740 --> 32:33.120
But I could also see maybe Ubuntu

32:33.120 --> 32:34.660
eventually working into that space.

32:34.660 --> 32:36.460
Well, Ubuntu is trying to get there, right?

32:36.460 --> 32:38.980
It's just, you know, it takes time.

32:38.980 --> 32:41.580
It's like you say SUSE is old and that's a problem.

32:41.580 --> 32:43.660
It's a problem if you're looking at it

32:43.660 --> 32:45.820
from an enthusiast perspective.

32:45.820 --> 32:46.880
If you're looking at it from,

32:46.880 --> 32:49.340
I never want to see a problem that hasn't already

32:49.340 --> 32:52.760
been solved or in terms of infrastructure level, right?

32:52.760 --> 32:55.560
Keeping these machines up, then that's a feature.

32:55.560 --> 32:58.860
I think maybe old isn't the right way to put it

32:58.860 --> 33:01.900
because of, you know, it's fresh packages, it's maintained.

33:01.900 --> 33:04.380
It is an old methodology.

33:04.380 --> 33:08.060
It's an old design principle of an operating system.

33:08.060 --> 33:11.580
It's the early days of Linux way of thinking.

33:11.580 --> 33:14.980
It's when we built Linux the way we built Slackware.

33:14.980 --> 33:17.220
Wow, you've really got to go all the way to Slackware, huh?

33:17.220 --> 33:18.920
I think, I believe that's what SUSE is based on.

33:18.920 --> 33:20.060
I think it is too, actually.

33:20.060 --> 33:20.900
Yeah.

33:20.900 --> 33:23.100
And I think that it shows a little bit

33:23.100 --> 33:26.220
compared to a Debian system or a RHEL system.

33:26.220 --> 33:28.300
Right, so there's a bit of dissonance, right?

33:28.300 --> 33:30.140
If you're coming from an Ubuntu background

33:30.140 --> 33:33.420
and then you're in SUSE, it's like at some point

33:33.420 --> 33:35.700
you have to unlearn what you have learned, right?

33:35.700 --> 33:37.700
Like, I don't know, was that Yoda?

33:37.700 --> 33:39.740
Probably.

33:39.740 --> 33:41.220
But you really have to just let go.

33:41.220 --> 33:44.320
You have to embrace the ask, you have to embrace Zipper

33:44.320 --> 33:47.180
and you have to think in a more reptilian way.

33:47.180 --> 33:50.180
But I got to tell you, it's very stable.

33:50.180 --> 33:52.460
It's running fine.

33:52.460 --> 33:53.700
We're using the build service.

33:53.700 --> 33:55.820
I mean, we're early days of setting this all up.

33:55.820 --> 33:59.140
But I don't know that I could ever not

33:59.140 --> 34:00.300
be using the build service.

34:00.300 --> 34:03.460
Even if in a year I'm like, ah, damn it, Chris, you are right.

34:03.460 --> 34:07.260
We're running everything on Fedora or CentOS now, right?

34:07.260 --> 34:09.220
I still would be trying to use the build service.

34:09.220 --> 34:10.140
I could see that.

34:10.140 --> 34:12.300
And I'm a little confused as to why

34:12.300 --> 34:15.140
this is not a more common opinion in the community.

34:15.140 --> 34:16.220
Me too, man.

34:16.220 --> 34:18.180
I have really wondered that, because it

34:18.180 --> 34:22.020
seems like a fantastic public service they're providing.

34:22.020 --> 34:25.660
Yeah, it's like I had a client this past week,

34:25.660 --> 34:28.940
so last week, right, call me and he

34:28.940 --> 34:31.260
had a question from one of his internal IT guys

34:31.260 --> 34:32.720
about packaging on Linux.

34:32.720 --> 34:34.660
Because you know why?

34:34.660 --> 34:36.340
It's just a pain in the butt.

34:36.340 --> 34:37.900
Yeah, and there's too many options.

34:37.900 --> 34:40.460
Too many options, and they all have weird trade-offs.

34:40.460 --> 34:44.940
And they ended up just doing PPAs, private PPAs.

34:44.940 --> 34:46.460
And for those listening who don't know,

34:46.460 --> 34:50.100
the build service will create distribution packages

34:50.100 --> 34:51.300
for all the major distros.

34:51.300 --> 34:53.100
You give it your software, and it'll

34:53.100 --> 34:55.980
handle the five different RPMs you'll

34:55.980 --> 34:58.340
need for all the different Fedoras and the dev packages

34:58.340 --> 35:00.220
and all of that.

35:00.220 --> 35:04.300
Even if I did end up having Ubuntu servers in front

35:04.300 --> 35:06.700
of the SUSE infrastructure, for instance,

35:06.700 --> 35:09.140
I don't know why I wouldn't keep using the build

35:09.140 --> 35:13.780
service on SUSE building for these other distros.

35:13.780 --> 35:15.780
And maybe I'm a little backwards on this, but to me,

35:15.780 --> 35:18.460
that is a bit of an indictment of SUSE

35:18.460 --> 35:20.500
and their overall influence, that they have created

35:20.500 --> 35:23.780
something so special that does absolutely have users

35:23.780 --> 35:28.340
and does see growth, but it doesn't have the mindshare

35:28.340 --> 35:31.060
and usage that it really should.

35:31.060 --> 35:35.560
And if this was a Fedora-backed or a Red Hat-backed initiative

35:35.560 --> 35:39.160
or a Linux Foundation initiative, I have a sense

35:39.160 --> 35:41.820
it would have 10 times the recognition.

35:41.820 --> 35:43.940
As a comparison, I bet you people

35:43.940 --> 35:46.340
have heard of the Linux vendor service, the LVFS,

35:46.340 --> 35:49.460
10 times more than they've heard of the open SUSE build service.

35:49.460 --> 35:50.260
But not in Munich.

35:53.580 --> 35:56.180
And now Plant City, Florida, the two strongholds.

35:56.180 --> 35:59.380
You know, we got an email from a guy out of Florida,

35:59.380 --> 36:02.900
and I think he's along your line of thinking here.

36:02.900 --> 36:06.060
He says it's good for business and corporate development.

36:06.060 --> 36:13.100
And honestly, I ran bank core servers on SUSE Enterprise

36:13.100 --> 36:15.460
Server for a long time.

36:15.460 --> 36:18.900
And it was just the eventual, like,

36:18.900 --> 36:22.020
straw that broke the camel's back was it was an issue.

36:22.020 --> 36:25.160
It was just a stupid issue in a DNS resolver library,

36:25.160 --> 36:27.440
actually, that after a ton of time,

36:27.440 --> 36:29.180
we were able to self-patch even.

36:29.180 --> 36:30.620
But it just was the straw.

36:30.620 --> 36:33.100
After we had resolved that particular issue,

36:33.100 --> 36:34.980
I was just done deploying Sless.

36:34.980 --> 36:39.060
But I did run it probably two and a half, three years

36:39.060 --> 36:43.180
on more and more systems, especially for just one tech

36:43.180 --> 36:45.060
managing all of those boxes.

36:45.060 --> 36:47.100
There were some things I really liked about it.

36:47.100 --> 36:49.020
So I don't think you're totally crazy.

36:49.020 --> 36:53.660
But if you had hired me as a consultant

36:53.660 --> 36:56.340
to help you build out a data center infrastructure,

36:56.340 --> 36:58.660
I'd still be trying to advise you not to use SUSE.

36:58.660 --> 36:59.380
It's interesting.

36:59.380 --> 37:01.780
See, I could be wrong, right?

37:01.780 --> 37:03.460
You might be able to convince me, though.

37:03.460 --> 37:06.060
I mean, you're starting to kind of make me see it your way.

37:06.060 --> 37:08.220
I'm starting to kind of see your perspective on it

37:08.220 --> 37:10.900
and think, OK, I can see it working in this use case.

37:10.900 --> 37:12.860
Because I do honestly might think

37:12.860 --> 37:15.220
it does have its legitimate use cases.

37:15.220 --> 37:17.740
I just don't think there's as many as all the other distros.

37:17.740 --> 37:20.260
Well, see, so the failback position for me

37:20.260 --> 37:23.500
is even if the core, like the internal infrastructure,

37:23.500 --> 37:27.620
remains SUSE, I can use OBS to just build packages

37:27.620 --> 37:29.100
for, like, Ubuntu.

37:29.100 --> 37:30.300
And I'm fine.

37:30.300 --> 37:30.900
Yeah.

37:30.900 --> 37:35.020
And the reality is, between virtualization and containers,

37:35.020 --> 37:37.580
it really doesn't matter what your host OS is.

37:37.580 --> 37:38.660
It just doesn't anymore.

37:38.660 --> 37:39.820
I mean, you can make it matter.

37:39.820 --> 37:41.180
Docker all the things, right?

37:41.180 --> 37:42.820
Yeah.

37:42.820 --> 37:43.460
Exactly.

37:43.460 --> 37:44.540
That's just it.

37:44.540 --> 37:47.540
And really, as long as you're happy

37:47.540 --> 37:49.180
and you can manage the base OS, then

37:49.180 --> 37:50.580
it's really about the applications running

37:50.580 --> 37:51.220
on top of that.

37:51.220 --> 37:53.140
And you know how you can orchestrate those containers?

37:53.140 --> 37:53.820
Oh, how's that?

37:53.820 --> 37:55.420
Using Rancher, which is owned by SUSE.

37:55.420 --> 37:57.340
Yes!

37:57.340 --> 37:58.700
There you go.

37:58.700 --> 37:59.260
Very good.

37:59.260 --> 38:00.300
I had to get it in there.

38:00.300 --> 38:03.700
Coder.show slash contact if you have thoughts on this topic.

38:03.700 --> 38:07.100
Get the hell out of here.

38:07.100 --> 38:09.780
Datadog.com slash Coder Radio.

38:09.780 --> 38:12.020
Go there to get a 14-day free trial.

38:12.020 --> 38:14.860
And if you put an agent on a machine, a free t-shirt, too.

38:14.860 --> 38:17.780
Today's episode of Coder Radio is sponsored by Datadog,

38:17.780 --> 38:20.500
the monitoring and analytics platform for cloud scale

38:20.500 --> 38:22.980
infrastructure and applications.

38:22.980 --> 38:27.460
See inside any stack, any app, at any scale, anywhere.

38:27.460 --> 38:29.740
In 2010, Datadog's founder set out

38:29.740 --> 38:31.900
to create a product that would reduce friction between

38:31.900 --> 38:34.980
developers and system administration teams, which

38:34.980 --> 38:37.020
they'd experienced in prior work.

38:37.020 --> 38:39.060
You see Datadog's machine learning-based alerts,

38:39.060 --> 38:41.660
customizable dashboards, and over 400

38:41.660 --> 38:43.660
vendor-backed integrations make it

38:43.660 --> 38:46.300
easy to unify disparate data sources

38:46.300 --> 38:49.300
and pivot between correlated metrics and events

38:49.300 --> 38:51.060
for faster troubleshooting.

38:51.060 --> 38:54.060
By combining metrics, traces, and logs in one place,

38:54.060 --> 38:57.060
in one dashboard, you can easily improve your application's

38:57.060 --> 38:59.740
performance and keep an eye on what's going on.

38:59.740 --> 39:01.620
Datadog also gives you observability

39:01.620 --> 39:05.860
into containers, speaking about containers just a moment ago.

39:05.860 --> 39:08.420
Get detailed insights into Docker performance

39:08.420 --> 39:10.340
about what those containers are doing.

39:10.340 --> 39:13.900
You can try Datadog for free and start a 14-day trial

39:13.900 --> 39:16.620

39:20.260 --> 39:22.620
See how you can unify your monitoring today.

39:22.620 --> 39:25.420
You can see it all in one place with Datadog.

39:25.420 --> 39:29.420
Datadog.com slash Coder Radio.

39:29.420 --> 39:34.660
So Mr. Dominic, you received your iPhone 12.

39:34.660 --> 39:35.820
What do you think?

39:35.820 --> 39:38.100
I think if I don't get a case within the next hour and a half,

39:38.100 --> 39:40.380
I'm going to have a lot of problems.

39:40.380 --> 39:41.660
So you just got this thing.

39:41.660 --> 39:42.380
I just got it.

39:42.380 --> 39:46.180
Yeah, this, I don't know if I should call it matte,

39:46.180 --> 39:49.060
because I.

39:49.060 --> 39:50.260
Come on now, give it your best.

39:50.260 --> 39:51.580
Come on, you can do it.

39:51.580 --> 39:55.820
This back, this back texture, it's

39:55.820 --> 39:57.940
almost like it's designed to get me to spend

39:57.940 --> 40:00.500
more money on Apple products.

40:00.500 --> 40:01.660
There's some more bacon.

40:01.660 --> 40:03.700
I cannot keep a grip on this damn thing.

40:03.700 --> 40:04.780
Which one did you get?

40:04.780 --> 40:06.660
I got the blue 12.

40:06.660 --> 40:07.540
OK.

40:07.540 --> 40:08.460
Oh, OK.

40:08.460 --> 40:10.460
All right, the Pacific blue one, huh?

40:10.460 --> 40:11.780
Pacific.

40:11.780 --> 40:14.420
Is the blue as nice as it looks in the pictures?

40:14.420 --> 40:15.980
I actually like it a lot, yeah.

40:15.980 --> 40:19.500
And any noticeable improvements with the first few minutes

40:19.500 --> 40:20.260
you've had it?

40:20.260 --> 40:22.180
Yeah, I mean, I've had it about a couple hours.

40:22.180 --> 40:23.460
It feels nice holding it.

40:23.460 --> 40:25.380
The pictures are definitely significantly better.

40:25.380 --> 40:25.900
Oh, really?

40:25.900 --> 40:28.500
But my phone is the two models back.

40:28.500 --> 40:29.660
So this is a nice upgrade.

40:29.660 --> 40:31.180
So this is a nice upgrade for me.

40:31.180 --> 40:33.460
It feels bigger, but I held them side by side.

40:33.460 --> 40:35.740
I think it's because there's less bezel.

40:35.740 --> 40:37.140
This is actually the first time I

40:37.140 --> 40:39.740
did the transfer from one iPhone to another thing.

40:39.740 --> 40:41.820
Usually I set it up manually.

40:41.820 --> 40:43.260
And that has worked surprisingly well,

40:43.260 --> 40:45.660
except I can't figure out how to get Authenticator

40:45.660 --> 40:47.900
to transfer my stuff over.

40:47.900 --> 40:50.380
The logging in the two factor takes forever now.

40:50.380 --> 40:54.140
Yeah, I can't seem to get that working.

40:54.140 --> 40:56.260
But that's probably because I'm dumb.

40:56.260 --> 40:58.060
You're going to have to probably go rescan

40:58.060 --> 41:00.100
QR codes and whatnot and just set them back up again.

41:00.100 --> 41:01.860
Yeah, I found a thing on, like, because I

41:01.860 --> 41:02.820
use Google Authenticator.

41:02.820 --> 41:05.380
Oh, spoilers.

41:05.380 --> 41:09.860
It seems to want me to scan multiple, like, every barcode.

41:09.860 --> 41:10.820
Yeah.

41:10.820 --> 41:12.900
That's going to be a process.

41:12.900 --> 41:13.580
It's a good time.

41:13.580 --> 41:14.860
Yeah, it's a lot of fun.

41:14.860 --> 41:15.900
Yeah, and don't mess it up.

41:15.900 --> 41:17.180
And don't forget.

41:17.180 --> 41:19.980
I have decided to hold off.

41:19.980 --> 41:21.460
I think I'm going to get the mini.

41:21.460 --> 41:22.140
Interesting.

41:22.140 --> 41:23.300
When I do get it.

41:23.300 --> 41:24.660
I am on the upgrade program.

41:24.660 --> 41:28.500
And technically, switching to the mini makes it cheaper.

41:28.500 --> 41:29.940
So I think I'm going to go that route.

41:29.940 --> 41:32.100
I'm a little worried about a downgrading camera.

41:32.100 --> 41:34.340
Well, I can tell you with the Pro, I'm a little worried.

41:34.340 --> 41:37.620
Like, I carry my iPhone in my pocket,

41:37.620 --> 41:39.220
like my front pant pocket.

41:39.220 --> 41:39.780
Yeah.

41:39.780 --> 41:42.060
And I'm not sure that I would want to do that anymore.

41:42.060 --> 41:44.940
Do you do screen in or screen out?

41:44.940 --> 41:46.380
So it's in your pocket.

41:46.380 --> 41:47.980
Which way is the screen facing?

41:47.980 --> 41:50.220
Usually against my leg, if I remember.

41:50.220 --> 41:51.060
Yeah.

41:51.060 --> 41:52.580
So that way, if you bump into something,

41:52.580 --> 41:53.700
you hit the back of the phone.

41:53.700 --> 41:54.660
You hit the back of it.

41:54.660 --> 41:57.100
But I'm thinking I'm going to have to do something.

41:57.100 --> 41:58.760
So I'm just holding them side by side.

41:58.760 --> 41:59.900
It's definitely taller.

41:59.900 --> 42:01.500
I'm looking forward to a smaller phone,

42:01.500 --> 42:04.540
because I know it's just going to fit anywhere

42:04.540 --> 42:05.620
my current phone fits.

42:05.620 --> 42:07.980
That phone's going to fit just even better.

42:07.980 --> 42:11.500
And I have been waiting for a small, fast phone.

42:11.500 --> 42:13.080
I don't want a compromised phone.

42:13.080 --> 42:15.120
And there is a bit of a compromise with the cameras.

42:15.120 --> 42:17.820
But other than that, this seems like a pretty solid little

42:17.820 --> 42:18.940
phone.

42:18.940 --> 42:22.100
And more than anything, that's what I'm excited about.

42:22.100 --> 42:24.220
I also wonder if this might be the last iPhone

42:24.220 --> 42:25.060
I get for a while.

42:25.060 --> 42:25.560
Oh, jeez.

42:25.560 --> 42:27.820
Because I could definitely see the ports going away

42:27.820 --> 42:28.860
after this one.

42:28.860 --> 42:29.540
Really?

42:29.540 --> 42:30.100
Yeah.

42:30.100 --> 42:32.140
I mean, if they're going to do it, right?

42:32.140 --> 42:34.380
They introduced the MagSafe charger,

42:34.380 --> 42:37.020
the wireless charging at a faster rate, 15 watts,

42:37.020 --> 42:37.940
whoopty whoop.

42:37.940 --> 42:39.180
Yeah, that's not that fast.

42:39.180 --> 42:41.460
They've had wireless carplay for a while,

42:41.460 --> 42:44.180
although I don't really know how much adoption it's gotten.

42:44.180 --> 42:47.900
The AirPods, the HomePods, they're all wireless.

42:47.900 --> 42:49.780
And they've switched the lightning cable

42:49.780 --> 42:51.380
to USB-C on the other end.

42:51.380 --> 42:53.740
So I think it's way more likely they just

42:53.740 --> 42:56.100
go portless than it is they ever go to USB-C.

42:56.100 --> 42:58.260
I freaking hope I'm wrong.

42:58.260 --> 43:00.260
But we'll see.

43:00.260 --> 43:01.020
We'll see.

43:01.020 --> 43:02.220
I don't think we'll find out for a little bit.

43:02.220 --> 43:04.300
So maybe I'll just hang out with a tiny little phone

43:04.300 --> 43:07.060
for as long as it lasts, and then I'd be fine with that.

43:07.060 --> 43:11.940
As we record, Apple has announced their ARM Mac event

43:11.940 --> 43:15.660
takes place next week, the day after we record.

43:15.660 --> 43:21.220
It's the second time they've done that to us.

43:21.220 --> 43:23.300
You really pissed them off years ago, you know?

43:23.300 --> 43:24.020
Oh, yeah.

43:24.020 --> 43:26.460
Yeah, they're just sitting there in a rage, right?

43:26.460 --> 43:27.340
Yeah.

43:27.340 --> 43:28.260
Tim Cook.

43:28.260 --> 43:29.020
Yeah.

43:29.020 --> 43:31.060
Obviously, it's Tim Cook.

43:31.060 --> 43:34.540
Yeah, so you're going to get your Silicon Macs?

43:34.540 --> 43:35.800
Are you excited?

43:35.800 --> 43:37.180
I might be too excited.

43:37.180 --> 43:37.660
Really?

43:37.660 --> 43:38.380
Really?

43:38.380 --> 43:41.980
I'm really expecting this to be kind of a devastating blow

43:41.980 --> 43:43.380
to the industry.

43:43.380 --> 43:45.060
Ooh, you think the performance is going

43:45.060 --> 43:47.260
to be that off the charts?

43:47.260 --> 43:49.660
I think the battery life is going to be that off the charts.

43:49.660 --> 43:53.820
Oh, you think they're going to be anything that's like, what,

43:53.820 --> 43:54.420
18 hours?

43:54.420 --> 43:55.860
I mean, what's off the charts?

43:55.860 --> 43:58.140
I'm thinking we could hit the big 2.0.

43:58.140 --> 43:59.220
20 hours?

43:59.220 --> 44:01.900
I know it's crazy, but why go through all this hassle?

44:01.900 --> 44:05.660
Yeah, I mean, I keep thinking back to the iPad

44:05.660 --> 44:09.220
and how freaking fast the iPad Pro is.

44:09.220 --> 44:10.860
And it's got no fan.

44:10.860 --> 44:14.340
It's impossibly thin.

44:14.340 --> 44:17.780
If you just gave that thing more cooling and more cores

44:17.780 --> 44:20.000
and more battery, you could probably

44:20.000 --> 44:22.520
get an iPad Pro to 24 hours of battery life

44:22.520 --> 44:25.380
if you could just make it thick enough, like a laptop.

44:25.380 --> 44:27.580
Right, see, my question is, are we going down

44:27.580 --> 44:30.740
from a MacBook Air?

44:30.740 --> 44:33.260
I think it's really coming down from a 13-inch MacBook Pro.

44:33.260 --> 44:35.300
Or are we coming up from an iPad Pro?

44:35.300 --> 44:37.460
That's where I'm getting a little confused.

44:37.460 --> 44:40.180
I think also you're kind of counting on Apple

44:40.180 --> 44:44.860
to do something that has not been in their, well,

44:44.860 --> 44:46.580
hasn't always been in their nature.

44:46.580 --> 44:49.580
And that is they've always gone thinner and lighter

44:49.580 --> 44:51.420
when they can, with some recent exceptions,

44:51.420 --> 44:54.100
like the MacBook Pro 16 and the new iPads.

44:54.100 --> 44:57.020
But they've generally always got those suckers

44:57.020 --> 44:59.340
as thin and light as possible.

44:59.340 --> 45:02.740
So I feel like if it's possible, although I

45:02.740 --> 45:05.240
could see them wanting to blow the doors off battery life,

45:05.240 --> 45:07.700
I could also see them saying all-day battery

45:07.700 --> 45:09.060
life is good enough.

45:09.060 --> 45:11.340
We're just going to say it has all-day battery life.

45:11.340 --> 45:14.660
And what that really will translate to is 8 to 12 hours.

45:14.660 --> 45:19.220
And they'll just reduce space and weight instead

45:19.220 --> 45:21.500
of going any further than that.

45:21.500 --> 45:23.900
Again, it's GNOME, man.

45:23.900 --> 45:24.420
It's GNOME.

45:24.420 --> 45:27.340
I think they're going to want to have a developer story here

45:27.340 --> 45:30.900
that this blows the pants off of their previous generation

45:30.900 --> 45:31.580
products.

45:31.580 --> 45:33.940
Yeah, the speculation is two laptops, a MacBook Air

45:33.940 --> 45:36.100
and the MacBook 13.

45:36.100 --> 45:38.260
I could see that the 13 one could be targeted right

45:38.260 --> 45:40.180
at developers.

45:40.180 --> 45:41.220
Or they could wait.

45:41.220 --> 45:43.180
They could wait till they get to the bigger laptops.

45:43.180 --> 45:46.660
And that's where they really put in the 20-hour battery life.

45:46.660 --> 45:48.000
I don't know.

45:48.000 --> 45:49.660
I guess we don't really need to speculate.

45:49.660 --> 45:51.180
We'll find out soon enough.

45:51.180 --> 45:53.700
What would it take for you to drop money on a new laptop,

45:53.700 --> 45:54.180
though?

45:54.180 --> 45:54.980
What would it take?

45:54.980 --> 45:57.580
Truly nothing.

45:57.580 --> 45:59.300
Just do a good job?

45:59.300 --> 46:02.340
I mean, come on.

46:02.340 --> 46:04.100
What, you're going to just do it?

46:04.100 --> 46:06.380
I mean, I would be tempted if I were you, too.

46:06.380 --> 46:07.660
I absolutely would.

46:07.660 --> 46:09.140
I got to admit, I would be tempted.

46:09.140 --> 46:12.740
I have no business need for it, so I can't justify it.

46:12.740 --> 46:16.780
I mean, I guess there's some, what I would consider,

46:16.780 --> 46:19.780
minuscule chance that they could really mess this up.

46:19.780 --> 46:22.260
But that just doesn't seem likely, does it?

46:22.260 --> 46:25.420
What if the Intel performance, like the x86 emulation,

46:25.420 --> 46:27.860
is just dog crap slow?

46:27.860 --> 46:30.420
And you've got to figure, like, 70% of the stuff you're using

46:30.420 --> 46:32.220
at first is x86 emulated.

46:32.220 --> 46:34.380
But that is the area where they know they have

46:34.380 --> 46:36.100
to protect themselves, right?

46:36.100 --> 46:37.100
Yeah.

46:37.100 --> 46:39.380
Doesn't mean they can change the laws of physics.

46:39.380 --> 46:41.540
Yeah, I mean, we'll see.

46:41.540 --> 46:42.500
We'll see, right?

46:42.500 --> 46:45.660
They could have, I mean, since they're building the silicon,

46:45.660 --> 46:48.020
they can have cores dedicated to virtualization.

46:48.020 --> 46:51.060
I mean, they could really go crazy with it if they wanted to.

46:51.060 --> 46:53.580
That is, sorry.

46:53.580 --> 46:54.260
Fine.

46:54.260 --> 46:56.260
We'll have another helping of Applewood bacon.

46:56.260 --> 46:58.340
I really didn't want to do this because I can feel.

46:58.340 --> 46:59.660
Wow, you're lucky, man.

46:59.660 --> 47:01.620
I don't always bring two helpings of bacon with me.

47:01.620 --> 47:02.140
Oh, please.

47:02.140 --> 47:04.700
I know LadyJuice has just like an entire smoker.

47:04.700 --> 47:05.820
Got a whole fridge full.

47:05.820 --> 47:08.060
I think that they wouldn't be doing this

47:08.060 --> 47:13.020
without this being kind of an iMac circa 1990, whatever, move.

47:13.020 --> 47:14.140
Whoa.

47:14.140 --> 47:14.660
Whoa.

47:14.660 --> 47:15.220
Really do.

47:15.220 --> 47:17.260
I think Dell's going to be crapping their pants.

47:17.260 --> 47:19.580
I think it's going to make all the Surface devices look

47:19.580 --> 47:20.260
like jokes.

47:20.260 --> 47:24.500
I just, it's going to make my iMac Pro feel really sad.

47:24.500 --> 47:25.140
Yeah.

47:25.140 --> 47:25.460
I don't know.

47:25.460 --> 47:27.380
It feels like, remember in World of Warcraft,

47:27.380 --> 47:29.100
if you ever played that for listeners,

47:29.100 --> 47:30.300
you have your Purples, right?

47:30.300 --> 47:33.100
Your epic gear from like Burning Legion.

47:33.100 --> 47:35.100
Then you get a blue or a green and Lich King.

47:35.100 --> 47:38.660
And it's like, oh, that's all garbage now.

47:38.660 --> 47:41.620
So what would stop me from buying it?

47:41.620 --> 47:43.540
There is actually one thing.

47:43.540 --> 47:45.500
Son of a bitch of a butterfly keyboard.

47:45.500 --> 47:46.540
Oh, well, there's no way.

47:46.540 --> 47:48.260
There's no way.

47:48.260 --> 47:50.100
That would be like suicide, right?

47:50.100 --> 47:50.580
Yeah.

47:50.580 --> 47:51.180
I don't know.

47:51.180 --> 47:52.420
I think it's a lock.

47:52.420 --> 47:53.900
You're going to have to use Big Sur.

47:53.900 --> 47:56.180
You'll have no option but use Big Sur on those things.

47:56.180 --> 47:56.860
Oh.

47:56.860 --> 47:57.860
You know what though?

47:57.860 --> 47:59.980
It's going to be like when they did all the candy cane crap.

47:59.980 --> 48:04.900
They're just going to go back, right?

48:04.900 --> 48:06.340
And they're going to undo it.

48:06.340 --> 48:07.900
Have you moved to Catalina?

48:07.900 --> 48:08.500
Oh, god.

48:08.500 --> 48:10.460
Catalina is just lousy.

48:10.460 --> 48:12.660
Well, everything in Catalina is in Big Sur.

48:12.660 --> 48:13.860
No, I'm on Catalina.

48:13.860 --> 48:14.380
OK.

48:14.380 --> 48:16.620
Well, if you can survive it there, you'll be all right.

48:16.620 --> 48:19.060
So Adium doesn't work in Catalina.

48:19.060 --> 48:19.660
No.

48:19.660 --> 48:22.940
No, because the 90s called, and they want their messenger back.

48:22.940 --> 48:24.100
Adium.

48:24.100 --> 48:25.620
What's wrong with Adium?

48:25.620 --> 48:26.180
Nothing.

48:26.180 --> 48:29.540
It's just like seriously old.

48:29.540 --> 48:30.940
It's really old.

48:30.940 --> 48:31.460
Oh, my god.

48:31.460 --> 48:33.460
It's an IRC messenger.

48:33.460 --> 48:34.860
What does it do?

48:34.860 --> 48:37.260
Listen, I have a custom Adium theme

48:37.260 --> 48:39.220
that I've been using for like 12 years.

48:39.220 --> 48:39.860
Oh, I get it.

48:39.860 --> 48:40.660
I get it.

48:40.660 --> 48:45.980
It's just, do you remember when people were on AIM and ICQ?

48:45.980 --> 48:46.900
You know I do.

48:46.900 --> 48:48.860
That's how old Adium is.

48:48.860 --> 48:49.860
Do you remember TextMate?

48:49.860 --> 48:51.340
Because that's what I was.

48:51.340 --> 48:52.820
Yeah, hell yeah.

48:52.820 --> 48:53.500
OK.

48:53.500 --> 48:54.940
So you know what the problem is?

48:54.940 --> 48:57.980
When I'm on Mac, I want to go back in time, right?

48:57.980 --> 48:58.780
Right, right.

48:58.780 --> 48:59.380
Yeah.

48:59.380 --> 49:00.620
And that's not very easy.

49:00.620 --> 49:02.820
Not very easy.

49:02.820 --> 49:05.460
And this is a whole other break with that compatibility

49:05.460 --> 49:05.940
right there.

49:05.940 --> 49:11.100
And part of what gives me the biggest pause is as a developer,

49:11.100 --> 49:14.340
you could make the case that a great MacBook Pro could

49:14.340 --> 49:15.660
be the perfect trifecta.

49:15.660 --> 49:19.340
In an ideal situation, you could run Mac OS, Linux,

49:19.340 --> 49:21.500
and Windows on one machine.

49:21.500 --> 49:23.740
Talk about changing your game and getting

49:23.740 --> 49:26.100
a lot of efficiency out of one piece of hardware.

49:26.100 --> 49:28.700
And then the T1 and T2 chips came along,

49:28.700 --> 49:31.260
and that dream sort of faded, and it became a dual OS.

49:31.260 --> 49:33.580
Possible machine, still very valuable.

49:33.580 --> 49:36.780
And now it's a single OS with virtualization,

49:36.780 --> 49:39.660
and it'll never, ever be anything else.

49:39.660 --> 49:41.860
And I mean, it's not that that's a big problem,

49:41.860 --> 49:43.300
because if you're buying a Mac, you're not buying it

49:43.300 --> 49:44.620
for anything else, really.

49:44.620 --> 49:47.340
But for me, when I'm looking at my tools,

49:47.340 --> 49:50.260
I like my laptop to be able to do multiple things.

49:50.260 --> 49:51.780
And that's just a consideration now.

49:51.780 --> 49:54.260
No boot camp's going to really be a drag.

49:54.260 --> 49:57.980
It's fine, but I think it will be a factor for something.

49:57.980 --> 50:00.340
This is the question, right?

50:00.340 --> 50:05.260
Apple has, I'm trying to put this in a non-flamey way.

50:05.260 --> 50:07.500
There's no non-flamey way, I'm just going to go for it.

50:07.500 --> 50:10.980
Apple has effectively helped create the surge in Linux

50:10.980 --> 50:13.020
desktop use among developers, right?

50:13.020 --> 50:14.500
Oh!

50:14.500 --> 50:17.580
So, I never would have considered it

50:17.580 --> 50:19.380
if they didn't just decide to screw up

50:19.380 --> 50:21.860
for several years, right?

50:21.860 --> 50:23.940
So for them not to just come, and again,

50:23.940 --> 50:26.580
by their own admission, over and over again,

50:26.580 --> 50:28.580
their biggest pro market, one of their most important

50:28.580 --> 50:32.380
market for the Mac, we're talking about our developers.

50:32.380 --> 50:35.020
Yeah, although I think the developers they're talking about

50:35.020 --> 50:37.420
are the developers that write for their ecosystem.

50:37.420 --> 50:38.740
No, they talk about, they were talking about

50:38.740 --> 50:40.980
web developers too, they had a whole thing.

50:40.980 --> 50:41.820
Okay, all right.

50:41.820 --> 50:44.700
Right, ATP was triumphal on it, right?

50:44.700 --> 50:45.540
Okay.

50:45.540 --> 50:48.780
I can't see a world where you get this laptop,

50:48.780 --> 50:50.960
and then you like install Python,

50:50.960 --> 50:52.580
and it's not like amazing, right?

50:52.580 --> 50:54.300
No, I can see a world where Homebrew

50:54.300 --> 50:56.020
doesn't work for a month.

50:56.020 --> 50:57.100
Yes.

50:57.100 --> 50:58.180
Although, they're probably not, right?

50:58.180 --> 51:00.420
They're probably helping the Homebrew team out.

51:00.420 --> 51:02.180
They may already have those Mac Minis.

51:02.180 --> 51:04.300
I'm sure they do, right?

51:04.300 --> 51:05.980
You know, it wasn't that hard to get those

51:05.980 --> 51:06.820
if you wanted one.

51:06.820 --> 51:07.660
Right.

51:07.660 --> 51:09.820
I don't, I guess I'm trying, like,

51:09.820 --> 51:11.420
unless they think this is gonna be like

51:11.420 --> 51:13.660
the college kid dorm laptop,

51:13.660 --> 51:16.060
but it's almost certainly gonna be way too expensive.

51:16.060 --> 51:17.100
Yeah, that'll be something.

51:17.100 --> 51:19.140
With no Intel tax, I wonder what their reason

51:19.140 --> 51:21.260
for keeping the price high will be.

51:21.260 --> 51:23.220
Juicy, thick margins.

51:23.220 --> 51:24.860
What other reason could there be?

51:24.860 --> 51:27.460
Our R&Ds, all the R&Ds they put into it.

51:27.460 --> 51:28.980
That damn license we're gonna have to pay

51:28.980 --> 51:30.420
Nvidia now for R&D.

51:30.420 --> 51:31.660
Ah, I wonder, yeah.

51:31.660 --> 51:33.180
No, I think Apple owns it perpetually.

51:33.180 --> 51:34.020
They got a perpetual license.

51:34.020 --> 51:34.860
Oh.

51:34.860 --> 51:35.880
I'm like, huh.

51:35.880 --> 51:37.840
Okay, Mr. Dominic.

51:37.840 --> 51:39.660
I think we have to try to squeeze in

51:39.660 --> 51:42.540
just a quick chat about the Raspberry Pi 400.

51:42.540 --> 51:43.540
Before we do that, though,

51:43.540 --> 51:44.700
because that's just news that broke today

51:44.700 --> 51:45.660
as we're recording,

51:45.660 --> 51:47.540
I also wanna get a mention in

51:47.540 --> 51:49.740
that you are hiring at the Mad Botter.

51:49.740 --> 51:51.220
Do you wanna give people deets on that?

51:51.220 --> 51:54.580
Yeah, so we're hiring for a Python developer

51:54.580 --> 51:56.780
experience in Flask preferred.

51:56.780 --> 51:58.620
When we say Python, we always mean Python 3

51:58.620 --> 52:02.060
because we are not, in fact, old ones from Lovecraft.

52:02.060 --> 52:04.420
And bonus points if you like SUSE.

52:04.420 --> 52:05.980
Wow, I can't believe that's in there now.

52:05.980 --> 52:08.380
What has happened?

52:08.380 --> 52:11.100
Oh, and you get a System76 workstation or a MacBook,

52:11.100 --> 52:13.500
but almost always a System76.

52:13.500 --> 52:14.340
It's your choice.

52:14.340 --> 52:15.160
How about that?

52:15.160 --> 52:16.000
He lets you choose.

52:16.000 --> 52:17.000
You pick the tool.

52:17.000 --> 52:19.940
So we'll have links and details in the show notes

52:19.940 --> 52:23.220
at coder.show slash 386.

52:23.220 --> 52:24.380
Well, we do have a lot more to get to,

52:24.380 --> 52:25.940
but we're running a little long,

52:25.940 --> 52:27.600
but I kinda wanted to capture your thoughts.

52:27.600 --> 52:30.580
So I'm gonna talk about it tomorrow in Linux Unplugged.

52:30.580 --> 52:31.760
But as the timing comes out,

52:31.760 --> 52:34.120
this morning we woke up to the news

52:34.120 --> 52:37.780
that there is now a Raspberry Pi desktop PC,

52:37.780 --> 52:42.460
and it is a full Raspberry Pi built into,

52:42.460 --> 52:46.260
a Raspberry Pi 4 that's actually 800 megahertz faster,

52:46.260 --> 52:49.140
built into a keyboard with like the USB ports

52:49.140 --> 52:50.920
and HDMI in the back of the keyboard.

52:50.920 --> 52:51.760
It's amazing.

52:51.760 --> 52:55.020
And it's $70, 70 bucks.

52:55.020 --> 52:55.860
Yeah.

52:55.860 --> 52:58.580
Four gigs of RAM, 1.8 gigahertz quad core CPU.

52:58.580 --> 53:00.540
And you get the whole ecosystem of the Raspberry Pi,

53:00.540 --> 53:02.180
all the images, the community.

53:02.180 --> 53:03.020
It's huge.

53:03.020 --> 53:03.840
I think it's great.

53:03.840 --> 53:05.020
It reminds me of the Commodore 64.

53:05.020 --> 53:06.940
Yes, you know, cause you could,

53:06.940 --> 53:09.860
with this HDMI port, you could hook it up to your TV

53:09.860 --> 53:11.140
and you could, you know,

53:11.140 --> 53:14.060
I mean, that was my first computer in my room.

53:14.060 --> 53:16.840
And I had it hooked up to a television,

53:16.840 --> 53:20.780
like through the antenna connector on the back of the TV.

53:20.780 --> 53:22.460
And I just put cartridges in that.

53:22.460 --> 53:25.100
That was my experience with a computer at first.

53:25.100 --> 53:26.060
And that could be all over again.

53:26.060 --> 53:29.440
I mean, I also could see this as a cheap way

53:29.440 --> 53:31.140
for people to learn Linux.

53:31.140 --> 53:33.420
I could see that too, you know, cause 70 bucks.

53:33.420 --> 53:34.660
And then you put Ubuntu on here

53:34.660 --> 53:37.100
and you're playing with Linux now,

53:37.100 --> 53:38.860
or, you know, come with Raspberry OS.

53:38.860 --> 53:40.940
A good computer for a kid that you're trying to teach,

53:40.940 --> 53:43.300
right, young kid, $70, yeah.

53:43.300 --> 53:45.540
I'm just saying, I think this is pretty great.

53:45.540 --> 53:49.060
So I don't know, I guess that's really all I had to say.

53:49.060 --> 53:49.980
I'm very impressed.

53:49.980 --> 53:51.420
I'm still kind of digesting the news

53:51.420 --> 53:53.900
cause we record this kind of in the morning here

53:53.900 --> 53:56.540
in the Pacific Northwest and this just came out.

53:56.540 --> 53:57.860
But I also had that same,

53:57.860 --> 54:00.540
that thought that reminded me of the 80 micro computers

54:00.540 --> 54:01.980
that were plugged into TVs.

54:01.980 --> 54:02.820
Yeah, I think this is great.

54:02.820 --> 54:04.380
I mean, I'm always impressed every release

54:04.380 --> 54:05.520
with the Raspberry Pi folks.

54:05.520 --> 54:07.940
I actually, my four year old has a Raspberry Pi.

54:07.940 --> 54:10.260
Now he's lobbying for the iMac Pro

54:10.260 --> 54:14.460
because he overheard too many episodes of a certain podcast.

54:15.460 --> 54:17.620
And yeah, but this is like the kind of,

54:17.620 --> 54:18.660
when he's a little older,

54:18.660 --> 54:20.500
whatever the successor to this model is,

54:20.500 --> 54:22.020
is exactly perfect, right?

54:22.020 --> 54:23.660
Cause right now I have the Raspberry Pi

54:23.660 --> 54:25.380
in like a 3D printed case and.

54:25.380 --> 54:26.220
Yeah, nice.

54:26.220 --> 54:27.940
It's fastened to the wall.

54:27.940 --> 54:30.180
Right, and they called it the Pi 400 desktop.

54:30.180 --> 54:32.460
So I guess when the Pi 5 is out,

54:32.460 --> 54:36.180
we could probably expect a Pi 500 desktop too.

54:36.180 --> 54:37.980
So they'll probably keep iterating on this.

54:37.980 --> 54:39.380
They now have this,

54:39.380 --> 54:41.260
they have the Raspberry compute module,

54:41.260 --> 54:42.520
which looks really cool,

54:42.520 --> 54:44.940
which has just been updated for the Raspberry Pi 4.

54:44.940 --> 54:48.260
And then they have the Raspberry Pi 4 eight gigabyte,

54:48.260 --> 54:51.020
which I have one of those and that's pretty great.

54:51.020 --> 54:53.300
Nice, now that's a lot of power for a Pi.

54:53.300 --> 54:55.100
I really, I feel like it is.

54:55.100 --> 54:57.740
I run it as a Plex server.

54:57.740 --> 55:00.420
I have my markdown notes on there.

55:00.420 --> 55:03.500
I have a home assistant running on that same instance

55:03.500 --> 55:08.180
that it has hundreds of entries and entities in it,

55:08.180 --> 55:09.740
doing lots of automations.

55:09.740 --> 55:13.220
I mean, I run all of that right now off of a single Pi

55:13.220 --> 55:15.900
and really have no complaints.

55:15.900 --> 55:16.940
They're getting really impressive.

55:16.940 --> 55:19.020
It just sort of blows my mind where we're at.

55:19.020 --> 55:20.180
And it, I don't know,

55:20.180 --> 55:22.280
something special about seeing it in a computer

55:22.280 --> 55:23.420
that for a hundred dollars,

55:23.420 --> 55:24.980
you can get the kit for a hundred dollars

55:24.980 --> 55:26.780
and it includes just everything you need.

55:26.780 --> 55:28.260
And then you just hook it right up to a TV

55:28.260 --> 55:30.740
or a monitor that you have in the house already.

55:30.740 --> 55:32.500
And you're off to the races.

55:32.500 --> 55:34.020
You never know what you could see next from them.

55:34.020 --> 55:35.380
I think they're working on these kinds of things.

55:35.380 --> 55:36.600
I think it's pretty exciting.

55:36.600 --> 55:37.900
Yeah, I think you're gonna see these in schools.

55:37.900 --> 55:39.400
I'm pretty excited.

55:39.400 --> 55:40.620
Oh, wouldn't that be interesting?

55:40.620 --> 55:42.380
Wouldn't that be interesting?

55:42.380 --> 55:45.100
Coder.show slash contact if you have thoughts on that.

55:45.100 --> 55:47.940
Also a big thank you to our Coder QA team.

55:47.940 --> 55:49.600
Go get the Coderly report.

55:49.600 --> 55:50.720
You support the show.

55:50.720 --> 55:52.940
And when you become a Coder QA member,

55:52.940 --> 55:54.800
you get the limited ad feed,

55:54.800 --> 55:56.820
which is available for you once you sign up.

55:56.820 --> 55:58.620
That's at coderqa.co.

55:58.620 --> 56:01.300
That's coderqa.co to support the show

56:01.300 --> 56:05.180
and get that limited ad feed and the Coderly report.

56:05.180 --> 56:09.020
Also, I wanna mention you can find a cloud guru on social.

56:09.020 --> 56:10.660
YouTube, Facebook, Twitter,

56:10.660 --> 56:13.060
it's all just slash a cloud guru.

56:13.060 --> 56:14.580
They've managed to really nab that everywhere.

56:14.580 --> 56:17.540
So it's really simple to find a cloud guru on social

56:17.540 --> 56:19.540
if you wanna pick them up and follow them

56:19.540 --> 56:21.900
because there's often good content on there as well.

56:21.900 --> 56:23.020
You can find Mike on Twitter.

56:23.020 --> 56:23.840
We'll have links to that.

56:23.840 --> 56:24.820
The show's on Twitter as well.

56:24.820 --> 56:28.460
And of course, so is the network at Jupiter Signal.

56:28.460 --> 56:30.100
We do this show live on Mondays,

56:30.100 --> 56:32.380
noon Pacific, 3 p.m. Eastern.

56:32.380 --> 56:34.020
A lot of times there's stuff breaking.

56:34.020 --> 56:34.860
There's news breaking.

56:34.860 --> 56:36.060
I'm chatting with the chat room

56:36.060 --> 56:38.260
before the show starts, about a half hour.

56:38.260 --> 56:39.860
So usually about 11, 30 Pacific.

56:39.860 --> 56:40.940
I'm getting on there and chatting with them

56:40.940 --> 56:42.980
