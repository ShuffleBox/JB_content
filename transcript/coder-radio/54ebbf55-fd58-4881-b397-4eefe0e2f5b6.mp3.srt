00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
This is KOTORadio, episode 490, Prokober 31st!

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Hey good buddy, welcome back to Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show,

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
taking a pragmatic look at the art and the business of software development

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
and the spooky world of technology.

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
My name is Chris, obviously, it's Halloween, and joining us like the soldier is,

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
even though I'm late, it's our host, Mr. Dominic.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Hello, mate.

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
KOTORba mitzvah, spooky, scary, noobs becoming...

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Oh, it's a...

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I had a whole thing.

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Oh, good, that was... yeah, that's good.

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Now you don't get it, see?

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
This is...

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
No!

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
You know what, you Lenart Potter-ing me, you jumped on the stage, you get nothing.

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I did.

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Yeah, you get nothing.

18
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
You're saying that Kanye did?

19
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Is that what you're saying?

20
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
No, actually, wasn't Lenart Potter-ing before Kanye?

21
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
That might have been.

22
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Yo, Lenart, go get some money out of Kanye, everybody else is suing him,

23
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
what the hell, jump in line.

24
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Fired up now, he's at Microsoft, he's telling people like it is out there, I guess.

25
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Got a whole new way of doing boot.

26
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
The most gangster Linux community thing to do is to be like,

27
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
yeah, bitches, you know where I'm going?

28
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Microsoft.

29
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
What?

30
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
It is.

31
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
It's also very common.

32
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Yeah, well, Microsoft's got a bigger and bigger Linux department now.

33
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Are you saying they're measuring their Linux?

34
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
They're also in that late-biocracy-stage company where they've gone through being

35
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
like the craziest, most complex bureaucracy possible,

36
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
and they've kind of leveled off a little bit where some companies like I think

37
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Google and Apple are still getting worse and worse and worse in that regard.

38
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I'm sure Microsoft has a slow decline as well.

39
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I mean, it's a cycle, right?

40
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
None of it's as bad as Adobe, which is apparently going to make,

41
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
and everybody was freaking out,

42
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
apparently Adobe's going to make certain colors only available as an in-app,

43
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
well, no, actually just not available, like they can't license them or something.

44
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I don't know.

45
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I'm not an Adobe guy.

46
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
But it really fit in with our trend today of looking at some scary trends

47
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
coming down the pipe for tech because, yes, it's spooky Halloween,

48
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
and you and I are both dads of young kids, so, you know,

49
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Halloween's a big deal in our neck of the woods.

50
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
So I did ask some design folks what the deal is with this color stuff.

51
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Oh, yeah? Okay.

52
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Yeah.

53
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
All right, so there's a company in, guess what state?

54
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
There's only one state that would pull a move like this.

55
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I mean, I always default to Florida, but...

56
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
No, no, Florida wouldn't even know.

57
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Florida would be too drunk or like riding an alligator down the highway.

58
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Yeah, you're right.

59
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
You're more like chaotic.

60
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Yeah, New Jersey.

61
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Only New Jersey could think of this.

62
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
That's legal.

63
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Yep.

64
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Yeah, it's a gangster move a little bit, too.

65
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
It is.

66
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
There's a little bit of it.

67
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Is it technically legal?

68
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
It sure is.

69
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
So basically, some company used to sell print colors,

70
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
and they are somehow proprietary colors.

71
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
This reminds me of a meeting I had with a large printer company

72
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
who was very upset about the shade of blue that I couldn't get.

73
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Oh, yeah, they hate that.

74
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Well, because I'm a spiteful little bastard,

75
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I went back and looked.

76
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Sure enough, that shade of blue...

77
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Now, granted, the reason I couldn't get it was just me being a jackass,

78
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
but it is one of these colors.

79
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
So apparently, these are all like off colors.

80
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
You know what I mean?

81
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:08,000
They're like in between, you know, hard to get the hex code for.

82
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Yeah.

83
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Basically, Photoshop magic.

84
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
When the designer...

85
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Got to have your monitor dialed in.

86
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Right.

87
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Like on my ViewSonic monitor, I basically can't see them, right?

88
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
It's why the Apple monitor is $5,000.

89
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
It's pretty insane.

90
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
So what they did is...

91
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
This is actually not Adobe being evil.

92
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Well, well, okay.

93
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
So this company who owns the colors,

94
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
whose name eludes me right now,

95
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
but they're in New Jersey,

96
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
and that's pretty much all you need to know

97
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
because I'm sure I'm related to some of them.

98
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Hey, cuz, told Adobe,

99
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I see you have that monthly subscription thing going there.

100
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
It's an awfully sweet Creative Cloud you've got.

101
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
It'd be a shame if you didn't pay us some more royalties

102
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
and something happened to those colors.

103
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
And Adobe was like, no, we're Adobe.

104
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
They're like, cool, you don't get the colors.

105
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
But because of the darkness,

106
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
and I will stand by this till the...

107
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I've held this position since we started in 2012.

108
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Creative Cloud is in fact a downgrade.

109
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:14,000
As someone who has acquired Illustrator and Dreamweaver

110
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
when that was a thing, many times in his youth,

111
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
if you know what I mean.

112
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
What a nice cat with headphones on that is, wow.

113
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
You know, my software fell off the back of a truck

114
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
when I was a kid, my Adobe software.

115
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Well, in New Jersey, you literally just go see your uncle Vito

116
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
and they hand you like the four CDs it used to be.

117
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
You know, that is legit how it used to go down.

118
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
And you could use the CD key as many times as you wanted

119
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
because there wasn't checking with any server.

120
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
You had the disk, you had the thing.

121
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
It was like you had the machine, you have the system.

122
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Well, Creative Cloud pretty aggressively forces upgrades on people.

123
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
So the nightmare scenario is you have your,

124
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
let's just take the simple case, your Photoshop file

125
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
for your very picky printer company,

126
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
and your Creative Cloud updates

127
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
because you leave your iMac Pro on all night, of course,

128
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
to do your updates.

129
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
And all of a sudden, you open that same file the next day

130
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
and the color is gone, so they're just black.

131
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
And not like a nice black, but like a void out black, right?

132
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
And that's not how local apps are supposed to be.

133
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
But you know what?

134
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
You know how the verge says, what's a button?

135
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
We should have, what's an app?

136
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Right. What is an app?

137
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Is a local app that gets updated by a cloud service

138
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
that's tied into some sort of authentication mechanism

139
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
that's always checking in and auto-installing updates?

140
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Is that truly a local app? Sounds like a hybrid app to me.

141
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
What if the platform vendor can turn off an app

142
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
or remove it from your device?

143
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
They totally can. They totally can remove your licensing.

144
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
What if, and I just had this ugly experience,

145
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
you have an app that you paid for years ago,

146
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
you open your iPad, you try to run it, and the app runs fine,

147
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
but because the company no longer exists,

148
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,000
their REST API no longer exists, and it does nothing.

149
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
So is that a local app then? No.

150
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
No, I think they're all, eww, services, eww, we should move on.

151
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
See, that's our first scary thing.

152
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
New Jersey.

153
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
So Matt wrote in to push back a little bit

154
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
on license being gatekeeping.

155
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
His core point was that, well, somebody's got to sign off

156
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
on things that are like professional public works

157
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
that need to be safe for the public to use.

158
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Part of the responsibility, he writes,

159
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
of a professional engineer is to sign off on projects

160
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
that meet all the regulations,

161
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
and then they need some point of responsibility

162
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
if there are mistakes they've made

163
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
that result in some sort of major issue.

164
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
He says, sure, this isn't maybe necessary for web developers

165
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
or a lot of common software development,

166
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
but he says you might be able to argue it is

167
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
for somebody working on the 737, for example.

168
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
So he says it's not gatekeeping in all cases,

169
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
and sometimes it's just good for public safety.

170
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000
And maybe the argument also I think that might resonate

171
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
is holding someone accountable for a mistake.

172
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Sure.

173
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I mean, that is a great idea.

174
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
And I actually agree with it,

175
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
but it kind of falls apart when you see in practice

176
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,000
how these licensing schemes tend to be used.

177
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I would say with the great exception of the type

178
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
of public work he's talking about, like bridges.

179
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Fair. I think you're right.

180
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
The actual implementation has shown us

181
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
that it is being abused.

182
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
There's clearly some use case for it,

183
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
which is probably why it came around to begin with.

184
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
But now it's just gone too far.

185
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I'm with you on that.

186
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
So yeah, that was Matt. Now Matthew wrote in.

187
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
So we've got Matt and Matthew this week

188
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
with some uniform ideas.

189
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
He says if you go with one thing,

190
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
it's doomed to failure in the long run.

191
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Your preferences will change, companies will drop items.

192
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
That has been on my mind.

193
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Instead, I propose you strive for an interoperable wardrobe,

194
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
a modular wardrobe, you know,

195
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
anything with maybe like an open source core.

196
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
For instance,

197
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
my work shirts can be worn with regular jeans

198
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
or more formal pants I own.

199
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
With this strategy, if you don't want to think about

200
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
what you wear, you just grab the first thing off the rack

201
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
and you're good to go.

202
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
And if you're feeling in particular,

203
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
you can grab a pair instead.

204
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Hope to hear the conclusion to your quest soon.

205
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Those are good points.

206
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Interoperable I think might be the way to go.

207
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
It's like a mix and match and that I believe,

208
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
my wife corrected me,

209
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I thought a wardrobe capsule, because I'm an idiot,

210
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
was just like a whole outfit,

211
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
shirt, pants, socks, whatever.

212
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I don't know what makes a whole outfit.

213
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
But she's saying nah.

214
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
It's actually, this is what she says,

215
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
she says nah, she says nah.

216
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
It's actually mix and match.

217
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
It's like different shirts that go with different pants,

218
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
but they all go together.

219
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
That's a wardrobe capsule.

220
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
So I think maybe I need a wardrobe capsule.

221
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I don't know why it's called a capsule.

222
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
And not just a wardrobe,

223
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
but it's a wardrobe capsule.

224
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I kind of didn't get this email.

225
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
It reminds me of the Skyrim created character thing,

226
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
where all the pieces kind of go together.

227
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Yes.

228
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
So that's what it is.

229
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Yeah, I need a character creator.

230
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
And then I asked the audience out there

231
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
if anybody else uses a dedicated PC for Emacs or some other job,

232
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
and Don noted that he has a dedicated PC

233
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
for his banking and his crypto purchases.

234
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
So there you go.

235
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
And then we made a note in the doc for Mumble Colony,

236
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
but I don't remember what that's in regards to.

237
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
We do have a Mumble though at jupitabroadcasting.com.

238
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Mumble is still around?

239
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Yeah, still around.

240
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
We use it on LUP still

241
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
and on office hours quite frequently.

242
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
There you go.

243
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Now you learned.

244
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Today you learned.

245
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
linode.com slash coder.

246
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
That's where you go to get $100

247
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
in 60-day credit on a new account.

248
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
And it's a great way to support the show

249
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
while you're checking out some fast, reliable cloud hosting.

250
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
You got to try Linode for your next project.

251
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
It's what we use for everything

252
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
we've built and deployed recently.

253
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
It's part of what makes our new website seem fast.

254
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Linode makes us look good.

255
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
They've been rolling out MVME storage upgrades too,

256
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
so the performance there is super great.

257
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
They are their own ISP.

258
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
They have a whole range of systems

259
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
from nanodes that are just tiny little boxes

260
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
that maybe do like one job,

261
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
a nano box to these monster systems

262
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
like we use for our matrix system.

263
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
If you're a performance hound,

264
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
you're going to love the combination

265
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
of CPU options, GPU options,

266
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
and storage options.

267
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
And next year, they're lighting up a dozen

268
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
new data centers.

269
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Linode's just simply the best place

270
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
to host and run your code.

271
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
And they have a bunch of one-click deployments

272
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
for tons of open source applications,

273
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
GitLab and GitT,

274
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
and things that are just really quick

275
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
and get up and going like Nextcloud.

276
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
They'll also let you build it up from scratch

277
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
with just about any distro you'd ever want to use

278
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
in the cloud. They've got a big range of distributions,

279
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
a great dashboard,

280
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
a clean API, and best of all,

281
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
you can get a hundred bucks

282
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
while you support the show to try it all out.

283
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
You just go to linode.com slash coder.

284
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
There has been a story that's been super

285
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
embarrassing for Apple since we gathered

286
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
together last week, and it's really gross.

287
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
It all kind of comes together here.

288
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Apple is flexing control over the

289
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
App Store in such a

290
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
grotesque, overreaching way

291
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
that it's absolutely going to limit

292
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
development of some industries.

293
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
It's already holding back companies

294
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
like Telegram. Telegram's CEO

295
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
has accused Apple of destroying dreams

296
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
and crushing entrepreneurs.

297
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Sounds like my ex-wife.

298
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
He said that

299
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
they had a feature they wanted to roll out.

300
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
They would have been kind of like

301
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
an in-app payment thing, but Apple

302
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
wants a 30% cut of any of that

303
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
type of stuff. Apple's also updated

304
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
their rules to say they're going to get a cut of any

305
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
NFT sales done

306
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
inside an Apple

307
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
iPhone. Did they really

308
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
relocate to Jersey too? I know,

309
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
right?

310
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Their App Store department must be over there.

311
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Also, all of the

312
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
little boost or favorite of post

313
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
or Facebook thing where you can buy something to

314
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
make your post stand out. All of that

315
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
stuff now. Apple just announced

316
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
they also want a 30% cut of all of that

317
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
stuff. This is major.

318
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I actually have a sound bite from Tim Cook

319
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
on this. Okay.

320
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I'm altering the deal.

321
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Pray I don't alter it any further.

322
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I know. Which historically

323
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
he's definitely going to.

324
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
This has really

325
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
gotten to a new level.

326
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Alex Gigatexel, he pointed out

327
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
a clip from Coderadio 197

328
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
back in 2016

329
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
where we were kind of going on about how

330
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
bad the App Store discovery was

331
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
and how bad the search was.

332
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Slowly but surely, what Apple has done is

333
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
instead of fixing search in the App Store,

334
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
they've introduced new and new layers

335
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
of advertising. Along with

336
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
just squeezing down

337
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
on every way these apps

338
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
can potentially deal

339
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
with money at all. Even if

340
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
they're doing everything within the app ecosystem,

341
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Apple wants a cut. They're also

342
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
at the same time loading up

343
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
the App Store with more ads. They just got in a bunch

344
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
of trouble because they had gambling ads

345
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
that people hated right next to developers

346
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
apps that were about mental health

347
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
and whatnot. There was one in particular

348
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
that was literally an app to help

349
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
you quit gambling. They say they've

350
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
paused the ads related to gambling and a few other

351
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
categories on the App Store now.

352
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
But the fact that it made it in there in the first

353
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
place, that's a shift for

354
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Apple. Remember?

355
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Apple wasn't willing to cross that line until recently.

356
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
In fact, we used to criticize them for being

357
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
too puritanical. They were like

358
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
they had some pretty

359
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
strict censorship things. They've kicked

360
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
apps out if you could somehow

361
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
leap out from the app and then end up on a gambling

362
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
site. They've kicked an app out of the App Store before.

363
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
And now they're running gambling

364
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
ads.

365
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
They've paused them.

366
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
It's like how

367
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
the PayPal $2,500

368
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
fine for misinformation got out and everybody

369
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
freaked out. Did you know they're putting it back in?

370
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Now I don't know if the misinformation language is in there,

371
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
but they've slipped that $2,500 fine back in.

372
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
It's like people get outraged.

373
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
We get over it and then the companies just

374
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
kind of move on and they just tighten it down.

375
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
That's Apple's move here. So they've paused

376
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
it. They've paused it, they say.

377
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
But eventually, that line will

378
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
slip again. It'll be back.

379
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
And if they're willing to slip on this, what else

380
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
are they willing to slip on?

381
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
I agree with you,

382
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
but let me devil's advocate a little

383
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
for Uncle Tim.

384
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
For our dear, sweet Uncle Tim.

385
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
He needs to keep

386
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
the revenue growing. I think it's safe

387
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
to say there's not that

388
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
many humans left to sell iPhones to

389
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
that want them.

390
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Or can afford them at this point.

391
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Or can afford them with the price,

392
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
with the quote, inflation, i.e. price gouging.

393
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Is this just a function

394
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
of being a public company where

395
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
that chart has to go up and to the right

396
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
every quarter and

397
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
they know...

398
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
See, I have this thesis about

399
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
these big companies that they know in their heart of hearts

400
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
there is not going to be

401
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
the next big thing, and if so,

402
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
their only way to...

403
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Even if there is, their only

404
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
way to handle it

405
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
is to basically tax it.

406
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Where Apple is in a lot of

407
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
ways functioning as an IRS.

408
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
They are

409
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
taxing new businesses

410
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
and new innovation because

411
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
they own the iPhone and iOS and

412
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
related platforms.

413
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
I guess you could argue Facebook isn't doing this,

414
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
but it just seems like he's lighting

415
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
money on fire to give people legs,

416
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
which is a choice.

417
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
You know, the first time I think we've ever seen

418
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
this, Comcast NBC

419
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
is reporting too that their revenue is

420
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
down, that their subscribers

421
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
even on the Peacock streaming service are

422
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
up, but the Comcast revenue

423
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
is down. The

424
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Comcast division took a quarter with a revenue

425
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
decline of 14%.

426
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
The reason why I bring that up

427
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
is because Comcast strikes

428
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
me a little bit of what Apple is turning into.

429
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
They've built their infrastructure,

430
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
they've got the wire to everybody's home,

431
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
but now they can't really

432
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
get to more

433
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
homes fast enough. There's just not enough new homes

434
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
coming online to keep number

435
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
going up. Over the years,

436
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Comcast has layered

437
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
on all this stuff.

438
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Bought up companies and just done

439
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
everything they can to make number

440
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
go up.

441
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
After a decade of loose money,

442
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
I know this is my new

443
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
soapbox, but seriously,

444
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
it set the tone for

445
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
everything. It matters. I don't think we've

446
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
realized how much it matters.

447
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
With loose money, they soaked up all this

448
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
money, they bought up all these companies, they formed

449
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
NBC Universal, Comcast,

450
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Peacock, and even

451
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
after a decade of all that, they still can only

452
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
grow so much. Now

453
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
they have customers that are leaving

454
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
because better alternatives are eventually coming

455
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
along.

456
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
It's been like 10 years of this.

457
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Apple, I think, is earlier in this cycle.

458
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
They're at the beginning of this Comcast

459
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
cycle. Yeah,

460
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
I mean, I think they are. I think also

461
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
maybe this is going to get me some heat

462
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
from my elephant-loving

463
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
friends.

464
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
You know, maybe companies can only get so big.

465
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Right? And when you hit a certain

466
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
point of size and scale,

467
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
the cost of being that size

468
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
is just too

469
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
much. Maybe we just watched

470
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
a grand experiment in how big can

471
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
companies get. Because

472
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
unless money gets free again,

473
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
money was

474
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
better than free

475
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
because the interest rate was zero

476
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
and inflation was one,

477
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
two, four, and then seven, eight percent.

478
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
So for a while,

479
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
getting a loan was better

480
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
than free money. If you were a big company,

481
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
it was literally less than being taxed.

482
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
You were better off keeping your money in

483
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Ireland or wherever the hell.

484
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
And they don't get taxed on the

485
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
money they borrow. So they have all

486
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
these assets, they have all this wealth that they can use

487
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
as collateral. And you write off the interest

488
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
as a tax deduction. So you

489
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
get the government coming and going.

490
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
You don't have to pay taxes on the loan money

491
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
you use, and you get a write-off on the interest

492
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
for that loan money if there is interest.

493
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
And even now, the interest rates are still super low.

494
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
I mean, it was such a great deal for them.

495
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
And I wonder if we didn't just watch—

496
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
because it's been since 2008.

497
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
So we've been watching this happen.

498
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Perhaps we watched these tech

499
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
companies get as big as they're going to get. This was their

500
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
largest phase, and now it's just sort of more

501
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
leveled off growth from here. I'm sure they're probably going to still

502
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
go up because there's more humans all

503
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
the time. But I think the

504
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
years of just astronomical

505
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
growth after astronomical growth

506
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
could be coming to an end.

507
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Unless printers go

508
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
again. I'm not sure it may happen.

509
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Wow. We discussed this last week, and you were pretty—

510
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
I think eventually it will, yeah.

511
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
But I think you nailed it.

512
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Apple also is trying to get a cut

513
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
of social media network

514
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
advertising. You know, when you buy a little bit

515
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
of advertising in the app

516
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
to, say, run an ad on Facebook,

517
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Apple wants a cut of that.

518
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
It's incredible, because if you zoom out, what's happened here

519
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
is Apple turned

520
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
on the ATT, the application

521
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
cross-tracking. They set

522
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
up a block for that in a prompt, which knocked

523
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
about a billion dollars off of Facebook's revenue

524
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
and cut down on advertising

525
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
revenue for all these guys, then launched

526
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
their own ads. But just pause

527
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
there. Overnight, they flipped

528
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
the switch and nailed Facebook

529
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
for a billion dollars. That's

530
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
wild. When's the last time we heard something

531
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
like that? Even

532
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
you know, Pierpont Morgan

533
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
and the other railroad tycoons couldn't pull a move

534
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
that devastating to their competitor.

535
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
That's what I was thinking. It would have been

536
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
worldwide news.

537
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
It would have been a huge deal.

538
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
But it was Facebook, so

539
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
nobody cares. Well, they are evil.

540
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
But if they'd done something that cost the New York

541
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Times a billion dollars,

542
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
I think people would have cared. But it's Facebook,

543
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
you know, it's just stupid meta.

544
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Tailscale.com slash coder.

545
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Go there to get Tailscale for free

546
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
on a personal account. Up to 20

547
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
devices. That's a big flat network.

548
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Tailscale is a zero config

549
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
VPN. You get it set up in minutes on any

550
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
device, really. And it manages the firewall

551
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
rules, takes care of your nat

552
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
situation, even your double carrier grade

553
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
ultra-nats. I can attest to that.

554
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Devices connect directly to each

555
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
other using WireGuard's noise protocol.

556
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
They build a backend that helps you connect

557
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
them all simply and quickly using whatever

558
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
single sign-on provider you like,

559
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
including two-factor authentication support.

560
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
And they build a flat mesh

561
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
network that's always on. And it's

562
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
smart about how it handles traffic too.

563
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
It doesn't tunnel everything to Tailscale.

564
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
It just tunnels the stuff that's on

565
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
that LAN. And it also

566
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
does clever things like subnet

567
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
routing so you can actually get access to

568
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
entire LAN and it just does it so transparently.

569
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
I love

570
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Tailscale Send. I mention that all the time.

571
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
It's like AirDrop for all your machines.

572
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
But Tailscale SSH just

573
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
got better. So Tailscale SSH

574
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
allows you to establish SSH

575
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
connections between your devices in your

576
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Tailscale network as authorized by

577
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
your Tailscale access

578
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
controls. Like I have a machine I share with Alex

579
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
and I have a machine I share with

580
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
a family member just

581
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
through the access controls on Tailscale.

582
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
You don't have to manage SSH keys anymore.

583
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
It authenticates your SSH connection

584
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
using WireGuard and

585
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
to make things even better

586
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
just a couple of days ago

587
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
they launched the SSH client via the

588
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
web. So you can log in to the

589
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Tailscale console and right

590
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
there start up an SSH session

591
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
inside your web browser to one of your machines

592
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
in your Tailscale network.

593
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
So handy.

594
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
So powerful because for me

595
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Tailscale is how I also support my friends

596
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
and my family. My kids all their machines

597
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
are on Tailscale. My dad he's on Tailscale.

598
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
They're all on my network and when they

599
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
need help this is going to be one of the tools

600
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
I have available to me. Or if I need to fix something for

601
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
JB it's just another tool available

602
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
to me just integrated with Tailscale

603
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
and you can get set up in just minutes.

604
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
So go try it for 20 devices for free

605
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
and support the show by going to

606
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
tailscale.com slash coder.

607
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
We just love it. Everyone at JB

608
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
uses it. Tailscale.com

609
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
slash coder.

610
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
So in the theme of

611
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
scary spooky tech trends

612
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
for some reason my old man

613
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
cackles have gotten all riled up

614
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
over the continued gamification

615
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
of software development and now

616
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
new research has provided evidence

617
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
for what they say is quote significant impact

618
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
of gamification on the behavior

619
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
of developers on large

620
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
collaborative programming software platforms

621
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
but they urge caution

622
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
too because the

623
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
gamification they say can quote

624
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
steer the behavior of software developers

625
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
in unexpected and

626
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
unwanted directions and

627
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
if you remove the gamification

628
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
productivity drops off an

629
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
effing cliff. People

630
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
just stop participating entirely.

631
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
So not only do you incentivize things you

632
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
didn't expect and sometimes

633
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
it's like a big boost in how many people

634
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
are contributing and sometimes it's like

635
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
people gaming the system but it

636
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
does seem like there's really something to this

637
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
and I mention this

638
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
because the GNOME project

639
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
just announced they're shutting down their mailing

640
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
lists and they're moving to

641
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
systems like GitHub and

642
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Discourse and places where they can

643
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
implement gamification because they're seeing

644
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
good results in the GNOME community

645
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
from certain types of gamification.

646
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Fedora has done something

647
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
similar. They have a badge for contributors

648
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
and like the ButterFS, I have the

649
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
ButterFS badge for example. I think it's the number one badge

650
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
they gave out. The ButterFS badge

651
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
if you're a Fedora user if you

652
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
help test the beta that had ButterFS

653
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
and this gamification's

654
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
becoming more and more of a thing and I wonder if you

655
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
think this is a dark trend or a

656
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
good trend? Probably

657
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
fine.

658
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
I sort of feel like anything that gets

659
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
people coding more regularly and improving their

660
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
craft is good.

661
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
I will tell you that since switching to

662
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
GitHub I am an addict for the

663
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
that little tile

664
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
mosaic tile thing on how many commits you do

665
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
in a day. Yeah.

666
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Yeah. It works, right?

667
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
I mean anybody who's played like World of Warcraft

668
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
or an MMO knows if there's a bar

669
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
there's a certain personality type that will fill that

670
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
bar. Yep.

671
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
I would say

672
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
maybe it is like taking advantage

673
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
of certain dopamine triggers and

674
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
you know psychological responses

675
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
and certain personality types.

676
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
But I don't know. At least

677
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
I feel like I'm using it for good.

678
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Although I should say GitHub is

679
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
definitely using me.

680
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
The study by the way was done by Cornell University.

681
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
And I think it's interesting that they

682
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
urge caution. I don't know.

683
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
I think you're right.

684
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
I think you're probably right. Getting more people to

685
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
do their craft

686
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
and get better at that and

687
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
participate in a community and learn those skills

688
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
is generally a good thing. More of that's

689
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
a good thing. So let's say it's a good trend

690
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
then. Yeah so addicting to people to positive

691
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
things is good. I got one that's

692
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
driving me absolutely crazy

693
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
and we're just going to have to put up

694
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
with it. And I'm really debating

695
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
on how much we even want to talk about it on the show.

696
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
It's relevant to developers

697
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
in the sense that

698
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
developers got to eat,

699
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
developers got to sell, and developers got to

700
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
promote. But

701
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
I think this trend

702
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
that's always been there since

703
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
the early days of Apple, people

704
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
used to attribute everything

705
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Apple did, every arrogant move,

706
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
every petulant thing Apple did, they

707
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
attributed it directly to Jobs. Then Steve Jobs

708
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
died and Apple just got more

709
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
petulant.

710
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
And we're seeing that now with Elon.

711
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Somebody's tweet gets

712
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
labeled as misinformation and you

713
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
see somebody posting, oh snap

714
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
dog, Elon just labeled this

715
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
post misinformation, shoot.

716
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Elon makes

717
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
this decision. It's going to be Elon this,

718
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Elon that. It becomes a cult of

719
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
personality, completely disregards

720
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
all of the engineers and developers and

721
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
people underneath all that that are

722
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
actually involved in the decision process.

723
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
And also I think where it matters

724
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
to our audience is if they are on social

725
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
media to help promote their app, their site, their service,

726
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
their business,

727
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
you're kind of watching this a little bit going

728
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
where the hell is this going?

729
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
And how is this going to affect me?

730
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
I don't know if you saw this and just picture

731
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
yourself as one of these engineers for a

732
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
moment. Because I'm

733
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
a Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde

734
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
about this. Part of me absolutely

735
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
loves the

736
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
savageness

737
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
of it and then part of me thinks like

738
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
God could you imagine being an engineer in this position.

739
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
So Twitter engineers were told to print

740
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
out their last 30 to 60 days

741
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
of code so they could show it to Elon

742
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
himself. Then they were told to wait, actually

743
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
just shred all that code you printed out and

744
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
upload it to this platform.

745
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
And Elon has brought in Tesla

746
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
engineers to do code

747
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
reviews of everyone's last 30 days

748
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
of the work. And then

749
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
you may end up having a little conversation

750
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
with Elon or a Tesla engineer

751
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
who's essentially a proxy.

752
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
In one way like I said it's

753
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
absolutely savage because you'll only

754
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
truly get answers to what's really going on if

755
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
you go all the way to the source code. At the

756
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
same time

757
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Elon is setting these deadlines like if you don't

758
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
get it done you're fired. Another one is

759
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
they're trying to build Twitter blue so that way it's

760
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
a $20 a month subscription.

761
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
And Elon gave them like a deadline at

762
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
the end of November and if they don't get it done they're

763
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
fired. So it's really

764
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
just like we're reviewing your code we're going to sit down

765
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
at your desk with you we're going to go over it we're going to ask you

766
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
questions and oh by the way you also

767
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
need to get this new feature built

768
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
and if you don't get it done you're fired.

769
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Part of me thinks God this is a brilliant strategy

770
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
by Elon because he's going to totally

771
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
clean house and bring the head count down which is job

772
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
number one. It sounds absolutely terrifying

773
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
as a human being to be in that

774
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
position as a staffer to have

775
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
the world's richest man or his proxy

776
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
sit down next to you and ask you well what the hell

777
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
are you doing here. First of all Steve Jobs

778
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
used to do this all the time.

779
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
All the time. Right.

780
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Get it done or get out

781
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
was his his his line

782
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
right. I only want A players.

783
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
He did a speech when he was an

784
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
interview. In fact I have it on tape.

785
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
It was when he was at next talking about

786
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
why B players suck and they're not. I know

787
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
A players only want to play with A players

788
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
and if you make them play with B and C players they get pissed off

789
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
and they want to leave. As a management practice

790
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
no it's probably not great right.

791
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
But I wisely

792
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
thanks to the admonishment of an

793
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
older more beautiful haired

794
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
friend of mine named Chris Fisher

795
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
refrained from tweeting anything about

796
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
the Twitter acquisition

797
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
because remember Chris Fisher says tweeting

798
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
is bad. You'll notice

799
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
I very tweet very rarely.

800
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
You notice my tweets have gone down significantly

801
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
since that episode. I just

802
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
put that out there. It's

803
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
hard to overstate how

804
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
mismanaged Twitter really has

805
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
been for very long

806
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
and Twitter's headcount doesn't make a

807
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
ton of sense. I'm

808
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
sort of surprised at all this pearl clutching

809
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
about the people at Twitter

810
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
when if you look at Twitter

811
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
I mean it's a

812
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
shitty business.

813
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
It's not well run.

814
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
For instance someone I saw tweet from one of

815
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
the Twitter employees Elon made this change

816
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
and you know normally it would have

817
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
taken weeks of debate between the teams

818
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
and he's bragging about that as they're so

819
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
thoughtful. That's fucking terrible.

820
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
You should resign

821
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
in shame.

822
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
You're the tech business baby.

823
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
Roll roll roll.

824
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
I think it sucks that

825
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
they're in California and he can't just walk in

826
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
and fire them all like you could in Florida and give

827
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
them nothing because

828
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
I feel like a lot of that's what should just

829
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
happen and I know California has

830
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
stupid mandatory severance

831
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
but usually I'm more

832
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
sympathetic to the employees but

833
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
8000 people

834
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
and the best they could

835
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
come up with Twitter blue is that I can change the

836
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
color on the goddamn

837
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
highlight in the app and I can

838
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
briefly edit my tweet

839
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
or undo it to edit it and then they

840
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
edit a different kind of edit feature later.

841
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
That's

842
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
like I know

843
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
this is going to piss off a lot of the audience but like

844
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
maybe Twitter should have focused

845
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
on being a functional business

846
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
that is like a peer

847
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
to Facebook and you know it's direct

848
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
competitor and less about

849
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
you know wearing the hair shirt

850
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
and being the Virgin Mary on whatever

851
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
political ideology you may or may not have.

852
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
I think I agree I typically

853
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
I typically try to

854
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
be empathetic with the employee

855
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
in this situation but I think my inclination

856
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
would be to go full boss mode here because

857
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
he just made a huge acquisition

858
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
he massively overpaid

859
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
he's got to make this thing work.

860
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
He's also I think probably

861
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
smart enough to realize he's got a window

862
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
of time he's got about 90 days

863
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
you know like when a president comes into office

864
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
he's got 100 days he's got 90

865
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
days and then he's got other things

866
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
that need his focus like SpaceX

867
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
and Tesla. Additionally

868
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
he's in deep with military contracts

869
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
so he's got a lot of pressure

870
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
there to publicly get this

871
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
right. If you are involved at all

872
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
with that kind of stuff you see how

873
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
when things start looking bad

874
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
for you and your company the military gets less and less

875
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
interested in working with you they don't want that to

876
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
rub off on them. Well it's true if you have

877
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
financial strain you cannot

878
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
you generally will not pass a background

879
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
check and that goes for companies

880
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
and individuals so yes. The other reality

881
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
here is that a lot of the collateral

882
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
Elon put down to make this purchase came

883
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
from his Tesla stock and

884
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
if we go into a two year

885
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
recession I have to imagine

886
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
Tesla stock is going down. Tesla

887
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
just recently announced

888
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
they're lowering the price of

889
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
Teslas in China

890
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
because China's entering a recession

891
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
and so they're lowering the price of the car

892
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
so in China you can get a Tesla cheaper

893
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
now and it's probably going to happen here and if that

894
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
announcement happens you know their stock is going to

895
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
go down. That means the value of his collateral

896
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
will go down which means that he's

897
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
going to be on pressure to either add more collateral

898
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
or find another source of funding

899
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
all of which means act quick

900
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
act ruthlessly turn this thing around

901
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
figure out where the rot actually is

902
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
because I think all of us regardless

903
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
of your position would acknowledge there has

904
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
to be some rot inside Twitter.

905
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
It's also that but Chris let's just say like

906
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
JB and the Mad Botter

907
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
merged right

908
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
and you were the new boss and

909
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
you found out that a couple of my employees

910
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
were just going around

911
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
talking about what an asshole you are

912
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
and you know the Jupiter culture

913
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
the TMB culture is never going to be the same

914
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
because of Jupiter broadcasting

915
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
I mean I

916
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
feel like Elon's been incredibly patient

917
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
I would expect you to simply fire them or worse

918
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
make me fire them right. Well here's

919
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
my question for you is maybe this should be a little more standard

920
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
practice because what is actually the product he just

921
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
paid 44 billion dollars for if not the source code

922
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
and the staff right. So it's a great

923
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
time to figure out what the hell's in the code. Printing it out

924
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
is a little is a little silly printing it on

925
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
paper. That was that was corrected. Of

926
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
course he wants the code reviewed. In

927
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
fact if he didn't waive due diligence he

928
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
probably should have done that before.

929
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
I mean I don't I don't

930
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
know. It's just like

931
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
and I'm not saying that I

932
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
want Twitter to become a hellscape or anything like

933
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
that. It's the idea

934
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
that man buys

935
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
company. All these people now work

936
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
for this guy and they spend it seems

937
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
like a good part of their working day just

938
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
watching him spying on him bashing

939
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
the out of him.

940
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
Yeah let's reverse it. We merge

941
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
I'm in charge.

942
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
You better believe if somebody is running around

943
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
saying how much I suck and oh he did this

944
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
stupid jackass thing that I just fire them.

945
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
Did you see that screenshot

946
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
that Elon posted where they admitted

947
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
in their internal chats to

948
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
fluffing the numbers.

949
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
And they said literally we're

950
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
basically doing what Elon is accusing

951
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
us of. And I'm sure that they are

952
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
right. You know

953
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
what's funny on Twitter

954
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
I have noticed a lot less

955
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
engagement. Now granted I've been posting

956
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
less maybe that's the algorithm but

957
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
my whole feed

958
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
is just like Elon Hay and Magic the Gathering

959
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
30th anniversary of course.

960
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
Mine's Elon Hay and Star Trek.

961
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
Right. So we have our vices but

962
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
yeah. And I have

963
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
been I swear to God less

964
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
like you shall post like a coding tip

965
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
or something every couple days just

966
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
the amount of like political

967
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
vitriol like this isn't a club

968
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
I want to hang out at anymore. This is not

969
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
a bar I want to hang out at. Yeah. And ironically

970
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
Mike I my prediction ultimately

971
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
is is that the reign

972
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
of Elon is not significantly that

973
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
much different in terms of moderation and

974
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
censorship. Well he already said he's

975
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
forming a council which is exactly what they always

976
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
said. So it's like it just means

977
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
maybe the moderation and the censoring will take

978
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
longer as the council has to form

979
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
or whatever instead of just like some

980
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
Twitter employee internally deciding to flag

981
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
it. But it's still going to happen.

982
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
It's not. I have purchased

983
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
over the years not a ton but

984
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
it's not insignificant amount for the size

985
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
of my business Twitter ads. And

986
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
as much as I hate Facebook I would

987
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
take every dollar if I was to

988
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
do that kind of advertising again and put it

989
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
to Facebook. Yeah. The results

990
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
I did a AB the results were pretty

991
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
pretty clear.

992
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
I mean if he lays off

993
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
a good chunk of people and does a $20

994
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
a month Twitter blue that

995
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
you know to get verified that all of these media

996
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
personnel every all the you know Twitter

997
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
elites are going to sign they're all going to pay the 20 bucks

998
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
to keep their check mark. He may just

999
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
turn it around in a couple of days. He's

1000
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
given a deadline in November 7th. I just looked it up

1001
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
not the end of November. He gave the developers

1002
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
November 7th to get that going. He gave

1003
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
them Halloween with their kids. See

1004
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
yeah it's so nice of him. You know I think

1005
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
people who think Elon is an idiot and

1006
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
you know everything that everything

1007
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
that's happened to him has just been dumb luck and that he hasn't

1008
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
built anything and he isn't any kind of engineer

1009
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
as we've been debating. I think they're missing

1010
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
the mark. I think what he is is erratic. He's

1011
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
manic. He's manic and he probably doesn't

1012
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
have you know a governor that says don't

1013
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
post that like he just recently posted

1014
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
something about Nancy Pelosi's husband

1015
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
didn't even need to get in wait into that right.

1016
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
Just don't even wait into that. Now that was

1017
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
just stupid. Yeah that was it was dumb.

1018
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
Yeah but he has been very

1019
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
savvy in some ways like he's taking this private

1020
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
so that way he can basically butcher the internals

1021
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
of the company and not worry about the stock price and the

1022
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
shareholders freaking out right. That's a pretty

1023
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
clever move just because if you're really going to make brutal

1024
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
changes that's how you do it. I don't know if

1025
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
we can see are we going to watch this guy run three or four

1026
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
companies. That's going to be interesting.

1027
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
He's going to have to hire right. This

1028
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
is this. He's not the first. This is not

1029
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
like that unique of a situation.

1030
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
He's going to be here for maybe a month

1031
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
maybe two. He's going to do

1032
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
the dirty work because he and then he'll

1033
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
bring in a healer right.

1034
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
A you know

1035
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
agreeable CEO to the remaining

1036
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
staff. That's going to be like we've been through

1037
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
some hard times guys but I'm your guy

1038
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
now and or gal.

1039
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
And you know what we're going to build back better.

1040
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
We're going to. It's going to be Joe Biden.

1041
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
No I think you're right. I think it'll be a woman.

1042
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
I think that's I think that'd be a smart move. I said

1043
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
Joe Biden you said woman. That's that's not a great

1044
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
clip. It just

1045
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
can't be Sheryl Sandberg because

1046
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
that idea wouldn't that be funny.

1047
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
That'd be terrible. That'd be hilarious.

1048
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
No one wins in that scenario.

1049
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
I mean everybody's going to be looking for

1050
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
a job soon if things keep going on. This is wild

1051
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
so Metta's revenue

1052
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
are down just a titch like 4 percent

1053
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
just kind of a minor miss

1054
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
with everything going on especially

1055
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
the absolute decline

1056
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
in the advertising business which is what hit them.

1057
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
Wall Street absolutely freaked out about the decline

1058
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
but then also when combined with the increased

1059
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
expenses and investment in the metaverse

1060
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
stuff Metta

1061
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
was punished. Their stock looked like

1062
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
like a crap cryptocurrency that

1063
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
Elon had recently pumped. It was

1064
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
a crash.

1065
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
I mean we haven't seen anything like that in a while.

1066
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
Jim Cramer your good buddy on CNBC

1067
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
actually cried

1068
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
on television because he's been pumping Metta

1069
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
all year. Metta's going to the moon he's been saying

1070
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
and he got called out on live TV

1071
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
and he started shedding a tear.

1072
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
Such an idiot.

1073
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
No no. First of all be nice to my

1074
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
good buddy Jim Cramer. We all know each other if

1075
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
we've ever been to New York. We literally are

1076
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
all cousins. Second

1077
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
of all he's not the first person to get seduced

1078
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
and screwed over by Mark Zuckerberg.

1079
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
So you know

1080
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
cue Edward Stafford.

1081
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
We got to play this. I got to play this for you because it's just

1082
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
so. Do it. Play. I knew you were

1083
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
going to do this. It's so awkward.

1084
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
Alright go ahead. Free cash flow

1085
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
last year.

1086
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
9.5 billion. Now less

1087
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
than 1 billion.

1088
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
I didn't say this about this.

1089
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
I made a mistake here.

1090
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
I was wrong.

1091
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
I trusted this management team.

1092
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
That was ill-advised.

1093
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
Your brochure

1094
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
is extraordinary.

1095
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
And I apologize.

1096
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
Okay.

1097
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
What did you

1098
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
get wrong? He just sits there and

1099
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
thinks about it.

1100
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
It's like Wonder Woman's got him in the

1101
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
lasso and he's thinking on all his sins.

1102
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
No.

1103
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
That's a lot of money.

1104
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
You imagine he and his charitable trust

1105
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
he does this whole thing for charity. I'm pretty

1106
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
sure he also

1107
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
majorly screwed up here.

1108
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
The company's Reality Labs division which houses

1109
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
its VR headsets lost over 9

1110
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
billion. I'm sorry. I'm sorry

1111
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
Chris. We call that the we're on a drunk bender

1112
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
burning hundred dollar bills y'all

1113
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
division. So if you add it all up what they've

1114
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
spent so far it's more money

1115
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
than Apple spent to create the iPhone. But

1116
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
if you even adjust it for inflation

1117
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
Meta has spent more money

1118
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
on Reality Labs than

1119
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
the US government spent at least from what we know

1120
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
on the atomic bomb even

1121
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
adjusted for inflation. So you could win

1122
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
a war build the most successful

1123
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
product of all time and

1124
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
still not have legs in the metaverse.

1125
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
I actually think most people's

1126
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
take on this is wrong because if

1127
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
you think about it money

1128
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
numbers have lost really all meaning.

1129
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
Two hundred and fifty billion is last

1130
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
year's five years twenty five billion.

1131
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
Right. I mean the money really like we say

1132
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
have been saying has been running loose.

1133
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
And if you're a powerhouse of a company

1134
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
that's just absolutely harvesting

1135
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
money on ads by tracking people

1136
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
and really nailing them with relevant

1137
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
ads especially like Instagram. I hear that's

1138
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
really successful on Facebook I imagine

1139
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
you know from little dabbling I've

1140
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
done on the advertiser side it seems extremely

1141
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
accurate. They're harvesting so much

1142
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
money. What do you want them

1143
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
to do like put it on the bank and let it inflate

1144
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
away and then draw attention to how much money they're

1145
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
making as a as an advertiser

1146
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
or why not

1147
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
dump it into something that might be the next platform because

1148
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
they also have the Comcast problem here.

1149
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
They've saturated the market.

1150
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
There's nowhere else to go. So they

1151
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
either have to just build the next platform

1152
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
or just wait for Facebook

1153
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
to eventually fade and die which we all

1154
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
know it's going to happen. It happens to all these platforms.

1155
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
So they could you know maybe have

1156
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
a shot if they could somehow build the next thing

1157
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
and so why not take that money

1158
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
why not take that 9 billion

1159
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
and channel it into research and development.

1160
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
Now it's a loss. Now it's a

1161
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
write off. You're not drawing attention to how

1162
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
much money you're setting on how much money your little tech

1163
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
companies making and you're investing in the

1164
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
next thing that might possibly work. I actually

1165
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
don't think it's that crazy of a strategy.

1166
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
The issue is investors

1167
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
don't want to see crazy amounts of

1168
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
R&D more so than any other tech company

1169
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
and they don't want to see a decline in revenue

1170
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
at the same time. If they were spending

1171
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
1 billion

1172
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
instead of 9 billion this last quarter if they'd

1173
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
spent 1 billion in a quarter

1174
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
I don't think this would be a headline. It wouldn't be a story.

1175
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
If they'd spent what

1176
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
Microsoft spends this wouldn't be a story.

1177
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
But because they spent what Microsoft and Apple

1178
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
and Google spend combined

1179
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
it's quite the story.

1180
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
But then again

1181
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
it's all relative to how much damn money you got.

1182
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
That's it.

1183
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
And if you're making a lot of money and money's been

1184
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
loose it's all relative.

1185
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
Yeah...

1186
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
I mean you're right

1187
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
but it's a lot of

1188
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
money no matter how you slice it. But what's he gonna

1189
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
do? He could turn around and spend

1190
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
that 9 billion on what? Making Facebook

1191
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
better? It's a mature

1192
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
product. I don't really

1193
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
know what else they could get into that would be successful.

1194
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
You see them buy these other things and it just sort of

1195
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
levels off. Okay so isn't this the Microsoft

1196
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
problem though? Microsoft

1197
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
circa 1999

1198
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
I guess. You have

1199
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
dominance in one place. You are

1200
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
extremely mature, extremely successful

1201
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
product slash business.

1202
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
And okay so then you get Office

1203
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
right? This is what they did. They island

1204
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
hopped into different businesses and

1205
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
then eventually that was a

1206
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
problem because of

1207
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
antitrust. I think that's kind of why

1208
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
Microsoft's pivot into open source

1209
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
and really building cross platform development

1210
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
tools has been so surprising because very

1211
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
rarely do large companies

1212
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
make a successful pivot like that. Well I think

1213
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
it's just it's hard to be good at multiple things.

1214
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
And I

1215
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
don't know. Also

1216
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
Facebook's brand has really taken

1217
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
a beating right?

1218
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
I mean even my aunties who love

1219
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
Facebook because God forbid

1220
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
they miss a picture of their great nephew.

1221
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
Kind of

1222
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
hate it now. Mostly because

1223
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
it disallows them to fight about

1224
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
their incredibly strange political

1225
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
ideas.

1226
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
One of them is Karl Marx.

1227
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
One of them is Mussolini.

1228
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
So that's where I that's where I live.

1229
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
I hate

1230
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
Facebook because I can't look for a goddamn

1231
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
bicycle pump without being haunted for three

1232
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
months. Yeah then once you get the pump you're still

1233
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
getting ads for pumps for everything. It's like well I already bought it.

1234
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
I bought the pump three months. We talked about this on the

1235
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
air. I bought it through. I'm still getting the ads.

1236
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
It's like guys I bought a pump.

1237
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
I'm cool. I buy one car mount once.

1238
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
Years of car mount ads.

1239
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
Ask not what your podcast

1240
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
can boost for you

1241
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
but what you can boost for your

1242
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
podcast. We got

1243
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
a boost from Thought Criminal. Love

1244
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
that name. Nineteen hundred sats.

1245
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
Pew pew pew. Headline from the

1246
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
Beacon. Florida man suspended after

1247
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
going Newland on a striking mascot.

1248
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
Suggest better breeding in order.

1249
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
Takes new bride. I think that's

1250
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
him congratulating you for the marriage.

1251
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
The wedding. Thank you I think.

1252
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
I think. Yeah I love it though.

1253
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
Yeah you know the mascot

1254
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
has been pretty active the last couple days on Twitter.

1255
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
Going after

1256
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
people setting the record straight. I don't know

1257
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
if you've noticed that. I know. He's

1258
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
been our personal Elon. Really has been.

1259
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
I'm sure he'd love that. I'm sure.

1260
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
Purple Dog need to set their username

1261
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
boosted with six thousand sats.

1262
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
Boost! I've done estimates

1263
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
to come up with a quote. And then that quote

1264
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
has been ten to twenty percent padded to

1265
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
account for unknowns. But then a

1266
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
PM comes and plugs those estimates into

1267
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
Microsoft Project without the padding

1268
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
and tells the client we'll be finished

1269
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
on this exact date.

1270
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
Doesn't even account for

1271
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
annual leave.

1272
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
Bonus points if there's liquidated damages

1273
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
for being late. Also been

1274
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
brought into a project where the estimates for a

1275
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
web app were done by a developer who had never made

1276
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
a web app. I don't work there anymore.

1277
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
I agree.

1278
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
You know I gotta figure out a way

1279
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
to work in days off.

1280
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
I've gotta do it. Cause I'm like

1281
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
on a decade of no days off.

1282
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
So I gotta figure it out. I think

1283
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
what I need is a backup crew.

1284
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
You know like what is it called when you're in

1285
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
theater and you have like a person

1286
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
like an understudy. Yeah we need understudies

1287
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
dude. You know

1288
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
you just call up the understudy like hey man it's Halloween today

1289
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
I need you to fill in. Can you imagine?

1290
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
I think it'd be awesome.

1291
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
You know what the problem is though the understudies would start

1292
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
wanting to get jealous. Have you never seen Phantom

1293
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
of the Opera? We'll have a coup.

1294
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
Yeah. People would like them more

1295
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
because they wouldn't be so grumpy. You know

1296
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
they'd think everything's great cause they'd probably be younger I'm assuming.

1297
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
Cause I couldn't have an older understudy.

1298
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
I hated everything back in 2012. That's true.

1299
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
In fact I've mellowed out a lot.

1300
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
But the new ones they love everything.

1301
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
Anything that's new they love it.

1302
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
I love when I talk to someone super new to

1303
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
dev and they're like hey man I can just

1304
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
generate this on the server. I'm like

1305
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
you've discovered ERB or Jinja

1306
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
or any of the other technologies.

1307
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
All these things you're like oh that'll ultimately burn you.

1308
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
But they're still new to it.

1309
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
Every time someone says hey did you not see

1310
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
this thing? It's great. It's called Xamarin Forms.

1311
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
Be honest with me.

1312
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
Could you have an understudy that's older

1313
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
than you?

1314
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
That's weird right?

1315
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
I think I'd prefer it.

1316
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
Really? I think that sets up like a

1317
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
mentor. So you think you have this

1318
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
reverse personal relationship.

1319
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
I don't like it. Like a couple years ago

1320
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
I got pulled over by a cop. I don't

1321
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
actually remember why. I don't think it was that big of a deal but he was mad.

1322
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
Chris was shooting out the window.

1323
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
He was just like f***ing Mac 10.

1324
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
And I was drinking. Running on Macbook Air.

1325
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
I would guess he was like 22

1326
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
23 years old. Oh no.

1327
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
Almost half my age and it felt so

1328
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
weird to get talked down to by somebody

1329
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
half my age. I was like oh this is weird.

1330
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
You think alright son. Shut up.

1331
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
Right?

1332
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
No. Marcel boosts in

1333
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
with some Enterprise SATs 1701.

1334
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
I think the problem is a lot of these

1335
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
regulations around what's an engineer are just really

1336
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
outdated. Civil engineering boo-boos

1337
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
have been the cause for hundreds of lives.

1338
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
Hopefully JavaScript is never put in

1339
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
charge of something with that kind of power.

1340
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
I have some terrible news for him but keep going.

1341
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
I know. I know.

1342
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
And the worst part is they're front ends to access

1343
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
databases. Is complaining about

1344
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
a stoplight really a

1345
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
form of practicing engineering?

1346
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
If you claim that a bit of back of the napkin

1347
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
math is engineering then doesn't that

1348
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
sort of invalidate the entire profession?

1349
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
That is a huge point. Yeah.

1350
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
Great point.

1351
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
I'm going to read it again. If you claim that

1352
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
a bit of back of napkin math is

1353
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
essentially engineering doesn't that invalidate

1354
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
the profession? Napkin math

1355
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
by amateurs is engineering

1356
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
so engineering is napkin math

1357
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
by amateurs.

1358
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
Congrats on the wedding by the way.

1359
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
Thank you. So wow Marcel

1360
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
we totally

1361
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
missed this. You nailed this correct.

1362
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
The whole engineering no engineering

1363
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
whatever licensing is irrelevant to the case

1364
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
that came up. The gentleman who

1365
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
found that the stoplights were defective in what was it

1366
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
Oregon? Yeah.

1367
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
Yeah. He was just doing arithmetic.

1368
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
He has math. Not even like

1369
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
fancy. It was freaking arithmetic.

1370
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
You know let's be honest it probably started like he noticed

1371
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
the timing of the lights was probably off

1372
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
and it probably just went from there. Right. He probably had

1373
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
like an intuitive feeling and then was like yeah

1374
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
let me time this. I want to see.

1375
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
That's a huge point. And I can give

1376
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
a real example of this. I am not a CPA nor

1377
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
am I an accredited accountant of any kind.

1378
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
My friend owns a bar. He

1379
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
once asked me to help him figure out the profit

1380
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
margin. There was some deal with a local

1381
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
brewery on a keg of beer. These are the types

1382
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
of problems I face when I go out to lunch by

1383
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
the way. Sure. And naturally

1384
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
and you know what was I

1385
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
illegally operating as a CPA telling him the margins

1386
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
were only like 15 percent and they were screwing

1387
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
him because they lowered they lowered

1388
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
the price by 10 percent

1389
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
but they cut the size of the keg by

1390
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
25. You just have good

1391
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
lobes for business. I do have

1392
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
the lobes. Well my sales

1393
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
last quarter would suggest they don't but

1394
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
I don't

1395
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
know if that's your fault though. That might be you know

1396
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
when they fire people at Twitter I'm just going to get a job at Twitter.

1397
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
That's my plan. There you go. All

1398
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
right. We're going to round it out now

1399
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
with our last two boosts. Neve

1400
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
boosted in B O O S T

1401
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
with a row of ducks.

1402
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
So

1403
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
my dedicated EMAX machine is actually

1404
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
my faithful old System

1405
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
76 Lamer Pro the Lamer

1406
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
it boots Gentoo.

1407
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
Oh my God. And then hooks

1408
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
EMAX in right into a

1409
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
I guess rat poison

1410
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
window manager session. Incredible.

1411
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
I don't really code with EMAX

1412
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
but I almost exclusively use org

1413
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
mode for my writing in D&D campaigns

1414
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
work on my own website powered by Hugo.

1415
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
Hey on it. And I write notes.

1416
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
This is like nerd bingo. Yeah it is really

1417
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
a ding ding ding. Yeah. And he

1418
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
writes notes and documentation as well

1419
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
as writes ansible deployment scripts.

1420
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
You do bingo. Of course you do.

1421
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
A.K.A.

1422
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
automating Gentoo installations naturally

1423
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
because why not. I mean you got it right.

1424
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
He says for the record Neve

1425
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
says he doesn't work in tech works in

1426
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
logistics. I had no idea after

1427
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
that. I would after that description I

1428
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
would have absolutely assumed

1429
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
the the opposite. So thanks for the clarification.

1430
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
And our last boosts

1431
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
no almost last boost

1432
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
from

1433
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
a Hanukkah coming in hot with the

1434
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
news just said thanks for the awesome coin

1435
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
summary with six thousand sats.

1436
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
You're welcome. I hate to see

1437
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
the dog going getting pumped by Elon but

1438
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
it is what it is. And then

1439
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
we got ourselves a quick little

1440
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
boost from Mr. Quackers who just

1441
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
wanted to call him quack relations you Mike.

1442
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
I think that's a congrats. I'll take it.

1443
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
It's a treasure.

1444
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
You

1445
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
got you got you got people out there

1446
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
that wanted to send you some good wishes in

1447
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
their own way. Oh and actually the new wife

1448
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
sent me a message. Oh yeah.

1449
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
I sort of I would say

1450
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
forced but I got her an

1451
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
iPhone when we first got together.

1452
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
Was she on Android previous. Oh she's real

1453
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
mad about it. Oh yeah. Oh really been a rough

1454
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
transition. She wants to know what the best Android

1455
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
phone is and it looks like

1456
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
yeah.

1457
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
Yeah. Oh really

1458
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
going back a failed transition

1459
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
a failed transition.

1460
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
Are you looking at the Paisel seven perhaps.

1461
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
She likes the Samsung.

1462
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
The problem is she had one of those crazy

1463
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
galaxy

1464
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
twos. So it's been a while.

1465
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
What's the what's the primary

1466
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
complaint with the iPhone quote. I hate

1467
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
everything about it.

1468
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
She likes I message which I thought was super

1469
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
interesting. She really likes I message.

1470
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
She doesn't like safari.

1471
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
She doesn't like that it doesn't tie into her Google

1472
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
stuff as well as

1473
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
as the Android did. She's got to go all in on the

1474
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
I cloud for that to really. Yeah but she basically

1475
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
lives in Google Google Docs

1476
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
and Gmail. Right. Yeah that's becoming really

1477
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
common. Yeah. Like her whole for

1478
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,000
her for her work it's it's

1479
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
just like passing paper around. So

1480
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
then you know I try to

1481
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
get her air mail the third party

1482
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
iOS app I use but I

1483
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,000
myself have trouble with it. It's

1484
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
handling Google Docs on iOS

1485
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
is kind of it's

1486
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
just rough. Yeah that whole Google

1487
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
ecosystem is just slightly better.

1488
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,000
It is better. I think it is somewhat

1489
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
better. So I'm thinking of I try

1490
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
to talk her into the pixel though I tell you what

1491
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
the Samsung has their crap on it. Why the

1492
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
pixel. It's the same old same old

1493
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
story. Also the pixel seven

1494
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
very well reviewed. You should show her

1495
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
like the MKB HD review or something. People

1496
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
are liking it. Well she's asking about

1497
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
folding ones. Oh interesting

1498
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,000
interesting. Aren't they super fragile though.

1499
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
This is something for the audience

1500
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
get back to us if you have a folding Samsung

1501
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
get back because you know I might try one myself.

1502
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,000
I would be curious as well. I'd really love to know people's

1503
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
experience and yours or hers if

1504
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
she gets one. Well you know how I responded to this complaint

1505
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
right. I bought her the

1506
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
AirPods Max. There you go.

1507
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
They will work with an Android. It just takes

1508
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
a little bit more work. I didn't tell her that

1509
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
just a little bit. Yeah

1510
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
if you'd like to send a boost into the show go to new podcast

1511
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
apps dot com and upgrade to

1512
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
a podcasting 2.0 app

1513
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
and send a boost into the show. Also thank you to

1514
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
our members for investing in the ongoing production.

1515
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
We have an email in the inbox this week

1516
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
from a company that wants us to

1517
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
secretly work with them to basically

1518
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
do a link share where they'll send us a bunch

1519
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
of fake downloads if

1520
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
we pay them. So usually we

1521
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
get pitched and they want to pay us. But this

1522
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
week we got pitched on paying them

1523
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,000
to jack up our downloads

1524
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
I guess and then we could turn around and

1525
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,000
lie to sponsors.

1526
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,000
I guess. I mean the whole

1527
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,000
thing is so funny. Is there a word for that? Frowd

1528
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
Frowd something

1529
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
Frowd. Frowd

1530
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
Frowdlient or something. Yeah

1531
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
well I didn't like it. Ultimately it would

1532
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
fail because

1533
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
people have to use the promo codes and go to your

1534
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
URLs and actually sign up. Yeah

1535
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
our sponsors it's not clicks right. You got to buy something.

1536
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
Yeah you actually got to use it.

1537
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
You got to sign up and try it out

1538
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
and so if you just send them a bunch of traffic

1539
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
OK that's that might count for something

1540
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
but it's not what's going to matter at the end of the day.

1541
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
So it only works for so long but I guess if you're

1542
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
doing that kind of stuff you know you're just

1543
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
running and gunning for money. Maybe you don't care. That's why I

1544
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000

You did it. You just called

it. We're all going to do it. It's just going to be a phase

1560
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
of life. It is the winter of Elon

1561
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
I guess. Now links to what we talked about
