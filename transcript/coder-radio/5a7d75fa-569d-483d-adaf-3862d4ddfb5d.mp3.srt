00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
This is KOTOR Radio, episode 478 for August 8th, 2022.

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Hey good buddy, welcome back to Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show, taking a pragmatic look at the art and the business of software development and the world of technology.

3
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,000
My name is Chris, and sitting there sharpening his wood knife, it's our host, Mr. Dominic. Hello Mike.

4
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Justice for Commander Una.

5
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Spoilers, hold on, we gotta wait until the end of the show because we gotta give people fair spoiler warnings.

6
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I got Wes Payne might be listening, I cannot get the guy to finish Strange New Worlds, I cannot get him.

7
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Okay, so we'll wait, we'll wait until that'll be...

8
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Yeah, we'll give him a clear disclaimer before we get there.

9
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Alright.

10
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
So, besides, for all we know, Egon's on vacation right now, he's also behind, and we don't want to mess that up.

11
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I know, Egon's just sailing the Mediterranean or something.

12
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Did he check with you?

13
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
You know, it was weird, nobody had been like, telling me I'm a moron.

14
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Yeah, like, who's gonna keep us in check if he's out there swimming?

15
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I feel a little lost.

16
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:18,000
It's just, yeah, it's like, it's a boat without a rudder, and I don't know, just at this point in our relationship, I expected a little more two-way communication.

17
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:24,000
You know, if we're gonna have a mascot and a Jesus of the show, they gotta let us know if they're gonna take a vacay, it feels like.

18
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I mean, have we become a little too homely for Egon? Do we have to chart it up a little, some heels, maybe?

19
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
You know, maybe the codependency turns him off.

20
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
That could be it.

21
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
You know, maybe we should go back to ignoring him for a few years.

22
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
We should do the three-day rule, you don't call back, right?

23
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Yeah, but in this show's term, it's three years.

24
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:51,000
We got some emails into the show at coder.show slash contact, and they're both taking us to task this week, so get your flame-retardant pants on.

25
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
The first one's not so bad.

26
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Bataya says, I wanted to start by saying thanks for making the show.

27
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
He calls it amazing.

28
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
It is amazing.

29
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:05,000
You know, it's helped me as a site reliability engineer understand how developers think and tools I can use to pretend to be a developer.

30
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Now, the thing I think you guys miss when you talk about how great it is to run your own GitLab is the scope creep and difficulty and troubleshooting that comes with it when things go south.

31
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I recently switched to GitLab.

32
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I was self-hosting it myself.

33
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I had an update go bad, and it actually made me rage quit, so now I think he's back onto a hosted GitLab.

34
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:33,000
There's so many log files without relevant info, and he says there's 6,000 lines of Chef config you have to go through, which brings its own service manager.

35
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
And finally, the resource usage is just too much.

36
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Eight gigabytes of RAM for a VM just to keep a personal instance of GitLab running?

37
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
No way.

38
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
He says something like GitT uses an order of magnitude less memory.

39
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Do these things influence your decisions to stay with GitLab, to self-host, or to migrate to something like GitHub?

40
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Thanks again for the show.

41
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
And I thought, okay, we should probably talk about the downsides of self-hosting when we do it.

42
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:04,000
And I'm curious what your math is for something that you want to self-host in terms of resource usage and monthly cost versus just using the service like GitHub.

43
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Yeah, but I feel like we just talked about this, because I also am making the same change from self-hosted GitLab to GitHub.

44
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Oh, same reasons as Matthias hits on here?

45
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Yeah, same reasons.

46
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:31,000
The cost of all the fancy GitHub stuff has gone down so dramatically, and the cost of a certain host who doesn't sponsor us anymore, hateful bastards, has gone up pretty significantly.

47
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Yeah, we did mention that recently. I remember that.

48
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Okay, so you're saying at one point the math worked out, but now the math has changed, is what you're saying?

49
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Well, another big change is GitHub actions have just become ubiquitous, and there's a lot of very simple pre-made actions for all kinds of deployments.

50
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,000
We'll talk about them one day, but fly.io and obviously Azure Heroku.

51
00:03:53,000 --> 00:04:00,000
We should totally talk about GitHub actions one day, because that's a cornerstone to how we're running the new website. It's all GitHub actions generating it.

52
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:09,000
We could go way off into the weeds on this, because I want to automate stuff and not have to pay people to do things stream once you get it set up.

53
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:17,000
This is also a debate we're having a lot in self-hosted, like where do you draw the line on what you host yourself versus what you just get a service provider to do.

54
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:23,000
The reason why I think we can't constantly be talking about the downsides when we decide to run this stuff ourselves is because it's unique to everybody.

55
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:31,000
It's unique to the hardware you have available to you, the budget you have for this kind of stuff, the privacy and security requirements that you have, the sovereignty requirements that you might have.

56
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,000
All that stuff is unique to every freaking individual or business.

57
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Yeah, and it could go application by application, too.

58
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Yeah, you really can nuance this thing.

59
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
All right, Dom hates his new Mac, and it's our fault.

60
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:50,000
He says, hello guys, I've been listening to the show for some years now, and I always hear you guys talking about how great Apple hardware is.

61
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:56,000
And for some time you've been going on about it, so you convinced me Mac OS is the best platform out there.

62
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:05,000
And my current work, I was given the option to pick a PC or a MacBook, and I totally went with the Mac M1 because I was hyped by the Apple propaganda you do in the show.

63
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Eight months in and I hate it.

64
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Multiple desktops are terrible.

65
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
The window manager is terrible.

66
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Sending windows to another monitor is a pain in the back resizing.

67
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Oh, well, you have to use the mouse for that.

68
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:24,000
The amount of customizations you need to do on this platform to get it in any decent shape is tremendous.

69
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I had to learn a sort of scripting language to use carabiner.

70
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I thought a proprietary window manager would do.

71
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:35,000
And then all other sorts of problems I've been running to every single day from taking a screenshot, copying, pasting with my right hand.

72
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Yeah, you know, not everyone is right handed.

73
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
And all of the arcane shortcuts I had to learn just hurt my hands.

74
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,000
And then every time I use an external DAC, it doesn't work, but it works just fine with Linux and Windows.

75
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Don't get me even started on the dongles.

76
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
It's awesome to carry an adapter everywhere when I want to bring an external keyboard or mouse.

77
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Just awesome.

78
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Want to talk about software compatibility in games?

79
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Virtual machines running on Mac OS?

80
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Database is not compatible with it?

81
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
List goes on.

82
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I wonder if you're really using the Mac or do you just like looking into charts with benchmarks and talk about battery life?

83
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
And by the way, this computer is getting really hot in the summer.

84
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Sorry for the rant, but I would like you to know that you're advertising Apple products for free.

85
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Spicy one.

86
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
That's a ghost pepper right there.

87
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
That's real hot.

88
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Yeah, habanero with a little bit of ghost pepper sauce.

89
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Yeah, so I read this.

90
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
You know, I gave it a lot of thought.

91
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I think there's a couple of things going on here.

92
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
One, personal taste.

93
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Everybody likes different stuff.

94
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:36,000
But I guess because I started working on a Mac a long, long time ago, I do a lot of things via the keyboard.

95
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000
And I maybe just know the keyboard shortcuts as muscle memory now.

96
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
There is that.

97
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
They really haven't changed some of them since like the late 80s.

98
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Yeah, I mean, yeah, really since like Tiger, right?

99
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
They really haven't changed them since Tiger.

100
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,000
There are some key combos that I have been using since Mac OS 6.

101
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
God damn.

102
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Yeah, yeah.

103
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
They called it OS 6 or whatever they called it back then.

104
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
It was like Macintosh.

105
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
It was weird.

106
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Yeah, I'm talking like 1988.

107
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I would I will say that the recent UI updates have been pretty bad.

108
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Right.

109
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
And I think we've talked about that some.

110
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
But to answer the direct question.

111
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Yeah, no, I work on a Mac all the time.

112
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I'm on a Mac right now.

113
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I'm very, very productive on Mac.

114
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
That doesn't mean you should be, though.

115
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
They have a very liberal return policy.

116
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Go ahead and return it.

117
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Right.

118
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I also work in a dev one all the time.

119
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Both both platforms have advantages and disadvantages.

120
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:36,000
The one that really I think is super fair in his criticism of Mac OS is the just software compatibility situation.

121
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:41,000
It is much more restricted than than my dev one for sure.

122
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I mean, I honestly I can just install Windows crap in my dev one most of the time and it just works.

123
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:54,000
When you said PC, I'm not sure if you meant Windows or Linux or both or some sort of Windows WSL.

124
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
We've got we got some feedback on that as well.

125
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Dude, return it.

126
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I don't know what to say.

127
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Hey, just return it.

128
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Get something you want.

129
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Yeah, I mean, he may be in a tough spot because it's a word.

130
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Maybe maybe a saw Linux will solve his problems.

131
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Oh, that's right. That's right. It was issued to him.

132
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
He didn't buy it.

133
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Here's my philosophy.

134
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:15,000
And it's it's just really simple is there's no perfect desktop environment.

135
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
There's no perfect desktop operating system.

136
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
And they all have significant upsetting flaws.

137
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
And it takes me an entire day to get plasma configured the way I like it.

138
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:29,000
It takes me, you know, half a day to get GNOME figured configured the way I like it.

139
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
And it takes me half a day to get the Mac configured the way I like it.

140
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
The breakthrough I had on getting the Mac to work for me.

141
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I've mentioned it before, but you know what?

142
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I made myself a budget like I can't remember now, 60, 80 bucks.

143
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
And I just said I will spend up to 60 or 80 dollars,

144
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:47,000
whatever it was on third party indie tools to improve the Mac experience.

145
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
And then I refused to go beyond that.

146
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,000
And I successfully got myself into a state that I think is quite usable.

147
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I've owned these apps for like two years now.

148
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I supported independent developers.

149
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
And now the Mac behaves the way I want it to.

150
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
You know what? That is such a good point.

151
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Because I realize a lot of my keyboard magic is actually from Magnet.

152
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Yeah, you got to have Magnet.

153
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
You got to have something like Magnet.

154
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Because I basically emulate the pop OS tiling.

155
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,000
You know, I will say that it's to Dom's point here.

156
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I feel that way on Windows, right?

157
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Like I get why people use Windows.

158
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I get why they like Windows.

159
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I just don't care for it.

160
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:23,000
So I only buy Windows machines like if I need them specifically for a job.

161
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
If you don't have Magnet, by the way, go ahead and you should try it.

162
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
There is a free alternative.

163
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
It's on GitHub.

164
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
We featured it in our tool episode.

165
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I don't remember the name, but...

166
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Yeah, we have talked about it.

167
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Yeah.

168
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
See, this is where I think maybe I disagree a little bit with Dom,

169
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
is I actually think we have been quite critical of the Mac.

170
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I mean, I think we just went on a rant last episode.

171
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
I mean, we spent like five years bitching about Apple, I'm just saying.

172
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
And we've talked about the tools you got to buy to make it usable.

173
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I just don't necessarily hold it completely against the platform

174
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
because I also have, I'm not even kidding you right now,

175
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I've kind of gone overboard.

176
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I have 15 extensions installed on my GNOME desktop.

177
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Now, I didn't pay for them.

178
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
And how is your desktop not crashing?

179
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
See, this is where I bitch about GNOME.

180
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I just refuse to install extensions now.

181
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I expect them to fail, but they fail more gracefully now.

182
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
They just sort of stop working instead of taking out your desktop.

183
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,000
So they've gotten it to a state now where between updates,

184
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
occasionally the extensions break, but...

185
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
So should I try again?

186
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
You could, yeah.

187
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
The way I'm doing it might be working better

188
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
because I'm doing it all through Nix.

189
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,000
And I've actually, I've defined the GNOME extensions through the Nix config.

190
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,000
So Nix is doing like a whole set of checks before it will build

191
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
to make sure those extensions are valid and stuff like that.

192
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Although I don't think it's bulletproof.

193
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
You should probably explain what Nix is for people like me.

194
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Actually, to be honest with you, the Mac doesn't seem so horrible

195
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
when I start to go down this route, does it?

196
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Because it's like, at least it makes sense.

197
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Where now I'm like, well, I have this special Linux distro.

198
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,000
So Nix itself is a really elegant, unique approach

199
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
to package management and system configuration.

200
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Think kind of similar to Ansible, but just specific to your machine

201
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
and defining everything in it.

202
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
And it's a much simpler config.

203
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
It's very clear, easy to read.

204
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I mean, I can do it, right? Simple.

205
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
And you go in there, you define, I want all this stuff on my system.

206
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,000
And then it intelligence, like if I say, you know, add Docker, right?

207
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
It goes through and intelligently figures out all of the stuff it needs

208
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
and it builds it all and then deploys it.

209
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
And then the great thing is, is that it supports rollbacks

210
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
and it won't deploy unless all the checks pass, right?

211
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
It has to build successfully first before it'll actually change your system.

212
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
That's pretty sweet, I mean.

213
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
It is. It is very sweet.

214
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:35,000
And so Nix OS is a Linux OS built using the Nix Package Manager.

215
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,000
You can put Nix Package Manager on Ubuntu or RHEL or whatever though.

216
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Oh, so it's agnostic. That's pretty cool.

217
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
In fact, you can put the Nix Package Manager on the Mac.

218
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
It's an alternative to Brew on the Mac.

219
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Ooh, I was going to say, if we're going to dunk on Mac,

220
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Homebrew is getting rough.

221
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:55,000
I mean, especially with the M1 transition, Homebrew, I, oh my God.

222
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Maybe it's time to try the Nix Package Manager on the Mac.

223
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
So I just think we're a little more pragmatic about it.

224
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,000
We don't really like have, you know, if anything, I'm probably biased towards Linux.

225
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I don't have a Mac or Windows bias necessarily.

226
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
But I kind of think DOM might have a Windows bias, to be honest with you.

227
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
When I read through that email, I mean, when's the last time you heard people

228
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,000
referring to PCs, right? It's Windows, Linux, and Mac boxes.

229
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:22,000
PC is kind of like the old Windows world, kind of like when an x86 box

230
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
equaled Windows box, so you just called them PCs.

231
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Yeah. Well, the other thing is if you have lots of experience on one platform,

232
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
you're obviously going to have an easier time on that platform.

233
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Like there is, there's absolutely a factor in that my, my mom was super early

234
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:41,000
into Adobe based, like we called it graphic arts back then.

235
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:46,000
So she was super into it. So as soon as Adobe 1.0 shipped,

236
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
we had a Mac in our house, and that was a long time ago.

237
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:54,000
And so, you know, I've just, those like command, the command keys to do things

238
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,000
on the, on the Mac are just sort of been ingrained for 30 years into my memory.

239
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,000
So I don't have a problem with it, but I could see somebody new coming over would.

240
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Let's talk about it at one of our West Coast meetups.

241
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
We have a whole batch of meetups. I don't know, a rash of meetups?

242
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
That's not the right word. A stash? No.

243
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:14,000
A murderer of meetups? Meetup.com slash Jupiter broadcasting,

244
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Southern Oregon, Sacramento, and then Southern California and Portland

245
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:24,000
are all coming up in the next few weeks. Details at meetup.com slash Jupiter broadcasting.

246
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
And then if you've been looking for an excuse to join our super cool

247
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:32,000
decentralized matrix room, we have a West Coast crew chat room

248
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
where we're talking with locals. We're sorting out details,

249
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:43,000
answering questions, getting ideas. That is at bit.ly slash West Coast crew,

250
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:49,000
if you'd like to join that. And then it all ends at JPL, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory

251
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,000
down there in Southern California. And we have the ability to extend

252
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:57,000
15 invitations to the audience. It's not a lot, but these are small tours.

253
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:02,000
If you go to coder.show slash JPL, you can put your name in the hat.

254
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
I can't obviously guarantee you're going to get picked. It's a small group.

255
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:10,000
But if you'd like to go and you can guarantee you can be in the area

256
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:18,000
on September 29th, coder.show slash JPL, we will be doing a small private tour

257
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. And then we'll also have a meetup

258
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
in the Sacramento area a little bit after that.

259
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,000
So if you can't make the JPL tour, but you're in the area, we can still see you.

260
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,000
All of that, again, meetup.com slash Jupiter Broadcasting. The West Coast crew

261
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:42,000
is bit.ly slash West Coast crew. And then the JPL tour hat is coder.show slash JPL.

262
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:47,000
It's the summer, you know, these meetups. We do these meetups in the summer

263
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:51,000
in part because there is a bit of a slowdown in the tech world.

264
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
And so it's a good opportunity for us to do this kind of stuff.

265
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:59,000
It's also for me, I think it's what actually keeps me going long term is these meetups

266
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
because there's something really special that happens at these.

267
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,000
So if you can make it, we'd love to see you.

268
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Linode.com slash coder. Go there to get $100 in 60 day credit on a new account.

269
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,000
And it's a great way to support the show. Linode is the developer's cloud

270
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,000
and they've got 11 data centers around the world so you can pick something close to you

271
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,000
or your customer slash client slash friends slash family.

272
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,000
If you like to build things yourself or you just prefer a one click deploy option,

273
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Linode has excellent options. New user, experienced user.

274
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,000
You've been deploying servers for 20 years. You've never deployed a server.

275
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Linode's UI strikes that balance. And I think what really matters,

276
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
especially when you're putting your business applications on there,

277
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Linode's got the best support in the business.

278
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Just simply no other cloud provider has architected their business in such a way

279
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
to put so much priority in the customer service.

280
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,000
I mean, I'm talking 365 days a year, 24-7.

281
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
You call Linode with a problem, they're going to help you.

282
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
And they don't do like that game where they escalate you to like three different tiers.

283
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,000
They just help you. And they're always rolling out screaming fast upgrades.

284
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:10,000
I mean, they are their own ISP. So they've frequently got the absolute best connections out there.

285
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,000
But also disk and CPU are just screamers on Linode.

286
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Cloud Spectator did a CPU benchmark report, which I'll have a link in the show notes.

287
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
You can download that for free.

288
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:24,000
They compared the other major and alternative cloud providers like your big duopoly hyperscalers

289
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,000
plus your other kind of alternative hypervisors that want to be like Linode.

290
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,000
You know what I'm talking about. It compared them all.

291
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:35,000
It looked at the latest CPU disk numbers, did benchmarks across all of them,

292
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
and guess who came out on top.

293
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:44,000
The report shows that Linode is by far the best in price, performance, and value.

294
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,000
When you look at performance per dollar, nobody beats Linode.

295
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:52,000
They've got great hardware, and they're 30 to 50 percent cheaper than the hyperscalers

296
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
that want to lock you into their duopoly platform.

297
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,000
So go over and try it. See what I've been talking about.

298
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Maybe take advantage of that S3 object storage.

299
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:05,000
They've got some fantastic scaling tools if you want to integrate Terraform, Ansible, and Kubernetes.

300
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,000
And like I mentioned, the pricing, the network, and the support,

301
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
it all comes together to make something really special.

302
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:15,000
But I think you've got to go see it. I think you've got to try it to really get the difference,

303
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
to really understand why it's better than everybody else,

304
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:21,000
and why I've decided to run everything we run in the cloud on Linode.

305
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,000
So go try it. Go get that $100. Really see it for yourself.

306
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Linode.com slash coder. Go there, get the $100, kick the tires,

307
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,000
see what I've been talking about, and support the show.

308
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Linode.com slash coder.

309
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:42,000
So the topic of work from home has come up, but this time the conversation is starting at 11.

310
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Author and podcaster Malcolm Gladwell thinks that remote work is hurting society.

311
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,000
It's going to create a worse recession,

312
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:56,000
and it's going to create employees who just sit around in their pajamas.

313
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
I got a little bit of this audio.

314
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:02,000
And listen with an open mind because he might be making a valid point.

315
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,000
I came into this all like, oh, what does he know?

316
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:09,000
And then I played this for my wife, and she says, I think he's right.

317
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:13,000
We've noticed this. I've started this little company, this audio company,

318
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:18,000
with my friend Jacob Weisberg called Pushkin, who produces all of our podcasts and others.

319
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:25,000
And we've noticed that the people, like every small company, we have people who come and go.

320
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:33,000
And the people who go are the ones who, this is an obvious observation, but it's an interesting one.

321
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:41,000
The people who have tended to leave are the ones who are the most socially disconnected from the organization.

322
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:46,000
So who came into the office the least, or who were based in another city,

323
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
and we hired them largely to do remote work.

324
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:53,000
It's very hard to feel necessary when you're physically disconnected.

325
00:18:53,000 --> 00:19:01,000
And, you know, as we face the battle that all organizations are facing now and getting people back into the office,

326
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:05,000
that this, people, it's really hard to explain this core psychological truth,

327
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:11,000
which is we want you to have a feeling of belonging and to feel necessary.

328
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,000
And we want you to join our team.

329
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,000
And if you're not here, it's really hard to do that.

330
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
It's not in your best interest to work at home.

331
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
I know it's a hassle to come to the office.

332
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:28,000
But like, you know, if you work, if you're just sitting in your pajamas in your bedroom,

333
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,000
is that the work life you want to live? Right?

334
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Don't you want to feel part of something?

335
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
There's a lot here.

336
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Don't you want to feel a part of something?

337
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Don't you need to feel needed?

338
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,000
There's a battle to get people back into the office.

339
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Is this what you want to do with your job?

340
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
What are your thoughts on Malcolm's take?

341
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Because my wife said that the one thing that she thinks he's getting at here is that

342
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:57,000
when you're working in a hyper creative environment, hyper collaborative environment,

343
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
it does matter if people are in the same space together.

344
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:05,000
But what I find fascinating about Malcolm is he's kind of, or was, sort of famous for being a remote worker.

345
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:10,000
You know, he's written pieces for the Wall Street Journal about sort of the,

346
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:15,000
I don't know, I guess you could call it the tale of the writer who works from a coffee shop.

347
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:19,000
And now he's very, now he's got his own business and he's got a staff.

348
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
He's gone hard the other direction.

349
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,000
And he says people won't feel needed at a company.

350
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,000
They won't feel necessary, is what he said, if they're working remotely.

351
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Yeah. So, you know, I've been on the rollercoaster remote work journey for a couple of years now,

352
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
and I have just totally embraced the Kool-Aid.

353
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:43,000
I kind of feel like the ship has basically sailed.

354
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:47,000
And if you embrace a truly remote first organization.

355
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Now, obviously, if you're like a factory, that's not going to work, right?

356
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
If you're like manufacturing stuff.

357
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:59,000
But I don't think it's going to go back.

358
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:04,000
And I'm pretty sure we're going to see people's, what do they call that?

359
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Revealed preferences, right?

360
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Where they start treating, you know, treating going into the office as a negative downside.

361
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Maybe with the exception of like folks in their twenties and major metro areas who, you know,

362
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:22,000
want to go like party and all kinds of fun stuff.

363
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:29,000
But once you're like have kids and a mortgage or a couple of dogs or whatever,

364
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:35,000
that commute is just two hours or whatever it is for you of nonsense out of your day, right?

365
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Why do it?

366
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:44,000
And also from a small business perspective, people who rent commercial real estate tend to be very litigious.

367
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,000
You know, their whole business model is I get you to sign a piece of paper,

368
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,000
and now you have to pay me regardless of the ultimate value of that piece of paper to you, right?

369
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
It's called a lease.

370
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:59,000
So I don't necessarily think he's right.

371
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Now, I understand that if you are Malcolm Gladwell, who, by the way,

372
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,000
himself has been working remote for years up until very recently.

373
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:14,000
And he used to write articles in the Atlantic and places like that about how awesome it was that he would just like take his laptop

374
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,000
and go to like some cool coffee shop and, you know, work from his couch.

375
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,000
And it was so freeing he could get into flow state.

376
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Yeah, I don't know. It feels very, you know, super rich guy who hangs out with super rich, powerful, you know,

377
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Fortune 500 CEO types happens to mirror their revealed preferences because that's the circle he's in.

378
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Right. And that's how he sees the world.

379
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:45,000
And that is, to me, one of the more fascinating meta stories about this debate is from his standpoint,

380
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:53,000
he feels like this is a quote, I'm really getting very frustrated with the inability of people in positions of leadership

381
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,000
to explain this effectively to their employees, end quote.

382
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,000
That's his perspective. Right. It's a communications problem.

383
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:03,000
We're not communicating to you effectively the benefits of you coming into the office.

384
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:10,000
We just we just need you into the office because we have to have that high level of performance because we need to remain competitive.

385
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:14,000
And you just don't understand. And you're just going to devolve into somebody who stays in their pajamas if you don't do it.

386
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,000
And it's just it's this fascinating two viewpoints.

387
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:22,000
His is a top down viewpoint and the worker has a bottom up viewpoint.

388
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Right. The worker is thinking about the time in the commute.

389
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:31,000
The worker is thinking about how they're they're not getting to spend as much time with their family when they go into the office as they do when they work from home.

390
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:37,000
And the worker is thinking about the cost of the damn gas because the damn gas keeps going up or at least it's way too damn high.

391
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
And those are factors.

392
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:47,000
And then I also think if it's not going to happen this year, it will within, you know, 2023, 2024.

393
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,000
There is a sound environmental argument to be made.

394
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:59,000
I looked at the data during the lockdown and we had a significant reduction in greenhouse gas production in the United States.

395
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:04,000
It was actually visible on satellite cameras like there was less smog.

396
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
It was seriously noticeable.

397
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:12,000
There's data that backs it up that the lockdowns reduced our carbon footprint.

398
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:19,000
So I think you could pretty quickly find a logical argument that working from home is the environmentally friendly thing to do as a business.

399
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:28,000
You one of the things to be a green business is you should have X percentage of your employee base working from home to reduce their carbon footprint.

400
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,000
And it just seems like such an obvious direction this is going to go.

401
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:40,000
I'm shocked that some company hasn't touted their greenness as, you know, as a result of this policy change, which is also going to be giving the employees exactly what they want.

402
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,000
So they'll be making employees happy and be boosting their brand at the same time.

403
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:47,000
So it's a foregone conclusion. It's going to happen. It's just a matter of who figures it out first.

404
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:52,000
However, I would like to just take a moment here and defend the commute.

405
00:24:52,000 --> 00:25:01,000
I think if you get the right commute and I realize not everybody gets to pick this and, you know, I used to live in a place where I had a real smooth drive.

406
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,000
And then as the years went on, it became a horrible place to drive.

407
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:09,000
But now I've, you know, with Lady Jubes, I park in different areas where I can kind of choose my commute.

408
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:16,000
And I have a 22 minute drive. It is 70 miles per hour the entire way each way.

409
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:20,000
And it very rarely has traffic unless there's an accident or something like that.

410
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:32,000
And I find that 22 minutes sometimes is my favorite part of the day because it's this transitionary buffer between maybe a stressful workday and when I get home to see the wife and the kids.

411
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:39,000
And so, you know, whatever I need mentally to get in the state so I don't bring work home to them, I have an opportunity to do that.

412
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Maybe it's a podcast. Maybe it's music. Maybe it's total silence. Right.

413
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Maybe I take the long way. It's a 40 minute drive.

414
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:51,000
And for me, that has been an absolutely essential mental transition time for me.

415
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:56,000
And so I can some days of the week work from home, but I very rarely do it.

416
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:03,000
I do sometimes because of gas, but I much prefer to separate work and home.

417
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,000
And this is somebody who has been doing this for a decade. Right.

418
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:13,000
I've been self-employed for, I mean, even when I was working at Linux Academy, I was actually still working in the studio by myself like I was self-employed.

419
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:18,000
There was no change. I was one day. One day I was working for another company, but I got in the same car.

420
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:22,000
I drove to the same place. I walked through the same door and I sat down at the same desk and I used the same gear.

421
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Right. I had the same stuff in the fridge. It was a really weird thing.

422
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:36,000
So I have worked from home, quote unquote, for a decade, and I still prefer to have a separation between where I live and relax and where I work and focus on work stuff.

423
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,000
And so the drive to me, you know, it's a 22 minute drive. Right.

424
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,000
So it's right in that sweet spot. It's not a big deal.

425
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:46,000
But I think if you can get an arrangement like that, there is something to it.

426
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:50,000
And I I definitely prefer to have people here than always remote.

427
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:54,000
But I don't need to do it all the time. We can do bursts of people being here. Sprints.

428
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Yeah. Well, the other thing to keep in mind, too, is we're saying work from home.

429
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:05,000
But what we really mean is remote work. Right. You don't necessarily have to sit on your couch five days a week.

430
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,000
In fact, I would argue that's not a good idea.

431
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:14,000
I mean, most people move around. I think they have to move around sometimes. I would think maybe it's just me, but I got to move around a little bit.

432
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,000
Yeah. It's funny to see him make this transition, isn't it?

433
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:21,000
I mean, I I like his work, but it feels like he's a pretty smart guy.

434
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:27,000
And yet he's not really kind of seen the dichotomy of his position and the shift now that he's a boss.

435
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:36,000
He's not you know, he sees things differently. Well, you know, it's like it's like any you know, we had a story that we took out about agile and stand ups.

436
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Right. And it's the same thing once you're the manager. And I've experienced this myself.

437
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Once you're the manager, your incentives kind of change.

438
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:52,000
Right. You kind of do want to make sure that people are actually like, you know, on task and sometimes that's hard to do when they're remote.

439
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:56,000
You know, I don't mean to paint it as a panacea that it's the best thing ever.

440
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:14,000
There are real challenges with remote work, but there are particularly I would argue for small companies a lot of benefit to not having the albatross of a lease and in the insanely competitive hiring market, not being limited to a, you know, realistically 20 mile geographic area.

441
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Yeah, that is a huge one is the hiring. That's just that's absolutely a huge one there.

442
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:29,000
Just kind of on this topic before we move on, Google's CEO sent out this really awkward email revenue growth, by the way.

443
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:33,000
So in the context, revenue growth has not been so great for Alphabet.

444
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:38,000
It slowed to 13 percent in the quarter from 62 percent the same time that year earlier.

445
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:43,000
So they're still growing, but it's a difference of a 62 percent growth versus a 13 percent growth.

446
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:55,000
And so they're looking out there, they're seeing what's coming down the horizon. Pachai writes, quote, I wanted to give some additional context following our earning results and ask for your help as well.

447
00:28:55,000 --> 00:29:02,000
He says, quote, it is clear we are facing a challenging macro environment with more uncertainty ahead.

448
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:13,000
All right. He then adds, there are real consequences that our productivity as a whole is not where it needs to be for the headcount we have.

449
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:23,000
He then goes on to ask his employees help to create a, quote, culture that is more mission focused, more focused on our products and more customer focused.

450
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:33,000
We should think about how we can minimize distractions and really raise the bar on both product excellence and productivity.

451
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Is Google using the potentially looming recession to dial back the wokeness?

452
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:44,000
Is that what I'm hearing? Or is he pet projects? How am I supposed to take this?

453
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:56,000
When he says things like we need to have a simplicity sprint to refine our focus and we need to look at what we're focusing at and stay mission focused or else he says we're basically going to have to fire people.

454
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,000
We're going to have to reduce headcount if we don't do this.

455
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:11,000
You know, I don't know. I mean, certainly I've been super critical of some of like the, well, we won't work for the DOD because, you know, we're some sort of weird hippies.

456
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:16,000
But Google, my understanding is Google today is not Google as it used to be.

457
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:20,000
It's extremely bureaucratic. And this is my little pet theory.

458
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:31,000
But whenever you hear someone tell you that their business is run completely by data, that's usually, you know, preferences and interpersonal stuff with like fake math thrown on top of it.

459
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:39,000
And I'm pretty sure that's I mean, look at how many times, how many chat programs has Google bought and released and killed and blah, blah, blah, blah.

460
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
There's a lot of creep there for sure.

461
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:48,000
They're kind of like the 90s Microsoft now, right? They've got like divisions who don't necessarily work well together.

462
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:52,000
I mean, this is this is all rumor and scuttle, but I've been hearing but.

463
00:30:52,000 --> 00:31:01,000
But I get I mean, if the CEO is sending this out, doesn't that kind of indicate that the leadership recognizes something's off, something's not right?

464
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:08,000
Because he says, quote, there are real concerns that our productivity as a whole is not where it needs to be for the headcount we have.

465
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:20,000
And then he says we need to have employees help us create a, quote, culture that is more mission focused and focused on our products, more customer focused and minimizes distractions.

466
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:30,000
And when he says a culture, they want to change the culture, a culture change that feels like they're recognizing systemic issues.

467
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:37,000
A culture issue is pervasive throughout the company. Right. It is literally the culture of the company.

468
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:40,000
It's the it's a little lab dish they're sitting in. It's pervasive throughout it.

469
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:45,000
And I read from this that he recognizes there's an issue.

470
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:52,000
And I would I would wager there's nothing they can do about it. Just it's at their size with their momentum.

471
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:58,000
It's too late. You know, they've. They sort of set their course.

472
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:08,000
I mean, you know, it sounds like the guillotine is coming down for for a whole layer of middle managers.

473
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:13,000
Right. I mean, we all know this at some point.

474
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:17,000
The process is good. You need product products and project managers.

475
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:29,000
But at some point they become so it becomes a self perpetuating cycle, right, like an infinite motion machine of well, the process does not serve the production anymore.

476
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:40,000
Right. You end up serving the process. And when you have lots of middle managers, they're basically the guardians of process.

477
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:45,000
I'm not saying managers are bad. I in many ways am one half and half.

478
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:50,000
Right. But it's but for a lot of them, the only way they can scale their job is by following the process.

479
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:59,000
And so it just becomes a numbers game. Well, then you have a project manager and like a director and then a junior VP and a senior VP and an executive VP.

480
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:06,000
And then, you know, up and up and up and everybody's got their their kind of paper trail that they need filled out.

481
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:13,000
You see this a lot. If you ever have to deal with like local government where it turns out a lot of the time.

482
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:20,000
The reason and this is another issue that process oriented people tend to to overblow.

483
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:26,000
There's all kinds of crazy if you've ever had to get a permit for something, you know, this that makes no sense.

484
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:37,000
Except if you go back like one time in 1982, there was some problem and some city councilman or city councilwoman passed an ordinance because this shall never happen again.

485
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:48,000
Right. But when you have like 50 of those, you know, repairing a sidewalk takes about 200 pages of just like worksheets and verifications.

486
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:52,000
It's it's dumb. And that's that's what happens as companies get bigger.

487
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:56,000
The chief offender in this in our world used to be Microsoft.

488
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:02,000
They were at the point where there was that famous cartoon of the different Microsoft divisions holding pistols at each other,

489
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:09,000
because not only do they have tons of middle management, tons of process, but they had to compete with each other because of their insane stack ranking system,

490
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:12,000
which is every year they would fire 10 percent of the people.

491
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:18,000
And it was data driven, but it was really a popularity contest for the executives.

492
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:22,000
And of course, Google is famous for having the OKR system. So they have their own system.

493
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:27,000
It's kind of like stack ranking. Right. It's it's it's the term stack ranking.

494
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:33,000
You know, the Gen Zers freak out now. So I don't know. I mean, it's a very common problem for for big companies.

495
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:38,000
It's a very, very tough thing for them to fix. Some of them it's inherent to how they are are built.

496
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:52,000
And I would think you might be right. This could be if you were a large publicly traded company that had a significant portion of like all of the ad sales in the entire industry and you were Google and there's lots of stockholders and cetera, et cetera.

497
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:58,000
Right. You don't just announce a massive layoff. Well, that'll screw with your share price.

498
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:05,000
Yeah, right. That spooks the market big time. You layer it. You kind of start with some warnings that, hey, we're doing a hiring slowdown.

499
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:09,000
We see some macro issues. That was two weeks ago, three weeks ago.

500
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:14,000
Now, this week we have this memo that leaked, quote unquote leaked. But come on, he knew it was coming out.

501
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:18,000
That's why he phrased things the way he did. He said you send an email to 50,000 people.

502
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:22,000
It's going to make it to the press. He probably leaked it himself. Right. I mean, I don't know. Yeah.

503
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:26,000
I mean, he may have he may have, you know, why not just go straight from, you know, straight from the source.

504
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:35,000
So then this this memo leaks where they talk about how we need to have a simplicity sprint and we need to refocus and we need to make sure everybody's mission focus.

505
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:40,000
And he talks about the headcount and how he identifies that as a potential issue.

506
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:51,000
You kind of could see like as maybe recession news picks up, if it does and all of that gets worse, Google would just continue this layering strategy where they're kind of preparing the market.

507
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:56,000
So that way the market can price the news in ahead of time and then they'll announce the layoffs if that's going to happen.

508
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
Well, and there's also the dark side of this. Right.

509
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:15,000
I would not be surprised if they do not, at the upper echelons, have a list of all the people who've either, you know, engaged in social activism that has embarrassed the company or definitely the defying them working on giant build multibillion dollar government contract thing.

510
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:19,000
That's you know, those people are going to happen. They're not going to get fired.

511
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:22,000
They're going to get a nice severance package and their position is going to have been eliminated.

512
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:27,000
They will no longer be working on that project anymore. Google's going to spin that down or that feature.

513
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:35,000
Right. Because no employer wants to have to have an employee that is effectively untouchable in the organization.

514
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:41,000
Right. It's does no such animal like that exists.

515
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:58,000
TailScale.com slash coder. Go there to get a free personal account for up to 20 devices and you support the show. TailScale is a zero config VPN. It'll install on any of your devices, any of your OS's in minutes. It'll manage your firewalls. It'll deal with your NAT. It works from anywhere.

516
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:08,000
Devices connect directly to each other using WireGuard's noise protocol. It builds you a flat mesh network using the best VPN security in the business.

517
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:18,000
I mean, you can just quickly and easily create a network between your machine, your mobile devices, your servers, your computers. It has ACL controls. It has sharing controls.

518
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:28,000
I use it on my cloud instances. I use it on my virtual machines. I love it for that kind of stuff. Not to mention friends, machines, families, machines.

519
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:38,000
It's so useful. I've built my own private, flat WireGuard protected Internet. Even when separated by firewalls or subnets, TailScale makes it just work.

520
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:48,000
And TailScale recently introduced TailScale SSH, which allows you to establish an SSH connection between devices in your TailScale network using your access controls.

521
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:55,000
You don't have to manage any SSH keys and the authentication connection is done with WireGuard. How great is that?

522
00:37:55,000 --> 00:38:03,000
And also, I should probably mention TailScale Send, an absolutely fantastic way, kind of like AirDrop for your flat network.

523
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:13,000
You can send machines to all your different TailScale devices. On my GNOME systems, I've got the TailScale status extension and it gives me access to a bunch of quick TailScale functions, my IP addresses.

524
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:17,000
And really every OS, there's a TailScale client that will work for you.

525
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:25,000
Devices will go through your existing identity provider if that's how you want to authenticate them, which means multifactor works. You can deauthorize machines.

526
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:31,000
And the great thing is this flat network is always online. TailScale is really clever about how it does the traffic routing.

527
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:39,000
So you're not sending unnecessary traffic over your TailScale VPN. So I leave all of them on all the time on every OS I have.

528
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:47,000
It's so nice. And it's got a GUI based ACL editor. It's super DNS friendly. It's dead simple to use. I mean, there's a million reasons.

529
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:57,000
But when it all comes together, it's a game changer. There's a real, real like sea ship for me and how I do networking, how I get access to so many different web apps, stuff behind the land.

530
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:03,000
And the best part is I no longer have any open ports on my firewall thanks to TailScale.

531
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:09,000
I love that feeling. So go try it for yourself for free for up to 20 machines and support the show.

532
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:19,000
It's TailScale dot com slash coder. One more time. TailScale dot com slash coder.

533
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:27,000
Let's talk about some Linux workstations. So the last year wasn't a strong year for Lenovo's Linux representation.

534
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:35,000
But I think the year or two before that, they came out with the ThinkPad X1 pre-installed with Fedora.

535
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:40,000
I picked one up. Pretty good little unit overall. As time goes on, I've become fonder of it.

536
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:51,000
But we didn't see a lot last year from Lenovo. And we thought, are they reacting to poor sales and thus pulling back?

537
00:39:51,000 --> 00:40:00,000
They didn't really communicate anything to us until recently. Lenovo's Mark Pearsons at DebConf 2022 in Kosovo actually gave us an update recently.

538
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:07,000
And he says they have 30 plus platforms in the works to be certified to run Linux this year.

539
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:15,000
And one of the things he shed some light on is that last year was just riddled with different problems that slowed down their entire production line.

540
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:21,000
And I think you glean some insights in what it's like for a company to transition from making a Windows machine to a Linux machine.

541
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:28,000
But first, they had OLED panel refresh problems. Then they had Wi-Fi changes, Intel networking driver issues, AMD power issues,

542
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:33,000
NVIDIA driver problems for energy certification, and then, of course, supply chain shortages.

543
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:39,000
So they had really just one thing after another kind of slowed down their entire Linux strategy.

544
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:47,000
But this year, things are looking a little bit better. Plus, they, in that downtime, did make some good connections with hardware OEMs and got things in a better state.

545
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:57,000
But listen to this clip. Not only does it give us insight in one of the major differences in shipping a dev workstation that runs Linux versus Windows,

546
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:02,000
but listen carefully to what he says at the very end of the clip.

547
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:10,000
So there were huge Wi-Fi component shortages last year. So they kept switching the Wi-Fi component on us.

548
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:15,000
And, again, same issue. You're running Linux. It's like, okay, we're switching you from MediaTek Wi-Fi.

549
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:19,000
And so you need your new Wi-Fi driver. And then that has to land upstream.

550
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:24,000
And, okay, we're just back at it. Oh, no. We've run out of MediaTek. We're going to switch you for Realtek.

551
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:28,000
And then we're going to switch you for Qualcomm. So it was relentless.

552
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:36,000
And I will say, one of the things that I think is very reassuring and I think is important for not just Lenovo, this is across the industry,

553
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:42,000
but hardware vendors are doing these drivers. And that's huge, right?

554
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:46,000
We have, I mean, Intel and AMD are kind of a given. They're going to be there.

555
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:52,000
But you have all these other vendors for touchpads and Wi-Fi and networking devices and all that that are doing Linux drivers.

556
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
And they're doing it sooner than ever before.

557
00:41:54,000 --> 00:42:00,000
You used to, before you would have had to wait a solid year or more before drivers started getting there.

558
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:06,000
You maybe had to reverse engineer it. No, all of the vendors are on it because, not just us,

559
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:11,000
but because of the work the vendors are doing, because there is now genuinely a Linux market.

560
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:14,000
And that's from, as a Linux user, from my point of view, that's amazing.

561
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:20,000
Now, he says, there is genuinely a Linux market. And this checks out, in my opinion.

562
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:26,000
You know, you have the dev one. Obviously, you have system 76 that is continuing to really innovate in that market.

563
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:33,000
And you have Lenovo, who's putting significant effort into certifying 36 systems to run Linux.

564
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:40,000
AMD has hired an entirely new Linux. They're just hiring like crazy right now for Linux engineers.

565
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:50,000
In fact, AMD has gone from like hardly contributing to Linux to almost 40% of the changes committed to the previous kernel release 5.19.

566
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:55,000
And they're just constantly adding drivers and refining things, getting power fixed.

567
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:59,000
Because people are using these things as developer workstations.

568
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:05,000
It seems to be like, you know, Dell and Dell, right? Dell led this with the XPS Sputnik.

569
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:14,000
Right? There really does seem to be a growing market here. So you have this customer base that HP is taking note of.

570
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:19,000
Lenovo is taking note of. Dell is taking note of. Basically sustains system 76.

571
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:26,000
So when does the application ecosystem show up? If you've got all this hardware selling, when do we get an application ecosystem?

572
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
What's going on here? What are your thoughts?

573
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
Don't you already kind of have one?

574
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:38,000
Yes, in a way. You know, I'm thinking like, you know, when we said earlier, like I bought, you know, 60 bucks worth of third party indie Mac apps.

575
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
I'm talking like that kind of ecosystem.

576
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:48,000
Native applications where one or, you know, a small developer or business or one developer is creating that application.

577
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:52,000
He or she is living full time off of that. When do we get there?

578
00:43:52,000 --> 00:44:02,000
Because isn't that the next step if we're supposedly seeing all these sales and all of these different hardware OEMs are getting involved because there's customer demand?

579
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:07,000
Then shouldn't we also be seeing people willing to buy applications now if they're willing to buy these nice laptops?

580
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:10,000
Wasn't that the whole Mac theory all along?

581
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:13,000
Well, there's a couple of things going on here.

582
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:17,000
One, it's still not that huge of a percentage market wise.

583
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:23,000
I would argue that buying the Mac in the application market is itself suffering. It's not what it was.

584
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:29,000
Lastly, there is no blessed development platform for desktop Linux.

585
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:35,000
Which a lot of commercial developers, myself included, I know people are going to say, well, you could use Qt.

586
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:39,000
You could use a follow, you know, all the myriad options.

587
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
But that's a that's a thing, right?

588
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
Uniform blessed platform.

589
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:48,000
I think maybe this proves it, actually, right? You can't just be the user base.

590
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:56,000
You also have to have the developer pipeline, the path to monetization, the way to distribute the application, the blessed development platform.

591
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:00,000
You have to have the documentation, the user community.

592
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:04,000
Crap. So it's going to be Electron for the rest of my life then. Cool. All right. That makes sense.

593
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:11,000
Well, so it's going to be fragmented, right? On Ubuntu, you probably are going to have a lot of flutter development.

594
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:20,000
But I'm not even sure because how many people are clamoring to develop, frankly, desktop applications for any OS now that aren't in some way Electron or like web apps?

595
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:23,000
Yeah, that's there's that, too. Right. Oh, my God.

596
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:27,000
You're making me so sad because it's like Linux is finally arriving.

597
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:35,000
We're selling more native Linux first hardware than ever, like nice hardware like the Dev1 and the latest Lemur and hopefully these ThinkPads.

598
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:40,000
And yet the desktop is less relevant than ever, too.

599
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
Except for maybe to the people that are buying these machines.

600
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:47,000
I mean, there might be like admin, like, you know, DB admin tools and dev tools.

601
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:51,000
But the other thing we're seeing is like think about VSCode, right?

602
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:57,000
VSCode shot a lot of the paid for text editor market in the face.

603
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:04,000
Yeah, it did. I mean, I don't know anything, but I get the impression that the Nova text editor,

604
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:11,000
which was supposed to be like the text mate successor brought to us by the good folks at Panic, just hasn't taken off.

605
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:17,000
It's a Mac native, right? And it's written in like pure Mac, very like tied into the OS.

606
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:20,000
Really, if you're an Apple person, you should love it.

607
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:28,000
But it just can't match the one freeness of VSCode and the just ubiquitous plugin ecosystem.

608
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:34,000
So an EVS code is, I would say, the Cadillac of electron apps, right? It's very good.

609
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:37,000
Just wanted to kind of get that sorted. You know, I had that.

610
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
The web is the future. You will all be assimilated.

611
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:47,000
Ask not what your podcast can boost for you, but what you can boost for your podcast.

612
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:56,000
You know, I wanted to mention that one way you could give value back to the show is if you have these nice little if you have a great tight little sound bite that we could use for the boost board.

613
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:59,000
Boost a grand sentiment to me. I'd love to.

614
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:02,000
I'd love to add more variety to the board.

615
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:06,000
Mega Strike three boosted in with a handsome row of ducks.

616
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:09,000
Two thousand two hundred and twenty two sets. I'm a duck.

617
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:12,000
The UK duck loaded with talent.

618
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:15,000
Hey, Chris and Mike, as an aspiring software engineer, I love the show.

619
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:18,000
You've talked in the past about your kids playing Minecraft.

620
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:24,000
Have you heard about the controversy around the one that nineteen dot one moderation update?

621
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:30,000
I see Minecraft as an example of an open source game, and this update makes me worried about the future of the game and the community.

622
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:34,000
I'm curious to hear your takes on the situation. Thanks for all your hard work.

623
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:39,000
So the new feature they're rolling out in the one nineteen one update is player reporting.

624
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:49,000
So if somebody says something bad or harasses you when you're playing in a multiplayer environment, you can report them to Mojang Studios and then Mojang can review it.

625
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:56,000
And if they decide to ban you, they ban you from all Minecraft Minecraft realms everywhere because it's all tied to your Microsoft account.

626
00:47:56,000 --> 00:48:00,000
Now, there's different levels of action that they will take.

627
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:12,000
And it's it's sort of taking it out of the hands of the server admins who run their own Minecraft servers and could ban people individually on a per server basis and putting it at the global level kind of at Microsoft's level.

628
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:25,000
And as you can expect, there has been a massive backlash to this news. I mean, thousands and thousands and thousands of comments on Reddit and other platforms, mostly from people who run their own servers.

629
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:32,000
There's also like some profane servers where like it's the intention is just to be ludicrous off the wall with stuff.

630
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:41,000
And they're worried that those could all get shut down. But as a dad, I'm curious to know what are your thoughts around Minecraft and this player reporting feature and adding banning features like this?

631
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:49,000
So I don't let my kid play super unrestricted. Right. So he's kind of mostly playing locally or whatever. But I don't know.

632
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:58,000
Does everything have to now be a moderated space? Well, they specifically say they wanted to be more inclusive and they want to create safe spaces for people.

633
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:06,000
That's where their goals. Yeah. But what if I want to do a like Linux master race Linux only server and you have to be a Linux user and like it's a private server.

634
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:14,000
I'm hosting it. I can't do that anymore. Well, you could until you got caught. And then you'd be discriminating. Well, it's like I can't rob the bank.

635
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:19,000
Well, sure, you can rob as long as you don't get caught. Yeah. OK. Yeah, I'm torn on this, too.

636
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:27,000
Right. Because I feels like a, you know, all realms wideband. You know, sometimes young kids are silly.

637
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:33,000
They say something. They get too much sugar. They say stupid things online because it's they think it's going to, you know, make their bodies around them laugh or something.

638
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:41,000
You know, so that's a little harsh. Yeah. Teenagers also. Right. But it does seem like there should be some sort of facility to report somebody who is harassing people.

639
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:46,000
But it does also at the same time seem like it should be a server based thing and not necessarily a whole realm thing.

640
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:50,000
Right. But that already existed. You could just ban hammer someone from your server. Yeah.

641
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:54,000
I mean, my solution for my kiddos has always been local servers.

642
00:49:54,000 --> 00:50:06,000
I got, you know, a VPS with a Minecraft server on it and I've got a Raspberry Pi that also has a backup Minecraft server on it and they've got some local worlds and I just don't really want them going on random servers.

643
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:10,000
Do you know what my problem with this is? I didn't even think about I don't even know about it.

644
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:20,000
But what what was OK today or yesterday and it will be OK tomorrow might not be in a year.

645
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:25,000
Yep. That's very true. So and this is a lot of this moderation stuff.

646
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:30,000
It I mean, I'm sure you and I could tell stories about conferences back in the day.

647
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:34,000
Yeah. Oh, for sure. Oh, for sure. Yeah, I know where you're going. Yeah.

648
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:44,000
And it's like, well, I mean, I could tell stories about starting up working in New York and just, you know, lunches and young ladies, waitresses.

649
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:50,000
Right. Like it was just the world was different. I don't know.

650
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:57,000
And, you know, there was a there was a period of time when the ankles were considered like, you know, risque to show, you know, you could have your boobs out there.

651
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:08,000
That was fine. But your ankles, you covered those up. But even taking it away from like, you know, the the ladies, let's let's just say it's, you know, some words.

652
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:16,000
I'll give a perfect example. When you and I were raised of some words you just didn't say, you get smacked or you get a bar of soap in your mouth, probably.

653
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:22,000
Right. Now I hear kids like it's just so much more risque. It's so much more vulgar.

654
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:29,000
And that's OK. Honestly, there was a time where if you were caught dead crying, it would undercut all of your credibility.

655
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:33,000
You know, you would. Boys don't cry. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You don't do that.

656
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:39,000
What are you? Yeah. Things do change. Our standards change and they don't always change in the direction you expect.

657
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:43,000
And they don't always evolve into what might seem more progressive either. Sometimes we regress in some areas.

658
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:46,000
Oh, some. I mean, what is progressive versus what's conservative?

659
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:56,000
I mean, right now, I would say certain things are super more liberal, not in the political sense, but in the sense of like, you know, anything goes.

660
00:51:56,000 --> 00:52:00,000
And but like a lot of the speech stuff has become I would argue incredibly conservative.

661
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:10,000
Sure. Sure. Right. Are we going to ban people from their Microsoft account on Minecraft if they forget somebody's name and that person takes it as an insult?

662
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:17,000
I mean, it's both sides of the coin, too. Right. You have in some ways you have more freedom of speech than you ever have to.

663
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:22,000
They have more censorship as well. You have all kinds of there's just all kinds of dichotomies.

664
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:34,000
Right. Oh, I feel like I see. I don't think you have more freedom of speech. I you know what? It's I would be afraid to like stand up and speak at a conference and try to make the room laugh these days.

665
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:43,000
There's it's so easy to just get, you know, this really weird I mean, have you ever been to our slash Linux?

666
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:52,000
Just I don't know. It's crazy. It's and that's like one extreme, right? There's the extreme edgelord trolls who are just like, I don't know, doing their thing.

667
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:59,000
But then there's I would call them the the PC police, who I think are just a lot scarier.

668
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:04,000
I don't know. So so if if one of our sons or your daughter, well, your daughter's younger, right?

669
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:08,000
She's probably two. Two daughters, one boy. So I got on both. I'm going to have trouble both ways.

670
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:16,000
Oh, it's horrible. It's horrible. Like if my son is just like mouthing off to one of his buddies when he's old enough to play Minecraft online,

671
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:21,000
let's say him and your son are mouthing off to each other and someone overhears it or whatever and reports them.

672
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:24,000
Have they both just lost the ability to play Minecraft for the rest of their life?

673
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:28,000
It depends what somebody at Microsoft who's following a procedure decides.

674
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:31,000
Well, Microsoft has already shown where they fall on these issues, right?

675
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:36,000
They're pretty I would say they're pretty on the woke police side of things.

676
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:40,000
So they're going to err on the side of caution because they're a multinational corporation.

677
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:48,000
Yeah, but you're expecting teenagers effectively. I mean, our kids aren't teenagers yet, but you know where I'm going with this to be like these enlightened,

678
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:52,000
socially progressive people. And I remember being a teenage boy.

679
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:58,000
Yeah. And I'll add this to like for some of these kids, my kids, I feel like they'd be disappointed, but they'd be all right.

680
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:02,000
But for some of these kids, they've invested years in building these worlds.

681
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:09,000
It's their life. And if you were to ban them, it'd be like basically socially banning them.

682
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:12,000
I think it could be very emotionally damaging, as sad as it is to say.

683
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:18,000
But yeah, let us know what you think, because I think this one I could I could kind of land either way.

684
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:24,000
We got another boost in from K.P. with another row of ducks, 2222 sats.

685
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:30,000
He says, I'm upgrading my number boost here. Plus, I say let's get West back on the show sometime.

686
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:36,000
I'd like a little closure love on the show. Yeah, I'll liquor him up sometime and ask him about that.

687
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:41,000
He also says that I wonder if I think we were talking about something being built on Java.

688
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:47,000
He was giving us some feedback on that. But you know what? I think you know what?

689
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:50,000
K.P. might be a West super fan. And who is not a West super fan?

690
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:55,000
He says, here's an idea. Have West have West join the show all the time, he says.

691
00:54:55,000 --> 00:55:01,000
It would be Mike the pragmatist, West the idealist and Chris the referee. I like the idea.

692
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:04,000
The problem is, is that, you know, West Payne is a working developer.

693
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:10,000
He's out there building stuff and doing those mandatory stand ups all the time.

694
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:15,000
Every now and then, West will send me a screen shot or something or give me an idea of like what's his calendar look like.

695
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:19,000
And it's just like there's days he's got so many meetings. I don't know how he's getting anything done.

696
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:24,000
Wait, can we make a Minecraft server where we consider stand ups hate speech and just get people to self account, man?

697
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:29,000
That seems pretty legit. Yeah. Yeah. I like that. Hey, you know what?

698
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:36,000
Let's do a Fauci boost from Red Green Factor who sent it. Yeah. 2048 sats.

699
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:41,000
Boost. This guy has such a great voice, you know, it's very recognizable.

700
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:47,000
All right. Brace yourself. Here's why he uses Vim. And we got a lot of feedback on this.

701
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:52,000
OK, I'm going to go through it. I'm also going to link to just some of it in the show notes

702
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:55,000
that I think is the ones that are worth reading, not to say the other ones aren't.

703
00:55:55,000 --> 00:56:05,000
But some of these like I don't know if you saw Brandon's email, but Brandon Brandon sent us in this beautiful explanation of why he uses Vim.

704
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:12,000
And I totally get it after reading Brandon's email. So I will link to that in the show notes.

705
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:16,000
But I wanted to read this from Red Green. I still use Vim because it supports my workflow the best.

706
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:22,000
Neo Vim supports LSP. And now I get all of the smart completion the V.S. code has inside Vim.

707
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:26,000
I have the power to customize the behavior exactly the way I'd like it to work.

708
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:36,000
That's a recurring theme is people are essentially building their own tools over and over again because Trevdev boosted in with a boost.

709
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:40,000
Boost, he says. The reason why I use Emacs or Vim is because it's more accessible.

710
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:48,000
It doesn't require almost two gigs of RAM. Both Emacs and Vim are free software and tend to fall more in line with free software ideals.

711
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:54,000
That matters to him. Both Emacs and Neo Vim are centered around the minimal core, which he likes, and he builds it up.

712
00:56:54,000 --> 00:57:01,000
He's got extension languages from there. And of course, Emacs uses Elisp and Neo Vim uses Lua, which he likes.

713
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:08,000
This is how passionate he is. He comes in with a double boost to continue for another twenty five hundred.

714
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:12,000
He's like, I got more. He's sending another twenty five hundred stats to tell us this.

715
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:17,000
He says both editors have decades of investment from the communities at large.

716
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:22,000
Emacs in particular has 40 years of community effort to build up the software.

717
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:27,000
There isn't much you can't do with it, as it will do whatever you can tell it to do in Lisp.

718
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:30,000
So if you make it happen in Lisp, you can make it happen in Emacs.

719
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:35,000
Neo Vim, which is extended by Lua, will eventually catch up to Emacs and Parity.

720
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:41,000
Those of us who choose a fully extensible editor do so because we enjoy that experience.

721
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:45,000
Again, can't disagree. If that's what you like, I can totally understand.

722
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:50,000
You got to be like in your zone. And then a third boost to finish it off.

723
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:54,000
Like I tell you, people are passionate about this. Another twenty five hundred stats.

724
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:58,000
Third boost from Trev Dev, which has got to make him probably the top supporter of the week.

725
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:02,000
He says for myself, I use Emacs and it does the following for me.

726
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:09,000
Anything I want out of VSCode for code editing. Aside from LSP, Emacs already did what VSCode could do now.

727
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:14,000
It does Lisp, too. But my agenda is I like to have an organizer and a personal journal,

728
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:19,000
an email client and a news reader, a static site generator with and without Hugo5,

729
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:24,000
IRC and Matrix client, a music player, a shell emulator, a word processor, a PDF viewer.

730
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:29,000
He has all this up. And he has time tracking, an invoice and a calculator.

731
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:33,000
And then one terminal where he's got a ton of this stuff in Emacs. And that sounds pretty powerful.

732
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:40,000
I get it. My buddy Alex from Self Hosted also really did a deep dive on Emacs.

733
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:45,000
He made it sound pretty appealing. He really did. So I'm not switching, but I get it now.

734
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:52,000
You know, the question that we asked was why were people using these today over something like VSCode?

735
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:57,000
I figured part of it would be because it runs in the terminal, which sounds like it's a factor, but it's clearly more than that.

736
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:01,000
OK, I think I might be done talking about text editors. Yeah, we don't want to.

737
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:06,000
I don't want to get canceled by the Emacs GNU people.

738
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:11,000
All right. Wooden5013000Stats. Just about rounding this out here.

739
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:15,000
Why Vim? Because sometimes you just need a text editor, too. That's true.

740
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:19,000
He also likes it for his Docker stacks, editing in Docker config.

741
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:23,000
And sometimes he says an IDE can just get in the way. All right. All right.

742
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:28,000
Here's our last one. Thank frickin goodness. I'm sorry we even asked.

743
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:34,000
We got a boost from OAGuy1. Thank you very much. And here's something for your trouble.

744
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:41,000
2022Sats. Text editing is an art. Vim and Emacs are foundational tools in that art.

745
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:47,000
Learning these tools, especially Vim, gives you a chance to learn and master this art.

746
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:53,000
Think of Vim as a monastery where you learn from the old wise monks.

747
00:59:53,000 --> 01:00:00,000
Some choose to stay in the monastery while others go off to use other tools such as VS Code and JetBrains.

748
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:06,000
Also, on a particular note, Vim opens instantly and is therefore good at incidental editing,

749
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:13,000
such as git commit messages. Even the ones I write in Markdown, I use Vim. There you go.

750
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:20,000
Okay. All right. We've talked about Vim. We got it. Thank you. And Emacs. Equal airtime.

751
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:25,000
Emacs. We got it. And you know what? I actually do mean it. I do actually get it.

752
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:29,000
So I do appreciate the insights. I used to be a Vim user. I use Vim for my git commits,

753
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:35,000
although I didn't think of that as a particular case. But also, next up, tabs and spaces. Go.

754
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:41,000
All right. Okay. Let's do this. Tabs and spaces. Thank you everybody who did boost in.

755
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:46,000
We're doing something to try to keep this segment tighter. I can't remember if we mentioned this last week.

756
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:51,000
2,000 minimum, I thought. Yes. We're doing a 2,000 minimum SAT to get your message read on the show.

757
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:56,000
I read 100% of all of the messages. I send the great ones around to the team too.

758
01:00:56,000 --> 01:01:00,000
And every now and then we may pull a less than 2,000 one up if it's super insightful or something.

759
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,000
But just we're going to try to tighten up the segment a little bit.

760
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:05,000
So we're going to set a 2,000 SAT limit to get your boost read on the show.

761
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:09,000
But you still can absolutely support the show and send a boost in of any amount you want.

762
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:14,000
And it will get read. I can promise you that. And you can try out a new podcasting app to send in a boost.

763
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:18,000
I like Fountain FM. I'll have a link in the show notes which links you to my account.

764
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:23,000
But also any of them at NewPodcastApps.com are great, like Boost CLI and Breeze,

765
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:27,000
which don't require you to change your podcast app at all. Also, thank you to our members.

766
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:31,000
The new Coderly is out. We've been getting great results and reviews on that.

767
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:37,000
So go grab that if you haven't yet. It's in your feed, your ad free feed, or it's also downloadable in your members area.

768
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:42,000
And towards the end of the year, we're going to be working on live feeds for the Coder members

769
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:46,000
and your own bat signal for your own way to get messages in on a dashboard.

770
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:51,000
We haven't sorted out how we're going to do it yet, but those are all projects in the future for our members.

771
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:55,000
It'll be rolling out. So thank you members at CoderQA.co.

772
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:59,000
Now, before we go, though, this is your disclaimer moment right here.

773
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:09,000
There could be some spoilers coming up.

774
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:14,000
Mr. Dominic has completed Strange New Worlds and is damned upset.

775
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:20,000
I have been sitting here with a barely below the surface boiling rage.

776
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:26,000
First of all, the allegedly enlightened federation where you can do whatever you want.

777
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:32,000
You don't have to worry about money and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah is, in fact, extremely racist.

778
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:39,000
And also gets goes from like super welcoming and open to like tyrannical in like five seconds.

779
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:42,000
Yeah, right. It's like it's like we want to have peace with everybody.

780
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:45,000
You don't want to talk to us, blow them out of the sky.

781
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:49,000
Yeah. You did what with your genetics on a different planet that isn't even Earth?

782
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:52,000
Well, we got we got issues with that. So. So, OK.

783
01:02:52,000 --> 01:03:01,000
So the lovely Commander Una, who I she's right up there with President Roslin from Battlestar.

784
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:04,000
And I got to tell you, I think I like Singh, too.

785
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:07,000
You know, I'm a big, big fan of the Strange New Worlds cast.

786
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:11,000
Some confusing feelings on that Captain Angel, but we don't have to go there.

787
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:15,000
You don't remember which one that is, do you, Chris? I don't know.

788
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,000
I think I'm the one who commandeers the ship. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

789
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:25,000
OK, yeah. But Commander Una saves the day, literally gets up, has her cheerios, saves the day for the Federation.

790
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:30,000
Does everything the Federation needs, obediently follows orders.

791
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:33,000
Does she do anything wrong? No.

792
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:39,000
But just because of who or we could say what she is, they simply take her into custody.

793
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:43,000
They simply arrest her because of her genetics.

794
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:47,000
If that's not the plainest version of racism possible. Yeah, you're right.

795
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:51,000
It really I hadn't thought about it. It's pure racism.

796
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:54,000
And I'm sure there's a good reason that was done to her.

797
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:59,000
Right. Or maybe it was done to her without her consent or before she was born.

798
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:05,000
Well, she's she's not technically human. So she's technically she's an Illyrian Illyrian.

799
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:08,000
Right. And I guess Illyrians eff around with the genetics.

800
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:13,000
Maybe they were once humans, but now they're like a fork of the human race or something like that.

801
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:18,000
So what we do is we on site, we throw them in a cell for another culture's traditions.

802
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:21,000
Yeah, apparently you're right. That is outrageous. I hadn't really thought of that.

803
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:30,000
In fact, it's worse. You're right. If she was born that way because of who that is literally like saying, oh, we don't like you because of what you are.

804
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:35,000
Even if she was modified after the fact. You're right. It's technically it's technically her culture.

805
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:39,000
That's that's a weird thing. I I looked at it from a different perspective.

806
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:54,000
I was happy to have it happen because I felt like they so underused her character in that season that I almost felt like they needed to get rid of soon because like every scene that went to Noonien soon could have gone to Una.

807
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:58,000
But they just gave all the scenes to soon because they're trying to develop her character super fast.

808
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:03,000
And I felt like Una was really isn't there a weird spin off coming for her for soon?

809
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:06,000
Oh, I thought I thought I heard something.

810
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:09,000
They did say it like Comic-Con or whatever. Another two Trek series are in the works.

811
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:13,000
Yeah, I think it's her adventures trying to like find whatever she's got.

812
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:16,000
Remember, they do that whole weird scene where they're talking about basically nothing.

813
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:22,000
And she's like, I'm going to go do this. Sorry, Captain. You'll always have a place on the Enterprise. Right.

814
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:28,000
So I felt like finally they're doing something with his character where she's actually going to be part of the show for more than 30 seconds.

815
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:34,000
Like there are I think there's like actually an episode or two in this season where she's just in the background.

816
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:39,000
Like there's an episode where she's just like sitting like in the background sitting on the bridge and she never really does like does anything.

817
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:43,000
Yeah. And so I thought, well, finally they're doing something with her character at least.

818
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:51,000
But what she has her you know, the like buddy cop girl episode where her in soon and and they have they she has a lot of combat scenes though, right?

819
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:56,000
Like she does a lot of. Yeah, but you know, she doesn't do a lot of first officer ring actually.

820
01:05:56,000 --> 01:06:01,000
No, in fact, soon does more of the first offering officer ring than she does.

821
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:04,000
Yeah. Well, you know, the characters are so similar in the way they're written to.

822
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:13,000
It seems it's I have to say, though, it's kind of a good sign that this is your complaint and not, you know, like they, you know, like we were really tearing Discovery apart.

823
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:18,000
I started watching Discovery again. I'm going to get through it, but it's going to be a process.

824
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:25,000
You know, I'm going to say something controversial and I apologize because I don't like to be this guy, but I really don't understand it.

825
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:31,000
I am slogging through the Orville and people people write about the Orville like it's like it's what Star Trek should be.

826
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:38,000
It's people say, you know, like, boy, the writers of Strange New Worlds or Discovery should probably go watch an episode of Orville.

827
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:53,000
I find that the Orville writing is usually kind of basic and almost every episode as the audience, you're almost always ahead of the cast and just waiting for the cast to come to the realization that they need to come to to solve the plot.

828
01:06:53,000 --> 01:07:05,000
And I find that very frustrating because it often like relies on somebody not sharing a secret just because or somebody not doing their job right or somebody being out of character.

829
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:13,000
And I just I just watched an episode of the Orville where it was heart wrenching what they did to the pilot.

830
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:22,000
And he gets trapped back in time and I won't go into too much detail, but like the entire time, I'm just not really connecting with the motivations of the captain or the first officer.

831
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:26,000
I find the effects to be beautiful. I think they might even be better than Strange New Worlds.

832
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:34,000
Almost it feels like it has flavors of the fan versions of Star Trek. I don't know if you've ever seen some of the Star Trek recreations on YouTube.

833
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:43,000
I have not. It just feels a little off. Right. And I don't buy Seth as a captain and he's kind of got a face that I just don't believe.

834
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:54,000
OK, Trump, he didn't he wasn't cast correctly. Basically, he wouldn't be casted if he wasn't Seth Meyers, who created the show and is rich and famous and super important to the studio.

835
01:07:54,000 --> 01:08:00,000
Right. That's why he's the captain. Seth, you can find videos of Seth playing Captain Kirk on YouTube as a young kid.

836
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:11,000
They're pretty adorably dorky. I mean, he's clearly a true Star Trek fan and he's clearly been inspired by the next generation to create the Orville.

837
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:19,000
But I find it it's it's too long. It's doddering. It's sort of basic writing at best.

838
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:28,000
And the characters, none of them feel totally believable. They all feel like actors playing a character to me.

839
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:33,000
And I can't get past any of that. And yet I hear so much praise for it.

840
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:41,000
And I always wonder, like, there's things I come across in life that I think are kind of second rate and sort of a cheap knockoff.

841
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:46,000
But then I'll hear other people praise it like it's so fantastic.

842
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,000
You know, there's a little bit of this with iOS and Android for years.

843
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:54,000
And I always struggle with that because people will make really good points and I'll be like, yeah, I can see why it appeals to you.

844
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,000
I'm glad you enjoy it because I am glad they enjoy it.

845
01:08:56,000 --> 01:09:06,000
So I've only seen like one episode of the Orville. And for me, it was I also don't like it. It was the tone. And then I read the description in whatever it was, Apple, where I bought it.

846
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:12,000
The word dramedy is always like a big red flag for me because the tone, you know, you have to pick one.

847
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:17,000
Like Discovery is like getting lectured on Twitter. Sorry, had to do it.

848
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:20,000
So they've dropped the comedy component in the latest season.

849
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:28,000
I mean, there's a few laughs here and there, but just like one liners. But yeah, I kind of would have liked him seeing them embrace the comedy aspect of it more.

850
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:31,000
But and just go all in on that. But they didn't, which is fine.

851
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:36,000
But they're they're like so they're doing social stories like Trek tries to do.

852
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:40,000
But it's like somebody imitating a Trek version of social commentary.

853
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:43,000
So it's just really bonk bonk on the nose.

854
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:52,000
You know, sometimes you could watch an episode of Trek that's doing social commentary and you could take away the message without even thinking about like the the realities of life.

855
01:09:52,000 --> 01:10:00,000
I don't know, like without doing without doing analogies in your head to current day, like you could take the message in without the bias of a current day filter.

856
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:05,000
And I thought they really like sort of masterfully would would strike that balance in track.

857
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:10,000
Not always, but when they did, they'd really strike the balance where it wasn't bonk bonk on the head.

858
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:15,000
But there is a message there. That is not the case with Orville. It's like smack you upside the head.

859
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:21,000
Well, see, that's my criticism of discovery, that it's such a freaking lecture the whole time.

860
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:31,000
I think I think we're in a period of just. I mean, Star Trek was also always kind of moralizing, even the stuff that's like super cringe worthy from the original series.

861
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:36,000
There was lecturing in that. It's just the values have changed so much that we consider it bad.

862
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:41,000
Like Captain Kirk is supposed to be super honorable. You're supposed to think he's like it's not supposed to be cringe.

863
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:50,000
There is a like in in one of the best episodes of the original series where they're fighting the Romulans and sort of that submarine episode.

864
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:55,000
There's a guy sitting at Chekhov station and he's kind of a Vulcan racist.

865
01:10:55,000 --> 01:11:02,000
And Kirk gives him quite the dressing down and tells him, you know, there's no room for racism on this bridge, you know, and you get rid of that right now.

866
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:06,000
Like they address it head on. And I think today we might interpret that as being lectured at.

867
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:14,000
But, you know, they did it back in the 60s. But it was also sort of like the style like Kirk gives him like a dressing down like you listen up, Mr.

868
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:21,000
And, you know, it's like it's not like Kirk isn't crying and like giving like this close up to the camera where he's like breathing into the lens.

869
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:26,000
It's he snaps at the guy on the bridge. Right. He's not asking for empathy.

870
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:32,000
He's not asking for everybody to understand each other. It's just like your dad yelling at you. Right. Like, I don't care what you think.

871
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:40,000
Just do you behave, Mr. Yeah, you get your act together. And I think you and I have both definitely done that more than once to our kids.

872
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:44,000
Anyways, let us know what you think. I thought I thought overall Stranger Worlds was great.

873
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:53,000
I think it's awesome. You know, I've read the criticism that it's like Star Trek by the numbers, but Discovery is so damn weird.

874
01:11:53,000 --> 01:12:00,000
And the cartoon when I haven't seen yet, but I thought that season finale of Strange New Worlds was very clever.

875
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:06,000
I thought it was awesome. Right. Although I did like more spoilers. I really liked the blue dude. The Andorian dude.

876
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:12,000
Oh, yeah. The engineer. Yeah, I did, too. The Ren Faire episode was super weird. I think they're making room for Scotty.

877
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:20,000
They're going to bring in Scotty. I think so. I mean, they I would imagine if they've got a seven year plan, I bet you they just slowly start incorporating.

878
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:30,000
They already have a seven year plan. No, I mean, if they did right, if they have like if they have a multi year plan, why wouldn't you just like start incorporating the TOS cast?

879
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:34,000
Because like then you get fanfare every time you bring back one of the classics.

880
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:37,000
Well, you got to get it right. Which, by the way, you know, rest in peace.

881
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:47,000
Well, and they brought back they brought back a significant character from TOS in the season finale and they played the voice of a significant character from TOS in the season finale.

882
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:58,000
Yes, they did. So I think, you know, you'll see that and they'll sort of be building up to like Kirk's Enterprise and they'll get a bunch of PR buzz every time they bring one of these characters back and they'll spark a whole debate of it.

883
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:01,000
Are they good enough? Are they like the character? You know, the whole thing.

884
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:05,000
They're going to milk it. It's it's brilliant. It's absolutely brilliant.

885
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:11,000
I don't know how I'm going to I don't know how I'm going to like it as a Trek fan, but, you know, putting my producer hat on chefs kiss.

886
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:25,000
You know what it is? Strange New World is not trying to be the next generation where Discovery is like taking all the the next generation kind of more political progressive, whatever, and just turning it up to 11.

887
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:32,000
Strange New World is trying to be the original series, just like, you know, not get protested against.

888
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:40,000
It's hewing the line. It's recognizable. It's you know, that one episode with the Romulans was beat for beat the episode from the original series.

889
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:46,000
Go ahead. It was great. And they're also they're adding a new visual style that I think is just right. It's better.

890
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:51,000
Yeah, it's it's more in line with the Trek universe. And so that all comes together.

891
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:56,000
And I like all the characters. They all seem like good actors. They all seem like believable people in those roles.

892
01:13:56,000 --> 01:14:03,000
They all seem like, you know, like they really are those people. And they actually seem to have pretty decent chemistry, too, which they don't always manage.

893
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:10,000
I don't necessarily that chemistry feels forced in the Discovery and Discovery. Yeah. Yeah. But anyways. All right.

894
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:17,000
Well, they're all better than Babylon five. So which is just awful with that.

895
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:21,000
Incendiary, is there anywhere you want to send people before we get out of here? Yeah. Go watch Strange New Worlds.
