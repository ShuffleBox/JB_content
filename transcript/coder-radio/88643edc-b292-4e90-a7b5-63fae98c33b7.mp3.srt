00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,680
This is KOTOR Radio, episode 457 for March 14th, 2022.

2
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:20,380
Hello there and welcome into Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show, taking a pragmatic look

3
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:25,520
at the earn and the business, the software development, and the world of technology.

4
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:31,840
My name is Chris and joining me with his launch keyboard ready to go, it's my host, Mr. Dominic.

5
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:32,840
Do you hear that?

6
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:33,840
You hear that, don't you?

7
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:34,840
Oh yeah.

8
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:35,840
I did.

9
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:36,840
I heard it when I was setting up to record.

10
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:37,840
I hit the record button.

11
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:40,240
I forgot to run a limbic upgrade head.

12
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:44,200
I kind of feel like our keyboards have become the third host, you know?

13
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:45,200
Yes.

14
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,200
Are we using the same keyboard?

15
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:47,200
Oh yeah, of course.

16
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,200
Well, which key...

17
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:51,160
I actually forgot which keycaps I have, which switches...

18
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:52,160
I have...

19
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:53,160
I got the...

20
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:54,160
I got the louder ones, I think.

21
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,600
I got the quieter ones, but they're just so damn loud, you know?

22
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:57,600
I think.

23
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,440
I can't remember anymore because of the old man.

24
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:02,440
I think I got the quiet one too, but they're still like, damn.

25
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:03,440
Yeah.

26
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:04,440
Yeah.

27
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:05,440
Hey, we're recording on Pi Day.

28
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:06,440
Happy Pi Day to you.

29
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:09,720
Happy Pi Day to you for all the mathematicians.

30
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:13,600
I got myself a LaCroix to party, getting wild in the studio.

31
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:14,600
We're both hipsters.

32
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:18,440
I have a Spindrift, which is like fancy LaCroix.

33
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:20,480
It's LaCroix if they use real juice.

34
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:21,480
Oh, really?

35
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:22,480
Yes.

36
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:23,480
Oh, yeah, yeah.

37
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:24,480
It's LaCroix juice.

38
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:27,600
It's funny because the name sounds like Spindrift, which makes me think of cheap.

39
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,400
They are not cheap, but they were buy one get one free.

40
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:34,020
I want to let everybody know the national emergency is over.

41
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:35,360
We can stand down.

42
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,720
We did get access to my son's Roblox account.

43
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:38,720
Everybody stand down.

44
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:39,720
We're good.

45
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:40,720
We're good.

46
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:45,960
I mean, it did take a week of emails back and forth by both me and his mother, but we

47
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:46,960
got it back.

48
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:51,120
And it's so obvious after this experiment that these quote unquote metaverse companies

49
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:57,180
are so unprepared for the scale of scams that come to your game when you have an ecosystem

50
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:59,160
that people assign real world value to.

51
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:01,820
Oh, boy, it's bad.

52
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:06,520
Like the guy still on the game that scammed him, the guy that scammed my kid's account

53
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:09,820
still on the game, still scamming other people.

54
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:11,200
You can report him.

55
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,200
Nothing changes.

56
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,200
It's a mess out there.

57
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:19,880
It's the hard, hard streets of the metaverse, but I don't care because you know what?

58
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:20,880
Happy anniversary, darling.

59
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:25,000
Tomorrow, tomorrow is our domain name anniversary.

60
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,600
Oh, yeah.

61
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:28,160
Our domain auto renews.

62
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:34,920
It's March 15th, 2018 is when we actually registered coder dot show.

63
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,440
Oh, 2018.

64
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:37,440
Yep.

65
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:44,080
Now, our first episode of Coder was released in June the 11th of 2012, which works out

66
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,840
to be nine years, nine months and three days ago.

67
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:49,200
For some reason, we didn't do anything with the domain, right?

68
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,840
It was all at Jupiter broadcasting dot com forever.

69
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:52,840
It was all at JB.

70
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:53,840
That's right.

71
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:54,840
Yeah.

72
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:55,840
Which is where a lot of people still get it.

73
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:01,320
But then as the podcast landscape changed over the years, well, he needed its brand to

74
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,320
see the brand.

75
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,320
We got to adapt.

76
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:05,320
You got to pivot.

77
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:07,760
So I actually do have a proposal.

78
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,080
Okay.

79
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:12,760
Coder Radio Studio because pro is too cheap.

80
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:16,600
You know, what about Coder Radio Ultra?

81
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:20,160
Looks like we take two shows and fuse them together like Voltron.

82
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,160
Yes.

83
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:25,280
We've actually had this secret podcast connector all along where you could fuse.

84
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,280
Yeah.

85
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,280
Yeah.

86
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,280
You didn't know.

87
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,280
They didn't know.

88
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,280
It's been, what, 10 years?

89
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,280
You didn't know a damn thing.

90
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,280
You can see it on Twitter.

91
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:35,680
I swear to God, Mike and I were having a Twitter conversation during the Apple event.

92
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:39,480
And I said to Mike, I'm like, well, at least they didn't announce that Mac Studio so far

93
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:44,200
because that would be really hard to resist because I'm literally at the place where I

94
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:46,480
need to replace all of the computers in the studio.

95
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:47,600
They're all falling apart.

96
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,920
And five minutes later, bam.

97
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:50,920
Was it even five minutes?

98
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:52,240
It might've been three minutes.

99
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,240
Yeah.

100
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,240
Boom.

101
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:59,080
Mac Studio with the big old processor and multi-screen support.

102
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:03,200
And we've actually gone to the trouble of putting a legitimate cooling system in this

103
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,200
thing.

104
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,640
Damn it.

105
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:10,840
I know for a fact, I know for an absolute fact that Mac Studio could do the job of all

106
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:17,320
three systems because I can do that on the M1 Mac mini right now.

107
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:22,040
I have done an experiment where I replicated the functionality of three different studio

108
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:29,880
systems in one box and I still had a little bit to spare, but it was just enough of a

109
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:33,400
tight squeeze that I thought, it's not quite there yet.

110
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:39,480
But with this machine, I could honestly take the three PCs that I have that are breaking

111
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:43,560
down and put one Mac Studio on the table that would be silent and do the work of all of

112
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,560
them.

113
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,560
And that is tremendous.

114
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:46,560
I'm not doing it.

115
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,320
I'm not buying one.

116
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:54,800
But if I were a shop that was a Mac-based production house, I'd probably be ordering

117
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,840
at least a couple of these right now.

118
00:04:56,840 --> 00:05:02,680
I continue this journey of falling out of love with my iMac Pro.

119
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,360
Well, it's dead now, man.

120
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,360
Oh, it's dead, Jim.

121
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,360
Yeah, that's it.

122
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:12,800
Yeah, you've got to get yourself a $1,500, $1,700 monitor and this $4,000 Mac Studio

123
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:13,800
now.

124
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:16,280
How did they make it cost more money, son of a bitch?

125
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:17,280
Oh, no.

126
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,280
They're very good.

127
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:19,280
Oh, baby.

128
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:25,040
I'm going to try not to turn this into Apple Radio, but this is exactly the machine I've

129
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:31,280
been wanting for literally, I used to lust after when I was too young and just didn't

130
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,400
have the money.

131
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:36,520
The last one, the one that John Siracusa just replaced, what is that, the G5?

132
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:38,320
Yeah, the Power Mac or whatever.

133
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,320
Yeah, whatever it was.

134
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:43,840
You know, what I feel like is this is the machine that I thought they should make since

135
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,520
they announced the Mac Mini forever ago.

136
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:50,520
The original Mac Mini, it was like, wouldn't it be great to just take the Mac Mini one

137
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:53,800
step further, make it a little more powerful?

138
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:54,800
And they've done that now.

139
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,640
It is a great machine.

140
00:05:56,640 --> 00:06:02,160
I still would love to see a Mac with PCI slots myself and removable storage and upgradable

141
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,160
RAM.

142
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,160
That would be...

143
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,560
I don't know if we're ever going to get that in this new Apple Silicon era, but that to

144
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,240
me would be the perfect studio machine.

145
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,240
Yeah, you are.

146
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,360
You're going to get the Mac Pro.

147
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:13,600
It's going to cost like eight grand, but you're going to get it.

148
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,600
Probably.

149
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,600
Right?

150
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,600
I don't know.

151
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,600
This is...

152
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,680
I mean, we're being a little funny about the pricing.

153
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:27,840
It's honestly like if you are a shop or just, you know, looking at someone who actually

154
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:34,080
makes money on this, $4,000 like this, plus a MacBook Air, if you're a Mac guy, you have

155
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,680
covered all your bases.

156
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:39,920
And you got a five, six year machine probably too, because they're going to be, these machines

157
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:42,400
are going to be on the long tail of the support cycle.

158
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,200
Yeah, it is nice.

159
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:48,240
I actually like having multiple machines because it offers some redundancy.

160
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,800
You know, if the OBS machine were to lock up and crash right now, it wouldn't impact

161
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:54,320
our recording or vice versa.

162
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:58,280
So it's nice to have some, I think, machine isolation of tasks there.

163
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:02,200
And that's where the Mac situation starts getting prohibitively expensive.

164
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:05,960
But I think Apple has completely reversed the situation that I originally complained

165
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,740
about in the show so many years ago.

166
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:10,840
They have completely turned it around from the butterfly keyboard days.

167
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:13,120
It's a great time for Mac users right now.

168
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:17,000
I think the rest of the people outside the Mac ecosystem are watching this thinking,

169
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,840
oh, I know this is going to have ramifications for the rest of us, but I just don't know

170
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,800
how that's going to materialize yet.

171
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:29,720
And if they're at Intel, they are still recovering from the hangover from the night of solo drinking.

172
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:33,600
I don't know if you've noticed, Intel's pivoted to making Bitcoin on their wires.

173
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,600
They're like, we're out.

174
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:37,840
Intel's like, all right, we can't.

175
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:40,400
So can I fry some Applewood smoked bacon?

176
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,600
Oh, I love it when you, oh man.

177
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,600
You know what?

178
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:46,360
I was just telling Wes, I said, Wes, he's not bringing bacon these days and I'm hungry.

179
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,360
Yeah, bring it.

180
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,360
Bring the bacon.

181
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:52,680
Is this just like the lag time between Johnny Ive leaving?

182
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,680
Think about it.

183
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:57,280
They're not like coming out with weird products that nobody expects, I'm sure the M1 Ultra

184
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,560
Magic Fusion thing.

185
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:04,680
It's like they took a room of their actual like pro literally studio customers, which

186
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:08,560
I'll get into a little bit because I'm pretty sure studio is like the new, no, you're an

187
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,080
actual professional, right?

188
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,520
Not just like the more expensive model.

189
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,760
Right, because pro has pretty much lost all meaning.

190
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,800
It's been diluted, right?

191
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:19,000
And they said, what do you need to do your job?

192
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,660
And they just decided to build it, which I know I sound like an idiot, but I don't know.

193
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:24,660
This is great.

194
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:25,660
They fixed the keyboards.

195
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:27,380
They're bringing out hardware that makes sense.

196
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:31,200
The price is high, but it's not like so crazy.

197
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,520
I'll tell you what happened.

198
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:35,520
It's clear as day Tim Cook listens to Koda radio.

199
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:36,700
It's obvious.

200
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:40,820
He heard our rants years ago that the problem with Apple is that it's machines were being

201
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:45,460
built and designed by people who don't know how to use computers and that the Apple executive

202
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:50,040
team was getting old and out of touch and they were directing products that they didn't

203
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:52,680
actually understand how the market was going to use them.

204
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:57,480
And then they created their pro group internally, which is producing a lot of their virtual

205
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:03,080
event videos and commercials and doing all that kind of stuff and also interfacing with

206
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,680
industry professionals.

207
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:08,440
And now they've taken what that pro group recommends as sort of a source of truth.

208
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:11,640
You know, like a lot of companies would hire a new department and have them work on this

209
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:13,760
and then not listen to a damn thing they say.

210
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:17,440
But to Apple's credit, the old out of touch management said we are we're old and out of

211
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:20,920
touch and they defer to this new group now, I believe.

212
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:24,720
And they're building exactly the machines that people that are using these to get work

213
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,200
done want to see.

214
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,200
It's no doubt about it.

215
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:31,960
And holy how impressive is it that they're now sticking that M1 and everything from the

216
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:36,160
frickin iPad frickin air all the way up to the Mac Studio flight?

217
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:41,120
Whoa, man, let's see an x86 chip do that or the fact that your monitor has like an iPhone

218
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:44,600
12 processor or 11 processor in it.

219
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,600
It's crazy.

220
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,600
That that part is crazy.

221
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,920
I just can't even with that.

222
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:48,920
They probably just have them.

223
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:51,600
You know, the monitor has a lot of nice things going for it.

224
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:56,060
The multiple mic array, the like 13 megapixel camera or whatever it is, you know, nicer

225
00:09:56,060 --> 00:10:00,160
camera with center stage, the six speaker array, which I bet knowing Apple's track record

226
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:03,480
with speakers is actually legitimately pretty good.

227
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:07,460
But the fact that it ships with a non height adjustable screen and it by default is very

228
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:08,460
low down.

229
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:11,880
What is their deal with like screwing you on stands all the time?

230
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:12,880
I know.

231
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:17,960
And it's not HDR when Apple sells all of these devices that have HDR screens.

232
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,760
This one is an HDR, which is ridiculous.

233
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:22,120
And it's also it's not a high refresh rate either.

234
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:24,960
I heard a lot of people talking about the high refresh rate thing.

235
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:29,840
And as per our other Twitter conversation earlier today, you don't need it on a Mac.

236
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:33,820
I don't think because Apple has a religious aversion to triple A games.

237
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:38,200
So it makes the UI smoother, scrolling smoother, animation smoother.

238
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:41,000
It makes the system feel just slightly snappier.

239
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,880
That's what I've appreciated about it.

240
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,400
And it's not even really that, though.

241
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:48,500
It's that if you're going to charge me more than a thousand dollars for a twenty seven

242
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:53,640
inch monitor, then it should at least have a feature set of twenty twenty or twenty twenty

243
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:54,640
one.

244
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:55,640
Right.

245
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:56,640
And it doesn't.

246
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,400
It has a feature set of twenty nineteen monitors right now.

247
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:00,200
So they probably started building this thing in twenty nineteen.

248
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,200
Yeah.

249
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:05,800
Which you know what, though, isn't that all of Apple's stuff and except for the processors

250
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:09,080
where it's like it's a very conservative.

251
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:15,240
They took a long time and they really, really don't like Intel for some reason.

252
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,240
Like, I don't.

253
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:19,720
I would imagine, too, that when you see the iMac get upgraded to a higher refresh rate,

254
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:23,400
like they have the laptops now, then you'll see this next iteration of this monitor get

255
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:24,400
the update as well.

256
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:27,960
I'd also wager that they probably will still sell a lot more MacBook Pros, even the expensive

257
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:29,480
ones than they will Max Studios.

258
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,480
Oh, for sure.

259
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,480
Absolutely.

260
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:34,960
There will probably be more people that have that monitor, that new monitor connected to

261
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:35,960
Linux.

262
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:36,960
Yeah.

263
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:37,960
Yeah.

264
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:38,960
And it kind of makes sense because it can be a hub.

265
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,720
It's got it's got USB-C and Thunderbolt ports.

266
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,800
It can provide ninety six watts of power.

267
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:43,800
It's got speakers.

268
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,000
It's got a webcam.

269
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,920
It kind of works as a bit of a low key Thunderbolt hub.

270
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:48,920
Yeah.

271
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:49,920
All right.

272
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:53,940
Well, let's talk a little about Linux because Ethan wrote in to kill just absolutely eviscerate

273
00:11:53,940 --> 00:12:01,360
my Proton runtime dream to make a general compatibility layer to just lift and drop

274
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:07,760
Windows applications on Linux for two reasons, primarily to help stop the slow bleed to electron

275
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:13,100
and to help create a competitive moat against Mac apps, just because I feel like Linux has

276
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:16,280
to do something, even though I don't know if it's really going to do anything.

277
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:22,400
But Ethan points out that when you start using wine applications, the accessibility story

278
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,340
drops off a cliff.

279
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:29,840
It can be a hot mess with Windows apps under wine for various reasons, in part also because

280
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:33,000
sometimes the situation just sucks on Windows proper.

281
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:37,320
And then you bring it under wine where you've got the desktop environment, you've got wine,

282
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:40,100
you've got maybe the application developers try to implement some accessibility and they're

283
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:41,100
all fighting each other.

284
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:42,760
It's just a hot mess.

285
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:47,000
And so accessibility goes to die with wine apps on Linux.

286
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:52,400
I just can't get behind a platform that cuts out a whole section of users like that.

287
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:56,440
So I'm back on the native apps bandwagon, baby.

288
00:12:56,440 --> 00:13:03,160
Yeah, I mean, accessibility is tough, right?

289
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:06,880
That's a tough one because that is already so bad.

290
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:09,560
You don't want to make a decision that's going to make that worse.

291
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:13,040
Like, we just can't afford to go backwards on that one.

292
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,600
So that is what it is.

293
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:18,080
But I wanted to get philosophical with you right here because remember to remember hit

294
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:19,080
me up on Twitter.

295
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:24,660
He says at Chris Lass, you sounded afraid to use the term lifestyle business last episode.

296
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:26,560
Why let this be a bad word?

297
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:29,120
I maintain that these are just businesses.

298
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:33,840
It's hyperscalers struggling to pay back huge returns on VCs that are the problem.

299
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:37,120
They're the ones that are doing something weird.

300
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:40,420
Does scale really deliver value to customers?

301
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:41,520
What a great question.

302
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:43,240
And so I'm curious to know what you think.

303
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,480
Two questions.

304
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,440
Is lifestyle business a dirty word?

305
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:50,640
Like would you be embarrassed to use that around business colleagues?

306
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:55,520
And number two, if you're at a massive scale like a Microsoft or an Apple, does that have

307
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:58,560
some sort of inherent value for customers that a small business doesn't?

308
00:13:58,560 --> 00:13:59,560
Okay.

309
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:00,560
What do we think a lifestyle business is?

310
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:06,440
Why don't we start there because I can tell you what it really is in practical terms.

311
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:12,520
My thought when I said lifestyle business would be something that you set up and build

312
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:14,520
a business that you set up and build.

313
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:18,680
It makes enough revenue that you can live comfortably and take care of your family.

314
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:20,560
But you're not going to become a billionaire.

315
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:23,320
You're not going to do large acquisitions and mergers.

316
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,960
You're probably never going to hire 100 people, right?

317
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:29,720
You're just going to kind of stay focused, run your business, keep your friends and family

318
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:33,000
paid, and serve your customers.

319
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,920
I guess I would go with that.

320
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:39,760
Part of the implication of lifestyle business is that you're actually making money, right?

321
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:43,600
So to me, there's nothing wrong with the term.

322
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:48,320
I might be concerned with more openly using it in sales conversations.

323
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:52,720
Yeah, doesn't it feel like shorthand for lazy in some circles?

324
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:58,200
I feel like it feels shorthand for maybe you're not super serious.

325
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:02,860
But again, I don't feel that way, but I do have a visceral reaction that potential customers

326
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:03,860
would.

327
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:04,860
Right.

328
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:05,860
Yeah.

329
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:10,280
Like you're not really going to be up all night working late to solve my problems kind

330
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:11,280
of vibe.

331
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:12,280
It's weird.

332
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:15,120
I also have a bunch of weird hangups that I don't think make sense, but I still have

333
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:19,280
them from, you know, I've just been doing this a long time.

334
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:20,280
Like this kind of thing, you think?

335
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:21,280
Or what do you mean?

336
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:23,880
I hate the word apps when I'm talking to potential customers.

337
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:27,200
I won't use it or I duck, duck, duck.

338
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:31,880
I tend to say just software or app, you know, I'll say application weirdly enough for the

339
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:37,760
system or programs because I feel that when people think apps, they think they can just

340
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:40,200
like go to Upwork and get it, you know what I mean?

341
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,440
Buy a template and have somebody do it real quick.

342
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:44,120
Even the word implies small, right?

343
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:46,400
You're shortening the word application.

344
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:49,240
Except for a few of my most like technically savvy customers.

345
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:53,840
I tend to even avoid other than, oh, by the way, we're going to use this open source thing

346
00:15:53,840 --> 00:16:00,640
really talking about like what we're doing in terms of like, you know, I'm trying less

347
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:04,680
and less to sell like development service.

348
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:06,520
It's more like this is the solution.

349
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:10,680
We're going to use software development as a way to solve your problem, but don't worry

350
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:11,680
about it.

351
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:15,600
You're not kind of a differentiation thing where you're not just going on Upwork and

352
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,520
looking for a Python dev, right?

353
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:23,840
You're we're giving you a complete system, build it, maintain it, and yeah, it's been

354
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:24,840
working out better.

355
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:25,840
You know what this might be?

356
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:29,640
This might be a little bit of like hangover from the app store gold rush in the subsequent

357
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:36,160
fall because I definitely did for a while take a hit on a lot of like the Upwork, the

358
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:39,780
offshoring where people are just like buy my app template and for a thousand dollars

359
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:44,800
will skin it for your, you know, you're a little, whatever your need, whatever your

360
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:45,800
needs, right?

361
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:46,800
Your restaurant, your bar here, whatever.

362
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:50,320
Is that making any sense or am I way too deep into the?

363
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,000
No, I feel the same way.

364
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,280
I think in part it is like the legacy of watching the software business startup.

365
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:59,840
I used to really resist calling our podcast podcast.

366
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:01,440
I wouldn't use the word podcast on air.

367
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,440
I wouldn't use it anywhere.

368
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:03,440
I used to do that too.

369
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,440
I used to call it radio internet radio.

370
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,200
Yeah, it's a show.

371
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:09,080
It's the Koda radio show, not the Koda radio podcast, right?

372
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:13,040
At least that's how we used to talk about it, but it's because it felt like it didn't

373
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:17,800
do justice to the amount of work and effort it goes into to actually produce the content.

374
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:25,120
Just like apps feel like they kind of undercut how much damn work it takes to build an application

375
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:26,120
these days.

376
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:30,080
Even, you know, even now, like, well, the irony building an actual app, like a good

377
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:34,000
item and I emphasis on good iPhone app, right?

378
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,040
Is much more work than it was in let's say 20, you know, 20s.

379
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:39,040
For sure.

380
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:40,040
Yeah.

381
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:43,520
I think when I see eye to eye on the lifestyle business thing, it's just like, it's always

382
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:49,560
felt like I'm admitting that I don't have these huge ambitions to take over the podcast

383
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:50,560
universe.

384
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:53,320
I just want to do my thing.

385
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:57,560
And so I felt, I felt embarrassed about that, especially when I'm, you know, at any kind

386
00:17:57,560 --> 00:18:01,800
of business function, it just feels embarrassing to admit it, but it's a good question.

387
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:02,800
It is a good question.

388
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:07,560
And if, Hey, if that floats your boat, if you like it, I think that's a, that's fine.

389
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:10,960
I also wonder too, and see, now I'm thinking I'm getting a vision of a lifestyle business

390
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:16,240
is like a dude with an M one Mac book pro who does, who like, honestly, he's like in

391
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:21,880
an RV going around writing iOS like you, but hipster, like Apple hipster and he's got a

392
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:23,920
flannel shirt and a beard, right?

393
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:24,920
Right.

394
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:25,920
Right.

395
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:29,080
He only drinks craft beer and you put a Bud Light in front of him, he just throws it

396
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:30,080
at you.

397
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,080
So far, all this sounded actually pretty good.

398
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:32,080
Actually.

399
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,080
Yeah.

400
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:34,080
I don't know.

401
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:40,040
Yeah, I mean, I think there is that element of a hashtag van life and lifestyle, but there's,

402
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:43,760
that's probably what it is, is that when I think of a lifestyle business, I think of

403
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:48,760
my grandpa who ran advertising for the, Oh wow.

404
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:50,800
He ran it for the local RV scene, which is funny.

405
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:53,760
I never really put that, made that connection, but he ran, it's in your blood.

406
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:54,760
It's in your blood.

407
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:55,760
Wow.

408
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:59,860
He did ads for the RV industry in Washington state, the whole bunch of them.

409
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:00,860
And that was his fault.

410
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:02,440
That was the industry he focused on.

411
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:06,600
That was his niche and, uh, it was his lifestyle business.

412
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:10,360
And he, I think he was a one-man, I think he was just back then and probably, probably

413
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:12,200
wasn't so hard, but he was just a one-man show.

414
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:15,440
I can't even imagine soloing a big iOS app today.

415
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:16,440
I'm sorry.

416
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:17,440
I'm like, yeah.

417
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:20,800
And then like, or imagine a, yeah, it just, yeah, you gotta have accounting.

418
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:23,240
You gotta have legal, you gotta have all this stuff.

419
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:26,300
It's designers, developers.

420
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:27,300
It's pretty crazy.

421
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:28,300
Yeah.

422
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:29,300
Well, thank you to remember to remember for sending that in.

423
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:31,300
He hit me up on Twitter at Chris Ellis.

424
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:32,440
You can always hit us up there too.

425
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:35,960
The podcast is at Koda radio show on the Twitter.

426
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:38,400
And we also have a new way you can get feedback into the show.

427
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,300
You may have noticed some are already doing it.

428
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:50,000
You can send us a boost new podcast app.com that's with an S new podcast apps.com.

429
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,400
And you can go there and find one that supports boost and then you can send us in a little

430
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,080
message and support the show.

431
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:56,700
I won't go into my whole rant.

432
00:19:56,700 --> 00:20:00,600
I've talked before about how podcasting is changing.

433
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,760
I've even said three to five years is my time estimation.

434
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:05,240
I actually think it's probably one to two years.

435
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:09,400
And I think these boost messages are going to play a role in wherever this is going.

436
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:12,760
And I think it also has the same dynamics to support software development.

437
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:16,640
And if you don't know what I'm talking about, go try it and you'll see what I mean.

438
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:20,880
It's at new podcast apps.com and then you can filter for ones that support boosts and

439
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:24,200
I'll have a link in the show notes for that.

440
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:28,480
Also just a reminder, we have our East coast meetup coming up.

441
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:35,840
Jupiter broadcasting is going to be in Raleigh, North Carolina on April 9th, 2022 at 3 p.m.

442
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:36,840
Eastern.

443
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:41,120
We'll be right next to Prime BBQ and then on the other side there's a brewery.

444
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:43,600
We now have 50 people on the meetup page, Mike.

445
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:46,120
And I think it's going to be probably even more than that.

446
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:49,200
It's going to be a do not miss East Coast event.

447
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,960
I will actually be there.

448
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:53,000
Yeah, that's going to be exciting.

449
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Wes is planning to go.

450
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Brent's planning to go.

451
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,720
Alex is planning to go from self-hosted.

452
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,200
I'm going to be there.

453
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:00,960
We're talking more and more people into it all the time.

454
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,600
Details at meetup.com slash Jupiter broadcasting.

455
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:09,600
We don't get out there too often, so we would love to see you.

456
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,280
Linode.com slash coder.

457
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:15,960
Go there to get $100 in 60 day credit on a new account and you go there to support the

458
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:16,960
show.

459
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:17,960
You got to go try out Linode.

460
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:21,620
You know, I've been talking about Linode for a little while and that's no accident.

461
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:26,940
It's because Coder radio listeners keep signing up and becoming customers and that's because

462
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:33,200
it's a great value to performance and really design API documentation support, like, etc,

463
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,200
etc.

464
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:37,280
But for me, it's really about the performance and the value because I got a small business

465
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:40,080
to run and it's been resonating with Coder radio listeners.

466
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:45,160
If you need a site for five or if you need a site for five million, Linode has the infrastructure

467
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:46,560
that can handle this.

468
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:48,640
They've been radically speeding up their infrastructure.

469
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:52,460
Every opportunity they get, MVME, PCIe storage, yeah, they got that 40 gigabit connections

470
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:53,460
coming to the hypervisor.

471
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:54,600
Yeah, they got that.

472
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:58,080
They are their own ISP with 11 data centers around the world.

473
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:03,040
And man, I am so grateful that their interface is so much better than the hyperscalers that

474
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:06,400
want to lock you into their craptastic platforms.

475
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:10,600
And then of course, Linode has support they can't even touch, they can't even touch it.

476
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:14,620
I think that's another reason why Coder radio listeners have been sticking with Linode.

477
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:18,680
They've been really happy with when they get in a jam, they got that customer support.

478
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:22,280
Linode's got that customer support and with 11 data centers around the world, you can

479
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:27,000
choose from, you're going to find something near you or near your customers.

480
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:31,840
And since Linode's been doing this for 19 years, they've worked the kinks out.

481
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,580
They've got this figured out.

482
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:38,400
So things like their object storage, cloud firewalls, all that kind of stuff.

483
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:41,120
It just hums and works exactly like you'd expect.

484
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:44,100
They have sensible alerting for when you have a problem with your system, maybe you got

485
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:47,580
excessive bandwidth going on, maybe your CPU is going crazy.

486
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:50,080
Those can always be signs that something's amok.

487
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:53,080
And they've built some really sensible dashboard alerts and stuff like that that you can get

488
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:54,080
going too.

489
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:57,600
And they make it crazy easy to do backups, deploy applications with a single click.

490
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:00,200
I could literally go on and on for the entire episode.

491
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:02,040
So you better just go try it for yourself.

492
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:10,180
Get that $100, kick the tires and support the show at linode.com slash coder.

493
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:15,600
So Google, Microsoft, Apple, and of course a lot of others in the industry have all told

494
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:20,800
their employees it is time to return to the office in either April or May, depending on

495
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:23,080
which company you're looking at.

496
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:26,700
Google told their workers that most of them should at least plan to return for three days

497
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:28,400
a week, if not more.

498
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:34,800
And they promised to study hybrid work further and collect data along the way.

499
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:39,160
Microsoft has told all of their Washington state employees time to come back to the office

500
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:41,400
effective February 28th.

501
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:47,240
Employees have 30 days to adjust their routines and adopt the new working preferences that

502
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:49,120
they've agreed upon with their manager.

503
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:53,000
They also have committed to, even though we're asking for the bulk of you to come back, we're

504
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,960
going to study hybrid work.

505
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:59,760
And of course, Tim Cook over at Apple told employees they will begin to return to the

506
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:06,160
office in Cupertino on April 11th with the completion by May 23rd.

507
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:09,840
And he said, quote, while many of you have been coming in regularly for quite some time

508
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:14,360
now, we are now looking forward to welcoming those of you who have shifted to working remotely

509
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:16,480
back to our corporate offices.

510
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:21,960
And then later he says, quote, we'll begin the phased approach to a hybrid pilot.

511
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:26,460
They literally built a spaceship and called it their office.

512
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:29,280
And now this is very culty.

513
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:30,440
Great computer stuff.

514
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:33,520
You know, each one of these companies is like, no, no, no, let's try to bring as much of

515
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:34,520
you back.

516
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:37,200
But we promise we're going to study this hybrid work thing.

517
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,520
And there's different degrees here.

518
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:42,600
Like, it looks like Microsoft and Google are going to allow for, you know, some work from

519
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:45,620
home, some not, depending on their job.

520
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:47,280
But it cracked the door.

521
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:51,520
This whole two, two and a half years of a horrible pandemic cracked the door to remote

522
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:54,360
work over the internet more than I expected.

523
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:56,080
And I don't even like the term work from home.

524
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:58,960
I think it's just work over the internet.

525
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:05,520
But if the absolute gorillas in this industry, the industry titans, the ones who set the

526
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:11,960
tone, the ones who lead everyone else, if they're not really making this adjustment

527
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:17,400
and making this investment, which they are the best position to make these investments,

528
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:22,320
then did corporate America learn anything from this?

529
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:23,880
Is it at least a little better?

530
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:26,420
And is that enough in your opinion?

531
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:27,700
Maybe it's a good thing.

532
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:30,840
All three of these companies are being very wishy washy, right?

533
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:34,560
I mean, they're clear on what they want, but they're, it's been two years.

534
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:37,720
One assumes they were doing like performance metrics the whole time.

535
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:38,720
Exactly.

536
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:39,720
Thank you.

537
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:40,720
Right.

538
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:41,720
We're going to now study it.

539
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:42,720
What has the last two years been?

540
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:47,080
I feel like what happened is, I don't know, I say I have conflicting feelings, right?

541
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:52,460
Evil Mike, you know, Mike, after some Hendrix would say something like it's because they

542
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:57,360
spent a crap ton of money on offices and yeah, especially for like a Google, right?

543
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:01,520
Where it's, you know, the still one of the best lunches I've ever had was at Google in

544
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:02,520
New York.

545
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:03,520
Just incredible.

546
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:08,360
And I don't know how everybody there is not 400 pounds, but it's just like, you know,

547
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:10,480
they've made big investments.

548
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:16,080
On the other hand, I have a sinking feeling that they're, you know, obviously very smart

549
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:20,240
people and they all love them some analytics.

550
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:21,720
There's probably a reason.

551
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:28,840
What if it is just as stupid as corporate America has invested billions of dollars into

552
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:34,040
these buildings and facilities and if all of a sudden their staff stopped using them

553
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:40,160
and this happens at a scale across the entire industry, does the value of these buildings

554
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:41,320
begin to drop?

555
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:44,100
Does the value of their investments begin to drop?

556
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:45,100
Is that a thing?

557
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:50,520
If all of a sudden office real estate is no longer in demand, if there is an excessive

558
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:53,640
supply of inventory of office real estate?

559
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:59,760
You know, it's funny throughout this, I have looked at commercial real estate to just do

560
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:04,800
some server hosting and some kind of a assembly stuff that's not really conducive to do in

561
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:06,420
my house.

562
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:09,040
And those prices have not gone down.

563
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:15,800
I also feel like corporate real estate prices haven't quite ballooned like retail prices

564
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:20,880
because we were looking at possibly selling at one point and relocating and, you know,

565
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:24,720
just going by what we know the prices are of houses in the area that we were looking

566
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:25,720
at buildings.

567
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:28,760
The corporate building stuff, the corporate real estate stuff was still cheaper.

568
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:33,800
It's all very expensive now, but it was still cheaper than like similar size building that

569
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:34,800
would be retail.

570
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:36,120
When you say retail, you mean a house?

571
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:37,120
You mean like a...

572
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:38,120
Yeah.

573
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:40,320
Consumers like a house or apartment building.

574
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:44,160
I wonder, that makes sense to me because I feel like people who are working from home,

575
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:46,640
all of a sudden it's like, damn, I wish I had another room.

576
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:49,320
It's their office and their, yeah, yeah.

577
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:51,160
I don't know if that's really it, but you have to...

578
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:55,080
There's also the, you know, butts in seats is how I manage my people mentality and all

579
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:56,080
of that.

580
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:58,960
And I think a lot of these businesses went into like, especially Apple, right?

581
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:01,440
They went into remote work, kind of kicking and screaming.

582
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:02,800
They had their hands forced.

583
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:04,240
So it kind of makes sense.

584
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:07,680
You could kind of see it like for certain things like Apple design, like, I don't know,

585
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:08,680
there's some stuff I'm...

586
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:13,480
I've been doing remote work for a long time and I'm kind of, one, I'm happy to see big

587
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:17,680
companies go back to the office so that once again, working from home can be a competitive

588
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:19,040
hiring advantage for me.

589
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:20,040
Absolutely.

590
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:25,560
I mean, if I had my brothers, I probably would have been more resistant to it.

591
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:27,960
I mean, no doubt about it.

592
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:34,080
There are certain kinds of work, even for what we do, that are just done better in person.

593
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:37,560
There's some content we're planning right now for Linux Unplugged that we're planning...

594
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:42,120
We're not planning to do until Brent and Wes are both here in studio for it.

595
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:43,640
It's just no way around it.

596
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:46,480
And so there's some stuff, some projects we wait on.

597
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:47,480
So I get it.

598
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:48,480
I do get it.

599
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:51,280
But, you know, where I worked before was Linux Academy.

600
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:57,200
They had a really good approach where it was remote work with an office that anyone was

601
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:02,880
always allowed to come visit and there was always workspace available for people that

602
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:06,080
wanted to come and work out of the office.

603
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:09,720
And then at least twice a year, they probably would have gone to more, but at least twice

604
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:14,000
a year, they did company events where they paid to fly everybody in and put them up in

605
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,000
a hotel.

606
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:18,880
And that sounds horribly expensive until you think about the fact that they didn't have

607
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:23,480
to have two or three offices staffed all the time and all the costs that associated with

608
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:26,120
maintaining those buildings and workspaces.

609
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:31,940
So they would essentially still end up on top and still have money left to hold these

610
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:32,940
get togethers.

611
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:36,760
And that was such a nice way to kind of tie that together with a team sprint.

612
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:40,900
So if you knew you had these times together two or three times a year, you could also

613
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:45,100
do some sprints in that time, and so a team would come in a week earlier and get together

614
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:48,280
and kick ass on something before the big company meetup.

615
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:50,080
It worked pretty well.

616
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:52,000
Can I throw a Zuckerball at you?

617
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,660
Yeah, I love Zuckerballs.

618
00:29:53,660 --> 00:30:02,240
I had a little fantasy of building a TMB office, like truly tripped the f**k out, like straight

619
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,240
up.

620
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:06,240
I would just mainline some Lewis Carroll and go for it.

621
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:09,320
Do a little crib, MTV crib video if you ever set that place up.

622
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:10,320
I'd love to see it.

623
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:11,320
Right.

624
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:12,320
In the metaverse.

625
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:14,960
Seriously, like a private metaverse office.

626
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:16,960
Well, that's where this is going, man.

627
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:17,960
I'd have a J.B. studio.

628
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:19,160
I've said it before.

629
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:23,820
If I had a studio you guys could come hang out at, you know, so you just pop on your,

630
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:27,020
you know, your metaverse wear and you show up and, you know, there's Wes and I hanging

631
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:28,020
out in the studio.

632
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:29,020
That would be awesome, right?

633
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:30,880
I'm thinking about our North Carolina thing.

634
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,560
A lot of people aren't going to want to travel, right?

635
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:34,440
It's just the reality of life right now.

636
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:39,640
And in general, even without the COVID, right, it's far, it costs money.

637
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:44,760
What if we did, like, I hate the term, but metaverse events, meetups, metaverse meetups,

638
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:45,760
right?

639
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:46,760
Right.

640
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:50,340
And we just hang out and it sounds crazy, but I remember when we first started talking

641
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:55,880
about remote work when I remember I was a lot more kicking and screaming about it.

642
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:59,920
And it just, you just have to kind of adapt and it does work.

643
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:04,320
I mean, all hail Slack as it continues to monopolize my notifications.

644
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:05,320
Right.

645
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:10,560
Hey, did you see your buddy Michele DeCasa is leaving Microsoft, the former, uh, Xamarin?

646
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:11,560
I did.

647
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:13,200
Or is it Xamarian?

648
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,200
It's Xamarin.

649
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:15,200
It's not Xamarian.

650
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,200
I promise you.

651
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:17,200
Are you sure?

652
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,200
110%.

653
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:19,200
Okay.

654
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,200
All right.

655
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:22,920
I'm surprised it took this long.

656
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:23,920
Yeah.

657
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:25,500
They joined in 2016.

658
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:27,480
He's a true startup foundry kind of guy.

659
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:28,560
He's not, uh.

660
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:33,840
Do you think it's a coincidence that Nat just left about a year ago when me Nat joined with

661
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:34,840
Miguel?

662
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:35,840
Yeah.

663
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:36,840
Nat took over GitHub.

664
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:38,680
And then we saw that whole transition happen.

665
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:42,800
And then here we are just about a year later, not even quite.

666
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:48,160
And Miguel stepping down, says he's going to spend the time with his kids, you know,

667
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:49,640
spend time with family kind of thing.

668
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:50,640
Yeah.

669
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:52,440
Well, he said through the summer, he was very specific.

670
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:53,440
Yeah.

671
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:57,360
He says he does want to get back to work and he's about 99% sure it's going to be a startup

672
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:58,360
scene that he gets into.

673
00:31:58,360 --> 00:31:59,360
Right.

674
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:02,520
I mean, I feel like Miguel is, I mean, you know, he's a pretty straightforward dude.

675
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:04,440
I'm sure he is going to like any, right.

676
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:08,360
He's a, like you and I would, if we, you know, could, we would just take a month and hang

677
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:13,720
out with our kids, but you know, he's going to be taking VC meetings too, right?

678
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:15,840
This is, it's a, things take time.

679
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:18,020
This is totally what this tweet thread's even about, right?

680
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:21,680
This tweet thread's about, I'm on the market again.

681
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:26,680
I would like to start, you know, let's call it Miguel Inc. and whatever, right?

682
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:27,680
Who would like to fund me?

683
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:28,680
I mean, which is fine.

684
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:34,040
I mean, you used, you asked if it's a, if I think it's a coincidence, no, but I don't

685
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:35,680
think there's anything evil here.

686
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:37,280
These are two guys who are founders right now.

687
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:42,560
Freedom very famously was like, let's put a rails GUI on top of get, I know it's not

688
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:46,440
just a GUI, but you know, and he was like hanging out with his buddies in a pizzeria

689
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:47,440
and did it.

690
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:48,440
These guys are founders.

691
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:49,440
They're true.

692
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:50,440
Yeah.

693
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:55,600
I think Miguel speaks positively of his experience at Microsoft in the thread and he makes it

694
00:32:55,600 --> 00:33:00,040
basically sound like if I wanted to stay with a big company, I would've just stayed at Microsoft.

695
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:05,160
And so I think life was good enough that he wasn't under any immediate pressure to leave.

696
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:09,560
And there's always the nicety of the public appearance that when Nat stepped down that,

697
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:13,340
you know, maybe Miguel gave it some time to air and didn't want to jump in right behind

698
00:33:13,340 --> 00:33:15,520
Nat and make people really start talking.

699
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:19,200
And since life wasn't so bad, why not wait a year, right?

700
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:24,040
I watch with interest what he does next because Miguel has been a character that we have followed

701
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:31,080
throughout the history of the GNOME desktop, Xamarin, Red Carpet, and Mono, and now Microsoft.

702
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:34,800
And it's just been a fascinating journey to watch this guy go.

703
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:38,920
And I hope he ends up in a start of this in the open source space again, because I feel

704
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:42,880
like that's where his talents have been really, really beneficial for the whole industry,

705
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:43,880
right?

706
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:47,180
And if he goes to some company that's probably working on something cool, but it's all behind

707
00:33:47,180 --> 00:33:49,960
a closed wall, like I feel like the rest of the industry is not going to benefit from

708
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:51,540
that guy as much, but we'll see.

709
00:33:51,540 --> 00:33:53,280
So I'm going to put my bet down.

710
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:54,280
What do you think?

711
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:59,320
Because I heard a very recent interview with him where he was talking a lot about ML.

712
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:00,320
And it was funny.

713
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:01,800
The guy in the room was like, is that what you're doing now?

714
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:02,800
I was like, wait, what?

715
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:07,000
I thought you were the Xamarin dude, which turns out he was doing like some stuff at

716
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,000
Microsoft.

717
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,240
Ah, I see where you're going.

718
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:10,960
I think he's starting something.

719
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:11,960
He's not going anywhere.

720
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:12,960
Right.

721
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:13,960
Right.

722
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:14,960
Of course.

723
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:15,960
And I'm good.

724
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:17,020
I actually, he makes great stuff.

725
00:34:17,020 --> 00:34:20,400
Just walk into like Kleiner Perkins like, I would like to start a business.

726
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:22,240
Please give me a check.

727
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:24,280
And they'll do it because they would be stupid.

728
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:25,280
Who's yeah.

729
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:26,280
Oh, man.

730
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:27,400
That's that's a nice spot to be in.

731
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:28,800
Enjoy your vacation, Miguel.

732
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:33,840
Can't wait to see what's up in the fall.

733
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:35,780
Datadog.com slash Coder Radio.

734
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:38,520
Go there, get a free trial and a free t-shirt.

735
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:43,160
So Datadog is a software as a service monitoring and security platform.

736
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:44,960
It takes care of so much stuff.

737
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:50,320
It enables full stack observability for developers, IT operations, security individuals, your

738
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:52,360
business is out there, they're just working in the cloud age.

739
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:55,400
I mean, your stack, they can monitor it.

740
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:59,480
Their platform has over 500 vendor backed integrations.

741
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:02,880
So that means not only can you get all like the native built in stuff from the OS, but

742
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:08,360
you can correlate all of your metrics from your applications, your logs, security signals,

743
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:14,640
your infrastructure, your application stack, your third party services, everything in one

744
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:17,800
beautiful single pane of glass.

745
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:19,960
This is the promised land, my friends.

746
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:23,800
These capabilities combined with the drag and drop dashboard customizability and the

747
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:27,800
machine learning based alerts, that means your teams can troubleshoot and collaborate

748
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:29,700
more effectively, right?

749
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:34,360
You can prevent them down times and you get enhanced performance reliability and I will

750
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:35,360
say communication.

751
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:38,800
You see, and I don't just break into Accent for nothing, right?

752
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:39,880
It has to be a big deal.

753
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:43,160

Go get that shirt, support the show and happy monitoring.

760
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:08,440
This headline has me rolling.

761
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:15,200
So all of the Android fan boys who wrote in and told me that it's all Apple's fault and

762
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:20,800
that if only Apple supported RCS, the whole messaging situation would be solved.

763
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:26,220
Google wouldn't need half a dozen different chat platforms and Apple would no longer be

764
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:28,880
the bully of the messaging community.

765
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:35,800
Well, AT&T has rolled out RCS messaging for certain select Android fans and it has been

766
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:39,440
a complete dumpster fire.

767
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:45,340
As you might not realize, but of course makes total sense with the RCS system, the carrier

768
00:36:45,340 --> 00:36:48,880
has complete control.

769
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:54,840
And so AT&T thought it would be great to only enable RCS messaging on select devices like

770
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:57,240
the new Galaxy devices.

771
00:36:57,240 --> 00:37:03,480
And that just created a huge problem when RCS systems phones were attempting to text

772
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:10,320
phones that were not on this approved whitelist and AT&T boondoggle the entire transition.

773
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:14,840
And so far, AT&T's response has been basically squat.

774
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:20,800
They have completely crapped it up and RCS messaging has been a clown show.

775
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:27,240
And depending on how you bought your Galaxy S22, you may or may not even get RCS.

776
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:33,200
And what's remarkable is the feature is actually being enabled or disabled in Google's own

777
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:36,680
chat app by the mother frickin carrier.

778
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:38,040
You understand what I'm saying?

779
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:43,760
The carrier is reaching into the chat app and flipping settings depending on their preferences

780
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:45,520
on your phone.

781
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:50,280
RCS has turned out to be a total dumpster fire.

782
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:55,220
One more example of why Google screwed this thing up from the very beginning when they

783
00:37:55,220 --> 00:38:01,920
started with Android and why iMessage is now the blue bubble of all fame because they created

784
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:07,320
a system that took the carriers out that focused on the experience for consumers and then they

785
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:14,400
slowly iterated on that one singular messaging platform for a decade.

786
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:22,120
What Google has done at every single turn is feed control to these monopolistic carriers

787
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:27,080
who manage to crap it up every single time.

788
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:33,920
And here we are now with RCS in the United States and it's made the situation even worse

789
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:38,320
than text messages to iMessage situation that we had before.

790
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:43,440
And this was supposedly the big savior that all the Android fanboys, all the Android techies

791
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:45,400
were going to throw at our face constantly.

792
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:50,680
It is such a great example of how our community screws this kind of stuff up all the time.

793
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:56,120
We get so focused on the technicals, on the specs, and we completely cannot connect with

794
00:38:56,120 --> 00:39:00,060
the actual market realities that drive adoption.

795
00:39:00,060 --> 00:39:05,820
And so we argue from an almost moralistic standpoint like these are the moral arguments

796
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:08,480
why this is the superior route that should be done.

797
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:13,200
Meanwhile the market gives zero Fs about those arguments and does what it's going to do.

798
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:18,180
And it seems like so many in our community are completely blind to this and so they make

799
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:23,520
investments and bets and choose technology stacks based on this view that they have,

800
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:25,880
this skewed technical view of the market.

801
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:26,880
And it's embarrassing.

802
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:30,280
And when you look at our inbox and you look at our mentions and how many people told us

803
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:35,480
how dumb we are because RCS was going to solve all of this and here we are when it finally

804
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:41,080
gets rolled out by a US carrier that's at scale and they just screw the whole thing

805
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:42,080
up.

806
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:43,080
Yeah, right.

807
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:48,280
Anytime the carriers are involved in anything on your phone it's probably bad.

808
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:49,760
I know.

809
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,240
Your anger level is high.

810
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:52,240
It is.

811
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:59,920
It is because this, you know, I've been doing these doing podcasts for 15 years and this

812
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:04,660
is this general problem that I just outlined about this is so rampant in the Linux community

813
00:40:04,660 --> 00:40:10,320
specifically where they get so focused on the specs, the text, right, the licenses and

814
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:13,920
they completely lose all sense of what drives the market.

815
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:18,840
And so that's how you see like people throwing millions at stupid, crazy Linux mobile phones

816
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:21,640
that are never going to get more than 3000 users, right?

817
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:25,020
That's why you see so many Linux users like jumping on board these projects that are never

818
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:28,400
going to go anywhere because the market's already picked a horse.

819
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:32,620
It's like already done three laps around the race and we're just getting saddled.

820
00:40:32,620 --> 00:40:35,240
Like we just do that kind of stuff all the time.

821
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:39,080
And so we are constantly spending effort and resources in places that we're just going

822
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:42,560
to spin our wheels instead of trying to figure out where the market's actually going and

823
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:44,520
creating a product that fulfills that.

824
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:48,080
And it just drives me crazy because it dogs the open source community to the point where

825
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:50,600
they fail to execute over and over again.

826
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:54,400
And you can see that pervasive thinking taking place here in the way people are analyzing

827
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:55,800
this messaging situation.

828
00:40:55,800 --> 00:41:01,080
Well, it's even, you know, if you think about the history of successful open source, it's

829
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:05,600
always when the open source community is ahead of the commercial community, right?

830
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:09,320
And like they're going somewhere where the market wants them to go where like developers

831
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:13,760
wanted the open source solved a lot of problems for a lot of developers.

832
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:17,520
You could look at that as the community got way ahead of where commercial companies were

833
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:19,440
going when it came to software licenses, right?

834
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:20,680
They got that right.

835
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:21,680
Yeah.

836
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:23,200
I mean, we could keep taking this back, right?

837
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:25,800
Web servers, web servers rather.

838
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:26,800
Right?

839
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:27,800
Yeah.

840
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:28,800
Yeah.

841
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:29,800
Mm hmm.

842
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:30,800
I don't know.

843
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:31,800
There's there's a there's 100 things.

844
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:36,080
But anytime you take a successful commercial project or product even and say, we're going

845
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:39,960
to do an open source version of this, you've already lost the game in a lot of ways.

846
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:44,160
I can feel that situation quickly brewing for VR and AR too.

847
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:45,680
Well, that's exactly what I was saying.

848
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:51,000
My hope is that the term the thing I'm begrudgingly calling metaverse that we get some nice open

849
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,320
standards, right?

850
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:57,080
But I'm a little afraid that it's going to be whatever Apple puts out.

851
00:41:57,080 --> 00:42:02,720
So while I'm railing on silly things that happens in the open source community, this

852
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:08,240
next story just seems so gutless, so meek that I just had to call it out on the air.

853
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:13,100
I just, ah, Firefox has been disappointing me a lot.

854
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:19,560
Today or yesterday, a bug was submitted that removed the Yandex search option, as well

855
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:23,000
as a couple of other like mail dot are you related things?

856
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:29,520
Essentially, you know, it was Firefox's participation in the canceling by code of Russia that we

857
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:30,520
mentioned recently.

858
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:35,440
You know, that's fine if enough people in that community project want to make that change,

859
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:36,440
whatever.

860
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:42,840
But what feels really meek about it is they totally used a misleading bug name to hide

861
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:43,840
it.

862
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:46,740
And the description of the bug is also just it feels so corporate.

863
00:42:46,740 --> 00:42:50,000
So the the the bug is now closed.

864
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,440
Update distribution config.

865
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:52,440
Wow.

866
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:53,440
Yeah.

867
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:55,700
Update distribution config is the name of the bug.

868
00:42:55,700 --> 00:42:59,560
And the description of the bug is also ridiculous.

869
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:04,380
It's insured consistency among search configuration for Firefox.

870
00:43:04,380 --> 00:43:12,120
But that is a smokescreen for removing Russian Web services, anything related to Russia,

871
00:43:12,120 --> 00:43:14,360
from Firefox.

872
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:20,600
And they use this essentially both smokescreen of update distribution config to hide the

873
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:23,240
fact that they're doing cancelation by code.

874
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:28,340
I actually think this is the time we should ask ourselves, how far do we take this kind

875
00:43:28,340 --> 00:43:29,340
of thing?

876
00:43:29,340 --> 00:43:35,780
How far do we alter our technological infrastructures, including the Internet, how the Internet routes

877
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:39,120
and the applications that run on layer seven?

878
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:42,080
How do we actually how far do we go in altering this?

879
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:46,680
Because these scale events happen from time to time.

880
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:52,820
Happened in 2014, happened in 2004 with Georgia, Crimea in 2014, right?

881
00:43:52,820 --> 00:43:57,840
This is actually the third time there's been some kind of situation happening in this general

882
00:43:57,840 --> 00:43:59,100
area of the world.

883
00:43:59,100 --> 00:44:03,360
So we've got to think about how we're going to do this and how far we extend this kind

884
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:04,760
of group thing.

885
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:06,600
Where are these ideas coming from?

886
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:09,440
What is the technological justification for doing these?

887
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:11,560
Is it just a social argument?

888
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:13,760
Who's making those social arguments?

889
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:15,960
How much influence should those people have?

890
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:18,400
Those are all questions that are being completely bypassed right now.

891
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:19,400
All right.

892
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:26,760
The kind of problem I see with all this stuff is it's one, it's really weird to me how corporate

893
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:32,480
I know Firefox, like whatever foundation corporations are acting like states.

894
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:34,760
That's just blows my mind.

895
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:40,600
But also, what about Russian community members, like just innocent folks who are like part

896
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:45,900
of the, I'm not talking to Firefox specifically, but like general tech community.

897
00:44:45,900 --> 00:44:48,720
Or just people that are dissidents that are fighting against the government.

898
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:49,720
Right.

899
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:54,840
Is there some risk in cutting off Russian stuff that you will in fact aid the Russian

900
00:44:54,840 --> 00:44:55,840
state?

901
00:44:55,840 --> 00:45:01,280
I'm assuming they're doing this to undermine in some weird, completely ineffective way,

902
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:03,800
the state government of Russia, right?

903
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:06,680
I mean, isn't Yandex just like their Google?

904
00:45:06,680 --> 00:45:08,520
Or am I out of my mind?

905
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:09,520
Yeah.

906
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:14,560
Actually, I always think in these situations, and I know this is opposite thinking these

907
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:19,840
days, but I often think in these kinds of situations, we should err on the side of more

908
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:21,640
information in all cases.

909
00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:22,640
Get it all out on the table.

910
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:24,880
Well, that's kind of what I'm getting to.

911
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:30,120
Shouldn't we be like, hey, Russian folk, I don't know, shouldn't we, I mean, wouldn't

912
00:45:30,120 --> 00:45:33,000
it make more sense to give more information, more access?

913
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,000
Yeah.

914
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:37,480
As a wise man once said, the truth is the first casualty of war.

915
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:40,040
And then we have just kind of doubled down on that.

916
00:45:40,040 --> 00:45:47,960
Also, this change, the way they've done this also affects Firefox ESR, because apparently

917
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:51,400
sys admins love self-destructing software.

918
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:55,680
It's just one of those things where like you have a product, and maybe for some reason

919
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:59,040
you're using this aspect of it, and then overnight, the vendor turns it off.

920
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:00,040
It's gone now.

921
00:46:00,040 --> 00:46:04,000
And it's not what you expect from free software, which is supposed to be sovereign software.

922
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:08,300
I know this is a touchy issue, but we weren't willing to have the conversation when it was

923
00:46:08,300 --> 00:46:13,040
about social justice and we were making changes to code for social justice purposes.

924
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:19,480
Are we willing to have the conversation now that it's over suppressing a specific state?

925
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:21,080
You're not really suppressing the state.

926
00:46:21,080 --> 00:46:22,240
Well, you're trying to, right?

927
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:23,240
I mean, what else?

928
00:46:23,240 --> 00:46:24,560
Are we shaming them?

929
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:26,320
Are we canceling them from society by these changes?

930
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:28,120
I mean, what are we doing here?

931
00:46:28,120 --> 00:46:29,120
There's so much here, right?

932
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:32,360
There's because there's like the practical angle of don't you want more like access for

933
00:46:32,360 --> 00:46:37,000
Russian folk if you feel passionately about this, which like, you know, people pulling

934
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:38,200
podcast apps.

935
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:42,960
It's to me, that's even crazier, but it's like, how else are they going to get unbiased

936
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:43,960
information?

937
00:46:43,960 --> 00:46:47,800
Like they're just all they have left is the government propaganda is the state media.

938
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:48,800
Yeah.

939
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:52,280
Also, like, I know we don't like RMS anymore.

940
00:46:52,280 --> 00:46:55,040
I get it fine.

941
00:46:55,040 --> 00:47:02,000
But one of the tenants of free software by design is that people can't do like this.

942
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:05,200
This is why everything going to the cloud and mink services.

943
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:13,800
It's real weird how just in what, 30 years, how you really don't quote unquote, own or

944
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:17,280
control your software, even when it's free software.

945
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:20,400
I think that is the part that got me I think you just nailed that I couldn't really put

946
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:21,400
words to it.

947
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:24,400
I mean, you could see a more sinister case where like,

948
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:28,000
edge I could see Microsoft edge doing this or maybe even Google Chrome.

949
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:31,560
Let's just not make it about, you know, the specific conflict.

950
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:35,900
Let's say the Russian state, for example, does this themselves, right?

951
00:47:35,900 --> 00:47:39,520
They just take out the cloud services inside the board, which they do all the time, right?

952
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:41,640
China does it all the time, too.

953
00:47:41,640 --> 00:47:42,720
Just go watch revolution OS.

954
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:43,720
I don't even know what to say.

955
00:47:43,720 --> 00:47:44,720
Right?

956
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:45,720
I like it.

957
00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:46,720
Yeah.

958
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:49,000
It feels like what we're doing is so I was I was just extra I'm game theory in this a

959
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:50,000
little bit.

960
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,880
Let's say China invades Taiwan.

961
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:58,960
And does corporate America do this same voluntary voluntary sanctions, self sanctioning?

962
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:03,280
Will that happen is are their economic ties to China too great?

963
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:05,000
So now we're going to see a double standard.

964
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:06,480
Either way, it's not a good scenario.

965
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:11,280
And what we are doing is we are creating something is inherently opposite of the technology.

966
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:14,920
TCP IP is designed to route around problems.

967
00:48:14,920 --> 00:48:17,060
The internet is designed to be self healing.

968
00:48:17,060 --> 00:48:21,760
And we are creating divisions at the human layer.

969
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:23,660
It's not what the technology is built to do.

970
00:48:23,660 --> 00:48:28,520
So we are creating artificial boundaries around our different internets now.

971
00:48:28,520 --> 00:48:31,880
And pretty soon, we're going to have a Western internet, but it's already happening.

972
00:48:31,880 --> 00:48:32,880
Right.

973
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:34,140
And we and we should not be encouraging this.

974
00:48:34,140 --> 00:48:38,460
This is why the federal government invested in services like tour to begin with.

975
00:48:38,460 --> 00:48:40,800
We should not be encouraging a balkanized internet.

976
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:43,520
We do not want a split up internet like this.

977
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:49,360
And it's not good for humanity long term when you just get down to nation states, different

978
00:48:49,360 --> 00:48:56,100
political parties, when you just get down to what is best long term for humanity.

979
00:48:56,100 --> 00:48:57,520
This ain't it chief.

980
00:48:57,520 --> 00:49:01,120
And I think we're gonna get a lot of comments, but I keep making a joke that the dream of

981
00:49:01,120 --> 00:49:02,560
the 90s is dead.

982
00:49:02,560 --> 00:49:03,560
It's really dead.

983
00:49:03,560 --> 00:49:07,320
Like, and for our listeners of a certain age, or maybe too young to understand what the

984
00:49:07,320 --> 00:49:09,320
hell we're talking about.

985
00:49:09,320 --> 00:49:12,160
This was not supposed to go this way.

986
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:17,640
This whole centralization was the exact thing that we, in quotes, the open source community

987
00:49:17,640 --> 00:49:21,300
or not even, you know, not even just the open source people, right?

988
00:49:21,300 --> 00:49:24,680
Like the, the, the Mac guys were like all in it, too, right?

989
00:49:24,680 --> 00:49:29,920
There were some of the, really all the nerds with the one exception of Bill Gates rage

990
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:30,920
you letters.

991
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:32,440
I don't know.

992
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:33,440
We didn't win.

993
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:35,440
The next centralization is going to be the metaverse.

994
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:36,440
Yeah.

995
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:37,440
You know what you're getting though, right?

996
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:39,040
You're going to get, so Russia has its own internet.

997
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:40,280
Well, what else is Russia going to do?

998
00:49:40,280 --> 00:49:41,280
They're going to have their own Firefox.

999
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:45,440
So now you're going to have the Russian fork of Firefox that keeps these Russian services.

1000
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:48,840
And now you're going to have multiple and what do you suppose the chances are that you

1001
00:49:48,840 --> 00:49:53,100
extrapolate that over the next 20 to 30 years and that thing becomes behind and falls behind

1002
00:49:53,100 --> 00:49:54,520
the primary project.

1003
00:49:54,520 --> 00:49:57,440
And now you're exposing all those users to all kinds of vulnerabilities that aren't getting

1004
00:49:57,440 --> 00:50:00,600
patched because it can't stay up with upstream.

1005
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:05,640
Like that's, that's exactly where this goes because you can fork these things.

1006
00:50:05,640 --> 00:50:10,840
We are essentially introducing opportunity for all these divisions from financial divisions

1007
00:50:10,840 --> 00:50:14,960
on how they purchase and trading goods to their internet and their software that they

1008
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:16,820
use in the services they use.

1009
00:50:16,820 --> 00:50:23,520
We are essentially inviting a, a splitting up of services, a forking off a creation of

1010
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:24,560
their own thing.

1011
00:50:24,560 --> 00:50:26,400
And we are diluting resources.

1012
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:31,360
We are diluting access to information and God, it just seems so short-sighted.

1013
00:50:31,360 --> 00:50:32,360
I don't know.

1014
00:50:32,360 --> 00:50:33,600
Do you want to start a BBS and cry with me?

1015
00:50:33,600 --> 00:50:37,040
I mean, we've gotten nowhere to go, right?

1016
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:39,280
It's podcasts is all that remain, man.

1017
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:41,320
No, not for much longer.

1018
00:50:41,320 --> 00:50:42,320
Sorry.

1019
00:50:42,320 --> 00:50:44,080
Have you, have you met my friend, Joe Rogan?

1020
00:50:44,080 --> 00:50:45,560
Oh, it's a tricky time, right?

1021
00:50:45,560 --> 00:50:51,200
I mean, it is a really, I mean, I also, you know, I also feel like there should be a cost

1022
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:53,800
for invading another country and so we have to walk that line.

1023
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:54,800
So I do get it.

1024
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:58,760
I don't think either of us, like, I'm sure we're very like sympathetic and you know,

1025
00:50:58,760 --> 00:51:00,800
God bless Ukrainians and all that.

1026
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:02,880
I just worry, right?

1027
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:05,140
The problem is it's like guns.

1028
00:51:05,140 --> 00:51:08,000
Gun can be used by a good guy, gun can be used by a bad guy.

1029
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,480
Linux could be used to launch a Russian missile.

1030
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:12,880
It can be used to launch a Western missile.

1031
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:15,400
It can be used to run Alice.

1032
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:19,760
It could be used to run one of her horrible do not buy them competitors.

1033
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:21,320
See, capitalism.

1034
00:51:21,320 --> 00:51:22,320
Yeah.

1035
00:51:22,320 --> 00:51:25,200
And I get the argument too, like, you know, West is in the chat room too.

1036
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:28,040
It's like you could see the argument that, well, they created, they originally created

1037
00:51:28,040 --> 00:51:29,160
the divisions.

1038
00:51:29,160 --> 00:51:34,880
I think I take a longer like sort of meta anti-war, anti-conflict standpoint in this,

1039
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:35,880
right?

1040
00:51:35,880 --> 00:51:38,440
Are we really going to go full utopian RMS line?

1041
00:51:38,440 --> 00:51:39,500
Let's just do it.

1042
00:51:39,500 --> 00:51:45,440
One of the ideas was that the technical community would be so interconnected that it would make

1043
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:49,920
stupid these little, these little, you know, nation state fights hard.

1044
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:51,960
Now that's not the case.

1045
00:51:51,960 --> 00:51:54,040
It's not going to be the case, right?

1046
00:51:54,040 --> 00:51:58,720
What happens when I'll fry some bacon, get me some, uh, I don't really know any Russian

1047
00:51:58,720 --> 00:51:59,780
sausage names.

1048
00:51:59,780 --> 00:52:02,120
I got something that just looks like it's written in Russian.

1049
00:52:02,120 --> 00:52:05,240
I don't know what it, I don't know what flavor it is though.

1050
00:52:05,240 --> 00:52:06,240
Okay.

1051
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:11,160
How many days are we away from a, uh, open source project throwing off like Russian board

1052
00:52:11,160 --> 00:52:12,720
members who've been contributing?

1053
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:14,440
Oh, this is rat bacon.

1054
00:52:14,440 --> 00:52:16,160
Oh God.

1055
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:18,200
Yeah, maybe.

1056
00:52:18,200 --> 00:52:19,200
I hope not.

1057
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:20,560
I mean, I feel like it's going to happen.

1058
00:52:20,560 --> 00:52:24,440
It's going to be the new kind of the new Scarlet letter.

1059
00:52:24,440 --> 00:52:28,200
So I don't know as we're both canceled.

1060
00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:29,200
It's tricky, right?

1061
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:33,960
Because it feels like engineers and developers, they're always kind of caught in the middle

1062
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:34,960
here, right?

1063
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:39,680
Cause they're so often are into, into it for the technology and that kind of stuff.

1064
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:45,680
And then world events happen and technology cannot avoid it.

1065
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:50,480
It's like, despite what we might prefer, there's a lot of big questions here and you know,

1066
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:51,480
maybe we're wrong.

1067
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:53,000
Maybe you and I are wrong on this.

1068
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:57,720
There is a really sensible reason to kind of balkanize our societies even more, create

1069
00:52:57,720 --> 00:53:00,960
division and create people that are dependent on government propaganda.

1070
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:06,600
Perhaps I am too short-sighted and, uh, I don't see the long-term benefits of that,

1071
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:11,040
but my view on it is that long-term it's a bad thing and that we're kind of perpetuating

1072
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:14,640
it via something that could have remained neutral.

1073
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:19,200
So we're taking things that have the ability to remain neutral that would really have no

1074
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:22,000
large impact, right?

1075
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,540
Keeping these changes out of Firefox, right?

1076
00:53:24,540 --> 00:53:30,340
These four or five changes they made really will have zero impact on this conflict.

1077
00:53:30,340 --> 00:53:32,960
It only has the impact of hurting people.

1078
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:35,960
I mean, come on, even if that's what this particular one, I don't know.

1079
00:53:35,960 --> 00:53:41,120
It's minor and there'll probably be forks and workarounds and extensions and other browsers.

1080
00:53:41,120 --> 00:53:46,840
So it's, it really, you really, when you think about the impact it has, it's negative if

1081
00:53:46,840 --> 00:53:48,920
anything and hardly anything.

1082
00:53:48,920 --> 00:53:54,120
And yet we're still taking something that could have just stayed out of it.

1083
00:53:54,120 --> 00:53:58,860
And of course the way they did it with this, you know, you know something's a little off

1084
00:53:58,860 --> 00:54:02,840
when they're doing it with this stupid name like update distribution config as the title

1085
00:54:02,840 --> 00:54:04,760
of the bug, right?

1086
00:54:04,760 --> 00:54:09,180
With the description of ensure consistency among search configuration for Firefox.

1087
00:54:09,180 --> 00:54:12,480
They're intentionally trying to just keep it a little low key.

1088
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:16,040
They didn't want this to bubble up, but people saw it.

1089
00:54:16,040 --> 00:54:18,300
We're headed towards Star Wars, not Star Trek.

1090
00:54:18,300 --> 00:54:19,300
That's the future.

1091
00:54:19,300 --> 00:54:21,120
And that's really bad.

1092
00:54:21,120 --> 00:54:22,120
You're right.

1093
00:54:22,120 --> 00:54:25,660
What's funny is right now the people that are in charge would be the people that would

1094
00:54:25,660 --> 00:54:30,720
be kind of, you'd think the people responsible for a Star Trek, like one world government

1095
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:33,280
that works out to a utopia where everybody gets along, right?

1096
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:37,400
You'd think that's a progressive future, but ironically I look at the people in charge

1097
00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:41,440
that would probably label themselves as, you know, closer to progressives than the previous

1098
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:43,840
administration and they're running full head into this.

1099
00:54:43,840 --> 00:54:44,840
You know, they haven't even attempted.

1100
00:54:44,840 --> 00:54:47,200
I'm now, this is the last thing I'll have to say and then we're done.

1101
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:49,280
They haven't even attempted to stop this thing.

1102
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:53,840
They haven't even attempted to do negotiations and they are making sure to supply arms, but

1103
00:54:53,840 --> 00:54:57,120
they have not been at a single one of the negotiations between Ukraine and Russia.

1104
00:54:57,120 --> 00:54:58,360
The US has not.

1105
00:54:58,360 --> 00:54:59,360
They're welcome.

1106
00:54:59,360 --> 00:55:00,360
They've been invited.

1107
00:55:00,360 --> 00:55:01,360
Why aren't they there?

1108
00:55:01,360 --> 00:55:03,360
Because they're not trying to stop the war.

1109
00:55:03,360 --> 00:55:04,360
So yeah, you're right.

1110
00:55:04,360 --> 00:55:07,000
We are going into Star Wars for sure, man.

1111
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:11,080
And like it's going to have long-term ramifications on our industry and a lot of ways and I, we

1112
00:55:11,080 --> 00:55:14,280
don't need to make this a political show or I don't think this will be a recurring thing,

1113
00:55:14,280 --> 00:55:17,040
but we've been doing a great job for the last month and a half.

1114
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:18,900
We're trying to, at least we save it to the end now.

1115
00:55:18,900 --> 00:55:23,880
You know, we, we try that at least, but I guess we could talk more about the max studio.

1116
00:55:23,880 --> 00:55:27,000
It's just like, when you look at what's going to have long-term impacts now, last couple

1117
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:28,040
of years it was COVID.

1118
00:55:28,040 --> 00:55:30,520
We're still going to be dealing with that, but right now the most immediate thing, it's

1119
00:55:30,520 --> 00:55:31,520
going to be this conflict.

1120
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:32,520
It's going to change things.

1121
00:55:32,520 --> 00:55:35,840
You know, we should do it for one of the code or lose, maybe you guys should subscribe.

1122
00:55:35,840 --> 00:55:39,880
We should do the, uh, the dream of the original tech revolution.

1123
00:55:39,880 --> 00:55:42,600
Let's start in the seventies and do seventies, eighties, nineties.

1124
00:55:42,600 --> 00:55:43,600
I could see that.

1125
00:55:43,600 --> 00:55:45,920
I'll rewatch revolution OS to like refresh myself.

1126
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:46,920
And let's see where we landed.

1127
00:55:46,920 --> 00:55:51,080
Cause I have a feeling you and I are both going to need a stiff cocktail.

1128
00:55:51,080 --> 00:55:56,560
You know, it's bad when you and I politically are like coming aligned as the show goes on.

1129
00:55:56,560 --> 00:55:58,240
It's not good yet.

1130
00:55:58,240 --> 00:56:02,400
Like when it started, we were pretty far apart and this time has gone on where you were like,

1131
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:05,720
we're starting to like, oh crap, this is a problem, both from different sides, but seeing

1132
00:56:05,720 --> 00:56:06,720
the same problem.

1133
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:09,600
And so, yeah, I think that I'd love to watch it, just a good movie in general, and you

1134
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:13,720
can become a coder member, support the show and get access to the code of the report by

1135
00:56:13,720 --> 00:56:18,920
going to coder QA dot co, or you can get access to that by supporting all of the network shows

1136
00:56:18,920 --> 00:56:20,400
at Jupiter dot party.

1137
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:24,520
You join the party, support the shows and get access to all of the special features.

1138
00:56:24,520 --> 00:56:26,040
And we really appreciate it.

1139
00:56:26,040 --> 00:56:29,840
Let's be picky about who we work with from a sponsor standpoint and let's us take our

1140
00:56:29,840 --> 00:56:33,960
time to make sure those things work out in a way that's beneficial for you and us.

1141
00:56:33,960 --> 00:56:35,520
That's a coder QA dot co.

1142
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:39,120
Mr. Dominic, is there anywhere you want to send people this week now that we got them

1143
00:56:39,120 --> 00:56:40,120
all fired up?

1144
00:56:40,120 --> 00:56:44,040
Go to Alice dot dev and inquire about some automation goodness.

1145
00:56:44,040 --> 00:56:47,640
Yeah, take something off your plate for goodness sake.

1146
00:56:47,640 --> 00:56:49,200
Go to Alice dot dev.

1147
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:52,020
You can follow the show at Coder Radio Show on the Twitters.

1148
00:56:52,020 --> 00:56:55,920
We also have the feedback and general discussion on our matrix.

1149
00:56:55,920 --> 00:56:59,840
You can go find that at colony dot Jupiter broadcasting dot com if you got the element

1150
00:56:59,840 --> 00:57:01,400
plan or however you matrix.

1151
00:57:01,400 --> 00:57:04,080
It's blowing up over there, blowing up over there.

1152
00:57:04,080 --> 00:57:05,080
Go participate.

1153
00:57:05,080 --> 00:57:06,080
It's been a lot of fun.

1154
00:57:06,080 --> 00:57:09,400
Links to some of the stuff we talked about today and a lot more are at Coder dot show

1155
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:11,760
slash three five seven.

1156
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:15,340
Over there you're also going to find our RSS feed as well as our contact form.

1157
00:57:15,340 --> 00:57:16,640
That is the nuts and bolts of the show.

1158
00:57:16,640 --> 00:57:17,640
We want to hear from you.

1159
