00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
This is KOTORadio, episode 380 for September 21st, 2020.

2
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,720
Hello friends, and welcome to Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show, taking a pragmatic look

3
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:40,420
at the art and business of software development and the world of technology.

4
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:44,960
This episode is brought to you by a Cloud Guru, the leader in hands-on training.

5
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:47,580
The only way to really learn and lock in a new skill is by doing.

6
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:51,480
That's why ACG provides hands-on labs, cloud Linux servers, and much more.

7
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:54,460
Get your hands cloudy at acloudguru.com.

8
00:00:54,460 --> 00:01:00,880
My name is Chris, and joining me every single week is our man stationed in Florida.

9
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:03,640
The developer from down under, it is Mr. Dominic.

10
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:05,520
How's it going down there, Mr. Dominic?

11
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:08,140
Top of the morning to you, top of the morning to you.

12
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:09,640
Top of the afternoon to you, sir.

13
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:10,640
Top of the afternoon.

14
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:11,640
Yeah.

15
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:14,720
We have a time zone difference, and you'd think three hours is not really a big deal,

16
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:18,520
but like that's an entire different phase of your day.

17
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:20,360
You know, you're like, you're going into the evening.

18
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:21,640
I haven't even had lunch yet.

19
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:22,640
Yes.

20
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:23,640
Yeah.

21
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:27,360
It's weird how, but yet you think three hours, that's no big deal.

22
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:32,280
And over here on the West Coast, I can say it, it does feel like a good portion of the

23
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:35,240
entire country just runs off of East Coast time.

24
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:40,840
I feel like every meeting I set up, I actually go into that email exchange just knowing that

25
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:44,360
they're on the East Coast and just go with East Coast time.

26
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:49,300
It's like, it plagues us over on the West Coast.

27
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:51,680
So how has things been since we gathered together?

28
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,680
Good, good.

29
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,680
Yeah.

30
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,680
You know, just coding.

31
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:55,680
Sleeping.

32
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:56,680
Coding, sleeping.

33
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:57,680
Good.

34
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:58,680
Are you sleeping?

35
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,680
Yeah.

36
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:00,680
Are you getting your sleep?

37
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:01,680
I sleep a lot now.

38
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,680
Are you drinking your water?

39
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:03,680
I have my water today.

40
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:04,680
I have coffee.

41
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:07,840
Oh, well now you know that can dehydrate you, so I want you to drink your water.

42
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:10,440
This is like a physical, what do they call that?

43
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:11,800
Physical therapy session, right?

44
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:12,800
You got to stretch.

45
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,800
You got to stretch every morning.

46
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,800
Do your yoga.

47
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,800
Yeah.

48
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:16,800
Right.

49
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,520
I call it Chris Plus Fitness, and it's $9.99 a month, and I just check in with you once

50
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,520
a week.

51
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,840
You're going to get some really crappy TV shows with it.

52
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:27,000
You just get this voice call, and because I'm a cheapskate, I just lump it in with our

53
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,440
show, but I do charge you for it, so good for me.

54
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,200
That sounds oddly familiar.

55
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,240
I'm just trying to bring up my services revenue.

56
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,240
You understand.

57
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:40,040
Well, you do get a better multiple on your stock price for services revenue.

58
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:42,840
That's for sure, and it seems like Wall Street loves it.

59
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:45,960
Just like the audiences loved our feedback forum this week.

60
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:48,920
We got some great feedback, and Mike and I love this.

61
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:52,560
I'd love to have a problem where some weeks the entire show is feedback, because it not

62
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:57,480
only gives us a signal of what the audience is interested in, which is rewarding for us,

63
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:02,180
but it also often leads to conversations that we never even conceived before we sat down

64
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:03,180
to record.

65
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:07,560
So please do go to coder.show slash contact, or you can just email... Yeah, I think it's

66
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,520
just coder at jupiterbroadcasting.com.

67
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:13,600
The safest bet is to use the contact form, because then it goes to all the right places.

68
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:27,840
There's also the Twitter, which is how Ito... Boy, this is... Ito... I don't know on

69
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:28,840
that one.

70
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:32,220
But he says, hey guys, will Coder Radio bring back the sound board?

71
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:36,120
Last episode I heard a get it out of here and a business mentioned, but they weren't

72
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,920
played in the show.

73
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:38,920
I don't believe you.

74
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:41,000
No, I don't know about that.

75
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,520
Whenever we talk about business, we often use the sound board.

76
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:48,380
But we don't want it to be inappropriate, because then it sort of dominates the show

77
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:50,240
the entire time.

78
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:53,960
And like we always say, you don't want to over dominate the show.

79
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:54,960
Wes was right.

80
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:55,960
Wes was right.

81
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:56,960
You don't want it to do that.

82
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:57,960
So it's sparingly.

83
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:01,600
We don't want it to be a morning DJ drive, but it is there.

84
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,160
Get out of here.

85
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:09,280
That was just an amazing pastiche of me being a jackass, except you missed that he's a jackass

86
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,280
one.

87
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,280
Oh, right.

88
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,520
We do have that, don't we?

89
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:17,520
I don't even know if I, I know I have this one, but I don't know if I kept the other

90
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:19,240
one for some reason.

91
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:22,160
There's a couple we've retired over the years.

92
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,720
You know, like we retired the RMS clips too.

93
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:28,840
It just didn't seem like it was, you know, hip anymore to really be playing those.

94
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:31,520
And so yeah, there has been some that come and go.

95
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,180
The sound board is a living beast.

96
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:34,180
That is for sure.

97
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:35,640
So we continue on with the feedback.

98
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:40,160
Kevin writes in about OpenSusa and I, I don't know, maybe we touched on a nerve here.

99
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:46,600
He writes, Mike, I don't know if I can actually read what he says there, but let's just say

100
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:53,960
he implies that you are familiar with many ladies and men and gentlemen, and that while

101
00:04:53,960 --> 00:05:01,640
Red Hat is a 1000 pound gorilla, Seuss in Kevin's opinion is a solid number two in revenue,

102
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:03,960
1500 employees and profitable.

103
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:04,960
Why?

104
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:09,320
SAP certifies their ERP on Seuss and on Windows.

105
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:13,560
So thousands of SAP deployments run Seuss on premises and in cloud.

106
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:17,800
There's a reason the former SAP ops manager runs Seuss as a CEO.

107
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:24,120
And once an enterprise has a little Seuss managed by a Seuss manager or maybe some salt,

108
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:27,340
enterprises figure out how they can manage their Ubuntu and Red Hat sprawl just as nicely

109
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:28,560
as they manage Seuss.

110
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:32,600
They essentially copied Ubuntu now with free leap code and paid support.

111
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,720
You know, Ubuntu is essentially copying Seuss.

112
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:39,220
And finally, they have a very nice container play with the rancher acquisition that's integrating

113
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:42,480
with Seuss's existing container sets right now.

114
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,480
Seuss is relevant.

115
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,880
They are very open.

116
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,680
They contribute lots of real code and they do innovate.

117
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,200
They're not going away.

118
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:54,600
Ubuntu may have a significant market share, but it's at the cost of revenue.

119
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:59,560
Again in Kevin's opinion, they continue to try and figure out how to make real money.

120
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:04,360
They obviously haven't yet or Shuttleworth would have flipped it long before now.

121
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:07,640
So Mike, I think we touched on a nerve with open Seuss.

122
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:12,040
I disagree with everything in this email.

123
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:15,480
So I'll wait to go because I don't want to dominate the response, but what are your thoughts

124
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,480
when you saw this?

125
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:19,740
Did it give you some perspective on the market that Seuss serves?

126
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:24,720
So I actually just had a conversation with someone from the Seuss manager project over

127
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:25,720
at Seuss.

128
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:30,360
Seuss, it is not called Seuss as I was corrected.

129
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:34,680
I actually have a customer using it right now, Seuss enterprise, I'm going to do that

130
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:37,840
every time because I can't help myself.

131
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,360
And yeah, I have not seen it.

132
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:45,720
Like when I do nothing with SAP, so maybe it is huge in SAP, but it does have market

133
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:52,000
share, but only in like super, it's like Germany and regulated market, regulated verticals,

134
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
right?

135
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Yeah.

136
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
You need to have that contract to satisfy.

137
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,560
There's a bunch of like government regulations.

138
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:59,760
I don't know.

139
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:00,760
It's definitely a spicy email.

140
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:07,760
I mean, he makes a point, Seuss and Gano, man, it's killing me.

141
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:08,760
Welcome to my world.

142
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:09,760
Yeah.

143
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:10,760
It's definitely got some market share.

144
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:16,120
I don't know that I'm interested in getting into a disreward because Linux is like 1% of

145
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,120
the desktop market, right?

146
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,820
So let's not kill ourselves here.

147
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:24,600
And I understand we're primarily talking about servers, but yeah, if it works, I still wouldn't

148
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,600
pick it voluntarily.

149
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,600
I'm sorry.

150
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:27,600
Yeah.

151
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:34,000
I've always kind of held back on my criticism because I respect the engineers at Seuss and

152
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,560
the developers who contribute to it and the community.

153
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,560
And I think they have a lot of innovative ideas.

154
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:45,600
I think they've been at the forefront of a lot of simplification via Yast and I applaud

155
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:51,600
them for a lot of the things they've done that when I use Seuss or open Seuss, I feel

156
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:55,360
like these are unique and they're special.

157
00:07:55,360 --> 00:08:01,520
And I always come across something like these clever, clever bastards, but like yourself,

158
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,920
I don't like using it.

159
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:09,360
And I have used it in production, the enterprise version, the supported version.

160
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,240
And I had numerous issues with it.

161
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:17,440
What I find happens here from people who are big into the open Seuss side of things is

162
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:21,800
they kind of delude themselves a little bit and kind of hand wave away things that really

163
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:22,800
matter.

164
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,800
1500 employees and profitable.

165
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:28,720
Yeah, but not so profitable that they haven't been sold half a dozen times in just as many

166
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:37,400
years and justifying its relevancy because it's required to use SAP doesn't really speak

167
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:41,820
to the same level of engagement that other distributions get because people are voluntarily

168
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:44,220
installing them and choosing to run them.

169
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:49,240
I grant you that you can manage a Seuss or open Seuss or whatever with the same kind

170
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:51,840
of tools you could manage other Linux boxes.

171
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:58,840
But the Seuss boxes will always be the exception because they do things just a little bit differently,

172
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:04,320
a little differently, like Slackware did them, and they kind of branched off from a different

173
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:10,360
technology point in Linux history and have kept some of that uniqueness that, in my opinion,

174
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:15,080
when you have two dominant players, Ubuntu and Red Hat, it makes Seuss of the oddball

175
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,080
out.

176
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:20,260
Now, true, they've made a recent play towards containers.

177
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:24,520
He mentions the rancher acquisition, I would argue 10 years too late.

178
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:27,040
I would argue at minimum five years too late.

179
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,040
Spicy.

180
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,040
Yeah, it is.

181
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,260
And they're so proud of it.

182
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:33,820
That's the worst thing about it is God forbid you say anything about it because this in

183
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:38,660
particular is quite the area of pride for them because again, they really have something

184
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:42,640
clever and they have something unique and special just like they do in the open Seuss

185
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:47,240
a build service, just like they do in just the presentation of the distribution.

186
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:53,400
And I mean, I used to buy every single version of Seuss in the box with the DVD set and the

187
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:56,280
manuals just to support the project.

188
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:58,880
Probably a $90 box set.

189
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:03,960
I really don't have any animosity, but the reality is the reality and the market backs

190
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,400
me up on this opinion.

191
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:09,380
And the fact of the matter is their container play was too late.

192
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:10,380
It's too late.

193
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:12,400
The industry has built its own solutions now.

194
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:15,280
And then at the very end here, Kevin, and I'm not trying to come at you, but I'm just

195
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:18,040
trying to point out some of the policies I see in your argument.

196
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:21,280
He says, Ubuntu has a significant market share, but it's at the cost of revenue.

197
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:23,000
Well show me where you can see that.

198
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,820
Because as far as I remember, Canonical is a private company and the disclosure they

199
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:27,480
do make is once a year.

200
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:31,240
And that disclosure seems to indicate they're making millions of dollars.

201
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:35,920
And I mean like 30s of millions of dollars off of Ubuntu support.

202
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,380
They're making quite a bit of money.

203
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:40,520
So I'm not quite sure where you're saying it's at the cost of revenue.

204
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:42,260
They seem to be in a really sweet spot.

205
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:47,880
And now they've just expanded their OEM deals for the desktop version to include HP and

206
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:48,880
Lenovo.

207
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:54,240
So now they have Dell, HP and Lenovo as first party OEMs who are paying them a per sale

208
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,780
license fee.

209
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:59,040
So now they've also made the desktop profitable.

210
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:02,920
So I just don't really track where Kevin's coming at here, but this is generally the

211
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:06,140
reality I see painted by most SUSE advocates.

212
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:11,080
And if this world clicks for them, I say more power to them because it is something that's

213
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,080
unique.

214
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,180
It has a lot of great solutions.

215
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:17,080
It has a brilliant community and a brilliant development team behind it.

216
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:19,960
And it's a very high quality distribution.

217
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,220
Just not for me.

218
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:24,200
Just doesn't fit the reality that I see in the marketplace.

219
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,600
And I think the wider market statistics bear that out.

220
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,240
But have at it.

221
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,240
That's my opinion.

222
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:32,680
You are welcome to respond at coder.show slash contact.

223
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:33,680
Hot take, Mike.

224
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:34,680
Hot take.

225
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:35,680
Hot take.

226
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:36,680
Spicy.

227
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:37,680
Yeah.

228
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:38,680
Spicy.

229
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:39,680
Soleus writes in.

230
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:40,680
So another feedback.

231
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:41,680
And this one's about Flask.

232
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:44,480
He says, super happy the show is back.

233
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:47,380
It's always been a favorite J.B. show, and I'm happy for the opportunity to support the

234
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:48,880
show via membership too.

235
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:51,540
Oh, thanks for joining the QA team.

236
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:55,000
So he goes on to say, Mike recently started talking about Python and Flask.

237
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,960
When COVID hit us, it marked my journey into Python and Flask, and I have been learning

238
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,920
and doing it since March of this year.

239
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:01,920
Interesting.

240
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,640
I wonder if that's been true for anyone else.

241
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:07,760
He goes on to say, I was hoping Mike could talk a little bit about his work with Flask.

242
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:08,760
Any tips?

243
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:09,760
Any pitfalls?

244
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:10,760
Maybe some use cases?

245
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:12,200
Any tests or blueprints?

246
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,200
Does he use them or not?

247
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:16,320
I also wanted to share a link to Miguel Ginsburg's blog.

248
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,440
I find it really good.

249
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:20,400
It mainly focuses on Flask, and we'll have a link to that in the show notes.

250
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,520
It says, thanks for coming back.

251
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:22,740
We missed you.

252
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:24,680
So any further thoughts on Flask?

253
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:25,680
Aw.

254
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:26,680
Yeah.

255
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:30,000
So right off the bat, yes, I do use blueprints, and I like them a lot.

256
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
What is that exactly?

257
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Is that-

258
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,020
So instead of having like at rest requests or whatever it is, whatever the stupid annotation

259
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:41,960
is in Flask, you can actually create a blueprint file that kind of automagically gives you-

260
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,160
Basic components or-

261
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:46,740
Well, it's like one file where all the requests for a given model can be.

262
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:49,520
That's a super, like all the API endpoints, right?

263
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:51,320
That's a super simplified explanation.

264
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:52,320
Okay.

265
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:57,160
But the way I use it is it's a way to organize your code where you just add the blueprint

266
00:12:57,160 --> 00:13:01,680
into your external JSON API, and that's where everything is.

267
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:06,320
Blueprints can greatly simplify how large applications work and provide central means

268
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:10,360
for Flask extensions to register operations on applications.

269
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:11,360
Okay.

270
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,360
All right.

271
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:15,520
Fancy way to say API calls, right?

272
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:16,520
Okay.

273
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:17,520
Yeah.

274
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:18,520
I didn't know that.

275
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:19,520
That's great to know.

276
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:20,520
So you love them.

277
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:21,520
I love them.

278
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:25,880
It's one of those things that you either should go all in on it or not though, right?

279
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:29,480
Because you want consistency in your architecture.

280
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:35,280
The general things on Flask, if you haven't yet, check out the Pylance thing from VS Code.

281
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:39,080
That's some slick stuff they've got going over there.

282
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:41,720
Well then, link to that in the show notes too.

283
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:45,640
Coder.show slash three eight zero, assuming we remember to do it.

284
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:46,640
Thanks for writing that in.

285
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:47,960
And now I just learned a little something.

286
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:48,960
I'm over here on-

287
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:53,360
I'm over on the website reading about blueprints now and I didn't even know I'd be getting

288
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,360
to that.

289
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:57,160
That's what I was talking about when we started the feedback segment, is like you get into

290
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:59,600
stuff you didn't even know you'd be talking about.

291
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:05,160
TJ writes into the program and follows up on the topics of developers getting paid for

292
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:06,520
open source work.

293
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:11,240
He writes in episode 378, you received a listener message about open source developers not getting

294
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:12,240
paid.

295
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:18,360
Well, there was an interesting proposal about dealing with that by Mr. Big Shot, Bruce Perens

296
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:23,940
at Tebcov 2020, and he links to the WebM file, which we will pass along to the show notes.

297
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:29,000
The presentation is 44 minutes long and he does get into the issue of creating coherent

298
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
licenses.

299
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:36,700
He talks about maybe a contract law where users would have use case consent that has

300
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:38,440
been given to them by developers.

301
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:39,900
I mean, it's it's deep.

302
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:41,600
It goes really deep.

303
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:45,640
And I mean, we could probably do an entire show on it if we wanted to.

304
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:49,280
So I will put the link to the video and then if we get people that seem to be into it,

305
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:52,280
maybe we make a segment out of it, but otherwise we'll leave it as homework.

306
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:54,360
That seems fair.

307
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:55,360
That sounds good to me.

308
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,000
Decision has been made.

309
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,920
All right.

310
00:14:58,920 --> 00:14:59,920
You know what?

311
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:00,920
We're cranking through this.

312
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:01,920
I'm proud of us.

313
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,760
So we have one last feedback to get to.

314
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,280
And this is great.

315
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:07,720
It's from David C. Also welcoming us back.

316
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:11,380
And he says, I'm writing in to follow up on something I tweeted at you both regarding

317
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:13,400
the live audio stream.

318
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:16,880
So basically, I've been listening for quite a long time and I've been around during most

319
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,920
of the live shows whenever I can make time.

320
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:23,280
I am currently in the enthusiast space, but I'm moving myself little by little towards

321
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:24,280
game development.

322
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:29,160
I've been enjoying the J.B. shows for years and Kota Radio specifically as far back as

323
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:31,040
episode 30.

324
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:36,160
I tend to work on projects catching up whenever the backlog gets accumulated.

325
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:37,800
And of course, during everyday life.

326
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:42,400
All of this is to say I was a frequenter of the J.B. live FM audio stream provided on

327
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,160
the site.

328
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:47,160
But he finds himself to be very distractible.

329
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:50,680
And if he leaves it in the browser, he ends up forgetting about it and just closes the

330
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:52,240
browser.

331
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:55,200
Something standalone to keep myself accountable and off Twitter is what I was thinking.

332
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,200
That way I don't procrastinate.

333
00:15:56,200 --> 00:16:00,040
Needless to say, I was excited and I started a project.

334
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:05,120
I recently dusted it off again and it's on my GitHub page, J.B. live radio.

335
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,120
Hmm.

336
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:08,680
It's super simple and it has some issues.

337
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:12,320
Typically I'm not typically a JavaScript framework user, so forgive me.

338
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:16,280
It's a bit rough, but I'd love someone to overlook the current state of the project

339
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:17,280
on my GitHub.

340
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:20,480
I know there's unfinished stuff and some of the code might not be perfect, but I'd

341
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,600
love some help.

342
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:25,160
The idea is to create a simple to use app to play the live stream.

343
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:29,600
Unfortunately, due to some day job stuff, I'll be unable to attend live this Monday,

344
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,520
but rest assured, I'll catch up quickly.

345
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:35,040
Anyways, I'm super happy you guys are back and I'm excited to get back to listening.

346
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,200
Thanks, David.

347
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:39,680
I love it when people build these apps around our stuff.

348
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:42,680
It's just super cool to see people taking the time to do that.

349
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:46,520
And I feel like we could be doing more with the audio stream because it's a high quality

350
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:47,520
audio stream.

351
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:50,000
We've put in some effort.

352
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Is that the way to say?

353
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
I've put some effort.

354
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,600
We have, Wes and I, put effort into making sure it sounds really good and all that kind

355
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:56,600
of stuff.

356
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:57,600
So we should be doing more with it.

357
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,680
So an app around that's a great idea, I feel like.

358
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:00,680
Yeah.

359
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:02,920
I mean, especially if you don't want to be like in browser tabs while you're listening,

360
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:07,880
I think that's honestly a great idea, standalone app to get the live stream.

361
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:09,120
And less resources too.

362
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:10,120
Right.

363
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:11,120
Which is what I think he's talking about.

364
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:12,120
The live stream, right?

365
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:18,760
The JBLive FM is it's either like the reruns or when we are live streaming that takes over

366
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:20,160
and it's a it's a live stream.

367
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:26,720
And what's nice about that is generally we try to strike the balance of low enough bit

368
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:30,920
rate that you could probably stream it on your phone in the car, but high enough that

369
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:33,660
it still sounds really good, like on desktop speakers.

370
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:35,080
So that's kind of where we try.

371
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:36,080
That's a hard balance.

372
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:38,600
And we do some processing to make that possible.

373
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:42,480
And so that's where we came up with the idea and you just put JBLive FM in and if it's

374
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:46,940
like VLC or your web browser will support it now, it just starts playing and it's either

375
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:47,940
live or reruns.

376
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:53,240
It's not really a clear delineation, but it's kind of obvious because the reruns are all

377
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:56,300
really old.

378
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:59,400
So yeah, you'll probably figure it out.

379
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,400
Yeah.

380
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,760
No, this is a great idea.

381
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:02,940
I mean, I'll definitely check it out.

382
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:07,040
And if we'll have the link in the show notes today, anybody wants to see it is a so it's

383
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:08,720
an I'm looking at it now it's electron.

384
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:11,880
You can build it for Mac, Windows and Linux.

385
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:12,880
Great.

386
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:13,880
Yeah.

387
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:15,920
Yeah, I'll probably check this out because you know what?

388
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:18,920
It's one of those things that just having in your toolbar would be nice.

389
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:19,920
Yeah.

390
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:20,920
Yep.

391
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:27,200
And if you have a ice cast streaming client of choice, put in JBLive FM and it will redirect

392
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:34,520
you to the live stream URL and it'll just play in your player of choice.

393
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:39,940
Linode.com slash coder go there and receive a one hundred dollar credit towards a new

394
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:42,040
account for 60 days.

395
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:44,580
Linode solves the problem of servers.

396
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:46,860
It solves the problem of infrastructure.

397
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:50,760
You simplify your cloud infrastructure with Linode's Linux virtual machines and robust

398
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:53,220
set of tools built around that.

399
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:57,360
And they're also solving the price problem because Linode is 30 to 50 percent less than

400
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:00,600
major cloud providers like AWS.

401
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:04,040
We use Linode here at Jupiter Broadcasting for our back end infrastructure.

402
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:05,440
More and more all the time.

403
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,220
The pricing structure is really simple.

404
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:10,760
You can spin up the machine that matches exactly our needs.

405
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:14,160
Sometimes like when I'm doing an SSH tunnel server that just does a jump post for me.

406
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:17,960
Well, that's like a five dollar a month rig and that is great.

407
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:22,900
But sometimes we're doing things like processing show files and we need a dedicated CPU.

408
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:24,060
They have that as well.

409
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:29,200
But beyond the technology, as a small business owner, I feel comfortable relying on Linode

410
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:33,420
for my critical infrastructure, the stuff that makes my business possible.

411
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:38,540
And the reason for that is Linode's been around for essentially as long as user mode Linux

412
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:39,720
has been around.

413
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:43,280
They're not some fly by night company that got a bunch of VC funding and has an idea

414
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,760
to take on AWS.

415
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:48,800
No, they've been around since nearly the beginning of this being possible.

416
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:53,400
A young developer and technologist, Christopher Acker, saw an opportunity to do something

417
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:58,760
more than just host another application, which is kind of what people really see in user

418
00:19:58,760 --> 00:19:59,760
mode Linux for.

419
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:01,080
That was the Salesforce model.

420
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:06,120
But he saw a way of taking cloud computing and making it less complicated, less expensive

421
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:11,280
and maybe even most importantly, more accessible to every developer, regardless of where they're

422
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:16,040
located or really what their resources are or who they work for.

423
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:17,760
That's a massive concept.

424
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:22,160
He helped pioneer cloud computing and he developed a company to bring that to developers.

425
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:24,020
And that company is Linode.

426
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:25,480
They've been in this for a long time.

427
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:31,680
You fast forward to today and nearly two decades later, Linode is the largest independent open

428
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:38,640
cloud provider in the world with 11 global data centers serving over 800,000 customers.

429
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:41,360
And I am personally one of them and so is my business.

430
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:43,000
And I couldn't be happier about it.

431
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:47,800
And I couldn't be happier to recommend that you go to linode.com slash coder and receive

432
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:51,640
a $100 60 day credit towards your new account and try it out.

433
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:52,840
I think you'll be really impressed.

434
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:59,080
Linode.com slash coder and a big thank you Linode for sponsoring the Coder Radio program.

435
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:01,600
Have you been following all of this tick tock hoopla?

436
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:06,440
I mean, this is getting crazy now and I got to be honest with you as a social network

437
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:12,640
platform couldn't care less, but as a wider, larger ramifications, it seems like a huge

438
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:13,640
deal.

439
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:17,120
I think all app developers need the government now regulating and throwing your apps out

440
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,120
of the stores too.

441
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:19,120
That sounds like fun.

442
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:20,720
What could go wrong?

443
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:25,780
What I find interesting is the threat is essentially the nature of a social network.

444
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:32,440
Tick tock has a algorithm that shows people things they like and they're concerned about

445
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:36,840
somebody or some government influencing that algorithm.

446
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:37,840
Hello.

447
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:42,600
That is the single threat of every social media platform.

448
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:44,040
Like let's be real.

449
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:46,240
This is also the Facebook and Twitter problem, right?

450
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,920
It's not unique to tick tock.

451
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:52,400
It's just the government is different for the nation that tick tocks from.

452
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:55,400
You have to find the core functionality of all of these apps.

453
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,400
Yes.

454
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,400
Yeah.

455
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:58,400
Track spy you and manipulate you.

456
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,400
Right.

457
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:00,800
Get you to buy shit you don't need and like make you depressed and angry.

458
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:02,840
Like that's that's what they do.

459
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:05,280
So did it get banned though?

460
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:08,880
I guess not.

461
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,280
I think it's not.

462
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:14,780
It's not because it was supposed to happen at midnight on September 20th.

463
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:17,120
And as we record today, it's September 21st.

464
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:22,280
Now, grant you, I'm not following it for the tick tock purposes, but the current news,

465
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:27,160
as I know, is that President Trump has commented on as of Monday and he says he would not approve

466
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:31,320
a tick tock deal unless ByteDance ceded its control.

467
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:33,840
And after that, ByteDance said it would not be doing that.

468
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:38,200
It would retain an 80 percent stake, which is not ceding control, it's ceding 20 percent

469
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,200
control.

470
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:43,560
And then ByteDance asserted it will maintain a majority ownership and control over tick

471
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:50,440
tock global and will not transfer source code or any technology to Oracle and Walmart.

472
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:55,640
But I think right now the U.S. has delayed the tick tock ban by a week to give time for

473
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:57,960
all of this to sort out.

474
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:02,200
But it sounds like it's off to a pretty rocky start just on this first day.

475
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:07,880
I mean, I probably incorrectly find it hard to care about tick tock.

476
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:08,880
I got to be honest with you.

477
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:14,720
You know, it's incredibly popular and, you know, this is where two old dudes that don't

478
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:20,640
like to dance on the Internet maybe aren't the best people to talk about this.

479
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:27,080
But you think maybe maybe on the one hand, like, yes, I kind of can see the argument.

480
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:30,040
But this all just seems kind of like a circus.

481
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:31,040
Right.

482
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:33,040
And zoom out on the ramifications of this.

483
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:37,080
Look at how hostile app stores are at this point to developers.

484
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:42,080
You can have the platform curator that decides you're not worth featuring.

485
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:47,760
You have the potential for governments to step in and say a fundamental service you

486
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:50,040
rely on is going to be removed.

487
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:52,560
I mean, in this case, I'm not so sure.

488
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:56,320
But let's say there were apps that used a tick tock back end or tied in with a tick

489
00:23:56,320 --> 00:24:01,340
tock service, much like how we used to have a whole ecosystem of Twitter clients.

490
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:05,880
If you say back then we're making your living making a Twitter client and some government

491
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:08,400
would come in and just say, no, no more.

492
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,440
All of those developers are wiped out as well.

493
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:11,440
Yeah.

494
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:14,880
And the Twitter client example is perfect because that kind of happened, right?

495
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:15,880
Not the government, but Twitter.

496
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:16,880
Yeah.

497
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:17,880
We don't we don't like this anymore.

498
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:22,520
That's the that's the other angle is then there are commercial interests that are hostile

499
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:25,580
that are also going to screw you in the app store.

500
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:28,120
It's really bad now.

501
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:32,000
And then you combine that with what seems to be Apple's hostile take to it in terms

502
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:37,160
of trying to get revenue for services, getting a cut on store revenue and sales revenue and

503
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:41,720
subscription revenue, but also just the way they dropped iOS 14 is a bit of a bomb on

504
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:42,720
developers.

505
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:43,720
And you're like, here you go.

506
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:44,720
It's done.

507
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:45,720
Now go ship your apps.

508
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:47,320
I mean, I thought it was great personally.

509
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:52,160
Yeah, it probably got you some work because clients had to scramble.

510
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:53,160
That's right.

511
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:56,000
I had to pop open the old iMac and be like, all right, let's do this.

512
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,400
Oh, and I picture you sitting there.

513
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,540
You've got a tasty beverage.

514
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:03,960
You crack the knuckles and you just you just say to yourself, Objective C. Well, no, I

515
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:04,960
plug it in.

516
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:09,200
I update Xcode three times, of course.

517
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,200
Yes.

518
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,200
You have to get current.

519
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,200
Right.

520
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:13,200
Yes, I had to get current.

521
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,200
Yeah.

522
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:17,200
And then I realized that there's tons of deprecations.

523
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:20,280
And yeah, so legacy code.

524
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:22,280
There's nothing like maintenance contracts.

525
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:23,280
Yeah.

526
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:28,760
I mean, that's one thing the Apple ecosystem is usually pretty good for just savagely deprecating

527
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:32,320
things like, OK, sure, because an app should only run for three years.

528
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:33,320
Right, guys?

529
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:34,320
That's OK.

530
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:38,560
It's maybe on the fringe or the edge of developer hostile, but it is slightly developer hostile

531
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:39,760
to operate that way.

532
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:41,840
Oh, no, it's it's it's kidding aside.

533
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:42,840
It's like super bad.

534
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:43,840
Yeah.

535
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:47,740
And what I don't get is they have all these NDAs in place, which, by the way, have you

536
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:51,640
really seen any major leaks of these ARM developer kits?

537
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:52,640
Not really.

538
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,320
I've seen a few.

539
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:59,640
I've seen a couple of things, but not like in a YouTube video, doing a tear down or review

540
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:00,640
or.

541
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:01,640
Oh, they'll sew your pants right off.

542
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:02,640
Right.

543
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:06,040
But that's my point is developers seem to understand that line.

544
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:09,500
And in and collective here, there's a lot of them that probably have them.

545
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:14,260
There could be there could be many thousands of units out there and they all seem to be

546
00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:16,000
mostly playing ball.

547
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,020
So I just don't understand why Apple doesn't trust the developers a little more.

548
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:20,120
They have NDAs in place.

549
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:21,960
They have mechanisms to pursue them.

550
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:25,440
If they break them, it seems like they could have given them a heads up.

551
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:30,120
It ruins the surprise, but it would be great for for developers.

552
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:35,000
I would argue the most personal and important computer in everybody's life, assuming you're

553
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,640
an iOS user.

554
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:37,960
Maybe we don't want surprises.

555
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:38,960
Right.

556
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:41,560
Like I have a completely different view on this.

557
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:45,760
Like I if my phone is not working, I'm like out of business.

558
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:46,760
Right.

559
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:47,760
That's horrible.

560
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:48,760
True.

561
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:49,760
True.

562
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:50,760
I really don't want to be surprised.

563
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:51,760
I want more battery life.

564
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:54,360
I mean, I'll give you just like a side example.

565
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:57,400
The folks at Panic just made a new app called Nova.

566
00:26:57,400 --> 00:27:02,560
It is a Mac native Mac only editor, and it does not have debugging features, which some

567
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:06,520
jackass since he was working on Mac decided to spend an hour trying to figure out how

568
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:08,000
to get it to actually do debugging.

569
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
It does not.

570
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,660
And it's a beautiful app.

571
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:15,440
For those who don't know, Panic is like one of the classic Mac developers.

572
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:18,600
If you were ever into Apple, you probably know who they are.

573
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:21,760
Because they're doing like this, you know, it's 100 bucks and then like an annual subscription

574
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:23,720
when you get updates for forever.

575
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:27,080
And then if you stop the subscription, you just get the version you have.

576
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:28,080
OK.

577
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:30,240
And it works as long as it's compatible with the OS.

578
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:31,240
Yeah.

579
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:32,240
Right.

580
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:37,000
But they immediately got ripped apart by people like on Hacker News coming up with, well,

581
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:40,440
this editor on the Mac App Store is like two dollars or this one's free.

582
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:45,640
It's like, guys, you know, and they're kind of defending themselves.

583
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:49,080
And the whole time I'm thinking, like, this is not an editor that I would use because

584
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:51,440
I don't primarily work on Mac anymore.

585
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:53,760
Even if I did, there are some things I don't like about it.

586
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:57,760
But like, they're just not asking for that much money.

587
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:06,160
And like if if on the Mac you have a problem getting like a hundred dollars out of people,

588
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:09,920
then the whole indie software space and this is something I was going to save for the Coderly

589
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:15,120
report, but just kind of preview here is in a real bad place.

590
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:18,720
Like you and I have commented for years that one of the weird things about moving between

591
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:23,460
Mac and Linux is, you know, you used to look at my dock bar and like all those applications

592
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:24,460
I paid for.

593
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:25,460
Yeah.

594
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:26,460
Right.

595
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:28,640
Whether they were like rogue amoebas, audio stuff or even the simplest app that just

596
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:33,840
tweaks maybe the way applications behave or window lays out, just even small ones to

597
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:36,760
go up in your toolbar and do one function are five dollars.

598
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:37,760
Right.

599
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:38,760
Magnet.

600
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:39,760
Right.

601
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:41,920
Magnet, which is basically gives you tiling like Papa West does.

602
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:42,920
It's like 20 bucks.

603
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:47,200
It's like iStat menu, which gives you stuff that just often comes like it's an extension

604
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:51,080
for gnome shell or it's built into plasma as a plasmoid to get CPU info.

605
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:52,960
But it's iStat menu is like 30 bucks.

606
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:53,960
It does a lot.

607
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:58,080
And it's I guess that's always my disclaimer with these back apps is they always seem like

608
00:28:58,080 --> 00:28:59,920
they do a lot.

609
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:04,960
They do bring some value and they're usually pretty well designed and functional.

610
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:09,480
But they're generally equivalents on Linux, like you're saying, are completely free and

611
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:10,480
just in the repo.

612
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:11,480
Yeah.

613
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:17,760
I mean, the wider point is Apple actively trained even Mac users to now like not want

614
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:18,760
to pay for stuff.

615
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:19,760
Yeah.

616
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:25,840
And just this nonsense now with with Epic, I mean, I think Epic's getting a little wacky

617
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:29,600
with themselves to like some little too theatrical.

618
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:34,000
Did you see this Apple went back to the court because they want to go after Unreal Engine

619
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
anyway?

620
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,000
Yeah.

621
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:40,080
Apple has now characterized this as, quote, one of the most egregious acts of sabotage

622
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:43,760
that Apple has experienced with any developer, end quote.

623
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:47,180
They go on to say this is a direct quote from Apple's filing.

624
00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:52,480
Epic started a fire and poured gasoline on it and now ask this court for emergency assistance

625
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:53,880
in putting it out.

626
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:58,980
Even though Epic can do itself an instant, it can do it itself in an instant by simply

627
00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:02,840
returning to the contractual terms that have profitably governed its relationship with

628
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:06,880
Apple for years.

629
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:10,160
They go on to say Epic is a saboteur, not a martyr.

630
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:12,880
They also follow up and go get your f***ing shine box?

631
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:17,440
I mean, really, it's like, what are you doing?

632
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:19,560
I mean, they're kind of right.

633
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:24,120
The thing where I think Apple does kind of have them dead to rights is they went into

634
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:25,120
that.

635
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:26,960
They they signed that terms of service.

636
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:27,960
Oh, it's premeditated.

637
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:28,960
Right.

638
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:29,960
And this whole thing was like a premeditated.

639
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:35,240
You know, they had the commercial ready, the 1984 spoof, right?

640
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:40,960
But even Google is like aggressively disabling iOS 14 features because of YouTube revenue.

641
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:41,960
Yeah.

642
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:44,880
So, you know, the motivation here with Apple always seems to be, number one, does it make

643
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,180
Apple money?

644
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:48,040
Number two, does it benefit other aspects of Apple?

645
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:49,880
And number three, does it benefit end users?

646
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:51,680
And then number four, does it benefit developers?

647
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:53,680
I think that's their decision tree here.

648
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:54,680
Right.

649
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:55,680
No.

650
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:56,680
Well, and services now, right?

651
00:30:56,680 --> 00:31:00,600
Now services, like, can I get a services revenue is like right up there at number one.

652
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:01,600
Yeah.

653
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:02,600
Number one.

654
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:03,600
Yeah.

655
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:06,000
And it's and I like, can I fry some bacon?

656
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,520
I know it's not on filter, but I'm hungry.

657
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:10,360
I bring bacon with me everywhere I go.

658
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:11,800
Are you kidding me?

659
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:14,840
That seems perfectly rational to me, I have to say.

660
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:17,920
Oh, that's got a smoky hint to it.

661
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:18,920
What is that?

662
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:19,920
Yeah.

663
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:20,920
Yeah.

664
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:21,920
It's Daley's hardwood smoked bacon.

665
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:22,920
It comes in a huge, huge pack.

666
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:23,920
90 percent fat.

667
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:25,640
Well, I think I just felt my arteries clogged.

668
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:33,140
But anyway, so I am not saying they're doing this intentionally, but I think Apple is actually

669
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:37,240
destroying the indie development scene.

670
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:43,880
And I know that's a that's a hottest of hot takes that is a that is a 90 percent fat take.

671
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:47,800
Up until now, the place that if you were a small independent developer, you went to to

672
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:54,560
make money, like selling apps or licensing apps or whatever was was iOS, right?

673
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:57,080
And to a lesser extent, Mac.

674
00:31:57,080 --> 00:32:01,260
And I know people are going to email in like Android success stories, that's fine.

675
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:03,880
Apple has basically made that impossible.

676
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:07,920
Like one side effect that I think is getting a little not enough coverage in the I almost

677
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:12,040
said mainstream media that it's not where I wanted to go with this in the in the larger

678
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:14,900
tech press is.

679
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:19,680
When you break down Apple's revenue, one, the app store is making them a boat ton of

680
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:20,680
money.

681
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:25,080
Like this whole idea that they're just running it to be nice is nonsense.

682
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:28,440
Also that money is mostly from like games.

683
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:29,440
Yeah.

684
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:34,640
Your app, your panics, your rogues, your, you know, name other prolific Mac developers

685
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:35,640
are not the one.

686
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:38,760
And they're all outside of the app store, by the way, the people I mentioned and most

687
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:39,760
of them.

688
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:44,480
In fact, the panic in particular writes about their experiences on iOS and not not so good.

689
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:45,480
So I don't know.

690
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:46,480
Maybe.

691
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:49,640
I mean, again, you'll have to listen to the quarterly report, but maybe there's something

692
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:55,280
here that, you know, when we started this in 2012, it wasn't easy, but it wasn't hard

693
00:32:55,280 --> 00:33:01,720
to like write an app and make a couple hundred bucks, at least now it's hard to make a couple

694
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:02,720
hundred cents.

695
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:03,720
Yeah.

696
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:04,720
Yeah.

697
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:09,360
I I don't know if I see this move as them trying to consolidate down the market.

698
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:14,400
It also could simply be as they become nearly a two trillion dollar company.

699
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:18,240
They have a really hard time conceptualizing the needs of a hundred thousand, two hundred

700
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:19,960
thousand dollar revenue company.

701
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:20,960
Right.

702
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:21,960
They just can't.

703
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:22,960
They just can't.

704
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:28,720
And with that, like this just so far past where they're at now, that they really only

705
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:34,020
know how to negotiate at these larger CEO to CEO terms.

706
00:33:34,020 --> 00:33:40,520
And and apparently Epic just even even a company as large as Epic wasn't big enough to.

707
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:41,520
Well, I guess they tried.

708
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:44,760
Actually, if you look at the emails, it seems like they tried, but it didn't work.

709
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:46,960
I think long term here.

710
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:49,720
You are going to have even if it's not intentional, you're going to have essentially what you're

711
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:51,040
talking about play out.

712
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:54,880
And I think we've been calling this for a while, if you look at this and these I think

713
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:59,440
why we keep coming back to this on the show, if you look at the root of it is this is what

714
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:01,240
we've been foreshadowing for a while.

715
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:03,200
And now we're actually seeing it come to fruition.

716
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:08,840
And the question is, once again, now we find ourselves with the ground shifting underneath

717
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:09,840
us.

718
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:10,920
How do you respond to that?

719
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:15,160
Or actually maybe put more acutely, how do you survive?

720
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:16,960
That's that's going to be a great question.

721
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:20,520
I mean, I I think we should I hate to say keep an eye on it.

722
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:25,800
But I think one, there is some chance that like the EU slaps Apple and like maybe things

723
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:26,800
go back.

724
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:27,800
But I kind of don't think so.

725
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:30,640
I don't think I think the users have been trained that they don't have to pay for stuff.

726
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:36,200
Well, and I think if you're hoping the EU or the US justice system saves you, I said

727
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:38,600
the EU for a reason.

728
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:40,920
I'm counting on Canada.

729
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:41,920
Bring on the Mounties.

730
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:42,920
Oh, yeah.

731
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:43,920
Yeah.

732
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:44,920
Yeah, really?

733
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:45,920
Well, yeah.

734
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:51,120
I mean, it's it's fascinating because they just it's so entrenched and it's so public

735
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:56,600
and it really is going to play out and shift the way software is sold and consumed long

736
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:57,600
term.

737
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:59,720
So it's it has large ramifications.

738
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:03,920
And to be fair to like leadership at Apple, they can't really stop.

739
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:04,920
Right.

740
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:10,520
Like if they have this leverage to make this money and Tim Cook didn't do it, that would

741
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:14,000
be a problem for Tim Cook, right.

742
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,880
And to be honest, if you read the emails that have been released in their hearts, they really

743
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:19,320
believe it is their platform.

744
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:20,320
It is their users.

745
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:21,320
It is their devices.

746
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:22,320
Right.

747
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:23,320
You're you're just kind of here.

748
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:24,320
Yeah.

749
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:25,320
You're a you're a guest in their home.

750
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:26,320
Yeah.

751
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:31,440
Apple's argument is, quote, when Apple first created the iOS app store, rather than recreating

752
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:36,020
the Internet, Apple opted instead to create a safe and trusted place for its iPhone customers

753
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:40,600
to discover and download apps confident they will work seamlessly and securely with one

754
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:42,560
tap of a finger.

755
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:47,440
So that's not saying it's a console, but it's kind of saying it's a console is what they're

756
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:48,440
kind of saying right there.

757
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:49,440
It's it's equivalent.

758
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:51,800
It's more of an Xbox and it is a computer.

759
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:53,560
I don't think I don't buy that.

760
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:57,720
I don't think that holds water, but they're going to try, especially when they position

761
00:35:57,720 --> 00:36:02,640
when they position the iPad as a productivity device and the iPhone is a videography tool.

762
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:07,400
I'm not buying it's a console, but that is their positioning in this case.

763
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:10,120
And of course, that's what their lawyers are going to do is they're going to argue the

764
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:13,840
best case they can for Apple and they're going to use the most extreme and harshest language

765
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:15,200
on both sides.

766
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:16,200
Same with Epic.

767
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:17,820
And we'll be talking about this for eight years.

768
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:19,880
So what other OS could you run, Chris?

769
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:24,040
Yeah, let's talk about let's OK, let's do the thing that people hate.

770
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:27,520
But before we go there, I just you mentioned it.

771
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:28,760
Coder QA dot code.

772
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:32,440
If you want to become a member of this here program, not only do you support the show,

773
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:36,520
but you can get a limited ad free version of the show.

774
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:46,560
And also you do get that Coder Coder quarterly report, Coder quarterly report, which I guess

775
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:48,360
we're doing at the end of this month.

776
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:52,360
I think I think we talked about what we're going to do is is we're going to we're going

777
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:55,440
to record it and then release it and it'll be in the members feed.

778
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:59,800
And the way that will work is I will actually put it in your live feed.

779
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,880
So you just are in your actual RSS feed.

780
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:04,220
So if you're already subscribed, it will be there.

781
00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:08,200
But it will also get uploaded to the members area.

782
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:11,880
So if you just for whatever reason, want to be a member and still prefer to just have

783
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:15,400
the main show feed, you can go to the log in page.

784
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:20,720
You'll be able to log in and just download that one off Coder quarterly report.

785
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:24,320
Otherwise it'll just show up in your feed if you're subscribed to the limited ad feed.

786
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:26,960
So Coder QA dot co for that.

787
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:35,240
Now I am slowly and probably in a way that I think would be really annoying to most people

788
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:40,120
beginning to methodically consider and research a Linux laptop.

789
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:45,640
And the reason why I start now is because I am in no position now to buy a laptop.

790
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:49,240
So it's impossible for me to accidentally stumble across the one I want and buy it today

791
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:52,240
because I literally can't I don't have the funds.

792
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:53,840
I haven't been paid for a couple of months.

793
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:56,000
I mean, it's not happening, right?

794
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:02,440
But if things with the business go right and when it gets close to tax time and I'm late

795
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:06,680
twenty twenty, maybe early twenty twenty one and I'm looking at things, I think if things

796
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:12,440
line up, I'll probably be in a position hopefully this would be a milestone to get a Linux laptop.

797
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:14,340
My previous Linux laptop wasn't mine.

798
00:38:14,340 --> 00:38:16,240
It was owned by a cloud guru.

799
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:21,880
And so I want something at some point to be my go to Linux mobile machine.

800
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:28,880
But I want to measure twice, really, and cut once because I have a couple of requirements.

801
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:35,480
I want something obviously that easily runs Linux with little to zero modification.

802
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:37,560
But this time around, I'd also like to have a 2K screen.

803
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:41,140
I think I'm done with 1080p, but I don't really want to go to 4K.

804
00:38:41,140 --> 00:38:44,060
And from time to time, I want to play a video game.

805
00:38:44,060 --> 00:38:49,340
So I'd like it to have a dedicated GPU, ideally a 14 inch form factor, but I would also consider

806
00:38:49,340 --> 00:38:51,840
a 15 inch form factor.

807
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:54,120
When you add all this up, it's tricky.

808
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:57,320
I was looking at different systems and.

809
00:38:57,320 --> 00:39:02,840
The one that I obviously went to first was the Bonobo, but I don't think I need that

810
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:09,040
much power and I don't think I even need that much graphics because I'm not a frequent gamer

811
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:11,980
and I don't need a 4K screen, I'd like a 2K screen.

812
00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:17,560
So then I thought maybe the Oryx Pro, but they have a 1080p panel in their system or

813
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:18,560
a 4K screen.

814
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:20,880
But also I'm not clear on even what graphics I need at this point.

815
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:23,480
I feel like maybe it's time to consider a full Ryzen system.

816
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:25,380
Maybe it's time to consider an Intel system.

817
00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:30,380
So first on my list is of consider is System 76, just because, you know, been a customer

818
00:39:30,380 --> 00:39:34,340
for over a decade plus now and I like supporting them.

819
00:39:34,340 --> 00:39:39,080
And also before I stopped using the ThinkPad, I wound up using Pop OS on that and found

820
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:40,540
it to be pretty great.

821
00:39:40,540 --> 00:39:44,960
So I'm thinking maybe maybe the next one will probably run Pop OS as well.

822
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:49,100
These are like my current requirements, you know, and then now what I do is I start this

823
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:54,880
like slow information absorption process, kind of like taking in all of the dynamics

824
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:58,560
and possibilities and then kind of whittling it down.

825
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:02,880
And will you remind me, Mike, what your current daily Linux driver is?

826
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:06,480
Yeah, so I'm on right now, actually, I'm on the Lemur Pro from System 76.

827
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:09,920
See, that'd be a great option, too, but no dedicated GPU, right?

828
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:11,560
And it's a 1080 panel.

829
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:14,040
I could possibly live, I'd prefer 2K though.

830
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:16,600
I'd really like, that's really the sweet spot for me.

831
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:17,920
I'm like that.

832
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:21,600
I do prefer 2K, so again, flame war time.

833
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:23,920
I think 4K on Linux is kind of crap.

834
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:25,080
It's still hit and miss a little bit.

835
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:30,400
It's if you've got all GTK 3 apps or all current plasma apps, cute, you know, toolkit stuff,

836
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:31,400
not so bad.

837
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:37,840
But like I have two pretty essential audio programs I use that I don't even know what

838
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:41,040
toolkit they're using, but it is not high DPI.

839
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:43,440
It's like old X 11 stuff.

840
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:44,440
So you brought up a GPU.

841
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:45,440
Uh huh.

842
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:46,440
Yeah.

843
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:50,600
Is this like a desktop replacement here or are we talking, you know, not really because

844
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:55,160
I really, I just want to play video games with the kids and they don't have crazy powerful

845
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:56,280
systems.

846
00:40:56,280 --> 00:41:00,160
So it just, you know, dad wants to have the best, obviously.

847
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:05,400
And I would like to play modern games, but for the most part I'm looking at playing games

848
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:06,720
from a few years ago now.

849
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:07,720
Hmm.

850
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:12,600
So it doesn't have to be a crazy GPU, just a step above what the Intel gives me.

851
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:16,480
This is where, and I'm not going to do it, but this is where like the Mac book really

852
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:19,600
kind of checks all those boxes except for the Linux part and the Linux part is just

853
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:20,940
absolutely essential.

854
00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:22,340
So it's just an on starter.

855
00:41:22,340 --> 00:41:25,960
But you look at the 16 inch Mac book pro or something like that or whatever that come

856
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:29,760
out arm wise, they generally have dedicated GPU, they generally have good battery life,

857
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:33,180
they generally have a good screen, they have now a good keyboard, they have a good size

858
00:41:33,180 --> 00:41:36,300
to weight ratio and they check a lot of the boxes.

859
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:41,600
So I can understand why people buy them, but the price is high a and B it's a non starter

860
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:45,480
without Linux because that's, that's the entire point of this machine.

861
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:50,080
I don't really want to like XMN in the chat room is recommending external eGPU.

862
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:52,000
Yeah, you know what?

863
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,000
That gets weird.

864
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,000
I remember when I did that last year.

865
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,640
Yeah, I, that's what I have been doing.

866
00:41:56,640 --> 00:42:02,560
And frankly the, it's not bad if I'm stationary, but because I'm a dope who chooses to live

867
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:06,400
in an RV, I'm mobile all the time and I'm tearing my setup down constantly.

868
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:09,060
So it's always one more thing I have to move around and set up.

869
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:12,000
But additionally, it's like sometimes the kid and I are just somewhere where we have

870
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:16,040
our laptops, but I didn't bring the eGPU in my bag, I can't really.

871
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:20,600
And it's like, well, I can't play Dylan, I'm sorry, I don't, I don't have a graphics card.

872
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:21,600
It's just weird, right?

873
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:22,600
So I want it built in now.

874
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:25,340
So I'm thinking like there's a couple of viable options, right?

875
00:42:25,340 --> 00:42:28,800
Like system 76 has, I think what was it, the Bonobo you were talking about?

876
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:29,800
Yeah.

877
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:31,840
The Bonobo workstation, they just refreshed that.

878
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:33,560
Didn't somebody just partner with Fedora?

879
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:34,560
Yeah.

880
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:37,800
Lenovo has some think pads like the X1 carbon, but no GPU there.

881
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:40,440
Oh, they don't have a model with a GPU still?

882
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:42,220
There's always the XPS, right?

883
00:42:42,220 --> 00:42:44,760
But like, I think no GPU on the XPS for sure.

884
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:45,760
Right.

885
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:46,760
Yeah.

886
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:47,760
Yeah.

887
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:51,120
And I'm not sure if this, if the 15 is officially, the 15 inch XPS might have a GPU.

888
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:56,520
I would love the, something that's the size of the lemur or the XPS with a GPU in there.

889
00:42:56,520 --> 00:43:01,680
And I know that's just probably not possible with our current technology, but oh man, that'd

890
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:02,680
be the sweet spot.

891
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:05,360
I just want something that has very low bag cost.

892
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:10,200
You know, I toss it in the bag and I can, I can feel it, but it's not like 10 pounds.

893
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:15,280
I mean, I will say my, my one regret in my lemur is that it doesn't have a GPU.

894
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:16,280
Yeah.

895
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:17,720
For games or for other uses?

896
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:18,720
Just for games generally.

897
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:21,680
The thing is Proton's gotten pretty good and steam's pretty good.

898
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:28,020
So it's, there's a lot of options now and it's not something I'll do every week even,

899
00:43:28,020 --> 00:43:33,200
but once or twice a month when I want to do it, if I'm going to be spending over $2,000

900
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:36,280
on a machine, it kind of has to do all the things.

901
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:37,680
That's a big investment for me.

902
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:39,080
How do you feel about Nvidia?

903
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:40,440
I'm okay with Nvidia.

904
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:44,460
I know that it's, you know, Ryzen's all the rage now and the AMD GPU drivers baked in

905
00:43:44,460 --> 00:43:48,880
are pretty simple, but you know, to be honest with you, I've never really had any problem

906
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:50,280
getting the Nvidia drivers going.

907
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:54,840
I think they've got a longterm plan to support Linux and I think they make some pretty good

908
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:55,840
cards.

909
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:56,840
So I'm not really opposed.

910
00:43:56,840 --> 00:43:59,360
I am Ryzen curious though.

911
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:00,360
You're Ryzen curious.

912
00:44:00,360 --> 00:44:03,960
Are you going on the Ryzen message boards, you know, chatting with some people?

913
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:07,880
Well, I've played around, like in my workstation upstairs, cause I have a desktop, you know,

914
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:12,440
I still have Linux machines, I just don't have a Linux laptop and my Linux desktop upstairs,

915
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:15,660
I put an AMD GPU in it and it just works great.

916
00:44:15,660 --> 00:44:18,880
So X and M in the chat is, mentions the new Intel.

917
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:19,880
Yeah.

918
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:22,800
So there's some fancy new Intel chips coming out with integrated graphics and some kind

919
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:24,080
of hybrid GPU mode.

920
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:25,320
I don't know, man.

921
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:28,480
I've been told the, you know, that's been the promise every single release is, oh, well

922
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:32,960
the Intel GPU, this generation really saw some improvements and that's always true,

923
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:36,000
but the other stuff isn't standing still either.

924
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:40,160
I mean, here's the thing, if you're looking for like my input, you know, I have a dream

925
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:42,480
of an all AMD future, right?

926
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:48,320
Like if I could get basically the machine you described, but like Ryzen full stack,

927
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:50,560
I'd be super happy.

928
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:51,560
I don't know.

929
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:53,360
I worry about things like battery life with that.

930
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:54,360
We'll see.

931
00:44:54,360 --> 00:44:56,600
I mean, I've heard good things about the 4,000 series.

932
00:44:56,600 --> 00:44:58,960
You know, I was thinking about this over the weekend.

933
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:00,960
I think I was talking to Joe.

934
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:06,160
I'm not feeling as strongly right now, but over the weekend I started to feel concerned

935
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:12,040
about ARM MacBooks and stealing desktop Linux users again.

936
00:45:12,040 --> 00:45:13,040
You should be.

937
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:18,920
My version of reality is that around the time of Unity and gnome shell relaunching and plasma

938
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:25,240
four to five, we bled tons and tons of developers to the Mac Apple ecosystem.

939
00:45:25,240 --> 00:45:29,960
And it was right around when OS 10 started getting good Mac laptops transitioned to Intel

940
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:31,880
and the iPhone had just kicked off.

941
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:36,920
Like all of these kind of convalesced together and the Linux desktop space was in massive

942
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:37,920
flux.

943
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:44,620
And I watched conferences and just metrics on our own stuff transition from predominantly

944
00:45:44,620 --> 00:45:47,040
Linux to Mac books.

945
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:52,720
And it was a, it was a big, big vacuum for awhile that just sucked up tons of Linux users.

946
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:59,560
And it seems like with their butterfly keyboard, um, the hit and miss nature of recent Mac

947
00:45:59,560 --> 00:46:03,280
OS updates that some of that had been clawed back.

948
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:08,880
Also good offerings from Dell and system 76 and now Lenovo had made Linux development

949
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:12,640
machines attractive once again, and we were seeing it pick back up again.

950
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:17,440
And I think we're seeing a recovery in that user niche for desktop Linux.

951
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:21,760
In my opinion, based on metrics I see across all of our shows based on emails that come

952
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:27,980
in based on experience in the past, it's just my opinion, but I now worry that Apple is

953
00:46:27,980 --> 00:46:34,360
going to crush it with these arm CPUs and they're going to blow the doors off on performance.

954
00:46:34,360 --> 00:46:39,120
And they're going to show people real world workloads that are way faster, that generate

955
00:46:39,120 --> 00:46:42,120
less heat and the battery lasts 15 hours.

956
00:46:42,120 --> 00:46:46,900
And Oh, by the way, the machine has a new form factor, a new screen technology.

957
00:46:46,900 --> 00:46:50,960
It's really kick ass and they're going to just suck all those Linux users right back

958
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:51,960
up.

959
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:55,840
I mean, I think you are probably right if, you know, I mean, there's always the chance

960
00:46:55,840 --> 00:46:59,280
that they screw it up, but they've been working on this transition forever.

961
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:00,280
Yeah.

962
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:04,880
I mean, if you could get a Mac book that is both faster and with like, you know, 50% more

963
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:07,720
battery life than a top of the line XPS let's say.

964
00:47:07,720 --> 00:47:08,720
Yep.

965
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:09,720
Yeah.

966
00:47:09,720 --> 00:47:10,720
That's going to bleed people, right?

967
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:16,520
There's also the ecosystem effect of iOS apps being able to run on these machines.

968
00:47:16,520 --> 00:47:20,680
So the home assistant project, which is one of the fastest growing open source projects

969
00:47:20,680 --> 00:47:29,080
on GitHub and it's an amazing project, recently released a Mac version of their iOS app that

970
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:33,640
has been tuned a little bit for the Mac and now integrates the Mac into home assistant.

971
00:47:33,640 --> 00:47:37,680
So it can monitor when your Mac is actively being used versus when the screensaver is

972
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:41,660
on it can monitor temperature information and feed that back into your home assistant

973
00:47:41,660 --> 00:47:43,240
automation system.

974
00:47:43,240 --> 00:47:49,160
And the reason they were able to flip the switch on that is because of this, this ability

975
00:47:49,160 --> 00:47:51,680
to take iOS apps and deploy them on the Mac.

976
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:52,680
It's not perfect.

977
00:47:52,680 --> 00:47:56,300
It's still in like the alpha beta stage, but they don't have anything like that for Windows

978
00:47:56,300 --> 00:47:57,300
or Linux.

979
00:47:57,300 --> 00:47:58,300
Yeah.

980
00:47:58,300 --> 00:47:59,300
I mean, that's a community problem though, right?

981
00:47:59,300 --> 00:48:00,880
Like it's open source.

982
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:04,960
Someone could develop a Windows version or they could, but I guess my point is when you,

983
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:09,840
you can see how developers are already, even in the open source world, it's not deep into

984
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:11,560
the Apple ecosystem.

985
00:48:11,560 --> 00:48:15,000
That's not deep into every keynote, like just totally drinking the Kool-Aid.

986
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:19,800
Even those types of projects are taking advantage of this ecosystem advantage.

987
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:25,580
So you combine the app availability and deployment possibilities with really good performing

988
00:48:25,580 --> 00:48:26,840
hardware.

989
00:48:26,840 --> 00:48:27,960
I am very concerned.

990
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:32,400
I am very, very concerned about desktop Linux because I think that developer niche is a

991
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:34,120
key user base for Linux.

992
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:35,120
We'll see where it goes.

993
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:39,700
And I think what's interesting is I'm doing this laptop shopping while this is likely

994
00:48:39,700 --> 00:48:40,700
going to drop.

995
00:48:40,700 --> 00:48:46,920
And the rumor has been that we'll see an ARM MacBook before the end of 2020.

996
00:48:46,920 --> 00:48:50,640
So probably before I buy my next machine, we'll see the first one of these drop.

997
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:51,640
Yeah.

998
00:48:51,640 --> 00:48:54,320
I mean, I think your fears are probably well founded, right?

999
00:48:54,320 --> 00:48:59,400
It's, you know, it's always the question of, you know, what is the relationship of desktop

1000
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:01,400
Linux to the wider Linux ecosystem?

1001
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:02,400
Right?

1002
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:03,400
Small.

1003
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:04,400
Small is an understatement.

1004
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:05,400
Right.

1005
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:06,400
Right.

1006
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:08,840
Linux is really, really about, you know, the back end technology.

1007
00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:09,840
Back end.

1008
00:49:09,840 --> 00:49:10,840
Right.

1009
00:49:10,840 --> 00:49:11,840
But it's a passion project for me.

1010
00:49:11,840 --> 00:49:12,840
No, no, I get it.

1011
00:49:12,840 --> 00:49:14,560
I'm not trying to convince you not to get a Linux laptop.

1012
00:49:14,560 --> 00:49:16,880
I'm on a Linux laptop right now, though, right?

1013
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:23,640
So my point is I can't see a lot of like web developers given the choice unless they have

1014
00:49:23,640 --> 00:49:28,480
just like it's like their passion or they like love Linux as a hobby turning down 20

1015
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:29,480
hour battery life.

1016
00:49:29,480 --> 00:49:30,480
Yeah.

1017
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:31,480
And great performance and all of that.

1018
00:49:31,480 --> 00:49:35,440
I mean, I gotta be honest, I would be very tempted by that, you know, when COVID is over

1019
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:37,560
and I have to travel around to get all the time.

1020
00:49:37,560 --> 00:49:41,680
And if they keep these speakers top of the line like they are in the MacBook 16 and they

1021
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:46,580
keep the microphones top of the line like they are in the MacBook 16 and if they improve

1022
00:49:46,580 --> 00:49:51,320
the camera quality by just putting one of their even low end iPhone front facing cameras

1023
00:49:51,320 --> 00:49:55,280
now, they would have a very compelling work machine, especially for people that are doing

1024
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:57,900
the work from home and have to be on Zoom calls all day.

1025
00:49:57,900 --> 00:50:01,880
And I'm not saying that jokingly like that is a huge demographic now.

1026
00:50:01,880 --> 00:50:02,880
They could nail that.

1027
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:06,320
I kind of can't see how they could lose.

1028
00:50:06,320 --> 00:50:07,320
Yeah.

1029
00:50:07,320 --> 00:50:08,320
There's production issues.

1030
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:13,680
Now, I'm a little, I guess, less like this is the apocalypse for desktop Linux than you.

1031
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:18,540
And like, you know, it should be in theory an opportunity, right?

1032
00:50:18,540 --> 00:50:23,880
If Apple trailblazes the path, other vendors who focus on Linux ought to be able to capitalize

1033
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:24,880
on that.

1034
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:25,880
Right.

1035
00:50:25,880 --> 00:50:29,240
And maybe they produce an arm powered system of their own or maybe a risk powered system

1036
00:50:29,240 --> 00:50:31,400
or an open power PC system.

1037
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:35,400
The scary part to me is, you know, Apple is going to keep that that chip super proprietary.

1038
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:39,600
So does Apple have some kind of we're a trillion dollar company magic that no one can hit the

1039
00:50:39,600 --> 00:50:40,880
performance in the battery life?

1040
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:41,880
Yeah.

1041
00:50:41,880 --> 00:50:42,880
I think it's called PI semiconductor.

1042
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:43,880
Hey, guys.

1043
00:50:43,880 --> 00:50:44,880
Yeah.

1044
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:47,720
But like, let me let me put on my Mr. Monopoly hat.

1045
00:50:47,720 --> 00:50:51,080
If Apple makes a better product, they deserve to win, right?

1046
00:50:51,080 --> 00:50:55,880
Like that's if surfaces were good and didn't like light your backpack on fire.

1047
00:50:55,880 --> 00:50:57,040
That is the thing that happened.

1048
00:50:57,040 --> 00:50:59,840
They could look it up, ask Paul Therot.

1049
00:50:59,840 --> 00:51:04,080
Then they would, you know, WSL, I actually think the bigger risk to desktop Linux is

1050
00:51:04,080 --> 00:51:05,080
WSL.

1051
00:51:05,080 --> 00:51:06,080
Yeah.

1052
00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:07,320
Well, that's part of it, too, isn't it?

1053
00:51:07,320 --> 00:51:09,200
Its pressure is coming from a couple of directions.

1054
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:10,200
Yeah, you're right.

1055
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:12,500
I guess my concern is essentially they're going to make a good product, right?

1056
00:51:12,500 --> 00:51:14,640
Which is like what there exists to do.

1057
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:16,720
So I mean, you could have both.

1058
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:22,040
I mean, how many home pods do you have for you need a MacBook, but I haven't bought one

1059
00:51:22,040 --> 00:51:23,040
for a long time.

1060
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:26,320
You know, it's like I've got I'm home pod settled now, Chris.

1061
00:51:26,320 --> 00:51:28,040
No one has bought one for a long time.

1062
00:51:28,040 --> 00:51:29,040
You're right.

1063
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:30,040
You're right.

1064
00:51:30,040 --> 00:51:31,040
That's good.

1065
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:32,040
It's good thinking.

1066
00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:34,360
Now I have to just kind of move forward and I'll start doing the research.

1067
00:51:34,360 --> 00:51:37,920
I would love any suggestions people might have, you know, nothing I'm going to be buying

1068
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:40,280
right away, but something towards the end of the year.

1069
00:51:40,280 --> 00:51:42,720
Let me know at Chris Lass on Twitter.

1070
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:45,880
But speaking of bacon, we have a book recommendation.

1071
00:51:45,880 --> 00:51:46,880
People Powered.

1072
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:47,880
Yeah.

1073
00:51:47,880 --> 00:51:50,880
So I had a Jono Bacon on the M. Dominic show or Mike Dominic show, a show whose name I

1074
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:53,600
keep changing every week because I forget.

1075
00:51:53,600 --> 00:51:57,240
We talked about building communities, communitizing communities.

1076
00:51:57,240 --> 00:51:59,320
And his book, People Powered, is great.

1077
00:51:59,320 --> 00:52:02,840
It's actually given me a lot of insight into why I used to get yelled out on the Ubuntu

1078
00:52:02,840 --> 00:52:03,840
forums all the time.

1079
00:52:03,840 --> 00:52:04,840
Yeah, it's it's a good book.

1080
00:52:04,840 --> 00:52:05,840
I bought it.

1081
00:52:05,840 --> 00:52:09,720
Oh, I almost bought not quite a year ago, but just under just under a year ago, I got

1082
00:52:09,720 --> 00:52:10,720
it.

1083
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:13,120
And I know they're also doing like live reads now.

1084
00:52:13,120 --> 00:52:14,120
Yeah, there's a book club.

1085
00:52:14,120 --> 00:52:15,120
Yeah, there's.

1086
00:52:15,120 --> 00:52:16,120
Yeah, OK.

1087
00:52:16,120 --> 00:52:17,120
Yeah.

1088
00:52:17,120 --> 00:52:18,120
And they're.

1089
00:52:18,120 --> 00:52:19,120
Yeah, it's like live streamed and all of that.

1090
00:52:19,120 --> 00:52:20,120
So check that out.

1091
00:52:20,120 --> 00:52:21,280
We'll have a link to that in the show notes.

1092
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:26,040
And you know, you should toss a link in there to that episode of the M. Dominic show or

1093
00:52:26,040 --> 00:52:29,200
Michael Dominic show or automated, whatever you want.

1094
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:31,180
But the Jar Jar Binks Hour of Power.

1095
00:52:31,180 --> 00:52:33,080
Why didn't you double down on that?

1096
00:52:33,080 --> 00:52:34,800
Because I live in Florida.

1097
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:38,120
The Mickey Mouse ninjas would just come out of the ceiling tile.

1098
00:52:38,120 --> 00:52:39,120
You're right.

1099
00:52:39,120 --> 00:52:40,120
They would just show up at your house.

1100
00:52:40,120 --> 00:52:41,120
Excuse me, sir.

1101
00:52:41,120 --> 00:52:42,120
All right.

1102
00:52:42,120 --> 00:52:46,520
Well, if you think of a toss a link in the show notes, people can hear that, too, because

1103
00:52:46,520 --> 00:52:47,520
that's pretty great.

1104
00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:49,320
And, you know, the great thing about Jono, he's a podcaster.

1105
00:52:49,320 --> 00:52:52,360
So, you know, he's going to have pretty good audio for the interview generally.

1106
00:52:52,360 --> 00:52:53,360
Excellent audio.

1107
00:52:53,360 --> 00:52:54,360
Yeah.

1108
00:52:54,360 --> 00:52:56,100
Also, you can find a cloud guru on social media.

1109
00:52:56,100 --> 00:53:01,060
It's just slash a cloud guru at YouTube dot com, Twitter dot com or Facebook dot com.

1110
00:53:01,060 --> 00:53:05,220
Just a slash a cloud guru and you can find them there.

1111
00:53:05,220 --> 00:53:08,720
Don't forget about our membership, Coder QA dot co.

1112
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:15,300
And that Coder quarterly, damn, I almost got it, will be out soon.

1113
00:53:15,300 --> 00:53:17,640
And we have topics already a brewing for that.

1114
00:53:17,640 --> 00:53:20,720
Mr. Dominic, is there anything you want to plug before we get out of here?

1115
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:22,440
Follow me on Twitter at Dubonucco.

1116
00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:26,880
And if you need any sort of Python development done, I have a teeny bit of bandwidth.

1117
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:27,880
There you go.

1118
00:53:27,880 --> 00:53:28,880
I meant Ruby, not Python.

1119
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:29,880
Sorry.

1120
00:53:29,880 --> 00:53:30,880
All right.

1121
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:31,880
Thanks for joining us on the Twitters.

1122
00:53:31,880 --> 00:53:32,880
Yep.

1123
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:33,880
He'll be in there.

1124
00:53:33,880 --> 00:53:34,880
He'll be solving your problems.

1125
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:36,320
I'm at Chris Lass on the Twitters.

1126
00:53:36,320 --> 00:53:41,360
There's the Coder Radio podcast on there at Coder Radio Show and at Jupiter Signal.

1127
00:53:41,360 --> 00:53:46,120
But links to everything we talked about, the easy way, the easy button, Coder dot show

1128
00:53:46,120 --> 00:53:47,900
slash three eight zero.

1129
00:53:47,900 --> 00:53:48,900
Thanks for joining us.

1130
00:53:48,900 --> 00:54:01,720
We'll be back here next week.
