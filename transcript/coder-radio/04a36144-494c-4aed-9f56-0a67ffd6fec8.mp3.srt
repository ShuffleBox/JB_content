00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,760
This is KOTORadio, episode 410 for April 20th, 2021.

2
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:19,840
Hello one, hello all, welcome in to KOTORadio, Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show taking

3
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:25,280
a pragmatic look at the art and business of software development and the world of technology.

4
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:26,920
This episode is brought to you by Cloud Guru.

6
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:35,600
their sandboxes on their credit card, not yours.

7
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:36,600
Sweet.

9
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:45,480
My name is Chris and picking out his orange iMac, it is our host, Mr. Dominic.

10
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:46,480
Hello Mike.

11
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,360
So say we all.

12
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:50,440
You're really on this BSG thing.

13
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:55,440
Can I tell you, those of you who closely follow me and perhaps former members of my family

14
00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:01,480
on Twitter know that the old Mike has been having a bad time and yeah, Chris just laughs.

15
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:04,480
You found a happy place in BSG, you know, is that what you're telling me?

16
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:08,640
No, I'm in love with the president and I don't mean Sleepy Joe.

17
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:13,280
I mean president Laura, Airlock, Rosalind, right?

18
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,280
President Rosalind.

19
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:15,280
You know what?

20
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,280
I got bad news about Rosalind though, bro.

21
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:20,480
She's got, she's got, well, I don't want to spoil it for you, but you better brace yourself

22
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:21,480
for some bad news.

23
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:22,480
Oh no.

24
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:24,360
Is she a Cylon too?

25
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:26,080
Have you not seen the end of BSG?

26
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:29,920
Yeah, I've seen the end where it's like a huge disappointment.

27
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,520
I'm not sure I would say that.

28
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:35,800
You could describe it as a collapse of a television show in front of our eyes.

29
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:39,680
Somebody let the writers get a little too up their ass about it, but no, absolutely.

30
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:40,680
I completely agree.

31
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:45,000
I think it, I think, I think the ending of BSG is a travesty, especially when you could

32
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,800
remember that it started with that mini series that was so fricking epic.

33
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:55,920
So okay, you know what, f**k Apple, let's just go into BSG today.

34
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:03,840
The core concept of BSG was there are some humans left from 12 colonies, right?

35
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:08,520
We're together so far and there's a magical 13th colony that we're worried about, right?

36
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:10,240
Like we don't know about the 13th colony.

37
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,240
Earth is amazing.

38
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:13,720
We don't know about Earth, right?

39
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:22,520
But my love, and I really hope to be my second wife, Madame President Rosalyn, always has

40
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:25,460
a whiteboard behind her of the remaining survivors.

41
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:29,720
And that number tends to go in the, how can we put this?

42
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:32,840
If you were in the Robin Hood app, that number would be read all the time.

43
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:35,280
It's in a bad direction, for sure.

44
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,280
You know what?

45
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:41,040
They're a little militant and I won't say fascist, but maybe a fash, no, they're straight

46
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,040
up fascist, right?

47
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:43,840
I mean, they are fascist.

48
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,320
Well you're in for a ride, my friend.

49
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,760
You are in for a ride with her.

50
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:52,880
So I got to tell you, I want to have a brief conversation about Gaius Baltar and why he

51
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,960
should be hung by his balls.

52
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:59,640
This is relevant, you know, because people, this is what people are talking about today.

53
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:03,040
This is what people are talking about in 2021.

54
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,600
Mike has discovered the 90s.

55
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:09,120
Hey man, I'm the guy over here watching Seinfeld, so have at it, because at least yours is newer

56
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,120
than mine.

57
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:16,120
So I just find something about a beautiful redhead who's totally willing to kill like

58
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,120
everybody.

59
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,800
I mean, if you haven't seen Battlestar, like.

60
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,400
You should watch Voyager then.

61
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,400
You might like Janeway.

62
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:24,720
I do like Janeway, but Janeway is a little too like girl power there.

63
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,560
Roslin's like, it's not that I'm a girl, I just want to kill everybody.

64
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,560
She's just like die.

65
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:31,220
Janeway is just really motivated by coffee.

66
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:33,580
That's really what, that's, that's, that's the thing about Janeway.

67
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:38,880
She does seem to have some addiction issues, which again, I totally sympathize with.

68
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,400
Well, good news for you.

69
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:44,240
You didn't have to spend money on a Thaleo because nobody wrote in claiming that they're

70
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:47,400
making an independent living with desktop Linux yet.

71
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,960
Yes, I like making bets that I know I'm going to win.

72
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:52,560
Yeah, yeah, you got that one, right?

73
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:56,400
Although I think we both thought the Discord would end up selling to Microsoft and just

74
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:01,520
breaking as we start recording today, Microsoft and Discord have broken off their talks and

75
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:04,400
Discord has announced they're going to go the IPO route.

76
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,400
So that's ended.

77
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,400
I thought that would happen.

78
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,600
I'm going to explain Discord to me.

79
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:12,100
It's slack for, for casual people.

80
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:15,440
It's like, it's like gamified up a little bit slack, a little, little more casual, a

81
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:17,580
little more community and gaming oriented.

82
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:18,580
So no spreadsheets.

83
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:19,580
Yeah.

84
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:24,380
More consumer focused features like Twitch integration and, and other things like Reddit

85
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:26,880
integration right out of the box, that kind of stuff.

86
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:27,880
You know, I like it.

87
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,360
It's just, I don't know.

88
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:33,860
It's just, I'm not a huge fan of yet one more communications platform controlled by one central

89
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:34,860
group of people.

90
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:36,960
So I haven't really gone crazy with it.

91
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:40,480
There is a Jupiter broadcasting discord, but it's kind of on pause while I figure out what

92
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,840
I'm doing with matrix.

93
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:44,020
And why is this better than IRC?

94
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:49,840
The same reason slack is, you know, you get besides just your previews and more rich text

95
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:55,120
chat and emojis and you know, gotta have your animated GIFs, but you got voice chat and

96
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:58,520
video calls and there's other features and there's a good permissions model.

97
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:02,840
And of course getting it spun up and started is super crazy easy to get your own server

98
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:03,840
going.

99
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:04,840
It's like just a couple of clicks.

100
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:10,560
It's like, for example, actually, I know several projects that are just using discord now to,

101
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:16,520
to coordinate their, their project work, like the Ubuntu mate distribution uses discord

102
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:18,800
because it's cheap, you know, it's free for them.

103
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:23,760
I think in most cases and I'm sorry, but mate, Ubuntu, I don't know.

104
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:24,760
Yeah.

105
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:25,760
Yeah.

106
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:26,760
Yeah.

107
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:27,760
I know.

108
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:28,760
Uh, and uh, it works, you know, and the young people love it.

109
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:29,760
That's the other thing.

110
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:32,480
A lot of, not a lot of network effect kids these days, Mike, they love it.

111
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:38,360
I bet they also like, you know, freedom of expression and shiny iPads with liquid.

112
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,360
What is it?

113
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:44,520
Liquid, uh, liquid retina, HDR, XDR, double micro mini led.

114
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:47,080
Craig Federico, you're just making shit up now, aren't you?

115
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,080
They totally are.

116
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:52,520
Uh, so yeah, we are recording on Tuesday this week because we wanted to give you our sort

117
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:56,840
of instant reaction to the apple news and event and find out if either one of us bought

118
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:57,840
anything.

119
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,040
Uh, but before we do, we do have like just a couple of emails.

120
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:03,120
Maybe we'll just do that since, you know, feedback's a huge part of this show.

121
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:07,080
Daniel writes in and he's just kind of throwing down, he says, hit me up, Mike.

122
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:08,080
I've had enough.

123
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:11,000
I'm going to fix your genome shell wallpaper problem.

124
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,800
We had a couple of people write in, they don't know what we're referring to.

125
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:16,960
I guess they, you know, they need to listen to the whole back catalog obviously.

126
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,560
Oh, gather round children.

127
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,440
Wait, hold on.

128
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:21,680
You know what you just did, right?

129
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,560
You just gave me, you just gave me an opportunity there.

130
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,360
Stay a while and listen.

131
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:28,800
Ah, my, my uncle.

132
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:35,120
So, uh, gnomus functional is, uh, for all, you know, intensive purposes, functionally

133
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:40,040
broken because the extensions can crash the entire shell.

134
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,040
That's the problem.

135
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:44,200
You had that happen with an extension that literally was just rotating your background

136
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,200
wallpaper.

137
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,200
But it's just me, right?

138
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:49,520
It's, I mean, thousands of people have had this happen, maybe tens of thousands.

139
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,400
I'm sure tens of thousands.

140
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,860
I think it's gotten better.

141
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:56,680
So some people are not as familiar with the problem as they used to be when you first

142
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:57,680
ran into it.

143
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:04,000
Um, I would say something being about add architecture choices, but I won't, right?

144
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,200
It's architecturally nothing's changed so it can totally still happen, but this problem

145
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,200
still exists.

146
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:12,520
If you have an unstable extension, it will crash your entire shell.

147
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:18,640
That's why the guys over at system 76, the folks over at system 76 are using typescript

148
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:20,600
and rust to build everything they're doing.

149
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,600
Yeah.

150
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,800
They're coming out with their own shell, right?

151
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,320
Isn't it a cosmic cosmic?

152
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,320
Thank you.

153
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,320
Yeah.

154
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,320
That's interesting.

155
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:33,200
I mean, I think, I mean, it's easy to say it on a, on a lame podcast where we only love

156
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:35,280
Apple and we hit all our operating systems.

157
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,280
There you go.

158
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,280
YouTube.

159
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,280
There you go.

160
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:39,640
I gave it to you.

161
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:46,040
But in theory, if you could silo off the extension processes from the actual shell, that would

162
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,360
basically solve the problem.

163
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,360
Yeah.

164
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:51,600
Like even just if it just killed all extensions, but the rest of the shell kept going.

165
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:54,280
Well, you can't kill all extensions though, right?

166
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:59,640
Because most of genome shell is actually extensions.

167
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:00,640
Good point.

168
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:06,160
Think about pop OS, all of pop OS is basically like your solution would be each extension

169
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,160
has its own process.

170
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:09,920
Well, I would actually pose a question.

171
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:14,840
What is the failure case that putting high res images, switching on a monitor, like a

172
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:21,120
five K monitor crashes the extension, which therefore crashes genome shell when pop OS,

173
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:25,960
all of their stuff or not all, but a lot of their stuff right now, I know they're doing

174
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:27,720
cosmic, but right now are basically good.

175
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,080
No extensions.

176
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:30,420
Cosmic will be as well.

177
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:31,880
Cosmic is a series of extensions.

178
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:35,960
It's effectively extensions, but that does not bring down your system.

179
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:40,800
If like moving a window, using their magical keyboard stuff, you know, they're, you know,

180
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:41,800
their title.

181
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:47,480
This is the dichotomy of the free and open source desktop is it all comes down to experience

182
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:49,620
of the developer code quality.

183
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:53,280
You know, they're building things with standards and a certain practice and the style of testing

184
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:57,960
that they're doing in house and not every extension developer is doing anything near

185
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:58,960
that.

186
00:08:58,960 --> 00:08:59,960
Okay.

187
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:03,120
And because of the architecture of the shell, it can become a problem, right?

188
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:06,840
I guess I would be more merciful to the extension developers that the Arctic architecture of

189
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:12,840
the shell makes it very easy to make very stupid mistakes, but yeah, I wish I had a

190
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:15,560
good explanation because it still bothers me as well.

191
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:20,280
So I think they're aware of the problem because I had a conversation with Neil McGovern, who

192
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:27,160
is the executive director of the Gnome Foundation, and they're kind of tackling it in like pieces

193
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:28,160
that they can.

194
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:33,360
So with Gnome 40, they broke off input into its own process now, and that's a big deal

195
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:37,080
because Linux can be a little weird when you got a lot of disk IO going on and then all

196
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:39,180
of a sudden you got some network IO or something.

197
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:43,800
You can get a stuttery mouse or keyboard and they've solved that by breaking that off onto

198
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:44,960
its own process.

199
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:48,240
I asked him about extensions, but I just really couldn't get a firm commitment from him on

200
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,480
it.

201
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:51,640
It just kind of was like, yeah, it's something we need to look into, but we think there's

202
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:52,880
a lot of ways to address that.

203
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,520
Yeah, no, I think it's a hard problem.

204
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:57,360
I mean, honestly, it's technical debt in a lot of ways.

205
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:02,200
Yeah, I was, you know, but Wes made a good point, you know, as he always does, damn it.

206
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,200
A little hippie.

207
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,200
I'm so jeezed.

208
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,680
No, he's always made it just.

209
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:07,680
Wes was right.

210
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,600
If he would write it in Clojure, it would be better.

211
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:16,320
No, he was pointing out that this type of market, like the users of the Linux desktop,

212
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,800
there's an advantage to making it something approachable.

213
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:24,120
You know, when it's JavaScript you're working with and these extensions can change a lot

214
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:29,080
of things, like that is kind of what the demographic of the Linux desktop wants.

215
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:32,640
To them, that flexibility sometimes is a premium feature.

216
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:33,640
Right.

217
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:35,040
So people who like their software not to work.

218
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,040
No, I get that.

219
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:37,040
Well, okay.

220
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,040
All right.

221
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,040
All right.

222
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,040
All right.

223
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:44,360
So Shem wrote in along the topic of JavaScript but on the server, and he wants to make the

224
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:49,920
point to you that essentially boils down to that JavaScript is great on the server if

225
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,760
it's for something you don't care about.

226
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,280
He says, I was listening to 407.

227
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,280
I know.

228
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:55,280
Yeah.

229
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,280
Okay.

230
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:58,880
Well, meth is great for people I don't care about either, but keep going.

231
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:02,200
And so you guys were talking about JavaScript on the server and Mike had his rant about

232
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,200
the child.

233
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,200
I would say reasoned argument like Jordan Peterson.

234
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,200
Let's keep going.

235
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,200
Okay.

236
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,920
So that is at his reasoned argument about JavaScript and TypeScript.

237
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:14,880
While I agree with most of Mike's point about JavaScript and it is pretty terrible on the

238
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:17,400
server, I think you missed one aspect.

239
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:22,000
A lot of people will reach for JavaScript or Python or Ruby because they're dynamic

240
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,640
and you can prototype quickly, which means you can get a working back end up and running

241
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,120
without much fuss.

242
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:30,480
However, we see companies like GitHub.

243
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:34,880
They use these languages and as they scale, they start to buckle as you get to larger

244
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:38,980
code bases and you get tricky and trickier requirements and edge cases.

245
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:42,800
But if you're just building a small site that doesn't need any fancy back end, maybe it

246
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:48,400
won't ever get much traffic, then JavaScript or TypeScript or node or Dino will be fine.

247
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:53,000
But I think too many people pick it without realizing the limitations that you're placing

248
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,400
on yourself with that choice.

249
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:56,560
Thanks for the entertaining chatter.

250
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:57,560
Keep it up.

251
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:58,560
What do you think of that?

252
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:02,040
Like, it's not so bad for prototyping, especially if you're never really going to put it in

253
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:04,080
much of any kind of production.

254
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:06,200
Now now will you allow it?

255
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:10,640
I mean, I guess if I were in the Air Force and I had to really not crash my plane, I

256
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:15,200
might take amphetamines.

257
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,160
But I definitely wouldn't make that as a life choice.

258
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:20,000
Yeah, you don't want to fall asleep and crash the airplane.

259
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,520
We got a lot of different feedback around tooling again.

260
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:25,000
We got some on the subreddit, too.

261
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,400
Some people feel like we like I went too hard on Linux last week.

262
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:29,920
I thought we had a parlor page.

263
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:30,920
Yeah, we need to do that.

264
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:32,760
I don't know how you do that, but they're back, baby.

265
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:34,440
So I guess we better get it started.

266
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:36,760
Maybe you know, maybe it'll go big.

267
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:41,380
And I want to talk about how the topic of Mac and Linux and Windows has come up again

268
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:42,380
in the show a lot.

269
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:47,360
And it seems to kind of be a reoccurring theme and something to keep in mind on this show,

270
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,360
specifically this one.

271
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:50,020
Really, this is going to be a big one.

272
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:51,100
It's not Linux radio.

273
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:52,380
It is Coder radio.

274
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:57,120
And the tooling that we use to do the work has always been a big part of the conversation

275
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,360
on the show.

276
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,560
And you know, it's going through a lot of changes right now.

277
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:03,480
We've got a lot happening with Gnome Shell, like we just touched on.

278
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:09,020
Obviously, the M1 platform and Apple's tooling around that is shaking things up a lot there.

279
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:12,500
And then you have Windows making big investments in WSL.

280
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,840
And then there's the whole hardware side of things, right?

281
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:18,500
As far as like laptops and desktops and monitors and keyboards, like it's just kind of been

282
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:19,800
a thing again.

283
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:23,520
And a lot of that conversation is being driven by the feedback that we get into the show

284
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:26,600
at coder.show slash contact.

285
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:30,180
We really do appreciate everybody giving us their feedback on their take on all of this.

286
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:34,080
But to be clear, and I think I'm pretty confident in speaking for you on this one, Mike.

287
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:36,200
But correct me if I'm wrong.

288
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:40,500
We don't care what OS you use or what computer you use.

289
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:41,500
I care.

290
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:42,500
You should all use Snow Leopard.

291
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:43,500
Okay.

292
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:44,500
Well, there's that.

293
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:45,640
We just want you to get your work done.

294
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:47,560
You know, wear a robe and get your work done.

295
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:48,560
That's all we care about.

296
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:49,560
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

297
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:50,560
Whoa.

298
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:51,560
Okay.

299
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:52,560
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

300
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,800
What was that last bit there?

301
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:55,800
Just something about a robe.

302
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,920
You know, I'm just saying.

303
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:58,920
Where is my robe?

304
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:03,200
It's probably not going to be until like the 11th or 12th that you're going to probably

305
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,200
start seeing it.

306
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,200
Uh-huh.

307
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:07,840
See, you opened the robe door, but now the door is open.

308
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:13,160
So when is the Coder Radio Limited Edition Totally Objective-C Developer Rope coming

309
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:14,160
out?

310
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,720
Oh, perhaps a special edition.

311
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,280
We should collab on this.

312
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:23,600
Yeah, you know what happened was as we were sorting out international stuffs, we totally

313
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:26,560
missed the window of manufacturing.

314
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:30,560
And I had to go with, of course, like a super fancy black one and all that.

315
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,560
And you understand what you did wrong, right?

316
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:35,280
You didn't listen to Madam Victoria Newman.

317
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:36,280
Yep.

318
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:37,280
Her wisdom.

319
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:38,280
Come on, give it to me.

320
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:39,280
Give me the unfiltered soundbite.

321
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:40,280
I don't know.

322
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:41,280
Can I play that on the show?

323
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:42,280
You know what I'm saying?

324
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:43,280
Yeah, do it.

325
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:44,280
Do it.

326
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:45,280
Do it.

327
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:46,280
I don't even know if I have it anymore.

328
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:47,280
Hold on.

329
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:48,280
I got to check.

330
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:51,920
I might have gotten rid of it because, you know, it has a swear word in it.

331
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:52,920
Oh, my God.

332
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:54,520
Nasty words on Coder Radio.

333
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:55,520
That's never happened before.

334
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:56,520
We've never gotten caught.

335
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:57,520
There's a swear word in it.

336
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:58,520
Let's see.

337
00:14:58,520 --> 00:14:59,520
What kind do I have in here?

338
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:00,520
I bet you I could find it pretty quick.

339
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:01,800
Actually, you know what I should do?

340
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:06,200
I should put this on our soundboard because it's come up twice now.

341
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:08,360
Because my deep seated hatred for the EU just.

342
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,360
All right.

343
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,360
Here you go.

344
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:11,360
This wasn't.

345
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,360
I wasn't going to do it.

346
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:13,360
But this is for you.

347
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,360
F*** the EU.

348
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:15,360
And you know what?

349
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,360
F*** them good.

350
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:17,640
That's all I can say.

351
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:22,400
Now, my thoughts are that, you know, whatever works for you, whatever machine that you can

352
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,220
get the job done with, that's fine.

353
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:26,600
Whatever gets you in your groove, good on you.

354
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:31,040
Alex wrote in, he said, gentlemen, I've been listening to the show for years and I've also

355
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:35,640
been using Linux and various distributions as my primary desktop for 11 years.

356
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:37,640
I don't really ever have the intention of getting a Mac.

357
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:39,200
Doesn't really matter how fast they get.

358
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:44,300
The one time I had used it for work and I had to build an iOS app, I found the ability,

359
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:47,780
the inability to control the operating system frustrating.

360
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:48,780
It's not about features.

361
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:51,840
It's about how Apple treats and disrespects its users.

362
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:54,360
That's the entire point of Linux and open source software.

363
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:57,320
Frankly, I just wrote all that because I'm tired of hearing about the topic while I'm

364
00:15:57,320 --> 00:16:00,280
over here just getting my work done on my Linux device.

365
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:05,840
It's weird because by writing into the show about the topic, you have therefore precipitated

366
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:06,920
this talk.

367
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:07,920
The topic.

368
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:11,840
Yeah, I do find myself, I go through cycles where I obsess a little bit about my tooling

369
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:15,080
and then I go for a year or two and I don't think about it very much and then I obsess

370
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:17,880
again very much about my tooling.

371
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:23,240
When I, my heart started pounding during the Apple event when they got to the Mac section

372
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:26,620
because I was really, all right, you know what?

373
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:33,240
I'll tell you what, we'll save that first, linode.com slash coder.

374
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:37,600
Go there to get a $100 60 day credit towards a new account and of course you support the

375
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,600
show.

376
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:40,280
That's linode.com slash coder.

377
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:42,680
I host it all on Linode.

378
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:46,680
I just spun up a new mail server, Wes and I, I mean, let's be honest, it was Wes and

379
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:47,680
I.

380
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:48,680
It was a new server.

381
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:49,680
I hated it.

382
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:55,120
And then I reflashed the existing Linode from Ubuntu 1804 to CentOS Stream 8 and what was

383
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:59,360
fantastic about it is I was able to keep the same IP address and all of that stuff.

384
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:03,520
So all of the MX records and DNS that we had set up didn't have to be redone.

385
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:06,840
I just wiped it and put a new OS on there from one of their images.

386
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:10,760
They have all the distros you could possibly want and I wanted to try out CentOS Stream

387
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:15,280
because I think it's actually going to be a pretty good server distro, but they also

388
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:19,280
work with Kubernetes and Terraform if you want to do infrastructure by code.

389
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:23,040
They have S3 compatible object storage, which is fantastic.

390
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:27,040
When you wrap your head around the use cases of storage in the cloud that doesn't have

391
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:32,280
to have a server standing in front of it that you can make public or private, oh man, it's

392
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:33,280
a game changer.

393
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:36,660
It's a game changer for just like config backups, it's a game changer for distributing files

394
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:40,260
to clients, it's a game changer for static websites.

395
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:44,520
That's definitely one of the best use cases is you can have a site up and going and available

396
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:51,040
using Linode object storage with just a little HTML and CSS and it's crazy snappy fast.

397
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:54,880
It's a great way to do like a resume or a list of something or build your own custom

398
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:55,880
homepage.

399
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:59,680
There's so many different ways to use Linode too because they have like $5 a month rigs,

400
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:04,680
they've got custom CPU rigs that are super fast with AMD EPYC processors, and of course

401
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:08,280
they have plans that'll just mix and match all of that as you need it.

402
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:12,360
They have one-click application deployments, they have tons of great documentation, 11

403
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:13,360
data centers around the world.

404
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:17,680
I mean, I could go on and on about the reasons why I love using Linode, not to mention they're

405
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:22,320
an independent company that is dedicated to offering the best virtualized cloud computing.

406
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:25,360
Essentially, if it runs on Linux, it's gonna run on Linode.

407
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:30,200
Go deploy for test or production and really try out all the different features with that

408
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,200
$100 credit.

409
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,240
You can really try it out.

410
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:36,200
So go to linode.com slash coder, you go there, that lets them know, hey, I heard about it

411
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,340
on Coder Radio.

412
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:40,780
You go there just to say thanks for supporting the show and check out their services.

413
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:43,160
That's a great way to keep the Coder Radio program going.

414
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:48,520
Go to linode.com slash coder, get that $100 60-day credit for your new account and you

415
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:53,400
support the show, linode.com slash coder.

416
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:58,360
So did you have the opportunity to watch this Apple event today, the spring event, spring

417
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:00,720
into spring or whatever it was?

418
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,640
I did watch parts of it.

419
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:11,420
I did have to disappear for a bit, but I have to tell you that a purple iMac is not something

420
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:13,080
I would turn down.

421
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:17,320
So I question the screen size, but all right, let's get to this.

422
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:18,840
So I streamed it.

423
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:25,400
I got here this morning early and essentially I've been essentially making content since

424
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:28,560
8.30 AM and it's 6 PM right now.

425
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:32,720
So we did a little hangout and watched it and I recorded that on jupiter.tube.

426
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,080
We'll have a link in the show notes.

427
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,400
It starts about 24 minutes in.

428
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:41,040
If you'd like to watch it with our reactions, super quick rundown for those of you who can't

429
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:44,920
be bothered to watch it, don't really care, but would like to be informed for the sake

430
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:45,920
of conversation.

431
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:48,560
So the people with lives, yes.

432
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:52,320
Apple finally launched AirTags, their Bluetooth locator for items.

433
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:56,400
They also announced a purple version of the iPhone 12, not a new iPhone, but just a new

434
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,400
color.

435
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,400
Oh, there's a purple iPhone.

436
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,400
Hang on.

437
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,400
I gotta go.

438
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,400
It looks good too.

439
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,400
There's a paid service for podcasts.

440
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:08,800
There is a new 4k Apple TV with a much improved Siri remote, which is compatible with previous

441
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:13,720
Apple TVs and the big ticket, two big ticket items really, but the first big ticket item

442
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:20,240
is the redesigned iMac with an M1 chip and the new iPad Pro with an M1 chip.

443
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,560
So let's just break some of this down.

444
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:25,000
I have the least to say about the podcast subs because it's the least that I know about

445
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
right now.

446
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,600
I actually wanted to talk to you about that.

447
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:28,960
That was the one that really got me.

448
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:29,960
Well, let's do it.

449
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:32,000
But no, if you have no comments on it, then you're good.

450
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,560
I mean, I just have to look into it.

451
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:34,800
So here's what I do know.

452
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:37,280
It's that 15 to 30% cut ratio.

453
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:41,220
So for the first year, Apple takes 30%, then it's 15% after that.

454
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:47,120
They won't require creators to exclusively publish for Apple, but they want you to make

455
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:51,560
some distinguishing features and you do have to use their tools to publish the member only

456
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:52,560
item.

457
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:53,560
Okay.

458
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:55,320
So they're commoditizing their compliments again, right?

459
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:58,200
You'll have to use their app and they're going to have a new way to promote podcasts.

460
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:02,160
All of that leaves me a little concerned, but it doesn't concern me nearly as much as

461
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,960
Spotify does at this point.

462
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:04,960
Really?

463
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:07,120
So I thought you'd be here on fire about this one.

464
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:11,520
I don't love it, but it looks by all intents and purposes, like if it was something the

465
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,040
audience wanted, I would do.

466
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:17,040
I don't necessarily think that's going to be the case with the J.B. audience, even though

467
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:20,680
even though I'd say about 25% of our listeners are using Apple podcasts.

468
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:25,240
Well, no, I just say in general for like the podcasting market, like I thought this would

469
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:27,960
be something that you would find just bad.

470
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:33,840
Well, I mean, Spotify, I mean, what they're doing, I mean, I've always found confusing.

471
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:39,040
It's kind of weird, but this seems like Apple being like, it's better on an iPhone, right?

472
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:40,200
I don't know.

473
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,200
Yeah, that is true.

474
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,200
It would limit it to iPhone users.

475
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:46,680
If I were doing an Apple podcast, I could see it.

476
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:47,880
Maybe boiler alert.

477
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:50,280
I guarantee ATP is going to do all of this.

478
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:51,280
You think so?

479
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:52,280
Yeah.

480
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:55,680
Why not throw shade at rich millionaires who got lucky because Yahoo is dumb and buys things

481
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:56,680
they shouldn't.

482
00:21:56,680 --> 00:22:01,540
If your audience was really heavy, like if we had a 60% audience using Apple podcasts,

483
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:03,840
it might be worth considering.

484
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,440
I think there's a lot of overhead though.

485
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:08,180
If you want to be featured, there's a lot of there, like you got to do the special kind

486
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:09,800
of artwork and stuff like that.

487
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:12,480
But isn't that like part of being in the Apple ecosystem?

488
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,480
Yeah, definitely.

489
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:14,480
Like really?

490
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:15,480
Yeah.

491
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:16,480
It's the same for apps.

492
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:17,480
Yep.

493
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:18,480
Absolutely.

494
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:19,480
Yeah.

495
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:23,120
This feels like the application of podcasts and soundboard that drew you soundboard that

496
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:24,240
because you're going to need it.

497
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:25,320
Oh my God.

498
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:30,160
I will keep an eye out on that one in particular and I'm so I'm sort of reserving judgment

499
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:32,240
until further review.

500
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:36,960
I think the thing that I do like seeing initially is that they're not forcing the content to

501
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:39,160
be exclusive to Apple.

502
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:42,400
That seems encouraging because you could take that same content and make it available.

503
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,160
How we make it available to current members.

504
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:46,520
Again, it's IE6 though.

505
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:51,800
If there are things that don't work, if you're not an Apple, then I don't know.

506
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:55,100
I feel like we're always playing the same songs here and maybe it's because we're old

507
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:56,680
and sad and whatever.

508
00:22:56,680 --> 00:23:00,560
But this is what you get when they turn to a services company is a is a gradual expansion

509
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:01,840
of what they can monetize.

510
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:07,900
I am the Apple fanboy on this network, which geez, you guys could have done a lot better

511
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:13,040
in terms of like actual fanboys of Apple, but like they make beautiful hardware, which

512
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:17,480
they deprecate mercilessly with the M1 chip after you spend five thousand.

513
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:21,140
I'm sorry, I get upset.

514
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:22,140
It's true.

515
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:23,880
But they do make beautiful hardware.

516
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:27,000
Honestly, I'm staring at my iMac Pro.

517
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:31,100
I won't say with hatred, but let's just say the disappointment of a mother who is visiting

518
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:34,760
her son in prison because he was convicted of rape.

519
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:38,080
It's pathetic that my MacBook Air can run circles around this machine.

520
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:41,520
But again, I mean, I forgot what I was talking about.

521
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,320
I just want to smash this thing in the floor.

522
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:47,680
Yeah, your MacBook Air doesn't have fans.

523
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:48,680
That's even better.

524
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:53,880
You're just like, oh, and I sometimes forget to charge it for two or three days and it's

525
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:55,160
just like fine.

526
00:23:55,160 --> 00:24:00,160
OK, so we probably don't have much to talk about the Apple TV 4K.

527
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:01,640
They added the H12 CPU.

528
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:03,480
So yeah, underpowered still for games.

529
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:04,840
It's kind of disappointing.

530
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:08,080
If anybody is playing games on Apple TV, they need psychiatric help.

531
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:10,240
I want to talk to you about purple iMacs.

532
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,280
OK, I want one.

533
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:18,080
So no, no, no, no qualms about the lack of M1X or anything, huh?

534
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:19,080
It's purple.

535
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:20,080
Yeah.

536
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:21,080
Yeah.

537
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:22,080
Yeah, that's true.

538
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:24,360
I mean, this piece of shit here is space gray.

539
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:26,680
Why would it by the way, why would anything be space gray?

540
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:27,680
Why don't just call it gray?

541
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:30,240
They didn't do any space gray because they're not.

542
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:32,120
None of these are, quote unquote, professional machines.

543
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:35,920
They're saving the space gray for the professional machine now because they know it's a piece

544
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:37,360
of garbage.

545
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:39,760
Anything that space grain and I'm like, yeah, I'm talking to use the ons.

546
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:40,760
You suck.

547
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:43,920
They're still selling the Intel, a couple of the Intel iMacs, and one of them still

548
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:47,160
has a spinning rest hard drive in it for the fusion drive.

549
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:48,320
I'm obviously joking.

550
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,560
The iMac Pro is a great machine.

551
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:53,840
I can probably use this for a year or two until I spill something, some liquid that's

552
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:55,840
definitely not alcoholic into it.

553
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:56,840
Right.

554
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:59,560
My lawyer would be very pleased with that statement.

555
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:05,480
What I will say is the fact that they're selling thousand dollar machines with spinning this.

556
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:08,160
I mean, it's just embarrassing to be clear.

557
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:09,400
It's not the M1 machines.

558
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:10,840
It's the old Intel machines.

559
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:11,840
But yeah, I agree.

560
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:12,840
I know.

561
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:13,840
But like, come on.

562
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:17,880
Honestly, I think it's pretty pathetic that these new iMacs are coming with a base eight

563
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:19,400
gigs of RAM.

564
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:23,000
And nowhere on their website does it say how much RAM these iMacs will take.

565
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:28,920
So before the show, I called up an Apple sales engineer and got quotes for the show that

566
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:36,520
they will offer an eight core with 16 gigs of RAM, up to 16 gigs of RAM max, 16 gigs,

567
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:38,920
two terabytes of storage, 16 gigs of RAM max.

568
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:40,060
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

569
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:42,160
These new iMacs max out at 16?

570
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:43,440
You got it.

571
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:46,440
Same limitations that the Mini and the Air have and the Mac.

572
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:53,520
OK, so long time ago and long time ago and months ago, we were talking about the M1 limitations

573
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:57,360
and one of them was the RAM limitation of 16, right?

574
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:58,360
Yep.

575
00:25:58,360 --> 00:25:59,360
Do we really think they're struggling?

576
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:03,040
I mean, I feel like that's a limitation they could have overcome.

577
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:06,800
But I don't want to say I'm Mac Pro.

578
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:07,800
I'm sorry.

579
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:10,240
You have 32 gigs of RAM like a true computer.

580
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:15,960
I was checking on one of my systems today and I looked and I was using 20, 22, 24 gigs

581
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:20,800
of my 32 gigs of RAM and I was like, oh, oh, no, I have a spreadsheet that.

582
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:27,740
So by the way, if you work at Microsoft and you're an Excel programmer on the Mac team,

583
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:31,800
you need to think about what you've done to my computer.

584
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:37,320
You sit down, pour yourself a drink and just say, is this what I don't know why running

585
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:40,920
my payroll tax calculations like maxes out my CPUs?

586
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:44,600
Yeah, I don't have that many people anymore.

587
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:45,880
I'm a starving artist.

588
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:49,880
I'm like Da Vinci, except I'm not, you know, old.

589
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:51,760
What, you got a vape pen there?

590
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:53,800
I think you're nuts.

591
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:56,240
Chris, go fork yourself.

592
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:57,440
All right.

593
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:00,720
So listen, 16 gigs is it's just not enough.

594
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:01,880
And but here's the other thing.

595
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:04,560
I know it's silly to say it, but because they didn't make a space gray one, this is how

596
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:05,560
Apple works.

597
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:07,260
That means this isn't for the professionals.

598
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:11,360
They're going to replace the 27 inch probably at WWDC or in September.

599
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:12,960
You know what this is for?

600
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,200
I'll be a jerk.

601
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:18,300
This is for the digital agency where we're hip and we're branding and you buy the one

602
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:21,360
that matches the colors of your branding for the receptionist.

603
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:22,800
Or it's the family computer.

604
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:25,560
You know, there's some families that still have one computer that they all share that

605
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:26,560
it could be that.

606
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:27,560
Yeah.

607
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:29,140
My son has a Thalia just saying, but keep going.

608
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:34,160
Did you notice how heavy they went on advertising features like continuity and handoff that

609
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:35,400
have been around for years?

610
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:40,120
I mean, I often sell things I built years ago as new features, but I need money.

611
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:45,600
I think Apple has clearly identified iPhone users that have Windows machines as the target

612
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:46,840
for these IMAX.

613
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:49,640
That is 100 percent who these IMAX are for.

614
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:54,160
And when you go on the IMAX product page today, the bottom half, the whole deal, the rest

615
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:58,240
of half of the page is really about handoff features and stuff that's been in Mac OS and

616
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:59,520
iOS for many, many years.

617
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,560
What do you think of the new keyboard?

618
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:03,760
I like that they put the fingerprint reader in there.

619
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:05,240
It better be comfortable to type on.

620
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:09,360
If they may if they've made another lemon keyboard, that's just going to be an unforgivable.

621
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:11,880
Well, I think it's going to be the magic keyboard, right?

622
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:13,420
It's got to be a facelift.

623
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:16,520
Have you ever done any purchases on the computer with Apple Pay?

624
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:22,040
I've done many, many, many inebriated purchases with Apple Pay.

625
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:24,200
It's a way, way quicker system.

626
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:25,520
I like it a lot.

627
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:29,520
I'll sometimes if I'm in the middle of buying something and I'm on the Mac, which when did

628
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:30,520
this just recently happen?

629
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:31,520
This scenario.

630
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:32,520
Oh, oh, yeah.

631
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:37,120
I mean, I decided I'd subscribe to Ben Thompson's Dither podcast and I stopped what I was doing

632
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:42,400
and I went over to the Mac and opened up and opened up Safari and did the transaction in

633
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:46,120
Safari just so that way I could use Apple Pay because it's so much quicker.

634
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:47,120
It's so convenient.

635
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:50,160
It's stupid because it takes care of like all the shipping info, all the name.

636
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:53,640
You have to fill out all the damn fields and all the payment information.

637
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:55,760
It just does all of it for you.

638
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:57,000
It's really slick.

639
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:01,760
And so having that stuff built in, having the user switching based on your fingerprint

640
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:05,880
is a slick feature and again, makes it great for the family machine, too.

641
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:06,880
Okay.

642
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:09,440
Yeah, I mean, I'm not buying one.

643
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:11,320
Well, then my cast was.

644
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:17,000
I thought to myself, if Apple does something with the Mac in this episode, that's an iMac,

645
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:20,940
I might end up getting one because I have been thinking about just setting up a workstation

646
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:23,860
here at the studio and that would be perfect.

647
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:27,440
But I'm not going to do a machine that can only do 16 gigs of RAM.

648
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:31,600
So because this is an Apple show today, right?

649
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:35,040
Am I the only one who likes the new AirPods Max?

650
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:36,200
Do you have a pair?

651
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:39,720
No, I'm using whatever weird German headphones who gave me.

652
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:42,680
But if I had the money to burn, I'd certainly try them.

653
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:43,680
I used to have money.

654
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:45,840
Oh, wait, this is going in that direction.

655
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:54,080
One of the things that I have found as a dad who has some ADD that sometimes, sometimes,

656
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:57,640
you know, it's like ADD gets this fun, cute wrap.

657
00:29:57,640 --> 00:30:03,040
But one of the negative sides of people who actually have something, some sort of attention

658
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:08,680
deficit disorder is it also means sometimes you lose governance over your own thoughts.

659
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:12,400
You lose governance over what's on your mind and what you're paying attention to.

660
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:17,160
And when you have a noisy household, it sometimes robs you of your ability to even think of

661
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:22,320
a notion or a concept for a few minutes and it gets frustrating and it gets, it gets mentally

662
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:29,040
tiring as your brain is constantly trying to grasp on to something and it creates a

663
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:32,960
frustration and a grumpiness and it creates a tiredness.

664
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:37,080
And what I have found is that, and this is really pronounced for me because I have three

665
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:43,540
kids and I, like an animal, have chosen to live in a very tiny space.

666
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:50,640
And so sound isolating headphones have been a game changer for me where I can put something

667
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:56,660
on and even if I can just bring the volume down 80%, it's like regaining a little bit

668
00:30:56,660 --> 00:30:58,400
of my sanity.

669
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:02,120
If I, I'm still waiting for like reviews and I've heard they have good sound isolation,

670
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:06,400
but I can't really get a feel for how they do with like human voice and, and people noise.

671
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:11,600
But it's just outside my price range for something like that because I have, I have ones that

672
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:16,000
work well enough now, but if they were superior in that regard, I'd be pretty tempted.

673
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:21,060
So I'm in this weird place where I live, like my main problem in life is that zoom is hell

674
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:24,480
and should be outlawed by the Geneva convention.

675
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:25,680
I'm sorry, I just had a flashback.

676
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:26,680
What was I saying?

677
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:30,960
You're thinking you could use this as like a reliable set of zoom headphones that aren't

678
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:31,960
gamer edition.

679
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:32,960
Right.

680
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:35,880
That are always paired to my Mac and I can just pick them up and be like, okay, what

681
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:36,880
is your complaint?

682
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:37,880
Right.

683
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:41,600
But don't you think the little ear air pod ones would probably be better for that job?

684
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:42,600
Well that's the problem.

685
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:47,000
The AirPods have actually, like I have the old, old, old AirPods, the original versions.

686
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Yeah.

687
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,000
And you know what?

688
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,000
They're overpriced.

689
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,440
The sound quality is not great.

690
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:52,440
Yeah.

691
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:53,440
But you know what?

692
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:54,440
God damn it.

693
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:55,440
They've been doing the job for years.

694
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:56,440
Yeah.

695
00:31:56,440 --> 00:32:00,080
I have definitely had the problem where I've run them down when I've had a lot of meetings

696
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:04,240
in one day and then I'm doing this game where like I'm popping one in the case for a little

697
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:06,120
bit and I'm like swapping them back and forth.

698
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:07,120
Yeah.

699
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:08,560
I've had, yeah, I've had that after a while.

700
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:09,560
To me, they're like adium.

701
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:15,360
You know, they've got some troubles, but you know, we should apologize to the Coderadio

702
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:16,840
kids.

703
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:22,160
There is a decade plus of backstory here on just everything we're talking about.

704
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:23,160
That's true.

705
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:26,600
Also, is it me or the new iMacs look like next products?

706
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:28,800
There's a surprising lack of branding on the front too.

707
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:33,040
When I saw them, they looked like those, no, but design, they looked like those computers

708
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:36,960
you see on TV where they tape over the logo and it's just generic computer.

709
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:41,360
You know, it's like a Mac under there, but they've taped over the Apple logo, you know,

710
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:44,760
that's what they look like and they really don't have much less chin than your iMac

711
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:45,760
pro does today.

712
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:50,880
No, it looks very, I'm sorry, but it looks very nineties Apple slash next.

713
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:54,040
I think what's going to sell some of these though for some people is I think these are

714
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:55,040
fanless.

715
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:56,040
I'm not positive.

716
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:58,320
They might not be, they might be a small fan in there, but I bet you they're very quiet.

717
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:04,400
One though, if I ran a company, let's call it blue ocean or let's say green, green grass

718
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:13,560
or pink, nevermind, let's just move on, silver, silver surfer, yellow, silver fox.

719
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:14,560
Come on.

720
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:15,560
I know you, that's what you ought to call it.

721
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:20,680
Let me tell you some, if you want to have a special about cougars, I'm ready and able

722
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:23,640
and I'm, you're going to get a little gray, you know, in there, you're going to all of

723
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:27,160
a sudden you're just starting to look all dignified and no, no, no, you don't understand.

724
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:32,960
And I, listen, I'm in my thirties and I have been undercover doing this operation for you.

725
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:35,120
Yeah, and I can report back.

726
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:36,760
This might be an unfiltered episode though.

727
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:37,760
Yeah.

728
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:39,760
Are you sharing like some breaking news with us?

729
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:43,520
This is CNN breaking news.

730
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:44,520
Yes.

731
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:45,520
Code radio listeners.

732
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:49,280
And I do apologize to the angry dads and moms who email us.

733
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:51,360
Mike does love women 10 years older than him.

734
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:57,360
So at least if you are not 44, this is, this is the episode where we really learned that

735
00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:00,720
Mike definitely has a thing for president president Roslyn for sure.

736
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:06,680
I can't explain, you know what, Jar Jar, Jar Jar, my man, you're great.

737
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:09,520
You sort of suck cause you're incompetent.

738
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:11,120
Madam president.

739
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:12,120
I love you.

740
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:14,000
You better brace yourself for some heartbreak, my friend.

741
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,360
I just saying you got some, you got some VSG to watch.

742
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:17,360
I'm only halfway through.

743
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:18,360
Why?

744
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:19,360
No, she's got to win.

745
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:20,360
Oh yeah.

746
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:21,360
I don't.

747
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:24,260
Beltar is like, Oh, I'm going to be president because I'm Beltar and I'm an asshole.

748
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:26,160
He is such a jerk.

749
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:27,720
I just want to choke that guy.

750
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:30,040
Like I just, and I don't want to do it like quickly.

751
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:32,160
I just want to watch him suffer.

752
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:33,160
We should move on.

753
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:38,320
So what are the odds on you buying one of these IMAX zero, zero, zero.

754
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:42,040
I run VMs all day, every day, but you're, you're making it work with the eye with that

755
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:46,360
there air air, which has doubled the memory of one of these IMAX.

756
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:47,360
Your pro does.

757
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:48,360
Oh yeah.

758
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:49,360
Yeah.

759
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:50,360
Okay.

760
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:51,360
That's where you're doing it.

761
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:52,360
I see.

762
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:53,360
Not, not my pro.

763
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:54,360
My, uh, my, uh, my, even my air has 16.

764
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:55,360
Yeah.

765
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,360
Well you can get these with 16, these IMAX, but that's it.

766
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:57,360
No more than 16.

767
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:58,360
That's it.

768
00:34:58,360 --> 00:34:59,360
I don't know.

769
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:04,840
I mean, you know what, as much as I dunk on the IMAX pro, it's the undersecretary of almost,

770
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:05,840
okay.

771
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:06,840
I don't know.

772
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:08,200
Like it's a good machine.

773
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:13,360
It's better than, yeah, it's just loud and kind of hot.

774
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:16,900
You and that IMAX have been through the war and back and you know, it's had your back

775
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:21,480
many times, but if you're honest with yourself, it's just not quite been the same since it

776
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:24,800
had the spider in its screen and it had to be taken out to get cleaned.

777
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:28,160
It's never quite been the same, but that's all right.

778
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:29,160
You still love it.

779
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:38,280
I just want to say the CIMAC has never left me loyal to the end.

780
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:40,400
Datadog.com slash coder radio.

781
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:43,680
This is a tool that's going to solve some problems and to help you visualize and communicate

782
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:47,720
with your team, analyze code level performance across your environment and troubleshoot issues

783
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:50,200
faster with Datadog.

784
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:53,840
Datadog has this thing called the continuous profile and it automatically collects profiles

785
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:57,800
from your production servers all the time, and then you can go back and analyze your

786
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:02,080
data quickly with minimal overhead and get a unified picture of your environment by correlating

787
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:07,480
code performance metrics with other monitoring data in real time in their dashboards and

788
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:10,480
their dashboards are gorgeous.

789
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:11,480
You got to go check that out.

790
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:14,760
Just go to datadog.com slash coder radio for that.

791
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:16,760
But what they do is they bring it all together with integrations.

792
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:18,720
You can plug into other applications and APIs.

793
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:23,380
Of course, they got tracing across the entire application stack, log management, that continuous

794
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:28,360
profiler I mentioned, and it brings it all together in one platform.

795
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:29,640
One platform.

796
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:31,200
One place.

797
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:35,680
Datadog enables you to pinpoint the root cause of issues faster than ever.

798
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:42,000
So go try Datadog out for free for 14 days by visiting datadog.com slash coder radio.

799
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,000
Here's the deal.

800
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,680
It's been a while since there's been events with swag.

801
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:49,480
So for a limited time, if you start a trial and create one dashboard, you'll get a free

802
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:54,680
Datadog t-shirt, but you got to go to datadog.com slash coder radio.

803
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:59,320
That's datadog.com slash coder radio.

804
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:04,360
You know what surprised me the most from the event was the iPad Pro.

805
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:07,160
I love the way Apple leaned into this.

806
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:11,480
I don't know if you saw this, but this was the best part of the event when Mission Impossible

807
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:15,400
style they have a burglar come in, you know, they go down a duct, they're down on a wire

808
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:20,280
pass lasers, he breaks in, he steals the M1 CPU and then he busts into another room and

809
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:25,560
he puts it in the iPad, he closes the case and then the camera pans around and the burglar

810
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:32,640
pulls off the mask and it's Tim Cook and then they say, we've added an M1 to the iPad and

811
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:37,320
they just went all in on just putting the best chip they've got in the iPad now.

812
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:38,320
Okay.

813
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:44,120
I mean, but I don't give a crap unless they're going to change the app store guidelines.

814
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:45,120
It doesn't matter.

815
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:49,360
It really doesn't, you know, so they got eight core CPU in there.

816
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:54,380
They're saying it's 50% improvements over just the last one and they put Thunderbolt

817
00:37:54,380 --> 00:37:56,400
in this thing, which is brilliant.

818
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:59,680
It has proper external display, but you're not allowed to use it.

819
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:04,880
It has all this nice stuff, faster storage, two terabytes, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

820
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:09,480
And I'm sitting here going, okay, great, but give me the OS and the applications that can

821
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:13,660
take advantage of any of this or just stop reviewing apps for functionality and allow

822
00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:16,120
any non malware app in.

823
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:21,640
And then this very powerful, by the way, it was powerful two years ago when Lana Del Rey,

824
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:27,400
oh, by the way, Lana Del Rey, lovely, did her little presentation, right?

825
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:29,420
The problem has not been the hardware.

826
00:38:29,420 --> 00:38:34,120
The problem is their insane policies, why they want to gimp the iPad.

827
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:37,920
I mean, I think it's worse than that though, because I think the OS also is limited in

828
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:39,840
a lot of ways, especially on the iPad.

829
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:46,520
There are sneaky, hacky, old school Mac OS and the next step things in iPad OS.

830
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:51,780
So spoiler alert, it's all basically next step OS with lipstick on it.

831
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:52,920
That's why we love it.

832
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:54,920
I say that in air quotes, right?

833
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:57,120
But Apple won't let you put that in the app store.

834
00:38:57,120 --> 00:39:02,040
I feel like what we might be in the middle of is part two of this story.

835
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:07,840
I mean, why do you bother even putting 16 gig, Mike, Mike, six, this thing can get up

836
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:12,040
to 16 gigs of RAM in an iPad, Mike.

837
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:17,100
If you spec at a 12.9 inch iPad all the way out with 5g and 16 gigs of RAM and two terabytes

838
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:23,560
of storage, and I am definitely not doing that right now, but yeah, keep going $2,400.

839
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:25,560
That's how much an iPad would cost spec'd out.

840
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:27,480
That's just like one week of running a meth lab.

841
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:33,060
It actually is more expensive than the highest tier M1 MacBook pro and the MacBook air with

842
00:39:33,060 --> 00:39:34,420
all the available upgrades.

843
00:39:34,420 --> 00:39:35,760
It's more expensive than that.

844
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:36,760
All right, fair boy.

845
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:39,880
Then let me ask you, let me, let's turn this around on you.

846
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:45,200
Why don't they just let the iPad loose just so you know what iPad apps and you could separate

847
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:52,360
them from iPhone apps are in fact full computer applications and right, cause it's iPad OS.

848
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:53,600
It's a different OS too.

849
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:54,600
It's really not.

850
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:58,520
But I know, I know, but I'm playing, you know, I'm playing along, but like should just have

851
00:39:58,520 --> 00:39:59,760
like, you know what?

852
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:03,080
If you're dumb enough to download something stupid, then right, right.

853
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:05,280
Well, and like I said, I think it was just last week.

854
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:09,040
It's like just turn on that gatekeeper crap that they have on the Mac and do notarization

855
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:11,320
and problem solved on the iPad.

856
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:12,360
I don't think we're going to get that.

857
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:13,360
I think that's ridiculous.

858
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:18,320
It's never going to happen, but this is so clearly part one of a two part story for the

859
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:19,320
iPad.

860
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:20,320
Okay.

861
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:21,320
What's part two?

862
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:22,600
Part two is WWDC and iOS 15 on the iPad.

863
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:24,120
No, but what, what is part two?

864
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:25,520
Like in your, okay.

865
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:34,240
So the, the problem I have been covetching about Mazel Tov is not the hardware or even

866
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:39,600
the APIs, but Apple's insane policies for the iPad.

867
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:40,600
It's got to be both.

868
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:43,880
It's got to be a change of policies, a change in app store.

869
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:44,880
Range of policy.

870
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:45,880
Yep.

871
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:46,880
Yep.

872
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:47,880
And, or no, no, I'm sorry.

873
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:49,720
An update in policies and update.

874
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:50,720
Dude, you're high.

875
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:51,720
Like, come on.

876
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:57,280
No, no way that they're not going to let developers, like what they need to do is let developers

877
00:40:57,280 --> 00:41:00,740
treat the iPad as it were a windows and you can write any application you want and sell

878
00:41:00,740 --> 00:41:02,280
it the way you want to.

879
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:03,280
I don't know.

880
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:04,280
I don't know if that's going to go that far.

881
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:06,960
I think there'll be some concession in regards to apps.

882
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:11,560
It'll be something dumb like interapp operability and then we're going to find out a year later

883
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:15,200
that other developers who are big names have had that before.

884
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:19,080
Just like the 15% thing where it turns out Netflix and Amazon had that for two years.

885
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:23,720
I think that's exactly, that's, that's the line I'm thinking combined with maybe windowing

886
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:29,640
in iPad OS or something like that to change how you can manage multiple applications because.

887
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:30,920
I'm going to push back on windowing.

888
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:36,120
I think the iPad is the perfect device for pop OS slash magnet on Mac OS tiling.

889
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:37,120
Yeah, tiling.

890
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:38,120
Yeah, absolutely.

891
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:42,500
Or they could even come up and I think they've prototyped a tabbing type where you basically

892
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:46,400
have tabs and you know, that's maybe up on the corner or a pull down tab screen and you

893
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:50,360
can tab between your apps and I don't know what they would do there, but something where

894
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:54,600
you could move information between screens easier, stuff like that.

895
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:57,960
It just seems like they have to know that they've added a keyboard, a mouse, 16 gigs

896
00:41:57,960 --> 00:42:03,920
of RAM, two terabytes of storage, and this crazy ass pro XDR type display they have on

897
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:04,920
the iPad pro.

898
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:08,600
None of it really makes sense unless the iPad can do more.

899
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:12,380
There's no reason to spend $2,400 on this machine unless it can do more.

900
00:42:12,380 --> 00:42:13,720
Let me just undercut my whole argument.

901
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:16,060
I'm going to buy one of these and I'm going to try to build the app I've been dreaming

902
00:42:16,060 --> 00:42:23,380
about for two decades and when it gets rejected, my God, we're going to have some content Chris.

903
00:42:23,380 --> 00:42:27,660
Developer Steve Troughton Smith on Twitter says putting M1 in the iPad without a software

904
00:42:27,660 --> 00:42:32,160
story to explain why it needs the extra hardware and features and power offered by M1 like

905
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:37,440
Thunderbolt really feels like foreshadowing, implying foreshadowing for WWDC.

906
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:38,440
You know what?

907
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:41,240
I got to tell you, I'm all in an iPad.

908
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:42,240
Okay.

909
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:44,280
Old Coder Radio listeners, you know, I believe in tablet computing.

910
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:45,280
Yep.

911
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:46,840
I lost a lot of money.

912
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:48,880
Well you went with the windows Metro.

913
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:49,880
Who me?

914
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:50,880
Windows eight man.

915
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:51,880
Yeah, you, you did.

916
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:54,560
You got all in on the Microsoft hype, brah.

917
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:58,880
See they went, they went around this same route, but Apple is doing it in a, they start

918
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:03,400
with the basic tablet and they've built up a pencil and now they've added a keyboard

919
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:04,400
and now they've.

920
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:08,040
Can I just say that like the Microsoft problem was the hardware was crap and it didn't last

921
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:09,280
long enough.

922
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:11,760
And the Apple problem is the hardware is amazing.

923
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:12,760
Yeah.

924
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:13,760
Right?

925
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:16,720
Like, and they're just like jerks about how you could monetize your business.

926
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:17,720
Yeah.

927
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:18,720
And the OS is limited too.

928
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:20,120
You know, it's a double whammy for sure.

929
00:43:20,120 --> 00:43:21,120
Yeah.

930
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:22,120
The API is our tie.

931
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:26,880
I personally think if you know enough about objective C and if you don't, you deserve

932
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:30,960
to be lined up and shot, but that's, what was I going with this?

933
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:34,400
Just a classic story there.

934
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:35,400
I wonder.

935
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:36,400
So here's my thought, Mike.

936
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:37,400
I've had gay bars.

937
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:38,400
Yes.

938
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:42,060
No, no, that's not where I was going, but you know, you never know.

939
00:43:42,060 --> 00:43:43,060
What are you high?

940
00:43:43,060 --> 00:43:47,060
But what I was, if this thing has thunderbolt and now they're claiming to add proper external

941
00:43:47,060 --> 00:43:48,280
monitor support.

942
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:49,280
Go for it.

943
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:50,280
I want to hear it.

944
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:51,280
I love where you're going.

945
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:58,460
But could you get a stand and take a thunderbolt dock with say a wired keyboard and audio interface

946
00:43:58,460 --> 00:44:02,960
and ethernet port and display port with a monitor hooked up to it and plug that in doing

947
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:08,360
power pass through, plug that into the iPad and get a full monitor keyboard mouse.

948
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:11,160
I think if you can't, it's retarded to have thunderbolt.

949
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:12,160
Yeah.

950
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:13,160
Yeah.

951
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:14,440
It has thunderbolt has to be doing more than just storage.

952
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:15,440
Yeah.

953
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:16,440
That has to work.

954
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:17,720
I mean, come on.

955
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:19,260
No one on an iPad.

956
00:44:19,260 --> 00:44:20,880
No one needs that much data transfer.

957
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:21,880
I'm sorry.

958
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:22,880
Yeah.

959
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:23,880
What are you going to do?

960
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:27,600
Especially because of how locked down the file transfer API is iOS, which by the way,

961
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:33,400
I was going to run a fantastic blue ray backup program to the iPad backup.

962
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:38,520
Oh, that would be sweet, but you can't do it because they don't allow that.

963
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:42,520
If I did not have an iPad pro today, I'd be picking up the 12.9 inch iPad.

964
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:47,280
I would not be speccing it out like crazy, but I'm definitely not on the checkout screen.

965
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:49,200
Let me tell you what I'm not doing.

966
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:50,200
Okay.

967
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:51,200
What are you going to not do?

968
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:52,200
Yeah.

969
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:57,240
I'm not going to personalize this one and say Chris's hair is fantastic that I'm just

970
00:44:57,240 --> 00:44:59,680
not going to definitely not doing that right.

971
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:00,680
Okay.

972
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:01,680
I didn't just upgrade it to 250.

973
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:02,680
Sure.

974
00:45:02,680 --> 00:45:03,680
Sure.

975
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:04,680
$1,200.

976
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:05,680
Whoa.

977
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:06,680
$1,200 to go to 256.

978
00:45:06,680 --> 00:45:07,680
Yeah.

979
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:08,680
That's a lot of money.

980
00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:13,120
Are you looking at, is that the old one too, or is that the new one?

981
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:14,120
New one.

982
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:15,120
Oh my God.

983
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:18,040
The base model is almost 1100, 1099.

984
00:45:18,040 --> 00:45:19,160
It's a lot.

985
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:20,160
That's a lot.

986
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:21,160
It's just so much.

987
00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:22,160
It's more than a computer.

988
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:23,440
So it really has to be doing more.

989
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:25,360
And this doesn't even have an LTE chip.

990
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:26,360
Oh.

991
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:27,360
I know.

992
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:28,920
And the LTE is very, very useful.

993
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:30,680
I have found that to be very true.

994
00:45:30,680 --> 00:45:32,800
And they charge a lot of money for that.

995
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:34,320
I don't know about that.

996
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:40,440
If I didn't have a perfectly functional iPad that is perfectly fast, I might be tempted,

997
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:41,440
but it's just the cost.

998
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:42,440
It's just outrageous.

999
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:43,680
My kid dropped mine and broke it.

1000
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:49,000
So I'm in the market, but damn, that's a lot of money.

1001
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:55,080
So do you think we're going to get a more pro line of iMac, like a 27 inch iMac at WWDC

1002
00:45:55,080 --> 00:45:56,080
with an MX1?

1003
00:45:56,080 --> 00:45:57,080
Yeah.

1004
00:45:57,080 --> 00:45:58,080
I think we are.

1005
00:45:58,080 --> 00:45:59,080
Because you know what?

1006
00:45:59,080 --> 00:46:03,760
Because they made it 24 inches and I think they're going to start using size, screen

1007
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:07,680
size as a demarcation in RAM.

1008
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:08,680
I'm thinking that too.

1009
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:09,680
RAM.

1010
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:13,520
Anything that does more than 16 gig is more engineered at professionals and it'll probably

1011
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:19,120
be space gray, you know, boring colors for professionals as they like to do.

1012
00:46:19,120 --> 00:46:24,320
I also just as a total aside, because I can't help myself, I also wonder because the iPad

1013
00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:29,080
Pro has the M1 and these new iMacs have the M1, if Hector Martin and his team over at

1014
00:46:29,080 --> 00:46:33,440
Ashi Linux are successful and we're getting Linux working on the M1, it should be functional

1015
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:39,840
on all of the machines that Apple announced today, which is pretty cool.

1016
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:45,680
They're getting the initial boot support merged in kernel 5.13, which is the next kernel after

1017
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:50,320
the one that comes out this weekend, and including a brand new bootloader to help manage kind

1018
00:46:50,320 --> 00:46:52,120
of Apple's unique boot environment.

1019
00:46:52,120 --> 00:46:54,600
And that's all getting merged into kernel 5.13.

1020
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:58,560
5.12 comes out this weekend, so it's really not that far away.

1021
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:03,600
And then once they get that working, it's just drivers development, but I forget her

1022
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:09,580
name, but this software developer who is working on GPU support for Linux has already got like

1023
00:47:09,580 --> 00:47:17,080
the full OpenGL style cube spinning on Linux on the M1 GPU.

1024
00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:20,480
They've got basic 3D instructions working already.

1025
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:25,800
So they're making really good progress, and it appears that the M1 hardware loads some

1026
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:30,760
of the firmware blobs necessary to initialize that hardware outside and independent of the

1027
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:34,520
OS, so some of that stuff just comes up when the machine comes up and they don't have to

1028
00:47:34,520 --> 00:47:38,720
fool with it at all in Linux, which is saving them some time.

1029
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:40,700
And now it's just figuring out the driver fundamentals.

1030
00:47:40,700 --> 00:47:45,740
But you know, the fact that they're drawing a cube and can spin it on the M1, that's a

1031
00:47:45,740 --> 00:47:46,740
big step.

1032
00:47:46,740 --> 00:47:47,740
They can do it.

1033
00:47:47,740 --> 00:47:49,740
Yeah, that's a big step.

1034
00:47:49,740 --> 00:47:54,340
If that happens, if they get to a point where they say you can get the desktop running and

1035
00:47:54,340 --> 00:47:59,100
you can use a web browser or something like that, I will buy whatever M1 is on the market

1036
00:47:59,100 --> 00:48:01,560
at the time, even if it's not an M1X.

1037
00:48:01,560 --> 00:48:02,560
That'll be the moment.

1038
00:48:02,560 --> 00:48:07,080
Drew, just, you know, you know what to do.

1039
00:48:07,080 --> 00:48:09,060
Run the market if it runs Linux.

1040
00:48:09,060 --> 00:48:13,020
Until then, they're going to have to do something more impressive to get me to switch.

1041
00:48:13,020 --> 00:48:17,460
Not that I don't think the M1 has plenty of performance, but if I'm going to make that

1042
00:48:17,460 --> 00:48:21,920
kind of transition, it's got to be something that will last me years because of the prices

1043
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:23,480
of these machines.

1044
00:48:23,480 --> 00:48:24,480
So we shall see.

1045
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:28,700
I think it's going to be maybe WWDC, maybe September.

1046
00:48:28,700 --> 00:48:34,740
My last thoughts are, like always, Apple is a step above everyone else in video production

1047
00:48:34,740 --> 00:48:35,740
quality.

1048
00:48:35,740 --> 00:48:40,480
Apple felt a little different for this event, but they nailed it right on the hour mark,

1049
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:44,180
right as my recorder was hitting an hour, they were wrapping it up.

1050
00:48:44,180 --> 00:48:48,500
And they really outdid themselves once again with all of the transitions.

1051
00:48:48,500 --> 00:48:52,980
And I like this new thing that's happening on YouTube where there are a couple of creators

1052
00:48:52,980 --> 00:48:56,460
who have just taken all of the transitions and put that in a video.

1053
00:48:56,460 --> 00:48:58,620
I'll have one of those linked in the show notes.

1054
00:48:58,620 --> 00:49:01,980
And even if you don't watch the rest of the event, it's worth watching the transitions

1055
00:49:01,980 --> 00:49:04,620
because they do a hell of a video production on these.

1056
00:49:04,620 --> 00:49:06,660
And so we'll have that linked in the show notes.

1057
00:49:06,660 --> 00:49:12,260
And then our commentary of the live event itself with the whole thing with minimal commentary,

1058
00:49:12,260 --> 00:49:16,380
that'll be linked in the show notes and it starts about 24 minutes in.

1059
00:49:16,380 --> 00:49:17,980
They really do a fantastic job though.

1060
00:49:17,980 --> 00:49:23,300
So if you are even somewhat curious and want something you could watch for an hour, it's

1061
00:49:23,300 --> 00:49:26,940
worth checking out because they do a hell of a job and you get a little more information

1062
00:49:26,940 --> 00:49:27,940
in there.

1063
00:49:27,940 --> 00:49:33,100
So we survived an event without either one of us going broke.

1064
00:49:33,100 --> 00:49:36,820
And overall, I think probably pretty good stuff.

1065
00:49:36,820 --> 00:49:41,480
The theme that I keep coming away with here is that Apple has a real hit on their hands

1066
00:49:41,480 --> 00:49:45,260
with this M1 stuff, so much so that they just went full in on calling it that in the iPad

1067
00:49:45,260 --> 00:49:46,260
too.

1068
00:49:46,260 --> 00:49:52,640
And I have seen a lot of interest from general people out there in the world following this

1069
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:55,500
stuff that just like tech in a way they haven't seen for a while.

1070
00:49:55,500 --> 00:49:59,300
And it still plays into my fear that it's going to be appealing to a lot of techies.

1071
00:49:59,300 --> 00:50:06,180
Some long term friends I know, Mike, one of them, I guess, was the developer of a desktop

1072
00:50:06,180 --> 00:50:11,900
environment that people in the audience would know of, has just walked away from burnout

1073
00:50:11,900 --> 00:50:13,860
and bought himself a MacBook Air.

1074
00:50:13,860 --> 00:50:17,120
Well, of course, because he deserves to have a life and be happy.

1075
00:50:17,120 --> 00:50:19,100
That's what happens to Linux developers.

1076
00:50:19,100 --> 00:50:21,900
It's anecdotal, but I keep hearing stories from people.

1077
00:50:21,900 --> 00:50:22,980
No, I don't think it is.

1078
00:50:22,980 --> 00:50:26,500
I think, you know what, I'm sorry.

1079
00:50:26,500 --> 00:50:29,660
You can't develop a Linux desktop environment and be happy.

1080
00:50:29,660 --> 00:50:30,660
You just can't.

1081
00:50:30,660 --> 00:50:32,220
It's a challenge for sure.

1082
00:50:32,220 --> 00:50:35,300
I like how you were like, I can't say yes to that.

1083
00:50:35,300 --> 00:50:38,140
I heard from somebody after I mean, I heard from a few people that like you guys are way

1084
00:50:38,140 --> 00:50:43,100
off, but I heard from people that are actually creating apps and or a desktop environment.

1085
00:50:43,100 --> 00:50:46,140
And I heard basically you spot on and it's really burning me out.

1086
00:50:46,140 --> 00:50:51,060
I heard from one individual who I won't share their name said that there are just glaring

1087
00:50:51,060 --> 00:50:54,780
technical issues in the Linux desktop that we're not addressing and people that are not

1088
00:50:54,780 --> 00:50:56,860
acknowledging it are not helping.

1089
00:50:56,860 --> 00:50:58,740
They're harming the desktop.

1090
00:50:58,740 --> 00:51:04,620
Well, first of all, and forgive me, Master Chris, this is Coder radio, not Linux radio,

1091
00:51:04,620 --> 00:51:05,620
right?

1092
00:51:05,620 --> 00:51:06,620
I don't give a crap about Linux.

1093
00:51:06,620 --> 00:51:07,620
I mean, I like Linux.

1094
00:51:07,620 --> 00:51:09,420
I'm very friendly with the system.

1095
00:51:09,420 --> 00:51:12,940
Seventy six people competition makes everyone better.

1096
00:51:12,940 --> 00:51:14,980
And I'm just I'll put my cards on the table.

1097
00:51:14,980 --> 00:51:20,260
I think right now Apple is winning because this M1 chip is an ace, right?

1098
00:51:20,260 --> 00:51:22,660
This is it's the ace of Trump.

1099
00:51:22,660 --> 00:51:28,340
It takes every trick and that is a card playing term, not what you idiots think it is.

1100
00:51:28,340 --> 00:51:34,380
But that doesn't mean that like Dell or Seventy six or what's that stupid Linux vendor you

1101
00:51:34,380 --> 00:51:35,380
like?

1102
00:51:35,380 --> 00:51:36,380
Wow.

1103
00:51:36,380 --> 00:51:37,980
They'll never advertise on this show.

1104
00:51:37,980 --> 00:51:38,980
Purism.

1105
00:51:38,980 --> 00:51:39,980
You're thinking of purism.

1106
00:51:39,980 --> 00:51:40,980
Purism.

1107
00:51:40,980 --> 00:51:41,980
Yeah, that's the one I think is incompetent.

1108
00:51:41,980 --> 00:51:42,980
Yeah.

1109
00:51:42,980 --> 00:51:48,180
Because you guys are morons and you believe in false, which is a waste of time.

1110
00:51:48,180 --> 00:51:49,180
Wow.

1111
00:51:49,180 --> 00:51:50,180
Is this BSD radio?

1112
00:51:50,180 --> 00:51:51,820
Because it feels a lot like it.

1113
00:51:51,820 --> 00:51:56,060
Chopping bombs, chopping bombs, pow, pow.

1114
00:51:56,060 --> 00:51:57,340
Resoft, there's a waste of time.

1115
00:51:57,340 --> 00:51:58,340
It should all be BSD.

1116
00:51:58,340 --> 00:51:59,340
Woo.

1117
00:51:59,340 --> 00:52:00,340
There.

1118
00:52:00,340 --> 00:52:01,340
Ooh la la.

1119
00:52:01,340 --> 00:52:02,340
We're done.

1120
00:52:02,340 --> 00:52:03,340
Free BSD.

1121
00:52:03,340 --> 00:52:04,340
Thank you.

1122
00:52:04,340 --> 00:52:05,340
Thank you very much.

1123
00:52:05,340 --> 00:52:06,340
Good night, everybody.

1124
00:52:06,340 --> 00:52:07,340
Yes.

1125
00:52:07,340 --> 00:52:08,780
No, I think they have done a tremendous job.

1126
00:52:08,780 --> 00:52:11,780
I think they are being very competitive and if we're being honest, they've brought the

1127
00:52:11,780 --> 00:52:12,780
fight.

1128
00:52:12,780 --> 00:52:13,780
I've thought about this too recently.

1129
00:52:13,780 --> 00:52:19,740
You know, isn't GNOME 40's adoption of a horizontal workspace layout kind of an acknowledgement

1130
00:52:19,740 --> 00:52:23,460
that Apple was right when they implemented a horizontal workspace layout?

1131
00:52:23,460 --> 00:52:24,460
Shh.

1132
00:52:24,460 --> 00:52:25,460
Do not tell.

1133
00:52:25,460 --> 00:52:27,580
No, you can't say that to them.

1134
00:52:27,580 --> 00:52:28,580
That's uncomfortable.

1135
00:52:28,580 --> 00:52:29,580
Okay.

1136
00:52:29,580 --> 00:52:30,580
Okay.

1137
00:52:30,580 --> 00:52:32,260
Why are you trying to trigger the neckbeards?

1138
00:52:32,260 --> 00:52:33,340
No, no, no.

1139
00:52:33,340 --> 00:52:38,060
I'm just trying to point out, I'm just trying to point out that there is room for improvement,

1140
00:52:38,060 --> 00:52:42,100
but I think I completely, totally respect and appreciate the position of people who

1141
00:52:42,100 --> 00:52:43,980
wrote it and said, I don't care, man.

1142
00:52:43,980 --> 00:52:46,080
I just, you know, I want my Honda Accord.

1143
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:47,420
I want to get in my Honda Accord.

1144
00:52:47,420 --> 00:52:50,780
I want it to drive me to work so I can get my job done and I want to drive me home and

1145
00:52:50,780 --> 00:52:52,060
I don't want to spend a bunch.

1146
00:52:52,060 --> 00:52:53,060
That's right.

1147
00:52:53,060 --> 00:52:55,660
Cause Fonda rolls a Honda and she's got back.

1148
00:52:55,660 --> 00:52:57,220
I agree.

1149
00:52:57,220 --> 00:52:58,340
You know it, boy.

1150
00:52:58,340 --> 00:52:59,340
You know it.

1151
00:52:59,340 --> 00:53:01,020
Mr. Dominic, do you have anything you want to plug this week?

1152
00:53:01,020 --> 00:53:05,700
I guess if somebody is making more than $75,000 a year on making a Linux desktop application,

1153
00:53:05,700 --> 00:53:06,700
let us know.

1154
00:53:06,700 --> 00:53:07,700
There might be a Thaleo in it for you.

1155
00:53:07,700 --> 00:53:09,140
Is the bet still on or is it over now?

1156
00:53:09,140 --> 00:53:13,140
I mean, I'm willing to keep that bet forever because I know I'm never going to lose, but

1157
00:53:13,140 --> 00:53:14,140
what do I win?

1158
00:53:14,140 --> 00:53:15,140
Hang on.

1159
00:53:15,140 --> 00:53:16,140
What do you win?

1160
00:53:16,140 --> 00:53:17,140
At some point I have to win something.

1161
00:53:17,140 --> 00:53:18,140
Maybe.

1162
00:53:18,140 --> 00:53:19,140
Oh, okay.

1163
00:53:19,140 --> 00:53:20,140
Okay.

1164
00:53:20,140 --> 00:53:21,140
What?

1165
00:53:21,140 --> 00:53:22,140
I have something here.

1166
00:53:22,140 --> 00:53:23,140
Okay.

1167
00:53:23,140 --> 00:53:24,140
What?

1168
00:53:24,140 --> 00:53:27,860
If the robes actually ship, which I know they will, you're amazing.

1169
00:53:27,860 --> 00:53:32,020
I'm thinking smoking jackets, Coder Radio only smoking jackets.

1170
00:53:32,020 --> 00:53:33,780
Oh, that'd be good.

1171
00:53:33,780 --> 00:53:34,780
That'd be good.

1172
00:53:34,780 --> 00:53:38,340
And I will do the operations on it this time and I will take all the pain.

1173
00:53:38,340 --> 00:53:40,540
Man, I thought you were going to say something about Seuss.

1174
00:53:40,540 --> 00:53:43,860
I seriously thought you were going to be like, you have to run Seuss for a week or?

1175
00:53:43,860 --> 00:53:44,860
Nope.

1176
00:53:44,860 --> 00:53:45,860
No Seuss.

1177
00:53:45,860 --> 00:53:46,860
No Seuss.

1178
00:53:46,860 --> 00:53:47,860
Okay.

1179
00:53:47,860 --> 00:53:48,860
Please stop saying Seuss.

1180
00:53:48,860 --> 00:53:53,660
They keep emailing and texting me and I just, I have to have a life.

1181
00:53:53,660 --> 00:53:54,660
I'm sorry.

1182
00:53:54,660 --> 00:53:55,660
That's right.

1183
00:53:55,660 --> 00:53:58,700
Seuss, but Coder Radio smoking jackets.

1184
00:53:58,700 --> 00:54:06,460
If the ropes ship and if a hundred people tweet us seriously and say, we want smoking

1185
00:54:06,460 --> 00:54:07,460
jackets.

1186
00:54:07,460 --> 00:54:09,380
And then if we can pull that off.

1187
00:54:09,380 --> 00:54:11,940
After the robe thing, you're going to try to make smoking jackets a thing.

1188
00:54:11,940 --> 00:54:12,940
Oh man.

1189
00:54:12,940 --> 00:54:15,380
Yeah, but you're not going to love the way I make these smoking jackets, but we're going

1190
00:54:15,380 --> 00:54:16,380
to do it.

1191
00:54:16,380 --> 00:54:23,820
It sounds like you're going to use some sort of forced labor.

1192
00:54:23,820 --> 00:54:24,820
You're not denying it.

1193
00:54:24,820 --> 00:54:26,140
So it's probably true.

1194
00:54:26,140 --> 00:54:27,140
All right.

1195
00:54:27,140 --> 00:54:28,140
Well, very good.

1196
00:54:28,140 --> 00:54:32,740
Also, thank you to our members, Coder QA team out there making the show possible.
