00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,600
This is Coda Radio, episode 443 for December 6th, 2021.

2
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:19,220
Hello friends and welcome back to Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show, taking a

3
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:25,480
pragmatic look at the art and the business of software development and the world of technology.

4
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:29,640
My name is Chris and joining us every single week like the podcast soldier that he is,

5
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:31,040
our host, Mr. Dominic.

6
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:32,040
Hello, Mike.

7
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:33,040
Hello.

8
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:34,040
Hello.

9
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:35,040
Hello.

10
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,040
You kind of just sliding right into the show today.

11
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:37,040
I hadn't heard from you this morning.

12
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:41,360
I thought, oh, he must be either a in a meeting or be deep into something.

13
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:42,680
I looked over and you were there.

14
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:43,680
You were there.

15
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:44,680
I was like, oh, he's here.

16
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:46,320
You know, it's just been running from thing to thing.

17
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,720
Well, let's take a moment, you know, and we'll spend some time together.

18
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:51,680
We'll just pretend like now that's going on.

19
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:52,680
That's what I like to do.

20
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:54,800
I like to just black it all out.

21
00:00:54,800 --> 00:01:00,560
And I noticed to kind of kick things off that you have finally gotten your hands and I don't

22
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:03,880
know if we've ever talked about the warp terminal on the show before.

23
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:09,000
I feel like we might have mentioned it once before, but it's a rust based terminal that

24
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,520
supposedly going to be on multiple platforms, but is out for the Mac now.

25
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:16,700
You got in on it and I just kind of want to know what you think, because I've heard people

26
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:17,760
talking about it.

27
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:22,680
And is there really I guess there is room on the Mac in particular for a better terminal,

28
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:23,680
isn't there?

29
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,560
Something we've complained about before on the show.

30
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:26,560
Oh, yeah.

31
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:30,360
I mean, I will say this warp terminal I'm using it as my daily driver for now.

32
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:34,240
It is a lot prettier than terminal dot app.

33
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,520
And it's just lightning fast.

34
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:39,520
And it's got that command palette sort of like V.S. code, but looks better.

35
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:40,520
Yes.

36
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:41,520
And it's got a bunch of built in stuff.

37
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:46,000
If you use GitHub or some other continuous integration stuff, I kind of only cracked

38
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,520
the surface of it because it's only been about a week.

39
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:53,240
But I am loving it so far and I'm hopefully going to learn more about some of the more

40
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:54,240
advanced features.

41
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:59,920
The number one feature that you love and that I love is that it's written in Rust.

42
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,080
I don't know why that matters, really, when you're using it.

43
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:04,080
It doesn't, but we should Rust all the things.

44
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:07,160
I wanted to mention because I got in trouble last year that I didn't say on the show and

45
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:12,080
I almost did it again this year, that the Tuxy votes are open right now.

46
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,300
This is a thing we're doing in Linux Unplugged.

47
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:18,020
It's not a coder thing, but I specifically got yelled at for not mentioning it here,

48
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:22,420
because it's an opportunity for you to vote on the best open source projects and distros

49
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:23,640
of the year.

50
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:24,640
People wanted to get their vote in.

51
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:31,040
So you go to tuxys.party, it's tuxys.party, and you go in there and you vote for your

52
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:34,880
favorite distros and projects and text editors and all that stuff.

53
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:39,400
Then towards the very end of the year on Linux Unplugged, we announce who the winners are

54
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:43,700
and give out awards and they get entered into a hall of fame and all of that kind of stuff.

55
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:49,400
It's a good time and the CoderRadio audience deserves their vote, so tuxys.party is where

56
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,560
you go get that.

57
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:54,400
And I'm sorry I didn't mention it last year.

58
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:58,480
So you made your position pretty clear on the Web3 stuff, so when we got this email

59
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:03,480
from Sonya into the show, it was pretty clear that Sonya doesn't actually listen.

60
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:09,560
And I should say, we get a lot of pitches for interviews on this show, and a lot of

61
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:10,560
them are bad pitches.

62
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,160
Yeah, a little inside baseball.

63
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:16,100
Doing interviews on the air is kind of a huge pain in the butt.

64
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:21,040
You've done a lot of them for the Mike Dominic show, so you know what a pain it is.

65
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:26,600
And then there's a huge market in PR firms that try to book people to go on shows to

66
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,600
promote their stuff.

67
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,140
You tell me about it.

68
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:31,140
So Sonya wrote in.

69
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:34,360
She's a PR manager at Decentology.

70
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:38,320
It's an innovative company behind the Hyperverse, Mike, which is an open, composable, smart

71
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:42,680
contracts marketplace that makes it easy for developers to discover, build, and monetize

72
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:43,680
Web3 applications.

73
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,360
What the hell does that mean?

74
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:48,040
She thought, well, she'd contact us so that way we could talk about it a little bit, because

75
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:52,400
you see, their mission is to onboard the next 10 million developers to Web3.

76
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:56,880
So they're willing to provide equal opportunities and knowledge to anyone interested in entering

77
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:57,880
the field.

78
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:02,340
They're going to have a hackathon initiative, which they call the HyperHack.

79
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:03,840
She actually says this on here.

80
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,040
Even Web2 developers will be welcome.

81
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:08,960
She wanted to reach out there on the show, and she loves it.

82
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,520
She loves the show.

83
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:14,160
She loves our stance on Web3, and she wants to promote her Web3 company.

84
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,560
I don't think Sonya listens, Mike.

85
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:20,560
I don't know why this one tickled me, because we get so many variations of this.

86
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,720
Yeah, I didn't even see this one.

87
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:25,360
I must have, my Darth Maul filter must have just been like, no, sorry.

88
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,360
All right.

89
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:30,600
So listener Michael wrote in, and he did kind of have a pragmatic take on the crypto blockchain

90
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,600
hype.

91
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:36,080
And he writes, as a daily pragmatist, I do get annoyed with the next big thinkers spouting

92
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:39,600
new ideas that will revolutionize all the things.

93
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:43,520
But it doesn't mean they're necessarily wrong about all the things.

94
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,880
We have to push the boundaries and discover new possibilities.

95
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:49,320
Now 99 out of 100 times, they're going to fall flat.

96
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:54,760
But that one out of 100 times, we get transformative things like modern web app frameworks, NFC,

97
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:55,760
Bluetooth.

98
00:04:55,760 --> 00:05:01,840
Sometimes it's actually hard to see in the moment the bull versus the real actual value.

99
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,040
But patience is the key.

100
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:07,840
The media hype clickbait machine incentivizes grifters, and that's a sad state.

101
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,960
But you just have to ignore them.

102
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:11,840
Society has always had this problem.

103
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:18,240
The snake oil salesman of the 1890s or the tube speculation crash of 1637.

104
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:22,240
Capitalism can incentivize innovation, but leaves the door cracked to grifters looking

105
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,020
to scam a quick buck.

106
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:28,560
My job is to look through the hype and see what actionable kernels of value I can leverage.

107
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:33,840
A good example, he says, blockchain as a technology is being used to power technology used by

108
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:39,400
title companies, a public record of ownership and title transfer for the state's large assets

109
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,720
and real estate.

110
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:45,480
Similarly, the import export documents for some international shipping companies are

111
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:49,280
now seeing similar applications using the blockchain.

112
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:52,960
That seems like a pretty reasonable take on actual value coming out of this.

113
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:55,000
That seems a pretty reasonable use case, right?

114
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:00,520
Like I don't think we've ever said the blockchain as a technology or concept was bad.

115
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:04,040
I think what's bad is doing things you can already do and slapping the hashtag web three

116
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,040
on it.

117
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:09,080
And claiming that you're going to topple the tech giants that own the market now is just

118
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,880
a little bit of a fool's errand.

119
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:13,320
I mean, we'd love to see it, but not going to happen.

120
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:14,320
Never.

121
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:16,120
We warned you about that about 10 years ago.

122
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:20,520
I'm wondering, though, you think maybe the mad botter might consider getting paid in

123
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:21,620
Miami coin?

124
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:22,620
Have you seen this?

125
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:24,160
This is near your neck of the woods.

126
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,840
Isn't that just cocaine?

127
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:30,720
I mean, I've been to Miami.

128
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,780
I'm pretty sure it's cocaine.

129
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:33,780
You are quick sometimes.

130
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:34,780
I have to say.

131
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:35,840
No, this is a real thing.

132
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:40,140
It's been around for about four months now or so, five months, maybe more.

133
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:42,240
Miami has launched the Miami coin.

134
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:45,000
It's worth about 30 million dollars right now.

135
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,480
You mine it and then you keep 70 percent of the revenue.

136
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,480
Give the rest to the city.

137
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:53,160
The city uses that to pay for certain city initiatives.

138
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:56,360
And Austin wants to have an Austin coin.

139
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:59,960
New York is thinking about having a New York coin.

140
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:00,960
Think about this.

141
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,400
And for listeners out there, think about this for a moment.

142
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:05,040
How does this make you feel?

143
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:11,240
If your local nearest large city had a cryptocurrency that you could buy and trade and sell and

144
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:16,160
that they use the revenue from that to pay for certain things where taxes didn't close

145
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,160
the gap.

146
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:20,000
I just hope you're ready to reorganize your entire business around this.

147
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,940
Miami not only claims that you can pay your taxes in Bitcoin.

148
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:29,120
They claim that the mayor and several city staff are getting paid in Bitcoin and that

149
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:34,360
city citizens will get a Bitcoin dividend from their profits.

150
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:40,400
Can you picture a world where almost every major city has its own cryptocurrency and

151
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:44,880
now you have to figure out how to sell a product like this is just going to be a whole new

152
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,400
cluster?

153
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,640
So I have two initial reactions.

154
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:50,480
What a nice PR stunt for Miami.

155
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:52,440
Well done, guys.

156
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:55,040
But this is just a bad idea, right?

157
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:58,960
This is the reason like every state, you know, you have their own currency here.

158
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:01,440
Remember the Oracle's Confederation?

159
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,000
That's exactly where I was going with this.

160
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,120
Yeah, it feels like we're going backwards in time.

161
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:08,560
They figured out that that's kind of stupid.

162
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:12,200
So there was a federal currency and we call that the dollar.

163
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:17,800
Imagine the possibility for different kinds of corruption when these different cities

164
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:22,640
have different implementations and policies and rules around their currency.

165
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:24,800
It's going to be wild.

166
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:28,520
Couldn't you like devalue a rival city's coin?

167
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:33,280
So this is inside Florida baseball, but Orlando, Miami, and to a lesser extent, Tampa, although

168
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:39,120
Tampa doesn't feel to a lesser extent, but they are in this like big fight to become

169
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:42,200
the tech hub for Florida.

170
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:45,720
Which is probably why Miami is doing this, by the way.

171
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:50,340
Wouldn't it be in the mayor of Tampa's interest, the mayor of Orlando's interest to totally

172
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:55,180
do whatever they can to devalue Miami coin and just screw the city of Miami?

173
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:59,800
Wouldn't it be like in any foreign powers interest to go after like major US cities

174
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:00,800
coins?

175
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:04,120
And then the other thing that will happen is these currencies will shoot up in value.

176
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:07,020
The Miami coins gone up like $10 million every month.

177
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:09,200
So these coins will shoot up in value.

178
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:14,120
The cities will use these high values to purchase Bitcoin.

179
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:18,840
And then as they begin selling their currency to buy Bitcoin, the currency will begin to

180
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:22,520
drop because there will become more supply on the market and the currencies will just

181
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,520
do this over and over again.

182
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:26,320
They'll go up, the cities will buy Bitcoin with that currency.

183
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:30,000
That's where they'll actually stash it and then the currencies will drop and it'll happen

184
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
over and over and over again.

185
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:37,040
It'll be a constant pump and dump scheme that basically raises the Bitcoin price artificially.

186
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,080
It's not good for crypto in general, I suspect.

187
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:43,120
So this is like my my constant thing with all this crap, right?

188
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,520
The block chain is amazing.

189
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:47,840
I think there's a lot of innovation that's going to happen there.

190
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:48,840
Fantastic.

191
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,960
Miami does not need a coin, right?

192
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:55,160
We need to really start talking about block chain as block chain.

193
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:56,560
I mean, I think I've made this clear.

194
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,400
I am not a crypto optimist.

195
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,400
I think.

196
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,400
Oh, really?

197
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,400
We were there, right?

198
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:05,160
We were there when all this started and was like, what are you buying drugs and hookers?

199
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:07,360
I mean, it's where it's come on.

200
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:11,120
Yeah, I always kind of feel like I mean, you got to keep in perspective like cash is probably

201
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,840
used for that 100 times over.

202
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:13,840
Sure.

203
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:17,880
And like, I can't say that I haven't bought some Dogecoin and then, you know, sold it

204
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:20,560
at a slight profit.

205
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:21,560
That's fun.

206
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:25,000
But I only do that once a year on Guy Fawkes Day.

207
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
That's the way to do it.

208
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
That's the way to do it.

209
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,200
I think, you know, there is some fundamentals there people find valuable, obviously a shared

210
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,560
ledger that's cryptographically verifiable.

211
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:35,120
That's pretty beneficial, right?

212
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:38,980
A decentralized way to send money from person to person.

213
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:44,560
If I could send every contractor of JB cash directly and not go through like some sort

214
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:48,720
of intermediary bank or PayPal or service, I absolutely would.

215
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:49,720
Why wouldn't?

216
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:52,000
I want to be able to pay everyone and anything directly.

217
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Of course I would.

218
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
I'd love to be able to do that online.

219
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,080
So have you heard of the IRS?

220
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,760
Yeah, that's definitely a thing.

221
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:58,760
Right.

222
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:00,720
And that's an area that's interesting.

223
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:04,120
You know, it seems like they're treating Bitcoin and things like that as an asset, not so much

224
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,120
as a currency.

225
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:08,920
So when you cash it out, that's when you have to pay your taxes.

226
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:10,320
Capital gains tax on Bitcoin.

227
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,320
I love it.

228
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,320
Yep.

229
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,440
Onto some more productivity follow up.

230
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,440
We got a bunch.

231
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,480
I just got a couple in here we could fit.

232
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:19,760
Longtime listener Remy wrote in and said, Hi, Mike and Chris.

233
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:22,640
On Thursday, local time, I got the new episode of Koda Radio.

234
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:23,640
So I'm a little behind.

235
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:25,240
I want to give you a productivity hack while I could.

236
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:32,120
I recently upgraded my macro pads, special small keyboards with rearrangeable keycaps.

237
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:37,460
And then he has small pieces of paper with legends under them instead of generic keycaps.

238
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:40,000
And we'll have a link because he has some photos in his blog post.

239
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
And it's awesome.

240
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,120
So we printed out these little squares, transparent keycaps.

241
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:47,480
He puts a little squares under there, and he says it makes an enormous difference in

242
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:55,640
debugging C++, which you'd be remotely connected remotely to a coffee machine.

243
00:11:55,640 --> 00:12:00,400
So he could kick off also that I mean, if you're going to go through the hassle of having

244
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:03,160
custom buttons, obviously, one of them has to brew coffee.

245
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:04,160
Yeah.

246
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:08,080
But I had I just had to share this one from Remy because one, it's just great to hear

247
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,080
from him.

248
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:13,440
But to the blog post that he linked with it is really rad because you see, you see kind

249
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,440
of what he's done with it.

250
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:16,160
The buttons are backlit.

251
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,840
And then he's printed these little squares with different colors and different words

252
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:19,840
on it.

253
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:22,060
And he just hits that and executes the macro.

254
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:26,760
And it's kind of like a more analog version of the Elgato Steam Deck.

255
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,400
And there's something about that I really love.

256
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:33,000
I got to get one of those because, you know, getting up to brew tea is just not civilized.

257
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,880
No, no, it's like an animal.

258
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:39,920
Actually wrote in just some really, really straightforward, simple productivity advice.

259
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:45,240
First and foremost, use a consistent note system and task management system.

260
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:50,120
Personally, I've been using a bullet journal since 2019.

261
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:51,400
The consistency is part of it.

262
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:57,600
A bullet journal is a lot of work, in my opinion, but I've kind of landed on using things for

263
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:02,240
like my personal quick tasks, like things I got to do for Christmas.

264
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,360
I use things on iOS.

265
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:09,020
And then for my work stuff, my work projects, I've taken to using Todoist because it supports

266
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:10,020
sharing.

267
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:16,440
It has a really, really light kind of a can board kind of project thing you can also share.

268
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:20,320
And it has more management with just general group stuff.

269
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:24,240
And the nice thing about Todoist is there's a bajillion integrations with tons of different

270
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,240
things.

271
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:27,200
So it's easy to get to dos in there and out and stuff like that.

272
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:32,720
So I've landed on Todoist for my work stuff and things for my personal stuff.

273
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:36,000
I think things is the best design to do app on iOS.

274
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:41,440
Longtime listener Hudson wrote in saying that the Kansas Advantage 2 keyboard made a, quote,

275
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:45,980
huge difference in the health of their hands and wrists.

276
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:46,980
This is a monster.

277
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:49,600
We've talked about it once before on the show.

278
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:52,460
It looks like something out of Star Trek, Hudson says, and he's right.

279
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:57,600
It's three hundred and fifty dollars and it's really just this different take on a keyboard

280
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:58,600
more in.

281
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:01,460
It's just better for the way our hands are actually built.

282
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:02,920
But it's a change.

283
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:04,240
That's a big step for me.

284
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:08,080
I have found going with the ergonomic split keyboards that have the little feet so they

285
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:13,080
can get positioned right are a nice intermediary step that, you know, probably a hundred hundred

286
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:18,160
dollars less or getting a really nice mechanical keyboard that doesn't bottom out when you

287
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,480
press hard.

288
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:22,000
And if you type hard, it gives you kind of a good response.

289
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
That kind of stuff helps.

290
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,140
And then changing it up can help, too.

291
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:30,940
Now we recorded early last week and we talked about Drew DeVault's complaints around Python.

292
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:35,280
And we didn't really zero in on quite what Drew was worried about, not editor, Drew,

293
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:37,180
but Randy Drew on the Internet.

294
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:38,180
And Will thinks he's nailed.

295
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:43,940
He says the rant about Python packaging is really kind of hard to suss out.

296
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:49,460
But reading through the lines, I think he spent too much time ranting about modern software

297
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:51,800
development in general.

298
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:55,200
And that's why it was, well, I don't know, pip works for me and stuff like that.

299
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:59,460
He says what he's particularly upset about is that Python leadership has so far taken

300
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:03,020
a very hands off approach to its packaging ecosystem.

301
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:08,540
Core Python has historically had some packaging tools that are old, depreciated and marked

302
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:10,640
for removal in 3.12.

303
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:14,640
Most projects use set up tools, which is an independent project, up until the last few

304
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:16,120
years.

305
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:18,960
Now set up tools has become the de facto standard.

306
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:22,120
Reading through all of this, it's kind of easy to understand how some things get a little

307
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:23,120
complicated.

308
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:26,100
And he thinks this is what Drew was really kind of complaining about because Drew is

309
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:29,980
looking at it from a perspective of wanting to be able to package this stuff in a Linux

310
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:30,980
district.

311
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:35,900
You know, something else that we haven't really touched on, but Will brings back up, is the

312
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:39,580
situation where all the Rust moderators resigned.

313
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:45,240
He says, I interpret what happened there as the mod team resigned as a move of last resort

314
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:48,300
after a back and forth with the Rust core team.

315
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:49,300
We haven't really heard much.

316
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:51,420
And I haven't seen anything else on this.

317
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:57,820
No, there was a super vague statement by the core team about how they're dedicated to like

318
00:15:57,820 --> 00:16:00,980
working with, you know, the different sub teams or something.

319
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:03,540
It was really like, I don't know.

320
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:07,740
He says there was some serious shade thrown by the outgoing mods, quote, we recommend

321
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:12,720
that the broader Rust community and the future mod team exercise extreme skepticism of any

322
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:16,260
statements by the core team claiming to illuminate the situation.

323
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:19,420
He says that's some serious shade to throw without any other context.

324
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:20,900
I think you're right, Will.

325
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:21,900
That was something.

326
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:24,620
Yeah, it's just kind of gone nowhere.

327
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:25,620
Just kind of gone nowhere.

328
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:26,620
All right.

329
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:27,620
Last one.

330
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:29,660
And I think we're done with the productivity ones for a while.

331
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:31,540
But see, what happened is people are just kind of catching up.

332
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:33,180
They're like a week or two behind.

333
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:34,620
Oh, boy.

334
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:36,820
So absolute zero had a really great one.

335
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:41,040
And it's a whole system about writing things down before you go to sleep and labeling your

336
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,860
tabs with an extension.

337
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:46,660
And what I want to do is I want to link it in the show notes because it's just probably

338
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:47,660
too long.

339
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:50,020
It's like a, let me see.

340
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:51,740
It's like a seven step system.

341
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:52,740
Jeez.

342
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:53,940
Yeah, I know.

343
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:59,340
But he says you get to your creative sweet spot a lot faster following his system.

344
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:01,580
I kind of like the idea.

345
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:04,860
And if we were doing the productivity episode today, I would probably read through it and

346
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:05,860
talk about it.

347
00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:10,020
But I wanted to get link it in the show notes just so that all of you out there, you know,

348
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:12,420
could go get it and, you know, follow Mike system.

349
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:16,140
People wrote in wondering if you have a system you follow like a daily regime.

350
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:17,140
Yeah.

351
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:19,060
So long time listeners now I've been a little sloppy with them.

352
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:22,620
I actually have to get back into it, but, uh, well, no, I used to talk a lot about the

353
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:24,180
Pomodoro technique.

354
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:28,380
It's a like 25 minutes on five minutes off for coding.

355
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:32,380
And that's on my basic dev kind of productivity hack.

356
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:36,220
Uh, and that means, you know, close Twitter, close your email.

357
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:43,100
Uh, I tend to mute Slack and, uh, I just want to just as a side note muting Slack is a power

358
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:45,900
move that I'm just going to put it out there.

359
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:46,900
Double side.

360
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:50,340
I sent an email and it said, if you're getting too many notifications and you got noise like

361
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:55,460
family members around you, use the sound canceling headphones, but don't connect them to your

362
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:57,780
machine that has the notifications like your laptop.

363
00:17:57,780 --> 00:17:59,680
Oh, it's so good, right?

364
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,220
That's the small part I never do.

365
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:02,460
And I'm going to totally do now.

366
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:03,460
Right.

367
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:07,540
Like use, use like an iPad or your phone or whatever to play whatever music and not the

368
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:08,540
device.

369
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:09,540
Right.

370
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:10,540
There's like totally D and D out or whatever.

371
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:11,540
Yeah.

372
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:12,540
That's, that's really good.

373
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:16,880
Uh, the other thing I do is I buy those little, they're called field notes like love field

374
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:17,880
notes.

375
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:18,880
Yeah.

376
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:22,940
So I like the, uh, the grid ones cause I tend to just like sketch either sketch out designs

377
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:26,220
or like database designs, UML, all that kind of good stuff.

378
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:32,020
And I don't use them as like some archive of everything, you know, for the end of time.

379
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:35,340
It's kind of, if I'm doing something or on the phone with somebody, I need to remember

380
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:36,340
something.

381
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:37,340
I just write it down.

382
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:38,340
It's weird.

383
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:39,340
I think they have a little stupid catchphrase.

384
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:42,420
I'm writing it down to remember it now, not later, which is exactly how I use them.

385
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:43,420
Same.

386
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:46,700
I have one right here and every now and then like if something comes up during the show

387
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:49,580
or you suggest something or whatever, I'll write it down.

388
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:54,500
And if I write it down, just that function, I'm probably 80% more likely to remember it.

389
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:57,960
And if I don't write it down, I'm probably a hundred percent going to forget it.

390
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:59,580
And I just use it for temporary stuff.

391
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:00,580
Right.

392
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:02,420
When I first started using paper notes, I thought I needed to put everything down and

393
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:03,540
I felt bad for not doing it.

394
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:09,140
And then I realized, no, there are a specific kind of note information that's, that's ephemeral

395
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:10,820
and is better captured when writing.

396
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:12,460
And I use it for that all the time too.

397
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:15,460
I like it.

398
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:16,980
Linode.com slash coder.

399
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:21,220
Go there to get $100 in 60 day credit on a new account and you go there to support the

400
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:22,220
show.

401
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:24,420
Linode is how I've hosted everything for the last couple of years.

402
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:28,720
In fact, I've got a massive project I'm working on there right now that'll tell you more about,

403
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:34,220
but something I started doing before I launched this new project is I switched over to creating

404
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:37,900
a flat mesh VPN between all of my Linodes.

405
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:43,440
I use the open source project called Nebula to create essentially a flat network backhaul

406
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:47,060
between the Linodes that we have in different data centers.

407
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:51,300
They've got 11 data centers around the world and Linode is their own ISP.

408
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:54,300
So their interconnects are screaming fast.

409
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:58,180
So there's a unique opportunity here to kind of create a super fast flat network between

410
00:19:58,180 --> 00:19:59,940
my machines.

411
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:03,260
But the project I'm working on, I started building it here in the studio on a Raspberry

412
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:05,180
Pi compute module.

413
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:08,260
And so I added the Nebula VPN to that compute module.

414
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:12,040
And now it's part of that same flat network as all of my Linodes, but it's actually even

415
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:16,840
better than that because when you're creating a Linode machine, you can add your SSH key

416
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:19,000
right there at that point in time.

417
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,280
When the machine's done, you just log in.

418
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:21,620
It's so great.

419
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:26,060
So I've done that and I have a master control SSH key that I've put on the Linodes that

420
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:29,980
we've deployed for about at least a year now.

421
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:34,120
So over time I'm kind of going with best practices and I'm shutting down internet SSH access

422
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:38,180
to my machines and only allowing it from the Nebula VPN.

423
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:43,240
And I have a master control Linode that I log into that's part of that Nebula VPN or

424
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:48,140
my Raspberry Pi, which is part of that Nebula VPN, or I could add any machine really.

425
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:50,860
And I can get access to these machines safely and securely.

426
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:56,060
And Linode actually takes steps and efforts to make sure that their machines are VPN friendly.

427
00:20:56,060 --> 00:21:00,380
So if you'd like to set it up as a VPN endpoint yourself or use a mesh VPN like I am, it's

428
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:03,940
very accessible and they work hard to make sure that's possible.

429
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:08,300
But what's really kind of great about Linode is they have that performance to price ratio.

430
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:12,040
They're 30 to 50% cheaper than the major hypervisors out there that want to lock you into their

431
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:13,900
crazy platforms.

432
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:16,560
And they're constantly investing in their platform.

433
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:20,780
They've been doing this for 18 years and they've stepped it up over the last five years.

434
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:24,120
I mean, it's like they just put the pedal to the metal and they've never let off.

435
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:27,680
They've recently been rolling out super fast PCIe MVME storage.

436
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:31,780
Of course, they've got the latest and greatest AMD epic processors for the data center that

437
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:33,560
are on their highest CPU end machines.

438
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:36,540
They've got 40 gigabit connections coming into those networked machines.

439
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:38,260
It's just like on and on and on.

440
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:41,560
And then on top of all of that, they've got great services you can layer in there that

441
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:47,700
take it to the next level, like object storage and cloud firewalls and a powerful DNS manager,

442
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:50,540
Kubernetes support, VLAN support.

443
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:54,240
I mean, it just is such a package.

444
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:59,400
And then to top it all off, they're supporting a big part of our community.

445
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:03,840
Not just in the media space, but some of my favorite open source projects are supported

446
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:08,320
by Linode and some of my favorite events have been supported by Linode.

447
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:12,800
They understand that kind of investing in that ecosystem pays dividends long term.

448
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:18,240
Even if they can't do a pro and con and maybe they can't necessarily like hit a key performance

449
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:22,440
indicator by doing it, they know long term it serves them because they've been part of

450
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:23,440
this community.

451
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:24,700
So go try it for real.

452
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:27,160
Go try it for yourself and support the show.

453
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:30,640
Linode.com slash coder, that's Linode.com slash coder.

454
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:39,160
Get $100 in 60 day credit on a new account and support the show, Linode.com slash coder.

455
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:42,560
There's a story going around today that we have to talk about on the show.

456
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:45,980
First of all, I really can connect with this because I have been in some surprise meetings

457
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:48,280
where everyone in the meeting got fired.

458
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:56,360
But today it came out that the CEO of Better.com fired 900 employees at once over a Zoom meeting.

459
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:57,840
It's brutal.

460
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:02,280
Somebody posted the video online and I grabbed just like 10 seconds of it.

461
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:04,840
But the whole thing you might want to go watch if you really like the cringe.

462
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:13,480
If you're on this call, you are part of the unlucky group being laid off.

463
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:18,080
Your employment here is terminated effective immediately.

464
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:21,240
Just good morning and thanks for joining us on the call today.

465
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:23,080
Hey, look, I'm real sorry.

466
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:24,080
This has been hard.

467
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:26,640
Hardest thing I've had to do for the second time in a row because apparently he's done

468
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,120
this at a previous company, too.

469
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:30,280
The 43 year old CEO has.

470
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:35,160
But quote, the market has changed and, you know, we got to do what we got to do to fulfill

471
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:36,200
our mission.

472
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:39,320
So 900 of you are gone.

473
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:42,280
900 employees in one shot.

474
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:43,280
Yeah.

475
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:44,900
All over Zoom.

476
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:48,000
Some of the American employees will get some severance and stuff like that.

477
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,160
Some of them are going to get like a package.

478
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:52,880
So they're going to get taken care of for a little bit.

479
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:55,480
But what a wild thing, huh?

480
00:23:55,480 --> 00:24:01,080
And man, I have been in this spot before where I was told that no one had been laid off in

481
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:03,080
25 years at this company.

482
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:04,920
You'll always have a job here.

483
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:08,840
And then I got called into a meeting one day and told that everyone in our department was

484
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:12,160
being laid off and being replaced by contractors.

485
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:14,160
It's a family until it isn't all of a sudden.

486
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:15,880
What do these people do?

487
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:16,880
Better.com.

488
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:17,880
Actually, let's go take a look.

489
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:18,880
I haven't done it.

490
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:21,140
Maybe somehow they've had to lay people off with a domain like that.

491
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:22,280
You'd think they'd be making money.

492
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:23,280
But Better.com.

493
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:25,160
Oh, are they down right now?

494
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:26,160
They might be down right now.

495
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:27,160
Well, they're backed by SoftBank.

496
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:31,600
Also, I don't know if you've noticed this, but there's some East Coast, West Coast bias

497
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:35,720
here because the headline is not Better.com CEO.

498
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:36,840
No, no.

499
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:42,840
The headline is New York CEO fires 900 employees on Zoom call because those East Coasters are

500
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:43,840
such jerks.

501
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:47,960
I was going to say an enlightened California CEO who's been meditating for six hours but

502
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:55,040
never just like can a bunch of people know I saw that I thought, oh, man, there's some

503
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,520
serious bias there.

504
00:24:56,520 --> 00:25:00,080
OK, so Better.com, the right mortgage could save you thousands.

505
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:02,660
So it's like some sort of mortgage grifting business, it looks like.

506
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:06,240
And they're backed by SoftBank, thus explaining how they afford the domain.

507
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:07,240
Better.com.

508
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:08,240
Got it.

509
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,240
Yeah.

510
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:10,240
They're doing stuff with mortgages.

511
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:11,240
It's not a bubble kids.

512
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:12,240
Isn't that something?

513
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:15,280
And, you know, it's not like it's super easy on the freelancer side either.

514
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:24,240
So I, if you allow, a little behind the scenes, I am working on a new Linux show.

515
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:27,320
But what happened to the M1 power hour?

516
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:29,320
That's such a great name.

517
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:33,320
We should do it just because of the name.

518
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:38,080
But you know, like you have to ask yourself as like a small shop, like, what are my core

519
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:39,080
competencies?

520
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:42,080
Like, where can I actually add value?

521
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:46,400
And for me, like, and also I have to ask the question, what do I enjoy doing?

522
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:50,760
Because if I don't enjoy doing it, I'll burn out after a while because, you know, a new

523
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:52,440
show is a big commitment.

524
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:56,600
It's something you're doing over and over and over again, potentially for as long as

525
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:57,600
possible.

526
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:00,520
You know, as close to indefinite as you can achieve.

527
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:01,520
That's the goal.

528
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:04,640
Like your goal is to create work for yourself that never ends.

529
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:05,640
Right.

530
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:09,640
So you better like it.

531
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:13,800
It's been really hard for me because I've had this really clear idea that I chicken

532
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:16,560
out and I kind of think, well, maybe I should go a different direction.

533
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:23,440
I've been chewing on this and I'll link to a blog post at Seth's blog and I like it a

534
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:24,440
lot.

535
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:25,440
It's called the freelancer's dilemma.

536
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:30,680
And he says, engaging the marketplace requires creating value for people who have a choice

537
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:35,980
and deciding what you offer your customers is your choice.

538
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:41,120
It begins by being clear about what you own and what you're good at and what gives you

539
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:42,880
satisfaction.

540
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:45,040
So I've been thinking about that recently.

541
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:47,460
I'm hoping to have it ready for the new year.

542
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:48,460
We shall see.

543
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:53,840
I don't know because it involves moving a few other things around to accommodate for

544
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:54,840
this.

545
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:57,000
But it's such a saturated market.

546
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Right.

547
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,240
But I feel like I've got something new in me that I want to do.

548
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:04,800
But I can't tell if it's just, you know, I want to scratch an itch or if I really feel

549
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:06,880
like there's a place for it in the market.

550
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:10,880
It's kind of one of those like, you know, if you really mess it up, there's not a lot

551
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,440
of room for failure.

552
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:16,300
So the consequences are pretty significant.

553
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:23,720
Maybe not irreparable in large part because we have members, but still significant.

554
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:28,040
It's possible I'll be wrapping up another show to make room for it.

555
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:31,160
You know, like that's a big decision too that has to be made.

556
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:33,560
All of that's been on my mind recently.

557
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:36,360
There's not a clear strategy available to me.

558
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:40,920
There's not really anybody in this niche that I could emulate.

559
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:44,440
And there's not really any kind of like guide to follow.

560
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:48,720
I just kind of have to decide and execute and hope for the best and then pivot if it

561
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:49,720
fails.

562
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:51,360
Can I pitch a concept?

563
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:52,360
Go for it.

564
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:59,880
We take famous like Apple World podcasters and we just like sit them down with Pop OS.

565
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:01,080
Oh man.

566
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:02,080
Anything but KD.

567
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:03,080
KD is a little too stable.

568
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:04,080
Yeah.

569
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:05,080
Something good home based.

570
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:07,200
Oh, they'd find, they'd find issues with plasma for sure.

571
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,200
Well, okay.

572
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:11,600
Well, just like I want like a Linus tech tips, like destroy your desktop environment in the

573
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:13,080
first five minutes.

574
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:14,800
Yeah, man.

575
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:15,800
That's been rough to watch.

576
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:16,800
I have to be honest.

577
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:17,800
Yeah, I did.

578
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:18,800
I just saw the most recent one.

579
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:19,800
So, so another Linux show.

580
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:23,520
No, you, so you were telling me you're not bringing Stow back for me.

581
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:24,520
Just not happening.

582
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:31,480
No, unfortunately, not unless they turn that game around and tell you what, as the editor

583
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:33,480
and chief of the network, I could do anything I want, right?

584
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:35,500
I could, I could launch Stow again.

585
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:38,040
So I've been tempted, you know, I've been tempted not to launch Stow, but I've been

586
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:42,460
tempted to do something that's kind of a new genre, a new area of coverage.

587
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:47,320
But the reality of that is, is that we have so much momentum built up around Linux and

588
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:52,400
open source software and credibility and, and resources, right?

589
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:53,400
So yeah, for sure.

590
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:57,120
Kind of the, there's a, there's a nice network effect of if I build up another Linux show

591
00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:01,120
and I spend my time doing something for that show, like learning something or talking to

592
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:05,240
somebody that's knowledge that becomes applicable to the other Linux shows as well.

593
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:08,800
So it's sort of like a network effect of, even though I'm working on multiple shows,

594
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:12,920
a rising tide sort of thing for knowledge and network connections and all that kind

595
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:13,920
of thing.

596
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:16,800
So there's a lot of advantages in that regard as well.

597
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:20,560
It's probably an area that, you know, I also have the most history with, you know, I've

598
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:22,880
been covering Linux stuff for almost 13, 14 years.

599
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:23,880
Yeah.

600
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:24,880
And you have the people, right?

601
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:29,800
If you ever need like to slot in a guest host or something, you have enough Linux gurus.

602
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:30,800
Yeah.

603
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:31,800
We'll see.

604
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:32,800
We'll see.

605
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:35,280
But so it's not always so easy on the, yeah, you know, I'm not going to necessarily get

606
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:40,660
fired tomorrow, but I could make one misstep, one miscalculation and essentially lead to

607
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:42,360
my own firing.

608
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:43,560
So it's not always easy.

609
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:44,840
Like canceling stow.

610
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:46,340
Yeah, exactly.

611
00:29:46,340 --> 00:29:47,680
Or canceling Linux action show.

612
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:50,360
I'm still hearing about that all the time.

613
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:51,560
I got an email this morning.

614
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:52,560
Yeah, but come on.

615
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:54,320
And Linux action news and Linux.

616
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:58,480
I would actually argue Linux unplugged is, you know what, let me bait the trolls.

617
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:01,240
Linux unplugged is a better version of Linux action show.

618
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:03,040
Oh, Linux unplugged.

619
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:06,740
You know, it was, if you were going to bill, I think if you were going to build last today,

620
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:08,700
you would probably just build that show really.

621
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:09,700
So you're probably right.

622
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:10,700
It would just be Linux unplugged.

623
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:12,360
You would never do last the way you did it.

624
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:16,560
You know, and we're going back into what, like the 2010s now, 2006 is I think when the

625
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:17,560
show started.

626
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:18,560
Was it really?

627
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:19,560
Yeah.

628
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:20,560
Yeah.

629
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:24,640
And then video, I think was 2008 is when we got video, I started watching it when it

630
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:25,640
was on video.

631
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:26,640
Yeah.

632
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:27,640
You would never do that again.

633
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:28,640
Well, maybe you would do video again.

634
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:29,640
I don't know.

635
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:30,640
But never that format.

636
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:33,000
I don't think because podcasting is like so mature now.

637
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:38,320
It was a product of that era, you know, and it was closer to the nineties.

638
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:39,320
So it was a little more acceptable.

639
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:44,800
Like we were really cheeky and in on like the theme music invoking nineties, Sonic the

640
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:46,400
Hedgehog vibes, right?

641
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:50,480
It was tongue in cheek, but now it would just sound extremely antiquated.

642
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:57,560
Well, and so this new show, this is a Luminary exclusive or Spotify exclusive or.

643
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:58,560
You and Joe Rogan.

644
00:30:58,560 --> 00:30:59,560
Right.

645
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:02,840
It's going to be a crypto exclusive network Christ.

646
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:06,120
You have to give your wallet, you know, you have to get on the block chain to get it.

647
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:07,120
Yeah.

648
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:08,360
You just have to invest in a little pod coin.

649
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:16,840
And then you know what I'm about to NFT the Jar Jar sound like I'm just saying.

650
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:21,660
Jupiter Party, you have been asking for it and I have finally gotten it together.

651
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:25,680
It's a membership for the entire network and for the cost of just two memberships, you

652
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:28,340
get access to everything currently.

653
00:31:28,340 --> 00:31:29,340
That's four shows.

654
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:33,660
But when that grows, you automatically get access to that as well.

655
00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:37,760
And when you're checking out, if you use the promo code, the signal, they'll get two dollars

656
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:39,460
off for a year.

657
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:43,960
So right now it's a limited time to sign up and support the entire network and get access

658
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:50,440
to the ad free version of every show to get access to the post show of self-hosted.

659
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:56,080
And of course, to get the full live version, which has tons of extra content of Linux unplugged,

660
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:59,620
all of them fully produced and ready to go in a feed for you.

661
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:03,560
And you can support the entire network for just the cost of two memberships.

662
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:08,040
So to get access and sign up right now or to give it as a gift because we've added gift

663
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:15,000
options to just go to Jupiter Party and then use the promo code the signal and get yourself

664
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,320
two dollars off for a year.

665
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:20,320
Jupiter Party, your membership makes a difference.

666
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:25,560
We're just a small, independent team doing our absolute best to make content for you

667
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:29,400
and you can help make that a reality and keep us going.

668
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:34,200
Jupiter Party, promo code the signal.

669
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:39,740
So Apple has a plan to crack the business market and I'm actually buying this one.

670
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:45,040
So Apple is beginning through partners to offer a thirty dollar a month M1 plan.

671
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:52,320
You can lease an M1 Mac for thirty bucks a month and Apple is also launching a business

672
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:56,860
essentials program that we talked about briefly on here that gives you like centralized management

673
00:32:56,860 --> 00:33:00,960
tools and free backup storage for Macs.

674
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:04,400
Sort of a similar management system to the iPhone, although I would suspect probably

675
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:06,120
not as complete.

676
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:11,920
And then additionally, on top of that, Amazon has announced that you can now get Amazon

677
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:14,720
EC2 M1 Mac instances.

678
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:18,440
You got to give them 24 hours of heads up, though, because they're racking physical

679
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:22,040
Mac minis at AWS.

680
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:25,480
There's a poor guy named John just racking up M1s.

681
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:29,680
But you know, I actually think Apple is aiming at the small business market, not the big

682
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:34,720
enterprise market, but like the hundred, two hundred size market.

683
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:37,560
And you know what I really think the sign was of that?

684
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:39,740
And I mean, it's not like I'm joking.

685
00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:42,680
I think it was adding the HDMI port back.

686
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:48,120
The only reason really for an HDMI port that isn't a higher res capable signal projectors,

687
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:49,120
projectors.

688
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:55,400
Yeah, I've been in many boring meetings where I've had to dongle up to a projector.

689
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:56,980
It's a meme at this point.

690
00:33:56,980 --> 00:33:59,480
It's a meme that Apple wants to kill.

691
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:05,280
And it's something that the that I think I think the dongle thing was felt the hardest

692
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:10,040
by offices that had to connect to different peripherals or different projectors and whatnot

693
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:12,480
or conferences and tech events.

694
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:17,880
That's where the dongle stuff really got people just like either in some situation where they

695
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:20,200
couldn't connect or, you know, just a bad taste in their mouth.

696
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:26,760
I just want to say right before Covid, like I have many times in an airport been the customer

697
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:31,200
of those stupid Best Buy vending machines that will basically sell you a bunch of dongles

698
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:33,840
for your Apple devices that should have more ports.

699
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:34,840
I see people lined.

700
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:38,840
I used to go there anymore, but I used to see people lined up there all the time getting

701
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:41,760
themselves a dongle or a pair of headphones or something like that.

702
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:45,080
And Bluetooth headphones, because, of course, they can't wire their headphones and they're

703
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:46,360
going about to get on a plane.

704
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:48,040
And that's the times when it really sucks.

705
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:51,280
The most is those situations.

706
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:55,880
But you think they got a shot here, you know, picture your hundred person company, two hundred

707
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:59,960
person company, thirty dollars a month for an M1.

708
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:04,840
And also you can buy into this Apple business essentials program where they'll provide support

709
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:06,400
and centralized management.

710
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:07,400
Think this is going to do it?

711
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:08,640
I kind of see them separately, right?

712
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:13,480
The Apple business essential support, it really, really sucks to be an MDM company now.

713
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:19,680
Because I don't see a reason unless you have some weird cross-platform needs, why you wouldn't

714
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:22,280
just issue iPhones and iPads.

715
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:26,400
And I just, just like a big part of my business used to be, and I'm sure still is for people

716
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:30,880
who are more iOS focused, is writing enterprise software for tablets, right?

717
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:31,880
For iPads.

718
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:35,560
That seems huge to me, the business essentials thing.

719
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:41,120
The hardware thing, you know, the problem with Mac OS as a business OS, I think for

720
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:47,520
a lot of like those one hundred employee companies, is if you get a new device every year, do

721
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:50,960
you also now get the new version of Mac OS?

722
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:54,680
And I think for a lot of IT departments, that's maybe not something they want.

723
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:58,540
Yeah, I think if you're going to go the Mac route, you kind of have to be committed to

724
00:35:58,540 --> 00:36:01,360
at least upgrading every other OS release.

725
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:02,360
Yeah.

726
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:04,680
Are they going to force you to, right?

727
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:08,560
Is this like the iPhone program where it's, you know, N dollars a month, then when the

728
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:10,560
new one comes out, you just automatically get it?

729
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:15,680
Because I could see that being like the IT, you know, department's headache every year.

730
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:16,680
Or is it optional?

731
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:17,680
Yeah.

732
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:18,680
I didn't read the specifics.

733
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:21,760
It might be every two years and then it's optional if you want to replace it.

734
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:22,760
But yeah.

735
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:23,760
Yes.

736
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:24,760
I follow what you're saying there.

737
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:26,200
That would be a maintenance problem.

738
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:27,200
Maintenance problem.

739
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:33,080
And I don't think a lot of enterprises anymore have like custom line of business Mac OS software.

740
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:38,960
I know we're going to get emails from folks who do, but so yeah, I mean, Microsoft does

741
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:39,960
this too, right?

742
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:43,360
They do surface, not pro, whatever they call it.

743
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:44,800
They have a plan just like this.

744
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:45,800
Right.

745
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:46,800
What about for your business?

746
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:52,120
Instead of dropping two grand on an M1, 30 bucks a month until you don't use it anymore

747
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:53,120
and then you send it back.

748
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,120
Okay.

749
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:56,080
So what if a Martini gets poured into it?

750
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:57,680
Well, I wonder, huh?

751
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:58,680
What is that?

752
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:00,000
Because they have to have some accommodations.

753
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,640
There's going to be damage to these things.

754
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:02,640
Yeah.

755
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:03,640
Exactly.

756
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:06,360
I bet it comes with apple care plus and then you can buy the additional coverage.

757
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:07,600
Ah, yeah, of course.

758
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,280
So then if it's covered by apple care, you're good.

759
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:14,800
And if apple care says screw off, you're probably just, you, you, you bought the machine.

760
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:15,880
So I don't know.

761
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:19,960
I mean, it's kind of a sweetheart deal for a business of my size cause it's just not

762
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:20,960
that much money.

763
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:21,960
Yeah.

764
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:23,920
That's what I was surprised by is it seems cheap for apple.

765
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:24,920
Yeah.

766
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:26,640
But maybe this doesn't make sense.

767
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:31,720
Like I wouldn't be surprised if you have to buy like 50 or 60 units to get this plan.

768
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:32,840
Ah, yeah, sure.

769
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:38,880
I really doubt I could get like eight, you know, you know, spend $240 a month and just

770
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:41,800
everybody gets a new M1 all the time.

771
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:43,800
That seems crazy to me.

772
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:48,280
Well maybe one way you could manage all those new Macs is a bunch of folks sent into the

773
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:56,920
show, friend of the show, Jeff Gerling's Ansible GitHub page for managing his software setup.

774
00:37:56,920 --> 00:38:01,160
He's got a playbook for setting everything up on his Mac and he just, when he gets a

775
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:03,000
new Mac, he rolls this out.

776
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:06,960
He says it automates the software on his Mac for software and web development.

777
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:08,400
Some things are difficult to automate.

778
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:12,000
So I still have to do a few manual steps, but it's all documented here.

779
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:15,120
What it would is, you know, whatever might be the exception.

780
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:18,200
And I think he gets things up and going in like 15, 20 minutes on a brand.

781
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:23,080
He goes from brand new Mac to ready for full development in about 15, 20 minutes.

782
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:24,080
That's epic.

783
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:25,080
Yeah.

784
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:30,040
It makes me kind of think, because I know I also should learn Ansible for the server

785
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:31,040
stuff.

786
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:32,640
But actually, I want to come back to that real quick.

787
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:33,640
I got to be honest.

788
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:36,040
I didn't even realize you could do anything on a Mac with Ansible.

789
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:38,680
I didn't know it was compatible with Ansible.

790
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:40,280
I assumed it was not.

791
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:42,520
So that's an area I need to learn a lot more about.

792
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:46,800
But I got a confession to make that I realized I should have been telling you on the show.

793
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:53,280
Red Hat announced that CentOS was transitioning from a standard release that follows the Red

794
00:38:53,280 --> 00:39:00,360
Hat model to a continuous delivery of minor versions called CentOS Stream.

795
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:02,160
It's not as bad as they made it sound.

796
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:09,640
What it really means is instead of waiting for like Red Hat 9.1 and 9.3 and 9.5, you

797
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:14,120
just get those little intermediary updates as after they've been QA tested and ready

798
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:15,120
to go.

799
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:20,240
That's really that's the main difference, because then they build Red Hat 9.1 or 9.2

800
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:21,400
from that work.

801
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:22,680
So it's actually it's not bad.

802
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:24,200
But Stream 8 came out.

803
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:27,260
That's when they announced it during the CentOS 8 lifetime.

804
00:39:27,260 --> 00:39:31,320
So CentOS Stream came out and it was where they were kind of proving things out.

805
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:35,220
I just talked to Carl George in Linux Action News this Sunday about this.

806
00:39:35,220 --> 00:39:39,600
It was like, OK, prove the theory works while you already have a distro that's been built

807
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:40,720
the traditional way.

808
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:43,500
Now convert that in real time to stream.

809
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:49,000
So I thought I'm going to avoid that and wait for Stream 9, which just came out and is born

810
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,880
since this whole stream idea came around.

811
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:53,280
It was created as a stream first distro.

812
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:56,460
It's the whole, you know, from tooling on, it's all built for this.

813
00:39:56,460 --> 00:40:00,880
That seemed like the distro plus it's based on Fedora 34, which is a great release of

814
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:01,880
Fedora.

815
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:10,280
It includes GNOME 40 and it's so it makes Stream 9 essentially an LTS Fedora.

816
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:12,880
Although it doesn't have all of the kernel components to make it a great desktop, it

817
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:15,720
has everything you'd really need for, you know, a development job.

818
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:20,120
So Stream 9 is it just seemed like this, oh, this is going to be this moment.

819
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:23,760
And I was going to migrate all of my studio machines over to Stream 9.

820
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:27,920
I'd been waiting since the announcement back in December.

821
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:32,720
And then it came around and I really didn't find myself all that excited.

822
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:36,280
I didn't even, it didn't even occur to me to download it.

823
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:40,960
And here I had been waiting for 11 months for this.

824
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:46,560
And then when it finally arrived, it didn't even dawn on me to download it because I was

825
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:50,320
just so disinterested now.

826
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:57,140
But you know, can you guess what it is that caught my attention, which has taken my heart

827
00:40:57,140 --> 00:41:00,480
and has made my eye drift from CentOS?

828
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:01,480
Is it SUSE?

829
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:02,480
It is.

830
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:03,480
Get out.

831
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:06,600
I am 100% serious.

832
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:07,600
Yes.

833
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:13,760
I am really, really liking Tumbleweed as a server OS.

834
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:14,760
Mm hmm.

835
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:15,760
Wait, Tumbleweed?

836
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:18,120
Oh, you're so brave.

837
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:20,000
You're so courageous on the server.

838
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,000
I'm like, no.

839
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,000
Give me the LTS.

840
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:25,960
Well, I mean, you know, we're a team of Linux guys, right?

841
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:30,080
So like when things break, we usually have it fixed in like 15 minutes if they break.

842
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:32,280
They're so leet.

843
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:33,280
You hear the condescension?

844
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:34,280
Yeah.

845
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:36,100
No, it's really because I get content out of it.

846
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:41,000
If I was just like hosting services for customers, I would probably go more with leet.

847
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,960
I like that they have the option though.

848
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:46,940
But because for us, it pays to be on the cutting edge.

849
00:41:46,940 --> 00:41:49,860
We basically do it so that way the listeners don't have to.

850
00:41:49,860 --> 00:41:51,560
Tumbleweed has been a surprise.

851
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:55,960
One of the big shifts that I made this go is I'm not using it as a desktop, which I've

852
00:41:55,960 --> 00:42:02,400
always found very frustrating, but also I'm just not using Yast that much.

853
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:04,080
I really don't.

854
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:09,300
Where I always really hit my head against the wall with SUSE is when I am using Yast

855
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:10,300
to manage software.

856
00:42:10,300 --> 00:42:13,680
And I am glad it's there for some people.

857
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:18,880
But this time around, I went and got the zipper cheat sheet and I've kept that around and

858
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:22,300
I'm doing all of my software management using zipper.

859
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:26,680
It's a great example of how you can build a nice UI around a command line tool that

860
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:30,540
displays information that is very easy to read for the end user.

861
00:42:30,540 --> 00:42:34,440
And it's easy to make decisions and weigh the pros and cons and decide what actions

862
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:35,560
I should take.

863
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:41,000
And that's in a nutshell what I'm really liking about SUSE is it feels like they've engineered

864
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:45,720
a little bit extra on top of tools that you have to use on a frequent basis to manage

865
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:52,880
your box, where Ubuntu and Arch by design, but Ubuntu specifically, it doesn't really

866
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:56,440
feel like Canonical's adding value to that layer of tooling.

867
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:58,380
They do have tools that are valuable.

868
00:42:58,380 --> 00:42:59,380
Don't get me wrong.

869
00:42:59,380 --> 00:43:02,100
Like they've built tooling around ZFS snapshots.

870
00:43:02,100 --> 00:43:06,620
They have some great tooling around firing off some quick VMs and containers and all

871
00:43:06,620 --> 00:43:07,620
of that.

872
00:43:07,620 --> 00:43:11,380
They have some good tooling, but like apt itself, that's not their domain.

873
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:12,380
That's Debian's.

874
00:43:12,380 --> 00:43:14,360
Debian isn't changing anything, right?

875
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:18,040
So it's not really going to change ever in Ubuntu until Debian does something.

876
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:22,180
Where SUSE, well, they are their own upstream.

877
00:43:22,180 --> 00:43:26,960
And if they want their package manager to be better and give the user more information,

878
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:29,000
they can just directly improve the tooling.

879
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,460
And I think over time that's begun to add up.

880
00:43:31,460 --> 00:43:35,460
And so there's nice little areas where it's like, hey man, you know, you just issued this

881
00:43:35,460 --> 00:43:40,920
command, but on Tumbleweed for safety purposes and for recovery purposes, you probably want

882
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:44,300
to use this command, but you know, your decision.

883
00:43:44,300 --> 00:43:46,060
And I really appreciate that kind of stuff.

884
00:43:46,060 --> 00:43:49,440
And it's displayed in a way where it stands out.

885
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:52,720
So it draws your attention so you don't miss the information.

886
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:55,740
And there's a lot of just nice things in that regard.

887
00:43:55,740 --> 00:43:59,020
And I have to give credit where credit is due.

888
00:43:59,020 --> 00:44:04,220
They were first to ButterFS at massive, massive deployment scale.

889
00:44:04,220 --> 00:44:08,420
And I think it was a little early when they chose to do it.

890
00:44:08,420 --> 00:44:12,500
But Fedora just got around to it, you know, three releases ago or so.

891
00:44:12,500 --> 00:44:14,520
And it's in a great state right now.

892
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:19,200
And the people out there who say ButterFS is horrible, well, I think they should take

893
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:20,200
another look.

894
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:23,980
I grant you, for my large data sets, I still use ZFS.

895
00:44:23,980 --> 00:44:31,580
But for my laptop hard drive or a boot SSD or a Raspberry Pi SD card or SSD, I'm using

896
00:44:31,580 --> 00:44:32,860
ButterFS everywhere now.

897
00:44:32,860 --> 00:44:37,240
And SUSE has been building on that for so long that they have fantastic snapshot tooling

898
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:38,240
built into all of it.

899
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:41,620
And they're really taking advantage of the ButterFS file system in a way that some distros

900
00:44:41,620 --> 00:44:43,300
are just finally getting around to.

901
00:44:43,300 --> 00:44:44,300
I'm in shock.

902
00:44:44,300 --> 00:44:51,300
I mean, part of what I really like and appreciate, their Arch version is really solid.

903
00:44:51,300 --> 00:44:54,940
I have it running on a Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4 upstairs.

904
00:44:54,940 --> 00:45:00,100
I just booted that thing off a USB stick and installed it to the eMMC like it was a hard

905
00:45:00,100 --> 00:45:03,100
drive on a regular Intel x86 PC.

906
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:09,100
I just booted off the USB stick, went through a regular install, chose the eMMC as the target

907
00:45:09,100 --> 00:45:10,100
disk.

908
00:45:10,100 --> 00:45:12,300
And my partition installed it.

909
00:45:12,300 --> 00:45:16,700
None of this flashing image and boot into a pre-installed, pre-configured environment

910
00:45:16,700 --> 00:45:20,520
that already has a login that always feels cheap on ARM devices.

911
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:22,140
It was really nice.

912
00:45:22,140 --> 00:45:27,980
And so I can run it on my ARM VMs in Parallels on the new MacBook.

913
00:45:27,980 --> 00:45:30,700
And I can run it on the Compute Module 4.

914
00:45:30,700 --> 00:45:34,740
And I'm going to be running it on the new Jupyter Broadcasting local server.

915
00:45:34,740 --> 00:45:40,940
And I think what I'm thinking about doing is learning Ansible, because I've got some

916
00:45:40,940 --> 00:45:49,540
people like Wes who can help me, and eventually just repaving the Linode JB infrastructure,

917
00:45:49,540 --> 00:45:58,340
which is a mix of CentOS and Ubuntu, and redeploy it all using Ansible on SUSE potentially,

918
00:45:58,340 --> 00:45:59,340
if it goes well.

919
00:45:59,340 --> 00:46:01,620
The next test will be a local server.

920
00:46:01,620 --> 00:46:07,060
And if our local server turns out, well, I like it with Tumbleweed, then I think that'll

921
00:46:07,060 --> 00:46:12,100
be stage three will be deployed on our Linode servers.

922
00:46:12,100 --> 00:46:16,780
And Nuke can pave all of them and redeploy on some, maybe Tumbleweed, but maybe Leap

923
00:46:16,780 --> 00:46:18,380
using Ansible.

924
00:46:18,380 --> 00:46:21,340
Probably Leap for our cloud servers.

925
00:46:21,340 --> 00:46:27,660
So you were right.

926
00:46:27,660 --> 00:46:28,660
That's the moral of the story.

927
00:46:28,660 --> 00:46:31,900
The lizard people have yet another convert.

928
00:46:31,900 --> 00:46:32,900
Congratulations.

929
00:46:32,900 --> 00:46:35,540
When we restarted the show, you held strong to it.

930
00:46:35,540 --> 00:46:36,540
And I tease you for it.

931
00:46:36,540 --> 00:46:41,380
And I admit it does go off the rails when I start using Yast, but if I stay out of Yast,

932
00:46:41,380 --> 00:46:42,540
I'm really liking it.

933
00:46:42,540 --> 00:46:44,220
And yeah, I basically use it.

934
00:46:44,220 --> 00:46:46,740
Yeah, I think you were right there.

935
00:46:46,740 --> 00:46:47,740
It is.

936
00:46:47,740 --> 00:46:48,740
All right.

937
00:46:48,740 --> 00:46:52,380
Well, we got to keep an eye on this, your ongoing reptilian adventures.

938
00:46:52,380 --> 00:46:54,060
I'll let you know how it goes in lizard land.

939
00:46:54,060 --> 00:46:57,980
It may go about, if it goes poorly, I'll report back, but hopefully it doesn't.

940
00:46:57,980 --> 00:47:02,380
Thank you to our Coder QA members out there who joined early and made this show possible.

941
00:47:02,380 --> 00:47:04,220
Thank you so much for being a member.

942
00:47:04,220 --> 00:47:08,580
The quarterly is out, and there will be another one next quarter, and you can become a member

943
00:47:08,580 --> 00:47:11,680
for the show at coderqa.co.

944
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:12,740
We appreciate you very much.

945
00:47:12,740 --> 00:47:14,720
Go find Mr. Dominic on Twitter at Dumanuku.

946
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:16,820
His company is at the Mad Botter Inc.

947
00:47:16,820 --> 00:47:18,540
Anywhere else you want to send the folks?

948
00:47:18,540 --> 00:47:23,740
I'll go to alice.dev if you've got some proprietary legacy data that you want converted into something

949
00:47:23,740 --> 00:47:24,740
useful.

950
00:47:24,740 --> 00:47:25,740
You got to go to alice.dev.

951
00:47:25,740 --> 00:47:26,740
You got to go.

952
00:47:26,740 --> 00:47:27,740
You got to.

953
00:47:27,740 --> 00:47:29,620
The podcast here is at Coder Radio Show.

954
00:47:29,620 --> 00:47:31,320
I'm thinking about changing out this outro.

955
00:47:31,320 --> 00:47:36,460
Now that Jack's out of Twitter, why am I even plugging it anymore?

956
00:47:36,460 --> 00:47:38,940
Nobody even uses Twitter.

957
00:47:38,940 --> 00:47:40,420
Go join the Matrix.

958
00:47:40,420 --> 00:47:43,980
There is a Coder Radio community on our Matrix server.

959
00:47:43,980 --> 00:47:49,540
Our Matrix server is colony.jupiterbroadcasting.com, and it's actually pretty nice.

960
00:47:49,540 --> 00:47:50,540
Go hang out there.

961
00:47:50,540 --> 00:47:51,980
There's a persistent chat on Matrix.

962
00:47:51,980 --> 00:47:52,980
Want to play around with element?

963
00:47:52,980 --> 00:47:53,980
