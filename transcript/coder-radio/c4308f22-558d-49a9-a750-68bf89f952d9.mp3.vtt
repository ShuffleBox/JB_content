This is Kota Radio, episode 384 for October 19th, 2020.

00:30.000 --> 00:33.600
Hello friends and welcome in to Kota Radio, Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show,

00:33.600 --> 00:37.200
taking a pragmatic look at the art and business of software development

00:37.200 --> 00:41.840
and the world of technology. This episode is brought to you by the all-new Cloud Guru,

00:51.200 --> 00:55.840
My name is Chris, and joining us, like the soldier here he is, is our podcast buddy,

00:55.840 --> 01:00.960
it is Mr. Dominic. Hello, Mike. Hello, Chris. That was my Oprah, and I just don't,

01:00.960 --> 01:03.600
will never do that again. Oh, so do I get a car?

01:04.960 --> 01:08.000
You get a Matchbox car. You know, she's always going to be known for that,

01:08.000 --> 01:12.320
regardless of what else she does. Did it like once, yeah. Oprah's known

01:12.320 --> 01:15.760
for giving away cars, and you're known for spilling stuff on laptops.

01:17.360 --> 01:22.960
Well, I see we're starting classy here today. I just cannot believe it. You know, sometimes I

01:22.960 --> 01:30.480
check your Twitter feed before the show. Yeah, so here's the thing. I have a deep-seated hatred

01:30.480 --> 01:38.320
of MacBooks, apparently. Whether it be gin, beer, or in this case, herbal tea, I cannot somehow

01:38.320 --> 01:45.120
keep them dry. What you got to figure is perhaps you suspend the laptop in air and use a Bluetooth

01:45.120 --> 01:49.680
keyboard, then you're only out a Bluetooth keyboard. See, I got a strategy for you.

01:49.680 --> 01:56.400
Well, a not insignificant number of people on Twitter recommended a ThinkPad that actually has

01:56.400 --> 02:02.080
holes in it for just this purpose. Yes, some ThinkPads have drain holes that actually drain.

02:02.080 --> 02:08.080
Now, if it's an entire glass of liquid, you're still kind of pushing the limits of the gutter

02:08.080 --> 02:15.200
system in the ThinkPad. I also saw some people tweeted at you like a water bottle that has a

02:15.200 --> 02:21.840
suction bottom that sticks to your table. Yes, I believe Emma from System76 recommended a sippy cup.

02:21.840 --> 02:24.960
I mean, that could be another solution. Maybe you already have some around the house, too.

02:27.200 --> 02:35.520
However, other than the trackpad, it is fine. Oh, really? That's good. I want to picture the

02:35.520 --> 02:39.920
moment. Did you spring into some kind of action? Do you have a protocol at this point you follow,

02:39.920 --> 02:44.560
like a standard operating procedure for this situation? I actually do. We have a dedicated

02:44.560 --> 02:50.000
giant bag of rice for this. There you go. The bag of rice, man. It does wonders.

02:50.000 --> 02:57.120
Well, I'm glad you're able to save it. And, you know, it's like being home again. I keep saying

02:57.120 --> 03:02.560
it's like we're in 2017 all over again. And I thought, you know, this would be the last episode

03:02.560 --> 03:09.040
where we'd talk about SUSE. I don't think we got very much email about it. But the lizards brought

03:09.040 --> 03:14.960
a gift for Mr. Dominic, an actual gift. So Kevin, who started this all. Thank you, Kevin. Sent me

03:14.960 --> 03:22.320
two rather large SUSE pillows, lizard pillows. Oh, yeah. And roughly 30 Linux. I think it's

03:22.320 --> 03:27.200
Linux user and developer. But the issue where they featured SUSE, of course, of the same issue. So

03:27.200 --> 03:34.320
30 copies. Now, the lady where I still have a small office space who got the mail was deeply

03:34.320 --> 03:41.040
confused. I mean, she's like, did you order like all of the same magazine? I said, what's on that

03:41.040 --> 03:47.520
magazine? Some lizard. I'm like, oh, I still have some boxes of of SUSE around here in the studio.

03:47.520 --> 03:53.120
Well, so for Halloween this year, every kid is getting a SUSE DVD. I thought you were kidding.

03:53.120 --> 03:56.800
But then then I saw you tweeting something ridiculous like you don't know Linux until

03:56.800 --> 04:00.880
you. Yes. And then I thought, wait a minute. Now, what is going on? What is happening to

04:00.880 --> 04:06.160
to my co-host? I think he's being sucked into the dark side. You know this already, but I am working

04:06.160 --> 04:11.760
on an initiative that should be done by Christmas if you believe people that give estimates that I

04:11.760 --> 04:19.200
don't believe. But let's say the New Year and it does involve SUSE and it involves something that

04:19.200 --> 04:24.640
requires permitting. Is this karma coming back here? So SUSE is a requirement of an application,

04:24.640 --> 04:31.280
I take it? Yes. But I'm going a bit beyond that. Oh, oh, oh. You mean you're enjoying it?

04:31.280 --> 04:38.080
Let's just say in a hypothetical world, you are a biologist, a professor at NYU. Your student's

04:38.080 --> 04:43.120
name is Peter Parker. You lost your arm in an awful accident and you're thinking what animal

04:43.120 --> 04:48.880
can regenerate limbs? Right. Of course. Of course. And if you notice, if eagle eyed Twitter users

04:48.880 --> 04:53.920
will notice that your Coder radio announcement, I responded with the most beloved Spider-Man.

04:53.920 --> 04:59.440
I would say hero, not villain. The lizard. I mean, he's just misunderstood, right? I think

04:59.440 --> 05:04.320
also a SUSE user. It's the random German in his notes that sort of throws people off. But really,

05:04.320 --> 05:10.160
I mean, so I am not kidding at all. I am doing some a lot of SUSE stuff and it's going to and

05:10.160 --> 05:15.200
Kevin in particular is going to be excited. So is Johan. That is legitimately the other guy's name

05:15.760 --> 05:20.560
because of course it is. And I'm assuming a number of Hans and maybe a few Gretels. But

05:20.560 --> 05:28.800
yeah. So get ready for the SUSE action show. And how is the experience? I know it's early days

05:28.800 --> 05:35.200
and all, but have you lost any limbs or is it actually going OK? It has gone surprisingly

05:35.200 --> 05:43.040
smooth. Now, that is scaring me. Right. This is something I greenlit like last week, literally

05:43.040 --> 05:49.200
on Thursday. And, you know, I had some preliminary conversations over like the last month and

05:49.200 --> 05:54.480
everything that was supposed to be an impediment didn't impede. Now, I don't know if it's like

05:55.200 --> 06:01.920
because covid people are being more reasonable or if it's something bad is going to happen and

06:01.920 --> 06:06.560
delay this whole thing. You know what I mean? But it hasn't happened yet. So I don't know. You know

06:06.560 --> 06:10.320
how I am, Chris. I'm a little skeptical when things look too easy. But yeah, like why is it

06:10.320 --> 06:14.960
going so good? Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait a minute. I can't get like a pizza delivered

06:14.960 --> 06:20.240
correctly. And I'm in Florida, so there is no pizza. So like why is this working? Yep.

06:21.200 --> 06:27.680
Or or is the answer the superior technology that I'm using now? Of course. Right.

06:27.680 --> 06:32.880
Hashtag lizard people. Wow. So I thought we were all done with it. Just took a hard turn.

06:32.880 --> 06:38.000
And now you're turning into a SUSE user. And I'm struggling to do what to do with that.

06:38.000 --> 06:44.160
You know, it's just well, here's what you do. Give me six months. Then you have me on Linux

06:44.160 --> 06:52.080
unplugged and we just listen to the groaning of your regular host. I like them just who's in the

06:52.080 --> 06:58.800
IRC. He says Mike has committed suicide. Wow. That's good. Good stuff. I am actually legally

06:58.800 --> 07:03.280
required to only drink German beer now, though. So there's that. Well, you could find worse,

07:03.280 --> 07:08.400
I suppose. Well, we did get a bunch of feedback from the dark matter developers that we pleaded

07:08.400 --> 07:13.680
with. So I picked a couple of them because a lot of them are long and detailed, like somebody who

07:13.680 --> 07:20.160
would be a good employee would. So a non writes in, he says, Greetings from the dark matter side.

07:20.160 --> 07:26.000
I work in the darkest of dark matter environments. It's large, very, very large U.S. company. And the

07:26.000 --> 07:31.120
code is mostly in Java and TypeScript. Oh, interesting. And is part of an entire ecosystem

07:31.120 --> 07:38.240
of software that exists within our part of the organization. None of that software ecosystem is

07:38.240 --> 07:44.400
exposed to the outside world, and most things are internal to just this division of the company.

07:44.880 --> 07:49.280
This does not mean that it is boring, though. The software has many users that need to get their

07:49.280 --> 07:54.400
job done, and it contributes to a good experience to our end users. And I think in the end, that's

07:54.400 --> 07:57.920
what counts. If you have any other questions about life in the dark world, though, I'd be happy to

07:57.920 --> 08:02.400
answer them. Of course, I do have health benefits because I'm not living in the crazy U.S. So

08:02.400 --> 08:08.720
everyone has access to health care they need here in Sweden. God damn Germans. Sorry. I know he's

08:08.720 --> 08:12.880
a Sweden working for a large U.S. company. How about that? We get in Sweden health care.

08:15.520 --> 08:19.920
I got to figure that out, man. I got to move to Canada or something. I got to get it. You know,

08:19.920 --> 08:25.520
Munich is looking better every day. Also, he he wrote about Sousa. OK, so there was some Sousa

08:25.520 --> 08:31.280
follow up. Yes. I forgot. He says the value of open Sousa is not that it's the most polished

08:31.280 --> 08:38.400
distro out there. I'll give that a ding. Neither does it boast a especially well thought out and

08:38.400 --> 08:42.960
opinionated user experience. These things together mean that I generally recommend open Sousa to

08:42.960 --> 08:47.280
people that I just want to use their computer like an appliance. I set up the family and I

08:47.280 --> 08:52.560
support it with Mint. And lately I've started moving some of them to Manjaro. I do love open

08:52.560 --> 08:57.440
Sousa, though, because I used it quite heavily and was influenced by its governing model. And

08:57.440 --> 09:02.160
I think it's one of the better things it has. Yeah, you know, the distro governance is like a

09:02.160 --> 09:08.000
whole other thing about this. Talk about a lizard's nest. He says the lizards just never give up.

09:09.440 --> 09:14.240
You'll never hear the end of the feedback to the open Sousa bashing. Oh, my God.

09:15.680 --> 09:21.600
What have I done to myself? You know, I was between Darwin, BSD and Sousa. I was between

09:21.600 --> 09:26.160
BSD and Sousa. What can I say? Yeah. Yeah. I guess it could have been worse. I could have gone

09:26.160 --> 09:29.760
after the Mac. God only knows what I probably would have somebody show up at my house. Oh,

09:29.760 --> 09:34.880
well, hang on. So he's dark matter. And didn't the TypeScript thing seem weird to you? Oh, yeah.

09:34.880 --> 09:40.240
Thanks for remembering that. Yeah. Right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's awfully modern. I wonder if you

09:40.240 --> 09:43.520
could chime in on that. He said if we had any follow up questions, like, did you get to choose

09:43.520 --> 09:48.080
that? That's the part I think we're really curious about is how much of the tool chain do you get to

09:48.080 --> 09:54.880
pick versus like you're told, use this ID or use this language. So I do wonder if like DarkScript

09:54.880 --> 09:59.360
was forced on them because of like the type checking and maybe they have some sort of way to,

09:59.360 --> 10:04.240
I don't know, they feel the enterprise feels safer. I don't know. You know, I'm grasping

10:04.240 --> 10:11.680
at straws for that one. Well, yeah. Boy, are you right? I mean, TypeScript, I think is it's a very

10:11.680 --> 10:18.000
that's not conservative choice, but it's a safe choice. It is a safe choice. Runs great on SUSE.

10:18.000 --> 10:21.760
So another Anon writes in, nobody wanted their name used. Hey, Chris and Mike,

10:21.760 --> 10:25.520
I'm definitely on the dark matter side of the spectrum, but I've got some unique perspective.

10:25.520 --> 10:29.920
So I figured I'd give you an insight on my job. I won't mention the company I work for,

10:29.920 --> 10:35.120
but it is a large corporation you have definitely heard of and maybe even own products from,

10:35.120 --> 10:41.200
but they no longer make consumer products. All right. He says my department is relatively small

10:41.200 --> 10:45.600
in, you know, comparison to the rest of the company on the order of a few hundred employees.

10:45.600 --> 10:51.520
And we do a small-scale TD. So you know how many employees I have? One.

10:54.240 --> 11:00.000
So his small department, which is a couple hundred, I'm sorry, a few hundred employees,

11:00.000 --> 11:04.320
and they do small scale government contracting, building hardware and software for them.

11:04.320 --> 11:09.440
For the most part, the job is very corporate. I get decent insurance, average pay and great

11:09.440 --> 11:15.840
retirement benefits and my very own cubicle all in exchange for a sane number of hours.

11:15.840 --> 11:19.440
You may think doing development work, I spend 40 hours a week writing Java 8,

11:19.440 --> 11:23.600
but I actually get to play with a spectrum of tools, including C and C++, Python,

11:23.600 --> 11:29.840
TensorFlow, Docker, and JavaScript. Okay. It is not bad. He goes on to say,

11:29.840 --> 11:34.160
as for the actual tools, read computers, it's complicated because we have many different

11:34.160 --> 11:38.320
networks and computers for different security levels. In general, the business machines

11:38.320 --> 11:43.920
run Windows and development machines run Ubuntu. Our Windows machines were just upgraded from

11:43.920 --> 11:51.040
Windows 7 to Windows 10 in January. And our Ubuntu machines run the LTSs from 1404 to the latest.

11:51.600 --> 11:52.960
Sounds like government contracted to me.

11:54.560 --> 11:58.640
We are fully integrated with G Suite. Oh, interesting. So they use Gmail and Drive

11:58.640 --> 12:02.560
and they use Meet and all of that stuff. Machines without internet access, we're

12:02.560 --> 12:08.560
just upgraded from Office 2007 to 2016. That's interesting. Coronavirus changes,

12:08.560 --> 12:12.400
he says, were also a bit of a mixed bag. Corporate didn't lay anyone off, which is awesome.

12:13.040 --> 12:17.200
But benefits were temporarily reduced, which that's weird during a pandemic, huh?

12:17.840 --> 12:21.840
To reduce the benefits. It's like extra mean, right? Come on.

12:21.840 --> 12:24.800
I guess it's better than getting laid off, though. He goes on to say most of the company is still

12:24.800 --> 12:29.360
working from home to this day, but due to the nature of our work, about 90 percent of my

12:29.360 --> 12:33.600
department is back in the office. Personally, I'm kind of somewhere in between. Most of my work can

12:33.600 --> 12:38.560
be done from home. But honestly, I find it so much easier to focus in my gray walled cube than at

12:38.560 --> 12:46.160
home. Hope this gives you some valuable insights. Huh? It's that transition to working at home was

12:46.160 --> 12:50.480
difficult for him, it sounds like. Had to go back to the office. Yeah, there's probably a bunch of

12:50.480 --> 12:55.840
security concerns like equipment or systems that can never touch a network. I was really lucky

12:55.840 --> 12:59.440
during the peak of the lockdown because, you know, there was a point where Washington locked down

12:59.440 --> 13:05.520
pretty significantly and I'm the only one in the studio right now. So and I still to this day,

13:05.520 --> 13:11.280
I mostly just go from home to the studio because I don't I don't want to get sick. I do. I do go

13:11.280 --> 13:16.240
out more now than I used to, but it's still pretty limited. I'm still being careful and I'd never

13:16.240 --> 13:22.320
really had to worry about staying at home per se because I just get in one box and then drive to

13:22.320 --> 13:27.360
the next box. So I've been pretty lucky in that regard. I didn't really have to do much remote

13:27.360 --> 13:32.720
work as it were. Yeah, I I miss an office like a lot. Yeah. You know what? Four year olds, man.

13:33.280 --> 13:40.080
Yes. Yes. Very much so. Very much. That's you know, when I when I had kids is when I moved out

13:40.080 --> 13:46.320
of the house and and got the studio going because I didn't want to be I didn't want to be chasing

13:46.320 --> 13:50.000
after them to quiet down all the time because they're kids. You know, it's natural. Get off my

13:50.000 --> 13:56.080
lawn. OK, we have one more dark matter dev that I'm going to cover today, but they all just kind

13:56.080 --> 14:01.680
of came into the light. Well, we kind of remember what we did, right? Is we gave him a bag. Yeah,

14:01.680 --> 14:06.240
we gave him a hard time last week. Yeah. And I actually would like it. I'm not necessarily

14:06.240 --> 14:08.960
done with the topic. So if you have thoughts on this, if you're listening to this and want to

14:08.960 --> 14:13.200
share your insights, please do go to Coder dot show slash contact. We'll keep it anonymous.

14:13.200 --> 14:17.680
Don't have to say your name or the company. Speaking of that, totally anon wrote in and he's

14:17.680 --> 14:22.160
a dark matter developer at a company that does it as a service. I'm writing him because you asked

14:22.160 --> 14:26.320
about your nine to five guys. I work at an I.T. service company that does everything from the

14:26.320 --> 14:32.000
help desk to outsourcing all the back end I.T. and development for our customers. That said,

14:32.720 --> 14:38.640
I am on the sys admin side with some dev ops. I get handed what I get to use depending on the

14:38.640 --> 14:43.920
customer I support. So I have a few laptops on my desk for each customer, along with my company

14:43.920 --> 14:49.120
laptop that I have remote desktop applications, VMware, Horizon and Citrix to remote into the

14:49.120 --> 14:54.320
customers who don't give me a laptop. That said, I don't really get to choose what tools I use

14:54.320 --> 14:59.360
because everything's on the customer and in their environment. However, with some of our customers,

14:59.360 --> 15:04.640
we have been pushing new tech like Kubernetes, but most of them only really accept OpenShift

15:04.640 --> 15:09.840
because of Red Hat's backing. And my job is currently to manage those hosted clusters.

15:09.840 --> 15:15.280
As for the final parts, well, we do work from home for full time now unless we need to go into

15:15.280 --> 15:20.000
an office till the end of the year. That said, before COVID, we got to pick two days a week that

15:20.000 --> 15:24.880
we worked from home. And because so many of the clients that we support their entire back end

15:24.880 --> 15:29.600
networks, which is not really a lot of them, we get to use flex time. And that means when I have

15:29.600 --> 15:35.600
to go there on off hours, I can apply that. So it's nice to have some insurance, especially when

15:35.600 --> 15:41.840
the pandemic is going on during trying times. And it sounds like, this is me now, sounds like totally

15:41.840 --> 15:46.640
a non-company was pretty well set up for work from home because they were letting you pick

15:46.640 --> 15:50.400
two days a week. Yeah, I wonder what the transition would probably nothing, right?

15:50.400 --> 15:55.200
Must have been much simpler, right? It had to have been. He goes on to say that they're kind

15:55.200 --> 16:00.000
of just slowly going back to work at the office. And then our last bit of feedback, Mr. Dominic,

16:00.000 --> 16:05.840
was from Oded and he wanted to follow up on a kind of a point of clarification on our Google

16:05.840 --> 16:12.560
versus Oracle coverage last week. So he takes issue with the claim that we said where it appeared

16:12.560 --> 16:17.680
that Google had copied some stuff line for line. What it was actually what they had copied was

16:17.680 --> 16:24.320
something that was put in there by a different group and was just basic licensing stuff.

16:24.880 --> 16:29.760
The version that was released publicly had all the comments and stuff removed. So it wasn't so

16:29.760 --> 16:33.920
much that it was more of like language wording that they had copied word for word, which Google

16:33.920 --> 16:38.400
would normally do, which kind of actually makes that Oracle argument. Well, a little flaccid.

16:38.400 --> 16:43.520
It's one of their better claims. And it's kind of that is one that isn't particularly going to hold

16:43.520 --> 16:47.920
up. He doesn't think he wrote in with all the details. But essentially what happened was Apache

16:47.920 --> 16:53.760
Harmony added some stuff to the to the top of the file. Google copied that stuff. And that's what

16:53.760 --> 17:00.480
Oracle's pointing to. So this is super weird. No, it's and it's so nuanced to really first that we

17:00.480 --> 17:03.520
got to see him. I'm like, this guy's crazy. Let me just, you know, find the New York Times article

17:03.520 --> 17:08.960
and look, bam, you're wrong. He is right in that it is something from Apache. What Oracle is

17:08.960 --> 17:15.040
claiming is that by apparently, quote unquote, decompiling it and copying the comments on the

17:15.040 --> 17:21.920
top of the file, that the comments would be copywritten because they compiled it. I mean,

17:21.920 --> 17:28.560
it's it's like wacky. Yeah. Like, so it's weird. I mean, I have you know what? It's been a decade.

17:28.560 --> 17:33.760
I know. Can't mom and dad stop fighting now, right? Like, oh, no. And I have to get now has

17:33.760 --> 17:38.320
to go all the way to the Supreme Court. It's just so ridiculous. Dang it. Thank you, though,

17:38.320 --> 17:41.760
everyone, for the feedback. Lots of good feedback. We'd like to get yours. It's a big part of our

17:41.760 --> 17:46.880
show and helps us get going every episode. So coder dot show slash contact to send yours in

17:46.880 --> 17:53.600
Lino dot com slash coder. Go there to get a one hundred dollars, sixty day credit towards a new

17:53.600 --> 17:58.480
account. Linode is our cloud hosting provider of choice. I started using Linode two years ago for

17:58.480 --> 18:04.160
J.B. and I love it. I first really started for myself personally. And then as J.B. was going to

18:04.160 --> 18:09.440
go independent, I just began spinning up new infrastructure on Linode. Linode actually started

18:09.440 --> 18:16.000
in 2003 as one of the very first companies in cloud computing three years before AWS,

18:16.000 --> 18:20.160
because their Linux users and they saw the features and capabilities that were coming

18:20.160 --> 18:25.280
to the Linux kernel and realized they could leverage that and create what we call today

18:25.280 --> 18:32.240
the cloud. And Linode has really, really innovated over the years. Their cloud dashboard nails it.

18:32.240 --> 18:36.720
It makes it so simple for me to spin up a machine. I think the moment, though, I was most impressed

18:36.720 --> 18:42.160
with the cloud dashboard was when I had an existing system and I added a new disk. Not

18:42.160 --> 18:46.640
only was that just crazy simple, if I didn't even know what these device names were or anything

18:46.640 --> 18:51.280
like that, they had me covered. And when you do know, it's even better because there's one

18:51.280 --> 18:55.520
click away and they give you all the advanced options that you would want as an advanced user.

18:55.520 --> 18:58.720
And then after you create the disk, it comes up with a screen that gives you all the commands

18:58.720 --> 19:02.560
you might want to use in the host operating system to actually attach that disk now.

19:02.560 --> 19:07.440
Like, how do you do that, actually? Well, here are the commands and they're independently owned.

19:07.440 --> 19:12.320
And I like that a lot. Well, you know, some companies will get VC backing and they'll go real strong

19:12.320 --> 19:18.240
and real hard for a while. But when it's your infrastructure, when it's your systems, you want

19:18.240 --> 19:23.760
to know what happens after that funding train runs out. Since Linode's been around since 2003

19:23.760 --> 19:29.760
and independently owned and operated, that's not a concern with them. They're dedicated to

19:29.760 --> 19:34.720
offering the best virtualized cloud computing. If it runs on Linux, it runs on Linode. So go to

Quick recommendation on using your $100 at Linode. Chris, you know what you can do with that?

20:17.680 --> 20:18.560
What's that?

20:18.560 --> 20:20.720
Spend a bunch of SUSE leap servers.

20:21.440 --> 20:23.360
They do have it on there. That's true.

20:23.360 --> 20:24.640
They have open SUSE.

20:24.640 --> 20:27.920
That's right. That's right. Linode.com slash coder.

20:29.760 --> 20:33.840
All right, Mr. Dominic, you ready to move into the hoopla? Because of course.

20:33.840 --> 20:35.680
I have been pining for this.

20:35.680 --> 20:41.600
I you know, this is what happened, man, is they had the big event the day after our show and it

20:41.600 --> 20:44.800
ends up there's a couple of things in there that are worth talking about. And then we got to wait

20:44.800 --> 20:49.600
a week. So we're going to just get this out of our systems right now. Last week, Apple announced

20:49.600 --> 20:53.120
the iPhone 12, which is a whole bunch of them, a whole zany lineup.

20:53.120 --> 20:55.520
Who cares about that? HomePod mini go.

20:56.400 --> 21:03.440
HomePod mini. Yeah, that's really all that matters. I am legitimately excited about this.

21:03.440 --> 21:06.240
I will be buying at least a few of these.

21:06.240 --> 21:06.960
Of course you will.

21:08.240 --> 21:13.040
Now, I mean, I think this is a sleeper product that people don't appreciate. And I think the

21:13.040 --> 21:18.320
reason is, is the price. And this is significantly cheaper. It's ninety nine dollars versus like,

21:18.320 --> 21:22.000
what, three hundred dollars for the other HomePod, which is a total barrier.

21:22.000 --> 21:24.160
Wait, is that still three hundred bucks?

21:24.160 --> 21:28.000
Crazy Apple just doesn't drop their prices, dude. They never drop their prices.

21:28.000 --> 21:29.520
That's a lot of money.

21:29.520 --> 21:33.040
Every now and then they put them on sale through third party sellers like Best Buy.

21:33.040 --> 21:34.160
And that's how I bought mine.

21:34.160 --> 21:37.200
Well, then you spent twelve hundred dollars on HomePods.

21:37.200 --> 21:39.920
No, I got one hundred dollars off on a couple of my HomePods. So.

21:39.920 --> 21:40.240
OK.

21:40.240 --> 21:47.200
Yeah, but these are ninety nine dollars. And I think what people fail to understand

21:47.200 --> 21:53.120
about the HomePod is that it can execute any shortcut you create on your iPhone or your iPad.

21:53.120 --> 21:57.200
That is tremendously powerful because they integrate with all of the apps,

21:57.200 --> 22:00.480
all you know, all of the automations that Apple's built into iOS

22:01.120 --> 22:04.480
can be executed from the HomePod. And that's massive.

22:04.480 --> 22:07.680
And it has HomeKit. So in theory, and I find this hard to believe, but

22:08.320 --> 22:13.600
you're kind of the expert on this one. If I had a shortcut that integrated with some HomeKit

22:13.600 --> 22:20.000
devices. Right. Could I just like tell the HomePod to, you know, do that? No. Right.

22:20.000 --> 22:21.040
All day long.

22:21.040 --> 22:21.680
Seriously.

22:21.680 --> 22:22.240
All day long.

22:22.240 --> 22:24.480
So if you have those like fancy Philips lights or whatever.

22:24.480 --> 22:31.280
Oh, yeah. Yeah. And HomeKit ties in really great with the open source home assistant

22:31.280 --> 22:38.400
software that I use. So Siri has become my voice assistant for my own locally self-hosted

22:38.400 --> 22:44.400
home assistant instance through HomeKit. And I can automate things using HomeKit.

22:44.400 --> 22:51.360
And it's fast because it's all on the LAN. And the other thing about the HomePod specifically is

22:51.360 --> 22:57.040
it, I believe, has the best microphones of the bunch. And a lot of times these smart

22:57.040 --> 23:00.800
assistants kind of fall down when you have a fan going and it creates white noise,

23:01.360 --> 23:05.680
or maybe your TV is too loud. Out of all of the home assistants that I have tested,

23:05.680 --> 23:11.520
HomePod breaks through the noise the most often. And she understands you well. Like it's cliche

23:11.520 --> 23:16.080
to give Siri a hard time. But when you're using her in a HomeKit capacity, it's just,

23:16.800 --> 23:24.000
hey phone, hey slow mo, turn on lamp, turn on heater. And it just it does it immediately.

23:24.400 --> 23:28.560
Plus, it sounds the best. So if you're in the iOS ecosystem, which is the big caveat,

23:28.560 --> 23:33.520
I think why it doesn't get as much love as it should. It just is brilliant. It shows

23:33.520 --> 23:37.680
up in your AirPlay list of devices. You can manage it as an AirPlay device. That brings

23:37.680 --> 23:43.520
it into the realm of home theater. Because if you have an Apple TV, the Apple TV and the HomePods

23:43.520 --> 23:48.640
are aware of their general locations. And they will treat the HomePods, if like they're behind

23:48.640 --> 23:55.120
you, as rear speakers. And so the way it automatically works at my place is the sound bar

23:55.120 --> 24:01.920
becomes our vocals, our center channel. And then the HomePods become the surround sound system.

24:01.920 --> 24:06.960
Automatically, without me ever telling it to, I just, in the AirPlay menu, checked the HomePods

24:06.960 --> 24:10.480
and their pairs, right? And they automatically figure out which side's left and which side's

24:10.480 --> 24:13.600
right. Well, you tell them that. But once you tell them that, they automatically figure out who's

24:13.600 --> 24:19.600
supposed to do what load. And so you get terrific sound. You get a surround sound environment that

24:19.600 --> 24:24.720
is completely wireless, which is fantastic for me because I can't run wires in my current condition

24:24.720 --> 24:30.240
certain situation. And on top of that, you get all of the power of any shortcut you can

24:30.240 --> 24:34.560
fancy and any device that supports HomeKit. And oh, if you're crazy enough to go all the way into

24:34.560 --> 24:39.200
open source Home Assistant, it's also the best voice assistant with that as well. And it's a

24:39.200 --> 24:44.480
good speaker just to listen to podcasts or music on. And these minis come in now at $99. Well,

24:44.480 --> 24:49.360
think about how you could use that in a surround sound environment. How easily it would be to maybe

24:49.360 --> 24:54.400
put one near your couch and fill out a little bit of the sound there. Or maybe, you know, put one on

24:54.400 --> 24:58.240
the counter where I'm at and I hear a little bit of sound coming from that. So I'm really excited

24:58.240 --> 25:02.480
about how not only could I get more voice automation in places where I couldn't afford to

25:02.480 --> 25:08.800
put a Home Assistant before, but also I can fill out my existing system a little bit better, which

25:08.800 --> 25:13.600
I also think is going to be great because they just work together so easily. Damn, I might have

25:13.600 --> 25:17.760
to get one. I mean, they sound great, too. And I don't know about the minis. Well, at $99, it's

25:17.760 --> 25:24.480
like even if it doesn't work out right. Yeah. Yeah, I get that it's funny at, you know, $300.

25:24.480 --> 25:30.000
And of course, you have to have an iPhone or an iPad or an Apple TV to make it worth it. So I get

25:30.000 --> 25:34.080
it right, especially for Android users or people that are deep into the Google ecosystem. It's

25:34.080 --> 25:39.360
silly. But man, there's a lot of iPhone users out there. I'm not trying to shill for Apple here.

25:39.360 --> 25:44.640
I would love for this to be made by anybody. Anybody who made a product like this sounds good,

25:44.640 --> 25:50.240
easy to pair, excellent home automation assistant that ties in with my self-hosted local home

25:50.240 --> 25:56.400
automation system. And it all works over the land. So when I'm off grid in my RV, I still can use

25:56.400 --> 26:01.040
the home pods. I don't have to have Google intermediary and a proxy connection to send

26:01.040 --> 26:06.240
audio or video. It's all over the land. I mean, it's just there's a lot of advantages there that

26:06.240 --> 26:11.120
people don't consider because, you know, really, I think I think Amazon has stolen the mindspace

26:11.120 --> 26:16.160
here. They've really kind of nailed it because they've executed just consistently on the Alexa

26:16.160 --> 26:22.560
product. But, you know, I literally try these things side by side. And I think you can you

26:22.560 --> 26:28.000
could confidently say you can do more with an echo. But the core things I care about the home

26:28.000 --> 26:34.000
pod is just focused on like three things. And it does those really well. It's very Apple style,

26:34.000 --> 26:38.640
I suppose. So would you recommend for like a home pod version just to go with the fancy one?

26:38.640 --> 26:45.120
Or I don't know. You know, I'm not sure. I kind of think maybe not. I think I would buy two of the

26:45.120 --> 26:51.440
minis than one. Oh, they can do the thing where they talk to each other and like, oh, it's not

26:51.440 --> 26:56.800
quite as sophisticated yet as the big pods. Right. But there is they can at least stereo pair up.

26:56.800 --> 27:01.760
So you still you get two home pod minis and you're still not even at the price of one home pod.

27:02.720 --> 27:07.040
And the only thing that I noticed that Apple did is they called this the home pod family.

27:07.040 --> 27:13.120
Now, which I don't know. It might suggest there's some more coming. And I find it fascinating that

27:13.120 --> 27:17.280
they're cramming decent CPUs into these tiny little things like this thing has the S5 chip.

27:17.280 --> 27:21.360
What do you make of yourself? I mean, yeah, but I think it makes it. I think it matters

27:21.360 --> 27:25.760
having a faster CPU in the system. I think it I think it matters. Do you have any thoughts on the

27:25.760 --> 27:29.280
on the other stuff that they announced? Like the I mean, they've got like a whole smattering

27:29.280 --> 27:35.360
of iPhones now. Buckle up. Let's talk about 5G for a moment. All right. I was a little surprised.

27:35.360 --> 27:41.200
I have the blatant Verizon commercial at the beginning of the I guess, you know, we still

27:41.200 --> 27:47.040
call them Kinos, I guess. Yeah, I sort of don't understand why they're pushing the 5G thing so

27:47.040 --> 27:52.000
hard, given that unless you live in like literally New York and San Francisco and some other

27:52.000 --> 27:57.760
metropolitan areas, you probably don't even have good LTE. Yeah. And you're not going to have a

27:57.760 --> 28:02.960
good 5G. And it's not like you're not going to have it for like six months. Yeah. I mean, let's say

28:02.960 --> 28:08.400
I know people like the first cash is saying like a year, I would say, especially if you're like out

28:08.400 --> 28:12.720
down here in Florida, it's like five years. And also, you may not always want 5G, right?

28:12.720 --> 28:16.400
Because you know, more power drain. That's why they had to make a point to say that John's 5G

28:16.400 --> 28:20.160
and Jim's 5G might not be the same, which I think is always amazing that the telcos get away with

28:20.160 --> 28:25.680
that. I mean, maybe it's just me, but did it strike you as weird that they were talking so much

28:25.680 --> 28:31.520
about a network that basically doesn't exist? Yeah. And and especially in the United States,

28:31.520 --> 28:39.200
and especially given in the past, they've never really made much fuss except for the iPhone 3G,

28:39.200 --> 28:44.480
which is going quite a ways back to see Apple make a fuss about the radio technology.

28:44.480 --> 28:48.080
I think there's a couple of things at play here. I think it's good to signal that

28:48.080 --> 28:51.920
Apple is leading here from their position, from a strategic position.

28:52.480 --> 28:56.480
They're often not the first to market in a compelling form factor with stuff.

28:57.120 --> 29:00.800
Usually it's Samsung, right? If you're gonna look at the mobile market, they're pretty aggressive.

29:00.800 --> 29:05.600
But in this case, Apple feels like they're really right there with the rest of the industry,

29:05.600 --> 29:09.280
maybe even a little bit on the leading edge when you look at the Qualcomm modem that they're

29:09.280 --> 29:14.560
shipping and the form factor and battery life that they're claiming you'll get.

29:15.360 --> 29:22.640
I think another factor in the focus is that they worked out a deal with the carriers to take 30

29:22.640 --> 29:27.680
bucks off the phone. And additionally, they appeared to work out a deal with Verizon to

29:27.680 --> 29:34.000
actually hold the announcement of the launch of their nationwide 5G network until Apple's keynote.

29:34.000 --> 29:38.640
Imagine the business arrangement there, man. Think about that. Think about what a product

29:38.640 --> 29:45.840
launch that is for Verizon. Somehow Apple talked them into waiting to make the announcement until

29:45.840 --> 29:50.400
their keynote. I mean, that's quite the deal. So that had to play a factor too.

29:50.960 --> 29:54.640
From a technology standpoint, I actually am kind of excited about it,

29:54.640 --> 30:00.480
even though it's not widely deployed yet. Number one, mobile data is a big deal for me. It's one

30:00.480 --> 30:07.520
of the number one expenses in my monthly expenses. Seriously, it's mobile data. I have multiple

30:07.520 --> 30:14.400
carriers, and I don't mean to, and I really follow this industry very, very closely.

30:15.040 --> 30:22.640
I can say with some surprise that the iPhone 12 has one of the most advanced cellular modems

30:22.640 --> 30:28.640
we've ever seen in the market. It literally supports almost every LTE band in existence

30:28.640 --> 30:35.840
today, which is extremely rare. And it means really good LTE support. Additionally, it has

30:35.840 --> 30:40.960
a four by four antenna so it can make four simultaneous connections to the cell tower,

30:40.960 --> 30:47.440
which is incredible. And then additionally, it happens to have 5G and it currently supports

30:47.440 --> 30:54.640
every standard of 5G that exists today. So one iPhone for all carriers. It's just one iPhone now.

30:54.640 --> 31:00.160
And they've got that screaming Qualcomm chip in there. So from a purely cellular data and band

31:00.160 --> 31:08.560
support standpoint, for mobile workers, this is a killer phone. And the mobile router support,

31:08.560 --> 31:12.400
the tethering support, the Wi-Fi tethering support in the iPhone, it's pretty good.

31:12.400 --> 31:17.280
It makes a pretty damn good little mobile router. And so I will likely pick one up

31:17.280 --> 31:23.600
just for its LTE band support and then use the 5G when I happen to be in an area that has it.

31:23.600 --> 31:28.320
And I'm not even expecting that 5G to be significantly fast. I think this is

31:28.320 --> 31:34.640
the biggest misread about 5G and maybe the thing that kind of annoys me the most. I could get 100

31:34.640 --> 31:39.440
megabits on LTE if I have the right modem and a good signal. I can get 100 megabits. I've got

31:39.440 --> 31:44.720
I got a spot out in the woods where I get 90 megabits on LTE. It's crazy. It's like utopia.

31:44.720 --> 31:49.520
Now, 5G probably not going to get me any better than that. But what it will get me that really

31:49.520 --> 31:54.320
matters for my industry is lower latency. And that's what Apple really focused on. They focused

31:54.320 --> 32:00.400
on gaming. They focused on medical record transfer and and video applications where latency is

32:00.400 --> 32:05.040
extremely important. And the goal with 5G is to eventually get the latency as good as it could be

32:05.040 --> 32:10.400
for a home connection. And I don't care what you say, but that's going to make a transformational

32:10.400 --> 32:14.720
difference on the Internet, just like bringing up bandwidth to the home, brought in streaming video

32:14.720 --> 32:19.360
and all of that. Improved latency will get us real time video communication. So what you and I are

32:19.360 --> 32:25.040
doing will get as good as a phone call or even better, better actually. And maybe if they get

32:25.040 --> 32:29.920
there and if they get if they never get the speeds up beyond what you could get in a good LTE

32:29.920 --> 32:35.760
situation now, but get the latency down, I would happily use that. And this phone is going to get

32:35.760 --> 32:40.720
me the closest to that that anything possibly can on the market today in a form factor that I'm

32:40.720 --> 32:45.520
actually going to want to use. That all makes sense. Actually, I spoiler alert. I, of course,

32:45.520 --> 32:51.440
ordered one because I mean you did. So you must have gotten the 12 pro or 12 then because the

32:51.440 --> 32:55.520
other ones aren't even available yet. I think I got the blue one. Yeah. OK, good. That's what I

32:55.520 --> 33:02.320
think I would get to. I like that. I guess like you have painted a world where like we're all

33:02.320 --> 33:08.560
dancing with Taylor Swift and things are great and we're streaming it right. But I see a world

33:08.560 --> 33:12.880
where every time I, you know, in the before time, somebody used to travel all the time within three

33:12.880 --> 33:18.800
days of being on a trip, rising like Haza, you're on the limited plan. It is unlimited. Enjoy the

33:18.800 --> 33:27.920
fifty six K. Oh yeah. So like if like I could give them virtually any amount of money and they

33:27.920 --> 33:33.120
would like give me real unlimited help, even for even LTE, like you're saying, right? I think that

33:33.120 --> 33:40.480
would be awesome. Yeah, but I'm pretty sure based on decades of history here that they're not going

33:40.480 --> 33:45.360
to do that. Right. Even for like a stupid amount of money that they're going to be like, it's

33:45.360 --> 33:51.680
really fast. You have low latency, very little ping, Haza. And as soon as you finish streaming

33:51.680 --> 33:55.280
one one episode of The Simpsons or whatever the hell you're watching or stream one episode of

33:55.280 --> 34:02.160
the next action show, you are done. Yes. Yeah. So I guess like, do you do you see like a cultural

34:02.160 --> 34:07.520
shift on the telcos where they might like not do that? I hope. I mean, they have to. Right. They're

34:07.520 --> 34:11.440
like Verizon is talking about when you get their millimeter wave connection, they're talking about

34:11.440 --> 34:18.640
a gigabit connection. But the plan allows for 20 gigabytes total. Well, right. So like, literally,

34:19.440 --> 34:24.000
you're not going to make it. No, it's it's ridiculous on its face. And this is one of the

34:24.000 --> 34:29.680
reasons why I have multiple cellular connections in Lady Jupes. I was on a trip just recently,

34:30.400 --> 34:38.880
and AT&T cut me off. I have I had a grandfathered iPad plan that was supposed to be truly unlimited,

34:38.880 --> 34:44.480
but I used 500 gigs on the road and they cut me off. I had one of those. They don't like it when

34:44.480 --> 34:49.360
you tether the items. They just shut it down completely. No, nothing. Just boom, you're you're

34:49.360 --> 34:54.720
you're done, man. You're you're that you're over. And so, yeah, I end up paying for multiple so I

34:54.720 --> 34:59.440
can spread it out. I have different carriers from in different areas. And it's such a shit show. I

34:59.440 --> 35:04.400
hope I look back at this in 10 years and go, oh, man, that was sure the bad old days of mobile

35:04.400 --> 35:09.840
connectivity. All right. If I could even pay like three X what I pay for the businesses wireless.

35:09.840 --> 35:14.720
Right. But it was like truly unlimited. You just can't do it. No, they will. They will not sell you

35:14.720 --> 35:21.360
that. Yeah. If you're like in the CIA or the FBI, they have a special plan they'll give you. Right.

35:21.360 --> 35:26.400
But yeah, you're out. And I know people listening and think this is crazy. When the world is not

35:26.400 --> 35:31.920
ending, go to your local Verizon store and ask for the business rep. Tell him you would or her

35:31.920 --> 35:36.000
you would like to buy the highest enterprise plan that they can sell you. But you want

35:36.000 --> 35:41.760
truly unlimited data with no throttling. You will be asked to leave. One of the carriers is working

35:41.760 --> 35:47.760
has a plan now for quote unquote business users. It's prohibitively expensive. It's quote unquote

35:47.760 --> 35:54.000
unlimited. But you're only allowed to do things like Zoom, email and VPN. Yes. No tethering.

35:54.000 --> 36:00.240
That's my favorite trick. Yeah. And if you do anything outside of that, they reserve the right

36:00.240 --> 36:04.400
to immediately shut down your account. Now, of course, you could VPN it up and maybe, you know,

36:04.400 --> 36:10.080
they'd never know what you're using this line for. But you're always skirting around the policies

36:10.080 --> 36:13.360
and rules. And if they ever did get insights into what you're doing, they could immediately shut

36:13.360 --> 36:18.320
your account down. And that's how you get quote unquote unlimited. But even that is got some,

36:19.600 --> 36:26.400
you know, asterix next to it. So that has to shift. I don't know if you know one thing that

36:26.400 --> 36:31.600
could actually happen is Starlink could come along. Elon could offer something on the market

36:31.600 --> 36:36.080
that is competitive and then the carriers have to respond. Is it bad that I kind of believe in Elon

36:36.080 --> 36:40.080
more than, you know, the government regulating this or fixing it? That's how I feel. That's really

36:40.080 --> 36:43.920
that's truly how I feel. And they've just the carriers have made such a mess of this that it

36:43.920 --> 36:48.560
does make it hard to be enthusiastic. They want us to be excited about the 5G. And I think that's why

36:48.560 --> 36:53.200
it stood out to you so much. I think there's technical advantages by having a modem capable

36:53.200 --> 36:58.560
of it. Oh, I love the tech. Just the policy doesn't work. So funny story, because I'm not

36:58.560 --> 37:04.080
really in a position just to be dropping a lot of cash. But before the pandemic lockdowns hit,

37:04.080 --> 37:12.800
I ordered a super high grade industrial grade cellular modem router kit for my RV that is used

37:12.800 --> 37:18.080
on trains and buses. It's professional gear that you just can't buy. You have to buy it from a

37:18.080 --> 37:23.360
special reseller and all that kind of stuff. And it includes a seven in one antenna that you mount

37:23.360 --> 37:29.200
on the roof and you wire it into this thing. And it's really cool. And it has four SIM slots,

37:29.200 --> 37:36.640
two modems active at the same time. And then it can use a special VPN technology to bond the

37:36.640 --> 37:42.800
carriers together into a single stable connection. And then you run a hosted component on the other

37:42.800 --> 37:47.440
end or use their service. And that's where your traffic comes out. And so like I would run one

37:47.440 --> 37:54.880
on Linode. I ordered that and it's like $1,200, right? But I ordered it back in March when I was

37:54.880 --> 38:01.280
still employed. And so the pandemic lockdowns came and all the shipments from China shut down.

38:01.280 --> 38:05.440
And I got an email saying, hey, your thing's going to be delayed. They told me if I order now

38:06.480 --> 38:09.440
and they'll just include the shipping for free and all that and go ahead and charge it. And I

38:09.440 --> 38:13.520
thought, this is a bad idea, but I'm going to do it. And so I said, go ahead, place the order because

38:13.520 --> 38:18.720
I really want this equipment. My kids are doing school from home and the connection is not reliable

38:18.720 --> 38:24.960
enough when they're all three on school calls and whatnot. And so this is the year I'm going to

38:24.960 --> 38:29.360
invest in this for real. So go ahead and charge it. And then, of course, the lockdowns come and

38:29.360 --> 38:32.960
it doesn't ship and it doesn't ship and it doesn't ship. So in August, I emailed the guy and I'm

38:32.960 --> 38:38.880
like, so did I just get scammed here? What's going on? And he tells me, no, no, it's all due to the

38:38.880 --> 38:44.640
lockdown. It should be shipping in September. It'll be fine. And so I'm sitting there pontificating

38:44.640 --> 38:48.960
on if I should just cancel this thing because I just been scammed and go to my credit card and ask

38:48.960 --> 38:53.040
them if they can reverse the charge. But I found another seller. And so I emailed him. I said,

38:53.040 --> 38:57.280
what's the status? And he gave me the same exact story that it's all shut down, but they should be

38:57.280 --> 39:00.880
shipping in September. And so if you'd like to place your order now, you can. I thought, well,

39:00.880 --> 39:04.960
OK, so maybe that's really what's going on. So I don't cancel the original order. September goes

39:04.960 --> 39:09.680
by. I never get it. October comes. I get an update. It should be shipping any day now.

39:09.680 --> 39:16.640
October 15th comes. Nothing. October 16th arrives and I get an email saying that the the entire

39:16.640 --> 39:22.400
setup with all of its modems and its antennas and it's all this stuff is all going to arrive

39:22.400 --> 39:29.840
on the 20th. Oh, wow. And this whole thing, you know, is all based on LTE. None of it is 5G because

39:29.840 --> 39:34.880
I just I'm not investing in 5G right now. It's ridiculous. It's all going to be LTE for years.

39:34.880 --> 39:39.760
And what I hope is that people will move off the LTE network and move over to 5G. So everybody go

39:39.760 --> 39:46.560
buy your iPhone 12s and get off my LTE network. Just free it up for me. I want all the spectrum

39:46.560 --> 39:52.640
I can get. So I'm you know, I've got this industrial grade LTE kit now that's coming.

39:52.640 --> 39:57.360
I've got to drill holes in my ceiling and all kinds of stuff. My God, I know it's going to be

39:57.360 --> 40:02.720
massive, but when I'm done, I should have the most reliable LTE connection humanly possible.

40:02.720 --> 40:05.840
You know, you could do like a testing rig, you know, just like drive around the country. All

40:05.840 --> 40:10.800
right. Well, I'm locking the bandwidth here. Yeah. And so it's got four SIM slots, but only

40:10.800 --> 40:14.720
two of the modems are active. So I'm going to have an AT&T and a Verizon and then a Google

40:14.720 --> 40:22.240
Fi and a Ting as my backups. And yeah, I mean, I'm serious about it. It is it's a it's a massive

40:22.240 --> 40:27.120
issue for me because my entire job is online. Everything I do is online. The way I communicate

40:27.120 --> 40:31.760
with everybody in the team, everything is online. And so I'm going to have to do a lot of

40:31.760 --> 40:37.040
online. And so and then you have the kids with their schooling and then my wife, any client she

40:37.040 --> 40:41.200
does have, most of them are virtual and those are video calls. She can she can switch over to

40:41.200 --> 40:46.720
LTE on her phone, but it'd be nice if the Wi-Fi was reliable. So, yeah, that's a thing. Sounds

40:46.720 --> 40:52.480
awesome. Should make working from home a little bit better, although maybe maybe if you're a

40:52.480 --> 40:56.800
Dropbox employee, you'll want some of these tips because it looks like Dropbox is letting all

40:56.800 --> 41:03.760
employees work from home permanently with like kind of a we work style where some folks will

41:03.760 --> 41:08.880
come in during the week and they'll work together and they'll have like a collab space where they

41:08.880 --> 41:12.000
can give each other the Rona and then they go back home and infect their families.

41:12.000 --> 41:16.320
I am relatively sure that the group email that announced this, that was not the pitch.

41:18.000 --> 41:21.440
I feel like, you know, the head of engineering or whatever, the CEO was like,

41:21.440 --> 41:25.440
here's the plan, folks, you're going to work from home. Everybody's like, yay.

41:25.440 --> 41:29.600
Then once a month you come in, you get COVID, you spread it to all your family. Wait, what?

41:29.600 --> 41:34.400
It's like what we talked about, though, what they're trying to get to is the best of both worlds,

41:34.400 --> 41:40.560
where you still get the in-person collaboration and sustain the company culture. Because I have

41:40.560 --> 41:47.120
witnessed that working for clients in various capacities. I've noticed that all remote companies,

41:47.120 --> 41:54.080
they they front like they have a culture, but it doesn't actually exist. All the people behind the

41:54.080 --> 41:58.880
other ends of the screens are all kind of lonely and disgruntled. And I say this totally just on

41:58.880 --> 42:02.560
observation. It's not any kind of... Are you talking about me specifically now?

42:02.560 --> 42:08.000
No, I've noticed this with several companies I've worked with. And you quickly get in a situation

42:08.000 --> 42:13.760
where you have the like the management layer is preaching to you what the culture is constantly

42:13.760 --> 42:19.280
and they're constantly telling you what the culture is, but it's not real. It's just...

42:19.280 --> 42:24.800
It's a fancy blog post. Yeah. Where you actually come into an office space and you're working with

42:24.800 --> 42:31.040
multiple people and the kind of ideology and culture of the office is generally represented

42:31.040 --> 42:36.720
in the workspace. And you see that, you get that human connection, that high bandwidth exchange,

42:37.440 --> 42:43.680
and you get your feels out, all that kind of stuff. And I think you then send people off and

42:43.680 --> 42:47.840
they go be productive for a few days from home. Sort of like one of our dark matter developers who

42:47.840 --> 42:51.680
got to work a couple of days at home and then come into the office. That's, I think, the perfect

42:51.680 --> 42:57.200
balance. I think it's very funny that you put this in the show notes. I am reopening our space

42:57.200 --> 43:01.520
in Plant City. Yeah, right. I thought I heard you mention that. I think you mentioned it to me on

43:01.520 --> 43:06.400
Slack maybe. Yeah, in Slack. It is related to my magical SUSE thing I'm doing. Don't want to say

43:06.400 --> 43:11.280
much about it now, but yeah, instead of having a large space, this is exactly what we're doing,

43:11.280 --> 43:16.000
right? Like, you know, kicking off projects. We have a lot of weird hardware integration work

43:16.000 --> 43:21.600
that came in, so that stuff you kind of have to do there. But not trying to really do this

43:21.600 --> 43:27.360
until the Rona's over, which, God willing, will be soon. May never. Well, geez. Listen,

43:27.360 --> 43:32.880
every time I listen to Unfilter, I cry a little bit. So let's just move right along. But hopefully

43:33.520 --> 43:37.840
it ends. And yeah, this is the idea. Small spaces, you know, we operate in two states,

43:37.840 --> 43:44.320
so maybe one in New Jersey soon. But yeah, it's, I don't even know what to say.

43:44.320 --> 43:51.040
I, it's weird. I love remote work for like heads down coding. Right. But when it's stuff like,

43:51.040 --> 43:57.040
oh, I have to ups you this custom board back and forth. And oh, the kid at the UPS store,

43:57.040 --> 44:01.200
like spilled his tea in it. Let's be honest. It wasn't the kid at the UPS store, but moving right

44:01.200 --> 44:09.920
along. It's kind of inefficient. So can I fry some bacon? Oh, you know, I've always got a little

44:09.920 --> 44:15.200
right here. You want me to throw it on the old griddle? Go ahead. So this is bacon from Japan.

44:16.000 --> 44:22.000
Curtis, courtesy of that rich guy who invested in WeWork, whose name just literally evacuated my

44:22.000 --> 44:28.560
brain. I really don't remember anymore. It's Wagyu bacon. Wagyu bacon. I'm pretty sure this is going

44:28.560 --> 44:32.880
to bail WeWork out. Well, I think you'll have a lot of corporations just convert their offices

44:32.880 --> 44:36.560
into WeWork like spaces, but then you'll have others that are looking to fill in gaps and

44:36.560 --> 44:41.920
whatnot in like areas. Yeah. I mean, obviously, like if you want WeWork, but for adults, there's

44:41.920 --> 44:50.000
Regis, which I use. But yeah, I, I, I'm a little mixed on this whole concept because then you're

44:50.000 --> 44:54.000
taking a lease. Like, to be clear, our space plan city is like a traditional lease. That's why I

44:54.000 --> 44:57.440
still have it. And you're not using it all the time. Doesn't that feel kind of wasteful, Chris,

44:57.440 --> 45:03.440
as like an entrepreneur? Oh, yeah. 100%. It's, I mean, the studio is, it makes the production

45:03.440 --> 45:07.040
of these shows so much more consistent and straightforward, but yet I still look at that

45:07.040 --> 45:13.120
expense and go, hmm, could always just do it from home. But what I have right now is kind of a

45:13.120 --> 45:17.760
balance. Some days I work from home, the days I'm not on air, I might, I might come to the studio.

45:17.760 --> 45:21.760
I might not. I kind of break it up depending on the project work that I'm doing. And I like having

45:21.760 --> 45:28.640
that flexibility. I basically have kind of cemented my idea that it's worth the business having the

45:28.640 --> 45:33.360
space. But when times are tough, you look at it and you go, gosh, you know, I could, I could make

45:33.360 --> 45:37.520
that back because it's not just the rent, it's the services and the utilities you have running here

45:37.520 --> 45:43.600
too. And maybe insurance and you know, it ends up, it ends up being a pretty decent expense.

45:44.240 --> 45:50.160
Yeah. Let's see, let's see how long I last for doing this. Although the peace and quiet,

45:50.160 --> 45:55.440
especially for recording has to be just, yeah. Well, except for sometimes I have airplanes going

45:55.440 --> 45:59.280
overhead. So you never know. It's never, sometimes I'm in Florida and there's like lightning

45:59.280 --> 46:05.760
everywhere. So yeah, I think it's a good mix though. I think maybe wouldn't that be interesting

46:05.760 --> 46:09.120
if we had a bunch of companies that didn't land on everybody works from home, but what they land

46:09.120 --> 46:13.760
on. And I think what we're kind of seeing happen is a lot more flexibility because now the

46:13.760 --> 46:17.440
infrastructure had been put in place, the tooling has been put in place, except for the companies

46:17.440 --> 46:21.360
that really screwed it up. They're going to be in a position now where they could, where they

46:21.360 --> 46:25.680
could do that. Plus he thinks like it wouldn't save them money. Having people not in the office

46:25.680 --> 46:29.200
saves money. It makes it harder to watch what they're doing every single day, but there's tools

46:29.200 --> 46:34.720
to compensate for that. Well, I think you need less space, right? Isn't that kind of the. Yeah.

46:34.720 --> 46:40.000
And less power, less snacks, less things in the fridge, you know, like seriously,

46:40.640 --> 46:48.880
the only downside is I have seen some companies that are getting a little Snoopy. Like they want

46:48.880 --> 46:53.440
to up the surveillance software that runs on your company machines. So they have more confidence

46:53.440 --> 46:58.240
that you're being productive during the day. I don't think that's a good trend. I don't like

46:58.240 --> 47:04.240
that. And, um, there is a company out there that shopping to tech podcasters right now about, uh,

47:04.240 --> 47:07.520
selling a service that helps you monitor your employees that are working from home.

47:07.520 --> 47:16.320
Do their checks clear? I mean, no, no, of course not. Yeah. Yeah. Well now let me tell you about

47:16.320 --> 47:21.840
now actually, you know what? Let me thank, uh, the coder QA folks. Uh, if you'd like to be a member,

47:21.840 --> 47:26.240
uh, coder QA helps us stay independent. It helps us be choosy about the sponsors,

47:26.240 --> 47:31.280
coder QA.com. Uh, the first coderly report is out as well for our members. You can get that

47:31.280 --> 47:35.360
in the feed or as an individual download, you support the show and you also get a limited ad

47:35.360 --> 47:43.760
feed of the show. Plus that coder quarterly report coder QA.co that's coder QA.co to sign up and

47:43.760 --> 47:48.560
support the show. Why not? Uh, why not buy your buddies here at coder radio, a holiday gift that

47:48.560 --> 47:54.480
revenue goes towards paying for editing, producing all of that. That is a, it's a business cost and

47:54.480 --> 47:58.240
we'd like to make it sustainable. So that way we have a varying load of sponsors from time to time,

47:58.240 --> 48:04.400
but the basics of the show are still covered at coder QA.co and thanks to everybody who does

48:04.400 --> 48:08.640
support the show over there. Now, Mike, last week we teased about this a little bit, but I think we

48:08.640 --> 48:13.280
got a few more minutes. We could get this in. Uh, and you recently had an adventure in Vinland

48:13.280 --> 48:16.400
and I also had a new editor that I've been trying out that I wanted to mention, but

48:17.200 --> 48:23.760
what's going on? What's going on with you and Vim? So because I am picky and the fonts were not

48:23.760 --> 48:30.160
rendering at what I perceived as the right size in gnome three, thank you gnome. Um, I decided to

48:30.160 --> 48:37.200
try out Vim again. I then like all Vim users spent way too long configuring my Vim IRC. Yes. You gotta

48:37.200 --> 48:40.960
get the colors just right. I have been doing this for two weeks. I think this is going to be my last

48:40.960 --> 48:46.960
week. So this is a very brief segment. Okay. Here's the good on Linux. Nothing renders that

48:46.960 --> 48:54.960
better than the terminal. Visually it's beautiful. It's a great flex. You know, it looks nice. Um,

48:54.960 --> 48:59.760
I probably will actually turn on Vim key bindings and Ruby mine then pie charm now,

49:00.560 --> 49:06.560
but damn, is it a pain in the butt? For instance, I had to open my Mac and I'm like, ah, let me just,

49:06.560 --> 49:12.480
you know, pull down my Vim RC, which is in a gist. Well, for some reason that I don't understand,

49:12.480 --> 49:18.640
it simply does not work on Mac terminal. There's the plugins are not installing, right?

49:19.280 --> 49:25.600
And it's very annoying. I really wanted to love this. I do not. So how's your editor?

49:28.000 --> 49:34.000
That's not what I expected at all. I was all sitting here. Oh my God. I was expecting this

49:34.000 --> 49:38.960
whole love letter. Okay. All right. Well, let me introduce you to something simpler.

49:38.960 --> 49:44.560
It's called micro a modern and intuitive terminal based text editor. That's simple. Lightweight

49:44.560 --> 49:51.680
has easy to use features compatibility with key bindings from Vim or nano highly customizable.

49:51.680 --> 49:57.200
If you want to go down that route, even a plugin system, if you want support 75 languages,

49:57.200 --> 50:01.760
seven default color schemes to choose from. It supports true color schemes as well.

50:01.760 --> 50:05.680
And of course, syntax color schemes are very simple to make if you want to make your own.

50:05.680 --> 50:11.760
And if you want an editor on the console that can also do the multi pain thing where you can have

50:11.760 --> 50:16.880
side pains and two pains and all the quad pains, it'll do all of that. I'm not talking about the

50:16.880 --> 50:22.160
West pains. I'm talking about the view pains. And, um, it, um, what did I say? Mouth support

50:22.160 --> 50:26.480
has mouth support. So, you know, if that's your thing too on the terminal, it has that.

50:26.480 --> 50:31.520
Now you're just rubbing it in. It's like a nano alternative that's a little more powerful. It was

50:31.520 --> 50:37.520
recommended to me on Linux unplugged by a listener and, uh, I installed it and I love it. I mean,

50:37.520 --> 50:44.000
I still love my nano. You know, it's, I kind of joke a little bit, but I'm, I'm serious too in

50:44.000 --> 50:49.680
that, um, I want, I want easy and wait, hang on. You actually like nano. Yeah. You know, I mean,

50:49.680 --> 50:54.080
I, I can use Vim. I taught myself Vim because it's on literally every system. And that,

50:54.800 --> 50:58.800
that was a concept that actually mattered back in the day when you had to install everything with

50:58.800 --> 51:04.560
RPMs like an animal. But today it's so easy to install software and most systems ship with

51:04.560 --> 51:10.240
multiple editors installed. I think it's a little bit of dogma that maybe is more myth than it is

51:10.240 --> 51:15.200
truth. And everything is, has nano. It's easy to get nano or Pico on just about anything. And it's

51:15.200 --> 51:21.120
such a nice, simple, everything is there. All the commands are at the bottom. It's just, uh, no

51:21.120 --> 51:28.080
surprises, no complexity. I'm into the file. I'm out of the file. There's just a simplicity and

51:28.080 --> 51:32.800
quickness to it that I really appreciate. And if I'm looking for something that's more advanced,

51:32.800 --> 51:38.720
like I'm, I'm editing the sudoers file, I might use Vim or visudo. But if I'm just editing my

51:38.720 --> 51:44.240
Samba config or something like, you know, a basic file on my file system, I just use nano. If I'm

51:44.240 --> 51:50.640
not using VS code to begin with, I'll just use nano. In, out, easy, quick, simple keybinds.

51:50.640 --> 51:55.600
And now I've started using micro more and more. And I get that I'm not leet and I feel bad that,

51:55.600 --> 51:59.920
you know, I'm not leet when I say that and that I'm not, you know, cool hacker, bro. But

52:00.640 --> 52:06.160
I just don't care. I just like the simplicity of it. That's my confession to you. And, uh,

52:06.160 --> 52:09.200
I leave myself open to your judgment. I bet it works great on Azusa.

52:11.360 --> 52:16.400
Oh, all right. Okay. Okay. All right. Well, I'll put a link to micro in the show notes.

52:16.400 --> 52:20.800
