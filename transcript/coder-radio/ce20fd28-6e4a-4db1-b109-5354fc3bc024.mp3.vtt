00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
This is KOTORadio, episode 466 for May 16, 2022.

00:07.000 --> 00:18.680
Hey, good looking and welcome into Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show, taking a

00:18.680 --> 00:23.880
pragmatic look at the art and business of software development and the world of technology.

00:23.880 --> 00:29.760
My name is Chris, and joining us every single week from his command bunker, it's our host,

00:29.760 --> 00:30.760
Mr. Dominic.

00:30.760 --> 00:31.760
Hello, Mike.

00:31.760 --> 00:32.760
On screen.

00:32.760 --> 00:33.760
Full magnification.

00:33.760 --> 00:34.760
Enhance.

00:34.760 --> 00:35.760
Enhance.

00:35.760 --> 00:36.760
I love that.

00:36.760 --> 00:37.760
And I always love when somebody like rings the doorbell.

00:37.760 --> 00:38.760
Enter.

00:38.760 --> 00:39.760
Enter.

00:39.760 --> 00:41.680
There are four lights.

00:41.680 --> 00:42.680
That was for the days.

00:42.680 --> 00:43.680
That was for the days.

00:43.680 --> 00:44.680
Ah, man.

00:44.680 --> 00:45.680
Oh, man.

00:45.680 --> 00:48.720
So I might sound a little off, I might sound a little different.

00:48.720 --> 00:53.640
I am in Southern Oregon, getting my RV ready for another summer road trip.

00:53.640 --> 00:58.080
And we still had a few last suspension fixes from the last trip that had to get done.

00:58.080 --> 01:02.520
So it's about 400 miles from the studio, some about 400 miles south.

01:02.520 --> 01:04.360
And it's a totally different climate down here.

01:04.360 --> 01:06.280
It's so nice.

01:06.280 --> 01:09.200
Mid 70s, low 70s today.

01:09.200 --> 01:10.200
Sunshine.

01:10.200 --> 01:13.000
Oh, I forgot that stuff exists, man.

01:13.000 --> 01:19.160
You live up in the Pacific Northwest, and it's just like gray clouds all the time.

01:19.160 --> 01:22.460
Not to complain about the weather on the show, but I legitimately feel like I'm in a better

01:22.460 --> 01:23.460
mood down here.

01:23.460 --> 01:24.460
It's nice.

01:24.460 --> 01:26.760
I know you wouldn't understand, Mr. Florida.

01:26.760 --> 01:27.760
I know.

01:27.760 --> 01:31.880
I mean, you don't just hang out with snakes and alligators all day, like, chilling?

01:31.880 --> 01:32.880
Right.

01:32.880 --> 01:36.040
Meanwhile, you're blowing up my Twitter this week, working on Alice and prepping her for

01:36.040 --> 01:39.560
OpenCore and geeking out on Python.

01:39.560 --> 01:42.160
Like I had a busy Twitter week.

01:42.160 --> 01:43.600
You even had a busier one.

01:43.600 --> 01:44.600
I know.

01:44.600 --> 01:45.600
It's been a hell of a week.

01:45.600 --> 01:51.640
I'm trying to figure out this whole OpenCore, you know, GPL thing, and God, it's very complicated.

01:51.640 --> 01:53.880
I heard a new term this last week.

01:53.880 --> 01:55.760
It was something like Core Open or something.

01:55.760 --> 01:57.520
They just flipped the term.

01:57.520 --> 02:00.360
Is that a new term or is that like string reverse, but fancier?

02:00.360 --> 02:01.360
Yeah.

02:01.360 --> 02:06.400
I was like, can they do that?

02:06.400 --> 02:07.400
Does that work?

02:07.400 --> 02:09.320
I don't know about that.

02:09.320 --> 02:15.120
Oh, man, we got so many messages about Microsoft Access last week.

02:15.120 --> 02:22.760
You know, I won't out them, but we got an email from a listener who works at Microsoft

02:22.760 --> 02:26.440
and they had to look up what Access was after listening to the show.

02:26.440 --> 02:28.480
How does that make you feel?

02:28.480 --> 02:33.200
Well, you got to remember too, at Access, not all accesses are the same.

02:33.200 --> 02:34.920
It's just like a name.

02:34.920 --> 02:37.400
It's it's it's I'm going to you know what?

02:37.400 --> 02:41.000
No, we've spent too much time discussing Microsoft Access on this show.

02:41.000 --> 02:46.040
One of the choice ones was 97 and Five writes in, he says, look, man, I needed to eat.

02:46.040 --> 02:51.240
But he writes, my role at a company in the past was converting Access 97 database apps

02:51.240 --> 02:52.240
to VB.net.

02:52.240 --> 02:53.600
Oh, for sure.

02:53.600 --> 02:58.280
Some of these applications had all of the data within an access file, which, as you

02:58.280 --> 03:02.560
might know, does not do a one to one transfer to Microsoft SQL.

03:02.560 --> 03:07.560
Sometimes I would get lucky and some of the data would already live in Microsoft SQL.

03:07.560 --> 03:09.980
But most of the code didn't translate well either.

03:09.980 --> 03:14.380
So I typically had to recreate the application from scratch.

03:14.380 --> 03:20.440
The team continued building access applications while I was in the process of converting them

03:20.440 --> 03:25.000
and access 97 didn't use proper locking methods.

03:25.000 --> 03:29.220
And that was actually one of the reasons why the team didn't want to move to a new version

03:29.220 --> 03:30.220
of access.

03:30.220 --> 03:31.220
It just kept kicking users out.

03:31.220 --> 03:33.880
They didn't want locking anyways.

03:33.880 --> 03:36.840
Sometimes you just have to make your way through life and sometimes you have to do shameful

03:36.840 --> 03:38.880
things to be able to eat.

03:38.880 --> 03:41.600
I now code like a gentleman with Python.

03:41.600 --> 03:47.600
Is Python the sort of like blue blooded open doors for ladies and always tuck your shirt

03:47.600 --> 03:48.600
in language?

03:48.600 --> 03:50.600
I thought that was closure.

03:50.600 --> 03:51.600
It's the language.

03:51.600 --> 03:53.120
It's the language you take home to your parents.

03:53.120 --> 03:54.120
Yeah, that enclosure.

03:54.120 --> 03:55.120
Yeah.

03:55.120 --> 03:56.120
I see.

03:56.120 --> 04:01.880
So you have like a bender, a romantic bender for a couple of years at Objective-C. Although

04:01.880 --> 04:03.800
Objective-C would be the cougar of languages.

04:03.800 --> 04:07.080
Oh, I was going to say Objective-C was the one that your grandparents brought home for

04:07.080 --> 04:08.080
dinner.

04:08.080 --> 04:09.080
Oh.

04:09.080 --> 04:12.640
You know, this could get worse.

04:12.640 --> 04:16.920
The Objective-C is like, I knew your dad very well, in fact.

04:16.920 --> 04:17.920
Oh.

04:17.920 --> 04:18.920
Yeah.

04:18.920 --> 04:21.800
And then you realize your dad has a history that you never knew about.

04:21.800 --> 04:22.800
Yeah.

04:22.800 --> 04:23.800
We don't want to go there.

04:23.800 --> 04:24.800
My poor son.

04:24.800 --> 04:25.800
Let's just keep going.

04:25.800 --> 04:27.800
Oh, my God.

04:27.800 --> 04:29.080
All right.

04:29.080 --> 04:34.640
So Dan writes in and he says he's kind of tired of hearing about the podcasting 2.0

04:34.640 --> 04:35.640
stuff.

04:35.640 --> 04:38.880
He means it with all due respect and he does get value from the show.

04:38.880 --> 04:44.200
So he became a member to support the network a few months ago and he's happy with that.

04:44.200 --> 04:49.280
But he's really, really disliking the boost because he feels like they're ads.

04:49.280 --> 04:52.800
He says, I respect Chris and I understand that you choose to evangelize this as an alternative

04:52.800 --> 04:53.920
to memberships.

04:53.920 --> 04:54.920
And that's fair enough.

04:54.920 --> 04:58.040
He says, I don't think it should be placed in the members feed.

04:58.040 --> 05:02.440
I like paying for Netflix and I get that adding value for value is important.

05:02.440 --> 05:03.440
Sorry for the rant.

05:03.440 --> 05:04.440
It's meant with respect.

05:04.440 --> 05:05.440
Oh, no, Dan, don't feel bad at all.

05:05.440 --> 05:06.440
I wanted to cover this.

05:06.440 --> 05:08.520
So Dan writes and he's like, I'm tired of hearing about this.

05:08.520 --> 05:10.200
And I think I messed up.

05:10.200 --> 05:14.160
When I initially started talking about podcasting 2.0 and stuff like that, I just was so excited

05:14.160 --> 05:19.080
that I just ran my mouth, you know, just jumped in the term that the community has over there

05:19.080 --> 05:20.920
is running with scissors.

05:20.920 --> 05:24.560
And it is just that it is running with scissors for sure.

05:24.560 --> 05:28.920
But I probably messed up the pitch, right, because and I've decided what I'm going to

05:28.920 --> 05:32.280
do is I'm just going to kind of stop talking about it too much in the other shows.

05:32.280 --> 05:34.320
I'll still push it forward and talk about it from here there.

05:34.320 --> 05:38.560
But office hours is really where that's going to be my outlet to a degree.

05:38.560 --> 05:42.440
But I want to mention why I'm very excited about this and then I'm going to just drop

05:42.440 --> 05:43.440
it on the show.

05:43.440 --> 05:48.120
I mean, I will bring it up from time to time, but I won't bring it up every week.

05:48.120 --> 05:50.420
Podcasting 2.0 is more than just value for value and boosts.

05:50.420 --> 05:53.680
It's an important part of it, but it is a spec.

05:53.680 --> 05:57.200
Here's a couple of the things that I really like about it that I think would be great

05:57.200 --> 05:58.200
for podcasting.

05:58.200 --> 06:00.760
Number one transcripts that's good for SEO and accessibility.

06:00.760 --> 06:05.360
Number two chapters, we need a standard way of doing this number three soundbites, shareability

06:05.360 --> 06:07.240
of podcasts is very poor right now.

06:07.240 --> 06:09.560
YouTube crushes this seasons.

06:09.560 --> 06:14.840
Right now we have like a proprietary way where Apple has created a tag, they've modified

06:14.840 --> 06:15.840
the RSS spec.

06:15.840 --> 06:20.280
Well, they've just added this tag and other people have just sort of clumsily implemented

06:20.280 --> 06:21.280
it.

06:21.280 --> 06:23.320
And that's how we get seasons of podcasts right now.

06:23.320 --> 06:26.680
The spec has a standardized way to do this.

06:26.680 --> 06:27.680
Alternate enclosures.

06:27.680 --> 06:28.880
This is another really good one.

06:28.880 --> 06:34.120
One feed entry, multiple file types, low bit rate, high bit rate, video, opus, all in one

06:34.120 --> 06:36.140
feed entry images.

06:36.140 --> 06:40.220
The ability to show the occasional image at the particular time in the show when we're

06:40.220 --> 06:43.840
talking about something could be nice, wouldn't want to overuse it, but it's nice to have

06:43.840 --> 06:45.520
live.

06:45.520 --> 06:50.800
They have and are working on the ability for podcasting 2.0 apps to support live streams

06:50.800 --> 06:52.040
in your podcast app.

06:52.040 --> 06:56.780
So you open up your podcast app and in your list of shows, Coder Radio will be listed

06:56.780 --> 06:59.900
with a on air or live badge next to it.

06:59.900 --> 07:04.000
And you could just tap that and tune into Coder Radio live from your existing podcast

07:04.000 --> 07:05.000
app.

07:05.000 --> 07:06.000
I don't know why we've never had that.

07:06.000 --> 07:07.320
We clearly need that.

07:07.320 --> 07:08.800
Social interact.

07:08.800 --> 07:15.000
This is a part of the spec that is a cross app, cross platform, activity, pub driven

07:15.000 --> 07:16.000
comment system.

07:16.000 --> 07:21.200
So you could have universal comments across apps and services for podcasts and then the

07:21.200 --> 07:23.080
channel disclosure tag.

07:23.080 --> 07:27.240
This allows a podcaster to signal when perhaps there's going to be no more episodes released

07:27.240 --> 07:32.020
in a feed or other kinds of information about a feed that a podcast app could consume.

07:32.020 --> 07:35.400
And then lastly, amongst many other things that I haven't even gotten to are the value

07:35.400 --> 07:37.320
and the boosts.

07:37.320 --> 07:41.620
Podcasting 2.0 brings a range of features that podcasting has needed for a decade.

07:41.620 --> 07:47.000
And it does it in an open source community driven way instead of Apple or Spotify coming

07:47.000 --> 07:51.760
up with proprietary RSS tag improvements that is there's no spec for the developers just

07:51.760 --> 07:53.900
kind of clumsily implement.

07:53.900 --> 07:54.900
That's it.

07:54.900 --> 07:57.680
I'll talk more about this in office hours because that's where I'm going to talk about

07:57.680 --> 08:01.680
a lot of our long term strategy stuff and answer questions and stuff like this.

08:01.680 --> 08:07.760
I plan for JB to go all in on podcasting 2.0 and so as people pick up new podcast apps,

08:07.760 --> 08:11.720
they're going to start to see new features show up and boosts are one of them.

08:11.720 --> 08:16.640
And that was the one that I got the most excited about the quickest because it solves the monetization

08:16.640 --> 08:19.480
problem for both podcasts and free software.

08:19.480 --> 08:24.800
And it does it at a time when advertising is retracting, the economy is slowing and

08:24.800 --> 08:26.840
this system is growing, right?

08:26.840 --> 08:28.760
So that's what I led with.

08:28.760 --> 08:33.360
But I think you'll see that stuff like the podcasting 2.0 spec is necessary for podcasting

08:33.360 --> 08:38.820
to stay healthy and to compete with Apple, Spotify, YouTube and others.

08:38.820 --> 08:42.640
But the good news is for everybody who's sick of me talking about it in coder, I'm going

08:42.640 --> 08:45.680
to try to keep most of this contained to office hours as time goes on.

08:45.680 --> 08:46.960
So there's that.

08:46.960 --> 08:52.840
And I understand Dan and mostly the whole boost thing and all of the podcasting 2.0

08:52.840 --> 08:56.240
stuff is not meant to replace anything that exists now.

08:56.240 --> 08:59.540
So if you're listening to a podcast and you're listening to it in your favorite app and you

08:59.540 --> 09:02.440
don't plan to adopt any of this stuff, your experience won't change.

09:02.440 --> 09:03.500
That's the idea.

09:03.500 --> 09:04.840
All of this stuff is additional.

09:04.840 --> 09:08.600
It benefits, it supports, it boosts, it doesn't replace.

09:08.600 --> 09:09.600
That's the idea.

09:09.600 --> 09:13.060
It's hard to talk about, you know, because it's something I'm really excited about as

09:13.060 --> 09:14.140
a as a project.

09:14.140 --> 09:15.800
But I understand the audience.

09:15.800 --> 09:19.040
It's like a it's like me talking about how we make the sausage basically.

09:19.040 --> 09:21.920
We make it with hickory smoked pork.

09:21.920 --> 09:23.320
We weren't gonna actually talk about sausage.

09:23.320 --> 09:25.720
No, well, I mean, we could talk about sausage.

09:25.720 --> 09:26.720
I don't know.

09:26.720 --> 09:27.720
Would you get what I have?

09:27.720 --> 09:30.880
You ever had this where you're like, I mean, I think this is what a lot of the show probably

09:30.880 --> 09:32.520
has been when it comes to the app store stuff.

09:32.520 --> 09:36.640
So it's like, yeah, you recognize something that your industry needs to get their head

09:36.640 --> 09:38.400
out of their ass about.

09:38.400 --> 09:43.280
And you kind of need your audience or, you know, your customer base on board, too, because

09:43.280 --> 09:46.340
you need them to adopt these new features to create the demand.

09:46.340 --> 09:50.840
So that way, other apps like antenna pod and overcast, they start adding these features,

09:50.840 --> 09:53.580
which they never will unless their users ask for them.

09:53.580 --> 09:55.380
So it's a real chicken and the egg problem.

09:55.380 --> 09:59.260
And so I have to be the jerk sticking his neck out there, pushing it forward, because

09:59.260 --> 10:01.640
otherwise we just sort of have a stalemate.

10:01.640 --> 10:02.640
Yeah.

10:02.640 --> 10:06.320
And more than that, it's I think about the app store stuff from, you know, when I was

10:06.320 --> 10:09.140
bitching about it in 2012, 2013 ish.

10:09.140 --> 10:11.920
That case is what happens if it doesn't work, right?

10:11.920 --> 10:17.560
If the community does not kind of, you know, step up and say, hey, this is kind of messed

10:17.560 --> 10:20.820
up, you get monopolies.

10:20.820 --> 10:26.480
And I could see something very similar happening in podcasting in terms of monetization of

10:26.480 --> 10:27.480
podcasts, right?

10:27.480 --> 10:28.480
Yeah.

10:28.480 --> 10:35.740
And the right now, any new thing that podcasts have gotten like seasons, or chapters, it's

10:35.740 --> 10:41.420
all just sort of been a ragtag implementation, maybe like Apple created a tag, or some Germans

10:41.420 --> 10:45.780
created a way you can cram something in like the ID three information.

10:45.780 --> 10:48.540
And it's just sort of out of spec, but we all just do it that way.

10:48.540 --> 10:51.660
The susa developers created a new XML tag.

10:51.660 --> 10:54.300
Yeah, that's essentially what it is.

10:54.300 --> 10:58.220
And then we all we basically just get enough people using it that it becomes the new standard,

10:58.220 --> 10:59.740
but there's no community input.

10:59.740 --> 11:02.060
There's nobody driving them iterating them.

11:02.060 --> 11:06.260
The actual core podcasting spec for the RSS feed, as far as I know, I could have this

11:06.260 --> 11:07.260
wrong.

11:07.260 --> 11:12.140
But as far as I know, it hasn't been updated since 2009, in any official sort of standard

11:12.140 --> 11:13.140
way.

11:13.140 --> 11:17.380
What we've gotten since 2009, has mostly been whatever whatever Apple crams in there and

11:17.380 --> 11:20.060
then other people just kind of implement.

11:20.060 --> 11:21.060
I do get it.

11:21.060 --> 11:22.060
It is a tricky thing.

11:22.060 --> 11:25.900
And when you're a consumer of something, you have a different relationship with a problem

11:25.900 --> 11:29.180
than when you are in the industry working with it.

11:29.180 --> 11:34.860
So and I blew the initial communication on it, because I saw a much bigger problem when

11:34.860 --> 11:38.700
it comes to monetizing free software that I thought maybe we could address by building

11:38.700 --> 11:43.060
a network out around lightning, but it is what it is.

11:43.060 --> 11:48.660
I'm only human and I learn and I iterate.

11:48.660 --> 11:53.100
lino.com slash coder go there to get $100 in 60 day credit on a new account and you

11:53.100 --> 11:55.100
go there to support the show.

11:55.100 --> 11:59.220
Linode is fast, reliable cloud hosting for developers, you got to try it for your next

11:59.220 --> 12:00.220
project.

12:00.220 --> 12:02.940
It's what we've used for everything we've built in the last couple of years.

12:02.940 --> 12:05.460
And Linode has been rolling out upgrades, they're always rolling out upgrades for as

12:05.460 --> 12:09.300
long as they've been a customer, it seems like they're always updating the infrastructure,

12:09.300 --> 12:16.460
keeping it super competitive, 11 data centers around the world, MVME storage, AMD epic processors,

12:16.460 --> 12:19.420
40 gigabit connections coming into the machines.

12:19.420 --> 12:24.420
It's really high performance and the UI is smooth, clean, easy to get going.

12:24.420 --> 12:28.500
If you're a newbie or a pro, I'm talking like one click deployments or like super custom

12:28.500 --> 12:30.660
rigs, however you like to roll.

12:30.660 --> 12:33.340
And then they have the best support to back it up so you can feel safe and comfortable

12:33.340 --> 12:35.620
putting your important stuff on there.

12:35.620 --> 12:40.380
And go say hi to Linode at KubeCon EU if you're going to be there, they'll be there in Spain

12:40.380 --> 12:42.300
May 16 through the 20th.

12:42.300 --> 12:46.060
If you want to go say holler to the folks over at Linode, go find them over there and

12:46.060 --> 12:49.100
tell them that the Coder radio program sent you.

12:49.100 --> 12:53.300
So if you're a performance hound, or if you like stability, or if you like great support,

12:53.300 --> 12:56.900
or a nice clean API that integrates with tools and libraries that you're already familiar

12:56.900 --> 12:59.180
with, Linode is a great option.

12:59.180 --> 13:03.520
You see, they've been doing this for over 19 years, or at least almost 19 years now,

13:03.520 --> 13:04.520
they're somewhere in that range.

13:04.520 --> 13:07.260
I used to say 18 years, but I realized that was a year ago.

13:07.260 --> 13:08.260
Because Linode's been great.

13:08.260 --> 13:10.700
They've been supporting the Coder radio show for a while.

13:10.700 --> 13:11.700
Because they get it.

13:11.700 --> 13:15.060
And they know that you guys out there are the perfect audience for something like this.

13:15.060 --> 13:16.060
So go try it for yourself.

13:16.060 --> 13:17.240
Go see it's real.

13:17.240 --> 13:21.300
Go build something, go test something, go learn something, and use it for your next

13:21.300 --> 13:22.300
project.

13:22.300 --> 13:24.180
You go to linode.com slash coder.

13:24.180 --> 13:26.640
That's where you go to get the $100 in 60 day credit.

13:26.640 --> 13:33.560
And it's how you support the show, linode.com slash coder.

13:33.560 --> 13:36.380
So apparently, we have a Heroku takedown.

13:36.380 --> 13:39.340
And I can't disagree with pretty much any of this.

13:39.340 --> 13:42.880
The piece is titled Why Did Heroku Fail?

13:42.880 --> 13:46.500
If you don't remember Heroku started what, 15 years ago?

13:46.500 --> 13:47.500
Something like that.

13:47.500 --> 13:48.500
Yeah.

13:48.500 --> 13:49.500
Yeah.

13:49.500 --> 13:52.460
They did a whole rebuild in 2009.

13:52.460 --> 13:57.620
And then in 2010, they were sold to Salesforce for 212 million.

13:57.620 --> 14:02.260
And Heroku always had a pricing problem, in my opinion, and every time we've talked about

14:02.260 --> 14:06.580
it, that's always been one of the issues kind of underlying it is because they're running

14:06.580 --> 14:09.460
on top of EC2, their run costs are high.

14:09.460 --> 14:11.100
And they were higher back then, of course.

14:11.100 --> 14:12.100
Right.

14:12.100 --> 14:13.340
Yeah, they've addressed some of that now.

14:13.340 --> 14:19.980
But you look at Heroku and you think to yourself, I mean, I could do this kind of on a linode

14:19.980 --> 14:20.980
now.

14:20.980 --> 14:24.380
And I wonder if that isn't part of the problem is they're just not as needed as they once

14:24.380 --> 14:25.380
were.

14:25.380 --> 14:28.820
Because now you've got a lot of options for deploying software anywhere you want and really

14:28.820 --> 14:29.820
abstracting it away.

14:29.820 --> 14:30.820
Yeah.

14:30.820 --> 14:31.820
I think there's a few things.

14:31.820 --> 14:37.260
But you know, for me, my introduction to Heroku was when I was first getting into Rails.

14:37.260 --> 14:40.300
And at the time, Heroku was very Rails centric.

14:40.300 --> 14:41.300
Totally.

14:41.300 --> 14:42.300
And that, you know, it sounds silly.

14:42.300 --> 14:46.920
And I know the hardcore, you have to put yourself back then, right?

14:46.920 --> 14:52.380
There wasn't like, Docker Hub, where you could just pull random stuff that you need.

14:52.380 --> 15:00.480
The whole DevOps, even on a small scale infrastructure, just it was still pretty obnoxious.

15:00.480 --> 15:02.260
Heroku had that beautiful marketplace.

15:02.260 --> 15:04.980
You want to add paper trail for logging for your app?

15:04.980 --> 15:05.980
Go ahead.

15:05.980 --> 15:10.420
And here's a two thing, two line thing you have to do to the Rails config to make it

15:10.420 --> 15:11.420
work.

15:11.420 --> 15:12.420
Oh, and we're Heroku.

15:12.420 --> 15:14.140
So we do all the DNS and all that for you.

15:14.140 --> 15:15.140
So we gotcha.

15:15.140 --> 15:16.140
Don't worry.

15:16.140 --> 15:22.500
I kind of feel like the pain point was when they, correctly, because Rails is popularity,

15:22.500 --> 15:26.620
you know, it wasn't going to take them everywhere they needed to go, in terms of just market

15:26.620 --> 15:28.140
penetration.

15:28.140 --> 15:34.420
Well, once they went more generic, and they tried to add other stacks, it really, it just

15:34.420 --> 15:37.220
made it worse, I think, in a lot of ways.

15:37.220 --> 15:40.440
And of course, the pricing where the dinos were expensive.

15:40.440 --> 15:45.520
And I think we'd be remiss if we don't mention just some of the massive security breaches

15:45.520 --> 15:46.520
they just had.

15:46.520 --> 15:49.940
Yeah, that definitely doesn't help with the whole publicity and adoption.

15:49.940 --> 15:56.220
I don't know, I feel like also, a lot of what made it so slick was what they took care of

15:56.220 --> 16:03.260
and get up actions came along and a lot of ci pipelines that just sort of come out of

16:03.260 --> 16:08.500
the box came along and one click deployments of entire applications became a lot more common

16:08.500 --> 16:13.860
and there just started to be one less reason after one less reason.

16:13.860 --> 16:15.980
I mean, they're still around, right?

16:15.980 --> 16:16.980
They're still going.

16:16.980 --> 16:21.220
I mean, they've made it 15 years in so in some ways, maybe it's not a failure.

16:21.220 --> 16:24.580
But when you look at the adoption trend, when you look at where they're going, you look

16:24.580 --> 16:29.260
at their revenue, it kind of looks like days are limited, especially now that they're owned

16:29.260 --> 16:30.260
by Salesforce.

16:30.260 --> 16:33.660
Like, are they really committed to just dumping more and more money in this thing to compete

16:33.660 --> 16:37.860
with AWS, Azure, Linode and, and those guys?

16:37.860 --> 16:41.500
Oh, I don't, I don't think they have to I think Heroku is like, it's fine being owned

16:41.500 --> 16:45.560
by Salesforce, I would argue is almost part of the problem, right?

16:45.560 --> 16:49.860
They didn't take bets they ought to have taken because, you know, you know how it is when

16:49.860 --> 16:54.820
a startup gets bought by a big company, you get a brain drain of the people who, oh, you

16:54.820 --> 17:00.780
want me to fill out some like, compliance form, because your HR has this policy.

17:00.780 --> 17:03.860
Oh, there's mandatory training.

17:03.860 --> 17:07.500
I mean, you've come on, you've you've definitely seen this before,

17:07.500 --> 17:12.740
the inclination to take risks, kind of just vaporizes, right, because when you work in

17:12.740 --> 17:17.900
an organization like that, there's no one really who owns a particular initiative.

17:17.900 --> 17:21.260
So no one's, no one's really on the line if something doesn't go through.

17:21.260 --> 17:26.340
And so we that just sort of as a culture that prevents risk taking, in my opinion,

17:26.340 --> 17:27.340
go for sure.

17:27.340 --> 17:32.800
I mean, I definitely would argue that the your incentives flip from we need to stay

17:32.800 --> 17:38.340
ahead of the curve and be competitive to we need to be stable and avoid lawsuits.

17:38.340 --> 17:39.340
Right?

17:39.340 --> 17:42.260
Yeah, we've got people that are paying for this, don't you know?

17:42.260 --> 17:46.860
Well, and like, we're big enough now that Oh, maybe it is worth somebody actually suing

17:46.860 --> 17:47.860
us.

17:47.860 --> 17:52.820
So, you know, maybe it's the spring air here in southern Oregon that I'm smelling the flowers

17:52.820 --> 17:56.300
bloom, or maybe it's that new fresh release candidate of TypeScript.

17:56.300 --> 17:59.620
Oh, look at that, the boys got a new TypeScript.

17:59.620 --> 18:00.620
That's right.

18:00.620 --> 18:01.620
It's a beta release.

18:01.620 --> 18:02.900
Well, I guess it's released candidate now.

18:02.900 --> 18:03.900
But it's close.

18:03.900 --> 18:04.900
It's not the final version.

18:04.900 --> 18:07.020
But it's really, it's nigh.

18:07.020 --> 18:11.520
I think probably the thing that they're at least the most excited about outwardly.

18:11.520 --> 18:15.460
This release also includes a new preview editor for the command go to source definition.

18:15.460 --> 18:18.780
I guess this can be helpful in cases where an ordinary go to definition command would

18:18.780 --> 18:23.860
take you to a declaration file, instead of the actual JavaScript or TypeScript source,

18:23.860 --> 18:26.380
which is annoying.

18:26.380 --> 18:30.620
And it also seems like they're starting to target node 16, even though they call it node

18:30.620 --> 18:31.620
12.

18:31.620 --> 18:35.560
In this release that part I don't get but there's there's a weird node versioning thing

18:35.560 --> 18:37.140
that's been going on for a while.

18:37.140 --> 18:39.280
But I mean, overall, I don't want to complain.

18:39.280 --> 18:40.900
I don't I'm not complaining.

18:40.900 --> 18:41.900
It's not my problem.

18:41.900 --> 18:42.900
I don't have to figure it out.

18:42.900 --> 18:43.900
So

18:43.900 --> 18:47.060
Yeah, you know, I write a fair amount of TypeScript.

18:47.060 --> 18:52.500
I mean, I find myself because I'm, you know, crotchety, falling back on because TypeScript

18:52.500 --> 18:58.620
is a pure superset of JavaScript, so you can only you know, all JavaScript is valid TypeScript.

18:58.620 --> 19:02.520
Finding myself wanting to ignore some of the TypeScript stuff.

19:02.520 --> 19:07.660
Because I'm lazy and trust me compiler, I do know what I'm doing, except I don't but

19:07.660 --> 19:10.500
I just want to like hit F5 and have this work.

19:10.500 --> 19:15.060
Still the language, you know, the language is younger than the show.

19:15.060 --> 19:16.260
I'm pretty sure.

19:16.260 --> 19:17.660
Yeah, I think so.

19:17.660 --> 19:18.660
Wow.

19:18.660 --> 19:24.620
It started off as syntactic sugar to JavaScript to do like soft type annotations or not solve

19:24.620 --> 19:27.480
a pretty, you know, it did to do typing, right?

19:27.480 --> 19:32.700
It reminds me a lot of, frankly, the Python three stuff where, you know, they have the

19:32.700 --> 19:36.060
type hinting, but it's super weak, and there's all kinds of weird cases in it.

19:36.060 --> 19:40.540
Well, TypeScript has just gone in and I out statically typed and all that goodness.

19:40.540 --> 19:44.620
You know, I'm not a TypeScript is the future of web development.

19:44.620 --> 19:49.880
Never ever do pure JavaScript again kind of guy, but it's starting to look like a more

19:49.880 --> 19:50.940
robust language.

19:50.940 --> 19:53.420
I mean, it looks a hell of a lot like C sharp these days.

19:53.420 --> 19:57.220
A lot of positive sentiment towards TypeScript out there these days.

19:57.220 --> 19:59.100
It's also the same guy who created C sharp.

19:59.100 --> 20:03.380
They've earned a special spot TypeScript 4.7 is nigh.

20:03.380 --> 20:07.740
We'll put a link in the show notes if you'd like to read more about it.

20:07.740 --> 20:14.180
We both had an interesting and perhaps underwhelmed takeaway from Google IO.

20:14.180 --> 20:18.260
I thought I noticed that your top thing was Flutter three was announced.

20:18.260 --> 20:22.280
You know, Flutter is one of these projects that people keep telling me about and I keep

20:22.280 --> 20:23.700
saying, oh, that looks really cool.

20:23.700 --> 20:25.940
Oh, it's made by Google.

20:25.940 --> 20:26.940
Waiting for it to die.

20:26.940 --> 20:30.660
Yeah, I'm just like waiting for it to to to go.

20:30.660 --> 20:33.540
I mean, shall we say the names reader wave?

20:33.540 --> 20:34.540
We could do that.

20:34.540 --> 20:41.180
Yeah, I think what gives Flutter a fighting chance is that it is, I think, tied in with

20:41.180 --> 20:43.640
their overall fuchsia initiatives, too.

20:43.640 --> 20:44.860
And they've been sticking with us.

20:44.860 --> 20:49.260
They like they've never really officially made a big stink about fuchsia other than

20:49.260 --> 20:52.660
a few blog posts and, you know, put it on a few of their devices.

20:52.660 --> 20:58.060
It seems like fuchsia is like this long term skunkworks project, probably ultimately to

20:58.060 --> 20:59.780
replace Linux.

20:59.780 --> 21:05.920
And Flutter is maybe important for the client side of that or for the front end UI stuff.

21:05.920 --> 21:12.620
So I think I think I might be wrong, but I think fuchsia and Dart have to die for Flutter

21:12.620 --> 21:13.620
to die.

21:13.620 --> 21:16.140
Maybe they could kill Flutter without killing those things.

21:16.140 --> 21:17.140
I might be wrong.

21:17.140 --> 21:18.620
I don't think fuchsia is going anywhere.

21:18.620 --> 21:19.620
Yeah.

21:19.620 --> 21:21.020
Well, I mean, you never know.

21:21.020 --> 21:25.140
There's the most proto Microsoft company out there these days.

21:25.140 --> 21:29.860
They are Microsoft of a different era with more money.

21:29.860 --> 21:35.100
And I actually felt like Google I.O. 2022 really put that on display.

21:35.100 --> 21:37.200
It really brought that home to me.

21:37.200 --> 21:41.800
It was a very cohesive Google I.O.

21:41.800 --> 21:45.100
It felt like it was put together by one team.

21:45.100 --> 21:50.600
Google I.O. usually feels very disparate, very disorganized, disjointed, like different

21:50.600 --> 21:54.600
fiefdoms create different parts of their keynote and then they go up there and present it to

21:54.600 --> 21:58.860
each other, whereas this year it felt cohesive.

21:58.860 --> 22:03.940
It felt like a singular, boring corporate message.

22:03.940 --> 22:05.740
And I'm kind of sad to see it.

22:05.740 --> 22:07.620
They needed to get there.

22:07.620 --> 22:14.460
But this must have been the most low key, low hype Google I.O. I've ever seen.

22:14.460 --> 22:22.260
And by my account, we got seven product announcements and none of them are very interesting.

22:22.260 --> 22:23.860
This is a week year.

22:23.860 --> 22:27.740
And I agree with you that it was boring as hell, but should we just go through the seven

22:27.740 --> 22:28.740
highlights?

22:28.740 --> 22:29.740
Sure.

22:29.740 --> 22:30.740
Yeah.

22:30.740 --> 22:33.220
So off the bat, this is actually my favorite one.

22:33.220 --> 22:37.340
Automatic summaries to Google Docs and chat, and I'm aware we don't call it Google Docs

22:37.340 --> 22:38.340
anymore.

22:38.340 --> 22:39.340
I don't think we do.

22:39.340 --> 22:40.340
Who knows?

22:40.340 --> 22:41.340
They change the name every week.

22:41.340 --> 22:42.340
That's kind of cool.

22:42.340 --> 22:44.980
Again, it's not super developer centric.

22:44.980 --> 22:46.860
There's a new face lighting effect in Meet.

22:46.860 --> 22:47.860
Awesome.

22:47.860 --> 22:50.500
The more you can copy Apple, the better.

22:50.500 --> 22:51.860
Wallet on Wear OS.

22:51.860 --> 22:52.860
Wear OS.

22:52.860 --> 22:57.340
OK, I can't believe I can't believe they didn't have that already.

22:57.340 --> 22:58.340
Yeah.

22:58.340 --> 23:00.340
Pixel watch.

23:00.340 --> 23:01.900
Great.

23:01.900 --> 23:05.100
I guess Pixel six and seven.

23:05.100 --> 23:06.100
I'm sorry.

23:06.100 --> 23:09.300
Pixel six, a Pixel seven and Pixel Pro.

23:09.300 --> 23:12.980
This one was weird to me because, like, they made such a fuss about the six coming out

23:12.980 --> 23:16.820
and they've kind of immediately shot their own product in the face.

23:16.820 --> 23:17.820
Right.

23:17.820 --> 23:21.660
And they're not going to sell any of the Pixel sixes now that the six and the seven and seven

23:21.660 --> 23:25.700
Pro have been announced, like they've just killed all of their future sales.

23:25.700 --> 23:28.060
Google Pixel tablet.

23:28.060 --> 23:32.620
This is a little interesting because I could see it in enterprise environments being like

23:32.620 --> 23:39.220
you want to run tablet software in your factory or, you know, produce production facility

23:39.220 --> 23:42.480
and you don't want to deal with Apple side learning problems.

23:42.480 --> 23:45.700
But again, there's no guarantee of what exactly that's going to be.

23:45.700 --> 23:49.940
And I like how you put this Google AirPods.

23:49.940 --> 23:53.900
Yeah, I just want to say Samsung has had them.

23:53.900 --> 23:54.900
Bose has them.

23:54.900 --> 23:55.900
Right.

23:55.900 --> 23:56.900
Sony.

23:56.900 --> 23:57.900
Sony has really good ones.

23:57.900 --> 24:04.700
It's incredible that Google has just has no capability of recognizing that the market

24:04.700 --> 24:07.540
already has this solved and that they have no shot.

24:07.540 --> 24:09.180
And then they just go for it.

24:09.180 --> 24:12.620
And then they get like, you know, 200000 sales.

24:12.620 --> 24:13.620
That's it.

24:13.620 --> 24:14.620
Yeah.

24:14.620 --> 24:15.620
This is really wild.

24:15.620 --> 24:19.340
Also, I don't know if you caught this, but the Pixel watch, it's going to be a round

24:19.340 --> 24:20.340
play.

24:20.340 --> 24:21.340
Yeah, that's.

24:21.340 --> 24:23.220
Yeah, that's I mean, although the Android Wear watches, it's nice.

24:23.220 --> 24:24.220
It's nice looking.

24:24.220 --> 24:25.220
Yeah.

24:25.220 --> 24:26.220
I don't know.

24:26.220 --> 24:29.800
I've had both Android Wear circle, you know, circular watches and I've had Android Wear

24:29.800 --> 24:34.460
square watches and the circular watches always are always cutting off parts of the UI.

24:34.460 --> 24:36.180
It never has really worked very well.

24:36.180 --> 24:38.580
So I'm pretty skeptical of the circular watch display.

24:38.580 --> 24:41.260
Obviously, Google has the opportunity here to customize the UI.

24:41.260 --> 24:44.580
The question is, will they or will it just be like a top layer and then you get down

24:44.580 --> 24:47.380
into the Wear OS and it's UI elements are getting cut off.

24:47.380 --> 24:51.540
Also, I don't know if you notice this, they promoted this like it's a benefit, but I think

24:51.540 --> 24:53.860
it's actually going to be a pain in the butt.

24:53.860 --> 24:58.380
They're integrating Fitbit with the watch, but you still have to maintain a separate

24:58.380 --> 24:59.380
Fitbit account.

24:59.380 --> 25:03.140
So you have your Google account, you have to get on the watch and you have to log into

25:03.140 --> 25:08.500
your Fitbit account on the watch to use them, even though Google owns Fitbit.

25:08.500 --> 25:10.140
Maybe it's a regulatory requirement.

25:10.140 --> 25:13.540
I don't know, but it just sounds messy.

25:13.540 --> 25:20.920
The tablet, the 7, the 7 Pro, and I believe the 6A, and I believe the AirPods, all just

25:20.920 --> 25:26.700
got kind of, and the Pixel Watch, all just got like, you know, probably in the fall,

25:26.700 --> 25:29.740
in the future, we're going to release these products.

25:29.740 --> 25:33.000
Only one or two of these things they announced at Google IO are even going to ship probably

25:33.000 --> 25:34.860
before the end of the year.

25:34.860 --> 25:36.220
When have we seen this before?

25:36.220 --> 25:38.300
And a number of these are going to get canceled.

25:38.300 --> 25:40.320
And they're going to suck.

25:40.320 --> 25:44.940
And then there was the other aspect of this IO, the entire IO that bugged me.

25:44.940 --> 25:50.300
And I think all companies do this, but they're really trying to position themselves as like

25:50.300 --> 25:56.140
this feel good, warm, we're doing this for the good of the people company, you know,

25:56.140 --> 25:58.720
that all big corporations are trying to do now.

25:58.720 --> 26:05.540
But it really felt over the top when at the very end of the keynote, it's not very classy,

26:05.540 --> 26:09.220
but they basically do a one more thing moment, you know, they ape Steve Jobs there for a

26:09.220 --> 26:10.220
second.

26:10.220 --> 26:12.100
They do have one more thing.

26:12.100 --> 26:18.500
And it was yet another, even further out in the future, absolutely no timeline product.

26:18.500 --> 26:20.540
We have no idea where this is coming.

26:20.540 --> 26:22.640
And they teased Google AR glasses.

26:22.640 --> 26:26.640
And I grabbed like a minute of the presentation.

26:26.640 --> 26:30.480
I just want to play it for you so you can get an idea of like the vibe they're trying

26:30.480 --> 26:33.740
to go for and the feelings they're trying to get you to feel.

26:33.740 --> 26:38.020
It all felt very manipulative.

26:38.020 --> 26:52.140
My mother speaks Mandarin, and I speak English, which is a strange thing.

26:52.140 --> 27:00.100
We'd love to be able to share with you a new prototype we've been working on.

27:00.100 --> 27:05.100
You should be seeing what I'm saying, just transcribed for you in real time, kind of

27:05.100 --> 27:08.780
like subtitles for the world.

27:08.780 --> 27:14.380
What we're working on is technology that enables us to break down language barriers, taking

27:14.380 --> 27:18.860
years of research in Google Translate and bringing that to glasses.

27:18.860 --> 27:19.860
You see me?

27:19.860 --> 27:21.860
Oh, si, si, te veo.

27:21.860 --> 27:23.300
Oh, my God.

27:23.300 --> 27:27.700
I'm actually looking straight into your eyes, and it seems like you're looking right at

27:27.700 --> 27:28.700
me.

27:28.700 --> 27:30.740
Oh, si, si, estoy viendo lo que estas diciendo para yo.

27:30.740 --> 27:36.100
Making access to information just instant and intuitive, by doing that, technology fades

27:36.100 --> 27:46.020
into the background, and we're more connected with the people and the things around us.

27:46.020 --> 27:49.020
Google wants you to know that they can out AR anybody.

27:49.020 --> 27:50.940
They are so into AR.

27:50.940 --> 27:53.140
Google VR, forget all about that.

27:53.140 --> 27:55.540
Google is so into AR.

27:55.540 --> 28:02.260
I mean, listen, when it comes to cheap, low-rent emotional manipulation, you've seen Apple.

28:02.260 --> 28:06.540
Wait till you meet Google.

28:06.540 --> 28:09.260
I would love to think that that demo was real.

28:09.260 --> 28:14.340
Yeah, they faked past demos.

28:14.340 --> 28:19.340
I wonder if we'll ever get these developer conferences to feel like developer conferences

28:19.340 --> 28:23.780
again, or if they're just always going to be consumer device pitches, always now.

28:23.780 --> 28:24.780
So it's worse than that, right?

28:24.780 --> 28:33.020
It's always consumer device pitches, and since COVID, they're really like glossy, you know,

28:33.020 --> 28:36.540
this is who we are, like identity opportunities for the marketing department.

28:36.540 --> 28:39.980
Yeah, yeah, and they really put it, they really gave it all in this one.

28:39.980 --> 28:41.220
They put it all in there.

28:41.220 --> 28:46.100
They packed it, and the only justification you could even claim that this is for developers

28:46.100 --> 28:51.100
is that in a remote, roundabout way, it's giving developers a heads up about devices

28:51.100 --> 28:56.180
they could be able to build apps for possibly, but with no details, you know, just vague

28:56.180 --> 28:58.180
recollection and idea.

28:58.180 --> 28:59.180
Maybe right?

28:59.180 --> 29:00.180
Like it's all maybe.

29:00.180 --> 29:01.180
Yeah.

29:01.180 --> 29:05.780
So I mean, geez, I guess we've just maybe normalized it with Apple.

29:05.780 --> 29:12.980
But where it does seem a little bit different is Apple does seem to remember is for developers,

29:12.980 --> 29:18.380
and they do, even during the main keynote, which is for the press, they do drop more

29:18.380 --> 29:22.460
developer focused stuff in there about the API and about when that kit is going to be

29:22.460 --> 29:23.460
available.

29:23.460 --> 29:24.600
And that is at least useful.

29:24.600 --> 29:29.280
But the other thing is, and you put it really well, is what Google's doing there feels like

29:29.280 --> 29:31.980
low rent emotional manipulation.

29:31.980 --> 29:37.940
And when Apple does it, it feels like they paid a Hollywood movie crew $10 million to

29:37.940 --> 29:42.460
make that five minute video segment, you know, and it's just a, it's a whole different scale

29:42.460 --> 29:44.900
of manipulation.

29:44.900 --> 29:50.940
It's luxury emotional manipulation.

29:50.940 --> 29:53.660
tailscale.com slash coder.

29:53.660 --> 29:56.980
Go there for a free personal account for up to 20 devices and you go there to support

29:56.980 --> 29:57.980
the show.

29:57.980 --> 30:03.300
tailscale is a zero config VPN, it installs on any device in minutes, it'll manage your

30:03.300 --> 30:08.180
firewall rules, and it'll even work with those dreaded double net situations.

30:08.180 --> 30:10.140
It really works from anywhere.

30:10.140 --> 30:13.960
I literally have not found a place where it does not work yet.

30:13.960 --> 30:18.580
Devices connect directly to each other using wire guards noise protocol encryption.

30:18.580 --> 30:24.060
So you build a flat mesh network based around the best security in the business.

30:24.060 --> 30:28.260
Wire guard has changed the game, and tailscale brings it to the people.

30:28.260 --> 30:34.060
You can easily and quickly create a secure network between your servers, computers, cloud

30:34.060 --> 30:37.460
instances, virtual machines, and so on.

30:37.460 --> 30:41.600
Even when you have firewalls and subnets and all that stuff between you tailscale makes

30:41.600 --> 30:42.600
it work.

30:42.600 --> 30:47.740
I've got it run everything from arch servers on x86 boxes to Raspberry Pi is running open

30:47.740 --> 30:51.200
Suse and my iPad, I'm remote right now.

30:51.200 --> 30:54.880
And I have the ability to connect to all of my systems in the studio so I can continue

30:54.880 --> 31:01.160
all of my show production stuff, manage my mixer, even remote live stream all through

31:01.160 --> 31:02.160
tailscale.

31:02.160 --> 31:03.860
I'm doing it right now.

31:03.860 --> 31:05.540
As I record this.

31:05.540 --> 31:06.540
It's so powerful.

31:06.540 --> 31:08.600
It's changed the way I work.

31:08.600 --> 31:09.880
I'll never go back.

31:09.880 --> 31:14.780
And by the way, in the most recent episode of Linux unplugged, we featured a great in

31:14.780 --> 31:17.880
depth conversation with one of the co founders of tailscale.

31:17.880 --> 31:22.800
And it gave me new insights into how tailscale is sustainable, and how it's built and set

31:22.800 --> 31:27.800
up differently than almost any tech company in the last decade, really insightful conversation

31:27.800 --> 31:28.800
with Avery.

31:28.800 --> 31:32.880
So go check out the most recent Linux unplugged, because that was tops.

31:32.880 --> 31:34.960
We also talked about the new Nvidia stuff in there.

31:34.960 --> 31:36.300
I love tailscale.

31:36.300 --> 31:38.000
My connections are always on.

31:38.000 --> 31:41.800
I just now have bookmarks for all my different web dashboards and stuff that are on the tailscale

31:41.800 --> 31:42.800
IP.

31:42.800 --> 31:46.620
So no matter where I'm at, I just use the same bookmarks in my web browser.

31:46.620 --> 31:48.480
It's so flawless.

31:48.480 --> 31:51.500
And you can try it for free for up to 20 machines.

31:51.500 --> 31:54.620
And they've built the service so that way that plan can last.

31:54.620 --> 31:57.720
Go check it out and support the show and give it a go.

31:57.720 --> 32:00.560
You go to tailscale.com slash coder.

32:00.560 --> 32:01.560
You'll thank me.

32:01.560 --> 32:06.000
Trust me, once you get this up and running, you will thank me try it out tailscale.com

32:06.000 --> 32:10.200

32:10.200 --> 32:16.800
It's official remote work has zero, absolutely zero negative impacts on your productivity.

32:16.800 --> 32:22.400
According to a research team from Texas A&M University School of Public Health, it's concluded

32:22.400 --> 32:28.480
in this study that employees and company resiliency is actually enhanced through remote work.

32:28.480 --> 32:30.800
And they published a statement last Friday.

32:30.800 --> 32:35.980
The study went beyond just assessing the productivity to examine the causes of workplace injuries

32:35.980 --> 32:41.640
and they actually found that it was important for employees to take regular breaks.

32:41.640 --> 32:49.680
And if they work from home, workplace injuries drop dramatically.

32:49.680 --> 32:51.080
Because they're not workplace injuries.

32:51.080 --> 32:52.080
I know.

32:52.080 --> 32:53.880
But what do you think of this?

32:53.880 --> 32:54.880
Their study?

32:54.880 --> 33:00.240
I mean, I got to imagine you just disagree up up and down, but their study says it zero

33:00.240 --> 33:02.120
negative impact on productivity.

33:02.120 --> 33:04.080
I feel like that statement has to be false.

33:04.080 --> 33:09.200
One, anecdotal, right, my own experience and two, you know, it's such an absolute statement.

33:09.200 --> 33:12.160
You know, zero, all right.

33:12.160 --> 33:14.000
No, I don't agree.

33:14.000 --> 33:17.720
I mean, I I've come to terms with the realities of remote work.

33:17.720 --> 33:18.720
Now.

33:18.720 --> 33:19.720
It's funny.

33:19.720 --> 33:20.720
I was an early proponent.

33:20.720 --> 33:21.720
I think as were you, right?

33:21.720 --> 33:25.200
And then as everybody did it, I realized one of the things I liked about it was that it

33:25.200 --> 33:28.600
was a nice perk to have in the hiring process.

33:28.600 --> 33:33.600
Now that it's not, it's like, Oh, what a panda, but yeah, it does have its drawbacks.

33:33.600 --> 33:38.400
They say, though, that in the study, almost all of the employees were right back up to

33:38.400 --> 33:41.920
the same level of output as they were during or before Hurricane Harvey.

33:41.920 --> 33:43.640
That's when they were checking this.

33:43.640 --> 33:48.320
And they say the huge message for employers right now is employees should be able to work

33:48.320 --> 33:52.160
remotely or they should be able to work in a hybrid schedule because the productivity

33:52.160 --> 33:53.920
gains are definitely there.

33:53.920 --> 33:57.880
And I was thinking about this and wondering, well, if they if Texas A&M actually studied

33:57.880 --> 34:00.760
this, what were they finding?

34:00.760 --> 34:06.840
And I think they were finding that there is indeed some work that is better from home.

34:06.840 --> 34:08.880
I've done a little bit of a study myself.

34:08.880 --> 34:13.560
I have a little bit of empirical data and it's it's as simple as this.

34:13.560 --> 34:18.300
I have taken this RV that I'm sitting in right now and I have parked it right next to buildings

34:18.300 --> 34:20.200
that I have worked out of.

34:20.200 --> 34:22.120
And I did this a lot at Linux Academy.

34:22.120 --> 34:27.520
And there were definitely times where I would step outside my RV and I would walk five minutes

34:27.520 --> 34:32.160
into the building, key card in, go into an office and I would have meetings and I would

34:32.160 --> 34:34.360
do work there in the office.

34:34.360 --> 34:38.360
And then there were other times in the day where I'd walk outside the building and I'd

34:38.360 --> 34:44.820
walk into the RV and I do a totally different kind of work in the RV, like like phone calls

34:44.820 --> 34:46.880
and emails and show prep.

34:46.880 --> 34:52.160
I did better in the RV, but in office I did better when I was working on the new art and

34:52.160 --> 34:53.640
logo designs with people there.

34:53.640 --> 34:56.960
I had a better I had better interactions at the meeting tables with people and then we

34:56.960 --> 34:58.800
would go to lunch together and that kind of stuff.

34:58.800 --> 35:03.040
And so for me, I really found benefits in both.

35:03.040 --> 35:06.560
But I realized that large companies, they have a hard time with these nuances.

35:06.560 --> 35:08.320
And Apple is one of them.

35:08.320 --> 35:11.320
And they've really laid down the law and said, you're coming back to work.

35:11.320 --> 35:15.080
And as a result, their director of machine learning has resigned.

35:15.080 --> 35:17.600
And he says it's due to the return to office policy.

35:17.600 --> 35:23.480
I just want to say, even I think this is a huge fork up on Apple's part, massive, massive,

35:23.480 --> 35:25.320
like somebody of that caliber.

35:25.320 --> 35:29.000
It's not just a random dev that's going to be like slinging C sharp or Python or whatever

35:29.000 --> 35:32.120
this it was a big win for them when they got this dude, right?

35:32.120 --> 35:33.600
They were crowing about it.

35:33.600 --> 35:34.800
Yeah, Ian Goodfellow.

35:34.800 --> 35:35.800
Yeah.

35:35.800 --> 35:40.480
So he's supposedly the guy who created GAN, which is generative adversarial network, which

35:40.480 --> 35:45.760
is a huge innovation in the field of deep learning and machine learning into the whole

35:45.760 --> 35:48.000
adversarial network idea is sort of key.

35:48.000 --> 35:50.300
He created it, Apple swooped him up.

35:50.300 --> 35:51.920
It was a big deal.

35:51.920 --> 35:53.680
I think he was born in the late 80s.

35:53.680 --> 35:57.040
So you know, he's in his 30s.

35:57.040 --> 35:59.280
And he's immensely hirable.

35:59.280 --> 36:04.780
And he wrote in his resignation email, quote, I believe strongly that more flexibility would

36:04.780 --> 36:07.720
have been the best policy for my team.

36:07.720 --> 36:12.400
And he's out Microsoft and basically every other tech, I'm like, my homie.

36:12.400 --> 36:13.400
Yeah.

36:13.400 --> 36:14.400
Come over here.

36:14.400 --> 36:16.420
You'll you can work remote for us, right?

36:16.420 --> 36:18.920
Have you considered calling a Cortana?

36:18.920 --> 36:19.920
Sorry.

36:19.920 --> 36:20.920
Yeah.

36:20.920 --> 36:21.920
There is a bit of an irony.

36:21.920 --> 36:24.240
Fig jam on Twitter pointed this out to us.

36:24.240 --> 36:28.600
He says these tech companies have created all of this hardware and software to connect

36:28.600 --> 36:32.600
people and enable them to collaborate and create from all over the world, but yet they

36:32.600 --> 36:34.640
can't use these tools themselves.

36:34.640 --> 36:36.800
What happened to eating your own dog food?

36:36.800 --> 36:38.840
And I think fig jam has a point.

36:38.840 --> 36:44.080
If anybody should be able to make remote work work, shouldn't it be Apple?

36:44.080 --> 36:47.580
Shouldn't it be these companies like Facebook and Microsoft that are telling all these employees

36:47.580 --> 36:48.580
to come back?

36:48.580 --> 36:52.640
I mean, Microsoft created teams, or at least, you know, adopted, and then we keep hitting

36:52.640 --> 36:54.700
this pretty hard almost every couple weeks.

36:54.700 --> 36:58.320
The reality is for small businesses, I think remote work is going to be a fact of life,

36:58.320 --> 37:03.040
especially in the tech field, because it's too hard to be competitive without it now.

37:03.040 --> 37:07.600
I can see why, especially a company like Apple would be pretty aggressively trying to bring

37:07.600 --> 37:08.600
people back.

37:08.600 --> 37:13.540
See, I'm wondering if the reason I used to think it worked better was because it wasn't

37:13.540 --> 37:15.600
forced on me, right?

37:15.600 --> 37:19.840
And it was like a perk I could give, people were enthusiastic about it, they'd really

37:19.840 --> 37:21.280
go all in.

37:21.280 --> 37:24.400
Now that it's like something that basically is expected.

37:24.400 --> 37:25.840
The power dynamic has changed.

37:25.840 --> 37:31.640
It goes from something that you can grant for periods of time, but still have control

37:31.640 --> 37:36.000
over, to now something that they're expecting of you, and you're trying to claw back a little

37:36.000 --> 37:37.000
bit of that control.

37:37.000 --> 37:39.960
I wouldn't even know if it's really a power dynamic, it's more, you know, I found that

37:39.960 --> 37:43.520
people were so excited to work from home, that they would really like put in the extra

37:43.520 --> 37:46.000
mile and be super communicative.

37:46.000 --> 37:48.920
And I'm just, you know, I'm interviewing people.

37:48.920 --> 37:54.000
And it's like, of course, it's work from home, like everybody just expects it now.

37:54.000 --> 37:57.080
It's not as much of a deal sealer, I guess.

37:57.080 --> 37:58.080
Hmm.

37:58.080 --> 37:59.080
Well, all right.

37:59.080 --> 38:02.640
I think the reason why I wanted to bring it up is because of Goodwin quitting Apple over

38:02.640 --> 38:03.640
it.

38:03.640 --> 38:07.940
And you know how these companies are so about their machine learning, and all of their products

38:07.940 --> 38:11.600
being improved with it, and now, Goodfellas out.

38:11.600 --> 38:15.200
It seems like if Apple wasn't willing to bend for them, they're probably not going to bend

38:15.200 --> 38:17.420
for anybody on this.

38:17.420 --> 38:18.560
And I thought Fig-Chan made a good point.

38:18.560 --> 38:19.560
All right.

38:19.560 --> 38:22.360
So let's, you mentioned a book this week in our Slack chat called Python Distilled.

38:22.360 --> 38:23.360
Yeah.

38:23.360 --> 38:26.080
For the gentlemen and gentle ladies out there looking to do a little Python.

38:26.080 --> 38:29.200
For any snake charmers or prospective snake charmers.

38:29.200 --> 38:30.200
It's pretty good.

38:30.200 --> 38:34.920
You know, it has that kind of few intro chapters that are, you know, you're probably gonna

38:34.920 --> 38:38.320
skip if you've done any real development.

38:38.320 --> 38:39.640
But if not, that's cool, too.

38:39.640 --> 38:42.000
But I like the perspective, the guy's name is Beasley.

38:42.000 --> 38:44.560
I hope I'm not butchering it, David Beasley.

38:44.560 --> 38:50.000
He takes a very practical, very, this is a feature of Python you could use.

38:50.000 --> 38:53.720
It's starting with, I think, 3.8, if I'm not mistaken.

38:53.720 --> 38:55.440
So like modern Python.

38:55.440 --> 38:58.200
And these are real world problems where this makes sense.

38:58.200 --> 38:59.200
Great pick.

38:59.200 --> 39:02.200
We'll put a link to that at coder.show slash, what is this, 466?

39:02.200 --> 39:03.200
Yeah.

39:03.200 --> 39:04.200
666.

39:04.200 --> 39:05.200
Or 466.

39:05.200 --> 39:06.200
Ah.

39:06.200 --> 39:07.200
I know.

39:07.200 --> 39:08.200
You know, but it does mean we've rounded the corner to 500.

39:08.200 --> 39:09.200
You realize.

39:09.200 --> 39:10.200
That's a lot.

39:10.200 --> 39:11.200
I know.

39:11.200 --> 39:12.200
What do you even do for 500?

39:12.200 --> 39:13.200
What do you even do?

39:13.200 --> 39:17.080
Invert the show into a next theme show.

39:17.080 --> 39:18.080
And a video show, right?

39:18.080 --> 39:19.740
All YouTube, all the time.

39:19.740 --> 39:21.240
We can switch from Boost to Super Chats.

39:21.240 --> 39:22.240
That'd be great.

39:22.240 --> 39:23.240
Now we go on Twitch.

39:23.240 --> 39:27.480
Yeah, ask everybody to become members or whatever it is over there.

39:27.480 --> 39:29.800
Wait, can't we just like dance and go on TikTok?

39:29.800 --> 39:30.800
Yeah.

39:30.800 --> 39:34.240
Or, you know, I think if you just stand in a pool, you can wear a bathing suit and it's

39:34.240 --> 39:35.840
legit.

39:35.840 --> 39:37.320
I don't think that works for us.

39:37.320 --> 39:38.720
Oh, maybe not.

39:38.720 --> 39:39.840
And what if your hair gets wet?

39:39.840 --> 39:41.600
Yeah, it doesn't look as good.

39:41.600 --> 39:42.760
It bounces back quick.

39:42.760 --> 39:44.120
But while it's wet, it doesn't look so good.

39:44.120 --> 39:45.120
Well, naturally, of course.

39:45.120 --> 39:51.780
I mean, you know what I've discovered traveling again, is it really is the greatest gift when

39:51.780 --> 39:54.800
it comes to my email, because I get so much damn email.

39:54.800 --> 39:57.520
And so I can just tell people, oh, sorry, I'm traveling.

39:57.520 --> 40:00.960
I'm a little slow on my email right now, even though I'm always slow on my email, right?

40:00.960 --> 40:05.000
I'm always slow on my email, but now I have a reason for it.

40:05.000 --> 40:11.480
And it feels like a weight has been lifted off my shoulders, you know, on the lamb from

40:11.480 --> 40:12.480
your email.

40:12.480 --> 40:13.480
I mean, what the fuck?

40:13.480 --> 40:16.020
I think you well, I think you forget what it's like to travel.

40:16.020 --> 40:19.200
Like this is a nice aspect of traveling is like, oh, yeah, no, I'm sorry, I'm totally

40:19.200 --> 40:20.200
behind on that.

40:20.200 --> 40:21.200
And it's true.

40:21.200 --> 40:22.200
I am.

40:22.200 --> 40:23.200
I'm not lying.

40:23.200 --> 40:28.220
But I at least feel like clearly the rest of the world is is better at two life skills

40:28.220 --> 40:29.220
than I am.

40:29.220 --> 40:34.780
And one of them is committing to anything beyond three days, because my friends and

40:34.780 --> 40:38.360
family asked me to commit to stuff two, three weeks ahead of time.

40:38.360 --> 40:39.360
I know I hate that.

40:39.360 --> 40:40.620
Oh, it is honestly a struggle.

40:40.620 --> 40:44.560
I really don't understand how the rest of humanity has any idea what they're doing in

40:44.560 --> 40:45.560
two weeks.

40:45.560 --> 40:48.160
It just it doesn't make any sense.

40:48.160 --> 40:53.560
And I constantly am in that trap and I struggle and I say yes, and then I regret it.

40:53.560 --> 40:54.560
And it's the worst.

40:54.560 --> 40:58.060
And the other thing, the number two thing that I think humanity on a whole does better

40:58.060 --> 41:00.920
than me is getting back to their email.

41:00.920 --> 41:06.720
I turns out in the only person in the world who doesn't like just getting jobs dropped

41:06.720 --> 41:13.080
in my inbox with totally just arbitrary expectations of how fast I'm going to read, how fast I'm

41:13.080 --> 41:16.460
going to respond and how fast I'm going to take action on their question that they asked

41:16.460 --> 41:18.080
me to do in the email.

41:18.080 --> 41:21.520
And see, in my world, I see and this is where I'm so wrong because it's only me that thinks

41:21.520 --> 41:22.520
this way.

41:22.520 --> 41:27.700
In my world, I think I'm going to get to that on my terms when I have time to read my email.

41:27.700 --> 41:31.720
And if they're asking me to do something, I'm going to do that when I have time to do

41:31.720 --> 41:33.440
it, which might not be for a couple of days.

41:33.440 --> 41:36.720
But you see, the rest of the world, that's not how they think.

41:36.720 --> 41:39.340
They think I have sent this thing to Chris.

41:39.340 --> 41:41.040
It requires action on his part.

41:41.040 --> 41:43.880
I imagine he'll get it back to me in the next couple of hours.

41:43.880 --> 41:48.480
And then if a day or so goes by and I haven't gotten back to them, I then and this happens

41:48.480 --> 41:49.480
all the time.

41:49.480 --> 41:54.220
I get another email asking, hey, hey, I'm just following up, didn't hear back from you.

41:54.220 --> 41:59.740
And so by the time I often get to my email, I can have two or three like, hey, I really

41:59.740 --> 42:01.760
need this done or hey, I was wondering.

42:01.760 --> 42:06.360
And it's like, you know, been maybe three or four days since I saw their last email.

42:06.360 --> 42:09.880
And I'm the only person that's a problem with because clearly, everybody else does fine

42:09.880 --> 42:10.880
with that.

42:10.880 --> 42:12.360
Otherwise, people would stop it.

42:12.360 --> 42:17.820
And those two things, I feel like when I'm traveling, I'm off the hook on like I it's

42:17.820 --> 42:21.560
okay that I can't tell you where I'm going to be or if I can do something in a week because

42:21.560 --> 42:22.800
you know what I'm traveling.

42:22.800 --> 42:25.020
And so I'll just have to get back to you when I get back.

42:25.020 --> 42:26.020
And you know what?

42:26.020 --> 42:30.160
Sorry, I didn't take action on that and get that back to you within, you know, three hours

42:30.160 --> 42:32.880
I'm traveling and yesterday was a 10 hour drive day.

42:32.880 --> 42:34.000
And so I just didn't check my email.

42:34.000 --> 42:38.760
And like I have actual reasons and I feel like I'm not a failure.

42:38.760 --> 42:41.560
Email is a source of constant stress and anxiety for me.

42:41.560 --> 42:43.320
And I go through periods where it's better.

42:43.320 --> 42:44.580
And I go through periods where it's worse.

42:44.580 --> 42:49.620
And right now I'm going through one of the worst periods where it's just it's too much.

42:49.620 --> 42:53.560
And if I could do it over again, I would ask for I would ask for a system where I can just

42:53.560 --> 42:55.440
not accept emails for a while.

42:55.440 --> 42:59.000
Like sorry, for the next three days, Chris is not accepting new emails.

42:59.000 --> 43:00.780
Please try again when he arrives back.

43:00.780 --> 43:02.360
Why haven't we built that?

43:02.360 --> 43:04.160
And out of office is not enough.

43:04.160 --> 43:05.520
I don't know.

43:05.520 --> 43:08.360
I was crying.

43:08.360 --> 43:10.320
I think we just can't have it right.

43:10.320 --> 43:11.320
We can't have nice things.

43:11.320 --> 43:12.320
Can we?

43:12.320 --> 43:13.320
No.

43:13.320 --> 43:14.320
That's why.

43:14.320 --> 43:15.320
That's why I like boost.

43:15.320 --> 43:21.720
All right, Freak boosted in right as we were starting the show, actually, with 10000 sats.

43:21.720 --> 43:25.080
He says Star Trek Picard season two has its cringe.

43:25.080 --> 43:30.120
But at the end, with Q is very much Anne Rind meets Breaking Bad.

43:30.120 --> 43:31.120
But in a good way.

43:31.120 --> 43:32.600
I don't know what that means.

43:32.600 --> 43:34.200
But I was I was satisfied with the ending.

43:34.200 --> 43:35.640
I don't think we got to spoil it.

43:35.640 --> 43:37.100
Did you watch the end of Picard?

43:37.100 --> 43:38.100
I did not.

43:38.100 --> 43:40.100
So I lack the competence to answer this.

43:40.100 --> 43:45.200
They tied up a lot of the loose ends better than they do in most new Trek shows.

43:45.200 --> 43:47.800
So have you started the strange new worlds?

43:47.800 --> 43:49.920
No, I think it's the best.

43:49.920 --> 43:51.320
I'm watching the original series.

43:51.320 --> 43:52.320
I'm on season.

43:52.320 --> 43:53.320
I went back.

43:53.320 --> 43:54.320
Oh, yeah.

43:54.320 --> 43:55.320
Yeah, yeah.

43:55.320 --> 43:56.320
That's what we did, too.

43:56.320 --> 43:58.640
I think strange new worlds may have its issues, but I think it's the best of the new batch

43:58.640 --> 44:00.880
so far.

44:00.880 --> 44:01.880
It's worth it.

44:01.880 --> 44:03.960
Yeah, I think it's probably worth it.

44:03.960 --> 44:04.960
Boost.

44:04.960 --> 44:07.440
Dave Jones boosted in with 1000 sats.

44:07.440 --> 44:10.960
He says, Oh, I know of Microsoft Access.

44:10.960 --> 44:15.160
We actually have a secretary who insists on keeping her own version of our entire customer

44:15.160 --> 44:17.980
database in an access database.

44:17.980 --> 44:25.120
So she just types it all in there and keeps it updated by hand.

44:25.120 --> 44:27.840
Samuel Blair also boosted in with 500 sats.

44:27.840 --> 44:29.340
I know about Microsoft Access.

44:29.340 --> 44:31.400
I wasn't born yesterday.

44:31.400 --> 44:34.200
And then the Golden Dragon came in with a row of ducks.

44:34.200 --> 44:35.200
That's 2222 sats.

44:35.200 --> 44:38.040
He said, Did I hear access?

44:38.040 --> 44:40.640
I tried learning that eons ago.

44:40.640 --> 44:45.040
My mother in law is an access ninja, where she works.

44:45.040 --> 44:47.120
It's a huge part of what they do.

44:47.120 --> 44:48.120
Even today.

44:48.120 --> 44:49.620
Thanks for the shows.

44:49.620 --> 44:52.960
That's the general theme is we were right.

44:52.960 --> 44:54.400
Access is still in use.

44:54.400 --> 44:58.040
I feel like there was a hard age line on the feedback we got on access, though.

44:58.040 --> 45:00.040
I was gonna say that, too.

45:00.040 --> 45:01.040
Yeah.

45:01.040 --> 45:06.800
And did you notice the boosters seem to know what access is, but the emailers didn't, which

45:06.800 --> 45:07.800
who knows what that's about.

45:07.800 --> 45:08.800
But I just thought that was interesting.

45:08.800 --> 45:09.800
Yeah.

45:09.800 --> 45:10.800
I mean, boost is so new.

45:10.800 --> 45:13.480
I don't know if that's Yeah, it's hard to say.

45:13.480 --> 45:14.480
It's hard to say.

45:14.480 --> 45:15.480
We got another one by Dave.

45:15.480 --> 45:19.680
He says, You guys are dead on does look like the overall macro market is about to hurt

45:19.680 --> 45:21.080
a lot of folks.

45:21.080 --> 45:25.920
That's why I need a Bitcoin dad robe to properly ride this ship down.

45:25.920 --> 45:30.960
You know, I mentioned the Bitcoin dad pod, but you know what, that like the Friday or

45:30.960 --> 45:37.200
something before the recent downturn in the market, we totally called the Luna crash and

45:37.200 --> 45:41.520
why it was going to go down, why why Tara would deep egg and why the rest of the market

45:41.520 --> 45:42.520
would tumble.

45:42.520 --> 45:43.520
Just saying.

45:43.520 --> 45:44.520
Just saying.

45:44.520 --> 45:45.520
Totally nailed it.

45:45.520 --> 45:46.520
Is that a new J.B. show?

45:46.520 --> 45:48.200
No, it is a show a friend of mine is doing.

45:48.200 --> 45:51.200
And I am happily just taking on the co-host role for once.

45:51.200 --> 45:52.200
Cool.

45:52.200 --> 45:53.200
Yeah.

45:53.200 --> 45:55.760
So I just get to sit back and, you know, pontificate.

45:55.760 --> 46:03.520
It's actually it's really I can tell you, I like to pontificate even by myself.

46:03.520 --> 46:08.480
And slurks a lot writes in, as always, with elite boost 1337 sats.

46:08.480 --> 46:09.480
Nice.

46:09.480 --> 46:14.000
I'm a Linux Foss enthusiast and an I.T. veteran, but I don't consider myself a coder.

46:14.000 --> 46:17.560
I do listen to all the J.B. shows and I'm a supporter on Patron, but I love being able

46:17.560 --> 46:18.660
to boost.

46:18.660 --> 46:19.660
So here you go.

46:19.660 --> 46:22.560
Pew, pew, pew, pew.

46:22.560 --> 46:27.120
Now the user boosted in asking us if we have any thoughts on I think it's.

46:27.120 --> 46:29.400
Sorry, sorry.

46:29.400 --> 46:33.400
Somebody else emailed me and I'm pretty suspicious that you're the same dude.

46:33.400 --> 46:34.400
Not yet.

46:34.400 --> 46:35.920
I haven't gotten to get my hands around it.

46:35.920 --> 46:41.020
It's basically a alternative to electron, but very similar high level idea.

46:41.020 --> 46:42.680
And you're missing one important part.

46:42.680 --> 46:44.200
Oh, I didn't miss it.

46:44.200 --> 46:45.200
I ignored it.

46:45.200 --> 46:47.680
But go ahead.

46:47.680 --> 46:48.680
It's got rust.

46:48.680 --> 46:49.680
Yeah.

46:49.680 --> 46:53.720
So the idea is you kind of use whatever you want on the front end, but the core is built

46:53.720 --> 46:54.720
with rust.

46:54.720 --> 46:56.720
Oh, that's not what I thought you were going to say.

46:56.720 --> 46:57.720
Oh, node?

46:57.720 --> 46:58.720
Nope.

46:58.720 --> 46:59.720
You missed it.

46:59.720 --> 47:00.720
What?

47:00.720 --> 47:01.720
He has a special request.

47:01.720 --> 47:02.720
A shout out to Egon.

47:02.720 --> 47:09.920
Egon gets the shout out.

47:09.920 --> 47:11.440
That's so great.

47:11.440 --> 47:14.520
We also got some thank you bows from Cospeland from Freak.

47:14.520 --> 47:16.440
He was just streaming Dim Sats as he listened.

47:16.440 --> 47:18.940
And we got a bonus thank you boost from Dave Jones.

47:18.940 --> 47:20.480
And Dave, I'm glad you're back listening again.

47:20.480 --> 47:24.800
I hope that means everybody is doing well at home now and you're getting caught up on

47:24.800 --> 47:25.800
your podcast.

47:25.800 --> 47:29.760
Shout out to Dave because he was our triple booster this week.

47:29.760 --> 47:31.800
And we we appreciate that, Dave.

47:31.800 --> 47:33.520
Glad you're glad to have you back.

47:33.520 --> 47:35.080
Can I say something?

47:35.080 --> 47:36.080
Yeah.

47:36.080 --> 47:39.700
So coding challenges are coming back in a weird form.

47:39.700 --> 47:40.700
I love it.

47:40.700 --> 47:42.760
I bought a book, bought my own money.

47:42.760 --> 47:47.000
There's no like weird corrupt crap going on here called the Python workout.

47:47.000 --> 47:48.000
I'll find a link.

47:48.000 --> 47:50.360
It's from Manning Press.

47:50.360 --> 47:56.800
And it's 50 Python assignments starting from easy to pay me.

47:56.800 --> 48:02.120
So if you want to follow along, I'm going to put up a GitHub thingamajig.

48:02.120 --> 48:04.560
And I'm hoping to have the first one for next week.

48:04.560 --> 48:05.560
You say Python workout?

48:05.560 --> 48:06.560
I think I got a link to that.

48:06.560 --> 48:07.560
I'll put it in the show notes.

48:07.560 --> 48:08.560
OK.

48:08.560 --> 48:09.560
Yeah.

48:09.560 --> 48:10.920
It's got like a dude with like no shirt on, on the cover.

48:10.920 --> 48:11.920
Right.

48:11.920 --> 48:12.920
That's not you?

48:12.920 --> 48:13.920
I wish.

48:13.920 --> 48:14.920
It's got weird.

48:14.920 --> 48:15.920
All right.

48:15.920 --> 48:16.920
Yeah.

48:16.920 --> 48:17.920
Link is now officially in the show notes.

48:17.920 --> 48:20.800
And I'll also drop it in the chat room if you're watching live because, you know, we do

48:20.800 --> 48:23.640
this here show on the Mondays at noon Pacific, 3 p.m.

48:23.640 --> 48:24.640
Eastern.

48:24.640 --> 48:25.640
And you can hang out in our chat room.

48:25.640 --> 48:27.840
Yeah, that handsomely tattooed man is me.

48:27.840 --> 48:28.840
Yes.

48:28.840 --> 48:29.840
Nicely done, sir.

48:29.840 --> 48:30.840
Oh, my goodness.

48:30.840 --> 48:33.280
I like how he has tattoos that enhance his muscles.

48:33.280 --> 48:36.840
I like the craftily placed robes, shall we say.

48:36.840 --> 48:37.840
Yeah.

48:37.840 --> 48:41.520
Boy, if that thing was off by even an inch, it'd be a totally different book.

48:41.520 --> 48:42.520
Let's just say.

48:42.520 --> 48:45.960
It would probably sell better, too, let's be honest.

48:45.960 --> 48:47.320
All right.

48:47.320 --> 48:49.360
Thank you to our members at CoderQA.co.

48:49.360 --> 48:51.060
You're going to get a Coderly soon.

48:51.060 --> 48:52.060
You join that.

48:52.060 --> 48:56.520
You get access to the show with no ads and you get the Coderly report.

48:56.520 --> 48:59.640
And it's a way to say, you know, thank you.

48:59.640 --> 49:01.780
And it's a way for us to say thank you, too, by giving you a few perks.

49:01.780 --> 49:05.200
It's a nice little setup and you can support the entire network and get access to all of

49:05.200 --> 49:08.260
the shows and all of their perks by going to Jupiter.party.

49:08.260 --> 49:12.800
So for this year's show, CoderQA.co and for the whole network, Jupiter.party.

49:12.800 --> 49:17.080
And of course, if you want to do a one off, you can just send us a boost with a message,

49:17.080 --> 49:18.800
which we always appreciate.

49:18.800 --> 49:21.960
Mr. Dominic, is there anywhere you want to send the people before we wrap it up for more

49:21.960 --> 49:22.960
organ?

49:22.960 --> 49:29.000
If you go to tmb.inc, that's.inc slash careers, we are hiring.

49:29.000 --> 49:30.120
Very good.

49:30.120 --> 49:31.120
Very good.

49:31.120 --> 49:35.320
We should put a link to that in the show notes, too, just to make it easy for the peoples.

49:35.320 --> 49:36.960
Let's see if you want to get a hold of me.

49:36.960 --> 49:37.960
You can do it on Matrix.

49:37.960 --> 49:41.320
We do have a Coder Radio feedback channel over there and a general chat.

49:41.320 --> 49:44.160
Shout out to the Matrix folks listening live right now.

49:44.160 --> 49:49.480
And of course, I'm on Twitter at Chris Ellis and the whole podcast is at Coder Radio Show.

49:49.480 --> 49:53.000
And the network to get network announcements is at Jupiter Signal.

49:53.000 --> 49:56.560
And you know, I will give you a little hot tip before we wrap up.

49:56.560 --> 50:00.360
Even if you don't want to use the Twitter, but you still want to see what people are

50:00.360 --> 50:03.640
posting about and kind of use it as a news feed.

50:03.640 --> 50:08.540
Check out knitter and n-i-t-t-e-r dot net.

50:08.540 --> 50:13.720
It's a way you can just plug in a username like, you know, at Coder Radio Show and you

50:13.720 --> 50:19.200
can get a nice clean feed of everything that account is going on about without having to

50:19.200 --> 50:21.120
go to the dumpster fire that is actually Twitter.

50:21.120 --> 50:23.200
Well, that's a stalker's paradise right there.

50:23.200 --> 50:26.680
It is, but it's also just a nice way to, I see you go into it right now.

50:26.680 --> 50:28.680
Yeah, I'm like, whoo-hoo!

50:28.680 --> 50:30.600
That's so funny.

50:30.600 --> 50:33.440
Knitter is just a nice way to consume content that people post there because you just can't

50:33.440 --> 50:34.440
get away from it.

50:34.440 --> 50:36.320
You know, people put stuff on Twitter and...

50:36.320 --> 50:38.760
I don't know why Tay-Tay Taylor Swift blocked me.

50:38.760 --> 50:39.760
That's all I'm saying.

50:39.760 --> 50:40.760
No, who could guess?

50:40.760 --> 50:43.440
Nobody could probably even take a guess as to why.

50:43.440 --> 50:45.680
So I'll put a link to knitter in the show notes too.

50:45.680 --> 50:49.840
Again, those are at coder.show slash 466.

50:49.840 --> 50:53.800
They're always just the episode number and you know, you can grab a link to that.

50:53.800 --> 50:56.280
That way you don't have to do the Twitter thing if you don't want to.

50:56.280 --> 50:57.280
Huzzah.

50:57.280 --> 50:58.280
Exactly.

50:58.280 --> 50:59.280
Huzzah.

50:59.280 --> 51:00.280
Last but not least, I will mention we are live again.

51:00.280 --> 51:02.360
Come join us over at jblive.tv on a Monday.

51:02.360 --> 51:07.120
It gets converted to your time zone at jupiterbroadcasting.com slash calendar.

51:07.120 --> 51:10.840
Feedback, your opinions, your thoughts, your ideas, huge part of the show.

51:10.840 --> 51:14.840
Go to coder.show slash contact to send that information in to give us your thoughts, your

51:14.840 --> 51:15.840
ideas, your topics.

51:15.840 --> 51:21.120
And of course, you can always send us a boost with the new podcast app at newpodcastapps.com.

51:21.120 --> 51:24.440
Thanks so much for tuning this week's episode of the Coder Radio program and we'll see you

51:24.440 --> 51:45.480
right back here next week.
