00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
This is Koto Radio, episode 406 for March 22nd, 2021.

00:15.000 --> 00:18.000
Hey there, good looking and welcome into Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show.

00:18.000 --> 00:24.000
Taking a pragmatic look at the RTM business of software development and the world of technology.

00:24.000 --> 00:26.000
This episode is brought to you by a cloud guru.

00:26.000 --> 00:31.000
A cloud guru now includes Cloud Playground, Azure AWS, or Google Soundboxes.

00:31.000 --> 00:34.000
All on ACG's credit card, not on yours.

00:34.000 --> 00:38.000
Get certified, get hired, get learning at acloudguru.com.

00:38.000 --> 00:40.000
Who me? Well, my name is Chris.

00:40.000 --> 00:51.000
But what's really important is that host of ours who's in the podcasting position as we start to give us yet another week of fine Koto Radio entertainment.

00:51.000 --> 00:52.000
Hello, Mike.

00:52.000 --> 00:55.000
Chris, audio has changed.

00:55.000 --> 00:58.000
We had core audio, we had audio kit.

00:58.000 --> 01:03.000
But now, proxy kernels fighting kernel extensions for your microphone.

01:03.000 --> 01:06.000
On macOS Big Sur, audio has changed.

01:06.000 --> 01:10.000
And I'm coming from the trenches of pipeline.

01:10.000 --> 01:14.000
Let us not forget about the horrible routing that is PulseAudio.

01:14.000 --> 01:16.000
Sorry again, guys, and I'm not sorry at all.

01:16.000 --> 01:19.000
Does it help that they're working on it? Does that make you feel better at all?

01:19.000 --> 01:21.000
They're like real close now.

01:21.000 --> 01:25.000
The next version of Fedora is not using actual PulseAudio anymore.

01:25.000 --> 01:29.000
It must be a union job. That's all I'll say about it.

01:29.000 --> 01:31.000
So you sold your ThinkPad keyboard.

01:31.000 --> 01:35.000
You are all proud of this ThinkPad keyboard that you got.

01:35.000 --> 01:36.000
Because you're on the show.

01:36.000 --> 01:39.000
Remember, you're like, well, it's like a ThinkPad, but it's just the keyboard.

01:39.000 --> 01:40.000
And it's fantastic.

01:40.000 --> 01:43.000
Poppy, you said thank you to Poppy.

01:43.000 --> 01:44.000
No, no, I didn't sell it.

01:44.000 --> 01:46.000
Somebody bought another one who listened to the show.

01:46.000 --> 01:49.000
Oh, you're selling them. You're selling them now.

01:49.000 --> 01:50.000
I see.

01:50.000 --> 01:52.000
No, no, I didn't sell the one I have.

01:52.000 --> 01:53.000
No, somebody bought it.

01:53.000 --> 01:57.000
Man, I thought like maybe I had my chance to get back at you for the HomePod stuff.

01:57.000 --> 01:59.000
I mean, I'm still running out of them.

01:59.000 --> 02:02.000
And I did buy two HomePods.

02:02.000 --> 02:05.000
What I'm curious, though, is how's that Doge tripping going?

02:05.000 --> 02:07.000
Are you still playing the Doge game?

02:07.000 --> 02:10.000
Let's take a live Robin Hood check, shall we?

02:10.000 --> 02:11.000
Oh, boy. Oh, boy.

02:11.000 --> 02:14.000
You know, I was going to give you a real hard time.

02:14.000 --> 02:17.000
But then I saw this article by the Wall Street Journal.

02:17.000 --> 02:26.000
And it says that now Doge, which was created for laughs, is now worth more than Western Union, Under Armour or Xerox.

02:26.000 --> 02:29.000
Doge is worth more than Xerox.

02:29.000 --> 02:36.000
I am down $14.87, which people who know what Dogecoin goes for knows how much money I invested in Dogecoin.

02:36.000 --> 02:40.000
And, you know, I was doing really well on Robin Hood.

02:40.000 --> 02:43.000
But like every gambler, I did not know when to walk away.

02:43.000 --> 02:49.000
So did they pull you in with the Wall Street bets stuff and then you stuck around for just having a good time?

02:49.000 --> 02:53.000
You know how sometimes I say really mean things on here and we get bad feedback?

02:53.000 --> 02:54.000
Yeah.

02:54.000 --> 02:58.000
OK, I find it offensive when stupid people make money.

02:58.000 --> 02:59.000
I got you. Sure.

02:59.000 --> 03:04.000
It's like here I am. I'm working. I'm thinking all the time. I'm always making these plans.

03:04.000 --> 03:08.000
So, yes. Now the Dogecoin, I'm like, it's so cheap.

03:08.000 --> 03:11.000
And one of the things that burns me is that I missed Bitcoin.

03:11.000 --> 03:13.000
I could have bought Bitcoin. I knew about Bitcoin.

03:13.000 --> 03:15.000
But I was like, the government will shut you down.

03:15.000 --> 03:17.000
The penguin, cobra commander.

03:17.000 --> 03:19.000
Your buddy Chris was like, let's talk about Bitcoin.

03:19.000 --> 03:22.000
And I was like, fuck you. Makes no sense.

03:22.000 --> 03:25.000
But no, no. In fact, you and I would both be millionaires at this point.

03:25.000 --> 03:28.000
So I don't want to talk about it.

03:28.000 --> 03:37.000
I mean, you know, my my my my history with Bitcoin is tragic because I had about half of them stolen in a breach at one point.

03:37.000 --> 03:38.000
Oh, my God.

03:38.000 --> 03:45.000
And then at various times, although I don't actually regret this because I think when it comes to investing, there's you can't predict the future.

03:45.000 --> 03:48.000
I'm sorry. No, you straight up jar jar that up.

03:48.000 --> 03:59.000
Yeah, that that that whole that's that stunk getting because that was just so many bitcoins at the time, though, they were only worth like, I don't know, maybe 20 bucks, 25 bucks.

03:59.000 --> 04:07.000
So, like, I didn't really get super upset. But now looking back at it, you know, it was it was probably 60 bitcoins or something like that.

04:07.000 --> 04:10.000
That's roughly thirty three hundred fifty thousand dollars.

04:10.000 --> 04:13.000
It'd be wild. It'd be wild now. Right. Because as we record, the price is fifty four thousand.

04:13.000 --> 04:16.000
It fluctuates like crazy. Oh, it's higher.

04:16.000 --> 04:19.000
But I spent a lot of my Bitcoin on the studio.

04:19.000 --> 04:23.000
You know, that's where a lot of these components came from. And I feel like that was a good use of it, too.

04:23.000 --> 04:29.000
But yeah, you look back at it. It's wild. And you do think this there seems to be some kind of market here.

04:29.000 --> 04:36.000
I don't know if it's people that are just playing for fun or what, but people like these digital tokens that they can buy and sell.

04:36.000 --> 04:40.000
Not everybody does. But it seems like a lot of people do. I don't know what it means.

04:40.000 --> 04:44.000
Maybe it's that dystopian future that we've been worried about. And it's here now. Maybe it's that.

04:44.000 --> 04:49.000
I have a concept coin I'd like to pitch. Oh, yeah. I call it Jcoin.

04:49.000 --> 04:58.000
And every time somebody writes something in VB6 or PHP or just some really awful, stupid bug, I will release more Jcoin.

04:58.000 --> 05:06.000
Now, the J could stand for John, Jared, Jeanette, Janelle, Jocelyn, Jar Jar.

05:06.000 --> 05:10.000
I think it's a coin with a philosophy. Yeah. OK.

05:10.000 --> 05:18.000
Every time someone's password on their enterprise ID system is password one, two, three, well, one hundred and twenty three thousand Jcoins will be released.

05:18.000 --> 05:20.000
Wow. That is a jackass.

05:20.000 --> 05:26.000
I think what you should do is the individual coin should be called Binks, you know, like how many Binks is something?

05:26.000 --> 05:34.000
Yeah. You know, I would do it just to be able to every week say, and this is our Binks check in.

05:34.000 --> 05:40.000
Oh, man, I hope that never happens. I think what we should do instead is focus on podcasting.

05:40.000 --> 05:47.000
Come on, though. If they were like point zero five cents, you throw 50 bucks at the Binks.

05:47.000 --> 05:49.000
You know, I might I might get a few Binks. Yeah.

05:49.000 --> 05:52.000
Especially if I could if I could trade them with other J.B. listeners, you know.

05:52.000 --> 05:58.000
And what if you could exclusively buy home pods with them? Black market home pods.

05:58.000 --> 06:05.000
And so the value of the Jcoin is set on how many Binks it takes to purchase a home pod.

06:05.000 --> 06:09.000
Right. And as the home pods become rarer, obviously the Jcoin goes up.

06:09.000 --> 06:14.000
Right. You know, it's incredible about the Jcoin. And this is a story Bitcoin cannot claim.

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
Very environmentally friendly. Yes.

06:16.000 --> 06:24.000
Because you're repurposing home pods so they don't go in the landfill. No GPU required because you're releasing it based on a random factor of bugs that get introduced into the wild.

06:24.000 --> 06:30.000
So, I mean, this seems not only environmentally friendly, but like it could give people a good listening experience.

06:30.000 --> 06:36.000
Ultimately, I would also suggest it is not a fiat currency in a traditional sense because it's backed by a hard asset.

06:36.000 --> 06:41.000
And that is the number of home pods that currently exist in the world, which Bitcoin can't claim either.

06:41.000 --> 06:46.000
Just saying. It's not backed by a hard asset, right? It's backed by the value people say it's worth.

06:46.000 --> 06:52.000
But the Jcoin would be backed by the value of a home pod, which is getting more valuable all the time, as you say.

06:52.000 --> 06:56.000
So that suggests we would need some sort of vault of home pods like Fort Knox.

06:56.000 --> 07:04.000
You know, you and I could seed it with an initial fund like, you know, the Rockefellers. We could be like the initial bank.

07:04.000 --> 07:08.000
I can't even say this, but I bought two home pods. I'm considering buying two more.

07:08.000 --> 07:15.000
Wow. They're so good. The thing is, is my wife is no good in this because she also loves them.

07:15.000 --> 07:23.000
She listens to music all the time. She always has music going. She's kind of like, maybe we should buy one more just in case.

07:23.000 --> 07:28.000
But I don't know. I'm hopeful. I'm hopeful it goes somewhere.

07:28.000 --> 07:37.000
I've been listening to BBC radio plays and there's something about listening to whoever the hell plays George Smiley in the old BBC John le Carr novels.

07:37.000 --> 07:43.000
It's Patrick Stewart or radio plays. It is not Patrick Stewart. Patrick Stewart actually plays his enemy in the old movie.

07:43.000 --> 07:48.000
He plays the Russian guy. Really? Yeah. So you got that right, even though you made it up weird.

07:48.000 --> 07:51.000
It's just the only British actor I could think of quickly.

07:51.000 --> 07:55.000
And also it messes with my kid because now I have him all the time.

07:55.000 --> 08:00.000
So he thinks when he hears a voice that is not like music behind it, that I'm on the phone.

08:00.000 --> 08:06.000
I don't know how to say this nicely. When daddy's on the phone, silence is gold.

08:06.000 --> 08:14.000
Yeah. Not time to be loud. Right. So sometimes daddy plays BBC Shakespeare productions and John le Carr.

08:14.000 --> 08:19.000
Interesting technique. I should try that. I say watch that space.

08:19.000 --> 08:24.000
We have something more to get to in the show for that for that space. But I have a prediction to make shortly.

08:24.000 --> 08:29.000
I see two Lisp things in the document. I got to say, Wes, get a hobby.

08:29.000 --> 08:34.000
I love the idea that Wes sent in Lisp emails. All right. So we should do the feedback.

08:34.000 --> 08:38.000
Our first one came in from Jim. And it's a question on imposter syndrome.

08:38.000 --> 08:43.000
So they recently got promoted outside my scope into a more architect engineer position.

08:43.000 --> 08:48.000
How do you deal with the stress or the imposter syndrome that seems to come along with this?

08:48.000 --> 08:52.000
I feel that there were episodes of code or maybe it was somewhere else on the network that touched on this.

08:52.000 --> 08:59.000
But I cannot recall what your comments were. Love the show. Would be glad if you touch on this. Thanks, Jim.

08:59.000 --> 09:03.000
So this is tricky, right? Jim gets promoted to doing something he's never done before.

09:03.000 --> 09:11.000
Right. But every manager at some point was doing the work and hopefully it happened that way, got promoted to being a manager at some point.

09:11.000 --> 09:15.000
Like that's how it that's how it naturally goes. So he's in a very natural position here.

09:15.000 --> 09:20.000
But he's getting that that imposter syndrome that sneaks in.

09:20.000 --> 09:26.000
I don't really have a lot to speak to that, but I'm wondering if you have any tricks or techniques or any experience with that.

09:26.000 --> 09:29.000
Yeah, I mean, I think it's two different issues. Right. But I'll start with the imposter syndrome.

09:29.000 --> 09:38.000
I mean, as someone who's self-taught and does not have a CS degree, for people who haven't listened a long time, I did reason in medieval literature, which is insane.

09:38.000 --> 09:42.000
Imposter syndrome is a big, big problem when you're starting out.

09:42.000 --> 09:50.000
And then at least my experience was once you're like five, six, ten plus years in, you don't care anymore.

09:50.000 --> 09:53.000
Stress. I mean, it depends on the kind of stress.

09:53.000 --> 09:59.000
Like for me, the stressful stuff is working on mission critical systems that could have an outage. Right.

09:59.000 --> 10:03.000
Deployments are hyper stressful for me. And I know that's very old school.

10:03.000 --> 10:06.000
And somebody will write in with something snarky about continuous deployment.

10:06.000 --> 10:13.000
And I will say, yeah, that's nice in an idealistic world, but it's not real, at least not at the scale that I'm operating at.

10:13.000 --> 10:17.000
Listen to you preemptively like deflecting emails.

10:17.000 --> 10:21.000
I'm just going to say how many years of email have I been getting now?

10:21.000 --> 10:25.000
But you you're like Wonder Woman with the like the things on the arms.

10:25.000 --> 10:29.000
You like deflecting. Let me tell you something. If I looked like the new Wonder Woman, never mind.

10:29.000 --> 10:34.000
We should move on. This would be a YouTube show for first of all.

10:34.000 --> 10:40.000
This would be a video production, my friend. I somehow feel like we'd sell a lot more robes.

10:40.000 --> 10:45.000
Definitely. Definitely. Yeah. Yeah. So what do you think, though, for Jim here?

10:45.000 --> 10:47.000
Yeah, I think, Jim, it depends on the type of stress.

10:47.000 --> 10:54.000
I mean, you know, at some point you can't care more than the end users.

10:54.000 --> 11:02.000
So if that's what's getting to you, like if you have a deployment and you're just not getting the information or the assets or whatever it is that you need, then oh, well.

11:02.000 --> 11:07.000
Right. Like that's on them. You might have to have a bad conversation. That's life.

11:07.000 --> 11:11.000
Yeah. But general stress. You know what? Changing technologies is tough.

11:11.000 --> 11:21.000
You said changing from a manager to someone who used to do it. That is stressful, right? Becoming the manager is it's a different type of, I guess, like mental orientation that you have to have.

11:21.000 --> 11:26.000
One of my big struggles is actually not wanting to just dive in and be like, no, I'll just do it.

11:26.000 --> 11:31.000
But it's it's just a discipline thing. I mean, the way I do it is I break down.

11:31.000 --> 11:36.000
I have certain times in the day where I do coding. I have certain times in the day where I do like business development.

11:36.000 --> 11:42.000
I have certain times in the day where I do like general customer, whatever, product management stuff.

11:42.000 --> 11:48.000
Yeah, that's a good way to do it. I do it more by the days myself. These days are for that kind of stuff. Other days are for show production.

11:48.000 --> 11:53.000
Okay. Yeah, that could work, too. Right. I don't think there's like a like a silver bullet solution.

11:53.000 --> 11:59.000
It's whatever makes you feel better and that you're not like basket casing yourself to sleep.

11:59.000 --> 12:12.000
Jim, do what soothes you. If you're feeling like you have imposter syndrome, it might really translate to feel like maybe there's an area where you have a deficiency of knowledge and that insecurity of that deficiency is what's causing that imposter syndrome.

12:12.000 --> 12:20.000
So embrace it and dive in and figure out whatever area that is and just live it, breathe it, research it.

12:20.000 --> 12:24.000
And I think that probably will also help. So that's one thing.

12:24.000 --> 12:31.000
We have one that I want to break down and kind of take in pieces because I have been where listener Matt is and man, is it a tough spot.

12:31.000 --> 12:38.000
So he says, Good day, Mike and Chris. He is from Australia. I have a problem. I'm hoping to run past both of you.

12:38.000 --> 12:45.000
I don't want to turn this into a humble brag, but what I do has given me good job security and we're doing okay financially.

12:45.000 --> 12:51.000
I work with a Microsoft product in software support and consulting. It's SharePoint. I can feel it. Sorry.

12:51.000 --> 12:58.000
You are probably right. He says I'm at a point in my career where I'm finding it hard to stay motivated because my heart is no longer in it.

12:58.000 --> 13:06.000
I have so been here where I was stuck in doing IT consulting and this was at the heyday of XP.

13:06.000 --> 13:15.000
I couldn't get out of this like mental cage I had built for myself about just being in agony about having to constantly fix busted XP machines.

13:15.000 --> 13:21.000
I had some really heavy hitting lawyer clients that were really deadline driven.

13:21.000 --> 13:29.000
And when there was an IT failure that caused them to delay, they did not handle it in a way that would be considered appropriate today.

13:29.000 --> 13:37.000
Like this wasn't even that long ago. And the stuff these guys got away with is like the stuff you see in movies. It was ridiculous.

13:37.000 --> 13:40.000
Is this like Wall Street or more Wolf of Wall Street?

13:40.000 --> 13:47.000
It's like, you know, throwing drinks at people, calling people, you know, derogatory terms and yelling everyone in the office.

13:47.000 --> 13:51.000
And I remember this one time, this is one that really this was the straw that broke the camel's back.

13:51.000 --> 13:56.000
It was it was some just just south of 10 million dollar deal that they were trying to wrap up.

13:56.000 --> 14:00.000
And the guy's machine was just completely falling apart. He got so much email.

14:00.000 --> 14:05.000
I had never seen a human being that could do this much email. This this lawyer, he was their highest end lawyer in the whole place.

14:05.000 --> 14:14.000
And his outlook busted on him, which it did all the time back in the day because Outlook had these really small limits on like the PSD file sizes, which he would constantly exceed.

14:14.000 --> 14:20.000
God, they were so cheap. They were paying for some busted ass early hosting exchange system that was just total garbage.

14:20.000 --> 14:32.000
And I got in there and discovered that it was essentially just junk that he'd gotten on his machine that had fouled up all Internet Explorer integration because he had been browsing porn in the evening.

14:32.000 --> 14:43.000
And I think if I if I had to clean up and as you know, this guy's screaming at me and this this like nine million dollar deal is on the line and something snapped in me.

14:43.000 --> 14:47.000
And I just couldn't from that point on. I hated working on XP machines.

14:47.000 --> 14:53.000
And I eventually had to fire all of my clients that I couldn't get out of that work just because it was driving me nuts.

14:53.000 --> 14:59.000
I was like in this mental cage. I just tortured myself with it. And I just didn't find it interesting anymore.

14:59.000 --> 15:04.000
I didn't I didn't want to do any of that work anymore. And my passion at the time was in podcasting.

15:04.000 --> 15:09.000
But like our our emailer here, Matt, his passion is in software development.

15:09.000 --> 15:16.000
He says my career has just organically transitioned through the stages where I'm in a relatively senior position now.

15:16.000 --> 15:22.000
I have a young family and I can't just change jobs. I wouldn't be able to afford a pay cut just because he doesn't enjoy what he's doing.

15:22.000 --> 15:30.000
He can't just, you know, stop providing for his family. But it's gotten to the point for him where it's, as he puts it, soul crushing.

15:30.000 --> 15:38.000
My family is counting on me, not just for financial support, but I also still need to be a good husband and a father and be there for them emotionally.

15:38.000 --> 15:49.000
And I I really know what he means, because like when when your job totally emotionally drains you and then like you go home and your family wants you to be on.

15:49.000 --> 15:52.000
They they want to tell you about their day and they want you to react to it.

15:52.000 --> 16:01.000
And in a positive way, the sort of emotional tone of the parents totally sets the emotional tone for the rest of the family.

16:01.000 --> 16:04.000
And, you know, so if you're grumpy, it kind of makes everybody else grumpy.

16:04.000 --> 16:08.000
And so as a dad, you don't want to do you don't want to be responsible for that.

16:08.000 --> 16:13.000
And so then you start guilt tripping yourself for that. It's just like just compounded.

16:13.000 --> 16:16.000
And so I really I really get where Matt's at here.

16:16.000 --> 16:23.000
He says that I've always been somewhat of a jack of all trades, a master of none type person, which has worked perfectly throughout my career.

16:23.000 --> 16:28.000
But because I've done so many different things, I can't just step into a higher paying development role.

16:28.000 --> 16:31.000
I've never really specialized in one area of software development.

16:31.000 --> 16:36.000
I have no qualifications. And really, I relied on prior job experience to get where I am today.

16:36.000 --> 16:40.000
So what should I do, guys? The weight of all of this is really starting to get me down.

16:40.000 --> 16:46.000
And I fear the quality of my work is starting to suffer as well as being there for my family short of winning the lottery.

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
It feels like I'll be stuck forever.

16:48.000 --> 16:54.000
TLDR is I don't want to do my job anymore, but I kind of paid too much to take a big risk to quit.

16:54.000 --> 16:57.000
But I want to do software development. That's what I'm really passionate about.

16:57.000 --> 16:59.000
Regards from down under Matt.

16:59.000 --> 17:03.000
I, I, I, that's just like a lot.

17:03.000 --> 17:05.000
Should we break it down a little bit here?

17:05.000 --> 17:11.000
He thinks one of his main issues about about career shifting is that he's been a jack of all trades, master of none.

17:11.000 --> 17:15.000
So he doesn't have something to really highlight to move into a new area.

17:15.000 --> 17:22.000
Right. See, what I found interesting about that is that seems that's a pretty common thing that we've seen emailed into the show.

17:22.000 --> 17:30.000
However, listener Joseph wrote in and he said, I'd been looking around for places to work for about two years, even before the pandemic hit.

17:30.000 --> 17:34.000
I've talked to headhunters. I've taken temp jobs. It's all kind of been crap.

17:34.000 --> 17:38.000
And he says, one of the most frustrating things was interviews that wanted very specific skills.

17:38.000 --> 17:47.000
We need you to be an expert in Java or you have to know specific X library or X framework and you have to have used them for X amount of time.

17:47.000 --> 17:54.000
He said, I usually try to remind folks that I had years of experience with using different languages and shifting to different frameworks all the time.

17:54.000 --> 18:04.000
To me, it seems like knowing how to solve problems across different domains is more important than just knowing one specific framework and how it works.

18:04.000 --> 18:09.000
And I think Joseph makes a really good point here that Matt could internalize. You can flip around some of these things.

18:09.000 --> 18:14.000
Your generalists approach means that you are really good at changing and adapting and learning new things.

18:14.000 --> 18:22.000
That is a positive. He said, I had multiple interviews going back to Joseph here, some over the phone, some in person, some on video.

18:22.000 --> 18:32.000
And I was starting to think that I was a generalist and I was going to be stuck, that I would either need to take some entry level position or work really hard on developing a specific skill.

18:32.000 --> 18:42.000
So here's what I decided to do. If I was going to try to make a concentrated effort at some specific skill, then I was going to make damn sure it was something I was really interested in.

18:42.000 --> 18:50.000
I started researching AI and machine learning. I started reading more about it and I started building a good resume.

18:50.000 --> 18:58.000
He said, also, I noticed that a lot of employers were checking GitHub to see if I had any existing code to check that before they interviewed me.

18:58.000 --> 19:11.000
And he wonders what we thought about that. If you do want to specialize, you need to figure out, going back to Matt's original question, he's got to figure out out of everything he's worked with, what does he really love?

19:11.000 --> 19:15.000
Because it's got to be something he has a passion for, so he has the energy to really devour it.

19:15.000 --> 19:22.000
And he could look at the fact that he's got a good, safe job as an opportunity for a runway. Make himself a one year plan.

19:22.000 --> 19:36.000
Yeah, I would almost, oh my God, I'm going to be conservative. This hurts. I would almost say, are you sure that you need to, I mean, if you're making good money, stable, whatever, do you really want to go into something new?

19:36.000 --> 19:43.000
Or is it that you need to find a way to just like make this job a job and have interest outside?

19:43.000 --> 19:48.000
So I think it's really good that you said that, because my original take was, it sounds like he needs a hobby.

19:48.000 --> 19:57.000
Right, right, because now is not an awesome time. Like, there is no, I mean, maybe this is me over-identifying too much, but there is no iPhone launch right now, right?

19:57.000 --> 20:02.000
There is no new platform that you can just like jump into, take your existing experience.

20:02.000 --> 20:03.000
Ride that wave.

20:03.000 --> 20:12.000
And make stupid consulting fees, right? In fact, things are, I know a lot of people are going to write in and say, no, my startup's amazing, but things are relatively stagnant right now.

20:12.000 --> 20:17.000
And what I did was I just kept working for a bit longer until I could transition to something else.

20:17.000 --> 20:26.000
And I created myself essentially a two-year plan, if I recall, and took what was good, stable employment as, and I made it my advantage.

20:26.000 --> 20:31.000
It wasn't my prison because I, and I kept myself the option of not doing it too.

20:31.000 --> 20:35.000
Like I thought, you know, if the consulting stuff really started working out, I just preferred it.

20:35.000 --> 20:39.000
Maybe I would just keep, you know, just kind of just use the podcasting stuff as a side hobby.

20:39.000 --> 20:40.000
Right.

20:40.000 --> 20:43.000
But I was able to make that transition about a decade ago now.

20:43.000 --> 20:47.000
But I was so in his spot ten years ago.

20:47.000 --> 20:48.000
I was so in his spot.

20:48.000 --> 20:57.000
And I think looking back at it, I'm a little disappointed that I couldn't break myself out of a mental model I had built and leverage it as more of an advantage.

20:57.000 --> 21:03.000
And I think Micah is actually telling you the most real answer is, I'm guessing you're in your 30s.

21:03.000 --> 21:07.000
And welcome to some of the shit you have to figure out in your 30s, my friend.

21:07.000 --> 21:08.000
Yeah.

21:08.000 --> 21:21.000
Not to get super meta on you, but this is where all of those fun decisions that you've been making for the last 15 years have now kind of coalesced into creating a set of constrictions.

21:21.000 --> 21:29.000
And you have to be a little more flexible now that you have a family and you have to be maybe planning a little longer term now.

21:29.000 --> 21:35.000
And sometimes I think for a lot of us, our 30s is about figuring some of that out or it's a different age.

21:35.000 --> 21:38.000
For me and Mike.

21:38.000 --> 21:43.000
It goes from you have nothing to lose and everything to gain to actually I kind of have something to lose now.

21:43.000 --> 21:44.000
Right.

21:44.000 --> 21:49.000
And also at the same time, I've kind of been doing this thing for a while when it comes to work.

21:49.000 --> 21:50.000
Right.

21:50.000 --> 21:51.000
It's kind of getting to that point, too.

21:51.000 --> 21:54.000
It's like, oh, this is starting to become a bit of a drag.

21:54.000 --> 21:58.000
And that all kind of lands around the same time sometimes for some of us.

21:58.000 --> 22:00.000
And part of it is figuring it out.

22:00.000 --> 22:06.000
And, you know, now that I'm looking back at it, I kind of think I was young.

22:06.000 --> 22:12.000
Experience has shown me that the situation wasn't as bad as I thought at the time, although I don't regret any of the actions I took.

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
So try to turn it into an advantage, I suppose.

22:14.000 --> 22:15.000
No regrets.

22:15.000 --> 22:19.000
No, I I'm I much prefer doing this.

22:19.000 --> 22:23.000
I could say I have a few, but then I'd say too few to mention.

22:23.000 --> 22:25.000
Well, I suppose it's like that. Right.

22:25.000 --> 22:26.000
You don't get now.

22:26.000 --> 22:27.000
No. Is that a movie reference?

22:27.000 --> 22:30.000
That's a song. Regrets. I've had a few.

22:30.000 --> 22:34.000
But may I say too few to mention my way.

22:34.000 --> 22:35.000
Frank Sinatra. Thank you.

22:35.000 --> 22:37.000
It's beautiful. It's beautiful.

22:37.000 --> 22:39.000
I only sing every 50 episodes.

22:39.000 --> 22:41.000
I should have known as a Frank Sinatra reference.

22:41.000 --> 22:43.000
I was just a little slow tonight, I guess.

22:43.000 --> 22:44.000
A little slow.

22:44.000 --> 22:48.000
You were drinking with Dean Martin before, so you're just a little messed up.

22:48.000 --> 22:52.000
All right. Now we got some really important email that came into the show.

22:52.000 --> 22:55.000
You know what's funny about this next batch of feedback?

22:55.000 --> 23:01.000
Sometimes what gets the most feedback is the stuff that you or I have like the most bad reaction to.

23:01.000 --> 23:05.000
Like you didn't really have a strong reaction to Lisp either way.

23:05.000 --> 23:06.000
I don't care about Lisp.

23:06.000 --> 23:10.000
I don't know why people keep doing this because you don't care and they want you to care.

23:10.000 --> 23:11.000
They want you to care.

23:11.000 --> 23:13.000
They want me to care so much.

23:13.000 --> 23:15.000
It's like a dog when it's like I can't play with the dogs.

23:15.000 --> 23:16.000
But I love you.

23:16.000 --> 23:20.000
So Cole writes and he said I heard Michael claim that he was totally without experience with Lisp.

23:20.000 --> 23:23.000
But I would like to point out this is just simply not true.

23:23.000 --> 23:33.000
During the seven week challenge, Wes wisely exposed him to the best dialect of all, the best Lisp, which is Clojure.

23:33.000 --> 23:34.000
Wes was right.

23:34.000 --> 23:42.000
Clojure is perfect as it combines the eye bleeding parents of other Lisp and the functional sadism of Haskell.

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
Functional sadism.

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
I want that on a robe.

23:46.000 --> 23:47.000
Functional sadism.

23:47.000 --> 23:50.000
That feels like that's nearly show title potential.

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
I mean, I know we have one lined up, but that's damn good right there.

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
I think we should go with functional sadism.

23:54.000 --> 23:55.000
OK, all right.

23:55.000 --> 23:58.000
And he says, but all seriousness, just come join the Lambda dark side.

23:58.000 --> 24:01.000
We have Emacs.

24:01.000 --> 24:04.000
So much about this email that's wrong.

24:04.000 --> 24:11.000
First of all, that seven week challenge is the gift that keeps on giving, much like chlamydia.

24:11.000 --> 24:18.000
I mean, I guess one day I will try Clojure again, but I won't be happy about it.

24:18.000 --> 24:22.000
No, what you do there is that's just that's just you punted to Wes, you know, get some.

24:22.000 --> 24:25.000
It's an excuse to get Wes on the show and talk about it.

24:25.000 --> 24:29.000
He was working on kind of like a side, a little side thing using Clojure just recently.

24:29.000 --> 24:34.000
So all right, Wes, my first question, why are you doing this to yourself?

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
What's wrong with you?

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
You know why? You know why?

24:38.000 --> 24:39.000
Just to troll you, of course.

24:39.000 --> 24:47.000
No, I'm sure like it's somehow better and I can't see it, although I just want to say everybody laughed at me with Objective C.

24:47.000 --> 24:49.000
Small talk. Yeah. Just saying.

24:49.000 --> 24:51.000
You know, he actually gave me a pretty good reason.

24:51.000 --> 24:53.000
He actually gave me a really good use case.

24:53.000 --> 24:54.000
What was the reason?

24:54.000 --> 24:55.000
I don't want to spoil it. I want to let him say it.

24:55.000 --> 24:58.000
All right. All right. All right. We'll get him on.

24:58.000 --> 25:01.000
So I understand this is a one two punch of Lisp.

25:01.000 --> 25:02.000
Yeah, we have one more. Are you ready?

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
So this is.

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
For Christ's sake.

25:06.000 --> 25:09.000
This one, this one, I didn't realize it, but I think I have to become a Lisp guy.

25:09.000 --> 25:15.000
I think it's mandatory because it turns out that Lisp was involved in making my childhood what it was.

25:15.000 --> 25:18.000
He says, Chris, you know, see, I like Coles. He's appealing to me.

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
He's like he's just giving up on you.

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
Chris, I know you're a trekker, he says.

25:22.000 --> 25:27.000
Did you know that the graphics from Star Trek three, the search for Spock.

25:27.000 --> 25:29.000
How can you be deaf with ears like that?

25:29.000 --> 25:33.000
Was done by ILM on Lisp machines.

25:33.000 --> 25:35.000
Yeah, but I'm pretty sure they didn't find Spock.

25:35.000 --> 25:38.000
He was butchered to death by Ferengi.

25:38.000 --> 25:42.000
I think it was I think that's I think you're thinking of Battlestar Galactica right there.

25:42.000 --> 25:45.000
They have Ferengi stone thing.

25:45.000 --> 25:46.000
Kind of.

25:46.000 --> 25:47.000
Yeah, there you go.

25:47.000 --> 25:49.000
So I'm now a Lisp guy.

25:49.000 --> 25:50.000
He got me.

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
I got to admit Star Trek three.

25:52.000 --> 25:58.000
See, it's the under it's the most underrated of the Star Trek movies because in Star Trek three, they establish a ton of canon.

25:58.000 --> 26:03.000
Earth space stock, the Klingon bird of prey, the actual Klingon language.

26:03.000 --> 26:05.000
That's all established in Star Trek three.

26:05.000 --> 26:07.000
And that's just scratching the surface.

26:07.000 --> 26:14.000
So I feel like it's that's one of it's like a bridge movie that they actually added a ton to the Star Trek universe.

26:14.000 --> 26:16.000
So I'm a I'm a Lisp guy now.

26:16.000 --> 26:19.000
And it apparently is a gateway to closure.

26:19.000 --> 26:20.000
Is that what we're saying?

26:20.000 --> 26:26.000
Well, it's a gateway to Lisp, I think, which is a gateway to closure, which is a gateway to West being right.

26:26.000 --> 26:35.000
Linode.com slash coder, go there to get a one hundred dollars, 60 day credit towards a new account.

26:35.000 --> 26:38.000
And you support the show.

26:38.000 --> 26:40.000
We run everything on Linode.

26:40.000 --> 26:44.000
It's our go to cloud hosting provider here at Jupiter Broadcasting 3.0.

26:44.000 --> 26:54.000
And one of the things one of the like one of like the joke nods between Wes and I is we're going to put that on object storage because we talk about how they have great servers all the time.

26:54.000 --> 26:59.000
They're 30 to 50 percent cheaper than what the other cloud providers are doing out there.

26:59.000 --> 27:07.000
But they also have S3 compatible object storage, which is an easy way for you to store and access data without the need for running a server in front of it.

27:07.000 --> 27:09.000
And I've used that to send samples.

27:09.000 --> 27:10.000
I did it.

27:10.000 --> 27:14.000
I sent a sample interview to somebody we had on luck recently used Linode object storage.

27:14.000 --> 27:15.000
We just put it on there.

27:15.000 --> 27:17.000
We were moving back in files and stuff.

27:17.000 --> 27:23.000
Why have it move between all the different servers when you could all just put it on object storage and all your different servers can access that object storage?

27:23.000 --> 27:26.000
You can host a static Web site on there.

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
It's beautiful.

27:28.000 --> 27:31.000
It's one of the many things I love about using Linode.

27:31.000 --> 27:37.000
And there's a lot of ways we can take advantage of Linode that are even outside their core, core area that I think most people think of them.

27:37.000 --> 27:44.000
And that that, of course, is their virtual machines, their virtual machines, which run Linux faster and better than anybody else out there.

27:44.000 --> 27:45.000
Hold on. I got notes right here.

27:45.000 --> 27:46.000
I took notes.

27:46.000 --> 27:48.000
I actually got actual physical notes.

27:48.000 --> 27:51.000
I read a research paper that came out recently.

27:51.000 --> 27:59.000
And this is interesting because one of the comments we get when people switch to Linode after they hear about it here on the show is Linode seems just faster than everybody else.

27:59.000 --> 28:04.000
Turns out there is an actual study that was done that shows Linode is faster.

28:04.000 --> 28:16.000
Cloud Spectator recently released a study demonstrating how much faster Linode is at CPU jobs and disk IO jobs, faster than Azure, faster than AWS, faster than DigitalOcean.

28:16.000 --> 28:23.000
And when you use their dedicated AMD CPU rigs, they're smoking everybody else by like a mile.

28:23.000 --> 28:32.000
And the other thing that I thought was interesting that that study showed is that not only do they have the best peak performance, but they also have like the most consistent long term performance.

28:32.000 --> 28:35.000
So if you need a task, it's going to run for a while.

28:35.000 --> 28:39.000
Cloud Spectator's study showed that Linode was the best there as well.

28:39.000 --> 28:45.000
They started in 2003 as one of the first companies in cloud computing, three years before AWS.

28:45.000 --> 28:47.000
So they really kind of have dialed this in.

28:47.000 --> 28:51.000
They have focused on a core set of functionality and that's what they do.

28:51.000 --> 28:58.000
And then they wrap that with absolutely fantastic, best in the industry support and an incredible cloud dashboard to manage it all.

28:58.000 --> 29:01.000
They're dedicated to offering the best in virtualized cloud computing.

29:01.000 --> 29:05.000
If it runs on Linux, it runs on Linode.

29:05.000 --> 29:08.000
So check them out and get a $100 credit and see what I've been talking about.

29:08.000 --> 29:13.000
Linode.com slash coder.

29:13.000 --> 29:17.000
Well, Mr. Dominic, the industry is a changing this week.

29:17.000 --> 29:24.000
The guy in charge of Google Play, also side note, in charge of like a lot of other things like Chrome OS.

29:24.000 --> 29:27.000
Because that's how much they care about Google Play.

29:27.000 --> 29:28.000
Yeah, keep going.

29:28.000 --> 29:35.000
Yeah, but the guy in charge of Google Play is leaving Google and the guy in charge of App Store developer relations is leaving Apple.

29:35.000 --> 29:43.000
All right, so there is only one person and a character I haven't used in years that can explain what an old app developer feels about this.

29:43.000 --> 29:44.000
Uh-huh.

29:44.000 --> 29:45.000
One second.

29:45.000 --> 29:47.000
Two of us died tonight.

29:47.000 --> 29:48.000
Okay.

29:48.000 --> 29:51.000
The city no longer pays for apps.

29:51.000 --> 29:53.000
They download PWAs.

29:53.000 --> 29:56.000
They do microtransactions.

29:56.000 --> 30:01.000
I miss, can't think of an app that made money on the App Store in the last five years crap.

30:01.000 --> 30:05.000
And definitely can't think of one on Google Play because come on.

30:05.000 --> 30:08.000
I was going to say Fortnite, but it's been taken off.

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
No, I mean like direct sales.

30:10.000 --> 30:11.000
I mean, you buy the app.

30:11.000 --> 30:12.000
Yeah.

30:12.000 --> 30:13.000
Yeah.

30:13.000 --> 30:18.000
So both these guys in the same week out from Google and Apple.

30:18.000 --> 30:24.000
Also, Apple claims, I think it was the Australian court, that yeah, Australians competition watchdog.

30:24.000 --> 30:35.000
They've told Australia's competition watchdog that they are, quote, surprised to hear that some developers have concerns over the App Store and the processes in which apps are reviewed, rejected or approved.

30:35.000 --> 30:38.000
They're surprised to hear those complaints.

30:38.000 --> 30:39.000
They're surprised.

30:39.000 --> 30:41.000
Mike, they're surprised.

30:41.000 --> 30:43.000
They're surprised.

30:43.000 --> 30:47.000
I don't understand making us money and turning you all into sharecroppers.

30:47.000 --> 30:48.000
But why?

30:48.000 --> 30:49.000
You guys are upset.

30:49.000 --> 30:55.000
It is wild to see this, to see like the regulators circling in on Facebook, Google and Apple.

30:55.000 --> 30:58.000
They're just like the wagons, you know, they're circled in.

30:58.000 --> 31:03.000
And to see some of these positions change may have something to do with that.

31:03.000 --> 31:09.000
I think these companies are trying to take proactive steps and some of them are pretty serious.

31:09.000 --> 31:16.000
Like, I think that's why Apple recently added the ability for you to export your iCloud photos to Google Photos directly.

31:16.000 --> 31:19.000
It's pathetic that we think that's a huge concession.

31:19.000 --> 31:28.000
But it's a concession like we've never seen from Apple, though, as is being able to change the default web browser and mail app and music player.

31:28.000 --> 31:30.000
All that is that's new, too.

31:30.000 --> 31:33.000
This is one of my old hobby horses, right?

31:33.000 --> 31:35.000
It's just it's too late.

31:35.000 --> 31:37.000
Yeah, like no one's paying for software.

31:37.000 --> 31:50.000
And if you're a new listener and I say new within the last too many years to count, there was a time when I used to rail against the downward price in app prices on the App Store and similar markets.

31:50.000 --> 31:51.000
Yep. Yep.

31:51.000 --> 31:53.000
Now there's generally no price.

31:53.000 --> 31:57.000
Right. Like, I was pissed off about going from ten dollars to five.

31:57.000 --> 31:59.000
It's a lot of subscriptions now.

31:59.000 --> 32:00.000
There's a lot of those.

32:00.000 --> 32:01.000
Yeah, but you know what?

32:01.000 --> 32:02.000
Those are scammy.

32:02.000 --> 32:07.000
And you know, Apple is going to crack down on like tricking people into doing like weekly subscriptions when they don't know they are.

32:07.000 --> 32:08.000
Yeah. Yeah.

32:08.000 --> 32:23.000
I think I mean, I know I said this on a previous episode, but Apple basically mastered and Google and others copied commoditizing your compliment in terms of independent software developers to have an app marketplace or dare I say App Store TM.

32:23.000 --> 32:33.000
The problem is when you commoditize your compliments to the extreme where they can't make any money unless they're like the big boys are doing scammy microtransaction crap.

32:33.000 --> 32:38.000
Things are bad for the consumer, and I'm still I would say ultimately the platform.

32:38.000 --> 32:39.000
You know what?

32:39.000 --> 32:43.000
I don't see many good, interesting new iOS apps coming out.

32:43.000 --> 32:46.000
And I mean, if you're an independent app developer, you have something cool email us.

32:46.000 --> 32:47.000
You never know.

32:47.000 --> 32:52.000
But what I what I mostly see is just like microtransaction garbage.

32:52.000 --> 33:01.000
Yeah. Or device vendor garbage apps that feel like they're templaty and horrible that you have to use to like set some device up on a network or something.

33:01.000 --> 33:08.000
They like hired some small software development company to write them an Ionic app just to shit out and configure their device.

33:08.000 --> 33:12.000
Yeah. And it's amazing how bad they are. And this is true on iOS or Android.

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
Some of them are OK. Some of them are OK.

33:14.000 --> 33:15.000
Couple of them.

33:15.000 --> 33:17.000
Couple of them. I've had some bad experiences.

33:17.000 --> 33:21.000
Yeah, they're all bad because the problem is they want to be on both platforms.

33:21.000 --> 33:22.000
And that is fundamentally a lie.

33:22.000 --> 33:26.000
Yeah. So now remember I said I had a prediction for you.

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
This is interesting.

33:28.000 --> 33:35.000
So it appears that Apple is developing new HomePod models with screens and cameras.

33:35.000 --> 33:37.000
Is that is that true?

33:37.000 --> 33:39.000
Or is this something you were dreaming about?

33:39.000 --> 33:42.000
Oh, you opened your hope chest.

33:42.000 --> 33:44.000
I'm not sure I buy this one.

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
Hey, you know, this could be good for the JayCoin.

33:46.000 --> 33:49.000
So we should follow this one closely.

33:49.000 --> 33:54.000
Well, two things landed today as we record that I think are fascinating.

33:54.000 --> 34:06.000
Number one, what is the who got I sorry, I didn't grab their name, but it came out that there is an unused temperature and humidity sensor in the existing HomePod mini right now.

34:06.000 --> 34:08.000
Oh, I fix it. Sorry, I fix it.

34:08.000 --> 34:13.000
So there is a sensor that is unused right now in the HomePod mini.

34:13.000 --> 34:15.000
All right. So that was discovered today.

34:15.000 --> 34:31.000
Then also today, it appears that Apple has added FaceTime frameworks to the Apple TV and HomePod OSes and adding that via a future iOS update for 14.5.

34:31.000 --> 34:35.000
And they're going to have the AVF capture framework in there.

34:35.000 --> 34:41.000
They're going to have the FaceTime and iMessage framework on the HomePod now and on the Apple TV.

34:41.000 --> 34:50.000
And Mark Gurman says there is no imminent launch planned for a camera equipped speaker, but it's possible that it could be in the future.

34:50.000 --> 34:59.000
So, you know, maybe maybe what they realized is that people that do want these speakers, they want screens on them.

34:59.000 --> 35:02.000
I don't know. I think it's actually kind of nice.

35:02.000 --> 35:15.000
We have kind of gravitated towards having one of the Google Home Nest thingies in our place simply because it makes for a fantastic picture frame and my wife likes that.

35:15.000 --> 35:23.000
The process is really simple because she just has to star a photo and then it automatically shows up on the Google thing as one of the possibilities.

35:23.000 --> 35:32.000
And the fact that it can do timers and has the occasional knowledge card look up that it can do for her or tell her the weather is is nice.

35:32.000 --> 35:40.000
And so I could see Apple integrating something like this with iCloud and Apple Music has a screen, Apple Fitness, which also requires video.

35:40.000 --> 35:45.000
And they have FaceTime, which would be great if you could FaceTime your HomePod.

35:45.000 --> 35:47.000
These frameworks, I think, show what's happening.

35:47.000 --> 35:49.000
Open your red book. I have a prediction.

35:49.000 --> 35:51.000
OK, you got it.

35:51.000 --> 35:53.000
It will be overpriced and fail.

35:53.000 --> 35:55.000
Ah, all right.

35:55.000 --> 36:00.000
Well, see, my prediction is, is that an Apple version of this with a screen actually would be successful.

36:00.000 --> 36:01.000
That's my prediction.

36:01.000 --> 36:04.000
It will fail because they will not be able to help themselves.

36:04.000 --> 36:05.000
It'll be too expensive.

36:05.000 --> 36:06.000
Right. They. Yeah.

36:06.000 --> 36:09.000
You know what? The HomePod and I have Sonos.

36:09.000 --> 36:12.000
The HomePod is superior.

36:12.000 --> 36:14.000
No, it is the HomePod.

36:14.000 --> 36:18.000
It is superior to the Sonos, but it's stupidly priced.

36:18.000 --> 36:23.000
I don't understand why. Why did they kill the product instead of just lowering the price?

36:23.000 --> 36:27.000
I think they killed it because it's a four hundred dollar device with no screen.

36:27.000 --> 36:30.000
And now their devices with screens are going to be four hundred dollars.

36:30.000 --> 36:31.000
You're going to have the mini.

36:31.000 --> 36:33.000
No, I'm saying it should be two hundred dollars.

36:33.000 --> 36:35.000
I know, but this is Apple we're talking about.

36:35.000 --> 36:38.000
Do you really want a screen and a camera like everywhere in your house?

36:38.000 --> 36:39.000
Not a camera. No, not so much.

36:39.000 --> 36:47.000
Although, although I have used the Echo drop in feature, it is nice to have a screen on my desk and have a screen in the kitchen.

36:47.000 --> 36:56.000
And so like right before I'm about to head home, I'll I'll drop in and chat with the wife and she doesn't have to do anything and she doesn't have to, like, you know, dry your hands off if she's making dinner or whatever.

36:56.000 --> 36:59.000
Like, it just works for her and she can do the same for me.

36:59.000 --> 37:01.000
Hey, when you're heading out, it's really simple.

37:01.000 --> 37:04.000
Hang on. Maybe she's hooking up an array of Kubernetes or raspberry pies.

37:04.000 --> 37:05.000
Why is she making dinner?

37:05.000 --> 37:06.000
She could be.

37:06.000 --> 37:09.000
It's the only time I can get you on that stuff.

37:09.000 --> 37:13.000
Because that's actually her use case because she likes to check.

37:13.000 --> 37:15.000
That's true. That's why she uses it.

37:15.000 --> 37:20.000
But I could I could absolutely see us preferring to have a HomePod there to go.

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
There's a lot of ways you can go with this.

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
Would you pay four hundred dollars?

37:24.000 --> 37:30.000
Yeah. Well, I mean, no, that's a little too much.

37:30.000 --> 37:35.000
And isn't that the problem with the HomePod that you and I both love, one of us begrudgingly so?

37:35.000 --> 37:37.000
No, it absolutely is.

37:37.000 --> 37:54.000
I've always looked at these as another app platform in development, and I've always kind of felt like our community, not necessarily saying you or I, but the listeners, I'm blaming them, have always kind of been skeptical about these home assistants because of the privacy implications.

37:54.000 --> 37:59.000
And my argument to that has always been, yeah, but general consumers just don't care.

37:59.000 --> 38:02.000
And these things do sell. And this is a market.

38:02.000 --> 38:08.000
And if you put a screen on that thing, there's no reason you couldn't also put apps on that thing like you do the watch.

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
Oh, God, I hope not.

38:10.000 --> 38:13.000
I think it'd be awesome to tell you the truth.

38:13.000 --> 38:14.000
I think it'd be lousy.

38:14.000 --> 38:19.000
Imagine this in like a conference room with, you know, Slack or Teams video calling auditors.

38:19.000 --> 38:22.000
I know. That is the exact use case I was just bemoaning.

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
Yeah.

38:24.000 --> 38:27.000
I just I need less slack in my life. OK.

38:27.000 --> 38:29.000
Yeah, I agree. There's that.

38:29.000 --> 38:36.000
Yeah, it's funny how Slack was going to replace the tedium of email and it's somehow become the like satanic version of email.

38:36.000 --> 38:41.000
Like I now love when I get a thoughtfully written out paragraph by paragraph email.

38:41.000 --> 38:49.000
Yeah, I just realized I had it so much better with email and I used to hate email so much now, but now I prefer it so much more to all the calls.

38:49.000 --> 38:52.000
Here's my last thing. Google just updated their nest.

38:52.000 --> 38:54.000
And now did you see that their new nest has sleep tracking?

38:54.000 --> 38:57.000
It has a sonar chip in it and it does sleep tracking.

38:57.000 --> 39:02.000
Now, I'm not saying I like this idea. I was going to say I don't I don't love it.

39:02.000 --> 39:06.000
Although they claim it does local processing by anyways.

39:06.000 --> 39:09.000
Oh, yes, they claim that they do.

39:09.000 --> 39:13.000
It also has like some new machine learning chip on board so it can do more local command processing as well.

39:13.000 --> 39:19.000
And I claim every time I boot into Windows, I don't have two martinis first.

39:19.000 --> 39:23.000
I just argue that the general consumer market just doesn't care about the privacy aspects of it.

39:23.000 --> 39:27.000
I think they care. I think you're right. So I agreed with you for years.

39:27.000 --> 39:31.000
But you know what? I think after the capital nonsense.

39:31.000 --> 39:35.000
Yeah. And all the shit that Facebook got caught doing.

39:35.000 --> 39:40.000
Yeah. You know, my mom is like, I hate Facebook and she does not care.

39:40.000 --> 39:48.000
Right. My cousins who are in the accounting business have decided that Facebook is evil based solely on some ill advised interviews Mark Zuckerberg gave.

39:48.000 --> 39:54.000
But their reasons aside, I think people are starting to wake up now. I think they still trust Google, though.

39:54.000 --> 40:00.000
You're right about that. They still think Google is like a benign robot that definitely isn't taking advantage of them.

40:00.000 --> 40:03.000
And I think they trust Amazon as well. I trust Amazon.

40:03.000 --> 40:06.000
Jeff Bezos just told me this morning that I needed a new chair.

40:06.000 --> 40:10.000
Actually, Amazon might creep me out the most out of all of them, to tell you the truth a little bit.

40:10.000 --> 40:16.000
Amazon is predicting my buying habits, which and it's getting to the point of honestly, I'm getting nervous.

40:16.000 --> 40:20.000
Yeah, it's been a good year for Amazon.

40:20.000 --> 40:26.000
It's definitely been a good year, especially like I've been buying like personal care products like toilet paper and stuff on Amazon now.

40:26.000 --> 40:30.000
Yeah. And they're like, yeah, we've been calculating how much you poop, bro.

40:30.000 --> 40:33.000
And it's about time. Subscribe and save.

40:33.000 --> 40:37.000
And yeah, I know it. You start. There's a line you cross with Amazon where you start.

40:37.000 --> 40:41.000
You start buying more intimate things like that and you have to make that choice.

40:41.000 --> 40:47.000
Like, all right, I'm going to give them this data point. I mean, I literally sat down on the toilet with the Amazon app open.

40:47.000 --> 40:52.000
Am I OK with Uncle Jeff knowing that I'm taking a crap right now?

40:52.000 --> 40:59.000
See now, don't you want a sonar and a camera on that thing? No, I'm afraid that I don't.

40:59.000 --> 41:03.000
Datadog.com slash Coder Radio. Go check out Datadog.

41:03.000 --> 41:09.000
Man, are these beautiful dashboards and it really helps if you see them. So go to Datadog.com slash Coder Radio.

41:09.000 --> 41:19.000
Go check out what's possible. I mean, it's a fantastic tool to help you communicate with your team and analyze code level performance across your environment and troubleshoot issues faster.

41:19.000 --> 41:27.000
You can do that with Datadog and Datadog has a continuous profiler that automatically collects profiles from your production servers all the time.

41:27.000 --> 41:33.000
So you can analyze any data, all your data or just specific data quickly with minimal overhead.

41:33.000 --> 41:40.000
You can create a unified picture of your environment by correlating code performance and metrics with your rigs and application level performance.

41:40.000 --> 41:46.000
And of course, server level performance in real time on their beautiful dashboards.

41:46.000 --> 41:54.000

42:22.000 --> 42:33.000
Now, moving on from the tragedy that is these home pods and smart assistants that are spy devices, but also strange future app platforms, as I say.

42:33.000 --> 42:38.000
And let's talk instead about the new GitLab release. Both you and I noticed this one hit.

42:38.000 --> 42:42.000
It's got a couple of features in here that I find pretty handy.

42:42.000 --> 42:47.000
Yeah, I don't want to spend too much time on this. I'm a GitLab user myself, but it's nice to see.

42:47.000 --> 42:53.000
Yeah, they've got a new admin mode. It's open source and the stuff is in the, I believe they call, I use it, the community edition.

42:53.000 --> 42:58.000
Is that what they call it? We use it every day and I don't pay attention. And a vulnerability management.

42:58.000 --> 43:03.000
This is not a huge update, I would say. You know, it's enough to be notable.

43:03.000 --> 43:08.000
If you are running GitLab, you might consider depending on how many versions back you are updating.

43:08.000 --> 43:12.000
This is 13, 13.10. That admin mode is not bad, right?

43:12.000 --> 43:18.000
It's kind of like pseudo, but for GitLab. So you can pop into admin mode to do something as you need it.

43:18.000 --> 43:22.000
And then back to a regular user account without having to go through the full log out and log in process.

43:22.000 --> 43:28.000
It's such a pain in the ass because I have 2FA, so it's like, ugh, every time I log in and out.

43:28.000 --> 43:34.000
Bulk status updates allow security teams to modify the status of multiple vulnerabilities simultaneously.

43:34.000 --> 43:41.000
And then the Visual Studio Code revolution continues, making it easy to clone projects from within Visual Studio Code on your GitLab.

43:41.000 --> 43:45.000
And enabling one click opening of projects into VS Code.

43:45.000 --> 43:52.000
Yeah, I'm really pleased with the Borg-like march of IE6 to IDE. Yeah.

43:52.000 --> 43:55.000
Hey, man, at least it's not nearly as bad as IE6.

43:55.000 --> 43:56.000
Yet.

43:56.000 --> 43:59.000
You know, and the thing is, I mean, I'll say this too about Blink, I suppose.

43:59.000 --> 44:04.000
But at the end of the day, it's open source, at least where we never had that with Internet Explorer.

44:04.000 --> 44:06.000
Right? That's got to be worth something.

44:06.000 --> 44:08.000
We can agree to disagree on this one.

44:08.000 --> 44:12.000
Okay. I mean, I love to see it. I love to see GitLab march on.

44:12.000 --> 44:16.000
I think in some ways it's more important. Oh, GitLab I'm fine with. Oh, yeah, for sure.

44:16.000 --> 44:19.000
It's VS Code that I'm starting to become a little eee. I follow.

44:19.000 --> 44:22.000
What are you going to do? This seems like it happens all the time.

44:22.000 --> 44:26.000
People said the same thing about AOL. People said the same thing about MySpace.

44:26.000 --> 44:33.000
It just feels like these things come along and they reign supreme for a while, but these don't last forever.

44:33.000 --> 44:37.000
Right, right, right. Every king's reign ends. I get it.

44:37.000 --> 44:39.000
What goes up must come down. Text me. Right.

44:39.000 --> 44:45.000
So far, though, we haven't really seen Facebook come down and it doesn't really seem like Apple's going down or Microsoft.

44:45.000 --> 44:55.000
I kind of wonder if that old Adam is not as true in the era of these true legitimate tech giants that are like nation wealthy, nation size wealthy.

44:55.000 --> 45:03.000
It's almost as if when you have zero interest rate in rich, large corporations, they can indefinitely finance themselves and buy up any potential competition.

45:03.000 --> 45:06.000
Yeah, almost like that. Listen to Unfiltered.

45:06.000 --> 45:12.000
Here's your plug. So Adobe has drank the M1 Kool-Aid.

45:12.000 --> 45:19.000
Yeah, yeah. And they have correctly genuflected and bent the knee writing a blog post about how wonderful Apple is.

45:19.000 --> 45:24.000
OK, good work Adobe. Hey, man, they know the game. They know the game.

45:24.000 --> 45:30.000
They made sure to drop a few juicy quotes that you knew that Apple brass would be would be reviewing.

45:30.000 --> 45:38.000
He says this is Adobe. They say recompiling large applications for Apple Silicon requires an investment on the developers.

45:38.000 --> 45:42.000
But in Photoshop's case, it resulted in a significant performance improvement.

45:42.000 --> 45:47.000
We compared the M1 MacBook to previous generation MacBook simply just configured.

45:47.000 --> 45:53.000
We just converted without doing any major optimizations. And Photoshop was 50 percent faster than the Intel hardware.

45:53.000 --> 45:58.000
Just porting it over based on some very specific magic tricks, I am sure.

45:58.000 --> 46:03.000
Yeah, yeah. Although actually, I think end users are seeing the benefits as well.

46:03.000 --> 46:07.000
I think it's only two apps right now that have been. Yeah, Photoshop and Lightroom have native versions.

46:07.000 --> 46:10.000
And Lightroom also is reportedly working much faster.

46:10.000 --> 46:21.000
And Premiere Pro and Audition are in beta right now for Apple Silicon support, which I think it is possible to get those if you're a Creative Cloud subscriber.

46:21.000 --> 46:27.000
OK, so I really am sorry for people who are sick of hearing this, but this is legitimately something.

46:27.000 --> 46:35.000
I'm still kind of quietly panicking about and that is. We haven't even realized the potential of the M1 yet.

46:35.000 --> 46:40.000
We hear about these applications getting ported and they're 50 percent faster.

46:40.000 --> 46:46.000
You also hear that like the interface is smooth and faster in a way that people have not experienced before.

46:46.000 --> 46:51.000
Then you also hear things like it changes resolution instantly when you connect or disconnect displays.

46:51.000 --> 46:54.000
It's not a big flashy kind of seizure effect.

46:54.000 --> 47:05.000
And you realize that they're about any any week now to release the next version of these in a whole another generation of Mac workstations and desktops.

47:05.000 --> 47:16.000
And I, who have been running Linux since the 90s, am worried that a guy like me is going to get tempted because at the end of the day, I am busy.

47:16.000 --> 47:23.000
And that smooth, smooth computer goodness is so hard for me to resist.

47:23.000 --> 47:29.000
I experienced it recently when I finally got a high refresh rate screen and it clicked for me like, oh, this is I'm never going back.

47:29.000 --> 47:34.000
And I worry that the M1 would be like that or the M1X or whatever.

47:34.000 --> 47:38.000
And then I see this Photoshop stuff and I see I see like audition is running faster.

47:38.000 --> 47:51.000
And I start thinking, oh, shit, man, if the production tools end up being way faster, if I could cut a 50 minute render time down to 20 minutes every time I do a show, that could be a huge gain for me.

47:51.000 --> 47:55.000
I could get back to my life sooner. I could get back to working on the next thing faster.

47:55.000 --> 48:03.000
And I'm worried I am legitimately worried that the X86 industry in a year or two is just going to look archaic.

48:03.000 --> 48:10.000
And none of the machines are going to stand up to this kind of performance unless because not only because here's the other problem like battery life.

48:10.000 --> 48:12.000
Well, yeah, the battery life, which I didn't even think of.

48:12.000 --> 48:17.000
But the PC side is struggling with a massive chip shortage right now.

48:17.000 --> 48:25.000
CPUs and you really can't really build a system right now without just paying outrageous prices.

48:25.000 --> 48:29.000
But it hasn't seemed to have affected Apple in the same way.

48:29.000 --> 48:35.000
And I wonder if that isn't because they literally spend billions to pre buy up a lot of inventory.

48:35.000 --> 48:45.000
And if that strategic investment isn't going to also make it so that way they can actually get these machines out the door while the PC industry really can't ship their latest and greatest stuff at any scale.

48:45.000 --> 48:50.000
So while not only are they having a shortage of parts so you can't build fast enough PCs.

48:50.000 --> 48:55.000
At the same time, Apple is about to iterate yet again on the M platform with another series of Macs.

48:55.000 --> 49:06.000
And we are just now beginning to see the benefits of applications getting ported to the M1 and big old pigs like Photoshop without any further optimization are coming in at 50 percent faster.

49:06.000 --> 49:08.000
Awfully mean to Photoshop.

49:08.000 --> 49:16.000
I just don't know how desktop Linux is going to is going to be able to really sway anybody to switch into that when this is.

49:16.000 --> 49:18.000
I mean, Wayland is nice.

49:18.000 --> 49:20.000
GNOME 40 is nice.

49:20.000 --> 49:23.000
The ThinkPad is nice, but it's not M1 nice.

49:23.000 --> 49:27.000
And I am worried that's a problem for people who are just into tech.

49:27.000 --> 49:33.000
It won't be a problem for the diehard, freedom fighting, GPL loving, you know, software hippies.

49:33.000 --> 49:35.000
Oh, yeah. RMS is back.

49:35.000 --> 49:37.000
Yeah, I know. It's not going to sway RMS.

49:37.000 --> 49:40.000
And anybody who thinks slightly like RMS.

49:40.000 --> 49:50.000
But people who are OK using multiple platforms and have busy lives and have the money to blow on a Mac, I think they're going to which he's talking about me.

49:50.000 --> 49:53.000
I feel like I just worry. I just worry. I know I shouldn't.

49:53.000 --> 49:56.000
I know we've talked about this to death, but it actually is still concerning me.

49:56.000 --> 49:58.000
And I just feel like more evidence has been put in front of me.

49:58.000 --> 50:01.000
You just panic attacked a lot of words.

50:01.000 --> 50:03.000
I did. I'm sorry. I am worried.

50:03.000 --> 50:07.000
Let me sum up what I believe your problem is.

50:07.000 --> 50:10.000
OK. Dark side is a pathway to.

50:10.000 --> 50:14.000
Oh, my God, I can't say it because I'm running Intel still.

50:14.000 --> 50:20.000
And now let me get my M1. Hang on. Let me reboot.

50:20.000 --> 50:27.000
Now that I'm on ARM, the dark side is a pathway to many abilities, some considered to be unnatural.

50:27.000 --> 50:30.000
Yeah, dude, the M1 MacBook Air just donks on my iMac Pro.

50:30.000 --> 50:34.000
It's just like I was compiling C++ the other day, as one does.

50:34.000 --> 50:40.000
And the M1 is like, yeah, it's done. Like, what? It's fine. What do you want?

50:40.000 --> 50:43.000
The Xeon is like, oh, hang on. Let me spin up this fan for you.

50:43.000 --> 50:50.000
And like this Sunday, Wes and I were rendering out Linux action news and I used a newer, faster box and the one I typically use.

50:50.000 --> 50:53.000
And it was like significantly faster.

50:53.000 --> 51:00.000
And it hit me if I could have another jump like that with the M1, I would really have a hard time talking myself out of it.

51:00.000 --> 51:06.000
It's a big improvement. And that would be daily that something I do daily would be faster and something I sometimes have to wait.

51:06.000 --> 51:11.000
Like if the show like a show that's an hour along, sometimes like a 45 minute process.

51:11.000 --> 51:17.000
So to drop that down to 15, 20 minutes and to get that a minimum of once or twice a week back.

51:17.000 --> 51:20.000
Oh, that's a that's a tough argument.

51:20.000 --> 51:30.000
And I think the reason why I get so spun up about it is I watched it happen years ago when Apple like 2006, 2007, 2008,

51:30.000 --> 51:39.000
when Apple came out with the Intel MacBooks and GNOME 3 came out and Unity came out and I watched this exodus.

51:39.000 --> 51:48.000
And I could see it happen in front of me at events where Dells and ThinkPads just started to become less and less and MacBooks started showing up.

51:48.000 --> 51:54.000
And at first it was quaint. And my buddy Noah and I would walk around and we count, oh, we counted 15 MacBooks.

51:54.000 --> 51:59.000
And then within two, three years, it was we would count how many machines weren't Macs.

51:59.000 --> 52:04.000
And, you know, it'd be a dozen and everything else was Macs. And these are Linux and open source events we're at.

52:04.000 --> 52:09.000
And we come back and we talk about it on air, but we kind of just stopped talking about it after a while because it just became old news.

52:09.000 --> 52:15.000
My desire to troll you has never been stronger. I will give you a semi-serious answer.

52:15.000 --> 52:20.000
There is nothing on the roadmap and I've been paying attention from AMD or Intel that is going to challenge the M1.

52:20.000 --> 52:26.000
And what I presume the M2, just guessing on what the name is going to be right, is going to do.

52:26.000 --> 52:33.000
I think resistance is in fact futile. I mean, you and I can go to a conference if that ever is a thing again, which I doubt.

52:33.000 --> 52:40.000
And I will have my little MacBook Air with 20 hours of battery life and you will be looking for an outlet and I will make fun of you.

52:40.000 --> 52:47.000
The battery life thing is very appealing. All right. Well, give me some hope. Let me know what you think. Coder.show slash contact.

52:47.000 --> 52:57.000
Maybe there's another path that I'm not seeing. My one argument has always been with the M1 stuff that I could tell myself was, yes, but I could build a PC that's faster than an M1 Mac.

52:57.000 --> 53:03.000
I could have 64 gigs of RAM. I could have 128 gigs of RAM. I could have two physical processors, right? I could.

53:03.000 --> 53:12.000
But in actuality, no one cares. You can't unless you want to spend nearly two grand on a GPU and eight hundred dollars on a CPU and three hundred dollars on the motherboard to run that.

53:12.000 --> 53:18.000
And even RAM prices are up right now. Oh, I would not be buying parts right now. That's for damn sure.

53:18.000 --> 53:24.000
Well, Mr. Dominic, I could be wrong. We love the feedback either way. Coder.show slash contact. Let us know your thoughts.

53:24.000 --> 53:30.000
It's a big part of what we do over here. Also, thank you to our members, the Coder QA team.

53:30.000 --> 53:36.000

53:36.000 --> 53:45.000
You can get all of that at Coder QA dot co. And we appreciate your support there. Mike's on Twitter. He's at Dumanuco. His company is at the Mad Botter Inc.

53:45.000 --> 53:48.000
Is there anything else you want to mention this episode, Mr. Dominic?

53:48.000 --> 53:56.000
Oh, speaking of Apple stuff, we weirdly have availability to do iOS or I guess cross platform if you really, really need Android development.

53:56.000 --> 54:01.000
So, yeah, if you have that, we have availability starting April 1st.

54:01.000 --> 54:03.000
Best way to get a hold of you for that?

54:03.000 --> 54:06.000
Just tweet me, I guess, or Mike at the Mad Botter dot com is fine.

54:06.000 --> 54:14.000
There you go. I'm at Chris Lass on the Twitter. The whole podcast network is at Jupiter Signal and the show is at Coder Radio Show.
