My name is Chris and joining us tweeting to troll me, it is our host, Mr. Dominic.

00:44.280 --> 00:45.280
Hello Mike.

00:45.280 --> 00:46.280
Hello Chris.

00:46.280 --> 00:52.760
And, uh, you know, I am, I am truly sorry that we said gathering here to dunk and pour

00:52.760 --> 00:55.520
some out for your home pod, son.

00:55.520 --> 00:56.520
Already!

00:56.520 --> 00:57.520
We're just right off the top.

00:57.520 --> 00:58.520
We said going hard!

00:58.520 --> 00:59.520
Wow.

00:59.520 --> 01:03.200
You know, I've been getting trolled all week about this.

01:03.200 --> 01:05.720
Yeah, this must have been a bad week for you, Mike.

01:05.720 --> 01:07.200
Was it a bad week?

01:07.200 --> 01:08.200
Yeah.

01:08.200 --> 01:12.880
I mean, it involved, uh, first of all, of course, I found out via like an audience member

01:12.880 --> 01:13.880
ribbing me.

01:13.880 --> 01:18.200
So that's, that's how I found out about the home pod getting canceled.

01:18.200 --> 01:19.280
It's rough.

01:19.280 --> 01:20.280
You know what I realized?

01:20.280 --> 01:21.280
I had, I had a moment, right?

01:21.280 --> 01:24.320
I had several moments because- Hang on, hang on, hang on.

01:24.320 --> 01:25.320
Did you hear that snap?

01:25.320 --> 01:26.320
Did it come through?

01:26.320 --> 01:27.320
Yeah.

01:27.320 --> 01:28.320
It was inevitable.

01:28.320 --> 01:29.320
I know.

01:29.320 --> 01:32.000
I don't normally, I don't normally buy Apple products that you can smell from a mile away

01:32.000 --> 01:33.240
aren't going to make it.

01:33.240 --> 01:37.080
As I sit in front of an iMac pro who also got killed this week.

01:37.080 --> 01:38.840
That, you know, yeah.

01:38.840 --> 01:39.840
Yeah.

01:39.840 --> 01:40.920
That's a good example actually.

01:40.920 --> 01:46.560
But, uh, the home pod, I think the problem with the home pod was that you had to experience

01:46.560 --> 01:50.360
it to understand its value because it's, it's something you hear.

01:50.360 --> 01:51.520
It's not something you can see.

01:51.520 --> 01:52.980
It's not something you can touch.

01:52.980 --> 01:54.400
It's something you hear.

01:54.400 --> 01:59.280
And to really appreciate the home pod, you needed two of them to really make this sucker

01:59.280 --> 02:00.280
sing.

02:00.280 --> 02:02.240
So I am actually going to give you something on the home pod.

02:02.240 --> 02:06.760
I had a guest over the other night and I wanted to play music on the Sonos.

02:06.760 --> 02:07.760
Yeah.

02:07.760 --> 02:11.320
But because of Apple's, how can we put this?

02:11.320 --> 02:15.560
Game of Thrones, Iron Throne style lock on their platform.

02:15.560 --> 02:21.040
I was unable to do that in less than seven taps, which required me to put in my Apple

02:21.040 --> 02:28.680
ID password on an iPhone, which already has, if I said, Hey, Solana, I'm avoiding the real

02:28.680 --> 02:29.680
name, right?

02:29.680 --> 02:30.680
Hey, cilantro.

02:30.680 --> 02:31.680
Buenos dias, Selena.

02:31.680 --> 02:32.680
Selena.

02:32.680 --> 02:33.680
I'm sorry.

02:33.680 --> 02:34.680
My Spanish.

02:34.680 --> 02:37.760
It's, I took it for 10 years and then I forgot.

02:37.760 --> 02:41.400
It kind of did not keep the spirit of what I was going for there.

02:41.400 --> 02:45.220
You know, C plus plus was over, you know what I'm talking about here.

02:45.220 --> 02:48.520
Had I had a home pod and you know how much this hurts me, Chris.

02:48.520 --> 02:49.640
The moment would have been saved.

02:49.640 --> 02:50.880
Not even one tap.

02:50.880 --> 02:51.880
Yeah.

02:51.880 --> 02:53.080
But a, Hey, cilantro.

02:53.080 --> 02:56.120
Or just a quick, you know, it integrates super well with airplay, right?

02:56.120 --> 02:57.120
It's an airplay speaker.

02:57.120 --> 02:58.120
Yeah.

02:58.120 --> 03:00.200
Apparently my Sonos is too old.

03:00.200 --> 03:01.200
Yeah.

03:01.200 --> 03:02.200
Yeah.

03:02.200 --> 03:07.320
I mean, I'm in this weird like sunk cost fallacy where Apple used to like Sonos and it used

03:07.320 --> 03:08.320
to work.

03:08.320 --> 03:11.880
Like you can't, did you know you can't change the volume on a Sonos with the, with the rocker

03:11.880 --> 03:16.640
on the, it's, it's, it's actually like ridiculous.

03:16.640 --> 03:20.520
And I'm kind of like, I want to buy a home pod, but then they canceled the home pod,

03:20.520 --> 03:25.160
but I also don't want to reward what is very obvious anti-competitive behavior.

03:25.160 --> 03:29.480
And like Sonos is like, you could buy a newer Sonos that allows airplay to, but I'm like,

03:29.480 --> 03:33.780
I don't know the speakers, the same speaker.

03:33.780 --> 03:36.160
So the Sonos is a niche, right?

03:36.160 --> 03:38.040
This, this is, this was a super niche product.

03:38.040 --> 03:43.200
I'm not sure why Apple ever made it, but it actually was an exceptionally good product.

03:43.200 --> 03:47.280
It was so good that as you know, I bought several of them, but I also, you mean the

03:47.280 --> 03:48.280
home pod?

03:48.280 --> 03:49.280
Yeah.

03:49.280 --> 03:50.280
Not the song.

03:50.280 --> 03:53.400
It made me, the home pod made me switch to the Apple TV as well.

03:53.400 --> 03:56.980
So they, they sucked me in that way because again, I'm an Apple TV user.

03:56.980 --> 03:59.560
So it's like the Sonos was the mistake.

03:59.560 --> 04:00.560
Yeah.

04:00.560 --> 04:03.440
It it's so great the way they, they sorted out the Dolby digital stuff.

04:03.440 --> 04:11.120
So that way the home pods like wireless surround sound is just a tap away and it works so well

04:11.120 --> 04:13.040
and it really adds a layer.

04:13.040 --> 04:15.600
You know, I had, it was one of those moments where my wife leaned over and she said, I'm

04:15.600 --> 04:17.160
really glad we set those home pods up.

04:17.160 --> 04:18.960
This really is more immersive.

04:18.960 --> 04:22.300
Like she, you know, when the wife notices it, you're like, you really feel good.

04:22.300 --> 04:23.300
They just sounded so good.

04:23.300 --> 04:28.200
The problem was they're so locked into the airplay ecosystem.

04:28.200 --> 04:30.740
And then on top of that, Siri's not very good.

04:30.740 --> 04:34.360
And because you had to hear them and you had to already be in this ecosystem to get them

04:34.360 --> 04:38.720
and they were priced too high, you know, they came out at 350 later, lowered to 299.

04:38.720 --> 04:46.540
The other thing is from a home assistant perspective, home pods can be set to work with a self-hosted

04:46.540 --> 04:50.600
home assistant instance and become voice control for home assistant and I would love it for

04:50.600 --> 04:51.600
that purpose.

04:51.600 --> 04:55.360
That's another reason why I got so into it, but I knew it was coming.

04:55.360 --> 04:56.360
I knew it would happen.

04:56.360 --> 05:00.400
And the mini, the iPod, the home pod mini, it's fine, but it's, it's nowhere near the

05:00.400 --> 05:01.400
same level.

05:01.400 --> 05:06.120
And see, the thing is, is if you look at the home pod as not like a, an echo competitor,

05:06.120 --> 05:12.160
but if you look at it as a home theater system competitor or a Sonos five competitor, that

05:12.160 --> 05:16.520
$300 price point is actually pretty reasonable because something close to it's about $500.

05:16.520 --> 05:20.340
So when you look at it from a home theater standpoint, because this is, I was using this

05:20.340 --> 05:24.520
in combination with a set, well, I still will be until they stopped being supported in combination

05:24.520 --> 05:30.600
with a sound bar and a dedicated subwoofer and then one home pod mini as a tweeter.

05:30.600 --> 05:36.760
So I have quite the setup with this Apple TV and it all works flawlessly.

05:36.760 --> 05:40.440
And there's not a single wire I had to run to do any of this.

05:40.440 --> 05:45.840
I just set the units down and connected them in the UI and forever forth they are now the

05:45.840 --> 05:50.280
sound system for the Apple TV and it's, it's nice and my family likes it.

05:50.280 --> 05:53.960
And so I, in kind of a moment of like, Oh, what am I going to do now?

05:53.960 --> 05:58.840
I bought another one while I still could.

05:58.840 --> 06:01.680
So I've got another one that I'm going to leave in the box.

06:01.680 --> 06:04.080
I think I'm going to actually leave it in the box.

06:04.080 --> 06:11.400
I'll see your one and raise you to, I literally just bought two as you've been talking.

06:11.400 --> 06:12.400
That's amazing.

06:12.400 --> 06:17.120
You just spent $648 and 83 cents on home pods.

06:17.120 --> 06:21.120
I think they're, you know what, I honestly was having a conversation with my wife.

06:21.120 --> 06:24.480
I'm like, you know, you don't really want to burn the money, but at the same time, like

06:24.480 --> 06:28.800
we really like these and she likes them too because she likes to listen to our audio books

06:28.800 --> 06:33.180
and her podcasts when I'm not there, she just can fill out the, the thing is, is we have,

06:33.180 --> 06:39.180
we have a pretty small space, you know, 300 square feet or so, and we put home pods throughout

06:39.180 --> 06:40.180
it.

06:40.180 --> 06:44.960
We can have seamless audio everywhere throughout the home with these suckers.

06:44.960 --> 06:45.960
Love them.

06:45.960 --> 06:46.960
It's too bad.

06:46.960 --> 06:49.960
Well, you know what it is too, when I'm like doing stuff around the house, I don't want

06:49.960 --> 06:53.000
to have to like tap seven times to play a goddamn song.

06:53.000 --> 06:56.140
You know, I know it's, there's other ways to solve this problem and all of that.

06:56.140 --> 06:59.800
So it's not like it's, it's not like it, it's not like it discontinued a super important

06:59.800 --> 07:04.480
computing platform, but that's, you know, I knew they were going to do this stupid ecosystem,

07:04.480 --> 07:07.700
stupid lock-in, stupid, stupid, no line in whatever.

07:07.700 --> 07:13.400
So apparently if you paste an image into adium now, it encrypts it into some sort of spring

07:13.400 --> 07:14.400
format.

07:14.400 --> 07:15.400
This is getting no, no.

07:15.400 --> 07:16.400
It's adium.

07:16.400 --> 07:17.400
I don't give a crap.

07:17.400 --> 07:18.400
I'm not doing it.

07:18.400 --> 07:20.040
I will not do that.

07:20.040 --> 07:21.040
No.

07:21.040 --> 07:24.360
So you asked the audience, you know, what should, what, what would hit a nerve the most

07:24.360 --> 07:25.680
with me to troll me this week?

07:25.680 --> 07:26.680
Yes.

07:26.680 --> 07:27.680
Hang on.

07:27.680 --> 07:28.680
I want to read all the options.

07:28.680 --> 07:29.680
I have a whole plan.

07:29.680 --> 07:30.680
Okay.

07:30.680 --> 07:31.680
Sorry.

07:31.680 --> 07:32.680
You know, I get upset about it.

07:32.680 --> 07:33.680
You know, I know, no, I know it's important.

07:33.680 --> 07:38.960
I know that chat client from 1997 is extremely important.

07:38.960 --> 07:40.440
I don't think it's actually from that.

07:40.440 --> 07:43.080
No, it's not that actually, no.

07:43.080 --> 07:47.100
So I'm completely unprepared because instead of clicking the link in the doc, I decided

07:47.100 --> 07:49.800
to go through my Twitter history and apparently I just tweet.

07:49.800 --> 07:50.800
Oh yeah.

07:50.800 --> 07:51.800
I got them right here.

07:51.800 --> 07:52.800
Hang on.

07:52.800 --> 07:53.800
I have an order I want to do.

07:53.800 --> 07:58.260
Oh, so coming in in the rear, what was the question?

07:58.260 --> 07:59.880
Things I could troll Chris about.

07:59.880 --> 08:00.880
Yeah.

08:00.880 --> 08:01.880
Yeah.

08:01.880 --> 08:07.360
So 18.1% of the vote brought in the rear and I feel like to be honest with you, that's

08:07.360 --> 08:11.180
a lot of you Linux unplugged guys feeling short in the pants.

08:11.180 --> 08:13.880
Just want to knowledge it, but we'll just keep moving.

08:13.880 --> 08:16.840
18.8 is classic Jar Jar.

08:16.840 --> 08:17.840
Fair enough.

08:17.840 --> 08:18.840
Right?

08:18.840 --> 08:19.840
23.5 sues.

08:19.840 --> 08:20.840
Oh, I'm sorry.

08:20.840 --> 08:21.840
Germans, please.

08:21.840 --> 08:30.840
Sousa slash lizard people, but with a commanding lead of 39.6%.

08:30.840 --> 08:34.600
The demise of the HomePod.

08:34.600 --> 08:40.880
Although I feel like I really blunted my blade here by buying two of them live on the air.

08:40.880 --> 08:45.080
You know, I love that all of these, some people, like these are all like baseline good troll

08:45.080 --> 08:46.560
topics apparently.

08:46.560 --> 08:52.040
I got, I got, I got notes from the sues people all week long for some strange reason.

08:52.040 --> 08:53.040
It definitely wasn't me.

08:53.040 --> 08:54.040
No.

08:54.040 --> 08:59.220
It wasn't me like aggressively tweeting you every day and hiding notes and source code

08:59.220 --> 09:00.220
on websites.

09:00.220 --> 09:06.800
Oh, you found it nicely done nicely done.

09:06.800 --> 09:09.680
The best is I can't use the coder by its name.

09:09.680 --> 09:12.320
Oh, there's a company called that.

09:12.320 --> 09:15.240
So it's going to be coder tales and I filed the trademark.

09:15.240 --> 09:17.740
So Oh, okay.

09:17.740 --> 09:18.740
Tales from the coder.

09:18.740 --> 09:19.740
I mean that works right.

09:19.740 --> 09:23.560
Coder tales, but don't worry cause they're all going to be themed on an intrepid lizard

09:23.560 --> 09:24.560
name.

09:24.560 --> 09:25.560
Sal.

09:25.560 --> 09:26.560
Oh my Sal.

09:26.560 --> 09:27.560
Susie, Susie.

09:27.560 --> 09:28.560
Oh no.

09:28.560 --> 09:31.880
It'll be a girl lizard and I'll call her Susie.

09:31.880 --> 09:32.880
Oh my God.

09:32.880 --> 09:33.880
It's perfect.

09:33.880 --> 09:34.880
That's pretty good.

09:34.880 --> 09:35.880
That's pretty good.

09:35.880 --> 09:36.880
Actually.

09:36.880 --> 09:39.120
I mean, I don't like the sues part, but that's pretty good.

09:39.120 --> 09:42.640
Is Mike investing tens of thousands of dollars in trolling Chris?

09:42.640 --> 09:46.840
Maybe, maybe it's just, maybe that's a good way to make biz sound.

09:46.840 --> 09:51.120
Business choices could be, you know, we got a little sues note from Nathan.

09:51.120 --> 09:56.560
He wrote in, also he mentioned that a lisp is great and that he recommends people check

09:56.560 --> 10:03.320
out portacle, which is an IDE sick, I know of course.

10:03.320 --> 10:09.240
Also he said that he recommends that people check out the vs code extension for common

10:09.240 --> 10:10.240
lisp.

10:10.240 --> 10:11.240
It's pretty great.

10:11.240 --> 10:12.240
Oh my God.

10:12.240 --> 10:16.580
But he, he wants to know if you're going to put your money where your mouth is and eventually

10:16.580 --> 10:19.160
install open sues on your Thalia.

10:19.160 --> 10:22.280
He says I've been triggered by Chris's criticisms with open sues.

10:22.280 --> 10:23.760
What are you high?

10:23.760 --> 10:26.760
But he says, I'm realizing maybe Chris is right.

10:26.760 --> 10:30.840
I have also experienced many of the paper cuts that he has and I can't really say I

10:30.840 --> 10:34.680
use open sues or Sousa as a daily driver anymore.

10:34.680 --> 10:36.000
By the way, looking forward to the robe.

10:36.000 --> 10:37.880
I think you should do it again next year.

10:37.880 --> 10:38.880
Boom.

10:38.880 --> 10:40.960
Looking forward to morning coding in the robe, he says.

10:40.960 --> 10:44.680
So what is the, what Sousa isn't Thalia worthy.

10:44.680 --> 10:47.860
So I have a trolley answer, but I'm going to give you the real answer.

10:47.860 --> 10:49.800
With the Thalia starter board.

10:49.800 --> 10:50.800
Can I install Sousa?

10:50.800 --> 10:51.800
Oh sure.

10:51.800 --> 10:56.080
I thought that was like a custom, no, no, I don't work fine.

10:56.080 --> 10:57.560
He runs independently of the OS.

10:57.560 --> 10:58.560
Oh, okay.

10:58.560 --> 10:59.560
It's for Merlin.

10:59.560 --> 11:00.560
Okay.

11:00.560 --> 11:01.560
Yeah.

11:01.560 --> 11:02.560
I don't know.

11:02.560 --> 11:03.640
I don't know if, uh, like some of the system 76 tools and stuff, I don't know if those

11:03.640 --> 11:05.760
are packaged for Sousa, but the system will run.

11:05.760 --> 11:09.080
Well, my Thalia is, is a glorified flight simulator right now.

11:09.080 --> 11:13.400
I mean, when I say glorified, it's the only computer I have with a good GPU.

11:13.400 --> 11:20.760
So it's actually the best computer I own, but it has one job, like it does one thing.

11:20.760 --> 11:21.840
Is that windows 10?

11:21.840 --> 11:22.840
It is not.

11:22.840 --> 11:23.840
Oh really?

11:23.840 --> 11:24.840
It is pop OS.

11:24.840 --> 11:25.840
No.

11:25.840 --> 11:26.840
Oh, okay.

11:26.840 --> 11:30.120
That'd be pretty funny if it was now, I did try to do a video.

11:30.120 --> 11:32.700
If you want to troll me about my OS is on my lemur.

11:32.700 --> 11:33.700
Not so good.

11:33.700 --> 11:34.700
Yeah.

11:34.700 --> 11:35.700
Fan noise.

11:35.700 --> 11:36.700
Oh yeah.

11:36.700 --> 11:37.700
Yeah.

11:37.700 --> 11:38.700
The fan noise.

11:38.700 --> 11:39.700
Yeah.

11:39.700 --> 11:40.700
Yeah.

11:40.700 --> 11:41.700
It's, it's tricky.

11:41.700 --> 11:42.700
It's tricky for the laptops.

11:42.700 --> 11:46.560
So the iMac pro, I am sorry, Ivan, you never even got a chance.

11:46.560 --> 11:54.000
Like Apple was like, this is our new pro Mac and then Mark Warman was like, no, you.

11:54.000 --> 11:56.840
They really thought that was going to be the high end Mac forever.

11:56.840 --> 11:57.840
You know what?

11:57.840 --> 11:58.840
It's, it's not a bad computer.

11:58.840 --> 12:03.680
I mean, it's unfortunate that the day I get a dead pixel, I will have lost $5,000.

12:03.680 --> 12:08.520
Well, and, or if you ever need like storage fixed or a screen fix, you've got to bring

12:08.520 --> 12:10.320
your entire fricking computer in.

12:10.320 --> 12:15.480
Or the fact that I've done benchmarks on my MacBook air just destroys it in many cases

12:15.480 --> 12:16.480
that I can.

12:16.480 --> 12:17.480
Well, there's that too.

12:17.480 --> 12:20.240
But I mean, just in terms of like even an M one based iMac, still going to have some

12:20.240 --> 12:23.480
of the limitations that limitations that an all in one computer has.

12:23.480 --> 12:25.520
Honestly, I wish it, okay.

12:25.520 --> 12:29.560
I don't know why we're going here, but I wish I had not bought this and it waited and bought

12:29.560 --> 12:33.560
on a M one iMac pro or whatever they're going to call it.

12:33.560 --> 12:34.560
Right.

12:34.560 --> 12:35.560
I'm Mac, whatever.

12:35.560 --> 12:36.560
Yeah.

12:36.560 --> 12:37.560
I'm sure they'll probably still call it.

12:37.560 --> 12:41.680
I'm like the M ones, the performance for things that I do like specifically as a software

12:41.680 --> 12:46.840
developer, like I only have one case where I care about GPUs and that's where I'm yelling

12:46.840 --> 12:51.520
at kids for not knowing what pointers do, which by the way, our rip van Winkle, or I

12:51.520 --> 12:55.400
think we actually, I recorded two episodes already, but then I had a little issue with

12:55.400 --> 12:56.400
the name.

12:56.400 --> 13:02.000
Hey, uh, speaking of streaming, I put, I'll put a link in the show notes to the USB 3.0,

13:02.000 --> 13:07.560
like $15 capture card that I'm using with Linux right now, 1699, they raised it, but

13:07.560 --> 13:10.400
people had emailed it and I should have totally put that in the show notes last week.

13:10.400 --> 13:11.400
So I will have that in there.

13:11.400 --> 13:12.400
Oh, that's awesome.

13:12.400 --> 13:13.400
Yeah.

13:13.400 --> 13:14.400
Yeah.

13:14.400 --> 13:15.400
Yeah.

13:15.400 --> 13:16.400
People were asking on Twitter too.

13:16.400 --> 13:17.400
Real time.

13:17.400 --> 13:20.360
Follow-up chat room tells us, uh, Nevin chat room and, uh, Neil in chat room say that the

13:20.360 --> 13:24.920
system 76 tools are in the build service and available on Sousa and that Sousa works

13:24.920 --> 13:27.640
great on the Thalia workstation.

13:27.640 --> 13:31.440
So no excuse now, Mike, get the four men.

13:31.440 --> 13:35.520
I listen when my, my four year old son, who's going to be five next month, you know what

13:35.520 --> 13:38.520
for his fifth year old, both three son, I didn't get you a cake.

13:38.520 --> 13:42.480
I didn't get you any kind of Avengers or Ironman doll or whatever.

13:42.480 --> 13:45.280
You get to install open Sousa on daddy's computer.

13:45.280 --> 13:46.540
What a gift.

13:46.540 --> 13:51.920
And he'll say, I want to live with mommy.

13:51.920 --> 13:56.040
Fair enough.

13:56.040 --> 13:57.860
Leno dot com slash coder.

13:57.860 --> 14:00.480
Go there to get a $100 60 day credit.

14:00.480 --> 14:02.200
And of course support the show.

14:02.200 --> 14:05.340
$100 for new accounts is a great deal.

14:05.340 --> 14:10.200
Not only is that just a ton of credit, which is super nice deal, but it's a really solid

14:10.200 --> 14:13.440
way to try out the stuff that we talk about with Linode all the time.

14:13.440 --> 14:18.000
Linode is how I host everything with JB 3.0 from our community stuff to just the tools

14:18.000 --> 14:19.000
that we use.

14:19.000 --> 14:23.340
And some systems are small little micro boxes that we've set up to do like real singular

14:23.340 --> 14:24.880
kind of tasks, one or two jobs.

14:24.880 --> 14:28.440
And some are larger boxes that run several applications at the same time.

14:28.440 --> 14:31.120
Linode has a wide range of systems you can choose from.

14:31.120 --> 14:35.880
And their pricing is 30 to 50 percent less than major cloud providers like AWS or Google.

14:35.880 --> 14:37.500
And they've been around forever.

14:37.500 --> 14:41.240
They started in 2003 as one of the first companies in this business.

14:41.240 --> 14:45.460
And they have honed that into a lean mean machine.

14:45.460 --> 14:49.900
What they have focused on, they have focused on well and done extremely well.

14:49.900 --> 14:55.680
Their cloud dashboard is clean, simple, clear, gives you good feedback, really approachable

14:55.680 --> 15:00.100
if you're new to all this stuff, but just a few clicks away from getting really advanced.

15:00.100 --> 15:02.360
If you're more familiar with some of these things.

15:02.360 --> 15:04.340
And Linode is fast.

15:04.340 --> 15:05.880
They have fast, fast networking.

15:05.880 --> 15:07.680
They have 11 data centers around the world.

15:07.680 --> 15:11.920
They have native SSD storage, 40 gigabit connections coming into the machines.

15:11.920 --> 15:14.720
It's really fast and it's stable too.

15:14.720 --> 15:18.080
And they have a bunch of features that make using Linode just a breeze.

15:18.080 --> 15:22.880
Their cloud manager makes it possible to manage a bunch of machines at once or just a single

15:22.880 --> 15:23.880
machine.

15:23.880 --> 15:28.480
They make it really easy to manage your backups, your snapshots or even move between data centers.

15:28.480 --> 15:32.740
We got an email in from the show from Listener Chris, not me, but Listener Chris, though

15:32.740 --> 15:34.520
I echo his sentiments.

15:34.520 --> 15:39.340
He said he used Linode initially just as a way to do code deployment testing.

15:39.340 --> 15:43.200
He had a Linode set up with a domain that he would deploy to and he'd send that out

15:43.200 --> 15:48.340
to clients or whoever was testing it and they could bang on it in a real world way and give

15:48.340 --> 15:49.340
him feedback.

15:49.340 --> 15:54.420
And he said, well, one day I was experimenting with it and we had the website on a quad core

15:54.420 --> 15:58.860
system, he said, and the Linode was a single core system, but the Linode test site was

15:58.860 --> 16:02.720
faster than the production website every single time in all of his tests.

16:02.720 --> 16:08.720
And so eventually the conversation, it came up, why is the test site faster than production?

16:08.720 --> 16:11.320
And so they migrated everything over to Linode.

16:11.320 --> 16:17.360
It's just a great story because we had a Listener Jeff who wrote in and did the same thing with

16:17.360 --> 16:19.860
his Nextcloud instance, very similar story.

16:19.860 --> 16:23.720
And both of them just had tons of great things to say about Linode support.

16:23.720 --> 16:24.720
And I hear that a lot.

16:24.720 --> 16:27.380
It's just beyond a level which you would expect.

16:27.380 --> 16:29.120
It's just really great support.

16:29.120 --> 16:32.520
But I love Linode because they've been supporting Linux and projects and events that I love

16:32.520 --> 16:34.520
for a really long time.

16:34.520 --> 16:39.440
And the reason why that pushes buttons is not only because of course I love Linux, but

16:39.440 --> 16:43.540
it means they have a passion about this technology.

16:43.540 --> 16:45.800
They're in it because they want to be.

16:45.800 --> 16:46.800
They love the technology.

16:46.800 --> 16:50.600
It's not because they just got a bunch of VC funding and decided they could go dominate

16:50.600 --> 16:52.240
a market.

16:52.240 --> 16:58.680
They started early just as a love for something that was now coming into the Linux kernel.

16:58.680 --> 17:01.320
Like this was back in user mode Linux days.

17:01.320 --> 17:06.680
And they grew that into one of the largest independently, they are the largest independently

17:06.680 --> 17:09.320
owned cloud provider.

17:09.320 --> 17:11.000
Think about that.

17:11.000 --> 17:12.720
They're even their own ISP now.

17:12.720 --> 17:13.720
Isn't that remarkable?

17:13.720 --> 17:15.920
They did that back in 2016.

17:15.920 --> 17:18.480
And Linode is dedicated to offering the best virtualized cloud computing.

17:18.480 --> 17:22.680
If it runs on Linux, it runs on Linode and it runs damn well.

17:22.680 --> 17:24.760
I can tell you that from personal experience.

17:24.760 --> 17:25.760
So go try it out.

17:25.760 --> 17:29.160
Put it to the test, linode.com slash coder.

17:29.160 --> 17:37.000
Go there, support the show and get that $100 credit, linode.com slash coder.

17:37.000 --> 17:38.760
You really screwed up that Linode ad.

17:38.760 --> 17:39.760
Oh yeah?

17:39.760 --> 17:42.040
You forgot to mention the greatest feature they have.

17:42.040 --> 17:43.040
Oh, what is it?

17:43.040 --> 17:44.040
OpenSUSE.

17:44.040 --> 17:45.040
That's right.

17:45.040 --> 17:46.040
It is on there.

17:46.040 --> 17:47.040
You're right.

17:47.040 --> 17:48.040
They got Arch on there too.

17:48.040 --> 17:49.040
Oh no.

17:49.040 --> 17:50.040
No.

17:50.040 --> 17:51.040
Don't say that.

17:51.040 --> 17:52.040
No one will subscribe.

17:52.040 --> 17:53.040
We're not going to make any money.

17:53.040 --> 17:54.040
What are you doing?

17:54.040 --> 17:55.040
I know.

17:55.040 --> 17:56.040
You're right.

17:56.040 --> 17:57.040
I shouldn't.

17:57.040 --> 17:58.040
I shouldn't say it.

17:58.040 --> 17:59.040
SUSE.

17:59.040 --> 18:00.040
It's what you want.

18:00.040 --> 18:01.040
Oh, I am really just, I am torn up about the HomePod thing.

18:01.040 --> 18:06.040
I know it sounds silly, but I really, I just spent a stupid amount of money.

18:06.040 --> 18:10.920
I wish Apple could just like chill and lower their prices by 15%.

18:10.920 --> 18:15.640
If I could keep the HomePod at $299, but then make it like part of a mesh wifi network system,

18:15.640 --> 18:16.640
that might be something.

18:16.640 --> 18:17.640
Oh God.

18:17.640 --> 18:18.640
No.

18:18.640 --> 18:19.640
No, it wouldn't.

18:19.640 --> 18:20.640
All right.

18:20.640 --> 18:25.400
Well, there's other things to talk about, but before we get to some of the things we

18:25.400 --> 18:29.480
should probably talk about, some of the emails we should probably get to, I wanted to talk

18:29.480 --> 18:33.880
about this article, or it was a study, but then there was an article published about

18:33.880 --> 18:34.880
it.

18:34.880 --> 18:38.180
It was research that was done in the UK that shows that the average, and I'm sure this

18:38.180 --> 18:44.240
is true for American workers too, the average UK office worker is only productive for two

18:44.240 --> 18:46.960
hours and 53 minutes out of a workday.

18:46.960 --> 18:49.600
It seems like a wild overestimation, but keep going.

18:49.600 --> 18:50.600
You think?

18:50.600 --> 18:58.040
They say with social media, going through news websites, YouTube and whatnot, that generally

18:58.040 --> 19:02.160
when you condense the amount of time people are actually working, it's just under three

19:02.160 --> 19:03.160
hours.

19:03.160 --> 19:09.240
They polled around 2000 UK office workers all over the age of 18 and they asked them

19:09.240 --> 19:12.840
a series of questions and depending on how they kind of came at it, like this is the

19:12.840 --> 19:13.840
question they asked them.

19:13.840 --> 19:18.120
If you had to state a figure, how long do you think you spend productively working during

19:18.120 --> 19:20.560
work hours on a daily basis?

19:20.560 --> 19:24.640
With that question and other questions that started to derive this information, and you

19:24.640 --> 19:26.760
think it could be actually less than that?

19:26.760 --> 19:27.760
I think it's less.

19:27.760 --> 19:28.760
Yeah.

19:28.760 --> 19:32.180
I think I'll tell you what a big part of it is, because I do not dispute this either,

19:32.180 --> 19:37.760
and I think two hours, they say almost three hours, two hours, 53 minutes, I bet it's more

19:37.760 --> 19:38.760
closer to two hours.

19:38.760 --> 19:45.560
And I think a big part of it is the white space between meetings, like what do you do

19:45.560 --> 19:46.560
with that time?

19:46.560 --> 19:50.560
You read your email, you browse Facebook, you watch YouTube.

19:50.560 --> 19:57.000
So I will say one thing in, I guess, a more positive direction that once childcare comes

19:57.000 --> 20:01.080
back for the majority of the country and I'm speaking to our US audience, I know in Europe

20:01.080 --> 20:04.440
you guys have got this sorted, mostly from what I hear.

20:04.440 --> 20:09.520
I can tell you as a dad with a kid at home, there's a reason we do the show at eight o'clock

20:09.520 --> 20:10.520
at night now.

20:10.520 --> 20:11.520
Right?

20:11.520 --> 20:12.520
Yeah.

20:12.520 --> 20:17.100
Because, I mean, you know this Chris, we had this conversation privately, absolutely no

20:17.100 --> 20:20.880
way I can do the show at three o'clock in the afternoon anymore because of the work

20:20.880 --> 20:22.720
from home nature of things.

20:22.720 --> 20:27.960
But as childcare and schooling and aftercare comes back, I'm sort of optimistic.

20:27.960 --> 20:35.120
I think in 2023, and yes, I mean, two years from now, productivity is going to go rapidly

20:35.120 --> 20:38.800
up because you know what, when you can design your own workspace, I mean, Chris, I wish

20:38.800 --> 20:43.680
this was a video show for the first time in the 4,000 years we've been doing it.

20:43.680 --> 20:50.480
Because I have the Coder 300 poster behind me, no disrespect to the 400, but as a gift

20:50.480 --> 20:54.760
it was framed for me and it's like the backdrop I do for meetings.

20:54.760 --> 21:00.960
And I set up my own little side bedroom in my house as the ideal workspace.

21:00.960 --> 21:06.800
I have a kitchen, obviously it's my house, I have private bathrooms, I can take my lemur

21:06.800 --> 21:08.880
out and work in the yard.

21:08.880 --> 21:14.760
Other than not having childcare because of COVID, and maybe I'm going to be wrong, but

21:14.760 --> 21:20.600
we'll tell this in a year because people can listen back to my Swift episode, very wrong.

21:20.600 --> 21:26.680
I think, and mark me on this, I think next year or the following year, this work from

21:26.680 --> 21:30.800
home trend for software developers in particular will be a net positive.

21:30.800 --> 21:36.480
Because think about it, Microsoft, when it was founded, every developer basically had

21:36.480 --> 21:41.240
either one office mate or by themselves.

21:41.240 --> 21:45.040
So in a work from home situation, aren't we all just working basically by ourselves or

21:45.040 --> 21:49.000
with a partner or a spouse, you know, who shares the space with us?

21:49.000 --> 21:52.120
I mean, I got to tell you, I've written more code.

21:52.120 --> 21:57.800
I mean, child interruptions, yes, are a thing for me, but I have written more code in the

21:57.800 --> 22:03.040
last 10 months since I've been single, divorced.

22:03.040 --> 22:06.000
This is the way to work, you know, not in the office.

22:06.000 --> 22:11.360
If I could push an easy button and have it any way I want, it'd be a mix like this, what

22:11.360 --> 22:17.120
I'm doing right now is better in the studio, but like all of the administrative stuff,

22:17.120 --> 22:23.400
the emails, the sponsor calls, like the planning, I do that better from home.

22:23.400 --> 22:28.720
It's just, you know, fancy me, but for me, it's better to have two different spaces to

22:28.720 --> 22:34.180
work and I just do different work in each space, but I think there is a challenge for

22:34.180 --> 22:41.000
some people that are working at home to not get distracted because you've got, you know,

22:41.000 --> 22:44.400
maybe multiple monitors, maybe more monitors than you have at work and you got your chats

22:44.400 --> 22:48.760
up on some of those screens and you got a browser with YouTube up, I mean, I'm just

22:48.760 --> 22:50.560
describing myself, but right.

22:50.560 --> 22:51.560
You have adium up.

22:51.560 --> 22:52.560
Yeah, of course.

22:52.560 --> 22:53.560
Right.

22:53.560 --> 22:54.560
Of course.

22:54.560 --> 23:00.440
Somehow still getting it to run and you don't have, hey, that snow leopard container is

23:00.440 --> 23:01.440
going strong.

23:01.440 --> 23:02.440
That should be a thing.

23:02.440 --> 23:04.360
I'm just saying I might make it a thing.

23:04.360 --> 23:11.240
Don't tempt me so I could see it and then honestly I can't tell you how many times I've

23:11.240 --> 23:16.720
been in a meeting where a developer is just basically listening to a bunch of other people

23:16.720 --> 23:22.480
talk and I don't mean any disrespect because I have so much respect for people who have

23:22.480 --> 23:26.860
design talent, but I have been in a lot of meetings where a designer will be going on

23:26.860 --> 23:32.580
for a long time, um, or like a, like a, the planning person will be going on for a long

23:32.580 --> 23:37.420
time or somebody who's kind of not really related to the rest of the work.

23:37.420 --> 23:43.920
There's so many times where somebody will dominate several people's time and you then

23:43.920 --> 23:48.080
shut you, you leave that meeting and you've got another one in an hour or an hour and

23:48.080 --> 23:51.080
a half and it's not like you're going to, you're not, you know, you're not going to

23:51.080 --> 23:55.360
get in the flow between those two meetings because not only are you thinking about that

23:55.360 --> 23:59.120
upcoming meeting, which kind of screws with the flow, but you don't necessarily have enough

23:59.120 --> 24:02.640
time cause you got to unwind from the meeting you were just in and then got to get a transition

24:02.640 --> 24:10.420
and there's just like this kind of debt that all of these meetings, even if it's say two

24:10.420 --> 24:17.020
or three a day, but it's often more and how, and so many of them just seem like an inappropriate

24:17.020 --> 24:20.700
use of talented people's time.

24:20.700 --> 24:25.160
And I'm not trying, I'm not trying to be cliche about this because I honestly, this is just

24:25.160 --> 24:29.760
something I I've experienced myself and formed this opinion over time based on having many

24:29.760 --> 24:37.480
clients and jobs now that I have experienced this and it leads to this sort of baseline

24:37.480 --> 24:41.400
reduction in productivity because you get very little accomplished in the meetings that

24:41.400 --> 24:44.120
couldn't have been accomplished via an email thread.

24:44.120 --> 24:48.800
You get this white space between the meetings that prevents you from getting flow time so

24:48.800 --> 24:52.620
you don't get anything super productive done and what you end up doing is having to cram

24:52.620 --> 24:57.000
your flow time into these small little chunks of time throughout your week that are sometimes

24:57.000 --> 25:01.440
at crazy hours because that's the only time people aren't around and it feels like you

25:01.440 --> 25:07.360
end up doing a bunch of work that isn't actually the work of your main job and I don't know

25:07.360 --> 25:11.960
if you've ever, you probably haven't, you probably have never worked anywhere that uses

25:11.960 --> 25:17.200
the OKR system which is a system that Google and Intel came up with figuring out.

25:17.200 --> 25:18.200
Nope.

25:18.200 --> 25:19.200
Yeah.

25:19.200 --> 25:22.720
So OKRs are a lot of fun, it's a great way for, the idea is kind of actually pretty solid.

25:22.720 --> 25:28.760
It's an idea for an entire company to come up with objectives and key results that everybody

25:28.760 --> 25:29.760
is striving towards.

25:29.760 --> 25:33.040
The idea that everybody is sort of rowing in the same direction all the way down the

25:33.040 --> 25:35.160
chain and people get key results.

25:35.160 --> 25:36.320
Sorry, is this hell?

25:36.320 --> 25:37.520
Yeah, I know.

25:37.520 --> 25:42.200
And the problem with institutions, and I've been at several of them that implement OKRs,

25:42.200 --> 25:49.280
is the OKRs become an entire job in themselves, managing everybody's objectives and key results,

25:49.280 --> 25:53.600
going through and checking in on everybody's key results, auditing it, and then they get

25:53.600 --> 25:59.560
incorporated into reviews and you end up with an entire job that is just managing the process

25:59.560 --> 26:01.520
of doing your job.

26:01.520 --> 26:05.180
And they may not, sometimes it's OKRs for other people, it's not OKRs, it's something

26:05.180 --> 26:10.100
else for other shops, but it creates all of this wasted time.

26:10.100 --> 26:16.360
So when I see only two hours, really two to three hours of productive time from UK office

26:16.360 --> 26:21.160
workers, I think that contributes significantly to it because the people in that survey did

26:21.160 --> 26:24.400
not consider that stuff productive uses of their time.

26:24.400 --> 26:28.560
And you combine that then with just general procrastination, you know, needing to go to

26:28.560 --> 26:33.460
the doctor or something's interesting happening in the news that has everybody's attention,

26:33.460 --> 26:39.100
and it's a phenomenal, unbelievable amount of money, because that's where it all comes

26:39.100 --> 26:45.920
back to, it's a phenomenal amount of money that corporations are burning in people time.

26:45.920 --> 26:47.840
In Zoom calls and whatnot.

26:47.840 --> 26:48.840
It's amazing.

26:48.840 --> 26:50.640
And you see it in morale.

26:50.640 --> 26:56.600
Oh, well, OK, yeah, at some level, isn't that just the business serving the process rather

26:56.600 --> 26:58.560
than the process serving the business?

26:58.560 --> 27:02.200
I think that and I think that's what contributes to this quite a bit is it becomes a lot about

27:02.200 --> 27:03.200
the process.

27:03.200 --> 27:04.920
Yeah, oh, you can tell it gets me fired up.

27:04.920 --> 27:05.920
I mean, I feel sick.

27:05.920 --> 27:08.200
I'm honestly nauseous right now.

27:08.200 --> 27:11.400
I've been told by clients, oh, yeah, we're not like that.

27:11.400 --> 27:14.080
And then I get into these meetings and I it's a balance.

27:14.080 --> 27:17.080
I don't want to come across as like I'm against all this stuff because I've seen it done right

27:17.080 --> 27:18.080
too.

27:18.080 --> 27:23.360
But I tell you what, I could use a little more of that structure around here, though

27:23.360 --> 27:26.160
the robe is moving along the international.

27:26.160 --> 27:30.200
So it turns out, oh, Jesus Christ, we can't even go a week.

27:30.200 --> 27:31.880
People want to know they want a robe update.

27:31.880 --> 27:35.800
The thing is, like now they want their robes and they're on their way.

27:35.800 --> 27:39.120
I think probably by next week you will have a pretty big update.

27:39.120 --> 27:40.960
Here's something I learned in this process.

27:40.960 --> 27:42.400
Lord take me, please.

27:42.400 --> 27:46.000
There's like a couple of countries we just straight up can't ship to.

27:46.000 --> 27:48.680
So there was like a handful of people we just couldn't ship to Iran.

27:48.680 --> 27:49.680
Yeah, Iran was one.

27:49.680 --> 27:53.620
It wasn't a lot of them, but we have listeners everywhere.

27:53.620 --> 27:54.620
It's awesome.

27:54.620 --> 27:55.660
We have listeners in countries.

27:55.660 --> 27:57.480
It's literally illegal for us to ship to.

27:57.480 --> 27:58.480
How cool is that?

27:58.480 --> 27:59.480
Did you know we have Iranian?

27:59.480 --> 28:02.040
I mentioned Iran for a reason.

28:02.040 --> 28:04.120
We have Iranian followers on social media.

28:04.120 --> 28:05.120
Yeah.

28:05.120 --> 28:06.120
How great is that?

28:06.120 --> 28:07.120
I think it's pretty cool.

28:07.120 --> 28:10.520
Maybe it could be U.S. U.S. citizens living there or it could be people trying to learn

28:10.520 --> 28:12.560
English or people interested in the technology stack.

28:12.560 --> 28:14.040
Either way, I just think it's great.

28:14.040 --> 28:15.040
Yeah.

28:15.040 --> 28:16.040
I think it's great.

28:16.040 --> 28:17.040
I wish we could send them a robe.

28:17.040 --> 28:19.760
But we can't ship a robe there, unfortunately.

28:19.760 --> 28:20.760
Without going to jail.

28:20.760 --> 28:21.760
Yeah.

28:21.760 --> 28:27.280
Also, a lot of countries' customs won't allow an item to come in without a phone number

28:27.280 --> 28:29.120
on there.

28:29.120 --> 28:34.320
So some of you are going to get my personal phone number as an Easter egg on here.

28:34.320 --> 28:37.120
Please, for the love of God, send it to me.

28:37.120 --> 28:41.640
I have a Twilio app ready to text them Jar Jar Giffies.

28:41.640 --> 28:46.340
So just to give you, like, just here's an insight into all of the little background

28:46.340 --> 28:48.060
gymnastics happening.

28:48.060 --> 28:52.480
The compromise ended up being I put my personal phone number as the shipping phone number

28:52.480 --> 28:53.880
to get these through customs.

28:53.880 --> 28:57.400
Can you imagine the levels of conversations and amount of conversations we had to have

28:57.400 --> 28:59.360
for that to be the final solution?

28:59.360 --> 29:00.360
Yeah.

29:00.360 --> 29:01.360
It's been a process.

29:01.360 --> 29:03.920
I feel like someone told you robes were a bad idea.

29:03.920 --> 29:04.920
I don't know.

29:04.920 --> 29:07.760
I feel like at some point.

29:07.760 --> 29:08.760
But go ahead and call me.

29:08.760 --> 29:09.760
You know what?

29:09.760 --> 29:12.240
If you got a robe and my phone number's on your shipping information, I'll take it.

29:12.240 --> 29:14.120
Can I have your personal phone number?

29:14.120 --> 29:15.400
You probably have it somewhere.

29:15.400 --> 29:18.280
I'm sure I do, but who knows if I remember, right?

29:18.280 --> 29:20.960
The truth of the matter is if you really want to get a hold of me, it's probably not by

29:20.960 --> 29:22.160
the phone.

29:22.160 --> 29:25.160
But I'll give you any number, baby.

29:25.160 --> 29:29.880
So anyway, so the robes probably soon, probably have a bigger update for the robes soon.

29:29.880 --> 29:36.920
I feel like actually legitimately learn something and I still feel like I got I got enough figured

29:36.920 --> 29:38.480
out for like the next item.

29:38.480 --> 29:42.400
So the next item I want to do, you know, besides like the standard stuff for the show is like

29:42.400 --> 29:45.760
I want to do like some point something that maybe has multiple sizes or something.

29:45.760 --> 29:48.920
So I can figure that that out like a like a quarter radio tuxedo.

29:48.920 --> 29:50.040
Is that what we're looking at?

29:50.040 --> 29:52.480
French coat or no, not no trench coats.

29:52.480 --> 29:53.480
Columbine.

29:53.480 --> 29:54.480
Right.

29:54.480 --> 29:55.480
Right.

29:55.480 --> 29:56.480
That killed the trench coat, didn't it?

29:56.480 --> 29:57.480
Kill the trench coat.

29:57.480 --> 29:59.920
I think I think both you and I would look good in a trench coat.

29:59.920 --> 30:00.920
I think we're trench coat.

30:00.920 --> 30:01.920
Yeah.

30:01.920 --> 30:04.320
Well, you know, we're sort of plump, jaunty fellows.

30:04.320 --> 30:05.320
Yeah.

30:05.320 --> 30:06.320
Yeah.

30:06.320 --> 30:07.640
As you get past 30, I think you qualify for a trench coat.

30:07.640 --> 30:08.640
I mean, right.

30:08.640 --> 30:10.720
So like in high school trench coat.

30:10.720 --> 30:11.720
Not awesome.

30:11.720 --> 30:13.240
The guidance counselor wants to talk to you.

30:13.240 --> 30:14.240
Yes, totally.

30:14.240 --> 30:17.440
When you're like 30, mid 30s or in your case, 40s.

30:17.440 --> 30:18.440
Right.

30:18.440 --> 30:19.440
Yeah.

30:19.440 --> 30:20.440
And it rains here.

30:20.440 --> 30:21.440
Well, not not almost 40s, but not yet.

30:21.440 --> 30:22.440
Oh, OK.

30:22.440 --> 30:26.760
I thought I thought you were within striking distance.

30:26.760 --> 30:29.840
Let's just say the next birthday, I'm not going to be celebrating much.

30:29.840 --> 30:30.840
I see.

30:30.840 --> 30:31.880
OK, well, moving on.

30:31.880 --> 30:32.880
It's close.

30:32.880 --> 30:33.880
Yeah.

30:33.880 --> 30:34.880
So about adium.

30:34.880 --> 30:35.880
It's fantastic.

30:35.880 --> 30:38.680
And I might actually contribute to open source.

30:38.680 --> 30:42.880
And when I say contribute, I mean, do what every good open source contributor does, fork

30:42.880 --> 30:46.960
it, ignore the maintainers and run my own version.

30:46.960 --> 30:48.320
You need to get like an M1 version.

30:48.320 --> 30:49.600
No, it works on the M1.

30:49.600 --> 30:51.560
Yeah, but probably under Rosetta, right?

30:51.560 --> 30:52.560
Yeah.

30:52.560 --> 30:53.560
But that's not even the problem.

30:53.560 --> 30:59.600
It doesn't scroll up when I get a new message because they changed the API for scrolling

30:59.600 --> 31:02.680
of you like two years ago.

31:02.680 --> 31:06.800
And adium was like, man, you ever listen to yourself and just think, man, I'm really just

31:06.800 --> 31:07.800
the perfect Windows user.

31:07.800 --> 31:10.480
Have you ever because that's such a Windows thing.

31:10.480 --> 31:12.580
What you want is you want apps that run for a decade.

31:12.580 --> 31:14.200
That's Windows, man.

31:14.200 --> 31:15.200
Or Solaris.

31:15.200 --> 31:17.920
Oh, hang on.

31:17.920 --> 31:19.280
Hang on.

31:19.280 --> 31:21.080
I have my seltzer here.

31:21.080 --> 31:23.520
Yeah, and no, it's not an alcoholic seltzer.

31:23.520 --> 31:26.240
It's a sad Publix brand seltzer.

31:26.240 --> 31:29.320
I tried a hard seltzer for the first time yesterday.

31:29.320 --> 31:30.320
Just a sampler.

31:30.320 --> 31:31.320
It's like candy.

31:31.320 --> 31:32.320
Did you like it?

31:32.320 --> 31:33.320
Well, it was just a just a sampler.

31:33.320 --> 31:34.320
No, I didn't.

31:34.320 --> 31:35.320
I didn't end up ordering it.

31:35.320 --> 31:36.320
But I actually thought I don't know.

31:36.320 --> 31:39.120
I mean, it felt like it was probably healthier for me than a beer.

31:39.120 --> 31:40.680
But I ended up getting a cider.

31:40.680 --> 31:44.320
I just like to go for gin and like send you messages at night.

31:44.320 --> 31:48.600
Yeah, I think that's probably a healthier route to go than a few beers for, you know,

31:48.600 --> 31:49.600
you look for the efficiency.

31:49.600 --> 31:53.400
I think the bread, the calorie count in beer is higher.

31:53.400 --> 31:58.920
But seriously, why wouldn't I just patch adium instead of like, I don't know, changing?

31:58.920 --> 31:59.920
I don't want to change.

31:59.920 --> 32:01.960
Are they up on, I know it's open source.

32:01.960 --> 32:04.000
I don't know if they're up on GitHub.

32:04.000 --> 32:05.000
Source Forge, baby.

32:05.000 --> 32:06.000
Source.

32:06.000 --> 32:11.400
It was last time I looked, but that might be unfair to them.

32:11.400 --> 32:13.600
Datadog.com slash coder radio.

32:13.600 --> 32:17.640
Analyze code level performance across your environment and troubleshoot issues faster

32:17.640 --> 32:18.640
than ever.

32:18.640 --> 32:19.880
This is what Datadog does.

32:19.880 --> 32:23.440
It gives you visualizations and the ability to solve problems.

32:23.440 --> 32:25.320
And these dashboards are gorgeous.

32:25.320 --> 32:28.800
Go to datadog.com slash coder radio just to see what I'm talking about.

32:28.800 --> 32:32.120
I think what's great is Datadog's continuous profiler.

32:32.120 --> 32:36.400
It automatically collects profiles from your production servers all the time.

32:36.400 --> 32:40.460
So then you can go back and analyze your data quickly with minimal overhead right when you

32:40.460 --> 32:41.460
need it.

32:41.460 --> 32:45.300
You get a unified picture of your environment by correlating code performance metrics with

32:45.300 --> 32:49.500
your server metrics from the low level server to containers and applications all the way

32:49.500 --> 32:51.800
up with real time dashboards.

32:51.800 --> 32:55.840
And with lots of nice quick integrations that get you up and running with different stacks

32:55.840 --> 33:00.000
immediately, things like tracing and log management and of course that continuous profile, you

33:00.000 --> 33:02.520
bring it all into one platform.

33:02.520 --> 33:06.720
You're seeing the beauty of this when you can pull data from different sources, visualize

33:06.720 --> 33:08.580
it immediately.

33:08.580 --> 33:12.340
Datadog enables you to pinpoint the root cause of issues faster than ever and communicate

33:12.340 --> 33:13.720
that with your team.

33:13.720 --> 33:15.060
So go try it for free.

33:15.060 --> 33:18.620
They got a 14 day trial and you can support the show when you do it.

33:18.620 --> 33:21.800
So go to datadog.com slash coder radio.

33:21.800 --> 33:22.960
You go there for a limited time.

33:22.960 --> 33:26.840
If you start a free trial and you create a dashboard, you'll get a free t-shirt and I'll

33:26.840 --> 33:30.200
tell you what, it's been a little while since I've gotten a free swag item.

33:30.200 --> 33:35.080
That sounds kind of fun and you get to see how gorgeous and easy to roll out these dashboards

33:35.080 --> 33:36.080
are.

33:36.080 --> 33:39.200
So go try it out right now, datadog.com slash coder radio.

33:39.200 --> 33:43.140
Thanks to everybody who supports the show by going to datadog.com slash coder radio

33:43.140 --> 33:46.320
and thanks to Datadog for sponsoring the Coder Radio program.

33:46.320 --> 33:49.980
Well, you feel like solving some problems?

33:49.980 --> 33:56.160
We have an email that perhaps we could lend our wisdom towards, sort of point it like

33:56.160 --> 33:57.160
a superhero ray.

33:57.160 --> 33:58.840
Sure, why not?

33:58.840 --> 34:04.920
Justin writes in, he says, he says, I love SUSE and I want Linux Action News to do more

34:04.920 --> 34:09.640
SUSE content and Linux Unplugged to have all the SUSE developers on.

34:09.640 --> 34:11.960
Justin, you're correct.

34:11.960 --> 34:12.960
End of email.

34:12.960 --> 34:13.960
Got it, Chris.

34:13.960 --> 34:15.360
I took care of it while you had your drink.

34:15.360 --> 34:18.200
All right, moving on.

34:18.200 --> 34:22.020
Actually he says he is excited about Coder Bytes or Coder Tails now.

34:22.020 --> 34:26.360
Well let's wait for the US trademark office before he does anything else stupid.

34:26.360 --> 34:30.160
So he says, I think he's got kids, I think he's going to have them watch some of it.

34:30.160 --> 34:34.680
But he says what he wanted to write in about was the Snake in the Room episode 393.

34:34.680 --> 34:40.280
He said, I think the business rationale that Mike laid out to move to Python is totally

34:40.280 --> 34:41.280
agreeable.

34:41.280 --> 34:42.280
It makes a lot of sense.

34:42.280 --> 34:47.360
I went to university and I've been migrating legacy bash, TCL, Perl, Python 2 ticketing

34:47.360 --> 34:52.640
systems built on top of a flat file database from a Unix mail handler to a proper database

34:52.640 --> 34:58.000
driven system with a Python 3 API and React JS front end, as well as all brand new shiny

34:58.000 --> 34:59.480
command line interfaces.

34:59.480 --> 35:02.640
I have to say, Python makes this buttery smooth.

35:02.640 --> 35:06.520
In comparison to the old system, it makes it smooth.

35:06.520 --> 35:11.880
And that helps soften the edge for adoption and all of this runs on CentOS 6 where I have

35:11.880 --> 35:15.240
issues running debugging tools because it's so old.

35:15.240 --> 35:18.920
Anyways, he says he completely agrees with me on Plasma.

35:18.920 --> 35:22.600
He thinks it's currently the superior desktop environment compared to GNOME on technical

35:22.600 --> 35:23.600
merits.

35:23.600 --> 35:28.280
However, and he's absolutely right here, Justin says that GNOME has the backing of major companies

35:28.280 --> 35:31.760
like Red Hat, Canonical, System76 and more.

35:31.760 --> 35:34.620
He thinks it's a Betamax versus VHS fight.

35:34.620 --> 35:37.160
And I think he's implying that Plasma is Betamax.

35:37.160 --> 35:42.580
He says there's other great projects like elementary OSes, Pantheon or Mate or even XFCE.

35:42.580 --> 35:45.960
But the reality is that really the backing is behind GNOME.

35:45.960 --> 35:46.960
And he's right.

35:46.960 --> 35:47.960
It's been on my mind recently.

35:47.960 --> 35:49.740
But he has a question for us.

35:49.740 --> 35:55.640
As a visually impaired UX software developer or tech humanizer, as I like to call it, he

35:55.640 --> 36:01.400
says, who uses a hackintosh, he says, yes, I hope it's running Snow Leopard, maybe I

36:01.400 --> 36:06.480
need to move away from Mac OS before my Intel rig is totally unsupported.

36:06.480 --> 36:10.360
I want to move to some Linux distribution, but no desktop or distro has everything I

36:10.360 --> 36:12.360
need to do my job.

36:12.360 --> 36:16.220
This is in part because of accessibility software like a screen magnifier that works the way

36:16.220 --> 36:17.920
visually impaired person can use it.

36:17.920 --> 36:23.560
But more importantly, buying of business applications like a real desktop mail program, a real desktop

36:23.560 --> 36:28.360
calendar, and a single well-developed theme that doesn't bork between toolkits or glitch

36:28.360 --> 36:31.240
when I use a magnifier would be great.

36:31.240 --> 36:33.560
I recognize this as a community effort.

36:33.560 --> 36:36.840
And if I want these changes, I got to work on them myself, but I don't even know where

36:36.840 --> 36:37.920
to start.

36:37.920 --> 36:41.720
If you were 20 again, but today and you wanted to contribute features you needed to use a

36:41.720 --> 36:44.080
platform, what platform would you pick?

36:44.080 --> 36:45.720
And how would you get started?

36:45.720 --> 36:47.360
You better answer first.

36:47.360 --> 36:49.680
Wow, that's a huge question.

36:49.680 --> 36:54.680
And part of me kind of went like, well, maybe, I mean, maybe is it worth considering Mac

36:54.680 --> 36:55.680
OS?

36:55.680 --> 36:56.680
That's what I was gonna say.

36:56.680 --> 36:57.680
Just buy a MacBook Air and be done.

36:57.680 --> 36:59.240
You know, and they have great accessibility features.

36:59.240 --> 37:00.480
But then I got what he's saying.

37:00.480 --> 37:08.040
He's like, but Justin's in a position where he could develop software, he could contribute

37:08.040 --> 37:11.560
to this area, he's willing to do it.

37:11.560 --> 37:14.960
And he's young enough that he has the time to burn.

37:14.960 --> 37:18.400
That is actually like talk about like the sweet spot, right?

37:18.400 --> 37:22.400
Like, if anybody was actually going to make a positive contribution to a free desktop

37:22.400 --> 37:26.920
to improve its accessibility, it sounds like somebody that's exactly in his position.

37:26.920 --> 37:31.040
You know, I love the system 76 folks, but I would actually say hook up elementary.

37:31.040 --> 37:36.280
I think I think Cass, I mean, I can't speak for people, but I think that they would be

37:36.280 --> 37:38.480
open to any contributions for this.

37:38.480 --> 37:40.320
Yeah, you could definitely start there.

37:40.320 --> 37:44.900
I wonder if I wonder if it also be worth considering going further upstream to somebody like the

37:44.900 --> 37:49.240
GNOME project because Justin makes the point in here that GNOME has like some of the major

37:49.240 --> 37:50.240
backing.

37:50.240 --> 37:51.240
Well, true.

37:51.240 --> 37:52.240
That would make sense.

37:52.240 --> 37:55.960
Yeah, maybe somebody you got to you got to figure to like this almost feels like in the

37:55.960 --> 37:56.960
right timing.

37:56.960 --> 38:00.080
This could be a good Google summer of code sponsored project to contribute.

38:00.080 --> 38:01.080
No, you're right.

38:01.080 --> 38:02.080
It should be like GNOME.

38:02.080 --> 38:03.080
Really?

38:03.080 --> 38:06.680
It should be higher, higher up the stack than than a pantheon.

38:06.680 --> 38:11.320
Get into GTK and then the distros downstream can take advantage of it may just adopt it

38:11.320 --> 38:12.320
by default.

38:12.320 --> 38:15.080
Yeah, you know, I mean, like Google, this seems like something Google would sponsor

38:15.080 --> 38:18.480
like as a summer of code event like there are there's got to be people out there.

38:18.480 --> 38:21.000
You mean alphabet, right?

38:21.000 --> 38:22.000
It's a great idea.

38:22.000 --> 38:23.000
I love this idea.

38:23.000 --> 38:26.800
I mean, I tell you what, don't do this on the air because get you in trouble.

38:26.800 --> 38:27.800
But let's do it.

38:27.800 --> 38:30.080
Anyway, write something for accessibility.

38:30.080 --> 38:31.080
That's not easy.

38:31.080 --> 38:33.760
So email me, email me, man.

38:33.760 --> 38:35.360
And there's a Thalia in it for you.

38:35.360 --> 38:36.360
Wow.

38:36.360 --> 38:38.720
But it's got to be completely free software.

38:38.720 --> 38:41.680
It's got to go either to GNOME or a similar organization.

38:41.680 --> 38:47.320
It can be so long as it's like GPL or the hippies will tell me what's real free software.

38:47.320 --> 38:52.920
Yeah, but it can't be like BSD, I guess, I guess BSD is BSD free.

38:52.920 --> 38:55.880
Wouldn't it be something or contribute, you know, look at see what about contributing

38:55.880 --> 38:57.560
to an existing project that's out there.

38:57.560 --> 38:58.680
But yeah, that's what I'm saying.

38:58.680 --> 39:02.640
Like like fix text rendering in, you know, I don't know.

39:02.640 --> 39:03.640
Yeah.

39:03.640 --> 39:06.240
You know, you mentioned there was that problem with themes when you when you zoom in.

39:06.240 --> 39:09.440
And is that is that the problem of an application or so?

39:09.440 --> 39:10.440
That's it.

39:10.440 --> 39:11.440
Fix the theme thing.

39:11.440 --> 39:12.440
There's a Thalia in it for you.

39:12.440 --> 39:13.440
Wow.

39:13.440 --> 39:14.440
On the Mad Botter Inc.

39:14.440 --> 39:15.440
That'd be pretty great.

39:15.440 --> 39:18.760
And, you know, it's a good charitable thing to have because there's it just would benefit

39:18.760 --> 39:20.240
so many more people to Justin.

39:20.240 --> 39:24.000
So if you are one of those rare people in that position, if you've got the time, the

39:24.000 --> 39:31.000
will, the interest and the empathy of the situation, man, that's pretty pretty amazing.

39:31.000 --> 39:32.000
Really.

39:32.000 --> 39:33.200
I think it's pretty great.

39:33.200 --> 39:34.200
Just real fast.

39:34.200 --> 39:35.680
I have to say this for the state of California.

39:35.680 --> 39:36.680
This is not a lottery.

39:36.680 --> 39:37.680
All right.

39:37.680 --> 39:38.680
Right.

39:38.680 --> 39:39.680
Yes.

39:39.680 --> 39:40.680
I got in trouble last Earth Day.

39:40.680 --> 39:41.680
I had a little fun.

39:41.680 --> 39:42.680
Not a lottery.

39:42.680 --> 39:48.420
How classic, Mike, is it that you got in trouble with something to do with California?

39:48.420 --> 39:49.600
Like that's that's classic.

39:49.600 --> 39:54.000
I continue to get in legal trouble in the state of California where I have only been

39:54.000 --> 39:57.320
like four times, like for a week at a time.

39:57.320 --> 39:59.000
But I stay out of here.

39:59.000 --> 40:00.000
That's what they're saying to you.

40:00.000 --> 40:02.720
We don't like your kind son.

40:02.720 --> 40:03.720
Man oh man.

40:03.720 --> 40:04.720
Yeah.

40:04.720 --> 40:05.720
But I'm not joking.

40:05.720 --> 40:06.720
Seriously.

40:06.720 --> 40:09.840
If you do that, there's a Thalia in it for you.

40:09.840 --> 40:12.200
Shameless marketing on my side because that's who I am.

40:12.200 --> 40:14.080
Chris taught me, you know, he's old.

40:14.080 --> 40:16.320
He's like 47 now.

40:16.320 --> 40:17.320
Feels like it.

40:17.320 --> 40:18.320
I'm a young 33.

40:18.320 --> 40:21.640
Yeah, so I'm actually kind of worried that sometimes it feels like I am.

40:21.640 --> 40:27.200
I'm like, geez, if it gets much worse than this, I really thought you were in your 50s.

40:27.200 --> 40:29.720
I'm totally joking.

40:29.720 --> 40:31.360
Sometimes I feel like it.

40:31.360 --> 40:33.880
Sometimes I feel like I'm the Commodore 64.

40:33.880 --> 40:34.880
I do that.

40:34.880 --> 40:37.800
I do the kid math, you know, because I got three of the stinkers and my youngest is seven.

40:37.800 --> 40:42.000
So I'll do the kid math sometimes and OK, so I'm going to be I'll be this old.

40:42.000 --> 40:43.000
I'll be OK.

40:43.000 --> 40:44.000
OK, so I got it.

40:44.000 --> 40:45.200
I got to start treating myself better.

40:45.200 --> 40:48.360
That way I have the energy to keep going when I'm in my 50s and I'm kid free.

40:48.360 --> 40:54.800
I have been drinking this crazy, crazy ass vegetable juice, vegetable fruit elderberry

40:54.800 --> 40:55.800
smoothie.

40:55.800 --> 40:56.800
Oh, yeah.

40:56.800 --> 40:59.120
I've heard good things about elderberries changed my life.

40:59.120 --> 41:00.120
Really?

41:00.120 --> 41:02.880
I start my day with the taste of ass in my mouth.

41:02.880 --> 41:05.080
Oh, it's not good tasting elderberries.

41:05.080 --> 41:06.080
Yeah.

41:06.080 --> 41:07.080
Yeah.

41:07.080 --> 41:08.080
What's it called?

41:08.080 --> 41:09.080
Matt's.

41:09.080 --> 41:10.080
It's actually called Matt's.

41:10.080 --> 41:11.080
Oh, my God.

41:11.080 --> 41:14.840
I wish I could go to my fridge, but everything would fall off my desk if I got up.

41:14.840 --> 41:17.080
Matt's super juice.

41:17.080 --> 41:18.200
Super immune juice.

41:18.200 --> 41:20.440
See, Uncle Matt's elderberry juice.

41:20.440 --> 41:21.480
That's something else, huh?

41:21.480 --> 41:22.480
Not Uncle Matt.

41:22.480 --> 41:23.480
Might be Uncle Matt.

41:23.480 --> 41:24.480
I don't know.

41:24.480 --> 41:25.480
It's like pink.

41:25.480 --> 41:28.720
OK, so you got the anyways, you get the.

41:28.720 --> 41:29.720
Oh, yeah, that's right.

41:29.720 --> 41:32.440
Elderberry supposed to be good for the old immune system.

41:32.440 --> 41:37.560
Well, because my kid like there's not a disease in school that he hasn't met that he didn't

41:37.560 --> 41:38.560
like.

41:38.560 --> 41:42.360
I mean, he's like, yeah, let me go up to dad and kill him.

41:42.360 --> 41:46.500
He only has to the only you know, the only thing is when dad gets sick is he only has

41:46.500 --> 41:48.720
to continue to work and do everything he had to do.

41:48.720 --> 41:50.120
But this time he has to do it sick.

41:50.120 --> 41:51.120
That's the only thing.

41:51.120 --> 41:52.120
That's no big deal.

41:52.120 --> 41:56.520
There is nothing like having your your spacebar lock up because you just spit mucus right

41:56.520 --> 41:57.720
into it.

41:57.720 --> 41:59.360
Happens to even non butterfly keyboards.

41:59.360 --> 42:03.600
I am back on the code keyboard because you need something that can handle mucus, man.

42:03.600 --> 42:05.360
You got to you need some distance.

42:05.360 --> 42:06.360
That's what you need.

42:06.360 --> 42:07.360
Get out.

42:07.360 --> 42:08.360
Get your mouth out of that keyboard.

42:08.360 --> 42:10.320
Hey, listen, if you have the implant, I'm ready to go.

42:10.320 --> 42:12.760
But we should move on because we're getting to the end of our night.

42:12.760 --> 42:13.760
All right.

42:13.760 --> 42:15.000
You know, we you know, we haven't done for a couple of weeks.

42:15.000 --> 42:16.000
We haven't thanked our members.

42:16.000 --> 42:18.080
I want to say thank you to our Coder QA team.

42:18.080 --> 42:19.160
You guys are great out there.

42:19.160 --> 42:20.400
You get the limited ad feed.

42:20.400 --> 42:22.060
You get which is fancy, right?

42:22.060 --> 42:26.280
So that way you get just the just the show limited ads.

42:26.280 --> 42:27.280
But you know what?

42:27.280 --> 42:28.320
You also get the quarterly.

42:28.320 --> 42:29.320
You know what?

42:29.320 --> 42:30.320
Just so that way you get the quarterly, too.

42:30.320 --> 42:32.600
We know we had oh, yeah, we just took it there and we put it in there.

42:32.600 --> 42:36.600
We put it in the feed and you can sign up at Coder QA dot co.

42:36.600 --> 42:39.000
And then once a quarter, you get the quarterly.

42:39.000 --> 42:41.840
And we just we just stick it in your feet.

42:41.840 --> 42:44.920
We just stick it in your feet in the limited ad feed where you have the limited ads.

42:44.920 --> 42:48.520
We stick it in your feet and that's where you get it or we'll put it up for download

42:48.520 --> 42:49.520
as well.

42:49.520 --> 42:50.520
That can happen, too.

42:50.520 --> 42:53.840
Mr. Dominic, is there anything you'd like to mention before we get out of here?

42:53.840 --> 42:58.960
No, but Earth Day is coming up and there'll be yet another Thaleo on offer for me because

42:58.960 --> 43:03.520
I think Thaleos are the entry way to drugs to good programming.

43:03.520 --> 43:05.840
So by the way, they have a new one out, the Mira.

43:05.840 --> 43:06.840
Yeah.

43:06.840 --> 43:10.520
I like the small one and the big one, and it's totally the one I would go for.

43:10.520 --> 43:15.120
So don't tell my good friend Carl, but it's the one they should have built the first time

43:15.120 --> 43:17.080
instead of the one.

43:17.080 --> 43:19.320
Yeah, I kind of think so, too.

43:19.320 --> 43:24.960
I've heard the decibel difference and they have several improvements into that area.

43:24.960 --> 43:30.880
But the only thing now is I got to start budgeting because I do want to replace my desktop PC

43:30.880 --> 43:31.880
this year.

43:31.880 --> 43:34.080
But the GPU prices are crazy.

43:34.080 --> 43:35.080
It's not their fault.

43:35.080 --> 43:37.960
Now, that's not them, though.

43:37.960 --> 43:45.800
Some a**hole has Asus, and Drew, I am so sorry tonight, has Asusa facility in Plant City,

43:45.800 --> 43:54.160
Florida, running five Mac Minis, two Thaleos, and several rack servers mining Dogecoin right

43:54.160 --> 43:55.160
now.

43:55.160 --> 43:56.560
Get the hell out of here.

43:56.560 --> 43:59.040
What kind of monster would do that?

43:59.040 --> 44:00.040
Dogecoin.

44:00.040 --> 44:02.680
I'm not joking.

44:02.680 --> 44:04.720
I am in the Doge.

44:04.720 --> 44:07.000
To a disturbing degree.

44:07.000 --> 44:08.960
Is there something great about it that I don't know?

44:08.960 --> 44:11.480
Can you trade it for other cryptos or what is it?

44:11.480 --> 44:14.880
I've either become enlightened or I've had a psychological breakdown.

44:14.880 --> 44:15.880
So we'll see.

44:15.880 --> 44:16.880
OK.

44:16.880 --> 44:18.520
I mean, I think Wes likes the Doge, too.

44:18.520 --> 44:23.440
So well, if Wes likes it and I like it, I think he dabbles in the Doge, then it's probably

44:23.440 --> 44:24.440
OK.

44:24.440 --> 44:26.540
Yeah, if he's into the Doge, then I'm safe.

44:26.540 --> 44:30.600
It's usually when Wes tells me I'm crazy that I'm in bad shape.

44:30.600 --> 44:34.860
Or he's had some sort of break and you guys have just broken at a similar time.

44:34.860 --> 44:38.920
It would be scary if Wes was becoming more like me because that's.

44:38.920 --> 44:39.920
He's our straight man.

44:39.920 --> 44:40.920
Right.

44:40.920 --> 44:41.920
He is the straight man of the network.

44:41.920 --> 44:42.920
Really?

44:42.920 --> 44:43.920
Yeah.

44:43.920 --> 44:44.920
Like the rest of us are psychos.

44:44.920 --> 44:45.920
I know.

44:45.920 --> 44:46.920
Maniacs all over the place.

44:46.920 --> 44:49.400
Wes is like, well, it's not that bad.

44:49.400 --> 44:50.400
Calm down.

44:50.400 --> 44:51.400
You know, it's OK.

44:51.400 --> 44:52.400
He's always so rational.

44:52.400 --> 44:53.400
He's always like, calm.

44:53.400 --> 44:54.920
You and I are like, fuck them.

44:54.920 --> 44:55.920
We hate them.

44:55.920 --> 44:56.920
Hey, you know what?

44:56.920 --> 44:57.920
It's what makes makes for content.

44:57.920 --> 44:58.920
You know, you got to have a straight man.

44:58.920 --> 45:00.880
You got to have a straight man in the group.

45:00.880 --> 45:05.240
So I would assume you're going to be tweeting at Dumanuco for that Thaleo stuff.

45:05.240 --> 45:07.040
And the company is at the Mad Botter Inc.

45:07.040 --> 45:08.040
Absolutely.

45:08.040 --> 45:09.040
I'm over there, too.

45:09.040 --> 45:10.040
I'm at Chris LAS.

45:10.040 --> 45:13.160
And the whole gosh darn podcast network is at Jupiter Signal.

45:13.160 --> 45:17.040

It's got its own Twitter.

45:18.040 --> 45:19.040
It's got its own Twitter.

45:19.040 --> 45:20.040
Can you believe it?

45:20.040 --> 45:24.560
Who's ever seen such a thing?

45:24.560 --> 45:29.000
