00:00.000 --> 00:16.240
This is KOTORadio, episode 417 for June 7th, Twenty-Twenty-One.

00:16.240 --> 00:17.240
Well hey there, good looking!

00:17.240 --> 00:20.800
Welcome into Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show, taking a pragmatic look at the

00:20.800 --> 00:26.280
art and the business of software development, and the entire world of technology.

00:26.280 --> 00:28.000
This episode is brought to you by a Cloud Guru.

00:28.000 --> 00:32.820
You know a Cloud Guru has that Cloud playground, Azure, AWS, or Google's Cloud sandboxes on

00:32.820 --> 00:35.320
ACG's credit card, and not yours.

00:35.320 --> 00:38.340
That's right, you can get certified, you can get hired, and you can go hands-on and get

00:38.340 --> 00:41.480
learning at acloudguru.com.

00:41.480 --> 00:46.320
My name is Chris, and taking notes from today's keynote, it's our host, Mr. Dominic.

00:46.320 --> 00:47.320
Hello, Mike.

00:47.320 --> 00:48.920
I don't think we're going to fool them with that one.

00:48.920 --> 00:49.920
No.

00:49.920 --> 00:50.920
You're lucky I watched the keynote.

00:50.920 --> 00:51.920
Yeah.

00:51.920 --> 00:52.920
I know, right?

00:52.920 --> 00:55.620
Yeah, I was impressed you were watching the keynote, actually.

00:55.620 --> 00:58.680
And you know, I thought maybe, because we've got so much to talk about, we don't even need

00:58.680 --> 00:59.680
to talk about WWDC today.

00:59.680 --> 01:00.680
You know?

01:00.680 --> 01:01.680
We don't need it.

01:01.680 --> 01:02.680
I'm fine with that.

01:02.680 --> 01:03.680
Yeah.

01:03.680 --> 01:05.480
Yeah, I got the launch keyboard right here.

01:05.480 --> 01:06.480
You know what I'm saying?

01:06.480 --> 01:07.480
Me too.

01:07.480 --> 01:08.480
You got your launch?

01:08.480 --> 01:12.160
Yeah, but what caps did you go with?

01:12.160 --> 01:13.160
Or switches, I should say.

01:13.160 --> 01:15.920
Yeah, I used the Royals, the quieter ones, I believe, right?

01:15.920 --> 01:16.920
Yeah.

01:16.920 --> 01:17.920
Which are quiet-ish.

01:17.920 --> 01:24.880
Here, I'll give you a little demo.

01:24.880 --> 01:25.880
Quiet-ish.

01:25.880 --> 01:26.880
You know?

01:26.880 --> 01:27.880
Oh, you don't need to give me a demo.

01:27.880 --> 01:34.740
I, too, have launched a $285 keyboard.

01:34.740 --> 01:35.740
Is it worth it?

01:35.740 --> 01:36.740
Right off there, off the top.

01:36.740 --> 01:37.740
What do you think?

01:37.740 --> 01:38.740
I think, yes.

01:38.740 --> 01:41.600
Now, it is an expensive keyboard.

01:41.600 --> 01:43.360
No two ways about that.

01:43.360 --> 01:45.960
But I'm extremely happy with it.

01:45.960 --> 01:49.080
I mean, I've been using it primarily on Mac OS.

01:49.080 --> 01:53.760
And the fact that they added a pinwheel effect for me is just glorious.

01:53.760 --> 01:59.760
So yes, the beach ball of doom when Xcode, you know, does its thing.

01:59.760 --> 02:05.840
Well, you know, the reality is it is a really nice typing experience.

02:05.840 --> 02:07.440
I installed it in the studio here.

02:07.440 --> 02:14.040
And I'm replacing the keyboard I talked about before, my Keychron K3, which was a nice $85

02:14.040 --> 02:15.600
mechanical keyboard.

02:15.600 --> 02:20.200
And Wes Payne can attest, because he has to sit in here with me in the studio, I could

02:20.200 --> 02:24.220
never really get a good typing rhythm down with my Keytron.

02:24.220 --> 02:27.400
It just was like not quite lining up with my hands.

02:27.400 --> 02:30.140
And I fly on the launch.

02:30.140 --> 02:31.520
And this is Wes's observation.

02:31.520 --> 02:33.420
He brought it up to me yesterday.

02:33.420 --> 02:36.800
He's like, you are typing faster than I have ever seen you type.

02:36.800 --> 02:38.760
As long as he's known me, he mentioned.

02:38.760 --> 02:41.560
And I really am just flying on this keyboard.

02:41.560 --> 02:43.660
Now, I don't know exactly what they've done.

02:43.660 --> 02:46.840
Maybe it's some of the sizing, the way things are laid out, the feel.

02:46.840 --> 02:49.640
Maybe it's like 100 things that are all coming together.

02:49.640 --> 02:52.360
But it is really a great typing experience.

02:52.360 --> 02:54.000
It has a lot of really clever features.

02:54.000 --> 02:58.000
I'm going to deep dive into some of the software features you can modify and the layers you

02:58.000 --> 02:59.820
can set up in Linux Unplugged this week.

02:59.820 --> 03:05.640
But needless to say, I was skeptical that the price would be justified.

03:05.640 --> 03:06.800
I will be honest.

03:06.800 --> 03:08.280
I knew I would like it.

03:08.280 --> 03:12.800
I had a pretty good idea that they knew what they were doing, because I've talked to them

03:12.800 --> 03:14.200
over the years.

03:14.200 --> 03:18.800
And I've kind of seen eye to eye with them on their philosophy about building this thing.

03:18.800 --> 03:24.820
But I was legitimately worried that $285 was just kind of unjustifiable.

03:24.820 --> 03:25.820
It's not cheap.

03:25.820 --> 03:27.120
I think it's clearly worth it.

03:27.120 --> 03:31.560
This is one of those cases where I put on my Marco Armin ATP t-shirt, which I have in

03:31.560 --> 03:33.720
both blue and purple.

03:33.720 --> 03:36.320
And I really do.

03:36.320 --> 03:38.960
And in fact, I just ordered a pint glass from them.

03:38.960 --> 03:43.560
And by the way, how do you justify such expensive beer glasses?

03:43.560 --> 03:44.560
Me?

03:44.560 --> 03:45.560
My glasses?

03:45.560 --> 03:46.560
Mine are more cheap.

03:46.560 --> 03:47.560
What are you talking about?

03:47.560 --> 03:48.560
No, I'm talking about them.

03:48.560 --> 03:50.200
I wrote in that they love when we troll ATP.

03:50.200 --> 03:51.200
So there you go.

03:51.200 --> 03:52.200
Oh, yeah, yeah.

03:52.200 --> 03:53.200
Yeah, they got a they got a merch store.

03:53.200 --> 03:54.200
So we can troll them.

03:54.200 --> 03:56.280
Just just a little feedback.

03:56.280 --> 03:58.440
So the robe situation, June, right?

03:58.440 --> 03:59.440
It's happening.

03:59.440 --> 04:00.440
All right.

04:00.440 --> 04:01.440
People were tweeting at me.

04:01.440 --> 04:02.440
It is.

04:02.440 --> 04:03.440
Oh, I know.

04:03.440 --> 04:04.440
I know.

04:04.440 --> 04:05.440
People tweet like we didn't just do an update last week.

04:05.440 --> 04:06.440
I felt like we did.

04:06.440 --> 04:07.440
All right.

04:07.440 --> 04:08.440
We did.

04:08.440 --> 04:09.440
It was the first email out of the gate last week.

04:09.440 --> 04:14.120
But but but maybe just for brevity, so you don't have to go back and listen.

04:14.120 --> 04:16.120
Small batches are shipping out throughout this whole month.

04:16.120 --> 04:20.880
And if everything stays on track by the end of June, everyone should have their robes.

04:20.880 --> 04:24.720
I wouldn't be surprised if that slides a little bit because it just comes down to material

04:24.720 --> 04:25.720
shortages.

04:25.720 --> 04:27.640
But yeah, they are going out.

04:27.640 --> 04:29.100
So do send us some pictures.

04:29.100 --> 04:30.520
The first people to start getting their robes.

04:30.520 --> 04:31.740
I want pictures.

04:31.740 --> 04:36.000
And if you have a launch keyboard and you can hold it like a like a sword in your robe,

04:36.000 --> 04:37.000
that would be great.

04:37.000 --> 04:38.000
That would be amazing.

04:38.000 --> 04:41.600
Anyways, we'll have more thoughts on the launch because it is an investment.

04:41.600 --> 04:43.260
But no doubt about it.

04:43.260 --> 04:45.520
The only thing I wish I could buy more of them.

04:45.520 --> 04:46.520
I like it so much.

04:46.520 --> 04:47.800
I wish I could afford more of them.

04:47.800 --> 04:48.960
That's the only thing.

04:48.960 --> 04:52.080
But I absolutely do feel like it was worth the money I spent.

04:52.080 --> 04:56.160
And I have more thoughts, including I bought a thirty dollar mechanical keyboard to just

04:56.160 --> 05:00.240
see what what is the difference, you know, of like one hundred and two hundred dollars

05:00.240 --> 05:01.240
and change.

05:01.240 --> 05:04.200
And I'll do that comparison later as well.

05:04.200 --> 05:10.180
But honestly, there is a lot to get into for WWDC and right off the top, you know, big

05:10.180 --> 05:12.760
elephant in the room, nada on the hardware.

05:12.760 --> 05:18.240
No hardware announced, no M2, no 40 cores, no MacBook Pros.

05:18.240 --> 05:20.560
Yeah, a lot of people were pissed.

05:20.560 --> 05:21.560
A lot of you.

05:21.560 --> 05:23.400
That was I was super surprised.

05:23.400 --> 05:25.760
I thought the big win here was going to be the MacBook Pro.

05:25.760 --> 05:31.560
For me, the tell was when WWDC keynote started and the Apple store was still online.

05:31.560 --> 05:34.240
I knew right then and there I knew it.

05:34.240 --> 05:35.240
Oh, dude.

05:35.240 --> 05:36.440
Good call.

05:36.440 --> 05:39.760
We did get a lot of platform feature updates.

05:39.760 --> 05:45.880
And I watched this event from the perspective of a 20 year desktop Linux user.

05:45.880 --> 05:51.160
And so I watch this stuff come in and I kind of compare it to what we have in the free

05:51.160 --> 05:52.560
software community.

05:52.560 --> 05:56.780
And then also, you know what, against Android and Windows and all that kind of stuff.

05:56.780 --> 05:59.960
And there's a few things that I think are fluff that we're just going to completely

05:59.960 --> 06:04.560
avoid and we're going to just focus on things that I think are interesting, that Mike thinks

06:04.560 --> 06:09.480
are interesting or our new technical innovations or our new big platform statements by Apple.

06:09.480 --> 06:13.240
And so that means there's a lot in here, like the SharePlay API, which actually looks really

06:13.240 --> 06:14.240
clever.

06:14.240 --> 06:15.240
But I just don't have a lot to say about it.

06:15.240 --> 06:17.480
You know, it's something we're going to have to test.

06:17.480 --> 06:21.280
FaceTime coming to the Web and Android.

06:21.280 --> 06:23.480
I mean, I guess that's kind of noteworthy.

06:23.480 --> 06:26.880
Just one pandemic late on that one.

06:26.880 --> 06:29.360
And of course, there was that big announcement up on stage.

06:29.360 --> 06:31.320
We're going to take it all the way.

06:31.320 --> 06:36.200
We're going to the standards bodies starting tomorrow and we're going to make FaceTime

06:36.200 --> 06:38.440
an open industry standard.

06:38.440 --> 06:39.760
Oh, my bad.

06:39.760 --> 06:40.760
Sorry.

06:40.760 --> 06:41.760
That was from a previous keynote.

06:41.760 --> 06:47.840
No accident there, a little production there, but it is good to finally see it on the Web,

06:47.840 --> 06:48.840
I suppose.

06:48.840 --> 06:52.440
But let's talk about stuff that I think really matters and that's going to kind of start

06:52.440 --> 06:57.820
for me with personally what matters to me and then we'll expand out, I think, to general

06:57.820 --> 06:58.820
industry.

06:58.820 --> 07:00.600
And of course, the stuff that's going to matter to developers.

07:00.600 --> 07:05.600
But right off the top, iOS is introducing something that Android tried in 2017 and is

07:05.600 --> 07:10.400
now classifying notifications across a range of from passive to critical.

07:10.400 --> 07:14.960
So you've got like Yelp recommendations and just general app spam.

07:14.960 --> 07:16.440
That's a passive.

07:16.440 --> 07:21.560
Active would be breaking news, team score, stocks, time sensitive, like a package delivery

07:21.560 --> 07:22.560
is another category.

07:22.560 --> 07:24.560
And then the last one is critical.

07:24.560 --> 07:31.200
So like an amber alert style kind of alert and low, medium and high kind of settings.

07:31.200 --> 07:36.680
There's four levels total that will be used together to, I guess, allow the operating

07:36.680 --> 07:40.840
system to try to surface to the user the priority of notifications.

07:40.840 --> 07:41.840
Is this what we wanted?

07:41.840 --> 07:44.840
Is this what you expected for notification overhaul?

07:44.840 --> 07:50.400
No, because I don't think it's going to work, which I this is one of those cases where I

07:50.400 --> 07:52.800
feel really bad saying that because I want it to work.

07:52.800 --> 07:53.800
Oh, for sure.

07:53.800 --> 07:54.800
Yeah.

07:54.800 --> 07:55.800
Yeah.

07:55.800 --> 07:59.320
But I don't think this is going to work for the same reason it didn't work on Android.

07:59.320 --> 08:03.160
You know why it's not going to work, Mike, is because it depends on the developers classifying

08:03.160 --> 08:04.560
these notifications.

08:04.560 --> 08:08.000
And they're all going to say their stuff is time sensitive or critical.

08:08.000 --> 08:12.240
They're all going to abuse the system and then it'll be up to app review to policy it

08:12.240 --> 08:13.440
and police it.

08:13.440 --> 08:18.320
And it's just going to be slow and tedious and not nearly as functional as if they just

08:18.320 --> 08:20.760
let the user go in and define a notification.

08:20.760 --> 08:24.960
Like maybe the first time a notification comes up right then and there, I could push in on

08:24.960 --> 08:28.820
it and define this type of notification and the operating system would remember it there

08:28.820 --> 08:29.820
forward.

08:29.820 --> 08:31.240
That would probably solve it over time.

08:31.240 --> 08:38.200
Yeah, but just the sheer amount of manual labor you just signed app review up for.

08:38.200 --> 08:43.840
Well, it's going to one way or another, they're going to have to enforce this new notification

08:43.840 --> 08:46.040
classification.

08:46.040 --> 08:49.960
You either make the users do it or you make the developers do it in the app review, police

08:49.960 --> 08:50.960
it.

08:50.960 --> 08:55.640
But here's why I really want it to be successful, because I'm going to just admit right off

08:55.640 --> 09:03.460
the top, they announced a feature that is platform wide that if they correctly implement,

09:03.460 --> 09:07.480
I will switch to a Mac desktop for everything.

09:07.480 --> 09:10.400
And I'm not kidding because it would change my life.

09:10.400 --> 09:12.440
And it was this focus feature.

09:12.440 --> 09:16.760
While an important part of finding focus is about reducing distraction from others, it's

09:16.760 --> 09:20.700
also about drawing boundaries for yourself.

09:20.700 --> 09:25.280
There may be periods in your day when you want to be totally focused on work, or maybe

09:25.280 --> 09:28.720
you just want to be fully present with your family at dinner.

09:28.720 --> 09:35.260
In these moments, you can use do not disturb or strike more of a balance with focus.

09:35.260 --> 09:39.620
Focus is a new way to match your device to your current mindset.

09:39.620 --> 09:43.760
With focus, all you have to do is choose what you want to focus on.

09:43.760 --> 09:47.560
You can carve out time in your day for work or your personal life.

09:47.560 --> 09:52.620
When setting up a focus, we use on device intelligence about your past activity to suggest

09:52.620 --> 09:56.260
apps and people to allow notifications from.

09:56.260 --> 10:00.880
So if you're at work, you could choose to only be notified by coworkers or apps like

10:00.880 --> 10:03.400
mail, calendar or slack.

10:03.400 --> 10:07.400
You can even dedicate a page on your home screen to match your focus and organize your

10:07.400 --> 10:13.080
apps and widgets in a way that reduces temptations by making only your work apps visible.

10:13.080 --> 10:17.980
For your personal life, we'll suggest being notified only by friends and family or apps

10:17.980 --> 10:19.680
like Calm.

10:19.680 --> 10:23.840
And for a home screen to match, you can have your favorite entertainment apps like YouTube

10:23.840 --> 10:27.080
or widgets for keeping up with your friends and family.

10:27.080 --> 10:31.940
We'll even intelligently suggest using a focus based on your context, using different signals

10:31.940 --> 10:34.560
like location or time of day.

10:34.560 --> 10:37.500
Of course, you can create a custom focus too.

10:37.500 --> 10:43.240
And when you use a focus on one device, it automatically sets on all your other devices.

10:43.240 --> 10:48.560
That's huge, including the watch and the tablet and the damn phone.

10:48.560 --> 10:53.880
I can tell you it is such it is such an annoying thing when I sit down to record or maybe I'm

10:53.880 --> 10:58.720
an old man and I try to take a nap and I silence something or I set a status somewhere.

10:58.720 --> 11:02.900
And the one or two devices I forget are the ones that always wake me up or always notify

11:02.900 --> 11:04.720
me or interrupt the recording.

11:04.720 --> 11:08.540
And then also to help with ADD in general, that could be fantastic.

11:08.540 --> 11:14.880
And then ultimately, the use case that I would use this for on day one is when I am flying

11:14.880 --> 11:22.640
my mother effing drone, that is the precise moment that everyone I know starts to contact

11:22.640 --> 11:23.640
me.

11:23.640 --> 11:27.500
And it could be like, so if I try to lock down Slack and Telegram and Discord, it'll

11:27.500 --> 11:30.680
be all of a sudden Gmail smart alerts start coming up.

11:30.680 --> 11:34.480
It doesn't matter what I'm doing, it doesn't matter who is just I will start getting all

11:34.480 --> 11:36.800
of the notifications while I'm flying my drone.

11:36.800 --> 11:40.600
And of course, on this stupid little iPhone mini, it takes up such a huge portion of the

11:40.600 --> 11:44.740
screen that it actually obstructs my view of flying my drone.

11:44.740 --> 11:49.760
And there have been times where maybe I was flying my drone for 20 minutes and I received

11:49.760 --> 11:54.120
815 notifications and it's outrageous.

11:54.120 --> 11:59.600
And even if I have the phone in D&D mode, I still get the drop down notifications unless

11:59.600 --> 12:06.320
I completely disable them, I still get the drop downs and focus mode would take care

12:06.320 --> 12:07.320
of that.

12:07.320 --> 12:12.120
And on top of that, they're making a damn API available for third party messaging apps

12:12.120 --> 12:17.960
like Telegram and Slack that can see my system wide status and reflect in those apps when

12:17.960 --> 12:19.700
I'm in D&D mode.

12:19.700 --> 12:21.040
That would change my life.

12:21.040 --> 12:28.720
Yeah, I mean, I did not really take this seriously, but in the somewhat questionable case for

12:28.720 --> 12:29.720
this actually works.

12:29.720 --> 12:32.160
Yeah, yeah, it has to work.

12:32.160 --> 12:37.840
But if I could just get a focus mode where only one or two people could even break through,

12:37.840 --> 12:40.520
that would be massive for me.

12:40.520 --> 12:46.880
And the idea that that would sink across the desktop, the watch, the tablet and the phone.

12:46.880 --> 12:52.400
Oh, man, man, oh, man, that would be the ultimate for me because right now I have so many different

12:52.400 --> 12:54.200
disparate OSes and devices.

12:54.200 --> 12:56.600
It is a manual process for all of them.

12:56.600 --> 13:00.880
And that is the kind of workflow improvement, these kinds of things that would just really

13:00.880 --> 13:05.880
entice me to switch over to the platform and say, I love you, Linux desktop, but this improves

13:05.880 --> 13:07.440
my life.

13:07.440 --> 13:09.680
And that to me is a big one.

13:09.680 --> 13:14.520
I find it hard to believe you would really consider leaving the desktop.

13:14.520 --> 13:19.360
Not completely, but as a daily driver, if they start to add features that allow me to

13:19.360 --> 13:23.120
avoid notifications when I am in the middle of recording or in the middle of flying or

13:23.120 --> 13:28.300
in the middle of editing, which is something I am almost always doing, oh, my God, it would

13:28.300 --> 13:29.300
change my life.

13:29.300 --> 13:33.320
It really is a source of stress and frustration for me, especially when I'm up there flying.

13:33.320 --> 13:38.760
And it is so frustrating and stressful for me that I actually start to become religious

13:38.760 --> 13:43.080
and suspect that there may be some kind of divine intervention going on just to screw

13:43.080 --> 13:48.640
with me because I simply can't comprehend how else it is possible that I get so many

13:48.640 --> 13:53.040
notifications and I hear from so many different people every time I'm flying my drone or every

13:53.040 --> 13:56.920
time I'm trying to record and people that have worked with me for a while know I could

13:56.920 --> 13:57.920
go all day.

13:57.920 --> 13:58.920
No notifications.

13:58.920 --> 13:59.920
I sit down to record.

13:59.920 --> 14:00.920
That's when they all come in.

14:00.920 --> 14:04.680
And of course, it's on the one device that I didn't silence that particular time.

14:04.680 --> 14:06.740
Oh, it gets me so fired up.

14:06.740 --> 14:11.320
It really is it is like slow torture every single day of my life.

14:11.320 --> 14:13.320
I hate notifications.

14:13.320 --> 14:18.740
And because every application is constantly adding its own messaging platform, some days

14:18.740 --> 14:22.940
just miraculously apps auto update and now they have a messaging feature and now I'm

14:22.940 --> 14:24.720
getting notifications from them.

14:24.720 --> 14:29.840
And that and as soon as there is a way for humans to contact me on a platform, I start

14:29.840 --> 14:33.000
getting notifications.

14:33.000 --> 14:34.000
Gets me worked up.

14:34.000 --> 14:35.000
God damn, dude.

14:35.000 --> 14:36.000
All right.

14:36.000 --> 14:37.000
I don't know.

14:37.000 --> 14:42.200
So maybe maybe if it could if they could make that better, I might I might consider switching.

14:42.200 --> 14:46.300
But I know what you and I were talking about before the big event was they really needed

14:46.300 --> 14:48.520
to improve the iPad situation.

14:48.520 --> 14:54.400
Oh, dude, dude, you have to go first because this is going to be another another rant.

14:54.400 --> 14:59.840
So I think the area that was needed most obvious addressing was all of it.

14:59.840 --> 15:00.840
Yeah.

15:00.840 --> 15:02.720
I mean, it really all needed so much work.

15:02.720 --> 15:03.720
Multitasking was one of them.

15:03.720 --> 15:06.720
I don't even know if I could say it was the majority of where the work needed to be.

15:06.720 --> 15:09.880
But we did see some updates in multitasking.

15:09.880 --> 15:13.360
There is now a new multitasking menu.

15:13.360 --> 15:18.640
In iPadOS 15, there's a new control that appears at the top of your apps.

15:18.640 --> 15:21.480
Tapping on it reveals the multitasking menu.

15:21.480 --> 15:26.280
From here, I can take an app full screen or work with two apps at the same time by creating

15:26.280 --> 15:28.520
a split view or slide over.

15:28.520 --> 15:32.840
I'll tap on the split view icon and the app slides to the edge of the screen, giving me

15:32.840 --> 15:36.760
quick access to my home screen where I can select from any of my apps.

15:36.760 --> 15:41.580
Essentially, they're taking the multitasking gestures and functionality that were obtuse

15:41.580 --> 15:47.120
and hard to remember, and they're exposing them with a visual menu pop up that is now

15:47.120 --> 15:52.920
going to be persistent, that that gives you actual like little indicators of where you're

15:52.920 --> 15:55.560
actually going to be putting the app when you hit that button.

15:55.560 --> 15:58.800
And then they're now combining that with a new shelf.

15:58.800 --> 16:02.720
The new multi window shelf gives you quick access to all the open windows for that app.

16:02.720 --> 16:07.080
So now you can have Safari with multiple tabs and multiple windows or any app.

16:07.080 --> 16:12.280
You can have multiple windows for the apps now, and those windows will live in the shelf.

16:12.280 --> 16:14.880
And then you can get to that at the bottom of the screen.

16:14.880 --> 16:20.560
You know, when I'm on my iPad, I often think, you know what this needs?

16:20.560 --> 16:26.160
This needs a shelf, like to put some some knickknacks on, you know, a couple like bobble

16:26.160 --> 16:29.940
head guys, a couple, maybe some Donald Knuth books, right?

16:29.940 --> 16:30.940
That's what this needs.

16:30.940 --> 16:33.920
So you've already got your application switcher at the bottom of your screen.

16:33.920 --> 16:35.600
Then you've got the dock at the bottom of the screen.

16:35.600 --> 16:37.920
So clearly you needed a shelf at the bottom of the screen, too.

16:37.920 --> 16:38.920
I'm not joking.

16:38.920 --> 16:39.920
I think this is genius.

16:39.920 --> 16:40.920
Really?

16:40.920 --> 16:43.640
Oh, my next big product is a shelf.

16:43.640 --> 16:44.640
Yeah.

16:44.640 --> 16:45.640
For what?

16:45.640 --> 16:46.640
For Linux?

16:46.640 --> 16:47.640
For whatever it needs to be.

16:47.640 --> 16:50.360
I mean, bring the shelf to Windows.

16:50.360 --> 16:52.800
Listen, you bring me an application.

16:52.800 --> 16:56.400
I will shelfify it, trademark pending on shelfify.

16:56.400 --> 17:01.400
They also added new keyboard navigation and shortcuts across the whole OS multitask.

17:01.400 --> 17:09.160
It is good to see that iPad OS 14 is going to run on all the same iPads that 14 does.

17:09.160 --> 17:12.960
So 15 and 14 run on the same set of iPads.

17:12.960 --> 17:18.340
And I don't know, it just doesn't feel like enough to call this a pro platform still.

17:18.340 --> 17:21.440
Nothing really changed with how it handles external storage.

17:21.440 --> 17:25.040
There's still no quote unquote pro way to load my own apps.

17:25.040 --> 17:28.260
The multitasking features are going to have to be a wait and see.

17:28.260 --> 17:31.200
There's no announced external monitor improvements.

17:31.200 --> 17:35.320
We really just have a new set of iPad controls that are unique to the iPad that don't really

17:35.320 --> 17:36.720
scale beyond that.

17:36.720 --> 17:42.080
And it seems to me like iPad OS continues to be an excuse to take just baby steps.

17:42.080 --> 17:45.600
You know, like a lot of the things they added to the iPad this year was stuff that the iPhone

17:45.600 --> 17:47.640
got last year, like app library.

17:47.640 --> 17:48.680
What are you talking about?

17:48.680 --> 17:50.920
This is like Atlas spanning the world.

17:50.920 --> 17:52.040
It's a shelf, man.

17:52.040 --> 17:54.960
It's what you needed.

17:54.960 --> 17:56.640
Linode dot com slash coder.

17:56.640 --> 18:00.560
Go there to get one hundred dollars in credit and of course, support the show.

18:00.560 --> 18:05.800
That's one hundred dollars in credit for 60 days on your new account.

18:05.800 --> 18:07.840
Linode is our hosting provider of choice.

18:07.840 --> 18:12.580
Everything, everything we've built in the last few years has been built on Linode.

18:12.580 --> 18:16.080
Their infrastructure is solid, it's fast, it's flexible.

18:16.080 --> 18:20.260
It lets you focus on your project and not the infrastructure.

18:20.260 --> 18:25.760
Their pricing is extremely competitive, 30 to 50 percent cheaper than what you're going

18:25.760 --> 18:27.960
to find at other big cloud providers.

18:27.960 --> 18:29.240
But they're independently owned.

18:29.240 --> 18:31.880
So you know that they have a long term plan.

18:31.880 --> 18:36.160
They've been around since 2003 and they're not just like a fly by night that's been jacked

18:36.160 --> 18:38.160
up with some VC funding.

18:38.160 --> 18:40.440
You get 11 data centers to choose from.

18:40.440 --> 18:42.860
Every single one of them is screaming fast.

18:42.860 --> 18:47.000
Every service level, regardless if it's a five dollar rig or or maybe you've got some

18:47.000 --> 18:53.280
fancy high end CPU or GPU compute rig where you're going to get the same great support.

18:53.280 --> 18:57.680
Every single server comes with their 24 seven phone or ticket support.

18:57.680 --> 19:01.100
And every step of the way since 2003, Linode has asked themselves how they can make the

19:01.100 --> 19:03.240
service better.

19:03.240 --> 19:07.920
They've built on features that make a lot of sense like object storage or of course,

19:07.920 --> 19:13.200
load balancers, centralized logging tools, Kubernetes and Terraform support.

19:13.200 --> 19:19.040
All of those come together to make Linode super expandable and scalable to large business

19:19.040 --> 19:23.280
needs, but totally approachable to a complete beginner, maybe somebody who just wants to

19:23.280 --> 19:27.880
learn or maybe has a great idea and they just want to give it a spot on the Internet.

19:27.880 --> 19:29.960
Start by going to Linode.com slash coder.

19:29.960 --> 19:32.080
Get that one hundred dollars, 60 day credit.

19:32.080 --> 19:34.360
And then you really have something to work with.

19:34.360 --> 19:35.880
Try out Linode's dashboard.

19:35.880 --> 19:37.900
See what their load balancers can do.

19:37.900 --> 19:43.680
See how great it is for a small team or a large team to have access to these powerful

19:43.680 --> 19:44.680
tools.

19:44.680 --> 19:48.480
And unlike entry level hosting service providers that lock you into their platform, Linode

19:48.480 --> 19:52.440
is going to give you full back end access to customize and control your server to fit

19:52.440 --> 19:54.800
your needs when you need it.

19:54.800 --> 19:56.500
So go to Linode.com slash coder.

19:56.500 --> 19:57.500
Go there.

19:57.500 --> 19:59.700
Get that one hundred dollars, 60 day credit towards your new account.

19:59.700 --> 20:07.800
And of course, you support the Coder Radio program, Linode.com slash coder.

20:07.800 --> 20:11.760
Well, Siri got some nice improvements and I'm not even kidding.

20:11.760 --> 20:17.640
Y'all can shut up about Siri and just listen.

20:17.640 --> 20:19.480
Offline voice processing.

20:19.480 --> 20:20.480
Game changer.

20:20.480 --> 20:21.480
Hang on.

20:21.480 --> 20:22.480
Just listen.

20:22.480 --> 20:23.480
Come on.

20:23.480 --> 20:24.480
Come on.

20:24.480 --> 20:25.480
Hey.

20:25.480 --> 20:26.480
You have a sound clip for it.

20:26.480 --> 20:27.480
Hey.

20:27.480 --> 20:28.480
Oh, you're right.

20:28.480 --> 20:29.480
Stay a while and listen.

20:29.480 --> 20:30.480
There you go.

20:30.480 --> 20:31.480
This is very solid for me.

20:31.480 --> 20:36.480
I use Siri a lot to control my home assistant install at home and offline speech recognition

20:36.480 --> 20:40.600
was like the real limiting factor for all of us because we like to go up in the hills

20:40.600 --> 20:41.740
and stuff.

20:41.740 --> 20:45.300
And on top of that, the new Siri voices are so much better than all the other smart tubes

20:45.300 --> 20:49.640
that the new voices they rolled out are creepy good.

20:49.640 --> 20:52.700
Siri gets a lot of crap, but I think it's better than the other assistants.

20:52.700 --> 20:57.080
And now with local processing finally coming for a lot of basic voice commands, it's going

20:57.080 --> 21:00.720
to be fast as hell and work without Internet connection.

21:00.720 --> 21:01.720
That's what's up.

21:01.720 --> 21:03.240
I am very happy about this.

21:03.240 --> 21:07.620
We cut every time they said HomePod mini and didn't even mention the HomePod, but I'll

21:07.620 --> 21:08.620
take it.

21:08.620 --> 21:09.620
I know.

21:09.620 --> 21:10.620
I'm with you on that now.

21:10.620 --> 21:11.620
Yeah.

21:11.620 --> 21:13.320
I actually been thinking about trying to buy one more.

21:13.320 --> 21:16.640
But then after watching the keynote today, Apple pretended like they never even made

21:16.640 --> 21:17.640
the HomePod.

21:17.640 --> 21:19.440
We don't know who you are, child.

21:19.440 --> 21:20.440
Monterey.

21:20.440 --> 21:27.760
Mac OS Monterey is here and got a name and they're calling it Mac OS 12, too.

21:27.760 --> 21:31.760
So they are iterating the number now like they do with every iOS release.

21:31.760 --> 21:34.800
They're now iterating every Mac OS release.

21:34.800 --> 21:39.760
There was a feature that they kind of demoed during the Mac segment that people in the

21:39.760 --> 21:42.800
chat room during the keynote thought you were really going to like.

21:42.800 --> 21:45.040
It's called universal control.

21:45.040 --> 21:46.640
This is really powerful.

21:46.640 --> 21:51.760
With universal control, I can even drag and drop files between my devices.

21:51.760 --> 21:57.680
I'm just going to take this drawing I finished on my iPad and drop it on the keynote on my

21:57.680 --> 21:58.680
Mac.

21:58.680 --> 21:59.680
Awesome.

21:59.680 --> 22:05.360
For our pros out there, universal control works with more than two devices.

22:05.360 --> 22:09.160
So let's add this iMac into the mix.

22:09.160 --> 22:15.880
Now I can use the trackpad on my MacBook to control my iMac as well.

22:15.880 --> 22:16.880
What do you think?

22:16.880 --> 22:23.400
One mouse on one device control multiple different Apple devices and you can drag and drop application

22:23.400 --> 22:27.380
or a data application data between them.

22:27.380 --> 22:28.480
Kind of a cool feature.

22:28.480 --> 22:30.160
That's like synergy.

22:30.160 --> 22:31.160
Yeah, I think it's pretty cool.

22:31.160 --> 22:33.720
I mean, it's not earth shattering for my workflows.

22:33.720 --> 22:37.080
Really I'm not going to use it, but I think it's cool.

22:37.080 --> 22:41.220
I could see like more design type, you know, graphical people really having a good time

22:41.220 --> 22:42.220
with it.

22:42.220 --> 22:43.220
Yeah.

22:43.220 --> 22:46.160
Or those situations where maybe you got to sign a document so you could send something

22:46.160 --> 22:49.880
over to the iPad real quick, sign it there and then send it back to the Mac.

22:49.880 --> 22:50.880
True.

22:50.880 --> 22:51.880
True.

22:51.880 --> 22:52.880
Yeah, it's cool.

22:52.880 --> 22:56.600
It's not like I don't know if I would call it revolutionary or whatever you just said.

22:56.600 --> 23:02.240
It's an interesting payoff to adding mouse and trackpad support to the iPad and now they

23:02.240 --> 23:03.240
can do this.

23:03.240 --> 23:04.240
That's interesting.

23:04.240 --> 23:09.240
It must require the same iCloud account and proximity to each other.

23:09.240 --> 23:11.600
Some of these events, they haven't gone into more details yet.

23:11.600 --> 23:13.160
Some we do have details about, some we don't.

23:13.160 --> 23:16.360
And that one is a little obtuse.

23:16.360 --> 23:22.320
And also now the Mac can be an AirPlay destination and shortcuts on the Mac are going to be the

23:22.320 --> 23:23.320
new...

23:23.320 --> 23:24.320
Automator.

23:24.320 --> 23:25.600
Future of automation, they said.

23:25.600 --> 23:26.600
Yeah.

23:26.600 --> 23:27.600
The multi-year transition.

23:27.600 --> 23:30.760
Again, this is where I think our developer audience is like, well, why can't I just write

23:30.760 --> 23:33.760
a Python script or something, right?

23:33.760 --> 23:38.040
But I think a lot of more like non-dev power users will actually like that.

23:38.040 --> 23:42.920
Once it matures enough that it's, how can I say it?

23:42.920 --> 23:45.240
Not trivial in what it can do.

23:45.240 --> 23:49.420
And it needs to be widely adopted too, like Adobe would need to, and Microsoft would need

23:49.420 --> 23:50.420
to adopt this.

23:50.420 --> 23:55.300
Then it could be actually useful for larger selections of people.

23:55.300 --> 23:59.600
It will also come, they said, with a large, rich library of pre-built shortcuts just for

23:59.600 --> 24:00.600
the Mac.

24:00.600 --> 24:03.760
Kind of implying to me that the iOS shortcuts will not work on the Mac.

24:03.760 --> 24:08.020
And then they noted this, but just really quickly, they are introducing a low power

24:08.020 --> 24:15.120
mode on the Mac, which is compatible with early 2016 and later MacBook Pros, and I assume

24:15.120 --> 24:16.880
M1 MacBook Pros.

24:16.880 --> 24:21.520
And according to Apple, low power mode on the Mac will reduce the system clock speed

24:21.520 --> 24:25.040
and display brightness in order to extend your battery life even further.

24:25.040 --> 24:28.120
I would imagine it also disables turbo boost.

24:28.120 --> 24:32.100
Seems like if you've already got ridiculous battery life on the M1, and then you turn

24:32.100 --> 24:37.200
on low power mode, what are you going to get, two days out of the thing?

24:37.200 --> 24:39.320
You know, I will not criticize this one.

24:39.320 --> 24:43.000
There is, remember, we're going to be back out in the world again doing conferences and

24:43.000 --> 24:44.000
seeing clients.

24:44.000 --> 24:45.000
Oh, I think it's great.

24:45.000 --> 24:47.520
Yeah, there's never enough battery life.

24:47.520 --> 24:48.520
Just keep it up.

24:48.520 --> 24:50.480
I think this is a baby step low power mode though.

24:50.480 --> 24:55.320
I mean, again, I'm looking at this from a perspective of a Linux user thinking, I do

24:55.320 --> 24:58.800
this now with TLP, but it's a very manual process.

24:58.800 --> 25:04.200
But what would be nice with low power mode is kind of some kind of feedback system where

25:04.200 --> 25:09.480
Dropbox could be told to stop syncing or whatever, you know, Slack and different apps.

25:09.480 --> 25:11.760
Oh, no, no, that's easy.

25:11.760 --> 25:16.800
You know, your applications directory, RMR, you know, whatever it is, Dropbox.app, yeah.

25:16.800 --> 25:17.800
Heyo.

25:17.800 --> 25:21.200
I mean, overall, pretty minor update to Mac OS.

25:21.200 --> 25:25.600
Looks like most machines older than 2015 are not going to be supported with Monterey, with

25:25.600 --> 25:27.840
the exception of the Trashcan.

25:27.840 --> 25:29.000
So there you go.

25:29.000 --> 25:33.440
Synced focus mode really could be the biggest feature for me, for Mac OS.

25:33.440 --> 25:38.360
But there is some goodies in here for developers, including lots of new APIs.

25:38.360 --> 25:41.980
They kind of made a point that they sort of have an API to go with every single thing

25:41.980 --> 25:45.920
they announced today, which that's good to see.

25:45.920 --> 25:50.040
One API that stuck out to me is the thing where you can scan an object and create an

25:50.040 --> 25:51.040
AR 3D model.

25:51.040 --> 25:54.360
I'm assuming they're using the same and I didn't get to dig into this because I ran

25:54.360 --> 25:57.400
out of time, but I'm assuming they're using the same model class.

25:57.400 --> 25:59.560
They use, you know, an AR kit, right?

25:59.560 --> 26:01.560
I'm sure this is just an extension of AR kit.

26:01.560 --> 26:02.560
Yep, you're right.

26:02.560 --> 26:04.960
That is actually cool.

26:04.960 --> 26:07.120
Two years ago, I had a project we were doing.

26:07.120 --> 26:12.000
We had these like giant ass handheld like guns, quote unquote, but think about like

26:12.000 --> 26:15.320
giant scanners at like Walmart.

26:15.320 --> 26:20.680
And what they were is they 3D scanned objects and we were having to programmatically create

26:20.680 --> 26:24.560
color OBJ files out of them or color STLs, I can't remember which.

26:24.560 --> 26:27.520
But this is when I was doing a bunch of rust.

26:27.520 --> 26:32.320
I talked about it briefly and the dream was, could we hack away to do this on iOS?

26:32.320 --> 26:38.320
At the time, we just couldn't get the fidelity, but if this works as it seems, as they're

26:38.320 --> 26:44.040
claiming it does, that's going to open up a lot of cool doors for like importing real

26:44.040 --> 26:48.000
world AR models without having to spend a fortune because these scanners like five grand

26:48.000 --> 26:49.000
a piece or something.

26:49.000 --> 26:53.540
Yeah, in the state of the union, they demoed scanning a pastry and one of the things they've

26:53.540 --> 26:59.320
done that is not as easy as it sounds is they've also enabled scanning the top and the bottom

26:59.320 --> 27:04.360
with figuring out the background to make it consistent so you can get a complete scanning

27:04.360 --> 27:05.360
of the object.

27:05.360 --> 27:09.380
And of course, they're using the LIDAR sensor to do all the depth sensing and all that kind

27:09.380 --> 27:10.380
of stuff as well.

27:10.380 --> 27:15.440
So basically, if you get something in decent lighting, you can get a very accurate, very

27:15.440 --> 27:21.060
high resolution 3D model, even kind of like the feedback software they're using to show

27:21.060 --> 27:24.680
you the progress of the scan is getting pretty high end.

27:24.680 --> 27:28.460
So the AR stuff has gotten really advanced.

27:28.460 --> 27:32.720
It's got to be building to something, but whatever it's building to was not even hinted

27:32.720 --> 27:35.040
at in the keynote today.

27:35.040 --> 27:38.180
No, time is still a factor here.

27:38.180 --> 27:43.640
The other, I think, big developer thing, although to their credit, by making it open source,

27:43.640 --> 27:50.800
they also kind of kneecap themselves, Swift is getting some very big concurrency improvements

27:50.800 --> 27:54.080
and a really nicer version of async await.

27:54.080 --> 27:57.960
And if that means nothing to you, then you're not a Swift developer.

27:57.960 --> 28:03.440
But Swift, it's one of those cases where like C sharp, for example, where all that async

28:03.440 --> 28:09.440
await stuff really kind of got its mainstream footing, it was just like donking on Swift,

28:09.440 --> 28:12.640
which I'm of course thrilled to see at any point.

28:12.640 --> 28:13.640
It's good.

28:13.640 --> 28:16.120
I mean, if you're working day to day in Swift, this is something you want to save you a bunch

28:16.120 --> 28:21.120
of pain in the ass handling concurrency stuff that's annoying and fraught with bugs.

28:21.120 --> 28:26.080
I did find their claim that, what was it, the thousand top apps or something are made

28:26.080 --> 28:27.120
in Swift.

28:27.120 --> 28:28.120
What does that mean?

28:28.120 --> 28:34.160
Object capture and all of the APIs we've talked about today are built on this Swift programming

28:34.160 --> 28:35.920
language.

28:35.920 --> 28:41.000
Swift has made a huge impact on our app ecosystem and today, the majority of the top thousand

28:41.000 --> 28:43.140
apps are built using Swift.

28:43.140 --> 28:47.240
The majority of the top thousand apps are built with using Swift.

28:47.240 --> 28:50.260
Objective C totally got the HomePod treatment.

28:50.260 --> 28:51.260
Big time.

28:51.260 --> 28:56.120
You know, they were all about, anytime they could mention something was built in Swift,

28:56.120 --> 29:00.040
which is anything they've recently built, they would mention it was built in Swift.

29:00.040 --> 29:02.280
They wanted you to know it.

29:02.280 --> 29:08.080
And Swift Playgrounds was pitched now as the way to make apps for the iPad.

29:08.080 --> 29:10.240
I got a brief clip for that, too.

29:10.240 --> 29:14.820
Swift Playgrounds is a great way to learn to code through a series of Apple design lesson

29:14.820 --> 29:18.160
plans that are interactive and fun.

29:18.160 --> 29:23.880
This year, we're taking it even further by adding the ability to build apps on iPad.

29:23.880 --> 29:27.680
You build these apps with Swift UI, which makes development easy.

29:27.680 --> 29:31.440
The code you write is immediately reflected in the live preview of your app.

29:31.440 --> 29:34.720
This new project type even works with Xcode on Mac.

29:34.720 --> 29:39.640
Swift Playgrounds now supports improved code completion, so you can just start typing and

29:39.640 --> 29:42.160
quickly add the suggestion to your code.

29:42.160 --> 29:46.800
You also have access to the whole library of UI components and the documentation to

29:46.800 --> 29:47.800
go with it.

29:47.800 --> 29:51.240
And if you're new to app development, you can go right to the App Store.

29:51.240 --> 29:55.000
You can build an app on the iPad and submit it to the App Store.

29:55.000 --> 30:00.520
And they are now claiming it's an avenue to make apps on the iPad, on iOS.

30:00.520 --> 30:01.520
Yeah.

30:01.520 --> 30:02.520
I mean, so a couple of things.

30:02.520 --> 30:04.040
Just taking a quick jump back.

30:04.040 --> 30:08.840
I'm still going to challenge that Swift claim, only because technically when you build like

30:08.840 --> 30:14.080
an Ionic or a Xamarin app, there's some Swift running around in their Objective-C, right?

30:14.080 --> 30:15.360
So I don't know.

30:15.360 --> 30:17.000
I mean, are they pure Swift?

30:17.000 --> 30:18.000
Whatever.

30:18.000 --> 30:19.000
That's just me hitting Swift.

30:19.000 --> 30:20.000
Right.

30:20.000 --> 30:22.880
I don't think this is for professional developers, this iPad thing, right?

30:22.880 --> 30:23.880
No.

30:23.880 --> 30:24.880
No.

30:24.880 --> 30:25.880
This is for like Dylan and Reese and whatever.

30:25.880 --> 30:26.880
Yes.

30:26.880 --> 30:28.600
Ostensibly, that's how they're pitching it.

30:28.600 --> 30:32.840
But what I think it really is, and I think they showed their cards in this keynote, is

30:32.840 --> 30:41.000
it is their baby steps to getting Xcode and Swift application development on iOS.

30:41.000 --> 30:47.080
And because they don't have the resources or the team dedication or maybe the mandate

30:47.080 --> 30:53.400
to just build a full-fledged Xcode for iOS, they seem to be instead taking the iMovie

30:53.400 --> 30:59.000
to Final Cut approach where they are doing baby steps as something that's just casual

30:59.000 --> 31:00.000
guys.

31:00.000 --> 31:01.640
It's just for casual people.

31:01.640 --> 31:08.760
And then one day, you know, it's WWDC, maybe it's 2025, and they announce Xcode for iOS,

31:08.760 --> 31:11.880
which is just a souped up version of Swift Playgrounds.

31:11.880 --> 31:17.240
And oh, by the way, it lets you write Swift applications and build them right here on

31:17.240 --> 31:18.240
iOS.

31:18.240 --> 31:19.240
That's got to be where they're going with this.

31:19.240 --> 31:20.240
Yeah.

31:20.240 --> 31:25.600
This whole thing, just in general, the whole presentation left me wondering, does macOS

31:25.600 --> 31:29.440
have five years of like main focus?

31:29.440 --> 31:32.320
And maybe it's not even the main focus now, right?

31:32.320 --> 31:38.840
But will we seriously have, maybe not devs, but professional business people, folks like

31:38.840 --> 31:42.800
that, like legitimately working full time on iPads?

31:42.800 --> 31:46.760
Well, Xcode Cloud could make that a little bit easier.

31:46.760 --> 31:52.280
That was something they announced that pretty, pretty significantly, like they get dedicated

31:52.280 --> 31:54.600
a lot of time to Xcode Cloud.

31:54.600 --> 32:00.360
And then in the State of the Union, they dedicated 15 minutes to Xcode Cloud.

32:00.360 --> 32:02.920
And here's the short version of the announcement.

32:02.920 --> 32:06.720
There's something else we're doing this year, and it's going to take app development to

32:06.720 --> 32:08.480
the next level.

32:08.480 --> 32:12.940
It integrates the cloud with our developer tools in a powerful new way.

32:12.940 --> 32:16.040
And it's called Xcode Cloud.

32:16.040 --> 32:21.840
Today, creating an app requires multiple steps, building, testing, and delivery, and a number

32:21.840 --> 32:23.680
of different tools.

32:23.680 --> 32:28.280
Xcode Cloud simplifies the workflow by bringing everything together.

32:28.280 --> 32:33.080
So as an individual developer, you can focus your energy on being creative and development

32:33.080 --> 32:36.160
teams can collaborate more effectively.

32:36.160 --> 32:37.840
Here's how it works.

32:37.840 --> 32:42.560
When you commit a change to your code, Xcode Cloud can automatically build the app.

32:42.560 --> 32:46.280
Because it's built in the cloud, your Mac is free for other tasks.

32:46.280 --> 32:51.320
And for teams, everyone can see if the change introduces errors so everyone can find and

32:51.320 --> 32:54.000
fix issues faster.

32:54.000 --> 32:58.500
Then Xcode Cloud runs your automated tests in parallel, so they complete in a fraction

32:58.500 --> 33:04.680
of the time, even as they simulate running on every kind of Apple device and platform.

33:04.680 --> 33:10.120
The test results are displayed in Xcode, so you can easily see what worked and fix what

33:10.120 --> 33:11.120
didn't.

33:11.120 --> 33:16.440
Finally, once the app passes all its tests, Xcode Cloud can automatically distribute it

33:16.440 --> 33:21.200
to the testers on your team, and even external beta testers with TestFlight.

33:21.200 --> 33:25.680
Hey, with TestFlight, and they also announced TestFlight is coming to the Mac, which I think

33:25.680 --> 33:26.680
you called.

33:26.680 --> 33:31.740
What do you think with Xcode Cloud, maybe that's how they bring full application development

33:31.740 --> 33:32.740
to the iPad?

33:32.740 --> 33:36.040
Yeah, I mean, that would be a good way to get around some of the limitations of iOS,

33:36.040 --> 33:40.920
although I do wonder if they actually would have iPad with those limitations, but hey.

33:40.920 --> 33:45.080
Ironically, you still need a Mac to use this right now because it requires Xcode to use

33:45.080 --> 33:46.080
Xcode Cloud.

33:46.080 --> 33:51.360
You manage Xcode Cloud using the local Xcode 13 on your Mac.

33:51.360 --> 33:54.600
Yeah, but this is, I mean, you could see where this is going, right?

33:54.600 --> 33:55.600
Oh, yeah.

33:55.600 --> 33:57.240
They're just being cautious as they always are.

33:57.240 --> 33:58.240
Yeah.

33:58.240 --> 33:59.720
Like I sort of had a different take than you, I guess.

33:59.720 --> 34:04.080
I was thinking that, oh, wow, Apple finally discovered continuous integration.

34:04.080 --> 34:08.200
And like all developers who discover testing and continuous integration for the first time,

34:08.200 --> 34:09.200
they're zealots.

34:09.200 --> 34:10.200
Yeah.

34:10.200 --> 34:12.360
I also noticed they intend to charge for this service.

34:12.360 --> 34:20.160
And if their pricing scheme is as it is for most of their products and services, I'm going

34:20.160 --> 34:26.680
to stick very happily with my GitLab pipelines because it's free and on my own hardware.

34:26.680 --> 34:28.840
Well, consider this.

34:28.840 --> 34:30.240
Here's going to be Apple's angle.

34:30.240 --> 34:31.240
Riddle me this, Batman.

34:31.240 --> 34:32.240
Go ahead.

34:32.240 --> 34:37.600
Number one, if you're paying for any Mac mini colo hosting, so that way you could do the

34:37.600 --> 34:43.240
code signing on non-Macs, you can now cancel that because this is going to do code signing

34:43.240 --> 34:44.360
in the cloud.

34:44.360 --> 34:49.800
Also, if you are buying extra devices for compatibility testing, you can stop buying

34:49.800 --> 34:55.200
those thousand dollar devices because this will run in parallel across all supported

34:55.200 --> 34:56.240
Apple devices.

34:56.240 --> 35:01.960
They will simulate every Apple device in the cloud and test it and give you results back

35:01.960 --> 35:02.960
in xCloud.

35:02.960 --> 35:06.520
So you can save money on buying iDevices.

35:06.520 --> 35:11.160
And because they're doing the compiling in the cloud, you can now start buying cheap

35:11.160 --> 35:15.820
Macs that don't have high end processors in them because the cloud's doing the build and

35:15.820 --> 35:19.240
your iOS devices will be able to do the build in the cloud.

35:19.240 --> 35:21.400
So you can buy cheaper iOS devices.

35:21.400 --> 35:25.580
So you add it up over the next five to 10 years and you're actually saving thousands

35:25.580 --> 35:28.400
of dollars potentially by using xCode Cloud.

35:28.400 --> 35:34.760
Yeah, and I should be fair that my whole GitLab pipelines example is problematic for iOS development,

35:34.760 --> 35:35.760
right?

35:35.760 --> 35:37.580
Or at least for native iOS development.

35:37.580 --> 35:42.160
The trick is going to be tying in whatever kind of pipeline you have now into this because

35:42.160 --> 35:45.080
this will be how you distribute it to your Apple users who are going to test it on the

35:45.080 --> 35:46.080
Apple platforms.

35:46.080 --> 35:47.080
Likely.

35:47.080 --> 35:48.080
All right.

35:48.080 --> 35:49.080
All right.

35:49.080 --> 35:50.080
You're changing my mind a little bit.

35:50.080 --> 35:52.920
I guess it depends on like how ridiculous the pricing is going to be for this.

35:52.920 --> 35:53.920
Yeah, we'll see.

35:53.920 --> 35:59.820
So it's a limited beta right now and they're letting some developers in for free and they're

35:59.820 --> 36:03.760
going to have full pricing and other details this fall.

36:03.760 --> 36:07.040
But right now it sounds like a slow rollout to me.

36:07.040 --> 36:11.520
Imagine if this service actually developed into something useful and it meant in a few

36:11.520 --> 36:15.820
years from now you could be kicking off builds, doing code signing and distributing testers

36:15.820 --> 36:17.920
from a Linux desktop.

36:17.920 --> 36:21.840
Maybe or maybe you don't even need a Mac anymore, like you could manage all that stuff from

36:21.840 --> 36:25.440
some sort of X cloud for your iPad and you don't even need a Mac desktop.

36:25.440 --> 36:29.680
Well, I got to tell you, if they really end up deprecating the Mac, I think that's going

36:29.680 --> 36:33.900
to be an interesting opportunity for that awesome, awesome Linux distribution known

36:33.900 --> 36:37.480
as Windows 10.

36:37.480 --> 36:39.560
Datadog.com slash Coder Radio.

36:39.560 --> 36:44.220
Now you can analyze code level performance across your environment and troubleshoot issues

36:44.220 --> 36:47.280
faster than ever with Datadog.

36:47.280 --> 36:51.560
Datadog has so many features that enable you and your team to communicate and analyze your

36:51.560 --> 36:53.440
entire infrastructure quickly.

36:53.440 --> 36:55.400
I love their continuous profiler.

36:55.400 --> 36:59.720
It automatically collects profiles from your production servers all the time so you can

36:59.720 --> 37:03.460
analyze any of your data quickly with minimal overhead.

37:03.460 --> 37:07.720
You get a unified picture of your environment by correlating your code performance with

37:07.720 --> 37:12.920
your other monitoring data like server, metal performance, application performance, network

37:12.920 --> 37:17.460
performance, all brought into live, beautiful dashboards.

37:17.460 --> 37:21.600
You got to go to Datadog.com slash Coder Radio just to see these dashboards and they have

37:21.600 --> 37:26.780
over 450 integrations with different enterprise level applications so you can bring tracing

37:26.780 --> 37:31.520
and log management and continuous profiler to those products in the Datadog platform

37:31.520 --> 37:32.520
as well.

37:32.520 --> 37:37.060
Datadog really gives you the tools so you can pinpoint root causes of issues faster

37:37.060 --> 37:41.280
than ever and communicate them with your entire team visually.

37:41.280 --> 37:44.840
And of course, they have a bunch of smart alerts and all kinds of features that help

37:44.840 --> 37:48.160
you reach more uptime and availability than ever.

37:48.160 --> 37:54.640
So try Datadog's products for free for 14 days by visiting Datadog.com slash Coder Radio.

That's Datadog.com slash Coder Radio and for a limited time, if you start a free trial

37:59.160 --> 38:02.640
and you create one dashboard, you're going to get a free Datadog t-shirt.

38:02.640 --> 38:06.960
Fourteen day free trial, one dashboard, and a free t-shirt.

38:06.960 --> 38:14.480
That's a great deal and you can get started at Datadog.com slash Coder Radio.

38:14.480 --> 38:19.180
So there was a few changes in App Store policy and of course, there was some things that

38:19.180 --> 38:20.180
were Sherlocked.

38:20.180 --> 38:23.140
I think maybe we should wrap up with some of that in our thoughts.

38:23.140 --> 38:27.120
They are giving developers the ability to do A-B testing of icons and screenshots, blah,

38:27.120 --> 38:28.300
blah, blah, blah.

38:28.300 --> 38:29.560
Who really cares?

38:29.560 --> 38:35.100
What really matters is the updated contracts and policies and app review guidelines that

38:35.100 --> 38:40.460
now state that developers who need to can appeal an app rejection when they believe

38:40.460 --> 38:45.860
their app was rejected due to unfair treatment by the app review team, including political

38:45.860 --> 38:48.640
bias or other forms of bias.

38:48.640 --> 38:52.960
What could go wrong?

38:52.960 --> 38:57.500
Apple just basically threw their entire review team under the bus because everyone's going

38:57.500 --> 39:01.480
to claim some kind of bias now when their app gets removed.

39:01.480 --> 39:02.480
Some kind of bias, yeah.

39:02.480 --> 39:06.840
It's going to be, it's going to be, well, I'm a Mets fan, you're a Yankees fan.

39:06.840 --> 39:11.700
So obviously you can't, yeah, this is terrible, I don't, I don't understand.

39:11.700 --> 39:16.320
I mean, it was obvious, I think going in that they weren't going to do anything for developers

39:16.320 --> 39:21.620
only because they have how many lawsuits going on right now and the threat of federal regulations.

39:21.620 --> 39:25.380
They would be admitting fault almost if they, if they would be admitting, it would be crazy.

39:25.380 --> 39:28.700
I mean, I'm sure they're, they're head of legal counsel would like slapped Tim Cook

39:28.700 --> 39:29.700
in the face, right?

39:29.700 --> 39:31.580
Like, what are you doing?

39:31.580 --> 39:32.580
It's weird, right?

39:32.580 --> 39:35.380
Cause years ago I would come on here and rant and be like super radical about like the App

39:35.380 --> 39:36.380
Store.

39:36.380 --> 39:39.940
And then I'm like, how about you just allow people another payment processing method?

39:39.940 --> 39:40.940
Yeah.

39:40.940 --> 39:44.060
And like, I think, I think that's, and I think that's reasonable and probably the most you'd

39:44.060 --> 39:45.580
ever get.

39:45.580 --> 39:51.900
So I don't know, having said that as a dev myself who may or may not have something coming,

39:51.900 --> 39:55.720
coming on an iOS in a few months, I'm still going to use their payment processing cause

39:55.720 --> 39:56.720
it's so easy.

39:56.720 --> 39:58.860
Well, yeah, I would, you would use both, right?

39:58.860 --> 39:59.860
You could use Stripe.

39:59.860 --> 40:04.020
I think they could reasonably require you to use both, right?

40:04.020 --> 40:09.100
The other big thing, just on requirements, any app that allows account creation must

40:09.100 --> 40:11.660
now within the app allow account deletion.

40:11.660 --> 40:12.660
Yeah.

40:12.660 --> 40:16.160
That's, that's, that's a thing.

40:16.160 --> 40:21.260
There's a lot of businesses and a lot of developers who are not going to be particularly happy

40:21.260 --> 40:22.260
about that.

40:22.260 --> 40:23.260
Yeah.

40:23.260 --> 40:25.980
Maybe not in these like small guys like me who, fine, you want to delete your account,

40:25.980 --> 40:26.980
go ahead.

40:26.980 --> 40:30.740
But like, you know, you're, let's not call them social media companies of the world.

40:30.740 --> 40:31.740
Yeah.

40:31.740 --> 40:36.660
So developers can now report other developers that they think are, you know, doing something

40:36.660 --> 40:37.660
wrong.

40:37.660 --> 40:38.660
That's amazing.

40:38.660 --> 40:39.660
Yeah.

40:39.660 --> 40:41.140
That's not, that's, that's not going to get abused.

40:41.140 --> 40:45.360
There's also new rules that say your identity information needs to be accurate and up to

40:45.360 --> 40:48.740
date at all times, or else they can pull your app.

40:48.740 --> 40:52.980
And also Apple clarified that they can determine if your app does not provide adequate quote

40:52.980 --> 40:57.220
utility, it may not be accepted on the app store at all.

40:57.220 --> 40:59.380
So that was already a rule though.

40:59.380 --> 41:00.380
Yeah.

41:00.380 --> 41:03.660
And Apple clarified that further to make it more explicit.

41:03.660 --> 41:04.660
I never thought that.

41:04.660 --> 41:08.020
I mean, that rule was kind of like, I just love that they just determined the utility

41:08.020 --> 41:12.540
of an app, but yet fart apps and millions of flashlight apps make it on the app store.

41:12.540 --> 41:13.540
I guess you're right.

41:13.540 --> 41:17.120
I mean, I used to do apps for like restaurants way back in the day and it was always like

41:17.120 --> 41:21.700
problematic because they really just wanted you to be able to like look at their menu

41:21.700 --> 41:23.980
and call them.

41:23.980 --> 41:26.940
This is before the days of DoorDash and all that stuff.

41:26.940 --> 41:29.500
Those probably wouldn't and shouldn't pass the utility test.

41:29.500 --> 41:30.820
I would think.

41:30.820 --> 41:31.820
Sherlocked.

41:31.820 --> 41:33.740
Well, we got a big one.

41:33.740 --> 41:35.920
Here's a big category.

41:35.920 --> 41:40.660
Authenticator apps like Authy and Google Authenticator got Sherlocked because iOS 15 includes a built-in

41:40.660 --> 41:44.340
password authenticator with autofill for tokens.

41:44.340 --> 41:46.880
So those have been Sherlocked.

41:46.880 --> 41:53.100
The Exif metadata app that was called, I can't remember the name, I can't remember the name,

41:53.100 --> 41:54.940
but it was Apple Sherlocked that app.

41:54.940 --> 41:57.020
It was pretty well known app.

41:57.020 --> 42:05.380
And most casual VPNs have been Sherlocked because Apple is building in private relay into iCloud

42:05.380 --> 42:10.260
and Safari that is probably just going to get used by most people that are just worried

42:10.260 --> 42:12.140
about the typical coffee shop traffic.

42:12.140 --> 42:15.100
I mean, those are just some of the apps I noticed they got Sherlocked.

42:15.100 --> 42:18.620
But when you go on Twitter and you search for Sherlocked, there's a lot more developers

42:18.620 --> 42:24.020
that are moaning about their apps getting consumed into iOS 15.

42:24.020 --> 42:25.020
Yeah.

42:25.020 --> 42:29.100
This is, I mean, I put something snarky on it before.

42:29.100 --> 42:33.740
This felt like Apple was really interested in one third party developer in particular.

42:33.740 --> 42:38.660
Unity got a mention, you know, some engines got a mention up on stage, but there was hardly

42:38.660 --> 42:42.460
any featuring of third party developers at all or their apps.

42:42.460 --> 42:43.460
It was awkward.

42:43.460 --> 42:45.540
It was all about Apple.

42:45.540 --> 42:50.660
I know it's their keynote, but traditionally there is app demos and they're, you know,

42:50.660 --> 42:54.780
not always great, but it seems like this video format would actually be the perfect format

42:54.780 --> 42:58.460
to do an app demo by a third party developer because you could cut it down and make them

42:58.460 --> 43:00.660
take multiple takes to actually make it interesting.

43:00.660 --> 43:01.660
Yeah.

43:01.660 --> 43:04.940
And they just completely just didn't even bother, even though a lot of the COVID restrictions

43:04.940 --> 43:10.020
have loosened up and now they have people in the same room together in the videos.

43:10.020 --> 43:11.020
They still didn't bother.

43:11.020 --> 43:12.980
It was all Apple.

43:12.980 --> 43:13.980
You know what, Mike?

43:13.980 --> 43:19.100
None of it really deserved a nearly two hour keynote or an hour and 50 minute, whatever

43:19.100 --> 43:20.100
it was.

43:20.100 --> 43:24.860
All of the stuff that got announced could just be WWDC videos.

43:24.860 --> 43:27.100
There really wasn't any blow away features.

43:27.100 --> 43:28.100
The pacing was weird.

43:28.100 --> 43:32.020
They spend a bizarre amount of time on health, and I guess they've kind of decided they don't

43:32.020 --> 43:37.340
need to go so silly with the transitions anymore because the kind of overall production of

43:37.340 --> 43:40.620
the video was toned way down as well.

43:40.620 --> 43:42.900
It wasn't as much of a spectacle to watch.

43:42.900 --> 43:47.660
So not only was it not very compelling announcements, we didn't cover a lot of them because they

43:47.660 --> 43:51.280
just aren't very compelling or useful to our audience in our estimation.

43:51.280 --> 43:55.580
And then on top of it, the production quality didn't seem as good as it was, and it seems

43:55.580 --> 43:57.540
somewhat self obsessed.

43:57.540 --> 44:03.940
So do you think that's a reflection on their general feeling about third party developers?

44:03.940 --> 44:12.100
I think you could interpret it that way, but I suspect a more simpler cause is what is

44:12.100 --> 44:13.740
really at play here.

44:13.740 --> 44:21.940
I think, and Apple made inference to this, these virtual keynotes are getting so many

44:21.940 --> 44:24.060
more views.

44:24.060 --> 44:27.880
I think they said something that was like a hundred and something million views.

44:27.880 --> 44:35.780
We're talking just like way beyond the crowd that they used to focus at WWDC in the past.

44:35.780 --> 44:40.780
And I think that means they've gone to more of a general public pitch, and they're not

44:40.780 --> 44:46.500
niching down on the geeky stuff as much, so that means less time talking about developers,

44:46.500 --> 44:51.260
less time talking about how APIs are going to work, and more time talking about platform

44:51.260 --> 44:57.020
features and software features that are appealing to more people, just because of the broad

44:57.020 --> 45:00.500
scope of people that are watching these keynotes now.

45:00.500 --> 45:05.580
The State of the Union kind of covered the same stuff, but much more technical, and it

45:05.580 --> 45:07.460
started with Xcode.

45:07.460 --> 45:12.540
I kind of didn't feel like this was really a developer conference, and I don't know what

45:12.540 --> 45:13.540
to make of that.

45:13.540 --> 45:17.660
Like part of me is like, well, I'm sure they had other plans, but all the legal problems,

45:17.660 --> 45:20.540
they may be just like, you know.

45:20.540 --> 45:25.020
And maybe they had hardware plans, but the chip shortage, it's slowing them down a little

45:25.020 --> 45:26.020
bit.

45:26.020 --> 45:29.420
Yeah, I read somebody had a take, I think it was maybe Miguel de Acasa, that was super

45:29.420 --> 45:31.460
interesting to me.

45:31.460 --> 45:36.080
Maybe they didn't release any new hardware because they couldn't hit the, or rather breach

45:36.080 --> 45:39.180
the 16 gig barrier on the M1 right now.

45:39.180 --> 45:40.180
That'd be interesting.

45:40.180 --> 45:45.380
There's a lot of leaks about the new Apple silicon that's in the works.

45:45.380 --> 45:50.820
So I don't know, I bet they got to have something in the works already.

45:50.820 --> 45:52.620
It just isn't ready yet.

45:52.620 --> 45:57.580
Either way, this is why you don't get so worked up about the rumors.

45:57.580 --> 46:03.460
You and I, we talk about what's out or what's announced more than we ever talk about like

46:03.460 --> 46:08.780
the specific nitty gritty rumors in most cases because it just sometimes never materializes.

46:08.780 --> 46:13.060
And when you're buying for the Apple platform, you just got to, you got to plan for what's

46:13.060 --> 46:17.640
available today and you shouldn't buy something hoping that it'll do something it doesn't

46:17.640 --> 46:18.640
do today.

46:18.640 --> 46:23.540
Like people that bought the iPad M1, the new iPad pro, hoping that Apple was going to do

46:23.540 --> 46:26.660
something to justify 16 gigs of RAM in that thing.

46:26.660 --> 46:28.660
I don't think they answered that.

46:28.660 --> 46:32.420
I think you, if you bought your iPad pro hoping that it was going to get more useful with

46:32.420 --> 46:40.380
iOS 15, it got moderately more useful, but you didn't get $500 more useful, right?

46:40.380 --> 46:44.220
And so that's, that's the, that's the gotcha with the Apple platform is you got to kind

46:44.220 --> 46:46.620
of plan for what they've, what they've announced today.

46:46.620 --> 46:49.860
And you know, some of the new features and some of the new things they won't even tell

46:49.860 --> 46:52.500
you until they introduce the new hardware that supports them.

46:52.500 --> 46:53.660
So what do you, what do you think?

46:53.660 --> 46:56.500
Is this a win or a loss for Apple in WWDC?

46:56.500 --> 46:59.460
I mean, it's a boring WWDC.

46:59.460 --> 47:04.900
It's a nice platform update for users as the Linux observer looking in at this event.

47:04.900 --> 47:10.440
I say to myself, I'd really like, really like my free software platforms to have something

47:10.440 --> 47:11.820
like share play.

47:11.820 --> 47:14.860
I'd really like to have something like the focus mode.

47:14.860 --> 47:18.740
I think it would be pretty great to have some of these features built into my OS that have

47:18.740 --> 47:19.740
been Sherlocked.

47:19.740 --> 47:21.120
I have to be honest with you.

47:21.120 --> 47:22.660
Some of this stuff is nice.

47:22.660 --> 47:27.260
The synergy KVM across multiple devices thing.

47:27.260 --> 47:30.380
I think it'd be so cool if plasma built that in.

47:30.380 --> 47:34.540
It seems like a killer feature for plasma desktop, but there's nobody really driving

47:34.540 --> 47:35.780
that kind of stuff.

47:35.780 --> 47:41.060
And ultimately the Siri changes with offline transcription and offline voice recognition

47:41.060 --> 47:44.860
are going to be things that I use on a daily basis when I'm traveling with my family.

47:44.860 --> 47:49.260
So this stuff for me, it makes the Apple platform more appealing to me.

47:49.260 --> 47:55.740
There just isn't hardware right now that kind of fits my use case that, you know, I'm, I'm,

47:55.740 --> 48:01.380
I'm not always pushing my machines, but when I do push them, I want something that's more

48:01.380 --> 48:03.500
capable than what Apple currently offers.

48:03.500 --> 48:06.020
And they didn't solve that problem for me today.

48:06.020 --> 48:07.500
So I saved myself some money.

48:07.500 --> 48:12.820
I don't buy any hardware and I, I remain a satisfied Linux user today, but looking over

48:12.820 --> 48:17.580
my shoulder going, God, some of that stuff, I mean, like I got into earlier in the show

48:17.580 --> 48:20.180
could really make a quality of life improvement for me.

48:20.180 --> 48:22.760
The betas are going out right now for developers.

48:22.760 --> 48:27.540
If you are signed up and you've paid the hundred dollars, well, you get rewarded by getting

48:27.540 --> 48:29.820
access to the betas right now.

48:29.820 --> 48:34.100
And then the public gets a free betas next month.

48:34.100 --> 48:39.020
And then the final versions will release in the fall and we'll have links to a bunch of

48:39.020 --> 48:41.780
this stuff in the show notes if you guys want to read more.

48:41.780 --> 48:44.380
But what about you, Mr. Dominic, does it change anything for you?

48:44.380 --> 48:46.740
Does it make you want to make an app?

48:46.740 --> 48:49.420
Does it make you a satisfied Apple user?

48:49.420 --> 48:50.420
No changes.

48:50.420 --> 48:54.220
You're kind of swaying me on that, on that notification stuff.

48:54.220 --> 48:57.860
If that actually works, I'm a little, I'm still skeptical, but I see your point.

48:57.860 --> 48:58.860
Yeah.

48:58.860 --> 48:59.860
Yeah.

48:59.860 --> 49:06.500
I, I have some long-term concerns about the future of Mac OS relative to iPad, but that

49:06.500 --> 49:09.060
always seems like it's five years out and who knows, right?

49:09.060 --> 49:10.060
Yeah.

49:10.060 --> 49:13.460
And they're moving the iPad so slow that if it is coming for the Mac, you're going to

49:13.460 --> 49:17.220
see it two, three years ahead of time because it's going to take them that long just to

49:17.220 --> 49:19.900
finally finish the job.

49:19.900 --> 49:21.300
That's really sad.

49:21.300 --> 49:26.260
You know, I mean, they build these, I mean the display and the M1 chip and that tiny

49:26.260 --> 49:31.460
little iPad and they really just did nothing to really take advantage of it.

49:31.460 --> 49:32.460
We'll see.

49:32.460 --> 49:33.460
Maybe I'm wrong.

49:33.460 --> 49:35.220
Maybe I should try out the multitasking stuff.

49:35.220 --> 49:36.520
