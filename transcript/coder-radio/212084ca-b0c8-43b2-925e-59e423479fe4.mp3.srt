00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
This is KOTOR Radio, episode 486 for October 3rd, 2022.

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Hey good buddy, welcome into Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show.

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Taking a pragmatic look at the art and the business of software development and the world of technology.

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Live from Sacramento, California, my name is Chris and joining us, hopefully from his place intact, it's our host,

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Mr. Dominic. Hello Mike.

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
What's up? I am not dead.

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
No, the roof remains, eh?

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:41,000
The roof remains. And, sadly, my backyard swimming pool, I don't have a swimming pool, but I did for about two days,

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
has receded backward from whence it came.

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Thank you for all the well wishes. I tried to keep folks updated who were asking, but, you know, I was very lucky.

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
So, can we talk about the Popo real fast?

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Yeah, oh yeah, tell me about it, I'm curious.

13
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I believe that the reason I did not lose power was because I am on the evacuation grid with the Popo in the emergency center.

14
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Oh yeah, I used to live on a hospital grid, that is the best.

15
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
They keep that, they don't care, right?

16
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:17,000
So, it was very, we were very fortunate, a lot of folks down here did, I took a walk this morning, I'm going to post them to Twitter.

17
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:23,000
There's like a footbridge right outside my house, a tree, two trees actually, literally crushed it.

18
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Wow.

19
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Like big, you know, I don't know what kind of trees, I'm not, you know.

20
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
You're not a tree expert, a treeologist.

21
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I'm not an arborist or whatever that is, but literally smashed it, so we got extremely lucky.

22
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:45,000
It was some intense stuff and, you know, heart goes out to all the folks over in Naples and Fort Myers who really got shellacked.

23
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
People worry, you know, because you're our Florida man on the JB Network.

24
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:56,000
We're a Florida man, I mean, maybe it's time to, I don't know, stop subsidizing crap that destroys the environment.

25
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Just saying, as a guy who just had to deal with this.

26
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Yeah, man.

27
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Oof.

28
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I don't have to deal with those kinds of storms, but I feel like once in my lifetime I'll probably have to deal with a massive earthquake over here on the Pacific Coast one day.

29
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I feel like that's worse.

30
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Yeah, probably.

31
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I think you're probably right.

32
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:20,000
You know, today is not only is it a special episode because you survived another Florida storm, but it's also episode 486.

33
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Nice.

34
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I'm such a nerd.

35
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I have been waiting for episode 486 forever.

36
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
That's the number I keep.

37
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
This is your moment.

38
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
This is my moment.

39
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:37,000
And I just wanted to go back in time really briefly and play a 486 commercial that really focused on the upgradability of the Intel 486.

40
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Oh, Lord.

41
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Want to run all your software fast?

42
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Then look for the Intel Inside symbol on your next computer.

43
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,000
It says you got a real power source on the inside.

44
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Like the upgradable Intel 486 microprocessor.

45
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Power it up and run your software at light speed.

46
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Intel, the computer inside.

47
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Yeah, you got to get that 486 goodness, man.

48
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
You got to have the 486.

49
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:18,000
There was also a commercial at the time, and I wanted to play this because it is brilliant for the specs.

50
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Listen to the specs.

51
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
This guy rattles off about his fancy new PC he's buying in the early 90s.

52
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
It's it's adorable.

53
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I got a Packard Bell 486 SX, 20 megahertz. I got a hard drive with 100 megabytes to make the memory. I got a monitor, it's super VGA and a printer, 24 pin.

54
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I got accessories and software like Windows and Lotus works.

55
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:48,000
You put it all together just before you're 98.

56
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
That's what it's all about.

57
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Yeah, man.

58
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Isn't that something? Super VGA.

59
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I don't know why that one caught me particularly.

60
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
100 megabyte hard drive.

61
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
That's a lot.

62
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I know.

63
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
One day you'll have that in your pocket and one day that'll be what it cost to open CNN.

64
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Yeah, right.

65
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
You know, that's why I just I don't know.

66
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:21,000
486 is such a I remember I think in part that was really when I came into like recognizing there was different processors and computers and that different processors were faster and started to pay attention a lot more during the 40s.

67
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Six era.

68
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,000
And I felt it was kind of appropriate that you found this Aqua EMAX or Aqua Max.

69
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Aqua Max, baby.

70
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
It looks like it's from this era, man.

71
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
They've updated the copyright on their project as of 2022.

72
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
So I think they're still actually actively developing it.

73
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
But the thing is like retro.

74
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Yeah. So so when I first started running Mac OS, I was a budding EMAX user and then I was quickly slapped around.

75
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
We told the story a couple weeks ago and picked up them.

76
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
But this is the EMAX client I used.

77
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
And the reason I'll put it in the show notes because I forgot to do that this morning.

78
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:01,000
But the reason I put it in is there is a pretty passionate hacker news thread of EMAX users.

79
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Just saying, like, we're here and I have to tell you, Chris, I've gotten the DMS.

80
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
They are they are here.

81
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
We see you.

82
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
We love you.

83
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
We're not talking about this anymore.

84
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:19,000
No, no more, unless unless one of them ends or like, you know, like an EMAX contributor shoots a contributor.

85
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Please don't do that or vice versa.

86
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Please don't do that.

87
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
It's we get it.

88
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
You're there.

89
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Respect. Check out Aqua Max.

90
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I get it. You can live in EMAX.

91
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Check out Aqua Max.

92
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
If you're on the Mac, the best part of Aqua Max is it looks like Snow Leopard.

93
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:38,000
So yeah, it's that classic, classic Mac OS look.

94
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,520
look oh man I sincerely wish we had never mentioned Vim or Emacs on this

95
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:47,000
show yeah yeah that was a mistake you know what else it was also a mistake to

96
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,000
admit that I was gonna try a new Android ROM but I'm here for it I'm ready for it

97
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,320
Francis writes in and says check out Calyx you should check out Calyx OS or

98
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:59,220
Calyx I'm not sure how you pronounce it C A L Y X Calyx OS sounds a lot like

99
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:02,980
Calyx though wait a minute I like this and it's only for pixel devices I

100
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:06,640
believe it's an alternative to something like main Android or graphene they both

101
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:10,880
have a similar niche but Calyx or Calyx has a built-in firewall I've been using

102
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:14,960
I'm very happy and Sasha wrote in and said I recently got a pixel 5 and I

103
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:19,480
loaded up with Calyx OS and it's been great unlike graphene Calyx OS comes

104
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:23,280
with micro G which means I can still install Play Store apps via the Aurora

105
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:28,320
Store app they also use an app called shelter there's been some paper cuts but

106
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:33,200
so far they like it a lot and it's still a Google phone to some degree but it's a

107
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:38,000
better compromise I of course put on graphene OS on my pixel device recently

108
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,720
so now that I've put on graphene OS I'm hearing from everybody that I should be

109
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:44,000
using Calyx OS which is exactly what happened back in the day when I used to

110
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,040
put ROMs on my old Android devices I would do it and then immediately be told

111
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:50,400
by everybody that I use the wrong ROM when I should try out this totally

112
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:57,160
different ROM and it feels like I'm right back in that again however I do

113
00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:02,300
feel like perhaps what it is is that graphene OS skews more towards the

114
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:06,240
privacy conscious and I think there's a spectrum here and I think the Calyx

115
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:10,800
folks are maybe more traditionally lineage type lineage type folks that

116
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,760
they want to they want a lot of the functionality of their smartphone they

117
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:17,960
just want to be a little bit more removed from Google where graphene OS

118
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:24,440
has taken some plumbing improvements like they're using se Linux to sandbox

119
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:29,400
Google Play and the Google Play services so you can actually install Google Play

120
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:34,560
services in the Google Play Store on graphene OS run them in a sandbox that

121
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:39,600
prevents access outside of that sandbox where on Calyx or Calyx or however you

122
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:44,200
say it they're using micro G which is a port it's a re-implementation of the

123
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:51,160
play API and it's partially open source I believe and there is a aspect of it

124
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:55,840
that runs highly privileged in the system app domain like the regular play

125
00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:00,040
services whereas with graphene OS everything is sandboxed and they're

126
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:04,920
running they play services at a lower privilege level that is enforced by se

127
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:08,720
Linux so that's my big understanding of the two but there is a whole underbelly

128
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:13,920
here I scratched accidentally there's a lot of people out there that are getting

129
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:19,320
pixel devices and then they're free flashing them which is just not what you

130
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:21,760
expect right you think that's what people buy other devices for but they're

131
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:26,040
getting the flagship device and they're reflashing it well kind of makes sense

132
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:30,080
right there's no carry or nonsense on the pixel if you buy it from Google I

133
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:34,120
think mmm right well if you flash it doesn't even matter you wipe it out

134
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:39,240
anyway so yeah okay yeah I guess I could see that right it's probably one of the

135
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:43,560
easier devices at this point because used to have manufacturers that would

136
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:47,280
make devices for that community and they've kind of backed off from that

137
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:51,160
hmm and they're decent phones so you're gonna stick with it I think I'll use

138
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:54,240
graphene for a while I've been pretty happy now that I got the play services

139
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:57,800
on there and you need the play store if any app has an in-app purchase basically

140
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:03,360
you know so that's where I got hung up I had an I had I wanted to put photo sync

141
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:08,800
on there and to get access to the cloud services I I needed to pay for it and so

142
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:12,320
I was like that started a whole process and then if you have an eSIM you need

143
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:16,080
the play services to activate the eSIM to really basically hooked it into

144
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:20,400
everything oh yeah so that's okay you know we've kind of dropped the Android

145
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:23,840
play services thread but I remember years ago we used to talk about how oh

146
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:26,480
no they're putting more stuff in play services so now it's like you want to

147
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:31,680
activate your SIM gotta have those play services yeah yeah okay yep and eSIMs

148
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:36,960
are really taken off now yep so I'm not a huge fan of that I I think graphene OS

149
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:41,240
is a little more secure too in the way it launches processes so overall it's

150
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:43,760
like if you're trying to get away from Google it seems like that's the way to

151
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:47,960
go to me and I'm I think I'm missing something because Calix obviously has a

152
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:50,680
lot of people that like it and I know the founder has a little bit of a

153
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:54,960
celebrity around him for Calix and I think that might be playing a factor as

154
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:58,840
well but I can't quite tell I'm such a noob to all of this that I'm kind of

155
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:02,840
discovering it as I dive in and then people tell me oh but did you try which

156
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:07,520
is exactly what happens on Linux you know try a boon to all you better get

157
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:12,700
Zeus tell me about it so so I have two side tangents here because that's why we

158
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:17,000
waste our time running show notes one did you see you probably didn't cuz

159
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:22,480
you're on the road that very quietly very sneakily Apple announced that they

160
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:26,400
can no longer activate the data plan and you can no longer hotspot just through

161
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:31,280
the iPad settings app on iPads oh no that was like a great feature you got to

162
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:35,200
go talk to those carriers but that was great I used to use it so this is like

163
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:40,000
you know back do you remember the old days Chris when you could travel freely

164
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:46,800
stay a while and listen all levels of Tristam yeah I used to take an iPad

165
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:52,200
because no matter what I could have connectivity and if at the time I was a

166
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:56,840
t-mobile customer and you know they were t-mobile I know they're better now but

167
00:10:56,840 --> 00:11:01,460
if they suck I would just do the one month like $30 Verizon thing and be

168
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:05,800
like whatever I'll do Verizon while I'm in usually like Colorado or North

169
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:09,400
Carolina somewhere like that and you could do it all from the settings app

170
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:13,360
inside that just right there right so even if my phone which had t-mobile

171
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:16,800
service was crappy well I had this Verizon connection in a pinch if I had

172
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:21,280
the tether or whatever and I never had to talk to a sales rep this was the key

173
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:27,400
right I get locked into some other plan those were the days yeah that was nice

174
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:31,720
I'm sure it must have been carrier pressure over time to get rid of that

175
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:35,680
yeah they feel like the carriers hated that it's funny how those things quietly

176
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:40,920
happen because you're right I had not seen that yeah turds yeah try to sneak

177
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:44,120
it in that's probably all my thoughts on graph you know it's because I'm still so

178
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:47,760
new I'm still trying to learn so do let me know I mean it's getting to be a bit

179
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:50,120
much but I would like to know your thoughts on what I brought up today

180
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:55,160
coder dot show slash contact or you can boost it in but then just a little PSA

181
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:58,840
our last meetup on this West Coast tour is happening the Friday that this

182
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:04,200
episode goes out so coming up on the 6th of October in Portland we have our last

183
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:08,520
meetup meetup comm slash Jupiter broadcasting and I'm heading home kind

184
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:13,640
of sad but also relieved from a technical standpoint this road trip has

185
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:18,120
been very hard probably hard enough that this is the last road trip like this I'm

186
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:22,360
ever gonna do so this is the end of an era in some ways and the last meetup of

187
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:26,160
that era I'm gonna come up with something else but I think I'm done

188
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,920
doing this format I mean you know what I thought this is gonna be the one Mike I

189
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:34,120
thought this would be road trip by the numbers because listener Jeff has been

190
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:38,640
an MVP of this road trip he set us up with a great parking spot at his place

191
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:43,320
in Sacramento with power and most importantly of course it's secure and it

192
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:48,400
could be locked up why we went down to Pasadena and internet he gave us Ethernet

193
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:51,320
so I thought geez this is gonna be we're gonna we're gonna be we're gonna be

194
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:54,400
stationary I'm gonna have Ethernet connectivity I'm gonna have power

195
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:59,560
hookups what could go wrong right instead I had multiple devices fail in

196
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:04,960
the studio that I rely on and then I had a software update here in the RV that

197
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:08,240
happened in the background and changed the functionality of one of my

198
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:11,920
applications so you can no longer select the input and output for audio devices

199
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:16,920
which was a fundamental feature that I used and then of course we had routing

200
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:21,480
problems and all it just has been it has been a nightmare an absolute nightmare

201
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:24,720
so I think this is the last one I'm gonna do and I'll come up with a new

202
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:28,560
I'll come up with a new way to get out and see folks in the future so meetup

203
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:33,280
comm slash Jupiter broadcasting for the last meetup on the West Coast Road tour

204
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:36,880
and probably the last meetup of this type of trip I think that's just

205
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:41,200
probably the way it's got to go just the way it is as they say and that West

206
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:45,360
Coast room will continue the West Coast crew at on our matrix server at bit.ly

207
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:50,640
slash West Coast crew that'll remain and as we figure out future events and stuff

208
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:55,080
like that we'll let people in the area know in there so check that out too well

209
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:59,400
we all saw this one coming but I think it still is worth mentioning and

210
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:03,840
analyzing a little bit Google has announced that they'll be winding down

211
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:10,720
stadia in January 2023 and TechCrunch wrote a piece and I completely agree

212
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:17,560
that says stadia died because no one trusts Google they say it's that simple

213
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:23,320
it's a kind of like the writing was on the wall when stadia launched Google has

214
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:26,800
exhibited such a poor understanding of what people want they write what they

215
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:31,000
need and will pay for at this point that people are wary of investing even its

216
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:38,760
more popular products I think you probably agree with that I don't

217
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:45,240
actually I mean I I do agree you shouldn't trust Google but I think there

218
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:50,720
are just two fundamental flaws kind of higher level have you seen the state of

219
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:54,800
high-speed internet in the u.s. yeah like this is not a stadia specific

220
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:59,600
problem but until you know the dragon that is Comcast and all the other ISPs

221
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:04,280
are somehow forced to be dumb pipes where this is all you know made into a

222
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:10,320
utility a la municipal bit of fire was effectively right fiber optics I don't

223
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:13,800
think folks outside the u.s. particularly folks who have better

224
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:18,680
internet like South Korea and much of Europe can really understand just how

225
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:23,600
the situation is here I'm pretty lucky that I live in a place where for some

226
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:27,360
insane reason Verizon used to be here and laid a fiber optic line and now some

227
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:31,960
company called frontier is happy to sell it to me but they're not making more

228
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:35,360
we've talked about it before but this is a huge problem right the city of New

229
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:39,960
York paid Verizon and I'm not just picking on Verizon but they're easy

230
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:45,640
target to fiber up all of New York City and Verizon just like didn't do it right

231
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:48,520
it just turned out that it's too hard too much money and there's lots of

232
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:53,840
arguments about regulations and why does it cost you know to build a mile of road

233
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:57,240
in the u.s. is like five times what it costs anywhere else and the answer is

234
00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:03,920
because you can sue anyone for any reason and that's probably bad regardless

235
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:09,480
of why the fact is the we still have internet caps in a lot of places many

236
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:13,600
places have just one provider who gives you the crappiest service possible and

237
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:19,880
that's just a challenge for streaming gaming the other thing I think is kind

238
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:27,800
of I guess maybe misguided here is the problem if you're a VP at Google is you

239
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:34,760
need to make an impact on the scale of Adsense and search and YouTube it might

240
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:39,200
probably just wasn't worth it right these guys are careerists these are

241
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:44,840
business guys they're not you know they're not like super into the tech

242
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:50,640
side of things maybe we can take a flashback in time when I was a kid I got

243
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:55,880
the Sega Channel and I don't are you familiar with this at all Chris is it a

244
00:16:55,880 --> 00:17:00,800
channel no no I don't think I am this is an ancient precursor to this game

245
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:05,920
streaming stuff that was run over coax it was a partnership between Sega of

246
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:11,840
America and I think Cox cable okay and it was literally this idea you put this

247
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:17,280
thing in your Genesis they ran a coax line and you could play a wide library

248
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:21,340
of Sega games because at the time Sega would just pitch the publishers a little

249
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:25,320
bit of money and they're like yeah sure we'll let you do this because nobody had

250
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:30,560
it it worked fine because they were 16-bit games Wow this is back in 94 I'd

251
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:34,440
never even heard of this yeah this was in the in the mid 90s things have

252
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:38,400
changed quite a bit right and the reason I didn't have it for very long is

253
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:43,280
because they canceled it they canceled it meaning Sega and and whatever thing I

254
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:47,400
think it was Cox it was Cox or cable vision at the time I can't remember but

255
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:56,040
this idea is one not new and it always hits the same problem of the ISPs do not

256
00:17:56,040 --> 00:18:02,240
want to give you the bandwidth you need because they simply don't have to right

257
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:06,400
in his bandwidth paying performance all that stuff reliability a lot of folks

258
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:12,440
down here are realizing after Ian that oh it turns out if there's only one ISP

259
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:15,680
in the neighborhood they're kind of not you know paying over time and double

260
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:20,160
timing it to get you back connected right right which is you know this is

261
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:24,280
I'll put on my little commie hat which my inner my inner elephant will die a

262
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:30,440
little bit but if something is essential it's not a product it's a utility right

263
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:35,240
this this is probably just a utility and if you look at some other countries the

264
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:38,640
reason they don't have this set of problems is because they treat

265
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:43,320
connectivity and my mind correctly as either a pure utility or a pseudo

266
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:47,120
utility yeah we definitely seem like we've crossed that threshold yeah oh I

267
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:51,560
mean kids were going through school over the internet right that that should have

268
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:54,440
been just like it that's the line it's over there's this should not be a

269
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:59,400
for-profit or utilities are technically for-profit but you know it regulated

270
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:03,960
best service minimal price industry what that said you solve the problem of it

271
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:07,520
was never gonna be big enough for the VP that ran this or whatever the guy's

272
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:11,960
title is to actually care right if you're at Google and you want to advance

273
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:17,240
you need to be in you know Adsense search YouTube right maybe if you're

274
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:21,520
lucky you can use this to parlay your way into a more influential position

275
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:27,400
right God it's horrible but you're probably right I think too on top of

276
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:32,240
that so there's the aspect of just really poor internet connectivity in the

277
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:37,720
states which is the primary market for this thing but additionally you have on

278
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:41,680
the flip side maybe folks that are living in the cities or living where

279
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:45,520
connectivity is is really quite good maybe they have gigabit things like that

280
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:49,820
well then they're probably more in a position to buy a gaming console or to

281
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:54,440
build a gaming PC right so then where you have perhaps really great

282
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:57,360
connectivity you kind of have this issue where they already have the gear they

283
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:00,720
want they've already bought their games on Steam or from Nintendo and so they're

284
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:05,560
not really the ideal customer either so there's just this middle customer that

285
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:09,960
is I think like what you're saying a pretty small niche here well also from

286
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:12,640
let's just assume you have the connectivity like you're saying like I

287
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:17,040
was a stadia customer but it never made sense you you have to stream it plus by

288
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:20,960
the game you could buy for two hundred and something dollars I mean 300 bucks

289
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:25,880
whatever it is an Xbox s and then 10 bucks a month you get Xbox Game Pass 15

290
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:30,360
you get Game Pass Ultimate and not only did it work better that was it you just

291
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:34,320
it was like Netflix for gaming right yeah that I think was a killer too for

292
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:39,680
stadia was just having to pay 60 bucks for a game for a service you knew

293
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:45,320
inevitably was gonna die but now speaking to that though Google has kind

294
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:50,400
of done the right thing here and they've offered full refunds on the stadia

295
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:53,480
hardware if anybody bought the controller or the chromecast ultra and

296
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:58,520
games they bought which I did yeah I'm happy yeah I mean I guess why it's not a

297
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:04,920
big controversy right now it's also well you should have seen Twitter it's also

298
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:09,080
quite the admission that yeah we were just shooting this you know back of the

299
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:14,880
shed yeah you have a link to on live in here and that's the name that's the name

300
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:18,400
young Luke I haven't heard and I mean I've wanted this for a long time we've

301
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:22,920
all wanted this yeah I was an online user back in like 2012 when they were

302
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:26,160
you know I think it was like 2010 2011 somewhere in there they launched the

303
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:31,320
beta and I got in on that oh man and I even liked that I have always wanted

304
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:36,720
this as a Linux user who wants access to more games I've wanted this because this

305
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:40,160
seemed like a viable solution and then when stadia came along and they're like

306
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:43,440
we're gonna stream you games but you got a portrait games to Linux and Vulcan I

307
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:47,080
thought well maybe the weight of Google and the popularity if they integrate it

308
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:50,000
with something like YouTube or if they could integrate it with some of their

309
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,040
more popular products it was one-click link and now you're in stadium you're

310
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:56,320
gaming you don't have to buy anything that would have taken off like wildfire

311
00:21:56,320 --> 00:22:00,640
I thought but they didn't go that way and they didn't inevitably convince very

312
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:03,840
many developers to port their games to Linux or Vulcan and then at the same

313
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:10,720
time valve came along with proton and an improved gaming experience on Linux and

314
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:16,680
then the deck and it just sort of made stadia seem pointless the only thing

315
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:21,560
funny about it Mike is that even just two months ago stadia's Twitter account

316
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:25,400
was assuring people that were tweeting them that they were in fact not shutting

317
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:32,160
down no worries there they said international corporations never lie

318
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:37,960
yeah I guess they were so cocky when they launched it Google just had the

319
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:42,360
Dreamcast and the Sega Saturn and those consoles like on display at the Google

320
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:47,160
campus as like consoles are really dead now they're never coming back after this

321
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:49,880
you won't believe what we're about to announce and they have these glass

322
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:53,520
displays of these failed consoles on their front lawn where they usually have

323
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:57,920
the Android statues in in anticipation of the launch before they made their

324
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:03,240
announcement I just want to say as a Sega fan like lifelong Sega fan if

325
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:09,400
you're copying Sega's console business strategy you're you've made a horrible

326
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:13,800
mistake in fact when they picked up that Dreamcast and that Saturn they should

327
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:21,160
have said wait a minute this seems bad why are we doing this because the

328
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:24,760
Dreamcast came out with this Sega started this with the Sega Channel on

329
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:29,000
the Genesis we're gonna pretend the 32x doesn't exist because it you know nobody

330
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:33,160
bought it it was me and two other guys the Dreamcast was the first online

331
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:38,560
gaming network that was a console it plugged into your 56k modem it was a

332
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:43,800
partnership with it was epics internet or earth link I can't remember but

333
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:52,560
somebody can fact-check me and it failed for basically the same reasons like

334
00:23:52,560 --> 00:24:00,000
saying has been trying to do this since 94 trust me I was there I was working my

335
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:09,200
teenage job to get a damn Dreamcast I'm so sad right now never mind so the Wall

336
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:13,200
Street Journal written by Christopher Mims over there has a piece called the

337
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:20,180
next battle between Google and Apple is for the soul of your car and actually

338
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:26,400
makes a pretty good case that this is heating up essentially Tesla and some

339
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:30,320
other mobile car creators are basically mobile phone makers now but other car

340
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:35,760
creators have really upped their game on the infotainment and so it is now the

341
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:39,260
number one requested feature when customers go to buy a new car if you

342
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:44,440
can believe it is Apple CarPlay or Google Android auto support and the

343
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:51,680
infotainment system is now the number one source of consumer complaints about

344
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:56,720
new car issues is the crappy infotainment systems and so you have this

345
00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:01,640
situation where the car manufacturers are feeling more and more pressure to

346
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:05,920
let Google and Apple in to solve this problem for them and of course Google's

347
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:10,440
solution involves Android automotive which is which is more extensive than

348
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:14,360
Android auto same similar name I read real similar name very dumb but Android

349
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:19,240
automotive is a full car OS that takes over everything and Google has announced

350
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:25,480
partnerships with a dozen automakers including Honda BMW Nissan General Motors

351
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:30,640
the Chevy brands and Apple has announced a dozen launch partners for their next

352
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:34,880
generation of CarPlay which isn't a whole OS but is an expanded version of

353
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:38,480
CarPlay that likely depends that on car manufacturers meeting certain

354
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:43,600
requirements and those include Volvo Ford Honda Mercedes Porsche and others

355
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:50,240
and we got a little tease of Apple's whole scheme at WWDC where they showed

356
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:54,240
that CarPlay software taking over the entire instrument cluster from the over

357
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:59,000
the entire dash with your gas gauge or your charge gauge and your RPMs and your

358
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:03,200
speed all of that gets taken over by CarPlay now but they haven't yet

359
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:08,800
announced a dedicated OS and it would seem kind of out of character for Apple

360
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:14,040
to actually license an OS yeah that's just not really their style it's more

361
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:17,400
like the manufacturer will have to build to a spec and then Apple will sell them

362
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:22,960
the OS yeah sit down kill Emilio no one's asking you yeah this is like a

363
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:28,480
whole new OS war that is brewing and what scares me about it is that people

364
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:33,200
making the decisions historically are horrible at software they do suck it's

365
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:38,600
true where does this take us when you have companies that are building devices

366
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:44,600
that can kill us that are essential and have a horrible history at software and

367
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:50,520
UI and now they have to try to bridge this gap and in some cases like Volvo

368
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:56,600
and others they're gonna have their own OS as well so you have Volvo car dot OS

369
00:26:56,600 --> 00:27:04,360
which will be running Android automotive in an emulator great and so you and then

370
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:08,040
you also have like the ECM and you have the other car computer modules that are

371
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:11,240
also separate but maybe has Volvo software on it that ties it together

372
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:17,320
follow us that then like runs I guess an API set that Android automotive can talk

373
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:22,040
to but the whole thing like it sounds horrible it sounds like it sounds like a

374
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:28,040
massively complicated software stack in a car and that sounds dangerous to me

375
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:32,280
and I'm wondering if you feel the same way if you feel opposite if you have any

376
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:39,040
thoughts on this I mean I'm not sure that we need this but you know I drive a

377
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:44,240
Chevy let me tell you what happens I look at the non-digital gauges and I'm

378
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:50,160
very happy with that I plug in my iPhone and it does the carplay thing on the you

379
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:54,560
know the dash I will tell you when I don't look into my iPhone whatever

380
00:27:54,560 --> 00:28:01,720
horrible operating system Chevrolet has or GM has put on that it's crap oh so

381
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:06,400
bad it's so bad it get like even things like tuning FM radio stations were

382
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:10,400
easier on my old Chevy that did not have any of this crap right that was just

383
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:14,200
like it was knobs remember knobs knobs were great mm-hmm

384
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:20,080
we had a real-world problem in in my house of I have so much Apple stuff that

385
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:23,880
we're basically incentivized to always buy the Apple accessory for something

386
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:29,240
or the Apple compatible accessory right ecosystem so is your car gonna be one of

387
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:33,200
these things now to where it's like well I have an Apple watch and and I have an

388
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:36,600
iPhone and I could see like Apple's going into this car crash detection will

389
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:42,440
it work better if you have an Apple OS powered car I would I would imagine so

390
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:46,360
right hmm I hadn't even thought of the fact that safety features like that

391
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:49,960
could be a thing yeah you're right what if I run a car that's running Android OS

392
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:54,000
but you know I just rent which I used to do all the time before kovat right in a

393
00:28:54,000 --> 00:29:00,600
strange city rent a car right now the situation is most modernist cars that I

394
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:04,200
rent I can plug in my iPhone and I have my familiar interface my maps save

395
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:09,200
destinations all that if I do that in a car running Android OS there's Google

396
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:13,800
gonna make a deal with the manufacturer to not allow carplay on that car right

397
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:19,960
to somehow block that screen right I don't know I feel like if you wanted to

398
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:25,440
innovate somewhere with vehicles this is me I see why they want to do it because

399
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:30,720
it's more of like a luxury thing that they can charge for but how about full

400
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:39,600
electrification right I know that's hard but life is hard you can do it and don't

401
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:42,840
worry if you're GM if you fail the government will just like make let you

402
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:46,600
do some weird crazy bankruptcy that nobody else gets to do so there's that

403
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:50,640
right of course and if you're Ford you'll realize that the government's

404
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:54,880
gonna punish you and you'll somehow not file bankruptcy right I'm just saying I

405
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:59,600
don't know they have little downside risk they can they can kind of afford to

406
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:03,960
screw around with this a little bit but I feel like their failure to do a good

407
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:07,840
job here has created a market opportunity for Google and Apple no it

408
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:13,080
also is gonna screw over local mechanics but this is yet another thing totally

409
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:17,880
proprietary totally computerized I was thinking about it to it and I don't

410
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:20,960
know maybe there's just no getting around this but you know I just got done

411
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:25,600
putting graphene OS on my pixel as an effort to see what's the downside of

412
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:28,480
moving away from Google services and trying to replace them with my own

413
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:32,200
things like next cloud and graphene OS and it'd just be kind of funny to kind

414
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:36,560
of go through this multi-year process of de googling just to end up buying a car

415
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:41,940
that forces me to use a Google OS that would really suck and then I realized

416
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:45,800
it's a very first world problem but it's gonna be a problem like I'm gonna I'm

417
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:49,560
actively trying to send this company less of my information and then the

418
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:53,800
auto manufacturer comes along and just sells me a $70,000 car or whatever with

419
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:57,640
Google stuff built in I just don't know about that you're right I like the idea

420
00:30:57,640 --> 00:31:02,240
that's on a removable upgradable device my phone gets upgraded very frequently

421
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:07,220
my car does not and I've always preferred to have the computing in a

422
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:09,800
little separate module I doesn't need to be wireless it doesn't need to be that

423
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:13,640
fancy I don't mind plugging it in to let it charge to let it have fast

424
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:17,600
connectivity and then like you said all of my saved data that I want to use

425
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:22,160
comes up on the screen and that works just fine I also think it's a little

426
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:25,960
alarming as we just build in more and more layers of complexity that we're not

427
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:31,440
really requiring these companies to I don't know prove that they can build

428
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:38,000
these things first like they just ship it and my wife has a 2013 I think Ford

429
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:46,200
Focus and the sync software on the 2013 Ford Focus feels like alpha crap it is

430
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:51,800
busted by design it is horrible I've talked to other focus owners they hate

431
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:58,000
it and it got better in later years but it took them years and years and years

432
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:02,960
of iterating before it got very usable and it's not like they issue updates to

433
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:06,960
the old cars so my wife's driving around with what is basically she was a beta

434
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:13,080
tester for Microsoft sync and you know that car is it's a frustrating car

435
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:16,880
because of sync it's such a silly thing to have like the motor works fine

436
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:21,080
everything mechanically about the car is fine but sync drives us crazy every day

437
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:25,320
yeah I cannot tell you how desperate my chef is to get me to subscribe to on

438
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:32,920
star it's just bad I mean there's are all just horrible horrible systems and

439
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:36,200
there's a reason everybody goes in and plugs in their iPhone or their pixel or

440
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:40,440
whatever let me flip it around on you though so what if this happens let's

441
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:43,760
just take it down the road a bit too when we work so we work some of this out

442
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:46,400
because you know like some automakers they're not even they're opting to go

443
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:52,560
their own route entirely like a few of them are gonna be integrating the Amazon

444
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:54,880
echo stuff into the car which that just sounds horrible

445
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:59,360
great I hate voice commands in the car so much but let's just say we get down

446
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:06,440
the road this stuff gets sorted out and we land on a Google Apple future in my

447
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:13,280
opinion Google loses this because ultimately this kind of product lives

448
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:20,520
and dies on the consumer feedback and preferences and if this sync system

449
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:24,480
that's in my wife's car somehow like big had become like some sort of standard

450
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:29,680
there was on a dozen different car manufacturers systems they would have

451
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:33,240
suffered in sales I mean there's a reason why sync never took off Microsoft

452
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:37,560
tried this like if they always do Microsoft was early they tried this they

453
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:41,720
tried to get other manufacturers to use sync but the problem was is Ford's

454
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:49,560
customers hate it and it hurt sales it cost them money so I think long term

455
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:54,280
this isn't gonna work out for Google because they can't even they can't even

456
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:57,280
properly name the products they have Android auto and Android automotive as

457
00:33:57,280 --> 00:34:01,780
we've just described with stadia they can't stick with anything and the

458
00:34:01,780 --> 00:34:06,240
reality is the car markets big but it doesn't have the scale of the web not

459
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:12,160
even close only a small part of the market especially these days will be

460
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:16,200
able to afford new cars it'll have this tech built in so it's always going to be

461
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:23,280
a small niche product and that spells doom for Google Apple I think it's a

462
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:27,000
little bit more of the roll of dice Apple can live and survive in niche land

463
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:30,640
because they design their profits and the way they organize their deals to

464
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:35,460
make money that way juicy margins exactly you got it you got to have them juicy

465
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:41,160
margins right after all it's business business no one Apple they'll do the

466
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:45,360
thing they always do all our stuff is great but this is the good and that

467
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:48,760
one's kind of you know whatever they'll leave the old plug in your iPhone and

468
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:52,440
get crappy carplay or what is current carplay and then they'll do the whatever

469
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:57,600
car OS thing and that'll be are you buying a Mercedes my friends right

470
00:34:57,600 --> 00:35:03,560
that's I mean it's Apple and also if you're Mercedes you have a BMW it's

471
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:08,120
probably BMW let's be honest you probably want to partner with Apple

472
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:12,840
because a lot of your values in your brand and your whatever like lifestyle

473
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:18,480
feeling and you know I'm at least in the US I can't I don't can't speak for the

474
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:24,640
regions but it's pretty clear that Apple is the luxury brand here totally I that

475
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:29,640
was absolutely well put this the brand Association they'll you know the car

476
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:32,720
manufacturer wants to get a little bit of that shine because Apple's like in

477
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:35,800
the top three brands of the world or something like that so they're gonna

478
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:40,000
want that shine they you know that's just how companies work but I also think

479
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:45,680
like we have the flip problem of it's one thing when Google is building

480
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:51,400
products and services for the web and they shut that down okay you know that

481
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:57,800
stinks but it's a web service will be fine but what about your 60 70 thousand

482
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:03,760
dollar car when they just kind of give up on that what are you gonna you can't

483
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:07,560
reflash it you can't put a new ROM on your car you're just stuck with

484
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:11,840
abandoned software okay so don't yeah I mean you you've just made a very strong

485
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:16,440
case to not buy a car powered by Android OS so I do think there is a little bit

486
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:20,240
of that brand factor that the stadia factor where I think everybody when

487
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:24,240
stadia was announced the first thing everybody did was wait for Google to

488
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:29,200
kill it and they I think that does affect them as a brand I think it

489
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:33,680
because it impacts the way I view this effort to hmm I mean there's really no

490
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:37,800
way for them to fix that right no they've they've it's they've done it

491
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:41,200
they've become known as the company who kills stuff I mean there's killed by

492
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:46,280
google.com right and and to be fair they're the company who they're they're

493
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:52,000
standard for big enough for us to care to keep it alive it's just stupidly high

494
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:56,120
right when you were the default search engine the default advertising network

495
00:36:56,120 --> 00:37:01,600
for the entire internet you're just in a different you know you're thinking on a

496
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:05,120
galactic scale not a not a county scale right

497
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:11,840
god bless duck duck go who knows I mean I accidentally used Bing this morning in

498
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:17,520
edge it was terrible right so yeah I don't know what to say yeah ask not

499
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:24,440
what your podcast can boost for you but what you can boost for your podcast DPG

500
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:30,840
boosts in with 2,000 sats and he says I'm boosting him to say that my upgrade

501
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:37,400
from an 11 Pro Max to a 14 Pro Max has been absolutely amazing waiting three

502
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:40,880
years seems to be the sweet spot for iPhones good luck on the road trip Chris

503
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:44,960
I hope to do a cross-country one someday and meet my wonderful internet friends

504
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:50,560
out west well that'd be amazing DPG 11 to 14 does seem like the sweet spot

505
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:54,800
that's got to be a great upgrade that's a big jump that's probably the strategy

506
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:58,600
if I wasn't on the upgrade program and that's kind of the cycle that my wife

507
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:03,120
has been on I think she's on an 11 right now and I don't know if I'm gonna get a

508
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:07,240
14 for her I mean that would be a decent Christmas present but I definitely think

509
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:11,640
she'll want the 15 just for battery life reasons and whatnot I love that you know

510
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:15,520
that's the thing about these iPhones there's always people out there that are

511
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:19,360
always gonna be upgrading so Apple might not see unbelievable numbers I don't

512
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:23,600
know if we've gotten any hints yet but there's always customers there's always

513
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:29,600
gonna be customers they'll be all right yeah I think so Dave Jones the pod sage

514
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:35,000
boosted with 2011 12 sats he writes I'm boosting the intro because I have faith

515
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:40,000
you guys are gonna deliver it boosted during the intro Dave he also double

516
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:44,880
boosted in with another two thousand one hundred and twelve sats

517
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:50,600
and he's calling me up he says barbecue in California blows it's like ordering

518
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:54,360
spaghetti and meatballs at Subway come down south and we'll get you guys taken

519
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:59,480
care of I'd love to take you up on that Dave I would love that Dave I'm already

520
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:03,960
down south I know what do you what is the is there a big barbecue culture in

521
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:07,880
Florida is there the pride about barbecue like there is in Texas and the

522
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:13,160
there it well it's not quite like Texas yeah yeah it's not quite like Texas so

523
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:17,440
the trick about Florida is the more generally speaking the more north you go

524
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:22,520
in Florida the more southern it is wait a minute the more north you go the more

525
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:26,080
southern is because you're getting closer to the southern states right

526
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:29,200
because a lot of like southern Florida like for instance go to Miami let's like

527
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:35,080
it's like Cuban food which is awesome oh yeah oh my god Cuban food this and like

528
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:38,640
I thought I'd had a Cuban sandwich and then I moved here and I had never had

529
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:41,880
one before until that day I gotta come to Florida I've been there for like two

530
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:48,040
minutes I gotta get down there it's see the problem of Florida too is it's weird

531
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:52,720
man like I'm just saying it's a lot of stuff going on down here and there's a

532
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:57,840
whole Disney area that gets real creepy like it's sounds like a party down there

533
00:39:57,840 --> 00:40:01,920
except for the storms you know but it's otherwise it just sounds like a hot mess

534
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:06,400
of parties well I know I just got a flyer from DeSantis it is now officially

535
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:10,560
known as the free state of Florida whatever the hell that means really did

536
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:16,000
they make an official like proclamation I just wanna say this is laminated like

537
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:19,120
I don't know how rich his campaign is because he's running for governor again

538
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:23,320
I have gotten lots of political crap never laminated though never like this

539
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:27,120
like I'm a dude I kind of want to hang this up except they don't because I

540
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:32,480
don't know what free state means because that sounds a lot like like Chaz

541
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:37,520
doesn't sound good right it sounds like sounds like we're gonna need a SWAT team

542
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:40,720
in here to just like clean it up and we're all gonna realize that what looked

543
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:45,560
like a protest was really never mind we're gonna move on all right yeah I

544
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:53,840
know Johnny Johnny yeah with a 2500 sats says I'm considering upgrading my

545
00:40:53,840 --> 00:41:01,120
$4,000 MacBook Pro to a $1,000 dev one thanks guys you know John I think you

546
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:05,000
can muddle through I I know it's gonna be tough but it's a tough problem it's

547
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:10,280
rough but somebody's got to do it and why not both I say why not both you know

548
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:14,720
true although with that said I got my last Mac hold out to finally I thought I

549
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:19,080
had him a month ago but to finally switch to Linux today oh yeah oh cuz

550
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:24,360
Xcode update broke his his Unix binaries that kind of stuff that's what it takes

551
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:32,560
right for a dev stack yep mm-hmm non-standard locations on Mac

552
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:37,760
pag dot boosts in with 1701 sets which is a Star Trek boost live long and

553
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:42,560
prosper says thanks for all the great shows by never watching Star Trek I did

554
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:46,840
a great sin and I have to ask for forgiveness to fix this going forward

555
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:51,480
I'd like to know which season you recommend to start with would you

556
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:55,680
recommend the old og1 or a new one like strange new worlds I'm looking forward

557
00:41:55,680 --> 00:42:01,120
to your answer really enjoy the shows thanks for a fellow mid from office

558
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:04,720
hours okay oh I see from the right for inspiration for the boost amount for the

559
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:10,560
enterprise right right mmm nice oh god I have to tell you I literally live in

560
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:13,880
fear of this question on a daily basis I constantly think what if somebody asked

561
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:18,000
me where to start with Star Trek and I obsess over this question because it's

562
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:22,080
it's probably one of the most important questions a person will ever ask you I'm

563
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:25,080
dying to know what you think I don't think we're gonna agree I don't know I

564
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:28,960
think a couple of days ago my answer would have been different but while we

565
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:33,760
were down in Pasadena for the JPL tour we stayed at an Airbnb for a few days

566
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:40,600
and the most incredible thing happened it was perfect I swear to God I swear to

567
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:44,400
God this is what happened I walk in the first thing I did at the Airbnb is like

568
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:48,160
because you walk in the living room I turned the TV on there's a big TV Star

569
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:52,440
Trek the next generation comes up and it's encounter at Farpoint episode 1 and

570
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:56,360
then it's like a 35 year anniversary thing so it turns out they're playing

571
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:59,720
every single episode in chronological order and we showed up right as

572
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:04,680
encounter at Farpoint starts we left the TV on the entire time we were there we

573
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:08,440
made it all the way into season 4 Cupid which is episode 94 in the production

574
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:12,420
run we made it all the way through like best of both worlds you know like the

575
00:43:12,420 --> 00:43:18,720
good stuff and I have to say man mm-hmm Star Trek the next generation gets so

576
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:24,400
damn good around season 3 and then just continues to deliver until the end of

577
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:27,800
the series basically I can't believe this we're gonna agree I cannot believe

578
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:31,200
this really is this what your recommendation was I could have sworn

579
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:35,160
you were gonna say oh gee you have to do it in order I don't know I don't know I

580
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:38,680
think you I think you got to learn to love Star Trek and then go back and

581
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:44,200
watch the original series I feel like the problem and with og Star Trek is

582
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:50,880
it's great after you watch TNG especially for more modern particularly

583
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:55,920
younger audiences you know even I think people in our age bracket roughly might

584
00:43:55,920 --> 00:44:00,520
find some of the stuff in that a little interesting yeah I I think the first

585
00:44:00,520 --> 00:44:05,480
couple seasons of TNG are very much toss inspired they're like the original

586
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:08,880
series and yeah a lot of people don't like the first couple of seasons yeah I

587
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:13,440
mean I do think it's either og or original series the problem with with

588
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:17,440
strange new worlds is you have to have seen the original series to really

589
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:21,240
understand what the hell is going on I feel like right because it's playing off

590
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:25,080
the original series I think you get a lot richer experience you definitely get

591
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:29,200
a richer experience I think you could watch it in isolation if the production

592
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:33,080
and pacing of older Star Trek like the next generation I say older but you know

593
00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:38,440
it's from the 80s and and deep space 9 if the pacing which I find to be perfect

594
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:43,960
but if you find it a little slow I think strange new worlds would be like my

595
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:48,200
backup plan right start with the next generation and if it's just not sticking

596
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:51,720
then I'd probably try strange new worlds because maybe you just like that style a

597
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:54,760
little bit more then you start to build an appreciation for the universe and

598
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:58,840
then you can kind of pick up the other ones ooh but DS 9 though yeah wait a minute

599
00:44:58,840 --> 00:45:02,360
no no I think you could see I don't think you can do discovery because it's

600
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:06,480
too different from the other ones deep space 9 holds up because it was it was

601
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:11,440
early into that ongoing narrative storytelling and so I think it it holds

602
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:17,360
up in binge watching I'd say it's TNG or DS 9 yeah I agree I agree let us know

603
00:45:17,360 --> 00:45:20,800
how it goes and if you feel differently if you've got a better suggestion I've

604
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:26,240
even thought about like breaking it down to a list of episodes that cross all the

605
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:30,880
different Star Trek's so you know you a couple of key moments from TNG deep

606
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:34,240
speech would be deep space 9 Voyager toss you know in Enterprise and you throw

607
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:37,520
them all on the board and you make a big list this is an important question so

608
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:41,200
boost in your answers if you've got a better one because somebody will ask

609
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:45,360
again and I want to do them right our last boost this week came in from

610
00:45:45,360 --> 00:45:49,920
nano bills that's how I'm saying it he boosted him with 50 sats and he said if

611
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:54,160
you need to use flat packed VS code to reach your whole system you can use flat

612
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:57,600
seal to allow that and I wanted to mention that because we've brought up VS

613
00:45:57,600 --> 00:46:01,200
code and flat pack a couple of times on Linux and how it's limited to the file

614
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:05,920
system there is an app that you can install as a flat pack called flat seal

615
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:11,200
one word and that gives you a GUI to manage all of the permissions on your

616
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:15,120
flat pack apps on your Linux desktop and you can go in there and say I want to

617
00:46:15,120 --> 00:46:19,160
allow access to the file system I want to allow access to the camera or you

618
00:46:19,160 --> 00:46:23,760
know whatever it might be so check out flat seal it makes all of that a lot

619
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:30,200
simpler to manage thank you to nan to tubes bills for boosting that in I'm
