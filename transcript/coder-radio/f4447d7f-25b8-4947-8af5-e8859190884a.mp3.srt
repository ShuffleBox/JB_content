00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,280
This is KOTORadio, episode 333 for November 26th, 2018.

2
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:36,000
Oh hi you and welcome to KOTORadio, Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show taking a pragmatic

3
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,680
look at the art and the business of software development and its related technologies.

4
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:47,600
This episode is maybe the last one for a while, recorded in the rainy and gray Pacific Northwest.

5
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:53,600
My name is Chris, and joining me, like a soldier always at his post, even when we're not doing an

6
00:00:53,600 --> 00:01:00,160
episode, is our host, Mr. Dominic. Hello, Mike. I'm sorry, when I was at a bar, what happened?

7
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:03,040
No, I think you were stuck in traffic, actually. Yeah, that's true.

8
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:08,400
You know, I guess the two things are related. You go to a bar, you have a work meeting at lunch,

9
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:14,800
and then you get stuck in traffic. I haven't actually had that problem where I can't make

10
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:20,960
it to a show, because like a gentleman, I schedule my travel during non-KOTOR days.

11
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:26,720
I see what you did there. But man, the most recent travel, I have been stuck in traffic

12
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:31,360
in a way I have never been stuck before. And that comes from a professional former commuter.

13
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:36,560
It has been bad, so I do understand. And to make up for it, we're just going to have a

14
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:45,520
great episode, right? Yeah. I mean, easy, right? No problem. I actually, I think I feel like this

15
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:50,720
episode is jinxed, if I can be honest with you, because 15 minutes before we started, I just

16
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:56,800
learned that I'm leaving Washington on Sunday. And I sound like I'm still processing, like,

17
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:01,120
how does that impact my life and my show production? I'm still trying to figure that out.

18
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:05,120
It's one of those things. Well, I thought we knew that, because the live audience will get

19
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:09,440
a little treat at the end of this show. Yeah, yeah. One of us, oh shit, I'm leaving too.

20
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:12,960
Yeah, exactly. I know, we're prerecording for you, but it turns out we need to be

21
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:16,160
prerecording for me. Also prerecording. You and I have to stop this whole-

22
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:19,920
I know. So can we take a tangent about my recent travels?

23
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:25,200
Yeah, let's do it. So, you know, if there was to be a Bible written by laptops

24
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:32,560
about angels and devils, I think I might be Satan. Yeah, I agree. I had two casualties

25
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:36,800
on this. Now, this was a three-legged trip. We went to Tejas. No, you did.

26
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:43,440
Then, yes, I did. San Antonio. Then to New Jersey, also known as Military City, for those who don't

27
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:47,840
know. I'm not kidding. Oh, right, for your new clientele for the app.

28
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:54,800
Yes. And then to New Jersey, and then a quick detour into New York City. By New York,

29
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:59,120
I had no more laptops. Wait a minute. Okay, so you start the trip

30
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,640
with two laptops, and by the time you get to New York, you got no laptops?

31
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:10,080
No laptops, and I did not get mugged. So, okay, so I'm packing, right?

32
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:13,920
Yeah. And I throw in the Mac cable, the USB-C

33
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:19,760
brick thing. I throw in the Galego cable. Wait, wait, your Galego cable? Your Galego

34
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:22,480
doesn't charge over USB-C? It does not.

35
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,360
I'm sorry, what? Is this the old Galego, or is this a current Galego?

36
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:32,400
This is the Gen 2, or 3, whatever the Gen before the one you would buy today is.

37
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,200
Okay. Yeah. For the laptops I buy,

38
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:42,080
it actually has been a little while. So, okay. Turns out the Galego cable I bought,

39
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:45,440
brought, was not in fact a Galego cable. Oh, man.

40
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:50,240
Sucks. And that's the machine I needed for Tejas. So I, in my infinite wisdom,

41
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:56,400
buy a cable in the airport. Sure. It's kind of fun. Did you do it from

42
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,640
a vending machine, or did you go into one of the actual stores?

43
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:03,360
You know, they have those vending machines that are super tempting.

44
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,120
That was a weird experience. And yes, I did.

45
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:09,200
Oh, you did. You used the vending machine. I've always wanted to do that.

46
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,440
You know what? I was so sure my credit card was going to be stolen by the end of that whole

47
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:15,360
process. I know, right? Yeah.

48
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,880
But I had no choice. I mean, I got to do this demo. There's no way out of this.

49
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:24,240
So this was a brand that I've never heard of before. And I honestly don't know the name,

50
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:29,200
because it came in a little plastic pouch, like a Ziploc bag that one would, you know...

51
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,880
Not a box?

52
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,640
It was the only one. It was one of those universal ones with like 10 different

53
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:37,040
attachments. And you're like, one of these has got to work.

54
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:42,320
And it turns out it did. So I'll give them that. So whatever, I throw it in my bag,

55
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:48,160
because I got in, I got a ride to the hotel. Are you Ubering? What are you getting to the

56
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,240
hotel with? I lifted it, but same difference.

57
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:53,520
Yeah, yeah. Yeah. It sent me a notification that it was

58
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:56,800
some percentage off. I don't know why. You're like, yes, please.

59
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:02,160
I'm like, sure. Sounds like a deal. You know what? I got in like 9.45,

60
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,880
and I hadn't eaten, right? Like, this is one of those situations where, you know...

61
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,560
Oh, man. So you're exhausted.

62
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:11,360
A whole bit. Flight delayed. So I'm like, you know what? I'm starving. I go to the hotel

63
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:16,800
bar and order a salad. But the first thing I do is check into my room, plug in the computer

64
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:21,120
to this cable. But I turn it on and I let it run updates. It seems fine.

65
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:25,200
I guess what I should have noticed was an error message saying that the cable was no good.

66
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,120
What error message? What error message?

67
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,320
I don't know, some kind of like pop up that said like not charging.

68
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,040
No. This isn't a thing.

69
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:36,480
Well, all right. Well, let me tell you, this is what I've heard digging through forums.

70
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:40,160
So, but anyway, I didn't check, right? So I just turned it on.

71
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,720
Right. You're hungry. It's nine o'clock at night.

72
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:46,240
I had a little my fi puck, because I don't use hotel Wi-Fi, because I'm not crazy.

73
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,000
Atta boy, you really got this down.

74
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,200
Right. Well, I, you know how much I travel. I mean, yeah, you do. You have to have it down.

75
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:54,880
It's just worth the, you know, 20 bucks a month to Verizon for the Wi-Fi puck.

76
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:57,760
Whatever. I do the updates and I, you know what? I want it to download,

77
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:02,640
like make sure the demo ran, whatever, whatever. But I was tired and I was hungry. So I get

78
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:06,480
downstairs and I do chicken wings. You do a salad, really? You do a salad.

79
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:08,960
I do chicken wings. Cause who can screw up chicken wings?

80
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:13,040
Well, here's my thing. Well, I could not get a salad because they had no salad.

81
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:18,560
So I ended up having to wait for what they call the quesadilla. And you would think in Texas,

82
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:23,200
it would be good, but it was weird. Oh, you're in Texas. Yeah. They don't have salad in Texas.

83
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:27,600
Yeah. No. The young lady just looked at me like I was on drugs. So then, you know,

84
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:31,200
I'm sitting there waiting for my food. They were very busy. Remember, this is election night we're

85
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:36,560
talking about. So this is back a while. And you know, I'm sitting, there's a convention there.

86
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:40,560
I'm talking to people from the convention doing my salesy thing. Yeah. To be honest,

87
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:45,920
the convention doing my salesy thing, get upstairs and I'm beat. It's gotta be 1130.

88
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:49,600
And I have to meet the customer in the morning. And you're out of your time zone too.

89
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:56,320
I'm out of my time. 1130 local time. Right. Right. So my time, what is that? 2 30. So I get

90
00:06:56,320 --> 00:07:04,000
upstairs, go to sleep, wake up, turn on my laptop, a strange fan noise and beeping.

91
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:13,120
Oh no. Yeah. So I go, I do the first meeting. Fine. I whip out the Mac book,

92
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:17,280
install a windows bootcamp partition. I'm sorry. Wait, wait, wait. So was the Galago at this point

93
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:22,640
just unusable? It wouldn't turn on. Ah, okay. So you brought two machines. Second machine's the

94
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:28,000
Mac book. Mac book. Is this a USB-C Mac book or is this amazing? It is USB-C. Okay. All right.

95
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:33,200
And I had the correct adapter that came with it. Right. So I partitioned the drive bootcamp,

96
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:37,680
whole thing. I let it run all day cause Griffin runs on Linux and windows, right? It doesn't

97
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:42,800
run on Mac. So fine. We run the windows version. No big deal. Most, you know, the Linux version

98
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,480
is, it doesn't matter. Right. For the, for the end of, for the purposes of a demo,

99
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:51,200
it doesn't matter. Right. So if you've got windows 10 on there and Griffin runs fine,

100
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:55,600
good to go. Runs fine. Good to go. So that's how I did my whole Tejas trip.

101
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:01,120
Fly to New Jersey. Now I'm still thinking it's just a bad cable and there's nothing

102
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,760
wrong with the Gallico, right? Like, you know what? My mistake. I didn't take the

103
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:09,840
cable that they sent with it. Get to New Jersey and a relative of mine who runs a small business

104
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:15,920
has a problem. She had left her computers plugged in and it destroyed her only computer.

105
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:21,200
No. Like from a power issue? Yeah. So I try to recover it. It's toast.

106
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:28,640
What kind of machine is this? It's a desktop? This is like a cheapo. Windows box? Yeah. Best

107
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:34,560
fights. This is nothing. So I'm thinking, you know what? Gallico is fine. I'm sure if I plug

108
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:39,440
it into the right cable, whatever. I have Mac build servers in the cloud. Now I'll just give

109
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:45,440
her the Mac book or Mac book pro cause she's in a bind. Yeah. Oh man. Wow. So I wipe all my stuff

110
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:52,240
off. I give it to her. No, you formatted it. Everything's backed up. I didn't lose any data.

111
00:08:52,240 --> 00:09:02,800
Oh man. Okay. Okay. So, so I fly to, you gave her a Mac book while you're in the state of unknown

112
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:07,920
hardware at that particular point. So I had the iPad pro we ordered on the live show for the

113
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:13,200
Apple event. I had shipped there to New Jersey. So you acquire the iPad pro at this point?

114
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:19,600
Acquired the iPad pro and I spent the rest of my entire trip solely working on the iPad pro.

115
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:24,320
No shit. No. Yeah. That's exactly what had to happen. And, and wait a minute. So you're telling

116
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:29,520
me you never got the Gallico working again? Ah, so I get back to the sunshine state.

117
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:33,680
I thought I had it at first. I thought I couldn't get it to turn on. Then I got it to turn on

118
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:37,280
about two hours ago. I thought I had it working and now it doesn't hold the charge.

119
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:44,240
So it will work on AC power. It will not work, which is useless to me. Right? Right. Cause it's,

120
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:48,800
you're traveling. I'm traveling. So I might just send it and see what they charge me.

121
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:54,400
System 76 to repair it, which is fine. Or I might do something else. I don't know. I,

122
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,960
I have to say that I'm thinking of going back to punch cards.

123
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:02,480
Yeah. Right. Just pack them all up. Put them in a bag. I am like, I am like the,

124
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:08,960
the apocalypse of laptops here. Yeah. That's why I was asking you guys in the, in the JV Slack.

125
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:14,000
So how's that Dell XPS 13 look? Yeah. Well, I mean, the nice thing about the iPad pro I gotta

126
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:19,360
say is the USB-C charging. So I recently went, I just got back from Texas actually.

127
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:24,800
And the thing that was really nice for me is I brought one charging cable with me. Funny enough,

128
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:30,880
I bought a, I, I not, not because I have a Mac book, but I brought the Mac book pro charging

129
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:38,160
cable. And then I took with me my Lenovo T four 80 and an iPad pro and my pixel three. And I was

130
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:46,640
able to charge all of my devices with one cable. It was glorious. It was, I can't, for somebody

131
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:51,840
who's like frequently quickly traveling right now, it was, it was liberating to bring one.

132
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:58,240
USB-C's gotta be a requirement for whatever I do here. Cause this all started because I mistook

133
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:03,120
my wife's old Dell XPS cable, which then I got yelled at for taking her charger

134
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:09,520
for my Gallego cable that wasn't paying attention. Interestingly, I also got the iPad pro,

135
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:14,320
as you know, I got like the cheapest one I could with LTE on a pencil and the keyboard,

136
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:23,040
which is still a ridiculous amount of money to spend for a device, but unrelated. I also just

137
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:29,120
kind of have started waking up at 4 am for, for months now I've been waking up at 4 am. And

138
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:35,040
what I do is I, I go generally eat like breakfast and I watch something on YouTube and then I try

139
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:39,600
to go back to bed and maybe I sleep for 30 minutes. And so instead of what I've started

140
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:43,680
doing about a month ago is it just got up. Like if I wake up at 4 am without an alarm clock,

141
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:50,480
let's just get up. But then like, seriously, what the frick do you do with yourself? You're up at

142
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:56,400
4 am like not 5 am not 6 am. Like, what do you do with yourself? Because you go on Twitter and

143
00:11:56,400 --> 00:12:02,480
fight with Kara Swisher. That's what you do. That's what you do. What I did. And I know this makes me

144
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:07,920
sound like a total douchebag, but it, it fricking works for me is I took the iPad pro and I started

145
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:11,840
going out to like coffee shops and stuff. And I just started working from there before I even

146
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:18,080
come into the studio. So I have like, I have this, I have this period of time that is around other

147
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:23,920
people that keeps me awake. It keeps me alive. It, it, it prevents me from falling back asleep.

148
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:27,760
And then I come into the studio and I do my real work. But during this period of time,

149
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:34,480
you know, two hours, an hour and a half, whatever it is, I am exclusively using the iPad pro right

150
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:41,200
now. I feel like a d-bag, but so it's really working for me. I ended up writing scripts on

151
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:47,760
the iPad pro using ISH to, and oh my God, it actually worked. Yeah. So you and I are both

152
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:54,160
using ISH then. This is great. This is, this is a, you have to, you have to get on like the test

153
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:59,680
pilot program, but it is an entire Linux environment, an Alpine Linux environment

154
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:06,880
on the iPad. It is even emulating x86 hardware, which is disgusting, but it's, it works.

155
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:11,920
Well, no, you know what's more disgusting? The iPad pro was more powerful than every device

156
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:16,480
I've destroyed on this trip. Oh man. Let me tell you the speed and performance that,

157
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:21,600
so here's the other reason. So the iPad pro it doesn't work for anyone out there who's

158
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:27,360
never used iOS before. If you're not a happy existing iOS user, do not waste your money

159
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:31,040
buying one of these things. It's not for you. If you use the Linux desktop and you don't have

160
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:37,840
an iOS device or you love Android, don't get the iPad pro. It's not a device for you. If

161
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:43,600
you are an existing and established iOS user and you understand the limitations of iOS,

162
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:49,280
and you can excel within those limitations for certain types of workflows, I think you

163
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:53,760
should consider it because I'll give you an example. I get a lot of emails that I have

164
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:59,440
to convert to PDF and then save the Dropbox. That is a two second process on the iPad pro.

165
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:04,560
I have to do a lot of Slack and other apps that would be electron on my Linux desktop

166
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:10,160
that are native applications on the iPad pro and it's fast. It feels better, right?

167
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:15,840
I do all my go to meetings, Zoom meetings, and all that stuff on the iPad pro. It's so much

168
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:20,240
better than the Linux or Windows experience. It's way better. It's just way, it's way better.

169
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:24,240
I shared Google drive and walked them through a doc. I had a meeting this morning and walked

170
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:27,840
the folks through a document on an iPad pro and I don't think that any idea was on an iPad.

171
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:32,880
Yeah. And then if you want to participate in the expensive Apple ecosystem, then things

172
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:38,400
like the AirPods work really well with the iPad pro so you can be somewhere and you can

173
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:43,120
just open the AirPod case and put the AirPods in and you're doing a, you're doing a virtual meeting

174
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:49,040
right there from a, from a fricking tablet. And to see how far I could push this, I just recently

175
00:14:49,040 --> 00:15:01,520
got a USB-C to USB-B cable from Amazon. And I hooked up a production grade Zoom U22 audio

176
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:08,640
interface to my iPad pro with an XLR microphone, like a professional studio microphone, a microphone

177
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:14,400
that costs $300. And then you have to buy the $60 XLR cable and the audio interface and then plug

178
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:19,440
all of that into the iPad pro. But I, you know, I have all that stuff. So I just got this like

179
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:27,280
$9 cable, hooked it up and I'm able to input high grade studio quality microphone audio into the

180
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:28,720
iPad pro over USB-C.

181
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:35,280
So when I got my hands on mine, before I decided to give the MacBook away, I did some testing on

182
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:41,600
the USB-C interface, that's accessible via Swift or theoretically Objective-C on the iOS SDK,

183
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:47,760
but I did my tests in Swift. It's not locked down. I mean, they don't make certain things easy. So

184
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:51,520
you have to write your own, like file, like there's a lot of stuff. If you want to do something,

185
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:57,680
you have to do it, right? But well, storage sucks, but everything else, audio devices,

186
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:05,920
interface devices, video devices, monitors, HDMI, ethernet, or even using a tablet in a factory,

187
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:11,760
let's say to flash IOT devices or IOT boards. If you have USB-C to USB-C and you have a custom app

188
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:17,360
on iOS, technically that's just like an opening up. I mean, this isn't gross oversimplification,

189
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:22,480
but opening a port and just flash it onto the board. Well, this could be a real,

190
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:25,600
it could be basically do anything you want. Maybe. I mean, you got to keep in mind it's Apple and

191
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:28,800
they're going to lock this shit down as much as they can. No, it's not locked down. I literally

192
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,840
did it. It's not locked down. Yeah. I mean, it's, yes, but at the same time-

193
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:36,640
Going outbound, right? I'm talking outbound. So I'm talking your code on iOS goes over USB-C

194
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:39,280
and interacts with another device. I'm not talking about modifying the system.

195
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:44,800
Yes. Okay. All right. Absolutely. Yeah. Yeah, there, I agree. I have had, and you too, it's funny,

196
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:49,600
really super condensed amount of travel. Oh man, I wish I had my, um,

197
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:55,360
I don't have the app with me, but I've done something like 60,000 miles in the last like

198
00:16:55,360 --> 00:17:01,200
four months. Um, it's just, it's unbelievable. I'm like, I get like access to clubs and stuff.

199
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:04,080
Like I can go in the Alaskan lounge now and just-

200
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:10,720
Nice. Yeah, it's great. But I tell you what, I, I, I totally spend all of that time surveying

201
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:18,480
everyone in the lounge and not really, really, I mean, there's some, but I mean, really almost

202
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:24,320
everyone is using a tablet of some form in the lounges and at the airports and on the plane.

203
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:29,120
And yeah, I'm a dick bag, but I'm buying the premium seating or once or twice, maybe first

204
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:31,760
class, but every now and then too, like- Naughty boy.

205
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:34,560
Yeah. Well, I haven't submitted those expenses yet. We'll see how that goes.

206
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:39,920
But, um, I, I also am, I'm coaching it up, you know, 95% of the time and-

207
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:42,480
Yeah, I'm, I'm, I'm coach plus usually, but that's about it.

208
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:48,400
Coach plus my, yeah. Coach plus is my average with some coach and the rare first class only

209
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,480
when it's like the only seat available.

210
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:54,800
Although I, I did treat myself to business class this time and I was like,

211
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:57,280
you can call me Mr. Dominic. Thank you.

212
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:00,080
And you get, you get the free booze. You get the free booze.

213
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:04,880
Free booze. Well, you know what's funny? I have flown so many Southwest United flights

214
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:08,240
now in the last few months. Yeah. I get free booze tickets anyway.

215
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:11,680
Oh, really? That's nice. Yeah. Well, have you ever been on a Southwest flight?

216
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:15,840
Oh, I mean, yeah, but not recently. Nobody wants you sober. Nobody wants to be sober.

217
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:20,960
Well, so, uh, if you want the commuter flight between Washington and Texas,

218
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:25,200
you go with Alaska airlines. It's a nonstop three hour, 50 minute flight. So,

219
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:31,680
I signed up for their lounges and I'm at the bar and I'm there with probably, I don't know,

220
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:37,040
15 other people and all of us are on tablets. Now, the great thing is, is it's all, you can drink

221
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:41,600
just part of the membership. So, if you fly better after having a few drinks,

222
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:45,040
I do everything better. Which airline is this? Alaska you said?

223
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:49,200
Yeah, it's Alaska. Yeah. Delta. I'm also looking at Delta now because I'm flying enough on Delta

224
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:53,200
that I might, I might be able to fly better. I'm not sure. I'm not sure.

225
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:56,240
I'm flying enough on Delta that I might, I might be able to get into the Delta lounge.

226
00:18:57,040 --> 00:19:02,320
Same thing. Yeah. United is a respectable two drinks. Oh, really? They limit you.

227
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:06,400
Well, you can, they free to, uh, you pay for the rest.

228
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:09,920
I will tell you, I mean, I don't get, I don't get sloshed cause I think they're making them

229
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:12,880
a little on the light side, but, uh, I've never walked out of an,

230
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:16,960
I've never walked out of an Alaska lounge without at least three drinks for free.

231
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:21,200
Well that, and I don't know about you. Oh, the other thing is I was carrying,

232
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,920
I didn't tell you about the TSA. This is going to be a weird show folks. Sorry,

233
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:28,960
but this is hilarious. So I was carrying 3d light scanners in my luggage.

234
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:35,040
Wait, what? Yeah. Go to peel 3d. I was carrying one of those. Just peel 3d. Google it. If you

235
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:40,960
people are interested. Um, the TSA was very, very unhappy. Really?

236
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:48,560
Well, they look like, uh, weird guns. Are you doing regular animal style PS TSA? Like

237
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:52,880
I did not. I did not get my pre-check approved yet because I didn't go do the, uh, I still have to

238
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:57,600
go do that. What's the matter with you? What is it? Two laptops, two skaters.

239
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:01,200
It's 10 times easier than getting your passport and getting your passport. Isn't that hard?

240
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:05,040
You, you, uh, you, you just do a quick interview and you're done. And I know,

241
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:08,960
I know I gotta go do it. Everybody's got TSA pre-checked. So there are lines. So don't think

242
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:12,800
it's going to save you a ton of time, but it means you don't have to empty your bag.

243
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:16,720
You don't have to take off your shoes. I mean, I'm telling you, man, I have gotten through with

244
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:21,360
stuff that is not legal. And I mean, I shouldn't say that because they're probably listening,

245
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:26,240
but the TSA pre-check is the way to go. That's for sure. Because when you look at my audio

246
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:30,560
recording equipment, it looks like it's like a bomb. Like it just looks like I'm carrying a

247
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:36,880
legal contraband, like custom motherboards. Right. I have, I have circuit boards. I have

248
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:42,160
coiled cables. I have tubular devices that have modules in them. I mean, it looks like I am

249
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:48,080
carrying like a weapon of mass destruction. And so TSA constantly would be like, what is this? What

250
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:52,240
is this? So I got the pre-check and now they still scan the bag, but they've never stopped me.

251
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:58,880
So you got to get the pre-check or clear. Okay. I got to try that. I don't, I don't know what clear

252
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:04,960
is. Anyway. Well, clear is another, it's like a, it's a commercial competitor to TSA that, that a

253
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:09,760
lot of airports contract. So if you haven't seen clear, then it's not one for you to sign up.

254
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:15,280
All the airports I go through have clear. Yeah. So you're, so you, you traveling with two bags is

255
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:21,520
super heavy. Are you checking luggage every time? I had to check one. So what I figured out, so I

256
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:26,880
was depositing some of this hardware in Texas. So the trip, as soon as I got to Texas, everything

257
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:30,240
was a lot simpler because then I didn't need to check a bag because it was one of those situations

258
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:37,200
where it's like a luggage set. So one bag was just equipment protected by clothing, which was checked,

259
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:41,840
which I did get a lovely note from the TSA that it was searched. And the other bag was the rest of

260
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:46,720
the crap and some clothes. So you get the iPad pro, you get some time to play with it before you

261
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:52,800
hand over the Mac book back book. Did you set it up new? Did you transfer from an iCloud image? What

262
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:57,280
I never transfer. I always set it up. Do you, I did this time. I went new this time. Yeah. Yeah.

263
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:02,560
I just don't trust the iCloud. Did you get the pencil with it? I did. I spent way too much on a

264
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:07,680
tablet. Yeah. Yeah. What are your impressions though of the pencil? I'll, I'll, I'll tell you

265
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:12,320
mine just to put them out there. So you know what my bias is. I also got the Apple pencil because I

266
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:15,840
thought, you know, if I'm going to get an iPad, I haven't bought one for three or four years.

267
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:20,320
If I'm getting an iPad, I'm going to get an iPad. I'm going to get one with LTE. I'm going to get

268
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:24,720
one with the keyboard. I'm going to get one with the pencil. And I, I knew that since I bought my

269
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:28,880
last iPad. In fact, it's the reason I did not buy the last iPad pro because I knew I was going to

270
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:32,560
spend a lot of money and I just wasn't ready to spend that money. So I want everybody to understand

271
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:38,720
that like, you know, this is something I calculated three years out, but it was still a painful

272
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:46,960
purchase for me. And when I got the, when I got the pencil, I was very worried that it would be a

273
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:52,960
total fucking waste of money because it's way too expensive. And it only works with this iPad,

274
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:57,520
doesn't work with my phone, doesn't work with any of the kids I have. It doesn't work with my

275
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:03,680
iPad. It doesn't work with any of the kids iPads, doesn't work with a Dia's iPhone. It only works

276
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:12,720
with my super nice iPad pro. So, and I don't draw. I stick figures. CPG gray makes me look like a

277
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:19,920
child. So I was really concerned that I wouldn't get any use out of the pencil. But what I realize

278
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:24,720
now after using it for a few weeks is the pencil is the new mouse in a lot of ways. Has your

279
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:31,440
thought changed? Not exactly, but I think you should keep going before I jump in. Well, I'm

280
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:40,080
using it for tech selection, cursor, cursor, like positioning. And I mean, part of that is because

281
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:43,760
the fricking iPad doesn't have the ability like you have on the iPhone where you can press down

282
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:49,200
on the keyboard and you get a mouse cursor, which you basically can convert the iPhone keyboard

283
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:56,320
into a trackpad, which is great for editing text. But you know what's way better at working with

284
00:23:56,320 --> 00:24:00,800
text is a larger screen like the iPad, but you don't fricking get that push down on the keyboard

285
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:07,040
functionality. So I use the pencil for that quite a bit. A big part of my show prep is highlighting

286
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:13,360
sections of articles for news. The pencil works great for that. And just kind of finessing the

287
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:19,840
interface. I use the pencil quite a bit for that as well. So I have found it to be kind of like

288
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:30,640
mouse 2.0 in a lot of ways. So I like the pencil a lot as well. My issue was that apps we still

289
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:37,360
don't take advantage of the pencil. And I kept wanting it to be able to do things that I felt

290
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:44,080
were very intuitive, that it just doesn't do. Right. If the app support of the pencil was as

291
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:50,880
good of support as they have for the keyboard, it would be great. Like the keyboard is surprisingly

292
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:56,720
well supported. You can hold down the- Yeah, it's really good. Yeah, you see all the available

293
00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:03,760
commands. Well, and a weird collection of Mac, like if you've used a Mac for a long time,

294
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:11,600
Mac keyboard shortcuts just work. Which I find- Yeah, yeah. Like Alt-Tab and copy and paste and

295
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:15,520
all those kinds of things. As Varitunda points out, in a way, we're rediscovering the stylus.

296
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:22,640
And it is that. Going back to our travel theme here, what works really, really well for my lady

297
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:28,960
and I is to do a Google image search of a high resolution calendar. So like January or December,

298
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:33,840
like a basic business calendar. And then she takes that image from Google images-

299
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:37,920
Wait, wait, a basic picture. Does it come with a pumpkin spice latte? I can't let that one go.

300
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:44,480
No, you know what I'm saying? Like it's just like the most clear grid calendar for like January 2019.

301
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:49,840
Oh yeah, sure. Okay. It's just really plain, just a high resolution. Like somebody just created this

302
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:55,600
and then posted online. So what she'll do on the iPad Pro is she'll go Google images for like

303
00:25:55,600 --> 00:26:01,040
February, January. She'll get a great looking calendar that has basically nothing on it.

304
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:06,480
She saves that to the photos or actually no, I'm wrong. What she does is she imports that photo

305
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:12,720
into a new note. And then she brings that into Apple notes and she illustrates our entire month

306
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:18,560
on these calendars. Like she can pinch to zoom to get like a lot of working room in a particular day.

307
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:26,080
And she can illustrate an entire like road trip or I'm planning to go to Fosdam, which is

308
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:31,920
in Brussels. Like that's a massive trip because I'm leaving from Texas, not Washington because

309
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:37,360
I have to go to Brussels mid trip. So it's one of those, okay, we're going to travel to here,

310
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:39,920
then we're going to fly to here, then we're going to drive to here, then we're going to

311
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:43,280
fly to Brussels, then we're going to fly back and then we're going to drive to here.

312
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:47,440
And I'm a visual person. And so being able to actually draw all that out on a calendar,

313
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:52,400
goes from like nebulous concept that I can't wrap my head around to, oh, okay, well now I'm going to

314
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:56,800
prep the team to expect when I'm going to be gone. It really makes a difference.

315
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:02,080
And it's the pencil, it's not a mouse. You know what I mean? Drawing.

316
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:07,200
Yeah, no, I get it. Right. Drawing makes, well, it's because it's like I take notes by hand still.

317
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:11,760
And it's just because like I can just quickly draw up like a simple UML diagram, right? I get

318
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:15,440
people who have worked with me will know that like, I'm a big fan of just walking up to the

319
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:18,800
whiteboard. Let's just like draw it with the system. What didn't broad strokes look like, right?

320
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:25,280
Do you agree though, that no one should buy this? And it is an extremely limited platform

321
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:29,360
where the operating system is one of the biggest constraints and that it is a total waste of money?

322
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:31,920
Well, I don't like absolutes, right?

323
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:38,480
I feel like it is both one of the best computers I have ever owned in my entire life going back

324
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:44,160
to the 80s. And it's also one of the biggest wastes of money because a lot of that power is

325
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:54,400
just completely untapped. So it's weird for me. Like, you know, I had to draft my flight simulation

326
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:58,400
rigging to be my desktop. That's what I'm talking about. I'm in the elementary partition right now

327
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:06,080
because I've destroyed all my laptops. And the iPad Pro is not quite as powerful as this machine

328
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:11,440
because yay, graphics card. Right. But it's not that far off either, right? Like this is...

329
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:17,040
I mean, if you deal with a machine that's all Intel parts, the iPad Pro probably kicks its ass.

330
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:24,080
It is in a weird way, the best portable computer. And I'm going to use the word computer here

331
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:31,040
that I have ever owned or I think seen. That's not like just a giant thing that dies in 45 minutes.

332
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:37,360
But because of Apple's weird hangups about software distribution and like how you can

333
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:43,120
access and use the system and frankly, file access, which I never thought in 2018,

334
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:48,880
going on 2019 very shortly, that I would be complaining about like, you know, file access.

335
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:54,400
Yeah, kind of. I mean, in a way, though, the integration with cloud services is pretty slick.

336
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:59,520
Like if it's in iCloud or everything on the cloud or in Dropbox. Yeah, you're set. Yeah, exactly.

337
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:07,040
I don't know about that. Right. Oh, totally. It's I want it on a USB thumb drive, to be honest with

338
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:11,280
you. And I'd like to then copy it to the local iPad storage, which is crazy fast.

339
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:18,640
I am hoping that like, like, you know, the USB port being relatively open

340
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:23,440
gives me a lot of hope that like, you know what, they're going to make this a true utilitarian

341
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:27,360
device. And I know it's not going to happen because it's Apple and whatever, but they're

342
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:32,480
going to come close enough that it doesn't that it's OK. Yeah, right now you're still very like

343
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:38,640
like I watched the announcement live and I bought the NBA 2K game.

344
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:45,760
It's awesome, right? Like, you know what? I haven't really done console gaming in a while.

345
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:50,320
I don't do a lot of PC gaming, but for like games like Civilization and, you know,

346
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:53,920
like Rogue Legacy, indie games. But even then, I barely get to play anymore.

347
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:58,160
To me, if you just showed me like a video of someone playing that game,

348
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:02,400
like without showing me the device, I would assume they were on like an Xbox 360,

349
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:06,800
right? Even like a low budget Xbox. I know it's phenomenal. It's right.

350
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:11,680
I mean, have you tried the NBA game? It's the graphics on this thing are they're

351
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:16,400
literally console level graphics. It's it's unbelievable what Apple's doing. So that's why

352
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:20,720
it strikes me as funny that you think the big problem is the file system. Like, I agree with

353
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:24,160
Wes and I don't think that's the big problem. I think that's a problem. I think the big problem is

354
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:29,200
Apple's general philosophy of not letting app developers basically treat it like a PC,

355
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:37,920
which is what it is. Yeah. Okay. All right. I mean, I guess and maybe this is a mistake on my

356
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:44,880
part, but I'm giving them a pass until WWDC and iOS 13. If they don't fucking make good in June

357
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:50,240
with iOS 13, then it's on like Donkey Kong. I'm going to be so good. What do you what do you mean?

358
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:55,680
What do you what do you mean? What's good? iOS 13 needs to be an iPad focused release. It needs

359
00:30:55,680 --> 00:31:00,960
to make the iPad a real machine like it needs to be all about all of these little rough edges.

360
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:06,960
And the file system is not it. Like, I don't think it's not the OS. It's even like forget about like

361
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:12,400
the OS being like kind of mobile focus and a little bit of a pain in the ass. And it's built

362
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:16,640
for a phone. Right. Yeah. Well, yeah. I mean, certainly there's quality of life things, but I

363
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:20,000
feel like we're talking about two different things where I'm talking about the fact that

364
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:25,360
Apple will reject apps that do things that are like interesting with the device. Ah, okay. Like,

365
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:29,360
if I believed all right, let's let's let's back it out there. And thank you for to our new owners,

366
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:34,000
Linux Academy. They're going to hate this. If I believed that I could write an iOS app,

367
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,360
just like I could like submitted elementary app or even a Mac OS app today.

368
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:42,960
I would not even look at replacing my dead laptops with anything but a Mac.

369
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:49,200
Because this is the see what annoys me is this is the tablet device that could fulfill my long

370
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:55,200
standing or Windows RT tablet dream. But I have no faith that they're going to actually allow

371
00:31:55,200 --> 00:32:00,400
developers to do what needs to be done. Right. Right. And this is where I think the iPad Pro

372
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:05,120
is not an appealing purchase to most people. This is what I was getting at. It's the apps

373
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:12,000
aren't powerful. Well, I mean, they're they are very powerful within the limitations that Apple

374
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,760
allows them. I have been very I mean, they're beautiful and they're fast. I mean, powerful as

375
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:21,120
an they're getting they're getting legitimately, though they're getting way the fuck better than

376
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:25,520
they used to be. And I don't swear a lot on this show. Usually that's that's your domain.

377
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:30,480
My department. Right. I have had a couple of come to Jesus moments with the iPad Pro

378
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:36,000
where I have I kid you not on two different occasions. This is my thought process.

379
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:42,800
Oh, OK, so I will never do this again on any other OS other than iOS.

380
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:49,680
For two different major video mother effing editing and audio mother effing editing,

381
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:56,880
I have I have seen a lot. Yeah. Oh, my. Oh, oh, oh, my goodness. Oh, my goodness. Basically,

382
00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:04,000
there is a Final Cut equivalent for iOS that is. Yes, there is. Fantastic. And it is efficient.

383
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:10,640
It is clean. It is fast. It totally takes advantage of the iPad hardware. And then

384
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:18,320
there is a multitrack audio editor called Fairight that is available for iOS. And it is

385
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:24,560
perfect at exactly the type of workflow that I now have with audio editing, because I now have

386
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:30,080
Joe and Ham that edit these shows for us. I'm not doing the show editing. But anytime you hear

387
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:36,240
real time audio, anytime you hear a clip or a sound effect, that's from me. And I make those edits.

388
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:46,240
And Fairight is a multitrack audio editing system that is perfect on the iPad Pro. It is perfect

389
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:53,360
with the keyboard. And it is exceptionally perfect with the pencil. And I can bang out audio in

390
00:33:54,240 --> 00:34:00,960
seconds with this thing. I have now successfully edited six different audio projects using Fairight,

391
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:07,040
including audio that I have captured over the USB interface into the iPad Pro directly into Fairight

392
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:13,680
and MP4s that I have downloaded from YouTube using shortcuts to download them from YouTube

393
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:19,120
and automatically import them into Fairight. Like I hear a great clip. I can then create just by the

394
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:26,320
share menu an action that downloads that video and then extracts the audio from it and then imports

395
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:32,480
that audio into Fairight. And I can be editing as fast as the internet connection allows. And it is

396
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:39,280
10 times faster than I could ever do on the desktop. I'm not going back. I'm always doing that

397
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:48,800
via iOS from now on. My mind is actually blown. My brain is scattered across the back of the wall

398
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:57,120
here. Chris, you're seducing me. I mean, the apps are getting way more powerful. They are

399
00:34:57,120 --> 00:35:03,520
way more powerful. No, I agree with you. I've played with the USB interface. So for a show

400
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:12,000
called Coder Radio, there was no code reason why I can't do like the literal 75 field notebooks

401
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:16,960
full of app ideas I have. Well, except for there's no Xcode for iPad. No, no, no. I mean,

402
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:22,560
I mean, I don't care. I'll do it on a Mac, right? Two or Windows if I'm using Xamarin, or hell,

403
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:30,000
I could do Xamarin on Linux now because yay, JetBrains Rider. How do I see everything you

404
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:35,520
just told me makes me think that I'm a little dated on my view of the app review team here.

405
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:43,360
That I'm still fighting a battle from like 2013 2014. Well, I think it's not your fault. I blame

406
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:50,240
Apple because Apple since the beginning has made this iPad versus laptop comparison. I mean, there

407
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:55,520
was quotes from Steve Jobs about how the iPad was going to be the real computer and that laptops

408
00:35:55,520 --> 00:36:02,240
are going to be trucks. And then even in the most recent Apple event, they had a comparison of iPad

409
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:06,240
sales where they were just blowing away laptop sales. And they were making the comparison right

410
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:12,160
there on their gigantic projector saying how much more iPad sales there are than laptop sales.

411
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:20,880
So Apple is themselves stoking this conversation of comparing tablets to laptops, which then makes

412
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:26,560
everyone compare tablets to real computers that can do real work. That it's not a fair comparison

413
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:34,880
yet. But if you look at this as a new device that supplements the work and does not replace the work

414
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:41,440
of the x86 type computer or the desktop computer or the laptop computer, but maybe except for

415
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:48,160
but maybe accelerates at certain limited types of workflows, your slack, your emails, your audio

416
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:53,680
editing, your video editing, maybe your photo workflows. Because think about how this thing is

417
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:59,600
built. It's built with CPU cores that are hyper accelerated at specific kinds of tasks,

418
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:05,600
photo manipulation, processing. No doubt. Right. So it's not a replacement, is it? It is a

419
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:10,800
supplement, isn't it? It is a supplement and not a replacement. And so if you think about how you

420
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:16,800
work, like for me in the morning, I prefer to do more conceptual work. I'll write out show docs.

421
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:22,160
I'll make big plans for the for the department for the week. I'll email people that are on the

422
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:27,680
East Coast. Like I'll do these things that are more mental and I'll do that in the morning

423
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:34,720
from an iPad because it's slack, it's air mail, it's telegram, it's Zoom. Exactly how I do it.

424
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:42,080
Yeah. Well, and and and with that in mind, then it just really comes down to is it worth the money

425
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:46,800
when you combine the performance? It's a little rough, though. It's rough, isn't it? It's like,

426
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:50,720
are you willing to buy a phone, a laptop, a desktop and a tablet?

427
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:55,920
Like, I got to be I got to be honest with you. If I had known like the day I was watching

428
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:59,920
Lana Del Rey and drooling on myself that for those who didn't see the Apple event,

429
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:05,200
Lana Del Rey was the singer. I I almost certainly would have ordered the iPad with

430
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:10,880
with the Apple branded case and the Apple branded pencil. You know what I mean? Like,

431
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:16,320
yeah, because that was I mean, it was a thousand dollars. Mine was mine was, I think,

432
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:20,880
a little over tax. It was like thirteen hundred. Yeah, that's a laptop. I mean, seriously, that's

433
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:26,720
your. Yeah, it is. It is. Now, for me, I'm in a situation where my laptop has now been purchased

434
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:36,480
by my employer. So I no longer have to finance the lab. And Chris rub that salt. So this is really

435
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:42,480
my computer. This is this is the first computer I've ever bought since I've gone full time working

436
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:48,480
for someone else that is paying for my equipment. And legitimately, I don't expect to buy another

437
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:54,400
computer. And when I travel and I was trying to get to this point earlier, what what seems to

438
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:58,800
validate what you and I are talking about and the reason why I'm really kind of willing to go all in

439
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:09,280
on this subject is when I when I'm in the airport, when I'm traveling, I I almost exclusively see

440
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:14,480
tablets. Now, I have I have seen a couple of laptops. I recently told a story on Linux Unplugged

441
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:21,200
about a Microsoft employee who was trying to make a convertible laptop work. But the reality is they

442
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:27,280
just they crush your available space and they make they make it so that even the space that a

443
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:34,160
12 inch laptop takes up is not enough. Plus, you got crappy power that you can maybe plug into.

444
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:38,320
So if you have something that charges over USB, you're way better off. But secondarily,

445
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:44,400
kind of just the like the just the nuts and bolts of it is when you're traveling. So you're in an

446
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:52,160
airplane. The the media experience where you can watch videos and the TV shows that are on a local

447
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:59,680
server, sure, it's just way better on mobile devices. It it really effing sucks on Windows.

448
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:07,600
I watched a passenger just recently spend nearly an entire four hour flight trying to get Windows 10

449
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:13,600
to stream the videos because you got no Internet. Right. So if you need to go get a flash update or

450
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:18,880
something like that, your S.O.L. You're done. Right. But if you're on a iOS or Android device,

451
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:23,760
you've got the app installed and you're good to go. It's HTML5 because there's no flash.

452
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:30,080
So I just want to throw one point here as someone who spent a lot of money and time trying to make

453
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:38,720
WinRT work. I hate two in one devices. I want them to die. Yeah, because each side is sort of

454
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:44,240
two minutes compromised. Yeah, right. It sounds like a good idea, but it's just not. It's an

455
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:49,200
awkward tablet. The software you have the right to make that work is actually really shitty and

456
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:53,760
complicated. What most people do is just like take the desktop version and just like blow up the

457
00:40:53,760 --> 00:41:00,080
buttons a little bit. It could you know, I could see it working if we had 10 years of iteration

458
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:06,320
on software design to make it work right. But it is so rough right now that it is supremely

459
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:09,760
frustrating to use. Yeah, and I don't I don't think that's the direction things are going.

460
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:14,880
I mean, for all my skepticism about the iPad Pro, I have a feeling next time Chris and I are done

461
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:20,480
taking planes. I'm like, so let's talk about Mac OS Mojave because that's what I'm all kidding

462
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:27,120
aside. Do you think so? I actually think in a way it makes me a better Linux user to have an iPad.

463
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:31,360
So, again, I'm thinking about developer opportunities, though.

464
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:39,360
Yeah, I think there this is see my vision of the of the tablet revolution was going to be that

465
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:43,840
there would be pro level applications for tablets that really made a lot of sense.

466
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:49,120
Ah, see my pro on my computer and my consumer like basic bitch apps are on my tablet.

467
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:54,000
But you're like a hyper pro, right? I'm talking pro apps like write some company

468
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:59,840
who has like a hangar or a factory, some custom tablet app for their format or quality control

469
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:03,840
people or something like that. Right. Yeah. And then that makes a lot of sense for them.

470
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:09,760
Yeah, I. I'm very conflicted, Chris. You know, you've really hurt me here. This is.

471
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:17,600
I feel like it is a it's a rich person's toy and not that I am rich. I am not rich,

472
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:24,000
but it is. Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Vice, Mr. Gore, Mr. Gore. Nobody. Nobody in my situation

473
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:29,200
after years and years and years and years and years of grinding it out to make a podcast network work

474
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:33,040
is is rich. Nobody. I don't know about a podcast network, but tell me more about

475
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:39,040
grinding it out for 10 years. Oh, yeah. It just leaves you devastated. Right. So I mean, at best,

476
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:47,200
at best, I'm back to not even, you know. Oh, I had. Oh, what was it? Oh, just something just

477
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:54,000
recently just crossed my. Oh, garbage bags. So, yeah, garbage bags. This is how my life has changed.

478
00:42:54,000 --> 00:43:01,680
I'm not rich, but. So my garbage really stinks right now in my house, you know, my RV, it's

479
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:07,040
full of garlic. I roasted a I roasted a bunch of garlic and then I like I threw out like the husks

480
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:12,880
and everything and the and the garbage just frickin reeks in a delicious way. But it makes

481
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:19,280
because the RV is only 47 feet long, it makes the whole RV smell like garlic. And we're going into

482
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:25,120
two days of this whole RV smelling like garlic. And I'm sitting there in the RV finally by myself

483
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:30,480
for the first time in weeks. And I'm thinking to myself. Why haven't because the garbage is only

484
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:33,920
half full because I haven't been home much and neither has the idea and neither of the kids.

485
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:39,520
So, like, why is the garbage only half full? And yet I'm still putting up with the smell,

486
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:44,720
like, why haven't I taken it out yet? And I'm like, am I that lazy that I haven't just collected

487
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:49,600
the garbage and taken it out in the last couple of days? And then I realized, oh, no, what it was

488
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:55,920
is I didn't want to waste the money. The negative space in the garbage bag. I only have so much room,

489
00:43:55,920 --> 00:44:00,560
right? I mean, I only have so much money. I can only buy so many garbage bags. And if we run out

490
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:05,840
of garbage bags before my next paycheck, I can't buy any more garbage bags. So we need to make

491
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:10,720
every garbage bag last and therefore everything must smell like garlic for the next three days,

492
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:16,400
because God forbid that I throw out a garbage bag that is half full. And I'm sat there and I realized,

493
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:20,720
you know what? I can now afford more garbage bags. I can take that out.

494
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:24,800
Do you know what the worst part of this conversation is? That's exactly what I do with

495
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:30,480
garbage bags. Till they're full to the brim, baby. It doesn't matter if they reek, right?

496
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:32,480
Yeah. Hey, listen, let me burn some candles.

497
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:37,040
I mean, that's why, like, I say all this stuff about the iPad Pro with, like, a lot of couching,

498
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:43,200
because to me, like, I understand how much that money means. $1,200. And I didn't even get enough

499
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:51,280
storage. But, because I got the 256 gig unit. But here's how I feel about the iPad Pro now.

500
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:58,720
I'm not shitting you when I say, when I look back at the last 20 plus years of me building

501
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:05,040
and buying computers, this is one of the best computers I have ever bought. And with that said,

502
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:14,400
if I were to fill this iPad up, I will buy another iPad Pro. Because, in fact, I can already envision

503
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:20,400
how multiple iPad Pros would make me more productive. I have never had a computer that

504
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:25,600
has been so universally successful in how I use it for work, how I use it for pleasure,

505
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:30,400
how my little daughter wants to use a computer, and how my fiance wants to use a computer.

506
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:37,040
I have never had a machine that has been that successful across that range of work demands,

507
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:46,720
while having outstanding battery life, mind-blowing performance, and USB-C universal charging. It,

508
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:53,120
to me, is one of the best computers I have owned in the last 25 plus, maybe 30 years.

509
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:58,000
I actually agree with everything you just said.

510
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:02,800
Really? Even with all the limitations of iOS and Apple's ecosystem?

511
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:06,080
I still don't think the limitations are really iOS. I mean, my file system complaint,

512
00:46:06,080 --> 00:46:11,280
I think you correctly shut down as being petty. That's my word that Chris did not call me petty.

513
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:12,080
Please don't tweet.

514
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:18,880
What about, okay, but what about the limitations of iOS? It's a thing like XMM points out. What

515
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:21,200
about multiple fricking user accounts? iOS is-

516
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:24,560
We're going to get there though, right? That's iOS 13. That's going back to your argument.

517
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:29,040
The limitation that, the only thing that stops me from just calling up the Apple

518
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:34,880
business rep like, yo, ship me a MacBook, is has app review found Jesus?

519
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:41,200
If I come up with something really cool for iOS, and I spend the next

520
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:48,080
N months developing it, and being a variable, of course, am I just going to get rejected?

521
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:52,720
You know what I mean? Am I going to have another winter of no product launches?

522
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:57,360
Yes. Unless they really figure it out. And I don't, I mean,

523
00:46:57,360 --> 00:47:02,160
Fairight, to be honest, really is impressive. It's an amazing, it's one of those unassuming

524
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:08,160
applications when you launch it, it seems simple. It gets, I mean, it even says,

525
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:15,200
it says, I recognize that you've hooked up the Zoom U22 USB audio interface. It has the full

526
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:20,720
name of the device and everything. So that's, I mean, that's getting close.

527
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:28,880
I am trying to figure out like Photoshop's coming to iPad,

528
00:47:30,560 --> 00:47:33,280
that app you're discussing for editing video and audio.

529
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:41,040
What is it that Apple sees this device as? Because right now I see it as a case by case basis.

530
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,880
They like Photoshop, so Photoshop goes in. They like media production,

531
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:48,960
so media production is okay. But what if you want to do something a little crazier,

532
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:52,560
right? Or not, I don't like the word crazy, but if you want to do something a little more

533
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:59,920
engineering-y. Because this is the Windows RT dream, the trademark pending, come true.

534
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:04,160
It really is. Like from the device, you know what, that A whatever processor is amazing.

535
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:08,800
I mean, if you want, if you're really nerdy, go look at the Geekbench scores.

536
00:48:10,080 --> 00:48:15,520
I could buy a new MacBook Pro today and it would not be as powerful in most cases as this iPad Pro,

537
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:19,280
unless I just spend like $3,000. It could do more though.

538
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:25,040
It could do more. But as a software developer who has a lot of experience in Coco,

539
00:48:26,080 --> 00:48:30,240
I should really be able to capitalize on this, not to be a dirty capitalist.

540
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:36,960
I know, I agree. But the fact that if I spend all hundreds of man hours working on this,

541
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:40,560
my dogs are raging Android fans and they're really upset. I don't know if you can hear

542
00:48:40,560 --> 00:48:47,760
them in the background. If I spend months developing a iOS-specific pro-level engineering

543
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:53,920
product, what assurance would I have that Apple doesn't turn around and just say, no?

544
00:48:58,160 --> 00:49:02,800
Let's say they say yes. What assurance do I have they don't just feature some competitor one day,

545
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:07,760
or at the same time? The whole gatekeeper thing still rubs me.

546
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:13,120
Yeah. Yeah. If it's a pro machine, we need to be able to load our own pro applications.

547
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:18,080
I would think I should be able to write custom... Like Riffin is a product I sell

548
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:23,360
that is not on any app store. You have to call me and you buy it.

549
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:28,240
Or Jupyter Broadcasting is developing this automation system to encode, upload, publish,

550
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:34,000
and distribute podcasts. That is a very custom piece of software. It's never going to be approved

551
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:38,080
in the app store, but it would be great to be able to execute that stuff from the tablet,

552
00:49:38,080 --> 00:49:42,320
especially one that could encode audio and video super fast, like the iPad Pro.

553
00:49:42,320 --> 00:49:45,360
And they're never going to say okay to that. That's never going to get accepted.

554
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:51,200
So it's not really pro. I would challenge, why do you need the app store?

555
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:55,760
For these type of customers, why do you need the app?

556
00:49:55,760 --> 00:50:00,240
Right. They should have called it the iPad Plus, not the iPad Pro.

557
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:06,720
It's not a professional machine. It is a pro consumer machine that is really, really kick ass

558
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:13,040
at doing consumer workflows or basic, you know, mid-level management and up workflows.

559
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:18,240
People that are making things and creating things, we have to use crazy shims like ISH,

560
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:23,680
which is emulating an entire x86 stack and then running Alpine Linux on top of that.

561
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:28,000
You know what? You know what? That's my tool of the week, ISH.

562
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:32,080
That's my tool of the week, ISH, but it is insane the way that works.

563
00:50:32,080 --> 00:50:32,960
It's so good, man.

564
00:50:33,840 --> 00:50:37,120
But it's so messed up what those folks have to do to get that app to work.

565
00:50:37,120 --> 00:50:39,360
Yeah. It's one developer as far as I understand.

566
00:50:39,360 --> 00:50:40,720
It's one guy. Yeah, that's my understanding.

567
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:44,480
One guy, and he's got a lot of plans. And I'm using it right now.

568
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:46,480
And it's got a package manager. It's great.

569
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:52,800
Well, you know what? They let ISH in. So again, you said no, but maybe I am dated.

570
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:55,600
It's not from the app store. You got to get the test pilot.

571
00:50:55,600 --> 00:50:57,120
Oh, that's right. You got to be on test flight.

572
00:50:57,120 --> 00:50:58,720
Yeah, test flight. That's what it is. Test flight.

573
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:03,920
Yeah. So we'll see. I think that's actually a bellwether.

574
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:04,640
If ISH-

575
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:08,480
Like if ISH is in the app store, then I think I'm just wrong.

576
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:13,760
And, you know, I'm not even asserting that Apple's the problem here actually.

577
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:15,600
I don't know. That's my concern.

578
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:19,680
We'll see. Maybe people haven't tried. I doubt it. I doubt it. We'll see.

579
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:32,080
Command lines, ISH, or God forbid, God forbid, Apple ship the BSD user subsystem for iOS

580
00:51:32,080 --> 00:51:34,480
that actually gives you access.

581
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:37,520
Wait, wait, wait. Can we just summon Alan? Alan, let's go.

582
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:42,240
I know, right? I mean, Apple could ship this. It doesn't need a whole x86 emulator.

583
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:46,240
Apple could expose the user land, even in a contained environment.

584
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:51,920
They could expose some of the user land utilities that are there on the iPad running natively in iOS.

585
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:53,280
It's all there.

586
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:56,880
The fact that you have to construct a virtual machine and then build a user land on top of it

587
00:51:56,880 --> 00:52:01,760
with a distribution that's built for containers is ridiculous and shouldn't exist.

588
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:08,400
And Apple could just flick their fingers and create a subsystem for iOS,

589
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:12,720
like Microsoft has for Windows and like Google is doing for Chrome right now.

590
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:15,360
And if Apple wants to keep up with what their competitors are doing,

591
00:52:15,360 --> 00:52:18,560
they better take a look at this and they better take a look at ISH.

592
00:52:18,560 --> 00:52:21,760
And in their best interest, they better let this thing in the app store

593
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:23,840
because otherwise they're going to get left behind.

594
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:27,440
People want access to Bash. They want the command line.

595
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:32,560
And it's there. Apple just doesn't give it to you right now.

596
00:52:32,560 --> 00:52:34,160
I'm going to abstract that out a little bit.

597
00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:39,200
You and I want Bash, right? And in some cases when I'm drunk, Z shell.

598
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:42,560
Developers want, but developers want Bash.

599
00:52:42,560 --> 00:52:45,120
But people in general just want to get their job done.

600
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:46,640
And they, you know, I got to be honest with you.

601
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:49,520
Like we get some criticism on Reddit that I'm always talking about hardware.

602
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:52,800
I am so tired of paving laptops.

603
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:53,600
Hmm.

604
00:52:54,320 --> 00:52:56,160
Like this is a dumb problem to have.

605
00:52:56,160 --> 00:52:58,640
It is right. It's so exhausting.

606
00:52:58,640 --> 00:53:00,240
Like, you know, who's working for me?

607
00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:05,040
My very boring, very ugly Dell Optiplex tower that's sitting here, right?

608
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:08,320
I hooked up a throttle and a trigger to it to make it a, uh,

609
00:53:08,320 --> 00:53:12,800
and put in a beefier graphics card. And it was my flight sim machine.

610
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:18,000
Now I needed it as a desktop. So it has an L I booted it in its elementary partition.

611
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,160
I needed more storage. I'm sorry.

612
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:21,920
And people call me an old man on Twitter for this.

613
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:28,480
You know what I did, Chris? I bought a terabyte, 720 RPM drive or 7,200 RPM drive.

614
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:32,720
And I, and one of the many open days when I opened the case, by the way,

615
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:37,120
Wait, wait, what you have, you have a physical drive that you're putting in your desktop.

616
00:53:37,120 --> 00:53:39,200
A physical drive that you're putting inside a machine.

617
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:42,160
And it took me, and I had my two year old sitting next to me.

618
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:44,800
I let him help me with that. I let him do one of the latches.

619
00:53:45,360 --> 00:53:50,080
It took like 10 minutes and it's shared between the Linux partition and the windows one.

620
00:53:50,080 --> 00:53:50,560
Yeah.

621
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:55,600
And it just, it's like not, not to like troll Apple. It just works.

622
00:53:55,600 --> 00:53:58,640
And otherwise the hard drive was a hundred percent full.

623
00:53:58,640 --> 00:54:02,160
I was going to have to buy a new machine or do a crazy external thing, which I think is crazy.

624
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:08,880
It doesn't have Thunderbolt. So like, I don't know, man. I'm tired of this crap.

625
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:11,680
I'm tired of being like, I got a new laptop. Here's for a few,

626
00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:13,600
which is weird because next episode we have a laptop review.

627
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:17,760
Yeah. I was just going to, so at the beginning of this, I was going to ask you

628
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:23,280
if you had imaged or if you had started a new, but either way you go, it's pretty freaking

629
00:54:25,120 --> 00:54:29,440
easy for me to say it's really painless because you have all of the app store

630
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:36,080
or restores. So you can restore any app you've ever bought. And if you're a LastPass user,

631
00:54:36,080 --> 00:54:41,760
the integration of LastPass and Face ID means that you can just pop into the app,

632
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:46,640
go to the login screen, Face ID checks your face and it logs you into the application and Bob's

633
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:53,200
your uncle, you're signed into the app. My point is the process to set up an iPad is 10 times faster

634
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:58,400
than the process to set up a PC. In some of, in some respects is because I can do about 10 times

635
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:04,080
less stuff, you know, but the stuff I can do, holy shit, man. I got that set up. So I got that iPad

636
00:55:04,080 --> 00:55:10,000
set up and good to go in two hours. It takes two days for a laptop for me. I got to fiddle through

637
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:14,640
everything. Well, that's the thing. So let's say like, I want to jump on this iPad per opportunity

638
00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:18,560
and then we should wrap up because we have another recording. He's going to take, let's just say like,

639
00:55:18,560 --> 00:55:22,800
I got up tomorrow morning and like drove to the app store and bought a MacBook pro, right? It will

640
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:30,640
take me because I have other things that I need to do at least, at least until the weekend to actually

641
00:55:30,640 --> 00:55:36,640
be up and running. Yeah. And yes, I'm finicky. And I got to spend at least an evening to get the

642
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:42,880
basic stuff going though. Right. And evening, I got to get Dropbox, got to get all that stuff set up.

643
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:48,720
You still run Dropbox. Yeah. Doesn't that eat your CPU on Linux? It's a long story. Don't get me

644
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:55,680
going. Okay. We can save it for next week if you want. Yeah. Because I had it on my elementary

645
00:55:55,680 --> 00:56:00,880
partition here and then I was like, Oh, this is terrible. I just installed a library this morning.

646
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:07,280
In fact, had to build it myself and then do the whole install process to trick Dropbox on a couple

647
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:14,720
of my systems to use XFS because Dropbox has dropped support for everything, but extended

648
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:21,520
for on Linux. And I use XFS because it's a better file system. So that's what I spent my morning

649
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:27,600
doing that and being told I'm flying to Texas on Sunday night. So, all right, Mr. Dominic,

650
00:56:27,600 --> 00:56:32,000
well, I know we have much more to get into, including some cute follow-up and correction,

651
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:37,760
some community feedback and some new laptop news. So tell people in the meantime where they can find

652
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:42,960
you throughout the week and what you're doing. They can find me on Twitter at Dumanuco and at
