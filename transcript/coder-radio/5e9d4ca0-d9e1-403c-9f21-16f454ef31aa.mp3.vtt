00:00.000 --> 00:15.720
This is KOTORadio, episode 426 for August 9th, 2021.

00:15.720 --> 00:20.600
Hello friends and welcome into Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show, taking a pragmatic look

00:20.600 --> 00:24.460
at the art and the business of software development and the world of technology.

00:24.460 --> 00:26.320
This episode is brought to you by Cloud Guru.

00:26.320 --> 00:31.520
You know, Cloud Guru has got that cloud playground, Azure, AWS, and Google Cloud Sandboxes on

00:31.520 --> 00:33.000
ACG's credit card.

00:33.000 --> 00:34.000
Not yours.

00:34.000 --> 00:38.240
Get certified, get hired, get learning at a CloudGuru.com.

00:38.240 --> 00:43.280
My name is Chris and joining us, ready to podcast like the pro he is, with tea in hand,

00:43.280 --> 00:45.320
it's our host, Mr. Dominic.

00:45.320 --> 00:46.320
Hello Mike.

00:46.320 --> 00:48.440
Happy tea time, Chris, although it's way too early.

00:48.440 --> 00:49.440
Happy tea time.

00:49.440 --> 00:50.440
It's kind of.

00:50.440 --> 00:52.800
It's our unofficial KOTOR tea time, one o'clock.

00:52.800 --> 00:53.920
Oh, what a mess, dude.

00:53.920 --> 00:58.400
It's such a mess because we just got the new, the new show time and then I hit the road.

00:58.400 --> 01:01.800
So now it's a, it's a totally different time for me because I'm in mountain time.

01:01.800 --> 01:03.260
It's a totally different time for you.

01:03.260 --> 01:04.840
You're in Eastern time.

01:04.840 --> 01:08.260
The whole thing I thought was going to come crashing down because I thought we turned

01:08.260 --> 01:12.520
into a bus of super spreaders about five days ago, four days ago.

01:12.520 --> 01:15.560
I thought the whole crew was going to come down with the Rona.

01:15.560 --> 01:17.400
Oh crap.

01:17.400 --> 01:22.900
So we're getting, we're getting into Idaho and my son comes down with a fever and it's

01:22.900 --> 01:24.280
not looking good.

01:24.280 --> 01:27.860
He's down for the count and we're thinking, what else could this be?

01:27.860 --> 01:31.600
And if he's got it, then maybe other other people in on board have it.

01:31.600 --> 01:35.020
Like we're going to have to cancel the meetup and we start strategizing.

01:35.020 --> 01:39.320
We get to, we get to Idaho and we start thinking, well, maybe we turn around and or maybe we

01:39.320 --> 01:43.840
wait here and we isolate and see if we're sick and cancel the first meetup in Salt Lake

01:43.840 --> 01:44.840
city.

01:44.840 --> 01:47.580
You know, we're trying to strategize the entire thing because like now we've got Corona on

01:47.580 --> 01:49.060
board, right?

01:49.060 --> 01:52.400
And a couple of days go by and uh, we haven't seen anybody.

01:52.400 --> 01:53.600
We're not sure like what to do.

01:53.600 --> 01:56.880
So we just kind of had, oh, there was a windstorm too, so we had to stay put anyways.

01:56.880 --> 02:02.040
So that worked out and we wake up the next morning and my son's feeling different.

02:02.040 --> 02:06.240
Like if the fever has broken, he's, he's not really feeling so exhausted anymore, but he's

02:06.240 --> 02:08.920
got this big lump on his face.

02:08.920 --> 02:11.960
I'm looking at this lump and I'm going, wait a minute here.

02:11.960 --> 02:15.520
And we start replaying like history, you know, you start going back through your brain archive

02:15.520 --> 02:22.160
and I realized like four or five days ago, whenever we left, he chipped his tooth on a,

02:22.160 --> 02:26.760
on a sucker on a hard candy and I bet he cracked it and got an infection.

02:26.760 --> 02:30.960
So we took him into urgent care and sure enough, it was an infected tooth that had caused the

02:30.960 --> 02:34.680
fever and him not feeling well and we got him on some antibiotics and he's just doing

02:34.680 --> 02:39.440
great now, but it wasn't, it wasn't the Rona at all, but I had a total COVID panic because

02:39.440 --> 02:42.400
I thought, what if, you know, what if we go to the meetup and we've got COVID or something

02:42.400 --> 02:46.960
because we're trying to be careful, obviously we're all taking extra precautions and we

02:46.960 --> 02:50.520
thought, you know, something had gotten us either anyways, but it turned out just to

02:50.520 --> 02:53.720
be a cracked tooth and he's on the mend.

02:53.720 --> 03:00.400
That's been my week, not to mention driving and working.

03:00.400 --> 03:01.720
And you remain in Florida.

03:01.720 --> 03:04.920
So I remain in the sunshine state.

03:04.920 --> 03:09.000
Well, Mr. Dominic, with all that aside, what do you say, should we get in some feedback?

03:09.000 --> 03:11.600
Let's hear what the screaming gnome users have to say.

03:11.600 --> 03:13.240
Oh, too soon.

03:13.240 --> 03:18.020
Actually, I think we, I think we made it clear this week, David writes in and he really just,

03:18.020 --> 03:22.440
he has the key to using Linux, he says is boring old hardware.

03:22.440 --> 03:26.280
He says, Linux hardware is a lot better years after it's come out.

03:26.280 --> 03:30.760
It seems a vendor sell Linux with some initial options, but in my experience, the support

03:30.760 --> 03:32.040
doesn't tend to be that great.

03:32.040 --> 03:33.720
It isn't refined yet.

03:33.720 --> 03:37.880
It seems much better to install something like an LTS Ubuntu or some other reliable

03:37.880 --> 03:41.960
distro on hardware that's frankly had some time to simmer.

03:41.960 --> 03:46.080
I haven't purchased Linux as an option from a vendor since I prefer to install Linux on

03:46.080 --> 03:47.080
my own.

03:47.080 --> 03:50.240
More recently, I purchased a brand new T-series ThinkPad.

03:50.240 --> 03:54.680
At release, Kubuntu's install was broken and Mate just wasn't stable.

03:54.680 --> 03:58.880
I switched things up and let things sit for a while and after revisiting it a little while

03:58.880 --> 04:02.480
later, I was pleasantly surprised how refined it was.

04:02.480 --> 04:06.920
The deciding factor of Linux desktop quality seems to be the open source projects familiarity

04:06.920 --> 04:08.320
with the hardware.

04:08.320 --> 04:12.760
The oldest popular machines always enjoy the best support, while the latest models typically

04:12.760 --> 04:17.520
have bugs, bad defaults, and or drivers that just don't work well.

04:17.520 --> 04:21.840
I know Mike doesn't like to touch his workstations and just wants to order a product from the

04:21.840 --> 04:27.080
manufacturer, but with the way support actually happens on Linux, it seems like he'd be better

04:27.080 --> 04:33.240
served reinstalling his own OS from the downloaded ISO after the hardware has gotten a bit older.

04:33.240 --> 04:38.640
This has always been the mainstream way desktop Linux is deployed and it's a first class citizen

04:38.640 --> 04:39.640
there.

04:39.640 --> 04:43.240
And while regulations from the vendor is new and not nearly as popular, at least today

04:43.240 --> 04:48.600
it seems you get a second class experience when it comes to Linux hardware support.

04:48.600 --> 04:52.480
But the older devices work great, love the show, keep it up, David.

04:52.480 --> 04:57.200
So he's saying stop buying new hardware and buy a used machine and put Linux on it.

04:57.200 --> 05:00.200
But I love new hardware.

05:00.200 --> 05:01.200
I know I thought that too.

05:01.200 --> 05:03.880
It's like, well, that sounds kind of boring, right?

05:03.880 --> 05:04.880
Yeah.

05:04.880 --> 05:10.360
Plus, like, I mean, you got a job to do, you want something fast and powerful, right?

05:10.360 --> 05:11.360
Yes.

05:11.360 --> 05:12.360
And with no fan.

05:12.360 --> 05:18.360
That hurts right now because my laptop is working hard and you know it.

05:18.360 --> 05:19.480
You know it.

05:19.480 --> 05:24.440
Hey, so I went to the Salt Lake City meetup and it went great.

05:24.440 --> 05:25.440
And guess what?

05:25.440 --> 05:27.800
A lot of Koda Radio love there.

05:27.800 --> 05:29.720
Several people mentioned it was their favorite podcast.

05:29.720 --> 05:36.760
There was some serious Salt Lake City love and so everybody says hi and they missed you.

05:36.760 --> 05:41.680
And I think there were more iPhones and Mac users there than Linux and Android devices.

05:41.680 --> 05:45.360
Yeah, I think JB is really a Mac network now, just saying.

05:45.360 --> 05:47.240
But that meetup, there was a lot there.

05:47.240 --> 05:48.440
It was a good mix, though.

05:48.440 --> 05:53.180
We had some engineers, we had some security analysts, but it was pretty cool.

05:53.180 --> 05:58.060
It was a great chance to just reconnect with folks and hear what they like about the shows,

05:58.060 --> 06:00.360
how they found the shows, all that kind of stuff.

06:00.360 --> 06:03.200
And Koda Radio was well-repped.

06:03.200 --> 06:06.720
The next meetup is going to be in Denver on August 20th.

06:06.720 --> 06:09.440
That's all linked up at meetup.com slash Jupiter Broadcasting.

06:09.440 --> 06:12.440
It's going to be a big event there.

06:12.440 --> 06:15.520
So go check out the meetup page and see if you can make it.

06:15.520 --> 06:18.060
It's going to be like a big deal.

06:18.060 --> 06:19.060
It's going to be fun.

06:19.060 --> 06:22.080
We're going to have giveaways, Raspberry Pi's, swag.

06:22.080 --> 06:23.080
It's going to be huge.

06:23.080 --> 06:27.560
Linode's going to have people there that are like spoiling everybody.

06:27.560 --> 06:32.200
So meetup.com slash Jupiter Broadcasting.

06:32.200 --> 06:33.820
Linode.com slash Koder.

06:33.820 --> 06:37.240
Go there to get $100 and 60 day credit on a new account.

06:37.240 --> 06:38.640
And of course, you support the show.

06:38.640 --> 06:44.020
I host all of my servers on Linode and I think you'd like them to Linode is independently

06:44.020 --> 06:49.560
owned and they've been redefining how great cloud computing can be for 18 years.

06:49.560 --> 06:51.940
You'll learn a few things in that time.

06:51.940 --> 06:57.280
This road trip I'm on right now to reunite with the audience and with the JB team.

06:57.280 --> 07:03.560
It's being powered by Linode in every sense of the word and my business runs on Linode.

07:03.560 --> 07:06.700
That's how much I trust them and that's why I can recommend them.

07:06.700 --> 07:11.740
They have 11 data centers around the world, award winning customer support and a dashboard

07:11.740 --> 07:16.720
to manage everything that sets the bar in the industry.

07:16.720 --> 07:19.800
But let's be real, I also love them because they're fast.

07:19.800 --> 07:21.200
I mean, that matters.

07:21.200 --> 07:25.760
Performance is a big factor in my choice here and their servers, their network connections,

07:25.760 --> 07:30.880
even just deploying a server, creating a snapshot, upgrading the memory in one of my boxes.

07:30.880 --> 07:36.200
It all happens really fast and with clear status and feedback as to what is happening

07:36.200 --> 07:40.840
while you're doing the action so you know exactly what's going on.

07:40.840 --> 07:46.480
Recently we deployed our live tracker so you can see the progress of our road trip at colonytracker.live.

07:46.480 --> 07:49.380
And yeah, all of that runs on top of Linode.

07:49.380 --> 07:52.600
It was straightforward to set it up and start using and they loved it.

07:52.600 --> 07:54.820
In fact, Linode got so on board.

07:54.820 --> 07:57.320
They helped make some artwork for the page and all of it.

07:57.320 --> 08:00.720
So go check out colonytracker.live if you haven't seen that yet.

08:00.720 --> 08:05.800
That website is running on Linode and then that embedded map is running on own tracks,

08:05.800 --> 08:09.800
which we have running on a Linode all on open source software.

08:09.800 --> 08:11.520
How great is that?

08:11.520 --> 08:14.420
Anytime we're deploying something for ourselves and production behind the scenes that the

08:14.420 --> 08:18.820
audience never sees or stuff that is going to be facing to the audience, we always deploy

08:18.820 --> 08:19.820
that on Linode.

08:19.820 --> 08:24.080
Now we have for over two years now and it's really the best choice out there when you

08:24.080 --> 08:29.120
combine the support, the performance, the dashboard, the data center locations, the

08:29.120 --> 08:32.560
fact that they're independently owned and not getting jerked around by different VC

08:32.560 --> 08:33.560
funding.

08:33.560 --> 08:37.080
It's really nice to know my business is with somebody who's been around for 18 years and

08:37.080 --> 08:38.760
knows what they're doing.

08:38.760 --> 08:42.240
I could go on and on about Linode and why I think it's so fantastic and why I think

08:42.240 --> 08:43.320
it's so great.

08:43.320 --> 08:46.080
But the thing that they've done to make it easier for our audience to try it out for

08:46.080 --> 08:50.400
yourselves and just get some experience is they've created that $100 credit.

08:50.400 --> 08:53.080
So you can go to linode.com slash coder.

08:53.080 --> 08:58.480
You get $100 in credit on a new account for 60 days and you can go experiment with stuff.

08:58.480 --> 09:03.040
Go see why we use them, why we choose them over and over again for yourselves.

09:03.040 --> 09:08.200
Plus it's an opportunity to learn something, an opportunity to test something and an opportunity

09:08.200 --> 09:11.780
to support independent content like the Coder radio program.

09:11.780 --> 09:12.780
How great is that?

09:12.780 --> 09:15.440
It's a check in the box all the way down kind of thing.

09:15.440 --> 09:21.240
So go to linode.com slash coder, get $100 support the show and kick the tires.

09:21.240 --> 09:26.140
It's linode.com slash coder.

09:26.140 --> 09:31.320
The internet is freaking out this week because Apple has announced it plans to scan images

09:31.320 --> 09:35.320
in children's iMessage and in iCloud.

09:35.320 --> 09:40.240
Kind of two separate functions, but they were announced at the same time.

09:40.240 --> 09:45.600
And everybody says this is an era of censorship and monitoring that Apple is just rolling

09:45.600 --> 09:46.600
out.

09:46.600 --> 09:51.680
So it seems the slippery slope argument here is once you build a technology that can identify

09:51.680 --> 09:55.960
types of images, it doesn't take long until governments come knocking on your door like

09:55.960 --> 09:59.560
China or Russia and say, add these hashes to your mix.

09:59.560 --> 10:04.240
Well, we were briefly talking about this in our Slack and what was my first reaction?

10:04.240 --> 10:07.160
Wait till Beijing gets their little paws on this one, right?

10:07.160 --> 10:12.560
Like this is, remember the old DRM arguments from the nineties, Chris, let's take the time

10:12.560 --> 10:13.560
machine.

10:13.560 --> 10:14.560
Sure.

10:14.560 --> 10:15.560
It seems so reasonable, right?

10:15.560 --> 10:21.840
Like these small indie developers were making their little games, their shareware, whatever,

10:21.840 --> 10:24.520
productivity software, whatever, whatever have you.

10:24.520 --> 10:26.760
And it just seems like a little bit of protection, right?

10:26.760 --> 10:27.760
So like, let's get some keys.

10:27.760 --> 10:29.720
Oh, but you know, you own the disc, man.

10:29.720 --> 10:30.720
You got the disc, you got the game.

10:30.720 --> 10:31.720
That's it.

10:31.720 --> 10:33.680
You just need the product key.

10:33.680 --> 10:34.680
And it activates once.

10:34.680 --> 10:37.840
Well now we have, most things are basically always online.

10:37.840 --> 10:44.240
In fact, I just got an Xbox series S, the little one, the digital only one.

10:44.240 --> 10:47.200
And this slapped me in the face, literally the night I got it.

10:47.200 --> 10:52.720
My router happened to decide to poop the bed and all the games I had spent all day downloading,

10:52.720 --> 10:56.640
I wanted to try Assassin's Creed, whatever the current one is.

10:56.640 --> 11:01.480
And sure enough, after like 30, 40 minutes, whatever it was with no internet connection,

11:01.480 --> 11:03.880
bam, no, you're done.

11:03.880 --> 11:06.360
My point being, you know, the intentions were good, right?

11:06.360 --> 11:09.180
Right in the beginning, we'll have these product keys, you know, help developers.

11:09.180 --> 11:11.560
The intentions are obviously good with this, right?

11:11.560 --> 11:13.240
Child abuse is bad.

11:13.240 --> 11:15.020
Should not be a thing.

11:15.020 --> 11:19.440
Anything that can be done to stop it is good, but you have to understand that once you enable

11:19.440 --> 11:25.760
this kind of surveillance functionality, have you ever heard of, I don't know, Prism, right?

11:25.760 --> 11:28.560
Any of these Snowden S things where it was like, oh, we're just gonna stop terrorists

11:28.560 --> 11:31.560
and now we're sort of listening in on everybody's phone calls.

11:31.560 --> 11:37.000
Yeah, the way this is gonna work is there's an organization called CSAM that is essentially

11:37.000 --> 11:41.280
set up to prevent child exploitation and they are generating a series of fingerprints and

11:41.280 --> 11:45.640
hashes that Apple will subscribe to and then try to match and ID those.

11:45.640 --> 11:48.680
And there's two different systems in place and one I don't really have actually much

11:48.680 --> 11:52.920
problem with, and I think it's been completely misrepresented online, and that's the iMessage

11:52.920 --> 11:54.360
functionality.

11:54.360 --> 11:56.840
This has kind of been blown way out of proportion.

11:56.840 --> 12:02.500
The iMessage scanning only happens on iCloud accounts and iPhone accounts that are part

12:02.500 --> 12:05.880
of a family plan and 12 years of age.

12:05.880 --> 12:09.160
Above 12 years of age and still part of a family plan, there is some functionality,

12:09.160 --> 12:10.160
but it's different.

12:10.160 --> 12:15.440
12 years of age and below, it's looking for those fingerprints in the iMessage pictures,

12:15.440 --> 12:20.160
it could be SMS or iMessage, and then it sends a push notification to the parent.

12:20.160 --> 12:22.760
It doesn't notify Apple when something is found.

12:22.760 --> 12:27.200
And that actually seems like kind of a reasonable implementation because my kids have got iOS

12:27.200 --> 12:30.800
devices, and I absolutely don't want them doing anything like that, and as long as I'm

12:30.800 --> 12:34.400
notified and it doesn't report it to anybody, I think that's actually a pretty reasonable

12:34.400 --> 12:35.400
system.

12:35.400 --> 12:36.400
It's also opt-in.

12:36.400 --> 12:39.200
It's not on by default.

12:39.200 --> 12:45.840
If you're above 12 years old and you're part of a family plan, I don't know if maybe it's

12:45.840 --> 12:49.160
like it drops the notification to the parents, but it still blocks the image or something.

12:49.160 --> 12:51.400
I can't remember because I didn't look into that part of it.

12:51.400 --> 12:56.380
Then there's the iCloud part where it's scanning it, and if you opt into iCloud photo library,

12:56.380 --> 12:59.520
they're going to be looking for these fingerprints throughout your iCloud photo library.

12:59.520 --> 13:04.520
If they find something that matches a fingerprint, it notifies a person, like somebody in the

13:04.520 --> 13:09.960
department at Apple who then has to review a low-resolution image to verify if it's child

13:09.960 --> 13:13.560
porn or not and then alert the authorities after that.

13:13.560 --> 13:17.120
And I guess there's even like a threshold because there could be some possible false

13:17.120 --> 13:21.560
IDs, so it's like if you get triggered a few times, like nothing happens.

13:21.560 --> 13:27.560
It takes several triggerings of this algorithm before it actually alerts somebody.

13:27.560 --> 13:32.360
And I think if you look at what Apple has planned here, it's totally fine, really.

13:32.360 --> 13:34.000
That implementation is pretty reasonable.

13:34.000 --> 13:37.000
It is 100% the slippery slope argument.

13:37.000 --> 13:44.400
And I think the more... I can kind of believe Apple if they say that we are going to refuse

13:44.400 --> 13:47.600
government demands to expand the photo scanning beyond the CSAM.

13:47.600 --> 13:51.280
We will refuse that, they've said that a couple of times.

13:51.280 --> 13:54.960
I could believe that if one of these two scenarios is true.

13:54.960 --> 14:00.440
If this is Apple's Hail Mary move to prevent having to build in back doors to all of their

14:00.440 --> 14:05.360
software for law enforcement, if they can say, look, your argument that you need encryption

14:05.360 --> 14:10.400
back doors into everything we do to save the children is null and void now because we've

14:10.400 --> 14:12.040
built this technology.

14:12.040 --> 14:15.660
And we're going to scan these images just like Facebook does in Facebook Messenger.

14:15.660 --> 14:17.400
And we're going to participate in that same program.

14:17.400 --> 14:19.420
So now you don't need a back door key.

14:19.420 --> 14:23.760
If that's why they're doing this, I can kind of believe them that they won't have scope

14:23.760 --> 14:25.600
creep.

14:25.600 --> 14:30.920
But perhaps another alternative reason they could be doing this is because some sort of

14:30.920 --> 14:35.160
optimistic woke culture has told them they can save the children in the world by doing

14:35.160 --> 14:39.880
this and it is with full unbridled optimism and cooperation with CSAM that they're going

14:39.880 --> 14:41.440
to save the children.

14:41.440 --> 14:46.160
And if they actually think that's the reason they're doing this, if there isn't some devious

14:46.160 --> 14:49.400
other motivation that they're not talking about being like, we want to prevent the FBI

14:49.400 --> 14:50.520
from getting back doors.

14:50.520 --> 14:54.340
If it's instead this unbridled optimism that they're presenting publicly, then it's totally

14:54.340 --> 14:55.520
going to get fucked with.

14:55.520 --> 14:56.520
No doubt about it.

14:56.520 --> 14:57.720
It's totally going to get screwed with.

14:57.720 --> 15:02.440
If it's the first one and they're trying to do a ninja move to prevent back doors, I'm

15:02.440 --> 15:03.440
on board.

15:03.440 --> 15:04.440
But we will never know.

15:04.440 --> 15:05.440
We'll never know.

15:05.440 --> 15:06.880
And so you just wish it never had come up.

15:06.880 --> 15:11.480
You just wish they'd never opened this Pandora's box and they're not going to be able to put

15:11.480 --> 15:12.480
this away.

15:12.480 --> 15:15.980
I guess I don't understand how you think that little judo move would work because every

15:15.980 --> 15:21.960
time, you know, let's say since, I don't know, the early aughts, right, we've had an encroachment

15:21.960 --> 15:27.640
on privacy by any government, it's always been, okay, we're going to do this, but nothing

15:27.640 --> 15:28.640
more.

15:28.640 --> 15:29.640
Right?

15:29.640 --> 15:30.640
Remember kids, it's just metadata.

15:30.640 --> 15:32.160
Well, it turns out not so much.

15:32.160 --> 15:33.160
All right.

15:33.160 --> 15:34.160
I'm just.

15:34.160 --> 15:35.160
I agree.

15:35.160 --> 15:36.480
I think that's most likely what's going to happen.

15:36.480 --> 15:41.120
I think if you look at the history of Apple and their battle over the San Bernardino iPhone,

15:41.120 --> 15:46.520
the little pivot they had to do back in 2008 around encrypting backups because the FBI asked

15:46.520 --> 15:50.760
them not to have a link about that in the show notes, they've been very strategic in

15:50.760 --> 15:53.500
how they're dealing with law enforcement and the access they get.

15:53.500 --> 16:00.040
And that encroachment on privacy is often done at the rally call of save the children.

16:00.040 --> 16:05.880
And the director of the FBI, the last couple of directors of the FBI have been tested,

16:05.880 --> 16:10.180
have been testifying saying, we have to get access to encrypted chat to save the children.

16:10.180 --> 16:15.400
We have to save the children or else pornography will spread through encrypted chat.

16:15.400 --> 16:20.580
And if that is the lever that they are trying to use to open Apple's back door, this could

16:20.580 --> 16:24.240
be their cover up for their ass and well, you don't need that now because we've we've

16:24.240 --> 16:29.080
solved that problem for you using technology and algorithms.

16:29.080 --> 16:30.600
So don't worry about it.

16:30.600 --> 16:32.480
The algorithm is on it now.

16:32.480 --> 16:37.680
And they'll tell the FBI to, you know, sod off now because they've got this built in

16:37.680 --> 16:41.520
and that they're now they're their reason for needing backdoor encryption is null and

16:41.520 --> 16:42.520
void.

16:42.520 --> 16:43.520
Oh, I wouldn't.

16:43.520 --> 16:49.040
The FBI in this case or whatever law enforcement entity just say, OK, let me wait a year until

16:49.040 --> 16:51.920
there's some weird exception that Apple screwed up on.

16:51.920 --> 16:57.320
And then I'm going to go, you know, on Fox News, CNN, MSNBC and be, you know, banging

16:57.320 --> 16:58.320
the drum again.

16:58.320 --> 17:01.900
I mean, I know that's and also they're going to yell terrorism.

17:01.900 --> 17:03.880
They have to stop, you know, to stop the terrorism.

17:03.880 --> 17:09.560
It's interesting that Apple has kept this very focused on law enforcement when the more

17:09.560 --> 17:13.760
interesting question is like intelligence services, which I understand some countries,

17:13.760 --> 17:19.080
well, probably this one, too, is a little bit of a thin line, right?

17:19.080 --> 17:24.640
Because they're saying what someone who intends to take you and put you on trial can do.

17:24.640 --> 17:26.960
What about someone who has no intention of ever putting you on trial?

17:26.960 --> 17:27.960
Right.

17:27.960 --> 17:31.160
It's just like literally, I don't know, spying on every phone call.

17:31.160 --> 17:32.960
That could never happen, though, Mike.

17:32.960 --> 17:34.720
We've never seen examples of that.

17:34.720 --> 17:35.720
Come on, Mike.

17:35.720 --> 17:36.720
You've read too many Tom Clancy novels.

17:36.720 --> 17:37.720
What do you do?

17:37.720 --> 17:41.840
Oh, no, I think you're right.

17:41.840 --> 17:50.120
And I think Apple, I think Apple loses their privacy crown with this, because the way average

17:50.120 --> 17:55.240
people will see this is, well, for Apple to do this, they have to be looking at my photos.

17:55.240 --> 17:57.600
They're not going to understand the difference of like hashing things.

17:57.600 --> 18:00.880
And they're losing that argument now.

18:00.880 --> 18:05.680
Apple's privacy argument is now it's private, except for we're looking at it.

18:05.680 --> 18:07.880
So you have your your judo theory.

18:07.880 --> 18:10.880
I have my China's the biggest market in the world.

18:10.880 --> 18:15.360
It's going to be the big smart in the world for certainly our lifetime.

18:15.360 --> 18:19.360
Apple needs to probably appease Beijing.

18:19.360 --> 18:23.640
I don't know if anybody listening follows the news, but Hong Kong protests, they just

18:23.640 --> 18:30.520
got slapped down pretty, pretty hard using things like digital surveillance and just

18:30.520 --> 18:32.440
a ton of tear gas.

18:32.440 --> 18:38.000
So I can't see this not having wider implications other than CSAM, right?

18:38.000 --> 18:41.120
I understand like that's the main thing, and that's the thing they're talking about.

18:41.120 --> 18:46.160
But you know, if you can, if you can do images of child abuse, which again, no one should

18:46.160 --> 18:47.160
condone that, right?

18:47.160 --> 18:50.600
Like, go after those guys as hard as you can.

18:50.600 --> 18:56.000
But, you know, you can go to jail for like, posting a Winnie the Pooh meme in China, because

18:56.000 --> 18:59.240
like somebody said, the president of China looks like Winnie the Pooh.

18:59.240 --> 19:01.920
Why wouldn't Winnie the Pooh be part of this in China?

19:01.920 --> 19:04.960
Well, there goes Koder in China, they were screwed.

19:04.960 --> 19:06.680
Now we're done in that market.

19:06.680 --> 19:08.640
Yeah, I agree with you, man.

19:08.640 --> 19:11.360
I think that's exactly what will happen.

19:11.360 --> 19:18.040
The only kind of real world use case we have here is Apple does not make FaceTime available

19:18.040 --> 19:23.240
in Saudi Arabia, because Saudi Arabia demands that all audio and video calls be unencrypted.

19:23.240 --> 19:27.600
And so Apple just opted to make Fight FaceTime unavailable in Saudi Arabia, Saudi Arabia,

19:27.600 --> 19:28.600
though.

19:28.600 --> 19:31.000
I mean, it like, it's not China.

19:31.000 --> 19:32.000
Yeah, right.

19:32.000 --> 19:34.440
It's not the biggest market in the world.

19:34.440 --> 19:35.440
Yeah.

19:35.440 --> 19:36.440
Right.

19:36.440 --> 19:41.600
And that really is and and you you see Apple and their drive for that stock price and that

19:41.600 --> 19:43.560
drive for revenue.

19:43.560 --> 19:48.320
There's just no way Tim Cook can say no to the Chinese market and keep his job.

19:48.320 --> 19:50.040
Uncle Tim is chasing that dragon hard.

19:50.040 --> 19:54.380
Yeah, I wonder I really it's really hard to know the motivation here.

19:54.380 --> 19:58.820
And this is going to be one of those problems where if this begins to slide, because here's

19:58.820 --> 20:03.920
the other thing is we're assuming that CSAM organization is untouchable, and that they

20:03.920 --> 20:08.960
couldn't be corrupted and that images couldn't be or hashes couldn't be injected from that

20:08.960 --> 20:09.960
side.

20:09.960 --> 20:10.960
Right?

20:10.960 --> 20:14.480
It's not only are we being asked to have faith that Apple won't have scope creep with this

20:14.480 --> 20:20.720
feature set, but we're being asked to have faith in this CSAM organization who is organizing

20:20.720 --> 20:22.340
all of this.

20:22.340 --> 20:28.080
And then there's also the man, how do they say it's like the neck Mac, that's NC MEC

20:28.080 --> 20:32.200
database, which is where a lot of this actually lives, these fingerprints actually live.

20:32.200 --> 20:36.860
So there's actually two other organizations outside of Apple that are involved with all

20:36.860 --> 20:38.040
of this.

20:38.040 --> 20:43.760
And then we have to trust that the governments that Apple operates in won't be constantly

20:43.760 --> 20:44.760
putting pressure on them.

20:44.760 --> 20:51.680
So you have CSAM, which stands for child sexual abuse material, which is, you know, awful,

20:51.680 --> 20:52.680
no doubt about it.

20:52.680 --> 20:58.960
And then you have Nick Mac, NC MEC, the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children.

20:58.960 --> 21:01.240
It's both of those organizations.

21:01.240 --> 21:05.240
They are both founded and funded by the US government.

21:05.240 --> 21:09.680
So it is possible that organizations that are founded and funded by the US government

21:09.680 --> 21:14.800
could then be influenced by the White House and you could get a president, maybe it's

21:14.800 --> 21:19.020
another president in a few years that gets in there, that puts pressure, political pressure

21:19.020 --> 21:24.400
on this group to add new types of imagery that society now considers to be offensive

21:24.400 --> 21:25.660
and dangerous.

21:25.660 --> 21:28.520
And that goalpost is constantly shifting.

21:28.520 --> 21:35.720
And so you could see just over time how something like this, even if Apple never, ever wavered

21:35.720 --> 21:41.040
on their commitments, you could see how maybe the other groups might over time because things

21:41.040 --> 21:42.040
change.

21:42.040 --> 21:45.080
So this is my whole bottom line on all this security stuff.

21:45.080 --> 21:49.080
Like you're saying, you could have a different guy in charge or gal in charge later.

21:49.080 --> 21:52.200
It's not enough for these companies to say that they won't.

21:52.200 --> 21:55.640
They have to be saying, and it has to be in fact true, that they can't.

21:55.640 --> 22:00.420
Not that I won't do it because you can trust me, it's I cannot do it even if I wanted to.

22:00.420 --> 22:06.720
Even if I woke up and had just like the burning desire out of the best of intentions, I literally

22:06.720 --> 22:07.720
can't do it.

22:07.720 --> 22:11.060
That's the only way you have any kind of digital privacy.

22:11.060 --> 22:14.720
And there are serious downsides to that.

22:14.720 --> 22:19.360
That's why there are legitimate cases where it would be a lot easier for law enforcement

22:19.360 --> 22:23.880
and other entities to just have nothing be encrypted.

22:23.880 --> 22:27.680
It will cost lives if everything's end to end encrypted.

22:27.680 --> 22:30.320
But this is going to be problematic too.

22:30.320 --> 22:36.200
And where I think this is going to go in five years is going to be weirdly some sort of

22:36.200 --> 22:41.440
pseudo corporate slash government marriage surveillance state.

22:41.440 --> 22:43.680
This is the tinfoil hat edition of Coder Radio.

22:43.680 --> 22:49.640
You know, there's other cloud providers that are already doing this exact scanning right

22:49.640 --> 22:50.640
now.

22:50.640 --> 22:53.520
I mentioned Facebook and there are others.

22:53.520 --> 22:57.520
That's why it kind of sucks that this has been not properly explained.

22:57.520 --> 23:02.400
Like I think out of all of this, the most reasonable thing that Apple is doing is that

23:02.400 --> 23:07.960
iMessage filtering that happens on device for children's accounts that just notifies

23:07.960 --> 23:08.960
parents.

23:08.960 --> 23:10.040
That's sensible.

23:10.040 --> 23:15.480
I think a lot of people could get on board with that and it's pretty minimal impact.

23:15.480 --> 23:18.800
It's the cloud based scanning that really sucks.

23:18.800 --> 23:24.560
The people are conflating this and saying that it's anyone who uses iMessage, they're

23:24.560 --> 23:27.440
saying it's on by default, that it's going to be checking everybody.

23:27.440 --> 23:33.780
Like the coverage of this has really been unusually inaccurate and unusually bad.

23:33.780 --> 23:37.480
And that sucks because this is such a nuanced issue here.

23:37.480 --> 23:42.120
And there's really two or three things Apple is announcing at once that's all getting conflated

23:42.120 --> 23:43.120
together.

23:43.120 --> 23:47.020
And generally they're a lot better at messaging this kind of stuff.

23:47.020 --> 23:48.220
They really kind of blew it.

23:48.220 --> 23:51.520
And you wonder if they're going to have to go up on stage and try to spin this in the

23:51.520 --> 23:55.080
most Apple way possible when they announce the next hardware or whatever.

23:55.080 --> 23:56.840
You mean like with the Sarah McLachlan song?

23:56.840 --> 23:57.840
Yeah.

23:57.840 --> 24:02.640
And slow like slow fades of children that have been saved from like try from trafficking,

24:02.640 --> 24:05.240
you know, just really hit those emotional buttons.

24:05.240 --> 24:10.000
And then then Tim Cook comes up on stage with hands folded together and like the in like

24:10.000 --> 24:15.960
that triangle shape that he does and shaking them up and down, you know, at Apple, we care.

24:15.960 --> 24:18.080
You can see it now.

24:18.080 --> 24:19.080
The thoughtful triangle.

24:19.080 --> 24:20.080
Yes.

24:20.080 --> 24:21.080
Yes.

24:21.080 --> 24:22.080
Yes.

24:22.080 --> 24:23.080
The thoughtful triangle.

24:23.080 --> 24:25.760
Oh, somebody title suggests that that is that is it.

24:25.760 --> 24:26.760
Oh, man.

24:26.760 --> 24:28.800
OK, well, I mean, all we can do is wait.

24:28.800 --> 24:29.800
It's going to happen.

24:29.800 --> 24:31.480
It's landing in iOS 15.

24:31.480 --> 24:33.640
The stakes here are incredibly high.

24:33.640 --> 24:35.760
Apple could blow this so bad.

24:35.760 --> 24:40.800
And going back to that, the misreporting, I think the really unfortunate side effect

24:40.800 --> 24:45.520
of that is Apple will lean on what people are misinformed.

24:45.520 --> 24:49.220
They don't understand the nuances and Apple will be right about that.

24:49.220 --> 24:53.920
And that will be their go to defense over and over and over again.

24:53.920 --> 24:56.640
And you look at things like the Washington Post.

24:56.640 --> 25:01.020
They just blew this story so, so bad.

25:01.020 --> 25:05.840
Their opening paragraph is just complete and total crap, complete crap.

25:05.840 --> 25:07.760
And it's it just gets worse from there.

25:07.760 --> 25:13.400
And that's that's that's a damn shame, because this is a fundamental shift in privacy and

25:13.400 --> 25:19.440
hyperbole isn't going to help us get to the pros and cons of this.

25:19.440 --> 25:22.480
And ultimately, I don't think it's going to move the needle for anybody.

25:22.480 --> 25:24.720
I don't think it's going to stop anybody from using iOS.

25:24.720 --> 25:29.760
I don't think it's going to stop anybody from using iMessage or iCloud photo library.

25:29.760 --> 25:34.320
I think the only thing this will ultimately do is take a little pressure off Apple to

25:34.320 --> 25:38.360
build in backdoors, which is why I go back to that one possible explanation, because

25:38.360 --> 25:43.520
if you look at the outcome of this is when Apple turns this sucker on, they're probably

25:43.520 --> 25:46.560
going to find a bunch of kiddie porn in people's iPhone library.

25:46.560 --> 25:49.960
And all of a sudden, they're going to have a whole group of people in their offices looking

25:49.960 --> 25:51.100
at naked kids.

25:51.100 --> 25:54.120
That's the reality of this change, which is in itself illegal.

25:54.120 --> 25:58.400
But now they're going to point to this in antitrust hearings in encryption, backdoor

25:58.400 --> 26:02.080
hearings, and they're going to say, look at Apple, we care, we're doing this.

26:02.080 --> 26:05.740
And that, I think, is ultimately going to be the biggest result of this is there some

26:05.740 --> 26:08.000
staff are going to look at more naked pictures of kids.

26:08.000 --> 26:11.200
Some people are going to get in trouble, a couple of people, because let's be honest,

26:11.200 --> 26:14.120
who's dumb enough to put that crap in my photo library to begin with.

26:14.120 --> 26:17.120
And they're going to have now an argument to use to push back against the government

26:17.120 --> 26:19.640
of various countries.

26:19.640 --> 26:20.640
That's the net result of this.

26:20.640 --> 26:25.600
Oh, oh, and of course, they lose part of their branding as the as a privacy first company

26:25.600 --> 26:27.800
who designs things in a way that you can't be snooped on.

26:27.800 --> 26:28.800
They've just losing that now.

26:28.800 --> 26:30.260
And they're going to lose it anyway.

26:30.260 --> 26:31.260
It was coming, wasn't it?

26:31.260 --> 26:33.120
You could feel it coming with their push towards services.

26:33.120 --> 26:37.680
I don't know, I in in some way, I feel like I'm tilting at windmills a little bit here,

26:37.680 --> 26:41.320
because I don't know that we're ever going back.

26:41.320 --> 26:42.980
But everything's a service now.

26:42.980 --> 26:46.880
Everything's a subscription, which means that you need data on your users.

26:46.880 --> 26:50.640
You know, even in the most innocent cases, it's built in now.

26:50.640 --> 26:51.640
It's built in.

26:51.640 --> 26:52.640
It's part of them.

26:52.640 --> 26:54.960
These aren't really devices with software.

26:54.960 --> 26:59.280
These are portals to an ecosystem of services.

26:59.280 --> 27:01.600
And honestly, basically a lifestyle, right?

27:01.600 --> 27:04.320
I think about I have home pods now.

27:04.320 --> 27:05.960
Thanks a lot, Chris.

27:05.960 --> 27:12.240
No, it would be so painful for me to extricate myself from the I life.

27:12.240 --> 27:13.840
Because it's all tied together.

27:13.840 --> 27:15.680
And how is it tied together?

27:15.680 --> 27:21.280
All the services to have all the data on my account and my purchases and my preferences.

27:21.280 --> 27:26.480
It realized like where I live when I moved to this house from a couple towns over.

27:26.480 --> 27:30.640
And I did not have to tell iOS that they just figured it out.

27:30.640 --> 27:34.800
When I was at the Salt Lake City meetup, it the conversation went like this, I'm always,

27:34.800 --> 27:37.800
you know, asking and trying to get a feel and the conversation goes just like this.

27:37.800 --> 27:41.480
It goes, I know I'm actually I'm on a Mac now.

27:41.480 --> 27:42.480
And they always hang their head in shame.

27:42.480 --> 27:46.360
Yeah, I got a Mac, you know, I mean, my servers are still all Linux, my servers, my servers

27:46.360 --> 27:47.360
are all still Linux.

27:47.360 --> 27:48.360
But

27:48.360 --> 27:49.360
my servers to SUSE.

27:49.360 --> 27:51.360
Well, that's actually Ubuntu.

27:51.360 --> 27:52.360
Yeah.

27:52.360 --> 27:53.360
Oh, man.

27:53.360 --> 27:55.400
Ah, yes.

27:55.400 --> 27:58.200
And and I think it's it in every conversation.

27:58.200 --> 28:04.080
It's the stuff you and I touched on weeks ago in the show is, you know, the late 30s,

28:04.080 --> 28:08.400
early 40s, to late 40s, for just about most of the people that were there, with a few

28:08.400 --> 28:14.480
exceptions, kids, for a lot of them, and a full time job.

28:14.480 --> 28:16.520
And they just felt like life got busy.

28:16.520 --> 28:18.120
And I just kind of fell into this.

28:18.120 --> 28:20.280
And it's just working for me.

28:20.280 --> 28:23.760
And they I guess, you know, they feel like they've lost a bit of their geek cred.

28:23.760 --> 28:27.720
And I, I feel like we should, we should try to push back against I don't feel like anybody

28:27.720 --> 28:32.160
should feel ashamed of what tool they choose to do their job, you know, and I, I feel bad

28:32.160 --> 28:34.200
that they felt a little shame admitting it to me.

28:34.200 --> 28:36.800
But you know, I'm trying to be cool about it, because I understand.

28:36.800 --> 28:42.040
If you've ever used SSH, compared to the general population of the world, you are a geek.

28:42.040 --> 28:43.960
Don't worry.

28:43.960 --> 28:47.040
Even if you've used it in something weird on Windows, like putty or whatever, right,

28:47.040 --> 28:48.040
you're fine.

28:48.040 --> 28:49.040
I love it.

28:49.040 --> 28:50.040
Apologies to Windows users.

28:50.040 --> 28:54.160
I think I may have said the wrong application name because I don't use Windows because you

28:54.160 --> 28:57.800
know, obviously, that's not real.

30:35.040 --> 30:43.320
So Zoom, your favorite video conferencing company in the world, has to pay out $85 million

30:43.320 --> 30:50.000
for lying about end-to-end encryption and sending user data to Facebook and Google.

30:50.000 --> 30:55.640
So this is like a claim that happened because essentially Zoom has like all this language

30:55.640 --> 31:02.000
around we don't share your data, and the calls are end-to-end encrypted, and Zoom takes privacy

31:02.000 --> 31:05.120
seriously and adequately protects users' personal information.

31:05.120 --> 31:08.740
These are quotes from like their privacy policy and their EULA and stuff like that.

31:08.740 --> 31:15.560
And then it turned out that because Zoom had implemented the Facebook SDK and Google's

31:15.560 --> 31:20.920
Firebase SDK, they were sending everything off to Facebook and Google.

31:20.920 --> 31:25.920
Quite a bit of data, it seems, even before the user had accepted the EULA and privacy

31:25.920 --> 31:26.920
statement.

31:26.920 --> 31:28.440
Oh, that's brutal.

31:28.440 --> 31:33.600
So there is a real dev story here about maybe you want to check out what your dependencies

31:33.600 --> 31:34.600
are actually doing.

31:34.600 --> 31:39.320
You know, when you install a CocoaPod or whatever, a PIP package or RubyGem, you want to maybe

31:39.320 --> 31:42.520
just check out what's going on there.

31:42.520 --> 31:46.160
I wonder, like, do you think they even knew everybody that was just like sitting there

31:46.160 --> 31:47.160
implementing that SDK?

31:47.160 --> 31:48.160
Do you think?

31:48.160 --> 31:49.360
I mean, they must have known, right?

31:49.360 --> 31:52.440
They must have known that it was sending off analytics to both Facebook and Google.

31:52.440 --> 31:56.720
Well, like did the developers who just like needed the Facebook SDK to hit whatever, you

31:56.720 --> 32:02.680
know, Jira card they were working on know anything about what the legal department was

32:02.680 --> 32:03.680
doing, right?

32:03.680 --> 32:08.940
They had a KPI, right, a key performance indicator of integrating like Facebook and like once

32:08.940 --> 32:12.960
you get Facebook integrated, we've reached one of our goals for our OKR.

32:12.960 --> 32:17.000
Oh, man, that's exactly why.

32:17.000 --> 32:19.720
And of course, you got to get Firebase in there, too, because you need all the data.

32:19.720 --> 32:21.320
You can't just have Facebook stuff.

32:21.320 --> 32:24.440
Oh, what is this, like a corporate conferencing tool?

32:24.440 --> 32:27.000
But of course, the lawyers are going to get their cut.

32:27.000 --> 32:28.000
You know, they're going to get their cut.

32:28.000 --> 32:32.480
The lawyers, they're going to get 25 to 15 bucks per person.

32:32.480 --> 32:37.680
They're basically it works out like the lawyers get millions of dollars, like up to 25 percent

32:37.680 --> 32:38.680
of the 85 million.

32:38.680 --> 32:39.680
That's what the lawyers will take.

32:39.680 --> 32:43.480
And then they also have two hundred thousand dollars of expenses that get reimbursed on

32:43.480 --> 32:44.480
top of that.

32:44.480 --> 32:49.040
So the lawyers are really working this case and they're going to make out great and users

32:49.040 --> 32:53.600
are going to get like maybe five, eight bucks if if you were a user during this time.

32:53.600 --> 32:59.040
I just like that, you know, the sword that they fell on was importing the Facebook SDK.

32:59.040 --> 33:01.320
I know that is hilarious.

33:01.320 --> 33:06.840
The judge also ordered Google and Facebook to delete any of the data they collected.

33:06.840 --> 33:09.320
But there's no enforcement mechanism there.

33:09.320 --> 33:14.040
And does it matter if they've already sold ads based on that data?

33:14.040 --> 33:15.040
Right.

33:15.040 --> 33:16.920
If they've already used it to identify things about you.

33:16.920 --> 33:17.920
Right.

33:17.920 --> 33:21.160
And if they've used it to feed their their ever growing algorithmic engines, does it?

33:21.160 --> 33:25.840
I mean, I'm sure they never want to delete data, but do they care that much at this point?

33:25.840 --> 33:26.840
Right.

33:26.840 --> 33:28.840
But at this point, the machine has probably learned.

33:28.840 --> 33:32.800
So it's like, OK, the beast has consumed your data.

33:32.800 --> 33:38.800
And I mean, if I was Facebook and I was and we see story after story about just how voraciously

33:38.800 --> 33:43.800
data hungry they are and about how how far they're willing to go to get data, you know,

33:43.800 --> 33:47.620
there's no way they're letting that that that kind of analytics come in from Zoom and they're

33:47.620 --> 33:49.380
not doing something with it.

33:49.380 --> 33:52.080
They're absolutely consuming it and taking action on that.

33:52.080 --> 33:54.560
And same with Google, they'd be negligent not to.

33:54.560 --> 33:57.760
So this whole thing feels so slap on the wrist.

33:57.760 --> 33:58.760
Eighty five million bucks.

33:58.760 --> 33:59.920
Sure, that sucks.

33:59.920 --> 34:03.060
But I bet Zoom would pay that again in the heartbeat to have the kind of user growth

34:03.060 --> 34:04.880
they did during the peak of the pandemic.

34:04.880 --> 34:05.880
It was worth it.

34:05.880 --> 34:06.880
It's a speeding ticket.

34:06.880 --> 34:08.940
It is a speeding ticket.

34:08.940 --> 34:11.040
It really, really is.

34:11.040 --> 34:13.760
And we'll just keep all plugging away at using Zoom.

34:13.760 --> 34:14.920
I have a hot tip for you, though.

34:14.920 --> 34:20.040
If you use Zoom on Linux, use the flat pack version and then they can't monitor all the

34:20.040 --> 34:25.200
processes on your PC and what active windows you're using, which is a creepy thing that

34:25.200 --> 34:30.000
Zoom can report to those that are running the meeting if they have a pro Zoom account

34:30.000 --> 34:31.440
or enterprise Zoom account or whatever.

34:31.440 --> 34:36.380
They can get analytics on how long the window was active versus how long the meeting was.

34:36.380 --> 34:41.280
And they can get analytics on all of the other processes running on your Mac or Windows machine.

34:41.280 --> 34:44.920
So creepy and gross.

34:44.920 --> 34:45.920
That's ridiculous.

34:45.920 --> 34:46.920
Yeah.

34:46.920 --> 34:49.440
And then there was just a story that one of the call centers that Apple works with, which

34:49.440 --> 34:53.840
is like this large call center that handles a ton of companies, but because one of them

34:53.840 --> 34:55.800
is Apple, it made a headline.

34:55.800 --> 34:59.120
They're based out of, I think it was Chicago, I can't remember.

34:59.120 --> 35:02.940
But they now have cameras on all the time policy while you're at work.

35:02.940 --> 35:06.760
Even if you're working from home, your webcam must be on so that way they can watch what

35:06.760 --> 35:11.900
you're doing and monitor for odd activity, I guess.

35:11.900 --> 35:13.520
So it just gets weirder and weirder.

35:13.520 --> 35:15.080
So is this our surveillance edition?

35:15.080 --> 35:17.840
I mean, we've really got a theme.

35:17.840 --> 35:20.400
I guess.

35:20.400 --> 35:21.480
It's like there's a...

35:21.480 --> 35:22.480
Corporate America is sliding.

35:22.480 --> 35:25.840
Well, if you want to work from home, then we're going to up the monitoring.

35:25.840 --> 35:27.920
And it's like they're freaking out.

35:27.920 --> 35:29.120
We have to have butts in chairs.

35:29.120 --> 35:34.560
And if we can't physically monitor butts in chairs, we'll virtually monitor butts in seats.

35:34.560 --> 35:37.000
So you better get your employee monitoring set up.

35:37.000 --> 35:38.000
No.

35:38.000 --> 35:40.660
You're falling behind.

35:40.660 --> 35:44.680
You need like a heads up display, maybe like a butt sensor so you know literally when butts

35:44.680 --> 35:45.680
are in seats.

35:45.680 --> 35:48.040
What if they have a standing desk?

35:48.040 --> 35:49.040
Could you imagine?

35:49.040 --> 35:51.880
Well, then you get a pressure pad.

35:51.880 --> 35:52.880
Obviously.

35:52.880 --> 35:57.760
Well, she's definitely working, but it appears she's doing jumping jacks, too.

35:57.760 --> 36:00.920
I don't understand.

36:00.920 --> 36:06.880
Maybe I could train the dog to stand on the pressure plate, you know.

36:06.880 --> 36:09.960
I just want to take a moment and mention for all of you out there that are ready to get

36:09.960 --> 36:14.320
certified and you're looking at the Linux Engineer Exam 201, our friends at a Cloud

36:14.320 --> 36:16.080
Guru have a course for you.

36:16.080 --> 36:21.000
This course has been designed to cover all of the objectives for the LPIC-2 201 exam.

36:21.000 --> 36:24.240
We will have a link in the show notes or you can go to cloudguru.com.

36:24.240 --> 36:28.880
It begins with capacity planning and includes utilities and concepts for measuring resource

36:28.880 --> 36:33.040
usage, predicting future resource needs, all of the kind of thinking you're going to need

36:33.040 --> 36:34.160
for the exam.

36:34.160 --> 36:39.620
Once you've completed that course, you'll be prepared to sit and pass LPIC-2 201 exam.

36:39.620 --> 36:44.020
So go try it out, see what you can learn and maybe even get certified.

36:44.020 --> 36:47.960
It's all at a cloudguru.com and we'll have a link in the show notes.

36:47.960 --> 36:52.080
Wow, this has been another depressing episode of Coder Radio.

36:52.080 --> 36:55.200
Maybe next week we'll go back to the internet of the 90s.

36:55.200 --> 36:56.200
That'd be fun.

36:56.200 --> 36:57.200
We should do some nostalgia soon.

36:57.200 --> 37:01.940
You know, we do have a new Coderly report posted for our Coder QA members.

37:01.940 --> 37:05.080
And if you're not a Coder QA member yet and you want to support the show, keep us going,

37:05.080 --> 37:09.440
keep us independent and you get access to the Coderly report every quarter.

37:09.440 --> 37:10.480
There's a new Coderly.

37:10.480 --> 37:11.480
So go grab that.

37:11.480 --> 37:17.000
It's a bit germane to part of our topics today and that's at coderqa.co.

37:17.000 --> 37:20.320
Mr. Dominic, is there anything you want to mention or plug or tell the people to go check

37:20.320 --> 37:21.840
out before we get out of here?

37:21.840 --> 37:22.840
Nope.

37:22.840 --> 37:24.200
Just follow me at Timon Nugent on Twitter.

37:24.200 --> 37:25.200
That's really easy.

37:25.200 --> 37:26.200
You could also follow me.

37:26.200 --> 37:28.040
I'm at Chris LAS, the podcast network.

37:28.040 --> 37:29.680
Well, I'm glad you asked.

37:29.680 --> 37:33.520
That's at Jupiter Signal and the show is at Coder Radio Show.

37:33.520 --> 37:35.140
And that's handy for announcements and stuff.

37:35.140 --> 37:36.140
You never know.

37:36.140 --> 37:39.040
I guess things could be, you know, shifting or whatever while I'm on the road.

37:39.040 --> 37:44.440
I think the next Coder Radio, I'm not positive, but I think the next one will either be in

37:44.440 --> 37:48.080
Denver or just outside of the Denver area.

37:48.080 --> 37:49.560
And then it is meet up time.

37:49.560 --> 37:50.560
Awesome.

37:50.560 --> 37:51.560
I know.

37:51.560 --> 37:52.560
Pretty stoked.

37:52.560 --> 37:55.920
I'm going to go to System 76, see if I can I spy how they build that launch keyboard.

37:55.920 --> 37:58.080
Maybe walk out of there with a couple of Thaleos under my arms.

37:58.080 --> 37:59.080
I'll never notice.

37:59.080 --> 38:02.680
I'll bring my big jacket.

38:02.680 --> 38:04.460
Links to what we talked about today.

38:04.460 --> 38:07.080
They're over at coder.show slash four to six.

38:07.080 --> 38:08.880
You also find our contact form over there.

38:08.880 --> 38:09.880
We need your feedback.

38:09.880 --> 38:10.880
It's a big part of the show.

38:10.880 --> 38:11.880
Go send us your feedback.

38:11.880 --> 38:13.900
And our RSS feed is there as well.

38:13.900 --> 38:16.180
You can subscribe and you can send the show to somebody.

38:16.180 --> 38:17.320
That's always real nice.

38:17.320 --> 38:24.880
And then join us for Coder Radio live on Mondays at 10 a.m. Pacific, noon, Eastern.

38:24.880 --> 38:26.280
Time math is hard right now.

38:26.280 --> 38:29.840
I'm in the mountains, but I'd love to have you join us live at jblife.tv.

38:29.840 --> 38:30.840
Thanks for being here.

38:30.840 --> 38:48.120
We'll be right back here next week.
