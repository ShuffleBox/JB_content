00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
This is KOTORadio, episode 492 for November 14th, 2022.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:20,500
Hey good buddy, welcome back to Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show. It's taken a pragmatic look

3
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:26,040
at the art in the business of software development, and you guessed it, the world of technology.

4
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:30,560
My name is Chris, and joining us, collating the results from his survey, is the spreadsheet

5
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,400
master, Mr. Dominic.

6
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:35,000
What's up? I'm no Nate Silver, but I'll give it a go.

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,080
I think you might have a better shot. They've really been blowing it recently.

8
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:41,120
A couple rough cycles.

9
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:44,680
Date's probably been better than the rest for a little while, but you know what I mean.

10
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:49,840
It's been rough. It's been real rough. And I've been so busy. I've been implementing

11
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:54,640
the new NSA recommendations. I'm sure you have too. I'm sure you've been making a big

12
00:00:54,640 --> 00:01:02,280
about face and implementing their new recommendations to use only memory-safe programming languages.

13
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:07,880
The NSA recommends that organizations use memory-safe languages when possible and bolster

14
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:13,720
protection through code-hardening defenses such as compiler options, tool options, and

15
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:17,320
operating system configurations.

16
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:23,280
With tips like this, we're clearly going to become the cyber leaders of the world, with

17
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:33,320
hot tips like this. How about this one? Configure your operating system. You needed the experts

18
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:40,600
at the NSA to tell us that. And use your compiler options. Another hot tip from the National

19
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:45,000
Spy Agency. It's really good. So I hope you've implemented that.

20
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:51,160
I know you're trolling a bit, but I actually think there are many, many people who read

21
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:53,440
this article and probably did get some good tips.

22
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:59,520
Yeah. These are the same people that keep getting surprised and shocked that ransomware

23
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:03,520
keeps logging up their data and they don't have backups to recover. Yeah. No, I agree.

24
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:06,200
They're out there. They are absolutely out there.

25
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:12,400
The register piece goes out of its way to talk about Rust. But I believe when I read

26
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:17,080
the agency's actual recommendation on the NSA.gov website, because I hang out there

27
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:24,200
all the time. I don't think they mentioned Rust. They mention other programming languages.

28
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:28,160
It's funny because of all the languages they list, Rust is actually probably the most hardcore

29
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:33,600
of the hardcore in terms of you must account for all your memory until you start throwing

30
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:38,200
around the unsafe keyword and then you can do whatever you want because, hey, hey, hey,

31
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,200
you know.

32
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:47,200
Here we go. On page three of their memory safe PDF that they put out, software memory

33
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:53,840
safety PDF that they put out. On page three, paragraph two, they finally do mention Rust

34
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:59,160
and they give a shout out to Swift as well. So, okay, I stand corrected.

35
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:03,920
Those noted Apple fanboys at the NSA.

36
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:09,880
What a weird thing. I mean, it's good. I think the reason why I keyed a little bit is because

37
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:17,560
I don't know, it feels about 20 years late. When the options are like, use Java or Go

38
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:23,200
or Rust, it's like, okay, we could have used this a long time ago. It just is, to me, I

39
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,280
think I have this complex of they can never do enough.

40
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,960
Okay, but what makes it late though?

41
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:32,600
Well, I mean, if this is stuff people should have known ages ago.

42
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:41,040
Okay, so the counter argument to this, right, and this ties into my still evolving 2FA debacle

43
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:47,640
that security equals effort plus money. So a reason that lots of things are written in,

44
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:54,200
let's say Python, is it is a fast language to develop it, right? This is like the whole

45
00:03:54,200 --> 00:04:00,560
raison d'etre for Rails. You know, the biggest risk if you're a small organization is not

46
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:04,280
that Saudi Arabia is going to hack your stuff. It's that you're just going to run out of

47
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:10,080
money or go bankrupt or a bigger competitor who may or may not have any employees left

48
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:15,640
by the time we're done with the show is going to make a free version of what you're doing.

49
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:22,240
So I don't know. I mean, compiled languages that enforce strict memory safety? Yeah, they're

50
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:27,840
definitely like, there is a whole category. This is again, this is the Rust promise. There's

51
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:34,880
a whole category of error, stability errors, but also security errors that are basically

52
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:40,520
eliminated if you do things the right way in Rust. And that if is very big, because

53
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:45,280
if it's two in the morning, and you know that you can slam that unsafe keyboard in there

54
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:48,920
and get this goddamn thing shipped and not have to have the awkward zoom call the next

55
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:55,960
day, I'm pretty sure that nine out of 10 of us 99 out of eight times would just slam that

56
00:04:55,960 --> 00:05:01,280
unsafe keyword in there. It's if you are the NSA and have infinite money, this is great

57
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:05,160
advice. And I think in general, looking at your compiler options is something that I

58
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:10,920
live in, I often don't do. But certainly that I see to me, that's actually the more interesting

59
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:14,880
piece of advice out of this. Because like, Oh, right, there are tweaks you can do in like

60
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:20,520
if you're doing iOS and Xcode to, you know, kind of harden up your application, right

61
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:26,080
your software. Same for you know, you know, LLVM, CPP, all that stuff.

62
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:29,240
Well, now we can say Rust has been recommended by the NSA.

63
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:32,640
It's system 76 and the NSA. That's where all the Rust people are.

64
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:36,200
All right. Well, you mentioned your two factor woes.

65
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,200
God damn it.

66
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:41,080
We got quite a bit of feedback on that. So I picked a few Christian wanted to recommend

67
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:45,680
a GPL three two factor tool says greetings. I'm listening to 491. And you're talking about

68
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:50,280
your two factor woes. One of my biggest fears was losing access to Google Authenticator,

69
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:55,440
especially when I had a device requiring maintenance and I didn't think about it in advance.

70
00:05:55,440 --> 00:06:02,360
Then I learned about Aegis or A E G I S. It's a GPL three authenticator for Android that

71
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:07,080
supports multiple devices, multiple backups and exporting your vault. So if you lose your

72
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:11,960
device and want to enable another one, you can simply import your vault. No cloud required.

73
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:19,300
It saved me already once or twice. So A E G I S a GPL Android authenticator.

74
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:25,080
And then another tip that several people emailed in is they print out the QR codes and store

75
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:30,560
them in a vault or a secured spot. And then they just manually re import them via the

76
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:37,520
QR code when they when they need to. How is it going over there? Have you been bit by

77
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:40,560
anything in the time between now and last episode?

78
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:45,240
So I have been able to restore everything but my Instagram account.

79
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:53,160
Okay, which is insane because I log into Instagram via Facebook, but they they really just it's

80
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:59,180
funny how little integration actually happened there. Right, right. I would say that I'm

81
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:06,300
still of the opinion that all the workarounds that people have sent. It's just too much

82
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:12,540
for Uncle Tim or Uncle not Tim Cook, but you know, Uncle Ted to actually do. If the reality

83
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:17,260
for the normies is you break your phone.

84
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:22,440
And you're therefore you lose all your two FA if you haven't taken some highly like responsible

85
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:28,600
I'm a man in a brown suit with a fedora hat on steps to prevent that, then this is way

86
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:35,400
too far on the security versus convenience scale. Now, if you do in fact work as a Rust

87
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:40,120
developer for the NSA, well, then maybe that's the outcome you want, right? Like, but if

88
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:44,880
you're, you know, a dude who just wants to get his Instagram account back, and has a

89
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:50,920
surprisingly small amount of photos of himself on that account, making the override thing

90
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:56,640
very challenging, and they have no actual support that you can reach out to.

91
00:07:56,640 --> 00:08:05,240
It's a, it's not worth it. And I don't think that two FA as implemented today is the best

92
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:10,640
solution. Now, I don't know what the right solution is, I would personally envision a

93
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:16,000
solution maybe integrated into the operating systems that uses biometrics, i.e. face IDs,

94
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,740
and you know, stuff like that. But I see the problem is I can write the objection to each

95
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:24,040
of these two, right? What's the problem with face ID? Well, if you don't know how to put

96
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:30,320
your phone on panic mode, anytime somebody possibly wearing blue can grab your phone,

97
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:35,120
put it towards your face, and now they've unlocked your phone, right forcibly.

98
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:39,320
This is one of those things where it would be very easy for me to just be like, haha,

99
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:46,680
I'm a jackass, and I shouldn't have messed this up, which is true-ish. But if we're supposed

100
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:52,720
to think about normal users, I think the bar is just way too high, right? There needs to

101
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:57,000
be some override. And yes, that's going to create security holes. Although, you know

102
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,640
what the biggest security hole is, and I kind of say kudos to Instagram for having absolutely

103
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:04,640
no support, and I know they have no support because they just keep firing people. It's

104
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:09,760
always like social engineering, right? You can social engineer your way to lots of things.

105
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:17,680
Who was that, Chris, that YouTuber, the Infosec YouTube lady, who she pretended to be the

106
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:21,000
wife of somebody who was in Iraq, and she was just trying to get some information on

107
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,920
some account, and then she had a recording, and she played the sound of a baby crying,

108
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:27,960
and she acted all flustered, and the guy on the phone finds out, okay, ma'am, I'm sorry,

109
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:30,320
I'll get you off the phone, and just read out the information.

110
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:34,600
I don't know about that, but that's brilliant. That kind of social engineering works.

111
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:38,640
This whole situation sucks. We haven't figured this out. You know, Microsoft and them.

112
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:43,940
To put a fine point on it, you're saying it's too hard for regular people to use two-factor

113
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:48,880
authentication. It works for a period of time, they get all in, they get all set up on it,

114
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,640
and then at some point they're going to get bit, and they're going to lose access to their

115
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:52,640
digital stuff.

116
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:59,680
Right. It expects too much of you up front. It's too unforgiving, right? You know, I tried

117
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:04,800
to explain it to a relative of mine, who I am encouraging to use some form of two-factor

118
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:11,840
authentication, and what I ended up telling him was, think about this. If you get married,

119
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:18,200
and up front you have to hash out every single argument you're ever going to have at the

120
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:25,520
engagement dinner, and if you ever encounter a disagreement that was not resolved, you

121
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:30,360
automatically get divorced. That's what losing your two-factor authentication is, right?

122
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:38,060
You have no way to handle an unforeseen circumstance. Trust me, if you go on Reddit and ask the

123
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:41,600
InfoSec people, how do I get around this, they're like, you should have been more responsible,

124
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,600
you freaking jackass.

125
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:45,360
Yeah, that is true. A lot of victim blaming.

126
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:50,560
Right, which is amazing because these same very people like to, never mind. Yeah.

127
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:55,400
I completely agree with you, and I think the same problem actually is also true about digital

128
00:10:55,400 --> 00:11:01,500
photography, although not to the degree of severity, but it's a good example of you can

129
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:07,280
start to make decisions early on about pictures you're taking that you don't take too seriously,

130
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:11,360
and then a few years down the road, they're some of the most valuable possessions you

131
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:14,400
own and you've never really given a lot of thought to how you're storing those photos.

132
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:21,800
I just recently had to go redo all of that. Also, cryptocurrency self-custody is also

133
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:27,280
very prone to this problem. If you get it wrong, you lose your investment, quote unquote.

134
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:32,720
Hopefully you're not investing anything stupid, and on both ends, there needs to be a better

135
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:35,240
technological solution for end users.

136
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:40,800
I'll give you an example of something that starts to get there. Now, disclaimer, Bitwarden

137
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:46,840
is a sponsor on Linux Unplugged, but Bitwarden, it doesn't solve the problem completely because

138
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:51,400
you have to, you still have to present it to people and tell them to start using it,

139
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:58,560
but when you do their premium, they integrate the password management, the username generation,

140
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:05,800
the password generation in autofill, and the two-factor code generation for those services

141
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:06,800
all in one app.

142
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:11,600
So you can have your secure passwords, you can have your two-factor codes, and it syncs

143
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:17,360
across your devices, it's locally encrypted. It is what makes it possible for everyday

144
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:24,600
users to have some kind of access to this, but you have to give them the value proposition,

145
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:28,240
and you have to tell them about it and tell them to go do it.

146
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:33,360
Apple and Google and Microsoft are uniquely privileged because they can build this into

147
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:39,160
the platform, and they have, you know, Apple has a two-factor system built in, Microsoft

148
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:42,320
does as well, Google, we're all familiar with Google where we have to go launch another

149
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:45,880
Google app on another device and approve a login.

150
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:52,040
Because they have access to the platform and they can trigger actions on the local OS,

151
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:57,360
they can provide a level of two-factor authentication integration that third-party services and

152
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:01,920
apps just don't get access to. They just don't get access to those APIs, so they cannot create

153
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:07,360
a user experience sufficient enough. They're limited in what they can do, and the platform

154
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:13,480
providers meanwhile are doing like OS native dialogues and push services to get that two-factor

155
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:17,760
in front of you, and it just makes me think ultimately these platform owners are going

156
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:23,200
to be the ones that we use as all our centralized IDs because of this very problem, because

157
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:26,120
the normals will not be able to figure out how to do it on their own.

158
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:33,240
And then, and my last point on this, it perpetuates this problem that is getting worse and worse,

159
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:38,420
and we're on the right side of it, we benefit, anybody listening to this podcast benefits,

160
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:43,960
but there is truly a divide now between people who understand a little bit of technology

161
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:48,800
and people who have no idea. And the people who have no idea are getting preyed on by

162
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:53,720
all kinds of spyware and monitoring and digital monetization. Their data is getting looked

163
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:57,920
at, they're getting tracked constantly by their carrier, by their government, by corporation

164
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:03,200
X, Y, and Z data brokers. They don't know how to store their own currency if they needed

165
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:09,000
to. They don't know how to do two-factor authentication. They don't know about tools that enable more

166
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:17,160
privacy and more secure passwords and secure communications. There is this huge, what we

167
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:21,240
used to call back in the Bill Clinton days, your buddy, that there's this huge digital

168
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:29,140
divide now. Actual protection of your identity and your pictures, your memories, your services,

169
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:35,800
your finances, all of that is diminished if you do not understand this technology. And

170
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:39,920
the people who do understand it are in a better position to have more protection, to have

171
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:45,080
more advanced investments, to have superior means of communication that can't be monitored

172
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:50,960
and censored. The difference is really mattering now. And I feel like this two-factor stuff

173
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:56,960
and all these other digital trends are part of this broader thing that's developing. And

174
00:14:56,960 --> 00:15:00,960
it's like, you're right, we could figure it out. You could learn from this and probably

175
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:04,520
never make this mistake again and probably go forward with the system that works for

176
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:11,900
you. But my aunts and uncles and my mom and dad who, you know, are familiar with computers,

177
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:15,380
I bet they don't use much two-factor authentication at all. And I don't know if I could even recommend

178
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:21,240
it to them because if they lost their phone, my mom's lost a phone before, they could be

179
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:25,560
completely SOL and then guess who they're calling and asking what to do and I won't

180
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:27,800
have an answer for them. It's gone.

181
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:34,560
Lino.com slash coder. Go there to get $100 in 60-day credit on a new account and it's

182
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:38,440
a great way to support the show while you're checking out the best way to run applications

183
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:43,800
for developers in the cloud. It's just the whole package. I mean, you got to be honest,

184
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:48,000
it starts with the pricing, 30% to 50% cheaper than the options out there that are not as

185
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,040
good. But you also have the support flexibility. However you like to take that support in,

186
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:58,240
self-research, contacting via phone, email, ticket, they're there 365, seven days a week,

187
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:02,840
real people that can help you. And then the performance. Like that really I think rounds

188
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:06,280
it all out. They got 11 data centers today, they're opening up another dozen throughout

189
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:11,440
next year. They have an application platform where you can just browse a bunch of really

190
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:17,400
popular useful tools from GitLab to Nextcloud to Minecraft servers. I mean, the list goes

191
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:22,620
on. They have database as a service as well. If running a database server isn't your strong

192
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:28,160
suite and you just want to focus on your application, they offer database as a service, multiple

193
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:33,760
different databases, MongoDB, they have Postgres and MySQL all available as a service. They

194
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:38,040
have really powerful rigs if you need something with a lot of compute or you need some GPU

195
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:42,160
for the weekend, they've got systems that can accommodate that. And they've got nanodes,

196
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:46,000
little itty-bitty systems that could run a single blog or an instance or a photo gallery,

197
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,280
something simple or maybe a demo site for a client. Maybe you want to use one of their

198
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:53,220
one-click deployments to do a file manager in the cloud so you can exchange files with

199
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:58,660
friends, family or a client. I mean, there's so many possibilities and so many opportunities

200
00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:04,440
to learn and you can do it on a great platform that has a great company behind it and great

201
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:08,600
performance while supporting the show and getting a hundred dollars. That is a real

202
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:13,980
great deal, isn't it? It's kind of like I think the best deal in podcasting. So head

203
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:20,000
over to linode.com slash coder, grab that $100 and try it out. Linode makes the cloud

204
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:27,600
simple, affordable and accessible. Linode.com slash coder.

205
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:33,380
Just a little after we recorded last week,.NET 7 was released. Microsoft says thanks

206
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:41,280
to the open source.NET community, there have been 28,000 contributions and 8,900 different

207
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:47,920
contributors throughout the.NET 7 release cycle. And of course with this is the new

208
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:53,520
general availability of.NET Maui for.NET 7, which they're quite hyped about in the

209
00:17:53,520 --> 00:18:02,760
performance category. And then going along with all of this was this quite nerdy, very

210
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:09,580
geeky.NET conference keynote and the link to them all. Microsoft just clearly decided

211
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:15,960
to let the geeks run this in a way, and I don't mean that in a bad way, in a really

212
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:23,320
good way. I think Microsoft is striking the balance between casual professional and letting

213
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:29,760
their genuine personalities of their developers show without going to like too low key where

214
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:34,680
it just feels like a crappy zoom call and without going all the way to a WWDC style

215
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:38,040
over the top production with crazy hair and transitions.

216
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:40,720
I don't think Frederiki can help the hair.

217
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:44,040
I'm sure they spend a few minutes in hair and makeup making it just right for every

218
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:45,040
scene.

219
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:47,400
He might consider buttoning his shirt every once in a while.

220
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:52,320
Yeah, they get them in just the right shirt too, there's that. So I watched a few of these,

221
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:56,960
like the state of the.NET Maui one, and I mean it's clearly scripted and planned, but

222
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:03,280
I think it feels the most audience appropriate out of all of the big corporate demonstrations.

223
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:08,000
It's not Saatchi up there, it's just the people who work on these teams presenting the video

224
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,840
videos. They're being a little geeky. They're clearly having fun. I liked it. I liked all

225
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:18,560
of it together as a presentation. The.NET 7 release, the keynote of the state of.NET,

226
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:22,200
then the state of Maui. It was really smooth.

227
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:28,480
Yeah, I mean it's a pretty good conference. I know we don't talk a ton about.NET on the

228
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:34,560
show. I will say they are still pushing Maui and I am doing something in Maui right now

229
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:39,400
for a customer. It is definitely more stable than it was before, so yay.

230
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:40,400
Yeah.

231
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:45,400
C-Sharp 11, which is part of this. If you like C-Sharp, which I actually think is pretty

232
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:52,880
good language, it's a lot of quality of life improvements. I don't know. See, I do wonder,

233
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:57,840
the ecosystem, how many people are really adopting the new stuff this quickly, right?

234
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:02,720
I get the impression it's much like the Java world where people stick to a long-term support

235
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,280
version for a while.

236
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:06,720
Yes, I do too.

237
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:14,920
Still, it's good, right? C-Sharp is adopting features at a rate that is mind-bending how

238
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:21,420
large that language is now, but you can do what you need to do. One thing I'm looking

239
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:30,760
at pretty intensely is Blazor, which is their kind of web view, inject C-Sharp, cross-platform,

240
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:38,700
from the WebAssembly solution. It's definitely not 100% ready for primetime in terms of Blazor

241
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:46,000
cross-platform, which is what I'm looking at, but I guess I would suggest that one,

242
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:51,140
the presentations are really good, like Chris says. Two, I kind of thought last year that

243
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:57,560
Maui was headed for the scrap heap, and I think they're actually going to pull it off.

244
00:20:57,560 --> 00:21:01,900
They're doing the work of getting things more stable, not having weird things happen in

245
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:07,260
Android that don't happen on iOS, or vice versa. It's always going to be what it is

246
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:14,640
a cross-platform solution, and I still personally put a little more stock into web-based UIs,

247
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:22,840
but if I was a.NET hardcore person, I would probably be blogging about Maui, doing podcasts

248
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:26,400
about Maui, because it's pretty sexy.

249
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:33,400
I'd love to be a fly on the wall of the strategic planning when they're discussing what and

250
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:38,520
how and when they're going to invest in Maui. I wish they were a little more transparent

251
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:40,000
about that kind of stuff.

252
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:45,000
I think it's hard, right? We don't have to go through the history of pain that is Windows

253
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:51,360
Phone and Metro UI and all that stuff again, but Maui is in many ways the dream that they've

254
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:56,400
had for a long time. That keeps turning into a nightmare. There's a Bruce Springsteen song

255
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,520
about this called The River.

256
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:05,880
I think this time, it only took them a decade. They might pull it off. Now, I do a little

257
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:11,800
wonder if Maui is going to be one of those things that doesn't get huge adoption immediately,

258
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:18,640
because I think the target, I could be wrong, but I think the target for Maui is going to

259
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:26,680
be your dark matter developers who are in.NET shops, which is like your major corporations.

260
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:32,800
It is very focused on bringing your Windows development skills to these other platforms.

261
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:38,840
I don't see your small pseudo-Indie, whatever, mobile development company is really going

262
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:44,760
to Maui, unless they're already on Xamarin.Forms or something like that.

263
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:50,800
That's weird. I guess I'm feeling that it could be kind of like.NET as a whole, something

264
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:56,600
that the podcast world, the hipsters don't really talk about, but turns out to have tremendous

265
00:22:56,600 --> 00:23:00,340
market share and line of business apps that nobody ever sees the light of day for because

266
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:02,660
line of business. So we'll see.

267
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:10,600
We need a name for that blind spot. What would you call that? That ability to just completely

268
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:14,560
miss an entire category? We call it dark matter, but there's a term for the blind spot that

269
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:18,640
causes the chattering class not to see it. It's interesting. I think you're right. I

270
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:21,640
think there's a huge use case out there that many people are missing.

271
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:26,240
Well, it's because you never see it, right? It doesn't go on the App Store. I'm sure if

272
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:31,760
we went to insert your Fortune 500, there are tablets running Xamarin.Forms and soon

273
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:33,560
to be Maui, right?

274
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:37,220
What do you think the most common use, just Maui specifically, would be if this thing

275
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:42,960
is successful, it gets traction? As an end user, what's my experience going to be with

276
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:48,440
it? Is it going to be an app that's cross-platform? Is it going to be a point of sales device?

277
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:52,820
Is it going to be an enterprise application that's on local devices, maybe some cheap

278
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:54,880
Android devices, some business owns?

279
00:23:54,880 --> 00:24:00,500
All of the above. So I think it's going to be... And in a weird way, this is a self-inflicted

280
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:07,740
wound from Apple in their effort to make the enterprise certificates harder to abuse. They've

281
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:14,040
also made it more of a pain in the ass to do your line of business apps, native iOS.

282
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:19,580
So I'll give you an example, right? I live in an HOA community. The house is owned by

283
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:23,880
a big company we've talked about before. They sent a guy because apparently there's a mysterious

284
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:28,640
HOA violation that I don't know about. Guy comes with some cheap Android tablet. He's

285
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:32,720
got like an app. He's looking, he's like, there's nothing wrong. I said, I know. Good

286
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:37,040
talk, bro. But in there, he's going through and I can see it. I'm like, okay, yep. So

287
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:42,500
that's a view controller and it just pushed it. And I know that it's cross-platform because

288
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:46,840
while it's an Android device, very clearly the transitions, the animations are all the

289
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:54,200
old iOS push navigation transition. So that app could very well be like a Maui Xamarin

290
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:59,480
forms type thing. Or it could be like an Angular Ionic thing, like what I usually do. Think

291
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:04,940
about this. This company is huge. They have to have thousands of these guys just running

292
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:07,500
around checking on all the properties they own.

293
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:10,360
And it's a great example of an app they don't need in the App Store. They don't need that

294
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:11,440
in the Play Store.

295
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:16,380
I took my car to a Jiffy Loop. Guy right there, I'm sitting in the car as I work on it, rings

296
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:20,080
me up, not on a point of sale, on a tablet with a little thing hooked to it. And he's

297
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:23,240
doing the whole thing. He takes a picture of the mileage, takes a picture of the van

298
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:26,920
that had to replace a part, takes a picture of the old part, the new part. Right there,

299
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:28,600
bam, one tablet.

300
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:30,760
You see in restaurants all the time too?

301
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:31,760
Absolutely, yeah.

302
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:38,640
Yeah, and all of those are just basically internal corporate applications in most cases.

303
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:39,640
Sometimes they're a web app or-

304
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:43,400
That are actually making money, one presumes, right? They're actually productive, so.

305
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:48,280
You hope. You hope. You hope. But it's good to see.NET 7 land and Microsoft seems to

306
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:53,920
be going strong. I mean, nearly 9,000 different contributors to.NET 7. That's a legit open

307
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:57,520
source project. I mean, it's clearly governed by Microsoft, but it's a-

308
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:01,000
Well, Microsoft is clearly the core of the Linux community.

309
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Right.

310
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Oh, oh, oh.

311
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
I don't believe you.

312
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
All right. And also-

313
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Inappropriate?

314
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:15,400
So, we thought this was coming, and unfortunately it did land just a little bit after we published

315
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:20,720
last week. Meta announced they're laying off more than 11,000 employees.

316
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:21,720
Damn.

317
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:25,320
About 13% of their staff.

318
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:26,920
Woo, Nelly.

319
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:37,640
And Zuckerberg says he's not ruling out further layoffs. That's a hard pivot. That's a- man.

320
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:44,500
And then, this morning, as the stream went live for Coda Radio, Amazon announced they

321
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:48,560
would lay off approximately 10,000 employees this week.

322
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:51,960
So that's your backyard. You think it's going to affect the local economy?

323
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:57,320
I don't know, because the Meta one actually had some significant Seattle layoffs as well.

324
00:26:57,320 --> 00:27:03,840
So, you know, combined, that's 20,000, 21,000, 22,000 people that are going to be looking

325
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:06,960
for tech work. That's going to change things.

326
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:12,440
Well, and Apple, not to be outdone, but being much more subtle, as Uncle Tim is, are going

327
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:16,000
to, quote, be very deliberate in their hiring.

328
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:21,920
Yeah. And again, he says specifically because of economic uncertainty. You know, Amazon

329
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:27,400
lost a trillion dollars in value since their new chief executive took over.

330
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:30,680
I don't think that's his fault. It's just the timing.

331
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:36,240
No, but the pressure is there to signal to investors. This is what I said weeks ago,

332
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:40,840
is these tech companies, these leadership tech companies, these lead tech companies,

333
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:45,420
are going to make some of the most dramatic changes the quickest to signal that they recognize

334
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:49,840
that they need to be all about value. And they're going to set the trend for all a tech.

335
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:54,200
That's how it always works with these big five. And that's what's happening right now.

336
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:59,080
It's happening in this last couple of weeks. We're seeing it play out. It's brutal. You

337
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:02,680
know, there's going to be listeners that are going to be hit by this. And so, I mean, that's

338
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:05,480
why we've been talking about it, you know, is to prepare people.

339
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:13,520
Yeah, it's honestly, it's happening much faster than I think I, for one, would have anticipated.

340
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:18,080
The meta stuff is kind of like Mark Zuckerberg is on some bender called the Metaverse, right?

341
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:19,440
Horizons, whatever they call it.

342
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:23,200
Yeah, what's called the Facebook brand has been burned to the ground. And he's got to

343
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,200
build the next thing.

344
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:29,000
No, I mean, I mean, the fact that he's burnt more money on trying to make the Metaverse

345
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:34,600
happen. It's kind of insane. I forgot. I don't remember the figure, but it's billions, right?

346
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:36,520
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Like 20 something.

347
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:42,920
Yeah, the Amazon thing seems supernatural and like, like very natural in that I think

348
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:47,400
this Christmas year, we're going to be reading stuff in the journal and Bloomberg about how

349
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:51,320
holiday spending is dramatically down from, you know, the last couple years.

350
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:58,120
Yeah, yeah, yeah, right. It's a consumption overall is going to be lessened. Apple, I

351
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:02,800
think we talked about it a couple weeks ago, has cut productions of their brand new flagship

352
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:06,320
of iPhones, because nobody's buying them.

353
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:07,680
Yeah.

354
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:10,240
Other than people who break their phone, like me.

355
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:13,200
Yeah, we're idiots like me on the subscription plan.

356
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:17,960
Right. Well, you're their best friend right now. You're, you're, you're their bestie.

357
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:24,800
I don't know. I think I'm kind of hoping that this is like a, the dinosaurs take a hit thing.

358
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:29,680
And we allow the mammals to rise, i.e. people who actually charge for software. Just something

359
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:35,120
I'm dreaming about. But it's very possible that this is part of just a cyclical decline

360
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:37,960
and we're all going to suffer together.

361
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:41,200
I think the ruthless are going to survive. I know that people aren't going to like hearing

362
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:46,040
this, but this has got to be part of the reason why Elon's going through Twitter like a wrecking

363
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:47,040
ball.

364
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:50,840
I still stand with my conspiracy theory. He was super drunk when he said he'd buy it.

365
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:55,760
He was super drunk when he sent the letter to them buying it. And now he just regrets

366
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:56,760
it.

367
00:29:56,760 --> 00:30:01,440
Right. And yeah, well, he just spent $44 billion on something that's not worth $44 billion.

368
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:05,140
And he wants to turn that thing around. And I would imagine if you buy a company like

369
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:10,160
that, your first 90 days are going to be the most important and you're going to have investors

370
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:14,560
breathing down your neck. He knows it also is putting Tesla at great risk. So he's got

371
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:18,780
to move quick and he's moving like a maniac as a result. He's only listening to people

372
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:23,080
in his peer group. He's not listening to staff. He's only going to listen to other famous

373
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:27,040
people at this point. And he's just going crazy. Like you just notice it. Like people

374
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:31,400
say this is a horrible idea and Elon just steamrolls them. And then a celebrity tweets

375
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:35,440
back at him and says, hey, man, maybe you should rethink this. And he says, OK, all

376
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:39,600
right, cool. It's not $20. We'll do $8. What do you think of that? You like that that better?

377
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:43,440
And then that's what they do. They do $8. It's it's wild. You're just watching like

378
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:48,760
you're watching the man's process go down in public. And it's got a lot of people uncomfortable.

379
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:54,560
The other thing I realized, too, is a good percentage. Maybe the majority of people are

380
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:59,000
just really freaked out by chaos in general. So when anybody injects chaos, they immediately

381
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:05,800
respond badly to it. But to me, it seems like Twitter was horribly broken. It's a dumpster

382
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:10,560
fire that causes harm. I've been told that many times. And so if Elon were to actually

383
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:15,000
destroy it, then that would reduce overall net harm in the world.

384
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:20,040
Chris is like, let it burn, baby. Yeah, let it burn. And if he and perhaps he makes something

385
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:25,440
out of it. So, OK, so my problem in this is apparently I have no morals. I just look at

386
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:33,760
the business problem of Twitter was never worth $44 billion in reality. Right. He walked

387
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:41,880
in arguably 20 to 30 billion in the hole. Right. A paper loss. Yep. How are you going

388
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:49,400
to make that kind of money when your product is Twitter? I sort of feel like this is like

389
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:55,840
a Greek tragedy waiting to happen. And I will admit that I am super addicted to Twitter.

390
00:31:55,840 --> 00:32:02,080
I keep trying to to wean myself a little bit. But I'm paying the eight bucks a month because

391
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:06,660
I know I got some crap for that. Oh, are you? I haven't done that. I am. Well, for the simple

392
00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:11,720
reason again, it's just a business choice. Do you know how much I've paid for ads on

393
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:17,960
Facebook, Twitter, other places in the past? Sure. Yeah. So even if it does like gets me

394
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:23,420
one or two meetings to like try to do an Alice sale or something. Eight dollars a month.

395
00:32:23,420 --> 00:32:28,920
This might be the most affordable marketing campaign. In fact, no, this is the most affordable

396
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:33,200
marketing campaign I've ever tried to run. And if it doesn't work, I just stop paying

397
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:39,580
it. Right. It's it's really like to me, it's kind of silly not to try, given that you really

398
00:32:39,580 --> 00:32:44,040
can't do anything with digital advertising below a couple thousand dollars that if you

399
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:48,960
want it to be effective. So the other thing that has worked for me is podcast ads. And

400
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:54,480
I often will buy them or YouTube or ads because the problem there is you need to usually make

401
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:59,200
a video which can be quite expensive for a good one. So eight bucks a month, not a lot

402
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:02,840
of money. Good for me if it works. Actually good for me even if it doesn't because I just

403
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:08,920
lose eight bucks a month right for a little while. Not going to get you $30 billion though.

404
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:17,440
That's just not enough money. And I, I, I will say, like, I do not share the doom and

405
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:23,480
gloom about, you know, like Elon's evil or the political crap. But Twitter has become

406
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:30,640
like weird recently. And I when I say weird, I mean, like a little more unstable for me.

407
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:36,640
And I mean, I mean, technically unstable, right? Like slower, whatever. And I don't

408
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:43,800
know how he plans to, you're not going to make up $20 billion by getting the customers

409
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:49,040
to pay at this point. The biggest the people who spend drunk money on advertising are the

410
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:54,800
auto manufacturers who you are their direct competitor. So I doubt they're eager to write

411
00:33:54,800 --> 00:34:05,200
you a check. And you kind of destabilized your core business, which is Tesla. Because

412
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:11,440
you got mad at who I think is probably one of the best CEOs of our generation agarwal

413
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:17,160
because he literally did nothing. It is going to make $312 million, which let me tell you,

414
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:21,400
he is going to get that money. Galloway has a good thing about this about firing people

415
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:25,880
for cause I have a very similar story. I had a guy send a customer neo Nazi propaganda

416
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:29,760
because he got mad at him and he got loaded and he did that. I fired the kid for cause

417
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:34,840
he took me to court I had to pay the New Jersey. Stupid labor court because they're all you

418
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:40,440
know, geez, let's just say there's not a lot of elephant judges there. They they don't

419
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:48,160
give a you pay pay the unemployment no matter what. So agarwal there's no like even legitimate

420
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:54,440
cause depending on where you are and in the Soviet Republic of California, you're paying.

421
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:58,800
So no offense to California. But it's just something I think you're right though in Texas

422
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:03,780
he wouldn't have to pay right in Florida never pay right it's just you have to understand

423
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:10,400
that he's crazy like he he's not done losing money on this. No, no, he's going to keep

424
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:15,400
going. Yeah, I would probably be a much mentally healthier person if Twitter kind of just like

425
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:20,360
went away. Clearly one of the worst mistakes in history. He claims he's working 70 hour

426
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:26,840
to 80 hour work weeks. I don't know. I I think if you if you think about what's motivating

427
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:32,360
think if you just if you just solve for what's the fastest way to do something and solve

428
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:36,920
it. And I think when it comes to these technical breakages that people are noticing, I'm not

429
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:41,520
saying it's the right thing to do, but I think his whole attitude is, oh, let's get and find

430
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:45,840
out. Let's just find out around and find out. Let's just see what happens. And when it breaks,

431
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:48,800
it breaks and we'll fix it. Then I'll bring in somebody who knows how to fix it and they'll

432
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:53,560
solve for it. I saw him on Twitter. I think it was yesterday morning or this morning talking

433
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:57,560
about, oh, yeah, sorry, that was down. The guy that wrote this just, you know, did a

434
00:35:57,560 --> 00:36:02,120
horrible job. And then, of course, the developer who wrote it chimes in on the thread. Yeah,

435
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:06,320
I saw that the Android app was like, what are you talking about, idiot? Oh, my God.

436
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:10,800
It's so embarrassing. But that's to me symptomatic. You know, it's more embarrassing firing someone

437
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:14,480
and then having to call them back to rehire them because you realize you shouldn't. Yeah,

438
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:19,840
yeah, he's moving fast, breaking things. And, you know, there's there's a bit of only Elon

439
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:27,040
Musk could do this because because he's rich and because of the crew around him. You know,

440
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:31,160
when you're in his presence, there's people around him who are captured by him. You know

441
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:37,640
what I mean? They are there to work for him and they see things the way he sees things

442
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:42,200
and they are there to enable him. And so he is surrounded by teams of people who are there

443
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:48,600
to enable him. He is profoundly rich. So he truly has f**k you money. And he can kind

444
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:56,040
of get away with stuff. He can kind of become this job in archetypal character, you know,

445
00:36:56,040 --> 00:37:01,960
where he is totally just coming in like a wrecking ball and tearing everything up in

446
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:05,840
the name of trying to make it work and fix it and make it better. And I think where the

447
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:12,640
jury is out is he could completely burn and spin out completely wreck Twitter, leave it

448
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:18,700
a dying husk and then somebody else awful comes around and snatches it up. Or he flushes

449
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:25,120
out all of the entitled employees who were slowing things down and making the place a

450
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:29,120
worse place to work. And he comes up with a core product that while it has some technical

451
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:33,840
issues in about three months, things are turned around and it's looking pretty good. It's

452
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:34,840
possible.

453
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:37,440
Is it $30 billion possible?

454
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:42,720
Honestly, it seems like an easier problem than landing hundreds of rockets on a platform

455
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:46,780
that's floating in an ocean that has wind and waves. And I mean, it seems like a simpler

456
00:37:46,780 --> 00:37:50,600
problem than what SpaceX is solving. And he managed to put a team together that could

457
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:55,560
do that. And Starlink too. Like it all seems like actually out of all of his problems,

458
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:59,560
out of all of his companies, Twitter actually seems like the simplest because it's truly

459
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:01,120
just a staffing problem.

460
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:08,480
I will concede that if he pulls this off, this is like, wow, amazing. Elon's right again.

461
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:11,180
Gee, like never question him again, right? Invest with him every time.

462
00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:16,400
But he'll never, all the people that are railing him now will never change their tune. They'll

463
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:17,400
never give him credit for it.

464
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:23,280
This is the problem, to pull this off, right? It's a consumer product effectively. You need

465
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:26,680
positive press, which I don't know if you've noticed, not happening.

466
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:27,680
True, true.

467
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:30,760
The people who work for you, you actually do need good engineers and they need to not

468
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:35,240
all hate you. So that's, I would say-

469
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:36,920
Yep, you got to have a team that's bought in.

470
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:41,960
A plurality of them don't like you. You made a lot of weird promises that while on some

471
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:48,160
level people could agree with about censorship and stuff like that, are anathema to advertisers

472
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:54,600
right now. So there's one revenue stream down and they piss off the press, who you absolutely

473
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:55,600
are going to need.

474
00:38:55,600 --> 00:39:02,200
I'll put it to you this way. If he wasn't Elon, the way Twitter would die is, okay,

475
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:08,720
let's just say somewhat right-wingy guy, let's just say Mike Dominic buys Twitter, right?

476
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:14,120
You know how they kill it? They just don't cover it, right? No traction. You just go

477
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:15,120
away.

478
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:16,120
It doesn't matter. Yeah.

479
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:17,120
Right.

480
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:18,120
They make it irrelevant.

481
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:23,000
His kind of sort of crazy persona is helping him, but at some point you need to generate

482
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:31,920
the revenue and SpaceX, thank you Defense Department and US government. Tesla, literally

483
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:36,960
thanks Obama, right? Lots of subsidies there, a lot of help. People are cheering for you.

484
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:41,560
You're being hailed as a hero, a climate change warrior. In this case, he's a villain and

485
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:48,600
those same forces that propelled him are actively rooting for him to fail and causing him, like

486
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:51,040
they're not just rooting, they're in the game.

487
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:56,200
Yeah. I'd say they're successful so far. You're right. And the other reason why I think you're

488
00:39:56,200 --> 00:40:01,440
right is if you go back to the premise, this whole thing was a lark. It was a intoxicated

489
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:06,000
tweet that he backed himself into a corner and then he got in a fight with the CEO and

490
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:10,080
he had to take it all the way. And now he's stuck with the serious problem and he's just

491
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:15,560
going to continue to behave erratically. The consequences of failure seem pretty dramatic

492
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:21,600
since Tesla is the most successful EV company. Starlink could change internet for all kinds

493
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:26,400
of people like myself. There's like a lot of consequences to him screwing this up and

494
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:30,160
it is going to be the process, is going to be in front of all of us.

495
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:32,440
It's literally going to happen on Twitter, right?

496
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:37,720
It's a fiat world, my friend.

497
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:43,800
Tailscale.com slash coder. That's where you go to try it for free for up to 20 devices

498
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:49,880
and support the show. Tailscale is a zero-config VPN. You'll get it up and going in minutes.

499
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:54,900
It manages your firewall rules. It takes care of your NAT situation. Devices connect directly

500
00:40:54,900 --> 00:41:00,200
to each other in a mesh flat network using WireGuard's noise protocol. It builds you

501
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:05,480
the best VPN in the biz and it's so smart about how it routes its traffic too. I think

502
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:08,760
you're going to be blown away by that. Even if your different devices are separated by

503
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:14,040
firewalls and subnets, TailScale just works. Everything looks like it's on a flat network.

504
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:18,520
I was really grateful for TailScale recently when we had a power outage. Bunch of devices

505
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:23,160
came back up that were using dynamic IPs that I'd forgotten about. So I did know the IPs

506
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:28,160
of a couple of my systems, but their TailScale IP stayed the same.

507
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:32,040
So I just connected to them over TailScale and then figured out what the IP address was

508
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:37,060
for the local LAN. And again, like I was saying, TailScale is real smart. It routes that traffic

509
00:41:37,060 --> 00:41:39,700
over the LAN. It doesn't have to go out to the internet through like some sort of old

510
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:44,980
school tunnel. It figures out where it's supposed to go and it protects that traffic with WireGuard.

511
00:41:44,980 --> 00:41:48,700
Devices connect directly to each other after you sign in through your existing identity

512
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:52,360
provider. So whatever you're already comfortable with. If you want to enforce multi-factor

513
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:55,800
authentication there, you can. If you're using it in a work setting and you want to be able

514
00:41:55,800 --> 00:42:01,800
to deauthorize employees, you can. It's so great. And TailScale VPNs are always on, on

515
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:07,520
every OS I always use, so it's always there. They've got a GUI based ACL editor, great

516
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:13,960
DNS features, and it's just dead simple to use. I use TailScale every day. You're going

517
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:20,600
to love it. So go try it for yourself for free up to 20 machines at tailscale.com slash

518
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:24,320
coder.

519
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:30,900
So in today's version of Never Trust the Tech Press, whenever they're covering anything,

520
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:36,720
the collapse of FTX and Sam Bankman fraud is quite the headline right now. It's what

521
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:40,960
all the other tech stuff is talking about. But there's one angle that I thought the coder

522
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:44,360
audience should be aware of just so they know how this stuff works in the future so they

523
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:51,960
can sniff these things out. It turns out, Vox, I know Mr. Dominic's a big fan over there

524
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:52,960
of Vox.

525
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:54,520
I like the verse, yeah.

526
00:42:54,520 --> 00:43:04,980
Vox took direct money from SBF to basically write puff pieces about what a great generous

527
00:43:04,980 --> 00:43:13,440
billionaire he was. They wrote a whole spiel on him. They basically wrote propaganda for

528
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:20,260
the scammer who was stealing from people and embezzling money and investing it and sending

529
00:43:20,260 --> 00:43:26,480
money to politicians. It turns out he was also just paying Vox Media to just write positively

530
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:31,880
about him, about him personally, and I'm sure about FTX as a result.

531
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:36,160
And I think you have to understand, I'll put a link to the thread in the show notes. I

532
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:39,120
think you got to understand how this stuff works. And this thread kind of reveals, it

533
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:44,480
pulls that curtain back a little bit. And I know this to be true. We got three emails

534
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:49,560
this week offering to pay us to bring somebody on the show and talk about them like they're

535
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:55,180
an expert and a pro. Three of them this week, just this week.

536
00:43:55,180 --> 00:44:00,240
So I thought with all of this, if you're interested at all with all this FTX crap going down,

537
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:04,880
I'll put a link to that in the show notes. You can go read it for yourself. There's just,

538
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:08,240
I think, a real revealing that happens there. And the whole thing is sickening, I have to

539
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:12,440
be honest. I guess I'm glad to see him caught.

540
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:17,400
You know the other crazy thing about that? It was like a house of 10 of them, a 30 million

541
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:24,000
dollar mansion in the Bahamas. And they were all sleeping together, living in this house,

542
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:28,040
embezzling money between their companies. It was all out there in front of the press,

543
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:33,840
all of it. All available, all of their family connections, everything was there. But it

544
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:40,840
just didn't get reported on. And instead Fortune magazine ran a piece back in September with

545
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:47,960
SBF on the cover saying that he was the next Warren Buffett. This guy who turns out to

546
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:54,960
be a total scammer and basically issuing paper money. They had billions and billions and

547
00:44:54,960 --> 00:45:01,600
billions and billions in liabilities and a couple million in actual funds. That was the

548
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:06,560
peak example of tech and financing just getting absolutely out of control.

549
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:15,000
So, do you remember the tech press of the early aughts? If you want to go really hardcore,

550
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:19,600
some of the quote featured stories. This is pretty common, right?

551
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:22,280
Yeah, it's probably been an issue in tech forever, I would imagine.

552
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:25,760
For a long time, right? Or how about Apple was really good at doing this, although they

553
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:30,800
didn't pay people. But like Access Journalism, they only talk to people they like that say

554
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:36,560
nice things about them, which makes a lot of sense. I mean, Fox did disclose this. I'm

555
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:44,040
not necessarily here to defend them. I am a fan of their work, especially The Verge.

556
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:49,560
But I will say that it's... So I don't know anything about SBF. We've talked about it

557
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:53,680
before. I'm not super into the crypto stuff. The thing that's caught my eye is the lack

558
00:45:53,680 --> 00:46:00,080
of actual like tech reporting going on. And I think we talked about this privately, right?

559
00:46:00,080 --> 00:46:03,480
They've really... And I can only really speak about The Verge because that's the one I follow

560
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:10,400
the most. They've really leaned into this like, these are media company thing. And it

561
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:18,600
feels a little weird. Now, I tend to believe, but I could be wrong, that there are interesting

562
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:23,960
tech companies being founded that nobody hears about and interesting devices being built.

563
00:46:23,960 --> 00:46:29,160
Software applications being built, stuff like that. And they're somehow not getting, in

564
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:33,760
my eyes, as much oxygen as they used to. I don't know that that might be unfair.

565
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:35,000
I completely agree though.

566
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:39,240
Well, I just look at the front page and it's like four Twitter stories, right?

567
00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:40,240
Yeah.

568
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:46,120
And I get it. Elon Musk says crazy crap and that's easy clickbait and it is a business.

569
00:46:46,120 --> 00:46:55,120
But we've talked about this with events too. I kind of feel the tech press is like... The

570
00:46:55,120 --> 00:47:02,040
press is in capital letters in bold and tech is like small size font, lowercase italics.

571
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:06,760
I do believe there must be innovation going on somewhere. Maybe it's not here, right?

572
00:47:06,760 --> 00:47:11,480
Maybe there's some kid in Shanghai doing it. Maybe there's some awesome Indian startup

573
00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:18,040
that we should be hearing about or some biotech invention in Oslo. It doesn't necessarily

574
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:23,440
need to be Silicon Valley, but it's just, I don't know. I know that's not the story

575
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:24,680
you were going with. I just...

576
00:47:24,680 --> 00:47:29,960
No, I think you're right. You're right. You zoom out and I see exactly what you're seeing.

577
00:47:29,960 --> 00:47:34,120
I trace it back to VC funding. I trace it back to VC funding, networking.

578
00:47:34,120 --> 00:47:37,000
Wouldn't the VCs want their stuff being covered?

579
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:41,560
Yeah, but it's all a game, right? Certain VC firms have a lot of credibility and a

580
00:47:41,560 --> 00:47:48,160
lot of brand recognition. So if you're backed by one of those, then all of a sudden the

581
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:52,160
tech press is just more likely to cover you. And when they talk about you, they'll write

582
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:56,600
that as something that gives your project or your company authority. You've noticed

583
00:47:56,600 --> 00:48:01,520
this, right? It's like these certain luxury brand VC companies, when they invest in you

584
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:06,600
like Sequoia, who also invested in FTX, when they invest in you, it's a big deal.

585
00:48:06,600 --> 00:48:13,680
So okay. So that Springboard documentary that Vox did, I think it's on YouTube. It's on

586
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:21,680
YouTube about the Palm OS and kind of that first generation of what we now call smartphone,

587
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:28,840
what we used to call PDAs basically, that didn't take off. That was like old Vox, right?

588
00:48:28,840 --> 00:48:33,200
Old The Verge. Really good. They talked to the principals. They talked to engineers.

589
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:40,600
They talked to designers. It was a refreshing blast of the past. I mean, even the new homepage

590
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:43,000
looks like Twitter, which is interesting.

591
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:48,840
Well, before we move off, I want to read something. This is from Sequoia's website. They were

592
00:48:48,840 --> 00:48:54,040
so proud of this that they actually had this publicly posted on their website as an example

593
00:48:54,040 --> 00:49:01,120
of how hip they are. This is why they decided to invest in FTX. They write, that's when

594
00:49:01,120 --> 00:49:06,820
SPF told Sequoia about the so-called super app. Quote, I want FTX to be the place where

595
00:49:06,820 --> 00:49:12,600
you can do anything you want with your next dollar. You can buy Bitcoin. You can send

596
00:49:12,600 --> 00:49:17,020
money in whatever currency to any friend, anywhere in the world. You can buy a banana.

597
00:49:17,020 --> 00:49:22,120
You can do anything you want with your money from inside FTX.

598
00:49:22,120 --> 00:49:28,440
And then it goes on to say, suddenly the chat window on Sequoia's side of the Zoom lights

599
00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:35,400
up with partners freaking out. In all caps, I love this founder, typed one partner. I'm

600
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:42,080
a 10 out of 10, pinged another. Yes, with three exclamation marks, exclaimed a third.

601
00:49:42,080 --> 00:49:47,500
What Sequoia was reacting to was the scale of SPF's vision. It wasn't a story about

602
00:49:47,500 --> 00:49:53,920
how we might use FinTech in the future or crypto or a new kind of bank even. It was

603
00:49:53,920 --> 00:50:00,800
a vision about the future of money itself with a total addressable market of every person

604
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:04,480
in the entire planet. This is the hubris.

605
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:08,360
Do you think they actually believe that though? See, I think that's just marketing bull.

606
00:50:08,360 --> 00:50:15,600
Well, then it turns out that it was discovered that during that entire meeting, SPF was also

607
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:20,560
playing League of Legends and they thought that was so great. Oh my God, he's so brilliant.

608
00:50:20,560 --> 00:50:27,120
He can pitch us, which was a three sentence pitch about basically he wants to turn FTX

609
00:50:27,120 --> 00:50:32,240
into how you spend your next dollar. He can pitch us while playing a video game. He must

610
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:33,800
be a genius.

611
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:35,320
I hate myself so much right now.

612
00:50:35,320 --> 00:50:41,040
I know. They write, actually, this is actually what they say. Not only that, Aurora says,

613
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:45,400
but League of Legends is kind of a multiplayer online battle arena video game and they explain

614
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:50,240
why it's really hard and you got to do gang killings. She says, I was watching over SPF's

615
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:56,120
shoulder and he answered that final question from Sequoia like, yeah, and this guy is in

616
00:50:56,120 --> 00:51:01,840
there playing this game. It's amazing. And then they write that he must be a genius.

617
00:51:01,840 --> 00:51:07,840
We have to figure out how to work with him. He has clear purpose and well understood deliverables.

618
00:51:07,840 --> 00:51:14,360
That's a powerful combination they write. All he said was, we want to be able to spend

619
00:51:14,360 --> 00:51:17,600
your next dollar and they were throwing money at this guy.

620
00:51:17,600 --> 00:51:21,640
If it was Dota, would they have been less impressed? I'm just saying.

621
00:51:21,640 --> 00:51:27,160
There you go. So that is the state of VC and finances and tech and this is the kind of

622
00:51:27,160 --> 00:51:28,680
crap that it leads to.

623
00:51:28,680 --> 00:51:33,400
Okay, so the funnier part of the story to me is if you look at this guy, like just take

624
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:38,680
a look, knowing nothing about the business, he is the young Mark Zuckerberg mold. He literally

625
00:51:38,680 --> 00:51:44,880
is the stereotype. Went to MIT, physically looks like a Zuckerberg clone, right? Different

626
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:49,400
hair, but you know, same. Like so much for diversity and inclusion, right guys? We would

627
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:53,160
just want the rich little white kid who went to MIT.

628
00:51:53,160 --> 00:51:57,580
He played this character well, you know, because he'd wear a hoodie or a t-shirt.

629
00:51:57,580 --> 00:51:59,760
My hat's off to him. Good job.

630
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:05,560
He pretended like he only drove a Toyota Corolla and that was like the point of when he drives

631
00:52:05,560 --> 00:52:10,920
a Corolla. Of course, it turns out he also has like a garage full of very high-end sports

632
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:12,800
cars. He lives in a $30 million mansion.

633
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:17,120
Well, that's part of the character, right? You have to pretend like you actually live

634
00:52:17,120 --> 00:52:21,040
to code and only care about the technology and have this great vision.

635
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:26,680
And his whole thing was something about just being ultimately altruistic. Like their goal

636
00:52:26,680 --> 00:52:31,040
as a company, his company goal for FTX was, is to make as much money as possible so they

637
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:35,040
could do as much good in the world as possible. And that's why they were paying off Vox and

638
00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:40,680
others to create this bulls**t image about the most generous billionaire in the world.

639
00:52:40,680 --> 00:52:46,360
And it was all fed into this whole hype image. And the idea was to basically make this guy

640
00:52:46,360 --> 00:52:51,640
the face of the crypto industry. There's reports that he was working with the SEC to do that.

641
00:52:51,640 --> 00:52:56,600
And who knows, man? But it's just a very gross situation. And a lot of people got wiped out

642
00:52:56,600 --> 00:52:57,600
as a result.

643
00:52:57,600 --> 00:53:02,080
And they're playing around with their own stupid crappy token, paper money. And they

644
00:53:02,080 --> 00:53:07,920
used their paper money as collateral. And their collateral was based on their customer

645
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:12,440
deposits. And when their customers did a bank run after their balance sheet was leaked,

646
00:53:12,440 --> 00:53:18,000
their collateral became worth nothing. And so all of their loans got basically margin

647
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:23,200
called because the collateral wasn't worth enough anymore and FTX just started collapsing.

648
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:27,560
And then they suspended withdrawals. Then customers couldn't get their funds out. And

649
00:53:27,560 --> 00:53:33,880
then a few days after that, clearly somebody internally had a backdoor. And they drained

650
00:53:33,880 --> 00:53:36,940
$600 million out of customer accounts and stole it.

651
00:53:36,940 --> 00:53:40,720
It's amazing how everything meant to replace the banking system turns out to be like a

652
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:43,920
really s**tty 1800s version of the banking system.

653
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:50,160
Well, I think the red flag is anytime they're screwing around with their own currency, their

654
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:54,000
own token, that's a red flag. That's an immediate no. Don't do it.

655
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,240
Wait, wait, wait, wait. You don't want mad botter token?

656
00:53:56,240 --> 00:53:57,240
Yeah, exactly.

657
00:53:57,240 --> 00:54:00,320
Jar jar coin coming to you.

658
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:05,560
It's better to wash this stuff out now than when the Fed does start printing money again

659
00:54:05,560 --> 00:54:10,480
and people go risk on and cryptocurrencies start rallying again. Then this guy just would

660
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:14,760
have been able to cover up all of this. He was trying to raise millions in funding. And

661
00:54:14,760 --> 00:54:17,480
if he would have gotten that millions in funding a week before he collapsed-

662
00:54:17,480 --> 00:54:19,040
Also been lit on fire.

663
00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:21,560
He would have covered all this up. He would have papered it over.

664
00:54:21,560 --> 00:54:23,960
I just want to say you're adorable right now.

665
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:24,960
Why is that?

666
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:29,840
You think that by, or you implied that by washing this stuff out now, that the next

667
00:54:29,840 --> 00:54:34,320
time the money printers go burr, these very same VCs aren't just going to do the same

668
00:54:34,320 --> 00:54:36,360
thing. I mean, are you crazy?

669
00:54:36,360 --> 00:54:38,760
Yeah, I suppose they will. Yeah, I guess they would, wouldn't they?

670
00:54:38,760 --> 00:54:44,600
Yeah. I mean, you know, this stuff is just like the new pets.com, right? Nothing's changed.

671
00:54:44,600 --> 00:54:50,560
It is totally, it is, it is the 2008 financial crisis and the dot com bubble in one event

672
00:54:50,560 --> 00:54:55,280
for crypto. I don't know. I think, I think the more I watch all of this, the more at

673
00:54:55,280 --> 00:55:00,160
all, just all this web three stuff is a total scam. It's all a scam.

674
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:03,520
I don't think it's all a scam. I think the underlying technology for blockchain actually

675
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:08,560
has some very boring, very boring applications.

676
00:55:08,560 --> 00:55:14,100
I agree. I agree with that. Yeah. But it is not like this universal database replacement

677
00:55:14,100 --> 00:55:18,600
that all of these projects claim to be and their tokens, they're all fake paper money

678
00:55:18,600 --> 00:55:23,340
and the people behind the projects have been issued the token in advance for free. So whenever

679
00:55:23,340 --> 00:55:27,200
the token goes up slightly in value, they, they make a bunch of money and it's all just

680
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:32,640
a red flag. There's only one true crypto and that is the Bitcoin, my friend.

681
00:55:32,640 --> 00:55:36,200
No, there is one other currency, a boost baby.

682
00:55:36,200 --> 00:55:43,040
Ask not what your podcast can boost for you, but what you can boost for your podcast.

683
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:50,200
And you tech sent us 250,000 sats this week showing some love for his favorite JB hosts

684
00:55:50,200 --> 00:55:56,680
and show. Mike, you are freaking awesome.

685
00:55:56,680 --> 00:56:02,920
Suck on that stow, which is not around anymore. Those jerks over at Linux unplugged feel embarrassed

686
00:56:02,920 --> 00:56:08,980
now. Thank you and you tech. We appreciate layout. Uh, tack off seven 51 boosted in live

687
00:56:08,980 --> 00:56:14,080
during the show with a 2009 sats. He was trying out a live boost to see if we got it. He's

688
00:56:14,080 --> 00:56:18,180
hacked together a whole system. He's got like Linode in there. He's sending a boost with

689
00:56:18,180 --> 00:56:25,880
web hooks. Uh, he's got a matrix I think to compose it and it landed. So congrats tack.

690
00:56:25,880 --> 00:56:30,600
You built a, you built yourself a system there. I think that's pretty impressive. Strung it

691
00:56:30,600 --> 00:56:34,440
all together and made it work. That's the nice thing about an open network, isn't it?

692
00:56:34,440 --> 00:56:41,840
All right. Elry seven 41 boosted in with a row of ducks, 2,222 sats. So the two factor

693
00:56:41,840 --> 00:56:47,160
stuff hits super close to home for me. A very close loved one of mine, not mentioning who

694
00:56:47,160 --> 00:56:51,240
because I don't think they want to be identified, just went through all of this and even worse,

695
00:56:51,240 --> 00:56:56,960
they couldn't get any cellular connection. So no SMS for the last two weeks. Oh man,

696
00:56:56,960 --> 00:57:02,960
I'm going to send a contact form with more details. He did. And uh, he essentially wrote

697
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:08,560
a really great blog post on preventing a two factor authentication crisis. But from everything

698
00:57:08,560 --> 00:57:14,840
he learned, uh, from going through his family member and also listening to your journey,

699
00:57:14,840 --> 00:57:20,400
this looks really great. Uh, he really recommends off the two because again of that cloud sync,

700
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:23,880
which might be the way I would go to if I was going to recommend anything for somebody

701
00:57:23,880 --> 00:57:29,880
who was non-technical, might be offy. If anybody could tell me why that's a bad idea, I'd love

702
00:57:29,880 --> 00:57:34,160
to hear it. Thank you, Ellery. We will link to the preventing two factor authentication

703
00:57:34,160 --> 00:57:38,960
crisis in the show notes for listeners who want to give that a review. I think that's

704
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:45,180
probably a good idea. Dennis V boosted in with a hundred sats. Finally, I'm back on

705
00:57:45,180 --> 00:57:49,080
track with the show sending my first boost via the fountain app and the ear and sats

706
00:57:49,080 --> 00:57:53,160
while listening. I just want to say I'm using Yuba key for my two factor authentication.

707
00:57:53,160 --> 00:57:58,200
I needed to read, download the Yuba key authenticator and I had to hold my key onto it. I'm currently

708
00:57:58,200 --> 00:58:02,920
driving a harvester in Australia and as a backpacker from Germany and I had plenty of

709
00:58:02,920 --> 00:58:07,440
hours to catch up on all your podcasts. Any recommendations for other podcasts will follow.

710
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:13,720
Thanks for all the shows. Listen to them while I'm working. Time goes by fast. Hmm. You have

711
00:58:13,720 --> 00:58:19,120
another show recommendation. My other shows are Star Trek shows, so they're very embarrassing.

712
00:58:19,120 --> 00:58:23,240
If you like Star Trek shows, I got a few recommendations. Oh, I think you should just recommend those.

713
00:58:23,240 --> 00:58:29,000
I like business wars depending on who it is. They just did Chipotle and Taco Bell, but

714
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:35,280
I'm very boring. Mine are mostly business and news and I listen to sections of ATV.

715
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:41,400
I recommend The Greatest Generation. It's a Star Trek podcast and it's fun. Hey guys,

716
00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:48,200
don't take themselves too seriously. Purple Dog boosted in with 3000 sats. I wonder if

717
00:58:48,200 --> 00:58:53,040
Purple Dog is Alex. He says, I self host all my important stuff because my backups are

718
00:58:53,040 --> 00:58:58,280
in cloud storage and then they're encrypted locally first. The keys are passwords and

719
00:58:58,280 --> 00:59:02,200
the two factor codes are all in Bitwarden. Bitwarden has that two factor authentication

720
00:59:02,200 --> 00:59:08,800
recovery codes and I can store that in my desk with a Yuba key to unlock that. The TOTP

721
00:59:08,800 --> 00:59:14,120
is for my Authy. If my house ever burned down, I lost everything. I decided I'd use Authy

722
00:59:14,120 --> 00:59:17,360
because the backup password is memorized and I actually don't store that in Bitwarden.

723
00:59:17,360 --> 00:59:23,320
So he's kind of got a mix. Like he's got basically his access to Bitwarden is in Authy and then

724
00:59:23,320 --> 00:59:27,280
he has his other two factors inside Bitwarden. So he kind of has like a disaster plan if

725
00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:31,160
his house burns down using that Authy sync, but he doesn't use Authy for everything. That's

726
00:59:31,160 --> 00:59:36,520
a clever idea, dog. Purple Dog continues with another 2000 sats. You know, I actually kind

727
00:59:36,520 --> 00:59:41,000
of like Chris's ad read voice. It makes it much easier to skip. I already use Linode

728
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:47,600
Talescale in Bitwarden. That is intentional, I will say. If you use it already, then just

729
00:59:47,600 --> 00:59:52,280
let a friend know, you know, spread the word. Send them Mike's way too sometimes. You know,

730
00:59:52,280 --> 00:59:59,160
there's always more places to visit. That's true. I love this next username. Hybrid Sarcasm.

731
00:59:59,160 --> 01:00:04,560
Boost in with 1024 sats. Coming in hot with the boost. Here's a tip for memorizing the

732
01:00:04,560 --> 01:00:10,200
wife's phone number. Change her name or alias title in the contacts app so the phone number

733
01:00:10,200 --> 01:00:16,200
is what you see always instead of her name or their name. Only took me a few weeks and

734
01:00:16,200 --> 01:00:21,280
I have that number down pat. Five years later, still in my head. That's actually a pretty

735
01:00:21,280 --> 01:00:26,320
good idea is to put it in the contact information. That's, I think I'll do that hybrid. I might

736
01:00:26,320 --> 01:00:30,220
try that. Yeah, that actually that would help. I, you know, I used to have like a whole list

737
01:00:30,220 --> 01:00:36,440
of phone numbers memorized and then I got a smartphone. Then I got a phone. Yeah. Yeah.

738
01:00:36,440 --> 01:00:42,560
Big dot boost in with 1701 sats. The enterprise boost. Make it so we recently gave him advice

739
01:00:42,560 --> 01:00:47,400
to check out TNG and then last week we mentioned perhaps strange new worlds. He says I definitely

740
01:00:47,400 --> 01:00:51,520
want to watch strange new worlds. I want to watch rings of power first though. I got a

741
01:00:51,520 --> 01:00:55,960
few friends who like rings of power and I don't want to enrage them too much. Also,

742
01:00:55,960 --> 01:00:59,720
I don't watch TV series on a regular basis, so I mostly only watch them every few months.

743
01:00:59,720 --> 01:01:06,200
So what I do is I watch the first season of each show first. Whoa, this is a, whoa, this

744
01:01:06,200 --> 01:01:10,840
is wild. I, I don't know if that's allowed. That feels weird. So he doesn't just binge

745
01:01:10,840 --> 01:01:17,960
it. Yeah. Also, I feel like, I feel like I got to give an honorable mention to lower

746
01:01:17,960 --> 01:01:22,480
decks. It was a solid season. If you like the fun, I hate fun. If you like fun and funny.

747
01:01:22,480 --> 01:01:29,720
Yeah, it was a good solid season. So if you've got like, you know, 13, 14 year old kid around,

748
01:01:29,720 --> 01:01:33,640
it's great. It's great for that kind of thing too. And then I'm going to give up, I'm going

749
01:01:33,640 --> 01:01:39,880
to give a longterm plug once you get all done their peg to the expanse because that will

750
01:01:39,880 --> 01:01:43,240
make your life better. So I got, I got it. I got it. I got to give that. I got to check

751
01:01:43,240 --> 01:01:47,840
it out. That's on my list. Yeah. You got to give it at least five episodes too. I like

752
01:01:47,840 --> 01:01:53,680
we recommend shows, but we're like, and the first half is terrible. Sometimes you're right.

753
01:01:53,680 --> 01:01:57,280
You know what? You know what? Sometimes that's how it goes. That takes them a little bit

754
01:01:57,280 --> 01:02:00,040
to get their feet. Like our first hundred episodes, probably not so high. It's like

755
01:02:00,040 --> 01:02:04,600
going to bed with me. It's all terrible. No, I'm kidding. Actually, I don't want the review.

756
01:02:04,600 --> 01:02:10,440
No Yelp reviews, please. Okay. Dave Jones, the pod sage boosted in with those big set

757
01:02:10,440 --> 01:02:18,880
of enterprise sats 17 double Oh one sats. Dave says the fourth season of TNG is pure

758
01:02:18,880 --> 01:02:25,480
magic. The cast and the writers just gel together to form something truly new and special. Shut

759
01:02:25,480 --> 01:02:31,280
up Wesley. I agree, Dave. However, I actually think it, it really starts in season three.

760
01:02:31,280 --> 01:02:36,120
There's spots in season three, like offspring and a few other episodes that are just so

761
01:02:36,120 --> 01:02:41,120
good. I like the, I like the cringe of season one though. I don't know. And I technically

762
01:02:41,120 --> 01:02:46,160
say part one of best of both worlds is probably slightly better than part two. And part one

763
01:02:46,160 --> 01:02:52,080
takes place in season three, Dave Jones. So is that the old one? That's the mirror universe

764
01:02:52,080 --> 01:02:57,480
one, right? No. Best of both worlds is when Picard gets assimilated. Oh yeah. Who does,

765
01:02:57,480 --> 01:03:01,760
first of all, wouldn't it be nice to be assimilated? I feel like that would actually solve a lot

766
01:03:01,760 --> 01:03:06,760
of problems. Not to mention you'd live forever. And no more food bill. No more food bill.

767
01:03:06,760 --> 01:03:10,720
No more having to think about nothing. No more having to worry. Talk about a uniform.

768
01:03:10,720 --> 01:03:16,280
You want to talk about a uniform. Chris's uniform becomes part of the Borg high five.

769
01:03:16,280 --> 01:03:21,160
Problem solved, dude. Problem solved, right? So great. Oh, I love it. All right. Thank

770
01:03:21,160 --> 01:03:27,840
you everybody who boosted in a Hannegan, a Hannegan, 4,000 sats. Thank you everybody.

771
01:03:27,840 --> 01:03:32,080
New podcast apps.com. If you'd like to boost in, you go grab one. Sats are cheap right

772
01:03:32,080 --> 01:03:35,840
now. They're probably going to be cheap for a while, especially if a 2023 ends up being

773
01:03:35,840 --> 01:03:39,520
a recession. So don't grab a lot, but grab enough to send a boost in. Why not send a

774
01:03:39,520 --> 01:03:42,480
little extra in since they're cheap right now? We still love them. They still mean something

775
01:03:42,480 --> 01:03:47,440
to us. Strike if you're in the U S blue wallet, if you're outside the U S cash app is also

776
01:03:47,440 --> 01:03:51,840
really great. And if you want to challenge RoboSats, if you've got the tour browser,

777
01:03:51,840 --> 01:03:56,480
our Coder QA members keep us going. They invest in the ongoing production and the Coderly

778
01:03:56,480 --> 01:04:02,520
is coming together. It has been a wild, wild quarter. Q4 is a hard one and I blame Halloween.

779
01:04:02,520 --> 01:04:07,040
It threw everything off. I do. Oh, and I want to thank you all for taking the survey I posted

780
01:04:07,040 --> 01:04:11,320
a couple of weeks ago regarding languages and frameworks you're using that is going

781
01:04:11,320 --> 01:04:14,560
into the Coderly.

782
01:04:14,560 --> 01:04:20,280
You can support the show and get an ad free feed at coderqa.co or do it for all the shows,

783
01:04:20,280 --> 01:04:25,560
get all the shows ad free at Jupiter.party. That's how you do that over there. And then

784
01:04:25,560 --> 01:04:32,440
of course we're live on Mondays. We do it at a 9 a.m. Pacific noon Eastern over at Jupiter.tube.

785
01:04:32,440 --> 01:04:35,200
And then we've got the matrix chat room going during the live show, but it's really going

786
01:04:35,200 --> 01:04:39,280
all week. Mike and I pop in there throughout the week. Details of that coder.show slash

787
01:04:39,280 --> 01:04:45,760
matrix. You know, we we could have for all these times we mentioned the matrix, we could

788
01:04:45,760 --> 01:04:50,720
have had like a Keanu Reeves soundbite or a blue pill thing, you know, whatever it is

789
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:54,000
this whole time. We've missed out on that. Oh, you don't want to say red pill. I get

790
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:58,800
it. Oh, oh, is it? I just never remember which one the blue pill is. Well, although blue

791
01:04:58,800 --> 01:05:02,600
pill, you stay in the matrix, right? Right. Don't you want to be in the matrix? Yeah.

792
01:05:02,600 --> 01:05:06,800
I mean, right now I'd love to be in the matrix. Let's call it things. I know now about how

793
01:05:06,800 --> 01:05:12,040
gullible VCs are. Just send me back. Right. I want to do a what is it? Time with that

794
01:05:12,040 --> 01:05:17,520
time. What's the one with? Let's go back. Oh, my God. Not Steve Buscemi. Are you talking

795
01:05:17,520 --> 01:05:22,000
to are you talking about back to the quantum leap? Oh, no. I want to do a quantum leap.

796
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:29,120
I want to go back to like, give me two thousand nine. Just send me back. New York. Two thousand

797
01:05:29,120 --> 01:05:33,200
nine. I'll be like, listen, guys, we're going to make an app. It's going to say one word

798
01:05:33,200 --> 01:05:37,760
and that word is yo. You're going to give me five billion dollars. Amazing. You're right.

799
01:05:37,760 --> 01:05:43,320
And we know for a fact that they would say yes. We should have known with yo. We should

800
01:05:43,320 --> 01:05:47,920
have. We should have. No, I should have just, you know, fired everybody. I'll Elon started

801
01:05:47,920 --> 01:05:54,720
a new company, just went all, you know, all in on conning. I mean, acquiring VC investment.

802
01:05:54,720 --> 01:05:59,200
All right. Do you have any or you want to send people this week? If you've got a time

803
01:05:59,200 --> 01:06:05,920
mission, can you come to me? No, I don't know. Dominic, I'm dot com. I'm trying to find something

804
01:06:05,920 --> 01:06:11,520
more fun than Twitter. But for now, at Dumanuco on Twitter. Yeah, that's matrix for me. It's

805
01:06:11,520 --> 01:06:15,640
my social network. It is matrix. I'm in the matrix all the time. Yeah. At Kota Radio Show

806
01:06:15,640 --> 01:06:21,440
is the is the show on Twitter. If if you're doing that, you know, otherwise you can just

807
01:06:21,440 --> 01:06:25,880
go get links and stuff and just go to our website. That's a good idea. Kota dot show.

808
01:06:25,880 --> 01:06:30,680
This episode would be at Kota dot show slash for 92 links to everything we talked about

809
01:06:30,680 --> 01:06:35,480
over there, including our RSS feed. So you just get that nice edited version by Drew

810
01:06:35,480 --> 01:06:39,180
whenever we publish it. Thanks so much for tuning this week's episode of the Kota Radio

811
01:06:39,180 --> 01:06:56,720
program. And I hope to see you right back here next week.
