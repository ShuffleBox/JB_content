00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,240
This is KOTOR Radio, episode 418 for June 14th, 2021.

2
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:20,240
Hello friend and welcome into Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show, taking a pragmatic look

3
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:24,600
at the art and the business of software development and the world of technology.

4
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:26,600
This episode is brought to you by a Cloud Guru.

5

8
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:44,800
My name is Chris and helping me sort through this world of technology, it is our host,

9
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:45,800
Mr. Dominic.

10
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:46,800
Hello, Mike.

11
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:47,800
Hello.

12
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:48,800
Hello, handsome.

13
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:49,800
How are you doing over there?

14
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:50,800
I am great.

15
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,760
You know, I am luxuriating my AirPods Max as usual.

16
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,360
Oh, with your spatial audio?

17
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:58,320
I'm hearing every angle of you, Chris.

18
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,400
Are you actually on the AirPods Max right now?

19
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:05,400
I am because the venerable headphones you sent me years ago have finally crapped out.

20
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:09,040
And how do they, how does it work for this job, for this particular task?

21
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,840
It just sounds like regular headphones.

22
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:13,800
I got to admit, I'm a sucker for the kind of the music gimmicks.

23
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:18,040
I was the guy who got big into DVD audio back in the day when that was...

24
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:19,040
Oh no.

25
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,040
Oh yeah.

26
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:21,040
It sounded amazing.

27
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,040
Screw CDs.

28
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,040
DVD audio, man.

29
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,040
That's right.

30
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:29,720
I was the guy that has a ridiculous amount of gigs of flax of his favorite tracks on

31
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:34,640
his Plex server and he streams it using Plex amp to his phone so that way he can have high

32
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,400
quality audio on the go.

33
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:41,900
So you know, when any kind of large presence music service starts talking about lossless

34
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:47,120
audio and spatial audio in the case of Apple, I actually perk up a little bit because I

35
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:48,120
got to admit something, man.

36
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:53,840
I can sometimes, I'm actually ashamed to say because it's kind of embarrassing, but I can

37
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:57,440
actually get a little teary eyed sometimes when I'm hearing like just gorgeous music,

38
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:59,220
you know, something really sounding good.

39
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:02,560
Like it just gets me right in the damn feels.

40
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:09,440
And so I'm into the music gimmicks as long as it sounds good because I do have a pretty

41
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,440
critical ear.

42
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:14,080
I would be one of those things where I feel like I'd buy those AirPod Maxes and be expecting

43
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:18,320
the world and put them on and get kind of disappointed that they weren't as great as

44
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:19,320
I expected.

45
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:24,520
So I've been going through the Apple music spatial audio playlist, you know, as one does

46
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,240
while you're working on coding, right?

47
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:28,560
You listen to music.

48
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:34,240
I have to say it's, it's really a mixed bag.

49
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:36,160
It's not a straight improvement.

50
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,160
Go figure, right?

51
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:43,360
See, I'm not enough of an audio guy to really understand why, but a lot of the nineties

52
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:47,980
rock stuff that I would be listening to is a really just awful.

53
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:50,240
The few that have been spatial audio fide, right?

54
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:54,360
It's like maybe they had to go back to original masters that just weren't that great or something.

55
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,360
I guess.

56
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:59,440
But then if you listen to anything like super new, like especially like pop, right?

57
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,440
It's actually pretty good.

58
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:01,440
Right?

59
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:04,200
Anything that's like overproduced, you know, Katy Perry, that kind of thing.

60
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,960
You're in good shape.

61
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:06,960
I don't know.

62
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:10,680
It's like, I mean, I like it overall, but definitely not like like your green day is

63
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:11,680
not coming out.

64
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:12,680
Great.

65
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,880
And then one of the things, you know, that's going to be hit and miss is how good is the

66
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:15,880
original audio?

67
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:19,520
It's the positive is that they have to go back to original source.

68
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:23,040
And so sometimes it just sounds incredible, but the negative can be if what they're going

69
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,160
back to, isn't that great?

70
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,840
You know, garbage in garbage out.

71
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:26,840
True.

72
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,480
It'd be the problem.

73
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:35,560
Well while we're talking about kind of expensive things that touch our bods, I am embarrassingly

74
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,120
into my launch now.

75
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,120
Yup.

76
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,120
Same.

77
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:42,280
Didn't know if it'd take like this, but here's how I knew I was really liking this new keyboard.

78
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:46,040
So the system 76 launch, this is like my week and a half point with it.

79
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:49,160
You know, I think maybe I'm almost at two weeks right now.

80
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:53,380
And I actually miss not using it when I'm not in the studio.

81
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:59,260
And when I get back in the studio and start using it again, it's a joy to return to.

82
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:00,260
And it's like, Oh, look at me.

83
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:01,680
I'm typing fast again.

84
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,400
And honestly, that's the benchmark as far as I'm concerned.

85
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:11,040
This is the favorite, my favorite right here, my, my, probably my favorite all time keyboard.

86
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,000
Yeah, I love it.

87
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I have one too.

88
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,880
I think we have the same switches, right?

89
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:16,880
Yup.

90
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:17,880
Yup.

91
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:18,880
Non-sponsored.

92
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:19,880
Both of you and I paid for our keyboards.

93
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:20,880
Yes.

94
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:21,880
Much to my chagrin.

95
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:24,640
Wouldn't that be great getting free keyboards.

96
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:28,480
But nope, we bought them and we, you know, we paid for them with our own hard earned

97
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,800
dollars and we just really liked them.

98
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,400
And God, it's pretty cool.

99
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:36,680
And so I, here it is and you know, cause I feel like a keyboard like this, you know,

100
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:39,840
your first impressions after a week, that's one thing.

101
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:43,960
But then, you know, going into using it for a couple of weeks and then longterm, that's

102
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:44,960
really what's going to matter.

103
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:49,080
So I'll check back in after a few months have passed or maybe just from time to time, we'll

104
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:54,800
check back in because it's also part of that longevity that's, it's going to really matter.

105
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:58,080
Before we go too far into the show, I want to mention that our friends over at a Cloud

106
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:03,160
Guru have a free course on Podman containers this month.

107
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:08,080
Now Podman is an alternative to Docker that's getting a lot more adoption.

108
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,320
It's a OCI container standard now.

109
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:13,800
And why not take this time to learn about Podman?

110
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:18,620
It gets a lot of buzz and it offers a lot of benefits like no demon required to actually

111
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:19,880
run Podman.

112
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:24,800
So ACG has hands-on with Podman containers on Linux free for the month of June.

113
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:29,180
And in that course you'll learn what containers are and how to use them, how to manage containers

114
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:33,400
and specifically how to manage them using Podman, Podman's tools, how it interacts with

115
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:38,300
Kubernetes and system D and how to manage a lot of them in cockpit, which is a graphical

116
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:41,760
front end, a web-based graphical front end.

117
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:44,380
That which is extremely handy to manage your Podman containers.

118
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:45,820
So we'll have a link in the show notes.

119
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:50,240
The URL is kind of long, but you could also just search for hands-on with Podman containers.

120
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:54,240
And that can be a great way to get started with not just containers in general, but the

121
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,520
up and coming kind of like Docker alternative really.

122
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:57,920
That's pretty nice.

123
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:00,280
So Podman is something I suggest you check out.

124
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:03,280
We'll have a link to that in the show notes, but in the meantime, let's get to our email

125
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,640
emails.

126
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:10,080
Listener Alex wrote in to scare the out of me all over again.

127
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:14,320
He writes, Hey guys, a few episodes ago, I think you and Chris were lamenting all of

128
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:19,560
the existential attacks on the Linux desktop for programmers and power users out there.

129
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:23,220
I know you and Mike can both appreciate a good CLI tool and being able to automate tasks

130
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:26,720
via bash and other scripting methods, even the ability to audit or trust code that you

131
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,420
compile yourself.

132
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:32,800
And this is the moment reading this email, Mike, that I thought this is the moment he's

133
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:36,000
going to talk about why Linux is great because of bash and scripting.

134
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,560
Like I was getting myself all built up for like a pro Linux email.

135
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:42,360
I liked that he set you up for a fall.

136
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,520
He really did.

137
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:48,480
He says, I, like Mike, really can't be bothered to get into the weeds of my computing devices

138
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,000
anymore.

139
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:55,740
Referencing the busy dad thing from last week, since I wrote in a while about a while ago

140
00:06:55,740 --> 00:07:00,200
about my 2020 MacBook Pro all decked out with 32 gigs of RAM.

141
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:04,640
Well, it's been a little while and now I have to say I'm super impressed with how this Intel

142
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:05,700
Mac has performed.

143
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:09,920
Even running Docker, Firefox, Google Hangouts, all of it at the same time, it doesn't really

144
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:10,920
get that warm.

145
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:14,960
I mean, yeah, it gets a little warm, but the fans seem to manage it just fine and don't

146
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:15,960
scream at me.

147
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:16,960
I love the build quality.

148
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:20,560
The keyboard's great now and the display is fantastic.

149
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:23,320
The disc is screaming fast, et cetera, et cetera.

150
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:25,360
And honestly, Mac OS mostly stays out of the way.

151
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,680
It looks nice and I like how most things are integrated.

152
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:32,040
I spend most of my day in Slack with a browser open, usually on full screen on another monitor

153
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:35,520
and then Vim open on my main monitor in my terminal in front of me.

154
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:39,840
I use brew to install the GNU core utilities, which I use all the flags I learned from my

155
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:44,800
Linux day with GNU user land, mostly installed the terminal, a browser and a really high

156
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,400
end laptop with an amazing trackpad and keyboard.

157
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:52,120
I really don't see any reason to run Linux on the desktop.

158
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:55,800
I love, love the show and I'm, I'm glad to be a supporter, so keep up the amazing work

159
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:59,640
and let's do another round of robes just to troll Mike.

160
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:03,560
Now he's what he's touched on here doesn't, he didn't even bring up the M one performance

161
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:05,200
and the battery life.

162
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:10,280
What he's touched on here, uh, I think is a core concern that I have had that I kind

163
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:15,320
of started to sort of swallow and put away, but it really does bubble that.

164
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:19,960
And I think what, what, and if I'm being completely honest with you, why it bothers me is I have

165
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:25,480
been on, on this quest to get Linux desktop adopted and then just to adopt Linux desktop

166
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:28,440
myself for nearly 20 years.

167
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:33,960
And we are, we are so closer than ever with laptop vendors getting on board and all of

168
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:37,980
that, that it just kills me.

169
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:44,440
It kills me deeply from like a personal quest standpoint to see all of this momentum being

170
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,440
lost.

171
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:48,880
And I can't really dispute anything that Alex says in his email.

172
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:53,060
No, I mean, as he points out, I obviously agree with him, right?

173
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:57,040
When I read his email, the thing that jumped out to me was the same thing, like, wow, there

174
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:00,760
really was momentum and definitely seems to have been blunted quite a bit.

175
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:06,600
And I think, you know, I've been guilty of this too, but the M one is not the answer.

176
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,600
It's not the number 42, right?

177
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,160
It's not the answer to life, reality and happiness.

178
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:15,660
Um, although it is certainly substantial because this has been going on for a bit.

179
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:22,960
So I'll tell you mine, but where do you, when do you think desktop Linux kind of fumbled

180
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:23,960
the ball a little bit?

181
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:28,160
I'm not saying it's over, whatever, but for me it was the Wayland transition.

182
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,160
Really?

183
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:35,240
Because I remember I was more, much more into it back then and it just seemed like so much

184
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:39,000
energy was going into what was effectively a pissing contest.

185
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,560
And I kind of feel like it didn't get anywhere.

186
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:47,800
Maybe that's wrong, maybe that's my perceptions being like, whatever, I'm yeah, it's a, it's

187
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:50,560
a, I agree that it's a, it's still, it's still rolling out.

188
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:53,160
It's a very slow, it's a much different transition.

189
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:58,320
You know, when, when Mac OS transitioned to a desktop compositor that uses metal, they

190
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,640
did it in a single release.

191
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:04,280
Linux is literally going to take a decade to transition to Wayland, but it is, it is

192
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:05,280
almost done.

193
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:10,680
I can't really tell you which one's better or worse, honestly, but, um, I kind of am

194
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:14,600
of the opinion that it hasn't fully happened yet.

195
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:19,360
Which is why I think I'm still kind of in crisis mode and not morning mode.

196
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:22,440
I think that it's happening right now.

197
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:31,260
I think we are in 2021 and 2020 is this momentum just hit a wall moment where I think a couple

198
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:34,440
of things are coming together.

199
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:41,840
For one, a lot of us who started using Linux in the nineties and in the early aughts are

200
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:47,720
just getting older and have more complex lives with more priorities.

201
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:52,880
And when those priorities are like other small humans that depend on you, that, that kind

202
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:57,800
of stuff just transcends what can give about the computer stuff.

203
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:00,400
It just, it transcends any of that kind of thing.

204
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:05,760
And so people's priorities, large groups of people who were the original must adopt Linux

205
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:10,080
crew, I think a lot of their priorities have shifted.

206
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:16,520
And then I think on top of that, you have this onslaught of everyone kind of moving

207
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:24,960
over to mobile, even, even really high end techie geeks do a lot more today on mobile

208
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,000
than they ever did.

209
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:31,620
And absolutely a bunch of average users who can now even just completely askew having

210
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:36,040
a laptop or a computer and do everything on their phone, all of this adoption of using

211
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:41,340
mobile for notes and your information and your pictures, I think it pushes people towards

212
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:45,080
a platform that inherently works better with those devices.

213
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:48,680
You know, it's really nice that if you take a note on your phone as an average user or

214
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:53,000
even just somebody who doesn't want to have to fuss with sync thing or next cloud, it's

215
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:57,200
really nice to take a note on your phone and have that note sync to your desktop.

216
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:01,840
And that times a hundred of those little tiny features I think has created this natural

217
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:05,500
slide towards these desktops again.

218
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:08,960
And then you combine that with the kind of people's priorities changing and you combine

219
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:14,780
that now with the M1 that comes in and says, Oh, also during this horrible chip shortage

220
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:20,080
where you can't even buy a fricking GPU for your 10th gen Intel desktop.

221
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:24,180
And in my case, a seventh gen Intel desktop, like I can't even like do the old PC thing

222
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:27,600
where I could update a few components and at least extend the life like I can't even

223
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:28,720
do that anymore.

224
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:32,900
And Apple comes along with their platform that says, here's the performance.

225
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:36,840
By the way, if you look at the leaks, we're talking 40 core CPUs and just like our next

226
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:37,840
iteration.

227
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:41,000
And you look at that performance story, you look at that transition, you look at that

228
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
battery life.

229
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:48,200
And I think those three pillars of what I define as a wall have come together and Linux

230
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:50,520
desktop momentum is smacking into it.

231
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:54,360
So you mentioned the whole like dad aspect of things.

232
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:59,800
Is there some possibility that we are over reading something because of our age relative

233
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:04,380
to like where we were when we were deep, deep into it?

234
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:06,740
And it probably applies more to me, but think about it.

235
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:10,640
The people we mostly spend time with talk to online, you know, look forward to seeing

236
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:16,500
a convention, stuff like that or in, I mean, I can't speak for you, but at least the ones

237
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:22,280
I deal with, you know, more regularly are kind of in a similar place as I am, right?

238
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:27,800
Their parents, they're a little older or they're kind of like, you know, they're just not recompiling

239
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:30,640
their desktop environment, right?

240
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:35,240
They're not writing at a good home extension and they want to change their goddamn background.

241
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:37,800
I think what it might be is a little bit of both.

242
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:42,780
Yes, it's where we're sitting at now, we're seeing it different because of our experiences,

243
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:48,620
but also I think we are open to another way of seeing a same old problem all of a sudden.

244
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:52,620
Like we're now seeing it with a different perspective and realizing there's more people

245
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:56,100
on this side of the line than it initially seemed.

246
00:13:56,100 --> 00:14:01,440
But I will say it really does depend on your perspective because like, um, he calls himself

247
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:06,520
X Apple user, Mike, he wrote in again and he said, uh, as a dad of two little ones,

248
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:12,040
the way I look at it, cause he runs a SAS company during the day, uh, I don't have the

249
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:16,580
time or energy to have a computer that I can't fix myself, right?

250
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:17,800
He flips it around in his head.

251
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:21,580
He says to me, to me, I don't have time to go down to the damn Apple store that's two

252
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:24,120
hours away and then give them my computer for four days.

253
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,480
I need to be able to fix it today.

254
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:29,160
And if they spill something in there or they break something, I got to fix it.

255
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:32,600
What kind of moron would spill things in a $2,000 laptop?

256
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:33,600
Oh wait.

257
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,560
I mean, I totally agree with him.

258
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:41,800
Like for me, it's, it is, it's like, you got to plan the day you're going to go down into,

259
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:44,840
into the mall to, to go to the Apple store because it's quite a ways.

260
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:48,720
Um, or like if it's another vendor, I got to mail them the laptop.

261
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:53,800
So he says the power of being able to repair his own machine means that it's not really

262
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:58,500
about hackers and tweaking it and overclocking it and making it totally elite.

263
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:04,140
It's just about not having enough time and energy to depend on these other groups to

264
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:06,920
fix it when you could just fix it yourself quickly.

265
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:09,280
If you know what you're doing and you have a couple of spare parts.

266
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:11,920
Um, he says, I won't buy a computer.

267
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:17,080
I can't open up and rescue if I need to, I'm going to, I'm going to make that as he says,

268
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:21,160
it's his goal as long as humanly possible, which means the M one will never sit on his

269
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:23,540
desk despite all its glory.

270
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:27,860
And I think it's just two compromises because I think what your answer would be if I were

271
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:32,660
to speak for you for a moment is if you couldn't repair that Mac book and it was going to take

272
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:37,780
them five days to repair it, you'd buy another Mac book and either return it once they repaired

273
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:43,280
it or you within give the repaired one to a staffer and keep the new Mac book for yourself

274
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:44,280
and problem solved.

275
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:46,600
Well, I've only done that like a million times, right?

276
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:47,600
Yeah.

277
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:51,000
So you just have a totally, it's a, it's a different way of solving problems.

278
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,800
And it's one that Apple loves you're, you're a great customer that way.

279
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:58,480
Listen, the genius bar is really a sales opportunity for them when I'm there.

280
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,200
So yeah, yeah, really.

281
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:04,680
Um, but I totally, I totally connect with that perspective as well.

282
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:08,000
Um, don't like talking about this topic anymore.

283
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
I got to be honest.

284
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,400
I mean, I want people to keep writing it and sharing their thoughts because as somebody

285
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:16,480
who has to comment on this stuff, this show helps give me different perspective and I

286
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:17,520
totally appreciate that.

287
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:21,600
So coder.show slash contact at the same time, I have a little mini crisis.

288
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:24,000
Jordan writes in with something I can solve.

289
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,320
He says, as a fellow RVer, I've been wondering what you're using for internet.

290
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:36,160
I'm using a mobile hotspot, um, with a contract I got through the family motorhome association,

291
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:41,080
but since the T-Mobile merger has happened, my speeds have dropped to almost unusable.

292
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:46,280
I wanted to follow up because I have talked about trying to get work grade internet on

293
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:47,280
the road.

294
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:50,160
And I know that's something that some of our listeners are trying to do, you know, trying

295
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:54,140
to do, um, some sort of remote work and you want, or maybe not remote learning and you

296
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:55,360
want something really solid.

297
00:16:55,360 --> 00:17:02,240
So I thought I'd do, um, about a six month followup to this system that I have gone with.

298
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:04,120
And I'm not saying this is for everybody.

299
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:09,600
I think the system I'm about to tell you is it's for people who like to mess with computers

300
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:16,360
and you want your connection to be very solid, industrial grade, you know, like something

301
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:23,040
that could support many family members that could support remote video sessions that is

302
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:25,760
going to be a little bit of a premium setup.

303
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:29,400
I went with a bundle that I'll have linked in the show notes from an online site called

304
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:32,680
mobile must have, and it's their ultimate road warrior bundle.

305
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:43,320
And it's a external antenna with an internal router that has four SIM slots and is crazy

306
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:49,200
fast, crazy fast, way more robust than any MiFi has ever been built.

307
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:55,440
And it has ethernet ports and it can be DC powered and the antenna is external.

308
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,560
It is a really great antenna.

309
00:17:57,560 --> 00:18:02,360
It is a cat 12 cellular antenna with seven different antennas in there.

310
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:07,180
It can do multiple connections, MIMO connections to the tower.

311
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:13,520
So you can have multiple data pipes to towers when they're nearby and all of it comes together

312
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,320
to offer really solid internet.

313
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:19,280
And then you pop a couple of SIM cards or one SIM card, whatever you're comfortable

314
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:20,720
with, into the router.

315
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:21,720
The router is a pet wave.

316
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:25,320
I have the max transit duo and it's incredible.

317
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:29,580
It's the kind of thing they put in buses and trains to provide internet when going down

318
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:31,140
the tracks.

319
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:34,200
And so it can support, you know, 200, 300 people.

320
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:36,260
I'm just using it with my family.

321
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:41,120
And I have in there, I have a Verizon SIM and an AT&T SIM.

322
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:45,600
And then I have a backup Ting SIM and Google Fi SIM.

323
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:49,040
The Ting SIM and the Google Fi SIM are my backup SIMs because they're charged based

324
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:50,040
on usage.

325
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:51,140
And it works really well.

326
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:52,140
It works very well.

327
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:53,140
It was expensive.

328
00:18:53,140 --> 00:19:00,520
It was $1,200 to get it all done, but it is a bulletproof remote wireless setup.

329
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:03,400
So if you're in a rig, you're going about, you want really solid internet, you want to

330
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:04,920
be able to do video calls.

331
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:09,280
Mike and I have recorded the show over it multiple times and it works really solid.

332
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:12,520
It's going to depend on your signal overall, but you can totally do it.

333
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:17,280
So I'll put, I'll put a link to the bundle I got and I'll put a link to a mobile internet

334
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:21,880
resource center article on picking different data plans because man, is that a pain in

335
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:22,880
the ass.

336
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:23,880
That is the worst part.

337
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:26,200
It is really bad out there.

338
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,200
Carriers are the worst.

339
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:31,240
And then these, these, these third parties that resell the data packages are so fly by

340
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:32,240
night.

341
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,240
It's so bad.

342
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,240
Ugh.

343
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,240
Oh yeah.

344
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:36,240
Don't even get me.

345
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,480
Oh, I won't, I won't.

346
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:44,440
But I do want to talk about stripe identity, but first lino.com slash coder.

347
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:49,480
Go there and check out Linode and get $100 in credit for 60 days on a new account.

348
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:50,980
And you support the show.

349
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:55,920
We got a note into the show today from somebody who tried Linode compared to AWS, just the

350
00:19:55,920 --> 00:20:00,640
$5 Linode too, 100% this came in just today.

351
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:04,360
They tried out Linode and compared it to their AWS set up.

352
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:11,780
And Linode was clearly, clearly faster and Linode is often 30 to 50% cheaper than AWS.

353
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:18,040
They are the world's largest independent cloud provider and their systems are screaming fast.

354
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:22,640
They have 11 data centers around the world, super fast SSDs on each one of them.

355
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:27,080
They're dedicated CPU rigs have AMD epic processors that are total screamers.

356
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:32,560
They really dominate and it's all managed with a very simple cloud dashboard.

357
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:36,580
If you're a total noob and you're really just building something so that way you can deploy

358
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:39,460
and run your application, they're going to get you through that.

359
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:43,360
But if you really know what you're doing, that simple interface doesn't mean it's limited.

360
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:44,900
You get access to the power features.

361
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:48,760
You can deploy your own rig and build it from the ground up, or you can just do the one

362
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:49,900
click deployment.

363
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:52,080
And that's something I just messed with recently.

364
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:58,160
I was building a quick file transfer box for friends of the show, I'll just say friends

365
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:01,200
of the show who are putting on an online event and we're helping them do some of the management

366
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,200
for it.

367
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:06,400
I'm using Linode in the process to help with the streaming and to help with the file storage.

368
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:11,240
I spun up a Debian Linode using their one click Docker deployment.

369
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:15,480
And then the idea is it's Debian 10 with Docker with the right sources that we're getting

370
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:17,920
the current versions and tools and all that kind of stuff.

371
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:21,520
I got that deployed and I had the application installed in just minutes and they were up

372
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:22,520
and using it.

373
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:27,400
Actually, not even kidding, it just took longer for my DNS provider to update the DNS and it

374
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:31,760
took me to get the whole stack up and running and the link set off to the guys to start

375
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:32,960
using it.

376
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:36,520
That's the magic of using Linode and I deployed it to their Texas data center because it's

377
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:38,440
nice and centralized.

378
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:41,440
But like I said earlier, you got 11 data centers to choose from.

379
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:44,520
And then one of the things that I do, which is like my little hack for all of our things

380
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:50,840
we have deployed now, whenever I can, I use Linode's S3 object storage as my backend storage.

381
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:56,960
I'll do a small economical disk on my Linode and then anything that's just kind of growing

382
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:03,320
exponentially like next cloud or matrix storage or this new file repository I set up for them,

383
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:06,120
that I use Linode's S3 compatible object storage.

384
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:09,880
I just put that all on object storage and grow it as I need it and trim it as I need

385
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:10,880
to.

386
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:14,320
Linode provides virtual servers that make it easy and affordable for you to host anything

387
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:15,400
in the cloud.

388
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:19,600
If you're a gamer, a developer, or maybe somebody who just wants to learn, they've got something

389
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:20,600
for you.

390
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:27,440
You can get $100 and support the show when you go to linode.com slash coder.

391
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:33,560
Stripe made news with Stripe Identity, a self-serve tool that companies can use to verify customers

392
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:35,880
and users identities with Stripe.

393
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:41,120
Stripe manages the data storage in an encrypted format and they say they use computer vision

394
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:46,760
and machine learning to read and match up government IDs with live selfies.

395
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:50,840
And they say for the end user, like the developer that's deploying it, the entire thing can

396
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:54,520
work in as little as 15 seconds.

397
00:22:54,520 --> 00:23:00,640
The service is launching this week in beta and in 30 countries eventually.

398
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,560
No word on the cost.

399
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:08,620
It will be charged per transaction, but Stripe is not talking about those fees at this moment.

400
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:10,640
What do you think of Stripe Identity?

401
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:14,560
You know, it's interesting how efficient it is.

402
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:19,880
Although I'm not sure I would ever want to, as a user, have this in an app I use.

403
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:21,520
So I did some digging.

404
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:25,880
The third party developer will get access to the actual images you're sending.

405
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:29,960
So it's not just like Stripe does like, you know, like they do with the credit card chargers

406
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:32,620
where it's just like an up or down approved.

407
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:38,580
This is, they get it and they get the like the picture of your driver's license or whatever.

408
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:43,080
That makes me a little not a fan of that.

409
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:44,080
Not a fan of that.

410
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:45,080
No, I guess.

411
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:52,200
Well, I guess the alternative would be, you know, let's say it's for sake of argument,

412
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:55,160
it's like a crypto exchange, because I know, you know, when you buy Coinbase, they make

413
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:57,320
you verify your identity and that kind of stuff.

414
00:23:57,320 --> 00:24:01,760
Would you rather that each one of these crypto exchanges rolls their own identity management

415
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:06,240
system because they have to get your identity to follow the federal laws?

416
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,240
The banking laws.

417
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:08,240
Yeah.

418
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,240
Yeah.

419
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:11,480
See, I guess that's what it is, right?

420
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:15,000
I rather Stripe.

421
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,200
I guess you're right.

422
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:21,440
I trust Stripe more than I trust random crypto, you know, contractor building some website

423
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:22,440
somewhere.

424
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:23,440
Yes.

425
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:24,440
It's not ideal.

426
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:25,440
No.

427
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:30,160
What's wild, right, is because Stripe is sort of their brand is built on protecting the

428
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:31,560
credit card information.

429
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:35,560
Like the developer or the end user of the Stripe API, they never see the credit card

430
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:36,560
info.

431
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:38,800
They don't have to worry about PCI level compliance.

432
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:40,840
Like Stripe manages all of that.

433
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:43,880
And so, like, you can't get the info out of Stripe as a developer.

434
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:46,840
But with this, you can.

435
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:50,200
And it's boy, that just doesn't seem right.

436
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:54,280
And I guess Stripe is so they're going to put limitations on what the secret key can

437
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:55,600
get access to.

438
00:24:55,600 --> 00:25:01,620
But even then, in that scenario, it's dependent on the developer using the API to determine

439
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:02,960
how much they store.

440
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:07,560
Like they still just decide, well, we won't pull the information, even though we could.

441
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:09,240
Like, that's not really much of a fix.

442
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:10,240
Well, right.

443
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:13,320
And now it becomes, well, what if the developers, like, key got out?

444
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:18,800
Does that mean any user whose ID is in this Stripe system, a malicious attacker could

445
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:24,040
in theory just, like, make the API calls pretending to be the developer and get all their information?

446
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:25,040
Yeah.

447
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:28,320
I mean, it sounds like possibly, indeed.

448
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,320
But still.

449
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:32,560
Still better than them implementing their own app with some sort of SQL back end that

450
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:33,560
you'd-

451
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:34,560
Absolutely.

452
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:35,560
Yeah.

453
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:36,840
And putting everything in an S3 bucket that's set to public.

454
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:41,240
But again, nothing stops them from using this and then still putting everything in an S3

455
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:42,240
bucket.

456
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,240
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

457
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:46,760
Well, and I've seen it argued potentially that due to the compliance issues, like if

458
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:51,620
the feds ever came knocking on, say, like this Coinbase alternative, they themselves

459
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:54,080
are supposed to have a copy of the IDs.

460
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:55,920
So it could be some compliance thing there.

461
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:57,200
But I don't know.

462
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,080
Maybe we'll see some evolution on this.

463
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:00,240
Stripe does seem to be listening.

464
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:04,260
Like they're in the hacker news comments, people that are all fired up about this.

465
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:09,200
From a tech standpoint, though, interesting that they're using computer vision and machine

466
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,780
learning to take a selfie.

467
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:12,780
You take a selfie.

468
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:16,860
That's how it works on this app is you take a selfie and then their back end matches it

469
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:22,080
to government IDs based on the metrics that they can pull, the biometrics they can pull

470
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,160
from points on your face.

471
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:25,160
From the images.

472
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:26,160
Yeah.

473
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:27,160
That's impressive.

474
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:28,160
That's pretty wild.

475
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:34,000
They have a decent demo of it on their website that kind of shows you how it works with animation.

476
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
I am impressed by that.

477
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:41,520
And I looked into kind of try to get a sense of what else was happening in this space.

478
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:46,220
And it kind of seems like it's a bit of a crap show.

479
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:51,040
There's several small startups that are trying to offer stuff like this.

480
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:55,000
There's some banks that are promising like pie in the sky blockchain solutions, but they

481
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:58,000
actually haven't delivered anything.

482
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,600
And then there's a bunch of people rolling their own solutions for ID verification.

483
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:06,400
And it just seems like it was just this huge market potential that's just been sitting

484
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:14,120
there that Stripe is very obviously well positioned to grab and start offering identity services.

485
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:17,840
There's going to be just even more uses for that online for better or for worse over the

486
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,120
years.

487
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:23,880
And one more thing that sure would be nice if Apple let you use Stripe in your app payment

488
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:24,880
process.

489
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:29,700
Maybe you'll have to use Apple payment for the payment processing and then Stripe identity

490
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:31,600
for the identity management part of it.

491
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:32,600
It's just going to be a mess.

492
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:35,080
Oh, you know, I wonder if Apple would allow that at all.

493
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:36,080
I know.

494
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:37,080
I know.

495
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:44,160
Yeah, it's it's it does make you wonder because this is Stripe is this is all they do, right?

496
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:49,200
They're wholly focused on these kinds of things where payment in the app store is.

497
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:53,360
Well, the app store is, you know, what is it like a 10, 11 billion dollar business?

498
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:55,040
It's like a side hustle for Apple.

499
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:57,120
And it's just not their core focus.

500
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:01,840
I suppose with Apple Pay, maybe a bit more could be underselling it a bit.

501
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:03,560
But I just Stripe just they're hungry for it.

502
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:07,000
I guess I think I think I actually ultimately like this.

503
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,960
It's better than all the crap alternatives.

504
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:15,320
That's just the pure pragmatism of it is where I come down on it is that I like it better

505
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:17,800
than anything else that's out there right now.

506
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:21,960
And Stripe seems like a company well positioned to pull it off the user convenience.

507
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:27,100
The user experience of going going through and verifying your identity has been such

508
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:31,680
a crappy experience where you're trying to take a horrible picture of your driver's license

509
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:33,920
here in the States or whatever, and there's a reflection on it.

510
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:34,920
It can't get it quite right.

511
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:36,840
And so you get denied just because of that.

512
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:38,660
And it's extremely frustrating.

513
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:42,840
And they're offering something that everybody knows how to take a selfie.

514
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:45,480
It's built on a brand that people already trust.

515
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:49,520
And they've already got customers like Discord that are actively using it for their verified

516
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:51,040
bot program today.

517
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:55,580
So it's going to be it's in beta and it's by the time you're using their embed code

518
00:28:55,580 --> 00:29:00,000
to build this into your project, this is going to be pretty well tested.

519
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,080
You know, that might be the ultimate thing about it is that it's going to be so frickin

520
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:06,600
simple now for developers to use this that it's just going to get an option.

521
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:10,520
You're just going to drop it in your app and it's good to go.

522
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:14,160
I mean, even, you know, JB has a Stripe account for like some of our garage sale stuff.

523
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:16,000
It's just Stripe is just so universal now.

524
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,600
Oh, yeah, no, we have a Stripe account, too.

525
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:21,840
I mean, I think everybody does at this point.

526
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:24,080
Datadog.com slash Coderadio.

Datadogs at datadog.com slash Coderadio.

557
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:11,400
So a couple of just really basic things that we learned after WWDC.

558
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:16,680
Number one is Mac OS 12 is getting serious virtualization.

559
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:24,200
Apple has been slow cooking a fork of FreeBSD's Beehive for a while and now they're adding

560
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:25,480
Vert IO support.

561
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:33,520
Now Vert IO support means this is a legitimate VM solution that perhaps could tie in hardware

562
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:40,960
devices like eGPUs, physical disks, network cards that can be allocated to your virtual

563
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,480
machines.

564
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:47,160
And the virtualization framework in Mac OS 12 is also getting a DFU mode for dealing

565
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:52,920
with Apple Silicon Macs as guests, importing USB devices directly to the guest system and

566
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:54,520
a bunch of other stuff.

567
00:31:54,520 --> 00:32:01,820
So virtualization in Mac OS 12 is going to be nearly on par with virtualization on a

568
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:02,820
Linux desktop.

569
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:07,200
I think KVM and the Linux desktop still has it built or still has it beat I should say.

570
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:13,480
But in terms of raw functionality, Mac OS 12 is going to be more on par now.

571
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:18,000
And they may even put it over the top if some great front ends like something from Parallels

572
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,120
or VMware gets built on top of that.

573
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:25,920
But as of right now, this is all just framework stuff that isn't necessarily exposed via anything

574
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:26,920
in the Mac OS UI.

575
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:30,680
So it's there, but I don't know if you're going to use it.

576
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:33,080
I wouldn't be surprised if Parallels adopts this pretty quickly, right?

577
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:39,480
I mean, this is a pretty common use case, virtualizing Windows, virtualizing other systems.

578
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:44,520
I virtualize Linux on my Mac, I virtualize Windows.

579
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:46,880
Anything that makes that better, I'm down for.

580
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:50,640
Yeah, especially if you can start passing through hardware devices so the VM just sees

581
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:52,720
them directly attached to them.

582
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:53,720
That's nice.

583
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:55,360
And that's the big thing that they're adding.

584
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:59,300
A couple of other just small things that I just think are noteworthy and Apple didn't

585
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:04,280
think they were worth touching on during the keynote, but I think a lot of people disagree.

586
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:08,160
That is that some of the new features that they announced just simply don't work on Intel

587
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:09,160
Macs.

588
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:14,060
So the process of, if we were wondering how long it would take Apple to kind of slowly

589
00:33:14,060 --> 00:33:19,440
abandon the Intel Macs in little steps, it begins with Mac OS 12 in a pretty significant

590
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:20,440
way.

591
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:25,620
I guess any kind of real feature that got introduced at WWDC that depends on the neural

592
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:32,120
engine in the A-series and M1-series CPUs just isn't happening on the Intel chip.

593
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:39,920
So continuous dictation, on-device Siri dictation, some features in their maps program, live

594
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:45,040
text analysis, portrait mode for FaceTime, that stuff doesn't work on the Intel Macs.

595
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:47,440
Sorry, your FaceTime calls still look like crap.

596
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:53,560
Do you see, you know, do you see like, it seems a little soon, Mike, seems a little

597
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:55,760
soon if you ask me.

598
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:59,540
Seems like they could just throw that, that stuff could, I mean, obviously what do I know?

599
00:33:59,540 --> 00:34:02,000
But there's gotta be another way to do it on CPU, right?

600
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,000
It must be.

601
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,920
Yeah, but why, why, why invest the effort?

602
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:08,320
Because they're still selling Intel machines, you know?

603
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:12,960
Yeah, but they're not going to sell them for, the people buying the big Intel machines now

604
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,840
are by our pros, right?

605
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:16,320
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

606
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:19,720
They're, and you know, they don't care about a lot of this stuff.

607
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:20,720
So.

608
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:21,720
I suppose you're right.

609
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:22,920
I think this makes sense.

610
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:23,920
Yeah.

611
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:24,920
Why invest the effort?

612
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:31,000
I just, it stinks, you know, cause some people have 2020 and 2019 edition Mac books that

613
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:35,760
just aren't going to get better FaceTime video or they're not going to get continuous dictation

614
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:38,200
and so I don't know, it's just, it sort of stinks to see it happen already.

615
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:40,920
I'm sure Apple has a solution to that.

616
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:41,920
Yeah, buy an M1.

617
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:42,920
Yeah, buy an M1.

618
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:43,920
I mean.

619
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:44,920
Yeah.

620
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:45,920
Yeah, that's true.

621
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:46,920
That's true.

622
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:49,200
Well, I suppose that could be it.

623
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:50,200
That could be.

624
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:54,120
You know, I just wanted to see, this is just an example of something that doesn't happen

625
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:57,400
over here in Linux land, you know, these, of course we don't have these features to

626
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:58,400
begin with.

627
00:34:58,400 --> 00:34:59,400
There's that.

628
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:04,560
So, you know, and somebody pointed out on Twitter, it's like, well, what would you have

629
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:05,560
them do?

630
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:09,320
Would you have them just not include these features on the M1 Macs?

631
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:13,720
Because the Intel Macs can't do it, like they're inheriting this stuff because they've done

632
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:18,320
the leg, the heavy lifting, all the legwork on the iOS side and now the Mac just gets

633
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:22,040
to take advantage of it because it has the APIs and it has the chips.

634
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:26,440
But what should they just disable it because the Intel Macs can't do it?

635
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:27,760
That doesn't make sense either, I guess.

636
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:28,760
Yeah, no.

637
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:30,840
But you know what you can have on your Linux desktop?

638
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:32,280
Oh, I do know.

639
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:33,280
Tell me.

640
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:34,800
Clippy and Visual Studio.

641
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:40,600
A Visual Studio code, that is, I think, but yeah.

642
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:41,600
Of course.

643
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:42,600
Yeah.

644
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:48,640
A Visual Studio code now with Clippy, it will show you your mistakes in real time.

645
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:53,600
And I mean, I don't know really, I don't really know how development won't change forever

646
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:54,600
with this.

647
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:57,200
Finally, the guiding hand of Clippy in VS Code.

648
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:58,200
That's great.

649
00:35:58,200 --> 00:35:59,200
That's great.

650
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:00,200
So I assume you installed this.

651
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:01,200
Of course.

652
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,720
It's amazing.

653
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:07,960
I actually I was reading because I don't know why actually, I don't actually know what my

654
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:13,120
excuse is, but I was reading their issue tracker for this here app.

655
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:17,240
And I guess it cuts off some of the last like letter of advice that it gives you.

656
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:22,760
So not only is it obnoxious in the way that Clippy always was, but now it also doesn't

657
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:28,180
give you complete advice, which is like salt in the wound and somehow perfect.

658
00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:32,600
It just mocks you as you're coding, which I'm here for.

659
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:37,920
And it takes up an enormous, enormous amount of screen real estate, too, as well.

660
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:39,360
Yes, it does.

661
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:44,600
And you can tell it was never really a graphic that was designed to be blown up to that size

662
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:48,360
that it takes because it's it's rough.

663
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:52,400
It's like a JPEG from the 90s that just gets blown up onto a high res screen and it just

664
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:54,400
looks real rough.

665
00:36:54,400 --> 00:37:02,600
It is honestly, I mean, the first issue, issue number one on the VSCode Clippy GitHub is

666
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:07,100
please no, that is the entire issue.

667
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:08,760
We should make one that says please yes.

668
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:12,400
Somebody in the audience go over there and encourage encourage this individual because

669
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:14,760
they're making development better.

670
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:16,000
Everybody needs Clippy.

671
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,000
You know what the problem here?

672
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,720
It's a lack of branding, right?

673
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:23,400
We need to be we need to be dropping machine learning and artificial intelligence assisted

674
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:26,520
development into the description of this thing.

675
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:29,400
And I think people would be on board with this.

676
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:32,040
I just think it's just a lack of a lack of help.

677
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:34,040
So I may fork this.

678
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:35,040
Oh, OK.

679
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:40,680
Because there is another helpful spirit that I think the Coder Radio audience would really

680
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:44,780
appreciate in their Visual Studio code sessions.

681
00:37:44,780 --> 00:37:46,640
Someone who will give you advice on your code.

682
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:47,640
Oh, yeah.

683
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:48,640
OK, sure.

684
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:49,640
Me say yeah.

685
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:52,720
Yeah, yeah, that's what we need.

686
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:53,840
Yeah, yeah.

687
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:56,800
And Disney sues me in five, four, three.

688
00:37:56,800 --> 00:38:01,780
You know, we haven't mentioned it, but notepad plus plus has recently had a big release and

689
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:04,280
Sublime Text four is out as well.

690
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:07,240
I used to be a Sublime Text user, weren't you as well?

691
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:08,240
I was.

692
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:09,240
Yeah.

693
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:14,120
Were you tempted at all to, you know, check out an old X after the release or have you

694
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:17,000
remained firm in your commitment to VSCode?

695
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:21,260
I downloaded it, but I'm so deep into VSCode now that yeah, I don't know.

696
00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:24,140
I mean, I'm using that damn Pylance plugin from Microsoft.

697
00:38:24,140 --> 00:38:25,320
That's just awesome.

698
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:26,320
You're hooked now.

699
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:27,320
I'm hooked.

700
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:28,320
Yeah, yeah.

701
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:29,320
I thought about it, too.

702
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:30,320
I thought about it.

703
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:35,320
But honestly, VSCode is doing everything I need and it's free.

704
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:37,840
Well, and the extension library is crazy.

705
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:39,120
Yeah, that too.

706
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:40,120
That too.

707
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:44,520
You know, I was just working on a Docker compose file and it's just like, hey, why don't you

708
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:46,320
install the Docker support and stuff?

709
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:47,320
And I'm like, oh, OK.

710
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:48,880
Yeah, I should do that on this box.

711
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:52,840
And I just and then everything's all all my YAML file gets all syntax highlighted all

712
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:57,680
of a sudden and everything's looking all great and it's just just so it's so quick to just

713
00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:02,400
bust through a file even on a remote server and then get right back to what I was doing.

714
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:09,640
I would I feel like I should give Sublime Text a go because I find the idea of a development

715
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:14,880
shop or a single developer making a full time living by selling a text editor kind of a

716
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:20,960
romantic notion, the idea, right, that somebody could just sort of have this this independent

717
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:25,320
gig where they work for themselves and their whole thing is they make a text editor.

718
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:26,320
Maybe it's a couple of people.

719
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:27,320
I don't know.

720
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:28,320
I don't know how it works over there.

721
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:33,280
And they make a living by selling a text editor that people pay for like software used to

722
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:34,280
work.

723
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:36,920
Like, I find that entire notion romantic, even if it's closed source.

724
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:40,060
So I'm compelled to try it out.

725
00:39:40,060 --> 00:39:43,560
And yet I just got too much going on these days.

726
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:44,560
Yeah.

727
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:47,680
I mean, I used to use an editor called Chocolate on the Mac.

728
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:48,680
Oh, yeah.

729
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:49,680
Oh, yeah.

730
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:50,680
I remember Chocolate.

731
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:51,680
Yeah.

732
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:52,680
That hasn't been updated in four thousand years.

733
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:53,680
I sort of feel like this code is murdered.

734
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:59,040
I mean, I know people will write in Sublime users and I get it.

735
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:00,040
I know.

736
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:01,040
Maybe I will try it out.

737
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:02,840
But maybe there's a space for both.

738
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:03,840
Maybe.

739
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:04,840
I'm not sure.

740
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:05,840
Oh, there's not.

741
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:06,840
No.

742
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:10,800
No, not from not from one person, if that's what you mean, because why why are you going

743
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:12,560
to flip editors all the time?

744
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:16,800
Neil is reminding me and we also had an email into the show that the Sublime folks have

745
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:20,240
a really nice get editor now.

746
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:21,240
Yeah.

747
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:22,240
Sublime Merge.

748
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:23,240
Yeah.

749
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:24,240
Sublime Merge.

750
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:25,240
Thank you.

751
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:26,240
That was we got an email into the show.

752
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:29,200
They're like, you should have these guys sponsor you because this is some really good

753
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:30,200
software.

754
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:31,200
So that's it.

755
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:32,200
Sublime Merge dot com.

756
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:33,200
I'll put a link to the show notes in that.

757
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:37,720
But our email was loving it, you know, it's good stuff.

758
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:38,720
So I will.

759
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:39,720
I'll put a link to that.

760
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:41,440
And that is, you know, it's definitely something I should check out.

761
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:44,800
I've been also debating if I should use GitHub projects or not.

762
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:49,000
So if anybody has any experience with that, I what the hell's a GitHub project?

763
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:53,120
It's like their own Trello that you can but you can track the issues back to where you

764
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:57,200
can track projects back to issues and commits, which is kind of a neat idea.

765
00:40:57,200 --> 00:41:00,720
Having like I could see like having an issues conversation around a project entry.

766
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:04,760
I kind of like it, but it also seems like a lot of extra overhead when I just need a

767
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:08,020
list of projects and be able to communicate them with people and bang them out.

768
00:41:08,020 --> 00:41:11,840
Kind of like three or four things I'm working on them like probably should put down and

769
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:13,480
start sharing with people.

770
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:15,640
But I'm just feeling a resistance to Trello.

771
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:21,820
I just don't really I feel like I've tinkered with Trello as a toy so much more than I actually

772
00:41:21,820 --> 00:41:23,840
have as a tool to use.

773
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:28,040
And I'm Wes is trying to talk me into just making a plain text list.

774
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:29,440
I'm kind of considering doing it.

775
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:32,640
No, I'm heavy Trello user, but I'm looking at this GitHub project thing.

776
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:34,880
That's pretty interesting.

777
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:35,880
It is right.

778
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:41,800
If anybody has any experiences with it or any other newer project management tools that

779
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:46,640
actually are quick to use, easy for other people to adopt and just get your ideas out

780
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:47,640
and you get going.

781
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:49,440
You don't have to futz around with it.

782
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:50,440
I'd love to know.

783
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:51,880
Coder dot show slash contact.

784
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:52,960
Let us know.

785
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:58,000
I am tempted to try out GitHub projects, but I also feel like maybe it's too much tool

786
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,000
for what I need.

787
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:02,240
Fussing about the tools again and not actually doing the work.

788
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:03,240
That doesn't sound like me.

789
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:09,440
Never, never, never, never, never, never.

790
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:11,040
Thank you to the QA team out there.

791
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:12,040
Thank you very much.

792
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:13,040
You get the Coderly report.

793
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:15,420
You support the show, which we really appreciate.

794
00:42:15,420 --> 00:42:17,520
And of course you get the limited ad feed.

795
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:19,280
Nice tight show with just less ads.

796
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:24,340
We just want to say thank you to our QA team out there and you can become a member at Coder

797
00:42:24,340 --> 00:42:26,280
QA dot co.

798
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:28,160
You can find Mr. Dominic on Twitter.

799
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:30,880
He's at Dumanoku and his company is at the Mad Botter Inc.

800
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:33,560
And Mike, is there anything else you want to mention this week?

801
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:34,560
Nope.

802
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:41,560
Just follow me on Twitter and send in your your sublime text love poetry to Coder dot

803
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:42,560
show.

804
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:47,080
Coder dot show slash contact or I think Coder at Jupiter broadcasting dot com works too.

805
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:51,040
If you just want to do it like old school email style, you know, don't have to fuzz

806
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:52,240
with the web page.

807
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:53,360
You can do that too.

808
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:55,120
I'm on the Twitters at Chris Last.

809
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:57,160
The podcast network is at Jupiter signal.

810
00:42:57,160 --> 00:43:00,240
And this here podcast is at Coder radio show.

811
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:04,120
Links to what we talked about today are at Coder dot show slash 418.

812
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:10,520
You'll also find our contact form over there, our RSS feed, our back catalog.

813
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:13,400
I don't know, probably dead links.

814
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:14,400
It's a website.

815
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:17,640
Yeah, it's probably over there.

816
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:21,320
We do the show live on Mondays, 5 p.m. Pacific, 8 p.m. Eastern, and it's a lot of fun.

817
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:23,880
We'd love to have you join us over at jblive.tv.

818
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:33,760
Thanks for being here and we'll see you next week.
