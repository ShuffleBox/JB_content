00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
This is Coder Radio, episode 367, for July 22, 2019.

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Hello, everybody, and welcome to Coder Radio,

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show that takes a pragmatic look at the art and business,

4
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
software development, and related technologies.

5
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:50,000
My name is Wes, and I'm very pleased to be joined by the one, the only, Mr. Michael Dominic.

6
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Welcome to the show, Mike.

7
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Hello, hello, Wes. How have you been?

8
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Oh, my, I'm doing great. You know, it's going to be somewhere in the 80s today out here in the Pacific Northwest,

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
and that makes most people freak out, but there's been a heat wave in the U.S.,

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
so we're all sitting pretty cool over here.

11
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
How are you doing over in the swamplands of Florida?

12
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I am good. I actually just got back from a trip.

13
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I've been traveling since 4 a.m., so it's great. It's great.

14
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
But, yeah, I am back in the swamp where I belong.

15
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
That says everything I need to know about you, Mr. Dominic,

16
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
because you showed up here nevertheless, and I think we've all been there.

17
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
We know how terrible travel can be.

18
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Yes.

19
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
That doesn't stop you, though.

20
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
So, an example of that, last week we had an episode that we pre-recorded,

21
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
which I enjoyed a lot, called The Functional First, and that was you helping me out.

22
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I was traveling. You accommodated me.

23
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
So, the theme here, Mike's great. The show goes on.

24
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
You can find it all at coder.show.

25
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
You can subscribe, follow the RSS, and it'll always be delivered right to you.

26
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Speaking of Functional First, we got some feedback on that episode over at our subreddit.

27
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Yes, there's a subreddit, coderradio.reddit.com is how you find it.

28
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Friend of the show Tyler writes in,

29
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
This was my favorite episode in a long time.

30
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Well, thank you, Tyler.

31
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:16,000
As a C++ developer working on a large, primarily object-oriented code base,

32
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I've been writing ever more C++ as just a pipeline of data transformations.

33
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,000
As you guys mentioned, you can get a lot of benefit, even in an OO situation,

34
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,000
from wrapping a functional core, so to speak, up in an object package.

35
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Tyler goes further and actually recommends two talks that really changed the way he thought about some of this stuff,

36
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:42,000
and the first one is one I've seen and really love and should have linked in the last episode,

37
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
so you'll find it in the show notes for this episode,

38
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:49,000
and that's Gary Bernhardt's talk, Functional Core Imperative Shell.

39
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
And I think that's, I mean, that's just a great name, and it kind of describes a lot of the idea.

40
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Yes, you have to have side effects. Yes, you have to do imperative mutable stuff.

41
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:03,000
But that can all live at the edges, and you can have a core of nicely defined peer functions,

42
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:08,000
and that talk goes a long way to explaining all that stuff I was rambling on about last week.

43
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
If you're interested in C++ stuff, he also recommends one more link,

44
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
which is Postmodern Immutable Data Structures,

45
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
which talks about how some of this stuff works in the C++ world.

46
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Yeah, I think one of the key things, the key takeaways we were trying to get through to people was,

47
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,000
in terms of dipping into functional programming, you don't have to drink the Kool-Aid

48
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,000
and go full Haskell or F-sharp or Clojure or whatever.

49
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:38,000
You can take some of the concepts and the methodologies, or the strategies rather,

50
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,000
and implement them and use them in, again, in this case, C++, right?

51
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Yeah, and I really appreciate your inputs on that episode for that reason,

52
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:52,000
because I get to use some languages, I choose to use languages when I can

53
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
that make it a little easier to be functional first,

54
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:02,000
but you're actually selling software to real people who don't care about the technical details, right?

55
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
They just want a product from you that works, and you just got to make it happen

56
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
in whatever language it already exists.

57
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Yeah, they don't really care about it at all, to be honest with you.

58
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
All right, well, if you guys want to send us feedback like Tyler did,

59
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
and we would love that, we always appreciate feedback at the Coder Radio program.

60
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,000
We don't always have time to read all of it on air, but we do read all of it.

61
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
We take your links, your suggestions, your criticisms all to heart.

62
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Coder.show.com is the easiest way to get in touch.

63
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Now, of course, you can also find us on Twitter, and, well, I follow you, Mike.

64
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
That's my admission for the day.

65
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I noticed you tweeting about something I didn't really expect,

66
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
and I'm sorry if that's a judgment call that is maybe misplaced,

67
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
but you were tweeting about Emacs the other day.

68
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Yes, I was.

69
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:58,000
So little known fun fact, my first editor I used professionally was, in fact, Emacs,

70
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
or I should say, yeah, semi-professionally.

71
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:06,000
And then I got a job, and the guy was, let's just say,

72
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:12,000
not neutral on the VIM Emacs war in favor of VIM, and literally did not allow Emacs.

73
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Like, not at all, just not even to enter the building.

74
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
If you worked, if you were on the team, you used VIM.

75
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Wow, that's, you know, obviously I've seen things like that

76
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
for more complete development environments.

77
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
You know, if it's like, okay, well, we all use IntelliJ on the team,

78
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
and we've configured our environment, and we keep all the stuff in source control.

79
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I get that, and I mean, that could work for VIM, too, but it's a little unusual.

80
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Yeah, it's interesting.

81
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,000
So I've been kind of looking at Emacs again just to say, like, you know,

82
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
it's always been just an itch I've wanted to scratch.

83
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
And you actually sent me a link to something called SpaceMax,

84
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
which is pretty interesting.

85
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Can you go into a little bit of what is this versus, let's say,

86
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,000
proper good new Emacs, or maybe vanilla good new Emacs is more fair?

87
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Well, if you weren't lucky enough to kind of grow up with Emacs

88
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,000
and experience learning how to use it, how to write a little bit of Elisp,

89
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:10,000
how to configure things, well, it's pretty foreign as an environment in 2019,

90
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
especially if you're coming from something like IntelliJ or VS Code.

91
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:18,000
SpaceMax is an Emacs distribution, I guess.

92
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,000
It focuses on the evil layer, the VIM emulation.

93
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,000
So as a VIM user myself, I thought that was great.

94
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
They basically just ship you like a very nicely configured Emacs

95
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
right out of the box.

96
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,000
And I should be clear, if you're an Emacs user, power user,

97
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
someone who knows what they're doing and has their own Emacs file,

98
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
okay, maybe this isn't for you, you've already figured that out.

99
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,000
But when I was trying to learn and kind of play with Emacs a little bit,

100
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
one of the driving reasons was playing with Clojure,

101
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
and Emacs being a Lispy sort of environment,

102
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
that's where a lot of the best plugins were.

103
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,000
But I didn't know Emacs from the back of my hand whatsoever.

104
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Thankfully, SpaceMax was there for me and made it easy to install

105
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
all the plugins I wanted and comes with a nice dark theme

106
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
right out of the gate.

107
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
So tell me a little more about VIM emulation,

108
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
because that seems to be the biggest pushback I got

109
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
when I started talking about this on Twitter was,

110
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,000
but every machine you're going to SSH into probably has VIM on it.

111
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:22,000
So Emacs has Evil, which is the extensible VI layer for Emacs,

112
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
and it basically provides a whole bunch of key bindings

113
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
that you're familiar with.

114
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Wait, it's called Evil? That's amazing.

115
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
The free software community generates some of the best names,

116
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I've just got to say.

117
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
It's not going to be like picture perfect compatible,

118
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
you know, like if you're a master VIM user,

119
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
there's probably some things that Evil doesn't have for you.

120
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
But if you're just looking for a similar editing environment

121
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,000
with similar VI style movements, well, boom,

122
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
just look no further than Evil.

123
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
So if you'd like to try Emacs and not sell your soul,

124
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
you could, I guess, use SpaceMax or GNU Emacs,

125
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
but I personally am going to drink that demon blood and go Evil.

126
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Yes, and so Evil is like a module you can install.

127
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,000
You could use SpaceMax or just install Emacs from the repo.

128
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
And that's what it's like when you're using SpaceMax too,

129
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
I should say.

130
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
So like you just install Emacs like usual.

131
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Installing SpaceMax is basically installing their pre-configured

132
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
configuration directory for you, right?

133
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
So they've set that all up ready to go,

134
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
and then they've got some nice documentation guides

135
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
to kind of guide you through that.

136
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
And I'm sure I sound like a complete novice to anyone

137
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
in our audience who's a master Emacs user.

138
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
So if you have tips, if you've got better ways

139
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
that Mike should be exploring,

140
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
maybe SpaceMax is a horrible abomination in your eyes.

141
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Let us know.

142
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,000
If you're a master Emacs user, does that make you an Emaster?

143
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Oh, I think it does.

144
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I am kind of curious, like what do you use it on the day to day?

145
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
What's your preferred IE?

146
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Do you like a text editor or you want something more full featured?

147
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Where do you fall on that spectrum?

148
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Yeah, I am pretty deep into the JetBrains tool chain,

149
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,000
although I have been leaning on VS Code a little more,

150
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,000
which is why I'm like, well, maybe I could go back to like Emacs or Vim.

151
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,000
It's funny because the more and more I'm thinking,

152
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I can't decide if I still like the big heavy IDEs or not,

153
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
because there is something just like very nice about, you know,

154
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:18,000
being on, you know, on a gnome terminal or terminal

155
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:23,000
and just, you know, Viming open or VS coding a file

156
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
and working with it right now.

157
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
The problem is what I've done to my VS Code,

158
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
it's gotten to the point of its own weird IDE

159
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,000
for a bunch of languages and now it's written in Electron.

160
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Yeah, it sure is.

161
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I mean, I will say as an Electron app,

162
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
VS Code is one of the snappier ones out there.

163
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I think it's one of the best, right.

164
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
This is probably going to be a failed experiment

165
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
and I'm just going to go back to, you know,

166
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
insert JetBrains tools here,

167
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
only because I've been using them a long time, right?

168
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
They have RubyMine, they have RubyMine and PyCharm

169
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
are kind of the two I use a lot.

170
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
I occasionally use Sea Lion,

171
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
although I find that one a little less polished than the others.

172
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
That's one of the ones I have not actually tried.

173
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Yeah, well, it's just because there's like such a wide variety

174
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,000
of C and C++ out there that I think when I last used it,

175
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Sea Lion wasn't exactly as mature as, say, a RubyMine

176
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:15,000
or obviously IntelliJ, their Cadillac Java IDE

177
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I use anytime I'm doing Java.

178
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Cadillac is probably the best term.

179
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I don't know about you, but I think I've met developers

180
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
who couldn't run Java C on the command line

181
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
to save their lives.

182
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Yes, yes, I have to say I kind of hate Gradle

183
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
without IntelliJ, so there is that.

184
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Even though now it is less crappy and just like, you know,

185
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
what is it, Gradle build, Gradle install, whatever.

186
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Yeah, yeah, you're right.

187
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
So does that mean you're like a comfortable

188
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
VI-style key bindings user?

189
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Yeah, I'm pretty comfortable with Vim bindings.

190
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I do use them occasionally,

191
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
like my RubyMine is set up with Vim bindings,

192
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
which is, of course, imperfect, right?

193
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I'm not sure that I need everything I'm getting

194
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
with the full IDE, right?

195
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
And some of it's kind of obnoxious.

196
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
RubyMine's a bad example,

197
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
because I actually think that's one of the better ones.

198
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Actually, I'm interested in that.

199
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
So let's circle back after you're done.

200
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Sure.

201
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Like Project Rider, which is their,

202
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
and I'm only saying JetBrains stuff

203
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
because I predominantly work in their tools,

204
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
is their.NET IDE.

205
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
For some reason, in one of the more recent updates,

206
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
actually, I think it is the last one,

207
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
they suggest a change that violates

208
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
the Visual Studio style guide.

209
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
So if you make the change it suggests,

210
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
because it thinks you're violating the style,

211
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
and then you open it in Visual Studio proper,

212
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Visual Studio complains.

213
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
And it's like the dumbest thing about casing.

214
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
What I know is people are going to write in,

215
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
well, you can change that and have your own style guide.

216
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I do like to keep it just to.NET Core's

217
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
default style guide for obvious reasons.

218
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Sure.

219
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
So that's like mildly annoying to me,

220
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
and it seems like it was just a decision that got made.

221
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Again, I think that is a tool that's going to get better,

222
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
but it is one I think is actually their newest implementation

223
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
of their IntelliJ platform.

224
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
And it's particularly on Linux,

225
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
it can be rough if you're trying to do Xamarin.

226
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,000
In fact, if you Google Xamarin Android Forms on Linux,

227
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
you will see my little mad botter guy,

228
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
because it's me, in the support forums,

229
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
trying to work it out with other people

230
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
and the JetBrains folks,

231
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
because there's a bunch of breaking issues.

232
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Interesting.

233
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
So I was also curious there, you were talking about RubyMine,

234
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
and I'm most familiar with their products through IntelliJ,

235
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
where they've implemented a ton of really fancy

236
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
static analysis of Java to make it, you know,

237
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
it's a much more interactive environment,

238
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
even though Java is so static.

239
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
And it can generate tons of code boilerplate for you,

240
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
and it can jump to definitions,

241
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
and all kinds of much fancier features.

242
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
How does that compare to RubyMine?

243
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
I mean, Ruby's a much more dynamic language.

244
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Does it have all of those superpowers,

245
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
or does it go about it in a different way?

246
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
It does, yeah.

247
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
So we can do some pretty advanced refactorings.

248
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
And the one dirty thing about Ruby developers,

249
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
particularly Rails developers,

250
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
is Ruby is a nice, dynamic language

251
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,000
that everybody uses hardcore linters for

252
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,000
to basically enforce style and a bunch of rules.

253
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
I'll give you an example.

254
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
The most common one is something called RuboCop,

255
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
which I'll link in the show notes.

256
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Oh, I am familiar with RuboCop, my friend.

257
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
We've waged a few battles back and forth in my day.

258
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,000
It goes too far into what I would consider opinion.

259
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Every time, okay, let's take this tangent.

260
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Every time Ruby comes out with a new one-line way to do something,

261
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
the containers of RuboCop,

262
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
just like something happens to them,

263
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,000
they feel like that has to be the correct way to do it.

264
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
And then it complains constantly at me

265
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
that I'm not using the new fanciness,

266
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:56,000
which if you have code bases that are relatively a couple years old,

267
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
that can happen quite a lot.

268
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:02,000
And if you're OCD like me and want to get rid of all those warnings, yeah.

269
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
RubyMine has its own linter for Ruby,

270
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:10,000
and it is much more basically one of the accepted Ruby style guides.

271
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
I think it's a pretty reasonable accommodation

272
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:17,000
to what an experienced Ruby developer would say is the, you know,

273
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:21,000
accepted style, where RuboCop is, I don't know,

274
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
I feel like it's the apple of linters.

275
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
It's like pushing you forward, right?

276
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
It's trying to get you to like update everything.

277
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Ah, so RubyMine, it's easy to have the benefits of a linter,

278
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,000
especially as you say in a dynamic environment,

279
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
but it's not the same sort of, you know, with RuboCop,

280
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
you either got to do a lot of kind of careful tuning sometimes

281
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
or make sure you only stick to the stable releases.

282
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:46,000
And you might have to do some work integrated into a project,

283
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
but maybe with RubyMine, you kind of just start using it,

284
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
get the benefits and not have to make dramatic changes across your team.

285
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Yeah, I mean, the one big advantage of RuboCop though,

286
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,000
because it does go so far into stylistic things,

287
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
you could basically just make it your company style guide

288
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,000
and say we all use RuboCop and warnings are not acceptable

289
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,000
so that you don't have different styles in the same code base.

290
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
But that assumes like a greenfield project.

291
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Yeah, that makes sense, right?

292
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,000
And maybe you've probably integrated it into your CI system

293
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
so it'll warn you as you go through it.

294
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Yeah, well, you could actually integrate it into VS Code,

295
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
in particular in Atom.

296
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,000
And actually, I think there's a plugin for RubyMine for RuboCop

297
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
if you want to go that way.

298
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
You know, I'm sensing a CoderRadio future special here,

299
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
which is Mike pimps your Ruby setup,

300
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,000
because I wouldn't mind it and I bet there's some audience members

301
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
who wouldn't mind it either.

302
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
All right, here's the key, spinning rims.

303
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Ooh, shiny.

304
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,000
You know what else I bet is pretty shiny, Mr. Dominic?

305
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Not that you have one, but if you did,

306
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
well, it'd probably be your Tinder profile

307
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:56,000
and it would brag about your lead IDE setup, no doubt.

308
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
I saw some news I wanted to ask you about

309
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
because, you know, the app developer that you are,

310
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Tinder has now joined the growing backlash

311
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:09,000
against App Store taxes by bypassing Google Play, right?

312
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
So, instead of going through Google Play

313
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,000
using the credit card stuff, paying that 30% tax,

314
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Tinder has joined companies like Spotify and Netflix

315
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
and saying, hey, give us your credit card,

316
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
we'll bill you directly.

317
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
What's happening here, Mike?

318
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:27,000
And is this a sign that something's going to have to finally change

319
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
in the industry, or are these just the big players

320
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
who can do it using their muscle and getting away with it?

321
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
I think both of those things are true, right?

322
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:39,000
I mean, you know, I've been, I don't want to use the word railing,

323
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
but I guess railing is technically true,

324
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:45,000
for years about how 30% for small businesses like myself

325
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
is just too much money.

326
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,000
And in the past, I think it was a weaker argument than it is today

327
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
because, like, it just does not cost that much

328
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
to host individual apps anymore.

329
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,000
And, you know, credit card processing with things like Gumroad,

330
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
which is where I used to sell my Mac apps,

331
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:07,000
and frankly, Stripe's API is awesome and very affordable to use.

332
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
It's ridiculous, right?

333
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Like, having said that, you know,

334
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
if I were to release a mobile app soon,

335
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
I would certainly not go through any of this effort

336
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,000
to avoid the Apple tax or the Google Play tax

337
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
because I'm not Tinder, right?

338
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,000
I'm not, who's the other guy, Fortnite's doing it too, right?

339
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Oh, yeah, that's a big one too, right?

340
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
I mean, plenty of people spend on gaming on mobile.

341
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
And they're doing it on Google Play though.

342
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:35,000
And they're, like, when it's millions of dollars, that 30%,

343
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
I definitely see where they're coming from.

344
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,000
I do wonder, and I'm sure they'll never tell us,

345
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,000
classic, like, startup business development thing, right?

346
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
This is the business part.

347
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,000
The harder you make it for someone to purchase something in an app,

348
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,000
every dialogue box, every field you require them to fill out,

349
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,000
peel off some percentage of your purchasers.

350
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Right, right.

351
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
If I can just hit pay, give you money right now through Google

352
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
that I've already set up, that's a lot easier.

353
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
We're all sick of entering credit card details.

354
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Right, which is, like, the primary advantage of the App Store

355
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,000
in app purchase system, which is why, like,

356
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
if I were to release, say, an iPad app,

357
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
it would absolutely use Apple's IP.

358
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,000
I would love to know what the leakage rate is, right, for Tinder.

359
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Like, let's say, let's just play numbers, 20,000 people a month,

360
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,000
I don't use Tinder, I'm married, so I have no idea.

361
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Do you know how it works? What do you buy in Tinder?

362
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
A lot of those dating apps, it's premium plans, right?

363
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,000
So you get some base feature amount, but if you want to say,

364
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
you know, you swiped left on someone,

365
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
you said you weren't interested, but you messed that up

366
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
and you want the ability to go back and undo it,

367
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,000
well, pay $5 a month and then you can.

368
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Right, so, okay, so it's like a LinkedIn premium account almost.

369
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Exactly.

370
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Okay, well, what LinkedIn does in this case, actually,

371
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
is they think it's slightly cheaper if you buy it on the website,

372
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,000
but I think for Sales Navigator or something.

373
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
But yeah, I would love to see, like, what per, like,

374
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:59,000
if out of 20,000 people, they would normally close the IAP,

375
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,000
you know, 15 or 10 or whatever,

376
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
what is the new number going to be forcing them to go to the website

377
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
and enter their credit card and do it that way?

378
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
That is a great question.

379
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
What do you think the right number is, right?

380
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Google should get some cut, maybe, for enabling the platform

381
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,000
and, like, providing a whole bunch of APIs and stuff

382
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,000
and payment systems, and if 32 much is unreasonable,

383
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
I mean, should it be some sort of sliding scale

384
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
or just a lower flat rate?

385
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
It currently is a sliding scale, right?

386
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
So if you do a subscription model

387
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:33,000
and it's the annual one on the second year, it's 15% now.

388
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
The problem is, and what I've seen,

389
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
particularly like I'm trying to find,

390
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
I'm on a quest, and we could talk about this in another show,

391
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:43,000
for a very specific iPad app that I want when I travel,

392
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
and if I can't find it, I'm just going to write it,

393
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,000
because I keep needing the same thing every trip.

394
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
But this is an app you would really just buy

395
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
and not subscribe to, right?

396
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
I mean, I'll just, you know, use an example,

397
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
like, podcast players, all the big ones now,

398
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,000
are making you subscribe to your podcast app,

399
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,000
which, coming from at least my position of, like,

400
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,000
having been a more traditional Mac developer in the past,

401
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,000
makes no sense at all to me.

402
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Right. We've entered this era of,

403
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,000
everything must be a subscription service.

404
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
And for something that makes sense,

405
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
and you want, like, continual revenue

406
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,000
with the presumption that improvements will be coming to the product.

407
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
But for a lot of things, you're like,

408
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
I just want to buy a hammer.

409
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
I have it. I need to do this one thing with it.

410
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
If you never update it again, that's fine.

411
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Give me the hammer. I'll give you 10 bucks.

412
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Yeah. Like, I am, and this is Mike's tangent.

413
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
I had to buy Office for somebody,

414
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
for a relative this past week,

415
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
because, you know, they're older.

416
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,000
They didn't know. They just didn't. They couldn't do it.

417
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
They needed a hammer.

418
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:44,000
I went to the store to buy Office, to Best Buy.

419
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
A physical store.

420
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Like, you got away from your computer.

421
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
You found your keys. You got your wallet.

422
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,000
You got in the car. You drove to the store.

423
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Then you walked down the aisle and located

424
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,000
the physical boxed version of the software.

425
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Is that what you're saying?

426
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
No, because there was no boxed version.

427
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Wow.

428
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
So you were just left looking like an idiot,

429
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
asking, do you have software here?

430
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
You know what it is?

431
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,000
It's just a key code. It's just a code, a license key.

432
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,000
That's all it is. You're buying like, it looks like a gift card.

433
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,000
And the best is, the salesman was killing himself

434
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
to get me to buy Office 365,

435
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,000
instead of the traditional, you know, small business,

436
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
whatever it is, home business license.

437
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
I stuck to my guns.

438
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Even when installing the, you know, the standalone,

439
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:31,000
perpetual, whatever year, Office,

440
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,000
it still required you to sign in with a Microsoft account.

441
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Then after you had just spent 200 and something dollars

442
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
on this license, it tried to hit you up

443
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
to sign up for Office 365 anyway.

444
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Of course it does.

445
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,000
It's ridiculous. Can't you just buy Excel?

446
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
It's just crazy to me.

447
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:53,000
I, as a Linux user, I appreciate some aspects of Office 365,

448
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,000
just for letting me operate in that environment in a nice way.

449
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
But you're right, like it's just,

450
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
it was one thing when these were additional models,

451
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,000
you know, like, oh yeah, or if it makes more sense for you,

452
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,000
here's this other way to use our products and pay for it.

453
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Great, fine.

454
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,000
It does feel like they're just trying to deprecate the,

455
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:14,000
you buy software and come close to kind of even something like

456
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
own it anymore.

457
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Soon, I mean, it might be a figment of our past imaginations.

458
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Exactly, exactly.

459
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
So what do you, I'll put the question to you.

460
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
What do you think the right number ought to be

461
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
for the App Store percentage?

462
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
That's a good question.

463
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:33,000
I don't think I have a hard number to say.

464
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
How do you value the platform, right?

465
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Like, how do we make a good accounting of all the services that are provided?

466
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Because, I mean, obviously, they just get to say, right,

467
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,000
like it's their platform.

468
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Well, we should actually know Spotify and a few other companies

469
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
are suing because of this very issue.

470
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Right, so we may see.

471
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
You know, when it's a healthy environment,

472
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
when there are enough options,

473
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,000
when they're actually making good investments,

474
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,000
then a slightly higher fee would make a little more sense to me.

475
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:05,000
But if it's just sort of a monopoly tax, you know,

476
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
like, well, you have to play on our game,

477
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:11,000
and we have a store you have to use, so here you go, pay us money now,

478
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
that feels a little bit worse

479
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,000
and doesn't really help the end user very much.

480
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,000
I mean, and the side of it that is a little weird is like,

481
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
just because I mentioned Spotify,

482
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:25,000
where you are now competing with the platform vendor who you rely on,

483
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,000
and they are taxing you 30% to compete with them.

484
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,000
That's where I think it almost gets weird.

485
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:37,000
In a way, I kind of don't care as much as I used to about the 30% cut.

486
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:41,000
I just almost feel like if you are in the business of being a platform vendor,

487
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,000
you should not also be an application or service vendor,

488
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
which I know is like never going to happen.

489
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
But you see what I'm saying,

490
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,000
like the temptation to screw over your competitors

491
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,000
is just a little too juicy, in my opinion.

492
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Yeah, you're right.

493
00:23:55,000 --> 00:24:01,000
There are some weird, maybe even perverse incentives at play here.

494
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,000
So, all right, there's another topic I wanted to pick your brain about,

495
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:09,000
and there's, I think, another set of perverse incentives at play.

496
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:14,000
You brought this up in our off-show production chat,

497
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:19,000
and that's the recent little Twitter storm over 10x engineers.

498
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:24,000
What's going on, Mike, and what's a 10x engineer?

499
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Oh, that's a great question.

500
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:31,000
So, what's going on is some startup guy whose name I don't recall,

501
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,000
but it's kind of not super important for the story.

502
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Shikhar Karani.

503
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Founders, if you ever come across this rare breed of engineers, grab them.

504
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,000
If you have a 10x engineer as part of your first few engineers,

505
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:49,000
you increase the odds of your startup success significantly.

506
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,000
So, first off, I don't know if I'm a 10x engineer,

507
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,000
but if you are a startup founder and you see me and you just grab me,

508
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
I might punch you.

509
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
So, just bad advice.

510
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,000
Yeah, I mean, 2019, you got to get consent now.

511
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,000
You have to, like, maybe a brief written contract,

512
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,000
general grabbing agreement or something, right?

513
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Yeah, so, okay.

514
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:13,000
So, he's asserting that there are these magical people called 10x engineers.

515
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,000
I think we've all heard this term for years now.

516
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:21,000
I kind of don't know that they exist,

517
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:26,000
but there are definitely people who are more, like,

518
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
I call them math savvy than I am.

519
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Like, I would consider you one of these people.

520
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Like, you are able to go more down into the kind of mathematics fundamentals of things

521
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,000
or is that just because you use Clojure and that's how I see it?

522
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Well, maybe.

523
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Where I tend to work with a little more abstraction,

524
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:50,000
except when I go insane and start coding to boards, but we won't worry about that.

525
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
I don't know.

526
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
All right, let's take a step back.

527
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Have you ever met a 10x engineer?

528
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
And if so, like, what is the profile of that person?

529
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Who is that person?

530
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Yeah, and that's what a lot of the threads kind of spend some time trying to suss out.

531
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:08,000
And honestly, when I first saw it, it was kind of hard to tell how serious all of it really was.

532
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Now, I do think we've all met people,

533
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,000
and I don't even want to say people because time and context, I think,

534
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:19,000
is one of the key parts that isn't brought up enough in this discussion.

535
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:23,000
But I think we've all been in context where there have been people around us

536
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:26,000
who were able to accomplish an incredible amount, right?

537
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
Either they knew the right things, they had the right tools,

538
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,000
they were able to combine all of that together,

539
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:36,000
they defeated distractions or questions and delivered the remarkable work.

540
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:41,000
And I think it's reasonable to want to assess how that happens.

541
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:46,000
But it's probably dangerous to enable too much cult of personality.

542
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:52,000
There also seems to be a little bit of, is there like an exploitation factor here?

543
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:57,000
I mean, obviously, you know, the employee-employer relationship is also at play.

544
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,000
It just feels bad to me to even have the label.

545
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,000
And I'm almost looking at it from another perspective of, you know,

546
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:08,000
I think I tweeted something snarky about this when somebody mentioned it to me.

547
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,000
I said it to you in Slack, that's right.

548
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:17,000
What I really hear is, you know, the hot thing used to be full stack a couple years ago, right?

549
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,000
And what I really heard when all these startup guys would say,

550
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:24,000
I need a full stack engineer is I don't want to pay a back-end and a front-end engineer, right?

551
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,000
I would like two jobs done for 1.25 or one.

552
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:30,000
Right. I'd like to pay, yeah, approximately a little bit maybe,

553
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:34,000
a little bit more maybe than one salary and do everything that I need, please.

554
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
So, okay.

555
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:41,000
You know, there definitely is the type of software developer who is very good at coding.

556
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,000
And I think this is something some of the other people commenting on this brought up.

557
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:52,000
But it's kind of, how can I say this politically correct, a gaping defecation hole.

558
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,000
Yeah, you know, I've been lucky enough to work at some places in the past

559
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:59,000
that had at least a talk about, you can argue about implementation,

560
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:02,000
talk about like a no assholes policy, right?

561
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
And the idea is even if you are this incredible engineer,

562
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:08,000
like you don't get to dictate what happens, you don't get to be a jerk.

563
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,000
And I think that plays into that personality aspect.

564
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:14,000
Like there are so many skills that go involved.

565
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
Like you might be able to sling code really well,

566
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
but especially in like a larger enterprise environment,

567
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,000
there's a lot of social aspects that are at least as important as that

568
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:25,000
to the overall operating of a team or an organization.

569
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:29,000
It also seems to be just sort of bad statistics sort of stuff.

570
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:33,000
Like yes, clearly like there are people with different ranges of those skill sets, right?

571
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:36,000
Some people are good at doing code review and mentoring.

572
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,000
Some aren't.

573
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,000
Some just want to be like down in the weeds and can write super fast,

574
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,000
correct network stack implementation.

575
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
And others are really good at modeling data pipelines, right?

576
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
Well, there's all different skill sets.

577
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
So we have to be careful how we judge that.

578
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
It also seems like even within those skill sets,

579
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
yes, there's a distribution of skill.

580
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:57,000
Focusing on the 10x developer is one way to look at it.

581
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
But shouldn't we also be looking at the other extreme?

582
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
Like what are the problems going on?

583
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:05,000
This is why I like to talk about functional programming so much as one aspect, I think.

584
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Like what are the problems going on that are preventing more of us from being more productive, right?

585
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
Do we not have the right tools?

586
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:15,000
Do we not have the right knowledge or assistance or skills?

587
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Maybe we can't all be 10x developers, but I think we can all be better than 1x.

588
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:24,000
Yeah, I mean, I definitely think it's –

589
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:29,000
you get dangerously close to things like process, expectations.

590
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:32,000
You know, there's a lot of like management-y things.

591
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,000
Like for instance, I'm thinking about this from a contracting perspective.

592
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Was the job just like massively underbid, right?

593
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Because no matter how good of a developer you are,

594
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,000
you're never going to actually be successful in that job.

595
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
Right, you've already set yourself up for failure.

596
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:48,000
Are you running any form of waterfall?

597
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:52,000
It's just not possible, at least for as long as I've been doing this,

598
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:56,000
to actually have a customer who upfront knows everything they want.

599
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:01,000
And then once you have a waterfall, and what I really mean by waterfall, I mean fixed bid,

600
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:06,000
you're just going to end up in a fight because you do have to get paid for your work,

601
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:10,000
but they may decide that they want something different, right?

602
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
And you're always doing this hostage negotiation,

603
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,000
which is why you should do agile hourly contracts all the time.

604
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:19,000
It ends up being cheaper for the customer, less stress for you.

605
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:24,000
It's a harder sell to people, like, you know, people who aren't really in the industry,

606
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,000
but most anybody coming from an engineering background,

607
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:31,000
unless they're like literally building bridges where it's a little different,

608
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:34,000
is going to know that like an agile process is going to work better.

609
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:38,000
And I know that's a big statement, and I'm happy to hear any feedback,

610
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:43,000
but if you are like a waterfall guru and you can tell me like there's a way to do this, great.

611
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:51,000
I have not seen it work because just the upfront cost of trying to even do any kind of that waterfall documentation

612
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:54,000
is generally very high, and I have done it.

613
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
I used to sell it as a service.

614
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
You just don't know, right?

615
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:02,000
Like the customer is never going to know everything that they want upfront.

616
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
I mean, how could they? They haven't seen anything.

617
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Right, yeah.

618
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:11,000
Yeah, I do like, I mean, what you're saying, I like the chances for more review, more flexibility.

619
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:16,000
That's an interesting point, and I've certainly seen that go pretty wrong myself.

620
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:23,000
One person whose thoughts I appreciated in this whole discussion was Antires of Redes fame,

621
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:26,000
and he had a great blog post kind of detailing some of the,

622
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,000
talks about some of the issues with how we're talking about the conversation in general,

623
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:34,000
but then also just had a good list of how you might talk about programming productivity

624
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
and some of the things that you might need, right?

625
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:42,000
Like you got to know how to break things down into small tasks and be able to get those sub-tasks done,

626
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
and so an example might be for you, Mike, right?

627
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Like if you've made Rails apps, web servers, web sort of backend apps, worked with databases, a whole bunch,

628
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,000
that means there's a whole list of sub-tasks that are just cached for you, right?

629
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:56,000
You're like, oh, okay, I need another REST endpoint.

630
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,000
No problem, let me just bang that out in an hour or two, and it'll be done.

631
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:03,000
But if you're coming from a different world, you're moving from the embedded environment, say,

632
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:06,000
that's a lot to figure out for the first time.

633
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:11,000
Yeah, I mean, and there's, I mean, I will say there are signs of good, or let's say above average developers, right?

634
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:19,000
Like having a toolbox of scripts or like, I guess, in the world of Docker, container configuration files

635
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:24,000
that you just have pre-ready to go and that you reliably use, right?

636
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:29,000
Yeah, I mean, I can't tell you how many times I've set up Rails and DoKu and Postgres, right?

637
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:32,000
Like, seriously, I must have done it hundreds of times by now.

638
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,000
Even in openSUSE, place.

639
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
Even in openSUSE.

640
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:40,000
Yeah, he's got some other good points that are definitely worth checking out, you know,

641
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:47,000
things like not chasing perfectionism and making sure you keep simplicity in mind.

642
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:51,000
Dear audience, I'm sure you probably have some thoughts on this whole discussion debate

643
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:57,000
and maybe some thoughts about what you value when trying to assess your fellow coders out there.

644
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:04,000
If you do, please let us know. We'd love to hear it. coder.show slash contact.

645
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:10,000
Mike, you've had a long day. I think that means we should take this moment to wrap up today's episode.

646
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:14,000
If they want more of you, though, especially Sleep Deprived Mike, because he can be fun,

647
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:18,000
well, you're also on Twitter, right? What's your handle again?

648
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,000
Add to Minuko, but I will try not to be fun today.

649
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:26,000
Yeah, that's probably best. You deserve a very long nap.

650
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:31,000
I'm on Twitter as well. I'm at Wes Payne, and of course, the whole network's there too,

651
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
