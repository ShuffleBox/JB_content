00:00.000 --> 00:15.600
This is Coda Radio, episode 443 for December 6th, 2021.

00:15.600 --> 00:19.220
Hello friends and welcome back to Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show, taking a

00:19.220 --> 00:25.480
pragmatic look at the art and the business of software development and the world of technology.

00:25.480 --> 00:29.640
My name is Chris and joining us every single week like the podcast soldier that he is,

00:29.640 --> 00:31.040
our host, Mr. Dominic.

00:31.040 --> 00:32.040
Hello, Mike.

00:32.040 --> 00:33.040
Hello.

00:33.040 --> 00:34.040
Hello.

00:34.040 --> 00:35.040
Hello.

00:35.040 --> 00:36.040
You kind of just sliding right into the show today.

00:36.040 --> 00:37.040
I hadn't heard from you this morning.

00:37.040 --> 00:41.360
I thought, oh, he must be either a in a meeting or be deep into something.

00:41.360 --> 00:42.680
I looked over and you were there.

00:42.680 --> 00:43.680
You were there.

00:43.680 --> 00:44.680
I was like, oh, he's here.

00:44.680 --> 00:46.320
You know, it's just been running from thing to thing.

00:46.320 --> 00:49.720
Well, let's take a moment, you know, and we'll spend some time together.

00:49.720 --> 00:51.680
We'll just pretend like now that's going on.

00:51.680 --> 00:52.680
That's what I like to do.

00:52.680 --> 00:54.800
I like to just black it all out.

00:54.800 --> 01:00.560
And I noticed to kind of kick things off that you have finally gotten your hands and I don't

01:00.560 --> 01:03.880
know if we've ever talked about the warp terminal on the show before.

01:03.880 --> 01:09.000
I feel like we might have mentioned it once before, but it's a rust based terminal that

01:09.000 --> 01:12.520
supposedly going to be on multiple platforms, but is out for the Mac now.

01:12.520 --> 01:16.700
You got in on it and I just kind of want to know what you think, because I've heard people

01:16.700 --> 01:17.760
talking about it.

01:17.760 --> 01:22.680
And is there really I guess there is room on the Mac in particular for a better terminal,

01:22.680 --> 01:23.680
isn't there?

01:23.680 --> 01:25.560
Something we've complained about before on the show.

01:25.560 --> 01:26.560
Oh, yeah.

01:26.560 --> 01:30.360
I mean, I will say this warp terminal I'm using it as my daily driver for now.

01:30.360 --> 01:34.240
It is a lot prettier than terminal dot app.

01:34.240 --> 01:36.520
And it's just lightning fast.

01:36.520 --> 01:39.520
And it's got that command palette sort of like V.S. code, but looks better.

01:39.520 --> 01:40.520
Yes.

01:40.520 --> 01:41.520
And it's got a bunch of built in stuff.

01:41.520 --> 01:46.000
If you use GitHub or some other continuous integration stuff, I kind of only cracked

01:46.000 --> 01:48.520
the surface of it because it's only been about a week.

01:48.520 --> 01:53.240
But I am loving it so far and I'm hopefully going to learn more about some of the more

01:53.240 --> 01:54.240
advanced features.

01:54.240 --> 01:59.920
The number one feature that you love and that I love is that it's written in Rust.

01:59.920 --> 02:02.080
I don't know why that matters, really, when you're using it.

02:02.080 --> 02:04.080
It doesn't, but we should Rust all the things.

02:04.080 --> 02:07.160
I wanted to mention because I got in trouble last year that I didn't say on the show and

02:07.160 --> 02:12.080
I almost did it again this year, that the Tuxy votes are open right now.

02:12.080 --> 02:14.300
This is a thing we're doing in Linux Unplugged.

02:14.300 --> 02:18.020
It's not a coder thing, but I specifically got yelled at for not mentioning it here,

02:18.020 --> 02:22.420
because it's an opportunity for you to vote on the best open source projects and distros

02:22.420 --> 02:23.640
of the year.

02:23.640 --> 02:24.640
People wanted to get their vote in.

02:24.640 --> 02:31.040
So you go to tuxys.party, it's tuxys.party, and you go in there and you vote for your

02:31.040 --> 02:34.880
favorite distros and projects and text editors and all that stuff.

02:34.880 --> 02:39.400
Then towards the very end of the year on Linux Unplugged, we announce who the winners are

02:39.400 --> 02:43.700
and give out awards and they get entered into a hall of fame and all of that kind of stuff.

02:43.700 --> 02:49.400
It's a good time and the CoderRadio audience deserves their vote, so tuxys.party is where

02:49.400 --> 02:51.560
you go get that.

02:51.560 --> 02:54.400
And I'm sorry I didn't mention it last year.

02:54.400 --> 02:58.480
So you made your position pretty clear on the Web3 stuff, so when we got this email

02:58.480 --> 03:03.480
from Sonya into the show, it was pretty clear that Sonya doesn't actually listen.

03:03.480 --> 03:09.560
And I should say, we get a lot of pitches for interviews on this show, and a lot of

03:09.560 --> 03:10.560
them are bad pitches.

03:10.560 --> 03:13.160
Yeah, a little inside baseball.

03:13.160 --> 03:16.100
Doing interviews on the air is kind of a huge pain in the butt.

03:16.100 --> 03:21.040
You've done a lot of them for the Mike Dominic show, so you know what a pain it is.

03:21.040 --> 03:26.600
And then there's a huge market in PR firms that try to book people to go on shows to

03:26.600 --> 03:28.600
promote their stuff.

03:28.600 --> 03:30.140
You tell me about it.

03:30.140 --> 03:31.140
So Sonya wrote in.

03:31.140 --> 03:34.360
She's a PR manager at Decentology.

03:34.360 --> 03:38.320
It's an innovative company behind the Hyperverse, Mike, which is an open, composable, smart

03:38.320 --> 03:42.680
contracts marketplace that makes it easy for developers to discover, build, and monetize

03:42.680 --> 03:43.680
Web3 applications.

03:43.680 --> 03:45.360
What the hell does that mean?

03:45.360 --> 03:48.040
She thought, well, she'd contact us so that way we could talk about it a little bit, because

03:48.040 --> 03:52.400
you see, their mission is to onboard the next 10 million developers to Web3.

03:52.400 --> 03:56.880
So they're willing to provide equal opportunities and knowledge to anyone interested in entering

03:56.880 --> 03:57.880
the field.

03:57.880 --> 04:02.340
They're going to have a hackathon initiative, which they call the HyperHack.

04:02.340 --> 04:03.840
She actually says this on here.

04:03.840 --> 04:06.040
Even Web2 developers will be welcome.

04:06.040 --> 04:08.960
She wanted to reach out there on the show, and she loves it.

04:08.960 --> 04:10.520
She loves the show.

04:10.520 --> 04:14.160
She loves our stance on Web3, and she wants to promote her Web3 company.

04:14.160 --> 04:15.560
I don't think Sonya listens, Mike.

04:15.560 --> 04:20.560
I don't know why this one tickled me, because we get so many variations of this.

04:20.560 --> 04:21.720
Yeah, I didn't even see this one.

04:21.720 --> 04:25.360
I must have, my Darth Maul filter must have just been like, no, sorry.

04:25.360 --> 04:26.360
All right.

04:26.360 --> 04:30.600
So listener Michael wrote in, and he did kind of have a pragmatic take on the crypto blockchain

04:30.600 --> 04:31.600
hype.

04:31.600 --> 04:36.080
And he writes, as a daily pragmatist, I do get annoyed with the next big thinkers spouting

04:36.080 --> 04:39.600
new ideas that will revolutionize all the things.

04:39.600 --> 04:43.520
But it doesn't mean they're necessarily wrong about all the things.

04:43.520 --> 04:45.880
We have to push the boundaries and discover new possibilities.

04:45.880 --> 04:49.320
Now 99 out of 100 times, they're going to fall flat.

04:49.320 --> 04:54.760
But that one out of 100 times, we get transformative things like modern web app frameworks, NFC,

04:54.760 --> 04:55.760
Bluetooth.

04:55.760 --> 05:01.840
Sometimes it's actually hard to see in the moment the bull versus the real actual value.

05:01.840 --> 05:04.040
But patience is the key.

05:04.040 --> 05:07.840
The media hype clickbait machine incentivizes grifters, and that's a sad state.

05:07.840 --> 05:09.960
But you just have to ignore them.

05:09.960 --> 05:11.840
Society has always had this problem.

05:11.840 --> 05:18.240
The snake oil salesman of the 1890s or the tube speculation crash of 1637.

05:18.240 --> 05:22.240
Capitalism can incentivize innovation, but leaves the door cracked to grifters looking

05:22.240 --> 05:24.020
to scam a quick buck.

05:24.020 --> 05:28.560
My job is to look through the hype and see what actionable kernels of value I can leverage.

05:28.560 --> 05:33.840
A good example, he says, blockchain as a technology is being used to power technology used by

05:33.840 --> 05:39.400
title companies, a public record of ownership and title transfer for the state's large assets

05:39.400 --> 05:40.720
and real estate.

05:40.720 --> 05:45.480
Similarly, the import export documents for some international shipping companies are

05:45.480 --> 05:49.280
now seeing similar applications using the blockchain.

05:49.280 --> 05:52.960
That seems like a pretty reasonable take on actual value coming out of this.

05:52.960 --> 05:55.000
That seems a pretty reasonable use case, right?

05:55.000 --> 06:00.520
Like I don't think we've ever said the blockchain as a technology or concept was bad.

06:00.520 --> 06:04.040
I think what's bad is doing things you can already do and slapping the hashtag web three

06:04.040 --> 06:05.040
on it.

06:05.040 --> 06:09.080
And claiming that you're going to topple the tech giants that own the market now is just

06:09.080 --> 06:10.880
a little bit of a fool's errand.

06:10.880 --> 06:13.320
I mean, we'd love to see it, but not going to happen.

06:13.320 --> 06:14.320
Never.

06:14.320 --> 06:16.120
We warned you about that about 10 years ago.

06:16.120 --> 06:20.520
I'm wondering, though, you think maybe the mad botter might consider getting paid in

06:20.520 --> 06:21.620
Miami coin?

06:21.620 --> 06:22.620
Have you seen this?

06:22.620 --> 06:24.160
This is near your neck of the woods.

06:24.160 --> 06:25.840
Isn't that just cocaine?

06:25.840 --> 06:30.720
I mean, I've been to Miami.

06:30.720 --> 06:32.780
I'm pretty sure it's cocaine.

06:32.780 --> 06:33.780
You are quick sometimes.

06:33.780 --> 06:34.780
I have to say.

06:34.780 --> 06:35.840
No, this is a real thing.

06:35.840 --> 06:40.140
It's been around for about four months now or so, five months, maybe more.

06:40.140 --> 06:42.240
Miami has launched the Miami coin.

06:42.240 --> 06:45.000
It's worth about 30 million dollars right now.

06:45.000 --> 06:48.480
You mine it and then you keep 70 percent of the revenue.

06:48.480 --> 06:49.480
Give the rest to the city.

06:49.480 --> 06:53.160
The city uses that to pay for certain city initiatives.

06:53.160 --> 06:56.360
And Austin wants to have an Austin coin.

06:56.360 --> 06:59.960
New York is thinking about having a New York coin.

06:59.960 --> 07:00.960
Think about this.

07:00.960 --> 07:03.400
And for listeners out there, think about this for a moment.

07:03.400 --> 07:05.040
How does this make you feel?

07:05.040 --> 07:11.240
If your local nearest large city had a cryptocurrency that you could buy and trade and sell and

07:11.240 --> 07:16.160
that they use the revenue from that to pay for certain things where taxes didn't close

07:16.160 --> 07:17.160
the gap.

07:17.160 --> 07:20.000
I just hope you're ready to reorganize your entire business around this.

07:20.000 --> 07:23.940
Miami not only claims that you can pay your taxes in Bitcoin.

07:23.940 --> 07:29.120
They claim that the mayor and several city staff are getting paid in Bitcoin and that

07:29.120 --> 07:34.360
city citizens will get a Bitcoin dividend from their profits.

07:34.360 --> 07:40.400
Can you picture a world where almost every major city has its own cryptocurrency and

07:40.400 --> 07:44.880
now you have to figure out how to sell a product like this is just going to be a whole new

07:44.880 --> 07:46.400
cluster?

07:46.400 --> 07:48.640
So I have two initial reactions.

07:48.640 --> 07:50.480
What a nice PR stunt for Miami.

07:50.480 --> 07:52.440
Well done, guys.

07:52.440 --> 07:55.040
But this is just a bad idea, right?

07:55.040 --> 07:58.960
This is the reason like every state, you know, you have their own currency here.

07:58.960 --> 08:01.440
Remember the Oracle's Confederation?

08:01.440 --> 08:03.000
That's exactly where I was going with this.

08:03.000 --> 08:05.120
Yeah, it feels like we're going backwards in time.

08:05.120 --> 08:08.560
They figured out that that's kind of stupid.

08:08.560 --> 08:12.200
So there was a federal currency and we call that the dollar.

08:12.200 --> 08:17.800
Imagine the possibility for different kinds of corruption when these different cities

08:17.800 --> 08:22.640
have different implementations and policies and rules around their currency.

08:22.640 --> 08:24.800
It's going to be wild.

08:24.800 --> 08:28.520
Couldn't you like devalue a rival city's coin?

08:28.520 --> 08:33.280
So this is inside Florida baseball, but Orlando, Miami, and to a lesser extent, Tampa, although

08:33.280 --> 08:39.120
Tampa doesn't feel to a lesser extent, but they are in this like big fight to become

08:39.120 --> 08:42.200
the tech hub for Florida.

08:42.200 --> 08:45.720
Which is probably why Miami is doing this, by the way.

08:45.720 --> 08:50.340
Wouldn't it be in the mayor of Tampa's interest, the mayor of Orlando's interest to totally

08:50.340 --> 08:55.180
do whatever they can to devalue Miami coin and just screw the city of Miami?

08:55.180 --> 08:59.800
Wouldn't it be like in any foreign powers interest to go after like major US cities

08:59.800 --> 09:00.800
coins?

09:00.800 --> 09:04.120
And then the other thing that will happen is these currencies will shoot up in value.

09:04.120 --> 09:07.020
The Miami coins gone up like $10 million every month.

09:07.020 --> 09:09.200
So these coins will shoot up in value.

09:09.200 --> 09:14.120
The cities will use these high values to purchase Bitcoin.

09:14.120 --> 09:18.840
And then as they begin selling their currency to buy Bitcoin, the currency will begin to

09:18.840 --> 09:22.520
drop because there will become more supply on the market and the currencies will just

09:22.520 --> 09:23.520
do this over and over again.

09:23.520 --> 09:26.320
They'll go up, the cities will buy Bitcoin with that currency.

09:26.320 --> 09:30.000
That's where they'll actually stash it and then the currencies will drop and it'll happen

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
over and over and over again.

09:32.000 --> 09:37.040
It'll be a constant pump and dump scheme that basically raises the Bitcoin price artificially.

09:37.040 --> 09:39.080
It's not good for crypto in general, I suspect.

09:39.080 --> 09:43.120
So this is like my my constant thing with all this crap, right?

09:43.120 --> 09:44.520
The block chain is amazing.

09:44.520 --> 09:47.840
I think there's a lot of innovation that's going to happen there.

09:47.840 --> 09:48.840
Fantastic.

09:48.840 --> 09:50.960
Miami does not need a coin, right?

09:50.960 --> 09:55.160
We need to really start talking about block chain as block chain.

09:55.160 --> 09:56.560
I mean, I think I've made this clear.

09:56.560 --> 09:58.400
I am not a crypto optimist.

09:58.400 --> 09:59.400
I think.

09:59.400 --> 10:00.400
Oh, really?

10:00.400 --> 10:01.400
We were there, right?

10:01.400 --> 10:05.160
We were there when all this started and was like, what are you buying drugs and hookers?

10:05.160 --> 10:07.360
I mean, it's where it's come on.

10:07.360 --> 10:11.120
Yeah, I always kind of feel like I mean, you got to keep in perspective like cash is probably

10:11.120 --> 10:12.840
used for that 100 times over.

10:12.840 --> 10:13.840
Sure.

10:13.840 --> 10:17.880
And like, I can't say that I haven't bought some Dogecoin and then, you know, sold it

10:17.880 --> 10:20.560
at a slight profit.

10:20.560 --> 10:21.560
That's fun.

10:21.560 --> 10:25.000
But I only do that once a year on Guy Fawkes Day.

10:25.000 --> 10:26.000
That's the way to do it.

10:26.000 --> 10:27.000
That's the way to do it.

10:27.000 --> 10:31.200
I think, you know, there is some fundamentals there people find valuable, obviously a shared

10:31.200 --> 10:33.560
ledger that's cryptographically verifiable.

10:33.560 --> 10:35.120
That's pretty beneficial, right?

10:35.120 --> 10:38.980
A decentralized way to send money from person to person.

10:38.980 --> 10:44.560
If I could send every contractor of JB cash directly and not go through like some sort

10:44.560 --> 10:48.720
of intermediary bank or PayPal or service, I absolutely would.

10:48.720 --> 10:49.720
Why wouldn't?

10:49.720 --> 10:52.000
I want to be able to pay everyone and anything directly.

10:52.000 --> 10:53.000
Of course I would.

10:53.000 --> 10:54.000
I'd love to be able to do that online.

10:54.000 --> 10:56.080
So have you heard of the IRS?

10:56.080 --> 10:57.760
Yeah, that's definitely a thing.

10:57.760 --> 10:58.760
Right.

10:58.760 --> 11:00.720
And that's an area that's interesting.

11:00.720 --> 11:04.120
You know, it seems like they're treating Bitcoin and things like that as an asset, not so much

11:04.120 --> 11:05.120
as a currency.

11:05.120 --> 11:08.920
So when you cash it out, that's when you have to pay your taxes.

11:08.920 --> 11:10.320
Capital gains tax on Bitcoin.

11:10.320 --> 11:11.320
I love it.

11:11.320 --> 11:12.320
Yep.

11:12.320 --> 11:13.440
Onto some more productivity follow up.

11:13.440 --> 11:14.440
We got a bunch.

11:14.440 --> 11:16.480
I just got a couple in here we could fit.

11:16.480 --> 11:19.760
Longtime listener Remy wrote in and said, Hi, Mike and Chris.

11:19.760 --> 11:22.640
On Thursday, local time, I got the new episode of Koda Radio.

11:22.640 --> 11:23.640
So I'm a little behind.

11:23.640 --> 11:25.240
I want to give you a productivity hack while I could.

11:25.240 --> 11:32.120
I recently upgraded my macro pads, special small keyboards with rearrangeable keycaps.

11:32.120 --> 11:37.460
And then he has small pieces of paper with legends under them instead of generic keycaps.

11:37.460 --> 11:40.000
And we'll have a link because he has some photos in his blog post.

11:40.000 --> 11:41.000
And it's awesome.

11:41.000 --> 11:44.120
So we printed out these little squares, transparent keycaps.

11:44.120 --> 11:47.480
He puts a little squares under there, and he says it makes an enormous difference in

11:47.480 --> 11:55.640
debugging C++, which you'd be remotely connected remotely to a coffee machine.

11:55.640 --> 12:00.400
So he could kick off also that I mean, if you're going to go through the hassle of having

12:00.400 --> 12:03.160
custom buttons, obviously, one of them has to brew coffee.

12:03.160 --> 12:04.160
Yeah.

12:04.160 --> 12:08.080
But I had I just had to share this one from Remy because one, it's just great to hear

12:08.080 --> 12:09.080
from him.

12:09.080 --> 12:13.440
But to the blog post that he linked with it is really rad because you see, you see kind

12:13.440 --> 12:14.440
of what he's done with it.

12:14.440 --> 12:16.160
The buttons are backlit.

12:16.160 --> 12:18.840
And then he's printed these little squares with different colors and different words

12:18.840 --> 12:19.840
on it.

12:19.840 --> 12:22.060
And he just hits that and executes the macro.

12:22.060 --> 12:26.760
And it's kind of like a more analog version of the Elgato Steam Deck.

12:26.760 --> 12:28.400
And there's something about that I really love.

12:28.400 --> 12:33.000
I got to get one of those because, you know, getting up to brew tea is just not civilized.

12:33.000 --> 12:35.880
No, no, it's like an animal.

12:35.880 --> 12:39.920
Actually wrote in just some really, really straightforward, simple productivity advice.

12:39.920 --> 12:45.240
First and foremost, use a consistent note system and task management system.

12:45.240 --> 12:50.120
Personally, I've been using a bullet journal since 2019.

12:50.120 --> 12:51.400
The consistency is part of it.

12:51.400 --> 12:57.600
A bullet journal is a lot of work, in my opinion, but I've kind of landed on using things for

12:57.600 --> 13:02.240
like my personal quick tasks, like things I got to do for Christmas.

13:02.240 --> 13:04.360
I use things on iOS.

13:04.360 --> 13:09.020
And then for my work stuff, my work projects, I've taken to using Todoist because it supports

13:09.020 --> 13:10.020
sharing.

13:10.020 --> 13:16.440
It has a really, really light kind of a can board kind of project thing you can also share.

13:16.440 --> 13:20.320
And it has more management with just general group stuff.

13:20.320 --> 13:24.240
And the nice thing about Todoist is there's a bajillion integrations with tons of different

13:24.240 --> 13:25.240
things.

13:25.240 --> 13:27.200
So it's easy to get to dos in there and out and stuff like that.

13:27.200 --> 13:32.720
So I've landed on Todoist for my work stuff and things for my personal stuff.

13:32.720 --> 13:36.000
I think things is the best design to do app on iOS.

13:36.000 --> 13:41.440
Longtime listener Hudson wrote in saying that the Kansas Advantage 2 keyboard made a, quote,

13:41.440 --> 13:45.980
huge difference in the health of their hands and wrists.

13:45.980 --> 13:46.980
This is a monster.

13:46.980 --> 13:49.600
We've talked about it once before on the show.

13:49.600 --> 13:52.460
It looks like something out of Star Trek, Hudson says, and he's right.

13:52.460 --> 13:57.600
It's three hundred and fifty dollars and it's really just this different take on a keyboard

13:57.600 --> 13:58.600
more in.

13:58.600 --> 14:01.460
It's just better for the way our hands are actually built.

14:01.460 --> 14:02.920
But it's a change.

14:02.920 --> 14:04.240
That's a big step for me.

14:04.240 --> 14:08.080
I have found going with the ergonomic split keyboards that have the little feet so they

14:08.080 --> 14:13.080
can get positioned right are a nice intermediary step that, you know, probably a hundred hundred

14:13.080 --> 14:18.160
dollars less or getting a really nice mechanical keyboard that doesn't bottom out when you

14:18.160 --> 14:19.480
press hard.

14:19.480 --> 14:22.000
And if you type hard, it gives you kind of a good response.

14:22.000 --> 14:23.000
That kind of stuff helps.

14:23.000 --> 14:25.140
And then changing it up can help, too.

14:25.140 --> 14:30.940
Now we recorded early last week and we talked about Drew DeVault's complaints around Python.

14:30.940 --> 14:35.280
And we didn't really zero in on quite what Drew was worried about, not editor, Drew,

14:35.280 --> 14:37.180
but Randy Drew on the Internet.

14:37.180 --> 14:38.180
And Will thinks he's nailed.

14:38.180 --> 14:43.940
He says the rant about Python packaging is really kind of hard to suss out.

14:43.940 --> 14:49.460
But reading through the lines, I think he spent too much time ranting about modern software

14:49.460 --> 14:51.800
development in general.

14:51.800 --> 14:55.200
And that's why it was, well, I don't know, pip works for me and stuff like that.

14:55.200 --> 14:59.460
He says what he's particularly upset about is that Python leadership has so far taken

14:59.460 --> 15:03.020
a very hands off approach to its packaging ecosystem.

15:03.020 --> 15:08.540
Core Python has historically had some packaging tools that are old, depreciated and marked

15:08.540 --> 15:10.640
for removal in 3.12.

15:10.640 --> 15:14.640
Most projects use set up tools, which is an independent project, up until the last few

15:14.640 --> 15:16.120
years.

15:16.120 --> 15:18.960
Now set up tools has become the de facto standard.

15:18.960 --> 15:22.120
Reading through all of this, it's kind of easy to understand how some things get a little

15:22.120 --> 15:23.120
complicated.

15:23.120 --> 15:26.100
And he thinks this is what Drew was really kind of complaining about because Drew is

15:26.100 --> 15:29.980
looking at it from a perspective of wanting to be able to package this stuff in a Linux

15:29.980 --> 15:30.980
district.

15:30.980 --> 15:35.900
You know, something else that we haven't really touched on, but Will brings back up, is the

15:35.900 --> 15:39.580
situation where all the Rust moderators resigned.

15:39.580 --> 15:45.240
He says, I interpret what happened there as the mod team resigned as a move of last resort

15:45.240 --> 15:48.300
after a back and forth with the Rust core team.

15:48.300 --> 15:49.300
We haven't really heard much.

15:49.300 --> 15:51.420
And I haven't seen anything else on this.

15:51.420 --> 15:57.820
No, there was a super vague statement by the core team about how they're dedicated to like

15:57.820 --> 16:00.980
working with, you know, the different sub teams or something.

16:00.980 --> 16:03.540
It was really like, I don't know.

16:03.540 --> 16:07.740
He says there was some serious shade thrown by the outgoing mods, quote, we recommend

16:07.740 --> 16:12.720
that the broader Rust community and the future mod team exercise extreme skepticism of any

16:12.720 --> 16:16.260
statements by the core team claiming to illuminate the situation.

16:16.260 --> 16:19.420
He says that's some serious shade to throw without any other context.

16:19.420 --> 16:20.900
I think you're right, Will.

16:20.900 --> 16:21.900
That was something.

16:21.900 --> 16:24.620
Yeah, it's just kind of gone nowhere.

16:24.620 --> 16:25.620
Just kind of gone nowhere.

16:25.620 --> 16:26.620
All right.

16:26.620 --> 16:27.620
Last one.

16:27.620 --> 16:29.660
And I think we're done with the productivity ones for a while.

16:29.660 --> 16:31.540
But see, what happened is people are just kind of catching up.

16:31.540 --> 16:33.180
They're like a week or two behind.

16:33.180 --> 16:34.620
Oh, boy.

16:34.620 --> 16:36.820
So absolute zero had a really great one.

16:36.820 --> 16:41.040
And it's a whole system about writing things down before you go to sleep and labeling your

16:41.040 --> 16:42.860
tabs with an extension.

16:42.860 --> 16:46.660
And what I want to do is I want to link it in the show notes because it's just probably

16:46.660 --> 16:47.660
too long.

16:47.660 --> 16:50.020
It's like a, let me see.

16:50.020 --> 16:51.740
It's like a seven step system.

16:51.740 --> 16:52.740
Jeez.

16:52.740 --> 16:53.940
Yeah, I know.

16:53.940 --> 16:59.340
But he says you get to your creative sweet spot a lot faster following his system.

16:59.340 --> 17:01.580
I kind of like the idea.

17:01.580 --> 17:04.860
And if we were doing the productivity episode today, I would probably read through it and

17:04.860 --> 17:05.860
talk about it.

17:05.860 --> 17:10.020
But I wanted to get link it in the show notes just so that all of you out there, you know,

17:10.020 --> 17:12.420
could go get it and, you know, follow Mike system.

17:12.420 --> 17:16.140
People wrote in wondering if you have a system you follow like a daily regime.

17:16.140 --> 17:17.140
Yeah.

17:17.140 --> 17:19.060
So long time listeners now I've been a little sloppy with them.

17:19.060 --> 17:22.620
I actually have to get back into it, but, uh, well, no, I used to talk a lot about the

17:22.620 --> 17:24.180
Pomodoro technique.

17:24.180 --> 17:28.380
It's a like 25 minutes on five minutes off for coding.

17:28.380 --> 17:32.380
And that's on my basic dev kind of productivity hack.

17:32.380 --> 17:36.220
Uh, and that means, you know, close Twitter, close your email.

17:36.220 --> 17:43.100
Uh, I tend to mute Slack and, uh, I just want to just as a side note muting Slack is a power

17:43.100 --> 17:45.900
move that I'm just going to put it out there.

17:45.900 --> 17:46.900
Double side.

17:46.900 --> 17:50.340
I sent an email and it said, if you're getting too many notifications and you got noise like

17:50.340 --> 17:55.460
family members around you, use the sound canceling headphones, but don't connect them to your

17:55.460 --> 17:57.780
machine that has the notifications like your laptop.

17:57.780 --> 17:59.680
Oh, it's so good, right?

17:59.680 --> 18:01.220
That's the small part I never do.

18:01.220 --> 18:02.460
And I'm going to totally do now.

18:02.460 --> 18:03.460
Right.

18:03.460 --> 18:07.540
Like use, use like an iPad or your phone or whatever to play whatever music and not the

18:07.540 --> 18:08.540
device.

18:08.540 --> 18:09.540
Right.

18:09.540 --> 18:10.540
There's like totally D and D out or whatever.

18:10.540 --> 18:11.540
Yeah.

18:11.540 --> 18:12.540
That's, that's really good.

18:12.540 --> 18:16.880
Uh, the other thing I do is I buy those little, they're called field notes like love field

18:16.880 --> 18:17.880
notes.

18:17.880 --> 18:18.880
Yeah.

18:18.880 --> 18:22.940
So I like the, uh, the grid ones cause I tend to just like sketch either sketch out designs

18:22.940 --> 18:26.220
or like database designs, UML, all that kind of good stuff.

18:26.220 --> 18:32.020
And I don't use them as like some archive of everything, you know, for the end of time.

18:32.020 --> 18:35.340
It's kind of, if I'm doing something or on the phone with somebody, I need to remember

18:35.340 --> 18:36.340
something.

18:36.340 --> 18:37.340
I just write it down.

18:37.340 --> 18:38.340
It's weird.

18:38.340 --> 18:39.340
I think they have a little stupid catchphrase.

18:39.340 --> 18:42.420
I'm writing it down to remember it now, not later, which is exactly how I use them.

18:42.420 --> 18:43.420
Same.

18:43.420 --> 18:46.700
I have one right here and every now and then like if something comes up during the show

18:46.700 --> 18:49.580
or you suggest something or whatever, I'll write it down.

18:49.580 --> 18:54.500
And if I write it down, just that function, I'm probably 80% more likely to remember it.

18:54.500 --> 18:57.960
And if I don't write it down, I'm probably a hundred percent going to forget it.

18:57.960 --> 18:59.580
And I just use it for temporary stuff.

18:59.580 --> 19:00.580
Right.

19:00.580 --> 19:02.420
When I first started using paper notes, I thought I needed to put everything down and

19:02.420 --> 19:03.540
I felt bad for not doing it.

19:03.540 --> 19:09.140
And then I realized, no, there are a specific kind of note information that's, that's ephemeral

19:09.140 --> 19:10.820
and is better captured when writing.

19:10.820 --> 19:12.460
And I use it for that all the time too.

19:12.460 --> 19:15.460
I like it.

19:15.460 --> 19:16.980
Linode.com slash coder.

19:16.980 --> 19:21.220
Go there to get $100 in 60 day credit on a new account and you go there to support the

19:21.220 --> 19:22.220
show.

19:22.220 --> 19:24.420
Linode is how I've hosted everything for the last couple of years.

19:24.420 --> 19:28.720
In fact, I've got a massive project I'm working on there right now that'll tell you more about,

19:28.720 --> 19:34.220
but something I started doing before I launched this new project is I switched over to creating

19:34.220 --> 19:37.900
a flat mesh VPN between all of my Linodes.

19:37.900 --> 19:43.440
I use the open source project called Nebula to create essentially a flat network backhaul

19:43.440 --> 19:47.060
between the Linodes that we have in different data centers.

19:47.060 --> 19:51.300
They've got 11 data centers around the world and Linode is their own ISP.

19:51.300 --> 19:54.300
So their interconnects are screaming fast.

19:54.300 --> 19:58.180
So there's a unique opportunity here to kind of create a super fast flat network between

19:58.180 --> 19:59.940
my machines.

19:59.940 --> 20:03.260
But the project I'm working on, I started building it here in the studio on a Raspberry

20:03.260 --> 20:05.180
Pi compute module.

20:05.180 --> 20:08.260
And so I added the Nebula VPN to that compute module.

20:08.260 --> 20:12.040
And now it's part of that same flat network as all of my Linodes, but it's actually even

20:12.040 --> 20:16.840
better than that because when you're creating a Linode machine, you can add your SSH key

20:16.840 --> 20:19.000
right there at that point in time.

20:19.000 --> 20:20.280
When the machine's done, you just log in.

20:20.280 --> 20:21.620
It's so great.

20:21.620 --> 20:26.060
So I've done that and I have a master control SSH key that I've put on the Linodes that

20:26.060 --> 20:29.980
we've deployed for about at least a year now.

20:29.980 --> 20:34.120
So over time I'm kind of going with best practices and I'm shutting down internet SSH access

20:34.120 --> 20:38.180
to my machines and only allowing it from the Nebula VPN.

20:38.180 --> 20:43.240
And I have a master control Linode that I log into that's part of that Nebula VPN or

20:43.240 --> 20:48.140
my Raspberry Pi, which is part of that Nebula VPN, or I could add any machine really.

20:48.140 --> 20:50.860
And I can get access to these machines safely and securely.

20:50.860 --> 20:56.060
And Linode actually takes steps and efforts to make sure that their machines are VPN friendly.

20:56.060 --> 21:00.380
So if you'd like to set it up as a VPN endpoint yourself or use a mesh VPN like I am, it's

21:00.380 --> 21:03.940
very accessible and they work hard to make sure that's possible.

21:03.940 --> 21:08.300
But what's really kind of great about Linode is they have that performance to price ratio.

21:08.300 --> 21:12.040
They're 30 to 50% cheaper than the major hypervisors out there that want to lock you into their

21:12.040 --> 21:13.900
crazy platforms.

21:13.900 --> 21:16.560
And they're constantly investing in their platform.

21:16.560 --> 21:20.780
They've been doing this for 18 years and they've stepped it up over the last five years.

21:20.780 --> 21:24.120
I mean, it's like they just put the pedal to the metal and they've never let off.

21:24.120 --> 21:27.680
They've recently been rolling out super fast PCIe MVME storage.

21:27.680 --> 21:31.780
Of course, they've got the latest and greatest AMD epic processors for the data center that

21:31.780 --> 21:33.560
are on their highest CPU end machines.

21:33.560 --> 21:36.540
They've got 40 gigabit connections coming into those networked machines.

21:36.540 --> 21:38.260
It's just like on and on and on.

21:38.260 --> 21:41.560
And then on top of all of that, they've got great services you can layer in there that

21:41.560 --> 21:47.700
take it to the next level, like object storage and cloud firewalls and a powerful DNS manager,

21:47.700 --> 21:50.540
Kubernetes support, VLAN support.

21:50.540 --> 21:54.240
I mean, it just is such a package.

21:54.240 --> 21:59.400
And then to top it all off, they're supporting a big part of our community.

21:59.400 --> 22:03.840
Not just in the media space, but some of my favorite open source projects are supported

22:03.840 --> 22:08.320
by Linode and some of my favorite events have been supported by Linode.

22:08.320 --> 22:12.800
They understand that kind of investing in that ecosystem pays dividends long term.

22:12.800 --> 22:18.240
Even if they can't do a pro and con and maybe they can't necessarily like hit a key performance

22:18.240 --> 22:22.440
indicator by doing it, they know long term it serves them because they've been part of

22:22.440 --> 22:23.440
this community.

22:23.440 --> 22:24.700
So go try it for real.

22:24.700 --> 22:27.160
Go try it for yourself and support the show.

22:27.160 --> 22:30.640
Linode.com slash coder, that's Linode.com slash coder.

22:30.640 --> 22:39.160
Get $100 in 60 day credit on a new account and support the show, Linode.com slash coder.

22:39.160 --> 22:42.560
There's a story going around today that we have to talk about on the show.

22:42.560 --> 22:45.980
First of all, I really can connect with this because I have been in some surprise meetings

22:45.980 --> 22:48.280
where everyone in the meeting got fired.

22:48.280 --> 22:56.360
But today it came out that the CEO of Better.com fired 900 employees at once over a Zoom meeting.

22:56.360 --> 22:57.840
It's brutal.

22:57.840 --> 23:02.280
Somebody posted the video online and I grabbed just like 10 seconds of it.

23:02.280 --> 23:04.840
But the whole thing you might want to go watch if you really like the cringe.

23:04.840 --> 23:13.480
If you're on this call, you are part of the unlucky group being laid off.

23:13.480 --> 23:18.080
Your employment here is terminated effective immediately.

23:18.080 --> 23:21.240
Just good morning and thanks for joining us on the call today.

23:21.240 --> 23:23.080
Hey, look, I'm real sorry.

23:23.080 --> 23:24.080
This has been hard.

23:24.080 --> 23:26.640
Hardest thing I've had to do for the second time in a row because apparently he's done

23:26.640 --> 23:28.120
this at a previous company, too.

23:28.120 --> 23:30.280
The 43 year old CEO has.

23:30.280 --> 23:35.160
But quote, the market has changed and, you know, we got to do what we got to do to fulfill

23:35.160 --> 23:36.200
our mission.

23:36.200 --> 23:39.320
So 900 of you are gone.

23:39.320 --> 23:42.280
900 employees in one shot.

23:42.280 --> 23:43.280
Yeah.

23:43.280 --> 23:44.900
All over Zoom.

23:44.900 --> 23:48.000
Some of the American employees will get some severance and stuff like that.

23:48.000 --> 23:50.160
Some of them are going to get like a package.

23:50.160 --> 23:52.880
So they're going to get taken care of for a little bit.

23:52.880 --> 23:55.480
But what a wild thing, huh?

23:55.480 --> 24:01.080
And man, I have been in this spot before where I was told that no one had been laid off in

24:01.080 --> 24:03.080
25 years at this company.

24:03.080 --> 24:04.920
You'll always have a job here.

24:04.920 --> 24:08.840
And then I got called into a meeting one day and told that everyone in our department was

24:08.840 --> 24:12.160
being laid off and being replaced by contractors.

24:12.160 --> 24:14.160
It's a family until it isn't all of a sudden.

24:14.160 --> 24:15.880
What do these people do?

24:15.880 --> 24:16.880
Better.com.

24:16.880 --> 24:17.880
Actually, let's go take a look.

24:17.880 --> 24:18.880
I haven't done it.

24:18.880 --> 24:21.140
Maybe somehow they've had to lay people off with a domain like that.

24:21.140 --> 24:22.280
You'd think they'd be making money.

24:22.280 --> 24:23.280
But Better.com.

24:23.280 --> 24:25.160
Oh, are they down right now?

24:25.160 --> 24:26.160
They might be down right now.

24:26.160 --> 24:27.160
Well, they're backed by SoftBank.

24:27.160 --> 24:31.600
Also, I don't know if you've noticed this, but there's some East Coast, West Coast bias

24:31.600 --> 24:35.720
here because the headline is not Better.com CEO.

24:35.720 --> 24:36.840
No, no.

24:36.840 --> 24:42.840
The headline is New York CEO fires 900 employees on Zoom call because those East Coasters are

24:42.840 --> 24:43.840
such jerks.

24:43.840 --> 24:47.960
I was going to say an enlightened California CEO who's been meditating for six hours but

24:47.960 --> 24:55.040
never just like can a bunch of people know I saw that I thought, oh, man, there's some

24:55.040 --> 24:56.520
serious bias there.

24:56.520 --> 25:00.080
OK, so Better.com, the right mortgage could save you thousands.

25:00.080 --> 25:02.660
So it's like some sort of mortgage grifting business, it looks like.

25:02.660 --> 25:06.240
And they're backed by SoftBank, thus explaining how they afford the domain.

25:06.240 --> 25:07.240
Better.com.

25:07.240 --> 25:08.240
Got it.

25:08.240 --> 25:09.240
Yeah.

25:09.240 --> 25:10.240
They're doing stuff with mortgages.

25:10.240 --> 25:11.240
It's not a bubble kids.

25:11.240 --> 25:12.240
Isn't that something?

25:12.240 --> 25:15.280
And, you know, it's not like it's super easy on the freelancer side either.

25:15.280 --> 25:24.240
So I, if you allow, a little behind the scenes, I am working on a new Linux show.

25:24.240 --> 25:27.320
But what happened to the M1 power hour?

25:27.320 --> 25:29.320
That's such a great name.

25:29.320 --> 25:33.320
We should do it just because of the name.

25:33.320 --> 25:38.080
But you know, like you have to ask yourself as like a small shop, like, what are my core

25:38.080 --> 25:39.080
competencies?

25:39.080 --> 25:42.080
Like, where can I actually add value?

25:42.080 --> 25:46.400
And for me, like, and also I have to ask the question, what do I enjoy doing?

25:46.400 --> 25:50.760
Because if I don't enjoy doing it, I'll burn out after a while because, you know, a new

25:50.760 --> 25:52.440
show is a big commitment.

25:52.440 --> 25:56.600
It's something you're doing over and over and over again, potentially for as long as

25:56.600 --> 25:57.600
possible.

25:57.600 --> 26:00.520
You know, as close to indefinite as you can achieve.

26:00.520 --> 26:01.520
That's the goal.

26:01.520 --> 26:04.640
Like your goal is to create work for yourself that never ends.

26:04.640 --> 26:05.640
Right.

26:05.640 --> 26:09.640
So you better like it.

26:09.640 --> 26:13.800
It's been really hard for me because I've had this really clear idea that I chicken

26:13.800 --> 26:16.560
out and I kind of think, well, maybe I should go a different direction.

26:16.560 --> 26:23.440
I've been chewing on this and I'll link to a blog post at Seth's blog and I like it a

26:23.440 --> 26:24.440
lot.

26:24.440 --> 26:25.440
It's called the freelancer's dilemma.

26:25.440 --> 26:30.680
And he says, engaging the marketplace requires creating value for people who have a choice

26:30.680 --> 26:35.980
and deciding what you offer your customers is your choice.

26:35.980 --> 26:41.120
It begins by being clear about what you own and what you're good at and what gives you

26:41.120 --> 26:42.880
satisfaction.

26:42.880 --> 26:45.040
So I've been thinking about that recently.

26:45.040 --> 26:47.460
I'm hoping to have it ready for the new year.

26:47.460 --> 26:48.460
We shall see.

26:48.460 --> 26:53.840
I don't know because it involves moving a few other things around to accommodate for

26:53.840 --> 26:54.840
this.

26:54.840 --> 26:57.000
But it's such a saturated market.

26:57.000 --> 26:58.000
Right.

26:58.000 --> 27:01.240
But I feel like I've got something new in me that I want to do.

27:01.240 --> 27:04.800
But I can't tell if it's just, you know, I want to scratch an itch or if I really feel

27:04.800 --> 27:06.880
like there's a place for it in the market.

27:06.880 --> 27:10.880
It's kind of one of those like, you know, if you really mess it up, there's not a lot

27:10.880 --> 27:12.440
of room for failure.

27:12.440 --> 27:16.300
So the consequences are pretty significant.

27:16.300 --> 27:23.720
Maybe not irreparable in large part because we have members, but still significant.

27:23.720 --> 27:28.040
It's possible I'll be wrapping up another show to make room for it.

27:28.040 --> 27:31.160
You know, like that's a big decision too that has to be made.

27:31.160 --> 27:33.560
All of that's been on my mind recently.

27:33.560 --> 27:36.360
There's not a clear strategy available to me.

27:36.360 --> 27:40.920
There's not really anybody in this niche that I could emulate.

27:40.920 --> 27:44.440
And there's not really any kind of like guide to follow.

27:44.440 --> 27:48.720
I just kind of have to decide and execute and hope for the best and then pivot if it

27:48.720 --> 27:49.720
fails.

27:49.720 --> 27:51.360
Can I pitch a concept?

27:51.360 --> 27:52.360
Go for it.

27:52.360 --> 27:59.880
We take famous like Apple World podcasters and we just like sit them down with Pop OS.

27:59.880 --> 28:01.080
Oh man.

28:01.080 --> 28:02.080
Anything but KD.

28:02.080 --> 28:03.080
KD is a little too stable.

28:03.080 --> 28:04.080
Yeah.

28:04.080 --> 28:05.080
Something good home based.

28:05.080 --> 28:07.200
Oh, they'd find, they'd find issues with plasma for sure.

28:07.200 --> 28:08.200
Well, okay.

28:08.200 --> 28:11.600
Well, just like I want like a Linus tech tips, like destroy your desktop environment in the

28:11.600 --> 28:13.080
first five minutes.

28:13.080 --> 28:14.800
Yeah, man.

28:14.800 --> 28:15.800
That's been rough to watch.

28:15.800 --> 28:16.800
I have to be honest.

28:16.800 --> 28:17.800
Yeah, I did.

28:17.800 --> 28:18.800
I just saw the most recent one.

28:18.800 --> 28:19.800
So, so another Linux show.

28:19.800 --> 28:23.520
No, you, so you were telling me you're not bringing Stow back for me.

28:23.520 --> 28:24.520
Just not happening.

28:24.520 --> 28:31.480
No, unfortunately, not unless they turn that game around and tell you what, as the editor

28:31.480 --> 28:33.480
and chief of the network, I could do anything I want, right?

28:33.480 --> 28:35.500
I could, I could launch Stow again.

28:35.500 --> 28:38.040
So I've been tempted, you know, I've been tempted not to launch Stow, but I've been

28:38.040 --> 28:42.460
tempted to do something that's kind of a new genre, a new area of coverage.

28:42.460 --> 28:47.320
But the reality of that is, is that we have so much momentum built up around Linux and

28:47.320 --> 28:52.400
open source software and credibility and, and resources, right?

28:52.400 --> 28:53.400
So yeah, for sure.

28:53.400 --> 28:57.120
Kind of the, there's a, there's a nice network effect of if I build up another Linux show

28:57.120 --> 29:01.120
and I spend my time doing something for that show, like learning something or talking to

29:01.120 --> 29:05.240
somebody that's knowledge that becomes applicable to the other Linux shows as well.

29:05.240 --> 29:08.800
So it's sort of like a network effect of, even though I'm working on multiple shows,

29:08.800 --> 29:12.920
a rising tide sort of thing for knowledge and network connections and all that kind

29:12.920 --> 29:13.920
of thing.

29:13.920 --> 29:16.800
So there's a lot of advantages in that regard as well.

29:16.800 --> 29:20.560
It's probably an area that, you know, I also have the most history with, you know, I've

29:20.560 --> 29:22.880
been covering Linux stuff for almost 13, 14 years.

29:22.880 --> 29:23.880
Yeah.

29:23.880 --> 29:24.880
And you have the people, right?

29:24.880 --> 29:29.800
If you ever need like to slot in a guest host or something, you have enough Linux gurus.

29:29.800 --> 29:30.800
Yeah.

29:30.800 --> 29:31.800
We'll see.

29:31.800 --> 29:32.800
We'll see.

29:32.800 --> 29:35.280
But so it's not always so easy on the, yeah, you know, I'm not going to necessarily get

29:35.280 --> 29:40.660
fired tomorrow, but I could make one misstep, one miscalculation and essentially lead to

29:40.660 --> 29:42.360
my own firing.

29:42.360 --> 29:43.560
So it's not always easy.

29:43.560 --> 29:44.840
Like canceling stow.

29:44.840 --> 29:46.340
Yeah, exactly.

29:46.340 --> 29:47.680
Or canceling Linux action show.

29:47.680 --> 29:50.360
I'm still hearing about that all the time.

29:50.360 --> 29:51.560
I got an email this morning.

29:51.560 --> 29:52.560
Yeah, but come on.

29:52.560 --> 29:54.320
And Linux action news and Linux.

29:54.320 --> 29:58.480
I would actually argue Linux unplugged is, you know what, let me bait the trolls.

29:58.480 --> 30:01.240
Linux unplugged is a better version of Linux action show.

30:01.240 --> 30:03.040
Oh, Linux unplugged.

30:03.040 --> 30:06.740
You know, it was, if you were going to bill, I think if you were going to build last today,

30:06.740 --> 30:08.700
you would probably just build that show really.

30:08.700 --> 30:09.700
So you're probably right.

30:09.700 --> 30:10.700
It would just be Linux unplugged.

30:10.700 --> 30:12.360
You would never do last the way you did it.

30:12.360 --> 30:16.560
You know, and we're going back into what, like the 2010s now, 2006 is I think when the

30:16.560 --> 30:17.560
show started.

30:17.560 --> 30:18.560
Was it really?

30:18.560 --> 30:19.560
Yeah.

30:19.560 --> 30:20.560
Yeah.

30:20.560 --> 30:24.640
And then video, I think was 2008 is when we got video, I started watching it when it

30:24.640 --> 30:25.640
was on video.

30:25.640 --> 30:26.640
Yeah.

30:26.640 --> 30:27.640
You would never do that again.

30:27.640 --> 30:28.640
Well, maybe you would do video again.

30:28.640 --> 30:29.640
I don't know.

30:29.640 --> 30:30.640
But never that format.

30:30.640 --> 30:33.000
I don't think because podcasting is like so mature now.

30:33.000 --> 30:38.320
It was a product of that era, you know, and it was closer to the nineties.

30:38.320 --> 30:39.320
So it was a little more acceptable.

30:39.320 --> 30:44.800
Like we were really cheeky and in on like the theme music invoking nineties, Sonic the

30:44.800 --> 30:46.400
Hedgehog vibes, right?

30:46.400 --> 30:50.480
It was tongue in cheek, but now it would just sound extremely antiquated.

30:50.480 --> 30:57.560
Well, and so this new show, this is a Luminary exclusive or Spotify exclusive or.

30:57.560 --> 30:58.560
You and Joe Rogan.

30:58.560 --> 30:59.560
Right.

30:59.560 --> 31:02.840
It's going to be a crypto exclusive network Christ.

31:02.840 --> 31:06.120
You have to give your wallet, you know, you have to get on the block chain to get it.

31:06.120 --> 31:07.120
Yeah.

31:07.120 --> 31:08.360
You just have to invest in a little pod coin.

31:08.360 --> 31:16.840
And then you know what I'm about to NFT the Jar Jar sound like I'm just saying.

31:16.840 --> 31:21.660
Jupiter Party, you have been asking for it and I have finally gotten it together.

31:21.660 --> 31:25.680
It's a membership for the entire network and for the cost of just two memberships, you

31:25.680 --> 31:28.340
get access to everything currently.

31:28.340 --> 31:29.340
That's four shows.

31:29.340 --> 31:33.660
But when that grows, you automatically get access to that as well.

31:33.660 --> 31:37.760
And when you're checking out, if you use the promo code, the signal, they'll get two dollars

31:37.760 --> 31:39.460
off for a year.

31:39.460 --> 31:43.960
So right now it's a limited time to sign up and support the entire network and get access

31:43.960 --> 31:50.440
to the ad free version of every show to get access to the post show of self-hosted.

31:50.440 --> 31:56.080
And of course, to get the full live version, which has tons of extra content of Linux unplugged,

31:56.080 --> 31:59.620
all of them fully produced and ready to go in a feed for you.

31:59.620 --> 32:03.560
And you can support the entire network for just the cost of two memberships.

32:03.560 --> 32:08.040
So to get access and sign up right now or to give it as a gift because we've added gift

32:08.040 --> 32:15.000
options to just go to Jupiter Party and then use the promo code the signal and get yourself

32:15.000 --> 32:17.320
two dollars off for a year.

32:17.320 --> 32:20.320
Jupiter Party, your membership makes a difference.

32:20.320 --> 32:25.560
We're just a small, independent team doing our absolute best to make content for you

32:25.560 --> 32:29.400
and you can help make that a reality and keep us going.

32:29.400 --> 32:34.200
Jupiter Party, promo code the signal.

32:34.200 --> 32:39.740
So Apple has a plan to crack the business market and I'm actually buying this one.

32:39.740 --> 32:45.040
So Apple is beginning through partners to offer a thirty dollar a month M1 plan.

32:45.040 --> 32:52.320
You can lease an M1 Mac for thirty bucks a month and Apple is also launching a business

32:52.320 --> 32:56.860
essentials program that we talked about briefly on here that gives you like centralized management

32:56.860 --> 33:00.960
tools and free backup storage for Macs.

33:00.960 --> 33:04.400
Sort of a similar management system to the iPhone, although I would suspect probably

33:04.400 --> 33:06.120
not as complete.

33:06.120 --> 33:11.920
And then additionally, on top of that, Amazon has announced that you can now get Amazon

33:11.920 --> 33:14.720
EC2 M1 Mac instances.

33:14.720 --> 33:18.440
You got to give them 24 hours of heads up, though, because they're racking physical

33:18.440 --> 33:22.040
Mac minis at AWS.

33:22.040 --> 33:25.480
There's a poor guy named John just racking up M1s.

33:25.480 --> 33:29.680
But you know, I actually think Apple is aiming at the small business market, not the big

33:29.680 --> 33:34.720
enterprise market, but like the hundred, two hundred size market.

33:34.720 --> 33:37.560
And you know what I really think the sign was of that?

33:37.560 --> 33:39.740
And I mean, it's not like I'm joking.

33:39.740 --> 33:42.680
I think it was adding the HDMI port back.

33:42.680 --> 33:48.120
The only reason really for an HDMI port that isn't a higher res capable signal projectors,

33:48.120 --> 33:49.120
projectors.

33:49.120 --> 33:55.400
Yeah, I've been in many boring meetings where I've had to dongle up to a projector.

33:55.400 --> 33:56.980
It's a meme at this point.

33:56.980 --> 33:59.480
It's a meme that Apple wants to kill.

33:59.480 --> 34:05.280
And it's something that the that I think I think the dongle thing was felt the hardest

34:05.280 --> 34:10.040
by offices that had to connect to different peripherals or different projectors and whatnot

34:10.040 --> 34:12.480
or conferences and tech events.

34:12.480 --> 34:17.880
That's where the dongle stuff really got people just like either in some situation where they

34:17.880 --> 34:20.200
couldn't connect or, you know, just a bad taste in their mouth.

34:20.200 --> 34:26.760
I just want to say right before Covid, like I have many times in an airport been the customer

34:26.760 --> 34:31.200
of those stupid Best Buy vending machines that will basically sell you a bunch of dongles

34:31.200 --> 34:33.840
for your Apple devices that should have more ports.

34:33.840 --> 34:34.840
I see people lined.

34:34.840 --> 34:38.840
I used to go there anymore, but I used to see people lined up there all the time getting

34:38.840 --> 34:41.760
themselves a dongle or a pair of headphones or something like that.

34:41.760 --> 34:45.080
And Bluetooth headphones, because, of course, they can't wire their headphones and they're

34:45.080 --> 34:46.360
going about to get on a plane.

34:46.360 --> 34:48.040
And that's the times when it really sucks.

34:48.040 --> 34:51.280
The most is those situations.

34:51.280 --> 34:55.880
But you think they got a shot here, you know, picture your hundred person company, two hundred

34:55.880 --> 34:59.960
person company, thirty dollars a month for an M1.

34:59.960 --> 35:04.840
And also you can buy into this Apple business essentials program where they'll provide support

35:04.840 --> 35:06.400
and centralized management.

35:06.400 --> 35:07.400
Think this is going to do it?

35:07.400 --> 35:08.640
I kind of see them separately, right?

35:08.640 --> 35:13.480
The Apple business essential support, it really, really sucks to be an MDM company now.

35:13.480 --> 35:19.680
Because I don't see a reason unless you have some weird cross-platform needs, why you wouldn't

35:19.680 --> 35:22.280
just issue iPhones and iPads.

35:22.280 --> 35:26.400
And I just, just like a big part of my business used to be, and I'm sure still is for people

35:26.400 --> 35:30.880
who are more iOS focused, is writing enterprise software for tablets, right?

35:30.880 --> 35:31.880
For iPads.

35:31.880 --> 35:35.560
That seems huge to me, the business essentials thing.

35:35.560 --> 35:41.120
The hardware thing, you know, the problem with Mac OS as a business OS, I think for

35:41.120 --> 35:47.520
a lot of like those one hundred employee companies, is if you get a new device every year, do

35:47.520 --> 35:50.960
you also now get the new version of Mac OS?

35:50.960 --> 35:54.680
And I think for a lot of IT departments, that's maybe not something they want.

35:54.680 --> 35:58.540
Yeah, I think if you're going to go the Mac route, you kind of have to be committed to

35:58.540 --> 36:01.360
at least upgrading every other OS release.

36:01.360 --> 36:02.360
Yeah.

36:02.360 --> 36:04.680
Are they going to force you to, right?

36:04.680 --> 36:08.560
Is this like the iPhone program where it's, you know, N dollars a month, then when the

36:08.560 --> 36:10.560
new one comes out, you just automatically get it?

36:10.560 --> 36:15.680
Because I could see that being like the IT, you know, department's headache every year.

36:15.680 --> 36:16.680
Or is it optional?

36:16.680 --> 36:17.680
Yeah.

36:17.680 --> 36:18.680
I didn't read the specifics.

36:18.680 --> 36:21.760
It might be every two years and then it's optional if you want to replace it.

36:21.760 --> 36:22.760
But yeah.

36:22.760 --> 36:23.760
Yes.

36:23.760 --> 36:24.760
I follow what you're saying there.

36:24.760 --> 36:26.200
That would be a maintenance problem.

36:26.200 --> 36:27.200
Maintenance problem.

36:27.200 --> 36:33.080
And I don't think a lot of enterprises anymore have like custom line of business Mac OS software.

36:33.080 --> 36:38.960
I know we're going to get emails from folks who do, but so yeah, I mean, Microsoft does

36:38.960 --> 36:39.960
this too, right?

36:39.960 --> 36:43.360
They do surface, not pro, whatever they call it.

36:43.360 --> 36:44.800
They have a plan just like this.

36:44.800 --> 36:45.800
Right.

36:45.800 --> 36:46.800
What about for your business?

36:46.800 --> 36:52.120
Instead of dropping two grand on an M1, 30 bucks a month until you don't use it anymore

36:52.120 --> 36:53.120
and then you send it back.

36:53.120 --> 36:54.120
Okay.

36:54.120 --> 36:56.080
So what if a Martini gets poured into it?

36:56.080 --> 36:57.680
Well, I wonder, huh?

36:57.680 --> 36:58.680
What is that?

36:58.680 --> 37:00.000
Because they have to have some accommodations.

37:00.000 --> 37:01.640
There's going to be damage to these things.

37:01.640 --> 37:02.640
Yeah.

37:02.640 --> 37:03.640
Exactly.

37:03.640 --> 37:06.360
I bet it comes with apple care plus and then you can buy the additional coverage.

37:06.360 --> 37:07.600
Ah, yeah, of course.

37:07.600 --> 37:09.280
So then if it's covered by apple care, you're good.

37:09.280 --> 37:14.800
And if apple care says screw off, you're probably just, you, you, you bought the machine.

37:14.800 --> 37:15.880
So I don't know.

37:15.880 --> 37:19.960
I mean, it's kind of a sweetheart deal for a business of my size cause it's just not

37:19.960 --> 37:20.960
that much money.

37:20.960 --> 37:21.960
Yeah.

37:21.960 --> 37:23.920
That's what I was surprised by is it seems cheap for apple.

37:23.920 --> 37:24.920
Yeah.

37:24.920 --> 37:26.640
But maybe this doesn't make sense.

37:26.640 --> 37:31.720
Like I wouldn't be surprised if you have to buy like 50 or 60 units to get this plan.

37:31.720 --> 37:32.840
Ah, yeah, sure.

37:32.840 --> 37:38.880
I really doubt I could get like eight, you know, you know, spend $240 a month and just

37:38.880 --> 37:41.800
everybody gets a new M1 all the time.

37:41.800 --> 37:43.800
That seems crazy to me.

37:43.800 --> 37:48.280
Well maybe one way you could manage all those new Macs is a bunch of folks sent into the

37:48.280 --> 37:56.920
show, friend of the show, Jeff Gerling's Ansible GitHub page for managing his software setup.

37:56.920 --> 38:01.160
He's got a playbook for setting everything up on his Mac and he just, when he gets a

38:01.160 --> 38:03.000
new Mac, he rolls this out.

38:03.000 --> 38:06.960
He says it automates the software on his Mac for software and web development.

38:06.960 --> 38:08.400
Some things are difficult to automate.

38:08.400 --> 38:12.000
So I still have to do a few manual steps, but it's all documented here.

38:12.000 --> 38:15.120
What it would is, you know, whatever might be the exception.

38:15.120 --> 38:18.200
And I think he gets things up and going in like 15, 20 minutes on a brand.

38:18.200 --> 38:23.080
He goes from brand new Mac to ready for full development in about 15, 20 minutes.

38:23.080 --> 38:24.080
That's epic.

38:24.080 --> 38:25.080
Yeah.

38:25.080 --> 38:30.040
It makes me kind of think, because I know I also should learn Ansible for the server

38:30.040 --> 38:31.040
stuff.

38:31.040 --> 38:32.640
But actually, I want to come back to that real quick.

38:32.640 --> 38:33.640
I got to be honest.

38:33.640 --> 38:36.040
I didn't even realize you could do anything on a Mac with Ansible.

38:36.040 --> 38:38.680
I didn't know it was compatible with Ansible.

38:38.680 --> 38:40.280
I assumed it was not.

38:40.280 --> 38:42.520
So that's an area I need to learn a lot more about.

38:42.520 --> 38:46.800
But I got a confession to make that I realized I should have been telling you on the show.

38:46.800 --> 38:53.280
Red Hat announced that CentOS was transitioning from a standard release that follows the Red

38:53.280 --> 39:00.360
Hat model to a continuous delivery of minor versions called CentOS Stream.

39:00.360 --> 39:02.160
It's not as bad as they made it sound.

39:02.160 --> 39:09.640
What it really means is instead of waiting for like Red Hat 9.1 and 9.3 and 9.5, you

39:09.640 --> 39:14.120
just get those little intermediary updates as after they've been QA tested and ready

39:14.120 --> 39:15.120
to go.

39:15.120 --> 39:20.240
That's really that's the main difference, because then they build Red Hat 9.1 or 9.2

39:20.240 --> 39:21.400
from that work.

39:21.400 --> 39:22.680
So it's actually it's not bad.

39:22.680 --> 39:24.200
But Stream 8 came out.

39:24.200 --> 39:27.260
That's when they announced it during the CentOS 8 lifetime.

39:27.260 --> 39:31.320
So CentOS Stream came out and it was where they were kind of proving things out.

39:31.320 --> 39:35.220
I just talked to Carl George in Linux Action News this Sunday about this.

39:35.220 --> 39:39.600
It was like, OK, prove the theory works while you already have a distro that's been built

39:39.600 --> 39:40.720
the traditional way.

39:40.720 --> 39:43.500
Now convert that in real time to stream.

39:43.500 --> 39:49.000
So I thought I'm going to avoid that and wait for Stream 9, which just came out and is born

39:49.000 --> 39:50.880
since this whole stream idea came around.

39:50.880 --> 39:53.280
It was created as a stream first distro.

39:53.280 --> 39:56.460
It's the whole, you know, from tooling on, it's all built for this.

39:56.460 --> 40:00.880
That seemed like the distro plus it's based on Fedora 34, which is a great release of

40:00.880 --> 40:01.880
Fedora.

40:01.880 --> 40:10.280
It includes GNOME 40 and it's so it makes Stream 9 essentially an LTS Fedora.

40:10.280 --> 40:12.880
Although it doesn't have all of the kernel components to make it a great desktop, it

40:12.880 --> 40:15.720
has everything you'd really need for, you know, a development job.

40:15.720 --> 40:20.120
So Stream 9 is it just seemed like this, oh, this is going to be this moment.

40:20.120 --> 40:23.760
And I was going to migrate all of my studio machines over to Stream 9.

40:23.760 --> 40:27.920
I'd been waiting since the announcement back in December.

40:27.920 --> 40:32.720
And then it came around and I really didn't find myself all that excited.

40:32.720 --> 40:36.280
I didn't even, it didn't even occur to me to download it.

40:36.280 --> 40:40.960
And here I had been waiting for 11 months for this.

40:40.960 --> 40:46.560
And then when it finally arrived, it didn't even dawn on me to download it because I was

40:46.560 --> 40:50.320
just so disinterested now.

40:50.320 --> 40:57.140
But you know, can you guess what it is that caught my attention, which has taken my heart

40:57.140 --> 41:00.480
and has made my eye drift from CentOS?

41:00.480 --> 41:01.480
Is it SUSE?

41:01.480 --> 41:02.480
It is.

41:02.480 --> 41:03.480
Get out.

41:03.480 --> 41:06.600
I am 100% serious.

41:06.600 --> 41:07.600
Yes.

41:07.600 --> 41:13.760
I am really, really liking Tumbleweed as a server OS.

41:13.760 --> 41:14.760
Mm hmm.

41:14.760 --> 41:15.760
Wait, Tumbleweed?

41:15.760 --> 41:18.120
Oh, you're so brave.

41:18.120 --> 41:20.000
You're so courageous on the server.

41:20.000 --> 41:21.000
I'm like, no.

41:21.000 --> 41:22.000
Give me the LTS.

41:22.000 --> 41:25.960
Well, I mean, you know, we're a team of Linux guys, right?

41:25.960 --> 41:30.080
So like when things break, we usually have it fixed in like 15 minutes if they break.

41:30.080 --> 41:32.280
They're so leet.

41:32.280 --> 41:33.280
You hear the condescension?

41:33.280 --> 41:34.280
Yeah.

41:34.280 --> 41:36.100
No, it's really because I get content out of it.

41:36.100 --> 41:41.000
If I was just like hosting services for customers, I would probably go more with leet.

41:41.000 --> 41:42.960
I like that they have the option though.

41:42.960 --> 41:46.940
But because for us, it pays to be on the cutting edge.

41:46.940 --> 41:49.860
We basically do it so that way the listeners don't have to.

41:49.860 --> 41:51.560
Tumbleweed has been a surprise.

41:51.560 --> 41:55.960
One of the big shifts that I made this go is I'm not using it as a desktop, which I've

41:55.960 --> 42:02.400
always found very frustrating, but also I'm just not using Yast that much.

42:02.400 --> 42:04.080
I really don't.

42:04.080 --> 42:09.300
Where I always really hit my head against the wall with SUSE is when I am using Yast

42:09.300 --> 42:10.300
to manage software.

42:10.300 --> 42:13.680
And I am glad it's there for some people.

42:13.680 --> 42:18.880
But this time around, I went and got the zipper cheat sheet and I've kept that around and

42:18.880 --> 42:22.300
I'm doing all of my software management using zipper.

42:22.300 --> 42:26.680
It's a great example of how you can build a nice UI around a command line tool that

42:26.680 --> 42:30.540
displays information that is very easy to read for the end user.

42:30.540 --> 42:34.440
And it's easy to make decisions and weigh the pros and cons and decide what actions

42:34.440 --> 42:35.560
I should take.

42:35.560 --> 42:41.000
And that's in a nutshell what I'm really liking about SUSE is it feels like they've engineered

42:41.000 --> 42:45.720
a little bit extra on top of tools that you have to use on a frequent basis to manage

42:45.720 --> 42:52.880
your box, where Ubuntu and Arch by design, but Ubuntu specifically, it doesn't really

42:52.880 --> 42:56.440
feel like Canonical's adding value to that layer of tooling.

42:56.440 --> 42:58.380
They do have tools that are valuable.

42:58.380 --> 42:59.380
Don't get me wrong.

42:59.380 --> 43:02.100
Like they've built tooling around ZFS snapshots.

43:02.100 --> 43:06.620
They have some great tooling around firing off some quick VMs and containers and all

43:06.620 --> 43:07.620
of that.

43:07.620 --> 43:11.380
They have some good tooling, but like apt itself, that's not their domain.

43:11.380 --> 43:12.380
That's Debian's.

43:12.380 --> 43:14.360
Debian isn't changing anything, right?

43:14.360 --> 43:18.040
So it's not really going to change ever in Ubuntu until Debian does something.

43:18.040 --> 43:22.180
Where SUSE, well, they are their own upstream.

43:22.180 --> 43:26.960
And if they want their package manager to be better and give the user more information,

43:26.960 --> 43:29.000
they can just directly improve the tooling.

43:29.000 --> 43:31.460
And I think over time that's begun to add up.

43:31.460 --> 43:35.460
And so there's nice little areas where it's like, hey man, you know, you just issued this

43:35.460 --> 43:40.920
command, but on Tumbleweed for safety purposes and for recovery purposes, you probably want

43:40.920 --> 43:44.300
to use this command, but you know, your decision.

43:44.300 --> 43:46.060
And I really appreciate that kind of stuff.

43:46.060 --> 43:49.440
And it's displayed in a way where it stands out.

43:49.440 --> 43:52.720
So it draws your attention so you don't miss the information.

43:52.720 --> 43:55.740
And there's a lot of just nice things in that regard.

43:55.740 --> 43:59.020
And I have to give credit where credit is due.

43:59.020 --> 44:04.220
They were first to ButterFS at massive, massive deployment scale.

44:04.220 --> 44:08.420
And I think it was a little early when they chose to do it.

44:08.420 --> 44:12.500
But Fedora just got around to it, you know, three releases ago or so.

44:12.500 --> 44:14.520
And it's in a great state right now.

44:14.520 --> 44:19.200
And the people out there who say ButterFS is horrible, well, I think they should take

44:19.200 --> 44:20.200
another look.

44:20.200 --> 44:23.980
I grant you, for my large data sets, I still use ZFS.

44:23.980 --> 44:31.580
But for my laptop hard drive or a boot SSD or a Raspberry Pi SD card or SSD, I'm using

44:31.580 --> 44:32.860
ButterFS everywhere now.

44:32.860 --> 44:37.240
And SUSE has been building on that for so long that they have fantastic snapshot tooling

44:37.240 --> 44:38.240
built into all of it.

44:38.240 --> 44:41.620
And they're really taking advantage of the ButterFS file system in a way that some distros

44:41.620 --> 44:43.300
are just finally getting around to.

44:43.300 --> 44:44.300
I'm in shock.

44:44.300 --> 44:51.300
I mean, part of what I really like and appreciate, their Arch version is really solid.

44:51.300 --> 44:54.940
I have it running on a Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4 upstairs.

44:54.940 --> 45:00.100
I just booted that thing off a USB stick and installed it to the eMMC like it was a hard

45:00.100 --> 45:03.100
drive on a regular Intel x86 PC.

45:03.100 --> 45:09.100
I just booted off the USB stick, went through a regular install, chose the eMMC as the target

45:09.100 --> 45:10.100
disk.

45:10.100 --> 45:12.300
And my partition installed it.

45:12.300 --> 45:16.700
None of this flashing image and boot into a pre-installed, pre-configured environment

45:16.700 --> 45:20.520
that already has a login that always feels cheap on ARM devices.

45:20.520 --> 45:22.140
It was really nice.

45:22.140 --> 45:27.980
And so I can run it on my ARM VMs in Parallels on the new MacBook.

45:27.980 --> 45:30.700
And I can run it on the Compute Module 4.

45:30.700 --> 45:34.740
And I'm going to be running it on the new Jupyter Broadcasting local server.

45:34.740 --> 45:40.940
And I think what I'm thinking about doing is learning Ansible, because I've got some

45:40.940 --> 45:49.540
people like Wes who can help me, and eventually just repaving the Linode JB infrastructure,

45:49.540 --> 45:58.340
which is a mix of CentOS and Ubuntu, and redeploy it all using Ansible on SUSE potentially,

45:58.340 --> 45:59.340
if it goes well.

45:59.340 --> 46:01.620
The next test will be a local server.

46:01.620 --> 46:07.060
And if our local server turns out, well, I like it with Tumbleweed, then I think that'll

46:07.060 --> 46:12.100
be stage three will be deployed on our Linode servers.

46:12.100 --> 46:16.780
And Nuke can pave all of them and redeploy on some, maybe Tumbleweed, but maybe Leap

46:16.780 --> 46:18.380
using Ansible.

46:18.380 --> 46:21.340
Probably Leap for our cloud servers.

46:21.340 --> 46:27.660
So you were right.

46:27.660 --> 46:28.660
That's the moral of the story.

46:28.660 --> 46:31.900
The lizard people have yet another convert.

46:31.900 --> 46:32.900
Congratulations.

46:32.900 --> 46:35.540
When we restarted the show, you held strong to it.

46:35.540 --> 46:36.540
And I tease you for it.

46:36.540 --> 46:41.380
And I admit it does go off the rails when I start using Yast, but if I stay out of Yast,

46:41.380 --> 46:42.540
I'm really liking it.

46:42.540 --> 46:44.220
And yeah, I basically use it.

46:44.220 --> 46:46.740
Yeah, I think you were right there.

46:46.740 --> 46:47.740
It is.

46:47.740 --> 46:48.740
All right.

46:48.740 --> 46:52.380
Well, we got to keep an eye on this, your ongoing reptilian adventures.

46:52.380 --> 46:54.060
I'll let you know how it goes in lizard land.

46:54.060 --> 46:57.980
It may go about, if it goes poorly, I'll report back, but hopefully it doesn't.

46:57.980 --> 47:02.380
Thank you to our Coder QA members out there who joined early and made this show possible.

47:02.380 --> 47:04.220
Thank you so much for being a member.

47:04.220 --> 47:08.580
The quarterly is out, and there will be another one next quarter, and you can become a member

47:08.580 --> 47:11.680
for the show at coderqa.co.

47:11.680 --> 47:12.740
We appreciate you very much.

47:12.740 --> 47:14.720
Go find Mr. Dominic on Twitter at Dumanuku.

47:14.720 --> 47:16.820
His company is at the Mad Botter Inc.

47:16.820 --> 47:18.540
Anywhere else you want to send the folks?

47:18.540 --> 47:23.740
I'll go to alice.dev if you've got some proprietary legacy data that you want converted into something

47:23.740 --> 47:24.740
useful.

47:24.740 --> 47:25.740
You got to go to alice.dev.

47:25.740 --> 47:26.740
You got to go.

47:26.740 --> 47:27.740
You got to.

47:27.740 --> 47:29.620
The podcast here is at Coder Radio Show.

47:29.620 --> 47:31.320
I'm thinking about changing out this outro.

47:31.320 --> 47:36.460
Now that Jack's out of Twitter, why am I even plugging it anymore?

47:36.460 --> 47:38.940
Nobody even uses Twitter.

47:38.940 --> 47:40.420
Go join the Matrix.

47:40.420 --> 47:43.980
There is a Coder Radio community on our Matrix server.

47:43.980 --> 47:49.540
Our Matrix server is colony.jupiterbroadcasting.com, and it's actually pretty nice.

47:49.540 --> 47:50.540
Go hang out there.

47:50.540 --> 47:51.980
There's a persistent chat on Matrix.

47:51.980 --> 47:52.980
Want to play around with element?

47:52.980 --> 47:53.980
Now's your chance.

47:53.980 --> 47:56.940
Our server is colony.jupiterbroadcasting.com.

47:56.940 --> 48:00.220
