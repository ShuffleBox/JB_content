00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
This is Coder Radio, episode 448 for January 10th, 2022.

00:07.000 --> 00:20.160
Oh, hello and welcome into Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show, taking a pragmatic look

00:20.160 --> 00:24.680
at the art and the business of software development and the world of technology.

00:24.680 --> 00:30.320
My name is Chris and joining us every single week is our professional podcasting host,

00:30.320 --> 00:31.320
Mr. Dominic.

00:31.320 --> 00:32.320
Hello, Mike.

00:32.320 --> 00:33.320
Hello, Chris.

00:33.320 --> 00:35.220
This is my new NPR voice.

00:35.220 --> 00:37.760
Here on the show today, we're going to be very calm.

00:37.760 --> 00:38.760
Very calm.

00:38.760 --> 00:39.760
We haven't made any mistakes.

00:39.760 --> 00:42.580
There will be no mistakes in this episode because we are very professional.

00:42.580 --> 00:45.800
We definitely haven't done the four count like three times.

00:45.800 --> 00:47.920
This is like our third intro now.

00:47.920 --> 00:48.920
Totally not.

00:48.920 --> 00:53.340
When you're rounding almost 450 episodes, you know, it's just instinctual.

00:53.340 --> 00:55.640
So we can't mess up at this point.

00:55.640 --> 00:56.640
Right?

00:56.640 --> 00:57.640
It's impossible.

00:57.640 --> 00:59.080
Even our mess ups are intentional.

00:59.080 --> 01:01.400
When the president does it, it's not illegal.

01:01.400 --> 01:02.400
Yeah.

01:02.400 --> 01:04.520
Nixon became a little Irish at the end there, but I'm working on it.

01:04.520 --> 01:05.600
Nixon's going to be joining us soon.

01:05.600 --> 01:07.160
I think you could do a modern Nixon.

01:07.160 --> 01:09.080
I think I might be a modern Nixon.

01:09.080 --> 01:12.880
Got to get the peace sign going, you know, get your hands above your head, shake your

01:12.880 --> 01:13.880
hands.

01:13.880 --> 01:14.880
I am not a crook.

01:14.880 --> 01:15.880
That's actually pretty good.

01:15.880 --> 01:19.400
That might be better than your Jar Jar.

01:19.400 --> 01:23.960
As you age, the voices in your head change a bit, I'm evolving from the innocence that

01:23.960 --> 01:27.900
is Jar Jar Binks to a more cynical Richard Milhous Nixon.

01:27.900 --> 01:31.700
Which Jar Jar was inevitably going to turn into had they continued to develop his character.

01:31.700 --> 01:36.320
And not made him a very sad street clown, which is literally what they do in canon.

01:36.320 --> 01:41.880
So John wants us to kick off 2022 by going through some of our favorite Mac apps to make

01:41.880 --> 01:43.520
it a little more usable.

01:43.520 --> 01:49.120
He says, I feel like I live in a bizarro world because I'm kind of a kindred spirit to Chris

01:49.120 --> 01:56.080
where I have an M1 Mac and I also have an X1 Carbon running Linux.

01:56.080 --> 02:00.540
So I was wondering, now that you guys have spent some time on the M1 Mac, and I'll be

02:00.540 --> 02:05.100
spending more time with it over 2022, do you have like a top five must have applications

02:05.100 --> 02:09.400
to cut down on some of the Mac's rougher user interface edges?

02:09.400 --> 02:13.440
I know that the free software users out there don't like Mac OS and they don't like you

02:13.440 --> 02:19.080
talking about on the show, but I got work to do.

02:19.080 --> 02:23.660
And he wants to know what we would recommend for getting installed on the Mac for him.

02:23.660 --> 02:25.400
Number one is Parallels.

02:25.400 --> 02:27.600
Number two is Parallels Toolbox.

02:27.600 --> 02:31.400
He says it looked like an attempt to just get a subscription from me, but I found them

02:31.400 --> 02:32.900
actually to be useful.

02:32.900 --> 02:35.360
He likes Warp, that new terminal that you've been using.

02:35.360 --> 02:40.480
He uses Bitwarden for his password management and Visual Studio Code for his text editing,

02:40.480 --> 02:41.480
obviously.

02:41.480 --> 02:45.740
I didn't want to spend a lot of time on this because I don't have like a great list.

02:45.740 --> 02:51.340
I did a deep dive a little over almost two years ago now, and I came up with a bunch

02:51.340 --> 02:53.800
of good apps and a lot of those still hold.

02:53.800 --> 02:59.480
For me to make the Mac usable, I need a few things like iStat Menu, Bartender is a big

02:59.480 --> 03:00.480
one for me.

03:00.480 --> 03:04.620
It hides all of the icons up in the system menu bar that can just load up the Mac menu

03:04.620 --> 03:06.920
bar now like it's a Windows XP box.

03:06.920 --> 03:12.360
So I like Bartender quite a bit, and then Magnet for window management, so that way

03:12.360 --> 03:16.240
I can snap windows to each other and snap them to the edge and use keyboard combinations

03:16.240 --> 03:17.240
to throw them around.

03:17.240 --> 03:18.640
I like that a lot.

03:18.640 --> 03:23.120
That's probably my top list on top of what he's already listed here with Bitwarden and

03:23.120 --> 03:24.120
Parallels.

03:24.120 --> 03:27.360
Do you have any others that I'm missing that you thought makes the Mac a lot better?

03:27.360 --> 03:28.960
Yeah, so I'm right with you on that.

03:28.960 --> 03:33.200
Actually you introduced me to Bartender a month ago, a couple weeks ago, whatever.

03:33.200 --> 03:34.760
Magnet is like a must-have for me.

03:34.760 --> 03:41.120
Dash, which is a source code library management tool, I don't know how you'd call it, but

03:41.120 --> 03:45.640
it's a great indie app that basically you can keyboard shortcut like it just did and

03:45.640 --> 03:49.680
open it up and it has different doc sets for different programming languages and platforms

03:49.680 --> 03:51.400
and you can quickly look things up.

03:51.400 --> 03:54.320
I use it all the time when I'm on Mac.

03:54.320 --> 03:57.160
Warp terminal, by the way guys, thanks for the t-shirt.

03:57.160 --> 04:00.080
Apparently if you tweet at people they might send you a t-shirt.

04:00.080 --> 04:01.720
Has become my go-to terminal.

04:01.720 --> 04:02.720
Yay.

04:02.720 --> 04:08.800
I'll give a plug for Transmit when I'm looking to deal with S3 buckets or SFTP or Samba or

04:08.800 --> 04:13.800
even Dropbox and I don't want to install the client or Nextcloud, I use Transmit from Panic.

04:13.800 --> 04:17.640
Paint code actually, but that's like a way to develop it.

04:17.640 --> 04:18.880
I don't know if you've ever heard of this app.

04:18.880 --> 04:24.560
I think I mentioned it years ago from images that can generate code in Swift, Objective-C,

04:24.560 --> 04:30.800
JavaScript, C-Sharp, I think even for Unity now it does the Unity flavor of C-Sharp, so

04:30.800 --> 04:34.080
that you're basically not dealing with bitmaps.

04:34.080 --> 04:40.640
I also am using Rocket, which is a tiny little app that lets you do the Slack style emoticons

04:40.640 --> 04:41.640
anywhere.

04:41.640 --> 04:44.320
So you have colon and then you type the name like, you know, pepper.

04:44.320 --> 04:48.960
And yeah, you can do it in any app in macOS, which is just a quick way to get to emoticons

04:48.960 --> 04:50.120
if you're that kind of person.

04:50.120 --> 04:51.760
Oh, Fantastical too.

04:51.760 --> 04:52.760
Yeah.

04:52.760 --> 04:53.760
Yeah.

04:53.760 --> 04:56.360
But of all of those, I probably could not give up Magnet.

04:56.360 --> 04:57.600
Yeah.

04:57.600 --> 04:59.440
Magnet is super, super useful.

04:59.440 --> 05:04.360
I think if you've got a Mac with a notch, Bartender is kind of mandatory as well.

05:04.360 --> 05:07.840
I can't see Apple not building that in in the future now that they have a notch.

05:07.840 --> 05:08.840
Yeah.

05:08.840 --> 05:10.680
That's the problem with making Mac utility apps, isn't it?

05:10.680 --> 05:11.680
Oh, for sure.

05:11.680 --> 05:14.800
I mean, Bartender's had a good run, you know?

05:14.800 --> 05:16.240
That's been around a while.

05:16.240 --> 05:18.200
It is time to go, my friends.

05:18.200 --> 05:19.200
Yeah.

05:19.200 --> 05:20.200
Sorry, Bartender.

05:20.200 --> 05:21.200
We love you.

05:21.200 --> 05:24.480
Speaking of Mac, we didn't have this on the show, but I have been doing some Swift UI

05:24.480 --> 05:25.480
development.

05:25.480 --> 05:26.480
Oh, yeah.

05:26.480 --> 05:27.480
We talked about this a little bit off air.

05:27.480 --> 05:28.480
How is that going?

05:28.480 --> 05:30.160
I weirdly like Swift UI.

05:30.160 --> 05:31.160
I'm sorry.

05:31.160 --> 05:32.160
What?

05:32.160 --> 05:33.160
I just fell out of my chair.

05:33.160 --> 05:34.160
You'll have to say that again.

05:34.160 --> 05:35.160
I know.

05:35.160 --> 05:36.960
I actually kind of like it.

05:36.960 --> 05:37.960
Huh.

05:37.960 --> 05:41.280
Now, maybe I'll hit some wall, but it's been pretty good so far.

05:41.280 --> 05:47.600
It does have some of the, I would say, do things our way-ness that is, you know, Debra

05:47.600 --> 05:49.360
Gur for Apple.

05:49.360 --> 05:54.860
But especially to get like just a quick internal app up, it's definitely a good tool.

05:54.860 --> 05:56.360
I want to hit this pretty hard.

05:56.360 --> 05:57.360
This is iOS.

05:57.360 --> 06:00.720
I haven't tried the catalyst or the, you know, that kind of stuff yet.

06:00.720 --> 06:02.920
So you're doing this on the iPad Pro?

06:02.920 --> 06:04.480
Actually, yes.

06:04.480 --> 06:05.600
Wow.

06:05.600 --> 06:08.360
So you're helping bring that future that we fear.

06:08.360 --> 06:10.720
No, that's good.

06:10.720 --> 06:14.480
I was going to ask you to give me an elevator pitch, but I think you just did with the,

06:14.480 --> 06:16.840
it's a great way to prototype in-house apps and things like that.

06:16.840 --> 06:18.280
I could totally see that.

06:18.280 --> 06:22.260
It's interesting too, because you can bring over all the UI kit stuff by just wrapping

06:22.260 --> 06:27.000
it in a class I'm probably going to blog about called the UI representable.

06:27.000 --> 06:32.000
It may not in fact be a class and I think about it, but it's very interesting how they've,

06:32.000 --> 06:38.920
I can't say brought over, but they've made it possible to do things the old way when

06:38.920 --> 06:45.400
it makes sense, when you have something fussy that you want to do, but not make that easy

06:45.400 --> 06:49.440
enough that you wouldn't necessarily want to all the time.

06:49.440 --> 06:50.440
Sounds about right, actually.

06:50.440 --> 06:54.420
I mean, for simple views, like for instance, I've been screening around with sign in for

06:54.420 --> 07:01.200
Apple for a few things and the sign in with Apple button, it's like its own thing, is

07:01.200 --> 07:08.720
a UI kit control, then there is no Swift UI equivalent, so you have to wrap it.

07:08.720 --> 07:09.720
That's really easy, right?

07:09.720 --> 07:13.240
Because it's just like a button and you add a tap gesture and you're done.

07:13.240 --> 07:18.080
But for things that are more complex, you can get into some interesting cases.

07:18.080 --> 07:22.720
I don't know that I wouldn't just jump to Swift UI if I was making a new consumer facing

07:22.720 --> 07:23.720
iOS app.

07:23.720 --> 07:24.720
Right.

07:24.720 --> 07:29.000
If you're starting today, even if I was starting like last week, yeah, I follow you.

07:29.000 --> 07:30.240
That is an interesting moment.

07:30.240 --> 07:31.800
That's like a line that's been crossed now.

07:31.800 --> 07:36.040
I mean, I could definitely see if you're working for some digital agency and they're like their

07:36.040 --> 07:40.320
client is, I don't know, name someone who cares about the brand a lot.

07:40.320 --> 07:44.220
Nike telling them, well, we can do this real quick and Swift UI, it'll be fast and perform

07:44.220 --> 07:49.340
and be done, but you can't have your fussy, you know, whatever your weird, fussy transitions

07:49.340 --> 07:50.340
are, whatever you want.

07:50.340 --> 07:53.400
Although I'm not sure that that's a can't, I just think it's one of those things where

07:53.400 --> 07:55.800
you might want to say no because it's a pain in the butt.

07:55.800 --> 07:57.120
You don't really want to do this.

07:57.120 --> 07:58.500
It's going to be a lot of work.

07:58.500 --> 07:59.500
There is some bad here.

07:59.500 --> 08:02.040
I don't know why, but we may as well do it today, right?

08:02.040 --> 08:08.560
I don't know why Xcode hates my iMac Pro with Xeons, but it definitely does.

08:08.560 --> 08:13.560
And it makes this computer feel, this $5,000 computer feel slow.

08:13.560 --> 08:15.040
And it makes me deeply sad.

08:15.040 --> 08:17.120
It's funny how that happens.

08:17.120 --> 08:18.280
Horrifically sad.

08:18.280 --> 08:24.240
I don't understand what could possibly be happening in the background and why the builds

08:24.240 --> 08:29.320
when you do a clean build of what I consider to be not that big of an application.

08:29.320 --> 08:32.080
So how can we put this?

08:32.080 --> 08:33.720
Tortoise-like.

08:33.720 --> 08:40.360
It does make me miss the raw unbridled power that is Objective-C. But I mean, obviously

08:40.360 --> 08:44.400
I need to spend 10 grand on a MacBook Pro now because I'm not giving up Swift UI.

08:44.400 --> 08:45.800
Well, and you got to have speed.

08:45.800 --> 08:47.280
I mean, you know, I mean, let's be honest.

08:47.280 --> 08:49.520
What are you going to do, buy three iPads?

08:49.520 --> 08:53.020
I really just schedule my tea making around builds.

08:53.020 --> 08:54.020
I'm not joking.

08:54.020 --> 08:55.020
That's what I do.

08:55.020 --> 08:56.020
Yeah.

08:56.020 --> 08:57.020
Yeah.

08:57.020 --> 08:58.020
Oh man.

08:58.020 --> 08:59.020
It happens so quick.

08:59.020 --> 09:00.020
They just get obsolete so quick.

09:00.020 --> 09:02.080
Maybe listener Jacob has nailed it.

09:02.080 --> 09:05.360
He says he bought himself the M114.

09:05.360 --> 09:07.240
Listener Jacob has written into the show before.

09:07.240 --> 09:10.040
I've had an opportunity to meet him a couple of times.

09:10.040 --> 09:14.800
Tried and true open source advocate, Linux user too, but he recognizes the tool when

09:14.800 --> 09:15.840
he sees one.

09:15.840 --> 09:22.280
He says, I got the 14 inch M1 Pro and I have a workflow that almost exclusively uses the

09:22.280 --> 09:24.760
10 neural engine cores.

09:24.760 --> 09:26.080
Dying to know what that is.

09:26.080 --> 09:31.640
But Activity Monitor gives him bubkiss for utilization information.

09:31.640 --> 09:33.720
It's sort of a bummer.

09:33.720 --> 09:36.280
He wondered, do you have any thoughts?

09:36.280 --> 09:39.100
I'll tell you what the workload is here in a minute, but before I get there, do you have

09:39.100 --> 09:45.000
any thoughts on these specialized cores that we see baked in by Apple and by arm makers,

09:45.000 --> 09:49.640
but now Intel as well has announced that they plan to do specialized cores.

09:49.640 --> 09:55.280
This seems like maybe this is their solution to heat and energy consumption, right?

09:55.280 --> 09:57.280
It's just specialized devices.

09:57.280 --> 10:01.840
If you think about it, you're, especially on a notebook, your big problems are 90% of

10:01.840 --> 10:04.840
the time, most users, right?

10:04.840 --> 10:08.280
Even professional users are doing like non hardcore stuff.

10:08.280 --> 10:09.280
They're not throttled.

10:09.280 --> 10:11.440
You know, they're not pushing the throttle to the maximum.

10:11.440 --> 10:16.600
They're not whatever rendering video or compiling two files of Swift and Xcode.

10:16.600 --> 10:21.260
They're like responding to an email or writing an invoice or doing something like that, right?

10:21.260 --> 10:24.120
So those were your efficiency cores come in.

10:24.120 --> 10:26.840
I'm assuming he's doing some AI stuff.

10:26.840 --> 10:31.520
You could probably have like, and this is what the M1s do, you have like special performance

10:31.520 --> 10:34.080
cores, but like some are better for like graphical stuff.

10:34.080 --> 10:37.000
The neural engine cores are good for that kind of thing.

10:37.000 --> 10:42.840
There's raw high power cores for straight up like compiling throughput, that's not bad.

10:42.840 --> 10:48.480
I think everybody's going to have to do this and this is probably going to be the trend

10:48.480 --> 10:50.720
in hardware for the next five issues.

10:50.720 --> 10:53.400
Yeah, I totally agree.

10:53.400 --> 10:59.680
And I would have to imagine that during this transition, or maybe even after it's normal,

10:59.680 --> 11:04.800
there's going to be a lot of, well, this CPU can do this workload and this CPU is best

11:04.800 --> 11:10.480
for this workload and it's going to make comparing and contrasting these devices much, much more

11:10.480 --> 11:15.100
complicated and it really is going to force people to double down on that.

11:15.100 --> 11:19.480
It's a tool and sometimes you buy this tool for this type of job and you buy this tool

11:19.480 --> 11:21.080
for this other type of job.

11:21.080 --> 11:23.400
We're already seeing that with the new M1s, right?

11:23.400 --> 11:28.560
That for the most part, unless you are doing something rendering video or some other kind

11:28.560 --> 11:33.920
of like high intensity graphical work, you probably don't want the max, right?

11:33.920 --> 11:38.160
If you're like even like a high end fancy coffee dev, you know, who's just like likes

11:38.160 --> 11:39.160
pretty things.

11:39.160 --> 11:40.280
I don't know anybody like that.

11:40.280 --> 11:42.800
The pro is going to be more than sufficient for you.

11:42.800 --> 11:43.880
Very much so.

11:43.880 --> 11:44.880
I got the max.

11:44.880 --> 11:46.360
Yeah, but you do media stuff, right?

11:46.360 --> 11:49.440
I do, but I bet I could have got by with the pro.

11:49.440 --> 11:51.080
I really feel that way.

11:51.080 --> 11:53.280
I'm not even shitting you.

11:53.280 --> 11:55.960
I still haven't heard the fans in this thing.

11:55.960 --> 11:56.960
I still haven't.

11:56.960 --> 11:59.440
I'm not easy on it, right?

11:59.440 --> 12:05.040
I mean, I've got a lot going on, not to mention about 20 Chrome instances.

12:05.040 --> 12:08.080
I mean, it's really it's very impressive.

12:08.080 --> 12:09.880
If you want to tax it, just compile.

12:09.880 --> 12:13.480
I'll send you a repo, compile some Swift and open 20 Chrome instances.

12:13.480 --> 12:14.640
And there you go.

12:14.640 --> 12:17.960
I am telling you, I have never in my life experienced a situation where I have bought

12:17.960 --> 12:21.000
a new computer and been basically unable to max it out.

12:21.000 --> 12:23.640
I mean, I'm sure I could if I made an artificial workload.

12:23.640 --> 12:26.280
Oh, yeah, you could like whatever, right?

12:26.280 --> 12:27.880
Like DaVinci yourself to death.

12:27.880 --> 12:28.880
Yeah.

12:28.880 --> 12:30.000
I could do with something.

12:30.000 --> 12:33.200
But in my actual workload, this has never happened to me before.

12:33.200 --> 12:34.680
It's like there's just more machine.

12:34.680 --> 12:38.740
It always has more to give deal with the dumbfounding thing about this whole conversation is I feel

12:38.740 --> 12:42.340
exactly like you feel about my M1 air.

12:42.340 --> 12:47.440
It's basically toe to toe with my other than the big, big, big asterisks of I have no good

12:47.440 --> 12:51.440
way to run Windows x86 because I need Visual Studio.

12:51.440 --> 12:56.560
The reason I didn't buy a pro was I just couldn't justify it with how I mean, the air, the battery.

12:56.560 --> 13:00.880
No, today I was driving around all morning, it was just errands and I had to do some work

13:00.880 --> 13:01.880
in Plant City.

13:01.880 --> 13:06.000
I didn't even think last night if my air was charged because it's the air.

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
It's always charged and it doesn't matter.

13:08.000 --> 13:09.000
Yeah.

13:09.000 --> 13:13.640
Likewise, when I was stuck in the woods a couple of weeks ago, I didn't plan to do any

13:13.640 --> 13:14.640
shows from out there.

13:14.640 --> 13:18.400
So I had to cobble together kind of like an emergency setup that I have.

13:18.400 --> 13:27.360
And the M1 Mac Mini did the job that I'm not kidding you, three x86 PCs do in the studio.

13:27.360 --> 13:31.520
I did it with one Mac Mini and it did it sipping power.

13:31.520 --> 13:33.800
I think, you know, 25 watts of power.

13:33.800 --> 13:38.500
I can't actually understand it because it's that scale of a change.

13:38.500 --> 13:41.920
And that's the damn mini because I didn't even have my laptop with me because I didn't

13:41.920 --> 13:43.820
plan to be out there working.

13:43.820 --> 13:48.140
So I had to do it all on the mini and it does it fine.

13:48.140 --> 13:52.280
Now that is a situation where I'm near the limits of the machine, but I have not yet

13:52.280 --> 13:53.520
reached the limits of the machine.

13:53.520 --> 13:55.040
But that just kind of shows you the runway.

13:55.040 --> 13:56.040
All right.

13:56.040 --> 14:01.020
So here's what Jacob is doing with those neural cores that sounds really awesome to me.

14:01.020 --> 14:06.960
He is running Topaz in the background and he has it chewing over, see if he can see

14:06.960 --> 14:07.960
it.

14:07.960 --> 14:14.800
It's called Topaz AI Video and it's an enhancement tool that he is bringing in old low res home

14:14.800 --> 14:21.400
movies and then this AI upscaler is converting them from 480i to higher resolution and frame

14:21.400 --> 14:24.880
rates to look better on his new displays and stuff.

14:24.880 --> 14:25.880
Super neat.

14:25.880 --> 14:26.880
Well, OK, then.

14:26.880 --> 14:27.880
Yeah.

14:27.880 --> 14:31.080
And doesn't that seem like the perfect kind of use case for the neural engine?

14:31.080 --> 14:32.080
Definitely.

14:32.080 --> 14:34.740
That actually seems like something they probably designed it for.

14:34.740 --> 14:40.800
If you guys have any M1 workload tips or great Mac apps that we missed or Windows or Linux

14:40.800 --> 14:42.720
apps, always welcome as well.

14:42.720 --> 14:44.400
Coder dot show slash contact.

14:44.400 --> 14:47.080
And our last email today comes in from Jack.

14:47.080 --> 14:48.080
Just a quick one, really.

14:48.080 --> 14:52.000
He wants to know if you've really had any passing thoughts.

14:52.000 --> 14:55.640
At Flutter, if you've given it a try or have any thoughts on it, because he is thinking

14:55.640 --> 15:00.400
about making a move, especially given the recent announcement from Canonical and their

15:00.400 --> 15:04.200
use of Flutter and of course, Flutter's use in Fuchsia.

15:04.200 --> 15:10.120
And as a web developer, he started working on a mobile app and realized, geez, Dart and

15:10.120 --> 15:12.160
Flutter could be a great solution here for us.

15:12.160 --> 15:14.840
So he wanted to know if you had any thoughts on using Flutter.

15:14.840 --> 15:17.600
Yeah, we even discussed it on the show, right?

15:17.600 --> 15:21.560
And on the Mike Dominic show way back when I interviewed somebody from the Flutter team,

15:21.560 --> 15:25.240
I think Chris, I don't recall the last name, I apologize.

15:25.240 --> 15:30.040
It's certainly a good framework if you're familiar with that type of development.

15:30.040 --> 15:34.780
You know, I ended up not using it because when I was really deep into mobile, I was

15:34.780 --> 15:40.480
mostly doing Ionic, which for those who don't know is basically a well, now you could do

15:40.480 --> 15:41.480
more.

15:41.480 --> 15:43.820
It has Angular and some custom components.

15:43.820 --> 15:46.560
Now I think it does view and react as well.

15:46.560 --> 15:51.480
I'll be honest, I have a little bit of Google killed my reader PTSD.

15:51.480 --> 15:54.760
Basically every product I've liked from Google, they've killed.

15:54.760 --> 15:57.880
And when I say every, I mean, except for Gmail.

15:57.880 --> 16:00.820
So I did not choose Flutter.

16:00.820 --> 16:02.320
Having said that, Flutter has been around.

16:02.320 --> 16:06.640
I see a lot of jobs go by like contract jobs that are for Flutter.

16:06.640 --> 16:11.980
I would say it's certainly taken a pretty serious place in the, you know, I want a cross

16:11.980 --> 16:17.880
platform platform business mobile app world, probably on par with Xamarin.

16:17.880 --> 16:21.360
And you know, Xamarin has a good habit of shooting themselves in the face.

16:21.360 --> 16:24.960
What do you think of Google being the big effort behind it, the big energy instead of

16:24.960 --> 16:27.240
somebody like Microsoft or Apple?

16:27.240 --> 16:31.780
You'd have to go back like a hundred episodes or something, but I was kind of not understanding

16:31.780 --> 16:37.240
why Flutter had to use Dart instead of like JavaScript or TypeScript.

16:37.240 --> 16:40.640
It's kind of off doing its own magical little thing.

16:40.640 --> 16:42.240
And this ties into your question.

16:42.240 --> 16:44.500
And that I think the reason for that is Google made it.

16:44.500 --> 16:45.500
That's what I was thinking.

16:45.500 --> 16:49.120
You know, there was this weird time a couple of years ago where like, and I really do think

16:49.120 --> 16:53.120
it was not to get back to Apple, cause I know people hate that, that Apple envy of Apple

16:53.120 --> 16:59.240
released Swift and Google felt a lot of pressure to kind of do its own thing, right?

16:59.240 --> 17:05.040
I mean, especially at that point in time, the narrative around Android using Java was

17:05.040 --> 17:09.700
really at its peak bad because there was several solutions that Google had yet to roll out

17:09.700 --> 17:11.320
to improve the situation.

17:11.320 --> 17:15.520
So this is where things get weird because they adopted Kotlin from JetBrains for Java.

17:15.520 --> 17:16.520
Yes.

17:16.520 --> 17:18.960
And Google also, I believe, invented Angular.

17:18.960 --> 17:24.100
It's like, it's so weird to me that, you know, Ionic is this like relatively small company

17:24.100 --> 17:29.240
that already had Angular running as a really good, if you just want like line of business

17:29.240 --> 17:34.880
applications, cross-platform mobile development solution based on the open web and Angular.

17:34.880 --> 17:38.080
I always thought it was funny that Google didn't like, I don't know, just eat them,

17:38.080 --> 17:39.080
right?

17:39.080 --> 17:42.160
Just like buy them or help them in some way.

17:42.160 --> 17:45.100
Cause their whole business is they have like an enterprise plan and you can pay them to

17:45.100 --> 17:48.400
like co-sign your apps for you and all this kind of stuff.

17:48.400 --> 17:51.880
But I don't know, I guess I would turn the question around and be like, and say, all

17:51.880 --> 17:54.760
right, other than Flutter, where am I going to use Dart?

17:54.760 --> 17:56.120
And you could say the same thing about Swift, right?

17:56.120 --> 17:57.120
Other than iOS.

17:57.120 --> 18:02.040
I was going to argue with you on that last point, but I think you're probably right.

18:02.040 --> 18:06.400
Especially when you consider outside of some of these canonical and Google projects.

18:06.400 --> 18:07.840
Google and canonical.

18:07.840 --> 18:11.640
That's like the Jack the Ripper and Ted Bundy of killing things.

18:11.640 --> 18:17.000
I'm not sure that I would necessarily base any major risk on that.

18:17.000 --> 18:18.000
Sorry.

18:18.000 --> 18:22.880
I mean, how the hell does Google ever solve this problem?

18:22.880 --> 18:24.680
I'm still mad about what the hell was it?

18:24.680 --> 18:25.680
Not Google work.

18:25.680 --> 18:26.680
Google.

18:26.680 --> 18:27.680
Wave.

18:27.680 --> 18:28.680
Wave.

18:28.680 --> 18:29.680
Thank you.

18:29.680 --> 18:30.680
The one I'm always bitching about.

18:30.680 --> 18:31.680
Wave.

18:31.680 --> 18:32.680
That's because we, I think for just a brief minute, I know we did it with some of the

18:32.680 --> 18:33.680
shows.

18:33.680 --> 18:34.680
We probably did it with Coder.

18:34.680 --> 18:35.680
We experimented with using it.

18:35.680 --> 18:36.680
We had a wave.

18:36.680 --> 18:37.680
Yep.

18:37.680 --> 18:38.680
And it was actually really useful for show prep.

18:38.680 --> 18:39.680
It's like what Slack should be.

18:39.680 --> 18:40.680
Oh, right.

18:40.680 --> 18:41.680
It was before Slack.

18:41.680 --> 18:43.240
It was way before Slack.

18:43.240 --> 18:44.240
Right.

18:44.240 --> 18:48.880
Because Slack has yet to like hit 10% of what wave was and Google was like, nah, no, we're

18:48.880 --> 18:49.880
done.

18:49.880 --> 18:50.880
We're done.

18:50.880 --> 18:51.880
We're done.

18:51.880 --> 18:54.800
It's, it's been a year and you know how we are.

18:54.800 --> 18:58.200
We can't take it.

18:58.200 --> 18:59.640
Linode.com slash Coder.

18:59.640 --> 19:03.720
Go there to get $100 in 60 day credit on a new account and you go there to support the

19:03.720 --> 19:04.720
show.

19:04.720 --> 19:06.360
Linode is fast and reliable cloud hosting.

19:06.360 --> 19:07.360
Full stop.

19:07.360 --> 19:09.840
Just use it for your next project and see what I'm talking about.

19:09.840 --> 19:11.840
It's always what I use for my projects.

19:11.840 --> 19:17.800
Everything I've built for the last couple of years, it's been on Linode and easily Linode

19:17.800 --> 19:19.200
just keeps getting better.

19:19.200 --> 19:23.000
I mean, it's not, it's not even a contest when you look at the other folks out there.

19:23.000 --> 19:25.880
Linode is constantly pushing the envelope for performance.

19:25.880 --> 19:27.460
That's one of the reasons I love them.

19:27.460 --> 19:31.280
And they've just rolled out game changing MVME PCIe storage.

19:31.280 --> 19:33.800
They have AMD epic processors.

19:33.800 --> 19:37.720
They are their own ISP.

19:37.720 --> 19:38.720
You see what I'm saying?

19:38.720 --> 19:39.720
It's, it's ridiculous.

19:39.720 --> 19:45.300
So if you're a performance hound, man, the reasons to use Linode are just obvious, but

19:45.300 --> 19:48.840
maybe, maybe you're a little more practical.

19:48.840 --> 19:51.640
Maybe you pick things because they're well priced.

19:51.640 --> 19:53.480
Maybe you pick things because they're well supported.

19:53.480 --> 19:55.640
Well, Linode checks those boxes too.

19:55.640 --> 19:57.240
They've been doing this for 18 years.

19:57.240 --> 20:00.720
So over that time they've had to figure out how to get it right and they've remained the

20:00.720 --> 20:03.480
largest independent cloud provider in the world.

20:03.480 --> 20:08.580
In fact, I would encourage you to consider Linode for a multi-cloud strategy.

20:08.580 --> 20:12.680
Maybe you've already got some infrastructure on some of the big hyperscalers.

20:12.680 --> 20:16.320
Well Linode's 30 to 50% cheaper than those hyperscalers.

20:16.320 --> 20:19.840
Maybe there's a bit of your infrastructure that would be a little better off in a multi-cloud

20:19.840 --> 20:20.840
environment.

20:20.840 --> 20:25.680
A lot of companies are doing that over 2022 and Linode is one of the best out there.

20:25.680 --> 20:29.680
They have a white paper on their site that looks at an analysis of the market when you're

20:29.680 --> 20:31.680
in a multi-cloud setup.

20:31.680 --> 20:35.880
It could help you figure out some of the real numbers behind a move like this.

20:35.880 --> 20:40.880
And I hear from our listeners all the time that when it really matters, Linode's customer

20:40.880 --> 20:43.180
support comes through.

20:43.180 --> 20:45.880
There's no forwarding you to the next tier.

20:45.880 --> 20:49.520
Let me put you on hold while I check with my supervisor.

20:49.520 --> 20:51.320
That's not how they work over there.

20:51.320 --> 20:56.120
You call them, you send a ticket in, however you like to work, they get somebody on it

20:56.120 --> 20:58.520
24-7 and they take care of you.

20:58.520 --> 21:01.440
On top of that, they've got 11 data centers around the world for you to choose from.

21:01.440 --> 21:06.360
They have object storage, cloud firewall, backups, and a lot more.

21:06.360 --> 21:11.400
So go build something, go learn something, try it for yourself, and support the show.

21:11.400 --> 21:12.560
Linode.com slash coder.

21:12.560 --> 21:16.520
Get $100 in 60-day credit and kick the tires for yourself.

21:16.520 --> 21:21.680
Linode.com slash coder.

21:21.680 --> 21:26.360
Well the story that probably got sent to me the most this week is this developer who corrupted

21:26.360 --> 21:30.680
that MPM library that, it's two actually, Colors and Faker.

21:30.680 --> 21:31.680
My homie.

21:31.680 --> 21:32.920
I love this.

21:32.920 --> 21:36.760
This is some gangster ass right here.

21:36.760 --> 21:37.760
That's what's up.

21:37.760 --> 21:40.860
I mean, I feel real bad for people, but okay, here's the highlights.

21:40.860 --> 21:47.220
This first random bleeping computer, they found that two libraries that a specific developer

21:47.220 --> 21:50.760
was responsible for had new commits.

21:50.760 --> 21:57.000
He added the quote, new American flag module to colors.js yesterday or the day before as

21:57.000 --> 21:58.000
we're recording.

21:58.000 --> 21:59.000
Yes.

21:59.000 --> 22:00.560
Then pushed it up to GitHub and MPM.

22:00.560 --> 22:05.980
They were sabotaged and it ended up doing a loop output of strange letters and symbols

22:05.980 --> 22:12.240
that began with texts that reads Liberty, Liberty, Liberty, and then loops over and

22:12.240 --> 22:13.240
over again.

22:13.240 --> 22:20.320
Now to put this in perspective, Faker.js sees nearly 2.5 million weekly downloads on MPM

22:20.320 --> 22:28.420
and Color.js gets about 22.4 million downloads per week.

22:28.420 --> 22:30.400
This is not small stuff.

22:30.400 --> 22:34.020
It's baked into some of the Amazon cloud development kits.

22:34.020 --> 22:38.120
So some of the very first reports came from Amazon cloud developers.

22:38.120 --> 22:44.420
It seems the reason behind the quote mischief as bleeping computer puts it is that the developer

22:44.420 --> 22:50.600
was retaliating against mega corporations and commercial consumers of open source projects

22:50.600 --> 22:55.800
who extensively rely on cost free and community powered software, but do not, according to

22:55.800 --> 22:58.500
that developer, give back to the community.

22:58.500 --> 23:03.020
In November of 2020, the developer warned that he would no longer be supporting the

23:03.020 --> 23:08.140
big corporations with his quote free work and that commercial entities should consider

23:08.140 --> 23:14.640
either forking the projects or compensating the dev with a yearly quote six figure salary.

23:14.640 --> 23:20.220
He says, quote, respectfully, I'm no longer going to support Fortune 500 and other small

23:20.220 --> 23:22.520
sized companies with my free work.

23:22.520 --> 23:26.320
There just isn't much else to say, end quote.

23:26.320 --> 23:32.680
And fast forward about a year and a couple of months and it's American flag module time

23:32.680 --> 23:37.840
and liberty, liberty, liberty and a bunch of looping crazy output that developers had

23:37.840 --> 23:40.340
no idea where it was coming from.

23:40.340 --> 23:44.840
And the internet is split right down the middle on this one.

23:44.840 --> 23:49.120
Some in the open source community are calling him a hero, bringing attention to a desperate

23:49.120 --> 23:54.280
cause and others are calling him essentially a software terrorist that should be banned.

23:54.280 --> 23:55.360
Where do you lie?

23:55.360 --> 23:57.520
So there's more to the story, right?

23:57.520 --> 24:00.660
Before we before we land on all right, yeah, fill in more.

24:00.660 --> 24:05.720
So MPM reverted the change he made and then GitHub suspended his account, right?

24:05.720 --> 24:07.640
He also has like 100 private repos.

24:07.640 --> 24:10.680
Now I am looking at his account right now.

24:10.680 --> 24:12.200
It appears to be up.

24:12.200 --> 24:16.440
It would be great to get some confirmation is when they say this is they suspended his

24:16.440 --> 24:20.360
access, but they left it up so that other people can use this private repos.

24:20.360 --> 24:21.880
That seems super.

24:21.880 --> 24:23.800
Also like where is the line there?

24:23.800 --> 24:24.800
Also it's his.

24:24.800 --> 24:25.800
Right?

24:25.800 --> 24:27.720
Does he not have the right to destroy his own stuff?

24:27.720 --> 24:28.720
Apparently not.

24:28.720 --> 24:33.440
Apparently he has the right to use the service as long as he's being a good boy that's productive

24:33.440 --> 24:35.600
that corporate America could make money off of.

24:35.600 --> 24:39.800
But the moment he starts creating something unproductive, they block him.

24:39.800 --> 24:42.040
Yeah, it's pretty hard to see it any other way.

24:42.040 --> 24:45.800
Now sure, he's doing malicious stuff and they probably want to take actions to ensure the

24:45.800 --> 24:47.980
trust in their own platform.

24:47.980 --> 24:52.900
But man, shutting him down like this and not giving him access to now his own stuff.

24:52.900 --> 24:56.640
It really reminds you why if something really matters to you on the Internet, you need to

24:56.640 --> 24:57.840
host it yourself.

24:57.840 --> 25:00.960
Just like my GitLab instance, you just do it yourself guys.

25:00.960 --> 25:01.960
Yeah.

25:01.960 --> 25:02.960
Interesting.

25:02.960 --> 25:04.880
There's an interesting couple of meta layers to this, I think.

25:04.880 --> 25:10.560
I mean, you do have the people that are saying he's like, you know, a flame out kind of punk.

25:10.560 --> 25:13.520
Essentially software terrorism is what some people are saying on Twitter.

25:13.520 --> 25:17.800
And then you have the other side that says it's getting to be a desperate situation.

25:17.800 --> 25:19.920
He had a plea for help.

25:19.920 --> 25:21.920
Nobody stepped up.

25:21.920 --> 25:23.040
What is he going to do?

25:23.040 --> 25:26.980
And you got to figure like, there's probably a pretty considerable emotional strain for

25:26.980 --> 25:29.040
somebody in this situation.

25:29.040 --> 25:33.640
They are on the verge of burnout constantly.

25:33.640 --> 25:35.080
They're struggling financially.

25:35.080 --> 25:38.360
They probably can't get their life together because they're torn between too many different

25:38.360 --> 25:39.360
priorities.

25:39.360 --> 25:42.080
I mean, you could really kind of see how this person may have been going through a year

25:42.080 --> 25:43.960
and change of health.

25:43.960 --> 25:46.680
And this was sort of a breaking point for them.

25:46.680 --> 25:48.240
And I have a hard time getting angry at them.

25:48.240 --> 25:50.920
Yeah, no, I'm totally like on the side of this dude.

25:50.920 --> 25:55.480
We have come close to this and I know that with all the Mac love and all that stuff,

25:55.480 --> 26:00.200
it's going to be, oh, we're going to get some bad feedback, but the current model of open

26:00.200 --> 26:03.260
source just isn't working right.

26:03.260 --> 26:10.340
This guy, his package underpins so many projects and he doesn't make a dime.

26:10.340 --> 26:12.880
And then he goes and says, hey, and somebody needs to pay me.

26:12.880 --> 26:18.840
And because there is no legal obligation to pay for his labor, he just, it's crickets.

26:18.840 --> 26:24.840
And let's not forget, like one of the more popular ways that this stuff is used is in

26:24.840 --> 26:30.760
the Amazon web development kit, which is something that Amazon puts together to make it easier

26:30.760 --> 26:34.740
for developers to create applications on their platform so they can make money.

26:34.740 --> 26:36.760
So Amazon can make money.

26:36.760 --> 26:38.060
Let's not confuse this at all.

26:38.060 --> 26:42.820
The entire reason a company like Amazon puts together a well done SDK is to make it approachable

26:42.820 --> 26:43.820
by developers.

26:43.820 --> 26:46.280
Well, why do they want to make it approachable by developers?

26:46.280 --> 26:48.640
So they can make money.

26:48.640 --> 26:52.600
I mean, I don't know what to say and I don't know this guy from Adam.

26:52.600 --> 26:59.580
He maybe has some other crazy ideas, who the hell knows, but the argument at hand of should

26:59.580 --> 27:04.700
people be giving multibillion dollar corporations their labor for free.

27:04.700 --> 27:08.400
And I know we're going to get a lot of for this, but wasn't it just like two months ago,

27:08.400 --> 27:12.420
people were yelling at us for being rapacious capitalists, right?

27:12.420 --> 27:15.860
And I'm basically here picking up my hammer and sickle and be like, no, I don't care if

27:15.860 --> 27:19.180
this dude did it in kind of a douchebaggy way.

27:19.180 --> 27:20.180
The man is right.

27:20.180 --> 27:21.280
He needs to be paid.

27:21.280 --> 27:25.140
The lesson I learned from this, or I would suggest, I mean, I already knew this, but

27:25.140 --> 27:30.420
I would suggest that younger folks maybe pick up ideals are great until you have to pay

27:30.420 --> 27:33.780
the rent and your kid needs the doctor, right?

27:33.780 --> 27:39.460
I'm always banging the open core drum, but honestly, it's easier just to be proprietary.

27:39.460 --> 27:44.820
How many times have you read on Reddit or have you covered on your other shows and end

27:44.820 --> 27:45.820
this show?

27:45.820 --> 27:50.140
Oh, there's some open source project, but the developers stressed out.

27:50.140 --> 27:52.100
So he's just, you know, he's looking for money.

27:52.100 --> 27:53.100
He's doing a patron.

27:53.100 --> 27:58.060
Now he's going to chuck deuces and the project is screwed and people are screwed over.

27:58.060 --> 28:03.700
The solution to that is the richer organizations using these projects need to pay him.

28:03.700 --> 28:05.700
And the answer isn't some tip jar.

28:05.700 --> 28:09.600
It isn't a sponsor button on GitHub, which by the way, is a centralized platform owned

28:09.600 --> 28:10.600
by Microsoft guys.

28:10.600 --> 28:11.600
So again, nice.

28:11.600 --> 28:13.100
You guys make a lot of sense.

28:13.100 --> 28:15.700
Yeah, he would have been screwed if that was his funding model right now.

28:15.700 --> 28:16.700
Yeah.

28:16.700 --> 28:18.380
I hope he had a self hosted.

28:18.380 --> 28:23.580
I mean, more and more I'm becoming like a live in the woods with the lady jubes, right?

28:23.580 --> 28:29.260
And just self self host everything because it's getting to the point of what if this

28:29.260 --> 28:34.740
guy, I don't know what this guy does financially, but he says he has 100 private repos.

28:34.740 --> 28:37.340
What if they're like repos for clients?

28:37.340 --> 28:42.460
Is he going to just get his ass suited to oblivion because he not only cannot do the

28:42.460 --> 28:47.980
work for them now, if he doesn't have another local backup, their IP is just lost in this

28:47.980 --> 28:50.020
weird terms of service violation.

28:50.020 --> 28:54.660
And by the way, what possible terms of service could there be that says you cannot alter

28:54.660 --> 29:00.180
code that you own the copyright for, even if the alteration affects other people?

29:00.180 --> 29:05.340
Every open source license I've seen says this code is provided as is with absolutely no

29:05.340 --> 29:06.340
warranty.

29:06.340 --> 29:10.540
If you've ever booted up a Debian or Ubuntu box, that's what it says right there.

29:10.540 --> 29:12.740
I'm struck by those questions.

29:12.740 --> 29:18.460
I'm sure GitHub probably has answers, but I would imagine it comes down to people saw

29:18.460 --> 29:19.620
this as a GitHub issue.

29:19.620 --> 29:24.400
If you look at the trajectory of tickets that came in after this commit was made, it was

29:24.400 --> 29:27.980
Amazon cloud developers asking GitHub what's wrong.

29:27.980 --> 29:32.700
That's that's so I think that may have been like the beginning context from which they

29:32.700 --> 29:33.700
worked from.

29:33.700 --> 29:36.380
I remember GitHub is Microsoft.

29:36.380 --> 29:40.620
It still feels like Microsoft and Amazon want this to shut up and go away.

29:40.620 --> 29:42.760
I have a broader thought on this.

29:42.760 --> 29:47.260
When you look at what what how these tools like we have to acknowledge that this isn't

29:47.260 --> 29:52.580
also the shadow of log4j that we're still dealing with right now.

29:52.580 --> 29:55.860
Listeners of this show are still sorting through log4j.

29:55.860 --> 29:56.900
For sure, for sure.

29:56.900 --> 30:03.900
I look at some of these these lower level tools and libraries as infrastructure code.

30:03.900 --> 30:11.660
As a business, I pay taxes to my local city and that helps pave the roads, make sure that

30:11.660 --> 30:14.220
people can actually get to the business.

30:14.220 --> 30:15.460
It's sort of that basic stuff.

30:15.460 --> 30:20.620
I pay taxes to my city and the city takes care of some of the things that make it possible

30:20.620 --> 30:23.180
for me to have a business.

30:23.180 --> 30:26.820
We need to think about this infrastructure code in sort of a similar thing.

30:26.820 --> 30:36.020
It's not that this developer is due some percentage of Amazon's revenues, but at the same time

30:36.020 --> 30:41.600
he's paving the roads that Amazon's trucks are driving on in the cloud and he should

30:41.600 --> 30:43.140
get something for that.

30:43.140 --> 30:49.220
We've got to think about this in a way that is actually going to solve the problem.

30:49.220 --> 30:54.740
I see one large obstacle that I can't really figure out a way to route around because I

30:54.740 --> 31:02.660
think it's too late and I think it's also this phenomenon, this issue has created a

31:02.660 --> 31:06.740
distorted market for Linux and free software development.

31:06.740 --> 31:09.660
So let me back up one more time and then I'll explain all what I'm talking about.

31:09.660 --> 31:15.020
I would describe free software development as a very organic process.

31:15.020 --> 31:19.660
You can have lots of forks, many different people trying the same thing and over a 20

31:19.660 --> 31:24.940
year time period, the strongest survive, things sort of shake out.

31:24.940 --> 31:29.620
You look back at the last, you know, 15, 20 years of Linux and free software, that's clearly

31:29.620 --> 31:30.940
the case.

31:30.940 --> 31:35.940
It's often an area of in present day, an area of complaint and criticism.

31:35.940 --> 31:40.600
Oh, there's so many desktop environments or we have so many ways of doing X, but then

31:40.600 --> 31:46.780
as time moves on, organically things either come together or the strongest survive.

31:46.780 --> 31:50.380
It's a lot like evolution, free software development.

31:50.380 --> 31:59.540
When the cloud became the obvious money maker in Linux, we started to have a centralization

31:59.540 --> 32:01.540
of resources.

32:01.540 --> 32:09.700
We started to have some development become very, very lucrative and other kinds of development

32:09.700 --> 32:13.180
that, quote, have no money in it.

32:13.180 --> 32:18.860
We started to see this management of the ecosystem.

32:18.860 --> 32:24.060
We started to see a third party declare some projects winners by financing them and others

32:24.060 --> 32:27.180
losers by ignoring them.

32:27.180 --> 32:30.540
And this of course is the Linux Foundation.

32:30.540 --> 32:37.300
The Linux Foundation has added significant centralization to what was a totally organic

32:37.300 --> 32:41.220
ecosystem and they've picked winners and losers.

32:41.220 --> 32:46.860
And because they are human and they have limits, they can't find every little infrastructure

32:46.860 --> 32:52.460
project that's popular on MPM or somewhere else in the ecosystem and slide a foundation

32:52.460 --> 32:54.160
underneath them and help support them.

32:54.160 --> 32:56.220
It's just an impossible task.

32:56.220 --> 32:59.580
But because that's where all the money is centralized and you look at all these large

32:59.580 --> 33:05.020
commercial companies from Dell to Amazon that are all members, all paying members of the

33:05.020 --> 33:08.360
Linux Foundation, that's where their money is going.

33:08.360 --> 33:12.180
It's not going to open collective, it's not going to build out a digital payment system

33:12.180 --> 33:16.840
that rewards developers based on their contributions to a project, none of that.

33:16.840 --> 33:21.120
It's going to the Linux Foundation, they're picking the winners and the losers.

33:21.120 --> 33:28.340
And because their scope can only be so wide, we keep having these log4js or colors.js or

33:28.340 --> 33:33.460
whatever it might be that get screwed and left out because they just weren't in the

33:33.460 --> 33:36.820
purvey of the all carrying Linux Foundation.

33:36.820 --> 33:41.800
And it also has distorted the economics of free software development such that really

33:41.800 --> 33:47.460
the only place to make money is wherever these corporations that are part of the Linux Foundation

33:47.460 --> 33:50.780
are presently interested in, which is often like the cloud right now or something like

33:50.780 --> 33:51.780
that.

33:51.780 --> 33:55.880
And outside of that, nothing pays in Linux and in free software.

33:55.880 --> 33:59.180
You could argue it's good in some ways because at least some people are getting paid and

33:59.180 --> 34:04.220
there's at least a foundation that's orchestrating some of this, but with the good, there always

34:04.220 --> 34:05.480
comes the bad.

34:05.480 --> 34:11.500
And I believe, having watched all of this for a while, that's the bad, is we've kind

34:11.500 --> 34:16.320
of done a go-all-in, one-size-fits-all solution with the Linux Foundation now, which has become

34:16.320 --> 34:21.860
massive, and we've centralized resources.

34:21.860 --> 34:23.500
And I think this kind of thing is the result.

34:23.500 --> 34:26.140
And I don't think we can solve that, to be honest with you.

34:26.140 --> 34:28.900
I think that ship has sailed in Linux land.

34:28.900 --> 34:34.540
The world has changed so much from the founding of, I can't even pronounce it, Gnusys, where

34:34.540 --> 34:35.540
was it?

34:35.540 --> 34:37.860
They were a contemporary of original Red Hat.

34:37.860 --> 34:38.860
Oh, geez.

34:38.860 --> 34:39.860
I don't remember.

34:39.860 --> 34:40.860
I don't remember how they pronounce it.

34:40.860 --> 34:42.520
It's like some play on GNU.

34:42.520 --> 34:49.460
And those few companies that were working in open source and weirdly, it was a community.

34:49.460 --> 34:54.860
They were competitors in some ways, but since they were all working on the core Linux project

34:54.860 --> 35:00.380
or certain core projects, like the C compiler, it was a community of these little companies

35:00.380 --> 35:01.660
that could all work together in individuals.

35:01.660 --> 35:03.140
And it was great.

35:03.140 --> 35:04.940
People had ways to make money.

35:04.940 --> 35:07.860
And in particular, that was setting up like web service hosting.

35:07.860 --> 35:12.780
Now with the cloud, I know people are going to hate this, it is effectively free labor

35:12.780 --> 35:15.300
for these huge companies.

35:15.300 --> 35:16.300
It just is.

35:16.300 --> 35:18.260
Do the results seem to speak for themselves, don't they?

35:18.260 --> 35:19.260
Right.

35:19.260 --> 35:21.260
They get to charge you for the cloud server.

35:21.260 --> 35:25.660
And I've read the feedback, I've read the tweets, I've read the hacker news.

35:25.660 --> 35:28.860
This guy does not need to be the most savory guy on the planet.

35:28.860 --> 35:34.180
In fact, he can kind of be someone that maybe I wouldn't want to get a beer with, right?

35:34.180 --> 35:36.540
To actually be correct in his argument.

35:36.540 --> 35:38.300
Yeah, those two things can be true.

35:38.300 --> 35:44.700
People who maybe are slightly unpleasant can also be correct.

35:44.700 --> 35:47.340
So his method, I don't know if I agree with it.

35:47.340 --> 35:52.780
Some of his kind of other things about like Aaron Schwartz and stuff I've read of his,

35:52.780 --> 35:56.020
I definitely wouldn't go down that track with him.

35:56.020 --> 36:02.500
But this, this problem is real and it's also real for tens of thousands, if not hundreds

36:02.500 --> 36:07.820
of thousands of other developers who have written projects that are day-to-day important

36:07.820 --> 36:12.100
to these multi-billion dollar corporations and get diddly squat for it.

36:12.100 --> 36:16.620
And I acknowledge if we were working on a project and we woke up one morning and Liberty,

36:16.620 --> 36:19.940
Liberty, Liberty was scrolling across the screen in an infinite loop, that'd be very

36:19.940 --> 36:20.940
frustrating.

36:20.940 --> 36:21.940
Oh, I'd be super mad.

36:21.940 --> 36:23.140
But it's not an impossible problem.

36:23.140 --> 36:24.140
You can roll back.

36:24.140 --> 36:25.980
And he had no real recourse either.

36:25.980 --> 36:29.260
I mean, chiding Mike, you know, would be like, well, then maybe you shouldn't have made it

36:29.260 --> 36:30.640
open source.

36:30.640 --> 36:36.460
And then it wouldn't have gotten the adoption and you know, he wouldn't have people talking

36:36.460 --> 36:37.460
about him on podcasts.

36:37.460 --> 36:38.460
Right?

36:38.460 --> 36:39.460
That's true.

36:39.460 --> 36:40.460
It worked.

36:40.460 --> 36:43.020
At some point it needs to turn into cheese for the kids.

36:43.020 --> 36:44.020
That's all I'm saying.

36:44.020 --> 36:45.020
Right?

36:45.020 --> 36:46.240
It's got to turn into money.

36:46.240 --> 36:51.740
And I really hope this doesn't turn into another, well, the culture and the ethos of the software

36:51.740 --> 36:53.620
development community are definitely changing.

36:53.620 --> 36:56.200
They've definitely been changing.

36:56.200 --> 37:02.660
And because this person carries himself apparently in a way that's definitely a little off with

37:02.660 --> 37:08.340
that, that we're going to just once again say, la de la de la, keep on making billions

37:08.340 --> 37:14.860
AWS and, you know, Azure and Linux foundation, all those guys, screw the individual developer.

37:14.860 --> 37:17.420
Oh, well, he should have sold consulting.

37:17.420 --> 37:18.420
Right?

37:18.420 --> 37:19.420
That's like always the answer.

37:19.420 --> 37:20.420
Well, you could be a consultant.

37:20.420 --> 37:22.660
What if you don't like want to be a consultant?

37:22.660 --> 37:28.260
Or if you don't want to go for AWS, what if because of his personality and how it's spoken

37:28.260 --> 37:33.140
he is and perhaps controversial, he couldn't pass the Amazon interview, right?

37:33.140 --> 37:34.140
I could see that.

37:34.140 --> 37:35.140
Yeah.

37:35.140 --> 37:36.140
And it's still clearly valuable work.

37:36.140 --> 37:40.900
Also pin your damn version numbers and your, and your MPM builds and all your dependency

37:40.900 --> 37:41.900
management stuff.

37:41.900 --> 37:46.540
I was thinking that could be a whole angle we take on this is like, what the hell?

37:46.540 --> 37:47.540
Yeah.

37:47.540 --> 37:51.660
I understand you're upset and I would be super angry too, but this is kind of your fault

37:51.660 --> 37:52.660
too.

37:52.660 --> 37:53.660
Yeah.

37:53.660 --> 37:54.660
That's why I figured maybe we shouldn't go too hard.

37:54.660 --> 37:56.220
Cause like they've had a, they've had a bad day already.

37:56.220 --> 38:00.220
So you tell me not to go hard after you excoriate the Linux foundation.

38:00.220 --> 38:01.220
Yeah.

38:01.220 --> 38:02.660
Well, you know, I've been, you just think about it.

38:02.660 --> 38:05.580
It seems like what's going on, you know, you centralize the power and the wealth.

38:05.580 --> 38:06.580
That's what happens.

38:06.580 --> 38:07.580
Comrades.

38:07.580 --> 38:09.660
I will take any apology emails from the other month right now.

38:09.660 --> 38:13.060
If you want to sell them.

38:13.060 --> 38:18.420
Hey, just for a limited time, we're going to have the random swag bags up at Jupiter

38:18.420 --> 38:19.420
garage.

38:19.420 --> 38:22.580
We're going to clear a little bit so that way we can clear out and make room for new

38:22.580 --> 38:23.580
stuff.

38:23.580 --> 38:27.740
But we still have a few of the Jupiter rocket journals left.

38:27.740 --> 38:30.820
If you get a random swag bag, you can get one in there.

38:30.820 --> 38:34.200
We have two colors and it's just kind of random which one you get, but you can also buy the

38:34.200 --> 38:35.200
journal separately.

38:35.200 --> 38:41.040
We still have a few actually probably about, well, I would say just under 15 left.

38:41.040 --> 38:44.060
So there's enough out there for a few of you to, if you're, if you get this after the episodes

38:44.060 --> 38:48.020
come out, you can go grab them before we shut it down for a little bit.

38:48.020 --> 38:51.740
And you know, the fun way to do it is to get the random swag bag, cause then you get like

38:51.740 --> 38:56.100
stuff that we've got that are in the inventory for like stickers or maybe a shirt or maybe

38:56.100 --> 38:57.620
a few things like that.

38:57.620 --> 39:04.520
It works out to be a pretty good value and it's all up at Jupiter garage.com.

39:04.520 --> 39:06.180
The feedback on this is going to be amazing.

39:06.180 --> 39:10.820
This is going to be a rough episode for that poor, for the poor fireside email.

39:10.820 --> 39:11.820
I know.

39:11.820 --> 39:15.020
I decided to bedazzle my soapbox to make it nice and special.

39:15.020 --> 39:17.460
Is it blue bedazzled perhaps blue and green?

39:17.460 --> 39:18.460
Yeah.

39:18.460 --> 39:19.460
Oh, green.

39:19.460 --> 39:20.460
Yeah.

39:20.460 --> 39:21.460
The green ones I got to get rid of.

39:21.460 --> 39:22.460
Yeah.

39:22.460 --> 39:28.580
So the wall street journal wrote a piece this week that is a real, a real stinker.

39:28.580 --> 39:29.860
I just hate this.

39:29.860 --> 39:38.340
It's teens dread the green text bubble and it's all about how it's a form of phone elitism

39:38.340 --> 39:40.700
because they have blue message bubbles.

39:40.700 --> 39:48.220
And then in a really gross way, Google's official Android account on Twitter tweeted the following

39:48.220 --> 39:53.020
after the article was posted, sort of like doubling down on the opportunity quote, I

39:53.020 --> 39:57.860
message should not benefit from bullying.

39:57.860 --> 40:02.660
Texting should bring us together and the solution exists.

40:02.660 --> 40:04.940
Let's fix this as one industry.

40:04.940 --> 40:06.980
And then two heart emojis.

40:06.980 --> 40:12.980
What's wrong with us where we consider blue and green bubbles and text message at a form

40:12.980 --> 40:13.980
of bullying.

40:13.980 --> 40:16.120
Now what is going on?

40:16.120 --> 40:20.060
If you are a teenage listener of this show, please do you need parental permission?

40:20.060 --> 40:21.060
I don't know.

40:21.060 --> 40:22.060
I don't know how that works.

40:22.060 --> 40:23.060
I guess.

40:23.060 --> 40:24.060
Get it.

40:24.060 --> 40:29.660
Email in if you're sitting in a dark room crying because you are sending green bubbles

40:29.660 --> 40:30.660
to people.

40:30.660 --> 40:31.660
Is this serious?

40:31.660 --> 40:32.900
Is this serious?

40:32.900 --> 40:34.020
I know.

40:34.020 --> 40:39.540
And what I mean, you know, it really upsets me about it is that Google has created this

40:39.540 --> 40:41.540
problem.

40:41.540 --> 40:47.700
Google currently runs by my count eight different messaging service and they're all bad.

40:47.700 --> 40:48.700
They're all bad.

40:48.700 --> 40:50.900
And that's not even counting duo and their video.

40:50.900 --> 40:52.540
I'm saying just text messaging.

40:52.540 --> 40:55.860
Do you know what wasn't bad wave?

40:55.860 --> 41:00.040
I know they're pushing RCS now, but RCS is not a global standard.

41:00.040 --> 41:01.460
I think it's here in the States.

41:01.460 --> 41:03.540
I think it's in Australia.

41:03.540 --> 41:04.540
And that might be it.

41:04.540 --> 41:05.540
I don't know.

41:05.540 --> 41:06.540
It might be in Canada.

41:06.540 --> 41:10.340
You can't switch an entire platform to a standard that does not exist.

41:10.340 --> 41:12.260
No, you can do it like twice a year.

41:12.260 --> 41:17.620
They've proven that I cannot believe that Google hasn't gotten this better.

41:17.620 --> 41:21.660
Like Google has too many messaging services has been a meme for four years now and it's

41:21.660 --> 41:22.700
only worse.

41:22.700 --> 41:25.820
You know, they have a chat system inside Google photos.

41:25.820 --> 41:26.820
I sure do.

41:26.820 --> 41:29.740
Did you know that they have a chat system inside Google Pay?

41:29.740 --> 41:30.740
I did not know that.

41:30.740 --> 41:34.260
There's also a chat, different chat system inside Google stadia Jesus.

41:34.260 --> 41:37.140
And when you use Google assistant to send a message, that's a different system.

41:37.140 --> 41:39.380
Did they have one that was just like G chat?

41:39.380 --> 41:40.380
That's gone now.

41:40.380 --> 41:43.700
But Google chat and Hangouts is a different system.

41:43.700 --> 41:46.420
And then you've got text messages and RCS messages.

41:46.420 --> 41:49.660
Did you know on the business side, it is now separate?

41:49.660 --> 41:53.180
They have like their weird slack clone and then there's like the regular chats.

41:53.180 --> 41:54.660
And I kept getting pings.

41:54.660 --> 41:58.540
I'm like, I don't, this guy says this comes up in Chrome.

41:58.540 --> 42:00.440
Like I don't, I don't see anything.

42:00.440 --> 42:03.860
And sure enough, there's like a whole nother window now.

42:03.860 --> 42:06.400
It's just impressive how these get set.

42:06.400 --> 42:08.220
So wall street journal runs this piece.

42:08.220 --> 42:09.700
That's clearly a piece of crap.

42:09.700 --> 42:13.580
Then the official Android account doubles down on it and you know, accuses Apple of

42:13.580 --> 42:20.080
bullying by locking people into iMessage when it's just, they implemented a good system.

42:20.080 --> 42:22.420
You can go into the settings and turn off iMessage.

42:22.420 --> 42:28.020
You don't have to use it, but text messages, SMS sucks.

42:28.020 --> 42:29.020
It sucks.

42:29.020 --> 42:34.220
That's why Signal and Telegram and Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp are so fricking popular

42:34.220 --> 42:41.020
because text messages suck and Apple recognized that and build a solution into their platform.

42:41.020 --> 42:43.680
And then they saw this as a strategic moat.

42:43.680 --> 42:49.980
Of course, of course, Google, on the other hand, boondoggled it.

42:49.980 --> 42:51.420
They screwed the pooch.

42:51.420 --> 42:55.280
They missed not one opportunity, but like eight opportunities.

42:55.280 --> 42:59.360
And now they're out on Twitter calling Apple a bully over it.

42:59.360 --> 43:03.460
They started with a perfectly good chat system that people liked.

43:03.460 --> 43:07.860
The only problem was it was open source and an open protocol and it could be interconnected

43:07.860 --> 43:08.860
with other systems.

43:08.860 --> 43:09.860
And Google-

43:09.860 --> 43:11.420
God forbid I could run it in Addium.

43:11.420 --> 43:12.860
They didn't want that.

43:12.860 --> 43:14.700
They had a system.

43:14.700 --> 43:20.100
Everybody liked it, but they got greedy and they've never figured it out since then.

43:20.100 --> 43:22.960
So I just want to correct you before you get sued.

43:22.960 --> 43:27.780
Google is not accusing Apple of being a bully in this context.

43:27.780 --> 43:33.100
They are accusing Apple of arming the bullies of America to the teeth with these blue bubbles.

43:33.100 --> 43:36.700
Yeah, they're riffing on what the Wall Street Journal basically laid out, but yeah, that's

43:36.700 --> 43:37.700
exactly it.

43:37.700 --> 43:38.700
It's unbelievable.

43:38.700 --> 43:39.700
Yeah.

43:39.700 --> 43:45.100
I mean, first of all, what journalist that works for the Wall Street Journal woke up

43:45.100 --> 43:47.380
and said, you know what?

43:47.380 --> 43:52.220
I think these bubbles on my iPhone and maybe they have a SIM.

43:52.220 --> 43:53.220
I do.

43:53.220 --> 43:54.220
I got it.

43:54.220 --> 43:56.220
Get the bacon.

43:56.220 --> 43:57.220
I've always got the bacon.

43:57.220 --> 43:58.220
I mean, get the bacon.

43:58.220 --> 43:59.220
I've always got the bacon.

43:59.220 --> 44:01.740
This is a plant.

44:01.740 --> 44:04.660
Windows Phone 11 is coming.

44:04.660 --> 44:05.660
This is what this is.

44:05.660 --> 44:09.020
They're going to get Apple and Google to destroy each other and then wait for it.

44:09.020 --> 44:16.860
MSN Messenger conquers all, runs the table on your beautiful Nokia Windows Phone.

44:16.860 --> 44:18.360
Actually, you know what?

44:18.360 --> 44:21.420
If they had universal messaging, I might be okay with it.

44:21.420 --> 44:27.020
I still don't understand why I can't have Addium just like have all my messaging services.

44:27.020 --> 44:29.180
I mean, Addium is like deeply broken now.

44:29.180 --> 44:33.540
I think part of what tripped Google up is I think it was too late into the game.

44:33.540 --> 44:39.220
They realized they'd screwed up, you know, and what we need is a carrier solution like

44:39.220 --> 44:40.220
with RCS, right?

44:40.220 --> 44:43.060
Because you need something that's supported on the carrier side.

44:43.060 --> 44:46.040
But the only way they were ever going to get that to be successful is if they bake that

44:46.040 --> 44:48.980
into the deal a long time ago with Android, right?

44:48.980 --> 44:53.080
And so there's this optimistic, let's get all of these horrible companies that are run

44:53.080 --> 44:57.980
by some of the worst assholes on the planet to accept this new standard around the world.

44:57.980 --> 44:58.980
The League of Evil.

44:58.980 --> 44:59.980
Yes.

44:59.980 --> 45:03.180
Or let's just build something into our own platform recognizing this is an issue that

45:03.180 --> 45:05.620
our users are going to clearly want.

45:05.620 --> 45:08.780
iMessage didn't start like this at the beginning, right?

45:08.780 --> 45:13.300
It was a real basic thing and Apple recognized it was something their users wanted and improved

45:13.300 --> 45:20.860
it over time and just continued to iterate on top of one messaging system, right?

45:20.860 --> 45:23.620
And it's clearly the difference in strategy that ended up winning.

45:23.620 --> 45:28.820
I'm always amazed with how whoever the biz dev person was that did the Verizon Android

45:28.820 --> 45:33.980
deal when Verizon was so clearly desperate for an iPhone competitor.

45:33.980 --> 45:34.980
Droid.

45:34.980 --> 45:38.100
How they failed with so much leverage.

45:38.100 --> 45:39.100
I know.

45:39.100 --> 45:44.580
It's so like, how do you not just walk into that meeting and basically, you know, put

45:44.580 --> 45:46.140
on a black turtleneck, wear your blue jeans.

45:46.140 --> 45:47.140
You got it.

45:47.140 --> 45:50.180
Cause of course you have to dress like Steve Jobs to do this and just like throw your briefcase

45:50.180 --> 45:51.180
on the table.

45:51.180 --> 45:52.180
Okay.

45:52.180 --> 45:53.180
You're Google.

45:53.180 --> 45:55.380
Throw your teenage appropriate book back on the table.

45:55.380 --> 45:56.660
Sorry guys.

45:56.660 --> 45:59.420
And just say here, dog, we want the same deal.

45:59.420 --> 46:02.980
Apple has an agency and if you don't take it, continue hemorrhaging customers and have

46:02.980 --> 46:03.980
fun.

46:03.980 --> 46:04.980
You know what it's gotta be?

46:04.980 --> 46:10.500
Cause if you look back at that original droid launch, which I had, it was terrible.

46:10.500 --> 46:17.860
It was so focused on the star Wars branding, the red theme, the whole phone came in a red

46:17.860 --> 46:18.860
theme.

46:18.860 --> 46:19.860
Yeah.

46:19.860 --> 46:20.860
But come on.

46:20.860 --> 46:26.100
I think they focused on app store and platform theming and didn't even think about the bigger

46:26.100 --> 46:28.580
picture things that clearly needed to get worked on.

46:28.580 --> 46:29.580
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

46:29.580 --> 46:34.940
They screwed up the actual tenants of a longterm deal because a star Wars film had come out

46:34.940 --> 46:38.380
and it just seemed like a great marketing opportunity, right?

46:38.380 --> 46:41.860
Star Wars has droids, Android sounds like droid.

46:41.860 --> 46:42.860
That's great.

46:42.860 --> 46:43.860
Right?

46:43.860 --> 46:46.900
And then you can make the whole phone theme red because Verizon's brand is red.

46:46.900 --> 46:48.380
What an opportunity.

46:48.380 --> 46:49.380
Okay.

46:49.380 --> 46:53.900
So what they needed to do, if they really had their heart set on this very temporary

46:53.900 --> 46:59.800
star Wars deal is contract George Lucas to be a consultant because I got to tell you,

46:59.800 --> 47:05.540
if he had made the deal as poor, poor, sweet Paramount Pictures on the hard way, he would

47:05.540 --> 47:07.380
have got the better side of that deal.

47:07.380 --> 47:08.380
Probably.

47:08.380 --> 47:11.380
There's no way he would have been like, okay, so here's the deal.

47:11.380 --> 47:17.060
But also, can I just, before we wrap up on completely on this, like why not use the same

47:17.060 --> 47:19.500
chat system in all of these apps?

47:19.500 --> 47:23.740
Like take advantage of the ecosystem like Microsoft does and Apple does, right?

47:23.740 --> 47:30.820
Why build messaging silos in each of your major consumer facing apps?

47:30.820 --> 47:31.820
Like what's the logic?

47:31.820 --> 47:33.620
Why wouldn't you have them cross connect?

47:33.620 --> 47:35.460
I actually think I know the answer.

47:35.460 --> 47:36.460
Okay.

47:36.460 --> 47:41.540
Remember the old meme of Microsoft as the Microsoft orgs as basically, you know, it

47:41.540 --> 47:44.980
was like seven guys with all guns pointed to each other's head.

47:44.980 --> 47:47.440
That's exactly what's going on at Google.

47:47.440 --> 47:51.140
There's different managers and different executives for each of these services and everybody wants

47:51.140 --> 47:52.780
to rule the world, right?

47:52.780 --> 47:53.900
That's got to be it.

47:53.900 --> 47:54.900
That's it, right?

47:54.900 --> 47:59.360
Where at Apple, it's a straight up feudal system where it's like, hey, Uncle Tim wants

47:59.360 --> 48:00.460
this today.

48:00.460 --> 48:03.140
That just means there's weak leadership at Google because somebody should be sitting

48:03.140 --> 48:07.260
at the top going, I'm sorry to tell you Google Photos team, but you're never going to be

48:07.260 --> 48:11.180
the world leading messaging service, you know, or sorry, Google Stadia team, you're built

48:11.180 --> 48:14.180
in messaging platform that's private just to Stadia.

48:14.180 --> 48:17.060
That's never going to take off and, you know, take over the world.

48:17.060 --> 48:18.540
So scratch that idea.

48:18.540 --> 48:21.060
Let's just use the same back end chat system.

48:21.060 --> 48:24.620
That the other thing I was thinking of is the argument's got to be, well, people that

48:24.620 --> 48:29.560
are chatting about photos probably don't want to chat with people that are playing video

48:29.560 --> 48:30.560
games, right?

48:30.560 --> 48:33.600
They're two totally different workflows.

48:33.600 --> 48:36.940
You could still interconnect them and have shared usernames across them and whatnot and

48:36.940 --> 48:37.940
ping each other.

48:37.940 --> 48:38.940
That doesn't make sense.

48:38.940 --> 48:39.940
No, that doesn't.

48:39.940 --> 48:44.460
I mean, you would have to restructure, let's just call it Google chat.

48:44.460 --> 48:45.460
Actually they did.

48:45.460 --> 48:49.500
That is what they used to call it and say, all right, Google chat, you guys are a whole

48:49.500 --> 48:50.500
division.

48:50.500 --> 48:51.500
Let's talk.

48:51.500 --> 48:53.740
Nancy, you're the, you're the queen of Google chat, right?

48:53.740 --> 48:54.740
You got it.

48:54.740 --> 48:55.740
You're in.

48:55.740 --> 49:02.060
Your customers are the photos team, the, I mean Stadia, come on, but sure.

49:02.060 --> 49:07.100
The Stadia team, I guess the pay team and whatever ridiculous other services Google

49:07.100 --> 49:09.620
comes up with and then kills in three weeks.

49:09.620 --> 49:10.620
Those are your customers.

49:10.620 --> 49:17.500
You have to give them one protocol, one programming interface, and you build the chat product

49:17.500 --> 49:20.460
and they just, you know, they integrate it as they like it.

49:20.460 --> 49:21.660
Exactly.

49:21.660 --> 49:22.660
And that's it.

49:22.660 --> 49:27.500
And, and the cert, you, you can take feedback, but you're not making bespoke changes for,

49:27.500 --> 49:31.220
let's say photos wants to like do some weird image cropping stuff in chat.

49:31.220 --> 49:35.660
No, unless it's a unified rollout for all of chat, it doesn't happen.

49:35.660 --> 49:39.340
And if there's a dispute, well, that's why we have a hierarchy and we go to a meeting

49:39.340 --> 49:43.020
and it's corporate server, but it's passive aggressive, but eventually someone makes a

49:43.020 --> 49:44.020
decision.

49:44.020 --> 49:47.460
You know what I just described and Microsoft, that's how they do it.

49:47.460 --> 49:48.460
Right?

49:48.460 --> 49:53.820
There's a king of all things office at Microsoft and he does whatever the hell he wants until

49:53.820 --> 49:55.500
there's a conflict with another division.

49:55.500 --> 49:56.980
And then they resolve it up the chain.

49:56.980 --> 49:57.980
Yeah.

49:57.980 --> 50:00.440
Somebody up the chain resolves the fiefdom battle, right?

50:00.440 --> 50:03.980
That's what happens to somebody says, all right, well, I know you both have your ideas,

50:03.980 --> 50:06.460
but we're going to test it and then we're going to make a decision and we're going to

50:06.460 --> 50:07.460
go with one of them.

50:07.460 --> 50:09.960
Then everybody get the hell on board instead.

50:09.960 --> 50:12.900
What you have is at Google, everybody's creating their own little fiefdoms and their own little

50:12.900 --> 50:13.900
technology stack.

50:13.900 --> 50:17.140
Well, of course that becomes unsustainable and it's going to make Google more inclined

50:17.140 --> 50:20.340
to want to shut those projects down because of the overhead.

50:20.340 --> 50:21.340
Well, okay.

50:21.340 --> 50:28.100
Nothing can quench the bloodlust of Google killing products.

50:28.100 --> 50:29.540
Very true.

50:29.540 --> 50:31.500
That's probably just baked in, right?

50:31.500 --> 50:32.500
All right.

50:32.500 --> 50:33.760
Well, we'd love to get your feedback.

50:33.760 --> 50:34.760
It's a new year.

50:34.760 --> 50:38.340

51:20.420 --> 51:21.420
You know what?

51:21.420 --> 51:22.700
I'm so into the proletariat today.

51:22.700 --> 51:24.100
I'm not going to be a vicious capitalist.

51:24.100 --> 51:25.980
I would like to send you to get lab.com.

51:25.980 --> 51:28.340
Go check out that open source self hosting guide.

51:28.340 --> 51:29.340
Right.

51:29.340 --> 51:30.340
Very good.

51:30.340 --> 51:34.060
I'll be a bit self serving only to empower the listener.

51:34.060 --> 51:36.060
So go to self hosted dot show.
