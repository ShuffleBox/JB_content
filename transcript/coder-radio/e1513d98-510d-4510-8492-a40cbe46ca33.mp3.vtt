00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
This is Kodo Radio, episode 345 for February 18th, 2019.

00:30.000 --> 00:40.000
Hello there, and welcome to Kodo Radio, Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show, taking a pragmatic look at the art and the business of software development and its related technologies.

00:40.000 --> 00:53.000
From a very cold and icy Pacific Northwest, my name is Chris, and join us, every week, like the soldier of podcasting that he truly is, it's our man in Florida, Mr. Dominic.

00:53.000 --> 00:55.000
Hello Mike!

00:55.000 --> 00:57.000
Hello Chris!

00:57.000 --> 01:07.000
Hello Hanson, good to be connected with you, and we must not take another moment. No more time must be spent on anything other than the introduction of Wes Payne. Hello Wes.

01:07.000 --> 01:09.000
Hello gentlemen.

01:09.000 --> 01:13.000
Hello Wes, I gotta come up with like a really clever way to segue you into the show.

01:13.000 --> 01:15.000
You gotta work on that. It's homework.

01:15.000 --> 01:19.000
Right now it's Chris Practice's improv is really what happens with the intro.

01:19.000 --> 01:22.000
Well that'll benefit future hosts, I'm sure.

01:22.000 --> 01:31.000
Well guys, we have a pretty great episode. The three of us are gathered here today to talk about many, many things. Mostly how Mike spends his money though.

01:31.000 --> 01:42.000
This guy right now, he's got not one, but two new Linux rigs sitting in his office. We're really later today going to be talking about his new Thalia workstation, which is a killer.

01:42.000 --> 01:43.000
Oh my god.

01:43.000 --> 01:46.000
You and I got a chance to go see them hands on, but Mike had a chance to see them.

01:46.000 --> 01:48.000
Yeah, it's his. He's using it in his home.

01:48.000 --> 01:59.000
Yeah, he's like the proto prototype too. So we'll talk about that in a little bit. But just as a little tea skis, Mr. Dominic, you got yourself a Darter Pro laptop as well.

01:59.000 --> 02:08.000
Yeah, yeah, I'm currently reviewing that. Very just kick the tires that review literally like installed basic tool chain.

02:08.000 --> 02:13.000
So, and I of course put the mandatory number of drinks on top of it.

02:13.000 --> 02:16.000
Right. So how does it work as a drink holder?

02:16.000 --> 02:32.000
It's pretty effective. I in fact, I did get a Valentine's package from Emma for myself, my wife and my son, including plastic wrap, a flask and shirt for Laura and a number of chocolates for my son.

02:32.000 --> 02:35.000
So they are prepared.

02:35.000 --> 02:40.000
That's really nice. You know, they just they've embraced it because they realize that it's a good revenue.

02:40.000 --> 02:43.000
So it's just going to keep happening. And it's a whole family affair.

02:43.000 --> 02:49.000
Yeah, literally, your Twitter feed was giving me anxiety all weekend long. It was it was it was rough in the Fisher household.

02:49.000 --> 02:55.000
When you're reviewing a laptop, it's important to put a bottle of scotch on it.

02:55.000 --> 02:59.000
I can see that a higher bottle. Some cups. Yeah.

02:59.000 --> 03:03.000
Yeah. And it's not even like, you know, it's just cutting. So it's not like we were going too hard.

03:03.000 --> 03:09.000
Yeah. OK. But I suppose the higher proof it is, the better. Right. There's less water in it. So that's going to be safer for the laptop.

03:09.000 --> 03:13.000
Great point. It'll actually clean it. That's a pro move right there. Science.

03:13.000 --> 03:19.000
You got to love the Internet, though. And I don't mean any disparaging comments towards anybody who actually did this, because a couple of you did this.

03:19.000 --> 03:29.000
But like the Internet's response to Mike posting a picture of a laptop with a drink on it is, hey, Mike, just so you know, I think that's a waterproof.

03:29.000 --> 03:35.000
Yeah. Oh, my God. Yeah. I've gotten a lot of emails mentioning the what I thought were dead.

03:35.000 --> 03:44.000
You've also got a couple of audience members that are stalking you in Telegram trying to get you to let them buy you the unspillable mug.

03:44.000 --> 03:51.000
There's a couple. It's a thing that's happening. Oh, I did forget. And Emma's package was also a sippy cup.

03:51.000 --> 03:55.000
Not for your son, but for you. Nope. Yeah.

03:55.000 --> 03:58.000
Now, listen, Mike, I've actually wasn't sure if you're going to make it today.

03:58.000 --> 04:05.000
I wasn't sure I wasn't going to hold it against you if you no showed, because as far as I can tell, you haven't slept for about 24 hours.

04:05.000 --> 04:08.000
And not only is that the first time this week, but I believe it is the second time this week.

04:08.000 --> 04:13.000
What happened to all that talk we had about getting better sleep hygiene? What happened here?

04:13.000 --> 04:21.000
Yeah, I need to get back on the wagon there. I have not slept a good night's sleep in four days.

04:21.000 --> 04:25.000
That is getting up that some serious stuff like hallucinations.

04:25.000 --> 04:31.000
I get grumpy. I keep seeing Alan Jude with a USB stick installing PSD on all my machines.

04:31.000 --> 04:35.000
Yeah, it keeps you up. It might actually be real. I don't know. I don't know.

04:35.000 --> 04:40.000
I mean, so are you are you pulling all nighters for work or is it unrelated to work?

04:40.000 --> 04:45.000
It's work. It's just trying to wrap things up.

04:45.000 --> 04:50.000
You know, the beginning of the year is always kind of awkward. You have projects, endings, projects starting.

04:50.000 --> 04:57.000
And yeah, just trying to dive one project that's supposed to ship.

04:57.000 --> 05:04.000
And it looks like it is shipping, but that's requiring a little more effort than I bargained for.

05:04.000 --> 05:09.000
I mean, I know how much people love it when we talk about this stuff because it's only it's so happy.

05:09.000 --> 05:12.000
It's only us on the show that sleep. So it's not applicable to anybody. Certainly not.

05:12.000 --> 05:16.000
No, obviously I'm back. So we're going to talk about stuff not related to coding, clearly,

05:16.000 --> 05:22.000
because only on only when I'm on the show does any of us sleep, apparently. I'm deleting Reddit today.

05:22.000 --> 05:25.000
I just really quickly, you know, I got into tracking my sleep.

05:25.000 --> 05:32.000
Yeah. And so I had a 15 day stretch where I was getting really good sleep and it was pretty remarkable.

05:32.000 --> 05:35.000
Did people comment? I'm thinking Hadea type people.

05:35.000 --> 05:39.000
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I would say I mean, I would say I had great, great energy.

05:39.000 --> 05:44.000
It was it was good. I was I felt it definitely translated to a more productive sense of being,

05:44.000 --> 05:51.000
which is it's like the key factor to me having an overall well sense of being like if I don't feel productive, I'm a mess.

05:51.000 --> 05:58.000
And but for the last week once I got sick and then I've been traveling to last night was the first night.

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
I could tell you right now I got I got a little complication on my watch.

06:00.000 --> 06:05.000
I push one button and I can tell you I've got last night I got 15 minutes of deep sleep.

06:05.000 --> 06:10.000
Oh, no. I got four hours of quality sleep. OK. And that's my best in a week.

06:10.000 --> 06:12.000
But I know that now at least it's trending in the right direction.

06:12.000 --> 06:15.000
And I actually get you'll see this. I get a readiness meter. Can you see that?

06:15.000 --> 06:20.000
I get a readiness meter that tells me based on my historical sleep data how I'm going to feel overall today.

06:20.000 --> 06:23.000
And I'll tell you this is actually pretty spot on. I don't check it all the time.

06:23.000 --> 06:26.000
You kind of be like a little heads up like you might not be on best. Don't take it.

06:26.000 --> 06:36.000
Yeah. Yeah. Take a little easy. If you've got the Apple Watch, get auto sleep and just wear it for 30 days and go to bed with it and just get your sleep figured out.

06:36.000 --> 06:40.000
It makes a huge difference in your productivity and how much you spill on laptops.

06:40.000 --> 06:45.000
So this is this is your intervention right now. Right. Oh, yeah. We get some sleep.

06:45.000 --> 06:49.000
Yeah. Wes and your buddy Wes and Chris are we're having an intervention, Mike.

06:49.000 --> 06:52.000
And we're saying tonight you have to go to bed on time. No working late tonight.

06:52.000 --> 06:56.000
So, you know, I think I might go to bed at eight. Me and the two year old are going to be lockstep.

06:56.000 --> 07:02.000
Good. Good. Well, I want I want to see a tweet in 24 hours or so saying you got great sleep.

07:02.000 --> 07:08.000
Otherwise, we're going to keep talking about the show. And nobody wants that. Nobody. Nobody wants that.

07:08.000 --> 07:18.000
You see what I did there? All right. Well, that was really just me stalling to get us to the point that I think Wes and I are most interested in.

07:18.000 --> 07:25.000
I mean, we got a lot to cover today, including switch statement changes. We got log in forms to shit on.

07:25.000 --> 07:30.000
There's some big things for IOT developers that are going to probably change the game for the next 10 years.

07:30.000 --> 07:34.000
And Mike got triggered this week. So we're going to talk about all of that.

07:34.000 --> 07:39.000
But first, we got to get to the bottom of Mike's Thalia workstation.

07:39.000 --> 07:46.000
Y'all know that System 76 announced their own in-house designed and built Thalia workstations that run Linux.

07:46.000 --> 07:51.000
They have a unique wood panel design that's curved around the front of the case.

07:51.000 --> 07:58.000
Lots of I.O. the specs for the hardware, the case, the design of it. All of that is open source.

07:58.000 --> 08:02.000
They have a daughter board that manages some of the I.O. also open source.

08:02.000 --> 08:08.000
And they started shipping. When did we go down there, Wes?

08:08.000 --> 08:11.000
The first start of December, I think. Yeah, you're right.

08:11.000 --> 08:14.000
So mid-December, they started shipping to customers that pre-ordered them.

08:14.000 --> 08:24.000
And Mike's pretty early in that batch. And just this last week or so, received a System 76 Thalia workstation and has posted his review.

08:24.000 --> 08:32.000
I'm kind of curious to know your initial thoughts, Mike, and your overall buy-don't-buy on the Thalia.

08:32.000 --> 08:40.000
Yeah, so the Thalia is magical for a number of reasons. The most important being that a client actually paid for it.

08:40.000 --> 08:44.000
That helps. That is magical. That's a big win.

08:44.000 --> 08:49.000
I like it. Just top line, I definitely would recommend it.

08:49.000 --> 08:54.000
I did get a couple comments already because I love Reddit.

08:54.000 --> 09:00.000
I guess there are cheaper Linux workstations, and I did do some research, and it's like, that is true.

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
Turns out. Turns out.

09:02.000 --> 09:05.000
You can always save a buck in the Linux ecosystem.

09:05.000 --> 09:10.000
Right. But if you're coming from the Mac world, this is half the price of an iMac Pro.

09:10.000 --> 09:17.000
If not, it's about, as configured, this is about $23, $24 after tax on shipping, I think.

09:17.000 --> 09:23.000
I am running the AMD version of the regular Thalia.

09:23.000 --> 09:28.000
I mean, we have the specs somewhere in the show notes or in the review.

09:28.000 --> 09:31.000
So if people want to look, just go to dominechem.com and look.

09:31.000 --> 09:34.000
This is probably the fastest computer I've owned.

09:34.000 --> 09:43.000
It is pretty spec'd out. 8GB GPU, 32GB RAM, crazy Ryzen processor.

09:43.000 --> 09:51.000
I love it. So far, I've had only one minor issue, which was in shipping.

09:51.000 --> 09:58.000
The secondary hard disk drive dislodged because UPS apparently thought it was a soccer ball of some kind.

09:58.000 --> 10:02.000
So I did have to open it up, but that actually brings me to one of my positives.

10:02.000 --> 10:08.000
I was able to reinstall the drive, open the case, reinstall the drive without touching a screwdriver.

10:08.000 --> 10:14.000
Everything is basically hand, the whole case is hand screws.

10:14.000 --> 10:17.000
That's so nice when you just want to get down to work.

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
Yeah, if you just need to fix something.

10:19.000 --> 10:24.000
Working inside of the case is easy. I could see myself modding this out with additional hard disks.

10:24.000 --> 10:35.000
I have to say, and I know this is super nerdy, although you're listening to Koda Radio, so you're already done.

10:35.000 --> 10:41.000
I have not seen the inside of a case that was so easy to work in.

10:41.000 --> 10:46.000
Like they have the thumbscrew plates in there for additional thumbscrews when you add more devices later.

10:46.000 --> 10:50.000
The hard drive bays are precision cut.

10:50.000 --> 10:54.000
You know what's funny though, that you hit a shipping issue?

10:54.000 --> 10:56.000
Wes, wouldn't you agree?

10:56.000 --> 11:07.000
One of the number one things that Carl would comment on, CarlCEOSystem76, was all of the crazy ass things that they were particularly engineering just to survive shipping.

11:07.000 --> 11:14.000
Yeah, oh yeah, they spent a lot of time being like, well we needed to design this not just for being in the case and that life, but how is it going to get to the customer?

11:14.000 --> 11:23.000
In fact, so much so that I actually asked Carl, I'm like, so clearly shipping is the most extreme damaging experience in the life.

11:23.000 --> 11:32.000
Because the life of this PC, they were building, they are custom laser cutting individual components to hold the video card in position during shipping,

11:32.000 --> 11:38.000
drive cage stuff, stuff to hold their dot, like all these crazy little components that they are custom manufacturing.

11:38.000 --> 11:40.000
That aren't there for any other part of the life of the machine.

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
Just to survive shipping.

11:42.000 --> 11:46.000
So I asked Carl, I'm like, is this the most extreme situation the computer goes through?

11:46.000 --> 11:47.000
He was like, yeah, this is it.

11:47.000 --> 11:50.000
If the computer survives shipping, they generally survive everything.

11:50.000 --> 11:53.000
It's like, it's the most damaging thing.

11:53.000 --> 11:56.000
And so much of their R&D goes into surviving shipping.

11:56.000 --> 12:01.000
Yeah, did I see that the super thing, the massive ships in a giant big case?

12:01.000 --> 12:03.000
Yeah, yeah, that was right.

12:03.000 --> 12:04.000
Yeah, it's crazy.

12:04.000 --> 12:08.000
Yeah, and I have to say, they have a very nicely designed box with some artwork.

12:08.000 --> 12:15.000
I did not post a picture of it because it looked like Rocky Balboa had a few rounds with it by the time it got to my door.

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
Yeah, the UPS kicked the crap out of it.

12:17.000 --> 12:22.000
So how's IO inputs and outputs? Do you have pretty good connectivity with this thing?

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
Do you have plenty of storage?

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
Yeah, you have plenty of storage.

12:26.000 --> 12:32.000
You have two USB 3.1 Gen 2s, which I thought was a nice touch.

12:32.000 --> 12:37.000
They're basically just double the IO throughput of regular USB 3.

12:37.000 --> 12:40.000
And you have a bunch of USB 3 ports.

12:40.000 --> 12:48.000
So if you're coming from a Mac, you might have to get out in one of those like Tom's hardware guides and realize what all these ports are.

12:48.000 --> 12:51.000
Might take you a few hours.

12:51.000 --> 12:56.000
The only, I would say, deficiency in the ports is actually what I'm experiencing right now.

12:56.000 --> 13:01.000
There is no front line out for an audio jack.

13:01.000 --> 13:05.000
And if you're doing any kind of podcast, I'm on the Thaleo right now, by the way.

13:05.000 --> 13:07.000
Is that what I'm hearing in the background?

13:07.000 --> 13:10.000
Is that what that is? I can't hear it. Yeah, I do hear it.

13:10.000 --> 13:15.000
Yeah, you can hear it. So, yeah, there is a pretty.

13:15.000 --> 13:18.000
I was wondering how the Rode mic would pick it up.

13:18.000 --> 13:21.000
It's there is fan noise. Yeah.

13:21.000 --> 13:23.000
Now, I just got a little louder, too.

13:23.000 --> 13:25.000
It just like, well, my neighbor's also mowing his lawn.

13:25.000 --> 13:27.000
Oh, that's what you have to disambiguate.

13:27.000 --> 13:32.000
What the audience hears is processed a little bit so they don't hear the full effect.

13:32.000 --> 13:35.000
They'll probably hear a little bit of it, but they won't hear the full effect that we're hearing.

13:35.000 --> 13:37.000
Yeah, it's not bad.

13:37.000 --> 13:39.000
I don't hear it when I'm watching TV.

13:39.000 --> 13:46.000
Now, I will say that I think this machine is.

13:46.000 --> 13:53.000
You know, I'm used to slapping Linux on a Dell or some Windows workstation and fighting with like particularly graphics drivers.

13:53.000 --> 13:55.000
Right. Sure.

13:55.000 --> 14:01.000
Yeah, that noise you if you just heard something is my neighbor because I just heard a kick up through my headphones.

14:01.000 --> 14:11.000
The experience of taking a fully powered desktop, putting it on my desk or on my side table and being ready to go was great.

14:11.000 --> 14:15.000
Having the drivers all preconfigured.

14:15.000 --> 14:26.000
I honestly I honestly think if you're considering switching from Mac OS to desktop Linux because you wanted a Mac Pro.

14:26.000 --> 14:29.000
Right. This is I know I'm getting very particular here.

14:29.000 --> 14:33.000
And you happen to be a developer.

14:33.000 --> 14:36.000
Honestly, consider Thalia, you're used to spending money.

14:36.000 --> 14:41.000
It's not that much more expensive than the equivalent, let's say Dell.

14:41.000 --> 14:47.000
And you don't deal with all the nonsense that you would deal with if you say bought something at Best Buy and had the slap Linux on it.

14:47.000 --> 14:54.000
Also, it's beautiful. I have gotten more comments on the case than anything else, which I think is interesting.

14:54.000 --> 14:57.000
Yeah, but it's I thought it was a nice design. I really do.

14:57.000 --> 15:01.000
Yeah, but that was kind of one of their goals is a desktop you could have on the top of your desk.

15:01.000 --> 15:03.000
Yeah, it seems like kind of where you put it.

15:03.000 --> 15:06.000
Yeah, that is how they put it. They wanted something you'd be proud to show off.

15:06.000 --> 15:15.000
And I think it is that. And the thing is, is what you're proposing has a built in sales advantage.

15:15.000 --> 15:18.000
Like Apple has this massive tricost.

15:18.000 --> 15:25.000
If you want to get into the Apple ecosystem from a Mac side, you're looking at a thousand dollars or you buy used.

15:25.000 --> 15:30.000
But you will eventually want to buy a machine that can actually do your work. So you'll eventually spend money.

15:30.000 --> 15:36.000
But with Linux, you can throw it on anything just to see if the applications work for you.

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
You can't do that with macOS.

15:38.000 --> 15:42.000
Yeah, right. And you commonly do. You just find a machine, you're like, well, yeah, inspect it out, try it, see what happens.

15:42.000 --> 15:48.000
Or even if you have a decent machine now. So you've got maybe like this right here that we have in we have one of these in the studio right now.

15:48.000 --> 15:52.000
It's a 2013 MacBook that we've used to throw Arch on before and things like that.

15:52.000 --> 15:58.000
It's still a great computer. It really is funny. Like it's a 2013 computer.

15:58.000 --> 16:03.000
And if the design hadn't changed, I wouldn't be able to peg it. I wouldn't know.

16:03.000 --> 16:08.000
Like it does everything, including processing complex art, audio effects very quickly.

16:08.000 --> 16:15.000
And so you could just throw Linux in a VM on this or throw Linux on this and try out the workflow for a week and see if it works for you.

16:15.000 --> 16:21.000
You can't do that with the Mac. You can with Windows. It's not as flexible, but you can.

16:21.000 --> 16:24.000
Yeah, it's a little more. You can you can push and squeeze it.

16:24.000 --> 16:30.000
And but unless you want to get into like KXT hacking and that's just that's just unpleasant.

16:30.000 --> 16:33.000
And it's not really it's not done as much anymore either.

16:33.000 --> 16:41.000
Yeah. So I think there is a sort of you can put your I guess the way to put it is you can put your toes in the water before you make the leap.

16:41.000 --> 16:48.000
You can put your workflow toes in the water, see if it works for you and see if the water is amenable.

16:48.000 --> 16:54.000
So would you spend your own money on it, Mike?

16:54.000 --> 17:04.000
Oh, yeah, definitely. I mean, if again, since I am a complete Linux hippie now, apparently I would I would this would be my Mac Pro replacement.

17:04.000 --> 17:21.000
Hmm. Hell out of here. Now, I wasn't it wasn't it your co-host maybe over a year ago who told you you should go with a powerful desktop approach and build a powerful desktop that is a Linux based machine.

17:21.000 --> 17:29.000
And then your remote systems could be like, you know, like a thousand dollar Bangor MacBook or a Chromebook or anything that you needed for the remote work.

17:29.000 --> 17:35.000
But you could always remote into your centralized, powerful desktop system that you invest into.

17:35.000 --> 17:39.000
I'm sorry, Mr. Senator, I have no recollection of that meeting.

17:39.000 --> 17:43.000
It sounds like something I say. It does sound like something you might say.

17:43.000 --> 17:55.000
You bastard. I'm going to be really curious how this works out in like the next month or two, especially with with the fans and what happens there, because I would it is really tempting to just solve that problem.

17:55.000 --> 18:02.000
Just be like, here's my here's a machine. I can do work on it. I know it'll just work. I can install whatever Linux distro and it'll have support.

18:02.000 --> 18:08.000
You and I were in a small office room with one of these failures. I did not sound like that. It didn't sound like that.

18:08.000 --> 18:12.000
But it was an Intel based system. It was not the AMD system could be different cooling system.

18:12.000 --> 18:19.000
Who knows? It could be the different sizes have different sound. I mean, I guess in theory you could go hack on that daughter board and maybe mess with it.

18:19.000 --> 18:26.000
Well, I'll be I'll be curious to know what you think of the darter in time. I think it's a boy kind of a boy.

18:26.000 --> 18:33.000
Look at you. You're swimming a new gear over there. It's a lot of you're doing a lot of OS setups and installs right now, aren't you?

18:33.000 --> 18:36.000
I can install a rails tool chain in about 15 seconds.

18:36.000 --> 18:43.000
So are you going to are you just sticking with pop on everything? Like, I'm sorry, pop underscore OS exclamation mark.

18:43.000 --> 18:51.000
They really need to change that. Yeah, I was running elementary, but right now everything's on pop because that's the way it's configured.

18:51.000 --> 18:55.000
Just for the sake of sanity and not wasting too much time, I am going to stick with pop.

18:55.000 --> 19:02.000
Huh. There you go. There you go, Wes. There you go. Do you think you could try? Do you think you could live on pop for a while?

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
I would be willing to try.

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
Yeah. Are you still on plasma, right?

19:06.000 --> 19:09.000
I am still on plasma. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

19:09.000 --> 19:15.000
I mean, it was really nice when the latest one dropped and I just did an update and it keeps working.

19:15.000 --> 19:21.000
Yeah. Yeah. Well, Wes and I and Elle, who if you haven't met yet, go check out Linux Unplugged.

19:21.000 --> 19:30.000
She was on there recently. We'll all be hanging out at Scale 17X coming up on March 7th through the 10th, 2019 at the Pasadena Convention Center.

19:30.000 --> 19:35.000
And if you're going to be at scale, go to meetup.com slash Jupiter Broadcasting Saturday evening.

19:35.000 --> 19:41.000
We're going to go out to dinner, have ourselves a little get together and just hang out amongst friends.

19:41.000 --> 19:50.000
Scale is the annual, I was going to say. I don't know. I was going to say the biannual, but it's not.

19:50.000 --> 19:57.000
It's an annual Southern California Linux Expo. It always happens around this time of year.

19:57.000 --> 20:00.000
It's March 7th through the 10th this year. And the hotels are booking up quick.

20:00.000 --> 20:03.000
So if you're going to go, you need to get a hotel very soon.

20:03.000 --> 20:08.000
Elle will be giving a talk from our team on the introduction and basics of containers.

20:08.000 --> 20:14.000
Wes and I will be sneaking around, chatting and hanging out with people and fully taking advantage of the hallway track.

20:14.000 --> 20:15.000
Oh, yeah.

20:15.000 --> 20:18.000
As we do. As we do. I don't think I'm bringing the RV this year, though.

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
No, just going freestyle.

20:20.000 --> 20:21.000
Going to do the hotel thing.

20:21.000 --> 20:23.000
We'll be fast and light and on our feet.

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
Nimble, if you will. Nimble, if you will.

20:25.000 --> 20:26.000
See everything we can.

20:26.000 --> 20:32.000
And don't ask Mike. He's not going. Don't ask him. Florida's on the other end.

20:32.000 --> 20:36.000
I mean, you just get stuck in the swamp, right? I believe that's how it works.

20:36.000 --> 20:40.000
By the time he got to California, it would be over. That's the problem.

20:40.000 --> 20:42.000
That's true. Or an alligator would follow me.

20:42.000 --> 20:48.000
And I can only imagine people from California trying to say, alligator, how have we offended you?

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000
Is that how it works over there?

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
I'm a huge fan of California.

20:52.000 --> 20:58.000
Well, before anybody – well, I suppose if they're going to leave the show, they've already left now.

20:58.000 --> 20:59.000
But maybe we should do a little development talk.

20:59.000 --> 21:00.000
Oh, maybe.

21:00.000 --> 21:01.000
What do you say?

21:01.000 --> 21:02.000
What's the name of it? Coder Radio?

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
No, I don't think – oh, Coder Radio.

21:04.000 --> 21:09.000
At the end of January, the.NET Core development team has released a new version of.NET Core framework,

21:09.000 --> 21:15.000
which I think might have got mentioned here on the show,.NET Core 3 Preview 2, as they say.

21:15.000 --> 21:22.000
It delivers a new version of – well, it does – but it delivers a new set of features to C-Sharp for developers.

21:22.000 --> 21:26.000
And we're going to be talking about switch expressions today.

21:26.000 --> 21:30.000
Switch expressions, because this is one of the new things that landed in.NET Core 3 Preview 2.

21:30.000 --> 21:33.000
Okay, so I threw this into some of the show notes.

21:33.000 --> 21:34.000
What?

21:34.000 --> 21:37.000
Because Mike suggests – it was something that Mike said on a previous episode,

21:37.000 --> 21:44.000
which was just some of the feedback, the attitudes, not liking some of the changes in recent C-Sharp.

21:44.000 --> 21:45.000
Oh, yeah.

21:45.000 --> 21:47.000
And I saw a couple of comments on the internet, things like,

21:47.000 --> 21:53.000
this might be better titled, Changing Things for the Sake of Changing Things and Appealing to the Programming Language Geeks.

21:53.000 --> 21:54.000
Oh, snap.

21:54.000 --> 21:57.000
And so I thought this was kind of an interesting change.

21:57.000 --> 21:59.000
Apparently, it offends people.

21:59.000 --> 22:02.000
Wow, that's a shocker.

22:02.000 --> 22:04.000
That's totally unexpected.

22:04.000 --> 22:12.000
Okay, so to fully appreciate this, help me grok what a switch expression is and why.NET needed them.

22:12.000 --> 22:13.000
Boy, I don't know.

22:13.000 --> 22:15.000
I mean, Mike, would you say that it needed them?

22:15.000 --> 22:21.000
Yeah, so I think Wes and I might have a little falling out here.

22:21.000 --> 22:23.000
I'm here to witness it.

22:23.000 --> 22:32.000
A switch expression is basically stuff you could already do, but with an equal sign and a right-pointing caret thingy.

22:32.000 --> 22:36.000
Basically, let's make C-Sharp more functional so we can show off how smart we are.

22:36.000 --> 22:37.000
Sorry.

22:37.000 --> 22:38.000
Go ahead, Wes.

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
Oh, oh, that shot's fired.

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
I mean, okay, it is a small thing.

22:42.000 --> 22:47.000
It probably just doesn't matter at all, and we could probably just skip the whole thing.

22:47.000 --> 22:48.000
But I don't know.

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
I like expressions over statements.

22:50.000 --> 22:58.000
Statements are, they're just so, they feel like weird black assembly computer magic where you just say, like, adjust the machine.

22:58.000 --> 23:02.000
And an expression, it's a nice, clean, mathematical-style function.

23:02.000 --> 23:06.000
So it just seems easier to reason about, and I often try to set things up.

23:06.000 --> 23:12.000
Instead of having a case statement or something like that, with a switch expression, you get all the same pattern-matching benefits.

23:12.000 --> 23:18.000
And I think the way with the equal sign, with it on the right of the equal sign, it's just a little clearer to think about.

23:18.000 --> 23:19.000
It's a good case.

23:19.000 --> 23:27.000
I will say that C sharp in particular, obviously this kind of stuff works better in really functional languages like F sharp or Haskell or Scallop.

23:27.000 --> 23:34.000
So there is a little bit awkward if you need to do a couple things on the, whichever, you've matched something in your switch and then you want to do something.

23:34.000 --> 23:39.000
If you need to have multiple statements in there, probably the best solution right now is the kind of ugly lambda.

23:39.000 --> 23:40.000
So it's not perfect.

23:40.000 --> 23:43.000
I don't think you should go change everything to use this.

23:43.000 --> 23:45.000
I just like the functional influence.

23:45.000 --> 23:48.000
Well, it seems to be the way of the future.

23:48.000 --> 23:51.000
And I think that's been one of the criticisms is, oh, this is trendy.

23:51.000 --> 23:53.000
This is what the trendy thing to do in language design.

23:53.000 --> 23:54.000
Yeah, that's right.

23:54.000 --> 24:00.000
I think this is right on the edge probably of like, what's the real value versus just being invoked?

24:00.000 --> 24:06.000
Well, there's value to that too sometimes when you're trying to draw in new eyes or new developers.

24:06.000 --> 24:10.000
So that's not necessarily, I don't think it should be necessarily dismissed.

24:10.000 --> 24:11.000
I don't think it's worth a major change.

24:11.000 --> 24:19.000
I feel like oftentimes the functional approach can be a cleaner mental model and it might be more difficult for people who've been doing it for a long time and already have it into model.

24:19.000 --> 24:21.000
But for newcomers, it might be simpler.

24:21.000 --> 24:22.000
Exactly.

24:22.000 --> 24:28.000
And it might be if you're going for a growth thing versus just dragging along the old timers.

24:28.000 --> 24:32.000
Yeah, it's just F sharp envy.

24:32.000 --> 24:45.000
All kidding aside, though, this is interesting because we're seeing all the stodgy old languages, Java, C sharp are now adopting the I call them West features, but basically cool features of safety and functional programming.

24:45.000 --> 24:55.000
And I actually think it is to the benefit of, let's just say, more conservative developers who maybe aren't exactly going to go on the bleeding edge.

24:55.000 --> 24:58.000
As I said that, the Rust book just fell off my desk.

24:58.000 --> 24:59.000
That's very fitting.

24:59.000 --> 25:07.000
Wow, that's telling.

25:07.000 --> 25:09.000
Yeah, I have static in my headphones and the Rust book fell.

25:09.000 --> 25:13.000
So there's some sort of supernatural Rust God who's about to materialize in here.

25:13.000 --> 25:14.000
Yeah, yeah.

25:14.000 --> 25:18.000
That's what happens when you stay up for 24 hours developing, you summon the Rust God.

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
They are watching all the time.

25:20.000 --> 25:24.000
Is that how the first Rust developer came to this planet?

25:24.000 --> 25:25.000
I believe, yeah.

25:25.000 --> 25:26.000
Someone just didn't sleep for a week.

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
Yeah, I believe that is actually the truth.

25:28.000 --> 25:32.000
So what's our takeaway from the story, Wes?

25:32.000 --> 25:35.000
I mean, besides the fact that it's coming and people better get used to it.

25:35.000 --> 25:38.000
Yeah, it's just a new form you might start seeing out there.

25:38.000 --> 25:42.000
Probably you won't use it, but be aware some people might.

25:42.000 --> 25:43.000
Oh, I bet.

25:43.000 --> 25:48.000
So there was a great, great post that completely validated everything I believe in life this week.

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
So I wanted to talk about it with you guys.

25:50.000 --> 25:54.000
And it is don't get clever with login forms.

25:54.000 --> 26:01.000
And this is becoming a plague of the Internet that is preventing good password hygiene.

26:01.000 --> 26:07.000
And I have a plea to all developers in the audience that might work at any of these companies that could make a difference here.

26:07.000 --> 26:11.000
You have been chosen by God to make a difference today.

26:11.000 --> 26:12.000
So please listen.

26:12.000 --> 26:17.000
Please create login forms with simple, linkable, predictable.

26:17.000 --> 26:21.000
And that play nicely with password managers.

26:21.000 --> 26:22.000
That's it right there.

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
Simple, like that.

26:24.000 --> 26:30.000
I've recently experienced several login forms that won't let me paste in the password field.

26:30.000 --> 26:31.000
Have you ever experienced this?

26:31.000 --> 26:32.000
Oh, yeah.

26:32.000 --> 26:34.000
And commonly it's the worst things.

26:34.000 --> 26:36.000
It's like important stuff that has your credit card information.

26:36.000 --> 26:37.000
Yes.

26:37.000 --> 26:39.000
And ones that I implicitly want to use.

26:39.000 --> 26:41.000
You want to use a really long, secure password.

26:41.000 --> 26:44.000
A very long and secure password that they no longer.

26:44.000 --> 26:46.000
Oh, here's another one.

26:46.000 --> 26:50.000
They will not let you paste in like the bank routing and account number field.

26:50.000 --> 26:51.000
Right, like what?

26:51.000 --> 26:53.000
Which, again, is something I would like.

26:53.000 --> 26:54.000
I don't want a fat finger and get wrong.

26:54.000 --> 26:55.000
No.

26:55.000 --> 26:57.000
Because they charge you a fee for that.

26:57.000 --> 26:58.000
Yes.

26:58.000 --> 27:00.000
Or here's another common one that we've all seen.

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
I blame Mike for this design trend.

27:02.000 --> 27:08.000
It makes everything look nice and simple where it hides the password field.

27:08.000 --> 27:09.000
So you just get the login.

27:09.000 --> 27:10.000
You get the username.

27:10.000 --> 27:11.000
Then you have to hit next.

27:11.000 --> 27:12.000
Oh, yeah, right.

27:12.000 --> 27:15.000
And then you get the password, which some password managers are fine with.

27:15.000 --> 27:16.000
But we don't need this.

27:16.000 --> 27:17.000
We don't need this.

27:17.000 --> 27:20.000
And I totally, completely blame Mike for that.

27:20.000 --> 27:21.000
Yeah, I do.

27:21.000 --> 27:24.000
And there's a – what?

27:24.000 --> 27:25.000
I have a login form for you.

27:25.000 --> 27:26.000
Yeah, I bet.

27:26.000 --> 27:27.000
You know what I'm saying?

27:27.000 --> 27:29.000
You have to – oh, I know what you're saying.

27:29.000 --> 27:33.000
You have to go for the nice-looking designs with their fancy websites, which you're a big, fancy website.

27:33.000 --> 27:34.000
You sure are.

27:34.000 --> 27:35.000
You know what I'm saying?

27:35.000 --> 27:36.000
I am.

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
Well, I'm changing, though, Chris.

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
There's going to be no more fancy websites.

27:40.000 --> 27:45.000
It's just going to be a terminal application where you have to solve a programming problem in Rust to log in.

27:45.000 --> 27:47.000
There you go.

27:47.000 --> 27:48.000
That's why you don't need a password.

27:48.000 --> 27:49.000
No one can get in.

27:49.000 --> 27:50.000
That's fine.

27:50.000 --> 27:51.000
I just – no one can get in.

27:51.000 --> 27:54.000
I don't understand how this even happens.

27:54.000 --> 27:57.000
I guess they're trying to prevent maybe bot abuse.

27:57.000 --> 27:58.000
Could be.

27:58.000 --> 27:59.000
Yeah, could be.

27:59.000 --> 28:04.000
That's – the only thing I'm thinking of is, like, they're trying to prevent somebody from automating the entry of the information into the field.

28:04.000 --> 28:07.000
I mean, might some of it be just, like, not really thinking about it?

28:07.000 --> 28:10.000
That just sort of like – oh, like with modals, for instance, right?

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
You're like, oh, yeah, well, it just pops up and it kind of looks –

28:12.000 --> 28:16.000
Yeah, now, a modal login, I think, is a design-driven choice.

28:16.000 --> 28:17.000
I think you got a great point there.

28:17.000 --> 28:19.000
That needs to stop immediately.

28:19.000 --> 28:20.000
That has to stop.

28:20.000 --> 28:21.000
That has to stop.

28:21.000 --> 28:22.000
It does need to stop.

28:22.000 --> 28:23.000
It really has to stop.

28:23.000 --> 28:24.000
Just make slash login or whatever.

28:24.000 --> 28:25.000
It's fine.

28:25.000 --> 28:29.000
I will go out of my way to try to find a non-modal version of the site and then I will bookmark it.

28:29.000 --> 28:30.000
Yes, yes.

28:30.000 --> 28:31.000
Yeah, I will do that.

28:31.000 --> 28:40.000
So – but what needs to – the other thing that needs to stop, it's just – it's fundamentally screwing with good password hygiene is the blocking of the password paste.

28:40.000 --> 28:43.000
And I think they do it because you think about it, that's not an accident.

28:43.000 --> 28:45.000
No, you have to very consciously do it.

28:45.000 --> 28:46.000
Right.

28:46.000 --> 28:55.000
So there was probably multiple conversations in a large company, maybe dozens of discussions about blocking password entry, right?

28:55.000 --> 28:56.000
You got to figure it.

28:56.000 --> 28:57.000
It has to.

28:57.000 --> 28:58.000
You know how this gets built.

28:58.000 --> 28:59.000
Yeah, exactly.

28:59.000 --> 29:01.000
In any reasonable-sized organization, that's what happens.

29:01.000 --> 29:09.000
So there was – at multiple levels of the company, there were individuals that thought this was a good idea that bought off on the idea for better security.

29:09.000 --> 29:12.000
Got to put on the schedule, got developers to finish the feature.

29:12.000 --> 29:13.000
Yeah.

29:13.000 --> 29:14.000
That's insane.

29:14.000 --> 29:17.000
Let me give you my – I have actually experienced this.

29:17.000 --> 29:18.000
Yeah.

29:18.000 --> 29:19.000
Come clean, Mike.

29:19.000 --> 29:20.000
Come clean.

29:20.000 --> 29:21.000
Okay.

29:21.000 --> 29:24.000
So there are these people.

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000
They're called designers.

29:26.000 --> 29:29.000
They smell good generally.

29:29.000 --> 29:31.000
They dress well.

29:31.000 --> 29:42.000
And they're really good at sweet talking, corporate executives as every race, religion, creed, sexual orientation, age, country of origin into doing things that are –

29:42.000 --> 29:48.000
I'm trying to find a nice way to say this – completely idiotic, but look pretty.

29:48.000 --> 29:55.000
That coupled with the second problem of every – Matt bought our customers listening.

29:55.000 --> 29:57.000
I, of course, don't mean you.

29:57.000 --> 30:01.000
Every enterprise I have ever met ever has this fallacy.

30:01.000 --> 30:08.000
I can only think of two companies that I know have legitimate security concerns that I've worked with at least.

30:08.000 --> 30:21.000
I cannot think of a startup in the last almost 12 – almost 14 years that I've been doing this crap that didn't think that they were the NSA.

30:21.000 --> 30:32.000
They legitimately believe that someone wants to hack into their 20-year-old Gen Zers, want to hook up and have a good time app.

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
They legitimately believe that.

30:34.000 --> 30:42.000
But – so they do these – I have implemented more of these horrible completely breaks last past things than I care to mention.

30:42.000 --> 30:51.000
At the same time, they will have things like digital ocean accounts with passwords such as Robert1944.

30:51.000 --> 30:53.000
That's very specific.

30:53.000 --> 30:55.000
It is very specific.

30:55.000 --> 31:03.000
So you might not be able to log in, but you can certainly get on DO and go into the terminal console for the database and dump the whole thing.

31:03.000 --> 31:06.000
And this is just how people operate.

31:06.000 --> 31:07.000
Yeah.

31:07.000 --> 31:09.000
This is my plea.

31:09.000 --> 31:11.000
I don't think I'm going to solve world hunger.

31:11.000 --> 31:13.000
I'm not going to cure cancer.

31:13.000 --> 31:15.000
You haven't been making much progress on that one.

31:15.000 --> 31:16.000
No.

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
I'm not giving up, but I'm thinking.

31:18.000 --> 31:20.000
But this, we can make a difference.

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
We can make a difference.

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
It starts with every listener out there.

31:24.000 --> 31:29.000
When you get to a website that doesn't let you paste in a password, you give them some feedback.

31:29.000 --> 31:31.000
It starts with every developer out there.

31:31.000 --> 31:37.000
When somebody gives you a design decision that says to have a modal login, you say, I will not.

31:37.000 --> 31:38.000
I refuse.

31:38.000 --> 31:40.000
It starts with all of us.

31:40.000 --> 31:46.000
And then when you have no billings for that quarter, you write Linux Academy and ask them to send you some money.

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
You cannot beat the designers.

31:48.000 --> 31:53.000
Hey, man, this is the battle of our time, and it requires sacrifice.

31:53.000 --> 31:54.000
You can't make...

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
Yeah, you know what?

31:56.000 --> 32:00.000
I just want to say, they brought us iOS 7.

32:00.000 --> 32:02.000
You got to crack a few eggs.

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
They're unbeatable.

32:04.000 --> 32:06.000
They're monsters.

32:06.000 --> 32:08.000
We're not starting a design show anytime soon, right?

32:08.000 --> 32:09.000
Okay.

32:09.000 --> 32:10.000
No, not yet.

32:10.000 --> 32:11.000
Not now.

32:11.000 --> 32:20.000
No, we ought to talk about this thing that Canonical's doing that I don't think any other major Linux player is doing.

32:20.000 --> 32:25.000
Like, look at what Red Hat has going on, and they don't seem to be making a huge play for IoT devices.

32:25.000 --> 32:30.000
No, like Fedora's got some stuff, but not in the Fedora way, you know, it's off on its own.

32:30.000 --> 32:32.000
It's not like a Red Hat corporate push.

32:32.000 --> 32:33.000
Yeah, it's not a big corporate push.

32:33.000 --> 32:39.000
But Canonical has announced that the latest version of Ubuntu Core for IoT will get 10 years of commercial support.

32:39.000 --> 32:44.000
At 260 megabytes, Ubuntu Core is one of the smallest IoT platforms out there.

32:44.000 --> 32:50.000
They did that essentially by stripping out a ton of components from the main Ubuntu OS,

32:50.000 --> 32:53.000
and then figuring you could use snaps to replace some of that functionality.

32:53.000 --> 32:58.000
It also improves security by pulling a bunch of stuff out because you have a smaller attack surface.

32:58.000 --> 33:04.000
And when you consider the popularity of Ubuntu, Canonical has a pretty good pitch for their IoT platform here.

33:04.000 --> 33:09.000
It's got a wide range of applications, and Ubuntu Core enables a new class of app-centric things

33:09.000 --> 33:18.000
because you've got all of the snaps that are already like things like Plex and FTP servers and mail servers that are snapped up

33:18.000 --> 33:20.000
that you can put on an IoT device.

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
I think that's pretty compelling.

33:22.000 --> 33:30.000
You combine that with the smaller size, 260 megabytes, the fact that it's based off a 1804 LTS, and it gets 10 years of support.

33:30.000 --> 33:32.000
Oh, boy, howdy.

33:32.000 --> 33:36.000
Now all of a sudden you've got something pretty compelling to build off of here.

33:36.000 --> 33:42.000
I think, I mean, that seems like the major thing this guy has, right, is that it's everything you already know.

33:42.000 --> 33:44.000
It's the same Ubuntu.

33:44.000 --> 33:49.000
I mean, a little bit changed, but if you're already using snaps, if you're already familiar with the Ubuntu base, it's the same platform.

33:49.000 --> 33:52.000
You don't have to start using Alpine or something even more exotic.

33:52.000 --> 33:58.000
Well, it isn't kind of the same argument that has been really successful for Ubuntu with that argument being

33:58.000 --> 34:05.000
one of the great things about Ubuntu is you can run it on your desktop and build on your desktop or on your laptop for the same environment you're deploying in the cloud.

34:05.000 --> 34:07.000
Yeah, you match production right there.

34:07.000 --> 34:08.000
Well, same thing here, yeah.

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
Same thing with IoT devices.

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
That seems pretty super valuable.

34:12.000 --> 34:17.000
I mean, I'll admit, I end up deploying Ubuntu all kinds of places for the same reason.

34:17.000 --> 34:19.000
It's just easy, and I know how to use it.

34:19.000 --> 34:26.000
Now, I know in our off-air chats, Mike has looked a lot at IoT devices here and there over the years, even on our on-air chats.

34:26.000 --> 34:27.000
We've talked about it a bit.

34:27.000 --> 34:34.000
Have you really looked a lot about the lifecycle of the operating system of the devices that you end up shipping?

34:34.000 --> 34:35.000
Mike, is that something you factor in?

34:35.000 --> 34:38.000
Like, how long will it get security patches?

34:38.000 --> 34:39.000
Kind of.

34:39.000 --> 34:44.000
I mean, so this Ubuntu core thing is actually new to me, so this does look interesting.

34:44.000 --> 34:54.000
But yeah, it's generally any kind of LTS, and there are specialty versions of many Linux distros you can basically buy support plans for already.

34:54.000 --> 35:00.000
But if it's just something I'm kind of hacking on just to, you know, try something out or prototype something, I hardly pay attention at all.

35:00.000 --> 35:09.000
But having said that, Ubuntu core, you know, put a gun to my head, Greenfield project, I get to make all the decisions.

35:09.000 --> 35:13.000
This probably is the way I'd go because it's easy, something I know.

35:13.000 --> 35:20.000
Yeah, and you get the 10 years of support, which I feel like the reason why I'm kind of excited about it is not because I'm like an IoT nutjob or anything.

35:20.000 --> 35:27.000
It's just, like, if we're going to go down this path, for God's sakes, please figure out the software update.

35:27.000 --> 35:28.000
Yeah, right.

35:28.000 --> 35:31.000
It'd be nice if they could just update things a little bit more, but clearly that's not happening.

35:31.000 --> 35:33.000
This is the best alternative.

35:33.000 --> 35:41.000
What gets me so frustrated is this was a problem we foresaw when we started seeing all of these consumer-grade routers.

35:41.000 --> 35:44.000
We all looked at that and went, well, we're not doing any kind of universal update.

35:44.000 --> 35:45.000
No one's updating these.

35:45.000 --> 35:46.000
This is a huge problem.

35:46.000 --> 35:47.000
What are we doing?

35:47.000 --> 35:50.000
That was a preview of what the IoT mess could be.

35:50.000 --> 36:02.000
And we have seen what that results in in terms of botnets dominating these devices, taking over people's DNS, exploiting zero days these things are riddled with, default passwords that are like the MAC address, like the list goes on and on.

36:02.000 --> 36:03.000
That's routers.

36:03.000 --> 36:09.000
Like, we need to take those lessons seriously and build IoT devices that reflect those lessons.

36:09.000 --> 36:17.000
And one of the core lessons is you need an update mechanism and channel to these devices to keep them secure because they're connected to people's networks.

36:17.000 --> 36:22.000
And that's one of the things Azure Sphere offers that I think is very compelling, a complete update lifecycle.

36:22.000 --> 36:30.000
Well, this is Canonical offering the same thing from the Linux side of camp, but it's a much more B2B kind of relationship because Canonical is a manageable-sized company.

36:30.000 --> 36:35.000
So if you're a reasonably small to large-sized company, you could work directly with Canonical.

36:35.000 --> 36:36.000
That's a huge benefit.

36:36.000 --> 36:37.000
That is, right.

36:37.000 --> 36:43.000
Combine that with the fact that they've already, you know, with their phone exploration, like they've already pushed their OS to all kinds of similar spaces.

36:43.000 --> 36:44.000
Right.

36:44.000 --> 36:46.000
And you're likely already using it on the cloud.

36:46.000 --> 36:54.000
So it's just, I think it's a pretty clever play and I think they don't get enough attention for it because IoT OSs are just one of those things that people don't talk a lot about.

36:54.000 --> 36:59.000
It's hard to because with the long support cycle, like the last core release was ages ago.

36:59.000 --> 37:02.000
So this is the first time we've been talking about it for a long time.

37:02.000 --> 37:03.000
Yeah.

37:03.000 --> 37:05.000
I mean, I'm sorry, guys, I was distracted.

37:05.000 --> 37:06.000
I was watching my Ubuntu TV.

37:06.000 --> 37:10.000
What are we talking about?

37:10.000 --> 37:11.000
I'm sorry.

37:11.000 --> 37:12.000
I got a call on my Ubuntu phone.

37:12.000 --> 37:13.000
I couldn't hear.

37:13.000 --> 37:16.000
All right.

37:16.000 --> 37:17.000
Hang on.

37:17.000 --> 37:18.000
My Tizen is ringing.

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
I'll be right back.

37:20.000 --> 37:23.000
You got your bell rang this week on Twitter.

37:23.000 --> 37:24.000
I saw you start tweeting about this.

37:24.000 --> 37:25.000
I knew you were percolating.

37:25.000 --> 37:29.000
And it starts with a simple tweet by Andrew Madsen.

37:29.000 --> 37:39.000
He writes, it's weird how the iOS community has shifted so much from iOS development to Swift, quote unquote.

37:39.000 --> 37:47.000
Five years on and a huge part of what everyone's doing revolves around the language and not how to create great apps.

37:47.000 --> 37:49.000
Why is that?

37:49.000 --> 37:53.000
And then after, let's see, let's see.

37:53.000 --> 37:54.000
That was at that.

37:54.000 --> 37:55.000
I'm just doing a little time math here.

37:55.000 --> 37:56.000
Mm hmm.

37:56.000 --> 37:57.000
Analyzing.

37:57.000 --> 38:00.000
So Mike percolates on it for around 12 to 16 hours.

38:00.000 --> 38:01.000
And he says, you know what?

38:01.000 --> 38:02.000
Thinking more about this conversation.

38:02.000 --> 38:04.000
This is now our our our host, Michael Dominic.

38:04.000 --> 38:09.000
So he's thinking more about this conversation, about how iOS dev and macOS dev scenes have changed online.

38:09.000 --> 38:13.000
It occurs to me that there is a platform where do you think I'm doing a good Mike?

38:13.000 --> 38:14.000
Oh, yeah.

38:14.000 --> 38:15.000
Keep it up.

38:15.000 --> 38:22.000
It occurs to me there is a platform where the past ethos of just build cool things lives.

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
And that's desktop Linux.

38:24.000 --> 38:28.000
You can see it in particular on elementary OS.

38:28.000 --> 38:29.000
Oh, man.

38:29.000 --> 38:30.000
And, you know, I got to completely agree.

38:30.000 --> 38:35.000
I said I think it's a fair point on the iOS side and the Mac side.

38:35.000 --> 38:39.000
Things are driven by the trends of the mega corporation that drives it.

38:39.000 --> 38:40.000
Probably rightfully so.

38:40.000 --> 38:41.000
And right now that is Swift.

38:41.000 --> 38:45.000
So you see the culture of the community sort of a line.

38:45.000 --> 38:46.000
It's it's it.

38:46.000 --> 38:52.000
There is a long stick to it sometimes with the Apple community, but you do eventually see them kind of fall in line with the Apple ethos.

38:52.000 --> 38:55.000
This is interesting because it's a flip side.

38:55.000 --> 38:58.000
We talk a lot about the benefits of having that sort of corporate backing, right?

38:58.000 --> 39:01.000
But open source is often the scratch your own itch community.

39:01.000 --> 39:05.000
Right. It's sort of like the last bastion of scratch your own itch.

39:05.000 --> 39:09.000
And I think that's pretty profound pondering you're doing there, Mr. Dominic.

39:09.000 --> 39:13.000
Yeah, I mean, there is one other thing I would probably add.

39:13.000 --> 39:23.000
Long time listeners and probably not less will know that I had a Chris, how can we say this, a passionate reaction to the announcement of Swift?

39:23.000 --> 39:25.000
An allergic, you might say. Oh, my.

39:25.000 --> 39:29.000
You know, I actually went back and re-listened to that episode kind of recently.

39:29.000 --> 39:31.000
It's not a great look to do that.

39:31.000 --> 39:33.000
I was like panicked you were going to bail at any moment.

39:33.000 --> 39:34.000
It was. Yeah.

39:34.000 --> 39:35.000
Like just throw a chair.

39:35.000 --> 39:38.000
I had a little flashback moment when I listened to that.

39:38.000 --> 39:44.000
So there is an alternate universe, theoretically.

39:44.000 --> 39:52.000
And I think this is other people, not me, saw Swift and realized what they could do was because it was brand new.

39:52.000 --> 40:02.000
Because Apple, as you guys are saying, does basically control the iOS ecosystem, the iOS development ecosystem in particular, and to a lesser extent, Mac.

40:02.000 --> 40:03.000
There was an opportunity.

40:03.000 --> 40:05.000
It was basically resetting the board, right?

40:05.000 --> 40:06.000
There would be some opportunity.

40:06.000 --> 40:09.000
And we see this, how many Swift podcasts exist now?

40:09.000 --> 40:10.000
How many Swift blogs, right?

40:10.000 --> 40:11.000
Yeah.

40:11.000 --> 40:12.000
To position yours.

40:12.000 --> 40:13.000
Right.

40:13.000 --> 40:16.000
To basically climb the ladder, so to speak, in the community.

40:16.000 --> 40:18.000
Position yourself as a Swift expert.

40:18.000 --> 40:21.000
I'm using snare quotes here.

40:21.000 --> 40:28.000
There was a little resistant by some very few people who didn't want to switch.

40:28.000 --> 40:30.000
I think people just tried to seize that opportunity.

40:30.000 --> 40:35.000
And then the reality is Apple has been really aggressive at pushing Swift.

40:35.000 --> 40:44.000
So if you really love the Mac platform, if you love iOS, well, you're crazy not to embrace Swift.

40:44.000 --> 40:51.000
What's interesting is that something else happened at the same time, which is all the indies basically got killed.

40:51.000 --> 41:01.000
You know, even I believe somebody can fact check me and apologies if I'm wrong, but I believe a couple of months ago, even Panic Software, one of the biggest Apple ecosystem development companies,

41:01.000 --> 41:05.000
that independent app makers had layoffs, right?

41:05.000 --> 41:07.000
Black Pixel has had layoffs.

41:07.000 --> 41:08.000
In fact, they had to merge with somebody.

41:08.000 --> 41:18.000
All of these, if you were in the Apple community in the early to mid 2000s, the mid aughts, these were kind of the big guys that you looked up to.

41:18.000 --> 41:20.000
Not that they're gone, right?

41:20.000 --> 41:21.000
They're not like gone, gone.

41:21.000 --> 41:35.000
But many of them have either refocused on consulting, writing enterprise apps for larger corporations or, you know, still have their products, but don't make that much money on them, right?

41:35.000 --> 41:37.000
Have shrunk.

41:37.000 --> 41:48.000
I mean, OmniGraph, the Omni group rather has been pretty open in the last, I would say, five years about discussing, you know, some of the changes that have happened to the market.

41:48.000 --> 41:51.000
So take all those things together, right?

41:51.000 --> 42:03.000
Take the fact that there's definitely an opportunity for, you know, look, when Swift came out and we, I remember when like the first Swift Focus podcast came out, that mother jumped the charts, like choose Linux.

42:03.000 --> 42:04.000
There's your plug.

42:04.000 --> 42:06.000
There's your plug, Jason.

42:06.000 --> 42:07.000
Why?

42:07.000 --> 42:18.000
Well, because one, Apple controls the iTunes charts and two, it was an opportunity for an ambitious person to basically try to, you know, jump up in the ranks.

42:18.000 --> 42:21.000
And also all the NDS are like broke now.

42:21.000 --> 42:26.000
I mean, I can't, I know Linux hippies that this is going to feel weird for you.

42:26.000 --> 42:30.000
People used to sell their software for money.

42:30.000 --> 42:38.000
And like there were these small companies that used to make a lot of money just selling Mac OS apps and to a lesser extent iOS apps.

42:38.000 --> 42:49.000
And that is, I mean, I'm sure there are edge cases still, and obviously Panic! and Omni still exist, but that is just not in general the case anymore.

42:49.000 --> 42:52.000
Wow. See, that was always touted to me as one of the like professional aspects.

42:52.000 --> 42:59.000
Like sure, there might not be as much open source stuff, but if you've got the money and you have work to do, there are applications to do it.

42:59.000 --> 43:01.000
I mean, some of the big ones are still there.

43:01.000 --> 43:13.000
You know what, but there's also in those applications, and I'm wondering if you see this as much on the Android side, Wes, there is a big, hard shift to subscriptions.

43:13.000 --> 43:22.000
Every kind of productivity app I've gotten on the iPad Pro that is a large productivity app mostly is being monetized by a monthly, not by an in-app.

43:22.000 --> 43:24.000
Not all of them, but I'd say 95%.

43:24.000 --> 43:38.000
And now, Hadeah loves using the pencil on the iPad Pro to draw. Those are like sign up for $9 a month to get the drawing for new drawings and new colors and new tips and stuff like that.

43:38.000 --> 43:41.000
Like everything is being monetized with a monthly subscription.

43:41.000 --> 43:43.000
I guess we're just okay with it now, right?

43:43.000 --> 43:46.000
I mean, you might not actually be, but people seem to be paying.

43:46.000 --> 43:56.000
I feel like I understand why, because software development is an ongoing process of creating the software, maintaining the software, providing support, adding new features, adding.

43:56.000 --> 44:03.000
Even if you just keep up with the mobile platform pace of development, Android's true in this case too, perhaps not as rapid, but true.

44:03.000 --> 44:11.000
You have to just maintain at a certain point to stay in the Play Store, to stay in the App Store, and that takes time and money.

44:11.000 --> 44:16.000
Then you combine people emailing you for support, people that want new features.

44:16.000 --> 44:20.000
I guess really the old model sort of assumed a certain amount of growth, right?

44:20.000 --> 44:23.000
The only way it was sustainable is that you had new customers.

44:23.000 --> 44:25.000
That's it. That's it.

44:25.000 --> 44:28.000
And you could bump major versions and get another $100.

44:28.000 --> 44:32.000
Right. You might do that. You might have like a limited license, whatever.

44:32.000 --> 44:43.000
Yeah. And like I touched on last week, not to beat this dead horse, but I think both Google and Apple are incentivized to have ongoing subscriptions.

44:43.000 --> 44:48.000
If they can turn all of these apps into little subscriptions, will they get a cut of that?

44:48.000 --> 44:53.000
So the owners of these stores are incentivized to encourage this behavior.

44:53.000 --> 44:55.000
Just make predictable income for everyone.

44:55.000 --> 44:58.000
Which means keep prices low so that way we can get monthlies.

44:58.000 --> 45:15.000
Yeah, but for that to make sense, and I think this is where some of the Indies have ended up going, you need a lot of people buying your $5 a month or $20 a year or whatever it's going to be subscription.

45:15.000 --> 45:17.000
I mean, you need a lot of people.

45:17.000 --> 45:18.000
I don't know.

45:18.000 --> 45:32.000
I mean, if you get 500 people that are all paying $5 a month, that might matter more than 1,000 people that download it for free, but only 100 of them.

45:32.000 --> 45:33.000
I mean, I don't know.

45:33.000 --> 45:36.000
You got to look at the – it depends on what your sales might be.

45:36.000 --> 45:37.000
There's a lot of things there.

45:37.000 --> 45:50.000
But like for – you look at Patreon, it's a similar system there. You can have a content creator that can make a few thousand dollars a month on Patreon but can then afford to distribute content to hundreds of thousands of people.

45:50.000 --> 45:55.000
So subscriptions do work in certain kinds of situations.

45:55.000 --> 46:04.000
They can, but I think this is where sometimes talking to people who weren't like super Apple-focused back in the day, it's not like Patreon, right?

46:04.000 --> 46:08.000
It's not like you're writing – you're a one-man band writing an app and let's take your $5 a month.

46:08.000 --> 46:11.000
That's $60 a year.

46:11.000 --> 46:16.000
500 people, is that $30,000 if my math is correct?

46:16.000 --> 46:21.000
The Indies that exist in the Mac ecosystem weren't – of course, they were into one-guys, right?

46:21.000 --> 46:23.000
They were one-man, one-woman shops, of course.

46:23.000 --> 46:25.000
I'm not saying they weren't.

46:25.000 --> 46:31.000
But the ones that people tend to think about were small businesses that employed five to ten people.

46:31.000 --> 46:34.000
30 grand for an app is a dev site, right?

46:34.000 --> 46:39.000
That's not even like – that's not even half of a dev salary except for like super junior people.

46:39.000 --> 46:40.000
Yeah, you're right.

46:40.000 --> 46:44.000
The subscriptions, it either has to be – okay, for that – yeah, right.

46:44.000 --> 46:48.000
If you're talking about a company that's more than ten people, yeah, it's got to be a pretty big scale.

46:48.000 --> 46:49.000
Well, even five, right?

46:49.000 --> 46:52.000
Let's just say you're five software developers.

46:52.000 --> 46:55.000
Then I'm going to – okay, we're going to make lots of assumptions, right?

46:55.000 --> 46:57.000
We're going to say US or Europe.

46:57.000 --> 47:03.000
Why would you work for – why would you – it's just not enough money.

47:03.000 --> 47:05.000
But it used to be, right?

47:05.000 --> 47:12.000
Remember, OmniGraffle used to be a couple hundred dollars for one license, right?

47:12.000 --> 47:16.000
Same thing for all of Panic stuff and prices have gone down over the years.

47:16.000 --> 47:22.000
These were little companies making quarter million, half million dollars just doing their independent apps.

47:22.000 --> 47:28.000
God's honest truth, other than some of the old ones who are still stuck around, I cannot name.

47:28.000 --> 47:30.000
In fact, I would actually challenge you guys.

47:30.000 --> 47:39.000
Can you name a new app, and we'll just use the term loosely, any platform you care to mention where they're just selling it to consumers or to small businesses, right?

47:39.000 --> 47:45.000
Any new company since let's say 2014 that has started or launched something.

47:45.000 --> 47:46.000
Oh, boy.

47:46.000 --> 47:48.000
It's like a standalone product.

47:48.000 --> 47:49.000
You got me with new company.

47:49.000 --> 47:52.000
That is not also a consultancy, right?

47:52.000 --> 47:53.000
Because I don't count.

47:53.000 --> 47:55.000
On the App Store, yes.

47:55.000 --> 47:58.000
You know, like things like Drafts and IA Writer.

47:58.000 --> 48:01.000
But not on the desktop.

48:01.000 --> 48:04.000
Not on any of my desktops, no.

48:04.000 --> 48:05.000
There's been nothing.

48:05.000 --> 48:06.000
No, man.

48:06.000 --> 48:07.000
Wow.

48:07.000 --> 48:08.000
I can name one.

48:08.000 --> 48:09.000
What?

48:09.000 --> 48:14.000
If they would just let ISH into the App Store, that guy, they'd be in great shape.

48:14.000 --> 48:15.000
Yeah.

48:15.000 --> 48:16.000
That would be nice.

48:16.000 --> 48:17.000
That would be nice.

48:17.000 --> 48:20.000
That does make me ponder.

48:20.000 --> 48:24.000
I think that we should all make those businesses fail.

48:24.000 --> 48:25.000
Still hate you, Richard.

48:25.000 --> 48:26.000
Still hate you.

48:26.000 --> 48:28.000
He accomplished his mission apparently.

48:28.000 --> 48:33.000
So can we talk about hardware for one more moment?

48:33.000 --> 48:34.000
One more time?

48:34.000 --> 48:35.000
I know.

48:35.000 --> 48:36.000
I'm pretty depressed about the software.

48:36.000 --> 48:37.000
I know.

48:37.000 --> 48:38.000
Let's try.

48:38.000 --> 48:39.000
Hang on.

48:39.000 --> 48:40.000
Let me spill this water.

48:40.000 --> 48:43.000
I think we're in a really interesting time for hardware.

48:43.000 --> 48:48.000
So Mike's got these two System76 rigs that come out of the box, run on Linux.

48:48.000 --> 48:49.000
Pretty nice.

48:49.000 --> 48:51.000
Great options for developers.

48:51.000 --> 48:53.000
Plus, Dell's got their developer line.

48:53.000 --> 48:54.000
Yeah.

48:54.000 --> 48:57.000
Wes and I can attest the T480 runs Linux perfectly well.

48:57.000 --> 48:58.000
Sure does.

48:58.000 --> 49:00.000
Flawlessly, if you want to get a ThinkPad.

49:00.000 --> 49:08.000
And then today, there is a rumor out that there will be a 13-inch MacBook with 32 gigabytes

49:08.000 --> 49:09.000
of RAM.

49:09.000 --> 49:10.000
32?

49:10.000 --> 49:15.000
Boy, I mean, that's a number I had hoped for for a long time.

49:15.000 --> 49:18.000
I know we're not allowed to make predictions anymore.

49:18.000 --> 49:24.000
But I, unlike Mike, I'm actually feeling pretty good about Apple's hardware prospects.

49:24.000 --> 49:25.000
That's a big change.

49:25.000 --> 49:26.000
I mean, right?

49:26.000 --> 49:27.000
Like a year ago, that was not the case.

49:27.000 --> 49:28.000
Yeah.

49:28.000 --> 49:29.000
I was, I think, the most vocal critic on this show about it.

49:29.000 --> 49:34.000
But I'm looking at where Intel's chips that are likely going to ship in 2019 are going

49:34.000 --> 49:37.000
to land, what might make it in the MacBooks.

49:37.000 --> 49:43.000
And I feel like since the iMac Pro was a pretty big hit, the Mac Mini seemed like a pretty

49:43.000 --> 49:44.000
solid release.

49:44.000 --> 49:45.000
Yeah.

49:45.000 --> 49:46.000
I feel like they're getting momentum.

49:46.000 --> 49:51.000
They're getting their heads around this again, is what I suspect, right as Mike is a completely

49:51.000 --> 49:52.000
jumping chip.

49:52.000 --> 49:53.000
What are your thoughts on that?

49:53.000 --> 49:57.000
Just as we wrap up the hardware thing, because I'll tell you, I look at this and I think

49:57.000 --> 50:03.000
to myself, Mike, I could be in the market for a 13-inch MacBook Pro.

50:03.000 --> 50:06.000
I thought no one needed more than 16 gigs of RAM.

50:06.000 --> 50:07.000
I'm kidding.

50:07.000 --> 50:12.000
Well, I'd use that to run a Linux VM.

50:12.000 --> 50:13.000
Exactly.

50:13.000 --> 50:15.000
I heard something very, very different.

50:15.000 --> 50:16.000
So, it's weird.

50:16.000 --> 50:19.000
I heard there was going to be a 16-inch one.

50:19.000 --> 50:20.000
Oh, yeah.

50:20.000 --> 50:21.000
No, it's both.

50:21.000 --> 50:22.000
Yeah.

50:22.000 --> 50:23.000
That is the problem.

50:23.000 --> 50:24.000
It's both.

50:24.000 --> 50:25.000
Who cares about it?

50:25.000 --> 50:26.000
Nobody.

50:26.000 --> 50:27.000
Who's going to buy that?

50:27.000 --> 50:28.000
Nobody.

50:28.000 --> 50:29.000
I mean, that is kind of a serious workstation, I guess.

50:29.000 --> 50:30.000
Yeah.

50:30.000 --> 50:31.000
That would be pretty cool.

50:31.000 --> 50:32.000
But that sucker should go to 64 gigs.

50:32.000 --> 50:35.000
But 32 gigs in a 13-inch, I am all on the 13-inch laptop.

50:35.000 --> 50:36.000
I will never buy it.

50:36.000 --> 50:38.000
You run all the Linux VMs you need.

50:38.000 --> 50:41.000
I will never buy a larger laptop than 13 inches from now on.

50:41.000 --> 50:43.000
For the rest of my life, I don't think I'll...

50:43.000 --> 50:44.000
I'd give 14, I think.

50:44.000 --> 50:45.000
But you're right with that.

50:45.000 --> 50:46.000
I mean, you travel enough though.

50:46.000 --> 50:47.000
That's hard.

50:47.000 --> 50:48.000
Yeah.

50:48.000 --> 50:49.000
It's crazy.

50:49.000 --> 50:50.000
Yeah.

50:50.000 --> 50:51.000
That could make sense.

50:51.000 --> 50:54.000
I mean, my biggest concern, to get me to go back to a MacBook in any kind of serious capacity,

50:54.000 --> 50:57.000
I would need a keyboard that is not defeated by a grain of sand.

50:57.000 --> 50:58.000
Yeah.

50:58.000 --> 51:01.000
I know I'm half joking, but I've taken so many of them in for that.

51:01.000 --> 51:02.000
That's fair.

51:02.000 --> 51:06.000
What's the early word on that Darter keyboard and trackpad?

51:06.000 --> 51:07.000
It is...

51:07.000 --> 51:08.000
Okay.

51:08.000 --> 51:14.000
So, spoiler alert, and I don't think Sub776 is going to like this comment.

51:14.000 --> 51:16.000
Don't buy the Galaga.

51:16.000 --> 51:18.000
The Darter is so much better in both.

51:18.000 --> 51:23.000
The keyboards, that's a taste thing, but the trackpad is so much more accurate.

51:23.000 --> 51:29.000
Not that the Galaga is bad, but the Galaga is your basic like Windowsy, you know, non-Apple

51:29.000 --> 51:30.000
trackpad.

51:30.000 --> 51:31.000
The Darter is much closer.

51:31.000 --> 51:37.000
Now, they still aren't like a MacBook trackpad, because apparently Apple is the only people

51:37.000 --> 51:43.000
who've learned the arcane magics required to make a good trackpad, but it's significantly

51:43.000 --> 51:46.000
better, and it's about as good as you would get on say an XPS.

51:46.000 --> 51:47.000
Okay.

51:47.000 --> 51:48.000
That's interesting.

51:48.000 --> 51:49.000
There's a lot going on.

51:49.000 --> 51:50.000
It's just a lot.

51:50.000 --> 51:52.000
I don't know what to make of any of it, Mr. West.

51:52.000 --> 51:53.000
I know.

51:53.000 --> 51:54.000
I'm kind of...

51:54.000 --> 51:56.000
It's nice that the T480 has been so solid, because I don't have to think about it, at

51:56.000 --> 51:57.000
least for like a little bit.

51:57.000 --> 51:58.000
Yeah.

51:58.000 --> 52:02.000
I've been getting tweets asking, people asking to listen to the show, if we still recommend

52:02.000 --> 52:03.000
the T480.

52:03.000 --> 52:06.000
I've gotten a couple, so I figured we'd address it on the show.

52:06.000 --> 52:07.000
Yeah.

52:07.000 --> 52:08.000
It's something that I think I'd still recommend.

52:08.000 --> 52:09.000
Yeah.

52:09.000 --> 52:13.000
It's no beauty, but it is pretty solid just as a workstation.

52:13.000 --> 52:14.000
What do you think?

52:14.000 --> 52:17.000
I've been thinking I might recommend it at high DPI.

52:17.000 --> 52:18.000
Yeah.

52:18.000 --> 52:21.000
I mean, it depends on what your workflow is and how much that matters to you.

52:21.000 --> 52:24.000
I think one advantage is if you don't go high DPI, it can be pretty simple.

52:24.000 --> 52:30.120
You have like XFCE on here, and you just used it for some appliance type situation.

52:30.120 --> 52:32.000
That would be a really good machine.

52:32.000 --> 52:33.000
Yeah.

52:33.000 --> 52:39.200
For me, I think the MacBook might be a more effective machine for me just because I am

52:39.200 --> 52:42.100
very unhappy with Linux audio stack right now.

52:42.100 --> 52:43.580
As you know, I'm very unhappy.

52:43.580 --> 52:44.840
We don't need to go in on the show.

52:44.840 --> 52:46.800
So I think for me, that might be the direction I go.

52:46.800 --> 52:51.580
We'll see where it goes, but I think it's going to be a strong year, and the overall

52:51.580 --> 52:54.760
trends probably won't change much, but I think they're going to have a strong year.

52:54.760 --> 52:59.280
Well, if you're going Apple before we cut out here, what about Mac Pro?

52:59.280 --> 53:03.680
Isn't that the hotness if you're waiting on a Mac that – I know you travel a lot, so

53:03.680 --> 53:06.840
it's probably – do you foresee a Mac Pro in studio?

53:06.840 --> 53:07.840
No.

53:07.840 --> 53:09.840
What would it take for that to happen?

53:09.840 --> 53:12.760
I mean, I can't even think of that.

53:12.760 --> 53:13.760
They'd have to basically make a Thalio.

53:13.760 --> 53:14.760
That's what they'd have to do.

53:14.760 --> 53:15.760
Like if the Thalio was a –

53:15.760 --> 53:16.760
Yeah, that'd be nice.

53:16.760 --> 53:17.760
Yeah.

53:17.760 --> 53:21.880
Because I really – I think that's great hardware.

53:21.880 --> 53:28.360
I just simply – I've had an – I've had an ongoing relationship with Linux Audio

53:28.360 --> 53:33.640
Stack for a long time now, and we just recently decided to see other people.

53:33.640 --> 53:41.300
We're happy, and we're still sharing custody of the studio, but we decided for both Linux

53:41.300 --> 53:43.360
Audio Stack and for myself, it's just better if we see other people.

53:43.360 --> 53:45.040
Core Audio just does something for you.

53:45.040 --> 53:46.040
Well, yeah.

53:46.040 --> 53:47.760
That's not on – that's not on Pulse.

53:47.760 --> 53:49.280
That's nothing – that's just between Core Audio and I.

53:49.280 --> 53:50.280
It's not –

53:50.280 --> 53:51.280
Sure.

53:51.280 --> 53:52.280
Nothing on Pulse.

53:52.280 --> 53:53.280
So, yeah.

53:53.280 --> 53:54.280
That's where I'm at.

53:54.280 --> 53:55.280
Oh, God.

53:55.280 --> 53:56.280
Okay.

53:56.280 --> 53:57.280
Mr. Dominic, where should people find you throughout the week?

53:57.280 --> 53:58.280
At Tumultco on Twitter.

53:58.280 --> 53:59.280
That's fair enough.

53:59.280 --> 54:00.280
I can't believe that's it, but that is the show somehow.

54:00.280 --> 54:01.280
It's nice being here with you guys.

54:01.280 --> 54:02.280
It's a lot of fun.

54:02.280 --> 54:03.280
Thank you for having me.

54:03.280 --> 54:06.760
I don't know if I'll be back next week, but I do like being here.

54:06.760 --> 54:08.260
We'd like to hear your feedback.

54:08.260 --> 54:10.480
We need to get more questions and feedback into the show.

54:10.480 --> 54:11.480
Our feedback section –

54:11.480 --> 54:12.480
We do need some.

54:12.480 --> 54:13.480
Yeah, come on.

54:13.480 --> 54:14.480
Let us know.

54:14.480 --> 54:18.880
The downloads are still there, so people are still listening, but they're not writing

54:18.880 --> 54:19.880
in.

54:19.880 --> 54:23.720
You, dear audience member, only you can change that.

54:23.720 --> 54:27.400
We make dramatic changes to the show, and we hear just from a few people.

54:27.400 --> 54:28.400
It's very confusing.

54:28.400 --> 54:32.560
So let us know, because otherwise we're left here assuming probably the worst about

54:32.560 --> 54:33.920
you, really, if you think about it.

54:33.920 --> 54:34.920
Isn't that –

54:34.920 --> 54:35.920
Therefore, us.

54:35.920 --> 54:36.920
It's human nature.

54:36.920 --> 54:37.920
It is human.

54:37.920 --> 54:41.280
So the only way you can fix it is by going to coder.show and then hit the contact link.

54:41.280 --> 54:42.280
See?

54:42.280 --> 54:43.280
There's a solution there for you.

54:43.280 --> 54:44.280
It's easy.

54:44.280 --> 54:47.360
You can subscribe to the show there, coder.show slash subscribe, and you can grab links to

54:47.360 --> 54:51.560
all the things we talked about at coder.show slash 355.

54:51.560 --> 54:55.240
Mr. Payne, where can people find the excellently new revamped TechSnap program?

54:55.240 --> 54:56.640
TechSnap dot systems.

54:56.640 --> 55:00.080
Go there to find out why you should probably already be using QoS at home.

55:00.080 --> 55:01.080
Yeah.

55:01.080 --> 55:03.560
Yeah, and some cool tools in that episode as well.

55:03.560 --> 55:04.840
I'm at Chris Ellis.

55:04.840 --> 55:06.040
The network is at Jupyter Signal.

55:06.040 --> 55:07.320
We do this show live on a Monday.

55:07.320 --> 55:12.920
You can go to JupyterBroadcasting.com slash calendar to get that, jblive.tv to watch

55:12.920 --> 55:13.920
that.

55:13.920 --> 55:17.520
Thanks for joining us on this week's episode of the Coder Radio program, and we'll see

55:17.520 --> 55:47.200
you right back here next week.
