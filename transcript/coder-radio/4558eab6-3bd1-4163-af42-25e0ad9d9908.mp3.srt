00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
This is Koto Radio, episode 312 for June 4th, 2018.

2
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,040
Hi everyone and welcome to Koto Radio, Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show, taking a

3
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:40,200
pragmatic look at the art and business of software development and its related technologies.

4
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:44,680
This episode is brought to you by our two great sponsors, DigitalOcean and Linux Academy.

5
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:48,120
I'll tell you more about those great sponsors as this here show goes on.

6
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:54,000
My name is Chris and joining us every single week is our host, Mr. Michael Dominic.

7
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,080
Hello, Mike.

8
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:57,840
Hello, Mr. Chris.

9
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:58,840
How are you doing?

10
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:02,680
Are you up all hours of the morning watching keynotes and reading tech news today?

11
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:05,280
I have been so deep in the tech news.

12
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,300
This is like a gift from the tech gods.

13
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:11,920
It has been a big day, as they say, because it was officially announced today.

14
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:16,280
It's been rumored for a little bit, but officially announced today that Microsoft is acquiring

15
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:17,280
GitHub.

16
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,280
That process has now started.

17
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:19,280
It is public.

18
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,280
We're going to be talking about that.

19
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:25,480
And of course, it's also Apple's WWDC 2018 kickoff keynote day.

20
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:27,460
So a lot to talk about today.

21
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:31,320
Everything we took notes and we came prepared, like you got a beer and I took notes.

22
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:34,540
So I think we're pretty much set.

23
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:37,720
So let's do that to go.

24
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:42,040
Let's save feedback for next week, because we've got so much to get into that I think

25
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:44,240
we should probably just start here.

26
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:46,960
And let's save the GitHub stuff for a little bit.

27
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:50,440
And let's kick off with the news of the day, which is WWDC.

28
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:52,880
We both just got done watching and streaming.

29
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:59,820
And it really came down to a few sections, iOS 12, watchOS 5, the Mac, and that really

30
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:00,820
was kind of it.

31
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:01,820
There wasn't really...

32
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:02,820
There was no HomePod mentioned.

33
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:03,820
So I'm sorry.

34
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:04,820
I know that disappointed you.

35
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:05,820
No HomePod.

36
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:08,360
I cried.

37
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:13,200
And Apple TV, I suppose, was in the mix too, but I didn't take many notes for Apple TV.

38
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,680
So let's start with iOS 12.

39
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:15,680
What do you say?

40
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,680
Yeah.

41
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:22,200
You know, I think just right up front, we need to remind the listenership that WWDC

42
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:25,280
stands for Worldwide Developer Conference.

43
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:30,520
That's something that may have been easy to forget during this presentation.

44
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:33,680
I was not pleased.

45
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,680
So iOS 12.

46
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:37,520
I mean, maybe we should get your impressions first, because I'm going to come down pretty

47
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,520
hard.

48
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,740
Nothing major.

49
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:45,400
The newest stuff, they really sort of started off with performance, particularly performance

50
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:48,560
for oldest devices, which that's going to sell.

51
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:52,920
They announced a new cross-device VR file format that Adobe's working with too to create

52
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:56,480
content creation tools called.USDZ.

53
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:01,120
And they announced a new AR app called Measure, as well as some updates to Photos to try to

54
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,120
get more competitive with Google Photos.

55
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:09,160
But I think the big stuff, which I can save if you want, was the Siri stuff.

56
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:12,720
Yeah, the Siri shortcut is interesting.

57
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,760
It looks pretty limited.

58
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:20,080
I don't, you know, I would like less Siri in my life in general.

59
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:24,040
I don't see a whole ton of people running out and writing apps specifically to take

60
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:25,700
advantage of the Siri shortcuts.

61
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:30,720
So the Siri shortcuts is also, well, it's really more of a user thing too, because you

62
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:36,440
can assign your own phrases and then essentially like using workflow style macros, create little

63
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:40,780
functions like I'm going home and then it gets you directions, set your home kit settings

64
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:46,880
to 70 degrees, sends a text to a significant other, and then begins to play the NPR radio,

65
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,880
whatever you may have set in your macro.

66
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:54,080
So that way Apple doesn't have to try to invent every possible esoteric use case for Siri.

67
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,320
They're just going to let users create it.

68
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:57,760
They just basically punt it.

69
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,680
Let the apps do the work.

70
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,960
Let the apps do the work.

71
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:01,960
Yeah.

72
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:06,200
And a bunch of core apps got iPad versions, app limits, which give you now reminders to

73
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,680
take a break.

74
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:12,280
Collectivity reports, based on what you see too, you can give your kids allowances based

75
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:16,400
on how they use their device, i.e. if they use their devices less, you can reward them.

76
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:21,320
They announced Apple Books, which is replacing iBooks, and some changes to notifications

77
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:25,980
like group notifications by topic, thread, and app, and group FaceTime.

78
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:29,880
That's really the things that stood out to me for iOS 12.

79
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:32,520
Now you seem like you got a different impression.

80
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:33,520
Yeah.

81
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:37,760
I, you know, I would almost rather take the conference as a whole.

82
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:38,760
Okay.

83
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:44,840
I only saw maybe, or the conference, the keynote as a whole, I only saw maybe three, maybe

84
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:49,200
four things that really were interesting to developers, and I'm not going to count dark

85
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:52,200
mode for Xcode or Mac OS.

86
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:56,600
One because Xcode finally getting dark mode is not something they should be bragging about.

87
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:59,000
Just throwing it out there.

88
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:06,980
Some of the ML stuff around Core ML 2 and their machine kit stuff with Swift looks interesting,

89
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:12,860
but that is a major departure from how that domain space typically works.

90
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:18,680
And I'm not convinced that it's going to be attractive for a lot of people to basically

91
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:26,320
train their models, their machine learning models, using a GUI app on a Mac in Swift,

92
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:31,520
especially when a lot of machine learning algorithms work really well with Nvidia CUDA

93
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:37,000
cards and Apple does not offer that.

94
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,960
So that felt odd to me.

95
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:43,640
I guess the desired use case is one might want to add some sort of machine learning

96
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:49,060
element to an existing application or into a Mac or iOS app, and this is just an easy

97
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:53,900
way to do that coming from the position of an iOS developer.

98
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:59,480
It's certainly interesting, certainly accelerating with Metal may give Metal a reason to exist.

99
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:02,560
That's not games.

100
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:09,780
I felt a little bit like, honestly, the big plan for this keynote was going to be Marzipan,

101
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:14,360
the cross-platform iOS and Mac thing they mentioned at the end, but it just wasn't ready.

102
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:16,800
Yeah, so let's talk about that.

103
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:21,260
Let's talk about Marzipan just for a second, because that is maybe the biggest news, ironically,

104
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:22,980
which is not even going to be until next year.

105
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:23,980
They said-

106
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:24,980
Until next year.

107
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:25,980
Yeah.

108
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:30,560
It's going to be something that they'll ship their new apps like Home and News and Stocks

109
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,480
apps that's going on Mac OS.

110
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:34,660
That's built with Marzipan or whatever they're calling it.

111
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:36,920
They didn't give it a name.

112
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:41,780
They're going to try that for a year, and then however that goes, then they'll incorporate

113
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:47,120
changes and improvements, and then they'll release it to developers in 2019.

114
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,920
The more I hear about this, though, is this Electron that they're creating?

115
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:52,840
Are they creating a new Electron?

116
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:56,800
But with their own technologies, so it's Electron for the Apple ecosystem?

117
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:03,420
No, it's adding from the very little that's leaked and the very little they showed on

118
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:11,100
stage today, it's adding basically UI kit hooks into app kit.

119
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:16,400
I was actually pretty hopeful for it, because I could see a world where you run an iOS app,

120
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:20,960
and then just theoretically, I was doing a little architecture in my head during the

121
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,160
keynote.

122
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:26,720
Let's say you had an iOS app that gathered a bunch of data or did a bunch of AR tagging.

123
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:32,740
Then you brought it back to your Mac, let's say your iMac Pro, and did a bunch of machine

124
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:34,520
learning on that data.

125
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:38,320
That would be a good place to take advantage of something like Marzipan to share the code

126
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:42,280
between both sides of the application.

127
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:48,080
Now the reality is someone can do that much easier in a number of other technologies,

128
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,080
including C-Sharp.

129
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:56,360
You can just do a Xamarin app and do a – you can just write a desktop app in C-Sharp or

130
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:59,040
pal whatever you want.

131
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:04,360
I don't know.

132
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:06,760
I don't have a lot positive to say about this keynote.

133
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:12,000
I was hoping – when it kept dragging on and they kept showing ridiculous stuff for

134
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,760
the watch, I was thinking, okay, so they're dragging this out.

135
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:17,760
There's going to be something.

136
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:19,960
Is there going to be a Macbook Pro?

137
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:22,600
Is there going to be – is Marzipan maybe actually coming out?

138
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:26,160
I was thinking they really should update the Macbook Pro, even if it's just a quick update

139
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,160
with a new keyboard.

140
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:29,520
It's like a swap out the keyboard.

141
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,520
Although I think it's underwhelming.

142
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,520
I think the whole thing was underwhelming.

143
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:36,640
It was very consumer focused, but there were – I don't know.

144
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:40,700
It's unusual for Apple to talk about something that you're not even going to get your hands

145
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:44,280
on for a year and kind of sneak that little information out there.

146
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:45,600
I thought that was interesting.

147
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,000
So Marzipan may not be shipping, but they're at least talking about it.

148
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
They're just like, you know what?

149
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Everybody's been rumored about it.

150
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,480
Or what about the fact that they just addressed the whole, are you going to integrate MacOS

151
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,480
and iOS head on?

152
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:57,360
There's just a big nope slide up on screen.

153
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:00,960
Well, that's what makes me think that the original plan was they were just going to

154
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:07,340
announce and release Marzipan, and when it wasn't ready, they had to back off of it.

155
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:12,880
Just one other point I want to throw in here, ARKit, adding additional functionality to

156
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:16,440
ARKit is really interesting, but then Apple immediately – Sherlock's one of the more

157
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:21,640
interesting things you could do with ARKit in terms of the measurements.

158
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:26,120
In particular, it almost felt like Apple was really excited to be their own app developer

159
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:29,560
instead of a platform vendor, which was weird to me.

160
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:35,060
A lot of this presentation was – I mean, seriously, walk down this road with me.

161
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:39,440
In an alternate universe, their presentation makes a lot more sense when at the end of

162
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:45,280
the day, you're like, oh, and Marzipan is available now, developer.apple.com, the beta

163
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:47,880
– we're releasing in a week, right?

164
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:51,200
And by the way, you've already seen it in stocks, home, blah, blah, blah, here, all

165
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,200
these apps.

166
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:58,200
Instead, it was like, yeah, we're not done yet, and we don't have anything.

167
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,840
Okay, I just – devil's advocate, right?

168
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,800
I came into this, Chris.

169
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,480
I have my MacBook set up.

170
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,880
I set up a whole tool chain.

171
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:07,480
I was ready to go.

172
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:14,040
My plan was, whatever new API, if it was Marzipan or if it was something else, I was going to

173
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:18,640
pound out an app within the next month and get it out the door as kind of a marketing

174
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:19,640
thing.

175
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:24,040
That gave me nothing, right?

176
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:27,640
There was no app that I could write today that I couldn't have written yesterday.

177
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:32,000
I guess it depends on the lens you're looking at because they did add new features to watch

178
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,680
OS, which you say we're all kind of screwing around, but the stuff they added to watch

179
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:36,840
OS seemed sort of relevant.

180
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:39,520
You get third-party apps that can play background audio now.

181
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:44,600
There's some vague improvements to what complications and access third-party apps get to that, and

182
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:47,420
podcasts on the watch are huge for me.

183
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:50,640
I think that's going to be great for our audience that have Apple Watch.

184
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,320
So there's some stuff in there that I think is decent.

185
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,560
It just depends on where you look.

186
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:58,380
I grant you there is hardly nothing brought to the Mac that's of any interest to developers

187
00:10:58,380 --> 00:10:59,520
at all.

188
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:00,720
I grant you that.

189
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:05,520
But iOS 12, I think maybe you might be underselling some of that, and same with watch OS, but

190
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:07,200
I think you've nailed it with the Mac.

191
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:11,440
Well, the watch OS is they're just removing self-imposed restrictions, right?

192
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:19,720
I mean, the only reason they didn't want background audio before was presumably battery life concerns,

193
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:22,760
or they just didn't have the ability to hook it into the API.

194
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:28,040
I mean, be the HomePod Apple defender.

195
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:30,080
Tell me, what did I miss?

196
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:33,560
No, I think it's a very...

197
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:37,840
Okay, I'll tell you, you want to know my big theory about it, and it's...

198
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:40,120
Yeah, fry me some bacon.

199
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:47,080
I have already mentioned it once, but after watching the recent keynote and other actions

200
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:51,400
recently, I think I'm right, and I have a theory as to how something could possibly

201
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:56,080
be at a company as rich as Apple that the people running it don't know how to use computers.

202
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:59,280
Now stick with me, because I know that sounds like a controversial thing to say, and, oh,

203
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:06,800
Chris is just taking shots, but I think we have a serious problem here, and I think it

204
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:12,200
starts at the top, and I'll explain my logic, because I think it explains why you're disappointed

205
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,960
from a pro user standpoint.

206
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:18,520
They're up on stage, and they're constantly saying, this was designed, in fact, I grabbed

207
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:21,040
one of the quotes, and I don't know if I...

208
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:25,840
Yeah, inspired by pro users, designed for everyone, and then they kept saying, this

209
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:27,400
is something pro users really want.

210
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:33,160
They said that several times on stage, and yet everything seems very, very consumer focused.

211
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:35,520
Very little new stuff was opened up for developers.

212
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:38,140
No major new kits were announced.

213
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:43,160
It was more like a cleaning up, which is good, but I have a theory as to why this is happening.

214
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:46,240
So first let's talk about Linux Academy, because that's why I'm on the road right now.

215
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:51,600
I'm in Cortez, Colorado, and I'm on my way down to see Linux Academy to help them get

216
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,880
their broadcast system on Linux.

217
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:56,560
They brought in some new folks, the new folks knew how to use it on the Mac, and we're gonna

218
00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:00,640
go down and help them get it working on Linux, and go to Texas Linux Fest, and Linux Academy

219
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:01,880
is committed to Linux.

220
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:06,640
They're enthusiasts about Linux, developers, educators, they got together and they said,

221
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:09,200
let's create a platform to teach people more about Linux.

222
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:13,080
It's a full-featured training library with everything you need to learn new skills and

223
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,200
advance your career.

224
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:18,760
They have self-paced, in-depth video courses on every cloud, Linux, and DevOps topic.

225
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:23,800
If it can run Linux or Linux runs on it, you can find a course about it at Linux Academy.

226
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:28,060
They have hands-on scenario-based labs that give you experience on real servers, full-time

227
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:32,880
humans that can help you whenever you get stuck, and if you're busy, no problemo.

228
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:36,360
They have a course scheduler, you can set a time frame, set learning goals, stick to

229
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:37,360
it.

230
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,360
It's pretty great.

231
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:42,080
Now if you go to linuxacademy.com slash coders, it's got an S on the end of it, linuxacademy.com

232
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:46,720
slash coders, you can sign up for a free seven-day trial, and you can support the show.

233
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:50,640
They also have training for particular types of certification, if you wanna go and get

234
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:51,640
your certs.

235
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:55,480
They've got learning paths if you wanna get down to a particular career track, maybe you

236
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:56,480
wanna move tracks.

237
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:00,160
They have a series of courses and content planned by their instructors to get on specific

238
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,160
career tracks.

239
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:06,000
And of course, they've got iOS and Android apps too, linuxacademy.com slash coders.

240
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,760
And a big thank you to Linux Academy for sponsoring the Coder Radio program, linuxacademy.com

241
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:12,200
slash coders.

242
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:17,360
So I think what's happening at Apple, and this is a wild speculation just based on years

243
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:23,520
of observation now, and I think Steve Jobs built that company in a way to be run from

244
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:24,740
the top.

245
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:29,800
And it is architecturally designed in such a way that you've got your chiefs, you've

246
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:35,160
got your Phil Schillers, and you've got your Craig Federighis, and others, and then you've

247
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:38,800
got what used to be Steve at the top is now Tim at the top.

248
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:43,600
But Tim is an old Compaq guy who ran operations before he came to Apple.

249
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:48,720
He was never in the nuts and bolts of Compaq, and he's not a big computer user.

250
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:51,520
I mean, he's even said it himself, he's more of an iPad user.

251
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:55,000
And then you look at Craig Federighi, he seems to be perhaps the most technically competent

252
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:02,380
of all of them, but he's a man, a middle-aged man who has a family, he has a very big career,

253
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:04,960
he has a lot of things going on, lots of people to manage.

254
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:10,320
He's probably not going home on the weekends and trying to build a Hackintosh or trying

255
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:16,720
to try something brand new in machine learning on his Macbook with an eGPU.

256
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:20,020
There's a chance he's tried it, but it's probably not something he's passionate about.

257
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:21,120
And so the people...

258
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:25,440
And Phil Schiller, again, he's a marketing guy, a marketing genius really, but he's not

259
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,440
a technical expert.

260
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:33,160
So you don't have an executive at the top now who is a PC user, a computer user, or

261
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:38,840
even just enthusiastic about technology in a fundamental way, like willing to risk everything

262
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:43,800
and build a company in his garage so they could sell some wood boxes with computer parts

263
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,760
in them with his esoteric buddy.

264
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:50,200
Like you gotta be really into it to do that, and there's nobody at the company at the top

265
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,200
anymore.

266
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:54,840
Of course, you've got tons of developers, thousands of developers and computer experts

267
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:58,400
throughout the company that are incredibly passionate about this stuff, and they're the

268
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:00,520
ones that are writing the good code, right?

269
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:04,400
They're really just super passionate, but they don't run the company.

270
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:09,720
And I think the DNA of Apple from the day Steve Jobs started it is such that it is a

271
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:11,120
top-run company.

272
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:16,040
It has an executive that sits at the top, and now it's a team of executives, and this

273
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:21,880
team of executives decides based on customer stat data, what the customer stat data is,

274
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:26,120
on what the cost for manufacturing is, what the marketing message is, and they sit there

275
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:29,840
and have these conversations and they decide on what's gonna ship.

276
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:33,480
And it is to abstract from the actual people.

277
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:35,200
And so that's why they actually do the work.

278
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:41,480
And so that's why they've had to go assemble a pro team that could do pro work and advise

279
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:46,000
them on the new features that should be in Mac OS, because they don't know.

280
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,480
They don't use them.

281
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:48,800
They don't use Final Cut.

282
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,240
They don't use Logic.

283
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,780
They don't use Xcode.

284
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:54,120
They don't know.

285
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:59,160
And so they need to hire people, which are essentially yes-men, to tell them what to

286
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:00,160
do.

287
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:05,560
And what we've got is just a little bit more of the same now with dark mode.

288
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:11,000
And it's disappointing because it's like the Mac App Store is all well and good, and it

289
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:15,120
looks like a decent update, and there's some new apps like BBEdit that have never been

290
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:19,600
in there that are long-standing pro Mac apps that are coming.

291
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:21,920
But there was no mention about upgrade pricing.

292
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:25,760
There was no mention about any of that kind of stuff that's gonna solve real issues for

293
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:30,840
large-scale applications that cost tens of thousands of dollars to create.

294
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:32,280
Why?

295
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:35,120
Why after all this time has that not been addressed?

296
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,120
Why?

297
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:37,360
They just don't know.

298
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:38,560
They're disconnected.

299
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:42,740
So they're kind of just going around by what all of their crew tell them, and then they

300
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:47,160
make decisions based on factors that probably are different than the factors you and I would

301
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:52,280
make decisions on.

302
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:54,600
I'm thinking if I agree with you or not.

303
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:57,080
I don't think I agree with you, actually.

304
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:58,080
Or maybe...

305
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,440
How could it be any other way?

306
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:00,440
How could it be any other way?

307
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:02,520
I mean, just look what they're producing year after year.

308
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:04,000
Look at the MacBook Pro.

309
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Right.

310
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,880
So there's two categories of complaint I have.

311
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:10,620
One is the hardware is not for me, right?

312
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:14,560
Which I think your theory works there.

313
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:15,560
So I'm not...

314
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:16,560
Let's just table that, right?

315
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:19,200
I will concede that point.

316
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:23,220
They're obviously trying to keep the Mac as a high-end development platform.

317
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:24,760
And they...

318
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:29,000
That little Swift tool they have to do machine learning in Swift is something I'm going to

319
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
check out.

320
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:37,180
Because if that actually works, right, with that nice little easy GUI, that's pretty good.

321
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:41,920
It's weird that it's not following the industry standards.

322
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:48,160
You know, devil's advocate, your Apple, therefore you must use Swift, I guess.

323
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,160
You see what I'm saying?

324
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50,160
The standard's Python, right?

325
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,160
Not an Apple.

326
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:54,160
I'm just...

327
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,160
Right.

328
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:56,160
I get it.

329
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,160
But like Microsoft, you can do it in F sharp.

330
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:59,840
You're fine.

331
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:10,860
What I don't get is almost like an argument mismatch here in terms of I tune into a developer

332
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:19,520
keynote from the richest company in the world, ready, willing, and able to develop some sort

333
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:23,280
of new software on their platform.

334
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,600
I don't get a whole lot new.

335
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:32,080
Now, it may be also the case that because of what you said, because of your theory,

336
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:35,780
the people presenting the information just failed to present it in a light that would

337
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:37,220
have been attractive to me.

338
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:40,200
So I'm certainly going to watch the session videos and look through the private...

339
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:43,040
Yeah, and the State of the Union and all that.

340
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:45,640
It may actually be true that there is something...

341
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:50,220
My expectation was at minimum, there was going to be some amazing new ARKit APIs.

342
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:57,920
And I have an idea of something I want to do if ARKit was just incrementally improved.

343
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:00,000
But that's not what they told me, right?

344
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,000
I mean, you're asking me to make a...

345
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,580
Well, I guess you're not.

346
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:08,240
You're saying it just doesn't exist because they don't care to do it.

347
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,480
Is that basically your point?

348
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:11,960
Well, I think it's a little...

349
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:14,660
So let's stick with ARKit for a second.

350
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:19,280
It's very possible that they're at the developer level, there's new stuff they've put in there

351
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:25,060
that just goes up in a word cloud for 25 seconds or if that, maybe five seconds in the background.

352
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:29,520
But then if you were to go to the actual sessions at WWDC or go to the State of the Union, you

353
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:33,180
may find out about a new set of APIs because there is a new version of ARKit.

354
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:36,160
So there's likely new functionality for developers to take advantage of.

355
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:41,600
But the people that are presenting the information, not only are they trying to target it for

356
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:45,920
a general audience in the press, but they also genuinely don't understand and know how

357
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:50,600
to distinguish between something that is really applicable to developers versus something

358
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:52,620
that is just a nice new feature.

359
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:54,240
I think they don't know...

360
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:57,520
Probably Craig Federighi is in the unique position to understand that.

361
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:01,900
And I think that's the issue, is you've got one really strong, technically competent player

362
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:03,400
in that executive team.

363
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:04,400
Okay.

364
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:10,640
But I don't even know if I'm arguing against you now, I'm just frankly complaining.

365
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:13,960
If you're serious about machine learning and you want Swift to be a good machine learning

366
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:14,960
language, fine.

367
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:15,960
You know what?

368
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:16,960
I would be okay with that, right?

369
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:17,960
I am not religious.

370
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:24,720
I love my System76 stuff, I love POP, I would totally work on a Mac if it was easier.

371
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:30,640
Then you need to ship CUDAs, you need to ship NVIDIA CUDA graphics cards, right?

372
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:35,680
The fact that a company with 30 people or however big they are now just released a laptop

373
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:41,240
that will do a better job than a MacBook Pro that cost a thousand dollars more at a task

374
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:45,400
that Apple just highlighted in their keynote is ridiculous to me.

375
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:50,200
The company I'm talking about is System76, but it is a fact, Chris, that if you are doing

376
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:54,680
machine learning and you are, for whatever odd reason, trying to train your models on

377
00:21:54,680 --> 00:22:01,200
your own laptop, you definitely want at least a CUDA card, right?

378
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:08,480
The guy said that unless what Apple thinks is that you are not going to do any high-end

379
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:09,480
machine learning.

380
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:12,440
What you are going to do is you are going to add a little bit of machine learning to

381
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:16,800
an app and then I'm going to – then you are in this weird argument of what is like

382
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:22,440
scripting and just like statistical analysis and what is machine learning because that

383
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:23,440
seems weird.

384
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:24,440
I agree with you.

385
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:29,120
It sounds like Craig Federighi was deadly serious on stage about that, right?

386
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:32,320
He very much seems to know what he is talking about.

387
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:33,360
I just don't understand.

388
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:39,840
Why would you not put your best foot forward and say, this is ARKit 2 and here is the ten

389
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:45,720
new things you can do with it and this is CoreML 2 and what is it, MachineKit was the

390
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:48,960
other one?

391
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,280
I don't think I grabbed it.

392
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:51,600
Oh, Metal for Machine Learning.

393
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:52,600
Okay.

394
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:53,600
Metal for Machine Learning.

395
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:54,600
Okay.

396
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:55,600
And this is why you want to do that.

397
00:22:55,600 --> 00:23:02,760
Instead, we had to have this very long explanation about exercise during a developer keynote.

398
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:04,480
Have you met developers?

399
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:05,480
I know.

400
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:08,360
That was – the whole on the bike thing was – that was weird.

401
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:12,680
And Animoji is just wrong and I don't mean wrong as in for developer conference which

402
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:13,680
it is.

403
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:14,680
I mean morally wrong.

404
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:15,680
My kids love it.

405
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:16,680
It creeps me out.

406
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:17,680
My kids just love it.

407
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:19,200
They love it.

408
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:23,800
It reminds me of those old like late 80s horror movies when everybody was worried about Satanists

409
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:27,960
and stuff where like the kid wears a go-tet or something.

410
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:28,960
Terrifying to me.

411
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,840
I am horrified by Animoji.

412
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:34,760
This may be more of a Mike issue than an Apple issue but I don't know.

413
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:38,640
I mean to me, I don't even know if I agree with you or I don't agree with you because

414
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:43,080
I feel like we're across purposes but I feel like they're just not taking their

415
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:46,320
developer community serious at all.

416
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:49,760
They want – and that video with people's moms talking about – oh, no.

417
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:50,760
I'm sorry.

418
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:57,720
David Attenborough talking about developers like they are animals in a jungle somewhere.

419
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:58,720
Did you see that intro?

420
00:23:58,720 --> 00:23:59,720
Yes.

421
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:00,720
Yes, I did.

422
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:06,240
Replace developer with any other group of people and you're on the front page of

423
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,240
the New York Times.

424
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:08,920
That's unbelievably terrible.

425
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:10,880
That's insulting.

426
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:16,660
Here's what – so I am more optimistic about the software improvements.

427
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:22,000
The integration of workflow into iOS could be the biggest standout feature for iOS 12

428
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:27,680
for power users and I'm glad that they finally revamped the Mac App Store.

429
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:31,480
But the things that jumped out at me was no new MacBook Pro at all, even if it was just

430
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:35,640
going to be now you can do 32 gigs of RAM and a new keyboard for God sakes.

431
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:39,120
No iPad software OS level improvements.

432
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:43,560
Just a few new apps that are coming to iPad from the iPhone so they're not even really

433
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:45,440
new apps.

434
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:47,280
So it's sort of hit and miss for me.

435
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:52,680
I think the hardware area is the weakest story for Apple in terms of no Mac updates at all,

436
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:53,680
no Mac Mini update either.

437
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:56,120
Again, I think if you were looking for what developers need –

438
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:57,120
Mac Mini.

439
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:59,920
I mean if you're looking for a Mac Mini.

440
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:04,000
Actually if you – so imagine if they had the Mac Mini and it was just basically a rebranded

441
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Intel NUC.

442
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
A NUC?

443
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
Yeah.

444
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,040
That would be a great little machine to just try something out, especially if you're an

445
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:12,720
iOS developer and you want to experiment with the Mac.

446
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:15,840
Right now your entry point is a laptop or an all-in-one iMac.

447
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:16,840
It's just ridiculous.

448
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:20,880
I know it's just – yeah, anyways, I just – that's what – those would have been

449
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:24,600
signals to me that they kind of grokked with some of the more wider developer –

450
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:31,560
Yeah, it's like certainly not fixing the damn keyboards and all their computers is

451
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:33,200
super crazy to me.

452
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:36,040
And I got to be honest, I know I'm coming in pretty hard and I can already see the YouTube

453
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:40,840
comments coming, although it's not up on YouTube.

454
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:42,240
I hope you're right, Chris, right?

455
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,440
I hope Chris is right.

456
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:47,080
I hope it's not – like I hope there is some cool stuff and it's just like Tim Cook

457
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:51,460
is just not the right person to run this company and the message – because the messaging

458
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:55,960
comes off as weirdly infantilizing and it's kind of like oh, you guys are so cute, little

459
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:58,800
boy, here's a Matchbox car.

460
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:08,200
And now the grown-ups are going to go work out and you know, I don't know, it – yeah,

461
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,200
it felt bad.

462
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:13,280
I mean, Chris, do you agree or do you think I'm just crazy?

463
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:14,280
It felt off-tone.

464
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:16,880
It felt – I don't know how to put – I've been trying to think of how to put this into

465
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:21,480
words but all but one of the female presenters they brought up on stage felt like they were

466
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:25,160
bringing females up on stage to check boxes.

467
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:29,640
And that – and I think some people in the chatroom felt that way too and it's unfortunate

468
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:32,880
when you see that because that almost feels like the reverse of what they're trying to

469
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:33,880
accomplish.

470
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:36,960
I'm not saying that for all of the presenters but there was definitely some.

471
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:39,240
You know, they've all been very, very heavily coached.

472
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:43,920
The Apple Keynote is almost a parody of itself now and it's such a –

473
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:45,480
It could have been an episode of Silicon Valley, right?

474
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:46,480
Yeah.

475
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:47,480
It could have been the guy from Hooli up there.

476
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:49,560
It's such a ripped off format now too.

477
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:52,280
Like everybody uses that format.

478
00:26:52,280 --> 00:27:00,920
And so it feels really done and I think the pent-up need – what's going on here is the

479
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:02,480
crossroads that we're approaching now.

480
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:08,600
We're dancing around this GitHub story but look at the message from Microsoft, the continuous

481
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:14,240
say last 25-year message about how they feel about developers versus the story we just

482
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:15,240
got from Apple.

483
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:17,900
And you and I both watched Build.

484
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:27,280
You compare and contrast Build to WWDC and it's clear Microsoft deeply, deeply understands

485
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:28,280
developers.

486
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:31,340
It feels like when they're up on stage they are developers themselves that are making

487
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:33,080
things for other developers.

488
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:38,280
When Apple's on stage it feels like the candy company is making a new magical toy and there's

489
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:40,960
a way for you developers to play along too.

490
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:41,960
And that –

491
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:45,320
That can make it so much worse.

492
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:51,280
And so I just – I think it's just it wasn't enough and it didn't solve enough problems

493
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:56,360
to address the crossroads that they're at right now.

494
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:59,600
It's not – see, to me, I mean, I'll get off of it because I think we're just going

495
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:04,600
to come close to a flame war here but it wasn't just that it wasn't enough.

496
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:12,800
The actual tone to me was – I felt like I was in 10th grade and some girl's mom was

497
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:16,920
trying to convince her to go out with me because the nerds, he'll make a lot of money, right?

498
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:23,520
It felt weird like the – especially the first video with the developers in the wild

499
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:28,400
treating them like some sort of weird creature you would find, an animal.

500
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:36,640
And the thing with the moms and the relatives was just unbelievably bad.

501
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:41,960
If you contrast it to Microsoft and to Google, Microsoft and Google treat this like a real

502
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:44,040
profession, a real skill.

503
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:45,360
Apple treats it like some sort of –

504
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:46,360
Lifestyle choice.

505
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:47,360
I don't even know.

506
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:50,160
It's a lifestyle choice.

507
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:54,760
But for like children, like honestly, it felt like they were talking to children.

508
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:57,920
I don't know, we can move on.

509
00:28:57,920 --> 00:29:03,080
It just felt super – the only word I can think of is infantilizing.

510
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:08,080
I mean it really felt like they were trying to say we're the adults, we understand you

511
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:13,960
have these feelings and you want these things but you do have a curfew and you can't drink,

512
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:14,960
right?

513
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,760
Like it just – ah, terrible.

514
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:17,760
Yeah.

515
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:18,760
Yeah.

516
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:23,560
I don't know if I get that strong of a read but I do feel like it was off the mark.

517
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:29,840
And I myself am just pleased to see that they're adding a workout mode for hiking because jeez,

518
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:31,600
I always feel like I was getting ripped off on that.

519
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:32,600
Yeah.

520
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:33,600
All right.

521
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:36,440
Well, why don't we take a break and we'll change gears and we'll talk about GitHub,

522
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:41,000
Microsoft and the big story and all of that that isn't really getting very much discussion,

523
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,120
at least not today on Monday as it's all broke.

524
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:47,200
But first, let's talk about DigitalOcean and how you can get $100 credit when you go

525
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:49,600
to dio.co slash coder.

526
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:51,600
No S on this one.

527
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:53,680
Dio.co slash coder.

528
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:58,120
$100 of DigitalOcean credit for 60 days when you sign up with a new account.

529
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:00,120
And you can do a lot in 60 days.

530
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:03,880
Try something new or maybe improve an existing app, test something you've been wanting to

531
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:04,880
try for a while.

532
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:08,720
They have optimized compute types where you can deploy droplets that have been optimized

533
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:11,040
for specific types of compute workloads.

534
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:14,200
They have customizable drops where you can mix and match the resources.

535
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:18,140
My favorite system though is three cents an hour.

536
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:24,000
Three cents an hour and I get four gigs of RAM, two CPUs, 80 gigabytes of SSD disk space

537
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,160
and three terabytes of transfer for three cents an hour.

538
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:28,280
Everything is SSDs.

539
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:32,200
If you get the $5 a month system or you get one of those systems with hundreds of gigs

540
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:36,040
of RAMs and lots of Xeon CPUs, everything is SSDs.

541
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:37,040
Even the block storage.

542
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:40,840
And then they have easy, simple, straightforward DNS management.

543
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:44,960
Cloud firewalls which block traffic at their network level instead of letting the traffic

544
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:50,440
hit your box, monitoring and alerting so that way you can deliver pro-level services and

545
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:52,440
keep track of how things are trending.

546
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:55,700
Global data centers, data centers all over the world and 40 gigabit connections coming

547
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:56,700
into the hypervisors.

548
00:30:56,700 --> 00:31:01,080
And then they wrap it all up with a great dashboard and a super straightforward API.

549
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:02,080
Try it out.

550
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:07,640
60 days with a $100 credit, do.co slash coder.

551
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:12,840
Now if you're thinking about trying GitLab, they have a one click deployment for GitLab.

552
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:17,960
One click and it's all set up and ready to go and you can get to work, do.co slash coder

553
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:22,200
and a big thank you to DigitalOcean for sponsoring the Coder radio program.

554
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:26,480
Yeah, so it started, you started probably seeing this over the weekend I think based

555
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:30,560
on the telegram and Slack chats that I saw.

556
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:34,120
But for $7.5 billion today-

557
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:36,120
I'm sorry, put your pinkie up.

558
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:37,120
Billion.

559
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:38,120
Billion.

560
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:39,120
Billion.

561
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:44,280
So they officially announced it today that they are going to acquire GitHub and Nat Friedman,

562
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:48,120
the founder of Xamarin is going to be, or Xamarin or however you say it.

563
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:49,720
Still called Xamarin every time.

564
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:54,040
Because it's going to be, I can't stop now, it's going to be the new CEO of GitHub once

565
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:57,560
all this closes in about a year, or at the end of the year they think.

566
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:59,540
So it's huge.

567
00:31:59,540 --> 00:32:04,220
This is huge because it's also, it's also Microsoft buying Electron basically.

568
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:08,200
And that to me seems like the big story that's not getting a lot of discussion right now.

569
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:09,200
Yeah.

570
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:13,120
And Atom, which I think is going to be good night to Saigon for Atom pretty soon.

571
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:14,680
Oh, right now we've got-

572
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:15,680
VS Code.

573
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:16,680
Yeah.

574
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:17,680
We've got some redundancies.

575
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:21,080
And under the hood they're effectively the same.

576
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:22,080
So.

577
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:23,080
Hmm.

578
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:24,760
Yeah, I mean, so let's start with GitHub.

579
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:28,640
A lot of people have been talking like this is the end of the world on Twitter.

580
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:31,040
You know, lots of announcements about being at the end of the world.

581
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:36,800
I think it's a little too early to tell, but I think it is a, it's a good, as they say,

582
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:39,720
leeching moment about centralization.

583
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:42,640
And especially when that comes to open source projects and it's a great opportunity for

584
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:43,640
GitLab.

585
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:47,200
So that, that, those are my thoughts on, on everybody freaking out about switching.

586
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:50,260
But what have you, what, just before we move on, what do you think about the reaction so

587
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:51,260
far?

588
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:52,260
Surprised?

589
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:53,260
Not surprised?

590
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:54,260
Over the top?

591
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:55,260
What do you think?

592
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:58,280
Am I surprised that it happened or am I surprised at the reaction?

593
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:01,720
Well, I was thinking the reaction, but I'm actually curious of the first one too.

594
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:05,240
So start with the reaction and then let's talk about it.

595
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:06,240
Yeah.

596
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:12,320
So I made a mistake of when I first saw the leak, posting it to the Reddit programming

597
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:16,880
subreddit and just watching the comments come in and my little notification panel there.

598
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:18,680
Oh boy.

599
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:19,680
People are not happy.

600
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:20,680
Right?

601
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:22,800
I wrote a quick blog post on dominicm.com.

602
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:28,520
I wrote it when I noticed that the GitLab import tool actually crashed because so many

603
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:32,080
people were trying to pull their repos off of GitHub.

604
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:33,760
Oh man.

605
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:41,000
I myself up until recently was a Bitbucket user, but for basically compliance reasons,

606
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:44,160
I'm using a self-hosted GitLab now.

607
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:50,880
I had evaluated GitHub, but I'm a little old man-ish and I kind of think it's important

608
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:55,040
to control your own infrastructure provided you have good backups.

609
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:56,040
Yeah.

610
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:57,040
Yeah.

611
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:58,040
I wasn't surprised by the reaction either.

612
00:33:58,040 --> 00:33:59,040
So what do you think?

613
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:00,040
Were you surprised about this purchase?

614
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:01,040
No.

615
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:08,000
I think Microsoft is one, the logical purchaser for GitHub and honestly, someone had to buy

616
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,000
GitHub, right?

617
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,600
Like they weren't going to IPO on good terms.

618
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:11,600
I don't know.

619
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:16,040
I mean, the one argument I've heard a lot is one of the features of GitHub, one of the

620
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:18,880
biggest features of GitHub was the fact that it was an independent operator.

621
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:22,040
It could sit between AWS or Azure or DigitalOcean.

622
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:25,760
Like it was just this independent operator that didn't have any skin in that aspect of

623
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:26,840
the game.

624
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:33,720
So I would prefer to have seen it stay solo, right?

625
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:36,880
But the answer to that was they probably needed to generate more revenue and therefore raise

626
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:37,880
prices.

627
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:38,880
Yeah.

628
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:39,880
Okay.

629
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:40,880
I can see that.

630
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:45,000
The other thing is one thing that I'm not seeing enough of is people are like, oh my

631
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,280
God, GitHub, how am I going to use Git?

632
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:53,280
If you are using GitHub as a central repository, you're just like doing Git wrong, right?

633
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:57,400
Your real problem is that GitHub created a bunch of proprietary tools to help you with

634
00:34:57,400 --> 00:35:03,440
deployments and continuous integration and you got totally locked into them.

635
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:11,000
So I don't know, like I moved to GitLab from Bitbucket in a day because I pulled the repo,

636
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,720
added an origin, pushed the new origin, right?

637
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:18,760
It's really easy if you're doing everything by open standards and open tools and not using

638
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:21,760
any proprietary integrations.

639
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:25,540
It's really hard if you're using these one click deployment things.

640
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:29,640
And that's where I think a little bit of the FUD makes sense around like the Microsoft

641
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:33,640
acquisition because I could totally see an Azure button on like every repo, right?

642
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:35,120
Like deploy to Azure now.

643
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:36,120
Oh, 100%.

644
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:37,120
Yeah, absolutely.

645
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:39,120
Those things already exist.

646
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:40,120
Right.

647
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:45,380
And of course, Heroku has one, Microsoft has one, but the only way this really makes sense

648
00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:49,880
is as yet another play to funnel people into Azure in my mind.

649
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:50,880
Yeah.

650
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:51,880
Yeah.

651
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:52,880
Yeah.

652
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:54,720
I mean, yeah, I think so.

653
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:58,640
Seems like this could also be just, hey, we're the developer company now.

654
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:02,600
You want to write software on Linux and deploy it on AWS, as long as you're doing it with

655
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:06,760
Visual Studio Code and pumping it through GitHub, we're good.

656
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:07,760
You know?

657
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:08,760
Like they don't care.

658
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:12,400
I think that might be the, this is, we're the company for developers and you look at

659
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:17,080
the contrast we just saw from Apple and then you look at Microsoft, Microsoft really has

660
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:21,520
been making a lot of moves,.NET Core, Visual Studio Code, and many other things on their

661
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:24,160
GitHub page, which we'll have a link to the show notes.

662
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:27,760
A lot of stuff is open source, including throwing windows on GitHub.

663
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:32,000
They may be the largest code contributor on GitHub.

664
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,440
I think that is actually a...

665
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:34,440
They are.

666
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:35,440
Yeah.

667
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:36,440
That's the truth.

668
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:37,440
Yeah.

669
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:38,440
Yeah.

670
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:42,000
So I wonder if this is even bigger than Azure in a way, like I absolutely fundamentally

671
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:46,720
has a very important, maybe the most important component is the Azure component and the future

672
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:47,720
potential there.

673
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:48,720
Yeah.

674
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:49,720
But I wonder if it isn't bigger than Azure.

675
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:50,720
Because look at Electron.

676
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:53,040
I think GitHub is, yeah.

677
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:54,040
Consider Electron too, right?

678
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:55,040
Electron.

679
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:56,040
Yeah.

680
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:57,040
And so it's a bigger purchase.

681
00:36:57,040 --> 00:37:00,480
They have Electron now, they have GitHub and GitHub can, GitHub is like this middleware

682
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:03,240
between so many different endpoints.

683
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:05,320
It's so many things are tied into GitHub.

684
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:10,680
So many things are tied, like my Linux box sitting next to me right here is, it pulls

685
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:11,920
down updates from GitHub.

686
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:14,840
It's like, there's so many things that are tied into GitHub.

687
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:15,840
Oh, sure.

688
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:17,320
GitHub now has all of that.

689
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:20,320
Plus they have now easy tie-ins to Azure and they've got Electron.

690
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:23,040
So I think it's bigger than just one thing.

691
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:28,680
But okay, so the bigger message you think is that Microsoft is basically the anti-Apple

692
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:29,680
now.

693
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:33,120
They're saying, you know, we are the developer company, we're engineers, we understand you.

694
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:35,480
We're not doing weird documentaries on you.

695
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:36,480
Sorry.

696
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:37,480
Can I help it?

697
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:38,480
Yeah.

698
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:41,600
And also, I think it also means that a lot of Microsoft's products are going to probably

699
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:42,880
shift over to Electron.

700
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:46,240
Skype was just the beginning.

701
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:47,960
Yeah, I think that would have happened anyway, though.

702
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:48,960
Yeah, exactly.

703
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:51,320
Yeah, that's why they probably made the purchase.

704
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:54,880
This actually ties into both WWDC and the GitHub Microsoft purchase.

705
00:37:54,880 --> 00:38:00,560
And I'm going to make a bold prediction here and I can't wait to see Telegram later tonight.

706
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:05,000
I think Microsoft is actually ahead of the game in a lot of ways.

707
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:08,000
They understand that the future is open standards.

708
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:15,840
I would argue the present is open standards, too, and progressive web apps, Electron, just

709
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:21,080
frankly not being crazy and proprietary about stuff where Apple's like, we're going to re-implement

710
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:26,520
machine learning in Swift because that makes sense.

711
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:27,520
It's weird.

712
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:28,520
I don't know.

713
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:30,440
I feel like there's something here, Chris, that both of these things happen on the same

714
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:34,400
day and the dichotomy between them is huge.

715
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:38,520
It's like night and day, help Mojave and Snow Leopard O.

716
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:39,960
Oh, yeah, I agree.

717
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:41,040
I think it is.

718
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:45,080
It's a massive A-B contrast between the two.

719
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:50,200
We couldn't be getting a bigger disparity because I really think Microsoft has shifted

720
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:57,680
towards this development platform focus and Apple is shifting towards this enrich our

721
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:58,680
ecosystem focus.

722
00:38:58,680 --> 00:38:59,680
They've shifted.

723
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:00,680
They've been there for a while.

724
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:03,960
This enrich our ecosystem focus, make things better for the iPhone.

725
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:08,240
If you're on an iPhone, now you can scan using your iPhone camera and it goes directly into

726
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:10,520
the doc you're working on on the Mac.

727
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:15,200
That's where they're focusing, which is great for that ecosystem, but everyone's-

728
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:17,200
Or that type of user.

729
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:22,080
Right, but the thing is, if this continues, if these trend lines continue, everyone's

730
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:26,640
going to be writing software for those iPhones and especially the backend software for all

731
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:27,640
those Macs.

732
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:30,960
They're going to be writing it on Microsoft's tools.

733
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:35,800
They're going to be hosting the code on Microsoft's tools and the services are going to be running

734
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:38,320
on Microsoft servers.

735
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:44,200
Microsoft's going to own all of the stuff that's getting sold on those devices.

736
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:50,200
If Apple had played their cards better, they could have owned the entire stack better.

737
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:54,200
I agree with you 100%, but let's run it out five years.

738
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:58,960
In five years, it's not going to be writing your native iOS app using Xamarin.

739
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:03,760
It's going to be everything is a web standard, thank you, WebAssembly.

740
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:07,880
Check off your bingo card for Coderadio.

741
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:12,000
Microsoft is providing the best tooling, the easiest deployments from GitHub to Azure or

742
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,840
frankly from GitHub to wherever the hell you want.

743
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:17,240
I really hope they don't go too crazy with the Azure thing.

744
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:22,160
Apple is still trying to convince you to redo your whole workflow in Swift.

745
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:26,080
Apple had nothing future-leaning today other than the marzipan, which really, you know

746
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:27,800
what marzipan is?

747
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:33,760
It's rejiggering your iPad apps and your iOS apps to go work on the Mac, where Microsoft

748
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:40,040
is saying we are going to make best practices for frankly large-scale engineering projects

749
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:43,600
such as continuous integration, continuous deployment.

750
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:48,720
We're going to make those practices more attainable for even junior developers.

751
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:53,080
I'm talking kids right out of trade school or junior college rather.

752
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:54,080
You know what?

753
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:55,240
I take it back.

754
00:40:55,240 --> 00:41:00,960
I welcome the click to deploy to Azure button on everything, if only to explain to junior

755
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:05,280
developers that you really have to automate your deployment, right?

756
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:10,040
Or maybe like some sort of Docker generation tool, like Docker file generation tool, which

757
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:15,440
by the way, Microsoft is a huge supporter of Docker and containerization in general.

758
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:20,440
Where Apple's, I don't know, trying to get me to run.

759
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:21,440
It's not even on the map.

760
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:22,440
Yeah, it's not even on the map.

761
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:23,440
Right.

762
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:25,960
I don't know how to do some crunches, I don't know.

763
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:26,960
But what about the FUD?

764
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:29,720
I mean, you are the host of the Linux action show, Chris.

765
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:30,720
Are you feeling-

766
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:31,720
Wow.

767
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:32,720
Retired.

768
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:33,960
It's the retired host of the Linux action show.

769
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:34,960
Wow.

770
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:36,040
You know what?

771
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:37,480
I just listened to the old episodes.

772
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:41,160
You're always my host, baby.

773
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:42,680
What particularly do you ask of me?

774
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:43,680
What do you want to know of me?

775
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:46,400
So, I mean, I'm sure you've seen some of the comments in Reddit, right?

776
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:51,200
Some of the, you know, M dollar sign, blah, blah, blah, yeah, yeah.

777
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:54,800
Does that have any weight to you, or is that kind of just, yeah?

778
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:55,800
Oh, yeah.

779
00:41:55,800 --> 00:42:00,960
So, I asked some folks on Twitter that follow me, and it seems like everybody's pretty middle

780
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:02,320
of the ground.

781
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:05,840
It seems like, you know, people should have cared when Microsoft joined the Linux Foundation,

782
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:07,440
has come up a few times.

783
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:10,960
A lot of people feel like eventually it's going to not work out.

784
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:15,640
It's almost just guaranteed to eventually kind of devolve into something people don't

785
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:17,120
like from when it was independent.

786
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:19,920
So, a lot of people are just sort of hedging their bets.

787
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:25,120
But another, a fair amount of folks are pretty much sit back and wait and see.

788
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:26,600
See what happens.

789
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:28,560
Maybe things will work out okay.

790
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:32,600
I think that's sort of my position as well, is there's so much FUD going around right

791
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:33,600
now that you got to give time.

792
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:34,600
You got to calm down.

793
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:38,480
I mean, this deal isn't even going to be done for another six months or something.

794
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:42,600
So, we've got a lot of time before anything really changes.

795
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:48,620
And then once the deal does go through, I think it's at least worth sitting back and

796
00:42:48,620 --> 00:42:50,600
seeing where this all goes.

797
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:54,840
And the fact that Nat Friedman is going to be running it is encouraging because he's

798
00:42:54,840 --> 00:43:00,960
been in open source and working with Linux for a very long time.

799
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:04,720
I forget how I'm supposed to mispronounce his company, Zemarion.

800
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:12,360
When Microsoft acquired Zemarion, he became a Microsoft employee along with Miguel Itacaza.

801
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:17,720
And I got to say, like, if you're going to put somebody in charge of GitHub, it has needed

802
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:21,280
a new leadership for a long time.

803
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:23,440
That's kind of why they're in this position to begin with.

804
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:26,140
And he's been toying around with Linux since the 90s.

805
00:43:26,140 --> 00:43:29,080
So it's like, who else are you going to put in charge that's not in a better position

806
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:31,360
at Microsoft to run this thing?

807
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:35,360
So I say it's at least we deserve, they deserve at least a wait and see approach.

808
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:36,360
That's my take on it.

809
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:40,240
It's not like you can't move to GitLab in 10 months.

810
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:43,720
Or, you know, a day or less.

811
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:48,480
He stresses in his blog post that we'll have linked in the show notes, coder.show slash

812
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:49,480
312.

813
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:53,400
He says GitHub will operate independently as a community platform and business.

814
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:58,320
They're going to retain its developer first values, distinct spirit, and open extensibility.

815
00:43:58,320 --> 00:44:02,840
So it seems like maybe it's going to be more like a Zappos run business than it's going

816
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:05,760
to be a Skype run business for Microsoft.

817
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:07,520
It's going to be like LinkedIn, right?

818
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:11,760
When they bought LinkedIn, LinkedIn's basically still LinkedIn.

819
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:15,280
Which I mean, in that case, maybe not a good thing.

820
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:18,800
So what's everybody freaking out about exactly?

821
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:23,320
You know, I'm seeing a lot of stuff about like, well, all these, and it is true, right?

822
00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:27,920
A lot of projects are moving off of GitHub.

823
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:36,560
It seems like there's just a lot of bad feelings in the community from like the 90s almost.

824
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:41,000
Like one argument that does make sense to me, although I am the one who originally made

825
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:48,560
it on Twitter was, you know, if I had proprietary software and I was in some way, even tangentially

826
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:52,840
competing with Microsoft, it might give me pause now that they have access to all of

827
00:44:52,840 --> 00:44:53,840
my repos, right?

828
00:44:53,840 --> 00:44:59,600
Like that, that might be a reason to be afraid, but those aren't the people who seem to be

829
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:00,600
screaming.

830
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:07,120
It seems to be the FOSS community, which Microsoft is already very much in bed with you.

831
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:12,240
Well, I don't think people acknowledge that as much as it's because it's more happening

832
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:15,880
at the business level and people don't see like all the behind the scenes code contributions

833
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:16,880
and stuff like that.

834
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:21,280
It's not apparent, you know, a gnome release is something that's in the user's face.

835
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:25,400
Microsoft contributing 200,000 lines of code to the kernel is not in the user face.

836
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:26,400
So I think that's part of it.

837
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:27,880
And I think, yeah, it's history.

838
00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:31,140
You know, somebody on Twitter, again, I go back to, cause I've just been watching reactions

839
00:45:31,140 --> 00:45:33,000
to this cause it's just been something.

840
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:37,760
Somebody on Twitter said that people just sometimes want to hate and they need something

841
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:39,440
to hate.

842
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:44,280
And it's a personality trait and we tell ourselves, oh, it's because they're Microsoft, it's because

843
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:47,360
of technical reasons, it's because of things that they've done.

844
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:51,240
But sometimes we just, that's just how we're wired up.

845
00:45:51,240 --> 00:45:52,240
That could be a part of it.

846
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:55,120
You know, people have picked their tribe and now they're fighting it and they're going

847
00:45:55,120 --> 00:45:56,120
to stay.

848
00:45:56,120 --> 00:45:58,560
That's part of their identity is that.

849
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:02,820
I also have to leave a little space in here to acknowledge this could go wrong.

850
00:46:02,820 --> 00:46:05,500
So not all of them may be wrong.

851
00:46:05,500 --> 00:46:10,360
Microsoft could screw this up and it could really screw over a bunch of open source projects

852
00:46:10,360 --> 00:46:11,960
somehow.

853
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:15,840
Right now it doesn't seem likely, but it could happen.

854
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:20,640
So right now, how is somehow, so what exactly could they do?

855
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:26,400
Well, you know, I couldn't tell you, but I will say this, um, and this has been a common

856
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:30,980
argument is I am really disappointed in Skype since Microsoft has bought it.

857
00:46:30,980 --> 00:46:33,560
They destroyed its P2P inherent nature.

858
00:46:33,560 --> 00:46:38,600
They've essentially tried to chase every particular type of tech trend since they bought it, including

859
00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:40,760
right now, make it a Slack killer.

860
00:46:40,760 --> 00:46:44,480
They've awkwardly integrated it in with other products.

861
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:48,440
It's gotten, it's gotten more love and I can see they've got a longterm vision with it,

862
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:55,560
but I really am just, I miss old Skype, old P2P, simple app, clean little tiny app that

863
00:46:55,560 --> 00:46:57,720
just made calls Skype.

864
00:46:57,720 --> 00:47:03,400
I don't want a Slack killer big electron app that uses web RTC, which in my opinion doesn't

865
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:06,760
sound as good as the old Skype and is now all server based.

866
00:47:06,760 --> 00:47:12,560
So it's, it's also not as great for all those edge cases where P2P is, is a better solution.

867
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:15,960
I'm really unhappy with the way Skype's gone since Microsoft acquired them.

868
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:19,840
LinkedIn, I feel like has gotten pushier and a little more aggressive since Microsoft's

869
00:47:19,840 --> 00:47:20,840
acquired them.

870
00:47:20,840 --> 00:47:23,860
It's like they've gotten more runway to be dicks and I don't like that either.

871
00:47:23,860 --> 00:47:30,280
So I'm not a hundred percent solid on Microsoft's longterm strategy here, but I'm willing to

872
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:31,720
give them the benefit of the doubt.

873
00:47:31,720 --> 00:47:33,440
And it seems to be their particular strength.

874
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:36,160
They have a huge reputation for putting developers first.

875
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:38,960
I mean, Steve Ballmer has made that famous.

876
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:44,680
They have been making obvious inroads into the open source community for years now.

877
00:47:44,680 --> 00:47:48,620
And I, it does seem like a natural fit and they have a good person to lead it.

878
00:47:48,620 --> 00:47:52,400
So I'm not saying it's going to be a failure, but I think, I think we do a disservice a

879
00:47:52,400 --> 00:48:01,200
little bit intellectually if we say it's not possible, what do you think of that?

880
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:08,080
I guess, I mean, I would say the better argument is more, once again, one of the five big tech

881
00:48:08,080 --> 00:48:12,560
companies is eating what could have theoretically been a contender.

882
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:18,920
Now GitHub had weird harassment issues that kind of screwed them up.

883
00:48:18,920 --> 00:48:23,640
But you can definitely think of an alternate universe where GitHub actually became a top

884
00:48:23,640 --> 00:48:24,880
tier company.

885
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:25,880
Right?

886
00:48:25,880 --> 00:48:26,960
Like I could see a mud.

887
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:34,860
Now it's weird though, cause what would GitHub have had to do to become equal to the Microsofts

888
00:48:34,860 --> 00:48:36,520
and Facebooks and Amazons of the world?

889
00:48:36,520 --> 00:48:37,520
I don't think it's possible.

890
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:39,240
Would they still have been GitHub?

891
00:48:39,240 --> 00:48:40,460
No.

892
00:48:40,460 --> 00:48:43,480
Just because of the resources they're giving away to the open source community?

893
00:48:43,480 --> 00:48:44,480
No, no.

894
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:50,600
Because these corporations have 20 years of customer base, plus they have huge, massive

895
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:56,160
lucrative contracts with governments all over the world, and they've got major brand recognition

896
00:48:56,160 --> 00:49:00,160
amongst average consumers, so they're able to introduce products that get big traction

897
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:01,160
much easier.

898
00:49:01,160 --> 00:49:03,640
GitHub doesn't have, doesn't have those things going for itself.

899
00:49:03,640 --> 00:49:10,080
I think it was probably destined to get purchased, if you think, if you think in those terms.

900
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:13,080
Doesn't you know, but it doesn't have to be a top five, it could have been a top hundred.

901
00:49:13,080 --> 00:49:17,360
I mean, if it has to be purchased, I can't think of a better purchaser.

902
00:49:17,360 --> 00:49:18,360
Yeah.

903
00:49:18,360 --> 00:49:20,080
Yeah, I think so.

904
00:49:20,080 --> 00:49:21,080
Right?

905
00:49:21,080 --> 00:49:26,400
Like the, the thing about the alternate universe where Google purchased GitHub, that would

906
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:28,640
be some serious cause for alarm.

907
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:32,400
I bet you wouldn't be getting the same reaction though.

908
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:33,880
It might spook you and I more.

909
00:49:33,880 --> 00:49:36,040
Oh, it would be, really?

910
00:49:36,040 --> 00:49:38,860
You think, you think people would be more okay with it?

911
00:49:38,860 --> 00:49:39,860
I do, yeah.

912
00:49:39,860 --> 00:49:41,560
I see that would scare the shit out of me.

913
00:49:41,560 --> 00:49:42,560
Like that.

914
00:49:42,560 --> 00:49:43,560
Me too.

915
00:49:43,560 --> 00:49:46,600
But I think, I think the people that are reacting strongly about Microsoft purchasing GitHub

916
00:49:46,600 --> 00:49:49,440
are the people that would probably, not all of them, but a lot of them would probably

917
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:52,160
react better about Google.

918
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:53,160
I wouldn't.

919
00:49:53,160 --> 00:49:54,160
Why?

920
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:58,640
Uh, because Google is an open source company and uses Linux.

921
00:49:58,640 --> 00:49:59,640
That's the brand, right?

922
00:49:59,640 --> 00:50:02,360
That's the, that's the, that's the community.

923
00:50:02,360 --> 00:50:06,260
Every time I get, I get, I, every time I criticize Google on the show, people get upset at me

924
00:50:06,260 --> 00:50:09,520
because I'm criticizing a company that uses open source.

925
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:10,520
Okay.

926
00:50:10,520 --> 00:50:13,840
So every time I've ever been to a Google campus, it's a fricking sea of Mac books.

927
00:50:13,840 --> 00:50:16,280
I just want to throw that out there.

928
00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:21,240
I understand they use Linux on the server and this is not me trying to be a jerk, but

929
00:50:21,240 --> 00:50:25,800
you know, uh, uh, laughing, the chat room points out, it says now that Microsoft owns

930
00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:30,720
LinkedIn and GitHub, do they even need to bother interviewing new hires anymore?

931
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:32,920
Well, that's actually, you know what?

932
00:50:32,920 --> 00:50:33,920
That's a fair point.

933
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:35,760
Can you imagine you get something in your GitHub email?

934
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:38,440
It's like, Hey, uh, want to come to Redmond?

935
00:50:38,440 --> 00:50:39,440
Yeah.

936
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:40,440
Right.

937
00:50:40,440 --> 00:50:42,440
They're going to have really interesting, they're going to have so many interesting

938
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:43,600
insights now.

939
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:46,480
That's the creepy part that we may learn more about as time goes on.

940
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:47,480
We may not.

941
00:50:47,480 --> 00:50:48,720
I mean, this just broke today.

942
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:50,280
So we're still processing it.

943
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:52,200
It seems like there's still a lot to figure out and learn.

944
00:50:52,200 --> 00:50:53,200
I'm sure they'll share.

945
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:54,200
Yeah.

946
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:58,120
And the reality is, I think for the first year, they're going to be very hands off,

947
00:50:58,120 --> 00:50:59,120
right?

948
00:50:59,120 --> 00:51:04,360
Nate, Nate, we'll go over and go ahead and take over, but then it's, I would be surprised

949
00:51:04,360 --> 00:51:09,800
if we see aggressive moves because they, you know, it is true that people are, a lot of

950
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:12,080
folks have left to get lab.

951
00:51:12,080 --> 00:51:18,520
Like I'm sure it is a very, very vocal minority, but I wouldn't be surprised if they just do

952
00:51:18,520 --> 00:51:23,720
nothing for a year just to calm the community down and say, nothing's changed.

953
00:51:23,720 --> 00:51:25,600
Your paychecks just say Microsoft now, right?

954
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:26,600
Yeah.

955
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:29,280
And they can afford to be a patient, slow moving company when it comes to this kind

956
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:30,280
of stuff.

957
00:51:30,280 --> 00:51:31,280
Well, and get help makes money, right?

958
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:32,280
Get help does have revenue.

959
00:51:32,280 --> 00:51:36,880
So it's not like they bought some little app startup that the app like never even launched.

960
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:37,960
Right.

961
00:51:37,960 --> 00:51:40,320
And now their services costs probably just got removed.

962
00:51:40,320 --> 00:51:44,040
So now it's going to be much more of a moneymaker.

963
00:51:44,040 --> 00:51:45,520
Migrate that baby to Azure.

964
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:46,520
Yep.

965
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:50,240
All right, Mr. Dominic, is there anything else we want to touch on this week?

966
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:54,100
I know I'm going to go ahead and throw this Mac out the window and we'll be back on Pop

967
00:51:54,100 --> 00:51:55,100
by the morning.

968
00:51:55,100 --> 00:51:56,100
Wow.

969
00:51:56,100 --> 00:51:57,100
All right.

970
00:51:57,100 --> 00:51:58,100
Well, hey, there's a sale on Pixelbooks.

971
00:51:58,100 --> 00:52:02,960
Tell the good folks where they can find you in the meantime, like somewhere else online.

972
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:04,120
Follow at Dumanuco on Twitter.

973
00:52:04,120 --> 00:52:06,560
I'm sure it's going to be entertaining.

974
00:52:06,560 --> 00:52:08,520
And follow me at Chris LAS.

975
00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:10,080
And the show may float.

976
00:52:10,080 --> 00:52:13,360
Recording days and stuff are changing as I'm on the road and Mike's going to be traveling.

977
00:52:13,360 --> 00:52:17,440
So grab every single new episode at coder.show slash subscribe.

978
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:19,720

979
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:34,720
We'll see you right back here next week.
