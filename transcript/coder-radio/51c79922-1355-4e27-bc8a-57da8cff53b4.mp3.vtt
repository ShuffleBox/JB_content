00:00.000 --> 00:16.080
This is KOTORadio, episode 489 for October 24th, 2022.

00:16.080 --> 00:19.440
Well hey good buddy, welcome back to Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show, taking

00:19.440 --> 00:25.240
a pragmatic look at the art and the business of software development and the world of technology.

00:25.240 --> 00:30.320
My name is Chris, and freshly celebrated, it's our host, Mr. Dominic.

00:30.320 --> 00:31.320
Hello Mike!

00:31.320 --> 00:32.320
Hello, hello, hello.

00:32.320 --> 00:35.160
You still got that party glow?

00:35.160 --> 00:36.160
Feeling good?

00:36.160 --> 00:40.760
I'm feeling good, yeah, I've already been coding of course, because you can't stop.

00:40.760 --> 00:44.880
So for those that weren't listening carefully last week, Mike snuck off and got married

00:44.880 --> 00:45.880
this weekend.

00:45.880 --> 00:46.880
I did.

00:46.880 --> 00:47.880
Congratulations!

00:47.880 --> 00:48.880
Thank you, thank you.

00:48.880 --> 00:49.880
That's pretty exciting.

00:49.880 --> 00:51.400
Yeah, good stuff.

00:51.400 --> 00:57.520
You know, I mean, I said to myself after my first divorce, I'm never doing this again,

00:57.520 --> 00:58.520
you know?

00:58.520 --> 00:59.520
Amen.

00:59.520 --> 01:00.520
Never doing this again.

01:00.520 --> 01:04.840
I'm a bachelor for the rest of my life, and then you know, you find the right lady and

01:04.840 --> 01:05.840
you change your mind.

01:05.840 --> 01:06.840
And then you do it again.

01:06.840 --> 01:07.840
Yeah.

01:07.840 --> 01:08.840
Yeah.

01:08.840 --> 01:10.960
So in a few more years we'll be here, we'll be doing it all over again, but we'll do it

01:10.960 --> 01:11.960
together.

01:11.960 --> 01:14.960
No, I'm super happy for you guys.

01:14.960 --> 01:17.680
Hopefully not, but yes, it's certainly possible.

01:17.680 --> 01:20.720
I hope you gifted her like a KOTOR robe.

01:20.720 --> 01:22.400
She already had a KOTOR robe, okay?

01:22.400 --> 01:23.400
She was, she was-

01:23.400 --> 01:24.400
Of course, right.

01:24.400 --> 01:25.400
Well-prepared, yeah.

01:25.400 --> 01:27.120
That's how you knew she was the right lady.

01:27.120 --> 01:31.360
Your wardrobe choices, particularly your robe choices, are super important.

01:31.360 --> 01:33.700
Oh yeah, they say a lot about a person.

01:33.700 --> 01:38.200
And I did see on the Twitters this morning that there isn't quite a lot of wardrobe conversation,

01:38.200 --> 01:39.200
sir.

01:39.200 --> 01:40.200
I know.

01:40.200 --> 01:43.600
You know, it's interesting that it strikes a note with people, you know, we get both

01:43.600 --> 01:48.560
ends of the spectrum on the uniform stuff and on the wardrobe stuff.

01:48.560 --> 01:53.480
I will tell you that behind the scenes I took a stab at putting together like a mock uniform

01:53.480 --> 01:55.280
online and I just hated it.

01:55.280 --> 01:56.280
I hated it.

01:56.280 --> 01:59.080
I'll talk about that more in the future though.

01:59.080 --> 02:02.160
I thought maybe we'd talk about something that really has our chat room fired up this

02:02.160 --> 02:03.260
morning.

02:03.260 --> 02:04.840
They were talking about it on the entire pre-show.

02:04.840 --> 02:08.840
It's a story from a few years ago, but it's been getting shared around this week quite

02:08.840 --> 02:11.320
a bit and it kind of hits our wheelhouse.

02:11.320 --> 02:13.380
But before we get there, why don't we back up a little bit?

02:13.380 --> 02:17.560
Some follow up on our discussion about software developers calling themselves engineers and

02:17.560 --> 02:20.740
how up in Canada they were getting fined for that.

02:20.740 --> 02:26.480
And in Quebec they even sued Microsoft for their Microsoft certified engineers program

02:26.480 --> 02:28.800
and made Microsoft change the name.

02:28.800 --> 02:29.800
Well Hank tweeted at us.

02:29.800 --> 02:34.240
He says, the software engineer title, here's some background, engineers in the US can actually

02:34.240 --> 02:39.080
take the exam and provide some other bona fides that entitle them to that title and

02:39.080 --> 02:44.320
license of a professional engineer, which is, you know, usually just shortened to engineer

02:44.320 --> 02:46.100
as Hank points out.

02:46.100 --> 02:50.920
The title among other things provides some benefits, such as being an expert witness

02:50.920 --> 02:53.300
in the court of law.

02:53.300 --> 02:58.160
My fishing buddy on the other hand is in pollution control and the engineering title is required

02:58.160 --> 03:01.080
in order to submit permit applications.

03:01.080 --> 03:04.680
Calling someone a software network audio etc engineer is technically not correct if they're

03:04.680 --> 03:09.480
not certified and the benefits of doing so in those fields would be slim, but it is common

03:09.480 --> 03:12.120
use and language.

03:12.120 --> 03:16.200
We really got a lot of feedback about this engineering title thing, but the thing that

03:16.200 --> 03:23.320
really got people riled up is a few years ago in the state of Oregon, a man wrote in

03:23.320 --> 03:31.240
about a bad algorithm essentially they were using to run the stoplights and do the stoplight

03:31.240 --> 03:32.240
camera.

03:32.240 --> 03:33.240
Yes, I remember this.

03:33.240 --> 03:34.240
Yes.

03:34.240 --> 03:36.480
He got fined for using the term engineer.

03:36.480 --> 03:40.520
So we wrote in, this is like back in 2014 or something like that, but he writes into

03:40.520 --> 03:44.800
the electronic to the whatever in Beaverton, Oregon, I don't know, you know, the I triple

03:44.800 --> 03:45.800
E, I think.

03:45.800 --> 03:46.800
Yeah.

03:46.800 --> 03:47.800
Whoever it was.

03:47.800 --> 03:51.640
And he says, Hey, I've noticed that there's a flaw with the way the math was done here.

03:51.640 --> 03:56.120
Essentially you guys are doing the math as if this was a straightaway for a stoplight,

03:56.120 --> 03:57.480
but it's a turning lane.

03:57.480 --> 03:58.480
So people have to slow down.

03:58.480 --> 04:04.240
He says, quote, they only looked at the vehicle traveling safely directly through an intersection.

04:04.240 --> 04:07.680
However the equation they developed is not used for turning lanes.

04:07.680 --> 04:12.220
When you make a turn, you slow down, but that's not accounted for in their solution.

04:12.220 --> 04:16.040
So people are getting caught in red light cameras for making safe turns.

04:16.040 --> 04:20.600
So he reached out to the engineering board, his local sheriff and 60 minutes, he wrote

04:20.600 --> 04:23.940
them a letter and it was actually, you know, he shared it with vice.

04:23.940 --> 04:25.880
It seems like a totally reasonable letter.

04:25.880 --> 04:28.600
He says, you know, I am concerned it puts the public at risk.

04:28.600 --> 04:32.220
I'd like to present these facts for your review and your comments.

04:32.220 --> 04:36.820
The response he got back was a fine from the Oregon state board of examiners for engineering

04:36.820 --> 04:38.400
and land surveying.

04:38.400 --> 04:43.040
They responded back with, quote, their law prohibits the practice of engineering in Oregon

04:43.040 --> 04:44.040
without registration.

04:44.040 --> 04:49.640
At a minimum, the use of the title electronics engineer and the statement I am an engineer

04:49.640 --> 04:51.400
creates violations.

04:51.400 --> 04:58.120
In January of that year, they fined him $500 for practicing engineering without being registered.

04:58.120 --> 05:02.260
So to be clear, his job title is electronics engineer.

05:02.260 --> 05:05.560
He wrote a letter saying, hey, I think you made a boo-boo with the way you're doing the

05:05.560 --> 05:09.160
calculation so people are getting red light fined.

05:09.160 --> 05:13.360
And their response was a $500 fine and tell him to stop using the title engineer.

05:13.360 --> 05:15.080
And it turns out he was right.

05:15.080 --> 05:19.280
He says, I'm not a practicing engineer, it's just basic mathematics, Newtonian laws of

05:19.280 --> 05:23.240
motion to make calculations that talk about what I found.

05:23.240 --> 05:28.560
The engineering board, however, said he is not free to publish or present his ideas.

05:28.560 --> 05:31.420
He says, when I first got the letter, I felt like I was being violated and shocked that

05:31.420 --> 05:34.620
I could be treated like this in the USA.

05:34.620 --> 05:37.360
And they're trying to restrict him from sharing this information.

05:37.360 --> 05:41.440
I don't know how, because this has been years ago, so I don't know where it really led to.

05:41.440 --> 05:45.120
And the guise of why he can't share it is because, well, you're not a certified engineer,

05:45.120 --> 05:46.120
so this might be wrong.

05:46.120 --> 05:49.760
For public safety, you can't go around talking about this, when in reality, they just wanted

05:49.760 --> 05:51.400
to cover up their screw up, no doubt.

05:51.400 --> 05:54.880
Yeah, we got a bunch of feedback about this.

05:54.880 --> 05:58.840
And the emails I didn't read till this morning also attest to it.

05:58.840 --> 06:02.660
Licensing is often used to keep people out of the field, right?

06:02.660 --> 06:08.360
You can listen to, I think it was Ezra Klein years ago, or Matt Glaze, he has had a great...

06:08.360 --> 06:14.360
They're very, very progressive guys, but they had a great thing about how certain more jerky

06:14.360 --> 06:18.960
organizations will use licensing to actually racially segregate fields.

06:18.960 --> 06:24.120
It's like you can't attain a certain level of license if your name codes as black or

06:24.120 --> 06:26.080
Spanish or whatever.

06:26.080 --> 06:28.800
In this case, I guess, like you're saying, they just wanted this.

06:28.800 --> 06:33.360
I remember the story when it first came out, and it was kind of like a coder success story,

06:33.360 --> 06:34.360
right?

06:34.360 --> 06:35.360
This dude, like...

06:35.360 --> 06:38.920
Because the other part of it, if I recall correctly, wasn't the county or the municipality

06:38.920 --> 06:43.560
making money because the traffic light was overly aggressive?

06:43.560 --> 06:46.640
Yes, that's got to be part of why they don't want him talking about it.

06:46.640 --> 06:47.640
Right.

06:47.640 --> 06:53.140
And by the way, I am not by this organization's definition an engineer, but I was for many

06:53.140 --> 07:00.320
years a member of IEEE, the Institute of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, so I'm not sure

07:00.320 --> 07:01.320
how that works.

07:01.320 --> 07:07.520
They were happy just saying, I feel like I'm reverting to 2014 Mike, if you give this kind

07:07.520 --> 07:11.880
of gatekeeping power, someone's going to use it to be an ass.

07:11.880 --> 07:18.080
And maybe the risk of some idiot doing something in JavaScript and screwing something up is

07:18.080 --> 07:22.160
worth it, where they shouldn't be using JavaScript or something like that, right?

07:22.160 --> 07:31.040
Is worth it to prevent this kind of draconian gatekeeping, in this case, I think, sort of

07:31.040 --> 07:32.040
ass covering, right?

07:32.040 --> 07:33.040
Nonsense.

07:33.040 --> 07:38.720
You see, I think maybe what you're touching on is kind of a fundamental way that conservatives

07:38.720 --> 07:40.320
versus progressives view the world.

07:40.320 --> 07:46.560
I think the liberal progressive take, remember this is Orkin, would be, well, the idea of

07:46.560 --> 07:49.980
this institution and what it's trying to accomplish is sound.

07:49.980 --> 07:54.880
The problem is the execution and the corruption that inevitably sneaks in.

07:54.880 --> 07:59.680
And so we just need a way of renewing these institutions and washing out this corruption.

07:59.680 --> 08:00.680
Yeah, okay.

08:00.680 --> 08:01.680
Sure.

08:01.680 --> 08:02.680
I don't know, right?

08:02.680 --> 08:03.680
It's never...

08:03.680 --> 08:08.660
So what you're saying is, okay, Thomas Jefferson, let's burn it down every couple of generations

08:08.660 --> 08:09.660
and start over.

08:09.660 --> 08:10.660
Forescoring, my friend.

08:10.660 --> 08:11.660
That's what I'm saying.

08:11.660 --> 08:12.660
It'll never happen though, right?

08:12.660 --> 08:13.660
Like it's...

08:13.660 --> 08:17.600
I am sure someone from IEEE is going to write in and say, hey, Dick, you can pay for the

08:17.600 --> 08:21.440
membership but it doesn't make you an engineer.

08:21.440 --> 08:22.440
I don't know.

08:22.440 --> 08:25.080
I guess I completely reversed myself in a week.

08:25.080 --> 08:29.200
I think we should aggressively fight against this because you know why?

08:29.200 --> 08:36.400
I've been on some really scummy bidding processes and I know for a fact that what will happen

08:36.400 --> 08:38.840
is once there is some sort of licensure...

08:38.840 --> 08:41.140
And who's to say there won't be different ones, right?

08:41.140 --> 08:46.280
Like five different, 10 different, 20 where someone will lobby.

08:46.280 --> 08:49.800
I could particularly see government agencies falling for this.

08:49.800 --> 08:59.000
Oh, well, to really hit this standard of quality, you need to be a Martian software certified

08:59.000 --> 09:01.000
engineer.

09:01.000 --> 09:06.340
And only the Martian Engineering Institute can give you that or it just becomes like

09:06.340 --> 09:07.340
a puppy mill, right?

09:07.340 --> 09:08.340
You just have to pay.

09:08.340 --> 09:09.560
Isn't that what the tech industry does now?

09:09.560 --> 09:13.920
The Microsoft certifications, the RHEL certifications, Cisco certifications?

09:13.920 --> 09:16.800
Because people don't care that much about them.

09:16.800 --> 09:18.280
And they're open enough.

09:18.280 --> 09:21.920
No one at RHEL, no one at Red Hat is trying to stop people from getting it.

09:21.920 --> 09:24.440
In fact, they're encouraging it, right?

09:24.440 --> 09:26.160
Microsoft would love for...

09:26.160 --> 09:29.240
And we know this for a fact, they would love for me to come on and tell everyone to take

09:29.240 --> 09:31.720
a Microsoft software engineering class.

09:31.720 --> 09:33.560
You basically should not.

09:33.560 --> 09:37.020
But Sun used to push this, right?

09:37.020 --> 09:41.200
And Oracle tried for a while with the Java...

09:41.200 --> 09:44.200
They had like a whole weird journeyman master, like they had a whole...

09:44.200 --> 09:45.200
The Duke crew.

09:45.200 --> 09:46.200
The Duke crew.

09:46.200 --> 09:47.200
That's what it was.

09:47.200 --> 09:49.120
Yeah, they had a whole thing.

09:49.120 --> 09:50.960
It's basically nonsense.

09:50.960 --> 09:55.720
I mean, I don't know.

09:55.720 --> 10:02.020
I guess if I look at the fact that it takes our country, sorry, Europeans, but it takes

10:02.020 --> 10:07.600
our country, what is it like 40 times the amount to build anything as it does anywhere

10:07.600 --> 10:13.680
else and twice as long, somebody can correct the statistics, but it's huge.

10:13.680 --> 10:18.760
If you're asking me that we should turn software into that by adding more hurdles to jump,

10:18.760 --> 10:20.440
I'm just going to say no.

10:20.440 --> 10:24.040
If that's true, though, how badass must we be if people still want to build here after

10:24.040 --> 10:25.920
all that?

10:25.920 --> 10:26.920
We must be the best.

10:26.920 --> 10:33.720
Well, if you've been to like an airport recently or, I don't know, driven on any road in Florida,

10:33.720 --> 10:38.960
I can tell you that we need to, honestly, we need to get some dudes over from China

10:38.960 --> 10:41.540
to teach us how to build things again.

10:41.540 --> 10:46.440
There is Chinese airports, Chinese train stations, I'm not even going to mention Japan's bullet

10:46.440 --> 10:51.520
trains, hell, European train stations, right, the metro, much better.

10:51.520 --> 10:56.880
Can I tell you what bothers me about this story, about this gentleman who rode in and

10:56.880 --> 10:59.500
then got fined for larping as an engineer?

10:59.500 --> 11:02.600
That the cops obviously narked him out to the engineering floor.

11:02.600 --> 11:06.400
Yeah, actually, like, what is that process, right?

11:06.400 --> 11:07.400
Right.

11:07.400 --> 11:10.680
Yeah, somebody got pissed and was like, all right, let's forward this on.

11:10.680 --> 11:13.560
Yeah, that also crossed my mind.

11:13.560 --> 11:19.080
I think what disturbs me if I really kind of think about my reaction to this story and

11:19.080 --> 11:25.000
I dig down what's underneath that reaction, it's that these institutions that we've kind

11:25.000 --> 11:30.360
of pegged as our guiding signal of what's good, what's accurate, what we can trust,

11:30.360 --> 11:34.640
you know, this guy is an engineer, I can trust him so he can build this thing for me.

11:34.640 --> 11:38.000
They seem petulant and petty and corrupt.

11:38.000 --> 11:43.580
And the fact that a complaint about a totally legit issue with how the red light cameras

11:43.580 --> 11:49.440
are being triggered, ends up getting forwarded to this organization who not only finds him,

11:49.440 --> 11:53.460
but then actively attempts to suppress the information when he tries to share it publicly.

11:53.460 --> 11:57.620
They find him, but they find him with the force of law behind them.

11:57.620 --> 12:02.720
So presumably were he to refuse to pay, the sheriff will just come collect the $500, right?

12:02.720 --> 12:08.000
I guess it makes it feel like the rule makers aren't playing by the rules, and yet we have

12:08.000 --> 12:10.960
to follow the rules.

12:10.960 --> 12:12.700
I disagree a little.

12:12.700 --> 12:15.040
They're making rules that favor their club, right?

12:15.040 --> 12:17.860
They favor their organization.

12:17.860 --> 12:20.080
They made the rule, right?

12:20.080 --> 12:26.080
This engineering organization made the rule and got that local municipality or state to

12:26.080 --> 12:29.920
make their rule the law that you can't even say, I'm an engineer.

12:29.920 --> 12:30.920
What if you wear a t-shirt?

12:30.920 --> 12:31.920
I'm an engineer.

12:31.920 --> 12:32.920
Fine.

12:32.920 --> 12:33.920
Fine.

12:33.920 --> 12:34.920
You're going to get a fine.

12:34.920 --> 12:35.920
Fine.

12:35.920 --> 12:36.920
There's $500.

12:36.920 --> 12:37.920
I guess it just, it's chilling.

12:37.920 --> 12:39.000
It's chilling as a small business owner.

12:39.000 --> 12:40.000
That's what it is.

12:40.000 --> 12:42.700
Honestly, when I get down to it, when I get, it's to me and when I think about trying to

12:42.700 --> 12:46.200
run a business and I try to think about the next few years and the challenges that are

12:46.200 --> 12:47.200
coming.

12:47.200 --> 12:48.200
Oh man.

12:48.200 --> 12:52.080
And I think the goalies and the rule keepers aren't even, aren't even really following

12:52.080 --> 12:53.080
the rules.

12:53.080 --> 12:54.660
It's just so frustrating.

12:54.660 --> 12:57.840
But let's move on to actually making that money.

12:57.840 --> 13:03.080
So if you ever get into independent software development or IT contracting like I did or

13:03.080 --> 13:09.760
advertising sales, you often have to enter the realm of estimations.

13:09.760 --> 13:15.400
And you know how much our dear Mr. Dominic loves doing estimates on projects.

13:15.400 --> 13:21.040
In fact, if it wasn't for his outlandish estimate, when I first started talking to him, we probably

13:21.040 --> 13:29.360
wouldn't be doing this podcast today because the estimate was too damn high.

13:29.360 --> 13:35.320
So you found this great medium piece, Seven Estimation Anti-Patterns.

13:35.320 --> 13:37.560
And I have a feeling there's some inspiration in here.

13:37.560 --> 13:39.040
Where do you want to start?

13:39.040 --> 13:40.400
So there's some good stuff, right?

13:40.400 --> 13:46.240
We covered this a couple of years ago, not this piece, but one of the many predecessors

13:46.240 --> 13:47.760
to it.

13:47.760 --> 13:52.440
And basic premise, I'm sure everybody listens to this, probably knows.

13:52.440 --> 13:55.440
Estimates are hard.

13:55.440 --> 13:56.440
And yeah, that's it.

13:56.440 --> 13:57.440
All right.

13:57.440 --> 13:58.440
Yeah.

13:58.440 --> 13:59.440
There we go, everybody.

13:59.440 --> 14:06.960
So this guy who is a relatively prominent TypeScript developer, we'll just, we'll forgive

14:06.960 --> 14:10.640
him, has seven anti-patterns.

14:10.640 --> 14:12.760
Now some of them are like Ladoi.

14:12.760 --> 14:14.120
So I'm just going to burn through them.

14:14.120 --> 14:15.120
Estimates because we have to.

14:15.120 --> 14:18.360
The podcast following order sucks, but hey, that's life.

14:18.360 --> 14:23.920
He said, I strongly disagree with that being an anti-pattern.

14:23.920 --> 14:29.520
And I think anti-pattern might be more better phrased mistakes in this case.

14:29.520 --> 14:32.200
But I'm all right.

14:32.200 --> 14:35.040
We're going to talk about the hashtag no estimates at the end here.

14:35.040 --> 14:39.920
I am just going to assert for my evaluation of his seven anti-patterns that just throwing

14:39.920 --> 14:45.560
your hands up, stamping your feet and saying, I refuse to estimate anything is a pink slip

14:45.560 --> 14:47.320
inducing moment for you.

14:47.320 --> 14:48.480
No kidding.

14:48.480 --> 14:49.780
That only works for doctors.

14:49.780 --> 14:51.080
Nobody else gets away with that.

14:51.080 --> 14:52.080
Right.

14:52.080 --> 14:54.760
We'll talk about it at the end, but I'm going to totally table that.

14:54.760 --> 14:58.640
His second anti-pattern is neglecting different estimation opinions.

14:58.640 --> 14:59.880
He's got a point, right?

14:59.880 --> 15:04.640
So there's like powerful personalities that can be on a team, people who see things differently.

15:04.640 --> 15:09.900
It is good to get most people's feedback, but the dude who just came out of bootcamp

15:09.900 --> 15:15.820
a week ago and the guy who was like an engineer at Bell Labs for 20 years, I might consider

15:15.820 --> 15:18.160
awaiting their opinions slightly differently.

15:18.160 --> 15:19.980
I don't know.

15:19.980 --> 15:22.160
One estimator to rule them all.

15:22.160 --> 15:23.160
Little weird.

15:23.160 --> 15:28.700
I've never actually seen this in the real world, but I guess having like one lead developer,

15:28.700 --> 15:32.400
she just estimates everything.

15:32.400 --> 15:35.960
I guess this man has seen that if he has, that does seem crazy to me.

15:35.960 --> 15:37.480
That seems bizarre.

15:37.480 --> 15:41.640
I could tell you what we do at TMB is we just be just double or triple blind everything.

15:41.640 --> 15:47.520
So more senior people go and we estimate and then we come back to each other and why did

15:47.520 --> 15:49.080
you think this and why did you think that?

15:49.080 --> 15:51.440
And then we usually, yeah.

15:51.440 --> 15:54.840
I could definitely see someone that reviews them, reviews an estimate.

15:54.840 --> 15:55.840
Like yeah, absolutely.

15:55.840 --> 15:56.840
Yeah.

15:56.840 --> 15:57.840
Estimating taking forever.

15:57.840 --> 15:59.920
This is the one I thought was pretty late.

15:59.920 --> 16:04.480
Like yeah, you can't spend three weeks estimating something in today's world.

16:04.480 --> 16:05.480
We just don't live in that world.

16:05.480 --> 16:06.480
Right?

16:06.480 --> 16:07.480
Yeah.

16:07.480 --> 16:08.760
The deal will be closed by the time you get them your estimates.

16:08.760 --> 16:09.760
Right.

16:09.760 --> 16:10.960
Closed by somebody.

16:10.960 --> 16:11.960
By Chris Fisher LLC.

16:11.960 --> 16:12.960
Right.

16:12.960 --> 16:13.960
I mean.

16:13.960 --> 16:18.400
And I got to say this is an area I actually did struggle with a lot is I could get really

16:18.400 --> 16:21.520
bogged down in trying to make sure I thought of all of the hardware components and all

16:21.520 --> 16:26.040
of the time we would need to configure things and I could spend days and that was something

16:26.040 --> 16:30.720
I had to train out of myself is more high level, you know, explain more so they understand

16:30.720 --> 16:32.560
there could be some price variation here.

16:32.560 --> 16:35.040
You know, you don't have to actually get all of the details right then.

16:35.040 --> 16:36.040
Right.

16:36.040 --> 16:39.680
You could spend hours on AliExpress searching for all the different Raspberry Pi dongles

16:39.680 --> 16:42.660
and attachments and components you can buy.

16:42.660 --> 16:45.760
But maybe just find one that you can get in decent quantities.

16:45.760 --> 16:47.160
Yeah.

16:47.160 --> 16:48.720
Estimates need to be correct.

16:48.720 --> 16:56.760
This one, again, I was tempted to say Ladoi, but he's got a point, so I'm going to quote

16:56.760 --> 16:57.920
him a little bit.

16:57.920 --> 17:01.600
The urge to have correct estimates is an anti-pattern that is based on the misunderstanding that

17:01.600 --> 17:06.640
through knowledge or analysis will result in a clear path towards doing the work.

17:06.640 --> 17:11.440
And whenever something took longer or shorter, it shows a lack of knowledge or insufficient

17:11.440 --> 17:12.440
analysis.

17:12.440 --> 17:16.560
It came off as kind of mean to me.

17:16.560 --> 17:19.120
But the more I thought of it, he's right.

17:19.120 --> 17:23.840
Estimates can be wrong because customers exist and change their mind.

17:23.840 --> 17:24.840
Right.

17:24.840 --> 17:30.920
Or Mary Sue wasn't at the original meetings because she wasn't there for vacation or whatever.

17:30.920 --> 17:34.400
And now she's back and it turns out she's like the director of brand or whatever at

17:34.400 --> 17:35.780
that company.

17:35.780 --> 17:38.640
And she actually really, really needs this animation and you guys didn't estimate it

17:38.640 --> 17:41.180
in and it's a pain in the butt because it's not built into iOS.

17:41.180 --> 17:44.840
This is maybe a real world story moving on.

17:44.840 --> 17:48.880
Wait, wait, before you do, I took it another way.

17:48.880 --> 17:54.480
I took that as from the client's perspective, from the customer's perspective.

17:54.480 --> 18:05.400
If you estimate $15,000 and it comes in at $43,000 or $22,000 or even $18,000, they will

18:05.400 --> 18:08.480
think you didn't estimate correctly.

18:08.480 --> 18:12.720
Even if they are actually the ones that caused the scope creep, they're the ones that had

18:12.720 --> 18:19.840
to send you back three times to change the colors, their first reaction is going to be

18:19.840 --> 18:22.400
it's your fault because you're the person selling to them.

18:22.400 --> 18:26.200
You told me it's going to be $15,000, now you're telling me it's $18,000.

18:26.200 --> 18:27.340
You must have estimated wrong.

18:27.340 --> 18:29.160
What did you get wrong?

18:29.160 --> 18:30.240
That is a very good point.

18:30.240 --> 18:32.680
I could definitely see reading it that way.

18:32.680 --> 18:36.880
The other sad truth with that is, unfortunately, it's almost always your fault even when it's

18:36.880 --> 18:38.300
not right.

18:38.300 --> 18:42.880
If you want to keep the relationship, keep them as a customer, you're going to have to

18:42.880 --> 18:47.480
not eat the money, definitely don't eat $30,000, but find a way to change the conversation

18:47.480 --> 18:53.840
from well, Mary Sue was on vacation in Maui when this decision was made and we didn't

18:53.840 --> 18:59.680
bid that into, okay, obviously, we need to change course here.

18:59.680 --> 19:03.120
It's an uncomfortable conversation, but you basically got to get more money out of them.

19:03.120 --> 19:10.560
I think the only way to really do that, in my experience, successfully is constant expectation

19:10.560 --> 19:15.760
setting, letting them know, hey, the way this is going right now, this is going to cost.

19:15.760 --> 19:20.640
Just like immediately, as soon as the conversation comes up, you start bringing up how that could

19:20.640 --> 19:22.720
increase the cost.

19:22.720 --> 19:26.800
If you don't, it just gets harder and more awkward to mention it as time goes on.

19:26.800 --> 19:30.200
Well, it's like any relationship, right?

19:30.200 --> 19:37.440
The deeper into unhappiness you are with each other, the harder even little, Chris and I

19:37.440 --> 19:38.440
are both divorced, right?

19:38.440 --> 19:43.280
I won't speak for Chris, but when everybody's getting along, forgetting to turn on the dishwasher

19:43.280 --> 19:45.160
is nothing.

19:45.160 --> 19:49.720
When everybody's been fighting for six months, you will go to war for that.

19:49.720 --> 19:51.120
Yeah, right.

19:51.120 --> 19:52.120
That's so well put.

19:52.120 --> 19:53.120
All right.

19:53.120 --> 19:58.680
His last one, one of the most harmful anti-patterns of estimates is how they are misused as commitments

19:58.680 --> 20:03.140
by people outside the team, people with power over the team.

20:03.140 --> 20:06.520
And after everything I discussed already, it is probably clear that this is dumb.

20:06.520 --> 20:08.240
Still many developers are in this position.

20:08.240 --> 20:12.360
I actually totally reject this one.

20:12.360 --> 20:15.720
And his headline for this estimates are turned into commitments.

20:15.720 --> 20:17.540
I'm curious what you feel about this, Chris.

20:17.540 --> 20:23.000
My take is the end client, the end customer, the business stakeholders, the product managers,

20:23.000 --> 20:30.160
your fellow developers, the DBAs, the QC people, your dog, right?

20:30.160 --> 20:33.080
People need to know when things are roughly going to be done.

20:33.080 --> 20:37.920
They need to know what things are going to roughly cost within reason, even if it's not

20:37.920 --> 20:41.600
like this is what the entire project costs forever and ever and ever.

20:41.600 --> 20:45.760
This is like what your monthly runway is going to be or something in that ballpark.

20:45.760 --> 20:52.880
I just don't agree that they're not some form of maybe not firm in stone like Moses's

20:52.880 --> 20:55.760
Ten Commandments, but they're like a soft guideline, right?

20:55.760 --> 20:57.200
They're a soft commitment.

20:57.200 --> 20:58.200
They have to be.

20:58.200 --> 20:59.200
Right.

20:59.200 --> 21:00.200
Unfortunately.

21:00.200 --> 21:06.520
I mean, I guess if you had some sort of super awesome modern hipster tooling that everybody

21:06.520 --> 21:12.200
could go and check the status of the of the project and get real time updates, that could

21:12.200 --> 21:15.560
substitute some kind of estimate that gets circulated.

21:15.560 --> 21:16.880
But so it's funny you bring that up.

21:16.880 --> 21:18.880
I did some searching.

21:18.880 --> 21:24.440
There is a cottage industry of SAS companies who want to sell you their whiz bang.

21:24.440 --> 21:27.100
We will estimate for you tool, huh?

21:27.100 --> 21:30.400
Is it like based on like hook it to your Trello and we'll figure out your velocity or hook

21:30.400 --> 21:31.400
it to your Jira.

21:31.400 --> 21:32.400
A lot of Jira.

21:32.400 --> 21:33.400
Yeah, I see.

21:33.400 --> 21:34.400
Huh?

21:34.400 --> 21:35.400
Yeah.

21:35.400 --> 21:36.400
Of course.

21:36.400 --> 21:37.400
Of course there is.

21:37.400 --> 21:38.400
Yeah.

21:38.400 --> 21:39.400
Kind of.

21:39.400 --> 21:40.400
You say it.

21:40.400 --> 21:43.680
Now you say, like, it sounds like a good idea.

21:43.680 --> 21:49.040
It feels like one of those ideas that's like super seductive, but always that's like the

21:49.040 --> 21:50.040
fourth martini.

21:50.040 --> 21:52.160
It sounds like a good idea.

21:52.160 --> 21:54.260
Definitely won't be tomorrow.

21:54.260 --> 21:56.840
Until some sort of tooling is adopted, probably in the metaverse.

21:56.840 --> 22:00.800
Yeah, it's always going to act as a way to at least that rough milestones.

22:00.800 --> 22:05.360
So wait, wait in the metaverse when you're doing estimating, I got to do this.

22:05.360 --> 22:06.360
You'll pop right in.

22:06.360 --> 22:08.200
It'll just be this giant Trello board, right?

22:08.200 --> 22:10.960
There'll be this floating Trello board right there in the middle of the room.

22:10.960 --> 22:14.900
You described a nightmare I keep having, actually, where Trello cards are just like spinning

22:14.900 --> 22:16.720
at me like ninja stars.

22:16.720 --> 22:17.720
Right.

22:17.720 --> 22:18.720
You got to dodge them.

22:18.720 --> 22:19.720
There's so many.

22:19.720 --> 22:20.720
You open up a door.

22:20.720 --> 22:22.440
They just come piling down on top of you.

22:22.440 --> 22:26.380
It's the most horrific game of Beat Saber ever played.

22:26.380 --> 22:30.680
Every card is marked high priority.

22:30.680 --> 22:32.240
So but in the metaverse, I like this.

22:32.240 --> 22:35.800
If the sales guy gives an estimate, can you walk in the metaverse and smack him in the

22:35.800 --> 22:37.800
back of the head?

22:37.800 --> 22:39.600
You'll have actually a virtual martini.

22:39.600 --> 22:41.800
You could just, you know, toss on his face.

22:41.800 --> 22:45.400
Well, you know, we could get the Ferengi to hook us up with some Synthohol and just pour

22:45.400 --> 22:48.040
it on him.

22:48.040 --> 22:50.200
So the last one is others do the estimation.

22:50.200 --> 22:53.120
This is my slap the sales guy in the back of the head one.

22:53.120 --> 22:54.120
I agree.

22:54.120 --> 22:55.120
That's a bad idea.

22:55.120 --> 22:58.320
Sales guy, their job, collect sale, make commission.

22:58.320 --> 22:59.640
Their job.

22:59.640 --> 23:02.840
Usually a lot of them don't care about actually like managing the customer relationship.

23:02.840 --> 23:05.220
The good ones do, but they're very expensive.

23:05.220 --> 23:07.640
So yeah, got to watch that.

23:07.640 --> 23:10.800
It's kind of like bearing the lead.

23:10.800 --> 23:16.040
This is the number I in my experience, the number one issue can be in this situation.

23:16.040 --> 23:19.880
Sales will promise the moon for the to get to close the sale and they'll say that engineering

23:19.880 --> 23:20.880
can do anything.

23:20.880 --> 23:21.880
I mean, they really will.

23:21.880 --> 23:27.840
It's been I know it's a cliche, but I have witnessed it happen over and over again and

23:27.840 --> 23:33.400
it's unbelievable what they and then now that's what the customer expects.

23:33.400 --> 23:35.820
And that was the very at the very beginning of the relationship.

23:35.820 --> 23:38.760
They have that expectation and you're constantly trying to live up to that.

23:38.760 --> 23:39.760
All right.

23:39.760 --> 23:40.760
I was having flashbacks.

23:40.760 --> 23:41.760
Yeah.

23:41.760 --> 23:49.560
So, OK, let's talk about the very vocal, very angry Twitter.

23:49.560 --> 23:51.920
No estimates, guys.

23:51.920 --> 23:55.000
I still don't buy it.

23:55.000 --> 23:56.000
I just don't buy it.

23:56.000 --> 23:57.640
I talked about it years ago.

23:57.640 --> 24:00.360
We got a lot of spicy emails about it.

24:00.360 --> 24:01.880
I don't know where you're working.

24:01.880 --> 24:03.880
I don't know what you're doing.

24:03.880 --> 24:09.440
Even like internal product products or projects, there is absolutely no way you don't need

24:09.440 --> 24:10.920
to know what things cost.

24:10.920 --> 24:13.800
Well, maybe they are doing government contracts.

24:13.800 --> 24:16.600
OK, Raytheon, you don't count.

24:16.600 --> 24:17.600
I agree.

24:17.600 --> 24:18.600
It seems impossible.

24:18.600 --> 24:22.840
The only way it could possibly work is if it was like internal proposals and somebody

24:22.840 --> 24:24.120
else just dealt with budget.

24:24.120 --> 24:29.920
Well, I had it explained to me several times and it's just so foreign from anything I've

24:29.920 --> 24:30.920
ever seen.

24:30.920 --> 24:33.560
How would how would even work like the customer?

24:33.560 --> 24:38.920
I mean, part of opening the door to the relationship is the estimate process and the emails that

24:38.920 --> 24:39.920
come back and forth.

24:39.920 --> 24:42.200
Like that's part of the courting part process.

24:42.200 --> 24:46.880
I don't understand how you land the sale without an estimate at some point eventually.

24:46.880 --> 24:51.560
So let me let me try to steel man their argument and I'll tell you why I rejected out of hand.

24:51.560 --> 24:56.360
So the best version of their argument is the estimates are effectively lies.

24:56.360 --> 24:59.000
You're troubling the relationship by starting it off.

24:59.000 --> 25:02.360
You know, you're always going to they basically believe you're always going to underestimate,

25:02.360 --> 25:05.560
which I think is actually like as a premise, probably true.

25:05.560 --> 25:06.560
Right.

25:06.560 --> 25:09.960
It's I would say, you know, on average, it's more true than not.

25:09.960 --> 25:13.240
It's one of those things I think we would all agree on on its face, but we don't have

25:13.240 --> 25:15.360
the numbers.

25:15.360 --> 25:18.460
You know, you want to keep a it's very like super duper agile.

25:18.460 --> 25:22.160
You want to keep a tight connection with the customer and you want to keep things flowing.

25:22.160 --> 25:28.280
But where I don't what they don't talk about is that sales process that you were just talking

25:28.280 --> 25:36.320
about, because I don't know what niche they're in, but there are other vendors who would

25:36.320 --> 25:38.900
be more than happy to take a contract from you.

25:38.900 --> 25:40.240
He doesn't want to do an estimation.

25:40.240 --> 25:41.240
No problem.

25:41.240 --> 25:42.240
We will.

25:42.240 --> 25:44.280
You know, entities have processes, right?

25:44.280 --> 25:47.600
Businesses have processes and a lot of that process.

25:47.600 --> 25:53.240
They have revolver on RFPs for pressure proposals and writing proposals is a thing that happens.

25:53.240 --> 25:59.160
Now I definitely have adopted a little bit of the no estimate attitude is I'm not going

25:59.160 --> 26:01.160
to do like a 14 page proposal.

26:01.160 --> 26:04.760
I usually try to do a one or two page or broad strokes.

26:04.760 --> 26:08.960
You know, this would be like an hourly or a weekly or whatever, however kind of arrangement

26:08.960 --> 26:11.320
we're doing run rate.

26:11.320 --> 26:18.560
But the idea to just do nothing to just say, hey, you'll find out later seems a little

26:18.560 --> 26:20.480
hardcore.

26:20.480 --> 26:24.200
I am happy to hear from you all again.

26:24.200 --> 26:26.800
Perhaps I have misunderstood something.

26:26.800 --> 26:32.520
I would love to know some real world cases, even if it was, you know, in confidence where

26:32.520 --> 26:39.040
this has actually worked because I have never in my very, very long time of doing this started

26:39.040 --> 26:43.520
a conversation where someone didn't ask me at least how long something was going to take,

26:43.520 --> 26:44.520
right?

26:44.520 --> 26:50.360
If not, you know, directly opening the money conversation in the first first meeting.

26:50.360 --> 26:51.480
So I don't know.

26:51.480 --> 26:58.800
The other the other, I guess, elephant in the room here is Agile XP, which I get.

26:58.800 --> 27:00.920
It's called Beast now, which is insane.

27:00.920 --> 27:01.920
Oh, yeah.

27:01.920 --> 27:04.360
I don't know Twitter.

27:04.360 --> 27:08.560
We got to rebrand everything so we can be gurus right and sell consulting services.

27:08.560 --> 27:09.560
Yeah.

27:09.560 --> 27:13.120
And plus, if you give it a newer, cooler name, you know, maybe you can bring in some more

27:13.120 --> 27:15.600
people because it's not that old weird agile thing.

27:15.600 --> 27:16.880
This is beast.

27:16.880 --> 27:18.840
This is beast mode, baby.

27:18.840 --> 27:20.680
Tiger's blood.

27:20.680 --> 27:21.680
Tiger's blood.

27:21.680 --> 27:24.480
If anybody gets that reference, good work.

27:24.480 --> 27:27.920
That is one way to avoid the big overarching estimate.

27:27.920 --> 27:31.560
And that is basically what I do.

27:31.560 --> 27:33.800
But you're still giving an estimate of some sort.

27:33.800 --> 27:39.840
You're giving a whether it's monthly, weekly, biweekly, a sprint, you probably have a very

27:39.840 --> 27:44.800
stable run run rate, you definitely have to tell the customer if that run rate is going

27:44.800 --> 27:48.320
to go up and get their approval for that, right?

27:48.320 --> 27:51.520
Let's say you're adding someone or removing someone.

27:51.520 --> 27:57.720
And I think the the dirty little thing behind agile is it really assumes a time and materials

27:57.720 --> 28:04.000
billing structure where you're de risking really the project for everybody, but definitely

28:04.000 --> 28:07.120
for you.

28:07.120 --> 28:09.400
Because you're not doing a ton of design upfront, right?

28:09.400 --> 28:12.800
You're not doing BDuff, you're not doing waterfall.

28:12.800 --> 28:17.840
Sometimes problems last over a decade, or in this case, 30 something years.

28:17.840 --> 28:22.120
Sometimes they are in fact hard.

28:22.120 --> 28:23.600
Linode.com slash coder.

28:23.600 --> 28:27.680
Go there to get $100 in 60 day credit, it's a great way to support the show and try out

28:27.680 --> 28:28.680
Linode.

28:28.680 --> 28:31.720
So it's Linode.com slash coder.

28:31.720 --> 28:35.040
Linode is just simply fast, reliable cloud hosting.

28:35.040 --> 28:37.960
You've got to try it for your next project, maybe for your personal site.

28:37.960 --> 28:41.220
It's what I use personally, it's what we use for the business too.

28:41.220 --> 28:44.880
Especially now that Linode has been rolling out these MVME upgrades, systems just got

28:44.880 --> 28:49.240
MVME disk and all of a sudden, my existing Linode systems were getting faster.

28:49.240 --> 28:52.520
And now of course, you can deploy systems with MVME from the get go.

28:52.520 --> 28:56.100
And Linode has recently announced they're going to open a dozen new data centers over

28:56.100 --> 28:57.100
next year.

28:57.100 --> 29:01.520
And you know, Linode is their own ISP too, so the connections are super fast.

29:01.520 --> 29:06.340
Oh man, I meant to pull up this GPU rig, I wonder if I can get logged in fast enough.

29:06.340 --> 29:11.200
So over the weekend, we set up a GPU rig for Linux Unplugged because we were playing around

29:11.200 --> 29:12.680
with stable diffusion.

29:12.680 --> 29:20.400
And until that point, I had been using it on my M1 Ultra Max Diffusion B, but then we

29:20.400 --> 29:29.720
threw stable diffusion on a Linode with an RTX 6000 GPU and 32 gigabytes of RAM and eight

29:29.720 --> 29:31.380
CPU cores.

29:31.380 --> 29:34.920
And I believe, although I was trying to verify this, but I'm pretty sure I saw this too,

29:34.920 --> 29:40.280
I believe it has a 40 gigabit connection to the internet.

29:40.280 --> 29:44.040
That's so crazy and I mean, surprise, surprise, right?

29:44.040 --> 29:49.840
But it smokes my MacBook Max Ultra machine on the stable diffusion stuff.

29:49.840 --> 29:54.280
I mean, stuff that the MacBook would take like a couple of minutes to do, this thing

29:54.280 --> 29:56.320
does in like 10, 20 seconds.

29:56.320 --> 30:00.720
The Linode infrastructure is so fast and powerful because on the other end, right, I've got

30:00.720 --> 30:02.760
these little itty bitty Linodes too.

30:02.760 --> 30:06.900
I've got what they call a Nanode, which is just this tiny little box that we use just

30:06.900 --> 30:10.640
to do status checking of our systems, you know, just to do health checks and make sure

30:10.640 --> 30:12.480
everything's online.

30:12.480 --> 30:14.760
And the scale there is incredible.

30:14.760 --> 30:21.680
I've got systems with one gig of RAM and I've got systems on Linode with 96 gigs of RAM

30:21.680 --> 30:24.340
and 48 CPU cores on that one too.

30:24.340 --> 30:29.980
I mean, the range is, it's so great and the pricing is still 30 to 50% cheaper than anything

30:29.980 --> 30:33.600
at the hyperscalers and you get the full machine.

30:33.600 --> 30:35.680
Like I get, this whole Linode is mine.

30:35.680 --> 30:38.000
I have root access, I log in, I set everything up.

30:38.000 --> 30:39.660
It's screaming fast.

30:39.660 --> 30:41.760
They also have dedicated physical boxes available now.

30:41.760 --> 30:45.680
Of course, they have S3 compatible object storage, totally compatible with Kubernetes

30:45.680 --> 30:52.400
and your other infrastructure management tools, great DNS tools, firewalls, node balancers,

30:52.400 --> 30:54.840
you name it, Linode has got it and the pricing is right.

30:54.840 --> 30:57.600
Plus you're going to get a hundred bucks if you support the show and go to linode.com

30:57.600 --> 30:58.600
slash coder.

30:58.600 --> 31:01.880
You can really try just to buy anything out with that hundred dollar credit.

31:01.880 --> 31:02.880
So go try it out.

31:02.880 --> 31:03.880
See why we love it.

31:03.880 --> 31:04.880
Linode.com slash coder.

31:04.880 --> 31:12.080
You know, a lot of people are listening thinking, if he just got married, what's he doing on

31:12.080 --> 31:13.080
the show?

31:13.080 --> 31:15.960
Because that's what people said to me on Sunday when I said, yeah, join us.

31:15.960 --> 31:17.920
It's going to be a great coder because Mike just got married.

31:17.920 --> 31:21.120
You know, give him a congrats, come into the chat room, say hi to him.

31:21.120 --> 31:22.480
And people are like, what?

31:22.480 --> 31:29.480
He's coming to work on Monday after he just got married, which I did something very similar.

31:29.480 --> 31:31.200
What are we just a glutton for punishment?

31:31.200 --> 31:35.520
Well, you're up there in Seattle and I didn't want you to, you know, I was a little afraid

31:35.520 --> 31:38.000
you were feeling those Microsoft vibes.

31:38.000 --> 31:40.720
Yeah, I got you.

31:40.720 --> 31:41.720
I got you.

31:41.720 --> 31:42.720
Yeah.

31:42.720 --> 31:43.720
You know, that's true.

31:43.720 --> 31:44.720
It's dark days up here.

31:44.720 --> 31:49.080
So you and I, we got a band together and stay strong because you asked me over the weekend

31:49.080 --> 31:54.200
and I have heard from a couple of listeners who worked at Microsoft.

31:54.200 --> 31:59.280
I say worked the, although they were laid off a bit ago actually July, I think.

31:59.280 --> 32:03.960
Yeah, not with this recent, most recent round, but Microsoft is laying off, quote, under

32:03.960 --> 32:07.520
1000 workers, 999, baby.

32:07.520 --> 32:08.520
Yeah.

32:08.520 --> 32:13.760
But that's after there's also been some low key layoffs for the last few months.

32:13.760 --> 32:16.600
And then of course, I thought Brad Sam's on Twitter had an interesting point.

32:16.600 --> 32:20.300
He says, I get the companies have to make priorities and cuts happen, but it's odd when

32:20.300 --> 32:26.080
that same company is trying to spend $70 billion on acquisition.

32:26.080 --> 32:28.160
It feels odd.

32:28.160 --> 32:34.320
That is a hard like $70 billion feels like a lot of money right now to basically control

32:34.320 --> 32:35.960
the console video game market.

32:35.960 --> 32:37.360
I don't think that's too bad.

32:37.360 --> 32:38.360
Yeah.

32:38.360 --> 32:42.240
I mean, to be to be the Disney of video games, ultimately, it's probably not too bad, but

32:42.240 --> 32:47.600
it does seem hard when you're laying off people, but still spending 70 bill to bring in, you

32:47.600 --> 32:50.000
know, a company that's riddled with issues.

32:50.000 --> 32:57.160
However, I had to think about this Microsoft, Apple and Google have been doing this layoff

32:57.160 --> 33:02.840
thing and they're doing it low key, but they are occasionally making announcements.

33:02.840 --> 33:04.760
Now, why would a company make an announcement?

33:04.760 --> 33:14.320
Why would they do some that are low key on the DL and then announce some via press release?

33:14.320 --> 33:17.880
And when a company releases something like a might when a public company like Microsoft

33:17.880 --> 33:23.380
or Apple release something via press release, in part, they're signaling to the market.

33:23.380 --> 33:25.680
They're signaling to Wall Street.

33:25.680 --> 33:30.720
And what Microsoft and Apple and Google are signaling is we're taking leadership on this

33:30.720 --> 33:31.720
issue.

33:31.720 --> 33:38.840
We recognize that the last 10 years of loose money, zero interest rates, everybody's been

33:38.840 --> 33:40.800
at a party with free alcohol.

33:40.800 --> 33:41.800
Think of it that way.

33:41.800 --> 33:44.460
That's actually what's been going on in the financial markets.

33:44.460 --> 33:51.380
The Fed's been throwing a banger of a party for a decade and the bar has been free.

33:51.380 --> 33:58.220
And so companies have been sucking up billions of dollars and they've been hiring like crazy

33:58.220 --> 34:02.080
in the name of what investors call chasing beta.

34:02.080 --> 34:08.060
And what that roughly means is they're chasing something that doesn't return value today,

34:08.060 --> 34:13.080
but will likely one of these bets will pay off big in the next decade.

34:13.080 --> 34:15.960
And so you're chasing future return.

34:15.960 --> 34:20.720
And what's happened because rates have gone up, what, 65%, 70%, I mean, the rates are

34:20.720 --> 34:24.080
going and they're continuing to go up, the interest rate, the price of money is continuing

34:24.080 --> 34:30.240
to go up, the bar is now charging and the price is going up monthly.

34:30.240 --> 34:35.120
And so now what investors are seeking and they're looking for it really bad right now,

34:35.120 --> 34:38.460
really hard, is what they call alpha.

34:38.460 --> 34:39.880
That's return today.

34:39.880 --> 34:40.880
That's value return.

34:40.880 --> 34:44.120
This is your Warren Buffett type investor, your value investor.

34:44.120 --> 34:47.080
You invest in things that are making money today.

34:47.080 --> 34:51.160
And the view by investors has become it's time.

34:51.160 --> 34:53.680
You've just had a decade of free money.

34:53.680 --> 34:57.920
If you didn't produce something that returns money at this point, it's time for you to

34:57.920 --> 34:59.120
die.

34:59.120 --> 35:05.140
And so you're seeing the very large companies take a leadership role in pivoting to value.

35:05.140 --> 35:11.060
Apple has paused production of the iPhone 14 Pro because demand is soft and they want

35:11.060 --> 35:13.180
to keep revenues up.

35:13.180 --> 35:19.080
They're doing layoffs, Google, Microsoft, Apple layoffs, and then you have your mid

35:19.080 --> 35:25.600
to small tech companies that have just been pumped with series A, B, C, D, even F rounds

35:25.600 --> 35:30.000
of funding, which is we're going to look back at that as ludicrous and they're dying off

35:30.000 --> 35:32.120
and they're going to be laying off.

35:32.120 --> 35:33.840
Saved by acquisition, some of them, right?

35:33.840 --> 35:34.840
Right.

35:34.840 --> 35:35.840
Yeah.

35:35.840 --> 35:38.840
Or I should say the investors, the VCs will be saved by acquisition.

35:38.840 --> 35:39.840
Yeah.

35:39.840 --> 35:42.400
The companies will be strip mined for IP and the most valuable.

35:42.400 --> 35:43.400
Right.

35:43.400 --> 35:47.640
One might think of Twitter in this case, who, I mean, Elon Musk has to be their best friend

35:47.640 --> 35:48.640
right now.

35:48.640 --> 35:49.640
Somehow.

35:49.640 --> 35:54.720
Supposed 75% layoffs, he's, how could, is that, could that be real that he's really

35:54.720 --> 35:55.720
thinking that?

35:55.720 --> 35:56.720
Yeah.

35:56.720 --> 35:57.720
Cause the company's not worth 50.

35:57.720 --> 35:59.120
I mean, wouldn't everybody else has covered it.

35:59.120 --> 36:00.880
It's the math is stupid, right?

36:00.880 --> 36:01.880
That's something.

36:01.880 --> 36:02.880
Don't tweet drunk or high.

36:02.880 --> 36:04.160
That's all I got to say.

36:04.160 --> 36:07.840
And don't send letters through the SEC drunk or high either.

36:07.840 --> 36:15.280
I feel bad for the people being laid off, but like every bender, this one had to end.

36:15.280 --> 36:16.280
Yeah.

36:16.280 --> 36:17.720
But the hangover could be pretty significant.

36:17.720 --> 36:20.320
It's well, it's going to be full on withdrawals, right?

36:20.320 --> 36:22.840
Until the bar goes free again, which I imagine it will at some point.

36:22.840 --> 36:24.600
I'm hoping it doesn't.

36:24.600 --> 36:28.160
Early episodes of the show, I used to rail against these companies that don't in fact

36:28.160 --> 36:29.160
make money.

36:29.160 --> 36:30.160
Right.

36:30.160 --> 36:31.160
They don't turn a profit.

36:31.160 --> 36:35.540
These startups, they just, you know, they, they burn through money and they just get

36:35.540 --> 36:41.640
acquired as an acqui-hire or they get acquired and they get acquired based on their potential

36:41.640 --> 36:43.240
future revenue.

36:43.240 --> 36:47.360
And then everybody who's in a leadership role or on the board, I may or may not have firsthand

36:47.360 --> 36:52.520
experience with this, gets a payout based on the theoretical stocks that they own that

36:52.520 --> 36:55.380
are going to be worth something at some point in the future.

36:55.380 --> 36:59.420
And so there's this massive exchange of money, even though the company never necessarily

36:59.420 --> 37:05.200
got profitable and sustainable, but they had a future potential value and that's what they

37:05.200 --> 37:06.200
get.

37:06.200 --> 37:08.720
Some of that is that there's a ratio of that, that they get bought for and then everybody

37:08.720 --> 37:09.720
gets paid out.

37:09.720 --> 37:10.720
Yeah, absolutely.

37:10.720 --> 37:14.440
Or I mean, I shouldn't name the company, but there was a company, I did not work there.

37:14.440 --> 37:19.020
I did not contract there, but I knew some of the developers there in New York that did

37:19.020 --> 37:25.360
basically a Netflix for books style thing, a large tech company bought them simply to

37:25.360 --> 37:27.400
kill them.

37:27.400 --> 37:29.420
That was it.

37:29.420 --> 37:30.420
That is so common.

37:30.420 --> 37:31.420
Oh yeah.

37:31.420 --> 37:34.080
And Zapier, can you just buy us?

37:34.080 --> 37:35.080
We'll go away.

37:35.080 --> 37:38.320
But that is like, what's up?

37:38.320 --> 37:48.600
That's so, it's just, it was such a Roman-esque bacchanalia that it had to stop.

37:48.600 --> 37:52.080
If you watch the show, We Crashed, a lot of people think, well, that's insane.

37:52.080 --> 37:53.080
That's a joke.

37:53.080 --> 37:55.640
I've seen like that.

37:55.640 --> 37:58.200
I've seen literal penis statues.

37:58.200 --> 38:06.440
I've seen parties that can only be described as like Dante-esque, some circle of hell that

38:06.440 --> 38:08.800
no one's coming out of their happy, right?

38:08.800 --> 38:11.480
There's no way the money printer doesn't turn back on.

38:11.480 --> 38:12.480
Come on.

38:12.480 --> 38:16.360
There's no way, because there are just things on the books that the government is committed

38:16.360 --> 38:21.800
to paying that somebody has to buy that debt.

38:21.800 --> 38:26.360
And the issue is, is that that debt is getting less and less attractive to buyers right now.

38:26.360 --> 38:29.360
And so inevitably the buyer of last resort will be the Federal Reserve.

38:29.360 --> 38:31.720
They'll step in, they'll start buying the government's debt again.

38:31.720 --> 38:32.720
Yeah.

38:32.720 --> 38:33.720
It'll have to happen.

38:33.720 --> 38:37.880
If that happens, then in the, particularly in whatever sector is hot right now, but this

38:37.880 --> 38:42.800
last round it was tech, and in particular like consumer software, you're going to have

38:42.800 --> 38:49.120
these boom and bust cycles, whatever, whether there's B2B software or something else, you're

38:49.120 --> 38:55.400
going to have these crazy, honestly, if that's true, now's the time to start your business,

38:55.400 --> 38:57.000
get some foundations.

38:57.000 --> 39:02.000
And when the bar says happy hour, take that VC money, baby, and get out, get out in five

39:02.000 --> 39:03.000
years.

39:03.000 --> 39:07.440
I mean, look what happened is instead of, instead of chasing traditional investments

39:07.440 --> 39:11.120
like bonds and things like that, investors went after tech.

39:11.120 --> 39:12.440
That's what they went after.

39:12.440 --> 39:16.000
And they stopped, they stopped caring about the fundamentals.

39:16.000 --> 39:18.960
And so a company didn't necessarily have to make profit in order for everybody to get

39:18.960 --> 39:19.960
paid out.

39:19.960 --> 39:28.280
What's happening is we have a massive glut of under skilled tech leadership out there.

39:28.280 --> 39:33.520
The whole leadership team for so many of these companies, and you guys know this is true,

39:33.520 --> 39:38.040
are totally mediocre because they didn't have to be great.

39:38.040 --> 39:41.300
They weren't fighting for absolute survival.

39:41.300 --> 39:45.960
There wasn't this natural selection where the absolute rock stars of the companies are

39:45.960 --> 39:54.240
the ones that get promoted because the profit came from the investments, not from the product.

39:54.240 --> 40:00.080
And so it created a culture of extremely weak leadership.

40:00.080 --> 40:03.040
And some of that has to be rained out as well.

40:03.040 --> 40:08.000
I mean, I would like the money printer to stay off for a while because the longer we

40:08.000 --> 40:13.140
keep raising rates, the longer the money printer stays off, the more of this gets cleaned out

40:13.140 --> 40:14.140
of the system.

40:14.140 --> 40:19.880
Unfortunately, the worse it gets, the more jobs, the more of the supply chain gets damaged,

40:19.880 --> 40:22.680
the more long term damage that gets done to the economy.

40:22.680 --> 40:26.440
So part of me doesn't want it to keep going, but I would love to see some of this get cleaned

40:26.440 --> 40:27.440
up.

40:27.440 --> 40:28.440
Okay.

40:28.440 --> 40:33.040
But isn't this kind of, okay, I see what you're saying, the supply chain.

40:33.040 --> 40:37.640
But isn't part of that because of just how easy it was for these companies when the,

40:37.640 --> 40:40.920
when the ale was flowing freely, so to speak?

40:40.920 --> 40:41.920
Yeah.

40:41.920 --> 40:43.520
That they didn't build up the muscles, right?

40:43.520 --> 40:47.800
These are like, these are like, I have a Tibetan spaniel, these dogs would never survive in

40:47.800 --> 40:48.800
nature ever.

40:48.800 --> 40:49.800
Exactly.

40:49.800 --> 40:51.800
Or, but a wolf could, right?

40:51.800 --> 40:57.040
Hell, a husky could, a beagle could, we need to, I don't know, be better breeders.

40:57.040 --> 41:01.880
Someone's going to hashtag that, it's going to be bad.

41:01.880 --> 41:08.520
Mike gets married, extols young tech entrepreneurs to be better breeders, gets canceled by GLAD.

41:08.520 --> 41:13.840
Just I'm thinking of like startups I've seen that were so stupid on their face.

41:13.840 --> 41:20.440
I don't know how those guys survived the call home to mom, let alone a board meeting, right?

41:20.440 --> 41:25.840
I mean, you're probably right though, since if unemployment hits what, like 8%, the government

41:25.840 --> 41:32.160
will freak out and it'll be absinthe and gin for everybody.

41:32.160 --> 41:36.280
There's already, no, supposedly it was leaked to the Wall Street Journal that the Federal

41:36.280 --> 41:40.240
Reserve is considering making changes to their current strategy.

41:40.240 --> 41:44.800
Janet Yellen just earlier this week came out and said, we think it's getting a little dicey,

41:44.800 --> 41:47.400
it might be time for a policy change.

41:47.400 --> 41:51.200
So I don't know, I think we're already starting to actually see it, unfortunately.

41:51.200 --> 41:55.520
Doesn't it chap your ass though, like businesses like ours and like our friends at System76

41:55.520 --> 42:02.760
and other places that actually just like managed to survive and, you know, actually make money.

42:02.760 --> 42:04.960
They kind of missed out on this.

42:04.960 --> 42:08.120
But if they keep the pressure up for long, all our customers could be gone.

42:08.120 --> 42:12.000
Well, yeah, but so how do you say, so there's no way to solve the problem.

42:12.000 --> 42:17.520
Basically we go into another drunken bender or we what, it's the ice age?

42:17.520 --> 42:18.520
I don't know.

42:18.520 --> 42:20.080
I mean, that's above our pay grade.

42:20.080 --> 42:23.760
I think what a lot of people that are listening are probably thinking, well, that's, you know,

42:23.760 --> 42:29.400
once we go through one more bender and, you know, maybe we make it a few more years and

42:29.400 --> 42:32.880
by the time that bender is wrapped up, maybe a CBDC is ready.

42:32.880 --> 42:34.480
That's what I think probably a lot of people would speculate.

42:34.480 --> 42:35.480
I don't know.

42:35.480 --> 42:36.480
I really have no idea.

42:36.480 --> 42:39.360
But, you know, the one thing that's remarkable is they always manage to pull a trick out

42:39.360 --> 42:45.520
of their hat and keep things going, you know, so it's almost safe to bet on that, I suppose.

42:45.520 --> 42:47.200
I think it's interesting.

42:47.200 --> 42:53.300
Our sponsor, Talescale, I noticed was super savvy about the way they raised funds recently

42:53.300 --> 42:55.840
in December of last year or somewhere around there.

42:55.840 --> 43:01.200
Like I think their leadership clearly saw this downturn coming and made some really

43:01.200 --> 43:05.480
clever moves to invest long term in their infrastructure because I think they suspected

43:05.480 --> 43:08.160
that, you know, the money printers were stopping as well.

43:08.160 --> 43:11.680
And so there's tech companies out there that will thrive in this environment.

43:11.680 --> 43:13.960
I'm legitimately a little nervous about it.

43:13.960 --> 43:17.720
You know, it's sort of like I'm just a monkey in a zoo.

43:17.720 --> 43:20.600
I don't really have any say over what the zookeepers do.

43:20.600 --> 43:26.660
So I should just sit back and try to enjoy my cage and swing from the branches and see

43:26.660 --> 43:27.660
what happens.

43:27.660 --> 43:33.160
But I think actually in some ways you and I are better positioned.

43:33.160 --> 43:38.520
If we had a staff of 30, 40 or 100, I think you and I would probably be in more of a panic

43:38.520 --> 43:39.520
mode right now.

43:39.520 --> 43:40.520
Oh, yeah.

43:40.520 --> 43:41.520
Oh, yeah.

43:41.520 --> 43:42.520
So we'll see.

43:42.520 --> 43:45.200
Batten down the hatches, another storm approaches.

43:45.200 --> 43:50.840
Always an uplifting show for you guys.

43:50.840 --> 43:52.460
Talescale.com slash coder.

43:52.460 --> 43:56.400
Go there to get a free personal account for up to 20 devices.

43:56.400 --> 44:02.800
You can build a mesh VPN with zero config, all powered by WireGuard's noise protocol.

44:02.800 --> 44:04.040
That's Talescale.

44:04.040 --> 44:06.820
The magic, though, is in all the tooling around it.

44:06.820 --> 44:11.760
You can quickly set up any machine, any device in this Talescale network in seconds.

44:11.760 --> 44:15.200
It allows you to manage SSH connections between your boxes.

44:15.200 --> 44:19.360
It has AirDrop like functionality so you can send files between all of your Talescale network

44:19.360 --> 44:25.680
machines, your devices, your Linux boxes, Windows, Mac, Android, you name it.

44:25.680 --> 44:29.680
I use it on a Raspberry Pi, I use it on my VMs, I use it on my physical systems.

44:29.680 --> 44:33.960
I even install it on my Home Assistant instance using the Home Assistant add on.

44:33.960 --> 44:38.600
It's just super powerful and it puts all of my devices on a flat network with static IPs

44:38.600 --> 44:40.240
and you can throw DNS in there.

44:40.240 --> 44:41.520
Now you're doing name resolution.

44:41.520 --> 44:44.400
Doesn't matter if you're at home, the coffee shop, you're at work.

44:44.400 --> 44:47.920
It's all the same IP, all protected by WireGuard.

44:47.920 --> 44:52.040
It's a mesh network that gets up and running in under two minutes and they've got so many

44:52.040 --> 44:55.280
great features that just take it to the next level that once you start using those different

44:55.280 --> 45:00.200
things like subnet routing or like I mentioned this Talescale send, like these tools you

45:00.200 --> 45:03.360
start combining them and it really improves your workflow.

45:03.360 --> 45:07.760
It makes it possible to get access to files and services regardless of where you're at

45:07.760 --> 45:11.440
without ever having to open up a firewall port.

45:11.440 --> 45:15.960
I've closed all my firewall ports, no more inbound traffic from the internet.

45:15.960 --> 45:16.960
That's great.

45:16.960 --> 45:20.280
So go see for yourself, go see why I love it so much, why everybody here at JB uses

45:20.280 --> 45:26.240
it and try it for free for up to 20 devices at talescale.com slash coder.

45:26.240 --> 45:32.000
One more time to support the show you go to talescale.com slash coder.

45:32.000 --> 45:37.880
You know the reason why I've been wanting to talk about this with you is because I think

45:37.880 --> 45:44.920
one undeniable kind of interesting retrospective aspect of this show is we have stumbled into

45:44.920 --> 45:51.280
documenting really interesting trends, Apple's pivot to services, Microsoft's pivot to embracing

45:51.280 --> 45:54.920
open source, buying GitHub, like that whole trajectory where they went.

45:54.920 --> 46:00.360
Our show has covered the span of Microsoft hates Linux to Microsoft loves Linux and now

46:00.360 --> 46:03.240
they're, you know, now we know where they're at.

46:03.240 --> 46:07.080
Like we've covered a lot of interesting trends, Docker obviously we'd love to mention.

46:07.080 --> 46:12.560
And I think the one that we're stumbling into now only because we're older and we've seen

46:12.560 --> 46:15.440
a few things now, we kind of see it coming.

46:15.440 --> 46:20.940
I think we're watching a reshaping of our tech industry, a reshaping of the very industry

46:20.940 --> 46:26.240
that you and I have watched develop over the last decade while the money printer go burr.

46:26.240 --> 46:29.800
We're watching it now rebuild itself.

46:29.800 --> 46:32.640
And the question at this point is, is how far does it go?

46:32.640 --> 46:33.640
Is it surface level?

46:33.640 --> 46:35.880
Does it end up being more structural?

46:35.880 --> 46:37.400
Time will tell.

46:37.400 --> 46:41.140
And I suspect the real action actually happens next year.

46:41.140 --> 46:46.560
But I think people that listen to this show are going to have hopefully a better understanding

46:46.560 --> 46:48.760
of what's going on in real time.

46:48.760 --> 46:51.040
And the great thing about this show is it's two way street.

46:51.040 --> 46:55.480
People send in emails and boosts and we start the conversation and I think we actually inevitably

46:55.480 --> 46:59.040
work out what's really going on well before most people get there.

46:59.040 --> 47:03.480
And it's been a really fascinating thing to kind of watch over the years of this show.

47:03.480 --> 47:08.200
And another one of these things that I am convinced is happening, I'm kind of here for

47:08.200 --> 47:14.240
it, but it's absolutely happening, is it is open Zuck hunting season.

47:14.240 --> 47:18.400
I was sitting on the couch last night after Linux Unplugged with Wes.

47:18.400 --> 47:22.460
And I was just telling Wes, I was like, Wes, like every Sunday I see these pieces come

47:22.460 --> 47:27.200
out from Fortune, Business Insider and Wall Street Journal and they're always like these

47:27.200 --> 47:30.360
hit pieces on Zuckerberg and Meta.

47:30.360 --> 47:34.200
Sometimes they're good and juicy and sometimes they're really just weak sauce, but man they

47:34.200 --> 47:35.200
crank them out.

47:35.200 --> 47:37.780
One of them at least cranks them out on the regular.

47:37.780 --> 47:44.320
And I refreshed my feeds literally as I was saying that, and I saw a couple of these land.

47:44.320 --> 47:45.320
That's incredible.

47:45.320 --> 47:46.920
I have links in the show notes.

47:46.920 --> 47:51.340
One is quote, this is the headline quote, Mark Zuckerberg's 10 billion plan to make

47:51.340 --> 47:57.760
it impossible for remote workers to hide from bosses, done, done, done.

47:57.760 --> 48:01.360
You know what it really comes down to is, well, if you're in the metaverse, they'll

48:01.360 --> 48:05.480
know when you're logged in and we don't even know what the physical implications are of

48:05.480 --> 48:08.040
being in the metaverse all day, so that could be bad.

48:08.040 --> 48:09.040
That's like the root.

48:09.040 --> 48:11.640
Dammit, Zuck, 1984 wasn't a how-to guide.

48:11.640 --> 48:12.640
Yeah, right.

48:12.640 --> 48:14.720
And then here's the other one that landed.

48:14.720 --> 48:17.720
Mark Zuckerberg should make Facebook, Facebook again.

48:17.720 --> 48:23.080
The Meta CEO should prioritize growing engagement and revenue on the company's core apps and

48:23.080 --> 48:25.480
drop this Meta crap.

48:25.480 --> 48:30.940
And then very quietly, The Wire published a retraction.

48:30.940 --> 48:36.480
They retracted two recent stories about Meta's x-check program and says that it's using quote

48:36.480 --> 48:41.240
independent external experts to investigate its coverage overall.

48:41.240 --> 48:45.360
I think something's going on there and they've discovered a little insider bias.

48:45.360 --> 48:52.240
Now I'm no Mark Zuckerberg fan, but I definitely recognize a sustained media campaign when

48:52.240 --> 48:53.240
I see one.

48:53.240 --> 48:57.900
There is clearly just people just trying to take Mark and Meta down.

48:57.900 --> 49:03.440
It's always either about Mark Zuckerberg or how Meta is crap every single time.

49:03.440 --> 49:07.160
And I don't know, maybe it gets clicks or maybe there's just something else at play.

49:07.160 --> 49:08.160
What do you think?

49:08.160 --> 49:09.480
Is my is my bacon tasty?

49:09.480 --> 49:15.440
I think your bacon's tasty, but what kind of bacon I need before I, you know.

49:15.440 --> 49:19.080
Well, actually, Mark Zuckerberg hunted this bacon himself and he smoked.

49:19.080 --> 49:20.080
Oh, Jesus.

49:20.080 --> 49:21.080
That's right.

49:21.080 --> 49:22.080
Yeah.

49:22.080 --> 49:23.080
You know how he likes to hunt his own meat.

49:23.080 --> 49:25.920
He's a strange man.

49:25.920 --> 49:29.880
The problem is, as you were talking about the Zuck, I kept picturing the bad guy in

49:29.880 --> 49:33.920
Batman versus Superman, the kid who plays Lex Luthor.

49:33.920 --> 49:38.440
And I'm honestly, I think that's a better, you know, the Facebook movie than the actual

49:38.440 --> 49:39.880
the Facebook movie.

49:39.880 --> 49:42.760
It's kind of who he is, right?

49:42.760 --> 49:44.000
He's I don't know.

49:44.000 --> 49:46.600
It's I'm sure it's a caricature.

49:46.600 --> 49:51.640
But have you have you watched him like some of his earlier talks?

49:51.640 --> 49:53.480
Yeah, he's gotten better.

49:53.480 --> 49:54.480
He's been coached clearly.

49:54.480 --> 49:55.480
Oh, yeah.

49:55.480 --> 49:56.480
I was talking with who was it?

49:56.480 --> 49:57.480
Wasn't Kara Swisher.

49:57.480 --> 49:58.480
It was Lex Friedman.

49:58.480 --> 49:59.480
Lex Friedman.

49:59.480 --> 50:00.480
Thank you.

50:00.480 --> 50:01.480
Was was pretty good.

50:01.480 --> 50:06.080
But like, I wouldn't say he is Lex Luthor, but he's definitely Luthor curious, right?

50:06.080 --> 50:07.080
He's Luthor adjacent.

50:07.080 --> 50:10.960
The man comes out and says he wants to be like Octavius Caesar.

50:10.960 --> 50:13.000
That's that's just a big statement, right?

50:13.000 --> 50:16.960
That's just those whose history is not quite as nerdy as mine.

50:16.960 --> 50:19.840
That would be the Emperor Augustus.

50:19.840 --> 50:21.080
It's just a lot, right?

50:21.080 --> 50:22.680
It's I don't know.

50:22.680 --> 50:25.160
I mean, he's a rich guy.

50:25.160 --> 50:30.480
His company has done some ethically questionable stuff, we could say.

50:30.480 --> 50:36.480
And I do think like all these big companies are kind of evil in their own way, in that

50:36.480 --> 50:42.000
they are amoral constructs that are designed to extract as much labor and capital out of

50:42.000 --> 50:47.480
the world as possible while contributing as little as possible.

50:47.480 --> 50:49.920
But damn, they just need a better front man.

50:49.920 --> 50:53.240
Like, I don't know what to say.

50:53.240 --> 50:57.140
You can't convince me that like Apple is not evil.

50:57.140 --> 51:01.040
But Tim Cook like knows to be like, I love Alabama football and let's go help out some

51:01.040 --> 51:03.920
kids over here and whatever, right?

51:03.920 --> 51:07.640
Did you see the video of him at the Formula One racing waving the sign?

51:07.640 --> 51:08.640
No, I didn't.

51:08.640 --> 51:09.640
Oh, God.

51:09.640 --> 51:11.560
He could not look more disinterested.

51:11.560 --> 51:13.700
I think he was probably just nervous and focused.

51:13.700 --> 51:20.160
But with the sunglasses and his overall resting grump face, he just could not look more disinterested

51:20.160 --> 51:24.520
in waving the Finnish flag.

51:24.520 --> 51:25.520
You should find it.

51:25.520 --> 51:26.520
It's floating around on Twitter.

51:26.520 --> 51:27.520
I see.

51:27.520 --> 51:28.520
I don't watch racing.

51:28.520 --> 51:30.240
But yeah, I would definitely like to see that.

51:30.240 --> 51:35.200
It's like Satya Nadella, even better example.

51:35.200 --> 51:37.560
He seems like a genuinely nice guy.

51:37.560 --> 51:43.960
But his job is to maximize the amount of capital and labor Microsoft can extract and minimize

51:43.960 --> 51:46.060
the amount it contributes.

51:46.060 --> 51:51.760
That is why they all have this double Irish Dutch tax going on with these inversions,

51:51.760 --> 51:54.840
which by the way, no one's talking about now that we're potentially going to war.

51:54.840 --> 51:55.840
Just throwing that out there.

51:55.840 --> 51:56.840
Yeah.

51:56.840 --> 51:59.120
We what happened to all like that was really heating up there for a minute.

51:59.120 --> 52:00.120
Yeah.

52:00.120 --> 52:01.120
Elizabeth Warren was up in arms.

52:01.120 --> 52:02.120
You know, they were going to go now.

52:02.120 --> 52:03.120
Oh, no.

52:03.120 --> 52:06.720
The ridiculous tax structures of these companies are OK.

52:06.720 --> 52:07.860
Cool.

52:07.860 --> 52:09.400
Maybe suck should take more coaching.

52:09.400 --> 52:14.240
I can't convince me he's more evil than than most of the rest.

52:14.240 --> 52:15.720
I don't maybe he is right.

52:15.720 --> 52:16.720
I don't know.

52:16.720 --> 52:18.600
It's like on the tech CEO scale.

52:18.600 --> 52:22.440
I'm not sure on the CEOs of all of the world's companies.

52:22.440 --> 52:23.440
Definitely not.

52:23.440 --> 52:24.760
There's some nasty characters.

52:24.760 --> 52:28.960
Well, let's take a jaunt over to the fossil fuel industry and meet those gentlemen.

52:28.960 --> 52:29.960
Right.

52:29.960 --> 52:30.960
I don't know.

52:30.960 --> 52:34.240
Or the military industrial contracting complex, perhaps.

52:34.240 --> 52:37.920
I think they're great and they should hire me.

52:37.920 --> 52:38.920
Was that was that Mr. Cheney?

52:38.920 --> 52:39.920
Excellent.

52:39.920 --> 52:40.920
Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

52:40.920 --> 52:42.760
See, I didn't get shot.

52:42.760 --> 52:49.920
Asked not what your podcast can boost for you, but what you can boost for your podcast.

52:49.920 --> 52:52.640
Trev Dev boosted in with 2000 sats.

52:52.640 --> 52:53.640
All right.

52:53.640 --> 52:56.000
The uniform crap is just another expensive distraction.

52:56.000 --> 52:58.800
I have two drawers in the house, a shirt drawer and a bottom store.

52:58.800 --> 53:02.720
Buy whatever T-shirts or jeans that you like and worry less about the tomato sauce.

53:02.720 --> 53:03.720
Damn.

53:03.720 --> 53:06.520
Yeah, he's coming in hot there, I should say, really.

53:06.520 --> 53:09.480
I probably should have played coming in hot with the boost.

53:09.480 --> 53:10.760
Yeah, that's hot.

53:10.760 --> 53:18.000
I feel like it's a lot of upfront thought and figuring out, but then years of not having

53:18.000 --> 53:19.000
to think about it.

53:19.000 --> 53:20.000
You're paying your taxes early.

53:20.000 --> 53:21.080
Is that that's what you're saying?

53:21.080 --> 53:22.080
I kind of.

53:22.080 --> 53:23.080
Yeah.

53:23.080 --> 53:24.080
Yeah.

53:24.080 --> 53:26.720
It's like I'm buying a lifetime membership to like easy clothing, but I got to pay the

53:26.720 --> 53:28.140
fee upfront.

53:28.140 --> 53:32.000
That's kind of my thought, although we'll see, because I am worried that I get a uniform

53:32.000 --> 53:33.680
and then like I'm bored with it in a month.

53:33.680 --> 53:39.040
What happens if you get a uniform in like four years, one piece is discontinued?

53:39.040 --> 53:40.040
Yeah.

53:40.040 --> 53:41.960
I don't know, because that seems super possible.

53:41.960 --> 53:46.240
I've thought about do I like I mean, if I really liked it, I would probably every now

53:46.240 --> 53:49.880
and then try to buy a couple of extra just so I'd have.

53:49.880 --> 53:54.320
I mean, you know, and then I suppose if it if it if it ran out, I could always do a uniform

53:54.320 --> 53:55.320
update.

53:55.320 --> 53:56.320
Yeah, it seems like a lot of work, though.

53:56.320 --> 53:57.320
I mean, that's like a distro update.

53:57.320 --> 53:59.520
I'm not sure I won't even touch that.

53:59.520 --> 54:01.880
Anonymous pleb boosted in with a row of ducks.

54:01.880 --> 54:04.120
This old duck still got it.

54:04.120 --> 54:07.680
Two thousand two hundred and twenty two stats corporatism is doomed.

54:07.680 --> 54:10.760
Corporatism is innate to humans and critical for civilization.

54:10.760 --> 54:17.200
FYI, I'm using Bitcoin and lightning to send anonymous messages and tips right now.

54:17.200 --> 54:20.200
Anonymity with Bitcoin is possible with the right tools.

54:20.200 --> 54:22.880
Yeah, fair enough.

54:22.880 --> 54:23.880
Fair enough.

54:23.880 --> 54:28.920
I suppose there are ways you can also do coin joins and whatnot to hide your coins, but

54:28.920 --> 54:29.920
it's not perfect.

54:29.920 --> 54:32.720
I would be careful.

54:32.720 --> 54:36.640
Marcel boosted in with seventeen oh one enterprise sets.

54:36.640 --> 54:37.640
Make it so.

54:37.640 --> 54:42.440
In America, does the First Amendment protect you if you say you're a medical doctor or

54:42.440 --> 54:43.440
a financial adviser?

54:43.440 --> 54:46.360
If you're not, I'm actually curious.

54:46.360 --> 54:50.180
I didn't think of the freedom of speech angle, but I'm a Canadian and we don't have that

54:50.180 --> 54:51.240
per se.

54:51.240 --> 54:53.240
That's totally a thing in Canada.

54:53.240 --> 54:57.120
I have a master's in electrical engineering, but I'm not, quote, an engineer because I

54:57.120 --> 54:59.320
didn't do an exam and pay my fees.

54:59.320 --> 55:00.760
Well, how about that?

55:00.760 --> 55:04.280
So he has a master's in electrical engineering, but he's not considered an engineer.

55:04.280 --> 55:08.400
I think if you went around and said you're a doctor or a financial adviser, you might

55:08.400 --> 55:11.520
have the right to say that, but you also have the right to get your ass sued.

55:11.520 --> 55:12.520
Well, wouldn't it?

55:12.520 --> 55:14.640
Well, yeah, you might get your ass kicked, but wouldn't it be?

55:14.640 --> 55:16.880
I mean, we're not lawyers, right?

55:16.880 --> 55:20.720
But until you actually commit fraud, you're just a jackass.

55:20.720 --> 55:26.820
Like if every untrue statement that you heard was a crime, I encourage our Canadian listeners

55:26.820 --> 55:30.080
to come to a bar in the American South.

55:30.080 --> 55:31.800
They call them tall tales.

55:31.800 --> 55:32.800
They're just bull.

55:32.800 --> 55:33.800
Yeah.

55:33.800 --> 55:34.800
Yeah.

55:34.800 --> 55:35.800
Everybody be in jail.

55:35.800 --> 55:36.800
Yeah.

55:36.800 --> 55:39.200
Or if you think about like all the influencers who exaggerate their credentials on, you know,

55:39.200 --> 55:42.520
the social media sites, all of Instagram just gone.

55:42.520 --> 55:43.520
Yeah.

55:43.520 --> 55:44.520
Right.

55:44.520 --> 55:45.520
Yeah.

55:45.520 --> 55:46.520
Yeah.

55:46.520 --> 55:47.520
So you could say dumb stuff.

55:47.520 --> 55:51.840
Generally it's if you like rob somebody or attempt to commit fraud, you're, you're probably

55:51.840 --> 55:56.100
guilty of a crime again, not attorneys, but isn't that why that kid who threw that stupid

55:56.100 --> 55:57.100
party got in trouble?

55:57.100 --> 56:00.740
I forgot his name, but you can like pretend to be this rich party planner.

56:00.740 --> 56:05.520
It's when you actually take people's money that you've, the guy who got them all, FEMA

56:05.520 --> 56:09.040
had to go help the rappers and the hip hop folks, remember?

56:09.040 --> 56:11.560
Oh, not the fire island thing.

56:11.560 --> 56:12.560
Are you thinking?

56:12.560 --> 56:13.560
Yeah.

56:13.560 --> 56:14.560
It was something.

56:14.560 --> 56:15.560
Yeah.

56:15.560 --> 56:16.560
Fire.

56:16.560 --> 56:17.560
It was fire festival or something.

56:17.560 --> 56:18.560
Fire festival.

56:18.560 --> 56:19.560
That was it.

56:19.560 --> 56:20.560
Yeah.

56:20.560 --> 56:21.560
Okay.

56:21.560 --> 56:22.560
Yep.

56:22.560 --> 56:23.560
All right.

56:23.560 --> 56:24.560
Right.

56:24.560 --> 56:25.560
The crime wasn't his Instagram feed and he was lying the whole time.

56:25.560 --> 56:26.560
The crime was that he actually took their money.

56:26.560 --> 56:27.560
It's an interesting point that there's a bit, there is quite a distinction there between

56:27.560 --> 56:28.560
Canadians and the States as well.

56:28.560 --> 56:32.400
Which also, I got to say, I think triggered Optimus Grey last week.

56:32.400 --> 56:34.400
He came in with 2048 sats.

56:34.400 --> 56:35.400
B-O-O-S-T.

56:35.400 --> 56:36.960
Mike, I was triggered.

56:36.960 --> 56:39.240
Canada, Mexico, Brazil are in America.

56:39.240 --> 56:41.440
What you call America is the USA.

56:41.440 --> 56:42.960
The United States of America.

56:42.960 --> 56:43.960
Oh God.

56:43.960 --> 56:47.840
We do use America in place of USA here, but Canadians are also Americans.

56:47.840 --> 56:50.000
Canadians are not United States citizens though.

56:50.000 --> 56:51.480
Sorry, I had to.

56:51.480 --> 56:53.200
I just got triggered.

56:53.200 --> 57:00.280
You know, I had this from family up in Canada when I referred to the States as America.

57:00.280 --> 57:05.640
I got pulled aside and I got a talking to like, you need to understand something.

57:05.640 --> 57:06.880
This is all America.

57:06.880 --> 57:08.760
The continent is America.

57:08.760 --> 57:11.520
And they are very annoyed by this.

57:11.520 --> 57:14.200
This is something that they take quite seriously.

57:14.200 --> 57:15.200
And you know what?

57:15.200 --> 57:16.200
That's fair.

57:16.200 --> 57:19.960
I just wonder is Optimus, is he a sneaky hidden Canadian?

57:19.960 --> 57:22.080
I'm not sure why he got upset.

57:22.080 --> 57:24.400
Enjoying his Tim Hortons and not sharing it.

57:24.400 --> 57:25.400
Yes.

57:25.400 --> 57:26.400
I wonder.

57:26.400 --> 57:27.400
All right.

57:27.400 --> 57:28.960
We're going to round out our last couple of boosts.

57:28.960 --> 57:31.320
This one is also a row of ducks.

57:31.320 --> 57:33.800
Things are looking up for old duck.

57:33.800 --> 57:36.260
This row of ducks came in from Purple Dog.

57:36.260 --> 57:37.680
My car is eight years old.

57:37.680 --> 57:40.220
My phone gets updates three to five years at best.

57:40.220 --> 57:44.320
I just want open standards in any device that can implement it.

57:44.320 --> 57:50.160
So this is something I wonder if there's going to become a DIY community around electric

57:50.160 --> 57:51.160
cars.

57:51.160 --> 57:52.160
I don't know if you see it.

57:52.160 --> 57:53.880
There's YouTube channels that build their own electric cars.

57:53.880 --> 57:59.920
But electric cars are a lot less complicated than a gas or a diesel vehicle.

57:59.920 --> 58:04.360
You know, you can get a couple of electric motors, a battery pack, they can be platforms

58:04.360 --> 58:06.480
that get sold as kits.

58:06.480 --> 58:13.340
It really feels like cars are turning into the next geeky tech landscape.

58:13.340 --> 58:19.000
My buddy Alex on Self Hosted bought this equipment that he hooks up to the ODB two port on his

58:19.000 --> 58:20.400
golf.

58:20.400 --> 58:25.680
And now he can adjust things like the noise and sounds that his exhaust makes.

58:25.680 --> 58:31.120
He can tweak things, he was able to get astronomical increase in horsepower just by adjusting things

58:31.120 --> 58:32.120
in software.

58:32.120 --> 58:34.740
And then you eventually need to replace components to accommodate for it.

58:34.740 --> 58:41.640
But all of it is just tunable as different software profiles because the platform that

58:41.640 --> 58:48.240
that Golf R is built on is also used in Audis and they have that same engine in a van and

58:48.240 --> 58:50.480
they have that same engine in a Passat.

58:50.480 --> 58:53.480
And they just use it in these different vehicles.

58:53.480 --> 58:56.760
They swap out some of the components, maybe some things are a little more robust than

58:56.760 --> 58:59.960
other parts, and they put a different software stack on there.

58:59.960 --> 59:05.000
And he got that software stack and he put it on his Golf R and he got a huge increase

59:05.000 --> 59:06.560
in horsepower.

59:06.560 --> 59:08.920
And it's just, you know, it's a tinkerer's thing.

59:08.920 --> 59:12.520
It's a whole community around tinkering and messing with this stuff.

59:12.520 --> 59:13.520
I find that interesting.

59:13.520 --> 59:15.320
Yeah, I think that could happen, right?

59:15.320 --> 59:18.680
There's always been a kind of a car enthusiast community, so why not?

59:18.680 --> 59:19.680
I like it.

59:19.680 --> 59:20.680
Yeah.

59:20.680 --> 59:21.680
I hope it sticks.

59:21.680 --> 59:22.680
Neve Boostin with 2008Sats.

59:22.680 --> 59:23.680
BOOST!

59:23.680 --> 59:31.080
In 2008, did you know that the number three search term on Google was, what is Java, behind

59:31.080 --> 59:34.360
financial crisis and then who is Obama?

59:34.360 --> 59:37.320
Oh, how far the world has come.

59:37.320 --> 59:43.520
Always Mike as a guy's, uh, eos, eos, what's eos, is that a magic thing?

59:43.520 --> 59:44.520
Oh God.

59:44.520 --> 59:51.280
Is this e h o s as a guy, he was, no, maybe it just means that as a guy, your ethos has

59:51.280 --> 59:53.200
fallen in love with common Lisp and Lua.

59:53.200 --> 59:54.200
Oh no.

59:54.200 --> 59:55.200
Oh my God.

59:55.200 --> 59:58.200
Neve says he has a dedicated Emacs machine.

59:58.200 --> 59:59.680
Could you think about that?

59:59.680 --> 01:00:04.580
A computer in your room that only runs Emacs.

01:00:04.580 --> 01:00:06.120
Is this a thing people are doing?

01:00:06.120 --> 01:00:11.520
Does anybody else out there have a computer that only does one thing and is it a full

01:00:11.520 --> 01:00:12.520
computer?

01:00:12.520 --> 01:00:14.800
I don't know about you and Emacs people, how they're running Emacs.

01:00:14.800 --> 01:00:15.800
No, no.

01:00:15.800 --> 01:00:19.200
I'm wondering, like, do some people have like a machine that does something else, like a

01:00:19.200 --> 01:00:22.000
dedicated computer that just runs a single application?

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:23.000
Oh yeah, dude.

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:26.080
What about all the, all the, uh, all the Plex people, right?

01:00:26.080 --> 01:00:27.080
Yeah.

01:00:27.080 --> 01:00:30.280
Well maybe a media server or something, but I'm talking like a PC or something.

01:00:30.280 --> 01:00:34.320
Maybe it, I mean, maybe Neve's doing a tablet, but I'm just trying to picture like a desktop

01:00:34.320 --> 01:00:40.560
PC with a mouse and a keyboard and a screen, a tower PC that's just running all the time,

01:00:40.560 --> 01:00:42.020
but nothing but Emacs.

01:00:42.020 --> 01:00:44.040
You can live in Emacs.

01:00:44.040 --> 01:00:47.480
I'm just, Neve is blowing my mind.

01:00:47.480 --> 01:00:49.160
Also yes, we're out your neck beard.

01:00:49.160 --> 01:00:50.160
Yeah, absolutely.

01:00:50.160 --> 01:00:51.160
Yeah.

01:00:51.160 --> 01:00:52.160
Yeah.

01:00:52.160 --> 01:00:53.160
Just thank you.

01:00:53.160 --> 01:00:55.400
We got 20,000 SATs from Mitch.

01:00:55.400 --> 01:00:57.680
That's the developer of the Podverse app.

01:00:57.680 --> 01:01:03.640
Podverse is an open source GPL podcasting 2.0 compatible app for Android, Mac, Linux,

01:01:03.640 --> 01:01:04.640
iOS.

01:01:04.640 --> 01:01:09.440
Well, I say Mac, I meant iOS and the web.

01:01:09.440 --> 01:01:10.440
Try it out.

01:01:10.440 --> 01:01:11.440
It's great.

01:01:11.440 --> 01:01:16.440
We got 48 SATs from R30s and thank you everybody else who boosted in or streamed in.

01:01:16.440 --> 01:01:17.540
We didn't make it on the show.

01:01:17.540 --> 01:01:21.640
We do just select some of them, but we read all of them and I'm working eventually.

01:01:21.640 --> 01:01:26.400
We have a couple of projects in the pipeline, but we will eventually probably pipe in the

01:01:26.400 --> 01:01:30.360
boost for Coder like into a Slack channel or something so they're even easier for everybody

01:01:30.360 --> 01:01:31.360
to see.

01:01:31.360 --> 01:01:32.360
But we'll work on that.

01:01:32.360 --> 01:01:33.360
It's actually pretty awesome.

01:01:33.360 --> 01:01:35.660
Dave Jones is a master.

01:01:35.660 --> 01:01:36.880
I love the system he built.

01:01:36.880 --> 01:01:41.840
Like I don't know if he intended to build the perfect system for us, but he created

01:01:41.840 --> 01:01:48.640
like a rust back end for these boosts that get stored in a database and there's an API.

01:01:48.640 --> 01:01:50.280
It's really quite choice.

01:01:50.280 --> 01:01:56.320
So we're going to leverage that to send the boosts programmatically to different team members

01:01:56.320 --> 01:01:59.700
based on like what show they participate in and all that kind of stuff.

01:01:59.700 --> 01:02:02.000
It's coming one day down the road.

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:07.380
We're also working on a special members channel for our Coder QA team.

01:02:07.380 --> 01:02:11.620
So they'll have a way to send in special messages and we're working on, although this is all

01:02:11.620 --> 01:02:12.620
really early.

01:02:12.620 --> 01:02:15.400
So you're going to hear me talk about this stuff for a while, but we're working on ways

01:02:15.400 --> 01:02:20.760
to upgrade the member feeds with new podcasting 2.0 features as well.

01:02:20.760 --> 01:02:21.760
It's very exciting.

01:02:21.760 --> 01:02:22.760
It's a lot of work.

01:02:22.760 --> 01:02:26.180
It's some big changes for us, but it's all in the pipeline.

01:02:26.180 --> 01:02:30.680
So you can become a member at coderqa.co you'll get the Coderly report when we record it soon.

01:02:30.680 --> 01:02:34.160
It'll be, it'll be slightly delayed this quarter, but we will get it out to you.

01:02:34.160 --> 01:02:37.200
I've been trying to brainstorm on a topic too.

01:02:37.200 --> 01:02:41.200
So I'll chat with you about that offline so I got an idea, but Mr. Dominic, is there anywhere

01:02:41.200 --> 01:02:42.680
you want to send the people this week?

01:02:42.680 --> 01:02:50.400
I'm at Twitter at Domenico and go to alice.dev if you need any automation or data conversion

01:02:50.400 --> 01:02:51.400
goodness.

01:02:51.400 --> 01:02:52.400
Absolutely.

01:02:52.400 --> 01:02:53.600
You can join the show live.

01:02:53.600 --> 01:02:58.600
We do it on Mondays at 9 a.m. Pacific noon Eastern over at Jupiter.tube.

01:02:58.600 --> 01:03:02.840
Thanks to what we talked about today or coder.show slash four eight nine, you'll find our feed

01:03:02.840 --> 01:03:03.840
over there.

01:03:03.840 --> 01:03:04.840
That's also our contact page.

01:03:04.840 --> 01:03:07.960
If you want to send an email into the show, we do appreciate and read all of those as

01:03:07.960 --> 01:03:08.960
well.

01:03:08.960 --> 01:03:14.240
And then last but not least, I suppose you could follow the show on the Twitter or something.

01:03:14.240 --> 01:03:15.240
I don't know.

01:03:15.240 --> 01:03:19.120
You could, then, you know, when it's out at Coda radio show, what I would do is I just

01:03:19.120 --> 01:03:22.600
subscribe in a podcast app, then you don't need to follow us on Twitter and you still

01:03:22.600 --> 01:03:23.960
know when it's out.

01:03:23.960 --> 01:03:26.320
That's I'm a podcast pro.

01:03:26.320 --> 01:03:27.320
So that's a pro tip.

01:03:27.320 --> 01:03:28.320
All right, everyone.

01:03:28.320 --> 01:03:31.640
Thank you so much for joining us on this week's episode of the Coda radio program.

01:03:31.640 --> 01:03:58.720
And we'll see you right back here next week.
