00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
This is Koto Radio, episode 344 for February 11th, 2019.

00:30.000 --> 00:33.560
Welcome to Koto Radio, Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show, taking a

00:33.560 --> 00:38.200
pragmatic look at the art and the business of software development and its

00:38.200 --> 00:44.960
related technologies. My name is Chris in the rainy, cold Texas area and joining us

00:44.960 --> 00:50.700
every single week is our host in Florida, the man who navigates the swamps to be

00:50.700 --> 00:56.680
here every single week is Mr. Dominic. Hello Mike. Misa here once again. Oh good,

00:56.680 --> 01:01.120
good. But to make sure we offset all the jar jar, we have been joined by the third

01:01.120 --> 01:08.320
pole of our stool and that is the one, the only, Wes Payne. Hello Wes. Hello and

01:08.320 --> 01:12.440
don't worry I've got a lightsaber to deal with that jar jar problem. What do

01:12.440 --> 01:15.160
you think of being the third leg of the stool, right? Because our stool doesn't

01:15.160 --> 01:18.920
hold up properly without that third leg. I will say sometimes you guys are swaying

01:18.920 --> 01:23.280
a little bit to and fro but sometimes that's fun. I don't know what

01:23.280 --> 01:27.620
that could be caused by. It's good to be back. We wanted to try a

01:27.620 --> 01:31.560
little three-way for one episode. We're just trying things out. Wes you have been

01:31.560 --> 01:35.280
doing a killer job sitting in. Everybody writes in just says how much they hate

01:35.280 --> 01:38.960
it. They're constantly going on about how awful of a job you do. That's how you

01:38.960 --> 01:43.760
know you do something right, right? Everybody loves it. Everybody loves it

01:43.760 --> 01:47.460
and we got some good feedback into the show so let's start out there. Email

01:47.460 --> 01:51.320
comes in from Steve and it's about employment versus self-employment and

01:51.320 --> 01:55.240
I'm sensing a theme here. He says I just have a comment regarding an episode a

01:55.240 --> 01:59.440
few weeks back regarding being employee or working for oneself. There are

01:59.440 --> 02:02.920
definitive benefits if you find the right employer and it looks like Linux

02:02.920 --> 02:07.440
Academy is one for Chris. I decided to do what Chris did, accept employment. After

02:07.440 --> 02:12.200
all I was struggling as a self-employed individual but this new employer started

02:12.200 --> 02:17.080
to change my hours working till 7 or 9 p.m. and they also started to have me do

02:17.080 --> 02:22.360
work that I was not hired to do but I continued forward since I appreciated

02:22.360 --> 02:26.800
having a regular paycheck. But one morning we received a company-wide

02:26.800 --> 02:31.320
notice. Our employer was concerned about how often people went to the bathroom.

02:31.320 --> 02:36.560
Shortly after that we had to start asking permission to take a break, eat

02:36.560 --> 02:41.880
lunch and so on. I finally had to give my resignation notice. I guess like a

02:41.880 --> 02:47.560
marriage the challenge is finding the right mate or employer. Steve that's a

02:47.560 --> 02:52.520
great email and so on the panel here Mike you're the self-employed one what

02:52.520 --> 02:57.480
are your thoughts on this? So I have never heard of such a crazy like you

02:57.480 --> 03:03.280
can sort of situation crazy that's that's pretty terrible I don't have a

03:03.280 --> 03:06.200
lot of experience with the whole I get a paycheck every two weeks thing because I

03:06.200 --> 03:13.480
was self-employed very young but I you know you know Chris tax and in West tax

03:13.480 --> 03:17.760
seasons coming up and it's one of those it's that time of year when I start to

03:17.760 --> 03:23.640
think what the hell is wrong with me? It's true. So however someone told me I

03:23.640 --> 03:27.480
couldn't take a pee that would I can't even believe we're having this

03:27.480 --> 03:34.080
conversation like I know isn't that it's not technically torture like it seems

03:34.080 --> 03:39.760
like a huge waste of everyone's time that kind of micromanagement. That's like a

03:39.760 --> 03:43.040
full-time job just approving potty breaks. I mean Chris come on you're a

03:43.040 --> 03:46.920
big shot VP at a big Linux company now. It's true. If one of your employees got

03:46.920 --> 03:49.840
up from his desk was like or your reports got up from his desk to the

03:49.840 --> 03:54.560
men's room or the ladies room you wouldn't you know track that right like

03:54.560 --> 03:58.000
that seems. Well I mean as Wes knows I did ask him to install that camera there

03:58.000 --> 04:01.680
in his bathroom so we could just keep track of things. Yeah but it's been there

04:01.680 --> 04:04.440
for months. Yeah I mean we just need baseline metrics Mike that's all just

04:04.440 --> 04:08.120
baselines. I thought that was part of our health initiative now. Well that's for

04:08.120 --> 04:13.800
that's why I have the analyzer in the urinal but that's for other reasons. You

04:13.800 --> 04:17.120
know I wanted to jump ahead in our in our show notes here and maybe this would

04:17.120 --> 04:20.040
be a good time to tackle this story about the psychological trap of

04:20.040 --> 04:24.600
freelancing. Not that I'm now I'm not like mr. anti freelance anti independent

04:24.600 --> 04:27.680
work I don't mean to come across that way. You're like a reformed alcoholic it's

04:27.680 --> 04:34.880
terrible. A little bit I mean I I guess I would say that I feel better about it

04:34.880 --> 04:39.120
now than I did at the time of the acquisition which I felt pretty good

04:39.120 --> 04:43.000
that's why I went along with it but now having been here for a bit I do feel

04:43.000 --> 04:48.840
better about it. There's um having having worked independently for about a decade

04:48.840 --> 04:54.400
the reach you get as being part of a larger company that has more resources

04:54.400 --> 05:01.880
is it says it's just at a whole other scale and I find myself having to really

05:01.880 --> 05:06.800
combat like small thinking like how do we do things super hyper crazy by the

05:06.800 --> 05:11.280
skin of our teeth cheap and how do we do something that a ten-person team does

05:11.280 --> 05:14.080
with a four-person team like I have to break all of that way of thinking a

05:14.080 --> 05:18.520
little bit because it limits what I can achieve and that's been a hard that's

05:18.520 --> 05:24.360
been a hard shift but I think there's a bigger mindset that I developed as an

05:24.360 --> 05:28.520
independent contractor or as a freelancer and I wonder if you suffer

05:28.520 --> 05:34.800
from this too Mike and it's this it's this unbelievable amount of value that

05:34.800 --> 05:38.200
you learn to attach to your time where now everything in life you're you're

05:38.200 --> 05:42.040
you're measuring against how much time is that going to take how much time does

05:42.040 --> 05:45.880
it take me to wash my car how much time does it take me to mow the lawn and that

05:45.880 --> 05:48.760
becomes like this sick way of thinking about things because it sucks all the

05:48.760 --> 05:52.960
joy out of life the audience doesn't know but you guys know I was just on a

05:52.960 --> 05:57.600
brief four-day trip up north mostly business but I of course my family's

05:57.600 --> 06:03.040
from there so I went to visit and we had a minor issue with a client project and

06:03.040 --> 06:11.040
I just went into this I don't even know what to say like you stay yeah it was it

06:11.040 --> 06:15.860
was it was more like when they Bruce Banner just freaks out and becomes the

06:15.860 --> 06:21.360
Hulk and I was like sorry kid can't play sorry which is a board game I'm sure

06:21.360 --> 06:25.320
most people are familiar with oh we all know sorry Mike yeah of course I have to

06:25.320 --> 06:32.080
you know rewrite this doku instance because reasons right and I realized

06:32.080 --> 06:37.400
something not only did it make no difference materially to TMB my my

06:37.400 --> 06:43.680
company the client didn't even notice the problem right there was no material

06:43.680 --> 06:48.040
difference between doing it on Saturday we're just letting it go until Monday

06:48.040 --> 06:53.480
but I've gone into this and I this is why when you sent me this article I was

06:53.480 --> 06:57.600
like damn and also I would love to after this jump back to the small thinking

06:57.600 --> 07:03.680
thing yeah it's it freelancing should be the in the DSM it's a form of sickness

07:03.680 --> 07:07.880
mm-hmm yeah there's actually been research that's what this article talks

07:07.880 --> 07:10.880
about we'll have linked in the show notes that explains the psychology

07:10.880 --> 07:15.200
behind this state of mind people who attach dollar signs to their time or

07:15.200 --> 07:20.200
value time like money tend to be overwhelmingly less happy than those who

07:20.200 --> 07:26.360
don't because they're non working hours suddenly seem less important quote-unquote

07:26.360 --> 07:31.160
free time gets tainted with guilt because there's a cost associated with

07:31.160 --> 07:40.000
it wow that's me that I am I have to I have to struggle to not have the

07:40.000 --> 07:44.920
weekends be hell because I feel like I am wasting so much time around the house

07:44.920 --> 07:49.440
if I'm not working and so much so that sometimes just to relieve my anxiety

07:49.440 --> 07:54.080
I'll carve out a couple hours on Saturday to work even though I work all

07:54.080 --> 07:58.760
day Sunday every week right six days a week on the exact opposite I work all

07:58.760 --> 08:02.960
day Saturday but then I'm always looking to see can I hustle you know a few hours

08:02.960 --> 08:07.320
like Sunday like after church or whatever and the thing is is that what

08:07.320 --> 08:11.720
this article points out curious your thoughts on this West is we're seeing a

08:11.720 --> 08:16.960
bigger shift in the economy where a lot of traditional salary jobs are going

08:16.960 --> 08:21.920
more towards contract gigs and more and more people are becoming independent

08:21.920 --> 08:28.080
contractors in a sense so it seems like this could become a larger issue yeah

08:28.080 --> 08:31.120
you're right I mean contractors into playing a pretty big role at a lot of

08:31.120 --> 08:34.880
organizations and there is sort of this thought that okay well if you can

08:34.880 --> 08:38.480
convert money to time and with the salary you've already negotiated you're

08:38.480 --> 08:41.760
kind of set until your next review period and you hope for a promotion and

08:41.760 --> 08:46.200
and with freelance maybe you think yeah I could I could just work more but it's

08:46.200 --> 08:49.280
already so difficult to actually carve out time for yourself and I think that

08:49.280 --> 08:52.880
affects salaried people too right you might want to be pushing to finish a big

08:52.880 --> 08:55.880
project and you might have the reverse problem I'm now guilting yourself about

08:55.880 --> 09:00.680
not actually taking any time off from work yeah yeah that's true salaried

09:00.680 --> 09:04.800
folks are not necessarily immune from this because now I mean it's crossed my

09:04.800 --> 09:07.520
mind once or twice but this is just how I work it's now it's like okay if I work

09:07.520 --> 09:10.960
six or seven days a week well it's not what I get paid for I get paid for five

09:10.960 --> 09:14.600
days a week but that's just the way my job works but you want it and you want

09:14.600 --> 09:18.320
to think about holistic outcomes right because we're not just there to turn out

09:18.320 --> 09:22.200
parts on a factory line yeah you're trying to make real things yeah yeah and

09:22.200 --> 09:26.320
it's a it's a process for what we make and it just takes time so the question

09:26.320 --> 09:30.800
is like what do you do if you get trapped in this mindset and I've managed

09:30.800 --> 09:34.120
to pull this trick on myself a couple of times but their research shows it

09:34.120 --> 09:38.000
actually is really something you can do and that is if we tell ourselves that

09:38.000 --> 09:42.720
leisure time is another means to achieve the goal or financial outcomes we're

09:42.720 --> 09:46.560
striving for that can make us more likely to take the breaks that we need

09:46.560 --> 09:51.400
and maybe even enjoy them more and be happier in general so you can if you can

09:51.400 --> 09:56.280
convince yourself that there is a sense in a sense a monetary value or a brain

09:56.280 --> 10:00.480
downtime value that makes you more productive ultimately if you can buy

10:00.480 --> 10:04.360
into that which I believe is true then it makes a little bit easier to enjoy

10:04.360 --> 10:08.160
your downtime it's a it's a process though it's like Mike was saying it's

10:08.160 --> 10:10.480
something you always struggle with but you wanted to circle back to the small

10:10.480 --> 10:15.400
versus big thinking Mike yes so I would love to learn more about how your

10:15.400 --> 10:21.920
thinking has changed because I had some very long conversations when I was up in

10:21.920 --> 10:26.520
New Jersey for my business regarding things we can do things our competitors

10:26.520 --> 10:31.520
are doing and you know the reality of being super small and severely

10:31.520 --> 10:38.200
financially constrained mm-hmm yeah so I think the biggest difference is in

10:38.200 --> 10:42.240
hiring potential you know we're we're kicking around the show ideas like how

10:42.240 --> 10:45.640
could we pull that off and then it takes like ten minutes of the conversation

10:45.640 --> 10:49.600
before we go well I guess we could hire somebody to do that and like that's a

10:49.600 --> 10:54.480
big mentality shift for us because having the resources to hire people at a

10:54.480 --> 11:00.320
decent income with benefits and all of that was just not even something that

11:00.320 --> 11:03.720
was possible for us but I'll tell you this like that the scale is is pretty

11:03.720 --> 11:07.800
different really because I think I've told you this before it I think they

11:07.800 --> 11:13.960
spend more easily easily in beverages and and lunches then we probably had as

11:13.960 --> 11:17.400
an entire budget for Jupiter broadcasting and that's just there you

11:17.400 --> 11:23.720
know Linux Academy is the largest online cloud training platform and there's they

11:23.720 --> 11:26.840
are an institution now they have like 120 something hundred and twenty five

11:26.840 --> 11:30.080
people working here now and so they're just at a totally different scale and

11:30.080 --> 11:35.080
it's meant the biggest problem that we've run into is how do we do things at

11:35.080 --> 11:39.360
a larger scale that make a difference and that are worth doing how do we do

11:39.360 --> 11:43.040
something that maybe attracts a million people instead of five hundred thousand

11:43.040 --> 11:47.320
people those kinds of things in it it's it's a little outside of my reach right

11:47.320 --> 11:53.240
now because it's not an area I spent so much time so long in the trenches

11:53.240 --> 11:57.760
getting by with if I spend money on something that means it's an area I

11:57.760 --> 12:02.720
don't spend money in in another place and it may even mean it could ruin us if

12:02.720 --> 12:05.560
it doesn't go well like there's all these decisions that had to be made let

12:05.560 --> 12:09.000
alone even being able to hire people that I spent so much time in that mindset

12:09.000 --> 12:14.200
that I have to I have to constantly catch myself and what I've been doing is

12:14.200 --> 12:20.360
been looking at setting really large goals that try to make us re

12:20.360 --> 12:24.920
adjust the lens in which we're looking at the problem so we we readdress the

12:24.920 --> 12:28.840
problem in a new way of thinking right has to become the default position think

12:28.840 --> 12:32.320
right about it instead of focusing on the small day-to-day stuff yeah yeah

12:32.320 --> 12:34.840
West knows my struggles pretty well because it's something we talk a lot

12:34.840 --> 12:38.360
about in our in our meetings you know we have we have ketchup meetings and

12:38.360 --> 12:41.200
department meetings and stuff and we're trying to we're just still trying to as

12:41.200 --> 12:46.080
a group trying to hammer this stuff out it's a it's a there are advantages to

12:46.080 --> 12:51.440
being lean and small especially in efficiency in direction changing you

12:51.440 --> 12:54.680
know this isn't working let's move being able to go with your instinct those

12:54.680 --> 13:02.960
things are your strengths when you're small but customer support and internal

13:02.960 --> 13:09.600
feature development and expansion and and growing and growing new shows just

13:09.600 --> 13:13.640
are much more possible when you have a larger budget an example of that would

13:13.640 --> 13:16.920
be the choose Linux show that we recently launched it just wasn't

13:16.920 --> 13:22.240
possible before to have to have the time and the resources to pay an editor and

13:22.240 --> 13:26.000
pay hosts and all that stuff it just we were maxed out without taking on

13:26.000 --> 13:29.960
substantially more advertisers and so it took a different business model really I

13:29.960 --> 13:35.480
think for us to change the game because the business we were in before was

13:35.480 --> 13:40.440
advertising based podcasts of a niche market and now the business we're in is

13:40.440 --> 13:45.320
a much larger online training business which just has a larger customer base

13:45.320 --> 13:49.920
for one thing so I think part of it Mike is is mentality and part of it is just

13:49.920 --> 13:53.480
the core business that we were in versus what we're in now our my job hasn't

13:53.480 --> 13:59.520
changed much but the company I'm part of has interesting yeah yeah I'm sure

13:59.520 --> 14:03.160
another piece of it is obviously capitalization right bigger company yeah

14:03.160 --> 14:07.120
everything's just slightly larger or slightly yeah significantly larger do

14:07.120 --> 14:11.480
you find that you're running up against limitations of the size of bad water

14:11.480 --> 14:18.800
well I mean we had a little R&D project go south very recently so we run into

14:18.800 --> 14:22.360
the problem of we have lots of interesting ideas on things we can do

14:22.360 --> 14:29.240
and very little capital with which to do them right sure so we have to pick one

14:29.240 --> 14:35.280
and if it doesn't work out that hobbles us for at least a quarter and that

14:35.280 --> 14:39.360
doesn't even start to get into any potential like you know we do this for a

14:39.360 --> 14:42.000
long time right I've had all kinds of crazy things like consulting client

14:42.000 --> 14:47.560
files bankruptcy right you can't get paid like there's all all kind you know a

14:47.560 --> 14:50.400
dispute client feels like something's not done but there's all kinds of things

14:50.400 --> 14:55.360
that have happened over the years but the most painful one is actually when

14:55.360 --> 15:00.680
you know we sit down we look at like we do this every year we sit down we look

15:00.680 --> 15:04.520
at the year ahead we always have this fantasy of going towards a more

15:04.520 --> 15:11.640
productized business and we see you know let's say five opportunities we pick one

15:11.640 --> 15:19.480
try to work it out for you know a month or two and we realize we just don't have

15:19.480 --> 15:25.240
the other the financial strength or the you know in some cases marketing know-how

15:25.240 --> 15:30.320
to actually do it which becomes pretty you know there can be other means right

15:30.320 --> 15:36.360
we didn't sometimes when things require hardware that can be tough yeah we

15:36.360 --> 15:40.880
definitely feel it I mean I tend to think of things in terms of like revenue

15:40.880 --> 15:45.120
against investment or investment against revenue and our biggest problem is

15:45.120 --> 15:49.760
really we should pick a couple of these and try them out but we always every

15:49.760 --> 15:56.800
year we have to pick one or two some do some don't and that's pretty it's a

15:56.800 --> 16:00.200
pretty risky hand right it's like going to Atlantic City and just betting it all

16:00.200 --> 16:08.640
on double zero and roulette yeah only if you don't win it's it's it's your job

16:08.640 --> 16:13.200
plus everybody else working with you and repercussions are severe mm-hmm

16:13.200 --> 16:17.760
probably tied into this too is how much identity especially in America we tend

16:17.760 --> 16:20.960
to associate with our career so it's not even like that you just you know oh you

16:20.960 --> 16:23.960
start a business and it didn't work out unless you had you just move on right

16:23.960 --> 16:29.040
that was that was a lot of your life and thoughts and investments yeah yeah

16:29.040 --> 16:34.200
really yeah I agree one way to always measure success is in number of laptops

16:34.200 --> 16:42.360
and it seems that listener Emma that's what I'm calling her now because I'm

16:42.360 --> 16:47.800
sure she listens she has some feedback for average system 76 customers not even

16:47.800 --> 16:52.680
for Mike specifically Emma tweets out today Emma who is in charge of support

16:52.680 --> 16:58.320
over at system 76 she's the happiness manager to put it technically and so

16:58.320 --> 17:03.840
today is clean out your computer day hashtag keep your laptop fans of clear

17:03.840 --> 17:09.320
of dust and debris and so system 76 asks what's your best computer cleaning tip

17:09.320 --> 17:15.080
which Emma responds to the system 76 account to keep at Domenico away from

17:15.080 --> 17:20.720
and make sure all beverages are in a separate room you're getting sick burned

17:20.720 --> 17:27.120
by the system 76 staff in public now you realize that you know this is a this is

17:27.120 --> 17:35.480
a gross gross misrepresentation I have never destroyed more than seven laptops

17:35.480 --> 17:41.720
in the year yeah and a good portion of the more MacBooks to be fair you know

17:41.720 --> 17:47.640
what and and honestly they wanted to go it was that's true that's true that's

17:47.640 --> 17:50.960
true I mean there's part of the up it's part of the Mike's built-in

17:50.960 --> 17:55.680
obsolescence obsolescence program right exactly Apple wishes I could destroy

17:55.680 --> 17:58.800
more MacBooks for people just like kind of walk around oh there you go there you

17:58.800 --> 18:02.400
go West Payne's kind of like the I'm somewhere in the middle right I don't I

18:02.400 --> 18:04.800
don't go through his machines as fast as you do but I think I go through a

18:04.800 --> 18:09.640
pretty high clip but West Payne you were rocking like one of the original

18:09.640 --> 18:15.240
original XPS is for six or seven years or something yeah that's right is it

18:15.240 --> 18:22.760
was it that long it did feel like 12 years yeah it's like that DS9 episode

18:22.760 --> 18:26.880
with the O'Brien and he's in prison in his mind it was like that but with a

18:26.880 --> 18:31.200
laptop I think it's just mostly like especially if I'm doing more development

18:31.200 --> 18:36.000
stuff I I don't need very much you know like an electron app here or there a

18:36.000 --> 18:40.560
chrome a chrome session and a terminal yeah now you know doing more doing more

18:40.560 --> 18:46.320
stuff with with content creation it is nice to have a beefier Rick mm-hmm yeah

18:46.320 --> 18:49.800
I think the one thing I the one somebody just tweeted me recently said hey do you

18:49.800 --> 18:53.920
guys still like your Lenovo t480 oh yeah right and I said yes although I think at

18:53.920 --> 18:57.960
this point I might be inclined to go high DPI however we do rely on a couple of

18:57.960 --> 19:01.800
applications that don't have high DPI support so I don't know but that would

19:01.800 --> 19:05.000
be the one thing I might change about the t480 as soon as I've got one of those

19:05.000 --> 19:08.760
kernels and and maybe we do already but with the the recent changes so that

19:08.760 --> 19:12.840
there's better high DPI support when you have to go log into an actual terminal

19:12.840 --> 19:16.960
you know console on on your laptop when you have to fix something then I'll

19:16.960 --> 19:21.680
switch yeah all right okay so and that'll probably be about another ten

19:21.680 --> 19:30.860
machines or so yeah right I think so well Wes you found this great this great

19:30.860 --> 19:37.600
article on css tricks comm on what hooks mean for view and I wanted you to share

19:37.600 --> 19:41.800
what you found with the class today yeah okay well maybe we can start with like a

19:41.800 --> 19:46.720
little quiz Mike have you do you use view are you react where do you fall in

19:46.720 --> 19:51.640
the single page application framework camp I was originally in angular but

19:51.640 --> 19:56.240
when it was angular JS back in the day I have done some view I you know I don't

19:56.240 --> 20:00.440
have any current projects using any of these heavy frameworks the last one I

20:00.440 --> 20:06.320
did use was view though but it was it was the least of major version back hmm

20:06.320 --> 20:11.280
yeah okay well you know obviously in the in the JavaScript world everything has

20:11.280 --> 20:14.880
to change at a lightning pace yeah and this is this is no different so you

20:14.880 --> 20:19.240
might have seen some of the hubbub around hooks over in react so when I saw

20:19.240 --> 20:22.720
this about view adding hooks as well I thought that was an interesting sort of

20:22.720 --> 20:26.360
convergence of design and really I mean they talked about that right here in the

20:26.360 --> 20:30.560
article that it is sort of you know what you what you end up with is a crossover

20:30.560 --> 20:35.560
between react and view they use a lot of the same language the API is similar the

20:35.560 --> 20:38.240
benefits are slightly different and that's where it gets interesting so the

20:38.240 --> 20:43.640
idea of hooks it's a more functional way to do react and at its core I think

20:43.640 --> 20:47.480
react is a pretty functional idea it's really like you've got a render function

20:47.480 --> 20:51.320
and so you've got some state some data and then you've built this component

20:51.320 --> 20:54.800
that takes that data and then produces produces your view that gets rendered

20:54.800 --> 21:00.080
onto the page whatever that structure of divs and forms whatever you're building

21:00.080 --> 21:06.280
right now the most common JavaScript API for all those react internals is pretty

21:06.280 --> 21:09.760
at least somewhat object oriented there's a lot of classes involved you

21:09.760 --> 21:13.040
might have higher-order components where you're passing state through or nesting

21:13.040 --> 21:17.440
it or like a factory or something and it's just always felt at least to me

21:17.440 --> 21:22.120
sort of like an impedance mismatch now not everyone thinks that and there's you

21:22.120 --> 21:27.040
know so many users of that API but recently they added hooks and the basic

21:27.040 --> 21:31.160
idea is just do this all with functions so you've got your you know you've got

21:31.160 --> 21:34.680
your component and you have a hook and you basically say like I need a little

21:34.680 --> 21:38.560
piece of state give me some state and that's it you call the function you get

21:38.560 --> 21:42.200
your state and you can do this multiple times and then the react engine knows

21:42.200 --> 21:46.240
that once that state changes it needs to rerender whatever component you've just

21:46.240 --> 21:49.320
made that's how it gets to do all the fancy virtual dom diffing and all the

21:49.320 --> 21:54.080
performance benefits it also means like one of the general

21:54.080 --> 21:57.560
trends I think we've seen is trying to have more composition because we end up

21:57.560 --> 22:00.920
with these really complicated components with multiple levels that that you want

22:00.920 --> 22:03.360
to try to share as much stuff between so you don't have to keep reinventing it

22:03.360 --> 22:06.320
but you want to do that in the same way where you're not constantly passing

22:06.320 --> 22:10.160
state all around and have like ten arguments to your functions right that's

22:10.160 --> 22:15.080
just not really tenable to do so so hooks are one way to do that now view

22:15.080 --> 22:19.360
view doesn't really have that problem because it didn't have the same sort of

22:19.360 --> 22:23.680
object-oriented API and they even already had stateless functional

22:23.680 --> 22:29.520
components if you wanted them but they also used this idea of mixins and maybe

22:29.520 --> 22:32.080
Mike can can tell us a little bit more about mixins if we want to get into that

22:32.080 --> 22:36.120
and it just they just don't compose well so I thought what was neat is it is the

22:36.120 --> 22:39.200
view camp had some of the same ideas probably were influenced by some of the

22:39.200 --> 22:43.160
thoughts that the react camp had in terms of like this is just a nice way to

22:43.160 --> 22:48.240
handle state in a way where you can compose and and combine elements and

22:48.240 --> 22:52.720
components together with minimal fluff minimal just arbitrary nesting that you

22:52.720 --> 22:56.320
kind of have to do and in a way that scales better and it's cleaner and then

22:56.320 --> 22:58.680
mixins

23:00.600 --> 23:07.720
well okay so I definitely see their case for it yeah so it's pretty new you can

23:07.720 --> 23:12.200
go try it if you want we will have links and in the in the docks of course it's

23:12.200 --> 23:16.280
just something to play with I do a lot of the Clojure script stuff and we've

23:16.280 --> 23:19.200
kind of already had this style of approach we do we pray for just like

23:19.200 --> 23:22.680
have some functions you have a little state past you it's passed into your

23:22.680 --> 23:26.320
function somehow you track when that state changes yeah and you rerender the

23:26.320 --> 23:29.400
thing now I don't know it's kind of controversial if if the Clojure script

23:29.400 --> 23:33.040
communities kind of redo things and sort of like rebase on top of the hooks

23:33.040 --> 23:37.240
mechanisms or keep the way that they've already done it now time will tell but

23:37.240 --> 23:40.960
I think it's nice to see this this sort of trend of ideas something that I find

23:40.960 --> 23:45.160
at least personally more pleasing to develop with find its way to the larger

23:45.160 --> 23:53.240
JavaScript community okay so in the case of someone using a mixin in view the

23:53.240 --> 23:57.680
hooks I see I'm completely unfamiliar with few hooks and so this is post

23:57.680 --> 24:02.900
dating me right this is newer what what is the advantage of a hook over a

24:02.900 --> 24:06.400
mixin other than mixins being kind of like sloppy right I get why they're not

24:06.400 --> 24:14.320
great yeah so yeah oh cool no is it I'm just trying to conceptually is it if I'm

24:14.320 --> 24:18.520
not using Clojure script right is it the key I just JavaScript just yeah

24:18.520 --> 24:24.480
ECMA script JavaScript whatever will it like I personally don't like mixins

24:24.480 --> 24:29.200
because I think they're frankly cause more problems than they solve assuming

24:29.200 --> 24:32.840
you have a large enough scale of code right you have big enough code base yes

24:32.840 --> 24:35.980
exactly right they're kind of like weird magic and they don't always make it

24:35.980 --> 24:39.480
explicit where logic is coming right you don't know what the hell is happening

24:39.480 --> 24:42.560
basically yeah so that's actually one of the main things that they talk about

24:42.560 --> 24:46.840
here is that that you know folks really do do a lot of what what mixins do but

24:46.840 --> 24:49.440
they make it explicit where logic is coming from so you have a little bit

24:49.440 --> 24:51.760
more documentation and when you have to dive into a big code base that you

24:51.760 --> 24:54.360
haven't touched for six months should be a little bit plainer about what's

24:54.360 --> 24:58.840
actually happening how the data is flowing okay so on a like talk to me

24:58.840 --> 25:02.880
like I'm five level the reason I might use hooks is because they are

25:02.880 --> 25:08.480
effectively more maintainable or they solve the same problems as mixins but

25:08.480 --> 25:12.400
are far more maintainable yeah more maintainable simpler and more

25:12.400 --> 25:18.600
composable mmm very cool limitation on if I'm using TypeScript JavaScript

25:18.600 --> 25:25.280
Clojure scripts Clojure script has one library now I think it's called the H X

25:25.280 --> 25:29.640
that's that's using hooks otherwise reagent the main one already has a

25:29.640 --> 25:32.220
somewhat somewhat similar thing where you basically just define a function

25:32.220 --> 25:36.280
that returns a data structure and that defines your component view hooks are

25:36.280 --> 25:41.840
available already with you with the view 2.x but they're still experimental so if

25:41.840 --> 25:44.960
you're gonna play with them just just be aware of that I assume that the API

25:44.960 --> 25:48.600
works regardless of TypeScript or just regular JavaScript no I might be crazy

25:48.600 --> 25:51.440
because I like I said I mostly use angular now in fact I've been playing

25:51.440 --> 25:57.400
with ionic 4 which is just a addition to angular but doesn't react have

25:57.400 --> 26:04.040
something like this already yeah yeah so react head hooks first okay yeah and

26:04.040 --> 26:07.320
they they've been in development for a while and then they kind of just

26:07.320 --> 26:13.520
recently became generally available and people started really using them by the

26:13.520 --> 26:18.580
time this show ends up on iTunes there'll be a new version yeah be

26:18.580 --> 26:24.280
relevant anymore so you guys can just skip this chapter yeah nice good find

26:24.280 --> 26:27.960
Wes I love it I appreciate the breakdown definitely

26:27.960 --> 26:32.800
definitely out out of my paygrade but fascinating to learn about looks like

26:32.800 --> 26:36.600
there's gonna be a whole bunch of federal funding for AI projects Mike so

26:36.600 --> 26:41.840
you should use that use that small size of the mad bot or to a pivot into AI as

26:41.840 --> 26:46.600
quick as possible yeah yeah I guess there's gonna be an executive order sign

26:46.600 --> 26:51.800
that prioritizes federal funding for AI and will create resources for AI

26:51.800 --> 26:58.280
research establish standards and more it seems like that could be that could be a

26:58.280 --> 27:03.960
pretty big deal to legitimize the field of AI development I might be wrong that

27:03.960 --> 27:08.600
seems like a big news story yeah this is this is a literally breaking news for me

27:08.600 --> 27:13.200
so I have to take a look at it yeah yeah it developed while we were after we were

27:13.200 --> 27:16.600
actually already connected in recording I just saw it go by on the feeds it's

27:16.600 --> 27:23.200
been to me as just the way things happen not necessarily like enshrining it in

27:23.200 --> 27:28.320
invalid validity but more like it's it's one more peg on the system as like oh

27:28.320 --> 27:31.960
right I like the hipster tech companies started using it and you saw some real

27:31.960 --> 27:36.240
results but then like okay finally like the slower moving cycles of government

27:36.240 --> 27:39.920
money are coming out to actually fund this right which will build out the

27:39.920 --> 27:43.880
industry I mean that kind of you can you can get a loss you can get a nice

27:43.880 --> 27:48.120
healthy business that lives off of federal contracts and funding and it all

27:48.120 --> 27:52.700
it may also lead to AI being used more in scientific research which could have

27:52.700 --> 27:56.680
other kinds of benefits it could be a really big deal and I think that the

27:56.680 --> 28:00.920
overall effect adds not legitimacy isn't the right word because it's not that

28:00.920 --> 28:07.520
it's not a legitimate field right now but it feels like it sort of enshrines

28:07.520 --> 28:13.240
it in like it's now a it's now a codified tier of the tech industry in

28:13.240 --> 28:18.360
the States and yeah you're right like the stodgy the stodgy folks over there

28:18.360 --> 28:21.280
in the government there yeah they're hip to it now too they're funding it's not

28:21.280 --> 28:24.920
cool right and that will create a lot of business around it that'll create a lot

28:24.920 --> 28:29.600
of money for development and resources around it which will build out that

28:29.600 --> 28:33.400
industry base it'll draw more people into the field and it's all part of a

28:33.400 --> 28:39.440
cycle if it's successful obviously but you know just anecdotally there is a lot

28:39.440 --> 28:43.760
of requests for machine learning courses at Linux Academy coming in from students

28:43.760 --> 28:47.640
it seems to be a field that people generally the trend seems to be if

28:47.640 --> 28:52.280
people are beginning to look at that job field more then they start requesting

28:52.280 --> 28:55.200
that training so there's sort of a correlation between people looking for

28:55.200 --> 28:58.760
jobs in an industry and the amount of requests that Linux Academy gets for

28:58.760 --> 29:03.320
that kind of training and machine learnings way up on the list and that

29:03.320 --> 29:06.920
would mean that either there's at least a perception of and possibly really an

29:06.920 --> 29:10.880
increase in people you know companies hiring for those roles or people

29:10.880 --> 29:14.600
interested or thinking that companies will want more of those staff we should

29:14.600 --> 29:17.240
come up with a way to use machine learning wouldn't that be cool like

29:17.240 --> 29:21.440
something to analyze our podcasts like and analyze something about the podcasts

29:21.440 --> 29:24.840
I don't know something oh yeah all right let's go with something so they

29:24.840 --> 29:29.160
absolutely yeah I think so we'll just try to train a model that generates

29:29.160 --> 29:32.280
podcasts when we really don't want to go that's what that's what I was thinking

29:32.280 --> 29:37.200
of actually kind of along those lines today Nvidia announced that they are

29:37.200 --> 29:43.760
open-sourcing their face rendering technology called style Gan or it's

29:43.760 --> 29:49.760
style GAN and it creates these super realistic faces I mean I'll put a link

29:49.760 --> 29:53.560
I'll drop a link in the chat room so you guys can see it it's there it's really

29:53.560 --> 29:56.920
something like you would look at the pictures of these faces and you would

29:56.920 --> 30:00.440
think that they are real human being faces it's it's beyond the candy

30:00.440 --> 30:04.440
of them are like a little bit weird but most of them are just yeah you know

30:04.440 --> 30:07.280
especially and it probably helps that there's enough diversity in the human

30:07.280 --> 30:10.480
faces you know there's just a lot of true at least at least for how attuned

30:10.480 --> 30:14.240
we are to looking at faces there's a lot of range yeah I mean in here they're

30:14.240 --> 30:20.920
even putting babies faces there is like this this this Asian gals face here has

30:20.920 --> 30:25.240
like like oily like like you know she's got like her super moisturized skin

30:25.240 --> 30:29.800
coming back from the from the gym yeah it's just amazing and they're

30:29.800 --> 30:35.960
open-sourcing it today hyper realistic face generator so it's coming it's

30:35.960 --> 30:38.960
coming they part of what they're what part of what it really is that they're

30:38.960 --> 30:41.800
open-sourcing is the data set because obviously that's what you need for

30:41.800 --> 30:45.240
something like this right looks like a year the repo here seems that it's

30:45.240 --> 30:49.840
Creative Commons licensed ah thank you thank you yeah it's something like

30:49.840 --> 30:56.240
70,000 cropped and lined up headshots that it uses as source material to

30:56.240 --> 31:00.280
generate the faces and that's part of what they're open-sourcing is that

31:00.280 --> 31:04.520
70,000 high-quality PNG images Wow yeah that is that's a huge thing you don't

31:04.520 --> 31:07.160
always see that you know it's like oh yeah we got this cool algorithm but

31:07.160 --> 31:11.420
here's the data collecting all of your data to actually make a model and you

31:11.420 --> 31:17.400
know it's not it's not a trivial thing to get 70,000 headshots that are

31:17.400 --> 31:22.640
essentially all lined up the same way cropped the same way I mean it can be

31:22.640 --> 31:26.800
automated to a point but somebody had to go take those pictures yeah take those

31:26.800 --> 31:29.680
pictures filter through clean the day you said make sure that all of them are

31:29.680 --> 31:33.200
actually worthy of inclusion and won't mess things up yeah and that you're like

31:33.200 --> 31:36.680
allowed you know what are these sourced from there's probably that question too

31:36.680 --> 31:41.800
yeah yeah you you assume Nvidia has that part taken care of right and then here

31:41.800 --> 31:46.280
they also say this part of it they're releasing pre-trained models which are

31:46.280 --> 31:51.840
stored as PKL files which are pronounced pickle yeah and they're just up on

31:51.840 --> 31:55.760
Google Drive so you can go grab a pickle file off of Google Drive fresh hot

31:55.760 --> 32:01.080
pickle up on Google Drive and generate your own fake face and use that as your

32:01.080 --> 32:05.280
own your you know this would be a great way to be anonymous online but make it

32:05.280 --> 32:09.520
look like you're a real person and then you combine this with deep fakes and you

32:09.520 --> 32:15.680
can have a YouTube channel all the endless possibilities and you'd script

32:15.680 --> 32:21.640
it all with Python and there is some Python results that we could talk about

32:21.640 --> 32:26.960
today there is an annual Python developer survey that's officially

32:26.960 --> 32:29.920
annual now because this is the second one they've ever done the Python

32:29.920 --> 32:34.200
Software Foundation got together with jet brains and conducted an official

32:34.200 --> 32:38.760
annual Python developers survey you guys want to hear about some of the things

32:38.760 --> 32:43.080
they found interested at all and in the world of Python and just for some weeks

32:43.080 --> 32:46.880
22 because there's there's some like some background is I mean pythons kind

32:46.880 --> 32:51.080
of old right it came out in the 90s and it's had multiple faces it's been used

32:51.080 --> 32:55.800
as a teaching language it has you know semi-prominent web development

32:55.800 --> 33:00.760
framework and then now it's having something of a resurgence before AI yeah

33:00.760 --> 33:06.120
yeah exactly which is which is exactly why it ended up in this part of the show

33:06.120 --> 33:11.920
so 84% of Python users in the survey use Python as their main language by the way

33:11.920 --> 33:17.000
also I did a little looking at their data set and their data set seems fairly

33:17.000 --> 33:20.760
legit they have all of their source material posted up in the show which we

33:20.760 --> 33:26.680
will link in the show notes the average respondents were 20 somethings about 39%

33:26.680 --> 33:35.520
of them were 20 somethings 31% though so almost a third 30 to 39 and then 12% 40

33:35.520 --> 33:40.400
to 49 with only 7% being 18 to 20 but so that's the age range and then

33:40.400 --> 33:46.640
experience in the IT field 25% of them had 11 plus years in the IT field so

33:46.640 --> 33:49.200
that's a little bit of the and it's all over the world that they surveyed

33:49.200 --> 33:54.720
although most of the respondents are in India and the US 21% in the United

33:54.720 --> 34:00.280
States and 16% in India with the United Kingdom coming in at 6% in Germany at 5%

34:00.280 --> 34:06.400
China 4% France for Russia 3 Canada 3 alright so that's that's our that's our

34:06.400 --> 34:11.720
base that we're getting our answers from an 84% of those people use Python as

34:11.720 --> 34:18.080
their main language half of them that were surveyed also use JavaScript the

34:18.080 --> 34:22.920
2018 stats were pretty similar to the 2017 results in this regard with one

34:22.920 --> 34:27.560
significant difference in here being that there's a pretty noticeable jump

34:27.560 --> 34:36.200
in bash and shell usage it's grown from 36% in 2017 to 45% in 2018 so Python

34:36.200 --> 34:39.320
developers are using more bash what do you make of that mr. West what do you

34:39.320 --> 34:44.720
think that is I wonder if that's just sort of the general trend in in

34:44.720 --> 34:47.720
developers doing more operations work are they just having more access to

34:47.720 --> 34:52.280
bash terminals they have to kind of muck around more right systems yeah I wonder

34:52.280 --> 34:55.360
if it's that and then Mike do you think I'd be crazy to suggest that it's also

34:55.360 --> 34:58.880
more of them are using Linux in general that's exactly what I was gonna say I

34:58.880 --> 35:03.480
think the correlation between Python developers and Linux usage particularly

35:03.480 --> 35:06.920
now that we're in this are we still in a Mac Exodus by the way can we still say

35:06.920 --> 35:11.760
that or is that I don't know I think it's stabilized a little bit with the

35:11.760 --> 35:16.240
Mac Mini and the iMac Pro I feel like it's sort of stabilized out a little

35:16.240 --> 35:21.240
bit and Windows still isn't that great yeah yeah although Windows even with

35:21.240 --> 35:24.600
all the great Linux options it has it's just more like the core OS hasn't really

35:24.600 --> 35:27.920
gotten I think it's like they're all just there but they've all gotten a

35:27.920 --> 35:34.840
little more competitive over the last 12 months even the Linux side so but yeah I

35:34.840 --> 35:38.040
think they I think they still lost quite a bit I think it's still I've always

35:38.040 --> 35:42.920
felt like the max exodus was going to be something that was just ongoing as

35:42.920 --> 35:49.200
people got sort of bored of the sandbox of macOS or the limited laptop choices

35:49.200 --> 35:53.160
or desktop choices that they might want to just look at an open source desktop

35:53.160 --> 35:57.600
stack all together I've always kind of felt that but we'll see we'll see if

35:57.600 --> 36:00.560
that continues to bear out it's Apple's game to lose really going on to your

36:00.560 --> 36:07.120
point West 58% of respondents are using Python to do data analysis that's pretty

36:07.120 --> 36:11.240
significant I wonder what data analysis counts as because that's kind of a

36:11.240 --> 36:14.440
broad question right because you don't have to be a data scientist to do data

36:14.440 --> 36:18.000
analysis it might just be like munging through a whole bunch of XML or JSON to

36:18.000 --> 36:21.800
process in in some pipeline that you're using I bet just that's a lot of it I

36:21.800 --> 36:25.840
bet you that's that is I bet you that is a lot of it 52% are using it for web

36:25.840 --> 36:32.960
development 43% DevOps and pretty strong 38% are using it for machine

36:32.960 --> 36:39.960
learning that's about a 7% jump not not a substantial but a 7% jump from 2017 I

36:39.960 --> 36:43.320
think that's worth worth noting in its own I think it's worth noting that data

36:43.320 --> 36:47.580
analysis has now become more popular than web development I think that's also

36:47.580 --> 36:51.680
interesting and worth noting and it just shows you where pythons at right now and

36:51.680 --> 36:55.320
it's not none of its bad or good it's just where it's at and it's someone it

36:55.320 --> 36:57.880
speaks I think to some of the particular things that pythons done well which is

36:57.880 --> 37:04.760
mostly accumulated a lot of accelerated libraries implemented in C or assembler

37:04.760 --> 37:08.640
or Fortran and then linked against the main Python implementation that make it

37:08.640 --> 37:13.480
good for that and so well Ruby or node or whatever else of the days can come up

37:13.480 --> 37:17.320
and easily start being like look at this hot new web framework it's harder to be

37:17.320 --> 37:23.320
like look at these neat highly optimized linear algebra implementations but there

37:23.320 --> 37:27.480
is a bit of a story here isn't there about how Python has sort of kept up

37:27.480 --> 37:32.400
with staying relevant and has managed to grow its user base and managed to find

37:32.400 --> 37:38.160
newer and newer use cases and still grow out its ones that it has a stronghold in

37:38.160 --> 37:42.520
that's okay so we we have to talk about then in this survey which is crazy and

37:42.520 --> 37:45.400
it might it probably just speaks right we have to be aware of whatever

37:45.400 --> 37:49.920
selection involved for the people who actually took the survey right 84% use in

37:49.920 --> 37:55.440
Python 3 yeah that's crazy yeah that's a pretty big jump

37:55.440 --> 38:00.480
or am I just old and no too many people who are stuck on Python 2 Python for

38:00.480 --> 38:05.280
some time yeah it has but I still come across stuff on Python 2 all the time

38:05.280 --> 38:09.560
and I think for a long time we were it was you know it was the joke it was like

38:09.560 --> 38:13.200
how not to do a language transition because everyone was like well we

38:13.200 --> 38:16.040
already built this giant code base in two and we don't trust the two to three

38:16.040 --> 38:20.080
converter so like we don't need three and it took a while before like Django

38:20.080 --> 38:23.080
fully worked with three or you know a lot of the big libraries but it seems

38:23.080 --> 38:27.960
like now you know several or many of the larger tech companies that are based on

38:27.960 --> 38:31.680
it have changed to Python 3 it's the default I think a lot of people are

38:31.680 --> 38:35.760
using distros have switched so it's kind of a new Python 3 era so I think that's

38:35.760 --> 38:42.880
kind of it because 38% of respondents get Python from the distribution repo or

38:42.880 --> 38:47.160
homebrew or whatever like the OS provided installation method is 38% are

38:47.160 --> 38:51.120
doing that and so it doesn't get updated until those get updated and if you're on

38:51.120 --> 38:57.120
a maybe a rel from a you know release or two ago maybe that that could lead to

38:57.120 --> 39:01.200
that leg a little bit in and getting people to switch over that could be part

39:01.200 --> 39:05.160
of it and I think that's probably pretty astute there mr. pain you got also

39:05.160 --> 39:09.200
figure there's cloud providers that play a role in this and if those cloud

39:09.200 --> 39:13.620
providers are pushing the version forward on a reliable cadence then that

39:13.620 --> 39:18.720
is also making developers push forward 55% of Python users who use cloud

39:18.720 --> 39:25.200
platforms prefer AWS Google platform comes in second followed by heroku then

39:25.200 --> 39:29.600
digital ocean and then Azure which I thought was interesting and then about a

39:29.600 --> 39:33.640
third of the respondents said no cloud solutions for me I run it all on

39:33.640 --> 39:42.880
premises and as you guessed Mike 69% of respondents are using Linux as their

39:42.880 --> 39:49.000
primary development OS yeah 69% huge that's huge doesn't mean it's their only

39:49.000 --> 39:54.520
OS but it means it's the OS they spend their time in developing Python Windows

39:54.520 --> 40:06.320
came in 47% Mac OS 32% and BSD at 1% but hey it made it it hit 1% right it got

40:06.320 --> 40:09.880
invited to the debate and that's what counts that's true it did show up on the

40:09.880 --> 40:13.740
map I guess no surprise here pie charm is the most popular tool for Python

40:13.740 --> 40:20.060
development with 35% share however a little disruption here a new

40:20.060 --> 40:30.280
contender VS code has gone from 7% in 2017 to 16% in 2018 becoming the second

40:30.280 --> 40:35.760
most popular editor for Python development VS code it's not surprised

40:35.760 --> 40:38.800
sandwiched right in between the pie charm professional edition which is the

40:38.800 --> 40:41.800
most popular and then the pie charm community edition yeah third most

40:41.800 --> 40:46.400
popular and then boom VS code right there how about that it's more popular

40:46.400 --> 40:50.240
than the pie charm community edition and then I mean you know we don't we talk

40:50.240 --> 40:54.360
about it for a lot of other reasons but hey it's it's open source well not not I

40:54.360 --> 40:57.920
don't know about technically the version that you download that's compiled for

40:57.920 --> 41:03.120
you but in theory it's open source hmm I have nothing bad to say about VS code

41:03.120 --> 41:07.200
really I think Microsoft nailed it so it doesn't really surprise me to see it's

41:07.200 --> 41:12.960
growing and I I've been using a good name yeah yeah given LibreOffice a good

41:12.960 --> 41:15.920
name actually the other day I loaded up LibreOffice writer for the first time

41:15.920 --> 41:18.800
and you know a decade or whatever it's been and I'm like this is so

41:18.800 --> 41:23.400
lightweight and quick it's using so little RAM my whole perspective on

41:23.400 --> 41:29.360
LibreOffice writer has changed because of all the electron apps I use now so

41:29.360 --> 41:32.600
there you have it things change okay just a couple more around us all out

41:32.600 --> 41:37.440
then we're done here more than half of Python users are employed full-time 19

41:37.440 --> 41:42.280
percent are students and 13% are self-employed or freelancing it's a

41:42.280 --> 41:51.120
small group now Mike 13% the few the proud yep yeah so that's pretty much it

41:51.120 --> 41:53.960
then we had the ages in here there's several I don't anything else jump out

41:53.960 --> 41:57.840
at you about this survey Wes I get people a lot of people working as a

41:57.840 --> 42:02.320
team a lot of people working independently that worked that jumped

42:02.320 --> 42:07.200
out of me 48% work on a team and 48% work on their own with 4% work as an

42:07.200 --> 42:13.200
external contractor or trainer 4% oh you know I also noticed that a lot of 25%

42:13.200 --> 42:18.200
had 11 plus years in IT and that kind of makes sense I don't know a lot of the

42:18.200 --> 42:22.560
people I know who are decent at Python who might not be quote-unquote Python

42:22.560 --> 42:25.720
developers but use it anyway are people that just learned it as a scripting

42:25.720 --> 42:31.600
language coming up in the 2000s mm-hmm yeah yeah I guess that kid that could

42:31.600 --> 42:35.880
make it stick to that's why that's why Apple's always tried to get folks when

42:35.880 --> 42:40.040
they're in a in a very impressionable stage with IT and computers to use max

42:40.040 --> 42:44.400
now Google's doing oh yeah segment I also want one other thing before we go

42:44.400 --> 42:50.080
is flask is doing great which is a more lightweight web play as Django's the big

42:50.080 --> 42:53.760
one that's like rails but flask is is a nice little guy so it's nice to see you

42:53.760 --> 42:57.840
doing well yeah that is cool you know I want to say to that I've noticed that

42:57.840 --> 43:03.240
Python and the Python community at large do a really good job of reaching out to

43:03.240 --> 43:07.920
kids in a way that I don't see a lot of other communities doing and so I think

43:07.920 --> 43:11.820
that's pretty great too so I think a tip a hat as a parent I just got to say tip

43:11.820 --> 43:16.680
of the hat to them for doing that I think that's really cool now Mike

43:16.680 --> 43:21.680
wanted to get together here on on the Koda radio program and use the brain

43:21.680 --> 43:31.360
trust of all of us to imagine near a future perhaps a far distant future

43:31.360 --> 43:38.360
where the iOS App Store has been opened up for all or maybe even maybe even an

43:38.360 --> 43:42.560
alternate reality just for the sake of conversation let's say that when the

43:42.560 --> 43:47.280
Large Hadron Collider went online the universe split Donald Trump became

43:47.280 --> 43:54.660
president and Apple opened up the App Store to everyone so we have two

43:54.660 --> 44:00.600
parallel universes now yeah yeah so it's less opening to everyone and more even

44:00.600 --> 44:06.040
if you kept the app review policies everyone gets the same financial deal

44:06.040 --> 44:10.560
okay all right I can work with those rules yeah let's let's even stick with

44:10.560 --> 44:13.680
the financial stuff first there's also it's the same it's like the same share

44:13.680 --> 44:17.720
same cut and also like it's the same kind of crap then get you rejected but

44:17.720 --> 44:23.240
it's just the standard is applied from like Joe's Joe's text app to Netflix

44:23.240 --> 44:30.280
app yeah exactly so so the thing that really kind of triggered me on this of

44:30.280 --> 44:34.560
course was the Facebook Google shenanigans from last week but the

44:34.560 --> 44:38.680
response of particularly like ATP and some of the other more Apple focus

44:38.680 --> 44:43.240
podcasts kind of being like well of course there are different deals for the

44:43.240 --> 44:47.960
big boys versus the little guys which is like sure right like for a long time it

44:47.960 --> 44:52.720
has been widely reported that Netflix hasn't has never paid 30% to Apple right

44:52.720 --> 44:57.360
they've always get a sweetheart deal right and Microsoft doesn't either and

44:57.360 --> 45:01.680
you know Facebook's app theoretically can be rejected but let's be honest

45:01.680 --> 45:06.680
that's that doesn't really happen right well and I think that's why they're like

45:06.680 --> 45:11.080
of course they're special deals applications like Instagram Facebook

45:11.080 --> 45:17.720
Netflix Amazon Prime maybe they are they are value adds to the platform and

45:17.720 --> 45:23.320
without those you don't have as strong of a platform as a Android

45:23.320 --> 45:28.760
I would argue that Android has so many other deficiencies which send your hate

45:28.760 --> 45:34.800
mail to Alan broadcasting calm that one I don't I don't think let's just take

45:34.800 --> 45:38.460
the case of Facebook because Facebook and Instagram are the same company now

45:38.460 --> 45:47.080
right if Apple told Facebook so-and-so feature violates our guidelines in the

45:47.080 --> 45:51.720
Facebook app which Facebook really dump iOS those are the most valuable mobile

45:51.720 --> 45:55.480
users in the world I would imagine they'd probably double down on their web

45:55.480 --> 46:01.960
app well they're still a mobile Safari then right and they're gonna be pretty

46:01.960 --> 46:05.760
plus you just can't spy very well with a web app so how's that gonna work right

46:05.760 --> 46:10.280
well that's exactly what I'm getting at right like it it's weird I found myself

46:10.280 --> 46:15.200
in a strange position because I I have in the past been very understanding if

46:15.200 --> 46:19.920
not slightly annoyed at Apple's kind of draconian app review policies but the

46:19.920 --> 46:28.720
financial stuff in particular you know Netflix getting a 15% I know it's not

46:28.720 --> 46:33.560
called the App Store feed right the App Store cut I get why because they make

46:33.560 --> 46:39.280
billions of dollars but don't you think that's going to put the next Netflix

46:39.280 --> 46:44.180
right the you know West clip West flicks whatever at a fundamental

46:44.180 --> 46:50.240
disadvantage because they're cut to the platform vendor who I mean I gotta be

46:50.240 --> 46:54.800
honest I'm not even like I have lots of issues with this whole walled garden

46:54.800 --> 47:00.640
thing now but they're they're cut is double when when you're smaller you're

47:00.640 --> 47:05.920
not operating at very much efficiency at all compared to your larger competitor

47:05.920 --> 47:14.160
so it feels to me the state we have now in trenches the larger more established

47:14.160 --> 47:19.360
companies and actually Apple giving them better deals well there may be

47:19.360 --> 47:24.360
legitimate reasons for it is a backdoor way for them to also stifle their their

47:24.360 --> 47:27.720
potential competition right it's like this is kind of the same argument that

47:27.720 --> 47:31.800
people were making for net neutrality in some ways that the big the big companies

47:31.800 --> 47:35.400
have more leverage and little ones won't be able to start also just real quick

47:35.400 --> 47:39.780
FYI West flicks is just great finish great British bake-off and Star Trek on

47:39.780 --> 47:48.280
a continuous loop well I mean it you know we had that New York Times report

47:48.280 --> 47:52.240
where Facebook Facebook employee basically said yeah our entire business

47:52.240 --> 47:56.240
strategy is if we see us we track what you're doing on your phone if we see a

47:56.240 --> 47:59.240
startup that's potentially going to compete with us we either buy them or

47:59.240 --> 48:04.480
clone them right it's all a snap what they did to snapchat right they

48:04.480 --> 48:07.720
implemented a bunch of their features and Instagram right yeah you I mean you

48:07.720 --> 48:10.960
have to you right is that whatever quote-unquote dominant market position

48:10.960 --> 48:16.360
right there they're doing it in a pretty I would argue pretty shady on it yeah

48:16.360 --> 48:23.240
okay it's in your face kind of way too right and they because they're big they

48:23.240 --> 48:27.640
somehow have this leverage with the platform vendor what if we went into to

48:27.640 --> 48:33.320
Chris's alternate universe and Apple just said you know what we are the best

48:33.320 --> 48:37.520
platform for making money on mobile in at least North America and Europe right

48:37.520 --> 48:42.040
I can't speak to other places so here's the deal everybody gets the same deal

48:42.040 --> 48:46.400
this is it this is the human interface guideline this is the app review rules

48:46.400 --> 48:51.280
and it's 30% then after the first year is 15% if you're doing a subscription

48:51.280 --> 48:57.420
which is the current policy no side deals no accommodations that's what it

48:57.420 --> 49:05.080
is do you really believe that Netflix would drop their iPad app now Netflix I

49:05.080 --> 49:08.840
would argue is in the best position to do a PWA because they're not that

49:08.840 --> 49:13.520
interested in spying on you but like I would eat my hat if Facebook or

49:13.520 --> 49:19.440
Instagram did right Google certainly wouldn't abandon the platform Microsoft

49:19.440 --> 49:27.000
is so busy abandoning Windows right now that I doubt they'd abandon iOS or am I

49:27.000 --> 49:30.800
insane I mean is this just like Mike going off the rails well it's a I think

49:30.800 --> 49:36.640
it's a per case situation here so take Amazon here's a great case study when

49:36.640 --> 49:43.040
they bought Comixology and when they bought audible they removed the ability

49:43.040 --> 49:47.600
to buy books or comics within the app because of Apple's cut and said if you

49:47.600 --> 49:50.200
want to buy in fact they weren't even very clear about it because Apple's

49:50.200 --> 49:53.560
policies won't let you but you have to just suss out if you want to purchase

49:53.560 --> 49:58.000
something you have to launch your web browser and go to their website and buy

49:58.000 --> 50:02.640
it and so this has happened and been like this now for years years now so

50:02.640 --> 50:07.600
there is some precedent for a large tech company to say hey we can make do

50:07.600 --> 50:12.880
without you we're big enough we don't need you so I there it could happen so

50:12.880 --> 50:16.320
this is the exact point so you actually set up the point perfectly now let's

50:16.320 --> 50:22.840
say let's say Facebook created a competitor to Comixology and for

50:22.840 --> 50:27.680
whatever weird reason Apple made a side deal with Facebook right uncle Tim and

50:27.680 --> 50:32.680
a marquee boy got together and made a deal that Facebook's comic app would

50:32.680 --> 50:38.600
only pay 10% and that comic app would have the convenience of selling through

50:38.600 --> 50:42.720
the App Store through an app purchase their their you know issues and

50:42.720 --> 50:49.040
subscriptions where Amazon's Comixology couldn't Amazon that is Apple putting

50:49.040 --> 50:52.880
their finger on the scale right there at a material disadvantage and we haven't

50:52.880 --> 50:56.240
even gotten into the fact that there's an editorial function of the App Store

50:56.240 --> 51:03.840
and they could feature whoever they want true let me ask you this it seems like

51:03.840 --> 51:09.320
it's it what we're really running up against is pressures on a model that

51:09.320 --> 51:12.960
needs to be changed like the App Store has been around for eight or nine years

51:12.960 --> 51:17.120
now and this has essentially been the model with the slight adjustment to

51:17.120 --> 51:21.080
subscriptions recently but recently is like in the last two years like that's

51:21.080 --> 51:25.640
what's recent I think what has to be looked at is the value the App Store

51:25.640 --> 51:30.880
provides to the developer if they're hosting a bunch of game asset files and

51:30.880 --> 51:35.160
they're streaming that using the Akamai CDN all around the world to people's

51:35.160 --> 51:40.280
devices as levels load that's a that's a that's a 30% value definitely yeah

51:40.280 --> 51:43.400
because you're hosting my files you're you're making all the back-end

51:43.400 --> 51:47.920
infrastructure that's that's valuable however if I'm a streaming application

51:47.920 --> 51:53.120
that is simply just loading a video player and then streaming the contents

51:53.120 --> 51:56.000
from my server and I'm paying for the bandwidth and I'm paying for the video

51:56.000 --> 52:01.720
hosting and I'm bringing the bulk of the value to the relationship then I think

52:01.720 --> 52:06.680
it's inappropriate to ask for 30% of the revenue there needs to be a re-analysis

52:06.680 --> 52:11.720
of the value that Apple brings versus the value that the app provider brings

52:11.720 --> 52:14.800
sure and if Apple's hosting the majority of the infrastructure then they price it

52:14.800 --> 52:17.240
that way if it's a streaming app and perhaps they could just make a broad

52:17.240 --> 52:22.440
category streaming applications we only take a 10% cut I agree with that but

52:22.440 --> 52:25.680
that's that's not exactly the argument here right because you have to compare

52:25.680 --> 52:29.800
Apple to Apple's so pun intended right again I'm just saying I think that's the

52:29.800 --> 52:33.880
way you fix this because you're right it does stifle it does stifle the little

52:33.880 --> 52:37.800
the the smaller app developer but as a as a private business or I mean as a

52:37.800 --> 52:41.080
business as a as a as a company that's supposed to make money Apple has every

52:41.080 --> 52:44.600
right to do that but let's just say there was like JB book which was a

52:44.600 --> 52:49.920
fledgling competitor to Facebook and you did the exact same thing that Facebook

52:49.920 --> 52:55.480
did in this latest hubbub your dev account would have simply been deleted

52:55.480 --> 52:59.480
we're talking about we're talking about last week's enterprise developer right

52:59.480 --> 53:04.640
you would have no dev account your apps would have been pulled done you know and

53:04.640 --> 53:11.840
put out of business I think I agree with that mm-hmm so that is Apple picking a

53:11.840 --> 53:17.480
winner right that that's I mean I know I'm gonna sound very like because I do

53:17.480 --> 53:20.920
believe that these app stores actually are in some I'm not a lawyer but in some

53:20.920 --> 53:29.040
way they need to be regulated with an antitrust eye because basically while I

53:29.040 --> 53:34.760
know Tim Cook personally doesn't like Zuckerberg if he did and him let's just

53:34.760 --> 53:40.280
say you know for whatever reason he decided that Facebook was the one true

53:40.280 --> 53:44.480
social network Apple could simply not allow any other social networks on their

53:44.480 --> 53:50.520
platform they have that power they have the power to as they just did last week

53:50.520 --> 53:55.760
allow one developer to violate and yes they did some PR slap on the wrist which

53:55.760 --> 54:01.160
was nice but there was no real repercussions other than you know a

54:01.160 --> 54:06.280
minor day and a half of chaos at Facebook headquarters the face of it

54:06.280 --> 54:10.680
that's and Google and we're talking you're talking tens of thousands of

54:10.680 --> 54:13.960
employees and contractors look at what they did to small developers right look

54:13.960 --> 54:19.520
what they did to the developer of the dash app on Mac which was a a API

54:19.520 --> 54:25.240
documentation and dev documentation macOS application who had a minor problem

54:25.240 --> 54:28.760
with his account because he was from I don't know the exact I don't remember

54:28.760 --> 54:32.800
the details but I remember I spoke to him he was basically he had a problem he

54:32.800 --> 54:35.800
had to use a Eastern European card and Apple freaked out cuz they thought it was

54:35.800 --> 54:41.960
fraud they just threw him out with no communication that would never happen to

54:41.960 --> 54:49.200
Facebook right Facebook intentionally and overtly violated the policies and

54:49.200 --> 54:54.440
got little more than a slap on the wrist now to play devil's advocate here

54:54.440 --> 54:59.480
wouldn't the argument be on Facebook side well that's that's the that's the

54:59.480 --> 55:04.500
reward we get for making our products so appealing to end users that they

55:04.500 --> 55:10.880
demanded on the platform and and that's and Apple's Apple's defense is we we've

55:10.880 --> 55:15.960
we worked business to business with an important quote-unquote partner of ours

55:15.960 --> 55:19.920
on the App Store to make sure that we had a quick resolution to an application

55:19.920 --> 55:23.440
that's really important to our users now I grant you Facebook's actual core app

55:23.440 --> 55:26.680
was never at risk here but if we're talking about like the response of

55:26.680 --> 55:30.200
closing someone's developer account which thus kicked them out of the App

55:30.200 --> 55:33.640
Store as a result of that I don't think that was ever gonna happen to Facebook

55:33.640 --> 55:39.320
because of those two pretty defensible positions and that's a really shitty

55:39.320 --> 55:45.360
thing to say when you're an independent developer who's up against that but that

55:45.360 --> 55:48.720
is the way these businesses work because of the demand of users so there's a

55:48.720 --> 55:52.880
famous Greek quote right the weak suffer what they must which is basically what

55:52.880 --> 55:59.160
you're saying so let's say if we had Chris book again by failing to be as big

55:59.160 --> 56:04.320
and as important as powerful as Facebook you will be inherently disadvantaged by

56:04.320 --> 56:10.120
what is supposed to be in quotes a neutral platform vendor

56:10.120 --> 56:13.720
it would be we just don't have a lot of neutral platform vendors there's always

56:13.720 --> 56:16.600
humans who are picking and choosing and making decisions and they're gonna

56:16.600 --> 56:21.000
always have in other spaces there are rules right let's say you know I really

56:21.000 --> 56:25.800
don't want a competitor to open next door to me right but I cannot get Sun

56:25.800 --> 56:29.480
biz which is the Florida State Department's you know business

56:29.480 --> 56:33.080
corporation registry of course to forbid the registration of another development

56:33.080 --> 56:40.080
shop Apple can Apple can say hey you just can't be on the App Store true right

56:40.080 --> 56:43.960
or you can't make this style of application right I was good I yeah I

56:43.960 --> 56:48.240
was gonna say the web is the is the one true platform except one of the reasons

56:48.240 --> 56:52.680
we switched our Jupiter broadcasting YouTube in bed videos back to YouTube

56:52.680 --> 56:58.680
from our own hosted mp4 feeds is because several carriers out there are free

56:58.680 --> 57:03.560
rating YouTube and I'm competing against free so if you watch a video on our

57:03.560 --> 57:08.320
website it is going against your data if you watch it on YouTube it's free and

57:08.320 --> 57:12.640
that we looked at that and went well people aren't watching because of that

57:12.640 --> 57:17.280
so now we're embedding YouTube videos again and there's not really a neutral

57:17.280 --> 57:21.960
platform right it's the exact same issue of I think what is it t-mobile likes

57:21.960 --> 57:27.480
likes Netflix and Verizon likes YouTube right something weird like that yeah I

57:27.480 --> 57:29.760
don't know I think it's crazy I think everything should be forced to be

57:29.760 --> 57:35.640
neutral but again you can write Alan as you put a broadcasting calm I was gonna

57:35.640 --> 57:39.880
I was gonna go to Linux but then really you have I mean correct me if you think

57:39.880 --> 57:43.720
I'm wrong here West but even even Linux distributions aren't a neutral

57:43.720 --> 57:48.800
distribution platform because you have the opinions of maintainers and and what

57:48.800 --> 57:52.800
not that have to get the software in the distributions I don't really even think

57:52.800 --> 57:56.840
Linux is like a truly neutral distribution platform yeah I mean it's

57:56.840 --> 58:00.760
hard to know quite what neutral is I think at least there there's at least

58:00.760 --> 58:07.520
more more rules and at least in some distributions if you want you could step

58:07.520 --> 58:11.760
up and volunteer to maintain things and she'll be able to lobby for inclusion of

58:11.760 --> 58:14.240
whatever software you wanted if you were gonna do that work and you just don't

58:14.240 --> 58:18.200
have that option it's funny too that you haven't seen like I can see high you

58:18.200 --> 58:20.640
know 30% or whatever when you're when you're starting off you're trying to

58:20.640 --> 58:24.880
bootstrap but we all know how much cash Apple has right 30% is just quite the

58:24.880 --> 58:30.560
it's quite the cut yeah the issue is that they have to drive services revenue

58:30.560 --> 58:34.520
that's the only area of strong growth they have in that area that the market's

58:34.520 --> 58:38.360
watching very closely and so any cuts they make in this area take from

58:38.360 --> 58:42.520
services right I'm just like at one point to kind of sharpen my argument

58:42.520 --> 58:48.760
here because I feel like it's not just the preferential treatment it's there is

58:48.760 --> 58:54.040
a documented list of rules and the punishments are for you know I started

58:54.040 --> 58:57.840
when I was development the apps were opened right or bright before it open

58:57.840 --> 59:03.400
actually the punishments have been well documented over the years Facebook in

59:03.400 --> 59:07.520
particular is is such a privileged place where they cannot only get preferential

59:07.520 --> 59:12.040
treatment like you know call an Apple rep and get an answer they can actually

59:12.040 --> 59:20.320
openly and unapologetically violate the rules and just you know simply get

59:20.320 --> 59:25.640
probation for murder one basically which seems crazy to me that that would ever

59:25.640 --> 59:31.240
be acceptable yeah I mean I I can't disagree with you and we didn't even get

59:31.240 --> 59:35.440
to the conversation around the amount of control that Apple has and why I think

59:35.440 --> 59:39.920
the real reason it was such a minor punishment is because if they had gone

59:39.920 --> 59:44.580
any longer it would have started the conversation do we want to let Apple

59:44.580 --> 59:48.440
have this much control over the internal functions of Google and Facebook and

59:48.440 --> 59:52.640
other major corporations because the answer that is no and if they had put

59:52.640 --> 59:56.520
the pressure on any longer you know that would have been the conversation the

59:56.520 --> 59:59.560
only reason it didn't go that direction is because they pretty much tied things

59:59.560 --> 01:00:04.120
up in a day and a half and problem solved but if it had gone to a week that

01:00:04.120 --> 01:00:07.520
would have been that that would have been the focus of the conversation I mean

01:00:07.520 --> 01:00:12.600
PWAs are getting better every year and I I wouldn't be surprised if in the future

01:00:12.600 --> 01:00:16.920
these type of internal like order your burrito apps aren't just going to be

01:00:16.920 --> 01:00:23.520
PWAs and and that's the world we're going to I agree now we have we have to

01:00:23.520 --> 01:00:29.080
get going but mr. Payne you have any final thoughts you know I think that I

01:00:29.080 --> 01:00:31.480
think that wraps it up I mean there's so much more to talk about here and we'll

01:00:31.480 --> 01:00:34.800
we'll continue to see how this developments and how how this develops

01:00:34.800 --> 01:00:38.720
and how Apple does Apple actually embrace PWAs does that gonna be a thing

01:00:38.720 --> 01:00:41.800
is that I was just gonna see more on Android and in the Apple remains it's a

01:00:41.800 --> 01:00:45.720
little pristine wall to garden I don't know now you probably just have to keep

01:00:45.720 --> 01:00:48.920
tuning into coder radio maybe you could subscribe I don't know where to do that

01:00:48.920 --> 01:00:53.440
hmm maybe coder dot show slash subscribe we'd love to know your thoughts to coder

01:00:53.440 --> 01:00:57.920
dot show slash contact and links for everything we talked about today coder

01:00:57.920 --> 01:01:02.440
dot show slash 344 I want to before we go I got a couple of picks and I do want

01:01:02.440 --> 01:01:06.840
to say this we have to take all of this commentary on Apple about and the App

01:01:06.840 --> 01:01:10.920
Store and put it in the frame of the fact that I'm sitting right here with an

01:01:10.920 --> 01:01:14.400
iPad Pro right now so they're doing something right because one of the

01:01:14.400 --> 01:01:18.040
reasons I bought the iPad Pro is because it has the best apps and there is that

01:01:18.040 --> 01:01:22.280
reality and that aspect of the App Store is it it sells products so I don't I

01:01:22.280 --> 01:01:24.600
don't like what they're doing and I think everything you brought up is a

01:01:24.600 --> 01:01:27.360
valid point and I think they need to restructure based on the value they

01:01:27.360 --> 01:01:32.080
bring developers but they are doing some things right speaking of right I think

01:01:32.080 --> 01:01:35.560
you found a virtual machine in the web browser to learn see Wes this sounds

01:01:35.560 --> 01:01:41.520
awful right oh oh I'm here I'm here and I did I did find that so I don't know

01:01:41.520 --> 01:01:45.120
about you guys but especially like learning Linux I think it's a great example there's

01:01:45.120 --> 01:01:49.240
a lot of interactivity you know you type something wrong into the shell and it

01:01:49.240 --> 01:01:52.480
yells at you or maybe it deletes all your files but either way you feel bad

01:01:52.480 --> 01:01:57.480
and you got that fast feedback and and as as Mike will probably a test it's the

01:01:57.480 --> 01:02:00.320
same reason you do stuff in development like like test-driven developments

01:02:00.320 --> 01:02:04.200
you've got all these tests you know quickly if you make a change did you

01:02:04.200 --> 01:02:08.520
break anything did it actually work oh yeah it's harder to do that in C right

01:02:08.520 --> 01:02:11.880
like in Python or Ruby or even Java these days you can pull up a REPL you

01:02:11.880 --> 01:02:15.680
kind of play around get a feel for things see you got to go understand

01:02:15.680 --> 01:02:19.680
install install a compiler figure out how it works there's no like handy

01:02:19.680 --> 01:02:23.000
package manager or anything and then you have to go reason about this old

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:27.760
language that was designed to be like a slightly better assembler enter mini C

01:02:27.760 --> 01:02:32.760
which is just like an in browser embedded C environment for learning so

01:02:32.760 --> 01:02:37.080
it'll it'll show you what the what the what the compiled output looks like and

01:02:37.080 --> 01:02:40.880
sort of disassemble it a little bit and clarify what what's going on and then it

01:02:40.880 --> 01:02:45.960
shows you a big old hunk of memory and lets you step through it obviously you

01:02:45.960 --> 01:02:48.640
know if you're a professional C developer you can do all of this with all

01:02:48.640 --> 01:02:53.560
of your existing toolers all of your existing tooling GDB all sorts of stuff

01:02:53.560 --> 01:02:57.120
but if you're just getting started learning C isn't always easy especially

01:02:57.120 --> 01:03:01.760
if you're coming from like JavaScript I think this would be a great tool that's

01:03:01.760 --> 01:03:06.180
a cool find it's open source to links to all that in the show notes as mentioned

01:03:06.180 --> 01:03:11.440
earlier and you're on fire with the fines this week West nice job see geez

01:03:11.440 --> 01:03:15.920
you are you are good you are a sleuther of the Internet it's like a sponge now

01:03:15.920 --> 01:03:20.960
my sleuthing has gone in a weird direction this week I after that

01:03:20.960 --> 01:03:24.920
conversation about Apple being a kingmaker I thought it would be good to

01:03:24.920 --> 01:03:30.640
lighten the mood a little bit and I found a browser extension that I just

01:03:30.640 --> 01:03:34.840
suggest you install for a day I wouldn't leave this on forever we maybe give it a

01:03:34.840 --> 01:03:41.960
go it is a extension that adds a laugh track to any YouTube video on YouTube

01:03:41.960 --> 01:03:46.160
I'll give you an example here and a richer country than it was when I

01:03:46.160 --> 01:03:53.680
assumed office less than two years ago we are standing up for America and for

01:03:53.680 --> 01:04:00.400
the American people and we are also standing up for the world so you can

01:04:00.400 --> 01:04:05.440
play that along within a YouTube video and it makes everything better it's just

01:04:05.440 --> 01:04:08.640
a nice it's a nice thing to have and you can find a link to that in the show

01:04:08.640 --> 01:04:11.080
watch that's everything I think I'm gonna use it on Jupiter broadcasting

01:04:11.080 --> 01:04:15.000
videos that's not a bad idea I should that's what I should have got a clip of

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:19.040
that would have been that have been really good mr. Payne thank you thank you

01:04:19.040 --> 01:04:22.800
for not only filling in but sticking around now that we're gonna we're trying

01:04:22.800 --> 01:04:26.200
this out let us know what you guys think I'm still traveling so there probably be

01:04:26.200 --> 01:04:29.800
some more just a Wes and Mike episodes but when we get a chance from time to

01:04:29.800 --> 01:04:34.200
time we're gonna try to do the three of us love to know your thoughts coder dot

01:04:34.200 --> 01:04:38.480
show slash contact and I think I think I also registered coder radio dot show but

01:04:38.480 --> 01:04:42.280
I don't remember anymore so coder dot show slash contact to let us know what

01:04:42.280 --> 01:04:45.360
you think go get more Wes not only is the only Linux

01:04:45.360 --> 01:04:50.080
unplugged program but he's also on the revamped tech snap joined by Jim Salter

01:04:50.080 --> 01:04:55.600
from ours technica and very soon they have a deep dive coming up on network Q

01:04:55.600 --> 01:04:59.160
OS which could be very handy when developing and testing software they

01:04:59.160 --> 01:05:03.160
just did an episode deep dive on ZFS on Linux in the situation there and much

01:05:03.160 --> 01:05:07.320
more so go check out tech snap dot systems for that thank you us for being

01:05:07.320 --> 01:05:10.460
here mr. Dominic where do you want to send people this week I follow at

01:05:10.460 --> 01:05:15.840
diminuco on Twitter boom easy peasy but I won't say lemon

01:05:15.840 --> 01:05:21.660
squeezy Wes stay safe in the snow up there it's crazy 70 year snowstorm yeah

01:05:21.660 --> 01:05:24.360
I think the easiest way is to just keep podcasting right that way you'll know

01:05:24.360 --> 01:05:29.680
I'm yeah yeah we'll check in on you from time to time make sure you're live by

01:05:29.680 --> 01:05:32.600
being subscribed all the show that's just a great idea Wes well thank you

01:05:32.600 --> 01:05:35.640
everybody so much for being here I'm at Chris LAS on the Twitter the network is

01:05:35.640 --> 01:05:57.320
at Jupiter signal and we'll see you back here next week
