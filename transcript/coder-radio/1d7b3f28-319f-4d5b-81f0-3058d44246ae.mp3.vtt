This is KOTORadio, episode 416 for May 31st, 2021.

00:15.600 --> 00:19.320
Well hi there and welcome into Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show, taking a pragmatic look

00:19.320 --> 00:24.160
at the art and business of software development and the world of technology.

00:24.160 --> 00:25.960
This episode is brought to you by a cloud guru.

00:25.960 --> 00:31.280
You know, a cloud guru has cloud playground, that's Azure, AWS and Google cloud sandboxes

00:31.280 --> 00:33.800
on ACG's credit card, not yours.

00:33.800 --> 00:38.200
Get certified, get hired, get learning at a cloud guru.com.

00:38.200 --> 00:43.200
My name is Chris and joining us like the podcasting master he is, it's our host, Mr. Dominic.

00:43.200 --> 00:44.200
Hello Mike.

00:44.200 --> 00:45.200
What's up, Chris official?

00:45.200 --> 00:48.160
We are going home.

00:48.160 --> 00:53.000
I missed you, you know, I missed you because we took a week off so I could travel and I

00:53.000 --> 00:54.000
get the itches, you know?

00:54.000 --> 00:57.480
So I got to like, I got to like ping you and slack and stuff just to get like my fix.

00:57.480 --> 00:58.480
Right.

00:58.480 --> 01:01.240
You kind of watch the Phantom Menace and private browsing mode so nobody else knows.

01:01.240 --> 01:02.240
I get it.

01:02.240 --> 01:03.240
Yeah.

01:03.240 --> 01:06.120
And then I just, I just send you like a, like a audio recording of my breathing while I

01:06.120 --> 01:10.400
watch the movie, not the audio of the movie, just my breathing, you know, so you have that

01:10.400 --> 01:11.880
because I want you to have that.

01:11.880 --> 01:12.880
That's amazing.

01:12.880 --> 01:16.200
Hey, I apologize if I sound like, but I'm in Idaho, you know, it can't be helped because

01:16.200 --> 01:17.200
I'm in Idaho.

01:17.200 --> 01:18.200
So I'm not in the studio.

01:18.200 --> 01:19.200
I'm in Idaho.

01:19.200 --> 01:20.200
I'm in quarter lane.

01:20.200 --> 01:21.840
You ever been to quarter lane, Idaho?

01:21.840 --> 01:22.840
It's beautiful.

01:22.840 --> 01:24.080
It's the only client claim that I have.

01:24.080 --> 01:28.340
I tell you what, it's like a, it's like a, it's like a part of Washington and a little

01:28.340 --> 01:31.080
bit of Texas and Montana all mixed into one spot here.

01:31.080 --> 01:32.340
It's actually kind of pleasant.

01:32.340 --> 01:36.320
Are you on a classified mission for Lady Choups?

01:36.320 --> 01:38.080
Yeah.

01:38.080 --> 01:42.400
Secret podcasting business, obviously, you know, as always, I got secret podcasting biz.

01:42.400 --> 01:45.400
On Her Majesty's podcasting service, right?

01:45.400 --> 01:46.640
This is my return West.

01:46.640 --> 01:52.720
I'm heading back West, back to Seattle and stopped here for a couple of days and been

01:52.720 --> 01:56.840
getting some business done and I've been like fighting stupid technical issues.

01:56.840 --> 02:03.680
Well, actually, let me tell you something, man, on my way out here, like just mechanical

02:03.680 --> 02:08.360
issue after mechanical issue, I've, I've paid nearly a thousand dollars in emergency repairs

02:08.360 --> 02:10.480
just on the drive out here, right?

02:10.480 --> 02:11.480
Not Lady Choups.

02:11.480 --> 02:12.480
Yeah.

02:12.480 --> 02:13.480
Yeah.

02:13.480 --> 02:14.480
Yeah.

02:14.480 --> 02:15.480
Yeah.

02:15.480 --> 02:16.480
It's almost like these RVs break down all the time or something.

02:16.480 --> 02:17.480
I don't know how to explain it.

02:17.480 --> 02:21.480
Actually, I am legitimately struggling with a design flaw.

02:21.480 --> 02:25.120
You know, you know, you, you know, sometimes like you get down the road like a few years

02:25.120 --> 02:29.240
in a project and you discover there's a fundamental design flaw that really can't be fixed.

02:29.240 --> 02:30.240
Nope.

02:30.240 --> 02:31.240
That's never happened to me.

02:31.240 --> 02:33.720
And unless you can prove it, my lawyers will tell you no.

02:33.720 --> 02:34.720
Yeah.

02:34.720 --> 02:35.720
Yeah.

02:35.720 --> 02:38.000
And so the way this thing works is it has these slides that go out for the kitchen in

02:38.000 --> 02:42.920
the living room and it gives you like a miraculous amount of space inside a vehicle.

02:42.920 --> 02:45.880
But when those slides break, you're immobilized.

02:45.880 --> 02:47.760
And so the engine can be in great shape.

02:47.760 --> 02:50.920
You can have tires, great suspension, you can have solar power.

02:50.920 --> 02:53.720
You can be an off-grid machine, but if your slides break, you're just screwed.

02:53.720 --> 02:54.980
And so that kept happening to us.

02:54.980 --> 02:58.840
But the highlight of the trip really was, as I suspect the kid and the wife might've

02:58.840 --> 02:59.840
gotten COVID.

02:59.840 --> 03:00.840
I'm not sure.

03:00.840 --> 03:02.680
Cause obviously how can I tell without getting them tested?

03:02.680 --> 03:03.680
Oh God.

03:03.680 --> 03:04.680
Yeah.

03:04.680 --> 03:05.680
Yeah.

03:05.680 --> 03:06.680
They both got sick, came down with the symptoms.

03:06.680 --> 03:09.960
The wife and I have been vaccinated, so I don't know how she would have gotten it, but

03:09.960 --> 03:18.080
she, you know, the stuffy nose, cough, lost a taste, you know, just checking off the fatigue.

03:18.080 --> 03:22.600
Her and the boy have the same exact symptoms, but nobody else has gotten it.

03:22.600 --> 03:26.920
So we're of course doing the whole like quarantine thing now.

03:26.920 --> 03:30.200
I'm sure I speak for all the listeners here, but wish you guys well.

03:30.200 --> 03:31.200
That's awful.

03:31.200 --> 03:32.200
Thank you.

03:32.200 --> 03:33.360
So far I haven't, I don't seem to have any symptoms.

03:33.360 --> 03:36.520
I don't seem, Oh man, tell you what.

03:36.520 --> 03:40.440
So, but you know, there's been nice things too, family time and all that, you know, so

03:40.440 --> 03:42.800
it's like, so now the kids are gone, right?

03:42.800 --> 03:46.960
They've left with their mom and you know, while the kids are here and it gets towards

03:46.960 --> 03:50.080
the end of the trip, I'm like, Oh man, it's going to be so nice when it's just a DNI and

03:50.080 --> 03:52.640
it's going to be quiet and we won't have any kids.

03:52.640 --> 03:57.440
And then legitimately the moment the kids leave, I'm like, Oh, I miss the kids.

03:57.440 --> 04:01.080
What kind of, what kind of screwed up, like I torture myself like, Oh, I can't wait for

04:01.080 --> 04:02.120
quiet time.

04:02.120 --> 04:03.120
And then I get it.

04:03.120 --> 04:04.120
And I'm like, Oh, I miss the kids.

04:04.120 --> 04:06.740
And I never, I never am happy.

04:06.740 --> 04:08.520
Nobody told me this was the deal with fatherhood.

04:08.520 --> 04:09.520
I have the same experience.

04:09.520 --> 04:14.200
My kid has been with grandma for approximately eight hours and I'm like a meth fiend, jonesing

04:14.200 --> 04:15.200
right now.

04:15.200 --> 04:21.160
And it's like, I've been waiting for this for like a week and then it gets here actually

04:21.160 --> 04:22.160
more than a week.

04:22.160 --> 04:23.160
Right.

04:23.160 --> 04:24.160
I've been for two weeks.

04:24.160 --> 04:25.160
I've been waiting and then it gets here.

04:25.160 --> 04:26.160
I'm like, Oh, I just, I don't know.

04:26.160 --> 04:30.480
So anyways, I'm here in Coeur d'Alene now self quarantining in my RV symptom list so

04:30.480 --> 04:38.160
far and I just have a few more days to wait out and then I'll be back on my way again.

04:38.160 --> 04:39.160
So let's do some emails.

04:39.160 --> 04:40.720
I hope it's not about robes.

04:40.720 --> 04:41.720
Yeah.

04:41.720 --> 04:44.520
So drew writes in, he said, I hadn't heard much about the robe.

04:44.520 --> 04:47.560
God damn it.

04:47.560 --> 04:51.240
I know we were off and so I didn't mention the robe and it's just, I'm curious about

04:51.240 --> 04:52.240
it.

04:52.240 --> 04:56.240
I'd like it a robe update because you know, he wants his, he wants his quarter.

04:56.240 --> 05:02.480
So some, some very, very thankfully and very frustrating stuff in here and you know, it

05:02.480 --> 05:04.440
is what it is with this damn thing.

05:04.440 --> 05:06.800
But some people have received their robes and that's incredible.

05:06.800 --> 05:09.960
So that's the, that's the positive side and I'll start with that.

05:09.960 --> 05:13.400
The positive thing is some robes have gone out.

05:13.400 --> 05:17.660
The negative thing is only small batches at a time are going out and it's going to be

05:17.660 --> 05:23.120
that way probably until the end of June if their current estimates are correct.

05:23.120 --> 05:31.160
And it is 100% my fault because I delayed trying to solve the international shipping.

05:31.160 --> 05:38.160
I pushed the manufacturing back into a international global supply chain shut down.

05:38.160 --> 05:42.720
And if you could not believe it, after all of the other troubles I had with this robe,

05:42.720 --> 05:47.180
we are now dealing with a supply chain shortage for the raw materials to actually make the

05:47.180 --> 05:48.180
robe itself.

05:48.180 --> 05:51.440
Because of course I had to pick a fancy material.

05:51.440 --> 05:55.040
I had to pick something nice and comfortable that would last.

05:55.040 --> 05:58.880
And so I were listening to ATP and Marko, yes, I understand.

05:58.880 --> 06:03.440
I got all fancy, you know, I got my fancy, fancy robe.

06:03.440 --> 06:07.400
And now of course that's in a material shortage.

06:07.400 --> 06:10.400
So they get a little bit, they can make a few and they send them out and they say it's

06:10.400 --> 06:14.560
going to be done by the end of June, but I am actually pretty skeptical of that man.

06:14.560 --> 06:15.560
Oh man.

06:15.560 --> 06:19.120
And if I, you know what I, and now what I would do is I would order all of the robes

06:19.120 --> 06:22.540
and have them shipped to the studio and then I would either ship them out from the studio

06:22.540 --> 06:23.540
or do fulfillment.

06:23.540 --> 06:27.920
Like I could do this robe again in, in two weeks and it'd be done.

06:27.920 --> 06:31.680
It'd be open up the orders, take the orders for a week and then the next week they ship

06:31.680 --> 06:32.680
out.

06:32.680 --> 06:36.640
Because what I would do now is I would just buy a batch of them and I would stock them

06:36.640 --> 06:39.300
and I would take care of the shipping aspects.

06:39.300 --> 06:44.000
And I, I made such a mistake with this one, but I realized how else would I have ever

06:44.000 --> 06:45.060
figured this stuff out?

06:45.060 --> 06:48.160
The system I have now is like dialed in.

06:48.160 --> 06:50.360
I'm actually pretty proud of it.

06:50.360 --> 06:55.500
Learned a lot of lessons, but this damn effing robe is still not done.

06:55.500 --> 07:00.080
And it legitimately feels like when you're going through a rough patch in life and then

07:00.080 --> 07:03.540
you're like, when this robe is done and ship and I'm on the other side of this thing, it's

07:03.540 --> 07:07.440
going to feel like I've come through something like I've gone through a phase of life.

07:07.440 --> 07:10.600
I cannot believe all of the issues.

07:10.600 --> 07:12.440
And this delay was totally my fault.

07:12.440 --> 07:18.320
I knew, I knew before I ever opened my dumb, stupid mouth on air, I knew I shouldn't commit

07:18.320 --> 07:22.600
to international orders because I didn't know that I just, it was an unknown, but I thought

07:22.600 --> 07:26.000
to myself, I thought, how hard can it be?

07:26.000 --> 07:27.600
I can figure this out.

07:27.600 --> 07:28.600
I'll figure it out.

07:28.600 --> 07:29.600
I'm a clever guy.

07:29.600 --> 07:31.120
How hard can it be?

07:31.120 --> 07:36.260
And then a pandemic happened and I had me being Mr. Clever trying to delay and trying

07:36.260 --> 07:37.800
to get the international shipping figured out.

07:37.800 --> 07:40.940
So it wasn't eighty five effing dollars a robe.

07:40.940 --> 07:43.700
That delay pushed it right into this whole supply chain shortage thing.

07:43.700 --> 07:50.700
And if it's just not one damn thing after another with this robe, I'm so done with it.

07:50.700 --> 07:51.720
So it's close, though.

07:51.720 --> 07:52.720
It's close.

07:52.720 --> 07:53.720
I haven't received mine yet.

07:53.720 --> 07:55.960
So there you go.

07:55.960 --> 08:00.080
It's legitimately not like even like a first come first serve order thing.

08:00.080 --> 08:02.000
I don't even know the order they're sending them out in.

08:02.000 --> 08:06.280
And, huh, and you know what happens when you have something that gets delayed like this

08:06.280 --> 08:11.840
for this long, people move, they move because months have gone by.

08:11.840 --> 08:16.600
And so now we have to like try to catch orders in flight and update their shipping address

08:16.600 --> 08:20.360
when people move, which, by the way, if you're moving and want to ship to a different address,

08:20.360 --> 08:23.720
email me Chris at Jupiter broadcasting dot com, because I'm going to put a batch in for

08:23.720 --> 08:26.080
a couple of order updates in a couple of days.

08:26.080 --> 08:28.600
So if you want to get yours in when you're hearing this, let me know.

08:28.600 --> 08:31.000
But yeah, so there you go, Drew.

08:31.000 --> 08:32.460
That is the latest.

08:32.460 --> 08:35.320
So if you are email me and you haven't gotten yours yet, then you aren't one of the first

08:35.320 --> 08:36.500
that have gotten theirs.

08:36.500 --> 08:37.500
But don't worry.

08:37.500 --> 08:41.100
Neither am I.

08:41.100 --> 08:42.100
Never again.

08:42.100 --> 08:43.480
I know what I'll do.

08:43.480 --> 08:45.640
And I like the company we're working with still.

08:45.640 --> 08:46.780
Coffee cups.

08:46.780 --> 08:47.780
Just do coffee.

08:47.780 --> 08:48.780
Well, I mean, I could do it.

08:48.780 --> 08:49.780
I just would anything, anything.

08:49.780 --> 08:53.000
I would just do it differently than the key thing is.

08:53.000 --> 08:55.440
And I don't want to throw any particular company under the bus here.

08:55.440 --> 09:02.360
But the key core like total mistake I made is trying to get the manufacturer to work

09:02.360 --> 09:06.560
directly with another shipping company or do the drop shipment themselves instead of

09:06.560 --> 09:08.800
just getting me all of the product.

09:08.800 --> 09:13.460
I tried to have it go directly from manufacturing to the customer, and that was a bad idea.

09:13.460 --> 09:17.560
It seemed like the simplest route because it seemed like a dumb idea to like have me

09:17.560 --> 09:19.840
involved as a middleman managing the shipping.

09:19.840 --> 09:23.940
But clearly, clearly that would have been better because now what we've implemented

09:23.940 --> 09:27.920
with Jupiter Garage has been so smooth.

09:27.920 --> 09:29.440
It's so efficient.

09:29.440 --> 09:32.400
It's just so much better that it's obvious that's the way I should have gone from the

09:32.400 --> 09:33.400
beginning.

09:33.400 --> 09:36.080
But I guess I just I wouldn't have known until I tried.

09:36.080 --> 09:39.560
And now I just want to have to have a drink when I think about the road.

09:39.560 --> 09:41.820
I just want to drink.

09:41.820 --> 09:42.820
One day I will.

09:42.820 --> 09:45.400
I'll be sipping my whiskey and wearing nothing but a robe.

09:45.400 --> 09:50.480
But in the meantime, Simon writes, Hi, guys, you know, recently, Mike literally described

09:50.480 --> 09:55.760
Chrome OS and this is in regards to like a Linux vendor that could save us from the integrated

09:55.760 --> 09:56.760
Apple experience.

09:56.760 --> 10:01.960
He said Mike described Chrome OS and Chromebooks in Episode 414, a Linux distro and OS that

10:01.960 --> 10:05.360
is tightly integrated with the hardware and doesn't care about including proprietary

10:05.360 --> 10:06.360
blobs.

10:06.360 --> 10:10.120
Google will eventually cut the right deals with the right OEMs who are working on something

10:10.120 --> 10:11.800
approaching the M1.

10:11.800 --> 10:15.200
It'll be a little while, but I think we'll see a device running Linux that compete with

10:15.200 --> 10:19.240
Apple and maybe it'll just be on price, but maybe it'll also be performance.

10:19.240 --> 10:24.100
The GPL extremists will find a way to complain about it, but at least there will be something

10:24.100 --> 10:26.740
to compete with Apple.

10:26.740 --> 10:27.740
Maybe I don't know.

10:27.740 --> 10:29.220
What do you think?

10:29.220 --> 10:32.640
Is Google Chromebook's going to save us now?

10:32.640 --> 10:33.640
Just now.

10:33.640 --> 10:34.640
Yeah, I think you're probably right.

10:34.640 --> 10:38.640
I would I mean, I think the issue I had and this is the case I tried to make in the episode

10:38.640 --> 10:42.920
is I mean, yes, Apple has impressive hardware, blah, blah, blah.

10:42.920 --> 10:45.620
The software gets updated and modified to support the hardware.

10:45.620 --> 10:47.840
That's great and matters, blah, blah, blah.

10:47.840 --> 10:54.160
But I think I think it's more about the companies and I think it's the culture in the companies.

10:54.160 --> 10:55.920
And I think that's why nobody's catching up with Apple.

10:55.920 --> 10:59.760
It's not a matter of a technical deal with Samsung to make a crazy great ARM processor

10:59.760 --> 11:03.960
to go in a Chromebook that then gets sold at Best Buy because that's been the strategy

11:03.960 --> 11:04.960
all along.

11:04.960 --> 11:09.080
It's that these companies don't have the follow through and the actual ability to do the end

11:09.080 --> 11:11.920
to end deals and software and integration necessary.

11:11.920 --> 11:17.000
Yeah, I think it's just not going to happen because, yeah, I mean, you're right.

11:17.000 --> 11:18.960
Yeah, it's just not going to happen.

11:18.960 --> 11:22.500
Jimmy writes and he says, you know, gentlemen, I wanted to share a thought on Chris's comment

11:22.500 --> 11:26.340
about Apple's edge when designing hardware and software together with the performance

11:26.340 --> 11:30.860
improvements seemingly like they're unstoppable force these days.

11:30.860 --> 11:33.800
And I want to just pause right here if you're just catching if you're just catching up.

11:33.800 --> 11:37.880
Mike and I have been discussing recently that we think the reason why Apple keeps coming

11:37.880 --> 11:42.120
up so much in the emails and in the news and in our conversations is because they're really

11:42.120 --> 11:46.360
pulling ahead right now in a way that kind of seems unstoppable in terms of performance

11:46.360 --> 11:48.040
and software integration.

11:48.040 --> 11:52.900
And one of the things we talked about as an example is in the M1 architecture now they

11:52.900 --> 11:56.760
have the big little set up where you have the high powered cores, the fast cores and

11:56.760 --> 11:58.600
you have the high efficiency cores.

11:58.600 --> 12:01.880
And when they rolled those out, Mac OS immediately supported that.

12:01.880 --> 12:05.400
And one of the things that contributes to fantastic battery life apparently on these

12:05.400 --> 12:10.500
M1 is a lot of the background tasks, you know, scheduled jobs and operating system maintenance.

12:10.500 --> 12:14.960
The OS has been designed to put lower priority tasks on the lower efficiency or I should

12:14.960 --> 12:18.600
say the higher efficiency cores, the cores that save power.

12:18.600 --> 12:22.440
And that was a that was a good example of hardware rolls out, everything just supports

12:22.440 --> 12:24.200
it, performance is incredible.

12:24.200 --> 12:29.280
And it's an example of sort of this focused focused attack mode that Apple goes into when

12:29.280 --> 12:30.660
developing these products.

12:30.660 --> 12:35.140
But Jimmy says it reminded him of a recent episode on Sam Harris's podcast.

12:35.140 --> 12:41.060
Him and a guest talked about loose cultures and ordered cultures and how they respond

12:41.060 --> 12:43.440
to threats, change and a myriad of other topics.

12:43.440 --> 12:46.880
The connection he's making here is that Apple is effectively an ordered culture when it

12:46.880 --> 12:51.600
comes to products, which geopolitically is much like China.

12:51.600 --> 12:56.100
China's strength is that it can act with efficiency, building hospitals in weeks and really own

12:56.100 --> 12:57.920
the messaging and the process.

12:57.920 --> 13:03.220
This is a benefit of their ordered culture, but it comes at the cost of certain liberties

13:03.220 --> 13:04.840
within society.

13:04.840 --> 13:09.800
Apple can own the entire process as well as set the rules of the game, which we're going

13:09.800 --> 13:13.360
to see in the epic case, sort of a similar comparison.

13:13.360 --> 13:19.480
Meanwhile, the X86 and AMD and the non Apple armed devices, their culture is much more

13:19.480 --> 13:23.960
fragmented into loose Confederacy or groups that can't really operate at the efficiency

13:23.960 --> 13:27.640
of Apple, particularly with hardware, software integration.

13:27.640 --> 13:31.960
This kind of reminds me, Jimmy says, of the United States and how efficient they are at

13:31.960 --> 13:33.680
responding to anything, really.

13:33.680 --> 13:39.080
The Confederacy allows great and terrible ideas to equally flourish.

13:39.080 --> 13:43.640
So it'll always be behind in some regards to consumer hardware because of this.

13:43.640 --> 13:48.000
Add to this, Apple's ordered structure lends itself to a strong brand because it doesn't

13:48.000 --> 13:50.600
have to share that with anyone else.

13:50.600 --> 13:53.960
What brand does the non Apple world have with consumer hardware?

13:53.960 --> 13:56.640
Where's the leadership in that Confederacy?

13:56.640 --> 14:00.780
It's fragmented and it cannot compete with Apple right now.

14:00.780 --> 14:03.480
So he's saying, and I'm curious to know your take on this.

14:03.480 --> 14:07.480
What Jimmy is saying is it's essentially just the structure of these groups.

14:07.480 --> 14:09.720
And so for a while, Apple is going to run away with it.

14:09.720 --> 14:13.240
They're going to they're going to push forward and they're going to lap the hardware industry

14:13.240 --> 14:16.800
and the software integration industry and iOS devices will remain super fast because

14:16.800 --> 14:17.800
of this.

14:17.800 --> 14:18.800
And now MacBooks will, too.

14:18.800 --> 14:23.280
And there's nothing the X86 world can do because of the way it's structured right now.

14:23.280 --> 14:24.600
That seems pretty bleak, Mike.

14:24.600 --> 14:25.600
It's pretty bleak.

14:25.600 --> 14:31.260
I mean, it also has a lot to do with like decisions Intel made years ago that no one

14:31.260 --> 14:33.960
could have foreseen as being bad, but we're kind of bad, right?

14:33.960 --> 14:35.800
They kind of back themselves into a corner.

14:35.800 --> 14:40.400
I don't remember what episode it was, but John Siracusa on ATP had a great breakdown

14:40.400 --> 14:44.860
of how Intel accidentally backed themselves into a corner.

14:44.860 --> 14:52.040
Now one thing I think that's maybe a little parochial, but he misses in this email is

14:52.040 --> 14:57.300
Apple just has infinite money effectively to do whatever they want, right?

14:57.300 --> 15:02.920
So Apple does not need to sell these processors to anyone at a profit.

15:02.920 --> 15:06.440
And I don't know if you know this, Chris, but Apple's profit margin on all their products

15:06.440 --> 15:13.680
is a I believe it's called fat with a pH, especially those dongles, right?

15:13.680 --> 15:19.000
They can sort of just take the pain where, let's say, Intel or Qualcomm kind of have

15:19.000 --> 15:20.000
to sell.

15:20.000 --> 15:23.080
You know, that's a that's a volume versus margin business, right?

15:23.080 --> 15:29.080
So and they're licensing fees at each stage that cut into the other person's profits for

15:29.080 --> 15:30.080
that particular product.

15:30.080 --> 15:34.640
You know, I go back to like, you know, you just dismissed it out of hand.

15:34.640 --> 15:40.760
But that that modular laptop that uses the USBC interconnects to let you sort of assemble

15:40.760 --> 15:43.040
your own machine with your own ports.

15:43.040 --> 15:47.640
And I just I keep like Alexi wrote in and Alexi's like it's just at the end of the day,

15:47.640 --> 15:50.580
it's never going to matter because they don't let you repair the machines.

15:50.580 --> 15:52.560
And that's just a hard line for him.

15:52.560 --> 15:59.820
He says, I know you guys like your iPad Pros and Florida man likes his M1.

15:59.820 --> 16:04.020
But what would it take for you to give up on these platforms to him?

16:04.020 --> 16:05.440
It's like that's just a line he won't cross.

16:05.440 --> 16:07.440
He's like, so you're never going to let you repair it.

16:07.440 --> 16:09.200
They don't respect your rights.

16:09.200 --> 16:11.120
How is that not just a full stop right there?

16:11.120 --> 16:15.480
Alexi says, just stop giving Apple your money.

16:15.480 --> 16:19.560
I just I think that's how a lot of people feel out there in the audience is that's a

16:19.560 --> 16:24.760
line that's just too far like that's the ultimate sin is baking all of the parts in and never

16:24.760 --> 16:29.480
letting you, you know, upgrade the hard drive or replace a hard drive or replace a battery.

16:29.480 --> 16:30.480
Okay.

16:30.480 --> 16:32.240
But the problem is that's exactly what I want.

16:32.240 --> 16:33.240
Right.

16:33.240 --> 16:34.240
I mean, I can't speak for you.

16:34.240 --> 16:40.720
But, you know, if, you know, Dell or system 76, you know, I preferred Linux vendor, made

16:40.720 --> 16:45.240
me the equivalent of an iMac Pro that was an all in one that had a goddamn camera and

16:45.240 --> 16:50.880
good microphone in the screen that I didn't have to worry about switching audio inputs.

16:50.880 --> 16:51.880
I would do it.

16:51.880 --> 16:52.880
Right.

16:52.880 --> 16:53.880
That's kind of what I want.

16:53.880 --> 16:55.240
I don't want to have to hook up a webcam.

16:55.240 --> 16:56.540
I don't want to run cable.

16:56.540 --> 17:03.640
I don't want I mean, my hatred of fan noise as well recorded right to repair.

17:03.640 --> 17:04.640
I mean, I know.

17:04.640 --> 17:05.640
Yeah, sure.

17:05.640 --> 17:06.640
In theory.

17:06.640 --> 17:07.640
But I don't repair anything.

17:07.640 --> 17:08.640
I just pour gin on it and throw it out.

17:08.640 --> 17:13.700
So I think the success of laptops in the consumer market and in the business market has kind

17:13.700 --> 17:20.080
of shown that there is not a huge, huge general drive of these kinds of repair abilities.

17:20.080 --> 17:26.400
I think most people treat these as dispensable appliances, as maybe as reprehensive and non

17:26.400 --> 17:27.720
sustainable as that is.

17:27.720 --> 17:29.600
They just treat them as replaceable appliances.

17:29.600 --> 17:33.680
You know, Alexi went on to say that right to repair matters more because of just the

17:33.680 --> 17:37.460
significant failure rates of Mac devices.

17:37.460 --> 17:43.120
He goes on a lot about the you know, the M ones are failing and the hard drives are bad.

17:43.120 --> 17:47.760
I see these kinds of things go around a lot on the Internet, but I think it comes down

17:47.760 --> 17:48.760
to scale.

17:48.760 --> 17:54.520
Like when you sell millions of a product and then thousands have issues and those thousands

17:54.520 --> 17:58.200
take to the Internet to complain, it sends a skewed perspective.

17:58.200 --> 18:02.420
And I I really hate that it sounds like I'm defending Apple here because I think it should

18:02.420 --> 18:03.420
be repairable.

18:03.420 --> 18:04.420
It is kind of a line for me.

18:04.420 --> 18:09.000
And that's why every Mac I've ever bought has been after much consternation and really

18:09.000 --> 18:11.600
weighing the pros and cons of that tool or not.

18:11.600 --> 18:12.800
So it does bother me.

18:12.800 --> 18:17.040
And that's why I do tend to lean towards devices that give me access to swap those parts out.

18:17.040 --> 18:21.240
But even my trusty X1 carbon here now has a soldered in hard drive.

18:21.240 --> 18:25.200
I have I'm holding it right here in my hands, you can you can hear the solid plastic that

18:25.200 --> 18:26.200
nice plastic.

18:26.200 --> 18:27.200
Right.

18:27.200 --> 18:29.920
My Windows box is an X1 carbon now.

18:29.920 --> 18:30.920
Yeah.

18:30.920 --> 18:34.560
And I don't know about the Windows version, but the Linux version has soldered down storage.

18:34.560 --> 18:35.560
Go figure.

18:35.560 --> 18:36.560
So, yeah, me.

18:36.560 --> 18:43.220
So now my ThinkPad has soldered storage and a built in battery, too, that I can't remove.

18:43.220 --> 18:45.920
And so it just seems to be going across the entire industry.

18:45.920 --> 18:50.040
It's perhaps maybe it's like an old man thing like it's something that early computer users

18:50.040 --> 18:52.960
expect, Mike, and new computer users maybe don't even think of it.

18:52.960 --> 18:53.960
I see.

18:53.960 --> 18:54.960
I feel like it's the opposite.

18:54.960 --> 19:00.840
Like, you know, I know I was kind of slightly slagging off Alexi here, but when I was younger,

19:00.840 --> 19:03.440
I actually would have been right there with them.

19:03.440 --> 19:07.360
It's now that I'm like a boring dad that I'm kind of like, I just don't care.

19:07.360 --> 19:08.360
Right.

19:08.360 --> 19:12.520
If it breaks, I want to drive it 20 minutes to the store and have them give me a new one.

19:12.520 --> 19:14.120
And we've heard that a lot.

19:14.120 --> 19:18.960
Like I you know, I got old and busy and now I just don't build PCs anymore and I don't

19:18.960 --> 19:21.480
really want to troubleshoot them when I get home.

19:21.480 --> 19:24.080
You know, when we see people that talk about why they've switched.

19:24.080 --> 19:27.640
I have a real world case, you know, I'm in the market for a flight simulation machine

19:27.640 --> 19:32.200
again and I have that old Thaleo, you know, and it was built for when I bought it.

19:32.200 --> 19:33.200
I don't know.

19:33.200 --> 19:36.920
Was it three years ago, two years ago now, whenever it was.

19:36.920 --> 19:41.000
But the problem is to upgrade it to the GPU I need, I would need to replace the power

19:41.000 --> 19:43.840
supply, which is not impossible.

19:43.840 --> 19:44.840
Right in a Thaleo.

19:44.840 --> 19:46.600
That's like very doable.

19:46.600 --> 19:49.720
But that's just something I'm like, do I really want to do that?

19:49.720 --> 19:50.720
Well, now it's a project.

19:50.720 --> 19:51.720
It's not.

19:51.720 --> 19:53.040
You could do it, but it's a project now.

19:53.040 --> 19:55.480
It's already running our legacy version of our software.

19:55.480 --> 20:00.760
So it's like, you know, it wouldn't hurt to have to, especially because I kind of got

20:00.760 --> 20:04.360
my landlord at the office in Plant City to pick up the power bill.

20:04.360 --> 20:08.360
He's going to regret that.

20:08.360 --> 20:09.360
Mining time.

20:09.360 --> 20:10.360
I can't.

20:10.360 --> 20:11.360
I can't.

20:11.360 --> 20:13.720
It's a shame about Dogecoin, by the way.

20:13.720 --> 20:15.680
Man, crypto in general is just taking it.

20:15.680 --> 20:16.680
Thank you.

20:16.680 --> 20:17.680
Thanks, Elon.

20:17.680 --> 20:18.680
Thanks, buddy.

20:18.680 --> 20:19.680
Thanks.

20:19.680 --> 20:20.680
That was that was nice.

20:20.680 --> 20:21.680
But I don't know.

20:21.680 --> 20:26.360
Anyway, let's talk about better things such as Linode.

20:26.360 --> 20:27.920
Linode.com slash coder.

20:27.920 --> 20:31.880
Go there to get one hundred dollars in credit for 60 days on your new account and you support

20:31.880 --> 20:32.880
the show.

20:32.880 --> 20:34.220
Go see why they are hosting provider.

20:34.220 --> 20:36.880
We use Linode for everything we deploy now.

20:36.880 --> 20:39.280
I have been for the last couple of years.

20:39.280 --> 20:44.240
Linode's infrastructure is solid, it's flexible and you can focus on your project, not the

20:44.240 --> 20:48.540
infrastructure details that you don't really have time to worry about anyways.

20:48.540 --> 20:51.680
And they have eleven data centers to choose from and every service level is backed by

20:51.680 --> 20:52.680
the best.

20:52.680 --> 20:56.240
I mean, really, guys, the best customer service in the business.

20:56.240 --> 20:58.040
I love their dedication to that.

20:58.040 --> 21:00.360
You know, Linode started way back in 2003.

21:00.360 --> 21:02.340
I like to mention that because it matters.

21:02.340 --> 21:03.680
It's not just a trivial fact.

21:03.680 --> 21:07.560
That's before AWS, before Azure, before the quote unquote big clouds.

21:07.560 --> 21:10.880
They knew what they were doing back then and they focused on one thing and they just got

21:10.880 --> 21:12.160
it right.

21:12.160 --> 21:15.440
Couple of months ago, I set up a sync thing server just to make life easier.

21:15.440 --> 21:17.360
It's a five dollar Linode.

21:17.360 --> 21:22.220
Five dollars and it runs sync thing and I also use it as an SSH jump host.

21:22.220 --> 21:26.920
It's nice knowing that I have something out in the cloud to help me manage my sync thing

21:26.920 --> 21:27.920
instance.

21:27.920 --> 21:30.600
It just moves data around faster.

21:30.600 --> 21:35.020
They got crazy fast systems, crazy fast networks, and I use Linode for everything from the back

21:35.020 --> 21:40.160
end for download services or encoding services for the podcast, simple things like moving

21:40.160 --> 21:42.160
data around and jump hosts.

21:42.160 --> 21:46.080
I love the fact that they have cloud firewalls, they have node balancers, and they have one

21:46.080 --> 21:49.460
click application deployments if you just want to get something up and going quick.

21:49.460 --> 21:54.560
I tend to build from scratch because I want like a minimum viable box, right?

21:54.560 --> 21:57.240
And they have some of those for you to one click deploy as well.

21:57.240 --> 22:01.680
And that's the great thing is the range of options for pros or beginners is all there

22:01.680 --> 22:05.320
with Linode and they make it all very accessible with their dashboard.

22:05.320 --> 22:07.580
So head over to linode.com slash coder.

22:07.580 --> 22:10.560
Get that $100 in credit and try it out.

22:10.560 --> 22:11.560
Go build a system.

22:11.560 --> 22:16.320
Perhaps it could be the perfect place for your next application or a great way to learn.

22:16.320 --> 22:19.380
There's a lot of ways to host something and a lot of various companies that will do it

22:19.380 --> 22:20.600
for you.

22:20.600 --> 22:29.800
Go see why we always choose Linode over and over linode.com slash coder.

22:29.800 --> 22:36.440
So last week, Microsoft build went down and I went to just read the reviews and the press

22:36.440 --> 22:40.640
and the take on it, and it was so fricking negative.

22:40.640 --> 22:44.640
I have never seen this much of hate for a build event.

22:44.640 --> 22:48.200
So I wanted to get your take on it because I'm betting you loved it.

22:48.200 --> 22:51.680
I mean, I sort of think it was the best Linux conference ever.

22:51.680 --> 22:52.680
Oh, wow.

22:52.680 --> 22:53.680
Oh, wow.

22:53.680 --> 22:55.800
You know, maybe you're right.

22:55.800 --> 23:00.520
You know what's wild is so, of course, you know, Saatchi Nadella, he gets up there during

23:00.520 --> 23:02.280
such a keynote.

23:02.280 --> 23:07.600
He talked about Linux more than he talked about Windows as pandemic as this is.

23:07.600 --> 23:12.820
He was timed and the entirety that he spent in the keynote talking about Windows was one

23:12.820 --> 23:14.360
minute and five seconds.

23:14.360 --> 23:17.400
And I grabbed it for you because I really want to talk about what he says on the other

23:17.400 --> 23:18.400
side.

23:18.400 --> 23:22.260
Across all the opportunities I've highlighted today, Windows is implicit.

23:22.260 --> 23:24.240
It's never been more important.

23:24.240 --> 23:29.940
Windows 10 is used by more than one point three billion people to work, learn, connect

23:29.940 --> 23:35.680
and play, and it all starts with Windows as a dev box.

23:35.680 --> 23:39.720
Windows brings together all your developer and collaboration tools in one place.

23:39.720 --> 23:44.640
It lets you choose the hardware you want, works with Linux and Windows environments

23:44.640 --> 23:47.780
as one and has a modern terminal.

23:47.780 --> 23:54.360
And soon we will share one of the most significant updates of Windows of the past decade to unlock

23:54.360 --> 23:57.480
greater economic opportunity for developers and creators.

23:57.480 --> 24:01.440
I've been self hosting it over the past several months and I'm incredibly excited about the

24:01.440 --> 24:03.640
next generation of Windows.

24:03.640 --> 24:05.800
Our promise to you is this.

24:05.800 --> 24:10.960
We will create more opportunity for every Windows developer today and welcome every

24:10.960 --> 24:17.280
creator who is looking for the most innovative, new, open platform to build and distribute

24:17.280 --> 24:19.240
and monetize applications.

24:19.240 --> 24:22.400
We look forward to sharing more very soon.

24:22.400 --> 24:25.380
Unlock greater economic opportunity for developers.

24:25.380 --> 24:31.040
He said that once and then he said again later, we will create more opportunity for every

24:31.040 --> 24:32.600
Windows developer today.

24:32.600 --> 24:34.680
OK, I have so much here.

24:34.680 --> 24:37.000
Do you want me to start with the negative or the positive?

24:37.000 --> 24:40.000
Maybe we start with the negative and we'll end it on, you know, nice little ended on

24:40.000 --> 24:41.000
a high note thing.

24:41.000 --> 24:45.280
If I was a pure dot net client side developer, I would be afraid.

24:45.280 --> 24:50.840
I would be very afraid because all this Maui stuff, this dot net six stuff like I've been

24:50.840 --> 24:54.600
looking into it and I listened to the sessions.

24:54.600 --> 24:58.920
This sounds an awful lot like the dream of Metro that never happened, right?

24:58.920 --> 25:04.120
Like dot net is going to be a high level platform to cross all the all the clients.

25:04.120 --> 25:08.240
And also there's a great post and I wish I had put in the show notes and I'll I'll shoot

25:08.240 --> 25:13.360
it to you in slack later from the you know, Rufus, the ISO flashing application.

25:13.360 --> 25:14.360
Sure.

25:14.360 --> 25:17.600
Yeah, there is a GitHub issue where someone was kind of giving him a rough time about

25:17.600 --> 25:22.660
not making it a UWP app and he goes into great detail about why he can't and as someone who

25:22.660 --> 25:28.640
routinely ships UWP to clients because they want it, there are limitations in UWP.

25:28.640 --> 25:33.920
It's not nearly as strict as iPad OS or here's a dirty secret kids.

25:33.920 --> 25:39.080
It's just iOS or, you know, you know, iOS in general.

25:39.080 --> 25:42.480
But it has some some constraints.

25:42.480 --> 25:46.440
It's getting to the point of I'll give you a perfect example that you have in the show

25:46.440 --> 25:47.440
notes.

25:47.440 --> 25:48.440
Webview two.

25:48.440 --> 25:51.600
Do you know what the difference between Webview two and the regular Webview is?

25:51.600 --> 25:52.800
No, I don't think so.

25:52.800 --> 25:59.720
OK, I will tell you one is backed by Chromium, but not available in most modern browsers.

25:59.720 --> 26:08.160
And one is backed by I believe it's old I.E. Oh, oh, and unless you're on a very specific

26:08.160 --> 26:12.960
version called the Win UI three, as you have in the notes, you cannot use Webview two.

26:12.960 --> 26:17.400
And this literally bit me in the ass about a week and a half ago, right after we recorded

26:17.400 --> 26:18.400
last week's show.

26:18.400 --> 26:19.400
Oh, really?

26:19.400 --> 26:24.440
Yeah, when I thought I was operating, I had to do an embedded Webview in a it's a it's

26:24.440 --> 26:26.360
a Windows app, but it's like a tablet kiosk thing.

26:26.360 --> 26:28.400
So like nobody knows it's Windows.

26:28.400 --> 26:30.840
But I'm like, son of a bitch, why doesn't this work?

26:30.840 --> 26:34.960
And the answer was because that particular JavaScript feature I was the DOM feature I

26:34.960 --> 26:38.800
was trying to access did not work in I.E., but the version of Windows they were running

26:38.800 --> 26:44.380
and the SDK I was hitting was not Webview two, even though I thought it was so boy,

26:44.380 --> 26:50.160
that feels just like a classic Microsoft Windows, like Jerry versus the Microsoft Java runtime

26:50.160 --> 26:51.760
like the whole thing all over again.

26:51.760 --> 26:52.760
Oh, hang on.

26:52.760 --> 26:53.760
I'm still swinging here.

26:53.760 --> 27:04.560
So Project Reunion, one great name that says we forked up basically UWP, WPF, Winforms,

27:04.560 --> 27:10.160
Xamarin or as Chris calls it, Xamarin, are all going to come together into some sort

27:10.160 --> 27:12.960
of strange Voltron of hell.

27:12.960 --> 27:13.960
Finally.

27:13.960 --> 27:16.720
So this is basically admitting defeat, right?

27:16.720 --> 27:18.600
This is we have too many objectives.

27:18.600 --> 27:24.440
Oh, and let's not forget my hero, Steven Sanofsky, who, by the way, I will die on this hill,

27:24.440 --> 27:31.760
was correct in his assertion that C++ development on Windows is the right way to do it.

27:31.760 --> 27:35.720
Send your hitmail to Alan at Jupiter Broadcasting Dotcom.

27:35.720 --> 27:40.960
And for all their love, for all their selling you on this, can we call it crap?

27:40.960 --> 27:41.960
Can we do that now?

27:41.960 --> 27:42.960
I think so.

27:42.960 --> 27:44.480
We're making a good case why it is crap.

27:44.480 --> 27:49.920
For all the selling on this crap that hasn't worked since some moron lost $40,000 on Windows

27:49.920 --> 27:50.920
phone.

27:50.920 --> 27:51.920
Don't know who that could be.

27:51.920 --> 27:52.920
I mean, I don't know.

27:52.920 --> 27:53.920
What did they announce right afterwards?

27:53.920 --> 27:57.120
Linux gooey apps on WSL.

27:57.120 --> 28:00.160
How do you feel, client side Windows developers?

28:00.160 --> 28:01.160
How does that feel?

28:01.160 --> 28:02.160
Does it hurt?

28:02.160 --> 28:03.400
Did you cry a little?

28:03.400 --> 28:05.620
It seems people did not like it very much.

28:05.620 --> 28:08.520
People were not very happy about that.

28:08.520 --> 28:11.240
All for odds, less than thrilled.

28:11.240 --> 28:13.360
Yeah, hmm.

28:13.360 --> 28:14.880
I mean, they're promising, though.

28:14.880 --> 28:19.320
They're promising a very, very positive and potentially lucrative future, though, now

28:19.320 --> 28:21.720
that they got all the rest figured out and they got everything dialed in.

28:21.720 --> 28:26.840
Now the next version of Windows 10 or whatever is going to be called is, you know, Windows

28:26.840 --> 28:27.840
Sun Valley.

28:27.840 --> 28:29.320
It's going to be rocking for developers.

28:29.320 --> 28:31.240
I mean, what do you suppose he's inferring?

28:31.240 --> 28:34.600
I think what they're going for, right, is and I've had some good experience, too, because

28:34.600 --> 28:38.480
I mean, shout out to the folks that I think they call themselves WhiteFounder now, but

28:38.480 --> 28:44.880
the Penguin WSL distro for Windows 10, like Windows as a host OS for your development

28:44.880 --> 28:48.360
box is actually kind of good now.

28:48.360 --> 28:55.640
I mean, it's not pop OS good or, you know, I mean, nothing is M1 good, so sorry, Alexi.

28:55.640 --> 28:57.480
But I think that's what he means.

28:57.480 --> 29:02.320
But honestly, you're going to be deploying to Linux because it's a superior server operating

29:02.320 --> 29:05.360
system and Windows licenses are a waste of time on the server.

29:05.360 --> 29:06.360
True, true.

29:06.360 --> 29:09.000
Oh, and let's not talk about that at all.

29:09.000 --> 29:13.960
Windows 10 was released July 29th, 2015, and they have a Windows focused event coming up

29:13.960 --> 29:19.760
this year in June where they are supposedly going to reveal more of this new overhauled

29:19.760 --> 29:26.320
Windows with, I guess, some some visual updates that are taking elements from the now defunct

29:26.320 --> 29:31.240
Windows 10 X and going to integrate it into the whatever the next version of Windows is.

29:31.240 --> 29:37.200
Satya says it'll be the biggest update to Windows in a decade, and no one cares, really,

29:37.200 --> 29:42.080
you know, it's like, OK, I'm sorry, a butterfly flew by and I forgot what you said.

29:42.080 --> 29:43.080
I know.

29:43.080 --> 29:44.080
I wonder.

29:44.080 --> 29:45.080
I wonder what they could do.

29:45.080 --> 29:49.640
I mean, he really laid it on thick that it's going to be about making developers and creators

29:49.640 --> 29:53.200
that use those two two things in one sentence.

29:53.200 --> 29:57.240
Developers and creators are going to be able to make more money on Windows is basically

29:57.240 --> 29:58.240
what it sounds like.

29:58.240 --> 30:00.600
I don't know about that.

30:00.600 --> 30:01.880
I guess we will see.

30:01.880 --> 30:06.380
Also, they've released their I guess they will be releasing a developer kit.

30:06.380 --> 30:07.380
It's coming this summer.

30:07.380 --> 30:11.720
I think there's a few people that have it in beta, a ARM developer kit for Windows,

30:11.720 --> 30:16.600
which is it looks like a new take on doing Windows on ARM that may actually work this

30:16.600 --> 30:17.600
time.

30:17.600 --> 30:19.060
But I even hesitate to even say that.

30:19.060 --> 30:21.480
But it's it's a Snapdragon developer kit.

30:21.480 --> 30:23.480
So it's coming from Sam or Qualcomm.

30:23.480 --> 30:27.640
It's coming with a Qualcomm processor in it, not Samsung Qualcomm processor in it.

30:27.640 --> 30:34.240
And it'll be the you know, the platform that people will use for the next version of Windows

30:34.240 --> 30:35.400
on ARM.

30:35.400 --> 30:42.360
I I try to I try to be interested, but I just I guess I just I feel like this this has shipped

30:42.360 --> 30:47.120
like it seems like Windows is clearly the x86 general computing platform for desktop

30:47.120 --> 30:48.120
and

30:48.120 --> 30:49.120
All right.

30:49.120 --> 30:52.200
So in certain spaces, this is kind of a thing.

30:52.200 --> 30:54.120
I was a little excited about the Qualcomm.

30:54.120 --> 30:55.600
Oh, is it OK now?

30:55.600 --> 31:00.480
But there's very specific spaces and where I can use like an embedded Linux or like it

31:00.480 --> 31:02.080
used to be Debian embedded.

31:02.080 --> 31:06.960
Now actually folks at least that I'm that hire me are moving on to Ubuntu because canonicals

31:06.960 --> 31:09.740
like fork the desktop.

31:09.740 --> 31:10.960
How about the enterprise?

31:10.960 --> 31:12.800
And that seems to be going well for them.

31:12.800 --> 31:16.520
So business and notice I'm censoring myself all the good place.

31:16.520 --> 31:21.320
Drew actually took me to the woodshed and he had his his fraternity paddle.

31:21.320 --> 31:27.160
So wow, you know, he must have if he did that, if he took time out of moving, you know, most

31:27.160 --> 31:28.160
of it.

31:28.160 --> 31:30.200
Well, he put the holes in it to make it really aerodynamic.

31:30.200 --> 31:32.200
You got to get a nice thing.

31:32.200 --> 31:34.600
It was almost like a million like Thor was sending me.

31:34.600 --> 31:37.980
So yeah, he's got a strong, you know, he's got strong forearms, you know, you wouldn't

31:37.980 --> 31:38.980
expect it.

31:38.980 --> 31:40.340
But he's got those Nordic genes, too.

31:40.340 --> 31:43.500
So I feel like they're I don't know, like, is he the last son of Asgard?

31:43.500 --> 31:47.180
I'm not saying that, but I think people in the IRC should start talking about that.

31:47.180 --> 31:49.920
So I know we wonder, I know we do.

31:49.920 --> 31:54.660
Apple wonders if Microsoft is using Epic in this legal battle.

31:54.660 --> 31:59.720
This is a little juicy nugget that came out in a filing that Apple made asking the judge

31:59.720 --> 32:06.720
to make, quote, an adverse credibility finding against Lori Wright, an Xbox executive in

32:06.720 --> 32:07.720
there.

32:07.720 --> 32:09.020
Apple kind of lays it all out.

32:09.020 --> 32:13.440
It's essentially this thing saying you got to disqualify this witness because they have

32:13.440 --> 32:19.760
a axe to grind and they claim that a reasonable observer might wonder whether Epic is serving

32:19.760 --> 32:24.300
as a stalking horse for Microsoft, Microsoft.

32:24.300 --> 32:25.780
This is a quote from Apple.

32:25.780 --> 32:30.740
Microsoft shield itself from meaningful discovery in this litigation by not appearing as a party

32:30.740 --> 32:33.640
or sending a corporate representative to testify.

32:33.640 --> 32:39.740
But Apple claims as many witnesses associated with Microsoft testified as did witnesses

32:39.740 --> 32:40.900
associated with Epic.

32:40.900 --> 32:48.080
In other words, nearly as many Microsoft employees testified as actual Epic employees testified.

32:48.080 --> 32:53.380
And Apple complains that Microsoft intentionally withheld internal communications and discussions

32:53.380 --> 32:56.820
with Epic that were requested for the trial.

32:56.820 --> 33:00.740
And Apple says such internal communications were particularly relevant in light of Microsoft's

33:00.740 --> 33:05.620
relationship with at least five epic witnesses and the potential that Microsoft is using

33:05.620 --> 33:13.540
Epic as a proxy plaintiff in litigation that it refuses to prosecute in its own name.

33:13.540 --> 33:14.940
They're claiming proxy war.

33:14.940 --> 33:15.940
Yeah.

33:15.940 --> 33:16.940
We're in Vietnam again.

33:16.940 --> 33:17.940
Isn't this wild?

33:17.940 --> 33:18.940
Yeah.

33:18.940 --> 33:19.940
Does it kind of make sense?

33:19.940 --> 33:20.940
I don't know.

33:20.940 --> 33:21.940
I mean, not really.

33:21.940 --> 33:24.740
Apple is a pretty sober company when it comes to this legal stuff.

33:24.740 --> 33:28.020
I don't I mean, I don't think they just randomly make this up.

33:28.020 --> 33:29.020
All right.

33:29.020 --> 33:30.020
Then what does Microsoft gain?

33:30.020 --> 33:32.300
Well, the office subscriptions on iOS.

33:32.300 --> 33:34.620
I mean, the obvious thing, of course.

33:34.620 --> 33:35.620
Well, yeah.

33:35.620 --> 33:39.960
And when you look at it from the from the view of it was like Xbox employees that were

33:39.960 --> 33:47.220
testifying, maybe Microsoft sees the iOS platform as taking, you know, playtime away from the

33:47.220 --> 33:48.220
Xbox.

33:48.220 --> 33:50.220
I'm not sure.

33:50.220 --> 33:55.160
Maybe they feel like they have to break Apple's monopoly on on, you know, the App Store payment

33:55.160 --> 33:58.380
system in order to bring their own services and be competitive.

33:58.380 --> 34:04.380
I mean, X Cloud would be like the obvious answer, but I don't know, man.

34:04.380 --> 34:07.260
Doesn't it seem like a bit much to you?

34:07.260 --> 34:08.260
I don't know.

34:08.260 --> 34:09.260
I don't know.

34:09.260 --> 34:11.420
I mean, yes.

34:11.420 --> 34:16.220
But the fact that so many Microsoft employees did testify and there was some other Microsoft

34:16.220 --> 34:20.020
connections that came out earlier that kind of were a little iffy.

34:20.020 --> 34:22.200
It does make one wonder.

34:22.200 --> 34:26.380
It kind of made me think if this is true, it's like the bad old Microsoft of days yore

34:26.380 --> 34:27.380
that is back.

34:27.380 --> 34:31.300
But doing it on the DL, you know, that's what it suggests to me.

34:31.300 --> 34:32.300
If it's true.

34:32.300 --> 34:33.840
To what end?

34:33.840 --> 34:37.340
Like X Cloud makes just a ton of sense to me.

34:37.340 --> 34:39.900
Yeah, but I don't know.

34:39.900 --> 34:45.080
I mean, I try to follow the business side of these companies and granted as much as

34:45.080 --> 34:50.420
people say I'm a shill because I like WSL, I I'm not I don't follow Microsoft quite

34:50.420 --> 34:51.420
that closely.

34:51.420 --> 34:57.200
But my impression is that like it's all about Azure and like Xbox is just not like they're

34:57.200 --> 34:59.020
not going to war over Xbox.

34:59.020 --> 35:01.660
I'm sorry, but it's I wouldn't think so.

35:01.660 --> 35:05.740
Then again, you know, if Apple acts like a vacuum in the tech space, sucking all the

35:05.740 --> 35:08.860
air out of the room, maybe Microsoft feels like they got to take them down a notch or

35:08.860 --> 35:11.380
two to make some money in a segment.

35:11.380 --> 35:14.460
But I would like anybody to take them down a notch or two.

35:14.460 --> 35:17.700
Like, Chris, can we just like fly Lady Joops into there?

35:17.700 --> 35:22.500
The funny thing about this epic trial, everybody, everybody talked about what a rock star team

35:22.500 --> 35:24.460
the epic lawyers were.

35:24.460 --> 35:26.220
And so I tuned in a couple of times.

35:26.220 --> 35:27.460
They got rolled.

35:27.460 --> 35:29.580
They were clowns, man.

35:29.580 --> 35:32.940
They said like they sounded unprofessional.

35:32.940 --> 35:37.880
They even sometimes like didn't appropriately address the judge and got a correction, like

35:37.880 --> 35:39.820
basic court decorum stuff.

35:39.820 --> 35:41.900
And then they didn't seem very organized.

35:41.900 --> 35:46.220
And then at the very beginning of the trial, they tried to pull all these crazy delay tactics

35:46.220 --> 35:50.020
and they tried to make all of these extra exceptions because of covid that basically

35:50.020 --> 35:54.900
Apple's legal team just argued were just B.S. and the judge agreed.

35:54.900 --> 35:56.420
And it was pathetic.

35:56.420 --> 35:57.900
And everybody's talking about a rock star team.

35:57.900 --> 35:58.900
They are.

35:58.900 --> 36:02.460
And so I wonder the only thing I could think of is like, what does Microsoft have to lose

36:02.460 --> 36:03.460
here?

36:03.460 --> 36:04.460
Right.

36:04.460 --> 36:07.500
Like they they give the insurgents a little bit of ammo and communication utilities and

36:07.500 --> 36:09.420
say, go on, go fight the empire.

36:09.420 --> 36:12.540
But I would I would definitely suggest a different term than insurgents.

36:12.540 --> 36:15.820
But, OK, you just keep rolling the way you know what I mean?

36:15.820 --> 36:19.500
Like, you know what I'm saying, though, it's like maybe to them it's such a low cost to

36:19.500 --> 36:24.260
just, you know, send off a few employees and maybe give them a little legal advice or dedicate

36:24.260 --> 36:26.800
a few lawyers of Microsoft's team to them.

36:26.800 --> 36:30.780
It's such a small cost to help them go up against the big empire that's sucking all

36:30.780 --> 36:32.780
of the money out of the system.

36:32.780 --> 36:37.500
It's possible it's possible or it's a it's a clever legal legal trick by Apple's team

36:37.500 --> 36:41.100
to just like, I don't know, just make everybody look somewhere else.

36:41.100 --> 36:43.100
One of those seems a lot more likely than the others.

36:43.100 --> 36:49.940
But I think we're because we're dangerously close to rolling into my my WBC predictions

36:49.940 --> 36:54.940
because it's closely related, but oh.

36:54.940 --> 36:59.400

38:20.460 --> 38:23.000
So WWDC is next week.

38:23.000 --> 38:24.320
It's on Monday.

38:24.320 --> 38:27.820
The keynote will be at 10 a.m. Pacific time, Monday, June 7th.

38:27.820 --> 38:31.380
And I am planning to do a mystery science leader style watch along where I give light

38:31.380 --> 38:32.380
commentary.

38:32.380 --> 38:34.700
I may or may not do that.

38:34.700 --> 38:35.700
Sometimes it doesn't work out.

38:35.700 --> 38:38.540
But I'm right now I'm planning to JBLive.TV to do that Monday at 10 a.m.

38:38.540 --> 38:39.540
Pacific.

38:39.540 --> 38:40.540
All right.

38:40.540 --> 38:44.060
So we know we're going to get we know we know we're going to get software updates.

38:44.060 --> 38:46.540
We're going to get Apple boasting about how incredible they are.

38:46.540 --> 38:50.500
But so I'm wondering if you thought of anything or you expect anything that we haven't really,

38:50.500 --> 38:53.940
you know, seen out there floating around or what is not just common to expect from an

38:53.940 --> 38:55.100
event like this?

38:55.100 --> 38:56.100
Not to flip the script on you.

38:56.100 --> 39:00.420
I want to say what I wrote a whole blog post on Dominic M.com and I haven't blogged in

39:00.420 --> 39:01.580
some time.

39:01.580 --> 39:03.620
I'm getting back to the real world now.

39:03.620 --> 39:06.180
And I have a sexy new design on my website, by the way.

39:06.180 --> 39:07.180
So check it out.

39:07.180 --> 39:08.180
Oh, I'm going to go check it out.

39:08.180 --> 39:10.260
It's very the Mad Botter branded.

39:10.260 --> 39:12.980
So I'm going to say what we're not going to get.

39:12.980 --> 39:16.980
I don't think we're getting AR glasses, AR meaning augmented reality for folks who aren't

39:16.980 --> 39:17.980
in the know.

39:17.980 --> 39:18.980
All right.

39:18.980 --> 39:19.980
I'm with you on this.

39:19.980 --> 39:25.780
We're not getting major concessions on developer freedom in terms of, you know, not having

39:25.780 --> 39:31.580
to be approved by Apple, Apple's cut updates, trials, things like that.

39:31.580 --> 39:33.420
I think it's basic.

39:33.420 --> 39:36.340
There might be like some small gesture, but we're not getting anything.

39:36.340 --> 39:37.580
And I think that's all table stakes.

39:37.580 --> 39:41.500
And unless Chris, unless you think I'm crazy, I think we should just jump away from that.

39:41.500 --> 39:45.720
I mean, I think it's so awkward if they don't address some of this stuff that's come out

39:45.720 --> 39:48.260
around this space, especially during the epic trial.

39:48.260 --> 39:49.260
OK.

39:49.260 --> 39:50.500
So what do you think they would do then?

39:50.500 --> 39:55.460
I wonder if they would if they don't go all in on talking about how much money they make

39:55.460 --> 39:58.940
for developers and the amount of new developers they've created.

39:58.940 --> 40:00.580
Well, they do that every year.

40:00.580 --> 40:04.380
I'm talking about something actionable, like a change in policy.

40:04.380 --> 40:05.820
I guess I kind of agree.

40:05.820 --> 40:09.420
I could I could I'm thinking about the commentary afterwards and I could see people going, oh,

40:09.420 --> 40:11.660
they didn't even they didn't even address it.

40:11.660 --> 40:12.660
They're so arrogant.

40:12.660 --> 40:13.900
They didn't even touch on it.

40:13.900 --> 40:14.900
Like I could see that.

40:14.900 --> 40:16.100
So I think I'm with you.

40:16.100 --> 40:17.720
They're not even going to make a concession.

40:17.720 --> 40:20.460
Like even though they should, it's like, you know, they're not going to.

40:20.460 --> 40:23.460
They're not going to introduce sideloading and they're not going to introduce alternative

40:23.460 --> 40:24.460
payments.

40:24.460 --> 40:25.880
That's not going to happen.

40:25.880 --> 40:32.340
So my longest shot bet as a concession to developers is going to be iPad, OS, which

40:32.340 --> 40:34.460
I mean, I hate that they call it iPad.

40:34.460 --> 40:40.580
It's it's goddammit, it's iOS interprocess enablement, which is my kind of PC way of

40:40.580 --> 40:47.100
saying basically, you know, just like we have in Unix and Windows and basically everything

40:47.100 --> 40:51.380
interprocess communications, i.e. apps can talk to each other in an unfettered way at

40:51.380 --> 40:52.380
the developer level.

40:52.380 --> 40:53.460
Oh, that'd be good.

40:53.460 --> 40:57.980
Not using crazy ass URL schemes, which I know they have and someone will write in.

40:57.980 --> 41:04.380
I feel like this is my longest shot prediction because it does enable a certain kind of,

41:04.380 --> 41:08.820
you know, I'm Microsoft and I have this suite of apps and they all talk to each other directly

41:08.820 --> 41:10.820
rather than through a server.

41:10.820 --> 41:12.400
But that would be awesome for users.

41:12.400 --> 41:18.860
That would definitely enable a bunch of, quote, you know, production power user workflows.

41:18.860 --> 41:20.100
They've got to do something here.

41:20.100 --> 41:22.140
They've got to because of the new iPad Pro hardware.

41:22.140 --> 41:27.420
If they do something here and mark it down, people who are going to troll me, I will do

41:27.420 --> 41:32.660
an iPad app if they do this, because this is one of the main things holding me back.

41:32.660 --> 41:35.740
And it's one of the main things holding back the purchase of a more powerful iPad.

41:35.740 --> 41:42.060
I have a 2018 iPad Pro and I have I mean, I'm sure an M1 with a fancy ass screen.

41:42.060 --> 41:43.060
Sure.

41:43.060 --> 41:44.060
I ordered one of those.

41:44.060 --> 41:46.180
I should have it in a few weeks and I will be reviewing.

41:46.180 --> 41:47.620
Yeah, the new iPad Pro.

41:47.620 --> 41:48.620
I ordered the 11 inch.

41:48.620 --> 41:52.260
Yeah, I mean, you've got to be assuming that because I even I even read, although I don't

41:52.260 --> 41:55.380
know if it's true because I only read it from one source, that iOS can even take advantage

41:55.380 --> 41:57.780
of 16 gigs of RAM that they're shipping these things.

41:57.780 --> 42:02.620
If you get the depending on how you configure it with 16 gigs of RAM, that iOS only addresses

42:02.620 --> 42:03.620
like I guess less than that.

42:03.620 --> 42:07.700
I don't know if it's true or not, but if these kinds of limitations are there, but like the

42:07.700 --> 42:12.780
inner process communication and memory limitations, it's just obvious they're going to do something

42:12.780 --> 42:13.780
with it.

42:13.780 --> 42:15.180
But what and will it be enough?

42:15.180 --> 42:16.180
That's really the question.

42:16.180 --> 42:17.180
All right.

42:17.180 --> 42:18.180
My position.

42:18.180 --> 42:21.260
I mean, we've been doing these shows since never mind.

42:21.260 --> 42:23.580
We're going to feel old for a while.

42:23.580 --> 42:24.580
Yeah.

42:24.580 --> 42:27.980
And my whole thing about iPad has always been it is not a hardware limitation.

42:27.980 --> 42:30.860
It's a policy and software limitation.

42:30.860 --> 42:35.700
But this year, I don't know, with the epic trial, with just the massive amount of power

42:35.700 --> 42:40.580
they're putting in these iPads now, I did buy one on spec thinking, damn it, I want

42:40.580 --> 42:41.580
my Star Trek tablet.

42:41.580 --> 42:43.580
That's all I want.

42:43.580 --> 42:44.580
Yeah.

42:44.580 --> 42:45.580
Yeah.

42:45.580 --> 42:46.580
Yeah.

42:46.580 --> 42:51.660
I mean, if they made it powerful enough, I if anything would happen to my 2018 iPad

42:51.660 --> 42:52.700
Pro, I would replace it.

42:52.700 --> 42:54.860
And I admit it as a happy Linux user.

42:54.860 --> 42:58.580
I admit that I use the shit out of my iPad Pro when I'm traveling.

42:58.580 --> 43:03.180
It is such a killer mobile work machine and I have used it every single day of this trip.

43:03.180 --> 43:04.540
And it's a monster.

43:04.540 --> 43:08.500
And also now over time, finally, I've got a couple of games on the thing that I actually

43:08.500 --> 43:09.540
enjoy, too.

43:09.540 --> 43:13.160
So for me, it is one of my best productivity machines.

43:13.160 --> 43:14.160
It's always reliable.

43:14.160 --> 43:15.160
It's always fast.

43:15.160 --> 43:18.300
It has its own dedicated Internet connection, which is great sometimes like I'm using it

43:18.300 --> 43:19.700
right now.

43:19.700 --> 43:23.780
I am using it right now as I I have a touch screen mixer control.

43:23.780 --> 43:29.780
I am I am using wire guard on the iPad to connect back to the Jupiter Broadcasting Studio

43:29.780 --> 43:34.580
in Seattle, and I am physically moving the sliders on the mixer using a touch screen

43:34.580 --> 43:35.860
control on my iPad.

43:35.860 --> 43:39.420
And I just have it here on a stand in front of me that's above my local mixer.

43:39.420 --> 43:43.260
So I have the remote studio mixer on my screen and I have my local mixer.

43:43.260 --> 43:45.400
And it's it's great for that kind of stuff.

43:45.400 --> 43:48.140
And I don't want a machine there because I need something that fits in a little stupid

43:48.140 --> 43:49.140
stand and it's silent.

43:49.140 --> 43:53.620
And so, you know, they're making a good tool, but it's just not good enough yet.

43:53.620 --> 43:56.060
So, God, man, I mean, it's a long shot.

43:56.060 --> 44:00.860
What you're talking about, they'd essentially have to create some sort of messaging bus

44:00.860 --> 44:05.940
that would be some kind of blessed messaging system that Apple allows.

44:05.940 --> 44:10.240
And I bet it even then be like a limited set of what you could actually use this bus for.

44:10.240 --> 44:12.580
But it's just BSD under the hoods, man.

44:12.580 --> 44:16.060
This already exists like they just have to not block it.

44:16.060 --> 44:17.060
I know.

44:17.060 --> 44:19.300
So I'm so that was my long shot.

44:19.300 --> 44:21.460
My easy shot is Swift concurrency.

44:21.460 --> 44:24.760
Now it's easy because I follow Swift evolution.

44:24.760 --> 44:27.380
And I'm not going to go too deep into this because I know our audience doesn't really

44:27.380 --> 44:28.780
give a crap about Swift.

44:28.780 --> 44:32.500
And frankly, you shouldn't because Objective C is in every way a better language.

44:32.500 --> 44:36.140
And if you're too stupid to understand how to handle memory, you deserve not to be a

44:36.140 --> 44:37.140
programmer.

44:37.140 --> 44:38.140
So you're burned.

44:38.140 --> 44:42.260
Basically, it simplifies dealing with concurrency slash we used to call it threading in the

44:42.260 --> 44:43.260
battle days.

44:43.260 --> 44:45.340
But we don't call it that anymore because reasons.

44:45.340 --> 44:47.900
All right, moving on.

44:47.900 --> 44:53.180
Swift UI is greater than combine and by this I am stealing a little bit from Casey List.

44:53.180 --> 44:54.980
I think combine is in trouble.

44:54.980 --> 45:02.820
I you know, if you follow the releases over the last year in 2020 when combine was released

45:02.820 --> 45:08.220
in 2019, Swift UI is definitely the favored child.

45:08.220 --> 45:10.300
And yes, yeah, I agree.

45:10.300 --> 45:17.320
And I understand that combine does work with Swift UI some, but that's not necessary.

45:17.320 --> 45:23.900
If I was a pure iOS developer and I'm going to talk about that in a minute, I would not

45:23.900 --> 45:25.660
be betting on combine right now.

45:25.660 --> 45:27.940
I would be Swift UI all the way.

45:27.940 --> 45:29.500
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

45:29.500 --> 45:30.500
I think you're right.

45:30.500 --> 45:33.980
And also, I know this sounds silly, especially after what you just said about Swift.

45:33.980 --> 45:38.720
But I think when the Internet sees and developers that are coming into the ecosystem see Swift

45:38.720 --> 45:42.500
attached to something, they're just going to be that that branding alone is what's going

45:42.500 --> 45:43.500
to draw them.

45:43.500 --> 45:44.500
Just branding.

45:44.500 --> 45:46.060
I know it seems silly, but that works.

45:46.060 --> 45:50.340
Yeah, it's also Swift UI is like very, very webby.

45:50.340 --> 45:52.580
No, I don't mean that as an insult.

45:52.580 --> 45:57.220
If you're familiar at all with like web development stuff, it kind of makes more sense.

45:57.220 --> 46:02.980
Now combine, if you're familiar with React, Reactive, whatever, ReactJS, Reactive, CocoRx,

46:02.980 --> 46:04.940
whatever the hell they call it, fine.

46:04.940 --> 46:09.260
But there are more people who are used to like web development, like regular sane web

46:09.260 --> 46:12.800
development than there are with reactive programming, right?

46:12.800 --> 46:16.260
My opinions on reactive programming are well documented on this program.

46:16.260 --> 46:19.340
So we don't need to go into that.

46:19.340 --> 46:22.340
I think your biggest bet here is the iPad stuff.

46:22.340 --> 46:24.040
I think you're right, though.

46:24.040 --> 46:28.680
But do you think this is going to with the with Swift UI and sort of this this obvious

46:28.680 --> 46:33.260
favorite child thing, there's no material result up on stage from Apple.

46:33.260 --> 46:35.940
It just sort of it just sort of becomes the way it is.

46:35.940 --> 46:38.620
I'm going to smooth out some of the rough edges on Swift UI.

46:38.620 --> 46:43.100
I mean, for me, like I have a weird perspective on this, right, because for me, the question

46:43.100 --> 46:49.100
is, is it worth it this summer to spend my time pounding out amongst all the client work

46:49.100 --> 46:53.580
I have to do a native iPad or iOS app?

46:53.580 --> 46:59.860
And that requires something, right, some sort of new API that I think I have a unique take

46:59.860 --> 47:00.860
on.

47:00.860 --> 47:01.860
Right.

47:01.860 --> 47:04.580
Some something new that you could take advantage of that wasn't available before that would

47:04.580 --> 47:07.620
be interesting and compelling to customers.

47:07.620 --> 47:08.620
Right.

47:08.620 --> 47:12.460
That that warrants the risk and the time and the possibility of Apple just saying no, right?

47:12.460 --> 47:15.100
Like, I don't really care if there's going to be new Mac pros.

47:15.100 --> 47:16.100
I don't know.

47:16.100 --> 47:17.100
I think that's all fine.

47:17.100 --> 47:18.100
Really?

47:18.100 --> 47:19.100
I was wondering.

47:19.100 --> 47:21.620
Yeah, it seems like if not in June, then in the fall.

47:21.620 --> 47:22.620
Right.

47:22.620 --> 47:23.620
It's going to happen.

47:23.620 --> 47:24.620
Do you know what I do care about, though?

47:24.620 --> 47:25.620
Hmm.

47:25.620 --> 47:26.620
What's that?

47:26.620 --> 47:29.420
A configurable keyboard.

47:29.420 --> 47:30.820
System Seventy six dot com.

47:30.820 --> 47:33.340
The new launch keyboard is here.

47:33.340 --> 47:36.180
Go design and buy yours today.

47:36.180 --> 47:37.760
System Seventy six dot com.

47:37.760 --> 47:42.900
The launch configurable keyboard is engineered to be comfortable, fully customizable and

47:42.900 --> 47:45.820
make your workflow even more efficient.

47:45.820 --> 47:50.980
It has a huge amount of customization options to make it flexible to your needs.

47:50.980 --> 47:53.780
This is the Cadillac of keyboards.

47:53.780 --> 47:55.460
You've wanted something nice in your life.

47:55.460 --> 47:58.900
And let's be honest, you got to touch your keyboard all the time.

47:58.900 --> 48:02.420
It's something you're physically interacting with and it's something you're looking at

48:02.420 --> 48:03.420
all the time.

48:03.420 --> 48:07.180
And putting something special on that desk is going to make all of the difference.

48:07.180 --> 48:11.340
And then, of course, you're taking control back into your hands with the launch keyboard.

48:11.340 --> 48:15.760
You can configure multiple layers to your liking and the launch has three cap sizes

48:15.760 --> 48:18.420
that give you a lot of configuration options.

48:18.420 --> 48:23.260
I went for the slightly quieter key caps on my keyboard, which is going to be arriving

48:23.260 --> 48:25.620
soon and I can't wait to tell you guys about it.

48:25.620 --> 48:29.760
But one of the things I'm looking forward to do with my launch once I get it is use

48:29.760 --> 48:34.340
it as an editing tool to take advantage of some of the layers and they have this beautiful

48:34.340 --> 48:38.280
piece of software they've designed that allows you to adjust the hardware functions.

48:38.280 --> 48:42.620
And then it saves that back to the keyboard and you can then go plug in another machine

48:42.620 --> 48:46.100
and all that stuff you set up via software is in the keyboard firmware.

48:46.100 --> 48:47.860
I love that.

48:47.860 --> 48:53.680
And in addition to just being a fantastic keyboard, it's also a super fast USB hub with

48:53.680 --> 48:55.820
USB-C ports and USB-A ports.

48:55.820 --> 49:00.220
You can transfer like a terabyte of video footage in 15 minutes through the keyboard

49:00.220 --> 49:01.220
hub.

49:01.220 --> 49:05.700
That's going to be so useful in the studio because the PC that I have is way, way, way,

49:05.700 --> 49:06.700
way far away.

49:06.700 --> 49:11.100
Like, I got to get all these extender cables when I want to hook up USB devices and now,

49:11.100 --> 49:13.500
now I'm just going to plug them right into the keyboard.

49:13.500 --> 49:17.100
Yeah, this is going to be my studio keyboard and I can't wait.

49:17.100 --> 49:21.980
It's handcrafted in Denver and it's made with love by the System76 team and that's pretty

49:21.980 --> 49:22.980
special too.

49:22.980 --> 49:26.500
So go check out the launch and see if you want to get one for yourself.

49:26.500 --> 49:30.500
It's a beautiful keyboard and it's built like nothing you've ever seen before.

49:30.500 --> 49:36.700
Go check it out at System76.com and a huge congratulations to System76 for the launch

49:36.700 --> 49:41.640
of the launch System76.com.

49:41.640 --> 49:44.980
You know, Mike, as I am on the road right now, I'm already kind of planning the next

49:44.980 --> 49:51.900
road trip and I think if I can get joops all fixed up and ready to go in time in mid-ish

49:51.900 --> 49:56.500
early, mid-early August timeframe, I think I'm going to make a trip to Denver and I am

49:56.500 --> 50:01.140
tempted to do a meetup like a, like a get a JB meetup that we haven't done in forever

50:01.140 --> 50:03.360
because of the pandemic.

50:03.360 --> 50:07.860
And also I'm hoping to go see Drew, editor of the show and Mr. Cheese Bacon also is going

50:07.860 --> 50:10.200
to be in the Denver area very soon.

50:10.200 --> 50:13.380
And I'm hoping to get out to System76 and go see how they build the launch keyboard.

50:13.380 --> 50:16.460
Though I haven't actually mentioned that yet.

50:16.460 --> 50:20.300
So I'm hoping it's going to be quite a cool Denver trip in like the August timeframe.

50:20.300 --> 50:25.340
So I wanted to let people know that if you're going to be in the area, I'm probably, I'm

50:25.340 --> 50:27.660
probably going to make more official announcements soon.

50:27.660 --> 50:29.660
So this is just like an early, hey, heads up.

50:29.660 --> 50:34.940
If you're in the Denver area, like, Oh, I don't know the week of the 16th, we can maybe

50:34.940 --> 50:36.580
do a meetup around then or something.

50:36.580 --> 50:40.900
So let me know, send me an email if that is your thing and I'll start putting something

50:40.900 --> 50:43.660
together and I'll probably eventually make an official meetup post about it and let you

50:43.660 --> 50:47.060
know here on the show, you know, you and the kitchen fly out, come hang out with Drew and

50:47.060 --> 50:48.060
I.

50:48.060 --> 50:49.060
Sounds like fun.

50:49.060 --> 50:50.060
You know, just wear masks the entire time.

50:50.060 --> 50:51.060
That's the only thing.

50:51.060 --> 50:52.940
It's like, I don't know how the kid would do with that.

50:52.940 --> 50:54.220
The kids, you know, they're all right.

50:54.220 --> 50:55.220
My kids are right with it.

50:55.220 --> 50:58.340
Like when we go into a store, several hour flight, I'm not so sure.

50:58.340 --> 50:59.340
Yeah.

50:59.340 --> 51:00.340
My Reese is basically bang.

51:00.340 --> 51:01.780
He, you know, no one cared.

51:01.780 --> 51:06.340
He said, Oh, I put on the mask or a welcome good.

51:06.340 --> 51:07.340
That makes it easier.

51:07.340 --> 51:08.340
Yeah.

51:08.340 --> 51:09.340
I try to have fun with it.

51:09.340 --> 51:10.340
It does make it easier.

51:10.340 --> 51:12.460
I mean, he did snap in half the Batman stuffed animal I gave him.

51:12.460 --> 51:14.820
He kind of put it over his knee, but I will let that go.

51:14.820 --> 51:17.980
Just make sure he doesn't go around saying he was born in the dark cause then you know

51:17.980 --> 51:18.980
he's turning.

51:18.980 --> 51:23.180
He did say something about liberating black gate prison, but I just sort of took his juice

51:23.180 --> 51:24.180
box away.

51:24.180 --> 51:25.180
I don't know.

51:25.180 --> 51:26.180
There you go.

51:26.180 --> 51:27.180
Yeah.

51:27.180 --> 51:28.300
You get them off the juice and they they'll do a lot better.

51:28.300 --> 51:32.580
My kids, my damn kids snuck out and got themselves candy for the road trip.

51:32.580 --> 51:35.500
You know, cause now they're old enough where they can, they can do that.

51:35.500 --> 51:41.580
And a boy, boy, Oh boy, is that a bad combination is three sugar high kids in a, in an RV going

51:41.580 --> 51:42.580
down the road.

51:42.580 --> 51:43.580
Let me tell you.

51:43.580 --> 51:44.580
Oh yeah.

51:44.580 --> 51:45.580
I aggressively limit the sugar.

51:45.580 --> 51:46.580
Yeah.

51:46.580 --> 51:47.580
Yeah.

51:47.580 --> 51:48.580
Yeah.

51:48.580 --> 51:49.580
Yeah.

51:49.580 --> 51:50.580
Yeah.

51:50.580 --> 51:51.580
I'm like, no, I've, I've been there.

51:51.580 --> 51:52.580
I know it does.

51:52.580 --> 51:53.580
I know it does.

51:53.580 --> 51:54.980
You can go find our sponsor, a cloud guru on social media.

51:54.980 --> 51:55.980
Did you know?

51:55.980 --> 51:56.980
Go check them out.

51:56.980 --> 51:57.980
Thanks to a cloud guru.

51:57.980 --> 52:02.660
Just go over to slash a cloud guru anywhere that's basically a social media site and follow

52:02.660 --> 52:03.660
them there.

52:03.660 --> 52:04.780
You can follow Mike on Twitter.

52:04.780 --> 52:07.940
He's at Dumanuku and his company is at the mad botter ink.

52:07.940 --> 52:08.940
I'm there too.

52:08.940 --> 52:11.660
I don't tweet a lot, but I'll, I'll reply to you.

52:11.660 --> 52:15.340
I do try to reply to you and I do try to read it, but I'm just not a big tweeter, but I'm

52:15.340 --> 52:16.420
over there on the Twitters.

52:16.420 --> 52:21.980
I'm at Chris LAS and yeah, as you guessed it, the show has a Twitter too.

52:21.980 --> 52:22.980
That's real simple.

52:22.980 --> 52:23.980
It's at Coder radio show.

52:23.980 --> 52:26.340
You get news and announcements of the networks over there at Jupiter signal.

52:26.340 --> 52:29.460
If you want some links to what we talked about today, like to Mike's blog, you can go to

52:29.460 --> 52:32.960
coder.show slash four 16 while you're over there.

52:32.960 --> 52:35.700
Why not grab the feed subscribe to this year's show?

52:35.700 --> 52:36.700
Get it every week.

52:36.700 --> 52:38.100
I mean, what are you doing?

52:38.100 --> 52:39.100
You can't subscribe.

52:39.100 --> 52:40.100
Take a minute.

52:40.100 --> 52:43.020
Go subscribe and then consider joining us for a live show.

52:43.020 --> 52:47.820
We do them on Mondays at 5 p.m. Pacific, 8 p.m. Eastern over at jblive.tv and we'd love

52:47.820 --> 52:48.820
to hang out with you.

52:48.820 --> 52:49.820
Come see us.

52:49.820 --> 52:51.620
Mr. Thomas, is there anything you want to mention before we go?

52:51.620 --> 52:52.620
No.

52:52.620 --> 52:56.360
If you need any Python development done, let me know we're C++ because apparently that's

52:56.360 --> 52:57.360
what I do now.

52:57.360 --> 52:58.360
There you go.

52:58.360 --> 53:01.460
Thanks so much for joining us on this week's episode and we'll see you right back here

53:01.460 --> 53:17.020
next week.
