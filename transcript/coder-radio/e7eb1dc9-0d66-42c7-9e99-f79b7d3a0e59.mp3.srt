00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,760
This is KOTOR Radio, episode 445 for December 20th, 2021.

2
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:20,200
Hello friends and welcome in to Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show, taking a pragmatic look

3
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:24,760
at the art and the business of software development and the world of technology.

4
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:30,280
I'm old man Chris and joining me every single week is my host with a surprise, Mr. Dominic.

5
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:31,280
Hello Mike.

6
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:32,280
Hello Chris.

7
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:33,280
How are you?

8
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:34,280
I'm pretty good.

9
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:38,080
I got things I have to say, but I feel like you're kind of like in a special place.

10
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:39,640
I'm a little envious of you.

11
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:41,680
We got stuff to hash out this episode.

12
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:42,680
That's all I'm saying.

13
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:43,960
But I've been seeing some tweets.

14
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:47,520
I've been seeing some pop OS upgrade tweets.

15
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,080
I mean, you've been popping off.

16
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:50,240
I've been popping off.

17
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:51,480
I just feel like we got to catch up.

18
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:53,440
A lot's happened since our last episode.

19
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:56,880
It feels like two weeks of stuff has happened since our last episode.

20
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:00,440
And I see you tweeting about using VMware workstation.

21
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:01,440
I'm your Linux guy.

22
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,400
I didn't know about any of this stuff.

23
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:09,240
So here's what happens when you're doing a ton, like a ton of Visual Studio work, Xamarin

24
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:14,240
forms to UWP to Android because that's my life.

25
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:19,640
And Parallels is just laggy as hell and you've got a beautiful system 76 Pangolin that you're

26
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:21,120
supposed to be reviewing.

27
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:25,680
There's like sitting sadly on your kitchen island.

28
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,800
He's giving you a look and you find out you're going to be home for a little while because

29
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:29,800
you have COVID.

30
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:30,800
Oh no.

31
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:31,800
Cheers.

32
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:32,800
Breakthrough.

33
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:33,800
Hashtag unfilter show.

34
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:34,800
Oh no.

35
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:35,800
Yeah.

36
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:40,440
I decided to say, okay, let me daily drive the Pangolin and let me see what the world's

37
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:44,040
like taking everything I do, not making any exceptions, right?

38
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,040
You know, no switching.

39
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:48,800
I actually put the iMac pro in a box in the garage.

40
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,320
That's serious commitment.

41
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:55,200
I brought out one of my old 1080, not old, but it's relatively new, but 1080P view sonic

42
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,200
monitors.

43
00:01:56,200 --> 00:02:01,120
It's just 24 inch to like use it with the Pangolin.

44
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:07,480
And one of the first things I had to do is get windows on there in a VM because for one

45
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:11,720
of my main projects right now, we're doing a windows application is Xamarin forms, but

46
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:17,880
it goes to UWP as well as Android with a flask Python backend.

47
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:20,800
So obviously it's great to have bolt systems on local host.

48
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:26,860
If you're, you know, building both the application and the rest service that was surprisingly

49
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:31,280
good compared to what I was getting on my iMac pro in terms of the performance of the

50
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,280
windows VM.

51
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:39,360
The only hiccup was parallels of somehow convinced windows to allow me to install windows 11

52
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,440
where VMware workstation windows 11 vomited.

53
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:45,520
So I installed windows 10 that's probably fine.

54
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:50,880
I guess the whole TPM, it doesn't fake it out or whatever, but honestly, I mean, I opened

55
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:51,880
windows.

56
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:56,600
I do the whole shared shared file system thing where the post OS can go into the guest OS.

57
00:02:56,600 --> 00:03:02,480
So all my command line tools, all my get all that stuff is on Linux anyway, and it's basically

58
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:07,760
an entire OS just cause I need to run visual studio and the build chain.

59
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,000
It was actually better.

60
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,520
For instance, on parallels, I had to make changes to the little XML file.

61
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:17,800
It's the app config on windows because of the where the parallels handles the file system

62
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,800
VMware workstation.

63
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:19,800
No such problem.

64
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:20,800
Okay.

65
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,800
Just to have it clear.

66
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:24,680
You were doing parallels on windows, but when you switched to Linux, you also switched to

67
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:25,680
VMware workstation.

68
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:29,040
No, I was doing parallels on Mac to run windows.

69
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,040
Oh, oh yeah.

70
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:31,040
Sure.

71
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,040
Sure.

72
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,040
Okay.

73
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,040
Gotcha.

74
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:38,640
So then I went to the Linux host, which is Papa West 2110 and just a, I got a license

75
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,240
for VM workstation pro.

76
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,240
It's beautiful.

77
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:45,600
I truly believe Linux makes such a great virtualization platform because the kernel just has like

78
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,760
all the plumbing right there.

79
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:49,960
And if you have a virtualization program that takes advantage of that or submits their own

80
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:52,800
upstream stuff, it works pretty great.

81
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:56,480
And then you get all the advantages of snapshots and all of that, but what is the price of

82
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:57,480
workstation pro?

83
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:59,480
It's gotta be like a couple of hundred bucks, right?

84
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:00,480
It's a 30 day trial.

85
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:03,200
I have no idea, but I don't remember that much sticker shock.

86
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,080
I think it's like a hundred bucks.

87
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,080
It might be a license though.

88
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:11,160
It might be an annual like see now some people in the audience are going to listen to this

89
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:13,880
and they're going to say, Oh no, just use boxes or just use vert manager.

90
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,000
It's free.

91
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,520
But I just completely disagree.

92
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:21,120
I think if workstation is working for you and it gives you a workflow that seems efficient

93
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:25,440
and you can wrap your head around and it's reproducible, it's worth the a hundred bucks.

94
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,440
It's like a no brainer.

95
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:28,760
Well, so I did actually start with boxes.

96
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:29,760
Oh really?

97
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:30,760
Okay.

98
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:32,000
And the performance was kind of lousy.

99
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Okay.

100
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,180
Like there was actual like visual tearing, but workstation, I'm sure there's ways to

101
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:40,280
configure it, but workstation pro out of the box windows ran.

102
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:47,480
I mean, I've just put it in a different workspace on pop and it is pretty much near what I would

103
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:50,160
expect from a, you know, windows laptop, right?

104
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,840
Like a lower end windows laptop.

105
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:52,840
Love that.

106
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:55,760
Not low, low end, but like, you know, the lowest thing I would buy a 16 gig laptop.

107
00:04:55,760 --> 00:05:00,880
You might also in this setup be benefiting from like a newer GPU and a newer Intel chip

108
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:04,120
with updated, you know, virtualization support and stuff.

109
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,760
So not an Intel chip though.

110
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:06,760
Right?

111
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:08,720
So the Pangolin is a whole, a pure AMD system.

112
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:09,720
Oh, okay.

113
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,720
Kind of thing though.

114
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,640
But yeah, more just, you know, newer hardware that just works better with virtualization

115
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:15,440
because before it was an older iMac, right?

116
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,800
It was an iMac pro.

117
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:17,800
Yeah.

118
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:18,800
Well, nice.

119
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:19,800
I'm glad you found it.

120
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:20,800
Good.

121
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,800
I'm looking forward to hearing more about that in the future.

122
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,600
It sounds like maybe we'll be hearing a bit of a review down the road after you've had

123
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,000
a chance to try it out for a bit.

124
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,760
I hope so.

125
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:30,160
You know, this isn't where I want the show to go and I don't really want it to be a lot

126
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:35,120
about this, but you know, just hearing you talk about getting sick again, I just, at what

127
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:41,240
point am I allowed to get really angry because this is really screwing up our industry and

128
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,480
just one of many.

129
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:46,120
And this just got really personal because we have a get together planned here at the

130
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:48,620
studio on the second.

131
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:53,200
And I think just out of an abundance of caution to watch where this thing goes, because something

132
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:56,760
that's spreading exponentially is kind of hard for us to wrap our head around.

133
00:05:56,760 --> 00:06:00,200
I think I'm going to punt that meetup to the end of January just to give us time to see

134
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,800
where things stand.

135
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:05,740
It sucks so bad because we have this whole event planned because we're moving up to Tuesdays.

136
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:08,880
We're launching our new internal server infrastructure.

137
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:12,360
You know, we wanted to have a potluck and do the whole thing, go the full nine yards

138
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:15,960
after a year and a half of no events.

139
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:21,000
And I think I got to cancel it and I got to at least move it and maybe cancel it again.

140
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,560
And you know, you're not feeling well.

141
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,560
You're back at home.

142
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:24,560
I hope you're feeling OK.

143
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,480
I just can't believe we're still in this position, man.

144
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,480
I'm getting angry.

145
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:29,440
Well, I will say this is my second.

146
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:33,400
I mean, we shouldn't turn this into the COVID show, but this is my second go around with

147
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,400
COVID.

148
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:37,960
And this time has been I had one night where I was I kind of sweat through the sheets when,

149
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:38,960
you know, not in the fun way.

150
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:39,960
Right.

151
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:40,960
How can I put it?

152
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,920
I feel like I've had a mild hangover.

153
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:43,920
Make your jokes here.

154
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:47,560
YouTube commenters for it's been a while.

155
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:50,200
I actually it turned out when we did the show last week, I already had it.

156
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,200
I just didn't know.

157
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,200
Yeah.

158
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,560
And I just got demolished like Tuesday night.

159
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,500
I was like down for two days.

160
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,840
So for the record, I'm you know, I have the vaccine.

161
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:00,200
I did the two shots.

162
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:02,520
It's too early for me to get the booster, they said.

163
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:04,000
And you had it once before.

164
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,680
And I've had it once before in which I took a stroke because I have a heart condition.

165
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:13,240
Yeah, I was very concerned when I was told that the test was positive because obviously

166
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,240
that's you know.

167
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:17,440
Yeah, it's frustrating because it's it's risking our health and it is Christmas.

168
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,440
Yep.

169
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:19,440
It's the family holidays.

170
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,680
So once again, that's all getting screwed up and canceled out again.

171
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,960
Another year or a I hope people out there are taking care of themselves and taking taking

172
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:28,640
the mental space they need, however they can, because this is getting frustrating.

173
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:33,360
And we appreciate the how it's, you know, it's worse for a lot of people out there.

174
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,720
It could be worse for us, too.

175
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:39,000
But one day we will do a live meetup and I will actually show up this time.

176
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,880
Man, I tell you what, I've been actually jonesing to get down to Florida because it's freezing

177
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:44,880
out today.

178
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:45,880
It's cold.

179
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:46,880
It's gray.

180
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:47,880
It's hot here.

181
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:52,060
Oh, well, Miami is the center of Bitcoin right now in the United States.

182
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:56,960
And Alexander writes in with an idea on how to pay open source developers.

183
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:00,160
He says, how do companies pay folks and projects for open source work?

184
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:04,520
And this is something I brought up before because I have tried as a business, Jupiter

185
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:09,820
Broadcasting, and when working with Linux Academy on multiple occasions to pay developers.

186
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:15,360
When I was part of a larger company, you couldn't just say, yes, send them a PayPal payment

187
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,360
or something like that.

188
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,360
That's not how businesses work.

189
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:23,480
They have accounting departments and they do invoices and transfers and stuff like that.

190
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,640
Well, Alexander has a solution.

191
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:26,480
He says, how about Bitcoin?

192
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:28,040
I can't believe I was thinking it.

193
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:31,440
I mean, I think Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies on the whole are less compelling than the

194
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:37,640
blockchains themselves are and just likely are just Ponzi schemes in the most cases.

195
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:42,740
But you know, I really couldn't help but realize that Bitcoin would solve this because he says

196
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:48,440
there's no middlemen, there's no PayPal, there's nothing else to say who can or can't get money.

197
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:51,200
All one needs is just a wallet, a piece of software.

198
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:55,360
I don't know how it scales with legal entities out there, but couldn't this just be a killer

199
00:08:55,360 --> 00:09:01,320
use for cryptocurrencies, large companies paying open source projects for their work?

200
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,320
What do you think, Mike?

201
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:06,280
Would you be willing to, you know, say you were younger version of you hacking on an

202
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:07,360
open source project?

203
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,640
Would you be willing to take a bit of a Bitcoin as payment?

204
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:10,640
Yeah, probably.

205
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:11,640
Why not?

206
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:12,640
Oh, what?

207
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:13,640
Hold on.

208
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:14,640
Oh, whoa.

209
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,360
I just fell out of my seat.

210
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,360
What?

211
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:23,080
I mean, after the way we hounded Web3 on this show, I thought for sure you'd come on here

212
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:28,080
and tell me to eff off and that you wouldn't even consider it now to take a fractional

213
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:31,760
Bitcoin as a payment for just open source work.

214
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:32,760
I was already doing.

215
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:33,760
Why not?

216
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,500
I mean, I'm getting nothing.

217
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:37,040
Would you hold it or would you cash it out?

218
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:41,200
I mean, I can tell you what I did.

219
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,920
Did you have Bitcoin at one point?

220
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:46,080
I did have some Bitcoin coins, plural.

221
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,080
Yeah.

222
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,080
Yeah.

223
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,300
Which today I could buy a Tesla.

224
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:53,000
I'm not saying this to brag, because I was very early in the mining when the Bitcoin

225
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:58,560
was around 25 cents, and I may have at one point held 100 Bitcoin.

226
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:02,960
Every piece of hardware that I am actively using except for the launch keyboard was paid

227
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:05,160
for with Bitcoin years ago in the studios.

228
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:10,000
So I cashed it out when it was like around 30,000 or maybe less than that, 14,000, 15,000,

229
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,240
and I basically invested it in studio gear.

230
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:16,760
I was having a really good conversation with Dave Jones from the podcast index, which I'm

231
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:21,680
going to play the entire chat in Linux Unplugged on January 9th.

232
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:27,640
We were going on and on about Web3, but he gave me a pretty solid and interesting example

233
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:30,040
for a quote unquote Web3-like technology.

234
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:33,680
Now that's not really what he calls it, but you could probably categorize it as one of

235
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:34,680
those things.

236
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:35,680
But here's what it is.

237
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,220
It's called the Hive blockchain.

238
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:41,540
It's a separate kind of version of the blockchain, but here's what's so freaking cool about it

239
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:42,600
is it rapidly updates.

240
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:47,880
I think like every three seconds or so, and you could embed a JSON payload in the blockchain.

241
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:53,120
So what you get is a decentralized message bus that's updated every three seconds and

242
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,840
anyone can check in on it and receive the messages.

243
00:10:55,840 --> 00:11:00,780
And what they're using it for at podcast index as a new decentralized way to update podcast

244
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:02,980
players when there's a new episode.

245
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:09,880
Because the issue today is that all of us have apps that are banging on the podcast

246
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:14,280
RSS feed server, you know, maybe every few minutes to see if there's a new episode.

247
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:18,080
And you're doing it for every show you have and you're doing it every time the app is

248
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:24,320
running or like in the case say Overcast or probably Pocket Cast and Apple Podcasts, there's

249
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:29,480
a backend server that's doing that scraping and then sending down like a JSON update to

250
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,480
your phone.

251
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:35,040
If you think about it, it requires something constantly refreshing an RSS feed to see if

252
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,040
there's a new episode.

253
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:38,120
That's how your podcast catcher knows.

254
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:43,880
And when you say have a hundred thousand listeners, that's a lot of people hitting your web server

255
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:46,060
just to check an XML file.

256
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:50,760
And so what they've done is they're using the Hive blockchain as a message bus to let

257
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:55,080
the podcast clients know without having to bang on each individual feed all the time.

258
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:58,880
And that's just one example of a way they can use blockchain technology in a kind of

259
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:01,040
cool decentralized database way.

260
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:04,800
But how will they get their dynamic ad insertion?

261
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:07,480
The other tech they're working on, I'll just talk about this briefly because of the rest

262
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:11,500
it's in the interview, but the other tech they're working on and they have it set up

263
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:16,200
already is using the lightning payment rails that are on top of Bitcoin.

264
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:22,000
They have it set up where you can have a podcast app that has a wallet and you throw a hundred

265
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,200
Satoshis in there, whatever it is, being a big spender.

266
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:31,140
You can configure the app theoretically to then pay out to the podcaster as you listen.

267
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:36,040
So it just pays based on how many hours you listen to that podcast, maybe a few cents

268
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:40,500
every hour, 10 cents, whatever, 50 cents, whatever you thought was appropriate.

269
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:44,760
And in the background, the app is just doing that over the lightning network and it's sort

270
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:48,680
of streaming it to the podcast host as you listen, which is an interesting, I don't know

271
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:54,520
if Bitcoin is the currency you want to use, but that idea, you know, you could set limits

272
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:59,160
say no more than $20 a month goes to the podcasters I like, but the ones that I listened to the

273
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:02,440
most that month, they're the ones that get some funding.

274
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:06,280
And you could see that kind of technology being applied in other ways.

275
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:12,480
And what's enabling it is that lightning network that makes the transactions super quick, instant

276
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:15,880
at the speed of light and does it for super cheap.

277
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:18,760
And there's no middleman taking a cut there.

278
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:24,200
It totally bypasses things like PayPal or Patreon, which means it's more censorship

279
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,200
resistant.

280
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,200
It means it's international.

281
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:29,180
It's truly, it's something that everyone in the world has access to.

282
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:30,560
It's a level playing field.

283
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,080
And that I like about it.

284
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:38,640
But I think it would really only work in countries where access to getting in and out of Bitcoin

285
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:39,680
is easy.

286
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:43,920
Like here in the States and other places, there's the cash app from Square, which just

287
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:49,440
renamed and it's so stupid simple, you wouldn't even know you're working with Bitcoin.

288
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:53,960
You just, you know, you hit buy $10, takes the money out of your checking account and

289
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:54,960
buys a Bitcoin.

290
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:58,760
And then when you sell it for $20, takes the money out of Bitcoin and transfers it back

291
00:13:58,760 --> 00:13:59,760
to your checking account.

292
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:03,320
And it's all in a UI that's so fricking simple, you just wouldn't think that's what's happening

293
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:04,320
on the back end.

294
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:07,720
But they've abstracted out all of those layers of technology, the blockchain and Bitcoin

295
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:10,700
and the payment system and all of it, the ACH transfer.

296
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:14,020
They've abstracted it all the way into this stupid easy app.

297
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:17,480
And then there's apps like Coinbase and all these others that give people around the world

298
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:20,520
access to this stuff, but it's still not ubiquitous.

299
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:24,280
But it's better than the US dollar is probably at this point in terms of access.

300
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:27,640
So maybe Alexander, but I think you'd have to get the devs to to accept it.

301
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:29,380
Like I didn't expect Mike to go with it.

302
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:31,840
So maybe more developers would know.

303
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:36,120
I actually thought I actually thought it would be a bit of an argument, but maybe people

304
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:37,120
are seeing the value.

305
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:40,980
You know, it helps when something's close to $50,000 in value.

306
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:47,740
We also talked about VR last week, metaverse and crypto currencies seem to have some connections.

307
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:52,840
And we asked if VR was was really a solution, you know, that could be used further.

308
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:53,840
And I didn't know it at the time.

309
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:58,600
But after that episode, I learned that the Home Assistant project uses Facebook's VR

310
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:03,000
meeting software for all of their meetings and they have a virtual whiteboard.

311
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:07,480
And Paulus, the head of the project, says it's great because he can view the body language

312
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:09,360
of the participants.

313
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,360
And here's the other thing.

314
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:11,920
He says it's faster.

315
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:18,120
VR meetings are faster because you're just sending the data about positioning of objects

316
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,760
and stuff and the renderings happening on your end.

317
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,380
You're not streaming the video.

318
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:25,680
You're just streaming the positional information and then an audio feed along with it.

319
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:28,800
And so he says, we don't have the issue you always have where you're talking over each

320
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:32,640
other because the latency is just that much faster.

321
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,080
So that sounds pretty compelling.

322
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:38,560
And so they're popping on these Quest headsets and they're getting in these meetings.

323
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:42,680
Well, our handsome editor, Drew, wrote in with thoughts on virtual reality says, I was

324
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:47,600
skeptical about VR at first, but I got hooked once I started playing with the Quest 2.

325
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:51,480
For those of you listening that don't know, Quest 2 is a standalone VR unit.

326
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:55,120
Runs Android and you don't need to have it hooked up to a PC, although you can get like

327
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,440
a hundred dollar cable and hook it up to a PC.

328
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:03,320
Drew continues, while I play a lot of standing action games, which are great for cardio,

329
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:06,920
there are quite a few relaxing options too, with lots of virtual environments you can

330
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:11,280
just visit and essentially with Google Earth, you can visit anything.

331
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:15,640
And besides that, I'd also recommend looking into painting and building apps.

332
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:18,520
Sounds like Drew's been getting his chill on with virtual reality.

333
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:22,760
And then the Home Assistant project says that it's made them more efficient as a remote

334
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:24,360
software development team.

335
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:28,720
They're sitting around a table again, they have a whiteboard again, their laptops and

336
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:33,120
screens are in VR, their keyboard is in the VR space, so they can actually see their keyboard,

337
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:38,240
they can see their laptop screen in the VR space, and the latency is better.

338
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:43,720
And now, so this latest version of Home Assistant that just shipped, they completely redesigned

339
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:50,760
the main configuration screen and they collaborated on all of that in this VR Horizons workspace

340
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,320
thing.

341
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:55,400
Is there actually something here finally?

342
00:16:55,400 --> 00:17:00,320
Is maybe freaking meetings one of the killer apps for virtual reality?

343
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,320
Oh, good.

344
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,920
Finally, an excuse to have more meetings.

345
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:04,720
That's exactly what we all need.

346
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:07,000
Oh, yeah, right.

347
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,600
And this time you're really trapped.

348
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:15,320
I just picture like, you know, a significant other or like a kid walking in on you two

349
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:18,800
with the VR headset strapped on and you're sitting there in like some intense meeting,

350
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:22,440
maybe even giving somebody a what for.

351
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:24,480
Wait, will the VR know if I have no pants on?

352
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,600
It might, man.

353
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:29,280
The one thing I thought about was like, well, what if we podcasted in VR?

354
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:33,320
What if we had a virtual studio, right, and you were just like essentially sitting across

355
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:36,640
from me at the table in VR?

356
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:39,480
Hmm, could be interesting.

357
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:43,680
And I could also see it for chilling out, just going to like some really peaceful beach

358
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:48,880
or something for a bit and pretending like I wasn't trapped in a gray hellscape.

359
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:53,440
What I would say is podcasting, you know, bandwidth hell is bad enough with audio.

360
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,440
Mm hmm.

361
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:55,440
Mm hmm.

362
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:58,480
I can only imagine to really produce a good VR show.

363
00:17:58,480 --> 00:17:59,880
You'd think so, right?

364
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:03,840
Although they claim since it's not streaming video, it's only streaming the positional

365
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,440
bits that it actually uses less bandwidth.

366
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:09,120
So that it just reconstructs, it basically draws on.

367
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,120
Hmm.

368
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:11,120
Yeah, it renders on each side.

369
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,680
I mean, I'd be down to try it.

370
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:13,680
I'd definitely give it a go.

371
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:18,880
The thing is, you know, I went and looked at like a Quest and the Quest 2 with the upgraded

372
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:24,040
strap and you know that you get all in there and it's like 700 bucks almost, which is the

373
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:26,920
price of the one that actually hooks up to the computer and looks great.

374
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:30,080
And then like if you want headphones to go with it, those are another hundred bucks.

375
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:34,240
And by the time you're done, it's like 800 bucks for this thing.

376
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:37,880
And it feels like if I drop 800 bucks on a Quest 2, it's next month Apple announces their

377
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:42,360
VR unit and it's going to be better because it's going to have like an M1 in it or something,

378
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:43,360
you know?

379
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:44,960
You know, they're going to do this.

380
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:49,480
It'll be like a pair of glasses that really look like glasses with like an M1 Mini Max

381
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:50,480
Pro Xeon.

382
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:51,480
Probably not Xeon, huh?

383
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:52,480
But yeah.

384
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,440
I love it.

385
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:56,800
I actually think they're going to do a VR headset first.

386
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:57,800
I do.

387
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:01,640
I think it'll have like pass through cameras, but I think the way they're going to get it

388
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,280
at first is going to be like the Quest.

389
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:08,040
Only it's going to be the iPhone version of the Quest with Apple processors and Apple

390
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:11,320
screens and probably better hand tracking.

391
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:15,200
They probably won't even bother with the controllers at first knowing Apple, especially if you

392
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,200
have the watch.

393
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:18,480
I would imagine they could really get some good tracking.

394
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:22,240
And I think, you know, they'll have faster processor and they have a better app store

395
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:25,680
and they now have Apple Arcade so they can strong arm all those developers into making

396
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:27,600
a VR version pretty quick.

397
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,600
I think it's a foregone conclusion they're going to do it.

398
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:30,600
Ah, yes.

399
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:34,440
VR across the road so you can watch your friends get splattered by a Mac truck.

400
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:37,440
How could you imagine?

401
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:43,040
Laura's death is still trauma.

402
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:44,040
Linode.com slash coder.

403
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:48,120
Go there to get one hundred dollars and sixty day credit on a new account and you go there

404
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,120
to support the show.

405
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:53,160
And you guys know that this show is made possible by you taking advantage of our sponsor offers.

406
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:57,440
And the great thing is Linode is one we can enthusiastically endorse.

407
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,600
You know, we're customers ourselves.

408
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:03,200
It all started when I met them back at Texas Linux Fest and decided I'm going to go sign

409
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,200
up.

410
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:07,320
I had recently just transitioned off a previous cloud provider.

411
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:12,440
I was between providers and in the market, if you will, and I discovered Linode.

412
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:15,640
I didn't fully appreciate at the time but now I realize it makes a difference that they've

413
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:18,160
been around since 2003.

414
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:22,160
Eighteen years they've remained an independent company that's independently funded.

415
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:26,620
They are the largest open cloud provider in the world with eleven data centers around

416
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:28,920
the world serving nearly a million customers.

417
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:32,680
But what's great is Linode's mission remains unchanged.

418
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:35,000
Their focus remains as good as ever.

419
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
They make cloud computing simple, affordable and accessible.

420
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,680
If you've been setting up servers for eighteen years or if you've just gotten into this and

421
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:47,580
you realize you need some infrastructure or maybe you realize, crap, we are just totally

422
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:52,440
dependent on one cloud provider and we need to get into some kind of multi-cloud setup,

423
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:53,440
Linode is great for you.

424
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:57,240
And you could take advantage of our hundred dollar offer to really try it out, to actually

425
00:20:57,240 --> 00:21:00,520
put it through a test and see if it works for you.

426
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:03,740
Because with a hundred dollars, you're kicking the tires for real.

427
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:07,480
It's like going to the car dealership and they let you have the car for a month before

428
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:11,280
you buy it because they're so convinced you're going to buy the car, right?

429
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:15,340
Only the great thing about Linode is they're the best in value out there.

430
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:18,840
They're literally thirty to fifty percent cheaper than the hyperscalers that want to

431
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:20,680
lock you into their platform.

432
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:22,680
And Linode still has all the good stuff.

433
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:24,800
I'd say their dashboard is easier to use.

434
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:27,860
Their API is clear and easy to understand.

435
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:31,700
They have S3 compatible object storage, which I just use the hell out of.

436
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:33,920
They're rolling out bare metal servers for those of you that need that.

437
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:39,320
They've got cloud firewalls, DDoS protection, a powerful DNS manager, super fast 40 gigabit

438
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:41,960
connections to the machines.

439
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:47,120
And then, it's like a cherry on top, they've got the best customer support out there.

440
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:51,160
And that's the part I hear about over and over and over again from the audience.

441
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:55,040
I think people's first impressions when they try out Linode is, oh man, it's fast, yeah,

442
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:56,040
Chris was right.

443
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:57,040
It is great.

444
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:58,120
This is nice.

445
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:00,440
But then, you know, you've been using it for a while.

446
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:05,080
You start depending on it and you mess something up or something goes wrong.

447
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:09,240
The fact that they have that 365 support, that first tier support, they don't punch

448
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:13,780
you to somebody else, they don't put you in a queue, they stick with you until it's solved.

449
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:16,120
That has made a difference with our listeners every single time.

450
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:19,500
But you really got to go check it out and take advantage of that $100 for yourself.

451
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:21,200
Go see what it can do for you.

Sign up today at linode.com slash coder.

453
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:29,120

454
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,120
coder.

455
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:38,380
First up, Rails 7 is here and this is the version we've all been waiting for.

456
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:43,480
I mean, this is exciting because what I'm hearing, like, the number one, like, take

457
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:48,280
it all down to one thing that I'm hearing about Rails 7, no node required.

458
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:50,840
That seems big.

459
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:51,840
Yeah.

460
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:53,000
It's so good.

461
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Yeah.

462
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,340
You don't have to have that entire NodeJS stack, which we all know that I love, and

463
00:22:58,340 --> 00:22:59,840
Ah, great.

464
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,840
This seems like a monumental release.

465
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:07,840
I mean, this feels like this is one that has caught the attention of just about everyone that has ever been in the rail space.

466
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:14,840
It's a big change, although in a weird way, it's a change, but in a lot of ways it's going back, not technically, of course,

467
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:25,840
but kind of in philosophy to the original Rails ideal, which was it is one framework, batteries included, of course, gems, blah, blah, blah.

468
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:34,840
But that one person can build a decent web application and be at least competitive on, like, an indie level, right?

469
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:39,840
And DHH, the creator of Rails, has a blog post to that effect, the one person framework,

470
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:50,840
where before its embrace of some of these more advanced, if we're going to be nice, JavaScript practices and frameworks, not so good.

471
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:57,840
In fact, I would argue that, like, doing an Angular application in a Rails application was actually harder than just separating it out

472
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:02,840
and doing, like, an Angular application completely separate from just a Rails backend.

473
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:08,840
But, of course, you lost some of the beauty of Rails, which is, like, the easy forms, the easy ERB.

474
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:09,840
I don't know what the hell happened.

475
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:16,840
I have thoughts that are a little controversial on what happened between, like, Rails 5 and 6.

476
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:23,840
Basically, the Ruby Rails community really felt they needed to chase the JavaScript hipsters.

477
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:25,840
Many of them are the JavaScript hipsters, right?

478
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:26,840
A lot of them moved on.

479
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,840
Some of them moved on to Elm, whatever.

480
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:30,840
People will do their own thing.

481
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:32,840
Elixir Elm, right?

482
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:38,840
I don't understand why anyone would think this is a bad release.

483
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:42,840
And I haven't seen any negative coverage yet, except for the lull Rails is slow.

484
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:51,840
But, sure, I mean, when it's not as slow as it used to be, Django is roughly as slow, I mean, if not slower.

485
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:53,840
I mean, it's a high-level framework, right?

486
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:58,840
So, yeah, I like that post, too, from David Heimner-Hansen, the one-person framework.

487
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:02,840
That really put it all in perspective for me, and so I'll link it in the show notes,

488
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:07,840
because he talks a little bit, too, about how some of the security work they did at Hay has influenced this release.

489
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:10,840
But here's the bit that I thought resonated with me.

490
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:14,840
He says, the part that really excites me about this vision, though,

491
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:19,840
is how much closer it brings us to the ideal of the, quote, one-person framework,

492
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:24,840
a toolkit that is so powerful that it allows a single individual to create modern applications

493
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:29,840
upon which they might build a competitive business the way it used to be.

494
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:33,840
And he also adds, there's so much to learn these days.

495
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:35,840
If you want to be an expert in all the latest tools and techniques,

496
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:40,840
the conventional path, as paved by solutions extracted from the giant tech companies,

497
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:43,840
is a journey akin to the Oregon Trail.

498
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:47,840
You might die of dysentery before you ever get to your destination.

499
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:53,840
RAIL 7 seeks to be the wormhole that folds the time-learning-shipping continuum

500
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:59,840
and allows you to travel grand distances without knowing all of the physics of interstellar travel,

501
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:03,840
giving the individual rebel a fighting chance against the Empire.

502
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:10,840
You simply can't play by the same rules against an opponent exponentially stronger than you.

503
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:12,840
Man, that hit me in the feels.

504
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:15,840
Yeah, I wonder if that doesn't hit him in the feels, too, right?

505
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:16,840
Yeah.

506
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:21,840
We spent a lot of time at TMB chasing the JavaScript love parade.

507
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:24,840
And honestly, it's just not that important.

508
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:28,840
And I get why, like, listen, if you are starting a Twitter account

509
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:32,840
and you want to juice your followers, just throw a hashtag JavaScript in there.

510
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:34,840
Is that all you got to do?

511
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:38,840
Honestly, there's too much going on to get to the same types of sites

512
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:41,840
we've been able to build for a long time.

513
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:43,840
Too many layers of complexity.

514
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:48,840
I can't tell you how many times, like, for barely comprehensible reasons,

515
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:53,840
Webpack would just vomit in large-scale Rails applications that I had to work on.

516
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:56,840
And it would always be something really stupid.

517
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:59,840
And the answer is like, well, why is this actually better?

518
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:03,840
Like, why the hell do I need Angular or React in my Rails app

519
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:08,840
when I could just do this in ERB and cue the old man to get off my lawn?

520
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:09,840
We need a clip of that.

521
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:11,840
We need some old man yelling about getting off.

522
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:13,840
Somebody go and send it to us.

523
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:14,840
That's going to be trouble.

524
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:18,840
I don't think many of the new JavaScript front-end development stuff

525
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:23,840
are really advancements or worth their cost

526
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:25,840
if you're building line-of-business applications.

527
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:27,840
I just don't.

528
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:29,840
I think there's too much overhead.

529
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:34,840
And the truth is, one of the biggest advancements in JavaScript has been the DOM.

530
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:37,840
So you don't need a giant framework to get a lot of it, right?

531
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:39,840
The DOM and some of the nicer CSS stuff.

532
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:45,840
And it's basically trivial to pull in a nice CSS library of controls or whatever

533
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:52,840
that I'm more and more just like server-side rendering with some client side,

534
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:54,840
like, on the DOM JavaScript love.

535
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:56,840
Oh, man, I love it when you talk like this.

536
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:58,840
I know that's very old man-ish.

537
00:27:58,840 --> 00:27:59,840
No, it gets me excited.

538
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:02,840
It saves just a ton of, basically, pain in the ass time.

539
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:04,840
No, I think all that's right.

540
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:06,840
But there's just in the back of my mind, I'm wondering now,

541
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:10,840
you're kind of looking at this from the outside because you're kind of all in on the Python now.

542
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:12,840
So you're seeing this over, you know, you're seeing Rails 7,

543
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:16,840
but you're looking at it now probably from more of a Python perspective, I would imagine.

544
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:17,840
That's fair.

545
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:21,840
I mean, so it's funny because Dave, my CTO, and I have been having conversations,

546
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:23,840
as we do because we're friends.

547
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:27,840
But, you know, more and more we've been releasing these products, right?

548
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:33,840
We released Alice, we're releasing WinkWink, create your own report tool coming out January.

549
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:35,840
Cool.

550
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:39,840
Hopefully, and you can make fun of me when January turns into April.

551
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:40,840
So we did this backwards.

552
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:46,840
We wrote kind of a front end, like a GUI demo, you know, see if people actually want this.

553
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:50,840
And I started writing the backend in FastAPI.

554
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:52,840
And we're looking at this.

555
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:57,840
And we were thinking, you know, all of the products we're developing,

556
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:02,840
we've had years in Rails and now we have a lot of experience in Python.

557
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:04,840
But like, he comes from a C background.

558
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:06,840
And when I say C, I mean C.

559
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:07,840
Okay.

560
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:09,840
Right.

561
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:12,840
You can take your plus and your plus and shove them both.

562
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:13,840
Although he did do C++.

563
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:18,840
He just, I don't know, apparently him and Linus are like, they're on the same page.

564
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:19,840
C Maximus.

565
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:20,840
No, he doesn't like C either.

566
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:21,840
He loves the web.

567
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:24,840
He is a can I do it on the DOM.

568
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:25,840
Okay.

569
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:28,840
It's the DOM and jQuery is where he lives.

570
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:29,840
Sure.

571
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:31,840
Kids these days.

572
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:33,840
He's like, you know, everything's going to the web anyway.

573
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,840
And he's not wrong.

574
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:38,840
I mean, it's just to the art and business.

575
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:44,840
But the way we see things scaling for us is not close more.

576
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:46,840
I mean, hire us for consulting, please.

577
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:51,840
But it's not chase the trendiest thing and get more consulting work.

578
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:56,840
Long time listeners know that's not the best idea.

579
00:29:56,840 --> 00:30:02,840
And, you know, I can just talk about the dark days of mobile.

580
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:13,840
It's release pieces of productized or big packages of code that provide some set of value to potential customers or clients.

581
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:18,840
And either build them a custom solution based on that, which is basically what Alice is.

582
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:19,840
Right.

583
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:21,840
Like, we're doing a lot of one time conversions, too.

584
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:29,840
But the bigger jobs are, okay, we're going to put this as like a core and I'm going to build you some custom dashboard or some custom.

585
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:30,840
Everybody needs a dashboard.

586
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:31,840
I don't know what to say.

587
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:32,840
So true.

588
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:34,840
Everybody loves a dashboard.

589
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:35,840
They love them.

590
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:36,840
Everybody loves a dashboard.

591
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:37,840
I love them.

592
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:39,840
Yes, they want dashboards.

593
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:46,840
So that kind of having our own products that are flexible enough to be expanded.

594
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:48,840
I mean, do you remember OpenCore?

595
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:50,840
Oh, I remember OpenCore.

596
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:52,840
Gather around, children.

597
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:54,840
Stay a while and listen.

598
00:30:54,840 --> 00:31:04,840
I feel like if the world could like not be in a state of constant collapse, go like one year without some major disaster.

599
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:05,840
That'd be great.

600
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:06,840
It would be great.

601
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:10,840
I don't remember the last time there wasn't one, but OK, it would be amazing.

602
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:12,840
I think it was 2007.

603
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:15,840
Yeah, I think so, too.

604
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:23,840
I feel like we're going to end up in the state of we have some sort of possibly open source suite of tools,

605
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:30,840
and then we're doing custom proprietary development on top of it and licensing a managing service for those tools.

606
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:32,840
A management service, I should say.

607
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:35,840
I remember OpenCore was a thing and then it just died.

608
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:38,840
But is that not the ideal of the old OpenCore?

609
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:40,840
You know what? Can I say something that's going to get me in trouble?

610
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:41,840
Get in trouble.

611
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:42,840
I like the model.

612
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:43,840
Why did it die?

613
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:47,840
I know it's like if I put it on Reddit, people are going to say, I mean, people are mean on Reddit anyway.

614
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:49,840
But why is it bad?

615
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:51,840
You know, it got associated with a bait and switch, I think.

616
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:57,840
I think you had a few bad big actors, essentially, that did a little bait and switch with the whole like realize and so surprised.

617
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:58,840
Now this is proprietary.

618
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:03,840
Or the other one that was super common was, yeah, the core is open source.

619
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:06,840
But to get anything intelligible out of it, you have to go proprietary, right?

620
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:09,840
Like that was so common, especially in my I.T. career.

621
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:17,840
Like primetime, it was open core, barely functional with like this decrepit command line interface that will give you results out of a printer.

622
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:24,840
Or here's our big enterprise suite that everyone could use and ties in with your active directory and cost ten thousand dollars a year.

623
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:28,840
OK, it's horrible that you said active directory because that's basically where I want to make it.

624
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:29,840
Of course.

625
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:33,840
So I feel like I'm retreading some sins of the past year.

626
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:35,840
No, I mean, there's some fundamentals.

627
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:42,840
If the core is truly open, infrastructure person or application developer can go grab something, run it, do a proof of concept,

628
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:49,840
actually get value out of it and then convince upper management, the CTO, et cetera, to spend money on the commercial product.

629
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:51,840
I think that's when open core is perfect.

630
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:53,840
Yeah. Isn't that the point?

631
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:55,840
That's not what a lot of people did, though.

632
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:58,840
That's not what happened.

633
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:06,840
You know, like it became a bad word because a lot of people made it too crippled or they did a little bait and switch on like the oh,

634
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:08,840
it was open, but now it's closed source.

635
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:13,840
Version three, version two was open source, but version three is closed source or some of that going on.

636
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:15,840
Well, what about like IntelliJ, right?

637
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:19,840
Like PyCharm, IntelliJ is JetBrains.

638
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:22,840
Most of you probably know this, but they make a whole suite of IDs, right?

639
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:23,840
PyCharm is their Python one.

640
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:26,840
They have PyCharm community, which is effectively free.

641
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:27,840
It is free.

642
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:29,840
It's straight up free.

643
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:39,840
But if you want some of the snazzier SQLAlchemy features, which is the ORM for Python, or if you want, there's a bunch of stuff in pro that you don't get.

644
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:44,840
But is that not also a version of open core where it's like you can have the base model?

645
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:46,840
But if you want the fancy one, you got to pay.

646
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:51,840
You know, I think what you've tapped into is core application with a side of services.

647
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:53,840
And now the services are the proprietary paid thing.

648
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:56,840
We just don't call it open core anymore.

649
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:58,840
Isn't this like Red Hat's original business model?

650
00:33:58,840 --> 00:33:59,840
Yeah.

651
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:07,840
And I know Red Hat, that became a, maybe we shouldn't go there, but I have also watched Revolution OS, which if you haven't, great documentary.

652
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:11,840
You can ironically buy it on iTunes.

653
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,840
That is actually pretty ironic.

654
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:17,840
I think that we should all make those businesses fail.

655
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:20,840
Considering some of the people in that.

656
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:25,840
I enjoy streaming those folks on my Apple TV via iCloud.

657
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:28,840
I bet they would just love to hear that.

658
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:29,840
I bet they would love that.

659
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:39,840
We're way off here, but this is just like, I feel pretty strongly that open core, maybe I shouldn't use the branding, right?

660
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:42,840
But like, it just isn't evil.

661
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:43,840
Yeah.

662
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:59,840
Because I don't know, the way I make money is that businesses that are exponentially larger than mine pay me a premium to do their work for them or solve what sound like maybe silly problems in some cases.

663
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:02,840
But it turns out they have some regulatory compliance issue.

664
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:06,840
And like, if they do not fix this problem, they will be fined.

665
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:09,840
I've heard numbers that would like make you cry.

666
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:16,840
There's so many solutions that businesses can be provided that are just simply come down to, they don't know how to do a thing.

667
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:20,840
Thing is actually quite doable, but they don't know how to do thing.

668
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:22,840
So they will hire you for your knowing how to do thing.

669
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:24,840
And that's really, that's it.

670
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:29,840
It doesn't have to be like you're converting a Cobalt application to a PHP application.

671
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:31,840
Like, it doesn't have to be something like that.

672
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:32,840
Right.

673
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:36,840
You know, I don't know what I was trying to think while you were talking about it.

674
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:42,840
I was trying to think of another term besides open core that you could call it, but I'm drawing a blank.

675
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:44,840
Maybe somebody in the audience knows.

676
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:46,840
I might not even ever say the word open core, right?

677
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:53,840
Because nobody who doesn't listen to Jupiter broadcasting or like Flaws Weekly is going to know what the hell that means anyway.

678
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:59,840
So you could get that old crusty IT guy who they loop in as a stakeholder and, you know, he's wondering.

679
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:01,840
But yeah, I agree for the most part.

680
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:08,840
In 2003, he got burned by Red Hat and he swears to God he'll never again.

681
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:09,840
But you know what?

682
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:11,840
When you tell him that you're a Seuss fan, it'll probably calm down.

683
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:13,840
A lot of those guys like Seuss.

684
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:15,840
So is he German?

685
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:19,840
Shortcut.com slash coder.

686
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:22,840
Have you ever really been happy with your project management tool?

687
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:23,840
I know, right?

688
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:29,840
Most of them are too simple and really not getting the job done or they're so wickedly complex.

689
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:33,840
You almost need a full time staffer just to manage that and prod people to use it.

690
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:35,840
That's how Shortcut is different.

691
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:38,840
It used to be known as Clubhouse, but now it's Shortcut and it's a lot better.

692
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:41,840
It's project management built specifically for software teams.

693
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:46,840
It's fast, it's intuitive, flexible, powerful and really all the other things you want to hear from me about it.

694
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:48,840
I mean, it truly is those things.

695
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:50,840
Let's just look at a couple of highlights.

696
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:53,840
I think probably a lot of you are going to appreciate the team based workflows.

697
00:36:53,840 --> 00:37:00,840
Yeah, individual teams could just use Shortcut's default workflows or customize them to match the way you work.

698
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:03,840
And they have organizational wide goals and roadmaps.

699
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:07,840
You can make sure that work in there is automatically tied into larger company goals.

700
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:08,840
Are you starting to get it?

701
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:10,840
Get everybody rowing in the same direction?

702
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:15,840
One click to move from a roadmap, then zoom all the way out or zoom all the way into an individual.

703
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:18,840
It's pretty slick and it has tight VCS integration.

704
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:22,840
So if you use GitHub or GitLab or Bitbucket, Shortcut ties directly to them.

705
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:26,840
So you can update your progress from the command line.

706
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:30,840
In fact, I have to say the keyboard friendly interface is something that they've really focused on.

707
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:33,840
I think it's kind of one of their unique features here.

708
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:36,840
It's super easy to navigate Shortcut with the keyboard.

709
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:41,840
They have a power bar allowing you to do virtually everything without touching your mouse.

710
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:42,840
Throw that thing away.

711
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:44,840
You're not going to need it with Shortcut.

712
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:45,840
I think iteration planning is genius.

713
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:51,840
You can set weekly priorities and then let Shortcut run a schedule for you with a company burn down charts and all the other reporting you need.

714
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:54,840
Man, go give it a try today and see what you can do.

715
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:56,840
Shortcut.com slash coder.

716
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:59,840
Again, Shortcut.com slash coder formerly known as Clubhouse.

717
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:04,840
Now it's Shortcut because you really shouldn't have to project manage your project management.

718
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:06,840
So go check out Shortcut.

719
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:08,840
Shortcut.com slash coder.

720
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:13,840
My Pop OS workstation.

721
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:15,840
I don't know if you know this.

722
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:16,840
It was on Twitter a while ago.

723
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:17,840
Yeah.

724
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:21,840
I gave somebody some young guy System 76.

725
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:22,840
I think it was a lemur.

726
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:23,840
He listens to the show.

727
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:29,840
He can correct me to make me a theme that looks like Snow Leopard.

728
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:30,840
OK, hold on.

729
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:31,840
Hold on.

730
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:36,840
You gave someone an entire computer to get a theme that looks like a version of Mac OS from like almost a decade ago.

731
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:38,840
It gets worse.

732
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:41,840
Sir, your moment has come.

733
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:52,840
I will give you a TMB swag pack, including stickers and a fracture print of Alice or one of the other ones, whichever ones I have, or the Fourth of July Mad Botter guy.

734
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:55,840
If you can update me for 2110.

735
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:59,840
Because in my heart and I need the right background.

736
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:00,840
Very important.

737
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:03,840
In my heart, it is 2011.

738
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:05,840
And that was peak Mac OS.

739
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:06,840
I'm sorry.

740
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:08,840
It's 2010.

741
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:09,840
Wow.

742
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:11,840
That was a decade ago.

743
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:12,840
Geez.

744
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:13,840
Yeah.

745
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:14,840
That's kind of a long time.

746
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:15,840
Mac OS has been on the bad side.

747
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:18,840
To be fair, I'm not running like I run it every once in a while as a joke.

748
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:20,840
I will say one thing I do like about Nob.

749
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:25,840
It is very easy to switch between like the regular.

750
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:30,840
I don't remember what they call it, but the GTK Plus themes and something weird.

751
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:38,840
But there's nothing like on a bad day when you're feeling down, when the Ronos got its black polished boot on your throat.

752
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:47,840
To pretend like it's 2010 and that you are in the mountains of Tibet with a majestic snow leopard.

753
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:54,840
You know, in a lot of ways, a nice up to date pop OS reminds me of where Mac OS was a decade ago.

754
00:39:54,840 --> 00:40:04,840
You know, if it was like an alternate reality and they just gone a certainly just kind of a different direction more towards power users and less towards general iPhone users.

755
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:05,840
Because that's really what happened, right?

756
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:09,840
I mean, come on, Carl Steve Jobs, just give him some weed, right?

757
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:11,840
He was so close.

758
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:13,840
Put down the LSD, pick up the pot.

759
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:18,840
Yeah, I think if you look at it in that way, like Linux desktop is getting in a special space.

760
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:28,840
The only thing it doesn't have that Apple was really, really great at is that complete developer story with all the APIs and the way to distribute in a single way and monetize.

761
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:29,840
Sure, it does.

762
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:30,840
It does, you think?

763
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:31,840
Absolutely.

764
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:36,840
But it's because I remember as much as, you know, I might dream that it's 2010.

765
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:37,840
It's not 2010.

766
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:40,840
I'll be careful here because somebody is going to say, well, you can't do this.

767
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:49,840
But for all the practical line of business applications that I need for my business and I've been doing this since I was 19 is when I opened my business.

768
00:40:49,840 --> 00:41:05,840
So every customer I've had, except for a few specialty tablet apps or phone apps in factories on the enterprise side, all of those applications, but for the ones that actually connect to hardware could be done as web apps.

769
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:07,840
And I don't mean Electron.

770
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:15,840
I mean straight up in the browser because I think Electron, you're buying another set of problems that Electron is great.

771
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:17,840
I use Electron apps all day long.

772
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:21,840
I feel like Electron is in many ways a transitional technology.

773
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:23,840
And we're going to wind up somewhere else.

774
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:24,840
I agree.

775
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:31,840
In fact, pathetically, I have been liking a fricking note taking app that is a web app.

776
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:34,840
And I can't believe I'm saying that.

777
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:35,840
I'm not even talking VS code yet.

778
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:37,840
Check out blankslate.io.

779
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:38,840
I'm going to do it right now.

780
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:44,840
Blankslate.io and it's just a quick place where you can capture notes, supports markdown.

781
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:51,840
And if you have like Grammarly as an extension, Grammarly can also spell check it, which I don't get in my local desktop applications.

782
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:55,840
And it's I mean, as far as like quit note, it's nice.

783
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:56,840
It's actually kind of nice.

784
00:41:56,840 --> 00:42:00,840
And I can't believe I'm finding myself taking notes in a web browser now.

785
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:03,840
I just oh, but it's you're so right.

786
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:05,840
Do you know how I take my meeting notes?

787
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:07,840
It's a cutting edge technology paper.

788
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:09,840
It's a it's graph paper from Amazon.

789
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:11,840
Thank you, Jeff Bezos, for undercutting Staples.

790
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:14,840
Yep. And field notes.

791
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:17,840
And it's number two pencils also from Amazon.

792
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:23,840
Because again, Jeff Bezos, I don't know who makes number two pencils, but he really did a job on them.

793
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:27,840
I got an email from field notes and I felt like it was the please save us from Amazon email.

794
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:29,840
I got the same email right here.

795
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:31,840
You know, I've got I've got paper notes.

796
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:34,840
That's how I like to like if you say something I want to remember, I write it down.

797
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:40,840
But I got to admit, I didn't make the order on field notes because I've got a stack from Amazon of notebooks here.

798
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:42,840
Well, I used to and in fact, it just expired.

799
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:45,840
I used to do the field notes annual subscription.

800
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:46,840
That's what I was thinking on.

801
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:54,840
They got real into not just doing the regular like dot or graph paper and doing these weird like calendar notebooks.

802
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:58,840
So I feel bad about wasting paper because like the environment and all that.

803
00:42:58,840 --> 00:43:01,840
And also, I mean, I mentioned field notes on the show years ago.

804
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:04,840
I love them. I love their notebooks.

805
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:08,840
But back when I ordered it, they just did graph paper.

806
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:11,840
What I want is like a mix and match my own subscription.

807
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:13,840
I like their reporter's notebook when I go to events.

808
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:15,840
It's like, you know, looks like the old newspaper kind.

809
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:17,840
I hate that one. So I'll give you mine if I find it.

810
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:20,840
OK, I mean, I just like it at events outside of that.

811
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:22,840
Not a big fan because it doesn't fit very well.

812
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:24,840
I don't mind the designs if they want to put a design on there.

813
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:27,840
But I just want something I can write stuff down real quick.

814
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:29,840
That's what I want. Well, I like that they fit in my pocket.

815
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:32,840
Absolutely. So like if I'm at a meeting and I just seem to oh, this you know, you got to call Bob.

816
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:36,840
Bob's number is, you know, 505 505.

817
00:43:36,840 --> 00:43:39,840
Yep. Six, I guess you can do that.

818
00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:43,840
Yeah. So it's the same thing. I can't control what I get.

819
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:49,840
And for me, for whatever reason, if I were to tap that same information into notes on my phone, it'd be gone in 10 minutes.

820
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:52,840
I'd never remember it if I write it down. I got a good shot at remembering it.

821
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:56,840
I once tried to be a Evernote power user.

822
00:43:56,840 --> 00:43:58,840
Yep. I owe an apology.

823
00:43:58,840 --> 00:44:06,840
I actually did to an Evernote customer service rep because they said that they could understand my handwriting.

824
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:15,840
They could not. But much like the Catholic school nun when I was in the third grade, it just wasn't the case.

825
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:21,840
I got to say, speaking of recognizing handwriting and print the new text recognition,

826
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:26,840
I think they call it live text or whatever in the whatever they call it in the new iOS update and photos.

827
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:30,840
Oh, man. So handy. Last night I was paying for a toll.

828
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:34,840
I drove on a toll road here and they needed my license plate number.

829
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:39,840
So I knew I had a picture with my car in it from a couple of days ago and I couldn't remember my license plate number.

830
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:43,840
So I just opened up photos, scrolled up, found the photo, tapped on the photo,

831
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:50,840
zoomed in and just highlighted the text right off my just highlighted my license plate and copied it right off the photo and then went back over to work.

832
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:54,840
Yeah. And it does, man. And I went right back over and pasted it in.

833
00:44:54,840 --> 00:44:58,840
It's great. I often need my DL number and I often don't know it.

834
00:44:58,840 --> 00:45:02,840
Yeah. Or like you take a picture of a sign, you know, it'll OCR that text. You can go in and get that.

835
00:45:02,840 --> 00:45:06,840
It's actually pretty nice. You know what else is amazing in the new iOS?

836
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:09,840
What? It's merciless desire to kill the Mac.

837
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:12,840
Yeah. We knew this was coming.

838
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:18,840
Apple has released Swift Playgrounds now with support for actually creating apps on the iPad.

839
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:22,840
It only took, you know, forever. A decade.

840
00:45:22,840 --> 00:45:26,840
Did it take forever? I just want to say Snow Leopard is very fresh in my mind.

841
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:30,840
So I would maybe calm down with that. It's only version four. It's only you're right.

842
00:45:30,840 --> 00:45:33,840
It's only version four. So maybe four years took about four years.

843
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:42,840
So the scariest thing about this update for me personally is that my son theoretically can create an app to automatically screw with my pets.

844
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:46,840
Now what now? My son has an iPad. Yeah. But how does he screw with your pets?

845
00:45:46,840 --> 00:45:50,840
I don't know. Tell me about this. Also, did you get a new kitty?

846
00:45:50,840 --> 00:45:55,840
We did get a new kitten. Yes. Oh, congrats. It's adorable. I saw the picture on Twitter. It looks cute.

847
00:45:55,840 --> 00:46:00,840
Like all cats, she notices when Visual Studio Code is open and that I haven't saved the file.

848
00:46:00,840 --> 00:46:04,840
Of course. Immediately jumps up. Oh, no.

849
00:46:04,840 --> 00:46:07,840
And there's a barrel roll on the keyboard. Look at me.

850
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:12,840
I also made the mistake of keeping the little glowy kind of rainbow.

851
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:15,840
Oh, yeah. I got that. I got that going right now. It's nice.

852
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:21,840
I like the pinwheel one, but I've changed it because I don't want to think about Mac because, you know, the breakup just happened.

853
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:24,840
Oh, and it draws the kitty's attention.

854
00:46:24,840 --> 00:46:27,840
Trying to get the cats like, bam, smack, smack, smack, smack.

855
00:46:27,840 --> 00:46:29,840
Cats like launch keyboards. You heard it here.

856
00:46:29,840 --> 00:46:39,840
So no, what my kid likes to do is because we have a senile dog and a little dog who's like hyper aggressive against other dogs.

857
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:45,840
He likes to play. I made the mistake of downloading a National Geographic app for him.

858
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:47,840
They have like a kitty app. Wow.

859
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:51,840
And in this app, you can play different animal sounds. Oh, sure.

860
00:46:51,840 --> 00:46:56,840
And one of the sounds is wolves howling. Uh oh. Kitty doesn't like that.

861
00:46:56,840 --> 00:46:59,840
No, the cats are like, whatever, if you're an idiot, it's an iPad.

862
00:46:59,840 --> 00:47:04,840
But the dogs? The dogs are like ready to go to war. Oh, yeah.

863
00:47:04,840 --> 00:47:09,840
They're snarling. They're growling. They don't understand what's happening right now.

864
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:14,840
So in many ways, my dogs are the junior JavaScript developers of the house.

865
00:47:14,840 --> 00:47:15,840
Right.

866
00:47:15,840 --> 00:47:20,840
And my kid is an Objective C developer who refuses to work and it's just being better than them.

867
00:47:20,840 --> 00:47:25,840
I mean, you know, this is this is the sign that the Mac could be replaced one day.

868
00:47:25,840 --> 00:47:26,840
It is. Yeah.

869
00:47:26,840 --> 00:47:34,840
Until an iOS device could create its own apps. Now it can make iPad and iPhone apps and iPhone apps and Mac apps.

870
00:47:34,840 --> 00:47:37,840
Now it has the ability to replace the Mac. Now, they're not going to be very sophisticated, obviously.

871
00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:40,840
It's early days. But this was the first step required.

872
00:47:40,840 --> 00:47:42,840
That's what they said about Swift.

873
00:47:42,840 --> 00:47:48,840
Doesn't it just seem obvious that Swift Playgrounds is eventually going to do an iMovie Final Cut kind of split too?

874
00:47:48,840 --> 00:47:52,840
It just seems like what's going to happen. And it will be some kind of Xcode for iOS.

875
00:47:52,840 --> 00:47:56,840
Yeah, I think what's going to happen is Swift Playgrounds is, yeah, exactly like iMovie Final Cut.

876
00:47:56,840 --> 00:48:01,840
You're exactly right. It's going to gain functionality, but not fast enough to take out.

877
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:06,840
And, you know, Xcode on Mac will always have a place for your worthy enterprise. Right.

878
00:48:06,840 --> 00:48:11,840
Well, and your big builds with all the M1 cores in there and whatnot or whatever they're going to be, you know.

879
00:48:11,840 --> 00:48:20,840
I've read some frightening speculative pieces on how much more they can get out of the M1 without significantly increasing thermals.

880
00:48:20,840 --> 00:48:22,840
If that's true.

881
00:48:22,840 --> 00:48:27,840
And I've also heard speculation of like iCloud Xcode build too, which would sort of normalize that.

882
00:48:27,840 --> 00:48:33,840
I just want to talk about it. Can we talk about iCloud Core Data again?

883
00:48:33,840 --> 00:48:38,840
Yeah, I wouldn't touch that with the authors.

884
00:48:38,840 --> 00:48:42,840
Yeah, but they got to figure out something now because all these Apple employees are staying home.

885
00:48:42,840 --> 00:48:46,840
You see this. Apple has delayed the return to offices indefinitely,

886
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:51,840
which the reason why that's remarkable is because Tim Cook was thrown down earlier in the year about people.

887
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:55,840
People said, we don't want to come back. And they said, and now they're saying, oh, OK.

888
00:48:55,840 --> 00:48:58,840
Not only that, here's a thousand dollars to go buy yourself something nice.

889
00:48:58,840 --> 00:49:03,840
One Tim Cook is like every Mac Daddy ever. Here's a thousand bucks, honey.

890
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:08,840
Here you go. Yeah. And I will take my cancellation now, please, because I'm tired.

891
00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:11,840
I feel like this is the right choice, right?

892
00:49:11,840 --> 00:49:17,840
I mean, as I sit here and according to my doctor, almost certainly infected with Omicron,

893
00:49:17,840 --> 00:49:24,840
which is just running through Florida because Florida.

894
00:49:24,840 --> 00:49:27,840
And I mean, it's actually running through everywhere. That's why I'm thinking about I got it.

895
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:32,840
I got to postpone my meetup on the second. Yeah, I feel like I don't know.

896
00:49:32,840 --> 00:49:35,840
I mean, can I fry some? I'm not even going to call it bacon because bacon is fun.

897
00:49:35,840 --> 00:49:38,840
Oh, man, I brought all this bacon in, but I understand you don't want to waste.

898
00:49:38,840 --> 00:49:43,840
No, I'm going to boil some cauliflower. All right. Good for you. OK, I hate cauliflower.

899
00:49:43,840 --> 00:49:46,840
All right. But, you know, when you boil it, it makes it real good.

900
00:49:46,840 --> 00:49:53,840
I'm pretty sure we've got like two more years of this crap.

901
00:49:53,840 --> 00:49:56,840
I was doing the boiling. Oh, I heard you. It was beautiful.

902
00:49:56,840 --> 00:50:01,840
Two more years of the lockdown, no more getting together, meetups, no more business stuff.

903
00:50:01,840 --> 00:50:08,840
Yeah, this I mean, we're not fully locked down. I mean, I'm locked down for another like four days or three days.

904
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:13,840
I don't know. I don't think we're going to be having.

905
00:50:13,840 --> 00:50:17,840
Like, there was no DevFest Florida, which is my conference I look forward to every year.

906
00:50:17,840 --> 00:50:21,840
I don't think there was no Linux fest Northwest, and I don't think there's going to be one in April.

907
00:50:21,840 --> 00:50:26,840
Is there? No, I don't think so. I like how every week we end here where we just lament.

908
00:50:26,840 --> 00:50:30,840
I know. I know. I got a solution. It better not be Facebook VR.

909
00:50:30,840 --> 00:50:33,840
I don't know why a podcaster from Seattle had to be the one to figure it out.

910
00:50:33,840 --> 00:50:38,840
But the solution just have everyone test every day, rapid testing every day.

911
00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:42,840
You test before you go to the event. You test before you go into the office.

912
00:50:42,840 --> 00:50:47,840
You test before you go to school. You test before you go to a meetup. And if you're sick, you stay home.

913
00:50:47,840 --> 00:50:52,840
And the thing is, is even if the testing only gets you when you're at your peak infection rate, it's going to get you the next day.

914
00:50:52,840 --> 00:50:55,840
It's going to get everybody who are at that event if they also are rapid testing.

915
00:50:55,840 --> 00:51:02,840
So if even if the testing doesn't catch it on day one, if everyone is practicing rapid testing, you'll catch it real quick.

916
00:51:02,840 --> 00:51:06,840
It doesn't involve anyone injecting themselves. It doesn't involve anyone taking any medication.

917
00:51:06,840 --> 00:51:09,840
It's got nothing to do with any kind of mass or social distancing.

918
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:13,840
You just test yourself. You test yourself every single day before you go out.

919
00:51:13,840 --> 00:51:18,840
And that's all it would take. And you just print up the way I did the test of the doctor.

920
00:51:18,840 --> 00:51:21,840
Don't want me to come to the weird medical reasons that Mike has.

921
00:51:21,840 --> 00:51:25,840
I would have had to go to the hospital and he didn't want me to go. But you can buy them.

922
00:51:25,840 --> 00:51:31,840
Yep. Yeah, you can. Yep. You can have someone deliver them to your door for like three bucks.

923
00:51:31,840 --> 00:51:39,840
I paid the guy more because I felt bad, but I think Joe Biden ought to send everyone a Christmas card with a batch of federally funded testing.

924
00:51:39,840 --> 00:51:45,840
I mean, we're willing to spend trillions on everything else and we have testing sites that we're setting up. Those are expensive.

925
00:51:45,840 --> 00:51:48,840
This would be a real practical solution and that would still let people function.

926
00:51:48,840 --> 00:51:51,840
I know I'm a genius and I'm sure I've thought of every single dynamic.

927
00:51:51,840 --> 00:51:56,840
So let's have our COVID moment. Let's have our feefies, right? Let's have our feelings.

928
00:51:56,840 --> 00:52:02,840
I could not have imagined if you had told me and let's say 20.

929
00:52:02,840 --> 00:52:06,840
Early 2019, if you had said, Michael.

930
00:52:06,840 --> 00:52:10,840
Thinking about the business for the next couple of years.

931
00:52:10,840 --> 00:52:14,840
You're not going to go physically see clients for two years.

932
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:20,840
And you're not going to do any shows, trade shows right now, but you'd say you're putting me out of business.

933
00:52:20,840 --> 00:52:26,840
I'd say, did I die? Right. My expectation would be, is it because I'm dead?

934
00:52:26,840 --> 00:52:29,840
We're in this strange, I almost feel like holding pattern.

935
00:52:29,840 --> 00:52:33,840
Like everybody, like I saw all the articles about Apple allowing remote work.

936
00:52:33,840 --> 00:52:38,840
What were they going to do? Yeah. A sick workforce can't work.

937
00:52:38,840 --> 00:52:41,840
I mean, it's not it's not even him being benevolent, right?

938
00:52:41,840 --> 00:52:47,840
It's covering his own ass. If they force everyone to come in and then everyone gets Omicron at the office, that's on Tim Cook.

939
00:52:47,840 --> 00:52:51,840
And then they can't work for two weeks. I mean, I don't know.

940
00:52:51,840 --> 00:52:57,840
Not only does it wreck the productivity, but it also is, you know, hey, man, you made us come back and then we all got sick.

941
00:52:57,840 --> 00:53:02,840
I mean, that sounds well, and then you potentially have liability and lawyers are fun.

942
00:53:02,840 --> 00:53:08,840
The only real ray of hope is that perhaps the symptoms are lighter.

943
00:53:08,840 --> 00:53:17,840
My neighbor had it and they believe it was the Omicron variant and it was mostly a cold for him, you know, a few days.

944
00:53:17,840 --> 00:53:22,840
Yeah. Get your bacon out. I got you here. Oh, I knew it. You see, I was going to put it away.

945
00:53:22,840 --> 00:53:26,840
All right. Welcome to Morgan Dominic. It's like Morgan Stanley, but we killed Stanley.

946
00:53:26,840 --> 00:53:34,840
OK, we're going to have a party in Seattle. We're going to do it up right with some Denver pot.

947
00:53:34,840 --> 00:53:38,840
I don't smoke pot, but I understand that Chris does. It is joking.

948
00:53:38,840 --> 00:53:43,840
What I like is you might as well. I mean, why not? You're flying in for a little while. Enjoy yourself.

949
00:53:43,840 --> 00:53:51,840
It's a big part of the tourism thing here. The worst part is I'm with my I could technically get a card, but it's I just chose not to.

950
00:53:51,840 --> 00:53:58,840
We're celebrating a merger, a marriage, if you will. A marriage, a beautiful relationship.

951
00:53:58,840 --> 00:54:05,840
I will say it's kind of a May, December situation. Microsoft by System 76.

952
00:54:05,840 --> 00:54:12,840
I'm sorry, what? What? Why? Either I'm delirious because I'm dying of Omicron and I don't know it or.

953
00:54:12,840 --> 00:54:17,840
I think this is that will change the world. Sure would think about this.

954
00:54:17,840 --> 00:54:27,840
Windows 12. Exclamation point underscore OS. I do like it. I do like love you guys.

955
00:54:27,840 --> 00:54:31,840
I like it. And then you just you show up. It's a pop desktop with a Windows icon.

00:54:31,840 --> 00:54:35,840
You double click it and it's the Windows 11 experience inside Pop OS.

957
00:54:35,840 --> 00:54:41,840
You just flip that crap, right? So it's it's a Linux desktop with the Linux subsystem for Windows.

958
00:54:41,840 --> 00:54:46,840
And I'm telling you, that would work for me. Tell you what. All right. Well, you know, it was a week or so ago.

959
00:54:46,840 --> 00:54:51,840
We launched Jupiter Party where you can go to sign up and become a network member and get access to all the special stuff.

960
00:54:51,840 --> 00:54:59,840
So you get Coder QA for this show. You get the self hosted post show. You get the Linux unplugged live show, which is like two shows in one.

961
00:54:59,840 --> 00:55:03,840
And you get Linux action news totally ad free at Jupiter Party.

962
00:55:03,840 --> 00:55:07,840
And you can sign up right now until the end of the month. Then it expires.

963
00:55:07,840 --> 00:55:10,840
But if you sign up right now, you get two dollars off for a year.

964
00:55:10,840 --> 00:55:13,840
So the cost of two memberships. But with that two dollar discount, it's even cheaper.

965
00:55:13,840 --> 00:55:17,840
And all the shows are now ad free, all ad free in that feed.

966
00:55:17,840 --> 00:55:21,840
So go enjoy it. Support the network and all that at Jupiter Party.

967
00:55:21,840 --> 00:55:27,840
You can also give it as a gift. If Coder is your jam, we appreciate our QA members more than ever.

968
00:55:27,840 --> 00:55:31,840
You know what? You guys have been awesome this year. Thank you so much to the Coder QA squad.

969
00:55:31,840 --> 00:55:36,840
You can become a member of this show at Coder QA dot co and support Coder Radio directly.

970
00:55:36,840 --> 00:55:43,840
We appreciate all of that. And even if you can't financially support us, we love it that you've listened, you've downloaded, maybe showed up live once.

971
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:47,840
Or maybe you've shared the episode or maybe you've sent us a feedback form at some point.

972
00:55:47,840 --> 00:55:53,840
Or maybe you've just been silently listening and enjoying the show. Either way, we're tremendously grateful for you doing that.

973
00:55:53,840 --> 00:55:56,840
So thank you very much. Take care of yourselves out there.

974
00:55:56,840 --> 00:55:59,840
Mr. Dominic, is there anywhere you want to send people this week as we wrap up?

975
00:55:59,840 --> 00:56:04,840
Alice Dot Dev, as always. And if you are the snow leopard engineer for Gnome, hook them up.

976
00:56:04,840 --> 00:56:09,840
This is your moment. Cook me up. It's time for a refresh time. The time is now.

977
00:56:09,840 --> 00:56:14,840
Jump into action, sir. You can follow the show on Twitter at Coder Radio Show.

978
00:56:14,840 --> 00:56:20,840
The conversation is always going in our network telegram. That's Jupiter Broadcasting dot com slash telegram.

979
00:56:20,840 --> 00:56:24,840
And then, yes, if you're matrix brave, there is a Coder Radio section in there.

980
00:56:24,840 --> 00:56:30,840
Our matrix server is Colony dot Jupiter Broadcasting dot com. You can join in there. There's Coder Radio feedback and all that kind of stuff.

981
00:56:30,840 --> 00:56:39,840
And of course, links to everything we talked about today, our feedback feed page and our RSS feed at Coder dot show slash four four five.

982
00:56:39,840 --> 00:57:04,840
