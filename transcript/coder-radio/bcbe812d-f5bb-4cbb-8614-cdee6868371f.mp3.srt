00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
This is Coder Radio, episode 400 for February 8th, 2021.

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Hey there, welcome in to Coder Radio, Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show,

3
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
taking a pragmatic look at the art and business of software development and the world of technology.

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
This episode is brought to you by a cloud guru.

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
A cloud guru now includes Cloud Playground, Azure, AWS, and Google Cloud Sandboxes.

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:43,000
My name is Chris, and sitting there like the podcasting soldier that he is at his post, it's our host, Mr. Dominic.

8
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Hello, Mike.

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Hello, Chris. Episode 400 was inevitable, unavoidable.

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Happy 400. Actually, was it inevitable? Was it? 400 episodes, man.

11
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
That's a lot of PHP hate.

12
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Yeah, it's like eight years of PHP hate is what that is.

13
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
It is double the age of my child of PHP hate.

14
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Yeah, that's weird. I hadn't thought about putting this in the age of my kids, but yeah.

15
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Wait a minute. I got married. Wait, you got divorced and remarried and I got married and divorced and had a kid during the run of the show.

16
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Yeah, that's pretty remarkable. First episode, June 11th, 2012. Do you want to be nostalgic for a moment?

17
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Oh, God.

18
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Here's the thing. I was looking around at the old episodes. Our websites, it's getting old, especially the ones from 2012.

19
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:36,000
There's like an old WordPress plug-in that's injecting download tracking code that shouldn't be there, like a pod track thing, not like a scary tracking thing.

20
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:46,000
And so if you had to clean all that out, I'll put a direct a direct download episode one, the MP4, which is pretty easy to get thanks to scale engine, if you're curious.

21
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
But OK, here we go. Check out this. This is some retro clips.

22
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:59,000
You know, I thought maybe what we do is just have a little bit of a reflective moment. We don't normally do this thing, but we'll go back in time.

23
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Here is episode one's intro.

24
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:15,000
You're listening to Coder Radio, Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show, taking a pragmatic look at the art and business of software development and related technologies.

25
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:24,000
My name is Chris and joining us every week is our host, Michael Dominic. Hey, Michael. Hey, how you doing, Chris? Hey, man. Welcome to the first episode. Thank you.

26
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I think I was breathing in helium during the show and you were in a bathroom for that episode.

27
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I mean, did I even like get confirmed or anything yet? What was I, 12?

28
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Oh, we both we both sound like children. Yes. Who are those kids?

29
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Actually, a couple of fun ones. We even had a song of the week in that episode. You and I kind of go through how we first started talking when I was looking to make native apps for both iOS and Android at the same time.

30
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
And we went from building an app conversation to building a podcast conversation.

31
00:02:53,000 --> 00:03:01,000
So we recap that in episode one. But there's there's a moment in the show where you're kind of bullish on the Windows eight Metro store.

32
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I got to I got to play that for you. One last thing at this point.

33
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Yeah, I see a lot of a metro hating in the IRC chat. Yeah, I noticed that.

34
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I just wanted to mention the Windows eight app store. So they're taking a different approach.

35
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Yeah, they're not saying all programs must go through us. They're saying all essentially tablet programs must go through.

36
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Right. Right. Or any desk like to have a desktop Twitter app. You know, you could, you know, you can but you don't have to. Right. Right. Right.

37
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:48,000
And that is probably the one market where this won't happen. Just because of the so much legacy, I'm going to be watching that Metro app store with a little with a little interest, but honestly, with more skeptical glasses down than I should.

38
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I'm going to be Mr. Skeptical pants with it, I think you're going to be feeling the hate, huh? Yeah. Well, you get a you get a lot right in the show.

39
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:05,000
You know, your batting rate is pretty good. You're hitting it. Whatever it is, you're hitting average is pretty good.

40
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:13,000
That was not my finest hour. No. However, in that very episode, you were kind of bullish on cloud apps.

41
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:27,000
You kind of get and you really kind of were way ahead of me on that one. I'll play that for you. So you are actually considering coding in the cloud to the cloud, baby, to the cloud.

42
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Well, I think there's some old school people that would think that's just absolutely crazy, don't you think? Well, OK, why is it crazy?

43
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:46,000
You're willing to have a Google Hangout, a phone call in the cloud. Why not have an IDE in the cloud? I mean, I will give myself one thing on that one.

44
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Is it that with VS code effectively is? Yep. One hundred percent. That's exactly what I was going to say. In fact, you could run it on a node server.

45
00:04:53,000 --> 00:05:01,000
And since you made that observation, that was that was code with a K back in the day. Oh, crap. Yeah.

46
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:06,000
There's been a few iterations of that idea since then. I forgot about those poor bastards.

47
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Yeah. Yeah. You were kind of you were kind of salty in the episode because you want them to hook you up with like a better beta account or something like that.

48
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,000
So you could test it more. Yeah. I was I was pissed off. I'm like, you guys have no customers.

49
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Come on. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So, I mean, but you were right. Like, I was like, what are you nutty?

50
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:31,000
And now here we have VS code, which is essentially an electron application using Web technologies. Pretty remarkable. So you were right on that one.

51
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:40,000
You were right on that one. I noticed that our website Coder dot show only goes back to episode fifty five due to an RSS feed size limit when we imported.

52
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Really? Yeah. Maybe for the better. I mean, those old episodes are a bit rough. Oh, I'm super OK with that, actually.

53
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Yeah. There is a method if you wanted to get them, but you'd have to be kind of crazy. I don't recommend them.

54
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:59,000
And, you know, we were learning what we were doing back then. Amazingly, to me, at that point, Jupiter broadcasting had already been going for a while.

55
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Yes. Brian and I were still doing Linux action show. He had just released or had recently released his illumination software creator.

56
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Oh, I forgot about that thing. Yeah. The real basic idea. Yep. And yeah, that's just and it's so funny to think, oh, we've been doing shows.

57
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I make some comment in there about how we've needed a show for years. Wild, man.

58
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:29,000
A lifetime ago. But to celebrate it, we are going to link in the show notes a special Coder Radio episode four hundred poster.

59
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:39,000
It's all four hundred titles in the numbers. Four hundred. It's it's the same kind of style we did for episode three hundred.

60
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:51,000
But this time upgraded with the new Coder graphics, the MP3 album background and all of our titles over all four hundred episodes into a word cloud that says four hundred.

61
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:56,000
And we will have a link to that in the show notes at Coder dot show slash four hundred.

62
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:05,000
It's like 20 bucks for a nice, decent sized size of a poster. Mike and I both have ours from three hundred and we both framed them. Love it. Yes.

63
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:11,000
So we'll have another one to put right next to it. Now we have to do this like every hundred episodes is now it's like a thing.

64
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Yeah. When our kids graduate college, we'll be at like imagine with the one thousand.

65
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,000
You know, technically you could make a two hundred and a one hundred poster, too, right?

66
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Because we know what all the titles are. I never thought of that. Yeah.

67
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:28,000
The word cloud just gets denser in some senses. But this one has the new logo on it since we refreshed it and all of that new to us still.

68
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:34,000
So that is in the show notes. But I really want to take a moment here and mark this occasion.

69
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:40,000
This is a huge deal for us. And I want to take just a few moments and tell you about something pretty special.

70
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:45,000
It's time for all of us to be productive and to be comfortable.

71
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:53,000
It took combining multiple platforms and online shops, making tons of phone calls, multiple team members researching.

72
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Oh, sweet Jesus. No, it's a product that is born in 2020 and early 2021.

73
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Mike, it's a product built for the new normal and we're calling it the coder.

74
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:17,000
That's right. The coder is a 100 percent cotton, terry velour, soft, cozy wear, feels great on the skin right out of the shower and works well all day long.

75
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Oh, for the love of God. It's embroidered right here in the US of A.

76
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:28,000
And for a limited time run, you can get a clean all black design that features a classy all white coder radio logo on the left chest.

77
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Look and feel comfortable while kicking ass. Life is better in a robe. It's not a house coat.

78
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:43,000
It's a house coder and you can get it your very own for a limited time at the coder dot shop.

79
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:49,000
That's right. The coder dot shop. So he did not tell me this was the coder dot shop.

80
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:54,000
That's right. You can hear those cherry blues for this one. Yeah. Check out the coder dot shop.

81
00:08:54,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Now it has temporary product imagery as we record now because they won't actually give me the high resolution graphics yet, but we're going to have something in there.

82
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,000
So it's a placeholder graphic, but it's that style of robe. You are a sick, sick man.

83
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I just want to. Yeah, it's pretty great. So it's and you know, we worked hard to get this right.

84
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:14,000
So pre-orders are starting today and they will run through February 28th at midnight.

85
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:19,000
It's sixty five dollars plus five dollars shipping domestic or fifteen dollars international.

86
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:25,000
We're still working that out. It is possible we will not be able to ship to all international destinations.

87
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,000
So some countries may not be doable if that ends up happening.

88
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:33,000
We will communicate that with you and we will, of course, issue you a refund.

89
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:39,000
But our plan is to start production in the first week of March, maybe about seven business days.

90
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Second week of March, we'll start shipping. So it's a pretty limited offer and it's happening.

91
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I just bought the first one because I'm a sick bastard.

92
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Of course, I was going to get you one, but that's amazing. I'll take two because I spill things all the time.

93
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Fair enough. It took getting rejected by so many fulfillment places that are like a robe.

94
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Are you serious? No, my vendors said, no, we're not doing that.

95
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Yeah. Yeah. I talked to places that are like known for custom stuff and they're like, no, we're not we're not doing a robe.

96
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:22,000
And it really it took it took the research of Jackie to find this outlet where we could possibly put up a get like an account with them and put in an order.

97
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:29,000
But we have to put them all in at once. You know, it's all these complicated things to ship a product like this and to get the actual logo embroidered.

98
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:37,000
But I went with a nice, clean black design and that terry velour softness that doesn't like get all weird if you do have it wet, but doesn't feel strange to wear all day.

99
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I mean, I'm going for an all day wear with this thing. It's the new house coat. It's the coater.

100
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Yeah, pretty proud. Pretty proud. Took way more effort.

101
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:52,000
I definitely during this process cursed my own name a dozen times thinking you stupid arrogant ass.

102
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Why did you say you could make a robe a little behind the scenes as insane as I think this is?

103
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I'm so happy he finally got this done because I'm tired of hearing about it.

104
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I know. And it's a huge it's a huge load off of my shoulders.

105
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Let me tell you, I was working so hard to get this going. It's in the future, Chris, coffee cups.

106
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Right. That's all they get. Right. Maybe T-shirts.

107
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:19,000
This is this in the poster is the first swag item Jupiter Broadcasting has done in over two years.

108
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:25,000
We haven't done swag in a really long time. And I wanted to bring it back in kind of a big way.

109
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
And yeah, that's where we that's where the coater came from.

110
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
You know, Robe Bros Unite. Go get your orders in.

111
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
We'll be batching them up and placing them in. Say Robe Bros Unite.

112
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Yep. Includes ladies too. Very excited about this.

113
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
So, yeah, it's a limit. I don't know if I'm ever going to do this one again.

114
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Although now that you have a robe fender, actually. True.

115
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
It may be possible to do it again if it goes well.

116
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:53,000
What I still don't know is it's possible that the international shipping doesn't work out or something gets weird.

117
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Like in the cost to order ratio or we don't get enough orders, you know, that could be a problem.

118
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,000
So there is a couple of scenarios where we just kind of have to say, well, we tried and it didn't work.

119
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:09,000
But I'm hopeful. I'm hopeful that the Robe Bros come through, maybe even get a couple, you know, and we make this thing happen.

120
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:14,000
And sixty five dollars is a great deal. That's just slightly above, you know, what we're paying for this thing.

121
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:19,000
But I looked at some that were like this nice. There were two hundred dollars depending on the vendor.

122
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:25,000
So this is this is a great robe for what some guys were charging two hundred dollars for Robe charlatans.

123
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:31,000
And so check it out. The Coder dot shop. And that's exciting.

124
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:38,000
That is exciting. We have some feedback to get into just because we're having fun on this episode, though, before we get into the feedback.

125
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Did you hear about this guy who compromised a Florida City water supply and started turning up like the lime or the Lyle, whatever it is,

126
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:53,000
the stuff that they use for cleaning, they turn it up to like a massive quantity. Did you hear about this guy?

127
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:58,000
No, I did not. What the hell? Well, see, this is why I got to follow the news in your neck of the woods to keep you safe.

128
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Here's a little bit of brief from the local sheriff on Friday morning at about eight o'clock.

129
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:12,000
A plant operator at the Oldsmart Water Treatment Facility noticed that someone remotely access the computer system that he was monitoring.

130
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:17,000
This computer system controls the chemicals and other operations of the water treatment plant.

131
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Yeah. So it's Lyle and our lie. Thank you, Wes. And sodium hydroxide.

132
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:32,000
The only reason they even noticed this happened is because they were using like go to my PC remote control style where you can see the cursor moving around on the screen.

133
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:39,000
And the technician was standing in front of the monitor and saw the mouse moving around and went, huh, that doesn't seem right.

134
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:53,000
When someone again remotely access the computer system and it showed up on the operator screen with a mouse being moved about to various to open various software functions that control the water being treated in the system.

135
00:13:53,000 --> 00:14:00,000
The person remotely access the system for about three to five minutes, opening various functions on the screen.

136
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:08,000
One of the functions opened by the person hacking into the system was one that controls the amount of sodium hydroxide in the water.

137
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:17,000
The hacker changed the sodium hydroxide from about one hundred parts per million to eleven thousand one hundred parts per million.

138
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Now, because the technician was standing there, he just changed it back.

139
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:31,000
But legitimately, if dude hadn't been standing there staring at his screen, this thing would have been set up to eleven thousand parts per million had been dumping this stuff in the water.

140
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:43,000
And I guess I just feel like we are at a point now where we have these massive security insufficiencies, like what happened with if you look at the solar wind compromise, it comes down to some incompetency.

141
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:47,000
It appears, in my opinion, that just some basics weren't taken care of.

142
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:53,000
And when you look at, say, the DNC leaks, John Podesta was phished with a link in his email.

143
00:14:53,000 --> 00:15:02,000
And when you look at things like a quote unquote hacker who PC Anywhere is into an old Windows environment and can change some numbers.

144
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,000
What is taken away from this is, oh, it's it's it's a hacker. It's somebody dangerous.

145
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Not we didn't build the system right. We didn't secure the system right. We didn't build for the future.

146
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:18,000
That should be the conversation. But instead, it's always like, oh, hackers are so elite. They're so sophisticated.

147
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Not really. Somebody knew about the PC Anywhere running on that thing and figured out how to connect to it.

148
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:27,000
I do wonder what the, I guess, perpetrator thought he was going to gain here.

149
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:34,000
I know, right? What's the point? You know, they're going to like slap him with some Patriot Act fun for messing with the water supply.

150
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,000
If they can find him, I suppose. There's no it doesn't sound like necessarily they know who did it.

151
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:44,000
It is Florida. Yeah, I know. That's what I thought. That's when I saw this. Oh, this is a nuke.

152
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Now they have Florida man, the hacker. Florida man with a Guy Fawkes mask.

153
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Right. What got my attention was Florida man hacks into water plan. I was like, wow, now Florida man has gotten really sophisticated.

154
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:02,000
I don't think we need to keep impressing the rest of the country, Florida. Let's just let's not do this anymore.

155
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Linode.com slash coder. Go there to receive one hundred dollars in credit towards a new account.

156
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:16,000
That's a lot to try out Linode because their prices are generally 30 to 50 percent less than major cloud providers.

157
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,000
There are cloud provider of choice. We're running multiple servers up there recently.

158
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:28,000
And to you dads and moms out there, if you're looking to create a safe environment for your kids to play online, this is how one of the ways I'm personally using Linode.

159
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,000
I mean, I talk all the time about how I use it for my business. It's obvious.

160
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Eleven data centers around the world means I can deploy stuff that's close to the audience.

161
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:43,000
I can deploy stuff that's close to the team. SSDs mean every machine has super fast IO, modern processors, 40 gigabit connections.

162
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:54,000
I mean, obvious reasons why I would use it for my business. Right. But personally, I've spun up a Minecraft server, a Rust server, and I'm kind of debating also doing an Arc server.

163
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,000
They just make it so easy with these one click deployments.

164
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:01,000
And something else I'm going to encourage you to check out is I'll have and I'll have a link in the show notes.

165
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:10,000
This is something you may you may be trying to solve, and that's messaging and delivering messages between applications without putting huge loads on the server, especially for really busy systems.

166
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:20,000
So you may be looking at something like MQ. Well, Linode has a one click deployment of Rabbit MQ, which is the most popular open source message broker out there.

167
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
You can just deploy it in one click on the note and they have a lot of applications like that.

168
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:32,000
It's not just the games or WordPress installations, but it can be back end tools that make your business more efficient or help you automate or help you deliver a product.

169
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:39,000
That's how we use it right here. It's part of the sauce that makes it possible for us to make podcasts super easy to get in that process all transparently.

170
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:45,000
And Linode has all kinds of these kinds of applications you can deploy with one click.

171
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:51,000
And I've talked about some games and and Rabbit MQ, but there's there's a whole category of them.

172
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:58,000
And what I love about it is there's there's just usually one or two options you have to answer and you're good to go.

173
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:03,000
And I like that because it saves a ton of time. It also makes it approachable. You don't have to be an expert.

174
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:11,000
And then the other thing that they do and they do this really well is they make it super straightforward to turn on backups to make sure you've got data.

175
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:17,000
And they tell you really clearly in plain language when it's going to be backing up, make it really simple to add your SSH key and get you up and going.

176
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:22,000
And if you ever get stuck, they've got support like nobody else. Nobody else does support like Linode.

177
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:31,000
And remember, if you go to Linode.com slash coder, you get that one hundred dollar credit. Play around with object storage, build a dedicated GPU system, try out a game server.

178
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:38,000
See what I've been talking about and support the show. Linode.com slash coder.

179
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
All right, we've got a few feedback items for for Hyundai to get into.

180
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:48,000
And this first one, I feel like only you can help a guy named Ryan.

181
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:56,000
He says, Hey, Mike, he's not even talking to me. I've been a Rubyist for well over a decade after Rails introduced me to Ruby.

182
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:03,000
In my experience, Rails and Ruby SQL and a handful of other Ruby based tools are unparalleled in any other language.

183
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:07,000
And at this point, I've just built up a tremendous set of skills in this ecosystem.

184
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:12,000
I'm not trying to brag. It's just what happens when you spend a long time with any given set of language and tooling.

185
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:18,000
But over time, my projects have become increasingly data centric.

186
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Sometimes I'm cleaning terabytes of data in the past couple of years.

187
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:27,000
I've been feeling just a little green with envy when I look at some of the libraries available in Python.

188
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Noonby and Pandas seem incredibly powerful, and I can't find comparable libraries in Ruby.

189
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:38,000
But I can't abide Python. It feels like Ruby's defective cousin.

190
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Excessive selves, parentheses and nono functions make my skin crawl.

191
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:48,000
I'm a warm, Ruby red blooded pumping man. It runs through my veins.

192
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Any tips you could give me on how you became so cold blooded?

193
00:19:52,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Every time I try, I flounder. How did you put down your shiny gems and pickaxe and slither into the world of Python?

194
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Thanks for the show. A guy named Ryan.

195
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,000
So the thing is, general purpose programming language can be used everywhere.

196
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,000
So please don't write into the show people who are going to say that.

197
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Python just has succeeded in being more commonly used in more domains.

198
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:22,000
I agree with you that I think the Ruby syntax and kind of the way Ruby wants you to do things is a little more elegant.

199
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Ducks for cover as snakes jump out of trees.

200
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:30,000
But there's just like, you know what, if you're going to do like some machine learning stuff, you're just not doing it in Ruby.

201
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Right. Even a lot of the embedded stuff I've been working on.

202
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Like, honestly, the next best choice for me at least would have been probably like dot net or some, you know, weird or I guess C++.

203
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Ruby is just not really part of the mix there.

204
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Ruby is not even like on the list is my right.

205
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Yeah. Yep.

206
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:51,000
So one, no one saying you have to do Python is my understanding.

207
00:20:51,000 --> 00:21:02,000
But if you want to branch out into some of these areas, particularly areas that I've been getting into, there are many choices, but Ruby is not really one of them.

208
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:07,000
You know, I mean, a guy named Ryan wasn't asking me, but he specifically didn't ask you.

209
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:13,000
No, no, I understand. But I feel like this is a symptom we see a lot.

210
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Working with thing for a long time, worried I'm getting stale with thing, eyeing other newer thing or maybe not newer in this case, eyeing other thing that looks like grass is greener over on that side.

211
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:31,000
This feels like a classic situations that developers write in all the time about.

212
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:38,000
And it's the languages like the characters and the objects change. But the core story, the core plot points are the same here.

213
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:43,000
I mean, since we're doing classic coder, right, just pick the right tool for the right job that you enjoy using.

214
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:49,000
But there is a particular problem with what's happened with Ruby in that.

215
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:55,000
I mean, we've talked, we've had a whole episode on this, that the Rails community basically became the Ruby community in so many ways.

216
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Yeah, and I think Rails is great. I you're not going to hear me bashing rails.

217
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:10,000
It's more if you want to move into other areas, Ruby is going to be a a limiting choice.

218
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:18,000
It's not impossible, right? I mean, hell, you could write everything yourself and like build up your own Ruby, you know, embedded framework.

219
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Madman. People have tried to do this. I guess I don't understand why anybody would put themselves through the hassle just to use a language they like, unless that language was Objective C.

220
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Oh, my God. And you think I'm bad with the robe.

221
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:41,000
That's OK. I just cancelled the Dell XPS 13 order because they told me now it won't come until April.

222
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Whoa. Yeah. eBay, maybe. Maybe you find something.

223
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:49,000
I mean, I just went on and got a Lenovo ThinkBook on Amazon for literally four hundred dollars left.

224
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:55,000
So I'll try the Lenovo train. Yeah. I mean, it's funny. Sometimes Amazon is the quickest way to get gear.

225
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:04,000
It's all the manufacturers seem to have really long delays right now. And I need a touch screen for this job because I just sold all my excess machines.

226
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,000
I'm rapidly buying them back. I'm not doing that again.

227
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Mark writes in. He says, hey, guys, I've listened to interest with all the talk about work from home gear, everything from computers to chairs.

228
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:20,000
One thing I haven't heard, a discussion on Internet connections.

229
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:28,000
He wants something bulletproof. He's done IT for 15 years and he quickly learned that one connection will eventually go out.

230
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:34,000
The easiest way to hook all this up to multiple connections is maybe some sort of load balance or a failover between multiple WANs.

231
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:39,000
He used to do this with PF sense, but then he bought Ubiquiti Edge Router X for about fifty five bucks.

232
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:45,000
And now he's using that. He says there will be outages from time to time that will go out or in.

233
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:50,000
So what he's done is he set up a VPN across both these connections. And that's an interesting idea.

234
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:57,000
So Mark from Connecticut is asking the audience and I want to pass it along to you. What are you doing at home for bulletproof Internet?

235
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:07,000
I've had quite the journey in the last six months for the RV. I wanted to get as industrial grade Internet as possible.

236
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:11,000
I mentioned it once on the show before and now I've done it.

237
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:20,000
I got that router that was built for public transit buses that's designed to install on a bus because that's essentially what I'm doing.

238
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:25,000
And I got two LTE connections that are unlimited through various methods.

239
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:34,000
And then I bond a VPN using a Linode, two Linodes actually, and I can do up to three, but I'm only doing two right now at the other end.

240
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:39,000
And then it essentially creates with their proprietary VPN technology.

241
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:46,000
This is a peplink product. It essentially creates a bond connection that can withstand either AT&T or Verizon.

242
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Those are the two LTE networks that I'm using.

243
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:56,000
It can withstand an outage on either one of them and I don't drop like a stream back to the studio or something like that.

244
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:04,000
The other nice thing about it is with most of my data encapsulated inside a VPN, the cell phone providers have no idea what I'm doing.

245
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:08,000
And they can't do things like force downgrade my video to 480p quality.

246
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:14,000
So it has some nice perks like that, although sometimes there's downsides. Places will reject you if you're connecting from a VPN.

247
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:21,000
So I worked on that for the mobile connection, and I've talked more about that in the self-hosted podcast if you are interested.

248
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,000
And I go into quite a bit of detail into all the specifics.

249
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:28,000
And then here in the studio, we just have a Comcast business connection.

250
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:37,000
And, you know, I know it's popular to hate on Comcast, but I'd say it goes out once every three years for like 25 minutes.

251
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:42,000
And that's been the worst of it. And we actually host quite a bit of stuff here in the studio.

252
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:48,000
I'm often streaming and transferring large amounts of data down and up.

253
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:57,000
I mean, easily, easily four terabytes a month of data comes in and out of the studio, and they've never given me any problems.

254
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,000
It's a business Comcast, so I pay out the wazoo for it.

255
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:05,000
Yeah, I just at home, I just use commercial, I'm sorry, not commercial, residential files.

256
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:11,000
And the server facility is its own crazy thing, but it's not. I don't think it's relevant to what you're talking about.

257
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:15,000
So how reliable is that that set up you have mobile set up?

258
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Yeah, well, it's kind of like fat cats is in our live chat room.

259
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:23,000
It's like bulletproof Internet might be a full unicorn because it's great as long as I have signal.

260
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:29,000
And I put an antenna array on the outside of the RV, which does a lot to pick up additional signal.

261
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:35,000
Gives me like a seven dB boost, which LTE signal is logarithmic.

262
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:40,000
And so if I can remember, I'm doubting myself as I say this now because I actually don't know if that's true.

263
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:44,000
But I believe it's logarithmic, easy for me to say.

264
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:51,000
And so like a six or seven dB improvement in signal is significantly better signal.

265
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:56,000
I can't believe I didn't mention this. So in very practical terms, I was getting 100 megabits in the woods.

266
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:01,000
I spent the last three days off grid in the woods in the RV.

267
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:10,000
And where we park in the woods has a pretty clear line of sight to an LTE tower up on a higher hill.

268
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:15,000
And so I get rocking, rocking speed on it. And it's pretty great.

269
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:19,000
And it's really, really solid until one of those providers dies, which happened.

270
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:24,000
AT&T disabled my SIM card. So now so I was down to one connection.

271
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:30,000
The system handled it just fine. But it really does stink.

272
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
All right. Well, thank you, Mark, from Connecticut.

273
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:36,000
So Mark reaches out and says, tell me what you're doing at home for bulletproof Internet.

274
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:40,000
If you've or if you've maybe recently changed up how you're doing Internet, let us know.

275
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:48,000
Go to coder dot show slash contact and drop in how you're doing bulletproof Internet or whatnot.

276
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:52,000
A cloud guru has a new course to help you ace bash scripting.

277
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:58,000
If this is something you haven't mastered yet, you can develop all the skills you need to write effective and complex shell scripts

278
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:03,000
that can automate mundane tasks and complex implementations as well.

279
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:07,000
Get a walk through all of the major components and keywords in shell scripting.

280
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
There's a lot of them. It's a good way to learn them.

281
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:18,000
We'll have a link to that course in our show notes at coder dot show slash 400 or go to a cloud guru dot com.

282
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:27,000
So Rust finally has a foundation, the Rust Foundation is here and Mozilla, AWS and a bunch of other companies are joining right away.

283
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:33,000
But the Rust Foundation writes today on behalf of the core Rust team, we are excited to announce that the Rust Foundation is here,

284
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:40,000
a new independent nonprofit organization to steward the Rust programming language and ecosystem.

285
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:47,000
This marks a huge step forward in the growth of Rust on several axes, which are kind of boring, really, to tell you the truth.

286
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:50,000
But they say Rust is much more than a programming language in a community.

287
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:55,000
It also represents a new radical way to collaborate on open source projects.

288
00:28:55,000 --> 00:29:00,000
The decision making power within the Rust project is uniquely delegated and distributed,

289
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:05,000
with the core team holding little more privilege than other more specialized teams.

290
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:15,000
Rust counts more than 100 members as leaders in the design and maintenance of the project and nearly 6000 contributors to the Rust language repo alone.

291
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:19,000
Why do I have a bad feeling about this? This seems like this should be good news.

292
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:24,000
And this is like an important milestone for every major open source infrastructure type project.

293
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,000
Yeah, why would you have a bad feeling? I don't know.

294
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:33,000
I mean, I guess it's like the fun's over and now it's serious. Maybe, maybe that's what it is.

295
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:36,000
Oh, mom and dad came home and now we had to form a foundation.

296
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Actually, if I'm telling you the truth, you know what I think about it. You know what I think it is.

297
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:47,000
I think it's this new radical way to run the project where the decision making power is within the Rust project.

298
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:53,000
They say it's uniquely delegated and distributed, with the core team holding little more privilege than the other more specialized teams.

299
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,000
I mean, that seems like that could be bad.

300
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:00,000
I mean, it seems like it could be great, right? Could be great.

301
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:07,000
It also could just lead to like Debian style, like Debian style, but worse kinds of disagreements and multiple.

302
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:11,000
It just really sounds like there's 6000 chefs in the kitchen.

303
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:16,000
I guess. I mean, what would the alternative be?

304
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:25,000
Well, you know what I like about the way the Linux kernel is run is that there's sort of this tiered system of decision making.

305
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:32,000
And you could argue that it's it's gatekeeping, but I'd argue it's as you become competent and prove yourself worthwhile.

306
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:39,000
And as a solid contributor, you work your way up the system and then you get to the top where like Linus and Greg KH and others are.

307
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:42,000
And I know that there is solid decision making.

308
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:47,000
And it is a kernel that has so much code inbound constantly.

309
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:58,000
It's it's a project that just is is really it's it's at a scale that is hard for a lot of us to even fathom the amount of contributors and code that is inbound to that project.

310
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:03,000
And I would imagine that if they had 6000 decision makers, it would go nowhere.

311
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:08,000
The project would be stagnant. It would just be choked up with with decision paralysis.

312
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:15,000
I could be wrong, but I like the idea that there's kind of a tiered structure of decision making.

313
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:19,000
Maybe for something like Russ, this style is better. I mean, I could see that argument.

314
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:25,000
I could see it both ways. Like if I wanted to run an open source project, you bet their ass there would be a tiered decision making structure.

315
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:29,000
Right. Yeah. I probably go the dictator for life thing.

316
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:36,000
But it's. I guess I guess you're right, because, you know what, the Linux kernel is one of the most successful projects.

317
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:42,000
And the truth is, they probably would have struggled more had they not had that tiered.

318
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:48,000
You know, at some point, somebody has to say what's right and what's wrong. Otherwise, it's always hot dogs and beans.

319
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:53,000
Yeah. God, I'd love to be playing this in eight years and be one hundred percent wrong.

320
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:57,000
I want to make that clear. Right. One hundred percent would love for that to be the case.

321
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:00,000
So we will see. I don't think you're wrong. I don't think you're wrong.

322
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:09,000
I kind of feel like I'm the guy crapping in the punch bowl now. We're all at the congratulations milestone party and I'm like the guy that's like, this is all going to end badly.

323
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:16,000
That's that's me now. You're like, we're all going to burn and none of you are sorry and you should really be sorry.

324
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,000
So let's talk about something good. Good news for you at least.

325
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:25,000
It seems that Homebrew finally has native Apple Silicon and more importantly, M1 support.

326
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:34,000
Now, that doesn't mean there's bottles for every package that are M1 compatible yet, but it means Homebrew itself is M1 ready.

327
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:39,000
And that feels like a milestone on the M1 platform for developers. Do you agree?

328
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:45,000
It does. Right. It's going to probably be a year or two before the packages actually get where they need to be.

329
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:49,000
This is a necessary step to make the M1 ecosystem work.

330
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:55,000
OK, now here's my crazy wild idea. I'm not the one that thought of it. It was Microsoft first.

331
00:32:55,000 --> 00:33:07,000
What about continuing that program that Apple was doing right after the M1 was announced, where they either contributed code directly or they paid developers to port a couple of core utilities that ship with Mac OS?

332
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:10,000
Apple is psychologically incapable of paying developers.

333
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:14,000
But they did it for the base utilities in Mac OS.

334
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,000
They did. They did.

335
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:21,000
So what if they just kind of surveyed what developers use, even if they just looked internally at who's using brew?

336
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
Just like actively spied on you. Yes.

337
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:29,000
No, no. Just look at their own staff, their own staff using brew and see because that's probably a decent data point.

338
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:37,000
See what they're using and then either contribute code, pay the pay your people to contribute code or pay those developers directly to make M1 ports.

339
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:41,000
Microsoft did it. I don't think that's bad. Why would anybody think that's bad?

340
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:47,000
It just feels like if you wanted to make this a great developer platform, you'd grease the wheels a little bit.

341
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:53,000
And greasing the wheels in this example is getting these tools you need to do your job ported over.

342
00:33:53,000 --> 00:34:07,000
I just I worry I had a I saw the announcement that an application that a lot of podcasters use to record their calls for these, you know, these style shows is just thrown in the towel and say they're not porting it to M1.

343
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
That's too much work. We're not going to M1.

344
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
Oh, man, you just hate to see it.

345
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:23,000
So if I were if I were Tim Cook and I were cutting some checks for how we're going to, you know, booster the ecosystem, as it were, throwing some money towards some of these projects, these top projects people install via brew wouldn't be such a bad way to do it.

346
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:27,000
I mean, we don't know that they're not right. We're just like talking out of our butts here.

347
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:38,000
They they well could be. Yeah, they could be. There hasn't been there hasn't been any reporting like there was some contributions that were made like this was sponsored by Apple or something like that during the big Sur beta.

348
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
True. We haven't really seen anything like that yet.

349
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,000
But maybe if anybody's out, if anybody has seen it, let us know.

350
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
I think it just be a solid way because otherwise you're right.

351
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:48,000
It's going to be two years and it won't even be 100 percent of everything.

352
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:53,000
Well, it's going to be you're going to occasionally hit like roadblocks where it's like, oh, this is so annoying.

353
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:59,000
Yeah. Yeah. And then you're going to podcast about it and people are like, but you got me to buy a MacBook Air.

354
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:02,000
I got a little bit of hands on time with Angela's M1.

355
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:08,000
Oh, and when is the Apple Silicon Action Show starting?

356
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:14,000
I need to go back and spend a little more time because we spend some of that like troubleshooting monitor issues, the monitor situation.

357
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
So bad, so bad.

358
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:28,000
It's not good. And and she hooked up a just a nice like, you know, like not like a fancy like ASUS style monitor, but, you know, one that was a couple hundred bucks back in the day.

359
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:37,000
She hooked that up over HDMI and DisplayPort and just had all kinds of problems, graphic artifacts, lines across the screen, depending on what type of connection she was using.

360
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:43,000
So she ended up getting a 1440p kind of more like a higher end monitor.

361
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
And that seems to be working just fine.

362
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:53,000
But it's one of those things where you get the new machine and you get everything ported over and she's not talking about how fast it is or how easy the process was to migrate over.

363
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:58,000
What she's getting hit with is the fact that her screen doesn't look right back.

364
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
Blaze won't back up properly.

365
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,000
This application has to be told manually to run under Rosetta.

366
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:06,000
That was her first experiences with it.

367
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:10,000
And it was interesting for me because I was like, I don't know.

368
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:13,000
I don't have the answers to a lot of this stuff. I've never used one of these before.

369
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
There was more of that than I expected.

370
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:26,000
That's my first experiences so far is that there was more of those things like printer drivers. If you if you migrate an Intel machine over, you like printer drivers have to be redone because that Intel stuff isn't going to work.

371
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:31,000
And all that has, you know, she's sitting there kind of figuring it all out on her own.

372
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:34,000
It's not really much I can do for it because I'm not there and I don't really have an experience with it.

373
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:37,000
But I was kind of taking notes of her process.

374
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,000
And now it's all said and done.

375
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:45,000
I think her her big takeaway and I know she's coming from an old like 2012 MacBook or something.

376
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:52,000
Her big takeaway is she can use her computer and watch videos and browse the web without her fans going all the time.

377
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,000
She doesn't have to hear the computer anymore.

378
00:36:53,000 --> 00:37:00,000
And for her, that actually is a nice quality of life difference because there was times where she couldn't hear the kids talking to her over her computer.

379
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:05,000
And so now she could she can hear the kids for better or for worse.

380
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:19,000
So I think it's an upgrade. But I just thought that's a funny like real user observation is that that's how the fan noise makes a difference to a real user is their kids that are talking to them from, you know, the other end of the house can be heard now versus not.

381
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:24,000
And we talk about in terms of recording or, you know, if it's if it's annoying or not.

382
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:28,000
But that's a real world reason why people like quieter machines right there.

383
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:33,000
I'm going to have a tough time going back to fans. So are you tempted at all yourself?

384
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:44,000
So far, no, because I really have I really have a pretty great Linux setup with plasma, really liking that with my multiple monitor setup and having window rules.

385
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
And I know exactly where everything's going to open on each desktop.

386
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:51,000
Although the other day I was experiencing some really strange graphical artifact issues.

387
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:56,000
And I also at the same time was having a hard time with an audio editor program.

388
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:04,000
And I was really just kind of thinking, oh, God, I just missed I'm dealing with things like the program doesn't work the way I want it to because it's maybe just doesn't have all the features I need.

389
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:09,000
And I'm having these weird graphical overlay glitches that make it hard for me to get my work done.

390
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:13,000
And that is just enough kind of friction where I can, you know, a little bit more.

391
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:17,000
I'm like, nope, I'm done. I'm out. And I don't really know why it's the system's been solid.

392
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:21,000
I'm not really sure why it just started happening. Could be some update or something.

393
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:36,000
But I'm not tempted yet if they came out with a machine that I could get like a 16 core machine with 24 to 32 gigs of RAM and four terabytes of storage or more.

394
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,000
And I didn't have to spend ten thousand dollars to do it.

395
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:45,000
That would be tempting because there is something to media production there.

396
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:53,000
But yeah, not quite. Not not yet. Not yet. Datadog.com slash Coder Radio.

397
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:56,000
Yeah, it's Datadog. Datadog is a tool for communication, really.

398
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:06,000
I mean, it's a full stack analytics suite, but it's really the mechanism that lets you communicate between teams and visualize what's going on with your entire infrastructure.

399
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:20,000
This episode right here of Coder Radio, episode 400 is sponsored by Datadog, the unified monitoring and analytics platform for comprehensive visibility into your entire stack in the cloud, on premises, both at the same time.

400
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:30,000
Datadog supports it all. You can quickly analyze the performance of your Linux servers in real time with customizable dashboards and troubleshoot issues with real visuals.

401
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:37,000
And it's such a beautiful layout to go to Datadog.com slash Coder Radio just to see how they visualize this stuff for you.

402
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:41,000
You don't even have to be a pro to understand these metrics, but you can really go deep.

403
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:47,000
And within seconds you can view traces, logs and key performance metrics all in one place.

404
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:52,000
They have beautiful, customizable dashboards and turnkey integrations for over 400 technologies.

405
00:39:52,000 --> 00:40:00,000
You can even use Datadog to monitor those key aspects of a Linux server alongside things inside a container or virtual machine.

406
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:03,000
And of course, the rest of your stack all in one place.

412
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:53,000
I have one last story I wanted to put in at least the notes for people to go read because it speaks to my heart and I'm curious to know what you think about RSS.

413
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:59,000
The author writes, I firmly believe the Internet and what it stood for peaked with RSS.

414
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:07,000
RSS or really simple syndication is a means of allowing basically anything online to be collated into a single feed.

415
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:14,000
You'd visit a website you loved, add their RSS feed to your preferred reader and from then on be instantly notified of any new content.

416
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:21,000
It was as simple as that. RSS primarily had a heyday during the Web 2.0 era, you know, 1999 to 2010,

417
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:29,000
when the freedom to do whatever you wanted with the information presented on the web was really the driving force between behind a lot of new features.

418
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:38,000
Then once social media took over the web, if there was something or someone you wanted to follow online, you just add them to your Twitter feed or subscribe to them on YouTube.

419
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:47,000
A fine idea until you decide you don't like the layout of the site in question or algorithms that decide that you don't need to see the work of those that you care about as often as you want.

420
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:57,000
It wasn't until I began working from home and everything in my life moved online that I really began to notice how beneficial RSS could be with relation to my digital well-being.

421
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:10,000
By selecting only the sites, blogs, creators, etc. that I had serious interest in, I could effectively remove the negative effects of social media and excessive online usage from my life.

422
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:18,000
You go to one spot, you get all the information the author points out also works great for like managing project feeds and whatnot.

423
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:27,000
There's a lot of ways you can bring some of that stuff into an RSS feed and so you don't have to get ever ringing notification bells and countless chats that steal your time all day long.

424
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:33,000
Instead, a lot of that stuff you could actually pipe into RSS and then have one spot you go to check on everything.

425
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:38,000
And not an insignificant number of sites still make a lot of their content available as RSS.

426
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:41,000
I use the crap out of it for all of our shows.

427
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:49,000
I have categories for all of our shows in there and then I've also trained the Feedly bot to have an idea of the topics that I most frequently choose for the show.

428
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:55,000
And I have feeds that the Feedly bot provides me that are like highlight feeds of like the thousand plus feeds that I have.

429
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:58,000
I mean, I really use it. I'm an RSS like guy.

430
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
Like me, I walk around with an RSS hat on.

431
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:04,000
But I'm curious if this is even on your radar or if it's even on the listeners radar.

432
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
I hadn't thought of it like that.

433
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
I actually would. I would consider doing that.

434
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
It's nice and Feedly is not bad.

435
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
There's other systems too.

436
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:18,000
In the show notes, I will link to, because why not, News Boat, which is a terminal based feed reader because yeah.

437
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
But I like it, man.

438
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
You know, I don't have to go look at their websites.

439
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:25,000
I don't have to go to a bunch of different places.

440
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:28,000
I even pull in YouTube channels into Feedly.

441
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:34,000
So I just have like the creators I follow on YouTube and the news networks that I follow just as feeds in there.

442
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
No, that actually does make a ton of sense to me.

443
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
I could see doing that.

444
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:43,000
It also is a nice way to pull in Reddit feeds without having to go to Reddit, which can be really nice.

445
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
But you have to pay for like their pro version for that.

446
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:53,000
I also resonate with this idea of cutting down on the number of fricking notifications and stuff.

447
00:43:53,000 --> 00:44:00,000
It hasn't happened for a while, but every now and then I'll lose an off air day to just chat and email,

448
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:03,000
just catching up and communicating and coordinating over chat and email.

449
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:07,000
And I get done at the end of the day, my hands hurt and I'm like, what the hell did I do all day?

450
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:11,000
It hasn't happened for a bit, but it's like a black hole for an entire day.

451
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:21,000
And if there's a way to cut that down and, you know, you could combine services like Zapier or Hugin,

452
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:24,000
which is what we use, like H-U-G-G-I-N, I think it's called.

453
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:28,000
We just talked about it last week on the show to like bring some of these things into feeds,

454
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
even like Slack conversations and whatnot.

455
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:35,000
So I'm curious to know if the audience out there still uses RSS as well.

456
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:38,000
I feel like if I don't advocate it from time to time, it's going to go away.

457
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:45,000
I mean, my problem with all that stuff is I get so into automating it that that just ends up being another engineering project of its own.

458
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
It totally does. Yeah.

459
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:54,000
Feedly strikes that balance for me because it knows based on other Feedly users, like what's the most popular stuff

460
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
so it can aggregate that information for you.

461
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:00,000
And then it does have that Feedly bot called Leo that you can train over time.

462
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
And that has been an interesting way to surface information.

463
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:05,000
And of course, it can also follow certain hashtags on Twitter.

464
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:10,000
So for the self-hosted podcast, we have hashtag ask SSH.

465
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:13,000
Anytime somebody fires one of those off, it shows up in my Feedly.

466
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:16,000
I don't have to go looking for it on Twitter. I love it.

467
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
And of course, it's what powers podcasts.

468
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:21,000
You know, if you go to Coder dot show slash subscribe, you'll see right there.

469
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:24,000
We just have a straight up RSS feed you can put into anything.

470
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:30,000
But like when you put it on Spotify or you put it on Apple podcasts, you're giving them the RSS feed.

471
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
That's what's powering all of that in the back end.

472
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:36,000
So I don't think it's going to go away, but I think it's less prominent on Web.

473
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
I don't think RSS is ever going away.

474
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
I mean that but it's less prominent on the Web, don't you think?

475
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:46,000
Like it's not as easy to get just entire story feeds or whatever in RSS.

476
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:50,000
It's it is what it is, but we'll continue to use RSS because Facebook ruined the world.

477
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:53,000
You know, it is social media. It's that damn social media.

478
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:57,000
And them kids and the millennials, they need to not be on my lawn.

479
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
That's all I'm saying. Yeah, I know.

480
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:03,000
Thank you to our coders at Coder QA, Coder QA dot co.

481
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
It's our QA team. They help support the show.

482
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
They get the Coderly reports.

483
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:10,000
And of course, they get the limited ad feed as well.

484
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:14,000
And we appreciate their support at Coder QA dot co.

485
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:17,000
Thank you for being a member over there.

486
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:18,000
Thank you for being amazing.

487
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:22,000
Yeah. Mr. Dominic, is there anything you'd like to plug this week before we scoots?

488
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
Yes, you should all watch WandaVision.

489
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:27,000
I agree. That has been fun.

490
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:30,000
I'm now I'm like two out now. I'm two out.

491
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:33,000
No, I've seen the whole thing, dude. It's good. It's really good.

492
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:36,000
It's really it's that's a fun idea for a show.

493
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:41,000
These Marvel series, they might if this is how they're going to be, they might be pretty good.

494
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:42,000
You know what I'm saying?

495
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:45,000
They're going to be pretty good. And, you know, as you're lounging in your Coder robe.

496
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:50,000
That's right. The Coder dot shop, not Coder, the Coder because it's the robe.

497
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:53,000
It's the Coder, the Coder dot shop.

498
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:58,000
And of course, we also have a link to the special episode 400 poster in our show notes.

499
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:02,000
Everything's linked at Coder dot show slash 400.

He's at Dumanuku and his company is at the Mad Potter Inc.

502
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:12,000
I'm at Chris LAS and the whole podcast network for all the great shows is at Jupiter Signal.

503
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:15,000
And this year's show has one at Coder Radio Show.

504
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:16,000
That's a great way to get show news.

505
