00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
This is Kota Radio, episode 330, for October 15th, 2018.

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Hi everyone, and welcome to Kota Radio, Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show, taking a pragmatic look at the art and business of software development and its related technologies.

3
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:48,000
This episode is really me, cowering in the corner, preparing to go into the BSD den while I seek comfort from my co-host, Mr. Dominic.

4
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Hello, Mike.

5
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Be careful if the pitchforks is three prongs, not what you want.

6
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:59,000
These BSD guys walk around with the horns, man, it's intimidating, you know? Because they're dangerous.

7
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:06,000
The BSD meetups and Satanist cults, sometimes people get confused and end up at the wrong place.

8
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Yeah, actually, you joke, but a lot, they, so they hand out these horns as sort of like a branding thing and they light up.

9
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:22,000
And then we, you know, you forget they're on your head and we go out and get lunch and we have actually gotten people thought that we were Satanists.

10
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:35,000
That actually somebody walked up to us and started to give us the riot act and we had to explain to them that we were, we were actually not Satanists, we were just really geeky.

11
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Yeah, see, if you go to a Linux convention and they give you like a stuffed, you know, tux, people just think you're a weird guy carrying a stuffed animal, which you also get, you know, younger men walking up to you in a full police garb saying,

12
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Hi, sir, what brings you to Toys R Us today?

13
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I have to tell you, though, listening to Alan Jude try to explain to a hysterical old lady that we were not a group of Satanists was the highlight of the trip.

14
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
And I can't believe I've never shared that story on the show before.

15
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Now that I think about it, it was so good.

16
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
You should have taped it and put it on YouTube.

17
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Oh, I wish I had. I wish I had.

18
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
It's at the time we were alarmed.

19
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Well, that's not what we're here to talk about, though.

20
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
We have feedback and follow up from last week's episode.

21
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:22,000
We might pontificate a bit on the future of dot net and more. Plus, if we make it, we have got some excellent hoopla this week.

22
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:29,000
We got a couple of massive emails into the show, so I'm going to keep it limited to just a couple and we'll go to those.

23
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Our first one comes in from Matthew and he has follow up thoughts on your observations recently of some interviewees from the local school who their most in-depth experience with Linux was the subsystem.

24
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
The subsystem on Windows 10.

25
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:53,000
And Matthew says, Hey, there, after listening to Mike's trouble with university students lack of Linux experience, Encoder Radio 328, I thought I might be able to add perspective.

26
00:02:53,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I'm a fifth year computer engineer student at the University of Florida, and I have heavily I have been heavily involved with the open source club here as a club.

27
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:08,000
We primarily work on student run open source projects as well as do workshops on different open source technologies.

28
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:14,000
He mentions that, of course, your favorite Rust is in there as well as Docker and a few others.

29
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
You're the Rust lover now.

30
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Though we like to nudge people towards Linux and quite a few Linux installations overall, most our members day to day OS is either Windows or Mac OS.

31
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I'd say around two thirds on Windows and the rest are on Mac OS.

32
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
There is not a lot of virtual machine use outside of a couple of classes.

33
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
They're really just too slow on most machines, given the other options available.

34
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Most people with Macs are happy just using Bash and Homebrew.

35
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Windows is a little more mixed.

36
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Most probably have the subsystem installed in which they in case they do a lot of their command line stuff there.

37
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:54,000
However, those with the Linux dual boot around 20 percent will switch to that for development purposes.

38
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I think a big reason most people don't use Linux daily is because the classes make it really hard to do so.

39
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:06,000
There are some courses that require building code on Linux machines, and then most people go to the computer lab for that.

40
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
We call it the dungeon.

41
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:13,000
A lot of classes require the use of Windows or Mac OS only software like the lockdown browser.

42
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:21,000
It's an anti-cheating browser that prevents you from looking at other Windows while taking quizzes and reports if it detects a virtualized environment.

43
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
It's also just annoying to switch back and forth between OSes.

44
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:30,000
So even the ones of us who do have a Linux distro installed end up just using Windows a lot of the time anyways.

45
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Not to mention there is an understandable fear that if someone messes up a Linux install, they might lose their data.

46
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,000
So I do think there is a lot of us with some Linux experience who want more.

47
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:48,000
It's just really hard to justify installing and using it when classes make it really difficult to do so on a day to day basis.

48
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Feel free to contact me though if you want any more information on this, the open source club, or anything else.

49
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Have a good one, Matthew.

50
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,000
So the classes, you know what, that is so typical, Mike, when you think about it.

51
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:08,000
A courseware that should be preparing you for the real world locks you into using the system that isn't the ideal for the course.

52
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
So that way they can make sure you're not cheating and things like that because that will prevent the cheating.

53
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I'm also curious as to what they define as cheating, stack overflow cheating, because if you're preparing them for jobs as professional programmers, yeah.

54
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:27,000
It's like the argument that when I was a kid, the hot argument was should we allow calculators in the class?

55
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Oh, those days are gone.

56
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I know, right?

57
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Those days are gone.

58
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
But now the argument should be should we allow Google in the class?

59
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:43,000
And if Google is a legitimate tool that you would be using to solve a particular problem and finding pages like stack exchange, should we allow it?

60
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:49,000
It would be negligent for a professional in the field to pretend like Google doesn't exist.

61
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
That would be considered negligence.

62
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Well, you wouldn't survive.

63
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
You wouldn't survive in the commercial market for very long if you didn't rely on that stuff.

64
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:00,000
But actually, you know, it's...

65
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Oh, this is going to get me in trouble.

66
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I love it already.

67
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:13,000
So there's a big difference between an academic computer science teacher and an actual professional developer.

68
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I am not making a value judgment.

69
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
No, yeah.

70
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:29,000
But it's like, you know, practical software development is very different from comp sci, you know, what's the fastest algorithm?

71
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
You know, all your bullshit, you know, N plus.

72
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Yes, it matters.

73
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I can feel your keyboards clanking and rage on the table.

74
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
No, I think it's fair.

75
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I think it's fair because a teacher of development has the job of being a teacher.

76
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
So they're taking care of student issues, faculty issues.

77
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:52,000
There is so much more that they are focused on than somebody who is a full time developer who is developing software full time.

78
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
And they're, you know, it's not like they're only developing software.

79
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:59,000
They're attending team meetings or whatever they might be doing, you know, screwing around on Twitter.

80
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:10,000
They they don't only develop, but it is it is simply not practical to expect that somebody teaching it could be as fully intimately versed as somebody who is doing it day to day.

81
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Unless maybe that teacher had 20, 30 years of experience in the field first.

82
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:23,000
That's unfortunate, though, because that means that the students kind of come away with a half baked preparedness like what I find is it's like pub trivia, right?

83
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Like, you know, particularly like what's the book, the Pearl Book, Programming Pearls is actually the title of the book.

84
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
But it's the book of design patterns.

85
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:40,000
And I read it once years ago, and I honestly could not name more than like 10 design patterns.

86
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,000
But I'm finding that.

87
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I guess I find the pub trivia version of software development very annoying.

88
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Like when people write, this sometimes happens when I go to events.

89
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:59,000
People want to talk about the most obscure crap and like the mathematical like, oh, well, that's actually inefficient.

90
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Actually, do you know what's inefficient? Not shipping. Right.

91
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Yes. In most cases, there's a I'll give you an example.

92
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:17,000
In a comp side classroom, you don't have a client breathing down your neck looking for a delivery for four hours and adding constant scope creep.

93
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Right. And I don't know.

94
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I mean, no one really cares in the real world if you use the most efficient algorithm.

95
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I am not advocating shitty work like that's not my intention, but I am also not advocating what I consider.

96
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:37,000
This is not going to be our G rated show, you know, masturbatory all comps.

97
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I'm doing this for a long time, Chris, you know, and every every year, you know, every time I get a little older, I find it more and more annoying.

98
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:55,000
And it really only matters in very few cases, and even in those cases, it doesn't matter all the time.

99
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I'll give you a real a real world example that I just recently learned of.

100
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:15,000
So here's why I don't like this is requiring software that's Windows or Mac only and preventing students from using Linux prevents them from expressing an interest, which could become a strength once they become employed.

101
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:22,000
And that you could actually be leaving them a little like one one arm tied behind their back kind of deal.

102
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I'll give you an example. I picked up the book that was recommended on ATP a few weeks ago, The Creative Selection, the book that goes into the development of the Safari browser and the keyboard for the iPhone as well as a bunch of other things.

103
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Super fascinating.

104
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:49,000
And the part that really kind of stands out to me and is a is a comparable analogy to this situation is the developers inside Apple were trying to create a Web browser.

105
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:57,000
They had decided that this was something that was a platform imperative, and they had a very strict mandate from day one.

106
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
It had to be fast, like everything had to be fast.

107
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Eventually, even every code commit change was tested against a benchmark to make sure that the browser didn't get any faster, and that even includes when it came time to add support for funky banking websites or weird little edge cases.

108
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:19,000
They had to come up with ways to support that stuff and still come through clean on the benchmark.

109
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:24,000
But before they got that far, they got stuck in the mud for more than six weeks.

110
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I mean, they drug on and on and on trying to get the original what they called Mozilla source code, which became Firefox, working on Mac OS.

111
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Tried to get it working because they were going to build their Web browser around Gecko.

112
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
It was a foregone conclusion. Netscape had open sourced this code.

113
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:52,000
It was the obvious way to go. And so the yet to be named Safari browser was going to be a Gecko based browser.

114
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,000
And they couldn't get it to build. They didn't get any help from Mozilla because the Mac was tiny.

115
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
This is this is pre this is pre Apple's resurgence.

116
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,000
So the Mac was tiny and Mozilla wasn't interested.

117
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:08,000
And so they began to scale their team, try to bring on somebody that could help.

118
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
They hired an individual as all this is in the book.

119
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
He had like a post interview with them, a post hiring interview.

120
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
It's OK. Tell me what you've been working on. Tell me what your struggle is.

121
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
And he listened to everything they said.

122
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:25,000
And he said, OK, well, we'll meet again next week. So he goes off for just a couple of days, two days, actually.

123
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Took these guys six weeks. He goes off for two days.

124
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
And he gets the Conqueror Web browser working.

125
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Because he was a passionate Linux user and he knew how to use Linux and he knew about the KDE desktop environment and he knew about the Conqueror Web browser and he knew he could get X11 working on the Mac OS and he knew he could get Qt working.

126
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:56,000
And so he created a shim to run Conqueror on Mac OS and in two days had a whole demo ready for them to go where they could browse web pages, they could click on links, they could go back in the web browser.

127
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:06,000
In two days, he managed to get a web browser up and running that had taken the team six weeks to not get beyond a screen opening and then immediately closing.

128
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:15,000
And it was this it was this sort of home turf advantage that he had because he knew about this project. He had been using Linux and the team had no insight into that.

129
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Now, if you can bring people into your team that have these different backgrounds of experience, it can be extremely valuable.

130
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:27,000
And so when they had that demo, they saw that demo. It was a foregone conclusion. We're going that way. We're going with KHTML.

131
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:31,000
We're going to go with that. We're going to have to pour it all over. We're going to put Conqueror over. We'll do the whole thing.

132
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:42,000
It was. They ended up kind of not really doing the whole thing, but they did end up going with KHTML, which became WebKit and now is the is what the Safari browser is based off of.

133
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:49,000
That guy solved the problem in two days, took the team six weeks and they couldn't handle because he was used to the KTE environment, right?

134
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:54,000
It was he was just familiar with something else besides the silo that they were working in.

135
00:12:54,000 --> 00:13:04,000
And that's really my core point here with the students. There is a market skill advantage to having experience with other systems besides Windows and Mac OS.

136
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:17,000
And for the students to be restricted from using those systems fully because of the requirements of the classroom, in a real sense, the very facility that's supposed to be preparing them for the real world is holding them back from fully realizing their possible potential.

137
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
It's really frustrating.

138
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Yeah. And just right off the bat, I would strongly recommend anyone read that book.

139
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Yeah. Good book. I'm currently reading it now. It's amazing. Creative Selection is the title.

140
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Yeah. Yeah. And if you have any tangential interest in software development or projects and things like that or Apple and iOS, it's worth listening to.

141
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:41,000
But if you're not even in the Apple or iOS stuff, it's great. He used to work at Easel.

142
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:47,000
So there's stuff in there about his early days with creating the known file manager. It's just it's a good book. All right.

143
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:53,000
I just want to jump back to our writer real quick. Good on you for starting a software development club.

144
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Yeah. The Open Source Club sounds cool. That's a great idea.

145
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
It sounds amazing. Sorry. The Open Source Club. Yeah.

146
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,000
They should all listen to Koda Radio. You know what I'm saying? They should all be.

147
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:09,000
They should listen to Koda Radio and they should also be very careful to not use Rust. It's very important.

148
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Get it out of here.

149
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:19,000
H Charles B writes and he says, I have some thoughts on testing. I agree that it's not the all be all end all of developing software.

150
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Nevertheless, here we go. Some sort of testing must be performed in order to validate the software.

151
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:29,000
I am familiar with the right test that fail and then write code that passes methodology.

152
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:35,000
If you need a methodology, it is one to consider. At present, I write tests along with the code.

153
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:39,000
That's not strictly the same as TDD, which is test driven development.

154
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Also, I haven't been involved with projects where I would very much have liked to have accepted the test criteria available from the start.

155
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:51,000
But that's really more getting into the specifications of getting a project nailed down before you kick off.

156
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:55,000
At present, I start projects by choosing a language and a unit test framework.

157
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:59,000
In some cases, the unit test framework is built right into the tool chain.

158
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:04,000
So like Go or Rust. And likely others.

159
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:11,000
I heard Rust drink. Yeah, and here's a good one for old languages like C and C++ and Perl.

160
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:15,000
There are subtle... Who you calling old, Willis? Hang on.

161
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:22,000
I know. C++ is not old. It is a modern, dynamic, general purpose programming language.

162
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
We can move on from here. Keep going. Sorry.

163
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:29,000
All right. So he says, he goes on to say, I agree with you really.

164
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:35,000
He goes on to say that here's some things he likes. He says you get instant gratification when you have unit testing.

165
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
You have testable code that's usually a better structure code.

166
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Parts can be exercised with corner cases and suspected trouble spots that might be difficult to reproduce in the finished application.

167
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Also, putting the parts together usually works a lot better if the parts are thoroughly tested before assembly.

168
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,000
That's not bad. Unit tests can be automated with tools such as Jenkins, Buildbot and so on.

169
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,000
All right. There you go. Yeah, taking a breath.

170
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Yeah. I mean, he's just saying if you test, you're a better person, I think is what he's saying.

171
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Oh, you're such a troll.

172
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:15,000
OK, in a hypothetical world, a guy I knew used to have a guy who used to work for him.

173
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:19,000
So a guy that had a guy that was working for him. So is this my cousin?

174
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:27,000
My cousin, my cousin Vinny, he hires this guy. His name's Joey, right? And, you know, Joey, 100 percent test coverage.

175
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Turned out all the tests basically didn't test anything functional to the app. They kind of just returned true.

176
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Joey, what are you doing?

177
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Joey, forget about it. Come on. No, it was bad.

178
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:49,000
It was I agree that some automated testing is appropriate.

179
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:55,000
I still I get what you're saying that theoretically, if you like, pick your test framework up front.

180
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Maybe I am like, you know, Paul or Saul rather on the road to Damascus, I'm about to be struck down and see the light.

181
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,000
But I just haven't seen the light yet.

182
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:16,000
I mean, I agree in testing business logic, computational logic, any kind of geometry, calculus, any kind of basically what I would call math stuff.

183
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Beyond that, I just haven't found the.

184
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Value in UI tests and that story about my cousin Vinny is true, like.

185
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:39,000
It's just hard to test UI, so at some point you don't want the automated GitLab or rather at the time, I think it was GitHub or Bitbucket pull request to reject it. So you just like fail out and return true.

186
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:44,000
It's bad. I would rather just not like write those tests because they cost money.

187
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:58,000
And I think the best way to test UI is to simply run your app, if it's a mobile app on devices or if it's a web app in browsers and, you know, use the one of your superpowers, which I call site.

188
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:04,000
To see if the UI is correct, you tell me, look at it and see if I'm telling you to actually like run through your software after you write it.

189
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:11,000
I know it's unpopular. I get it. Is that something is there like an Uber like app for that where I could just order up a tester?

190
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Is that something I could do? I think there is actually. I know you're kidding, but I'm like 90% sure there is.

191
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Well, that sounds frightening. Let's talk a little bit about your fun with the Microsoft Bot Framework under Linux.

192
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:30,000
I saw you tweeting about this the other day. What's going on over there?

193
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:41,000
I have been screwing around on elementary and pop with.NET Core, and I don't know how familiar we are all over.NET Core these days, but really quick.

194
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:50,000
.NET Core basically is an implementation of.NET and ASP.NET that runs on Windows, Mac OS and Linux systems.

195
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,000
I actually think it runs on BSD, but I can't be 100% sure on that.

196
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
They'll never admit it. They'll never admit it.

197
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Who would? They may execute you if you do it, but I'm pretty sure it runs there too.

198
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Alvin Jude comes to your house and personally gives you a beat down.

199
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
He's very tall. He's very tall.

200
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:13,000
He's a big dude. You don't want to fight him. Well, he's a tall dude at least.

201
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Previously, with the Microsoft Bot Framework, it ran on.NET, what I'm going to call.NET Proper or.NET Classic, which meant it only ran on Windows without some crazy hacky stuff.

202
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Even then, there were problems. Even then, it only ran on Mac.

203
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:38,000
If you were using C Sharp, you could always write Node and even Python for all my snake-loving friends.

204
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Now, we're up to version 4 because apparently the Bot Framework gets revved more than anything else that they have.

205
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:53,000
It runs on.NET Core. You can generate a project on Linux and it runs just fine.

206
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
That's rather impressive.

207
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
It's frightening.

208
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:08,000
I mean, JetBrains writer, C Sharp IDE or.NET IDE rather picks it right up, understands the project, VS Code on Linux understands the project, you have IntelliSense, you have everything.

209
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:13,000
That sounds like a cohesive development environment almost. I don't understand.

210
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Let's see.

211
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
It's almost like they love Linux, right?

212
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:27,000
You got a reply from Alex. It's just a heads up. If you run your bot in Azure and use the free tier bot service, the service likes to sleep and it doesn't take much inactivity for it to do so.

213
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Yeah, I figured that out this morning.

214
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Yeah, I didn't see the tweet.

215
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Better create a little script and just talk to it every now and then.

216
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Just like ping it, hey, look, Navi from Zelda, you there? You there?

217
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:46,000
So with.NET Core being such a thing, what's the future of.NET itself, do you think?

218
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:53,000
So.NET is like a dysfunctional Thanksgiving Day family dinner.

219
00:20:53,000 --> 00:21:00,000
You have old man uncle.NET proper who's like, back in my day, we had WinForms and nothing.

220
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:08,000
All you kids mix them with Linux and Mac. What's wrong with you? I was Xamarin. Xamarin, who lets you in the house?

221
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:22,000
We have.NET Core and we have.NET Standard, which if you didn't like my Archie Bunker impression, which I think ended up being more Red Fox because, yay, accents.

222
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:36,000
It's weird because.NET Standard is exactly what it implies. It's a standard where all these APIs work on all versions of.NET and they prefer the term implementations.

223
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:48,000
But not everything is in.NET Standard. So by using.NET Standard, you're limiting yourself to what namespaces and APIs you can call.

224
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:58,000
But the advantage is, one, you don't have to deal with PCLs, which are hot garbage and not that I want to take a hard position.

225
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:09,000
And you can guarantee, let's say you're writing a library or NuGet package, that it will work on all existing implementations of.NET, assuming a certain minimum.

226
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:20,000
That's pretty powerful. If you're writing some sort of data processing library, you kind of want it to focus on.NET Standard, if possible.

227
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Xamarin is the weird kid in this thing because Xamarin is very mono-related still.

228
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:39,000
I think what we're going to see is a great unification here of.NET Core and Xamarin at some point. I think it makes a lot of sense.

229
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:49,000
I don't understand what the value in mono is anymore because, in every case possible, you should probably be using.NET Core, not mono.

230
00:22:49,000 --> 00:23:00,000
The big issue with that roadmap is GUI applications..NET Core is really for console applications and ASP.NET and all flavors of ASP.NET.

231
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:05,000
MVC, Razor, Blazor, all the good weird stuff they have.

232
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:12,000
That's where you get into things like Avalonia, where you implement GTK-Sharp.

233
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:26,000
I think this is a temporary state of the world, and I think Microsoft is eventually going to collapse everything into one true.NET that runs everywhere.

234
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:38,000
I got the chance to go down there a while back and talk to them about open sourcing.NET Core and the other things that they were working on in regard to PowerShell Core and whatnot.

235
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:44,000
I asked them, I said, so does.NET Core eventually replace the traditional.NET?

236
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:50,000
They kind of looked at each other like, oh, that's the question we didn't really want, but then their answer was interesting.

237
00:23:50,000 --> 00:24:02,000
They said that they will have a long tail of Windows users and admins that will need some of the features that are in traditional.NET that they don't have any plans to put in.NET Core.

238
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:15,000
So for specific Windows admin tasks and whatnot, there's still going to be sort of a vibrant use case for traditional.NET, and.NET Core is more for the rest of the world outside of just Windows.

239
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:18,000
But.NET Core is effectively going to be the future, right?

240
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,000
There are some behaviors in.NET Classic.

241
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Well, I think the implied statement there is that Windows isn't the future, I think is what they were telling me.

242
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:37,000
I think two Microsoft people across the table were like, yeah, we're going to just keep that going for our legacy customers is essentially what they were telling me without saying those words.

243
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:42,000
I mean, I think Windows is still going to be an important platform for anybody who develops desktop applications.

244
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,000
But I don't think you're going to do it in.NET proper.

245
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:49,000
You're probably going to do it in.NET Core unless you have some weird legacy reason.

246
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Eventually. I mean, that might not be the case yet, but I think it's going there.

247
00:24:54,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Well, the problem now is there's no WPF, there's no UWP for.NET Core.

248
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:19,000
There's things like Project Uno, there's things like Avalonia, but there's no blessed solution from Microsoft, which for a lot of the types of organizations that are purchasing.NET software or.NET shops, not having that Microsoft seal of approval is a problem.

249
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Yeah, I mean, my bet would be Xamarin would get the right to love. Yes, that seems that makes the most sense, right?

250
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:34,000
It's they own it. They own it. I think you mean to marry it. Oh, I know. Tell us about Zimian, by the way.

251
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Oh, really? That's that's harsh. That's harsh. Zimian was OK.

252
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:45,000
So this is going way back in the Linux days. Zimian was this really cool company that made this awesome software management.

253
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:49,000
I'm trying to find the name of I think was called Red Carpet. Oh, I can't remember.

254
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Anyways, it was it was it was part of where Mono came from and all of that.

255
00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:03,000
It was the company that housed all of it. And they did other they made other things that were just some of the coolest tools.

256
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:08,000
I think it was I can't I'm trying to look it up now because I can't remember. It's called Red Carpet.

257
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Maybe I think it was Red Carpet. Yeah, that was it.

258
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:16,000
I think it was so great. It allowed you to manage software across multiple systems.

259
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:20,000
You get a subscription and then be able to like deploy software.

260
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Now all I get is nothing. It's all it's all gone away.

261
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:28,000
But that was really something kind of special back in the day. And I really enjoyed it.

262
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:32,000
So that's where the joke comes from. Anyways, that's neither near here nor there.

263
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:36,000
It makes me sound like an old man. You made me sound like the old man on the show now.

264
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Do you want to talk about this story? That's I mean, it's a little bit past now, but people are still kind of well, they're still talking about it.

265
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Is Microsoft contributing 60,000 patents to the Open Innovation Network?

266
00:26:54,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Which is a consortium, basically a patent pool, I suppose. I don't know if that's the right technical term, but it is a consortium of about 2600 members who are.

267
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,000
Pledging not to sue each other over those patents.

268
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:17,000
That seems what really, regardless of what the technicalities are, because many have pointed out that if you're not part of the OIN, Microsoft can still go after you.

269
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:24,000
And it does not include the components of Android like ex fat that Microsoft has patent revenue on.

270
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:31,000
People pointed that out. I think if you look aside from that and you look at if you look at the bigger picture.

271
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:41,000
This seems what this really is, is Microsoft trying to make the largest statement possible to developers who use these technologies to build applications.

272
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:48,000
And that is that Microsoft is on your side and that Microsoft is not going to be going after anybody for trying to use this stuff.

273
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:55,000
This isn't a bait and switch they're doing. They're really invested in these tools and these platforms, and they figured out how to make money off it, too.

274
00:27:55,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Is also probably what what the unsaid messages is that it's a juicy Azure money, right? Of course, yeah, of course.

275
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:09,000
So I'm curious to know what your thoughts are sort of from a development perspective, from a risk perspective and things like that.

276
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Let's say you're going to build an IoT device. There is perhaps less risk in the air now that probably was never really there.

277
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:29,000
But it's weird that you're looking at my calendar that I have a meeting to discuss building something on Azure spheres, but ding, ding, ding.

278
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:34,000
So I think this is great, but it has no practical impact on my life.

279
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:44,000
Yeah, when I think patents that will affect me from a development perspective, I think once that have attempted to affect me, it's never like Microsoft.

280
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:49,000
Right. I'm too small. It's always scumbag lawyer. Yep. Fails at being a lawyer.

281
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:58,000
Has a little bit of money from his practice, buys up some defunct pack patents from a startup out of bankruptcy, turns around and looks at the top of the apps.

282
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:03,000
And this is literally something that happened to me and decides to sue somebody charging four ninety nine for a fucking Mac app.

283
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:11,000
Yeah. Yeah. Or go after them for a podcast patent. Remember that? Remember that one? Mine was mine was text highlighting.

284
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:17,000
Oh, nice. How dare you? Yeah. Yeah, I'm I'm a monster. That is so IP right there.

285
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:33,000
That's it's pretty. Like, I don't know, I know, you know, since we've been doing the show since 2012, I have been a less like rage on Microsoft, except when they screwed me on when RT, which I still remember.

286
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:38,000
You guys are dicks when RT forever. Yeah, I don't think so.

287
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:48,000
Yeah, I know. I'm not really afraid of them from an IP perspective. I'm afraid of like semi retired lawyer who wants to, you know, put money in his grandkids trust fund.

288
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:52,000
And so I hate to make it sound like that. I would argue, though, that they have made an impact.

289
00:29:52,000 --> 00:30:01,000
It's for you. It's just it's not one about your legal risk. It is it is the lens in which you view Microsoft now.

290
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:10,000
Like it has further focus that lens in such that they really do honestly seem committed to this to this to this statement they've been making for a while.

291
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:16,000
And that plays that just plays a role when you're when you're making a calculus about Microsoft and their motives, don't you think?

292
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:21,000
Like it's sure it does make me more comfortable building on Microsoft technologies. Yes.

293
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Yes, that's that's the way to try. That's what I'm trying to get to.

294
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:31,000
Yeah. And and that does it is sending sort of a subtle messaging to not subtle, actually.

295
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:39,000
In fact, it's a very bold message to a lot of developers. I think it makes I think I think they're really making.

296
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:45,000
A calculated move here that is going to pay off dividends for a long time for the Azure platform.

297
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:51,000
I really even if they were to drop their Android licensing revenue, the statement, the messaging here,

298
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:57,000
the communication to developers, I think is is brilliant. It's a I think this is a masterpiece.

299
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:00,000
What Microsoft has been doing for a couple of years.

300
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:09,000
It nobody's nobody is being this respectful and this committed to creating tools and platforms for developers, at least from what I will say.

301
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:13,000
Yeah, I will say for this next project, I'm hoping to kick off after Griffin.

302
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:22,000
We're evaluating a number of IOT boards and no one has been more responsive or supportive than Microsoft.

303
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:26,000
They're hungry. It's one of those. I'm sorry.

304
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:34,000
When it comes to getting developers on board and using their tools and using Azure, they legitimately seem hungry the way a young company seems hungry.

305
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:39,000
Yeah, they do. It feels like talking to another tiny company. I have to remember, wait, this guy's from Microsoft.

306
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:46,000
They're like, you know, but they're you know, they're willing to do all kinds of things like here's some documentation.

307
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:56,000
We'll put you on the phone and engineer like it's. It's something if you would ask me like even five years ago, I never I in a million years,

308
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:03,000
never would have expected this kind of frankly support from from Microsoft, right?

309
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:11,000
It feels weird. I got to be honest because, you know, I wasn't I wasn't an old Linux hand like you, Chris.

310
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:15,000
But, you know, when you're a Mac guy, you're not particularly fond of Microsoft.

311
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:19,000
Yeah, right. Yeah, that's true. There was a lot of bad blood there for a long time.

312
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:28,000
Yeah, I was. You know, it's. I never would have guessed.

313
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:39,000
Right. Like, you know, listeners of the show will know I dealt with another large software vendor who charges for software and.

314
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:54,000
Just the difference between dealing with them who is on paper more friendly to Linux based projects and dealing with Microsoft is like night and day.

315
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:58,000
I still have some fear. Like, you know, Azure is not cheap.

316
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:05,000
I worry about too much of my stuff being tied into Azure. Sure.

317
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:09,000
Yeah, actually, Chris, I'm going to take a side tangent here.

318
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:14,000
If you're running GitLab CE, you need to patch it to the current version.

319
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:18,000
I wonder if I wonder if we had I just did that this morning. There's a security exploit.

320
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:24,000
Oh, good. Yeah. So just a quick heads up now. You have to be like three versions behind for it to matter.

321
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:28,000
But yeah, just a. Yeah.

322
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:36,000
Now, I think I think we've we've we've treaded on this ground before about the long shift that everybody's had to make in regards to their view of Microsoft.

323
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:41,000
And so it feels a little a little over treaded, but they keep making these shifts.

324
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:47,000
They managed to I think the reason why the conversation keeps coming back up is they keep making these shifts that are surprising.

325
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:52,000
You think just when you're getting comfortable with, OK, so that's the wow, that's their commitment. That's their level. OK.

326
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:57,000
And then then the next shoe drops. And then it's a whole nother range of stuff.

327
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:02,000
Sixty thousand patents is going to make the O.I.N. network a serious contender.

328
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:06,000
Their membership rates are going to skyrocket. It's going to be it's going to be huge.

329
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,000
There's going to be all kinds of companies that join that to enjoy that.

330
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:18,000
If you can afford it, the beautiful thing about O.I.N. and I am not an attorney, Chris is not an attorney, though he does play one on TV or a graphic channel is O.I.N.

331
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:23,000
is a mutual protection treaty, right? It's effectively NATO for patents, is it not?

332
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:26,000
Yeah, I suppose so. Right.

333
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:36,000
So if you're a company who's big enough to afford membership there, but small enough that you would have to you would forcibly have to settle patent lawsuits.

334
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,000
O.I.N. might be what you want.

335
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:42,000
Yeah, well, well, there you go.

336
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,000
They keep the keep that the times they keep on changing.

337
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:49,000
I'll just give a quick mention. We have a link in the show notes about this Redis lab situation.

338
00:34:49,000 --> 00:35:03,000
The Fedora and Debian community are discussing potentially forking Redis or Redis modules because of a common clause, which has been added on top of the license.

339
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:08,000
It's essentially a sub license for some of these modules that says you can't earn any money using them.

340
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:18,000
So these modules that were parts of Redis that have been in some cases contributed by the open source community have their license amended.

341
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:24,000
They're still open source. You just can't make any money off them now, which both Debian and Fedora.

342
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:28,000
Well, how the hell are we going to ship that? Like, that's not free software.

343
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:36,000
That's restricting what the user can do with the software. And, you know, we've got users that use Ubuntu, which is based on Debian, and they're using this stuff to make money.

344
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:40,000
So this isn't going to work. And so now the talk of a fork is coming up. It's a messy situation.

345
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:43,000
I have no idea what Redis is thinking.

346
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:53,000
And the potential canary in the coal mine in this particular instance, at least according to one of the module developers who was tweeting about this situation.

347
00:35:53,000 --> 00:36:07,000
He says that prior to the announcement, Redis Labs asked him to sign a contributor license agreement, a CLA, which granted the copyrights and patent rights of their contributions to Redis Labs.

348
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:18,000
The developer comments, it just seems like such a great coincidence that they introduced the clause in the CLA right after ensuring they had all the rights on the contributors made to the projects.

349
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:23,000
It just seems really strange they added that, ensuring that anybody couldn't make claims on the software.

350
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:29,000
It was like the CLA dropped and then the new common clause sub licenses said don't make any money dropped.

351
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:36,000
So the community's red hot pissed at Redis, Redis Labs, and a fork is brewing.

352
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:40,000
Have I mentioned how I feel about patent and IP lawyers yet today?

353
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:46,000
It is one of those things, you know, you watch this, you want to read more, we'll have a link in the show notes, but I just thought, geez, right?

354
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:50,000
I read the article. This just sounds like a complete waste.

355
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:58,000
Like, I'm not saying who's right, who's wrong, but this is one of those things where, you know, you're all very smart people, you're software engineers.

356
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:03,000
Maybe we could do something productive together instead of just being assholes.

357
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:06,000
Now, what? You crazy. You crazy.

358
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:10,000
I know. I understand. And by the way, I heard a rumor about you.

359
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,000
Oh, me, huh?

360
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:14,000
Oh, we're going off the rails here, buddy.

361
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,000
I heard that you are now a partisan.

362
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:21,000
Oh, yeah. What kind of for which particular flavor?

363
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:26,000
KDE. I've been listening to the Linux action show. Yeah, that is kind of me.

364
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:31,000
Yeah, I have. I mean, you know, it's not for everybody. I'm going to give you that.

365
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:35,000
OK, can I make a confession on the air? Yeah, I think I'm in love with Cassidy.

366
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:39,000
Oh, from from elementary elementary. It's that beard.

367
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:42,000
It's it's Mac, but on good hardware.

368
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:46,000
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I love it when you say that to them, by the way.

369
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:50,000
It's yeah, that is true. Yeah, I think so.

370
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:57,000
Here's what I think is I think that in my personal opinion are there are two great desktops for Linux right now.

371
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:02,000
And Plasma is the one that is a utilitarian workhorse.

372
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
It is a tackle box. It is.

373
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:09,000
It's got all kinds of drawers and you've got a few extra screwdrivers in there that you don't need to use.

374
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:14,000
But every now and then you open up that talk about, you know, like, holy crap, I've been wanting my tackle box to have this for 20 years.

375
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:18,000
I can't believe this is finally here. So that's KD Plasma.

376
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,000
In fact, check out error dot show slash 50.

377
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:29,000
Joe Pope and Daniel Fore from elementary OS try to kick around why there's so much hype around Plasma Day and try to understand what all the hype is about.

378
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:33,000
Shifting gears, though, to the second best desktop, it is got to be.

379
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:36,000
And I can say because I've I've seen the prerelease.

380
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:41,000
Aqua. No, it's Juno. Juno is I'm running the RC right now.

381
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:49,000
And elementary OS 50 Juno, which is the release that's coming out very soon, is.

382
00:38:49,000 --> 00:39:00,000
It is it is unbelievably refined. I guess what I'm really just take just if you just take screenshots of individual components of the OS and look at them on their own in isolation.

383
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
They sent out a press kit where they did this.

384
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:08,000
They took screenshots of various parts of the different application interfaces so you could just look at them and analyze them.

385
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:14,000
And it's so well done. There's really nothing quite that refined on Linux.

386
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:28,000
Plus, it's well-performant. I will say, though, one of the weird side effects of running elementary on my workstation is I am now preferring apps developed for elementary in the volatile.

387
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:36,000
Sure, because it all is consistent. It all looks just right. The shortcuts are exactly what I expect them to be.

388
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:51,000
Now, I'm still running pop in my Gallego. I don't know, you know, what I'm going to do long term, but I wouldn't be surprised if I end up just being an elementary guy because this is stable, pretty.

389
00:39:51,000 --> 00:40:00,000
And I'm not running a bunch of electron apps other than Slack. The other thing that's nice is at the end of the day, you have that Ubuntu base, which is well supported.

390
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:05,000
There's tons of how to guides. There's tons of devs and software available.

391
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:19,000
So you you have the you have the access and availability to the world's best supported desktop Linux distribution while running it on in a refined UI that I in my opinion is architected better than Nome Shell.

392
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:33,000
And has an outstanding starting guide for developers with a consistent messaging throughout the entire guide on how to build applications, how to distribute those applications to elementary users and how to monetize the application.

393
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:38,000
And in Juno, they're introducing a new feature where I don't know why other app stores couldn't figure this out.

394
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:51,000
It took that it took the guys at elementary OS, I guess, to figure out how app store should work in their app center. Now in Juno, you can try an application before you buy it.

395
00:40:51,000 --> 00:41:01,000
Get ready for that. You can try an application before you buy it. And then later on down the road, like when you go to do updates, it'll say, hey, you've been using this application for about three weeks.

396
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:04,000
And now there's an update available. Would you like to kick him a buck?

397
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:11,000
It's weird. I feel like I used to know a guy who for a number of years has been saying we should have free trials of professional desktop software.

398
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:15,000
It's weird, huh? Yes. I think I think it's a really solid platform for you.

399
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:20,000
And, you know, there is cross pollination between the pop OS developers and the elementary OS developers.

400
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:23,000
They collaborate quite a bit. I know I've met Cassidy.

401
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:27,000
So question, though, this and this is something I probably shouldn't ask you.

402
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:36,000
But let's ask you your Linux, man, if I were to write in Linux, man, it's like Batman, but like Florida, man, you're Florida, man.

403
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:39,000
You're Florida, man. And I'm like, I am not Florida, man.

404
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:43,000
You know what? I I have I have yet I have yet to put a burning tire on my lawn.

405
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:53,000
Fair enough. Just saying. If I were to write an application and follow for elementary, would it just come over to Nome and Katie?

406
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:58,000
You know, right. No, that's possible. You probably I mean, I'm not sure if all the valid dependencies would be there.

407
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:01,000
But yeah, that's where things fall apart.

408
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:05,000
There are many ways to run those elementary apps.

409
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:09,000
It's a flat pack and make it wildly insecure. That's there.

410
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:13,000
I mean, there are non non universal packaging ways to get those elementary OS apps right now.

411
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:17,000
For better or for worse, you can get them outside the App Center and run them on any Linux you want.

412
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:23,000
But interesting. A flat pack or a snap would be the way to do that. That'd be that'd be ideal, really.

413
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:28,000
And flat packs. I can see a snap. I should. Yeah. And they're pretty easy to make, really.

414
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:31,000
I can make them. So if I can figure it out, just anybody can.

415
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:34,000
I never really did get a Deb figured out, but I can get.

416
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:38,000
Listen, if you can co-sign for the iOS app store, you can basically do anything.

417
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:43,000
Yeah. So check it out. Just before we go. Yeah. But you're right. Check it out.

418
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:51,000
Juno is going to be out soon. I plan to have Daniel Fore on tomorrow's Linux Unplugged Tuesday, which by the time this is coming out, it'll already be out.

419
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:55,000
It'll be at Linux Unplugged slash 271, I believe.

420
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:59,000
And I'll have an interview with Daniel on there. And I got a couple of questions for him.

421
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:03,000
So if you have any drop me drop them in slack. If you have questions about the project or.

422
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:09,000
Well, I have one question and I'll say it on the air here because I want to let the comments blow up.

423
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:15,000
Why Vala? Why Vala? OK. All right. I'll ask. I've asked him before.

424
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:19,000
But yeah. Yeah. All right. Well, I got one more story.

425
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:23,000
I thought maybe we could chat about before we run for the day. I had debated.

426
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:29,000
You know, I think Adobe announcing their cross-platform rush editor and also trigger me.

427
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:38,000
No, I'm not. I'm just saying and also mentioning Photoshop CC for the iPad, which actually seems legitimate is big because I've been debating getting the iPad to supplement my Linux workstation.

428
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:42,000
So I can open up my Photoshop files. That'd be nice. But that's not I don't want to talk about that.

429
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:48,000
Instead, I just thought it'd be fun to give Google a bit of a kicking. And this is really all in, you know, good natured humor because.

430
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:52,000
Can we can we talk about the Adobe thing? Do you have a minute? Sure, I do. I just figured we didn't have anything to say.

431
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:59,000
So I have lots to say. Of course. Yeah. This is this is a sensitive subject.

432
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:06,000
Remember WinRT? I think I mentioned it earlier in the show. Yeah, I vaguely do recall it vaguely.

433
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:15,000
The idea of a productivity tablet that I could develop pro level software for is like a fantasy of mine.

434
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:21,000
I don't understand what could be in the new iPad Pro that would make that more viable.

435
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:29,000
Now, I know by the time we release a show, we could already know everything. Right. It comes out next week or a couple of days.

436
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:38,000
Yeah. Spoiler alert. We're prerecording because I'm at MeetBSD. So which really means he's chained in a basement and they're forcing him to wipe out Linux install.

437
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:43,000
They're making me apologize for Linus is what's going to happen. Oh, man, they're going to risk a desperate cry for help.

438
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:49,000
Oh, man. It's just like an SOS. They are going to rid me about Linus so much. You know that.

439
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:56,000
You know what's funny? I I went to a dotnet meetup and people knew about the Linus thing.

440
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:02,000
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Well, it was. And I went out my Gallego program. Oh, you're running Linux. Oh, yeah.

441
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:07,000
What's wrong with you? It's a general it's a general story. And they already very closely follow the politics of Linux.

442
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:16,000
So that way they have fodder for their jokes. Yeah. So. So why why is this different now, I guess?

443
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:23,000
I think it's why I think it's different now because the market has had a couple of years to get a little better.

444
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:30,000
Like there's apps like air mail, which are just fantastic email applications that didn't exist a few years ago.

445
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:42,000
And the machines got more powerful. And then I think Marzipan may result in a lot more iPad apps because essentially to make a Mac iOS app, you make an iPad styled app.

446
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:46,000
And so you get the iPad app for free. Right. This is what I think.

447
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:54,000
Right. First of all, there's a big delta between air mail and Photoshop. Right. Like a huge, huge fair.

448
00:45:54,000 --> 00:46:13,000
I think it's Marzipan. I think the bet Adobe's making is that if I write a pro iPad pro version of my software one, you know, crazy guys like Mike Dominic who really, really, really want to do pro level work on tablets will buy a new iPad pro and like buy my software.

449
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:21,000
And then in a year, I'll be able to run it on a Macintosh. Did you see the Google slate, the pixel slate? Yeah, it's not going to it's not going to go anywhere.

450
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:34,000
I think I think so here. I'll tell you my my my thoughts around why a professional tablet appeals to me now instead of I've never even I've been without a tablet for nearly two years.

451
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:38,000
I just I did not have a use for them. And I just eventually thought, you know what?

452
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:47,000
I'm not using mine enough. And I gave it to my son and now he has it. And I've I've come around on it because.

453
00:46:47,000 --> 00:47:01,000
Some of the tools I prefer to use, some of the applications I prefer to use are legitimately better in mobile versions, the Zoom meeting app, the Slack chat app, the mail application.

454
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:12,000
I like those better than I like the desktop equivalents. I prefer to use them on mobile, but my phone is too small and I kind of want to have it next to my laptop in a stand, maybe even up like a like on an arm.

455
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:17,000
So it's at the same level as my screen with a keyboard paired via Bluetooth.

456
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:21,000
I think that's going to be my work set up switching between applications.

457
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:39,000
And then I want to be able to at the end of the day, take that tablet home or take that tablet with me and sort of go quasi offline. I can still do all of my pro communications, all my work communications, all my all my biz dev stuff.

458
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:44,000
But not necessarily like the show research and show prep and all that stuff that I need a laptop for.

459
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:56,000
And I feel like that that kind of balance where I move off a lot of those electron apps and move them to native apps, well, quote unquote, native apps on on the iPad.

460
00:47:56,000 --> 00:48:04,000
Is sort of a vision telling me is it sounds like what you're saying to me is something that you and I have been saying for years, native is better than electron.

461
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:08,000
Yeah, I mean, really, a lot of cases where they're just probably.

462
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:20,000
Rendering web pages inside the way it's like. Yeah, that's true. But, you know, really, if it just works better, that's what I'm going for is that's where the division of labor is going to be is those types of applications go on the tablet.

463
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:26,000
And it is kind of like having a second. I've always had two computers on my desk.

464
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:40,000
And I've just since I was literally a kid that that could collect computers, I mean, middle school, from middle school on to now, I have had two computers on my desk, sometimes more if I could fit them.

465
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:51,000
And this is been sort of, I think, the evolution of that. Now I'm going to have this and my laptop on my desk.

466
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:56,000
That's my suspicion. I know I'm crazy, but maybe guys like you finally gotten to me, right?

467
00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:01,000
You're not crazy when the iPad Pro, the first 12 inch one came out. I think we did a show about it and I was all excited.

468
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:05,000
But then the market just wasn't there for professional software. Right.

469
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:09,000
So I guess the thing I'm going to respond really quick. Sorry, I don't mean to interrupt.

470
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:16,000
It's just before we go too far off topic. Emily plus plus is why not just put an external monitor on an arm and hook that up to the laptop?

471
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:22,000
Because then you have the keyboard and all of that. It's mainly a preference of the applications. I just don't think there is good on the laptop.

472
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:29,000
And not only is it the applications, specifically mail, mail spring is good on Linux, but.

473
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:36,000
I need something much more robust. I deal with a lot of email from both the J.B. audience and also Linux Academy.

474
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:41,000
I deal with a ton of email, so I need something and I have like six or seven or eight accounts.

475
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:46,000
Why don't you just ignore most of your mail like I do? I try to. Yeah. Yeah. That has caused other problems.

476
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:51,000
I actually don't do that. I reply to everybody usually. So the mail spring application is OK and it does do that.

477
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:55,000
But I want something more robust. And the other thing is, is those applications.

478
00:49:55,000 --> 00:50:00,000
Not only are they better on the iOS version, but it means I can remove them from the laptop.

479
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:08,000
So the laptop is doing less things. It's consuming less memory. It has less CPU drag and all of that stuff is contained on the iPad.

480
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:14,000
So if I want to go into full research mode on the laptop, I want to go deep on a topic and I don't want any distractions.

481
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:28,000
I don't have all my messengers blaring at me. Every new meeting request and email and telegram that comes in and slack message that comes in will be confined on the iOS device, which has a sophisticated D&D and downtime management system.

482
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:34,000
And the laptop will be a place of work where I can write or research or prepare.

483
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:41,000
And that to me could be a very valuable division of labor that I can very easily just turn on.

484
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:45,000
No distraction mode. I don't know. I could be wrong. I'm going to experiment with it.

485
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:50,000
If they release an iPad pro soon, I may pick it up and give it a go and report back.

486
00:50:50,000 --> 00:51:02,000
I might pick it up, too. Well, no, because I honestly want to see that Star Trek future where we have professional software and tablets, especially because you and I travel like, you know, we're like hobos, basically.

487
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:06,000
I know gypsies. I literally am. I literally live in an RV and I move it around all the time.

488
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:12,000
Like it. Bless me, Father, for I've seen it. Can I make a confession? Yeah.

489
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:17,000
One of the most versatile travel devices I have is my Windows convertible HP Spectre. Oh, really?

490
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:25,000
Because it's just super. Well, if I'm walking around like a hanger or whatever the hell I'm doing, I can use the pen and make notes or.

491
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:32,000
So you like having the pen, huh? I hadn't really made love. I hadn't gone that far yet in my decision process, but it's heavy, right?

492
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:42,000
So if I had like a 12 inch iPad pro with a better dirty little secret that iOS developers won't want to tell you, the Apple pencil sucks.

493
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:47,000
The pen support on Windows is a lot better. Like, I just want to say this again.

494
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:56,000
WinRT was great. Wow, I think that's that's that's almost it right there in the show. I think it is actually.

495
00:51:56,000 --> 00:52:05,000
All right, Mr. Dominic. Well, hopefully I'll survive, meet BSD and be back for an episode, which as far as people are listening, will just be at the regular time.
