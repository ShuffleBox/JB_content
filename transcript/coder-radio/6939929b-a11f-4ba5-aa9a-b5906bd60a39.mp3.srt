00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Hello friends and welcome into KOTORadio, Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show

3
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
taking a pragmatic look at the art and business of software development and the

4
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
world of technology. This episode is brought to you by a Cloud Guru. A Cloud

7
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:59,000
A CloudGuru.com. My name is Chris and joining us is our host, Mr. Dominic, with

8
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
no Florida jokes. Hello, Mike.

9
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Hello, Chris. Hang on, I just got to push down on this beautiful single-serve

10
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
French press here. There we go. Feel that plunge.

11
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Did you get your first bag of coffee of the month?

12
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I did. You can hear me pouring it, I'm sure. Right from Kenya this month.

13
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Oh, how is it?

14
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I like it as an afternoon coffee. It's very earthy, very smooth, not very strong.

15
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
And you know, to start off my day, I really need the French baguette to the face

16
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
coffee.

17
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Yeah, your breakfast coffee.

18
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,000
My only complaint is that this is a coffee you need to French press or pour

19
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:43,000
over. The AeroPress, you know, you have some loves that are like, you know,

20
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Romeo and Juliet till the bitter end when you're choking on blood and

21
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
hemorrhaging internally.

22
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Right.

23
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Then you have some that are more like the movie Grease, where it's really just a

24
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
summer love. And that would be my relationship with the AeroPress.

25
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
That tends to be mine. My wife sticks with it. But here's what I say to you,

26
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
sir. If you're going to all the trouble being a fancy guy with your fancy mail

27
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
order coffee, what are you going to do? Not use the AeroPress when this

28
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,000
perfectly picked coffee arrives at your house? Like, you got to give it the best

29
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
treatment possible.

30
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
So this is one of the few times I wish this was a video show. I would show you

31
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
my single serve bamboo wood French press.

32
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Oh, my God.

33
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
That is what I would do, sir.

34
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Oh, I'll tell you what. I didn't sleep last night. I think maybe 45 minutes.

35
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Oh.

36
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Yeah. So I'm doing – when I have a night of no sleep, I have a pack of

37
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
sugar-free Red Bull that I go for. I don't bother with the coffee. I don't bother

38
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
with the caffeine pill. I go with the sugar-free Red Bull because, you know,

39
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
you just need the kick. I'm just trying to get myself through half the day,

40
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
and then I'm going to allow myself an opportunity for a nap in the afternoon.

41
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:55,000
But I just – I don't know. You know, it's just so much going on, and with the

42
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
election and everything, I just – my mind is going 100 miles per hour on work

43
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,000
stuff and world stuff, and boy, am I just looking forward to things settling

44
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
down a little bit.

45
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Yeah, you're doing some live coverage of that on Unfilter, aren't you, or my –

46
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I will be. Yes. Yes, I'm that crazy.

47
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
If I fall asleep during the show today, I guess I didn't get the Red Bull mix

48
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
right.

49
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I'll just scream, Seuss, and you'll wake right up.

50
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,000
No doubt about that. We'll be getting to that. We'll be getting to that.

51
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
But we do have some Dark Matter Dev follow-up to get to.

52
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
This one is a Dark Matter Dev for decades.

53
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
He says, hello, guys. I'm a longtime listener of Coder Radio.

54
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I recently listened to the discussion you had about Dark Matter developers

55
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
with Mike, and of course, I am one of those. I work for a global bank.

56
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I use Java 8, an Oracle database, and ReactJS. The software we develop is a

57
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
software managing one of the bank's internal systems. It has a couple of

58
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
hundred users spread across the globe.

59
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Of late, there is a large push inside the bank to, quote, adopt the cloud.

60
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
So recently, I've gotten to play with Kubernetes, OpenShift, Docker, et cetera.

61
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
All the developers in my team use cloud desktops for development.

62
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Cloud desktops managed by the internal IT team, they're slow.

63
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
They break often, and they make life miserable for the developer.

64
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I don't mean to laugh. I just didn't expect it to go that direction.

65
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,000
He says, but, you know, the job pays well. I have reasonably good job security,

66
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
and people I work with are some of the nicest out there.

67
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
My boss seems pretty great. We get along just fine, and COVID-19 hasn't

68
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
really affected our employment at all.

69
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I've been a Dark Matter developer for a couple of decades.

70
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I started programming COBOL systems on IBM mainframes and then moved on

71
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
to other technologies as time went on.

72
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
For me personally, the benefits of being a Dark Matter developer has

73
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
outweighed the costs. Granted, enterprise software isn't the most exciting

74
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:45,000
thing to work on. However, it has given me a reasonably good work-life balance

75
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:51,000
and given me the opportunity to travel to places and meet people I never would

76
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,000
have met growing up as a middle-class kid in India.

77
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I listen to your podcast, so keep up with the technology news.

78
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
It's always interesting to listen to you and Mike talk about experiences

79
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
running a software business. Keep up the great work, and thanks to Mike

80
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,000
and you for producing entertaining and informative content.

81
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Best regards, Mr. Anonymous.

82
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Dark Matter developer for decades, and he says he looks back on it, Mike,

83
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
and says it was all worth it.

84
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Yeah, sure, right. Different strokes for different folks.

85
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I think it's a good data point for people listening that are in the

86
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
perpetual, should I go indie, should I work for myself, should I build my

87
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
own product and sell it directly, or should I go work for someone else?

88
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
That's why we started asking about kind of just getting people's input

89
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
and thoughts about being a Dark Matter developer, so we had a better

90
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
kind of database, you know, to pull from.

91
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
And JVP writes in as a Dark Matter developer.

92
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Now, here's the thing. He's been programming for various jobs over the years,

93
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,000
but where he works now, he's been there for eight years, and the software

94
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
only runs on Windows, so he wanted to share a bit of a Windows perspective

95
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
that doesn't get a lot of attention here sometimes, I suppose.

96
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
It is the best Linux, this drill.

97
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
It hurts because it's becoming true.

98
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Well, other than SUSE.

99
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I got to focus. I'm going to get through this email.

100
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Drew, do not edit his sigh of rage out.

101
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
We are going to address that. We are going to address that.

102
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,000
But first, he says our software runs only on Windows, so I want to share that perspective.

103
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Windows 10 has the same bloat problems that other versions had, and it's

104
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,000
compounded by antivirus and anti-malware that gets more and more complex each year.

105
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,000
The antivirus software feels like a rootkit at this point, and since I don't

106
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,000
really have admin control on some processes, you simply can't just sit down

107
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
at a fresh install of Win 10 and compare it to anything else without at least

108
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,000
running it for two to four years, which is maybe the amount of time I spend

109
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
between IT upgrades at best.

110
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,000
This leads me to trying to do most of my work on my personal laptop running

111
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Ubuntu because of these frustrations.

112
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,000
One of my horror stories has seen a message pop up that updates and rebooted

113
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
and was forced right in the middle of a presentation to a customer.

114
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
This actually happened to me, and I couldn't stop it from happening,

115
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
and I ended up having to return to the customer the next day.

116
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,000
When I contacted IT, he just said that there must have been a delayed update

117
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
for more than five days, and then there was nothing he could do about it.

118
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Oh, my God.

119
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
You just feel like you have no governance over your computer when that happens.

120
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
He goes on.

121
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Windows 10 has broke a lot of things in software terms.

122
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
People usually mention that Windows has a largely good legacy compatibility

123
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
and that rebasing would be unheard of because of this compatibility,

124
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
but honestly, all of the software that worked fine in previous systems,

125
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:32,000
like on Windows 2000 and XP, stopped working in Windows 7,

126
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
and then things changed even more with Windows 10.

127
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Nobody in the industry took Windows 8 seriously, he says.

128
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,000
The idea that WSL could lead to a flipped architecture is one I think

129
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
isn't too far out there.

130
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
We've seen Microsoft be adept at changing strategies

131
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
for such a large corporation.

132
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
The move to Azure seems to be their number one priority,

133
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
and my two cents is that the strategy to drop Windows

134
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:59,000
and license revenue in order to be better positioned for Azure deployments

135
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
makes sense.

136
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I think Microsoft would pivot quickly.

137
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Well, as quick as a giant ship can, he says.

138
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
With all of these crews that worked together to turn the rudder,

139
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
they could get there.

140
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
They could easily create a reverse WSL that could run Linux

141
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:18,000
and support a reference architecture base with something like 90% compatibility

142
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,000
and functionality, something similar maybe to Proton on Linux.

143
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Just think of the amount of money that they could throw at this versus Valve.

144
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I don't know if the Windows license model is something that gets shareholders

145
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
excited anymore.

146
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Keep up the good content, thanks, JVP.

147
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I think his point in here about Windows 10 compatibility

148
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
and Windows compatibility getting hyped up,

149
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
every time we've talked about that, in the back of my mind,

150
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I've always been like, is that really everyone's experience?

151
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Because a large part of my IT career was solving compatibility issues

152
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,000
between Windows issues and software that corporations just had to run.

153
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I agree with him here.

154
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I think Windows 10 gets sort of like this Solaris-like credit for compatibility

155
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
that just isn't fully deserved.

156
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
There's some, for sure, but I don't think it's fully deserved.

157
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Can we just exclude Windows 8?

158
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Yeah.

159
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
And then I feel more correct in that it was compatible the whole time?

160
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Yeah, and I'm still not biting on the storyline that Microsoft

161
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,000
is going to make a reverse WSL to make Windows run on Linux.

162
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I don't know if I'm seeing that.

163
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
We'll see.

164
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,000
You know I was hot on it, and I feel bad that I forgot who wrote the post,

165
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
but there was that post we covered a few weeks ago basically saying...

166
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
It was Hayden.

167
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
It was Hayden, right, that people like me were on crack,

168
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
and yeah, I've seen the error of my ways.

169
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Okay, I think this is our last Dark Matter Developer one.

170
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
This is Cold Fusion Hell.

171
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
That's a little redundant, but okay.

172
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I know, right?

173
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
It's a cold fusion day in hell.

174
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Anonymous writes, I wanted to give my two cents as a Dark Matter Developer.

175
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I used to work at an MSP that only did government work.

176
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Most of the devs worked their nine to five hours and were good at their jobs,

177
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
but had zero desire to learn more.

178
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
We had one modern application written C sharp,

179
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,000
but most of our work was supporting ancient web apps using CFML,

180
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,000
which, by the way, is Cold Fusion markup language.

181
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,000
It screws up my life, he says, in more colorful terms.

182
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Having to use CFML along with its terrible sibling, Cold Fusion Server,

183
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
ended up being one of the main reasons I quit,

184
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
as I didn't want to get left behind technologically.

185
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Now, this is something I've wondered if Dark Matter Developers worry about this,

186
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
is if they get stuck and strapped to these old techs

187
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
if they feel like the industry is leaving them behind.

188
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Now, we haven't got a lot of emails that have said that,

189
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
but this one from Anonymous does seem to address that.

190
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
He goes on to say, CFML does have its perks.

191
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
It's super easy to create a decent database connection,

192
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
and the server GUI was simple to use,

193
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,000
but there are many reasons why it's not very popular.

194
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Sort of like Seuss, he says.

195
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Seriously, it's in there.

196
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
All this said, I think there's a direct correlation

197
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
between what a dev has to work on

198
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
and their desire to learn more and be better.

199
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Working day in and day out on boring government applications is soul sucking.

200
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Well, I'm glad you got out of Cold Fusion hell.

201
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
That was our Dark Matter Developer feedback,

202
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
and I felt like that was a pretty good batch.

203
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
We're still receiving your feedback.

204
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
We'll probably be featuring less and less in the show,

205
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
but we actually don't mind still receiving it.

206
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
It helps inform our opinion,

207
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
and if there was something particular that was great,

208
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I'd promote it up to the show.

209
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
linode.com slash coder.

210
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Go there for a $100 60-day credit towards a new account.

211
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Linode is cloud hosting done just right.

212
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
If you're a total beginner,

213
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
they've got a way for you to get things done.

214
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
But if you're an expert, if you're a pro,

215
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
you know what you're doing with the server,

216
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
then Linode is unlike any other service out there.

217
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
They're going to give you full access to the backend

218
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
and control to your server so you can make it fit your needs.

219
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
They've got a DNS manager that'll let you switch

220
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
and change all of the DNS stuff you need.

221
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
The disk manager to set up new disks is great.

222
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,000
All of that is what I consider to be table stakes at Linode.

223
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
But on top of that, they have things like object storage

224
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
and Kubernetes support and Terraform support

225
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
and node balancers and alert integration.

226
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
See, they started in 2003 as one of the first companies

227
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
in cloud computing, so they've had some time

228
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
to figure out what customers really like.

229
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I mean, this was three years before AWS.

230
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
They had people putting their infrastructure

231
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
in production three years before AWS,

232
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
and they're independently owned through all of it.

233
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
They were founded on a love for Linux

234
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
and open source technologies.

235
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
And I started using them a couple of years ago,

236
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
and now all of JB's infrastructure runs on that.

237
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:35,000
We have one physical server now.

238
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,000
When I started doing this with Mike 200 years ago,

239
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
we were still at the phase where the servers

240
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
were in racks in data centers.

241
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
And we actually had a two-week lead-up process

242
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
before we could get an additional server in the rack.

243
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
And then I actually had to pay for its power

244
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
and all of its transfer.

245
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:59,000
And now with Linode, you can get a $100 60-day credit,

246
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
and their base rigs start at $5 a month.

247
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
So if you just need something like an SSH jump host

248
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
or a VPN endpoint, that's great,

249
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
and you could do a lot of other things with that rig too.

250
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,000
But you can go with something that has a lot of CPUs

251
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
or a lot of GPUs.

252
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
What we do is we offload our encoding now.

253
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Our editors submit a FLAC file to a server on Linode,

254
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
and then it does all of the heavy lifting,

255
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
all of the encoding to the various video versions

256
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
and audio versions, all server-side on a Linode.

257
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
So if you need something simple or you need something

258
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
with a lot of performance, they're going to have you covered.

259
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
And they're usually 30% to 50% cheaper

260
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
than any of the other big commercial providers,

261
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
so you'll save money too.

262
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:46,000
And they have a 99.9% SLA, so uptime is pretty great.

263
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
I don't think you're going to have any problems with that.

264
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
So with the prices, it's cheap enough to learn,

265
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
and you can dial it in for production

266
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
and still save a ton of money.

267
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
So go check them out.

268
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
They provide virtual servers that make it easy and affordable

269
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
for you to host anything in the cloud,

270
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
from games to applications to a resume

271
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
to your company's backend infrastructure.

272
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
It's all there.

273
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Linode is dedicated to offering the best

274
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
virtualized cloud computing.

275
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
If it runs on Linux, it runs on Linode.

276
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
So go to linode.com slash coder.

277
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
You support the show.

278
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
You let them know you heard it here.

279
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,000
You get that $100 credit for a new account for 60 days,

280
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
and you get the whole process started.

281
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
You support the show, get something great, linode.com slash coder.

282
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,000
And a big thank you to Linode for sponsoring the Coder Radio program,

283
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
linode.com slash coder.

284
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
We touched on a couple of nerves right out of the gate.

285
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Hans writes in, talking about being in development hell.

286
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
He says, hello, guys.

287
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Love your show.

288
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Please keep it up.

289
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
A couple of times over the recent episodes,

290
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
the topic of Apple's relationship to developers came up.

291
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,000
You postulated that they put users, profit,

292
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:51,000
and pretty much everything else above developers on their platform.

293
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Well, I work on iOS apps for a living for a large corporation,

294
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,000
and I think Apple is doing a good job in a lot of areas.

295
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
They have great devices.

296
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
The annual iPhone update seems to be getting more marginal every year,

297
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
but it's still a pretty good update.

298
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Swift is an awesome programming language.

299
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Nobody likes square brackets and semicolons except Mr. Dominic.

300
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Clearly, this email is written by an insane person.

301
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Yeah, well, we'll get to that, too.

302
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
But that being said, here we go.

303
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,000
That all being said, Mike could not be more right.

304
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
He's healed.

305
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Developers are clearly a second-class citizen on their systems.

306
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:29,000
However, what annoys me even more is they claim Mac OS is, quote,

307
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
the world's best system for developers.

308
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
The best system for developers?

309
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
My ass.

310
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,000
First of all, GNU userland tools eat their BSD counterparts

311
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
that ship with Mac OS for breakfast.

312
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Ever found a Stack Overflow answer about how to do something with set or grep

313
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
and then realized it doesn't work on your Mac?

314
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Then every year at WWDC, they tell us how they've rewritten half of Xcode

315
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,000
and how it's X percent faster.

316
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Yet in 2020, it still crashes when I switch between Git branches,

317
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
can't reliably do incremental builds,

318
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,000
and overall, beach balls left and right, clogging up the whole system.

319
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
The spicy take right there.

320
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,000
And one I've heard echoed, I got to say.

321
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
But they don't stop there.

322
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Not only do they force us to use their crappy IDE,

323
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,000
they also require us to run their CI machines on Mac OS,

324
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,000
an operating system without a headless mode

325
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
and without any reliable machine orchestration framework.

326
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Administering Mac OS build server means regularly logging into a graphical user interface

327
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,000
to confirm dialogues or install updates by hand.

328
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Could any system Windows Apart be less suitable for running a CI machine?

329
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Or take Docker.

330
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:39,000
It runs on Mac OS, but the performance is light years worse than on Linux

331
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
because the absence of the Linux kernel means it has to resort to virtualization.

332
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:47,000
In my opinion, Mac OS is far from being, quote, the best choice for developers.

333
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Linux obviously is.

334
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Honestly, with the direction Microsoft is heading into,

335
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,000
I would even say Windows is starting to be a better choice than Mac OS.

336
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:59,000
I think developers use Macs because you need a Mac to publish apps on Apple's platform

337
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
and they're pretty sexy machines.

338
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
That's all.

339
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Just my two cents, Hans.

340
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Yeah, so one of the mysteries of the universe as far as I'm concerned

341
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
is how so much money and effort goes into Xcode

342
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,000
and it's always half busted.

343
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:18,000
It's got to be that they're constantly having to add stuff to keep up with the phone production, right?

344
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,000
New screen shapes, new features in chips,

345
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,000
and just stuff that they have to constantly be working to support in Xcode, I guess.

346
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Well, I know Xcode got briefly better and then when Swift came out,

347
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:35,000
they had to add all the Swift support, which was just dog terrible in terms of performance.

348
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Like, awful.

349
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Now, that's because Swift is an inferior language.

350
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Nailed that right off the bat.

351
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Right.

352
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:49,000
In terms of the BSD tools, yeah, okay, but a couple years ago,

353
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,000
you had pointed out that when you're on a Mac,

354
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,000
you're generally using proprietary paid graphical tools, right?

355
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,000
And I think that your average developer working in a Mac full time

356
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,000
who doesn't like touch Linux in particular

357
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:05,000
doesn't really think in terms of like I'm going to script my way to glory

358
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:09,000
and pipe everything from crept to whatever, blah, blah, blah.

359
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Now, some do, right?

360
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:16,000
When I work on a Mac, I still constantly get mad that ZShell is different than Bash

361
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
because I keep forgetting.

362
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Sure.

363
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
I don't know, right?

364
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,000
I don't know why this is –

365
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
and Chris, you're going to have to correct me here.

366
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:32,000
I would think that like Apple would want developing iOS apps to be super not frustrating

367
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:38,000
considering it's actually an expensive thing to do and it's just a brutal marketplace.

368
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:42,000
But yeah, they seem – maybe it is just like the rapid cadence of iOS

369
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,000
that they have to keep adding crap to Xcode and it keeps bloating it.

370
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:51,000
I would suggest and it is an absolute crime that they don't sponsor this show,

371
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
JetBrains does have app code.

372
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
It is good.

373
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,000
It does suffer from the third party tool working in the Apple ecosystem curse

374
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:05,000
of every year they get hammered by Apple because they have to catch up.

375
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
But yeah, Xcode is awful.

376
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
I just had a problem this week where I was working on my Mac

377
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:13,000
and it was just inconvenient to like switch machines back to the Lemur

378
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
because it's just annoying.

379
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:19,000
But somehow in the background, the Mac App Store had updated Xcode,

380
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
which whatever, right?

381
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:26,000
But that breaks my command line tools like GCC, which I was coding in Ruby.

382
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,000
So that's kind of important because all the Ruby –

383
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,000
many of the gems have to compile C++ extensions or C extensions.

384
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
And that's just like a dumb problem to have.

385
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
I then had to open Xcode.

386
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Like I just had to know that I had to do the Xcode select thing

387
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:45,000
and make sure like re-simulink or reinstalls whatever it had to do.

388
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,000
In my case, GCC, but there's a bunch of stuff it does.

389
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
That's really stupid.

390
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Yeah, it feels old and busted.

391
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:55,000
It reminds me of the old days on Windows when like you need to install Visual Studio

392
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
if you would like to have C++ at all.

393
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Yeah.

394
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
I mean, I'm obviously a little biased,

395
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,000
but I feel like Mac OS sort of lost its competitive edge

396
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
as a developer's workstation.

397
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,000
I think it really did offer something special early on.

398
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Years ago, there wasn't really a great laptop solution.

399
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,000
I mean, when Macs really kind of started kicking off for developers

400
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:21,000
is when the Transition x86 came and Wi-Fi was rough on Linux.

401
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Power management was rough on Linux.

402
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
The desktop UIs were new.

403
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Plasma was just a new version.

404
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Gnome Shell was just a new version.

405
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:35,000
And Apple came along and by the time x86 shipped on the Apple platform,

406
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
which is ironic because they're about to switch to ARM now,

407
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,000
but by the time the x86 Mac started to ship, Mac OS was in a good place.

408
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Adobe was fully on board.

409
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Microsoft was fully on board.

410
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:51,000
You could get a Mac with actual real legit Microsoft Office

411
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,000
and Adobe Photoshop and Internet Explorer

412
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
and whatever else you needed back then.

413
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Yes, Internet Explorer was one of the things.

414
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
And you could get a real Unix command line.

415
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Proprietary applications, polished UI, Unix command line.

416
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:10,000
That was a great combination and it sold millions of MacBooks,

417
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
no doubt about it.

418
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:17,000
But as time went on, the cloud became more and more dominated by Linux.

419
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Shipping applications as containers became commonplace.

420
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,000
The desktop side of Linux got a lot better.

421
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
It got a lot more professional.

422
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Vendors like Dell, HP, and Lenovo are all now selling Linux laptops.

423
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:37,000
System76 and companies like them have their game brought up to the next level.

424
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:41,000
They've spent this last decade iterating and learning like crazy.

425
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,000
And so you have this common runtime aspect,

426
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,000
this general technology platform that is Linux.

427
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:51,000
And it's so easy to get a Linux workstation for development set up and going

428
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
because you have repositories of software.

429
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,000
You have command line tools to install your software.

430
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
It's things developers love.

431
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,000
And Microsoft is quickly adopting much of this.

432
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Meanwhile, Apple has been heads down on the iPhone.

433
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:09,000
And they just have let the Mac as a core concept kind of age.

434
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
They've updated the UI here and there.

435
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
They've updated the Mac line.

436
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,000
They're making a big investment in a transition to ARM.

437
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:19,000
But fundamentally, it's not going to change the fact that Mac OS just isn't

438
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
an ideal development platform anymore.

439
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:25,000
And you can spend time getting Mac OS tweaked and installing dozens of

440
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:29,000
third-party tools that will cost you a minimum of $5, go as high as $35,

441
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
and you'll need to get 10 of those installed.

442
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
You can kind of get there.

443
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Or you can just like descend into homebrew hell, right?

444
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Yeah, yes, absolutely right.

445
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,000
I think they've lost their competitive edge to a large degree.

446
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,000
And the transition to ARM will probably help, but not a full solution.

447
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Oh, I think it's going to help a lot.

448
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
So I'm bringing you some Applewood bacon today.

449
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Oh, really?

450
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
I set you right up for this.

451
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
You know, I was okay.

452
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
I mean, I was going to go lizard, but we'll go bacon.

453
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Let's do it.

454
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
We do not eat or harm lizards in any way.

455
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
People do.

456
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
People do.

457
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Fried lizard could be a thing.

458
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:03,000
It has burned into my brain with a smoky sort of sweet maple aroma that

459
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
they showed GNOME.

460
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Yes, it's GNOME, not gnome.

461
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Please don't get me all that.

462
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,000
And I'll put the link on their Apple Silicon demo.

463
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
I don't think the folks at Apple are stupid.

464
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
I think many of them are very smart developers, right?

465
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,000
And they know that they're by their own admission,

466
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
their biggest pro market is devs.

467
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:25,000
I think just like is always the case, Apple is a little slow to the game.

468
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:29,000
But I think they're going to do something Linuxy or maybe they'll embrace

469
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
the dark side of BSD even further.

470
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Right?

471
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,000
I really don't think they're just going to see this market because they're

472
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
not stupid, right?

473
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
They're not going to.

474
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,640
They're not going to let Dell sell a bunch of XPS 13s

475
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:46,400
or System 76, but whatever, the Lemur, the Darter.

476
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,680
I don't see them giving this up this easily.

477
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:53,320
Now, I do see some sort of insane virtualization thing

478
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:57,200
because of the, I think, pretty impressive performance

479
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:00,320
they're going to get on Apple Silicon.

480
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:04,200
But I think people are ringing the death

481
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:05,560
bell a little early here.

482
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:07,760
Well, you're convincing me in two regards.

483
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:10,680
Number one, I vividly remember them demoing

484
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:12,840
GNOME Shell up on stage.

485
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:13,920
And they made a point.

486
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:15,880
Yeah, and they were particularly talking

487
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:19,360
about accelerated Linux virtualization.

488
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:20,440
Yeah, that, you're right.

489
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:23,560
And that does seem to indicate a bit of a tell,

490
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:24,880
I guess you could say.

491
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:28,640
The other thing is it is a classic Apple maneuver

492
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:31,280
to wait just a little too long to the point

493
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:34,120
where everybody's like, what the hell's going on here?

494
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:35,680
They've lost it.

495
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:36,920
They've dropped the ball here.

496
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:38,240
What's going on, Apple?

497
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:41,240
When you start having people in the technology crowd

498
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:44,240
that are talking like that, you wait another six months,

499
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:47,440
and that's usually when Apple will come up with something.

500
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:49,320
You've just seen them do this over and over again

501
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:50,200
over the decades.

502
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:53,060
They are often a little late, but they generally

503
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:54,440
execute really well.

504
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:57,080
And so I could see that also proving your point.

505
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:57,880
We'll have to see.

506
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:59,240
We may find out more.

507
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:02,280
But speaking of lizards, Hans did have a postscript.

508
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:06,320
He says, I've been laughing my ass off about the Seuss jokes,

509
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:07,200
but don't bash them.

510
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,280
It's not so bad.

511
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:10,640
I mean, yes, I'm from Germany.

512
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:13,680
That goes without saying, Hans.

513
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:16,580
And yes, I have a little bit of a corporate background

514
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:18,480
where I have to use it, he says.

515
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,520
But I think it's a rather well-made system.

516
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:21,680
And you said it himself.

517
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:22,400
He's a crazy guy.

518
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,320
So he's a Seuss guy.

519
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:26,760
So just a little data point for us.

520
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:28,720
And he's German, too, which also seems

521
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:31,000
to be quite common among the Seuss users.

522
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,880
Well, you know, when an IT person declares himself

523
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:39,200
in Germany, they actually hand you a Seuss laptop.

524
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,320
I don't know what's going on with you at this point,

525
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:44,720
because I'm getting tweets from you that I think

526
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,240
are just designed to troll me.

527
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:50,760
You even pinned a Seuss a tweet on your Twitter timeline.

528
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:52,520
I was wondering if you'd see that.

529
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:53,720
Oh, I noticed.

530
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:54,760
Oh, I noticed.

531
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:58,200
So I get this tweet the other night.

532
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:00,700
Hey, Chris, I'm moving another server to hashtag Seuss,

533
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:03,240
and it feels so good.

534
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:06,200
And of course, everybody on Twitter notices.

535
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:09,720
And I feel like perhaps the audience and I

536
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:12,120
need to stage some kind of intervention with you.

537
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:14,720
This only ends in you quitting Linux, I feel.

538
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:15,880
This is what happens.

539
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:18,720
You go this route, it ends in you quitting Linux.

540
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:21,120
All right, you know what?

541
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:24,080
I've been Perry Mason defending my reptilian client

542
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:25,600
for several weeks now.

543
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,400
What's the case for the prosecution?

544
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:30,240
What is wrong with open Seuss server?

545
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:32,800
I'm using Seuss as an umbrella.

546
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:34,840
Well, I'd say a couple of things.

547
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:36,320
It is an oddball distribution.

548
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:38,880
Some things are just done a little bit differently.

549
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:41,640
No other distribution has Yast, so it's sort of a sunk cost.

550
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:43,840
Anything you learn in Yast is not going to really apply

551
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,120
to any other distribution.

552
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:47,800
I'd say additionally, it feels old in a lot of ways.

553
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:50,600
It has some Slackware heritage, the layout, the design.

554
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:52,160
In some ways, it just feel old.

555
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:53,520
Additionally, one of the things that I've

556
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,480
noticed at a global level of the project,

557
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:58,720
and they're going to hate that I say this, but I mean, it's true.

558
00:26:58,720 --> 00:26:59,880
They already hate you, don't worry.

559
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:02,200
They have a little bit of not invented here syndrome.

560
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:05,400
And it does result in great results and great products,

561
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:07,440
but it also results in them investing

562
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:11,040
a ton of time and effort into stuff that nobody ever touches.

563
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:12,440
I'll give you a couple of examples.

564
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:15,280
Open build service, absolutely brilliant.

565
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:19,120
It could be a public service for the free software community,

566
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:21,580
and it really hasn't seen much growth at all.

567
00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:23,000
It's got adoption by some.

568
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,320
Nobody really, it never really gets traction, though.

569
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:27,760
If Canonical or Red Hat did the same thing,

570
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:30,600
it would be the number one thing in, like I mean, look.

571
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:33,280
When Flatpak and Snaps came out, it's all we talk about now.

572
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:35,000
Meanwhile, open SUSE build service

573
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,400
has been around for 200 years.

574
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:40,320
There's also things like, they try to do things

575
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:43,120
before anybody else, but nobody follows their lead,

576
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,760
because they're kind of insignificant.

577
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:46,500
So they don't really end up being a trendsetter,

578
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:47,960
so much as just different.

579
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:50,400
And their implementation of ButterFS

580
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,400
is a fantastic example of this.

581
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:54,680
Way ahead of the pack, first they were on RiserFS,

582
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:56,380
but nobody switched to that.

583
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:58,520
And then Hans turned out to be a murderer,

584
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:01,280
and not really working on the project

585
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:02,400
after he got sent to jail.

586
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:07,240
So they quietly transitioned off of RiserFS to ButterFS,

587
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:08,680
and they've been there for years.

588
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:11,080
And meanwhile, nobody used it.

589
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:13,320
And ZFS got more and more popular.

590
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:15,860
ZFS got notoriety on Ubuntu,

591
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:19,800
and Canonical built it into their LTS version of Linux.

592
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:22,880
And now, finally, after all these years,

593
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:26,440
because not by any doing of SUSE,

594
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:28,320
Fedora is now shipping ButterFS.

595
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:30,080
And Fedora can say, look, the SUSE guys did it,

596
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:30,920
and it was fine.

597
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:33,280
And that's about the extent of their contribution

598
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:36,280
and impact on shaping the landscape of desktop Linux.

599
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:38,000
And it's, I don't say this with joy,

600
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,600
I don't get any pleasure from this,

601
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,600
but just having observed SUSE,

602
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:44,160
they kind of just seem to be off into a world of their own.

603
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,440
They sometimes get it right,

604
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:47,640
and sometimes get it really kind of better

605
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:48,920
than anybody else.

606
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:51,280
But it doesn't really change anything.

607
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:53,400
It doesn't really change the way the rest of Linux works.

608
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:55,520
So it's not like you have some advantage

609
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:57,800
by being on SUSE and you learn how the new thing works

610
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:59,320
before anybody else is doing it.

611
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:01,040
You just learn how it works the SUSE way.

612
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:04,240
And that is even true of their ButterFS implementation.

613
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:06,580
They have their very own unique ButterFS implementation.

614
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:08,920
So I guess when I look at it,

615
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:10,960
I look at it as a bit of an oddball distro

616
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:13,040
that doesn't have a lot of community support,

617
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:15,560
that doesn't have a particularly strong brand

618
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:19,300
compared to its competitors, which are just dominant.

619
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:23,520
And I don't see a lot of density in cloud deployments either,

620
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:26,360
which I think is a bellwether for the future of the distro.

621
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:28,860
You don't see entire stacks of containers

622
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:30,640
built off of SUSE.

623
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,360
You don't see tens of thousands

624
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:35,200
or millions of deployments on AWS.

625
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:38,120
You have to go to a provider that really knows Linux

626
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:39,960
to get SUSE really, like Linode.

627
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:41,000
Linode has SUSE,

628
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,640
but that's because they're a bunch of Linux geeks.

629
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:46,480
And I think that has gotten a little better over time,

630
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:49,720
but it still pales in comparison to CentOS

631
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:54,660
or Debian or Ubuntu's deployment on VPSs and cloud services.

632
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:56,180
So that's part of it.

633
00:29:56,180 --> 00:29:58,880
Yeah, I mean, I don't really see a market share

634
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,920
as something I necessarily care about.

635
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:04,560
Also, to be super clear, I'm talking about server side, right?

636
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:05,400
Right, right, right.

637
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:07,040
So, you know.

638
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:08,880
I mean, I think it's a decent product.

639
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:11,160
Yeah, I think you're a little dismissive

640
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:12,540
of the build service though.

641
00:30:12,540 --> 00:30:13,640
I gotta be honest with you.

642
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:17,560
Yeah, well, just because like it hasn't gone anywhere.

643
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:20,800
Like it got some adoption and, you know,

644
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:22,600
like even some, like you might say,

645
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:24,100
competing projects use it.

646
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:26,360
And that is a cool statement

647
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:28,680
from like a community standpoint.

648
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:30,400
But beyond that,

649
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:33,360
like nobody's deploying software at scale with it

650
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:34,200
in a commercial space.

651
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,600
What do you mean it hasn't gone anywhere?

652
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,360
Of all like the competing products,

653
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:39,380
I mean, this is a risky opinion

654
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:41,800
because we're talking packaging now,

655
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:44,000
but I think it solves it in the best way.

656
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,240
No, I actually agree with you.

657
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:46,800
I think it does.

658
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:49,500
And I think it's the one that's most approachable

659
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:50,340
by the community.

660
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:53,440
Anybody, you don't have to be a SUSE user

661
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:56,000
to use the open SUSE build service.

662
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,700
You also forgot Rancher, right?

663
00:30:57,700 --> 00:31:00,300
Now will they take it and make it SUSEfied?

664
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:01,140
I don't know.

665
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:02,400
I guess the bet is,

666
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:04,100
the bet is that they're gonna build up

667
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:06,660
a bigger and bigger presence on on-premises

668
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:07,840
and on some server cases,

669
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:09,460
and that there's an ecosystem there

670
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:10,760
that you could become an expert on

671
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:11,760
and kind of differentiate.

672
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:13,240
I guess that might be the bet.

673
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:16,360
The bet is there are basically two viable options

674
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:18,040
and the canonical people are gonna get really mad.

675
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:20,520
But right now there are really two viable options

676
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:22,480
for regulated spaces in the US

677
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:23,900
in terms of Linux distros.

678
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:24,840
Yeah, yeah.

679
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:27,360
It's RHEL, who is owned by IBM,

680
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:30,280
who is a consulting company, right?

681
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:32,680
That's automatically problematic for me.

682
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:33,780
And it's expensive.

683
00:31:33,780 --> 00:31:34,620
And it's expensive.

684
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:37,160
And there's SUSE who has a much smaller presence here.

685
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:38,000
And let's not forget,

686
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,920
I am laying fiber optic cable and building a data center.

687
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:41,920
True.

688
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:44,020
So the way I would probably build that myself

689
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:49,020
is an Ubuntu or CentOS virtualizer host.

690
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:52,920
And then I would run SUSE and VMs for the applications

691
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:53,760
that need it.

692
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:56,580
Well, I will say buying hardware with SUSE on it,

693
00:31:56,580 --> 00:32:00,260
or SUSE on it, is surprisingly challenging.

694
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:02,740
Kuzuntai is what they say when you ask for SUSE.

695
00:32:02,740 --> 00:32:04,420
Yeah, they're like, did you mean Windows Server?

696
00:32:04,420 --> 00:32:05,660
Ha ha ha.

697
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:06,940
Oh man, come on.

698
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:09,220
So that is fair, right?

699
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:10,180
Like that is one of,

700
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:12,340
I would say the largest downside of SUSE,

701
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:14,900
like it's weird to me that there are not more vendors

702
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:16,500
offering SUSE services,

703
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:18,940
which say that three times fast.

704
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:21,460
Because it is like one of the accepted,

705
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:23,180
like one of the two main accepted

706
00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:26,500
for regulated spaces, distros.

707
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:27,340
Right?

708
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:28,260
It just is.

709
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:30,420
And the other one is RHEL, so.

710
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:31,740
Yeah, that is definitely true.

711
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:33,120
But I could also see maybe Ubuntu

712
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:34,660
eventually working into that space.

713
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:36,460
Well, Ubuntu is trying to get there, right?

714
00:32:36,460 --> 00:32:38,980
It's just, you know, it takes time.

715
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:41,580
It's like you say SUSE is old and that's a problem.

716
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:43,660
It's a problem if you're looking at it

717
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:45,820
from an enthusiast perspective.

718
00:32:45,820 --> 00:32:46,880
If you're looking at it from,

719
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:49,340
I never want to see a problem that hasn't already

720
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:52,760
been solved or in terms of infrastructure level, right?

721
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:55,560
Keeping these machines up, then that's a feature.

722
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:58,860
I think maybe old isn't the right way to put it

723
00:32:58,860 --> 00:33:01,900
because of, you know, it's fresh packages, it's maintained.

724
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:04,380
It is an old methodology.

725
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:08,060
It's an old design principle of an operating system.

726
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:11,580
It's the early days of Linux way of thinking.

727
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:14,980
It's when we built Linux the way we built Slackware.

728
00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:17,220
Wow, you've really got to go all the way to Slackware, huh?

729
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:18,920
I think, I believe that's what SUSE is based on.

730
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:20,060
I think it is too, actually.

731
00:33:20,060 --> 00:33:20,900
Yeah.

732
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:23,100
And I think that it shows a little bit

733
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:26,220
compared to a Debian system or a RHEL system.

734
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:28,300
Right, so there's a bit of dissonance, right?

735
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:30,140
If you're coming from an Ubuntu background

736
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:33,420
and then you're in SUSE, it's like at some point

737
00:33:33,420 --> 00:33:35,700
you have to unlearn what you have learned, right?

738
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:37,700
Like, I don't know, was that Yoda?

739
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:39,740
Probably.

740
00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:41,220
But you really have to just let go.

741
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:44,320
You have to embrace the ask, you have to embrace Zipper

742
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:47,180
and you have to think in a more reptilian way.

743
00:33:47,180 --> 00:33:50,180
But I got to tell you, it's very stable.

744
00:33:50,180 --> 00:33:52,460
It's running fine.

745
00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:53,700
We're using the build service.

746
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:55,820
I mean, we're early days of setting this all up.

747
00:33:55,820 --> 00:33:59,140
But I don't know that I could ever not

748
00:33:59,140 --> 00:34:00,300
be using the build service.

749
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:03,460
Even if in a year I'm like, ah, damn it, Chris, you are right.

750
00:34:03,460 --> 00:34:07,260
We're running everything on Fedora or CentOS now, right?

751
00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:09,220
I still would be trying to use the build service.

752
00:34:09,220 --> 00:34:10,140
I could see that.

753
00:34:10,140 --> 00:34:12,300
And I'm a little confused as to why

754
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:15,140
this is not a more common opinion in the community.

755
00:34:15,140 --> 00:34:16,220
Me too, man.

756
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:18,180
I have really wondered that, because it

757
00:34:18,180 --> 00:34:22,020
seems like a fantastic public service they're providing.

758
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:25,660
Yeah, it's like I had a client this past week,

759
00:34:25,660 --> 00:34:28,940
so last week, right, call me and he

760
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:31,260
had a question from one of his internal IT guys

761
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:32,720
about packaging on Linux.

762
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:34,660
Because you know why?

763
00:34:34,660 --> 00:34:36,340
It's just a pain in the butt.

764
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:37,900
Yeah, and there's too many options.

765
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:40,460
Too many options, and they all have weird trade-offs.

766
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:44,940
And they ended up just doing PPAs, private PPAs.

767
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:46,460
And for those listening who don't know,

768
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:50,100
the build service will create distribution packages

769
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:51,300
for all the major distros.

770
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:53,100
You give it your software, and it'll

771
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:55,980
handle the five different RPMs you'll

772
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:58,340
need for all the different Fedoras and the dev packages

773
00:34:58,340 --> 00:35:00,220
and all of that.

774
00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:04,300
Even if I did end up having Ubuntu servers in front

775
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:06,700
of the SUSE infrastructure, for instance,

776
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:09,140
I don't know why I wouldn't keep using the build

777
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:13,780
service on SUSE building for these other distros.

778
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:15,780
And maybe I'm a little backwards on this, but to me,

779
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:18,460
that is a bit of an indictment of SUSE

780
00:35:18,460 --> 00:35:20,500
and their overall influence, that they have created

781
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:23,780
something so special that does absolutely have users

782
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:28,340
and does see growth, but it doesn't have the mindshare

783
00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:31,060
and usage that it really should.

784
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:35,560
And if this was a Fedora-backed or a Red Hat-backed initiative

785
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:39,160
or a Linux Foundation initiative, I have a sense

786
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:41,820
it would have 10 times the recognition.

787
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:43,940
As a comparison, I bet you people

788
00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:46,340
have heard of the Linux vendor service, the LVFS,

789
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:49,460
10 times more than they've heard of the open SUSE build service.

790
00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:50,260
But not in Munich.

791
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:56,180
And now Plant City, Florida, the two strongholds.

792
00:35:56,180 --> 00:35:59,380
You know, we got an email from a guy out of Florida,

793
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:02,900
and I think he's along your line of thinking here.

794
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:06,060
He says it's good for business and corporate development.

795
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:13,100
And honestly, I ran bank core servers on SUSE Enterprise

796
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:15,460
Server for a long time.

797
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:18,900
And it was just the eventual, like,

798
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:22,020
straw that broke the camel's back was it was an issue.

799
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:25,160
It was just a stupid issue in a DNS resolver library,

800
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:27,440
actually, that after a ton of time,

801
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:29,180
we were able to self-patch even.

802
00:36:29,180 --> 00:36:30,620
But it just was the straw.

803
00:36:30,620 --> 00:36:33,100
After we had resolved that particular issue,

804
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:34,980
I was just done deploying Sless.

805
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:39,060
But I did run it probably two and a half, three years

806
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:43,180
on more and more systems, especially for just one tech

807
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:45,060
managing all of those boxes.

808
00:36:45,060 --> 00:36:47,100
There were some things I really liked about it.

809
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:49,020
So I don't think you're totally crazy.

810
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:53,660
But if you had hired me as a consultant

811
00:36:53,660 --> 00:36:56,340
to help you build out a data center infrastructure,

812
00:36:56,340 --> 00:36:58,660
I'd still be trying to advise you not to use SUSE.

813
00:36:58,660 --> 00:36:59,380
It's interesting.

814
00:36:59,380 --> 00:37:01,780
See, I could be wrong, right?

815
00:37:01,780 --> 00:37:03,460
You might be able to convince me, though.

816
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:06,060
I mean, you're starting to kind of make me see it your way.

817
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:08,220
I'm starting to kind of see your perspective on it

818
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:10,900
and think, OK, I can see it working in this use case.

819
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:12,860
Because I do honestly might think

820
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:15,220
it does have its legitimate use cases.

821
00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:17,740
I just don't think there's as many as all the other distros.

822
00:37:17,740 --> 00:37:20,260
Well, see, so the failback position for me

823
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:23,500
is even if the core, like the internal infrastructure,

824
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:27,620
remains SUSE, I can use OBS to just build packages

825
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:29,100
for, like, Ubuntu.

826
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:30,300
And I'm fine.

827
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:30,900
Yeah.

828
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:35,020
And the reality is, between virtualization and containers,

829
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:37,580
it really doesn't matter what your host OS is.

830
00:37:37,580 --> 00:37:38,660
It just doesn't anymore.

831
00:37:38,660 --> 00:37:39,820
I mean, you can make it matter.

832
00:37:39,820 --> 00:37:41,180
Docker all the things, right?

833
00:37:41,180 --> 00:37:42,820
Yeah.

834
00:37:42,820 --> 00:37:43,460
Exactly.

835
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:44,540
That's just it.

836
00:37:44,540 --> 00:37:47,540
And really, as long as you're happy

837
00:37:47,540 --> 00:37:49,180
and you can manage the base OS, then

838
00:37:49,180 --> 00:37:50,580
it's really about the applications running

839
00:37:50,580 --> 00:37:51,220
on top of that.

840
00:37:51,220 --> 00:37:53,140
And you know how you can orchestrate those containers?

841
00:37:53,140 --> 00:37:53,820
Oh, how's that?

842
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:55,420
Using Rancher, which is owned by SUSE.

843
00:37:55,420 --> 00:37:57,340
Yes!

844
00:37:57,340 --> 00:37:58,700
There you go.

845
00:37:58,700 --> 00:37:59,260
Very good.

846
00:37:59,260 --> 00:38:00,300

00:38:27,460 --> 00:38:29,740
In 2010, Datadog's founder set out

857
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:31,900
to create a product that would reduce friction between

858
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:34,980
developers and system administration teams, which

859
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:37,020
they'd experienced in prior work.

860
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:39,060
You see Datadog's machine learning-based alerts,

861
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:41,660
customizable dashboards, and over 400

862
00:38:41,660 --> 00:38:43,660
vendor-backed integrations make it

863
00:38:43,660 --> 00:38:46,300
easy to unify disparate data sources

864
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:49,300
and pivot between correlated metrics and events

865
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:51,060
for faster troubleshooting.

866
00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:54,060
By combining metrics, traces, and logs in one place,

867
00:38:54,060 --> 00:38:57,060
in one dashboard, you can easily improve your application's

868
00:38:57,060 --> 00:38:59,740
performance and keep an eye on what's going on.

869
00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:01,620
Datadog also gives you observability

870
00:39:01,620 --> 00:39:05,860
into containers, speaking about containers just a moment ago.

871
00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:08,420
Get detailed insights into Docker performance

872
00:39:08,420 --> 00:39:10,340
about what those containers are doing.

873
00:39:10,340 --> 00:39:13,900

879
00:39:29,420 --> 00:39:34,660
So Mr. Dominic, you received your iPhone 12.

880
00:39:34,660 --> 00:39:35,820
What do you think?

881
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:38,100
I think if I don't get a case within the next hour and a half,

882
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:40,380
I'm going to have a lot of problems.

883
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:41,660
So you just got this thing.

884
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:42,380
I just got it.

885
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:46,180
Yeah, this, I don't know if I should call it matte,

886
00:39:46,180 --> 00:39:49,060
because I.

887
00:39:49,060 --> 00:39:50,260
Come on now, give it your best.

888
00:39:50,260 --> 00:39:51,580
Come on, you can do it.

889
00:39:51,580 --> 00:39:55,820
This back, this back texture, it's

890
00:39:55,820 --> 00:39:57,940
almost like it's designed to get me to spend

891
00:39:57,940 --> 00:40:00,500
more money on Apple products.

892
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:01,660
There's some more bacon.

893
00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:03,700
I cannot keep a grip on this damn thing.

894
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:04,780
Which one did you get?

895
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:06,660
I got the blue 12.

896
00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:07,540
OK.

897
00:40:07,540 --> 00:40:08,460
Oh, OK.

898
00:40:08,460 --> 00:40:10,460
All right, the Pacific blue one, huh?

899
00:40:10,460 --> 00:40:11,780
Pacific.

900
00:40:11,780 --> 00:40:14,420
Is the blue as nice as it looks in the pictures?

901
00:40:14,420 --> 00:40:15,980
I actually like it a lot, yeah.

902
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:19,500
And any noticeable improvements with the first few minutes

903
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:20,260
you've had it?

904
00:40:20,260 --> 00:40:22,180
Yeah, I mean, I've had it about a couple hours.

905
00:40:22,180 --> 00:40:23,460
It feels nice holding it.

906
00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:25,380
The pictures are definitely significantly better.

907
00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:25,900
Oh, really?

908
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:28,500
But my phone is the two models back.

909
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:29,660
So this is a nice upgrade.

910
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:31,180
So this is a nice upgrade for me.

911
00:40:31,180 --> 00:40:33,460
It feels bigger, but I held them side by side.

912
00:40:33,460 --> 00:40:35,740
I think it's because there's less bezel.

913
00:40:35,740 --> 00:40:37,140
This is actually the first time I

914
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:39,740
did the transfer from one iPhone to another thing.

915
00:40:39,740 --> 00:40:41,820
Usually I set it up manually.

916
00:40:41,820 --> 00:40:43,260
And that has worked surprisingly well,

917
00:40:43,260 --> 00:40:45,660
except I can't figure out how to get Authenticator

918
00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:47,900
to transfer my stuff over.

919
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:50,380
The logging in the two factor takes forever now.

920
00:40:50,380 --> 00:40:54,140
Yeah, I can't seem to get that working.

921
00:40:54,140 --> 00:40:56,260
But that's probably because I'm dumb.

922
00:40:56,260 --> 00:40:58,060
You're going to have to probably go rescan

923
00:40:58,060 --> 00:41:00,100
QR codes and whatnot and just set them back up again.

924
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:01,860
Yeah, I found a thing on, like, because I

925
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:02,820
use Google Authenticator.

926
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:05,380
Oh, spoilers.

927
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:09,860
It seems to want me to scan multiple, like, every barcode.

928
00:41:09,860 --> 00:41:10,820
Yeah.

929
00:41:10,820 --> 00:41:12,900
That's going to be a process.

930
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:13,580
It's a good time.

931
00:41:13,580 --> 00:41:14,860
Yeah, it's a lot of fun.

932
00:41:14,860 --> 00:41:15,900
Yeah, and don't mess it up.

933
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:17,180
And don't forget.

934
00:41:17,180 --> 00:41:19,980
I have decided to hold off.

935
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:21,460
I think I'm going to get the mini.

936
00:41:21,460 --> 00:41:22,140
Interesting.

937
00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:23,300
When I do get it.

938
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:24,660
I am on the upgrade program.

939
00:41:24,660 --> 00:41:28,500
And technically, switching to the mini makes it cheaper.

940
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:29,940
So I think I'm going to go that route.

941
00:41:29,940 --> 00:41:32,100
I'm a little worried about a downgrading camera.

942
00:41:32,100 --> 00:41:34,340
Well, I can tell you with the Pro, I'm a little worried.

943
00:41:34,340 --> 00:41:37,620
Like, I carry my iPhone in my pocket,

944
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:39,220
like my front pant pocket.

945
00:41:39,220 --> 00:41:39,780
Yeah.

946
00:41:39,780 --> 00:41:42,060
And I'm not sure that I would want to do that anymore.

947
00:41:42,060 --> 00:41:44,940
Do you do screen in or screen out?

948
00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:46,380
So it's in your pocket.

949
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:47,980
Which way is the screen facing?

950
00:41:47,980 --> 00:41:50,220
Usually against my leg, if I remember.

951
00:41:50,220 --> 00:41:51,060
Yeah.

952
00:41:51,060 --> 00:41:52,580
So that way, if you bump into something,

953
00:41:52,580 --> 00:41:53,700
you hit the back of the phone.

954
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:54,660
You hit the back of it.

955
00:41:54,660 --> 00:41:57,100
But I'm thinking I'm going to have to do something.

956
00:41:57,100 --> 00:41:58,760
So I'm just holding them side by side.

957
00:41:58,760 --> 00:41:59,900
It's definitely taller.

958
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:01,500
I'm looking forward to a smaller phone,

959
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:04,540
because I know it's just going to fit anywhere

960
00:42:04,540 --> 00:42:05,620
my current phone fits.

961
00:42:05,620 --> 00:42:07,980
That phone's going to fit just even better.

962
00:42:07,980 --> 00:42:11,500
And I have been waiting for a small, fast phone.

963
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:13,080
I don't want a compromised phone.

964
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:15,120
And there is a bit of a compromise with the cameras.

965
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:17,820
But other than that, this seems like a pretty solid little

966
00:42:17,820 --> 00:42:18,940
phone.

967
00:42:18,940 --> 00:42:22,100
And more than anything, that's what I'm excited about.

968
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:24,220
I also wonder if this might be the last iPhone

969
00:42:24,220 --> 00:42:25,060
I get for a while.

970
00:42:25,060 --> 00:42:25,560
Oh, jeez.

971
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:27,820
Because I could definitely see the ports going away

972
00:42:27,820 --> 00:42:28,860
after this one.

973
00:42:28,860 --> 00:42:29,540
Really?

974
00:42:29,540 --> 00:42:30,100
Yeah.

975
00:42:30,100 --> 00:42:32,140
I mean, if they're going to do it, right?

976
00:42:32,140 --> 00:42:34,380
They introduced the MagSafe charger,

977
00:42:34,380 --> 00:42:37,020
the wireless charging at a faster rate, 15 watts,

978
00:42:37,020 --> 00:42:37,940
whoopty whoop.

979
00:42:37,940 --> 00:42:39,180
Yeah, that's not that fast.

980
00:42:39,180 --> 00:42:41,460
They've had wireless carplay for a while,

981
00:42:41,460 --> 00:42:44,180
although I don't really know how much adoption it's gotten.

982
00:42:44,180 --> 00:42:47,900
The AirPods, the HomePods, they're all wireless.

983
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:49,780
And they've switched the lightning cable

984
00:42:49,780 --> 00:42:51,380
to USB-C on the other end.

985
00:42:51,380 --> 00:42:53,740
So I think it's way more likely they just

986
00:42:53,740 --> 00:42:56,100
go portless than it is they ever go to USB-C.

987
00:42:56,100 --> 00:42:58,260
I freaking hope I'm wrong.

988
00:42:58,260 --> 00:43:00,260
But we'll see.

989
00:43:00,260 --> 00:43:01,020
We'll see.

990
00:43:01,020 --> 00:43:02,220
I don't think we'll find out for a little bit.

991
00:43:02,220 --> 00:43:04,300
So maybe I'll just hang out with a tiny little phone

992
00:43:04,300 --> 00:43:07,060
for as long as it lasts, and then I'd be fine with that.

993
00:43:07,060 --> 00:43:11,940
As we record, Apple has announced their ARM Mac event

994
00:43:11,940 --> 00:43:15,660
takes place next week, the day after we record.

995
00:43:15,660 --> 00:43:21,220
It's the second time they've done that to us.

996
00:43:21,220 --> 00:43:23,300
You really pissed them off years ago, you know?

997
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:24,020
Oh, yeah.

998
00:43:24,020 --> 00:43:26,460
Yeah, they're just sitting there in a rage, right?

999
00:43:26,460 --> 00:43:27,340
Yeah.

1000
00:43:27,340 --> 00:43:28,260
Tim Cook.

1001
00:43:28,260 --> 00:43:29,020
Yeah.

1002
00:43:29,020 --> 00:43:31,060
Obviously, it's Tim Cook.

1003
00:43:31,060 --> 00:43:34,540
Yeah, so you're going to get your Silicon Macs?

1004
00:43:34,540 --> 00:43:35,800
Are you excited?

1005
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:37,180
I might be too excited.

1006
00:43:37,180 --> 00:43:37,660
Really?

1007
00:43:37,660 --> 00:43:38,380
Really?

1008
00:43:38,380 --> 00:43:41,980
I'm really expecting this to be kind of a devastating blow

1009
00:43:41,980 --> 00:43:43,380
to the industry.

1010
00:43:43,380 --> 00:43:45,060
Ooh, you think the performance is going

1011
00:43:45,060 --> 00:43:47,260
to be that off the charts?

1012
00:43:47,260 --> 00:43:49,660
I think the battery life is going to be that off the charts.

1013
00:43:49,660 --> 00:43:53,820
Oh, you think they're going to be anything that's like, what,

1014
00:43:53,820 --> 00:43:54,420
18 hours?

1015
00:43:54,420 --> 00:43:55,860
I mean, what's off the charts?

1016
00:43:55,860 --> 00:43:58,140
I'm thinking we could hit the big 2.0.

1017
00:43:58,140 --> 00:43:59,220
20 hours?

1018
00:43:59,220 --> 00:44:01,900
I know it's crazy, but why go through all this hassle?

1019
00:44:01,900 --> 00:44:05,660
Yeah, I mean, I keep thinking back to the iPad

1020
00:44:05,660 --> 00:44:09,220
and how freaking fast the iPad Pro is.

1021
00:44:09,220 --> 00:44:10,860
And it's got no fan.

1022
00:44:10,860 --> 00:44:14,340
It's impossibly thin.

1023
00:44:14,340 --> 00:44:17,780
If you just gave that thing more cooling and more cores

1024
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:20,000
and more battery, you could probably

1025
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,520
get an iPad Pro to 24 hours of battery life

1026
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:25,380
if you could just make it thick enough, like a laptop.

1027
00:44:25,380 --> 00:44:27,580
Right, see, my question is, are we going down

1028
00:44:27,580 --> 00:44:30,740
from a MacBook Air?

1029
00:44:30,740 --> 00:44:33,260
I think it's really coming down from a 13-inch MacBook Pro.

1030
00:44:33,260 --> 00:44:35,300
Or are we coming up from an iPad Pro?

1031
00:44:35,300 --> 00:44:37,460
That's where I'm getting a little confused.

1032
00:44:37,460 --> 00:44:40,180
I think also you're kind of counting on Apple

1033
00:44:40,180 --> 00:44:44,860
to do something that has not been in their, well,

1034
00:44:44,860 --> 00:44:46,580
hasn't always been in their nature.

1035
00:44:46,580 --> 00:44:49,580
And that is they've always gone thinner and lighter

1036
00:44:49,580 --> 00:44:51,420
when they can, with some recent exceptions,

1037
00:44:51,420 --> 00:44:54,100
like the MacBook Pro 16 and the new iPads.

1038
00:44:54,100 --> 00:44:57,020
But they've generally always got those suckers

1039
00:44:57,020 --> 00:44:59,340
as thin and light as possible.

1040
00:44:59,340 --> 00:45:02,740
So I feel like if it's possible, although I

1041
00:45:02,740 --> 00:45:05,240
could see them wanting to blow the doors off battery life,

1042
00:45:05,240 --> 00:45:07,700
I could also see them saying all-day battery

1043
00:45:07,700 --> 00:45:09,060
life is good enough.

1044
00:45:09,060 --> 00:45:11,340
We're just going to say it has all-day battery life.

1045
00:45:11,340 --> 00:45:14,660
And what that really will translate to is 8 to 12 hours.

1046
00:45:14,660 --> 00:45:19,220
And they'll just reduce space and weight instead

1047
00:45:19,220 --> 00:45:21,500
of going any further than that.

1048
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:23,900
Again, it's GNOME, man.

1049
00:45:23,900 --> 00:45:24,420
It's GNOME.

1050
00:45:24,420 --> 00:45:27,340
I think they're going to want to have a developer story here

1051
00:45:27,340 --> 00:45:30,900
that this blows the pants off of their previous generation

1052
00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:31,580
products.

1053
00:45:31,580 --> 00:45:33,940
Yeah, the speculation is two laptops, a MacBook Air

1054
00:45:33,940 --> 00:45:36,100
and the MacBook 13.

1055
00:45:36,100 --> 00:45:38,260
I could see that the 13 one could be targeted right

1056
00:45:38,260 --> 00:45:40,180
at developers.

1057
00:45:40,180 --> 00:45:41,220
Or they could wait.

1058
00:45:41,220 --> 00:45:43,180
They could wait till they get to the bigger laptops.

1059
00:45:43,180 --> 00:45:46,660
And that's where they really put in the 20-hour battery life.

1060
00:45:46,660 --> 00:45:48,000
I don't know.

1061
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,660
I guess we don't really need to speculate.

1062
00:45:49,660 --> 00:45:51,180
We'll find out soon enough.

1063
00:45:51,180 --> 00:45:53,700
What would it take for you to drop money on a new laptop,

1064
00:45:53,700 --> 00:45:54,180
though?

1065
00:45:54,180 --> 00:45:54,980
What would it take?

1066
00:45:54,980 --> 00:45:57,580
Truly nothing.

1067
00:45:57,580 --> 00:45:59,300
Just do a good job?

1068
00:45:59,300 --> 00:46:02,340
I mean, come on.

1069
00:46:02,340 --> 00:46:04,100
What, you're going to just do it?

1070
00:46:04,100 --> 00:46:06,380
I mean, I would be tempted if I were you, too.

1071
00:46:06,380 --> 00:46:07,660
I absolutely would.

1072
00:46:07,660 --> 00:46:09,140
I got to admit, I would be tempted.

1073
00:46:09,140 --> 00:46:12,740
I have no business need for it, so I can't justify it.

1074
00:46:12,740 --> 00:46:16,780
I mean, I guess there's some, what I would consider,

1075
00:46:16,780 --> 00:46:19,780
minuscule chance that they could really mess this up.

1076
00:46:19,780 --> 00:46:22,260
But that just doesn't seem likely, does it?

1077
00:46:22,260 --> 00:46:25,420
What if the Intel performance, like the x86 emulation,

1078
00:46:25,420 --> 00:46:27,860
is just dog crap slow?

1079
00:46:27,860 --> 00:46:30,420
And you've got to figure, like, 70% of the stuff you're using

1080
00:46:30,420 --> 00:46:32,220
at first is x86 emulated.

1081
00:46:32,220 --> 00:46:34,380
But that is the area where they know they have

1082
00:46:34,380 --> 00:46:36,100
to protect themselves, right?

1083
00:46:36,100 --> 00:46:37,100
Yeah.

1084
00:46:37,100 --> 00:46:39,380
Doesn't mean they can change the laws of physics.

1085
00:46:39,380 --> 00:46:41,540
Yeah, I mean, we'll see.

1086
00:46:41,540 --> 00:46:42,500
We'll see, right?

1087
00:46:42,500 --> 00:46:45,660
They could have, I mean, since they're building the silicon,

1088
00:46:45,660 --> 00:46:48,020
they can have cores dedicated to virtualization.

1089
00:46:48,020 --> 00:46:51,060
I mean, they could really go crazy with it if they wanted to.

1090
00:46:51,060 --> 00:46:53,580
That is, sorry.

1091
00:46:53,580 --> 00:46:54,260
Fine.

1092
00:46:54,260 --> 00:46:56,260
We'll have another helping of Applewood bacon.

1093
00:46:56,260 --> 00:46:58,340
I really didn't want to do this because I can feel.

1094
00:46:58,340 --> 00:46:59,660
Wow, you're lucky, man.

1095
00:46:59,660 --> 00:47:01,620
I don't always bring two helpings of bacon with me.

1096
00:47:01,620 --> 00:47:02,140
Oh, please.

1097
00:47:02,140 --> 00:47:04,700
I know LadyJuice has just like an entire smoker.

1098
00:47:04,700 --> 00:47:05,820
Got a whole fridge full.

1099
00:47:05,820 --> 00:47:08,060
I think that they wouldn't be doing this

1100
00:47:08,060 --> 00:47:13,020
without this being kind of an iMac circa 1990, whatever, move.

1101
00:47:13,020 --> 00:47:14,140
Whoa.

1102
00:47:14,140 --> 00:47:14,660
Whoa.

1103
00:47:14,660 --> 00:47:15,220
Really do.

1104
00:47:15,220 --> 00:47:17,260
I think Dell's going to be crapping their pants.

1105
00:47:17,260 --> 00:47:19,580
I think it's going to make all the Surface devices look

1106
00:47:19,580 --> 00:47:20,260
like jokes.

1107
00:47:20,260 --> 00:47:24,500
I just, it's going to make my iMac Pro feel really sad.

1108
00:47:24,500 --> 00:47:25,140
Yeah.

1109
00:47:25,140 --> 00:47:25,460
I don't know.

1110
00:47:25,460 --> 00:47:27,380
It feels like, remember in World of Warcraft,

1111
00:47:27,380 --> 00:47:29,100
if you ever played that for listeners,

1112
00:47:29,100 --> 00:47:30,300
you have your Purples, right?

1113
00:47:30,300 --> 00:47:33,100
Your epic gear from like Burning Legion.

1114
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:35,100
Then you get a blue or a green and Lich King.

1115
00:47:35,100 --> 00:47:38,660
And it's like, oh, that's all garbage now.

1116
00:47:38,660 --> 00:47:41,620
So what would stop me from buying it?

1117
00:47:41,620 --> 00:47:43,540
There is actually one thing.

1118
00:47:43,540 --> 00:47:45,500
Son of a bitch of a butterfly keyboard.

1119
00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:46,540
Oh, well, there's no way.

1120
00:47:46,540 --> 00:47:48,260
There's no way.

1121
00:47:48,260 --> 00:47:50,100
That would be like suicide, right?

1122
00:47:50,100 --> 00:47:50,580
Yeah.

1123
00:47:50,580 --> 00:47:51,180
I don't know.

1124
00:47:51,180 --> 00:47:52,420
I think it's a lock.

1125
00:47:52,420 --> 00:47:53,900
You're going to have to use Big Sur.

1126
00:47:53,900 --> 00:47:56,180
You'll have no option but use Big Sur on those things.

1127
00:47:56,180 --> 00:47:56,860
Oh.

1128
00:47:56,860 --> 00:47:57,860
You know what though?

1129
00:47:57,860 --> 00:47:59,980
It's going to be like when they did all the candy cane crap.

1130
00:47:59,980 --> 00:48:04,900
They're just going to go back, right?

1131
00:48:04,900 --> 00:48:06,340
And they're going to undo it.

1132
00:48:06,340 --> 00:48:07,900
Have you moved to Catalina?

1133
00:48:07,900 --> 00:48:08,500
Oh, god.

1134
00:48:08,500 --> 00:48:10,460
Catalina is just lousy.

1135
00:48:10,460 --> 00:48:12,660
Well, everything in Catalina is in Big Sur.

1136
00:48:12,660 --> 00:48:13,860
No, I'm on Catalina.

1137
00:48:13,860 --> 00:48:14,380
OK.

1138
00:48:14,380 --> 00:48:16,620
Well, if you can survive it there, you'll be all right.

1139
00:48:16,620 --> 00:48:19,060
So Adium doesn't work in Catalina.

1140
00:48:19,060 --> 00:48:19,660
No.

1141
00:48:19,660 --> 00:48:22,940
No, because the 90s called, and they want their messenger back.

1142
00:48:22,940 --> 00:48:24,100
Adium.

1143
00:48:24,100 --> 00:48:25,620
What's wrong with Adium?

1144
00:48:25,620 --> 00:48:26,180
Nothing.

1145
00:48:26,180 --> 00:48:29,540
It's just like seriously old.

1146
00:48:29,540 --> 00:48:30,940
It's really old.

1147
00:48:30,940 --> 00:48:31,460
Oh, my god.

1148
00:48:31,460 --> 00:48:33,460
It's an IRC messenger.

1149
00:48:33,460 --> 00:48:34,860
What does it do?

1150
00:48:34,860 --> 00:48:37,260
Listen, I have a custom Adium theme

1151
00:48:37,260 --> 00:48:39,220
that I've been using for like 12 years.

1152
00:48:39,220 --> 00:48:39,860
Oh, I get it.

1153
00:48:39,860 --> 00:48:40,660
I get it.

1154
00:48:40,660 --> 00:48:45,980
It's just, do you remember when people were on AIM and ICQ?

1155
00:48:45,980 --> 00:48:46,900
You know I do.

1156
00:48:46,900 --> 00:48:48,860
That's how old Adium is.

1157
00:48:48,860 --> 00:48:49,860
Do you remember TextMate?

1158
00:48:49,860 --> 00:48:51,340
Because that's what I was.

1159
00:48:51,340 --> 00:48:52,820
Yeah, hell yeah.

1160
00:48:52,820 --> 00:48:53,500
OK.

1161
00:48:53,500 --> 00:48:54,940
So you know what the problem is?

1162
00:48:54,940 --> 00:48:57,980
When I'm on Mac, I want to go back in time, right?

1163
00:48:57,980 --> 00:48:58,780
Right, right.

1164
00:48:58,780 --> 00:48:59,380
Yeah.

1165
00:48:59,380 --> 00:49:00,620
And that's not very easy.

1166
00:49:00,620 --> 00:49:02,820
Not very easy.

1167
00:49:02,820 --> 00:49:05,460
And this is a whole other break with that compatibility

1168
00:49:05,460 --> 00:49:05,940
right there.

1169
00:49:05,940 --> 00:49:11,100
And part of what gives me the biggest pause is as a developer,

1170
00:49:11,100 --> 00:49:14,340
you could make the case that a great MacBook Pro could

1171
00:49:14,340 --> 00:49:15,660
be the perfect trifecta.

1172
00:49:15,660 --> 00:49:19,340
In an ideal situation, you could run Mac OS, Linux,

1173
00:49:19,340 --> 00:49:21,500
and Windows on one machine.

1174
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:23,740
Talk about changing your game and getting

1175
00:49:23,740 --> 00:49:26,100
a lot of efficiency out of one piece of hardware.

1176
00:49:26,100 --> 00:49:28,700
And then the T1 and T2 chips came along,

1177
00:49:28,700 --> 00:49:31,260
and that dream sort of faded, and it became a dual OS.

1178
00:49:31,260 --> 00:49:33,580
Possible machine, still very valuable.

1179
00:49:33,580 --> 00:49:36,780
And now it's a single OS with virtualization,

1180
00:49:36,780 --> 00:49:39,660
and it'll never, ever be anything else.

1181
00:49:39,660 --> 00:49:41,860
And I mean, it's not that that's a big problem,

1182
00:49:41,860 --> 00:49:43,300
because if you're buying a Mac, you're not buying it

1183
00:49:43,300 --> 00:49:44,620
for anything else, really.

1184
00:49:44,620 --> 00:49:47,340
But for me, when I'm looking at my tools,

1185
00:49:47,340 --> 00:49:50,260
I like my laptop to be able to do multiple things.

1186
00:49:50,260 --> 00:49:51,780
And that's just a consideration now.

1187
00:49:51,780 --> 00:49:54,260
No boot camp's going to really be a drag.

1188
00:49:54,260 --> 00:49:57,980
It's fine, but I think it will be a factor for something.

1189
00:49:57,980 --> 00:50:00,340
This is the question, right?

1190
00:50:00,340 --> 00:50:05,260
Apple has, I'm trying to put this in a non-flamey way.

1191
00:50:05,260 --> 00:50:07,500
There's no non-flamey way, I'm just going to go for it.

1192
00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:10,980
Apple has effectively helped create the surge in Linux

1193
00:50:10,980 --> 00:50:13,020
desktop use among developers, right?

1194
00:50:13,020 --> 00:50:14,500
Oh!

1195
00:50:14,500 --> 00:50:17,580
So, I never would have considered it

1196
00:50:17,580 --> 00:50:19,380
if they didn't just decide to screw up

1197
00:50:19,380 --> 00:50:21,860
for several years, right?

1198
00:50:21,860 --> 00:50:23,940
So for them not to just come, and again,

1199
00:50:23,940 --> 00:50:26,580
by their own admission, over and over again,

1200
00:50:26,580 --> 00:50:28,580
their biggest pro market, one of their most important

1201
00:50:28,580 --> 00:50:32,380
market for the Mac, we're talking about our developers.

1202
00:50:32,380 --> 00:50:35,020
Yeah, although I think the developers they're talking about

1203
00:50:35,020 --> 00:50:37,420
are the developers that write for their ecosystem.

1204
00:50:37,420 --> 00:50:38,740
No, they talk about, they were talking about

1205
00:50:38,740 --> 00:50:40,980
web developers too, they had a whole thing.

1206
00:50:40,980 --> 00:50:41,820
Okay, all right.

1207
00:50:41,820 --> 00:50:44,700
Right, ATP was triumphal on it, right?

1208
00:50:44,700 --> 00:50:45,540
Okay.

1209
00:50:45,540 --> 00:50:48,780
I can't see a world where you get this laptop,

1210
00:50:48,780 --> 00:50:50,960
and then you like install Python,

1211
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:52,580
and it's not like amazing, right?

1212
00:50:52,580 --> 00:50:54,300
No, I can see a world where Homebrew

1213
00:50:54,300 --> 00:50:56,020
doesn't work for a month.

1214
00:50:56,020 --> 00:50:57,100
Yes.

1215
00:50:57,100 --> 00:50:58,180
Although, they're probably not, right?

1216
00:50:58,180 --> 00:51:00,420
They're probably helping the Homebrew team out.

1217
00:51:00,420 --> 00:51:02,180
They may already have those Mac Minis.

1218
00:51:02,180 --> 00:51:04,300
I'm sure they do, right?

1219
00:51:04,300 --> 00:51:05,980
You know, it wasn't that hard to get those

1220
00:51:05,980 --> 00:51:06,820
if you wanted one.

1221
00:51:06,820 --> 00:51:07,660
Right.

1222
00:51:07,660 --> 00:51:09,820
I don't, I guess I'm trying, like,

1223
00:51:09,820 --> 00:51:11,420
unless they think this is gonna be like

1224
00:51:11,420 --> 00:51:13,660
the college kid dorm laptop,

1225
00:51:13,660 --> 00:51:16,060
but it's almost certainly gonna be way too expensive.

1226
00:51:16,060 --> 00:51:17,100
Yeah, that'll be something.

1227
00:51:17,100 --> 00:51:19,140
With no Intel tax, I wonder what their reason

1228
00:51:19,140 --> 00:51:21,260
for keeping the price high will be.

1229
00:51:21,260 --> 00:51:23,220
Juicy, thick margins.

1230
00:51:23,220 --> 00:51:24,860
What other reason could there be?

1231
00:51:24,860 --> 00:51:27,460
Our R&Ds, all the R&Ds they put into it.

1232
00:51:27,460 --> 00:51:28,980
That damn license we're gonna have to pay

1233
00:51:28,980 --> 00:51:30,420
Nvidia now for R&D.

1234
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:31,660
Ah, I wonder, yeah.

1235
00:51:31,660 --> 00:51:33,180
No, I think Apple owns it perpetually.

1236
00:51:33,180 --> 00:51:34,020
They got a perpetual license.

1237
00:51:34,020 --> 00:51:34,860
Oh.

1238
00:51:34,860 --> 00:51:35,880
I'm like, huh.

1239
00:51:35,880 --> 00:51:37,840
Okay, Mr. Dominic.

1240
00:51:37,840 --> 00:51:39,660
I think we have to try to squeeze in

1241
00:51:39,660 --> 00:51:42,540
just a quick chat about the Raspberry Pi 400.

1242
00:51:42,540 --> 00:51:43,540
Before we do that, though,

1243
00:51:43,540 --> 00:51:44,700
because that's just news that broke today

1244
00:51:44,700 --> 00:51:45,660
as we're recording,

1245
00:51:45,660 --> 00:51:47,540
I also wanna get a mention in

1246
00:51:47,540 --> 00:51:49,740
that you are hiring at the Mad Botter.

1247
00:51:49,740 --> 00:51:51,220
Do you wanna give people deets on that?

1248
00:51:51,220 --> 00:51:54,580
Yeah, so we're hiring for a Python developer

1249
00:51:54,580 --> 00:51:56,780
experience in Flask preferred.

1250
00:51:56,780 --> 00:51:58,620
When we say Python, we always mean Python 3

1251
00:51:58,620 --> 00:52:02,060
because we are not, in fact, old ones from Lovecraft.

1252
00:52:02,060 --> 00:52:04,420
And bonus points if you like SUSE.

1253
00:52:04,420 --> 00:52:05,980
Wow, I can't believe that's in there now.

1254
00:52:05,980 --> 00:52:08,380
What has happened?

1255
00:52:08,380 --> 00:52:11,100
Oh, and you get a System76 workstation or a MacBook,

1256
00:52:11,100 --> 00:52:13,500
but almost always a System76.

1257
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:14,340
It's your choice.

1258
00:52:14,340 --> 00:52:15,160
How about that?

1259
00:52:15,160 --> 00:52:16,000
He lets you choose.

1260
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,000
You pick the tool.

1261
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,940
So we'll have links and details in the show notes

1262
00:52:19,940 --> 00:52:23,220
at coder.show slash 386.

1263
00:52:23,220 --> 00:52:24,380
Well, we do have a lot more to get to,

1264
00:52:24,380 --> 00:52:25,940
but we're running a little long,

1265
00:52:25,940 --> 00:52:27,600
but I kinda wanted to capture your thoughts.

1266
00:52:27,600 --> 00:52:30,580
So I'm gonna talk about it tomorrow in Linux Unplugged.

1267
00:52:30,580 --> 00:52:31,760
But as the timing comes out,

1268
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:34,120
this morning we woke up to the news

1269
00:52:34,120 --> 00:52:37,780
that there is now a Raspberry Pi desktop PC,

1270
00:52:37,780 --> 00:52:42,460
and it is a full Raspberry Pi built into,

1271
00:52:42,460 --> 00:52:46,260
a Raspberry Pi 4 that's actually 800 megahertz faster,

1272
00:52:46,260 --> 00:52:49,140
built into a keyboard with like the USB ports

1273
00:52:49,140 --> 00:52:50,920
and HDMI in the back of the keyboard.

1274
00:52:50,920 --> 00:52:51,760
It's amazing.

1275
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:55,020
And it's $70, 70 bucks.

1276
00:52:55,020 --> 00:52:55,860
Yeah.

1277
00:52:55,860 --> 00:52:58,580
Four gigs of RAM, 1.8 gigahertz quad core CPU.

1278
00:52:58,580 --> 00:53:00,540
And you get the whole ecosystem of the Raspberry Pi,

1279
00:53:00,540 --> 00:53:02,180
all the images, the community.

1280
00:53:02,180 --> 00:53:03,020
It's huge.

1281
00:53:03,020 --> 00:53:03,840
I think it's great.

1282
00:53:03,840 --> 00:53:05,020
It reminds me of the Commodore 64.

1283
00:53:05,020 --> 00:53:06,940
Yes, you know, cause you could,

1284
00:53:06,940 --> 00:53:09,860
with this HDMI port, you could hook it up to your TV

1285
00:53:09,860 --> 00:53:11,140
and you could, you know,

1286
00:53:11,140 --> 00:53:14,060
I mean, that was my first computer in my room.

1287
00:53:14,060 --> 00:53:16,840
And I had it hooked up to a television,

1288
00:53:16,840 --> 00:53:20,780
like through the antenna connector on the back of the TV.

1289
00:53:20,780 --> 00:53:22,460
And I just put cartridges in that.

1290
00:53:22,460 --> 00:53:25,100
That was my experience with a computer at first.

1291
00:53:25,100 --> 00:53:26,060
And that could be all over again.

1292
00:53:26,060 --> 00:53:29,440
I mean, I also could see this as a cheap way

1293
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:31,140
for people to learn Linux.

1294
00:53:31,140 --> 00:53:33,420
I could see that too, you know, cause 70 bucks.

1295
00:53:33,420 --> 00:53:34,660
And then you put Ubuntu on here

1296
00:53:34,660 --> 00:53:37,100
and you're playing with Linux now,

1297
00:53:37,100 --> 00:53:38,860
or, you know, come with Raspberry OS.

1298
00:53:38,860 --> 00:53:40,940
A good computer for a kid that you're trying to teach,

1299
00:53:40,940 --> 00:53:43,300
right, young kid, $70, yeah.

1300
00:53:43,300 --> 00:53:45,540
I'm just saying, I think this is pretty great.

1301
00:53:45,540 --> 00:53:49,060
So I don't know, I guess that's really all I had to say.

1302
00:53:49,060 --> 00:53:49,980
I'm very impressed.

1303
00:53:49,980 --> 00:53:51,420
I'm still kind of digesting the news

1304
00:53:51,420 --> 00:53:53,900
cause we record this kind of in the morning here

1305
00:53:53,900 --> 00:53:56,540
in the Pacific Northwest and this just came out.

1306
00:53:56,540 --> 00:53:57,860
But I also had that same,

1307
00:53:57,860 --> 00:54:00,540
that thought that reminded me of the 80 micro computers

1308
00:54:00,540 --> 00:54:01,980
that were plugged into TVs.

1309
00:54:01,980 --> 00:54:02,820
Yeah, I think this is great.

1310
00:54:02,820 --> 00:54:04,380
I mean, I'm always impressed every release

1311
00:54:04,380 --> 00:54:05,520
with the Raspberry Pi folks.

1312
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:07,940
I actually, my four year old has a Raspberry Pi.

1313
00:54:07,940 --> 00:54:10,260
Now he's lobbying for the iMac Pro

1314
00:54:10,260 --> 00:54:14,460
because he overheard too many episodes of a certain podcast.

1315
00:54:15,460 --> 00:54:17,620
And yeah, but this is like the kind of,

1316
00:54:17,620 --> 00:54:18,660
when he's a little older,

1317
00:54:18,660 --> 00:54:20,500
whatever the successor to this model is,

1318
00:54:20,500 --> 00:54:22,020
is exactly perfect, right?

1319
00:54:22,020 --> 00:54:23,660
Cause right now I have the Raspberry Pi

1320
00:54:23,660 --> 00:54:25,380
in like a 3D printed case and.

1321
00:54:25,380 --> 00:54:26,220
Yeah, nice.

1322
00:54:26,220 --> 00:54:27,940
It's fastened to the wall.

1323
00:54:27,940 --> 00:54:30,180
Right, and they called it the Pi 400 desktop.

1324
00:54:30,180 --> 00:54:32,460
So I guess when the Pi 5 is out,

1325
00:54:32,460 --> 00:54:36,180
we could probably expect a Pi 500 desktop too.

1326
00:54:36,180 --> 00:54:37,980
So they'll probably keep iterating on this.

1327
00:54:37,980 --> 00:54:39,380
They now have this,

1328
00:54:39,380 --> 00:54:41,260
they have the Raspberry compute module,

1329
00:54:41,260 --> 00:54:42,520
which looks really cool,

1330
00:54:42,520 --> 00:54:44,940
which has just been updated for the Raspberry Pi 4.

1331
00:54:44,940 --> 00:54:48,260
And then they have the Raspberry Pi 4 eight gigabyte,

1332
00:54:48,260 --> 00:54:51,020
which I have one of those and that's pretty great.

1333
00:54:51,020 --> 00:54:53,300
Nice, now that's a lot of power for a Pi.

1334
00:54:53,300 --> 00:54:55,100
I really, I feel like it is.

1335
00:54:55,100 --> 00:54:57,740
I run it as a Plex server.

1336
00:54:57,740 --> 00:55:00,420
I have my markdown notes on there.

1337
00:55:00,420 --> 00:55:03,500
I have a home assistant running on that same instance

1338
00:55:03,500 --> 00:55:08,180
that it has hundreds of entries and entities in it,

1339
00:55:08,180 --> 00:55:09,740
doing lots of automations.

1340
00:55:09,740 --> 00:55:13,220
I mean, I run all of that right now off of a single Pi

1341
00:55:13,220 --> 00:55:15,900
and really have no complaints.

1342
00:55:15,900 --> 00:55:16,940
They're getting really impressive.

1343
00:55:16,940 --> 00:55:19,020
It just sort of blows my mind where we're at.

1344
00:55:19,020 --> 00:55:20,180
And it, I don't know,

1345
00:55:20,180 --> 00:55:22,280
something special about seeing it in a computer

1346
00:55:22,280 --> 00:55:23,420
that for a hundred dollars,

1347
00:55:23,420 --> 00:55:24,980
you can get the kit for a hundred dollars

1348
00:55:24,980 --> 00:55:26,780
and it includes just everything you need.

1349
00:55:26,780 --> 00:55:28,260
And then you just hook it right up to a TV

1350
00:55:28,260 --> 00:55:30,740
or a monitor that you have in the house already.

1351
00:55:30,740 --> 00:55:32,500
And you're off to the races.

1352
00:55:32,500 --> 00:55:34,020
You never know what you could see next from them.

1353
00:55:34,020 --> 00:55:35,380
I think they're working on these kinds of things.

1354
00:55:35,380 --> 00:55:36,600
I think it's pretty exciting.

1355
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:37,900
Yeah, I think you're gonna see these in schools.

1356
00:55:37,900 --> 00:55:39,400
I'm pretty excited.

1357
00:55:39,400 --> 00:55:40,620
Oh, wouldn't that be interesting?

1358
00:55:40,620 --> 00:55:42,380
Wouldn't that be interesting?

1359
00:55:42,380 --> 00:55:45,100
Coder.show slash contact if you have thoughts on that.

1360
00:55:45,100 --> 00:55:47,940
Also a big thank you to our Coder QA team.

1361
00:55:47,940 --> 00:55:49,600
Go get the Coderly report.

1362
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:50,720
You support the show.

1363
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:52,940
And when you become a Coder QA member,

1364
00:55:52,940 --> 00:55:54,800
you get the limited ad feed,

1365
00:55:54,800 --> 00:55:56,820
which is available for you once you sign up.

1366
00:55:56,820 --> 00:55:58,620
That's at coderqa.co.

1367
00:55:58,620 --> 00:56:01,300
That's coderqa.co to support the show

1368
00:56:01,300 --> 00:56:05,180
and get that limited ad feed and the Coderly report.

1369
00:56:05,180 --> 00:56:09,020
Also, I wanna mention you can find a cloud guru on social.

1370
00:56:09,020 --> 00:56:10,660
YouTube, Facebook, Twitter,

1371
00:56:10,660 --> 00:56:13,060
it's all just slash a cloud guru.

1372
00:56:13,060 --> 00:56:14,580
They've managed to really nab that everywhere.

1373
00:56:14,580 --> 00:56:17,540
So it's really simple to find a cloud guru on social

1374
00:56:17,540 --> 00:56:19,540
if you wanna pick them up and follow them

1375
00:56:19,540 --> 00:56:21,900
because there's often good content on there as well.

1376
00:56:21,900 --> 00:56:23,020
You can find Mike on Twitter.

1377
00:56:23,020 --> 00:56:23,840
We'll have links to that.

1378
00:56:23,840 --> 00:56:24,820
The show's on Twitter as well.

1379
00:56:24,820 --> 00:56:28,460
And of course, so is the network at Jupiter Signal.

1380
00:56:28,460 --> 00:56:30,100
We do this show live on Mondays,

1381
00:56:30,100 --> 00:56:32,380
noon Pacific, 3 p.m. Eastern.

1382
00:56:32,380 --> 00:56:34,020
A lot of times there's stuff breaking.

1383
00:56:34,020 --> 00:56:34,860
There's news breaking.

1384
00:56:34,860 --> 00:56:36,060
I'm chatting with the chat room

1385
00:56:36,060 --> 00:56:38,260
before the show starts, about a half hour.

1386
00:56:38,260 --> 00:56:39,860
So usually about 11, 30 Pacific.

1387
00:56:39,860 --> 00:56:40,940
I'm getting on there and chatting with them

1388
00:56:40,940 --> 00:56:42,980
about the news that's break for the week.

1389
00:56:42,980 --> 00:56:44,020
And it's a good time.

1390
00:56:44,020 --> 00:56:45,940
Come join us, hang out live, name the show,

1391
00:56:45,940 --> 00:56:47,500
