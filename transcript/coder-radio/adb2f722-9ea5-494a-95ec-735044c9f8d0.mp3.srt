Who me?

8
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:37,800
Yeah.

9
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:38,800
Thanks for asking.

10
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:39,800
Yeah.

11
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:40,800
I'm Chris.

12
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:41,800
Thanks.

13
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:42,800
But what really matters is our host, Mr. Dominic.

14
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:43,800
Hello, Mike.

15
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:44,800
Hello, Mr. Fisher.

16
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:45,800
How are you?

17
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:46,800
Oh, I'm pretty good.

18
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:51,200
Sitting here in my minimum viable robe, enjoying a nice comfortable, you know, because I keep

19
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,720
it a little cool in the studio in the winter.

20
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:54,920
I like to keep the window cracked during the day.

21
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:55,920
That's okay.

22
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:56,920
Ask me what I'm wearing.

23
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:57,920
What are you wearing?

24
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:58,920
My ACP shirt.

25
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:05,560
I'm not sure if that's supposed to cut or I don't know.

26
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:07,520
It's supposed to get feedback on YouTube.

27
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:09,480
That's what it's supposed to do.

28
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:10,480
There is that.

29
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:11,480
Yeah.

30
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:12,480
I got stories for you today.

31
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:13,480
Oh, go.

32
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:14,480
Let's do it.

33
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:15,480
Let's just get right in.

34
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:16,680
Well, first I wanted to, you know, you remember a Veed?

35
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,480
He's written in before to the show.

36
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:19,480
Remember him?

37
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:20,480
Remember him?

38
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:21,480
It's been a while.

39
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:22,480
Spend some time.

40
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:23,480
My old friend.

41
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:24,480
Stay a while and listen.

42
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,480
That's right.

43
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:28,760
That is exactly what I was in the reference I was invoking.

44
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:29,760
Well done, sir.

45
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:30,760
Well done.

46
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:31,760
Yeah.

47
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:32,760
Stay a while and listen.

48
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:33,760
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

49
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,880
We have Deckard Cain on the soundboard and I didn't know this.

50
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:36,880
Yeah.

51
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:37,880
Well, yeah.

52
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:38,880
Yeah.

53
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,160
It's cause it's usually on the Linux unplugged, but every now and then I let it bleed in.

54
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:41,760
Cause I mean, it's, it's Deckard Cain.

55
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:43,520
Stay a while and listen.

56
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:44,520
I love it.

57
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:46,240
I don't remember what we're talking about.

58
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,240
Go ahead.

59
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:52,560
He's been a listener since 2009 and he says, I just wanted to show or throw a shameless

60
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,560
plug towards you guys.

61
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:57,760
In the last episode, you mentioned iTerm and you mentioned AWS.

62
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:00,200
It does sound like us, Mike.

63
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,200
Those are things we would mention.

64
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,120
It does sound about right, doesn't it?

65
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,120
Yeah.

66
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,720
He said, I just wanted to throw you this.

67
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:13,520
It's a GPL project that scrapes AWS and digital ocean to create dynamic profiles for iTerm

68
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,360
for easy SSHing.

69
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:20,360
It also creates an SSH config entry with the same information if that's the way you prefer.

70
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:25,520
He says he'd love to get some information from people on like our, our, our patches

71
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,840
to support Linode or Azure or other cloud providers.

72
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:32,320
And there's also a windows support for MOBA Xterm.

73
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,320
How about that?

74
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:38,320
So he, he essentially, I guess, uses the API to figure out what your sit, what your like

75
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:41,800
digital ocean droplets are or what your AWS instances are.

76
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:44,760
And then auto builds out iTerm connections for you.

77
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,680
So you should be trying iTerm.

78
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,080
That's what this, that's what this is about.

79
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:51,080
You realize this is because you besmirched iTerm.

80
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:53,360
I have some thoughts on iTerm, but let's just keep moving.

81
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,000
I was going to give it another week.

82
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Oh wow.

83
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Okay.

84
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,400
I mean, cause I mean again, you besmirch, you besmirch a great terminal.

85
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,400
You're besmirching.

86
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,400
I didn't say I besmirch.

87
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,680
I just said I had thoughts.

88
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:07,400
I know, but they're probably besmirchy thoughts.

89
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:10,680
I would say they're besmirch adjacent.

90
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:11,680
Yeah.

91
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,800
Besmirchish you might say.

92
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:17,280
I would say they're like the, you know what?

93
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,280
Let's just keep moving.

94
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,280
Okay.

95
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,280
All right.

96
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,280
I mean, I just think it's a nice little terminal.

97
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,880
I got to configure the way I like, but I understand.

98
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:27,160
I think you and I wouldn't configure our terminal the same way.

99
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:28,160
Just saying.

100
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,160
All right.

101
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:30,160
You know what?

102
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:32,440
Next week we can have the terminal off.

103
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:37,680
Then Mike writes in Mike K, listener Mike, big fan of the show he says, and by the way,

104
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,520
can't wait for the ropes to drop.

105
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,520
Absolutely.

106
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,520
God dammit.

107
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:46,040
He says, I have this question haunting me for a while and I had to ask it here.

108
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:49,360
What is so terrible about an electron app?

109
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,360
I agree.

110
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:53,760
It sounds like a hot mess of an idea and yet it works.

111
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,520
It works really well.

112
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:59,600
VS code is the most popular code editor in the world and I build on it.

113
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,360
In fact, I built on top of it.

114
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:04,100
So Slack also use that all the time.

115
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:06,920
Turns out my favorite get client also electron.

116
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:10,920
I have plenty of issues with flat packs and the like over the years, but never really

117
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:11,920
an electron app.

118
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,080
They don't seem to be much heavier than the alternatives.

119
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:18,680
Meanwhile, you basically get web, Linux, windows, Mac builds right out of the box.

120
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:21,560
It might even work on Mike's M1 without crashing.

121
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,560
Seems like a huge upside.

122
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:27,520
And yet electron apps seem to be slandered in the Linux world.

123
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:31,160
I'm a web developer and I want to start writing Linux apps and contributing.

124
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:36,060
So I naturally want to reach for electron, but I hesitate because all of the hate speech

125
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:38,680
around it, despite its popularity.

126
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,780
So what am I missing?

127
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:42,480
Why doesn't this add up?

128
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:44,280
I'd love your take on this item.

129
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:45,280
Thanks.

130
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,280
Sure.

131
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:48,440
So right off the bat, Mike, I'm curious what get client are using.

132
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:52,200
I have a, I mean, I use the terminal, the one true terminal, Chris.

133
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:54,640
He mentions in here that he uses get cracking, which I've tried.

134
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:55,640
Oh, that's what I was going to say.

135
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:56,640
Is it cracking?

136
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:57,640
Yeah.

137
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:58,640
Okay.

138
00:04:58,640 --> 00:04:59,640
That makes a ton of sense.

139
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:04,520
So I'm going to say that electron apps aren't that bad unless you're on Mac.

140
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:05,520
Oh, okay.

141
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:08,400
Even then they're not that bad.

142
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:14,240
Mac is kind of weirdly broken on macOS in terms of the calling and like releasing the

143
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:21,240
odd, the audio input device and audio output devices.

144
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:26,240
But I think the problem, I think this is kind of a problem is have easy in quotes.

145
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:31,080
It is to write an electron app and just shuffle it to all the platforms that people kind of

146
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,480
write lazy electron apps.

147
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,480
If that makes sense.

148
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,600
Yeah, it does.

149
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:39,720
Or it's it's just a non-optimized version at least I can tell you when I'm working on

150
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:45,200
Mac, I noticed the electron apps a lot more because you know, they're not bespoke and

151
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:47,840
didn't cost me, you know, 27 Starbucks lattes.

152
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:48,840
Yeah.

153
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:52,480
Well, the other thing is on Linux, there's a lot less standardization, right?

154
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,960
People just kind of do what they're doing with their apps and sometimes things like

155
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,580
randomly pulling KDE or cute components.

156
00:05:57,580 --> 00:06:01,560
So having a mismatched UI isn't a shocker, right?

157
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:05,120
When on Mac I can like tell like, okay, a little slack is doing something ridiculous

158
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:10,280
because it's actually like a Chrome instance, right?

159
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:12,920
Having said that, I sell electron apps to people.

160
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:15,600
I think they're great for line of business apps.

161
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:21,400
I don't think anything but web apps makes a ton of sense in most normal cases, unless

162
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:27,040
you're doing something like CAD or you know, like flight simulators.

163
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,040
I don't know.

164
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,040
What's your take?

165
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:34,520
It's the trade offs these days are you probably want to go with web standards in general.

166
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:41,880
I really connect with where Mike K is coming from in this email because as Linux users,

167
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:45,640
like you better, you better learn to love electron because it's probably the only shot

168
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:50,920
Linux users have for large corporations to invest development time is if they invest

169
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:54,560
development time that can be deployed on multiple environments.

170
00:06:54,560 --> 00:07:00,760
And right now, especially with Microsoft looking at developing electron or I'm sorry, outlook

171
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:05,520
in electron and likely other office applications and electron in the future after outlook comes

172
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:06,520
out.

173
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:10,040
I think it's probably just going to be a lot more, not a lot less, especially in the business

174
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:14,680
line of applications where enterprise applications have traditionally been kind of clunkers to

175
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:15,960
begin with.

176
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:20,880
So UI and performance aren't typically first or even second or third priorities with those

177
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:21,880
applications.

178
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:26,520
So I totally see where he's coming from because Linux users, this is their best shot.

179
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:29,640
And I'll tell you, it's like many things in tech.

180
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:33,600
The problem is nuanced and complex.

181
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:39,560
Fundamentally, you could make a security argument that you have a really kind of complicated

182
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:45,920
chromium stack that gets shipped with these applications and some of them don't get properly

183
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:46,920
updated.

184
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:49,000
And so you could have different stacks at different times.

185
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:54,760
So you could have Slack using one electron stack and you could have Discord using a separate

186
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:55,760
one.

187
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:58,160
And perhaps the Slack one is vulnerable to something that Discord isn't.

188
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:02,480
And so it's kind of a mix match and a large surface for attack.

189
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:04,120
And so that has a security criticism.

190
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:08,200
Then you have the performance criticism and you have the native application criticism.

191
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:14,920
And I think like so many things in technology, none of that stuff fundamentally matters for

192
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:18,680
why it gets adopted and why it gets deployed and why it gets market share.

193
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:24,080
And all those things can be true about something and it'll still be a successful technology

194
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,080
platform.

195
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:31,240
And I hate to be a non-controversial on this, but over time, I think I've started to just

196
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,680
get used to electron apps.

197
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:36,400
You guys know, I mean, traditionally, I really am not a big fan of web applications, but

198
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:40,320
the thing that I like at least about electron apps is they get it out of my damn browser

199
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:45,160
and it's one less thing that my browser can take down or it's one less tab in my browser.

200
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:48,920
I prefer that these things have their own windows, their own processes so I can kill

201
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:52,080
them or they can crash on their own and they're independent.

202
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:56,800
And at least electron, in that sense, it gives me that with these web applications.

203
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:01,820
And I am kind of delighted sometimes when I'm using an application as a desktop app

204
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:07,320
and then I go to the web and I find essentially a total and complete implementation that is

205
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,960
in the web for when I need it.

206
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:14,520
VS codes web server version of this, for example, is just great because it's essentially VS

207
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:17,840
code that I can run in a Docker container on a web server on my LAN.

208
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:18,840
And I love that.

209
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:19,840
Now, you know what?

210
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:20,840
This is great.

211
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,600
So there is advantages to it as well.

212
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:27,640
But I definitely can also sympathize with the performance argument.

213
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:30,280
This is my last point is on Arch Linux.

214
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:34,840
You can play around with this a little bit and see the difference.

215
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:40,340
There's specific versions of common packages like Slack and Discord that you can opt to

216
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:46,580
use the arch system version of electron, which is always very up to date and the most performant

217
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:47,960
version available.

218
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:51,080
And so the these packages install the applications.

219
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:56,160
But instead of using their bundled electron runtime, use the system electron runtime.

220
00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:01,960
And you notice certain things work a lot better and it runs a lot faster.

221
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:05,360
And you realize that there is still performance gains to be had.

222
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:09,420
And part of it is just a lack of optimization and a lack and a lack of keeping these things

223
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:10,420
up to date.

224
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:16,080
And now on my workstation upstairs here in the studio, my like my office space, I run

225
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:21,360
these versions of Slack and Discord that use the system electron and they use less RAM

226
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,120
and they perform better.

227
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,900
And if you have if you can look, look for your systems, I'm sure it's available for

228
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:30,000
other distros and desktops out there and you notice a performance improvement.

229
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,840
So that tells me there is room for improvement.

230
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,880
They're just not taking it.

231
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:39,000
So I think there's people have a valid argument there, too, like all things in tech.

232
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
It's complicated.

233
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Right.

234
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
It's complicated.

235
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
It's really how it is.

236
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Yeah, I think it's fair.

237
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,160
I think that's I mean, I said one thing.

238
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:50,240
I don't think anyone's going to win the argument against electron or something like it.

239
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:55,200
You imagine if, you know, in five years, all of office is just shipped as an electron app.

240
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,320
I mean, the argument's over.

241
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,360
Corporate America is not going to care.

242
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:01,960
I think that's almost a certainty.

243
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:07,960
Alex writes in and he says, I'm a mechanical engineer training recently to do some development.

244
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:13,280
But check out what he does is he says, I'd like to talk about how I think that programming

245
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:16,880
is becoming a critical skill for anybody working in a technical field.

246
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:20,120
I've reached the limits of what spreadsheets on on more than one occasion.

247
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:24,880
And so I've been thankful that I've had programming skills to fall back on.

248
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:31,960
He's recently been doing CAD design automation in Python, which he says is really changing

249
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,480
his game.

250
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:36,200
And also he's moved over to the M1 and loving it.

251
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:40,160
We got several people this week that said that they moved over to the M1 and love it.

252
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:45,680
So I'm one loving that email and one grand loving if you catch my drift.

253
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:50,180
And then he asked if I've launched a network wide support, you know, so you can get a membership

254
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:52,320
and get access to all the show's special features.

255
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,520
I was really, really close, but it backfired on me.

256
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:56,720
So I kind of hit the pause button.

257
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:57,720
That's not out yet.

258
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:01,760
But I am hoping to make good for anybody who's a patron at Patreon.com slash Jupiter signal.

259
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:05,880
Whatever I come up as a bundle, I'm going to try to include everybody over there.

260
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:10,440
So Jasmine writes in and we were asking people how they test and she says, how do I test

261
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,440
painfully?

262
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,440
I'm working.

263
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,440
I know.

264
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,440
I love that.

265
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:19,560
I'm working on an enterprise application and a mono repo built on a Java 8 and Docker.

266
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:24,480
All our builds use Apache Ant and we do our unit testing with a combination of Junit and

267
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,640
I think it's Makito.

268
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:33,200
The problem is, besides Java 8 woes, our unit testing is old, crusty and all around a bad

269
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,200
time.

270
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:38,120
I saw by more than one senior dev that they expected that they expected they'd have time

271
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:41,040
to fix it and write unit tests that are better.

272
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:45,020
But of course, that never actually opens and happens and it takes sometimes one to two

273
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:47,820
and a half times as long as writing actual code.

274
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:51,280
As of right now, I've been around six months on the job.

275
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:53,760
They are sadly correct, as I have learned.

276
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:58,500
Our unit testing is functional integration testing by just a different name, causing

277
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:02,280
nearly everything to be extremely complex and complicated.

278
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:06,080
You know, kind of the opposite of what unit testing means.

279
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:10,040
Our service mocks actually make everything much harder to test or fix while actually

280
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:13,200
also hiding bugs from us.

281
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,800
This is so painful.

282
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:18,760
All this of the fact that our testing finds such a minuscule amount of issues, it makes

283
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:21,340
it full rage inducing.

284
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:23,560
That is the key thing at the end there.

285
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:26,400
When they go through all this trouble, it actually just finds like a tiny amount of

286
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:27,400
issues.

287
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:28,400
Right.

288
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:30,400
It's like trivial issues that never would stop a release.

289
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:31,400
Yeah.

290
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,400
That's how I test.

291
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,400
She says.

292
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:36,400
Honestly, Jasmine, I feel your pain.

293
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:41,720
For years, I have been kind of a curmudgeon on the whole unit testing thing.

294
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:45,560
You know, at a certain scale, I've never seen a case, and I know I'm going to get a lot

295
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:50,120
of hate mail for this one, where maintaining the unit test doesn't just become like somebody's

296
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:56,920
job and it's just like this huge overhead and people get tempted to write them.

297
00:13:56,920 --> 00:14:02,480
So I can't think of a good adjective or adverb here, but let's just say they write them in

298
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,200
a way that they're unlikely to fail.

299
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,200
Yeah.

300
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,200
You know what?

301
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:11,160
I know my fellow Ruby hipsters will want to jump down my throat, but I still don't think

302
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:13,840
you can replace manual testing.

303
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:18,520
I haven't bought into the unit testing, and I know that's a sacrilege.

304
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:21,920
I know there's lots of blog posts about how you're not a real developer unless you embrace

305
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,200
test first development or whatever.

306
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:28,320
I'm going to obviously have to take the opposite side just so that way I don't get flamed.

307
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,320
Of course.

308
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,440
That's a spicy day.

309
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:34,040
Because it's important to spend four out of five days in your week writing unit tests,

310
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,040
right?

311
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,040
Well, I know.

312
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:38,720
Like, where do you even figure out the limit there?

313
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:41,600
And especially a small team, too.

314
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:44,560
It's just really, it's a whole other level of...

315
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:45,560
It's a whole other job.

316
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:51,840
Well, I think what happens is, and I like what AS, I can't even say that, but someone

317
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:56,800
in the chat is saying where, you know, testing your implementation details in kind of like

318
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:57,800
asterisks.

319
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:03,400
But the problem is as a system gets bigger and bigger and bigger, there's all these weird

320
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:07,920
details, quote unquote, edge cases and things where, yeah, sure, unit tests are super cool

321
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:11,960
on like the first 1.0, and they make a ton of sense when you know the logic.

322
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:17,000
But what if someone comes back to you and says, I don't know, let's rewrite how permissions

323
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,560
work in this giant application.

324
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:23,080
And you have a couple of hundred tests that now just fail overnight.

325
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,080
Yeah.

326
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:26,280
Do you even bother really redoing them at that point?

327
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:28,520
At some point, is it just like a sunk cost, right?

328
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:29,520
Yeah.

329
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:30,520
Okay.

330
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:31,520
So Steve from Canada is doing a check in.

331
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:34,600
It says, hey, guys, I know you're asking for feedback on our home setups.

332
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,880
I thought I'd chime in as well as with the rest of us.

333
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:40,560
I'm now working from home, or I guess you should probably say a lot of you.

334
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,880
I'm working from home indefinitely now.

335
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:48,080
Previous to that, I was about 85 to 90% on the road.

336
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:53,200
So he went from nearly 90% on the road to indefinitely working at home now.

337
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,200
It's a win.

338
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,200
Yeah.

339
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,200
Yeah.

340
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,200
I agree for him.

341
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,200
It's probably got to be a huge quality of life improvement.

342
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:03,320
But I was just thinking, if even five or 10% of people who work from who were traveling

343
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:06,560
that much are now just working from home, things are going to change forever.

344
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,640
I'm really just curious to see where that goes.

345
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:10,560
But he goes crazy with the monitors.

346
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:15,640
He has two horizontal monitors on top and a 132 inch 2K monitor in the middle, which

347
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:16,720
is my setup, too.

348
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:21,360
But then he has another vertical, additional vertical monitor, I think he puts on the left.

349
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:25,300
He got himself a new keyboard after using a $20 keyboard for years.

350
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:30,560
He got himself a Red Dragon, I think a Cerurra mechanical keyboard.

351
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:31,560
I don't know.

352
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:32,560
I don't know how these things are pronounced.

353
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:33,560
Whatever.

354
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:34,560
It's a dragon.

355
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:35,560
Let's not piss it off.

356
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:36,560
I know.

357
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:37,560
I was like, dragons are great.

358
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:38,560
But you know what he says in here?

359
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:39,560
And this is interesting.

360
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:41,240
My buddy Alex has kind of shown me this, too.

361
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:45,120
He's surprised nobody's written in and talked about what a hack it is to have a 3D printer

362
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:49,240
because he prints bins for stuff and desk organizers.

363
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:54,840
And he says his whole desk is completely decolored now because of his 3D printer.

364
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:58,240
So I think, you know, he says he tried to meet up with you one time in Jersey or twice

365
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,240
in Jersey.

366
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:00,240
So he's that Steve, if you remember.

367
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:03,400
He must have been the Steve that was stalking you for a bit.

368
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:04,400
I don't mind being stalked.

369
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,400
That's OK.

370
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,400
You know what?

371
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,400
I'm pretty lonely these days.

372
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,400
I could use a stalker.

373
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,400
Especially if the stalker's bringing beer.

374
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,400
You know?

375
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,400
Well, I'm trying to trim down.

376
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:15,200
Let's do, like, Tito's gluten-free vodka, but sure.

377
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,200
Are you really?

378
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,200
Are you?

379
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:19,160
You're not doing the glutes anymore, huh?

380
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:23,200
No, I am doing the glutes, but I've lost 20 pounds, man.

381
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,200
Congratulations.

382
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,200
That's awesome.

383
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:27,160
And mostly just cutting back on carbs and stuff or what?

384
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:28,160
Yeah.

385
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,920
And I've been doing intermittent fasting.

386
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:30,920
You know what?

387
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:34,040
People laughed at me when I talked about that a couple of years ago, but it's a serious

388
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:38,400
way to get just like, I don't know, it makes kind of sounds like just stop eating after

389
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,400
sunset.

390
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,400
Like, is that such a crazy idea?

391
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,400
Yeah.

392
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:45,320
Well, I don't eat until roughly 11, and then I don't eat at night, so.

393
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:47,480
So what time do you stop eating at night?

394
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:49,720
I mean, sunset right now is kind of stupid.

395
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:50,720
It's like 530.

396
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:51,720
Yeah.

397
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:54,760
But I don't eat past, I think, seven or eight, but seven.

398
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:56,320
Seven's usually my cutoff, too, if I do it.

399
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:57,560
I got to get back into it.

400
00:17:57,560 --> 00:18:00,640
It helps because I have a four-year-old who I currently have who's like, yeah, no, I'm

401
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:01,640
tired.

402
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:02,640
Let's go to bed.

403
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:06,000
See, I have the opposite problem, is my little monsters want to eat until right up until

404
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,360
bedtime despite me trying hours before bedtime, making sure they've eaten everything.

405
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:11,360
Yeah.

406
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,360
And brush their teeth.

407
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:15,600
They still get hungry right around bedtime constantly.

408
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:19,960
They just are little weeds, and it's cliche to say it, but I legitimately have no idea

409
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:20,960
where they put it all.

410
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:21,960
Something else.

411
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:22,960
Oh, no.

412
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:23,960
My kids, my son's the same way.

413
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:29,960
It's like, I bought a giant bag of apples, and I'm like, this will last a week.

414
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:35,080
And I was at Publix today buying another bag of apples, and it's Monday.

415
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:37,360
I bought it, granted, I brought it on Friday, but yeah.

416
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,520
This will last a week, and it's gone in a day.

417
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:44,040
Yeah, cut out beer, cut out, and it's basically if you want to drink, it's just like clear

418
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:48,440
liquor, but like club soda, no tonic, no mixers.

419
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:52,440
Like I don't eat out much anymore because, you know, the apocalypse.

420
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:56,040
I went the opposite way as far as that, is I, instead of going to grocery stores, I started

421
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:57,600
ordering food a lot more.

422
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:01,520
I was doing that for a while, and I ballooned up, and I was kind of like, okay, no.

423
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:02,960
Yeah, it's wild.

424
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:05,080
It's wild how much eating out affects that.

425
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:06,080
It's really something.

426
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:09,120
Well, and you know, I'm single now, so I'm on the prowl, so you know.

427
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:14,680
You want to be a slim and cut gentleman who is attractive to the ladies.

428
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:21,360
Yes, and ladies, if you happen to own any patents for, I don't know, automation technology,

429
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:25,080
I would love to meet you, and there's a deal we can make.

430
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,560
I love it.

431
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:30,520
In the meantime, Jason writes in, you know, we were asking people about their work setups.

432
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:32,280
We got a lot of M1ers.

433
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:34,660
They're really representing, they're hyped right now.

434
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:35,660
Take out the robe, guys.

435
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:36,660
Yeah.

436
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:37,660
Let's go.

437
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:38,660
Take them out.

438
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:42,520
Although the thing is, a lot of the M1ers out there are also robe bros.

439
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:43,520
I know.

440
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:44,520
There's a high overlap.

441
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:45,520
Yeah.

442
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:53,080
You know, I've never in the history of this show seen a new product take off in our audience

443
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:54,080
like this before.

444
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:56,000
Like the robe or the M1 or both?

445
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Well, both, actually.

446
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Oh, Jesus.

447
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:03,000
I mean, I'd say we probably got seven people this week that were writing us from an M1.

448
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Oh, yeah.

449
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
I got a bunch of tweets.

450
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
People are saying they love it.

451
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Yeah.

452
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
It's kind of significant.

453
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Jason writes in.

454
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
He's on a Linux stack.

455
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,040
He says, I'm a full-time open-source developer working on a project that's written in C,

456
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:18,120
and as of 2017 includes some Rust components, and I couldn't be happier.

457
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:19,360
Oh, ho, ho.

458
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:20,360
Got a Rust mention in here.

459
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:21,360
It's been a bit.

460
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:22,360
Take a shot.

461
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:23,360
Yeah.

462
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:26,680
But only something clear with Sparkling Water.

463
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:27,680
You know, like Jim.

464
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:32,080
He says, my day-to-day environment has been Fedora with GNOME since Fedora S7.

465
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:36,800
I use the Terminal, Emacs, IntelliJ for Rust, and some experimentation with VS Code these

466
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:37,800
days.

467
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:41,320
My 10-plus years with IntelliJ is a hard habit to break.

468
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:45,200
And of course, Chrome and too many electron apps for all the chat systems.

469
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,720
There's an electron slam.

470
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:50,680
In the evenings, I play with writing crypto trading bots.

471
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:52,880
Oh, Jason, let's talk, my friend.

472
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:56,360
Let's talk, which is a great way to try out new things with Rust.

473
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:58,560
Jason, email your buddy, Chris.

474
00:20:58,560 --> 00:20:59,700
Come on.

475
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:01,160
Let's get some Ethereum action going.

476
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,160
Jesus Christ.

477
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,160
Robes of Ethereum.

478
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:04,160
I know, right?

479
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:05,160
Well, come on.

480
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,160
What else do I have?

481
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:08,800
Well, come on, what else do I got going?

482
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:09,800
You know?

483
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:10,800
I'm in the same boat.

484
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:11,800
Hook me up.

485
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:12,800
I got some GPUs.

486
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:16,560
Ethereum's going to be my health plan and my retirement plan.

487
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:24,920
Ice says, I have an aging i7 overclocked to 4.2 gigahertz, MVMEs, and AMD RX 580s.

488
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:27,160
Sounds a lot like my setup.

489
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:30,880
And I have some off-lease Xeon servers in the closet running Elasticsearch, Plex, et

490
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:31,880
cetera.

491
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:32,960
Keep up the great work.

492
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:35,960
I appreciate Jason telling us about his server setup, too.

493
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:39,960
You know, people didn't really tell us if they're running any home server infrastructure.

494
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:40,960
So that's your next question.

495
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:43,320
Shoot, I should have asked you last time.

496
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:46,420
What is your, do you have a little home setup system?

497
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:48,340
Maybe some VMs for testing?

498
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:49,340
Some CI stuff?

499
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:50,340
Let us know.

500
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:51,340
Coder.show slash contact.

501
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:53,440
Yeah, I actually was wondering that, too.

502
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:56,720
With COVID and everything, are more people just being like, to hell with it, let me just

503
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:58,440
run a server?

504
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:00,340
Maybe that's why people are buying Mac Minis.

505
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:02,440
So Asish wants to write in to make me sad.

506
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:07,440
M1 Air with eight gigs of RAM, he says, I mostly do back-end node nowadays, also deploying

507
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:10,520
to Lambda, and I have yet to feel constrained by the eight gig limit.

508
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:12,600
Now, you got one with 16 gigs, right, Mike?

509
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:15,800
Yeah, because I like to let money on fire, but let's just keep moving.

510
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:19,240
Have you noticed it being a limitation in terms of performance at all?

511
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:23,920
What I've noticed is that it makes me want to take this iMac Pro and drop kick it.

512
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:26,280
But like you haven't like ran out of RAM, right?

513
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:27,280
Never.

514
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:28,880
I haven't even like seen a stutter.

515
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:33,120
I think unless I'm doing multiple VMs, I could really make 16 gigs work.

516
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:36,560
I prefer to have, actually I don't even need 32, 24 would be the sweet spot.

517
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:41,960
But anyways, he doesn't know if he'll hit that limit yet, but he does plan to do some

518
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:42,960
VM soon.

519
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:47,560
He initially got the M1 because his web meetings on his laptop were just sucking and he wanted

520
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:49,840
to appear at least somewhat presentable.

521
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:52,200
And so he got the cheapest MacBook Air possible.

522
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:56,520
He says, to make me a little sad though, me, Chris, I'd expect the desktop to also go the

523
00:22:56,520 --> 00:23:01,680
way of the console when ARM and RISC-V come to x86 home turf.

524
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:05,020
I like being able to load whatever I want on there.

525
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:06,200
That's my thing.

526
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:10,460
That's the thing about the x86 platform is you could always build your own beast if you

527
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:11,460
really had to.

528
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:17,800
You could go crazy with some Threadripper system and 128 gigabytes of RAM and 24 terabytes

529
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:18,860
of internal storage.

530
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:21,240
You could really go nuts with some of these.

531
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:27,320
I was looking at the Lenovo P60, which is a Threadripper based Linux workstation that

532
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:30,480
starts at around $6,000.

533
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:35,840
And then you look at like the Thaleo, which you can just spec out to be an absolute monster.

534
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:40,280
I bet it's going to be a long time before Apple meets that kind of performance.

535
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:42,040
How much you want to bet?

536
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:44,840
Put it in the only currency you actually care about, robes.

537
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:47,360
I'll bet you a robe.

538
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:48,360
Bet me a robe?

539
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:49,360
All right.

540
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:50,360
I bet you a robe with a selfie.

541
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:57,280
So we have a topic we should wait till we get there, but I have some thoughts too.

542
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:59,200
Datadog.com slash Coder Radio.

543
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,520
This episode right here, yeah, it's sponsored by Datadog.

544
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:02,520
Now who is Datadog?

545
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:05,360
Well, they're solving big problems for you.

546
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:10,840
All your applications, all your systems across all your clouds in one place through the unified

547
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:15,560
monitoring and analytics platform that gives you comprehensive visibility into your cloud,

548
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:19,080
into your hybrid clouds, like you got some on-prems, yeah, they're going to do that.

549
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:21,640
You quickly analyze the performance of your Linux servers.

550
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:26,040
You get beautiful real-time dashboards, got to go see these dashboards at their website.

551
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:28,260
Go to Datadog.com slash Coder Radio.

552
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:33,120
You can customize the dashboards and troubleshoot issues in seconds with a unified view of your

553
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:36,060
metrics, your traces, your logs, all in one place.

554
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:40,400
And then you have turnkey integrations with over 400 technologies, so really make it easy

555
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,280
to just plug in and start working.

556
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:46,720
You can use Datadog to watch key metrics on your Linux boxes, compare them with metrics

557
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:49,640
from like, say, just the application inside a container.

558
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:53,280
I mean, you get real full stack visibility with these tools.

559
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:54,880
You should really check it out.

560
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:58,360
They wrote some of their agents and rewrote some of their agents semi-recently a couple

561
00:24:58,360 --> 00:24:59,360
years ago now.

562
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:03,880
They've iterated on a few times in Go, and it's super simple to get up and going if you

563
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:04,880
need one of those tools.

564
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:08,320
Their integrations are just really fast and straightforward.

565
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:13,040
And you can start a free trial if you create one dashboard, you get a free Datadog t-shirt

566
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:18,440
by supporting us and checking out datadog.com slash CoderRadio.

567
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:21,160
Support the show, free swag, unify your metrics.

568
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:22,480
It's a win, win, win.

569
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,720
Imagine it, you're troubleshooting a problem.

570
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:28,420
One team needs to communicate with another team, Datadog can help you visualize it all

571
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:36,200
across the entire infrastructure, datadog.com slash CoderRadio.

572
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:39,280
Little bit more feedback and then we will continue on.

573
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:41,680
We have so much email, it's great.

574
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:43,660
And I really actually appreciate it, I love it.

575
00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:47,080
It's exciting to open it up and go, man, look at all these people that wrote in.

576
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:48,700
And we had one really cool one.

577
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:53,840
We had a listener who's specializing in high-speed optical transceivers, how about that?

578
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:58,560
Gabriel is a software engineer for a small company specializing in these optical transceivers,

579
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:01,380
and the team is developing a new transceiver from scratch.

580
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:05,840
He writes the firmware for the transceiver in addition to any programs that need to interface

581
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:08,920
with it for testing, you know, for development or production uses.

582
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:12,800
And he says, since I'm working with embedded devices, my day-to-day involves reading too

583
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:17,460
much documentation for too little information and dealing with hardware oddities and working

584
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:20,080
around limited development software.

585
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:24,640
I am forced to use Windows as the tool chain for the microcontroller we're using.

586
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:27,000
It's proprietary, it only works on Windows.

587
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,760
The compiler is built into the proprietary IDE.

588
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:33,800
Actually he says, thank Jar Jar, it's not based on Eclipse.

589
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:37,260
You're so welcome.

590
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:38,720
Built in, you gotta love that.

591
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:42,820
It looks like it was pulled right out of Windows 95, it says there's a few desktop applications

592
00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:43,820
I do write.

593
00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:46,560
My go-to language is Rust.

594
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:47,560
Second Rust mention.

595
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:48,560
It's a double.

596
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:52,760
I'll be honest, I don't make anything more complex than a CLI application, but the libraries

597
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:55,060
available for us make it so easy.

598
00:26:55,060 --> 00:26:58,920
I've been using Rust for years and I've loved nearly every moment of it.

599
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:02,280
If I say much more than that, I'll just start sounding like a fanboy.

600
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:03,840
Keep up the work, thanks you two.

601
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:09,200
If you're gonna be a fanboy, Rust is obviously the right choice.

602
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,200
Not a bad one, right?

603
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:11,200
Right.

604
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:16,240
I mean, it's a language that punishes you up front.

605
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:18,480
So you don't get angry customers later.

606
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,200
That's kind of all I want.

607
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:22,600
Okay, so this is our last one today.

608
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:27,440
Brian writes in, he works for a US hosting company, we're not gonna say which one.

609
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:33,820
He says they got great sysadmins, a good solid sysadmin team, but he is the sole developer

610
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:36,440
for the entire company.

611
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:42,640
So his roles range from a small command line utility to distribute services and some of

612
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:47,440
their microservices to entire front ends written in React.

613
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:51,920
He also ends up doing a lot of his own DevOps work to support his applications.

614
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,480
Can you imagine?

615
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:57,800
Like Brian must be like tense and stressed all the time.

616
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:59,480
Just yikes.

617
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:04,440
Brian, convince your managers to hire a vendor to help you with that development work.

618
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:05,440
Right.

619
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:07,960
And I just happened to know one, the mad botter in Florida.

620
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:08,960
Boom.

621
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:13,240
No, but kidding aside, that's terrible.

622
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:15,360
That's just a lot of ground for one person to cover.

623
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,960
It really is.

624
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:20,440
And to make things a little more challenging, there's several thousand servers that are

625
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:21,800
running Windows.

626
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:24,560
So he has to write a lot of stuff that interfaces with them too.

627
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:26,120
He runs Fedora on his workstation.

628
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:28,240
He's got an XPS 15 for that.

629
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:29,720
Good choice.

630
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:31,200
Yeah, right.

631
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,980
But his predecessor, I think, used a lot of.NET.

632
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:36,200
So he's been learning it, been picking it up.

633
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:39,040
And he's actually pretty happy that he can get it working as well as it does on Linux.

634
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:41,260
And management is happy that he's using their preferred language.

635
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:43,560
So that's all actually kind of working out pretty well.

636
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:48,680
He says it's a hobby he recently branched out to writing small GTK based applications

637
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:55,280
in C. And he's making inroads into learning things like Rust.

638
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:56,280
It's a Rust week, Mike.

639
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:57,280
It's a Rust week.

640
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:59,560
It's time to hit the ground, folks, because that's a triple shot.

641
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:00,680
No kidding.

642
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:01,680
People are going to get wasted.

643
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:02,680
He says all the best.

644
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:03,680
Thanks, Brian.

645
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:09,480
So for the hobby dev, I would, or hobby development rather, I would almost suggest you take a

646
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:13,680
look at like an Uno or an Avalonia if you already are proficient in C Sharp.

647
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:16,800
I know you're doing it for a hobby, so maybe you want to branch out.

648
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:21,280
But if it's something you need for yourself or you just want to put out there, if you're

649
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:27,720
familiar with the.NET stack, those are, I mean, I've done quite a bit of Avalonia, a

650
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:31,980
little more than I'd like to admit to, to be totally honest with you.

651
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:33,440
It's a great stack.

652
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:42,040
It's maybe I'm hesitating a little because now Xamarin is getting Linux support and without

653
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:47,120
putting a dog in this fight, Uno has kind of surpassed them in a lot of ways.

654
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:53,960
It's still a great platform, and the big benefit is their implementation of GTK apps is actually

655
00:29:53,960 --> 00:30:02,960
like native GTK, where I believe Uno is still a WA WebAssembly, WASM, how do you say that?

656
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:05,440
Do you say WASM or I just say WebAssembly now?

657
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:10,120
Well, I say WASM to be kind of a little bit of a troll about it.

658
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:11,120
It's WASM.

659
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:14,320
Yeah, but Brian, maybe it's time to polish up that resume too.

660
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:15,320
Just saying.

661
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:16,320
Yeah.

662
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:17,320
Yeah, I wonder.

663
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:20,720
I hope he's got a decent package, I mean, payment package.

664
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:23,480
I was going to say, really, Chris?

665
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:26,480
You know, that's just, that's not the way I...

666
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:29,560
You know, we do the show at night and we're just a little looser than we used to be.

667
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:34,200
I just, I was thinking payments and like bonuses and health insurance, you know, the whole

668
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,200
package.

669
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,200
Wait, health insurance?

670
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:37,200
Yeah, I know, right?

671
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,200
What are we, Sweden?

672
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:40,200
Don't even get me started.

673
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:41,200
You know what?

674
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:44,520
All the European listeners get mad at us every time we do that.

675
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:48,080
They roll their eyes at us whenever we talk about health insurance, ISPs, or cell phone

676
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:49,080
plans.

677
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:50,880
Remember the dude who was like, just come move to Germany?

678
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:51,880
Yeah.

679
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:52,880
Yeah.

680
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:53,880
He's probably right though.

681
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:56,800
I mean, I do like beer and pretzels, although I'm off beer right now.

682
00:30:56,800 --> 00:31:02,120
I'm toying long term, like, you know, when the kids are all old and grown up and, you

683
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:05,120
know, they have their own lives and don't care about old dad anymore.

684
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:06,960
I could podcast from anywhere in the world, right?

685
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:07,960
So why stay here?

686
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:09,700
Why not go somewhere warm?

687
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:12,080
Whatever happened to Amsterdam?

688
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:13,080
Remember that whole phenomenon?

689
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:14,080
Oh yeah.

690
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:15,440
The app developers were moving to Amsterdam.

691
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:16,440
Yeah.

692
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:18,480
Maybe I should go check in and see what happened to Amsterdam.

693
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:21,160
You know, I don't know if I'm, I don't think that's where I want to go though.

694
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:24,400
I think table stakes are an M1 to get in though.

695
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:26,960
Oh geez.

696
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:29,200
I got to tell you about this M1 situation.

697
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,200
Let's do it.

698
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:31,200
All right.

699
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:36,880
So why don't we, to get there, why don't we talk about what Intel had to say recently.

700
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:37,880
That they're sorry.

701
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:45,600
They've got a new CEO and he's, uh, he's shooting some fire.

702
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:50,620
He says that Apple is a lifestyle brand and that they have to deliver better products

703
00:31:50,620 --> 00:31:55,480
in the PC ecosystem than that lifestyle company and corporate Tino makes.

704
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:57,720
Uh, we have to be good in the future.

705
00:31:57,720 --> 00:32:05,760
He says, we should ship products that don't suck.

706
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:09,600
They gotta be good in the future, so problem solved, right?

707
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:14,720
I mean, my general strategy for 2021 is just suck a little less.

708
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:15,720
Yeah.

709
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:19,680
Like I kind of, I saw this when you put it in the doc and I was like, I actually thought

710
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:20,680
it was a joke.

711
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:21,680
I know.

712
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:25,480
And calling the Apple, which is one of the richest companies in the world with one of

713
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:31,600
the more interesting tech stories ever, uh, calling them a lifestyle brand is clearly

714
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:35,960
just trying to be demeaning to what used to be one of their best customers, but, uh, their

715
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:42,900
current CEO, Bob Swan is stepping down on Feb 5th, uh, 15th, 15th, 15th, not fifth.

716
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:44,880
And the new guy who's not a new guy at all.

717
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:49,320
In fact, I think he worked at Intel for like 30 years left and is coming back to replace

718
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:50,320
Bob Swan.

719
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:52,360
His name's Pat.

720
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:53,680
And he told him to be good.

721
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:59,000
I assume as a CEO, you don't want to say, you know what guys, let's just be really lousy

722
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,000
this year.

723
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:05,080
Really, you know, this year our CPUs are going to be hotter and slower.

724
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:06,080
That's the plan.

725
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:07,080
Right?

726
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:08,080
Yeah.

727
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:09,080
I think they're outsourcing some of that.

728
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:11,200
I think they've just kind of decided, fine, we're going to outsource the TSMC a little

729
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:17,640
bit for some of the manufacturing, um, we'll see, but, um, along, along these same lines,

730
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:23,640
there's been a lot of information that kind of just so happened to leak about Apple during

731
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:29,500
CES week, just news that just happened to dominate the CES news cycle accidentally came

732
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:35,160
out from Mark Gurman, which he, and also, so there's two, there's two sources this week,

733
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:42,660
both who have extremely accurate track records, uh, Ming-Chao Kuo and Mark Gurman have really

734
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:45,600
significantly pretty, pretty accurate track records.

735
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:51,960
They are saying that Apple has a brand new strategy for the, uh, Apple processor based

736
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:58,740
14 inch and 16 inch Mac books that will be coming out this year, featuring Apple Silicon.

737
00:33:58,740 --> 00:34:05,700
And the big idea is get ready for this, the return of MagSafe, adding more ports back

738
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:11,960
and getting rid of the touch bar, literally just undoing and wiping away the entire Johnny

739
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:18,600
Ive era because the keyboard's now gone, touch bar is now gone and bringing MagSafe back

740
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:22,680
would basically wipe out Johnny, Johnny Ives touch on the Mac book.

741
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:26,320
Kind of admitting that the last five or six years or seven years or whatever it's been

742
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:28,160
of Mac books was a failure.

743
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:29,160
Yeah.

744
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:31,640
One of the things I love about my air is it does not have a touch bar.

745
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:34,640
Uh, you know, I guess I never really used it enough to care.

746
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:35,640
I don't know.

747
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:38,840
It just seemed fine, but yeah, it seems like extra taps to do basic things like turn up

748
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:39,840
the volume.

749
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:43,800
Every once in a while the touch bar gets weird, but we don't need to bash on it because it's

750
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:45,420
obviously going away.

751
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:49,840
That's the real meta story though, that in order to be competitive again, not just adding

752
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:56,320
a faster processor and just sticking with USB-C, but actually kind of considering additional

753
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:57,320
ports.

754
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:58,880
And German, you know, he's usually right.

755
00:34:58,880 --> 00:34:59,880
Yeah.

756
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:00,880
I do.

757
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:06,000
I do worry about the MagSafe thing only because is that going to be a proprietary port now?

758
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,000
Probably I'd bet.

759
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,440
I'd bet it's still with charge over USB-C as well.

760
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:14,480
You get both, you know, just going to be confusing cause they've got MagSafe for the phone.

761
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:25,320
Also 21.5 and 27 inch M based Mac iMacs with edge to edge screens and a Mac pro mini with

762
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:26,320
a brand new display.

763
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:30,840
This is, this is, this is what they're claiming is coming this year.

764
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:33,080
And you know, we've been getting people that have read into the written of the show and

765
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:35,200
saying, Chris, you need to get an M1.

766
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:39,760
You need to experience what this is like because it's a pretty big shift and just reading about

767
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:42,440
it isn't sufficient to understand it.

768
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:44,400
And I have had that happen.

769
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:49,280
I feel like Docker is my most recent thing where, you know, we knew about Docker from

770
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:50,560
day one.

771
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:52,840
We talked to the, we talked to the original founders.

772
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:56,000
When they were still cloud, whatever their name, dot cloud, right?

773
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:01,720
So we got it, you know, conceptually I got it, but it really wasn't until I started deploying

774
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:02,720
my own services.

775
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:07,760
When I switched from using VMs to using containers, I was like, Oh, the application and the data

776
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:08,760
are totally separate.

777
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:12,080
I can destroy and stand up the application whenever I want, have the absolute latest

778
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:15,920
version and it just keeps on ticking and I can just package that up and send it around

779
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:16,920
the world.

780
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:17,920
That's amazing.

781
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:18,920
And then I got it right.

782
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:23,800
Then I really got why it's, why it's taken off like wildfire and people have said, it's

783
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:27,840
sort of similar, sort of similar with the M one max.

784
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:29,280
And I don't have a counter to that.

785
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:32,560
You've kind of suggested that's true as well.

786
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:35,680
So I've been thinking about what to do in that regard.

787
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:43,200
And I'll tell you in just a moment, lino.com slash coder, go to lino.com slash coder and

788
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:44,200
support the show.

789
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:49,280
I got to hold on a second here, a hundred dollars, a hundred dollars.

790
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:54,160
Obviously apparently crazy Linode is giving you a hundred dollars if you go to lino.com

791
00:36:54,160 --> 00:37:00,120
slash coder, you get a hundred dollars in credit to use on Linode for 60 days towards

792
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:01,120
your new kids.

793
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:02,120
Can't be right.

794
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:03,120
Somebody verify this.

795
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:05,200
You know, Linode is our server provider.

796
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:07,400
We hear from people in the audience that use it all the time.

797
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:12,320
Listener Jeff use Linode to migrate a next cloud instance as a test scenario before he

798
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:13,920
went and deployed it on his land.

799
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:16,980
But while testing it, he realized, shoot, these Linode systems are so much faster than

800
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:18,840
my local box sucking down power.

801
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:20,320
He just migrated to Linode.

802
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:24,360
I just think that's so funny because it was a perfect test for him.

803
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:28,280
Like not only did he verify that he knew how to migrate the data, but then he's like, this

804
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:29,280
is way better.

805
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:31,680
But I use Linode to host everything.

806
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:33,960
I was just messing around with our matrix server today.

807
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:34,960
That's running up on Linode.

808
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:36,560
I've been messing around with peer tube.

809
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:38,040
Of course that's up on Linode.

810
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:43,080
Our backend infrastructure for JB 3.0, it's all Linode because you get fast SSD disk.

811
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:47,640
You get 40 gigabit connections to the hypervisors and 11 data centers around the world.

812
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:50,760
But they have this UI that sits on top of it with their cloud dashboard.

813
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:53,560
That's really intuitive, really clean, simple.

814
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:57,360
When you pull up one of your Linodes right at the top, you get all the vital information,

815
00:37:57,360 --> 00:38:00,760
how to connect to it, what its address is, how to get a remote console.

816
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:03,960
And you come down from that, you get descriptions about its resources.

817
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:06,800
You get a snapshot of its CPU and disk and network IO.

818
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:10,600
And it's all just right there organized for you really intelligently.

819
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:14,240
And you can turn on and enable backups with just a couple of clicks.

820
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:18,200
You don't really have to be some sort of Linux expert to make it work.

821
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:22,760
But if you are, Linode doesn't prevent you from getting behind the scenes and really

822
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:23,760
messing around with stuff.

823
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:31,320
I remember one time I was setting up a mesh VPN system for my mobile router and I needed

824
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:38,320
to actually re-image Linode with their weird Linux appliance image.

825
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:44,640
And Linode actually had official documentation on how to do something like that.

826
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:46,280
Think about that for a moment.

827
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:49,480
Unlike entry-level service providers, they don't try to hide that stuff.

828
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:50,480
It's there if you want.

829
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:53,220
But if you never need it, you don't have to worry about it.

830
00:38:53,220 --> 00:38:55,960
They're dedicated to offering the best virtualized cloud computing.

831
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:58,200
If it runs on Linux, it runs on Linode.

832
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:01,480
You can start with something that's $5 a month and build it up from there.

833
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:06,100
But with our $100 credit, try out a real serious rig.

834
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:08,280
Build something powerful and fast and have some fun.

835
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:10,920
Because it's delightful to use these systems.

836
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:15,600
And then they have great ancillary services like object storage, which is S3 compatible.

837
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:20,440
We have a system that is using their object storage for its video storage.

838
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:24,060
When we upload a video, it's actually using object storage on the backend to store it.

839
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:28,240
So our storage grows dynamically as we need it instead of carving off block storage.

840
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:31,320
We just use object storage and it works great.

841
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:35,560
There's tons of ways to use Linode from hosting a game server or a personal website to building

842
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:39,400
the backend infrastructure for your community and your company.

843

Yeah?

846
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:47,040
Crazy.

847
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:48,040
Yeah.

848
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:49,040
Yeah.

849
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:50,040
We just checked it.

850
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:51,040

852
00:39:55,960 --> 00:40:04,600
And I realized I'm probably, I'm not going to be happy with an M1 MacBook Air or even

853
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:12,540
an M1 MacBook 13, but the Mac mini, the Mac mini is right up my alley.

854
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:15,840
And I was sitting there up in my office and I was like, I could make these three monitors

855
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:19,720
work with a Mac mini M1 and I could really get an experience at least not for the battery

856
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:23,400
life, which sounds incredible, but for the CPU speed.

857
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:30,520
And I was debating what to do because I ordered a brand new Mac mini for Angela because her

858
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:32,720
computer just died on her.

859
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:33,720
Yeah.

860
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:37,080
And her, her battery in her Mac book has blowed up.

861
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:40,740
You know how the old, she has a really old Mac book, like maybe even before Thunderbolt

862
00:40:40,740 --> 00:40:41,740
was a thing.

863
00:40:41,740 --> 00:40:43,720
When they actually become improvised explosive devices.

864
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:44,720
Yes.

865
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:46,760
I'm familiar with that concept.

866
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:52,360
And so we had this massive power outage last week and I guess probably cause the thing

867
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:57,280
had to run on battery for the first time in forever or what, whatever it got real bad,

868
00:40:57,280 --> 00:41:02,420
real fast, but because the power was out, she couldn't order anything for herself because

869
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:03,420
everything was down.

870
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:07,480
And so she drove to like Arby's to send me a text message because even the cell towers

871
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:08,480
were down.

872
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:12,600
We had a really bad storm and she sends me a text message and she's like, can you order

873
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:13,600
me an M1?

874
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:14,600
I'll pay you back.

875
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:15,600
Like what?

876
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:19,880
She's like, yeah, well here's the situation.

877
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:25,800
And so yeah, I went on there and I got a, I, you know, a maxed out M1 Mac book or I'm

878
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:30,000
sorry, Mac mini is 16 terabytes of Ram and two terabytes of storage.

879
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:34,480
But she has a billion pictures, so she had to go with the two terabytes of storage.

880
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:35,480
She just has no choice.

881
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:38,720
And you know, 16 gigs of Ram, what are you, what are you going to do eight?

882
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:40,160
Well, come on.

883
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:44,180
So yeah, I will get a little bit of a hands on time with it.

884
00:41:44,180 --> 00:41:45,180
That's the deal.

885
00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:48,780
That's the trade is for my time to set it up a little bit for her and do the ordering.

886
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:52,620
I'll get a little hands on time with the Mac mini M1, play with it for a few days before

887
00:41:52,620 --> 00:41:57,760
I hand it off to her without having to buy one myself, you know?

888
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:59,440
So it's kind of a good hack.

889
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:02,700
It's not as nice as getting the experience, the laptop, but I think I'd have to have a

890
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:07,040
laptop for days and days, maybe a week or two before I'd be like this battery life is

891
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:08,040
changing my life anyways.

892
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:09,040
Yeah.

893
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:11,960
I mean, I'm going to tell you it's the laptop.

894
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:16,520
I don't want to downplay cause it's actually very good, but it's so good that you keep

895
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:20,280
forgetting how good it is until you're not using it in terms of the battery life.

896
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:21,480
I mean, right.

897
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:22,600
You just don't care anymore.

898
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:24,480
I can't believe we're and people are rolling their eyes.

899
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:25,600
I can't believe they're talking about this.

900
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:26,720
I'll tell you what.

901
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:27,920
I'll tell you what.

902
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:31,960
This is the state of things right now because you can go by our email and just all of the

903
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:32,960
stuff that's going on.

904
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:34,680
This is what people are talking about.

905
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:36,400
Mike and I were having a conversation before the show.

906
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:39,640
We're like looking at the hoopla and we're like, well, we could talk some more about

907
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:40,640
Parler.

908
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:41,640
Yeah.

909
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:42,640
I'd rather not.

910
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:43,640
You know?

911
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:48,040
So, and this is, this really, it seems to be the topic that has captured a lot of the

912
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:49,960
people in the technical circles.

913
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:50,960
I thought it was over.

914
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:54,360
I thought the hype bubble had passed to be honest with you, but then people are now receiving

915
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:56,960
their devices and our audience has been emailing in their experiences.

916
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:58,360
I also, we got email.

917
00:42:58,360 --> 00:43:03,200
We got lots of emails from people on Intel systems and we had an email from an individual

918
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:07,560
who's on an X1 carbon and a Gallego pro, which I thought that was fascinating.

919
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:11,080
So I have an email back and forth with them asking them what it's like.

920
00:43:11,080 --> 00:43:15,400
So we got a lot of hardware in this week, but the M1 was the clear winner and I thought

921
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:20,280
what a cool opportunity for me to get to play with it, set it up for Ange and then just

922
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:21,280
pass it on.

923
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:23,600
Cause it's never, it's not the right machine for me anyways.

924
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:28,920
No, I mean, I will pour a little bit of a bucket of cold poop on these rumors though.

925
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:37,000
I find it hard to believe that they're going to release a Apple Silicon IMAX and a smaller,

926
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:43,840
presumably you know, more modest version of the Mac, I'm sorry, the Mac pro in the same

927
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:47,840
year that just, and, and a new Apple display that just seems like a lot.

928
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:51,880
Well, I think it's sort of like a rip the bandaid off kind of thing possibly.

929
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:52,880
You think so?

930
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:54,000
It's like we're going for it.

931
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:58,160
Well, and also this transition has been in the works for a long time.

932
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:02,240
So they may have had a, they may have already had a couple of year lead to build these systems,

933
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:07,440
you know, maybe that's possible because they haven't been doing a lot with the IMAX.

934
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:11,000
They've just kind of been revenue and revenue and they haven't really done anything.

935
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,040
They haven't really changed the screen.

936
00:44:12,040 --> 00:44:15,040
They haven't changed the big old chin, nothing.

937
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:18,440
And I've always thought they must be waiting until they make that arm transition and then

938
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:19,440
they're just going to roll it out.

939
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:21,920
And I wouldn't be surprised if that's exactly the case.

940
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:27,360
Well, it's going to be terrible when like the base or two step up IMAX trounce the IMAX

941
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:28,360
pros.

942
00:44:28,360 --> 00:44:30,720
I'm just, you know, maybe if it's a little personal for me, but.

943
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:33,560
Well, I think that's what's selling them is the performance.

944
00:44:33,560 --> 00:44:39,600
And you do wonder if it's already kind of getting to the point where it's pretty competitive,

945
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:42,240
what does it mean when it's even significantly more performant?

946
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:47,240
I don't know what it is in me that worries a little bit that it's, it's going to create

947
00:44:47,240 --> 00:44:51,700
this exodus of the Intel market, which is just as absolutely ridiculous because I'm

948
00:44:51,700 --> 00:44:57,040
only talking about one category of user, but I think that's the concern in a sense is like

949
00:44:57,040 --> 00:45:01,320
if what if they have something here that's so significant that it kind of just makes

950
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:03,640
everything else look too old and slow.

951
00:45:03,640 --> 00:45:05,920
Like I'm already feeling that a little bit.

952
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:10,240
Like I look at that X1 carbon, which I just got, and I'm like, uh, maybe I should sell

953
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:14,800
this thing because it doesn't really, I mean, it doesn't feel, it doesn't feel like it's

954
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:18,840
new and, and, and like the most modern thing I could be using as fast as possible.

955
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:20,440
And performance is a big deal for me.

956
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:23,280
It's something that's like, that's a serious thing for me.

957
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:27,440
It is, but I think there's a lot of the market who doesn't want to run Mac OS, right?

958
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:29,920
There's a lot of marketers, frankly on windows, right?

959
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:30,920
For various reasons.

960
00:45:30,920 --> 00:45:31,920
Yep.

961
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:32,920
Absolutely.

962
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:37,020
I mean, the next market shares obviously small, but I guess I don't see a lot of platform

963
00:45:37,020 --> 00:45:38,400
switchers because of this.

964
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:39,400
Maybe I'm wrong.

965
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:40,400
Right?

966
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:42,040
Well, your point about Mac OS is kind of a good one.

967
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:43,040
Yeah.

968
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:45,720
Not to talk about Parler, but to talk about Parler just a little bit.

969
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:47,960
It runs on excerpts cause that's all they could find.

970
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:48,960
Sorry.

971
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:50,200
That's all the rest has got.

972
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:55,880
I watched all of that go down and I thought to myself, this is probably why ultimately

973
00:45:55,880 --> 00:46:00,560
it's better to build my own infrastructure where I can self-host my own software and

974
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:06,060
my services when I can and use a platform that isn't tied to a single company, even

975
00:46:06,060 --> 00:46:08,620
for my computers as well.

976
00:46:08,620 --> 00:46:13,400
And I wonder if I will get to a point where it just simply doesn't matter how good of

977
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:18,280
a system they make as long as it says fundamentally flawed that it's Apple that controls it.

978
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:20,740
I'll never be fully comfortable with it.

979
00:46:20,740 --> 00:46:26,480
You know, no one tells me when or what updates I have to do with Linux.

980
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:31,960
Nobody tells me what software I can or can't run with an x86 machine and Linux.

981
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:36,820
And maybe that ultimately will end up being more important than having my applications

982
00:46:36,820 --> 00:46:38,320
load a little bit faster.

983
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:43,740
I'm not sure because there's like ideals and then there's the actual like practical day

984
00:46:43,740 --> 00:46:48,720
to day getting your work done pragmatic stuff about it, you know, like, but I have been

985
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:53,200
thinking more and more about how like that single source of control.

986
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:54,200
And it's also it's like the same.

987
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:55,480
It's the same issue with YouTube.

988
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:58,240
All these platforms where these big companies are controlling them.

989
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:01,840
It just takes them flipping a switch in San Francisco to shut your business down.

990
00:47:01,840 --> 00:47:08,360
Well, I mean, I would say the YouTube situation is far more severe.

991
00:47:08,360 --> 00:47:09,360
Okay.

992
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:14,560
I don't think, you know, if I write an app for Android or an electron app for a client

993
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:19,680
and Apple's annoyed, they're not going to, like, disable my MacBook Air remotely, right?

994
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:20,680
Right.

995
00:47:20,680 --> 00:47:21,680
That's crazy.

996
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:24,360
Worst case with Apple's, they're going to disable a developer account or something.

997
00:47:24,360 --> 00:47:25,360
Right.

998
00:47:25,360 --> 00:47:29,120
But even then, you know, I will I will we've bashed them a lot over the years.

999
00:47:29,120 --> 00:47:30,720
I will give them one thing.

1000
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:34,620
They have never messed with my developer account for the consulting business, even when they

1001
00:47:34,620 --> 00:47:37,760
threw us off the iTunes charts.

1002
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:42,960
Even they only like had an accident where they somehow missed the review or something.

1003
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:43,960
Right.

1004
00:47:43,960 --> 00:47:47,700
See, it's funny because you mentioned YouTube and like that just triggered me a little bit

1005
00:47:47,700 --> 00:47:52,540
because like that is the kind of platform control that scares the crap out of me.

1006
00:47:52,540 --> 00:47:59,160
But the content stuff, because I somehow have YouTube red or gold or.

1007
00:47:59,160 --> 00:48:00,160
Yeah.

1008
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:01,160
YouTube premium.

1009
00:48:01,160 --> 00:48:04,060
I had a Google Play music and I loved it and then they took it away from me.

1010
00:48:04,060 --> 00:48:10,360
So they gave me something else, so I don't I don't know, but it's kind of like how I

1011
00:48:10,360 --> 00:48:15,060
listen to all my music now, but they just kind of pick what I listen to.

1012
00:48:15,060 --> 00:48:19,120
And then you fall asleep listening to YouTube videos like I listen to like every once in

1013
00:48:19,120 --> 00:48:23,040
a while, listen to the Xamarin videos and I wake up and it's like some crazy right wing

1014
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:24,040
dude.

1015
00:48:24,040 --> 00:48:26,080
Like, what the hell?

1016
00:48:26,080 --> 00:48:29,640
You're always three videos away for some crazy rabbit hole conspiracy theory thing.

1017
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:34,400
It's usually like Jordan Peterson's the gateway drug and then you're just like, oh, yeah,

1018
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:38,240
yeah, you're always you fall asleep for a few hours and then all of a sudden your Facebook

1019
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:43,360
ads have dramatically changed three videos away from Jordan Peterson.

1020
00:48:43,360 --> 00:48:47,880
Like, I don't know, man, I just wanted to learn how to use this new XAML component.

1021
00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:51,640
So geez, there's a Python library I was curious about.

1022
00:48:51,640 --> 00:48:55,840
I mean, my whole thing with the M1 is I love it, it's great.

1023
00:48:55,840 --> 00:49:01,160
But if like System76 or Dell releases a Linux machine that can go toe to toe with this MacBook

1024
00:49:01,160 --> 00:49:04,600
Air, then great.

1025
00:49:04,600 --> 00:49:05,600
That's what I want.

1026
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:06,760
I think competition is good.

1027
00:49:06,760 --> 00:49:11,580
I think, yes, I will say Apple's ahead, right?

1028
00:49:11,580 --> 00:49:15,480
But isn't this an opportunity for the other vendors to kind of get their ass together?

1029
00:49:15,480 --> 00:49:19,320
Well, I don't want to go all our mess on you here, but I don't think they're ever going

1030
00:49:19,320 --> 00:49:21,680
to because I mean, look at look at this.

1031
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:22,680
Look at this.

1032
00:49:22,680 --> 00:49:27,720
We're 30 plus years into Apple being a thing and they're still laughing, everybody.

1033
00:49:27,720 --> 00:49:29,320
I mean, let's be honest about it.

1034
00:49:29,320 --> 00:49:33,600
They really are the build quality, the performance, the integration with the OS.

1035
00:49:33,600 --> 00:49:37,480
It's a dream for other vendors to have that kind of level of integration and control.

1036
00:49:37,480 --> 00:49:41,280
And we're not just talking about like control, we're talking about like some of these vendors

1037
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:47,000
who are manufacturing things are on the line like their survival depends on Apple.

1038
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:52,660
Apple has ultimate control of the supply chain relationships of everything from the chip

1039
00:49:52,660 --> 00:49:57,400
chips, from the glass that's on the screen to the bits, all of it.

1040
00:49:57,400 --> 00:49:59,400
And nobody's matching that.

1041
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:01,960
I don't think people are going to catch up.

1042
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:04,360
I think there will be equivalences.

1043
00:50:04,360 --> 00:50:07,480
There will be places where they maybe surpass them in some areas.

1044
00:50:07,480 --> 00:50:12,760
But as a whole complete product and package, it just Android hasn't managed to do it yet

1045
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:13,960
for the iPhone.

1046
00:50:13,960 --> 00:50:15,560
It just doesn't seem to be happening.

1047
00:50:15,560 --> 00:50:16,560
Hang on.

1048
00:50:16,560 --> 00:50:17,560
That's scrolling.

1049
00:50:17,560 --> 00:50:21,240
Project Butter has been going on for seven years.

1050
00:50:21,240 --> 00:50:22,240
It's great.

1051
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:23,720
That's a deep breath.

1052
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:26,000
That is only a long time.

1053
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:27,000
Listeners will get that.

1054
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:28,000
Yeah, man.

1055
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:29,740
And, you know, that just proves it doesn't.

1056
00:50:29,740 --> 00:50:33,760
And so but this is where I kind of channel my inner beard from RMS.

1057
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:36,660
And I think to myself, what if that doesn't matter?

1058
00:50:36,660 --> 00:50:41,920
What if what ultimately matters is the computer does what I tell it to do in every situation?

1059
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:42,920
But it doesn't.

1060
00:50:42,920 --> 00:50:43,920
But it doesn't.

1061
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:45,400
You're always going to be running some proprietary hardware.

1062
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:48,440
We're always running some proprietary drivers.

1063
00:50:48,440 --> 00:50:54,680
And frankly, even if they're not proprietary, there are 50 drunk Russians right now trying

1064
00:50:54,680 --> 00:50:59,200
to screw with the Mesa drivers or any open source driver you care to name.

1065
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:00,200
Yeah.

1066
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:05,560
So what you're saying is give in to our new dictator and long live Apple.

1067
00:51:05,560 --> 00:51:10,960
Now, what I'm saying is you have to adopt a level of cynicism that you have yet to attain.

1068
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:13,360
And which is weird because someone in the chat is mentioning unfilter.

1069
00:51:13,360 --> 00:51:14,680
I listen to unfilter.

1070
00:51:14,680 --> 00:51:15,680
You're a cynic.

1071
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:17,440
Yeah, I suppose sometimes I am.

1072
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:22,040
Well, you know, with unfilter, it's more like I just pop the popcorn and I just watch the

1073
00:51:22,040 --> 00:51:23,040
crazy show.

1074
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:24,720
And that's what unfilter really is.

1075
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:28,960
But with this, it's like, I guess I look at this and I think this is my ultimate thing.

1076
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:34,720
But just what if someday somebody decides, you know, those hippies who propose the free

1077
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:37,160
software should take over the world, they're dangerous.

1078
00:51:37,160 --> 00:51:39,840
And somebody says, we got to shut down that Linux Unplugged podcast.

1079
00:51:39,840 --> 00:51:40,840
It's dangerous.

1080
00:51:40,840 --> 00:51:45,320
I'm going to be really glad that I'm not like making my entire living off of YouTube or

1081
00:51:45,320 --> 00:51:48,720
some other platform that could just turn off the, you know, the access like that.

1082
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:52,480
And I think watching these last few weeks, there's something there.

1083
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:56,980
I don't know what it is yet, but there's something brewing in the back of my mind where I'm like,

1084
00:51:56,980 --> 00:51:58,560
something has shifted.

1085
00:51:58,560 --> 00:52:00,720
The way I look at this has shifted.

1086
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:04,360
And I bet for a lot of other people, it's shifted as well.

1087
00:52:04,360 --> 00:52:07,520
And I don't know if it's shifted for the better or not.

1088
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:08,520
Maybe.

1089
00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:11,060
But I feel like something isn't the same anymore.

1090
00:52:11,060 --> 00:52:16,840
Is it possible that you feel that these for profit corporations have way, way too much

1091
00:52:16,840 --> 00:52:17,840
power?

1092
00:52:17,840 --> 00:52:18,840
Yeah.

1093
00:52:18,840 --> 00:52:20,100
I mean, that is definitely the case.

1094
00:52:20,100 --> 00:52:21,100
That's totally true.

1095
00:52:21,100 --> 00:52:22,100
Right.

1096
00:52:22,100 --> 00:52:28,360
I mean, the fact that Apple could effectively put any podcast out of business tomorrow seems

1097
00:52:28,360 --> 00:52:29,680
like a lot to me.

1098
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:30,680
Seems bad.

1099
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:31,680
Right.

1100
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:32,680
Yeah.

1101
00:52:32,680 --> 00:52:35,320
Yeah, that does seem bad.

1102
00:52:35,320 --> 00:52:36,320
Yeah.

1103
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:40,840
I guess Decentral, I've just, and it seems impossible because it really is just perhaps

1104
00:52:40,840 --> 00:52:43,200
that we're too late stage in it, perhaps.

1105
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:46,800
And we're late stage, don't you think?

1106
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:48,820
We have our big companies.

1107
00:52:48,820 --> 00:52:49,820
We have our app.

1108
00:52:49,820 --> 00:52:51,120
Are you going to say rent seeking next?

1109
00:52:51,120 --> 00:52:52,120
Because I...

1110
00:52:52,120 --> 00:52:53,120
No.

1111
00:52:53,120 --> 00:52:57,280
No, I just mean we're too late stage in development of this particular technological cycle.

1112
00:52:57,280 --> 00:53:03,060
You have your big players, you have your platforms, you have your silos, and nothing stays the

1113
00:53:03,060 --> 00:53:04,060
same forever.

1114
00:53:04,060 --> 00:53:05,840
But it's going to be this way for a while.

1115
00:53:05,840 --> 00:53:08,360
This is the new reality for quite a while.

1116
00:53:08,360 --> 00:53:12,240
Yeah, I mean, I think the worst case scenario you could possibly think of is like maybe

1117
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:15,840
YouTube, but I'm thinking more of the app store.

1118
00:53:15,840 --> 00:53:21,880
As a developer, I kind of hate the fact that Apple controls it with such like an iron grip.

1119
00:53:21,880 --> 00:53:27,120
But as someone who does IT support for his family, that's why I make sure they get iPhones.

1120
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:28,120
Good point.

1121
00:53:28,120 --> 00:53:29,120
Same.

1122
00:53:29,120 --> 00:53:30,120
Yeah.

1123
00:53:30,120 --> 00:53:31,120
That describes me to a T.

1124
00:53:31,120 --> 00:53:32,480
So I don't know.

1125
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:35,760
So you're saying I want my cake and I want to eat it too is what you're saying.

1126
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:36,760
That's what you're saying?

1127
00:53:36,760 --> 00:53:37,760
Who doesn't?

1128
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:39,680
I have some reasonable expectations.

1129
00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:43,840
What I need to have are lowered expectations.

1130
00:53:43,840 --> 00:53:47,680
Well, you do run Fedora.

1131
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:50,080
I like Fedora.

1132
00:53:50,080 --> 00:53:52,160
I actually like Fedora quite a bit.

1133
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:54,400
I think it's a good little operating system.

1134
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:55,560
It's no Arch.

1135
00:53:55,560 --> 00:53:56,560
It's no Arch.

1136
00:53:56,560 --> 00:53:57,560
Oh, Jesus.

1137
00:53:57,560 --> 00:53:58,560
All right.

1138
00:53:58,560 --> 00:54:00,480
Let's wrap it up right there.

1139
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:02,120
I think that's probably it.

1140
00:54:02,120 --> 00:54:05,160
You know we're out of material if we're talking about Arch.

1141
00:54:05,160 --> 00:54:06,280
Go get Mike on Twitter.

1142
00:54:06,280 --> 00:54:07,280
He's at Dumanuku.

1143
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:08,680
His company is at the Mad Botter Inc.

1144
00:54:08,680 --> 00:54:10,600
Is there anything else you want to mention, Mr. Dumanuku?

1145
00:54:10,600 --> 00:54:11,600
Yeah.

1146
00:54:11,600 --> 00:54:12,600
Don't forget the Coder QA.

1147
00:54:12,600 --> 00:54:13,600
Subscribe.

1148
00:54:13,600 --> 00:54:15,640
I think it's $10 a month.

1149
00:54:15,640 --> 00:54:16,640
Cheaper than that.

1150
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:17,640
It's even cheaper than that.

1151
00:54:17,640 --> 00:54:18,640
Even cheaper.

1152
00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:21,880
CoderQA.co and you get a limited ad feed as well.

1153
00:54:21,880 --> 00:54:23,160
You get the Coderly report.

1154
00:54:23,160 --> 00:54:24,160
That's out.

1155
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:25,160
It's awesome.

1156
00:54:25,160 --> 00:54:27,080
So go get that.

1157
00:54:27,080 --> 00:54:29,560
If you haven't got it, I don't know what your problem is.

1158
00:54:29,560 --> 00:54:30,560
CoderQA.co.

1159
00:54:30,560 --> 00:54:32,360
It's cheaper than Disney Plus.

1160
00:54:32,360 --> 00:54:34,140
They spent all their money on M1 Macs.

1161
00:54:34,140 --> 00:54:35,200
That's their problem.

1162
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:36,200
That's what it is.

1163
00:54:36,200 --> 00:54:37,200
Yeah, that's what it is.

1164
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:38,200
Yeah.

1165
00:54:38,200 --> 00:54:39,200

The network is at Jupiter Signal on the Twitter.

1167
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:43,840
Twitter, which is a horrible platform you shouldn't use.

1168
00:54:43,840 --> 00:54:47,440
And the show is at Coder Radio Show, but I wouldn't follow it because it's Twitter.
