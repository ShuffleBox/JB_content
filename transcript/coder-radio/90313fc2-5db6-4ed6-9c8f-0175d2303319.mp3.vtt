This is KOTORadio, episode 329, for October 8th, 2018.

00:30.000 --> 00:40.000
Hi, everyone, and welcome to KOTORadio, Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show, taking a pragmatic look at the art and the business of software development and its related technologies.

00:40.000 --> 00:49.000
Recorded here live in the beautiful Pacific Northwest, my name is Chris, and joining us every single week is the man on a mission.

00:49.000 --> 00:55.000
That wizard crawling in and out of airplanes, sometimes not so successfully, it's our host, Mr. Dominic.

00:55.000 --> 00:57.000
Hello, Mike.

00:57.000 --> 01:02.000
Hello, Chris, and let me tell you a story about ladders into fighter plane cockpits.

01:02.000 --> 01:05.000
Doesn't sound like it's your thing, from what I hear.

01:05.000 --> 01:07.000
So, I've done it many times.

01:07.000 --> 01:11.000
You have? That's strange.

01:11.000 --> 01:15.000
Yes, it's not that strange. Come on, man, griffinradar.com, buddy, come on.

01:15.000 --> 01:18.000
Yeah, no, I know. It's just, it's unusual for most people.

01:18.000 --> 01:27.000
But when someone calls your name and you have a tablet in one hand, you should wave with the hand you have the tablet in, not the hand you're holding on to the ladder with.

01:27.000 --> 01:30.000
Oh, yeah, that's a good, that's a good pro tip.

01:30.000 --> 01:34.000
That's a pro tip. That's a, yeah, so.

01:34.000 --> 01:38.000
So you fell out, you fell out of an airplane cockpit before the show, is what you're telling me?

01:38.000 --> 01:40.000
That's exactly what happened, actually.

01:40.000 --> 01:42.000
And then on the way home, after.

01:42.000 --> 01:49.000
I got stuck in traffic. My back is killing me, literally right now. My friend Samuel Adams is helping me out, but my back.

01:49.000 --> 01:52.000
I might have a brief trip to the hospital after the show.

01:52.000 --> 01:57.000
You know, I can tell you something. It only gets worse as you get older.

01:57.000 --> 02:01.000
I've learned, you know, because right now, like, I'm healing pretty good because I'm in my 30s.

02:01.000 --> 02:03.000
And you're like, yeah, you're really lucky you're in your 30s.

02:03.000 --> 02:06.000
I'm like, yeah, OK, what else do I need to get out of my 30s too?

02:06.000 --> 02:08.000
So it only gets worse from here, they tell me.

02:08.000 --> 02:12.000
So this is so when we started the show, I was a men's medium. I just want to say this, right?

02:12.000 --> 02:15.000
Yeah, now I'm in Excel. Yeah.

02:15.000 --> 02:24.000
And I feel like my ability we've been doing the show since 2012 in the last six years to take physical damage has like diminished greatly.

02:24.000 --> 02:32.000
Right. Yeah. Like a seven foot fall, granted landing flat on your back would not have hurt as much as maybe I'm wrong.

02:32.000 --> 02:35.000
Like, you know, you have rose colored glasses and everything about how it used to be.

02:35.000 --> 02:39.000
But now you're you're heavier. So you you you fall faster. I don't know.

02:39.000 --> 02:43.000
Well, and your back is already torqued because like I carry carrying more.

02:43.000 --> 02:47.000
I'm like 18 months pregnant. Right. Like the beer belly of Satan over here.

02:47.000 --> 02:52.000
You know, I I was I was on I was on track.

02:52.000 --> 02:55.000
I was down like twenty five pounds when this is not what today's topic is about.

02:55.000 --> 02:58.000
We have a great show lined up, but just what it should be.

02:58.000 --> 03:00.000
This is what I feel like this is a problem. It is.

03:00.000 --> 03:10.000
Many of our listeners have you know what it is, is my ability to maintain a healthy weight and eating style really is greatly diminished when I'm stressed out.

03:10.000 --> 03:14.000
And I know this is like the most obvious statement that people hear all the time.

03:14.000 --> 03:21.000
But it took me a while to realize that I I really saw the difference as I took on a lot more stress over the last few years.

03:21.000 --> 03:27.000
I saw I just saw a huge increase in my weight again and I finally worked it down to a good healthy level.

03:27.000 --> 03:36.000
And it really is stress. It changes the chemical makeup of your brain and your body and it just packs on the weight.

03:36.000 --> 03:44.000
And it's it's one of those things where you really you can try to have self-control, but that's almost a little diminished when you're under a lot of pressure and stress.

03:44.000 --> 03:49.000
And you're already oh sure you're already using your self-control for other things. And so it's just yeah.

03:49.000 --> 03:55.000
Well, you know, then the problem is, I mean, I don't know if I mentioned this last week or rather Friday on the show.

03:55.000 --> 04:05.000
Next, not next week, the following week, I'm I'm in one week flying to California, then to Texas, back home for a few days to do the show.

04:05.000 --> 04:10.000
And then I'm flying to New Jersey again. So when you're traveling like this, I mean, you know this better than anybody, Chris.

04:10.000 --> 04:15.000
When you're traveling, you're not sitting down alone at like a nice restaurant getting like a kale salad.

04:15.000 --> 04:19.000
Right. What are you eating, hamburgers, hot dogs? Anything you can, especially depending on time.

04:19.000 --> 04:27.000
That's cheap, especially if you know. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, yeah, for sure. Yeah. Because that can be such a massive expense because when you're at home during that same time period,

04:27.000 --> 04:34.000
you're grocery shopping and you're getting a lot more for your dollar. Generally, when you're traveling, you're everything's eating out.

04:34.000 --> 04:38.000
All my and my wife still grocery shopping for her herself. Right.

04:38.000 --> 04:49.000
My son. So it's not like that bill went away. It's this is all in addition to. Yeah. So, yeah, I think, you know what? I blame Southwest Airlines for this.

04:49.000 --> 04:55.000
It's even worse if you travel by road because you're really eating what's at gas stations in the RV.

04:55.000 --> 05:00.000
We can make. Oh, yeah. But yeah. Yeah. Gas station. Yeah. So that's not what we're here to talk about.

05:00.000 --> 05:08.000
Us being old men who are slowly killing ourselves. Right. Right. No, we are your canary in the coal mines out there for if you're going in this direction. Stop now.

05:08.000 --> 05:13.000
All right. So we've got a couple of bits of feedback and then we'll get into the events of the week.

05:13.000 --> 05:22.000
But J.K. eighty nine wrote and he said regarding Macbook, Mike's MacBook Pro mishap. That's pretty clever, actually.

05:22.000 --> 05:26.000
That's a good that's a good alliteration. I got to give it up to that. That's not that. Yeah, that's yeah.

05:26.000 --> 05:32.000
This is why I make sure to do regular backups, one via time machine and one via carbon copy cloner.

05:32.000 --> 05:38.000
If something goes awry, I can get back up and running with the desired configuration relatively quickly.

05:38.000 --> 05:43.000
So J.K. is the one thing the carbon copy cloner tip is a great one.

05:43.000 --> 05:54.000
If you are on a Mac workflow, you got to you got to spend the money and get carbon copy cloner because it will take an exact duplicate copy of your Mac hard drive.

05:54.000 --> 06:03.000
And it can save it to an image or an external hard drive. In the case of an external hard drive, I suppose, depending on the Mac, I haven't I don't have any recent experience with this.

06:03.000 --> 06:15.000
But in the case in the past with an external hard drive, you could actually then boot the Mac from that external hard drive and continue to work right from when you last took that snapshot.

06:15.000 --> 06:21.000
And that is when you think about I'm under a deadline, even if it's a little bit slower to, say, run off a USB three drive.

06:21.000 --> 06:26.000
The fact that you have all of the applications completely exactly the way they were on the failed drive.

06:26.000 --> 06:31.000
It's totally worth eating a little bit of performance until you can get things back up and running.

06:31.000 --> 06:36.000
It's essentially like DD on Linux or Clonzilla on the Linux side.

06:36.000 --> 06:42.000
But carbon copy cloner, I actually believe works at the file system level and it's super useful.

06:42.000 --> 06:46.000
I think it's only like 40 bucks. It's totally worth it. It's totally worth it for that job.

06:46.000 --> 06:53.000
So if you keep up with the Mac workflow, I'd say get yourself an external drive and a copy of carbon copy cloner.

06:53.000 --> 06:58.000
Then you can at least boot off that from any other Mac, too. That's the other thing, at least in the past.

06:58.000 --> 07:03.000
No, yeah, that works. I mean, real time update. Mac and cloud has been fabulous.

07:03.000 --> 07:09.000
Really? Really? Yeah. You know what? I am in Windows or elementary OS and Windows.

07:09.000 --> 07:14.000
I'm running one mission critical application, Chris.

07:14.000 --> 07:18.000
Visual Studio. Nope. Magic the gathering arena dot.

07:18.000 --> 07:25.000
Of course. Of course. Right. Of course. Yeah. No, but seriously, this just having one little Mac server in the cloud.

07:25.000 --> 07:30.000
Now, this solution is that the writer's suggestion is probably better.

07:30.000 --> 07:33.000
But now that I've already set everything up in the cloud, it's actually great.

07:33.000 --> 07:36.000
Like, I can take my Gallego on a trip if I don't manage to pour beer into it.

07:36.000 --> 07:41.000
What is the remote log in mechanism? Is it a Web page? Is it an app?

07:41.000 --> 07:45.000
It is a Web page, but it's one of those you can tell.

07:45.000 --> 07:52.000
It's like they must have written some gooey on top of basically remote host or whatever Mac OS calls that.

07:52.000 --> 07:57.000
Yeah. Although one scary thing is Mac Apple is now canceling Mac OS server.

07:57.000 --> 08:03.000
Right. Essentially. Yeah. So, yeah, like, I don't know how long this is going to last.

08:03.000 --> 08:06.000
No, they'll leave the remote VNC stuff in there. Not only is it a pretty good thing.

08:06.000 --> 08:14.000
So, yeah, not only is it a decent implementation, but they're still going to make their classroom suite management tools, which rely heavily on that.

08:14.000 --> 08:18.000
That's what I thought. Right. The education stuff. But this is actually working just fine.

08:18.000 --> 08:26.000
I mean, I have been working mostly in elementary or pop, depending on where I am and doing my Magic the Gathering needs on Windows.

08:26.000 --> 08:32.000
That's fascinating. Now, do they have bandwidth limits and stuff like that? Could you suck down a ton of data or?

08:32.000 --> 08:39.000
So, they have a specialty plan for folks using a Visual Studio App Center that they charge you a flat fee.

08:39.000 --> 08:45.000
But the only things you can do are those things that you would need to do for FIIA's App Center.

08:45.000 --> 08:52.000
But all I need to do is code signing. Right. So, it's not like I'm like wanting to run Mac OS as a remote remote host.

08:52.000 --> 08:56.000
Yeah. I just want to code sign builds and send them to people.

08:56.000 --> 09:02.000
Yeah. It doesn't really specify looking at the it doesn't really specify looking at the specs.

09:02.000 --> 09:06.000
It just says you can get a hundred megabit port speed upgradable to one gigabit.

09:06.000 --> 09:10.000
But doesn't say anything about the total like transfer amount or anything like that.

09:10.000 --> 09:14.000
Curious. Curious. Well, there you go. It's cool. I'm glad that's working out for you.

09:14.000 --> 09:18.000
That's pretty nice. That's got to make travel a little simpler if it continues to work. That's good.

09:18.000 --> 09:22.000
All right. So, one more bit of feedback. This one comes in from Wasabi Burger and this one's for me.

09:22.000 --> 09:33.000
He says Chris last there is a Firefox extension called text contrast for dark themes that fixes the issue of having black fonts with dark backgrounds in dark themes.

09:33.000 --> 09:38.000
Thank you, Wasabi Burger. I didn't even really think anybody would ever catch the fact that I complained about that.

09:38.000 --> 09:47.000
It's an issue in Firefox. If you're using dark theme mode and when you go to use a text field box, it's too dark and the text is like gray on black.

09:47.000 --> 09:55.000
You can use this text contrast theme and it will fix that issue for you. It's just one of those small little niggly things I didn't expect anybody to have a solution for.

09:55.000 --> 10:04.000
And then Wasabi Burger wrote in and nailed it. I'll have a link to that if you want that for Firefox at coder.show slash 329.

10:04.000 --> 10:10.000
All right. Now, moving forward with sort of the follow up and perhaps starting a new thread in the show for a little bit.

10:10.000 --> 10:15.000
You were tweeting about the Azure Sphere dev kit, which I did a little deep dive over the weekend on.

10:15.000 --> 10:23.000
And you say you're thinking about evaluating it for a project, trying to get a sense of what the actual developer experience is and how dependent it is on Azure right now.

10:23.000 --> 10:28.000
So all really good questions. Really quick recap here.

10:28.000 --> 10:34.000
The Azure Sphere devices are the hardware devices that Microsoft announced back in March.

10:34.000 --> 10:39.000
I believe it was around March that are devices that run their own custom Linux OS.

10:39.000 --> 10:47.000
That's the Azure Sphere OS devices. And the reason why it's called Azure Sphere is because it's one part hardware.

10:47.000 --> 10:55.000
Which they call the secured MCU, one part OS, which is the Azure Sphere OS, the Linux OS and the one part cloud security.

10:55.000 --> 11:00.000
So they are very much tied in with a cloud management infrastructure design in mind.

11:00.000 --> 11:05.000
And that's really the fundamental way of how you deploy and develop these machines.

11:05.000 --> 11:11.000
You write your applications and its logic in C using APIs that are provided by the Azure Sphere SDK.

11:11.000 --> 11:14.000
This is compiled into an application binary using GCC.

11:14.000 --> 11:22.000
And as part of the build process, tools that are part of Azure Sphere SDK are used to generate a signed image or a dot image package.

11:22.000 --> 11:28.000
They will then be deployed to the development board either through Azure Sphere or there is a way to do it over USB.

11:28.000 --> 11:32.000
But I think for now it's not very clear in their documentation.

11:32.000 --> 11:38.000
You have to deploy through Azure Sphere security service over the air, deployment service.

11:38.000 --> 11:42.000
So I got some clarification on that bit already actually.

11:42.000 --> 11:43.000
Okay, good.

11:43.000 --> 11:49.000
So my friendly Microsoft rep down here in Tampa, it is completely possible right now to deploy via USB.

11:49.000 --> 11:54.000
Yeah, right. But I couldn't see anything in their docs talk about Azure Sphere.

11:54.000 --> 11:58.000
So I did it on a TI board, which is not officially supported.

11:58.000 --> 12:06.000
But because I have a closet full of TI boards for something else that we won't talk about, it's a tremendous pain in the ass.

12:06.000 --> 12:10.000
So first of all, when I hear C and I hear GCC.

12:10.000 --> 12:11.000
Yeah, what?

12:11.000 --> 12:15.000
And then someone tells me Windows 10 Visual Studio.

12:15.000 --> 12:18.000
I told the bartender to stop serving me.

12:18.000 --> 12:26.000
Well, that's the – you're bearing the lead right there is the fact that this thing is dependent on a Visual Studio and Windows 10 is a bit of a downer right now.

12:26.000 --> 12:29.000
I don't know if that's technically true.

12:29.000 --> 12:33.000
I think you could probably use this thing on any OS if you really were.

12:33.000 --> 12:34.000
So they did.

12:34.000 --> 12:39.000
But through the grapevine, unofficially, I've heard it is not a technical limitation.

12:39.000 --> 12:41.000
It's a they needed to ship limitation.

12:41.000 --> 12:45.000
And I think there's a driver for Windows 10 involved and all of that.

12:45.000 --> 12:54.000
Because if you think about the tool chain here, NCC, GCC and, you know, boards that run Linux.

12:54.000 --> 13:01.000
Well, Mac for all of our, you know, fancy coffee drinking Mac users and all of our Linux hippies.

13:01.000 --> 13:03.000
There's no reason you can't do that.

13:03.000 --> 13:10.000
Right. And here's something else they put in the in the like getting to understand Azure Sphere OS dev kit boards towards the bottom of the docks.

13:10.000 --> 13:17.000
They say, while the process of connecting an Azure Sphere device to the Azure IoT hub is simple.

13:17.000 --> 13:25.000
You could also connect to other Web services running online or on premises using a library such as curl.

13:25.000 --> 13:30.000
So you could just, you know, you could have this thing of just curl URLs and pull things down if you really want to.

13:30.000 --> 13:35.000
So that's you could at least build something with with that.

13:35.000 --> 13:38.000
So this is a weird situation.

13:38.000 --> 13:42.000
And, you know, when I've been talking to my rep.

13:42.000 --> 13:47.000
It is both very, very open and very, very pro Microsoft.

13:47.000 --> 13:56.000
And it seems like the strategy they've taken is the path of least resistance or the path of least work is you just go all in on Azure services from Microsoft.

13:56.000 --> 14:04.000
But you can totally do your own service hosted on DO or AWS or whatever the hell you want.

14:04.000 --> 14:08.000
You just have to implement these libraries and it works.

14:08.000 --> 14:13.000
So this is I don't even you know, Chris, you remember the open core phase of life a couple of years ago.

14:13.000 --> 14:20.000
Oh, yeah. Yeah. I mean, there's still some there's still some of that going around, but it's it's definitely not in vogue anymore.

14:20.000 --> 14:25.000
Right. That's this is not even open cord. This is like kind of open source.

14:25.000 --> 14:32.000
But if you want an easy way out, use our proprietary Azure technology and it just works well.

14:32.000 --> 14:36.000
And I have to say, go ahead. No, I want to hear what you have to say.

14:36.000 --> 14:44.000
I've done it both ways. I mean, I have one of these dev kits. I'm thinking of buying a few more, a few hundred more.

14:44.000 --> 14:52.000
And it's it's easier if you just use their tooling. I don't even know what to say.

14:52.000 --> 15:01.000
But there is, you know, from writing some code for this, you know, the C code you're writing, Chris, is just I mean, this is ANSI C, right?

15:01.000 --> 15:10.000
This is there's no that I can see so far. Proprietary extensions, the GCC you're running is ANSI GCC.

15:10.000 --> 15:14.000
There is no it's, you know, it's not like the MSC plus plus compiler. That's what I'm getting at.

15:14.000 --> 15:21.000
Yep. I follow you. I don't know why the S code on Linux or Mac can't do this.

15:21.000 --> 15:27.000
Yeah. And I could. You totally could. In fact, they will say you could text editor.

15:27.000 --> 15:33.000
Right. I wrote most of the code for my little demo on this code on elementary.

15:33.000 --> 15:49.000
I'm so sorry, Pop OS. And I mean, it was fine. But when I wanted to flash it to the board, I had to, you know, reboot into Windows, open VS 2017 and, you know, deploy, deploy.

15:49.000 --> 16:00.000
That may be a failing on my part where I just haven't taken the time to say, well, how does this actually work? Because I am positive somebody is going to be able to write a little app or a script that can do it from Linux.

16:00.000 --> 16:09.000
But. I don't know what to think about this, because in a lot of ways. This seems pretty pro Linux.

16:09.000 --> 16:16.000
I mean, I yeah, you have to use VS code for I'm sorry, Visual Studio proper for the easy way out today.

16:16.000 --> 16:27.000
But we're talking NCC, the GCC compiler, Linux kernel on the device. In fact, I would have preferred dot net core to be honest with you.

16:27.000 --> 16:35.000
And there's a good chance that these Azure services that are the cloud aspect of this are also running on Linux.

16:35.000 --> 16:39.000
So this is I like to go back in time if we could for a second.

16:39.000 --> 16:52.000
The hell out of here. If we go to last week's episode or last last episode, I was I was getting pretty hyped about how Microsoft could really run away with the whole.

16:52.000 --> 17:04.000
Boy, I need a good term for it, like the like the new Microsoft development ecosystem where it's you think about think about the development process for a shop that decides they want to use the Azure sphere SDK.

17:04.000 --> 17:13.000
So they start with a project that they probably are potentially creating in Visual Studio or Visual Studio code.

17:13.000 --> 17:18.000
They then host that project on GitHub, which is owned by Microsoft.

17:18.000 --> 17:23.000
They then integrate with the Azure studios, perhaps the App Center and other things.

17:23.000 --> 17:29.000
Which then integrates with Azure sphere, which then starts deploying to these hardware devices.

17:29.000 --> 17:34.000
So from the first line of code to the publishing.

17:34.000 --> 17:47.000
The checking the QA issue tracking deployment to the cloud deployment to the edge device, it all happens in the Microsoft ecosystem.

17:47.000 --> 17:59.000
And you have to imagine that if this is the first preview board, this is a developer preview board, which they announced in March and are shipping now in October.

17:59.000 --> 18:06.000
That's a pretty short time window for a company the size of Microsoft launching a new product category like this.

18:06.000 --> 18:12.000
It's almost unbelievable. Actually, it's a hardware and software combination that is across multiple projects.

18:12.000 --> 18:17.000
There's obviously the Azure end of it. There's the Visual Studio end of it. There's a product marketing end of it.

18:17.000 --> 18:26.000
There's the hardware shipping end of it. There's the working with the third party shipment fulfillment centers that are the traditional outlets for devices like this that is outside their typical domain.

18:26.000 --> 18:33.000
There's a lot happening here with this very fast for them. And this is the beginning. This is the preview board.

18:33.000 --> 18:39.000
So you could see a future where they have multiple boards to choose from for different kinds of use cases.

18:39.000 --> 18:48.000
And they have almost a Amazon skill like interface to be able to click and drag and build the functionality. You need these things to do right.

18:48.000 --> 18:54.000
Well, you know what? I hate to say this word because I just I just don't want to read the email.

18:54.000 --> 19:01.000
But theoretically, if C is the language for Azure spheres, there is no reason you could you couldn't have.

19:01.000 --> 19:06.000
Chris, should I say it? I don't want to give it to them. No, I don't know the monsters. You got to do it.

19:06.000 --> 19:11.000
There's absolutely no reason that you couldn't write this crap in Rust.

19:11.000 --> 19:18.000
I almost I almost didn't want to talk about this today because I feel like, oh, jeez, my Microsoft rep listens to the show.

19:18.000 --> 19:26.000
He's not going to like this. But I remember Microsoft from the late 90s, as I'm sure you do.

19:26.000 --> 19:30.000
I can't believe this is just this open, right?

19:30.000 --> 19:38.000
This Linux see this. It seems I don't know. I feel I'm waiting for the trap to be sprung, I guess.

19:38.000 --> 19:42.000
I think a lot of people from from the good old days feel that way.

19:42.000 --> 19:48.000
I you know, I really had it. I had a deep hatred for Microsoft in the 90s.

19:48.000 --> 19:56.000
I know it was the injustice of my young time when I was when I was younger.

19:56.000 --> 20:03.000
You know, high school and, you know, five, 10 years after that, I don't know, for a while until until about five years ago.

20:03.000 --> 20:11.000
Now I started to fade. But I was I was in a position several times where I watched Microsoft abuse their position of power.

20:11.000 --> 20:18.000
And it enraged me. And so I got I was I was the kind of guy where like if somebody was somewhat savvy,

20:18.000 --> 20:22.000
like a sophisticated consumer and they were choosing to buy Windows, I would judge them.

20:22.000 --> 20:26.000
Like, how could you? You should know better. Get a Mac, get Linux.

20:26.000 --> 20:30.000
And I was I was a proponent of BOS. I was a proponent of Linux.

20:30.000 --> 20:38.000
I anything that wasn't Windows, because I had watched them come in and play hardball in a school district and try to.

20:38.000 --> 20:46.000
And I've told the story before on the show. Try to threaten them with a massive financial burden if they didn't remove all the Linux systems from the network.

20:46.000 --> 20:53.000
They wanted every Linux box off the network immediately or a bunch of software that they had donated and future licensing,

20:53.000 --> 21:02.000
which was a huge point of pride for the school district and access to the NT certification program where the certifications were paid for the students by Microsoft.

21:02.000 --> 21:07.000
So the students could go in and take the NT certification exams for free.

21:07.000 --> 21:11.000
So our school was producing certified NT administrators out of high school.

21:11.000 --> 21:17.000
And one of the youngest employees ever hired by Microsoft was a student out of my class.

21:17.000 --> 21:20.000
And so this was a huge point of pride for the school district.

21:20.000 --> 21:25.000
And when Microsoft discovered that we were using Linux to solve some network routing issues,

21:25.000 --> 21:30.000
they lost it and they began to threaten us with bills that quickly exceeded three hundred thousand dollars.

21:30.000 --> 21:36.000
And for a school district that was trash cap, cash strapped, that was devastating.

21:36.000 --> 21:43.000
And I watched them abuse their position of monopoly to force OEMs not to deploy Linux when the hype was super strong.

21:43.000 --> 21:46.000
And I hated them for that. I hated them.

21:46.000 --> 21:52.000
Well, you know, NT server was awful. So, I mean, they deserve that.

21:52.000 --> 21:56.000
And what do you think Windows 10 is based off, my friend?

21:56.000 --> 22:00.000
You know what? It runs Magic the Gathering just fine.

22:00.000 --> 22:06.000
And you know what? Diablo 2 actually runs in wine just fine.

22:06.000 --> 22:09.000
It's so nice when you just want all the Blizzard games to run.

22:09.000 --> 22:16.000
Anyways, my point is I was deeply angry at them for a very long time and it sort of became one of my causes.

22:16.000 --> 22:21.000
Like, this was the cause of my time. This is what I picked up arms for and fought against.

22:21.000 --> 22:28.000
And now I stand on the mic more frequently than I would like and probably than the audience would like.

22:28.000 --> 22:32.000
And I praise and I'm impressed by what Microsoft is doing.

22:32.000 --> 22:37.000
And the thing is, I have conversations with people inside the company that I'm not allowed to share because they're friends and family.

22:37.000 --> 22:42.000
And it's a legitimate shift. It's not just talk. Like, it's really happening.

22:42.000 --> 22:48.000
And I've been inside Microsoft and interviewed people on the record and then seen it firsthand.

22:48.000 --> 22:54.000
And it's just, it is incredible to see it. And it's here that you see it the best, the most.

22:54.000 --> 23:02.000
Like, the arm of Microsoft that's launching a game streaming service called Project X or the arm that's responsible for Office 365.

23:02.000 --> 23:06.000
I don't have, they're fine. Not as big of a fan of it.

23:06.000 --> 23:13.000
But to watch the work they're doing in the development community and in the open source community in particular has really shifted me.

23:13.000 --> 23:15.000
And now I'm impressed.

23:15.000 --> 23:22.000
Yeah. So if I can take this in a different direction or the same direction really.

23:22.000 --> 23:28.000
A lot of tech in the chat asked me why I've become more of an, basically an open source.

23:28.000 --> 23:31.000
I won't say hippie because I don't think I'm at the hippie level, but.

23:31.000 --> 23:37.000
You seem to take it from a practical pragmatist. Like this is, I've arrived here, I've tried other things.

23:37.000 --> 23:43.000
Yeah, there's a non practical perspective. I have a young son, as you long time listeners will know.

23:43.000 --> 23:45.000
Chris certainly knows.

23:45.000 --> 23:49.000
And, you know, I am slightly younger than you.

23:49.000 --> 23:58.000
But one thing that was very helpful to me in learning how to work computers was, you know, reading the old Java guys, right?

23:58.000 --> 24:05.000
Or rather the C++ guys. Reading the old, you know, remember Shareware?

24:05.000 --> 24:07.000
I mean, I was a teenager when that came out.

24:07.000 --> 24:10.000
Being able to tinker with the operating system.

24:10.000 --> 24:11.000
Tinker.

24:11.000 --> 24:12.000
Even old Macs.

24:12.000 --> 24:15.000
Or even the game. Even a video game. I remember tinkering with the old Shareware.

24:15.000 --> 24:16.000
Sure.

24:16.000 --> 24:17.000
Right?

24:17.000 --> 24:22.000
Figuring out how to get it to do certain things or making multiple copies of it even.

24:22.000 --> 24:26.000
I mean, if you remember, my degree for folks who have been listening a long time.

24:26.000 --> 24:30.000
I do have a bachelor's degree, but it's in medieval literature.

24:30.000 --> 24:35.000
So if you need someone to write a poem for your wife, I'm your man.

24:35.000 --> 24:41.000
But, like, I learned computer programming by hacking Diablo.

24:41.000 --> 24:45.000
Right? And hacking in the old way, not the new, you know, go to jail way.

24:45.000 --> 24:48.000
Like, you know, changing the colors, doing whatever.

24:48.000 --> 24:54.000
I learned by breaking my operating system and then trying to fix it before my parents got me in trouble for breaking the computer.

24:54.000 --> 24:58.000
Oh, I opened up one of my mother's computers because I wanted RAM.

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
So I harvest it.

25:00.000 --> 25:03.000
I'm not saying this in case she actually listens one day.

25:03.000 --> 25:07.000
I have a slight recollection of doing the same and thinking they'll never notice.

25:07.000 --> 25:10.000
They'll never know.

25:10.000 --> 25:13.000
Anything from their 64K, right?

25:13.000 --> 25:17.000
It was it was it was it was an accessibility in a different kind of way.

25:17.000 --> 25:25.000
Like modern devices are easier to use and accessible to way more people and have ubiquitous connectivity for the most part.

25:25.000 --> 25:30.000
But yet at the same time, you can't learn by tinkering.

25:30.000 --> 25:38.000
You can learn by navigating. You can become an expert of the systems and the UI, but you can't become an expert like at a deeper level.

25:38.000 --> 25:46.000
So as I smashed my headphones into the microphone, which I'm sure our wonderful producer will take out,

25:46.000 --> 25:53.000
I look to my left and I have a board on my desk that is a controller for sunlight panels for solar panels.

25:53.000 --> 25:58.000
I tech. This is straight out of the 1980s.

25:58.000 --> 26:02.000
Seriously, this is. You're laughing, I know.

26:02.000 --> 26:05.000
No, I picture it. It's just some it's some basic stuff.

26:05.000 --> 26:11.000
It's just a blue board, right? I have interviewed three kids this week.

26:11.000 --> 26:15.000
And I asked them a simple question. Are you ready for my question, Chris?

26:15.000 --> 26:20.000
Can you guess my question? What is the one basic software development question I might have asked?

26:20.000 --> 26:24.000
You mean besides like like a test, like you're having them look at this board?

26:24.000 --> 26:28.000
No, it's not FizzBuzz. Yeah, I had them take a look at not this board.

26:28.000 --> 26:33.000
I didn't take a look at a TI board that we're using for one of our upcoming products.

26:33.000 --> 26:39.000
Inappropriate. Hmm. I see. And you having them look at this board was the first thing you asked them.

26:39.000 --> 26:43.000
I would ask them, how do you connect this to the computer? That would be my first question.

26:43.000 --> 26:49.000
Bing, Bing, Bing. You got it in one. Please tell me the right guy.

26:49.000 --> 26:53.000
Please tell me. Please tell me. They say, how about what?

26:53.000 --> 26:57.000
I could tell you what this said, but you're going to be very sad. OK, OK, all right.

26:57.000 --> 27:00.000
Well, then I'll OK, I'll change my answer and I'll say you take a guess.

27:00.000 --> 27:05.000
You connect to it over Bluetooth. Oh, it's even worse. They said Wi-Fi.

27:05.000 --> 27:08.000
Really? Although I think Wi-Fi is worse.

27:08.000 --> 27:11.000
Yeah, like the idea of just like, you know, TCP ports, right?

27:11.000 --> 27:16.000
Just like having simple ports and like, you know, yeah, it's all set up ready to go.

27:16.000 --> 27:22.000
It's just got a whole OS on there already connected to the Wi-Fi network listening for your connection.

27:22.000 --> 27:26.000
Yeah, it was it was like pulling teeth.

27:26.000 --> 27:32.000
But yeah, I feel like and you know, I know I often complain about young kids I interview.

27:32.000 --> 27:37.000
I don't think it's their fault. I think it's because, you know, when I buy a laptop, when I used to buy stuff,

27:37.000 --> 27:41.000
I never bought Apple when I was young, but I was poor.

27:41.000 --> 27:47.000
We used to buy like, you know, the gateways. We used to go to Best Buy at six in the morning and stand in line to get the gateway computer for me.

27:47.000 --> 27:52.000
But you could open that thing up and change the parts, right? That was a completely open system.

27:52.000 --> 27:57.000
Yeah, same with Compaq, same with HP at the time.

27:57.000 --> 28:01.000
Now you buy a computer, everything's glued on.

28:01.000 --> 28:06.000
How are how are young folks supposed and this is not the topic for today, but I just screwed up Chris's show.

28:06.000 --> 28:10.000
How are folks supposed to learn how this stuff actually works?

28:10.000 --> 28:18.000
You know, and I was trained as a Java developer, but I have to tell you, knowing how flip flops work and, you know,

28:18.000 --> 28:24.000
just basic like concurrency and memory management is super frankly mandatory.

28:24.000 --> 28:31.000
And if you don't I don't know if you've never like opened up a computer like I will give Dell some credit here and we have no sponsors anymore.

28:31.000 --> 28:34.000
So I can say whatever the hell I want. Right, Chris? Boom.

28:34.000 --> 28:40.000
Within reason, I have a Dell Optiplex tower here that is running a flight simulator.

28:40.000 --> 28:44.000
Granted, because I bought AMD, not Nvidia, it's not running it very well.

28:44.000 --> 28:48.000
It frankly, it cries. But you know what?

28:48.000 --> 28:52.000
I could pop that baby open, slapping Nvidia in there tomorrow, right?

28:52.000 --> 28:55.000
If I'm willing to send the money. Totally.

28:55.000 --> 29:00.000
You buy an Apple, you buy an HP laptop, you can't replace anything.

29:00.000 --> 29:06.000
I mean, I don't I guess I don't understand how we expect, you know,

29:06.000 --> 29:10.000
you and I are grumpy old men and we expect these young people to learn everything.

29:10.000 --> 29:16.000
How can we expect that of them when they don't have the opportunity that we had to just pop open the box?

29:16.000 --> 29:22.000
And hey, I mean, I replaced the processor once. It was a pain in the ass.

29:22.000 --> 29:25.000
I love doing it. I loved building machines back in the day. I'll tell you what I think.

29:25.000 --> 29:27.000
Right. But back in the day, right? Back in the day.

29:27.000 --> 29:35.000
I don't. Well, first of all, I don't mean to I don't mean to disparage because I know there's this isn't true for every every young person.

29:35.000 --> 29:39.000
But these young kids aren't as interested in the technology.

29:39.000 --> 29:43.000
I have told the story again, but 10 years ago, way more than 10 years now, way more.

29:43.000 --> 29:51.000
But I worked at a school district and we had three computer labs that were full of people learning about computers.

29:51.000 --> 29:53.000
When I was in high school, we had three computer labs.

29:53.000 --> 29:58.000
Ten years later, I came back to that same school district as a contract employee to do some work with their I.T.

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
department and they didn't have any computer labs left.

30:00.000 --> 30:03.000
They had a department where there was a T.A.

30:03.000 --> 30:09.000
set up for about seven kids who were interested in computers and they just worked with the I.T.

30:09.000 --> 30:11.000
guy as a as a T.A.

30:11.000 --> 30:16.000
arrangement. There has been a massive decline in interest in how the technology works.

30:16.000 --> 30:23.000
But almost all of those kids had a device that we had to add to the Wi-Fi network, you know, like a iPod touch or an Android or iPhone.

30:23.000 --> 30:26.000
So they all had access to technology.

30:26.000 --> 30:35.000
So in a way, we've traded innate curiosity for building technology with massive access to completely built technology.

30:35.000 --> 30:39.000
And so they're sort of starting at a different ground level now.

30:39.000 --> 30:42.000
They're starting at a much higher abstraction in both software and hardware.

30:42.000 --> 30:47.000
And they have things that are massively more accessible to them.

30:47.000 --> 30:51.000
Like we've lamented before on the show, like droplets, they can create servers.

30:51.000 --> 30:53.000
We can, too. We have access to the same tools.

30:53.000 --> 30:56.000
We can all now create servers within seconds.

30:56.000 --> 31:05.000
And we can submit apps up to an app store that immediately get published around a huge CDN and get placement in a store that has all the payment processing set up for them.

31:05.000 --> 31:08.000
Still not the case with Apple. You used to have to build all that stuff.

31:08.000 --> 31:13.000
Like all of these things you used to have to build are all built now and commercialized.

31:13.000 --> 31:19.000
And it's just a matter of deciding who you want to pay or how much you can pay or what you want to build versus use.

31:19.000 --> 31:22.000
And it's a totally different level of access.

31:22.000 --> 31:27.000
It's ubiquitous now, whereas before it kind of had to build your way there.

31:27.000 --> 31:36.000
And I will grant you. It means you learned of stronger fundamentals about the technology.

31:36.000 --> 31:42.000
But it seems like we get along because this same pattern is repeated throughout all of history.

31:42.000 --> 31:49.000
Look at the radio. When my when my dad was a kid, it was common for people to build radios as a hobby.

31:49.000 --> 31:55.000
And you knew how to take things apart and build a radio. Nobody builds radios anymore for the most part.

31:55.000 --> 32:02.000
Just same thing with cars. I look under my hood of my GTI and it basically looks like a MacBook in there.

32:02.000 --> 32:09.000
And I get a push notification when I have a low air tire thing.

32:09.000 --> 32:15.000
Like it's it's a totally different level versus an old truck out in the field where are actually even my RV.

32:15.000 --> 32:21.000
I open up the engine compartment to my RV and it's huge and I can kind of just figure out what everything does.

32:21.000 --> 32:28.000
I've never changed oil on anything in my life until I got an RV and they went, oh, that's where the oil goes.

32:28.000 --> 32:31.000
That's where the oil drains. This is where I put the bucket. And that's the oil filter.

32:31.000 --> 32:37.000
Oh, well, I can do this. This is easy because it's all out and big and accessible.

32:37.000 --> 32:47.000
And we go through these changes in technology cycles and we the next generations stand on the shoulders of the previous giants.

32:47.000 --> 32:54.000
And so while it's a little disappointing and it makes it seem like they don't understand the fundamentals, I think it's just part of the process.

32:54.000 --> 32:59.000
So I agree with everything you've said, but let me ask you one question.

32:59.000 --> 33:07.000
When push comes to shove, don't you think a software engineer who understands, you know, let's not go down to the right.

33:07.000 --> 33:11.000
You know what I'm going at, right? Yeah, let's just talk a memory man. Let's forget about flip flops.

33:11.000 --> 33:19.000
Let's forget about electrical engineering. Let's just say basic computer science, memory management, compilers, things like that.

33:19.000 --> 33:26.000
Don't you think he or she has an advantage over someone who, you know, frankly, doesn't.

33:26.000 --> 33:35.000
I at least think they have a better innate, intuitive understanding of how things work and maybe why things don't work right or don't perform right.

33:35.000 --> 33:40.000
I don't know, though, if it gives them a massive advantage.

33:40.000 --> 33:47.000
If if everybody's using the same abstracted tool, you know, if you're dragging blocks in a cloud provider.

33:47.000 --> 33:55.000
So this is where I'm going to push back. When we started the show, one of my big cash cows was rewriting Objective C code.

33:55.000 --> 33:59.000
Remember, this is pre arc. This is 2012, right?

33:59.000 --> 34:09.000
Rewriting Objective C code for companies that had hired Java developers that claim to know Objective C, but never work in an environment without a garbage collector.

34:09.000 --> 34:14.000
Like that was a gold mine for me. Now, then arc came out and things were different.

34:14.000 --> 34:24.000
But at the time, if we go back to 2012, you know, an environment that doesn't have a GC was an absolute gold mine for me because I understood under the hood how, you know,

34:24.000 --> 34:29.000
basic things like Malik, I mean, in Objective C, they abstracted to retain release.

34:29.000 --> 34:39.000
But, you know, basically your normal, you know, what they call reference counting garbage collection.

34:39.000 --> 34:45.000
I don't know, I think there's still value right as we go to these Azure spheres, as we go to do these embedded systems.

34:45.000 --> 34:52.000
I think some of that maybe you don't need to know about flip flops, maybe you don't need to know about transistors.

34:52.000 --> 34:57.000
But, God, I think you do need to know about how like memory is managed on a system.

34:57.000 --> 35:04.000
I think you need to know how, you know, instructions are encoded by the compiler into binary.

35:04.000 --> 35:06.000
Maybe I'm just being cranky or whatever.

35:06.000 --> 35:09.000
No, I completely agree with you.

35:09.000 --> 35:23.000
But, you know, I got to imagine this is the same issue that mechanics face and a lot of other trades that deal with a level of expertise that the better you understand that the fundamentals of how an engine operates.

35:23.000 --> 35:26.000
And I think it's a similar thing.

35:26.000 --> 35:40.000
And it's, I don't know, it's, you know, what it feels like is it makes me feel like everything is just getting worse, like entropy is real and the universe is just slowly getting more and more chaotic and more abstract.

35:40.000 --> 35:41.000
Exactly.

35:41.000 --> 35:47.000
So, I prefer not to go there, instead think, well, we've carried on for so long, you know, we still have radios in our cars that work.

35:47.000 --> 35:50.000
And so far, every time I've gone out with cars.

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
Or as the Black Knight might say, it's just a flesh wound.

35:52.000 --> 35:53.000
Yeah.

35:53.000 --> 36:06.000
Hey, you know, before we go too far, there was a little back and forth this week between you and the audience about the confusion around JDK 11 and really just sort of Oracle's nonsense communication.

36:06.000 --> 36:27.000
So you were dispelling some Java FUD, hashtag Java FUD on Twitter, and I haven't really followed this very closely, so I can't speak very intelligently on this, but my understanding is, as I think, sometime, somewhat recently, was there a license change or something that made it confusing?

36:27.000 --> 36:29.000
What's going on here, Mr. Dominic?

36:29.000 --> 36:30.000
Yeah, Oracle...

36:30.000 --> 36:32.000
Fill me in.

36:32.000 --> 36:38.000
Oracle did something moderately annoying, but then their communications was straight up evil.

36:38.000 --> 36:39.000
That's weird.

36:39.000 --> 36:41.000
That doesn't sound like Oracle at all.

36:41.000 --> 36:42.000
Hmm.

36:42.000 --> 36:43.000
So...

36:43.000 --> 36:44.000
Really?

36:44.000 --> 36:50.000
So, like, I want to start off by saying the answer to this problem is just use OpenJDK.

36:50.000 --> 36:52.000
You can use it on Android now.

36:52.000 --> 36:59.000
I know that migration can be hard if you have older enterprise applications, but, you know, just use OpenJDK.

36:59.000 --> 37:05.000
Like, if you can somehow con your manager into doing it, you should do it.

37:05.000 --> 37:14.000
So, Oracle decided they wanted to make money, but I am not an attorney, so I'm not going to go into the details.

37:14.000 --> 37:15.000
Okay.

37:15.000 --> 37:28.000
But they released a very complicated statement that basically says, in some cases, you can continue using Oracle JDK 11 as you have used 10, so on and so forth.

37:28.000 --> 37:32.000
And in some, you can't.

37:32.000 --> 37:36.000
So, my small business answer to that problem is move to the OpenJDK.

37:36.000 --> 37:37.000
Yeah.

37:37.000 --> 37:38.000
Right?

37:38.000 --> 37:40.000
Like, that's the simplest solution to the problem.

37:40.000 --> 37:46.000
The reality is Oracle is basically trying to monetize Java.

37:46.000 --> 37:50.000
And if you work for Oracle and you want to dispute this, please do.

37:50.000 --> 38:08.000
But I have spent a lot of time in the last few weeks reading the documentation you all put out and talking to very, very, very concerned developers in your community who don't know what the hell you're doing, frankly.

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
This is weird.

38:10.000 --> 38:20.000
This is one of those situations that, even if it's all benign, the way it was put out there doesn't feel good.

38:20.000 --> 38:25.000
This is always the fear when Oracle buys an important property like this.

38:25.000 --> 38:27.000
This is always the fear of what's going to happen.

38:27.000 --> 38:30.000
It took them a lot longer than I expected, I got to say.

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
They showed real restraint here.

38:32.000 --> 38:37.000
So, the rule of thumb here is, if you can, jump over to OpenJDK as fast as possible.

38:37.000 --> 38:39.000
That's really the answer.

38:39.000 --> 38:40.000
That is the answer.

38:40.000 --> 38:41.000
I mean, it's weird.

38:41.000 --> 38:49.000
To be fair to Oracle, which just doesn't feel right, they are not overtly charging for JDK 11.

38:49.000 --> 38:56.000
But they're potentially assessing you for liability later.

38:56.000 --> 39:03.000
This reminds me of one of the – like Q, not to bring this up again because I said I wouldn't, but you know.

39:03.000 --> 39:04.000
Here we go.

39:04.000 --> 39:13.000
This is one of those situations where it's like, we might decide that you're violating our license and therefore have to pay us, which, yeah.

39:13.000 --> 39:18.000
I just want to tell you guys,.NET Core or OpenJDK, they're both great.

39:18.000 --> 39:19.000
You'll be fine.

39:19.000 --> 39:21.000
This has all been getting weird since the lawsuit with Google.

39:21.000 --> 39:23.000
This has all been getting weird.

39:23.000 --> 39:25.000
Well, this is all about Google, right?

39:25.000 --> 39:30.000
I mean, at the end of the day, this is all about, you know, Sun didn't know how to make money.

39:30.000 --> 39:33.000
Oracle is frankly obsessed with money, so.

39:33.000 --> 39:35.000
Yeah.

39:35.000 --> 39:38.000
Well, one more for the hoopla before we get out of here.

39:38.000 --> 39:39.000
Those APIs.

39:39.000 --> 39:43.000
You know how Google Plus was never really famous for having a very great developer API?

39:43.000 --> 39:45.000
Well, it turns out the APIs they did have –

39:45.000 --> 39:46.000
Wait, you mean Facebook?

39:46.000 --> 39:50.000
Yeah, I'm talking Google Plus.

39:50.000 --> 39:58.000
Turns out the limited APIs they did have caused them some problems, and today Google is announcing that it is sunsetting Google Plus.

39:58.000 --> 40:03.000
The consumer version of Google Plus currently has low usage, they write on their blog, and the engagement –

40:03.000 --> 40:09.000
90% of the engagement on Google Plus is less than five seconds.

40:09.000 --> 40:14.000
So there's this Project Strobe.

40:14.000 --> 40:19.000
This is how Google handles a data leak, is they wrap it all up with some really strong branding and marketing.

40:19.000 --> 40:27.000
So Google has launched Project Strobe, and Project Strobe is protecting your data and improving their third-party APIs.

40:27.000 --> 40:35.000
You see, old Google was doing the responsible thing, and they were reviewing their APIs, and they realized, heck, we have a bug here.

40:35.000 --> 40:40.000
We got ourselves a bug, it's existed since 2015.

40:40.000 --> 40:42.000
It's amazing.

40:42.000 --> 40:43.000
Yeah.

40:43.000 --> 40:52.000
You see, the data, though, that was leaked was limited to static, optional Google Plus profile fields, including names, email, address, occupation, gender, and age.

40:52.000 --> 41:01.000
It does not include any other data you may have posted or connected to Google Plus, or any other Google service like messages, account data, phone numbers, or G Suite content.

41:01.000 --> 41:05.000
They say they discovered and immediately patched the bug on March of 2018.

41:05.000 --> 41:15.000
They believe – get ready for this – it occurred after a launch as a result of the API's interaction with subsequent Google Plus code changes.

41:15.000 --> 41:20.000
Speaking of testing, yikes.

41:20.000 --> 41:29.000
They say the review did highlight the significant challenges in creating and maintaining a successful Google Plus that meets consumers' expectations.

41:29.000 --> 41:37.000
Given these challenges and the very low usage of the consumer version of Google Plus, we've decided to sunset the consumer version of Google Plus.

41:37.000 --> 41:46.000
We will implement this wind-down over a 10-month period slated for completion by the end of next August.

41:46.000 --> 41:50.000
Google Plus is dead, and it had a bug that could potentially have leaked data.

41:50.000 --> 41:52.000
They don't know if anybody took advantage of it.

41:52.000 --> 41:56.000
But Project Strobe is here, and Google Plus is going away.

41:56.000 --> 42:03.000
And it's, I don't know, about four years too late, I guess.

42:03.000 --> 42:06.000
I just thought at this point they were just going to keep it limping along forever.

42:06.000 --> 42:07.000
I really did.

42:07.000 --> 42:09.000
I was like, geez, if they haven't killed it yet.

42:09.000 --> 42:10.000
What do you think of this?

42:10.000 --> 42:19.000
Google has discovered their own data leak related to a code change that then impacted the way an API behaved.

42:19.000 --> 42:23.000
Oops.

42:23.000 --> 42:24.000
Are you muted over there?

42:24.000 --> 42:25.000
Where are you?

42:25.000 --> 42:26.000
Come back.

42:26.000 --> 42:31.000
Yeah, it's problematic.

42:31.000 --> 42:40.000
I mean, the question comes down to what was compromised during the time period before, then, and now.

42:40.000 --> 42:41.000
Right.

42:41.000 --> 42:44.000
So many services and so many APIs that they just have hanging out there.

42:44.000 --> 42:46.000
It's good that they're doing this audit.

42:46.000 --> 42:52.000
Well, Google Plus could also mean Gmail, right?

42:52.000 --> 42:54.000
Your Google account is your Google account.

42:54.000 --> 43:00.000
They claim that was not the case, that it only affected information that you plugged into the profile.

43:00.000 --> 43:04.000
It might not have been public information, but it was only that information.

43:04.000 --> 43:06.000
Yikes, though.

43:06.000 --> 43:10.000
I wonder what it means for applications that have integrated with Google Plus for sign-in or things like that.

43:10.000 --> 43:13.000
It means you wasted your money.

43:13.000 --> 43:14.000
Boom, boom.

43:14.000 --> 43:17.000
Hey, just one last story before we go.

43:17.000 --> 43:23.000
Microsoft has open sourced their infrared.net, which is AI code that is just in time for your weekend.

43:23.000 --> 43:26.000
Actually, this story came out on Friday, so that headline no longer applies.

43:26.000 --> 43:33.000
But a team at Microsoft's Research Center in Cambridge, yes, that's in the UK, kicked off development of the framework in 2004,

43:33.000 --> 43:36.000
and it was released for academic use in 2008.

43:36.000 --> 43:40.000
Since then, it's been getting refined, and now it's available up on GitHub.

43:40.000 --> 43:43.000
It takes a model-based approach to machine learning.

43:43.000 --> 43:50.000
The developer gives the framework a model, and then the framework then develops machine learning algorithms directly from the model provided.

43:50.000 --> 43:52.000
You can try it out if you want.

43:52.000 --> 43:57.000
It's cross-platform, it supports.NET Framework and.NET Core 2.0, Mono 5.0 as well.

43:57.000 --> 44:00.000
You can use Visual Studio on Windows or on Mac or Linux.

44:00.000 --> 44:04.000
You could really just use any text editor you want.

44:04.000 --> 44:14.000
Models for infrared.net are set up using a probabilistic, easy for me to say, probabilistic, I could almost say it, program.

44:14.000 --> 44:22.000
These frameworks compile into what the team itself describes as something critically called the deterministic approximate Bayesian inference.

44:22.000 --> 44:29.000
This is highly scalable with Microsoft using a system that slips up knowledge from billions of web pages.

44:29.000 --> 44:37.000
The Bayesian inference is the interesting aspect to this, and the fact that you feed it a model, and then it figures things out instead of creating the model.

44:37.000 --> 44:43.000
Microsoft is pretty proud of this, and they've been making a big stink over last Friday and over the weekend.

44:43.000 --> 44:46.000
And we'll have a link to the story if you want to know more.

44:46.000 --> 44:49.000
Microsoft, once again, just open sourcing that S.

44:49.000 --> 44:54.000
Code is up on GitHub too, so you can just go download it and give it a go.

44:54.000 --> 44:56.000
Let's see, what is the license?

44:56.000 --> 44:57.000
What did they license it as?

44:57.000 --> 44:58.000
Oh, surprise, surprise.

44:58.000 --> 44:59.000
It's the MIT license.

44:59.000 --> 45:00.000
What a shocker.

45:00.000 --> 45:02.000
They seem to be putting a lot into that.

45:02.000 --> 45:05.000
They like that MIT license there over at Microsoft.

45:05.000 --> 45:06.000
MIT's the best, baby.

45:06.000 --> 45:08.000
Be a student at MIT.

45:08.000 --> 45:11.000
Oh, I don't know.

45:11.000 --> 45:14.000
It's negative in the freedom dimension.

45:14.000 --> 45:16.000
Oh, there he is, my old enemy.

45:16.000 --> 45:19.000
Anything else we want to touch on this week, Mr. Dominic?

45:19.000 --> 45:20.000
I don't think so.

45:20.000 --> 45:24.000
I mean, can I just say open JDK, open JDK, open JDK?

45:24.000 --> 45:27.000
On elementary OS, apparently.

45:27.000 --> 45:28.000
You know what?

45:28.000 --> 45:29.000
Even Windows.

45:29.000 --> 45:32.000
Just don't use Oracle's JDK.

45:32.000 --> 45:33.000
You radical.

45:33.000 --> 45:40.000
All right, well, I'll send people over to the Twitter, at chrisles, for me, at Jupiter signal, for the network.

45:40.000 --> 45:42.000
You can find Mr. Dominic at Dumanuco.

45:42.000 --> 45:46.000
Anywhere else you want to send people on the internet for you, Mr. Dominic?

45:46.000 --> 45:47.000
Anywhere?

45:47.000 --> 45:48.000
No?

45:48.000 --> 45:49.000
No.

45:49.000 --> 45:50.000
He's gone.

45:50.000 --> 45:51.000
He's left me.

45:51.000 --> 45:52.000
He's off to go get another Sam Adams.

45:52.000 --> 45:53.000
Goodbye.

45:53.000 --> 45:54.000
Goodbye.

45:54.000 --> 45:55.000
I'm getting a Sam Adams.

45:55.000 --> 45:57.000
Oh, you bastard.

45:57.000 --> 45:58.000
Here I am with my water.

45:58.000 --> 46:00.000
All right, we'll check the calendar for when we're live next week.

46:00.000 --> 46:02.000
Jupiterbroadcasting.com slash calendar.

46:02.000 --> 46:07.000
You can find the show post over on that site or coder.show where we'll have links to everything.

46:07.000 --> 46:10.000
This episode, in particular, coder.show slash 329.

46:10.000 --> 46:12.000
That's also where our contact page is.

46:12.000 --> 46:16.000
And you can give us your feedback, your opinions, on our subreddit, coderradio.reddit.com,

46:16.000 --> 46:20.000
which is, I think, all of the feedback for this episode came from the subreddit.

46:20.000 --> 46:21.000
So thanks, you guys.

46:21.000 --> 46:22.000
You rock.

46:22.000 --> 46:38.000
Thanks for joining us also, and we'll see you back here next week.
