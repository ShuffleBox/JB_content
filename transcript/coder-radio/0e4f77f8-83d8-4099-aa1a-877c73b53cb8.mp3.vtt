00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
This is Koda Radio, episode 355 for April 29th, 2019.

00:31.000 --> 00:43.000
Hello, and welcome to Koda Radio, Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show that takes a pragmatic look at the art and business, software development, and related technologies.

00:43.000 --> 00:48.000
My name is Wes, and I'm joined once again by Mr. Michael Dominic. Welcome to the show.

00:48.000 --> 00:54.000
Well, a wubba dub dub and a hippity hop. Happy Koda Radio to you, Mr. Payne.

00:54.000 --> 01:01.000
Oh, I'm always happy to be there. And you know, I'm glad I'm here today because we got a lot to talk about.

01:01.000 --> 01:05.000
This is a thick, juicy beyond burger of a show.

01:05.000 --> 01:12.000
And you know, a lot of the stuff that we find actually, well, sure, sometimes we find it, you know, whatever Mike drags into the show.

01:12.000 --> 01:18.000
Oh, but many of those things, well, actually, they come from you, our wonderful audience.

01:18.000 --> 01:24.000
If you go to our website, Koda.show, Koda.show slash contact, there's a contact form.

01:24.000 --> 01:29.000
You just write it in. You can be anonymous if you want. You can tell us your name. Let us know what you think.

01:29.000 --> 01:33.000
It just helps us make a better show. And sometimes it gives us great stuff to talk about.

01:33.000 --> 01:40.000
So I was thinking today, let's start off with some feedback. All right, so this one's, this one's for me.

01:40.000 --> 01:49.000
Tom wrote in to talk about in a recent episode, we were talking about Chrome OS and Windows. Actually, it was 353 a week with WSL.

01:49.000 --> 01:53.000
When Mike, you were telling me all about your recent adventures over in the subsystem.

01:53.000 --> 02:00.000
And we were kind of pondering things about like, what does this mean for desktop Linux? And what about Chrome OS?

02:00.000 --> 02:09.000
And Tom wrote in, Wes, it hurt me when you said that there is little difference between Windows and Chrome OS.

02:09.000 --> 02:17.000
He breaks it down for us. Chrome OS is open source versus closed Windows. Free versus paid.

02:17.000 --> 02:22.000
An open standards based platform, meaning the web here, versus proprietary.

02:22.000 --> 02:29.000
No bloatware versus tons of bloat. And no ads versus some small ads in Windows.

02:29.000 --> 02:31.000
Small.

02:31.000 --> 02:34.000
Small, yeah. That's up to the observer perhaps.

02:34.000 --> 02:35.000
Yeah.

02:35.000 --> 02:36.000
And your DPI.

02:36.000 --> 02:39.000
Spam is in the eye of the beholder. But keep going.

02:39.000 --> 02:48.000
And finally, Chrome OS is Linux. So although Google's version comes with telemetry, just like Windows, Tom notes,

02:48.000 --> 02:56.000
people are free to avoid that by building their own. So we have things like Cloud Ready, which is excellent, in my opinion.

02:56.000 --> 02:59.000
And you know what? I think I think Tom's pretty much spot on here.

02:59.000 --> 03:06.000
There are ways in which I think about them in the same context, just in that they come from this big company and have been bundled and stuff.

03:06.000 --> 03:11.000
And, you know, you might not necessarily be able to build the exact version that gets configured and shipped on your machine.

03:11.000 --> 03:18.000
But there are still a lot of differences as platforms, especially when you compare it to the closed world of Windows.

03:18.000 --> 03:23.000
And while they both might let you run Linux apps, they're obviously doing it in a very different way.

03:23.000 --> 03:28.000
Sure. I mean, Wes, this was directed at you, so...

03:28.000 --> 03:32.000
Chime in. Come on. The water's fine.

03:32.000 --> 03:36.000
Can I say a pox on both your houses?

03:36.000 --> 03:38.000
I think you just did.

03:38.000 --> 03:45.000
Yeah. I more agree with you, Wes, than I do the writer. But yeah, you both suck.

03:45.000 --> 03:52.000
Just go buy like a XPS or like a Galago or something. I don't know if you want to run Linux, run Linux.

03:52.000 --> 03:59.000
I've never, you can ask Chris, in years of this show, I've always been kind of like skeptical of Chrome OS,

03:59.000 --> 04:07.000
especially when they added the sort of ability to run and... Was it Android apps or Linux apps first? I can't remember.

04:07.000 --> 04:09.000
Android, then like regular...

04:09.000 --> 04:11.000
It was Android, then like devs, right?

04:11.000 --> 04:12.000
I believe so, yeah.

04:12.000 --> 04:15.000
But it's basically dev packages, right?

04:15.000 --> 04:20.000
I mean, they are just running Linux applications. You know, I haven't actually played around with how the packaging works.

04:20.000 --> 04:27.000
So full disclosure here, I'm very ignorant of Chrome OS. I had a sales guy who I bought a Chromebook when they first came out.

04:27.000 --> 04:34.000
Like, we're talking six years ago, seven years ago. Crap, we're talking like eight years ago.

04:34.000 --> 04:44.000
And he had it for two months, and then I just like bought him a Surface because it just wasn't good enough, right?

04:44.000 --> 04:48.000
Yeah, it just wasn't meeting your needs. Overly restricted, maybe?

04:48.000 --> 04:56.000
Yeah, like he needed... I hate to use the 90s term, but he needed multimedia functionality that at the time,

04:56.000 --> 05:02.000
remember, we're going back like seven to eight years here, wasn't exactly possible.

05:02.000 --> 05:09.000
I will give Chrome OS one thing in the demos I've seen, it is a lot better than it used to be, right?

05:09.000 --> 05:12.000
Just as web apps are better than they used to be.

05:12.000 --> 05:20.000
But I don't know what to say, Wes. I mean, at your shop over there, are they running a lot of Chrome OS?

05:20.000 --> 05:30.000
No, not that I'm aware of. It seems like its main inroads have just been in education, schools, maybe some sort of enterprise-like casual handout use.

05:30.000 --> 05:39.000
Yeah, at the Mad Botter, we're Linux and Mac, and we obviously have Windows partitions for testing, compatibility.

05:39.000 --> 05:49.000
We do sell some software on Windows, but I am not a Chrome customer. I am not a Chrome OS user.

05:49.000 --> 05:55.000
It's hard for me to kind of weigh in intelligently.

05:55.000 --> 06:03.000
If you had a Chromebook that was suitably powerful and had a nice Google-maintained system, nice and clean, you just showed up and it works,

06:03.000 --> 06:10.000
you open the laptop, you know that they're handling most of the stuff, and you can install all your favorite desktop, you know,

06:10.000 --> 06:16.000
electron Linux applications, and you can have a real development environment. Would you use it?

06:16.000 --> 06:23.000
I mean, if that's the case, sure. But isn't that just like Pop OS? Isn't that just another version of Ubuntu now?

06:23.000 --> 06:26.000
I guess I'm missing something.

06:26.000 --> 06:30.000
I think the worry is not the personal aspect, I think, is the nature of this.

06:30.000 --> 06:35.000
Because, yes, personally, just running Linux, I love that. That's a great comment that you made.

06:35.000 --> 06:37.000
No, I'm not trying to be a troll.

06:37.000 --> 06:45.000
No, no, no, I like it. I just mean it may be that the end users, that's not â€“ yes, it is an option,

06:45.000 --> 06:52.000
but they're going to get the choice of a Windows and Chromebook or maybe a Mac in their day-to-day lives.

06:52.000 --> 06:53.000
Sure.

06:53.000 --> 06:56.000
I think that's where a lot of the hope around Chrome OS is coming from is like,

06:56.000 --> 07:02.000
hey, look, it is Linux, and it's becoming kind of like more real Linux, even if it's not perfect.

07:02.000 --> 07:07.000
So, I mean, to answer your question in a, I guess, like a fuller way,

07:07.000 --> 07:13.000
I have never been shy about spending money on computers.

07:13.000 --> 07:17.000
Listen to the back catalog, right, folks?

07:17.000 --> 07:22.000
So I would never buy a Chromebook because I just wouldn't, right?

07:22.000 --> 07:31.000
Like, I don't know, I really will buy whatever the sexy new XPS or System76 Linux laptop is.

07:31.000 --> 07:34.000
Or if I need a Mac, I will buy a brand new Mac Mini.

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
All right, let me break it down.

07:36.000 --> 07:40.000
Other than education, I don't understand the Chromebook as a product.

07:40.000 --> 07:48.000
Given that if I have people who aren't doing dev or engineering, Windows-based laptops are so cheap.

07:48.000 --> 07:53.000
In fact, if I buy a Windows laptop and I throw a XFCE, by the way,

07:53.000 --> 07:56.000
please listen to Choose Linux on Jupyter Broadcasting.

07:56.000 --> 08:00.000
No one forced me to do this, by the way, this is voluntary.

08:00.000 --> 08:06.000
It turns out that XFCE, which for those who don't know is a Linux desktop environment,

08:06.000 --> 08:12.000
uses basically no memory and is super fast on shitty hardware you can buy in Best Buy.

08:12.000 --> 08:16.000
So like for me, for my purposes as a guy who runs a dev shop,

08:16.000 --> 08:20.000
if I have a sales guy or a customer service rep,

08:20.000 --> 08:25.000
and if he or she doesn't want to run Windows because he wants to be part of the...

08:25.000 --> 08:28.000
And I've had this happen, Wes, where they don't want to be the odd man out.

08:28.000 --> 08:30.000
Does that kind of make sense?

08:30.000 --> 08:33.000
Yeah, I mean, there's just social pressures there.

08:33.000 --> 08:37.000
We are a Mac and Linux shop, right?

08:37.000 --> 08:42.000
And each of us have a Mac and Linux machine, but for one hardcore Mac guy.

08:42.000 --> 08:49.000
But like, I don't know, I would just like buy him a HP or a Dell at Best Buy

08:49.000 --> 08:53.000
and like slap Ubuntu XFCE edition on that.

08:53.000 --> 08:58.000
And like, I guess, educate me,

08:58.000 --> 09:05.000
where would Chrome OS come into this conversation that I'm not understanding?

09:05.000 --> 09:08.000
I mean, I think it would mostly probably be for larger organizations

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
where you had a lot of overhead, you know,

09:10.000 --> 09:12.000
where you did need some of those enterprise controls

09:12.000 --> 09:14.000
to manage rollouts and submissions.

09:14.000 --> 09:17.000
And so that's what I see a lot of this debate.

09:17.000 --> 09:21.000
Like personally, in my own life, I'm actually thinking about buying one just to play with it

09:21.000 --> 09:24.000
because the tech is interesting behind it, but I don't really need it.

09:24.000 --> 09:27.000
And I don't see myself using it just because I am comfortable

09:27.000 --> 09:31.000
with the administrative overhead of regular operating systems.

09:31.000 --> 09:36.000
But if you're the IT guy and you don't need like 50 different people all trying to do their own

09:36.000 --> 09:38.000
and attempting to manage security updates

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
on the various developer laptops that they have,

09:40.000 --> 09:44.000
maybe that gets you a little scared if you're from a sysadmin background.

09:44.000 --> 09:47.000
That, I think, is a lot of the Google play here.

09:47.000 --> 09:50.000
Is this like an enterprise play, basically?

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
I mean, there's definitely that angle, yeah.

09:52.000 --> 09:55.000
And that's the same in the schools because you can, you know, you get it out,

09:55.000 --> 09:57.000
they'll get you set up, and then the IT staff can administer it

09:57.000 --> 09:59.000
and make sure that they're wiped.

09:59.000 --> 10:01.000
And there's the security aspect of, you know, it's more sandboxed

10:01.000 --> 10:04.000
and it's hard to install the things you want maybe,

10:04.000 --> 10:07.000
but as a result, people just aren't going to break them.

10:07.000 --> 10:08.000
Fair enough.

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
Well, we spent 10 minutes on Chrome OS just now,

10:10.000 --> 10:13.000
which I think is 11 minutes more than we should.

10:13.000 --> 10:14.000
Way more, yeah.

10:14.000 --> 10:19.000
For the record, Mike remains questionable about Chrome OS.

10:19.000 --> 10:20.000
I liked your comment, though.

10:20.000 --> 10:25.000
You brought up your willingness, let's say willingness, to buy new hardware.

10:25.000 --> 10:31.000
That is, I think, one of the reasons that we should move on to this next feedback topic.

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
Let me brace for impact then.

10:33.000 --> 10:38.000
Yeah, hardware, it comes up sometimes.

10:38.000 --> 10:41.000
Andy writes in to us, in a recent episode,

10:41.000 --> 10:45.000
you guys were talking about some people on Reddit, I'll put that in scare quotes,

10:45.000 --> 10:49.000
really hate when there are discussions about hardware.

10:49.000 --> 10:52.000
And that it's probably just, you know, one person with two accounts.

10:52.000 --> 10:57.000
Now, I'm not that person, but I also dislike you guys talking about hardware.

10:57.000 --> 11:01.000
In fact, about a year or two ago, it seemed like half of every second episode

11:01.000 --> 11:05.000
or about 25% of the show was about hardware.

11:05.000 --> 11:08.000
I very nearly removed the show from my podcast app.

11:08.000 --> 11:12.000
But, well, I didn't have anything better to replace it.

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
What I like about this is he next writes,

11:14.000 --> 11:17.000
the hosts of the show are interesting to listen to.

11:17.000 --> 11:22.000
Unfortunately, that only goes so far when the content itself doesn't interest me.

11:22.000 --> 11:26.000
To be clear, I don't expect you to change anything as I'm just one person.

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
If you have more listeners that enjoy what you're talking about,

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
well, then it doesn't make sense to stop.

11:30.000 --> 11:33.000
I'm just letting you know, here's one in that other column.

11:33.000 --> 11:37.000
Thank you for the generally entertaining show.

11:37.000 --> 11:41.000
Yeah, so this is a point, Wes, where you can do arbitration,

11:41.000 --> 11:43.000
and Chris can't defend himself,

11:43.000 --> 11:46.000
but I think I'm going to defend myself and Chris a little bit here.

11:46.000 --> 11:49.000
So this show is old, Wes, right?

11:49.000 --> 11:52.000
Like, you know, you're new to it.

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
Yeah, this is episode 355.

11:54.000 --> 11:57.000
And as podcasts go, you know, and I've been the host of the show for a long time,

11:57.000 --> 12:01.000
I would argue, before I hit his actual points,

12:01.000 --> 12:08.000
that one of the main Achilles' heel of Coderradio is that it's Coderradio,

12:08.000 --> 12:13.000
not Linux coding radio or like iOS development radio.

12:13.000 --> 12:18.000
So it's so broad that you always end up covering a lot of things.

12:18.000 --> 12:20.000
Like we just did last episode, we talked about what?

12:20.000 --> 12:25.000
Erlang, Clojure, I think I threw an F sharp reference somewhere, right?

12:25.000 --> 12:26.000
You sure did.

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
And before that we talked about Rust,

12:28.000 --> 12:33.000
and before that I think I talked about Swift maybe a few weeks ago.

12:33.000 --> 12:36.000
So the hardware stuff has been a back and forth.

12:36.000 --> 12:40.000
What I will say is I think there's a balance.

12:40.000 --> 12:44.000
For instance, this eGPU, you know, I'm using an eGPU for a job right now.

12:44.000 --> 12:48.000
I have had a lot of people reach out to me on Twitter or via email

12:48.000 --> 12:51.000
asking details about the eGPU.

12:51.000 --> 12:56.000
I definitely get the, you know, which Linux distro are you running

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
or are you running Mac or Linux this week?

12:58.000 --> 12:59.000
I get it.

12:59.000 --> 13:03.000
It kind of doesn't matter for the context of the show.

13:03.000 --> 13:05.000
But it's definitely a hard balance, right?

13:05.000 --> 13:08.000
Like the analogy I like to make is if this was carpentry radio,

13:08.000 --> 13:11.000
you know, you'd like a carpenter, right?

13:11.000 --> 13:14.000
It would be totally appropriate to talk about, well,

13:14.000 --> 13:17.000
do you like Black & Decker or do you like Craftsman tools?

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
And why?

13:19.000 --> 13:22.000
It's my opinion that that's an appropriate conversation to have.

13:22.000 --> 13:23.000
Yeah, right.

13:23.000 --> 13:24.000
I mean, they're parts of your trade.

13:24.000 --> 13:27.000
It's not the direct work and it's not a show about making hammers.

13:27.000 --> 13:29.000
But, well, you're using a hammer.

13:29.000 --> 13:31.000
So I would argue a different point.

13:31.000 --> 13:36.000
So, okay, whether I'm running an XPS 13 or a Dordor Pro, I get it.

13:36.000 --> 13:38.000
It's just like a vendor difference.

13:38.000 --> 13:43.000
But how about if I switch from, let's say, OpenStack to Kubernetes?

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
Well, that's worth talking about, right?

13:45.000 --> 13:47.000
Yeah, I would say so.

13:47.000 --> 13:50.000
And that would be the title of the show.

13:50.000 --> 13:53.000
So at that point, I'm going to just leave that analogy with you and say,

13:53.000 --> 13:56.000
Wes, you are the only innocent man here.

13:56.000 --> 14:01.000
You're the only non-convicted hardware addict here.

14:01.000 --> 14:03.000
Judge me and Chris for the last six years.

14:03.000 --> 14:04.000
Go ahead.

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
Judge, jury, executioner.

14:06.000 --> 14:07.000
All right.

14:07.000 --> 14:11.000
Well, in my previous existence as a Just Coder Radio fan.

14:11.000 --> 14:14.000
Well, and you did host another show, though, right?

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
Yeah, yeah, absolutely.

14:16.000 --> 14:20.000
But just thinking about it from that perspective, I think it was just,

14:20.000 --> 14:23.000
you know, it happened to be, too, the nature of the host.

14:23.000 --> 14:26.000
So not only is it something that you need to use for your job

14:26.000 --> 14:29.000
and spend time thinking about because you're a craftsman

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
and you want to work with good tools,

14:31.000 --> 14:33.000
and those tools do affect your ability to get work done.

14:33.000 --> 14:35.000
So you talk about it.

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
Secondly, you're just flat out cursed.

14:37.000 --> 14:40.000
So you just break everything that comes into contact with you.

14:40.000 --> 14:44.000
So that also has led to just being hardware talking about like a little bit more.

14:44.000 --> 14:47.000
I buy laptops seemingly once a decade.

14:47.000 --> 14:49.000
So, you know, that shifts things,

14:49.000 --> 14:53.000
although maybe that might change in the future now that you're influencing me.

14:53.000 --> 14:55.000
Well, a little defense here.

14:55.000 --> 14:59.000
I also, because of the type of work I do, particularly in the aerospace industry,

14:59.000 --> 15:02.000
I get hardware where I do the work on the hardware

15:02.000 --> 15:05.000
and then have to ship it back.

15:05.000 --> 15:08.000
Right, so there's just a lot of transient hardware flowing through your life.

15:08.000 --> 15:12.000
Yeah, there's a lot of churn, right.

15:12.000 --> 15:16.000
I would also say it was a topic that I enjoyed listening to you and Chris talk about

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
because you came at it from different perspectives,

15:18.000 --> 15:21.000
but it was an area that you could really meet in the middle.

15:21.000 --> 15:24.000
From his perspectives using hardware for one purpose

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
and watching the industry for a long time

15:26.000 --> 15:29.000
and yours from another angle.

15:29.000 --> 15:32.000
So it was a fun way to interconnect and sort of talk about this stuff

15:32.000 --> 15:34.000
in a little, not just from a consumer angle.

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
I guess that's the point that I liked

15:36.000 --> 15:39.000
because we're just talking about things that we're using from day to day life.

15:39.000 --> 15:42.000
Okay, that's fine. That's less relevant.

15:42.000 --> 15:46.000
But if it's tooling that you use to get your job done,

15:46.000 --> 15:50.000
to do development, to do programming or anything in that area,

15:50.000 --> 15:52.000
I think it just makes sense.

15:52.000 --> 15:57.000
Yeah, I would add, I mean, we went into a cursory explanation about three weeks ago

15:57.000 --> 16:02.000
that at some point we have to talk again about eGPUs

16:02.000 --> 16:08.000
because all of mine and Chris' agonizing over my potential ideal workstation,

16:08.000 --> 16:11.000
I might not give this eGPU back, Wes.

16:11.000 --> 16:14.000
I might just say I spilled a martini on it.

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
Everybody would believe that, right?

16:16.000 --> 16:18.000
Yeah, absolutely.

16:18.000 --> 16:22.000
Honestly, I am shocked at how good Thunderbolt supported.

16:22.000 --> 16:25.000
I know I'm taking a tangent, but indulge me, it's Cesar.

16:25.000 --> 16:28.000
I am shocked, or two weeks from it,

16:28.000 --> 16:33.000
how good eGPU support is on a modern Linux kernel.

16:33.000 --> 16:38.000
This is awesome.

16:38.000 --> 16:41.000
I am not a big gamer.

16:41.000 --> 16:46.000
I've gone into the telegram, into the IRC a few times to ask for a gamer.

16:46.000 --> 16:50.000
I'll play a casual 2D game, right?

16:50.000 --> 16:57.000
But for ML programming, for just compiling big pieces of lots of code,

16:57.000 --> 17:06.000
oh my God, if you are a developer who just spent $2,000 and up on a laptop

17:06.000 --> 17:09.000
and you're annoyed you don't have a dedicated graphics card,

17:09.000 --> 17:14.000
honestly, and I'll drop it here, consider an eGPU.

17:14.000 --> 17:18.000
Because when you're at your office, you're at your home office,

17:18.000 --> 17:23.000
in my case I work from home, you plug it in via Thunderbolt, it's great.

17:23.000 --> 17:26.000
But if you need to be on the road, you just run on the Intel,

17:26.000 --> 17:31.000
the graphics processor, and you have your battery life

17:31.000 --> 17:34.000
to do your PowerPoint or whatever you're doing.

17:34.000 --> 17:38.000
In my case, it's whatever the healthy LibreOffice version of PowerPoint is.

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
But presentations?

17:40.000 --> 17:41.000
Impress?

17:41.000 --> 17:42.000
Whatever.

17:42.000 --> 17:45.000
It's the built-in one to pop OS.

17:45.000 --> 17:46.000
It's great.

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
And I do think it's important, right?

17:48.000 --> 17:51.000
Particularly because we have a bent towards independent software developers.

17:51.000 --> 17:55.000
If you're a one-man band, you don't want to have to spend,

17:55.000 --> 17:59.000
and frankly, we've had a history of covering Mac development and iOS development,

17:59.000 --> 18:04.000
you don't want to spend $7,000 on a Mac Pro,

18:04.000 --> 18:07.000
which is what I'm guessing they're going to cost in June.

18:07.000 --> 18:09.000
We'll find out in a few months.

18:09.000 --> 18:14.000
And then another $2,500 on the MacBook Pro to carry.

18:14.000 --> 18:17.000
Wouldn't it be nice if you could just buy the MacBook Pro,

18:17.000 --> 18:23.000
or if you're not a Mac guy, buy the XPS or the Darter or whatever,

18:23.000 --> 18:25.000
but get the best of both worlds?

18:25.000 --> 18:27.000
Is that insane, Wes?

18:27.000 --> 18:31.000
No, honestly, it sounds kind of like the perfect unicorn situation.

18:31.000 --> 18:34.000
Because I have this OWC eGPU enclosure here.

18:34.000 --> 18:37.000
I can pop out the Radeon Sapphire card I have in

18:37.000 --> 18:39.000
if a better one comes out in a year,

18:39.000 --> 18:42.000
and all I have to pay for is the card.

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
The enclosure still works.

18:44.000 --> 18:47.000
You just swap them out, and suddenly it's like buying a nicer computer

18:47.000 --> 18:49.000
with a better graphics card.

18:49.000 --> 18:51.000
It's the whole new world, right?

18:51.000 --> 18:54.000
I have to say, I was telling my wife,

18:54.000 --> 18:58.000
and to say that her eyes glazed over is a wild understatement,

18:58.000 --> 19:01.000
because apparently she found this boring.

19:01.000 --> 19:04.000
But I don't need to spend money on computers now.

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
I have good enough computers,

19:06.000 --> 19:09.000
but maybe I could buy a nicer monitor, right?

19:09.000 --> 19:14.000
And then in a year I'd buy a nicer card to go into the eGPU container.

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
I forgot the word, the eGPU dock.

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
No.

19:18.000 --> 19:19.000
Case.

19:19.000 --> 19:20.000
The hell they call them, Wes.

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
I was just going to let you try to figure it out,

19:22.000 --> 19:23.000
because I was enjoying it.

19:23.000 --> 19:26.000
I can't remember, but let's just call it the eGPU container.

19:26.000 --> 19:27.000
Enclosure.

19:27.000 --> 19:29.000
Enclosure, thank you.

19:29.000 --> 19:32.000
And wow, I have a new computer.

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
But when I'm on the road and I'm giving a presentation,

19:34.000 --> 19:37.000
I still have my beautiful eight hours of battery life.

19:37.000 --> 19:38.000
Right.

19:38.000 --> 19:39.000
I don't know.

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
And we'll drop the hardware thing from here,

19:41.000 --> 19:43.000
but yeah, we're going to cover eGPU stuff,

19:43.000 --> 19:45.000
because I think it's a game changer,

19:45.000 --> 19:47.000
especially for independent guys like me.

19:47.000 --> 19:50.000
And Wes, I think it's a game changer for you,

19:50.000 --> 19:51.000
because you're amazing,

19:51.000 --> 19:54.000
and we need you rendered in the highest detail possible.

19:54.000 --> 19:55.000
Yeah, absolutely.

19:55.000 --> 19:57.000
I mean, you've been making all those face swaps

19:57.000 --> 19:58.000
between me and Jar Jar,

19:58.000 --> 20:01.000
and that just takes a lot of time to compute.

20:01.000 --> 20:05.000
I made the face swap between Chris and Darth Maul,

20:05.000 --> 20:06.000
although nothing happened.

20:06.000 --> 20:07.000
It was kind of weird.

20:07.000 --> 20:10.000
Eerily the same.

20:10.000 --> 20:11.000
Anyway, you're right.

20:11.000 --> 20:12.000
It's time to move on from that.

20:12.000 --> 20:13.000
Thank you for writing in, Andy.

20:13.000 --> 20:16.000
I appreciate that your feedback was nuanced.

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
Well, we always appreciate the feedback, right?

20:18.000 --> 20:19.000
Keep writing in.

20:19.000 --> 20:21.000
Yeah, absolutely do.

20:21.000 --> 20:23.000
And I like that you took it into account

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
that people like different things,

20:25.000 --> 20:26.000
and that's just how it is.

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
We think a lot about it too.

20:28.000 --> 20:31.000
So for something completely different,

20:31.000 --> 20:33.000
Mike, you've been trying to get us to include this in the show

20:33.000 --> 20:35.000
for like a hot minute,

20:35.000 --> 20:36.000
and I was like, what is this?

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
I'm not really caught up.

20:38.000 --> 20:39.000
Now's the time.

20:39.000 --> 20:40.000
I'm really confused.

20:40.000 --> 20:45.000
As someone who ends up running things like Qt, the framework,

20:45.000 --> 20:47.000
I'm running the Plasma desktop.

20:47.000 --> 20:50.000
So it's in my every day.

20:50.000 --> 20:53.000
I've never really understood the dual licensing

20:53.000 --> 20:56.000
and how the licensing requirements work.

20:56.000 --> 21:01.000
So, Wes, you have the benefit of, again,

21:01.000 --> 21:04.000
all these topics you are not involved in directly.

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
I am unburdened and innocent.

21:06.000 --> 21:09.000
There is an application known as Gryphon,

21:09.000 --> 21:11.000
which I'm sure you know,

21:11.000 --> 21:13.000
a little company called the Mad Botter.

21:13.000 --> 21:14.000
I love it.

21:14.000 --> 21:20.000
It is a radar display system for fighter and now bomber jets, FYI.

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
There was a version of it written in Qt,

21:22.000 --> 21:27.000
and then a wonderful young man named Mike called the Qt company in Boston

21:27.000 --> 21:29.000
and said, hey, we'd like a license.

21:29.000 --> 21:31.000
What can we do here?

21:31.000 --> 21:35.000
We think we're okay with the GPL, but, you know, I'd like to talk,

21:35.000 --> 21:38.000
and if we're not, let's, you know, before I sold anything,

21:38.000 --> 21:39.000
I'm going to be super clear.

21:39.000 --> 21:42.000
So would my lawyer, before we sold anything.

21:42.000 --> 21:46.000
And the cute people, the gentleman I spoke to was basically like,

21:46.000 --> 21:51.000
no, you need a proprietary license, and it's a lot of money.

21:51.000 --> 21:57.000
So we RMFR'd the entire project, and then we sponsored.

21:57.000 --> 21:59.000
Wait, the entire project?

21:59.000 --> 22:01.000
The entire source code base, yeah.

22:01.000 --> 22:03.000
Wow.

22:03.000 --> 22:05.000
Yeah, we sponsored Avalonia,

22:05.000 --> 22:09.000
which is the cross-platform.NET open source toolkit,

22:09.000 --> 22:12.000
and rewrote the entire thing in.NET with Windows support first,

22:12.000 --> 22:15.000
and then eventually we added Linux support in about a month.

22:15.000 --> 22:19.000
So this was a major derailment for not only the project, but the company.

22:19.000 --> 22:26.000
This was a tens of thousand dollar loss for me personally, for my RAM.

22:26.000 --> 22:31.000
Turns out, and so funny, a listener of the show sent this video to me,

22:31.000 --> 22:36.000
and in fact, he makes IoT boards, and we're going to be evaluating them soon.

22:36.000 --> 22:40.000
There's been so much confusion for the cute company about the licensing

22:40.000 --> 22:44.000
that they've made a very helpful, very detailed video on it.

22:44.000 --> 22:47.000
I've watched the whole thing three times.

22:47.000 --> 22:49.000
It's their attorney.

22:49.000 --> 22:51.000
It's a video made by attorneys.

22:51.000 --> 22:54.000
And this is like a 57-minute video, so that's a lot.

22:54.000 --> 22:58.000
Yeah, this is going into theoretical cases and legalities

22:58.000 --> 23:02.000
of using the GPL and the LGPL and proprietary software.

23:02.000 --> 23:05.000
I don't want to get in a fight about proprietary software.

23:05.000 --> 23:10.000
Just right now, the way my business is, I just have to.

23:10.000 --> 23:12.000
Everything's proprietary.

23:12.000 --> 23:16.000
Proprietary software is not ethical.

23:16.000 --> 23:19.000
One day you'll have that last cheeseburger.

23:19.000 --> 23:22.000
Right, but yeah, you're making software,

23:22.000 --> 23:25.000
and I'm sure if your customers were like, let's make it open source.

23:25.000 --> 23:26.000
Okay, cool.

23:26.000 --> 23:27.000
Then I would go with it.

23:27.000 --> 23:31.000
And I will say we contribute back as much as our customers allow us to,

23:31.000 --> 23:33.000
which I know is like a lame defense,

23:33.000 --> 23:36.000
but unfortunately that's the way contracts are in.

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
I don't want to get into it too much.

23:38.000 --> 23:39.000
Yeah, you're running a business.

23:39.000 --> 23:40.000
You've got bills to pay.

23:40.000 --> 23:41.000
We'll move on.

23:41.000 --> 23:42.000
We're a consulting.

23:42.000 --> 23:43.000
We're a dev shop.

23:43.000 --> 23:45.000
We are at the mercy of our customers.

23:45.000 --> 23:46.000
Yeah.

23:46.000 --> 23:51.000
Well, it turns out that our exact use case was completely okay under the GPL.

23:51.000 --> 23:52.000
Oh, really?

23:52.000 --> 23:56.000
Regardless of what the person you talked to at the organization told you.

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
As long as they could upgrade the version of Q

23:58.000 --> 24:02.000
and put another Q binary in the place of the Q we were giving them,

24:02.000 --> 24:03.000
then we're fine.

24:03.000 --> 24:04.000
Really?

24:04.000 --> 24:10.000
So this is kind of a, because we got a lot of feedback on this, Wes.

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
We got a lot of feedback on this Q stuff.

24:12.000 --> 24:16.000
If you are considering Q for a project, check out this video.

24:16.000 --> 24:19.000
I have to say it hasn't changed my position

24:19.000 --> 24:24.000
only because in the intervening time I now have a major project written on.NET.

24:24.000 --> 24:25.000
I've joined the.NET Foundation.

24:25.000 --> 24:28.000
We've open sourced.NET code.

24:28.000 --> 24:31.000
You found a new home.

24:31.000 --> 24:33.000
I sort of got married, right?

24:33.000 --> 24:35.000
We're doing a lot of.NET work.

24:35.000 --> 24:42.000
I can't deny that I would have preferred to have originally shipped this in Q,

24:42.000 --> 24:49.000
but when the rep tells you that you'll be in violation of the license,

24:49.000 --> 24:52.000
you don't do it, right?

24:52.000 --> 24:55.000
That's just, that's life.

24:55.000 --> 24:56.000
Right.

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
That's just a bad idea.

24:58.000 --> 25:02.000
We see this all the time, any kind of lack of clarity in licensing,

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
it's not a good risk that you can take.

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
You're just asking for a lawsuit down the road.

25:06.000 --> 25:07.000
Right.

25:07.000 --> 25:11.000
And for a little company like the Mad Botter, we would be destroyed by that.

25:11.000 --> 25:12.000
It would be bang.

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
It would kill us.

25:14.000 --> 25:19.000
Reflecting back on it now that you're here and on the other side of this little debacle,

25:19.000 --> 25:21.000
did you like the?

25:21.000 --> 25:25.000
Licensing aside, what was the difference like?

25:25.000 --> 25:27.000
You had to switch all kinds of stuff.

25:27.000 --> 25:28.000
You know what?

25:28.000 --> 25:29.000
I liked Q.

25:29.000 --> 25:34.000
As an experienced Objective-C developer, which I have to mention in every show,

25:34.000 --> 25:38.000
C++ is very comfortable for me to work in, but I have to be honest with you.

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
I'm going to answer a different question.

25:40.000 --> 25:43.000
I should have listened to the JB community.

25:43.000 --> 25:44.000
Yeah, that's just always true.

25:44.000 --> 25:48.000
They were, and you can scroll up in Telegram, they were hollering at me that,

25:48.000 --> 25:51.000
you are not violating the license.

25:51.000 --> 25:52.000
Go ahead and ship.

25:52.000 --> 25:54.000
Don't worry about it.

25:54.000 --> 25:57.000
And you know what, they were absolutely correct.

25:57.000 --> 26:01.000
Now, they did not offer to pay your legal bills if they were wrong, but it's good advice.

26:01.000 --> 26:07.000
The GPL is, I got to tell you, the GPL is a tough document to really understand, right?

26:07.000 --> 26:10.000
Especially the V3 version with the TiVo.

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
Yeah, anti-TiVoization stuff.

26:12.000 --> 26:14.000
What is TiVoization, right?

26:14.000 --> 26:18.000
If I showed them a demo on a computer that I own, is that like TiVoization?

26:18.000 --> 26:21.000
It's all crazy.

26:21.000 --> 26:27.000
I would say that, it's funny, the things I like about Q are not the things the salesman wants to sell you on.

26:27.000 --> 26:30.000
So, yeah, just maybe expand a little bit on that last point.

26:30.000 --> 26:33.000
So, the things you like versus what they're actually trying to make money on?

26:33.000 --> 26:34.000
Sure.

26:34.000 --> 26:40.000
So, a lot of effort has gone into not have you write into C++ for Q.

26:40.000 --> 26:44.000
And I'm not talking about QML, which is for those who don't know QML.

26:44.000 --> 26:46.000
QML is like their markup language.

26:46.000 --> 26:49.000
It can do some logic, but think of it like...

26:49.000 --> 26:52.000
It's like presentation versus code, kind of, right?

26:52.000 --> 26:55.000
Yeah, think about Android XML.

26:55.000 --> 26:58.000
You can do some stuff, but not...

26:58.000 --> 27:04.000
You're not going to write your whole app in QML if your app is as complicated as the radar display, for sure.

27:04.000 --> 27:06.000
Right, yeah, absolutely.

27:06.000 --> 27:09.000
But there's a Python extension to Q that we actually covered on the show.

27:09.000 --> 27:11.000
There's JavaScript extensions.

27:11.000 --> 27:16.000
So, adding more bindings, adding more ways to use Q without having to use C++.

27:16.000 --> 27:19.000
I think there's a Java one, but I'm not entirely...

27:19.000 --> 27:24.000
I think that might be a community project, not an officially blessed one.

27:24.000 --> 27:27.000
But I liked it because it was C++, right?

27:27.000 --> 27:31.000
And that, you know, for my business as a dev shop, just saying,

27:31.000 --> 27:37.000
okay, we all have to work in C++ would really simplify everything that I'm doing.

27:37.000 --> 27:40.000
Yeah, and I imagine that that's not an uncommon choice

27:40.000 --> 27:44.000
in some of the areas that you're playing with in aerospace or aeronautics.

27:44.000 --> 27:48.000
Finally, yeah. I mean, we kind of gloss over this, but we build web systems all the time.

27:48.000 --> 27:53.000
But our niche is really aerospace.

27:53.000 --> 27:56.000
I'm still surprised we don't talk about Ada more often.

27:56.000 --> 27:58.000
We could.

27:58.000 --> 28:01.000
That's for another show.

28:01.000 --> 28:04.000
I don't know how to do that in a 45-minute format.

28:04.000 --> 28:05.000
Oh, man, we should, actually.

28:05.000 --> 28:09.000
Ada was one of the first languages I studied in my own computer science education.

28:09.000 --> 28:11.000
I tell you what, then.

28:11.000 --> 28:14.000
My birthday's in June. We can have a Mike's Birthday episode,

28:14.000 --> 28:16.000
and you and I can go 13 rounds on Ada.

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
Yeah, I'm looking forward to it.

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
All right.

28:20.000 --> 28:23.000
But obviously, so like, okay, so since Wes brought it up,

28:23.000 --> 28:26.000
in the aerospace industry, there's a few standards, right?

28:26.000 --> 28:30.000
There is old stuff. I call it Ada.

28:30.000 --> 28:35.000
There's like down to the hardware C, C++, which is where I kind of need to be.

28:35.000 --> 28:38.000
There's.NET. There's like a lot of.NET.

28:38.000 --> 28:39.000
Oh, really?

28:39.000 --> 28:42.000
Yeah, there's a lot of.NET.

28:42.000 --> 28:46.000
There's some Java on the back-of-office stuff, but very rare.

28:46.000 --> 28:50.000
To be honest, you're looking at C++ and.NET and some Ada,

28:50.000 --> 28:54.000
but that's like, Ada's its own thing.

28:54.000 --> 28:57.000
Maybe a better way to say it is you have embedded,

28:57.000 --> 29:00.000
you have application, and then you have back-of-office.

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
Yes, that makes sense.

29:02.000 --> 29:07.000
The beautiful thing about Q was it could have been the embedded, the application,

29:07.000 --> 29:10.000
and the Rails could have still been the back-of-office, right?

29:10.000 --> 29:13.000
So you could have just knocked out those other two parts.

29:13.000 --> 29:16.000
You've already thrown everything else out,

29:16.000 --> 29:19.000
which from a hiring and management perspective

29:19.000 --> 29:22.000
would have made my life tremendously easier.

29:22.000 --> 29:26.000
So now, because of the licensing, I'll call it confusion,

29:26.000 --> 29:33.000
what's happened is embedded is Rust in one case,

29:33.000 --> 29:35.000
but also.NET,

29:35.000 --> 29:40.000
because it turns out Microsoft will throw money at any problem you put in front of them.

29:40.000 --> 29:43.000
Wait, really? I didn't know you could do embedded with.NET.

29:43.000 --> 29:47.000
You can do near-native performance C-sharp and F-sharp.

29:47.000 --> 29:50.000
And is that still with garbage collection in that,

29:50.000 --> 29:53.000
or is it a more minimal runtime?

29:53.000 --> 29:55.000
That's a simple question.

29:55.000 --> 29:57.000
Yes, you do have garbage collection,

29:57.000 --> 30:01.000
but not the normal garbage collection you have on...

30:01.000 --> 30:04.000
Different algorithms, a different garbage collector targeted for that.

30:04.000 --> 30:07.000
You also don't have the entire.NET ecosystem to work with.

30:07.000 --> 30:09.000
There's a NuGet, right?

30:09.000 --> 30:12.000
You can't pull in a NuGet package and be like,

30:12.000 --> 30:15.000
oh, great, it's very constrained.

30:15.000 --> 30:20.000
But if you use a constrained subset of the language and dependencies then?

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
And frankly, I've been unfair.

30:22.000 --> 30:25.000
When I said C-sharp, yes, it's possible,

30:25.000 --> 30:27.000
but I really mean F-sharp.

30:27.000 --> 30:29.000
We do F-sharp.

30:29.000 --> 30:31.000
I love that.

30:31.000 --> 30:35.000
Performance-wise, you're already paying a penalty for having the CLR,

30:35.000 --> 30:38.000
which for those who don't know is the Common Language Runtime,

30:38.000 --> 30:43.000
which if you're a Java developer, you have the JVM between Java.

30:43.000 --> 30:46.000
Google it if you don't know.

30:46.000 --> 30:50.000
And we do some.NET applications.

30:50.000 --> 30:53.000
A lot of, like, Gryphon itself is a.NET application.

30:53.000 --> 30:55.000
And we do some line-of-business apps,

30:55.000 --> 30:59.000
which could easily be written in.NET instead of Rails, right?

30:59.000 --> 31:02.000
But it didn't.

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
Like, that's where we are now.

31:04.000 --> 31:07.000
So the only differences between what I've just described

31:07.000 --> 31:09.000
and what we're doing is our back-of-office is Rails

31:09.000 --> 31:12.000
for reasons that we have our own stuff that works in Rails,

31:12.000 --> 31:14.000
and it's great.

31:14.000 --> 31:19.000
I don't understand, and maybe this is where Wes can help a little bit,

31:19.000 --> 31:25.000
why there's so much complication around the licensing of Q.

31:25.000 --> 31:28.000
I mean, even ignoring all the stuff I said about the CLR for.NET,

31:28.000 --> 31:31.000
ignore the technical details, which is weird for a show called Code Radio.

31:31.000 --> 31:34.000
The fact that you can't call a Qt rep

31:34.000 --> 31:38.000
and get a straight answer on something feels like a problem.

31:38.000 --> 31:41.000
Like, I don't know, I'm from New Jersey, right?

31:41.000 --> 31:44.000
If I ask you a question and you don't answer my questioning,

31:44.000 --> 31:49.000
like, I think it's because you want the right to sue me later.

31:49.000 --> 31:51.000
Right, yeah, that makes sense.

31:51.000 --> 31:54.000
So Wes, I don't know, I just threw a lot of data out.

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
What do you think?

31:56.000 --> 32:00.000
I can certainly understand why it would be attractive at C++,

32:00.000 --> 32:04.000
and even outside of that, there's plenty of bindings for things.

32:04.000 --> 32:09.000
I can see why the base fee might be a lot,

32:09.000 --> 32:13.000
because obviously it's all also GPL,

32:13.000 --> 32:16.000
so they have to have some sort of revenue stream.

32:16.000 --> 32:19.000
And that is why your point makes so much more sense,

32:19.000 --> 32:23.000
because why their whole thing should be to make it super simple,

32:23.000 --> 32:25.000
so that if you want to pay the money

32:25.000 --> 32:29.000
or even think that you might want to pay the money to negotiate with them,

32:29.000 --> 32:31.000
that should be clear and easy to do,

32:31.000 --> 32:34.000
because otherwise you're just going to be confused.

32:34.000 --> 32:35.000
If you can't get a clear answer

32:35.000 --> 32:38.000
when you have a complicated dual licensing sort of thing,

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
and you see it all the time on Hacker News or anything else

32:40.000 --> 32:43.000
for some new open core sort of system

32:43.000 --> 32:46.000
or all these various in-betweens on different open source styles

32:46.000 --> 32:48.000
of business running,

32:48.000 --> 32:50.000
and someone asks some questions about like,

32:50.000 --> 32:52.000
is this covered by the licensing?

32:52.000 --> 32:54.000
And someone immediately pops in the comments and goes,

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
oh, here, DM me. Let's talk about this offline.

32:56.000 --> 32:57.000
We'll get you all the information you need.

32:57.000 --> 33:00.000
Now, do we know how those conversations go all the time?

33:00.000 --> 33:01.000
Absolutely not.

33:01.000 --> 33:04.000
But you got to hope and assume that the majority of them

33:04.000 --> 33:07.000
are better than what you described.

33:07.000 --> 33:09.000
Yeah, and you know, in defense of Q,

33:09.000 --> 33:12.000
like the gentleman who I was talking to

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
has reached out to me several times.

33:14.000 --> 33:17.000
They are not happy that we went to.NET,

33:17.000 --> 33:21.000
and to say they're not happy is a giant understatement.

33:21.000 --> 33:25.000
They feel that basically, you know,

33:25.000 --> 33:27.000
the rep didn't understand our technical case,

33:27.000 --> 33:29.000
and it turns out we could have done it the whole time,

33:29.000 --> 33:31.000
blah, blah, blah, right?

33:31.000 --> 33:32.000
Yeah.

33:32.000 --> 33:37.000
It's, you know, I am not the biggest,

33:37.000 --> 33:38.000
and we should move on,

33:38.000 --> 33:41.000
but I'm not the biggest GPL hippie on the network, right?

33:41.000 --> 33:46.000
Like I'm, you know, originally I was the iOS and Mac guy here.

33:46.000 --> 33:50.000
If you think that having GPL software in industry is good,

33:50.000 --> 33:55.000
you can't have this constant threat of legal action,

33:55.000 --> 33:59.000
because, you know, a lot of the big applications

33:59.000 --> 34:01.000
that you think about are written

34:01.000 --> 34:04.000
by small subcontracting companies like mine.

34:04.000 --> 34:06.000
And I'm not trying to like make this Mike's bitching hour,

34:06.000 --> 34:10.000
but like it just is the case that, you know,

34:10.000 --> 34:13.000
I have employees, right?

34:13.000 --> 34:15.000
Like I can't use technology

34:15.000 --> 34:18.000
that I think that I will be sued for.

34:18.000 --> 34:20.000
Does that?

34:20.000 --> 34:21.000
Oh, yeah, that's just absolutely.

34:21.000 --> 34:22.000
It's not just you.

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
It's not you as an individual person.

34:24.000 --> 34:25.000
You have a whole organization.

34:25.000 --> 34:26.000
Right.

34:26.000 --> 34:27.000
Like my employees have kids.

34:27.000 --> 34:30.000
Like there's a whole, like, you know,

34:30.000 --> 34:34.000
so I'm in this weird place where, again,

34:34.000 --> 34:35.000
I think.NET is great.

34:35.000 --> 34:37.000
I'm a member of the.NET Foundation.

34:37.000 --> 34:41.000
I support financially.NET projects.

34:41.000 --> 34:44.000
I would have preferred to use Qt,

34:44.000 --> 34:48.000
but because of the legal risk, I didn't.

34:48.000 --> 34:51.000
And, you know, I'm not, quote,

34:51.000 --> 34:53.000
a member of the open source community.

34:53.000 --> 34:54.000
I don't think I am.

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
That's Chris's thing and maybe your thing.

34:56.000 --> 35:03.000
But I think you all should think about that before you,

35:03.000 --> 35:06.000
I don't know, like we have the RMS stingers, right?

35:06.000 --> 35:07.000
We have the RMS sound bites.

35:07.000 --> 35:09.000
And it's like, well, the answer to that

35:09.000 --> 35:11.000
is I'm just not going to use it.

35:11.000 --> 35:12.000
Right.

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
If it's so difficult or off-putting, then.

35:14.000 --> 35:15.000
Or scary.

35:15.000 --> 35:16.000
If you can't give me a straight answer,

35:16.000 --> 35:19.000
are you going to sue me or are you not?

35:19.000 --> 35:20.000
Yeah.

35:20.000 --> 35:22.000
I like that because it is like people do think it's great.

35:22.000 --> 35:23.000
Right.

35:23.000 --> 35:25.000
I mean, Qt is popular for partly, I think,

35:25.000 --> 35:27.000
because, you know, it's easy to get started.

35:27.000 --> 35:29.000
All the advantages that come from open source.

35:29.000 --> 35:30.000
But you're right.

35:30.000 --> 35:33.000
Many businesses find the GPL to be toxic.

35:33.000 --> 35:35.000
And I think just some of this uncertainty

35:35.000 --> 35:36.000
is often the reason why,

35:36.000 --> 35:38.000
even if you get past the philosophy,

35:38.000 --> 35:39.000
even if you're like, yeah, you're right.

35:39.000 --> 35:41.000
I do want to give back.

35:41.000 --> 35:43.000
Well, you were trying.

35:43.000 --> 35:44.000
Well, we would contribute back.

35:44.000 --> 35:48.000
Like, the sick part is we have contributed back to.NET projects.

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
We've contributed back to Rust projects.

35:50.000 --> 35:55.000
Only because I could not justify the legal risk of using Qt

35:55.000 --> 35:57.000
is why we didn't do it.

35:57.000 --> 35:58.000
Hmm.

35:58.000 --> 35:59.000
That makes a lot of sense.

35:59.000 --> 36:00.000
That's an interesting case study.

36:00.000 --> 36:02.000
And I think something we'll have to watch.

36:02.000 --> 36:04.000
I'm kind of happy about it,

36:04.000 --> 36:06.000
just because I think it did mean it gave you,

36:06.000 --> 36:09.000
it forced you to do a little bit more Rust.

36:09.000 --> 36:12.000
And that has led to a lot of great content for this show

36:12.000 --> 36:14.000
and our next story today.

36:14.000 --> 36:17.000
You know, Wes, I'd like to put a pin in this if I can.

36:17.000 --> 36:19.000
Oh, please do.

36:19.000 --> 36:20.000
Rust is moving fast.

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
So by the time this airs,

36:22.000 --> 36:24.000
I'm sure there'll be five more versions.

36:24.000 --> 36:30.000
But in Rust version 1.33.0, it adds pinning.

36:30.000 --> 36:32.000
Wes, are you familiar with pinning?

36:32.000 --> 36:36.000
I mean, I think in the general case, but not for Rust.

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
So tell me about this.

36:38.000 --> 36:42.000
So I'm going to, again, this is a 45-minute radio show,

36:42.000 --> 36:46.000
so you can pin a certain, let's say, object,

36:46.000 --> 36:49.000
which do not throw things at me, Rust people.

36:49.000 --> 36:51.000
You know, let's say data structure.

36:51.000 --> 36:52.000
Yeah, that's a better term.

36:52.000 --> 36:54.000
And so just to clarify,

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
this is a Rust-specific thing called pinning,

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
not related to dependencies

36:58.000 --> 37:01.000
or, like, the other things I might think about.

37:01.000 --> 37:02.000
You know, this is in the language,

37:02.000 --> 37:05.000
but you have to be on Rust 1.33 or up, right?

37:05.000 --> 37:10.000
So basically, you have a pin type and an unpin marker trait,

37:10.000 --> 37:12.000
which there's a lot of words there.

37:12.000 --> 37:16.000
So basically, the object, actually, they use object.

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
I'm surprised they use object and not data structure.

37:18.000 --> 37:21.000
That's very interesting to me in the documentation.

37:21.000 --> 37:24.000
Basically, making something a pin

37:24.000 --> 37:27.000
means it will not move in physical memory.

37:27.000 --> 37:29.000
So let's get our oscilloscopes

37:29.000 --> 37:33.000
and let's get down into our RAM, boys and girls.

37:33.000 --> 37:37.000
Literally, the object that you have created as a pin

37:37.000 --> 37:40.000
is not going to move on the physical RAM.

37:40.000 --> 37:43.000
That's in a simplified version of what's happening here.

37:43.000 --> 37:45.000
Yes, I know there's different cases for swap.

37:45.000 --> 37:48.000
Please don't email in, but yeah.

37:48.000 --> 37:49.000
Right, right.

37:49.000 --> 37:51.000
Yeah, the different levels of memory

37:51.000 --> 37:53.000
and the abstractions that you're specifically writing towards.

37:53.000 --> 37:55.000
So why did this stand out to you?

37:55.000 --> 37:57.000
I mean, I can see how it might be useful,

37:57.000 --> 37:59.000
but even as this blog post said,

37:59.000 --> 38:00.000
you know, they say,

38:00.000 --> 38:03.000
this feature will largely be used by library authors.

38:03.000 --> 38:05.000
And that makes me wonder, what are you doing with it?

38:05.000 --> 38:07.000
Nothing yet.

38:07.000 --> 38:11.000
But, and bringing it back to.NET.

38:11.000 --> 38:14.000
So.NET introduced async await,

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
which is an easy way to do concurrency

38:16.000 --> 38:18.000
where the code looks procedural,

38:18.000 --> 38:20.000
but actually like spins up a million threads

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
and does whatever the hell it needs to do.

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
You might use this for long running operations,

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
for network calls,

38:26.000 --> 38:29.000
or if you've ever worked with BLE,

38:29.000 --> 38:31.000
you probably use it a lot because Bluetooth low energy

38:31.000 --> 38:35.000
is surprisingly not reliable.

38:35.000 --> 38:36.000
No, not at all.

38:36.000 --> 38:37.000
Not at all.

38:37.000 --> 38:39.000
And we've seen that pattern, right?

38:39.000 --> 38:41.000
.NET developed it, or fleshed out at least that implementation.

38:41.000 --> 38:43.000
Yeah, Microsoft came up with it.

38:43.000 --> 38:45.000
But we've seen it move.

38:45.000 --> 38:47.000
Yeah, like you can do it in JavaScript,

38:47.000 --> 38:48.000
you can do it in Python.

38:48.000 --> 38:49.000
Java has it now, actually.

38:49.000 --> 38:50.000
Yeah.

38:50.000 --> 38:52.000
For some weird version of it.

38:52.000 --> 38:54.000
So this is the first step, or maybe not the first,

38:54.000 --> 38:56.000
but this is a step towards async await and Rust,

38:56.000 --> 38:58.000
which you may think, okay, why do we want that?

38:58.000 --> 39:02.000
And then Rust, that's usually used as a lower level language.

39:02.000 --> 39:03.000
But think about it.

39:03.000 --> 39:05.000
Do you want to write all these cases,

39:05.000 --> 39:07.000
or do you want to have something, you know,

39:07.000 --> 39:09.000
that in six months when you come back to read the code,

39:09.000 --> 39:11.000
it's a lot simpler to understand?

39:11.000 --> 39:13.000
Yeah, it's a nice option, right?

39:13.000 --> 39:15.000
Maybe in some hot inner loop somewhere,

39:15.000 --> 39:18.000
you can't use it, or you need to roll your own locking

39:18.000 --> 39:20.000
and threading and all that.

39:20.000 --> 39:22.000
But if you don't have to, right,

39:22.000 --> 39:24.000
because basically this stuff all generates

39:24.000 --> 39:27.000
these complicated state machines and callbacks

39:27.000 --> 39:30.000
I don't want to write that.

39:30.000 --> 39:32.000
Well, right, it's going to be like.NET

39:32.000 --> 39:34.000
where there's a bunch of crazy cases where async await

39:34.000 --> 39:36.000
makes no sense and you have to write everything yourself

39:36.000 --> 39:38.000
just like you used to.

39:38.000 --> 39:42.000
But for, you know, 90% of the cases, this is the answer.

39:42.000 --> 39:45.000
And it seems like it could be especially useful in Rust as,

39:45.000 --> 39:47.000
you know, it's already lower level,

39:47.000 --> 39:49.000
so if this can make something just a little bit easier,

39:49.000 --> 39:52.000
as you said, to come back to understand and to work on again,

39:52.000 --> 39:53.000
I'm all for it.

39:53.000 --> 39:55.000
Yeah, I think it's a great addition.

39:55.000 --> 40:01.000
I'm very curious to see how Rust is going to implement async await,

40:01.000 --> 40:03.000
and I think, you know, we're just going to have to wait for that.

40:03.000 --> 40:09.000
But I have lots of questions about how that's going to work,

40:09.000 --> 40:12.000
particularly in an embedded context.

40:12.000 --> 40:15.000
Yes, you might have a lot of concerns about how that works.

40:15.000 --> 40:17.000
Yeah, and maybe it just won't, right?

40:17.000 --> 40:19.000
But, you know, we'll see.

40:19.000 --> 40:20.000
Interesting.

40:20.000 --> 40:21.000
That's certainly an evolving story.

40:21.000 --> 40:24.000
And, you know, as you said, Rust is moving fast.

40:24.000 --> 40:26.000
That might be a feature.

40:26.000 --> 40:29.000
That might just be the next thing that I really have to just bite the bullet

40:29.000 --> 40:31.000
and dig more into Rust.

40:31.000 --> 40:32.000
That's right.

40:32.000 --> 40:35.000
So I hear you're writing this new hot language from Microsoft twice.

40:35.000 --> 40:37.000
What's going on here?

40:37.000 --> 40:38.000
Yeah, Rust.

40:38.000 --> 40:40.000
That's so old and busted, Mike.

40:40.000 --> 40:42.000
I'm writing BOSQ.

40:42.000 --> 40:44.000
I don't know if we decided how to pronounce it.

40:44.000 --> 40:49.000
B-O-S-Q-U-E.

40:49.000 --> 40:53.000
And it was just announced this previous week.

40:53.000 --> 40:58.000
It derives from a combination of TypeScript-inspired syntax and types,

40:58.000 --> 41:04.000
plus some ML, meaning the ML family of languages, not machine learning,

41:04.000 --> 41:07.000
and Node and JavaScript-inspired semantics.

41:07.000 --> 41:10.000
And the words of my cousin Teal, your words mean nothing to me.

41:10.000 --> 41:14.000
Basically, it seems like, and we should be clear off the top, as they say,

41:14.000 --> 41:19.000
as the project lead himself says, this is a research project.

41:19.000 --> 41:21.000
It's not meant to be your new production language.

41:21.000 --> 41:25.000
It's just something Microsoft's playing with as ways to start exploring

41:25.000 --> 41:28.000
how to make programming better.

41:28.000 --> 41:30.000
And that actually seems to be one of their big pushes here,

41:30.000 --> 41:37.000
because they're almost preaching it as a new way to approach programming.

41:37.000 --> 41:39.000
So there's a paper that's out by Mark Maron,

41:39.000 --> 41:44.000
and he calls it out right at the top, regularized programming.

41:44.000 --> 41:47.000
And the comparison is to the old style of what was called

41:47.000 --> 41:50.000
structured programming, right?

41:50.000 --> 41:53.000
You know, I don't love the way it looks,

41:53.000 --> 41:56.000
but I think there are a lot of interesting ideas here.

41:56.000 --> 42:01.000
And I think in the spirit of a lot of people that I find inspiring,

42:01.000 --> 42:04.000
I think that regardless of the specifics of this implementation,

42:04.000 --> 42:07.000
which we can talk more about because there are some interesting concepts in here,

42:07.000 --> 42:10.000
I think the main goal of trying to reduce complexity

42:10.000 --> 42:16.000
and making and designing languages with that as one of the primary

42:16.000 --> 42:20.000
motivating factors is very much something I like.

42:20.000 --> 42:22.000
I have been reading, I've read through the GitHub,

42:22.000 --> 42:24.000
I've read both the articles we have in the show notes.

42:24.000 --> 42:26.000
What is new about this language?

42:26.000 --> 42:31.000
I mean, it's taking the ideas and the concepts in terms of, you know,

42:31.000 --> 42:36.000
methodological concepts of strong typing and those of functional programming

42:36.000 --> 42:39.000
and just basically merging them together.

42:39.000 --> 42:44.000
Like, what am I missing, right?

42:44.000 --> 42:46.000
Yeah, you're right.

42:46.000 --> 42:49.000
I think it can be said that much of the stuff that's in here,

42:49.000 --> 42:51.000
I don't know about what other languages are doing,

42:51.000 --> 42:54.000
like one of the features is this typed string sort of thing,

42:54.000 --> 42:57.000
where just like a way to declare types of strings

42:57.000 --> 43:00.000
and lift some of the identification into the type system.

43:00.000 --> 43:02.000
Strings are terrible, yes.

43:02.000 --> 43:05.000
Right, and we often end up just programming with a whole bunch of strings

43:05.000 --> 43:07.000
we pass around.

43:07.000 --> 43:09.000
But you are right, that much of this stuff,

43:09.000 --> 43:15.000
and I guess they almost say it themselves, that is flowing out of research,

43:15.000 --> 43:17.000
out of other things that have already been implemented

43:17.000 --> 43:20.000
or are seen in other languages and communities.

43:20.000 --> 43:24.000
Like, you know, there are no explicit looping constructs in Bosque.

43:24.000 --> 43:26.000
I like that, I think that's good,

43:26.000 --> 43:29.000
but there are plenty of other languages that lack that.

43:29.000 --> 43:32.000
Okay, but like there's also like, I don't know,

43:32.000 --> 43:36.000
you can like do a map over things, right?

43:36.000 --> 43:40.000
Like, isn't that just going to become the poor man's loop,

43:40.000 --> 43:42.000
or am I just being overly cynical here?

43:42.000 --> 43:47.000
Well, sure, but when you, and in the simple cases, it already is.

43:47.000 --> 43:49.000
But even when you just have math, right,

43:49.000 --> 43:51.000
you've already de-complected something,

43:51.000 --> 43:55.000
because in the simple case, sure, a loop is basically just the same thing,

43:55.000 --> 43:58.000
you're iterating over each item and then doing something,

43:58.000 --> 44:00.000
but it can get more complicated,

44:00.000 --> 44:02.000
because you have an arbitrary scope inside there

44:02.000 --> 44:05.000
that you can just keep your own state, you can mess with stuff.

44:05.000 --> 44:09.000
It is not fundamentally tied to a mapping over one thing.

44:09.000 --> 44:12.000
And so I think that's the level that they're trying to get at here,

44:12.000 --> 44:15.000
is to say like, yes, you understand this,

44:15.000 --> 44:17.000
yes, these are equivalent in terms of theory,

44:17.000 --> 44:23.000
but this is a more ergonomic and safer way to model this program or this problem.

44:23.000 --> 44:26.000
And we think these should be the default tools available to you,

44:26.000 --> 44:29.000
not these older imperative style.

44:29.000 --> 44:32.000
Right, I agree with that.

44:32.000 --> 44:36.000
But like, Microsoft already has F Sharp.

44:36.000 --> 44:39.000
And TypeScript.

44:39.000 --> 44:42.000
I have lots of problems with TypeScript.

44:42.000 --> 44:44.000
You know I don't like TypeScript, right,

44:44.000 --> 44:47.000
but you should just learn ECMAScript and be done with it.

44:47.000 --> 44:54.000
But like, one of my hobby horses is that people writing these crazy algorithms in C Sharp

44:54.000 --> 44:57.000
and doing these like low-level projects

44:57.000 --> 45:01.000
where they need data integrity and all this kind of fun stuff

45:01.000 --> 45:04.000
ought to really be using F Sharp.

45:04.000 --> 45:06.000
And they're not.

45:06.000 --> 45:10.000
So, I mean, anything that's invented is great.

45:10.000 --> 45:12.000
I don't want to like take away from that.

45:12.000 --> 45:17.000
But F Sharp solves many of these problems.

45:17.000 --> 45:21.000
Maybe not in the same way, like the whole scoping thing, fair enough.

45:21.000 --> 45:24.000
But I don't know.

45:24.000 --> 45:27.000
If I were the Microsoft language team, I might,

45:27.000 --> 45:31.000
like, you know this, Wes, it's my hobby horse, right,

45:31.000 --> 45:35.000
.NET developers who aren't data scientists,

45:35.000 --> 45:38.000
because data scientists love F Sharp,

45:38.000 --> 45:41.000
need to pay more attention to F Sharp.

45:41.000 --> 45:44.000
It's just, it's a really good language.

45:44.000 --> 45:49.000
And it solves many of the problems that BOSK,

45:49.000 --> 45:52.000
is that what we decided, BOSK or BOSK?

45:52.000 --> 45:55.000
We're just going to use both, and we'll see what happens.

45:55.000 --> 45:57.000
Like, claims to solve, and I'm not like,

45:57.000 --> 45:59.000
this is definitely an achievement.

45:59.000 --> 46:04.000
But, I mean, F Sharp.org guys, it's great, trust me.

46:04.000 --> 46:08.000
Like, it's, it'll change your life.

46:08.000 --> 46:10.000
No, I mean, you are right.

46:10.000 --> 46:14.000
And I've seen some commentary kind of wondering,

46:14.000 --> 46:16.000
like, is this just some sort of power grab?

46:16.000 --> 46:20.000
These ideas don't look new, just like you were saying, right?

46:20.000 --> 46:22.000
And so it depends on how much you read.

46:22.000 --> 46:23.000
Are these claims?

46:23.000 --> 46:25.000
This exists in another Microsoft language.

46:25.000 --> 46:26.000
It's called F Sharp.

46:26.000 --> 46:27.000
Like, sorry to interrupt,

46:27.000 --> 46:30.000
but that's my entire criticism of this, right?

46:30.000 --> 46:33.000
Like, we should make F Sharp better,

46:33.000 --> 46:36.000
because it's already awesome.

46:36.000 --> 46:39.000
You know, I think that is reasonable.

46:39.000 --> 46:42.000
Thank you.

46:42.000 --> 46:45.000
I will say, I do believe that there's value

46:45.000 --> 46:47.000
in further exploring this stuff.

46:47.000 --> 46:48.000
Oh, yeah, no, no.

46:48.000 --> 46:50.000
I'm not saying we shouldn't have new languages.

46:50.000 --> 46:51.000
I'm just saying like,

46:51.000 --> 46:53.000
maybe that energy is being spent here,

46:53.000 --> 46:55.000
but not necessarily like you're saying.

46:55.000 --> 46:58.000
Like, we could be evangelizing more for F Sharp

46:58.000 --> 47:01.000
and talking about F Sharp with some of the time

47:01.000 --> 47:03.000
that we're using right now, even here.

47:03.000 --> 47:04.000
Right.

47:04.000 --> 47:06.000
So let me make an argument by parallel, right?

47:06.000 --> 47:08.000
When Canonical did a bunch of crack

47:08.000 --> 47:09.000
and decided to make Unity.

47:09.000 --> 47:11.000
I remember the days.

47:11.000 --> 47:14.000
That was a bad idea that did not work out.

47:14.000 --> 47:15.000
I mean, I think some people,

47:15.000 --> 47:18.000
Unity 7 lovers would perhaps disagree,

47:18.000 --> 47:19.000
but you're right.

47:19.000 --> 47:20.000
I mean, they're no longer doing it.

47:20.000 --> 47:21.000
Right.

47:21.000 --> 47:23.000
But you could re-implement the Unity style in Gnome

47:23.000 --> 47:25.000
very easily via extensions.

47:25.000 --> 47:27.000
And I'm sorry, non-Linux users,

47:27.000 --> 47:29.000
but go down this road with me.

47:29.000 --> 47:31.000
There is a limited amount

47:31.000 --> 47:34.000
of deep engineering expertise to be used.

47:34.000 --> 47:38.000
Like, these are literally concepts that like,

47:38.000 --> 47:40.000
when I talk to C Sharp developers

47:40.000 --> 47:42.000
who are like doing large data things

47:42.000 --> 47:43.000
or like mathematical processing,

47:43.000 --> 47:45.000
they're like, oh,.NET sucks.

47:45.000 --> 47:47.000
I'm like, actually, no.

47:47.000 --> 47:48.000
It's C Sharp.

47:48.000 --> 47:49.000
It just isn't meant for this, right?

47:49.000 --> 47:51.000
C Sharp is an object-oriented language

47:51.000 --> 47:52.000
that is meant to build you

47:52.000 --> 47:55.000
a pretty battleship-grade web application.

47:55.000 --> 47:57.000
And these days, you know, a server app,

47:57.000 --> 48:00.000
if you want to do ASP core.

48:00.000 --> 48:02.000
Or even back in the day, ASP.NET.

48:02.000 --> 48:03.000
Right.

48:03.000 --> 48:05.000
But it's not necessarily there to do your, like,

48:05.000 --> 48:07.000
high-level data processing pipelines.

48:07.000 --> 48:08.000
Mm-hmm.

48:08.000 --> 48:09.000
Right.

48:09.000 --> 48:10.000
There is a solution.

48:10.000 --> 48:13.000
And the beautiful thing about.NET

48:13.000 --> 48:16.000
and the CLR is you can mix F Sharp and C Sharp.

48:16.000 --> 48:19.000
You can have an entire module in F Sharp

48:19.000 --> 48:22.000
that just, like, does all of that.

48:22.000 --> 48:25.000
So, like, if Bosque, I'm calling it Bosque,

48:25.000 --> 48:30.000
I just made a decision, is better, fabulous, right?

48:30.000 --> 48:32.000
Like, I am not, I am all, you know what?

48:32.000 --> 48:33.000
I'm using Rust.

48:33.000 --> 48:36.000
It's hard to be more hipster than Rust.

48:36.000 --> 48:40.000
But it's weird to me that the same company,

48:40.000 --> 48:41.000
like, you know what?

48:41.000 --> 48:42.000
JetBrains has Kotlin.

48:42.000 --> 48:45.000
They're not, like, competing with themselves, right?

48:45.000 --> 48:47.000
Mm, yeah.

48:47.000 --> 48:51.000
So, like, where does F Sharp and Bosque begin?

48:51.000 --> 48:53.000
Like, from what I've read on the GitHub page

48:53.000 --> 48:57.000
and the commits, Bosque is maybe a more pure implementation,

48:57.000 --> 49:00.000
where F Sharp is kind of in this weird space

49:00.000 --> 49:02.000
of having to be married to, like,

49:02.000 --> 49:04.000
we have to be compatible with the CLR and C Sharp

49:04.000 --> 49:05.000
and blah, blah, blah.

49:05.000 --> 49:06.000
Yeah, so I think there is that.

49:06.000 --> 49:09.000
Like, it is, you know, they've built it on top.

49:09.000 --> 49:12.000
I think it's implemented mostly in TypeScript right now.

49:12.000 --> 49:14.000
So it's built on a different runtime,

49:14.000 --> 49:15.000
which is kind of interesting.

49:15.000 --> 49:19.000
Also, I would assume that Bosque in particular

49:19.000 --> 49:22.000
probably doesn't run hardly anywhere in the future.

49:22.000 --> 49:24.000
Like, I don't know that it will go anywhere.

49:24.000 --> 49:27.000
I bet we will see some ideas filter into F Sharp.

49:27.000 --> 49:29.000
I mean, that's a damn shame, though.

49:29.000 --> 49:31.000
Like, you know what?

49:31.000 --> 49:34.000
If I'm a shill, I'm an F Sharp shill, right?

49:34.000 --> 49:37.000
Like, I don't want Bosque to die.

49:37.000 --> 49:40.000
I would love Bosque to become one of these languages

49:40.000 --> 49:42.000
that compiles into WebAssembly.

49:42.000 --> 49:43.000
Is that crazy?

49:43.000 --> 49:45.000
No, no, I mean, I think actually,

49:45.000 --> 49:48.000
I think that's on something that they're interested in.

49:48.000 --> 49:50.000
So it is, I think it's just an interesting,

49:50.000 --> 49:52.000
I mean, just that we hadn't talked about this at all

49:52.000 --> 49:53.000
and that you had these thoughts

49:53.000 --> 49:56.000
and we've had such disparate views here.

49:56.000 --> 49:58.000
If this, even if this isn't the thing,

49:58.000 --> 50:00.000
you know, isn't the next playground,

50:00.000 --> 50:03.000
clearly people care about this stuff

50:03.000 --> 50:04.000
and maybe that's enough, right?

50:04.000 --> 50:05.000
Like, so Vocal Point,

50:05.000 --> 50:07.000
and they've already had a lot of issues opened up

50:07.000 --> 50:09.000
on the GitHub project kind of reflecting on that.

50:09.000 --> 50:10.000
How are we going to do, right?

50:10.000 --> 50:11.000
There was questions about

50:11.000 --> 50:15.000
how might this language handle asynchronous programming?

50:15.000 --> 50:18.000
So there's lots to be left there.

50:18.000 --> 50:19.000
I don't know.

50:19.000 --> 50:22.000
I think it is trying to still find the right fit of,

50:22.000 --> 50:24.000
you know, how do we combine all of these new ideas

50:24.000 --> 50:26.000
that different languages have

50:26.000 --> 50:28.000
and what does it look like to have all of them in one place?

50:28.000 --> 50:32.000
And can that be simple, functional, and pleasant to you?

50:32.000 --> 50:33.000
No, I think it's great.

50:33.000 --> 50:35.000
I mean, Wes, can I make a crazy prediction

50:35.000 --> 50:37.000
that we'll cover in a year from now?

50:37.000 --> 50:38.000
Yes, you can.

50:38.000 --> 50:40.000
I think what's going to happen

50:40.000 --> 50:42.000
is that functional programming

50:42.000 --> 50:44.000
is actually going to become the default.

50:44.000 --> 50:46.000
I sure hope you're right.

50:46.000 --> 50:48.000
You know, I think last week,

50:48.000 --> 50:50.000
we talked about Dr. Armstrong, right?

50:50.000 --> 50:51.000
The creator of Erlang.

50:51.000 --> 50:53.000
And he had a paper, what is it?

50:53.000 --> 50:55.000
OO Sucks, right?

50:55.000 --> 50:56.000
Is that right?

50:56.000 --> 50:59.000
Yeah, there's one of his older blog articles.

50:59.000 --> 51:02.000
I think he's right, actually.

51:02.000 --> 51:05.000
The more complicated applications I've had to write,

51:05.000 --> 51:07.000
the less and less I've wanted to architect things

51:07.000 --> 51:09.000
in an object-oriented way.

51:09.000 --> 51:12.000
I really do believe that if you're a young developer,

51:12.000 --> 51:14.000
because we get this email all the time,

51:14.000 --> 51:16.000
learn an OO language like Java or C Sharp

51:16.000 --> 51:18.000
just to be marketable to...

51:18.000 --> 51:20.000
You've got to be conversant with these

51:20.000 --> 51:22.000
because they are the dominant rare time.

51:22.000 --> 51:25.000
Well, there's hundreds of millions of lines of code in them, right?

51:25.000 --> 51:27.000
You're going to touch them.

51:27.000 --> 51:29.000
The future, you know what?

51:29.000 --> 51:32.000
Ring the bell, Wes. Ring it.

51:33.000 --> 51:35.000
Wes was right.

51:35.000 --> 51:37.000
It's going to be functional.

51:37.000 --> 51:39.000
Things like Clojure, things like Rust,

51:39.000 --> 51:41.000
things like Haskell, F Sharp.

51:41.000 --> 51:43.000
I have to throw my F Sharp in there

51:43.000 --> 51:45.000
because I'm defending it to my bloody death.

51:45.000 --> 51:47.000
That's the future.

51:47.000 --> 51:49.000
I can't tell you.

51:49.000 --> 51:51.000
I write tons of code for clients.

51:51.000 --> 51:53.000
I write tons of code for myself.

51:53.000 --> 51:55.000
Tons of open source.

51:55.000 --> 51:58.000
And for me, personally, at this juncture in my life,

51:58.000 --> 52:01.000
it's always the functional code that's most interesting

52:01.000 --> 52:03.000
because it's the algorithmic code.

52:03.000 --> 52:07.000
It's either doing the crazy 3D file processing

52:07.000 --> 52:10.000
or it's doing the, you know,

52:10.000 --> 52:14.000
like the new ML project coming on in a few weeks.

52:14.000 --> 52:16.000
Like, I don't know.

52:16.000 --> 52:18.000
OO is for Goobies.

52:18.000 --> 52:22.000
Send your hitmail to wes at jupiterbroadcasting.com.

52:22.000 --> 52:24.000
Well, and then even there, I think...

52:24.000 --> 52:25.000
You're right.

52:25.000 --> 52:28.000
I mean, it does pair well with there things like...

52:28.000 --> 52:30.000
It just has existed there for a long time.

52:30.000 --> 52:33.000
And there are good parts about a lot of the standards

52:33.000 --> 52:35.000
that get associated with object-oriented programming.

52:35.000 --> 52:38.000
I think, you know, the push towards polymorphism

52:38.000 --> 52:39.000
has been really good.

52:39.000 --> 52:42.000
And that generally has made programming better.

52:42.000 --> 52:45.000
And we have better ways to do abstractions.

52:45.000 --> 52:47.000
So I think we've learned, right?

52:47.000 --> 52:50.000
We've taken stuff like type classes or traits

52:50.000 --> 52:53.000
and been able to have that sort of stuff a la carte

52:53.000 --> 52:55.000
without having these imposed hierarchies

52:55.000 --> 52:58.000
and this rigid style.

52:58.000 --> 53:02.000
I also think you're right that frequently you can find...

53:02.000 --> 53:07.000
While it may be foreign and look just overly terse,

53:07.000 --> 53:10.000
you can get a really good coupling of the problem domain

53:10.000 --> 53:12.000
and then the code that's used to represent it

53:12.000 --> 53:13.000
when you've abstracted it well

53:13.000 --> 53:15.000
and you're using some of these functional paradigms

53:15.000 --> 53:17.000
because more and more it does look like

53:17.000 --> 53:20.000
just a data pipeline process.

53:20.000 --> 53:23.000
And you can understand in decomposed steps

53:23.000 --> 53:25.000
because composition is so important

53:25.000 --> 53:26.000
in functional programming.

53:26.000 --> 53:28.000
It's then easy to decompose

53:28.000 --> 53:30.000
and understand what each step is doing.

53:30.000 --> 53:33.000
Compare that with like a whole bunch of different objects

53:33.000 --> 53:35.000
all pulling strings on each other.

53:35.000 --> 53:37.000
It's just madness.

53:37.000 --> 53:39.000
Well, no, I think you're completely right, though.

53:39.000 --> 53:41.000
I mean, in terms of functional being better architected.

53:41.000 --> 53:42.000
But I think we should move on

53:42.000 --> 53:43.000
because I feel like we're getting...

53:43.000 --> 53:45.000
You know what, Wes?

53:45.000 --> 53:47.000
My beard...

53:47.000 --> 53:48.000
Do we even want to say...

53:48.000 --> 53:49.000
I don't want to say this on the air.

53:49.000 --> 53:50.000
You know, I'm going to say it anyway.

53:50.000 --> 53:52.000
I have gray in my beard now.

53:52.000 --> 53:55.000
Ooh, you're so distinguished, Mr. Dunham.

53:55.000 --> 53:56.000
No, you know what it is?

53:56.000 --> 53:58.000
I'm a has-been, just like Objective-C,

53:58.000 --> 54:01.000
which is still the one language to rule them all,

54:01.000 --> 54:03.000
one language to bind them all, one language...

54:03.000 --> 54:05.000
Never mind.

54:05.000 --> 54:06.000
What about...

54:06.000 --> 54:08.000
You know what I hate?

54:08.000 --> 54:11.000
Other than Swift developers, of course.

54:11.000 --> 54:13.000
What do you hate, Mike?

54:13.000 --> 54:14.000
Do you know?

54:14.000 --> 54:15.000
Thank you.

54:15.000 --> 54:19.000
I hate when I accidentally commit my AWS secrets

54:19.000 --> 54:22.000
into my damn GitLab account.

54:22.000 --> 54:24.000
Yeah, don't we all?

54:24.000 --> 54:25.000
It's a B.

54:25.000 --> 54:28.000
Yeah, I saw this thing out from AWS Labs,

54:28.000 --> 54:31.000
which is part of the AWS's open source work.

54:31.000 --> 54:33.000
Yes, it exists, if you didn't know that.

54:33.000 --> 54:35.000
Actually, they do a fair bit

54:35.000 --> 54:37.000
that you just don't always hear about it.

54:37.000 --> 54:38.000
I thought they hated Linux.

54:38.000 --> 54:39.000
Wait a minute.

54:39.000 --> 54:40.000
I thought they just forked everything

54:40.000 --> 54:42.000
and just went on their own.

54:42.000 --> 54:44.000
Yeah, unless you follow their developer blogs,

54:44.000 --> 54:47.000
it can be sometimes hard to notice all the open source work.

54:47.000 --> 54:49.000
But they employ so many people

54:49.000 --> 54:53.000
and obviously are built on so much open source technology.

54:53.000 --> 54:56.000
You kind of just have to end up giving back.

54:56.000 --> 54:58.000
I've played with a couple other sort of solutions for this,

54:58.000 --> 54:59.000
like what's it called?

54:59.000 --> 55:01.000
I think Truffle Hound is one

55:01.000 --> 55:04.000
that basically just looks for high entropy strings

55:04.000 --> 55:07.000
in your repositories and alerts you to them.

55:07.000 --> 55:10.000
Git Secrets is a little bit different

55:10.000 --> 55:12.000
and it does have some sort of configuration

55:12.000 --> 55:16.000
so that it, by default, understands AWS.

55:16.000 --> 55:19.000
So if you're a big AWS user and you really...

55:19.000 --> 55:20.000
One of the first things,

55:20.000 --> 55:22.000
especially when you're setting up in an AWS environment,

55:22.000 --> 55:23.000
you've got to like,

55:23.000 --> 55:25.000
all right, I go figure out my different credentials

55:25.000 --> 55:27.000
and I've got to get my system provisioned and set up

55:27.000 --> 55:28.000
so it can talk to AWS

55:28.000 --> 55:30.000
and then run against the staging environment.

55:30.000 --> 55:31.000
But I need those credentials over here,

55:31.000 --> 55:33.000
but I really then need the production credentials

55:33.000 --> 55:35.000
when I switch to broad and how do I do that?

55:35.000 --> 55:36.000
And it shouldn't be in the repo.

55:36.000 --> 55:38.000
And especially maybe you're working with multiple teams

55:38.000 --> 55:41.000
or some sort of contracting company you've hired.

55:41.000 --> 55:42.000
Just a mistake.

55:42.000 --> 55:43.000
And if you've ever had to go back

55:43.000 --> 55:45.000
and clean up secrets out of a repository,

55:45.000 --> 55:46.000
secrets are annoying.

55:46.000 --> 55:49.000
I have not used Git Secrets,

55:49.000 --> 55:50.000
but I just thought it was neat

55:50.000 --> 55:52.000
that there was a semi-first-party solution

55:52.000 --> 55:53.000
from Amazon for this.

55:53.000 --> 55:55.000
I don't know how easy it would be to make this work

55:55.000 --> 55:59.000
for secrets for other cloud providers or other projects.

55:59.000 --> 56:00.000
Maybe go give it a try.

56:00.000 --> 56:02.000
Or, dear audience member,

56:02.000 --> 56:04.000
perhaps you have a preferred solution for this.

56:04.000 --> 56:06.000
You've already got it integrated with your CI system

56:06.000 --> 56:08.000
because you're just that cool.

56:08.000 --> 56:11.000
Let us know, coder.show slash contact.

56:11.000 --> 56:15.000
Now, Mike, I know you, being the generous soul that you are,

56:15.000 --> 56:18.000
well, you've got something of a contest going on, don't you?

56:18.000 --> 56:22.000
Yeah, so I would prefer that my son not die in floods

56:22.000 --> 56:25.000
or, you know, like, you know, arid landscapes.

56:25.000 --> 56:27.000
I'm going to second you on that one.

56:27.000 --> 56:28.000
Thank you.

56:28.000 --> 56:31.000
And this extends to everybody's children, right?

56:31.000 --> 56:33.000
Sons, daughters, whatever.

56:33.000 --> 56:37.000
So we at the Mad Botter are sponsoring a little competition.

56:37.000 --> 56:39.000
Now, you have till the end of May.

56:39.000 --> 56:43.000
If you are a high school or middle school student

56:43.000 --> 56:45.000
or indeed you know one, please share the info.

56:45.000 --> 56:50.000
Write up with a technical diagram and a project synopsis

56:50.000 --> 56:54.000
your plan to combat global warming using Linux.

56:54.000 --> 56:56.000
Now, the using Linux part is important.

56:56.000 --> 57:00.000
Has to be using Linux and preferably open source software,

57:00.000 --> 57:02.000
but the condition is using Linux.

57:02.000 --> 57:06.000
We're going to pick one winner from the high school bracket

57:06.000 --> 57:08.000
and the middle school bracket,

57:08.000 --> 57:11.000
and each winner is going to get a Dart or Pro from System76.

57:11.000 --> 57:13.000
This is on my dime.

57:13.000 --> 57:17.000
You know, I think we're going to do these about once a quarter for kids.

57:17.000 --> 57:20.000
We will be verifying that you are actually a high school student

57:20.000 --> 57:22.000
or a middle school student, of course.

57:22.000 --> 57:26.000
But, you know, if you're listening, think outside the box, right?

57:26.000 --> 57:29.000
Because Wes and I talked a lot about, what did we talk about?

57:29.000 --> 57:32.000
F sharp today and a few other languages.

57:32.000 --> 57:36.000
Don't think that you have to be married to what we've talked about.

57:36.000 --> 57:41.000
I'm sure Wes would agree that it's preferable for you to kind of

57:41.000 --> 57:44.000
just let it go, right? Just think outside, you know.

57:44.000 --> 57:47.000
Yeah, that's one of the advantages of things like this is, you know,

57:47.000 --> 57:49.000
we're old and stuck in our ways.

57:49.000 --> 57:52.000
We're old and stuck in our ways and, you know,

57:52.000 --> 57:55.000
oftentimes can't see the best solution for something,

57:55.000 --> 57:57.000
and it takes out of the box ideas,

57:57.000 --> 58:01.000
things that might seem just unintuitive or wrong or broken

58:01.000 --> 58:04.000
that end up really shedding light on something.

58:04.000 --> 58:07.000
Right, and this is definitely my, you know, this is my own initiative.

58:07.000 --> 58:09.000
This is a team B thing.

58:09.000 --> 58:13.000
I did email and talked about it privately in Tampa a few weeks ago

58:13.000 --> 58:16.000
and say, well, should I do this Linux Academy course?

58:16.000 --> 58:19.000
Linux Academy, there's no preference, right?

58:19.000 --> 58:22.000
If you're a member, if you're not, whatever you want to do.

58:22.000 --> 58:25.000
If your thing is a completely, you know, hell,

58:25.000 --> 58:29.000
if you can solve global warming with real basic, go on.

58:29.000 --> 58:32.000
And I have a friend named Brian who you should talk to,

58:32.000 --> 58:35.000
who we're not friends, but it'd be fun.

58:35.000 --> 58:37.000
Too soon?

58:37.000 --> 58:39.000
No, amazing. Amazing.

58:39.000 --> 58:42.000
Well, Mike, this is real generous of you,

58:42.000 --> 58:45.000
and I'm excited to see what comes out.

58:45.000 --> 58:47.000
You know what I figured, Wes?

58:47.000 --> 58:50.000
Instead of pouring gin into laptops,

58:50.000 --> 58:53.000
I should just give them to kids who might save my life.

58:53.000 --> 58:56.000
And that means more gin for you.

58:56.000 --> 58:59.000
And more sales for System76, who, by the way,

58:59.000 --> 59:03.000
keeps sending me nasty messages about you being prettier than me.

59:03.000 --> 59:05.000
We'll have to have a conversation offline.

59:05.000 --> 59:07.000
We sure will.

59:07.000 --> 59:09.000
Well, if you want to go find out more, of course,

59:09.000 --> 59:13.000
you can find that stuff in our show notes, coder.show slash 355.

59:13.000 --> 59:16.000
Or, well, you can just follow Mike's wonderful company,

59:16.000 --> 59:20.000
The Mad Botter Inc. on Twitter there at TheMadBotterInc.

59:20.000 --> 59:23.000
Mike, you're on Twitter too? What's your handle?

59:23.000 --> 59:25.000
At Dimenuco.

59:25.000 --> 59:28.000
I'm there as well. I'm at Westpane.

59:28.000 --> 59:31.000
You can also find, well, the whole darn network

59:31.000 --> 59:34.000
and with, you know, links to all the other hoots that are on there too,

59:34.000 --> 59:40.000
at Jupiter Signal or just head on over to JupiterBroadcasting.com.

59:40.000 --> 59:42.000
That's going to be it for us today.

59:42.000 --> 59:45.000
But if you want more, you'll find the whole catalog there

59:45.000 --> 59:49.000
and you'll find the calendar where you can come join us here

59:49.000 --> 59:52.000
for the live show every Monday.

59:52.000 --> 59:55.000
Thank you so much for joining. We'll see you then.

59:55.000 --> 01:00:05.000
I'll see you next time.

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:45.000
.
