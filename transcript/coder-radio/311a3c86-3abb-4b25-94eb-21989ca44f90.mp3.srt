00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:41,920
My name is Chris and joining us like the podcast champion that he is established in the hot

9
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:42,920
zone.

10
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:44,400
It's our host, Mr. Dominic.

11
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:45,400
Hello, Mike.

12
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:48,900
What's up, Mr. Fisher?

13
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:52,520
Let me tell you, it is crazy.

14
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:55,960
So I'm here right now at System 76 as we do the show in Denver.

15
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:58,360
We made it last night around midnight.

16
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:00,280
Nice, Mike.

17
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:04,000
It was the worst driving of my life.

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,640
It was a hurricane.

19
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:11,440
It was like I was driving the RV into a destruction chamber.

20
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:15,120
The I-76 sections of I-76 are so bad.

21
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:16,520
It's 75 miles per hour.

22
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:22,800
I had to drop it down to 35 miles per hour with my hazards on, crawling in the dark down

23
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:27,320
this highway for an hour as it destroyed my home.

24
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:29,440
It was brutal.

25
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:30,840
It was horrible driving.

26
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:36,640
In fact, I have had awful experiences coming into the Colorado Denver area every single

27
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:37,640
time.

28
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:40,560
And I think I will never, ever, ever do it again in my RV.

29
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,080
I'll fly in, but I will never drive in again.

30
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:46,160
It has been horrendous, the trip in here.

31
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:50,080
Now this trip will always be a really great trip except for the drive into Denver was

32
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,720
awful.

33
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:53,280
It was awful.

34
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,280
I didn't sleep.

35
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:59,600
Afterwards, I was so traumatized by how bad the drive was, I couldn't sleep.

36
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,160
But let me tell you, it's good to be here.

37
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:07,860
It's good to be here, to be at System 76 where we said hi to a couple of people and parked

38
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:09,000
right up against their entrance.

39
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,600
I'm going to just sneak right in and grab us a couple more launches.

40
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,600
No big deal.

41
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:14,600
It's going to be great.

42
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,880
How are you doing?

43
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:17,880
I am good.

44
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:21,760
Now, I didn't tell you this off the air because I kind of forgot.

45
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:25,960
So remember how I had my son's school schedule?

46
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:29,600
What I did not pay attention to was Monday, they get out an hour early.

47
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:30,600
Oh my gosh.

48
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:36,580
So I'm going to apologize in advance if anybody hears, I don't know, Mario or various other

49
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:38,520
Nintendo Switch games behind me.

50
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,520
Sure.

51
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:42,720
Yes, I had the baseball slide into getting him.

52
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:48,200
And have you carline that didn't exist when I was a kid, but it's a goddamn nightmare.

53
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,200
Yep.

54
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,800
The queuing up and it takes forever and you're just stuck.

55
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,200
You're just stuck until it's done.

56
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,200
Oh, yeah.

57
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,200
No fun.

58
00:02:56,200 --> 00:03:00,400
You know, what was fun, though, is I was reading the Netscape.com home page.

59
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,680
Just I don't know, like just bubbled up online.

60
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:03,680
As one does.

61
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:08,200
You know, you can download Netscape Communicator 401 for Macintosh and Windows and you can

62
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:12,960
get communicator preview release six for Unix.

63
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:13,960
Yeah.

64
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:14,960
Wow.

65
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:15,960
Reading the old Netscape.com.

66
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:16,960
I'll put a link in the show notes.

67
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:17,960
You guys should go check this out.

68
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:22,880
It's like a whole other era where Netscape your guide to navigating the net and they've

69
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:27,600
got like a sailing boat that's sailing across the digital Internet.

70
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,960
It's it's really quaint.

71
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,160
It's a totally different time.

72
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:34,840
Oh, yeah, because it was it was like the web, but it was like an ocean to write.

73
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:37,040
Sometimes it was a highway, like a superhighway.

74
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,600
The information superhighway.

75
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:41,560
Sometimes it was an ocean, you know, where we were just trying to wrap our heads around

76
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,560
it.

77
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,560
I don't know.

78
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,840
Something just made me smile looking at that.

79
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:51,120
You know, I thought we would get a just a metric ton of feedback about the Apple scanning

80
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,920
your phone pictures for child porn and we didn't get a single email about it.

81
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:55,920
How weird is that?

82
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,600
I think they don't want us to talk about Apple.

83
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,800
Well, that might be true.

84
00:03:58,800 --> 00:03:59,800
That might be true.

85
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:03,600
They have a M1 NV could be or it's the exact opposite.

86
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:04,600
They've all switched.

87
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:07,480
They've got iPhones and they've made their choice and now they don't want to have to

88
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:12,520
think about too much or maybe everybody's actually OK with it and it's just it's just

89
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:16,680
us that are like, wait a minute, this seems like a pretty slippery slope here.

90
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:23,520
I think Apple did say that they are going to change the program so that way it's not

91
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:27,840
just the database run by the FBI, but it'll have to be hashes that are added by multiple

92
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:31,520
countries at the same time or something like that.

93
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:34,960
I have somebody mentioned something about Beijing before.

94
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:38,320
Yeah, I've decided Macs just are horrible workstations.

95
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,320
Today's experience.

96
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:43,640
So I decided to bring a Mac with me on the trip just to, you know, give it a swing.

97
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:46,600
And it's the best performing machine I have with the largest screen.

98
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:49,480
And so I brought it to do the remote broadcasts.

99
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:56,280
And it it has been so frustrating because of the the built in stuff that it just does

100
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:57,480
in the background.

101
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:59,360
And I have no control over it.

102
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:03,700
One is like photo analysis of like detecting faces that I take with my iPhone.

103
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:08,720
But the other thing that's actually killing me right now as we speak is this damn and

104
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,860
has your session demand.

105
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:18,400
This thing is taking two megs to four megabytes a second megabytes a second of bandwidth down.

106
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:22,880
And I'm on a really limited LTE connection because the system 76 buildings actually blocking

107
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,560
one of my cellular providers.

108
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:27,400
So like I've got like no bandwidth to spare.

109
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:30,120
And this damn Mac, this damn Mac.

110
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:34,040
Doesn't matter how many times I kill NS URL session D. I turned off iCloud drive.

111
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:36,040
I turned off all iCloud stuff.

112
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,720
It doesn't matter what I do.

113
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:43,560
I cannot get NS URL session D to stop taking every absolute available bit of bandwidth

114
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,560
that I have.

115
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:48,840
I'm looking at my at my bandwidth transfer chart right now and it's redlined.

116
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,800
It is redlined the entire time.

117
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,820
And I have like 60 kilobits left over for the conversation you and I are having right

118
00:05:54,820 --> 00:06:01,000
now and everything else, everything else is being allocated to this NS URL session D.

119
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,120
And sometimes I see just background processes taking 200 percent of CPU core.

120
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,160
I have no idea what they're doing.

121
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:10,520
There's no way for me to prevent it because if I if I kill the process, launch D just

122
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:12,160
restarts it.

123
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,800
This is a joke workstation.

124
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:18,740
The fact that I have no control and here I am trying to do a live stream, trying to do

125
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:22,360
my job and the Mac is doing God knows what.

126
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,360
I can't even tell what it is.

127
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:27,080
I used activity monitor to check the open files and it doesn't give me any indication

128
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,660
of what it's actually doing.

129
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:31,640
So there could be that, too.

130
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:34,200
Anyways, I just think it's a joke.

131
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:37,360
And if anybody knows how to fix that, let me know.

132
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,360
You don't fix it.

133
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:40,000
You just you get more bandwidth.

134
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,200
Uncle Tim needs his cut.

135
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,200
Yeah, that's true.

136
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,200
Right.

137
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,040
You got to have you got to have those services staying in sync.

138
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:48,200
Hans writes and he says, hey, guys, love the show.

139
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,200
Keep on going.

140
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:52,600
You recently touched on a blog post about Gnome's apparent delusional future.

141
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:55,280
And well, honestly, I couldn't agree more with your analysis.

142
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,320
I am a huge fan of Linux desktop.

143
00:06:57,320 --> 00:07:00,020
And because of that, I like the choice it offers.

144
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:03,640
What I wonder is what you would recommend as a replacement for Gnome right now.

145
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:07,320
I'm currently on XFCE and actually been thinking about going back to Gnome, but that doesn't

146
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:09,040
seem like a viable option anymore.

147
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,320
Is KDE really worth it?

148
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:13,140
I never gave it much of a chance because it always kind of looked too similar to Windows

149
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:14,140
to me.

150
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:15,600
What about CineBit, Mate or Budgie?

151
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:18,440
I'd be really curious to hear your thoughts on other desktop alternatives.

152
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:22,840
And I just want to say thank you to Hans for writing in to give me a chance to once again

153
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:26,720
talk about Plasma on the show so I can slowly chip away at Mike and eventually one day get

154
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,720
him to try it.

155
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,880
I just recommend Plasma a whole straight up.

156
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:33,840
And yes, default, it will look like Windows, but that's actually clever, I think, because

157
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:38,760
a lot of people can map their experiences with traditional desktop paradigms onto that

158
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:40,280
Plasma setup.

159
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:45,080
But the thing you'll learn about Plasma to almost to a fault is it is extremely customizable

160
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:47,680
and you can make it look like Unity 7 if you want.

161
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:51,160
You can make it look like XFCE if you want.

162
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:55,640
And it's modularized so you can have components of it that will fail that don't take down

163
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:57,400
the entire desktop stack.

164
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,840
Their Wayland support is coming along really well.

165
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:04,880
And the performance is now, I would bet you, although I can't guarantee it, but I would

166
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:09,300
bet you there's a good chance it'll use less resources than XFCE does on your box.

167
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:11,400
It's really, really light these days.

168
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,560
Did I convince you?

169
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,560
No.

170
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,560
Okay.

171
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,560
All right.

172
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:20,760
So John writes in, hey guys, I've been a software engineer for about 11 years now and I've now

173
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:23,360
transitioned into a manager.

174
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,360
Hmm.

175
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,360
Hmm.

176
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,360
Yes.

177
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,360
Hmm.

178
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,360
Okay.

179
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:30,780
Well, he's happy about it.

180
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:31,780
So we'll go with that.

181
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:36,720
He says, I work for a large company and while I know how to be a good developer, I'd like

182
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:40,340
to hear your guys' thoughts on what makes a good manager of developers.

183
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:44,960
It's my first time as a manager and I'm going to have to be in charge of a large group in

184
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,080
multiple countries.

185
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:49,440
I've read a lot of articles and posts, but I would appreciate to hear your collective

186
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,440
perspectives on this.

187
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,440
Keep up the great work.

188
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:56,160
Sean, do you have any tips maybe you've derived from having bad managers that you would pass

189
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,160
on to Sean?

190
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:58,160
Yeah.

191
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:04,380
I mean, I do a lot of management myself these days and I, it's tough because ultimately

192
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:07,180
it comes down to when's this going to be done?

193
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:08,180
What's the estimate?

194
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:09,180
The estimate's always wrong.

195
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:15,280
Like I feel like the manager problems, at least the way I do things, have always been

196
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:17,800
on both sides.

197
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:23,880
The developer problem of like estimation, but with an extra layer of being removed from

198
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:26,160
the situation.

199
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:29,720
So I even less visibility into the problem.

200
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:31,280
I can give you one real case.

201
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:32,280
Okay.

202
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:35,980
When I was very, very young, I had a manager who used to literally his move was to count

203
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:36,980
people's commits.

204
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:37,980
Oh yeah.

205
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:39,920
That's like another version of butts in seats almost.

206
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:40,920
Yeah.

207
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:42,260
It was really weird and like lines of code.

208
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:46,520
It was really, that company did not last.

209
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:47,520
Surprise.

210
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:48,520
Surprise.

211
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:53,540
I mean, I struggle with this myself, to be honest, because there's always the let the

212
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:55,680
coders just code and be happy.

213
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,880
And then there's the way you need process.

214
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:04,000
And I'm constantly adjusting between more process or less process, right?

215
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:12,720
Like at one point, we're super deep into Jira, Alassian Jira, and then that just became heavy.

216
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:17,280
And right now we're kind of basically working in Trello, but already I'm starting to see

217
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:22,380
things that I'm kind of missing from what I want in Trello, because the manager's job

218
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:27,880
is ultimately to talk to the stakeholders, sorry, I said stakeholders, I have to vomit,

219
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:33,400
and be like the middleman between the stakeholders and developers and make sure that expectations

220
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:36,360
that are being set make sense and that they're met.

221
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,360
Yes.

222
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,360
Yeah.

223
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:42,840
And also that things the stakeholders are asking for are actually developable, right?

224
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:46,120
That isn't like, you know, build me a pony.

225
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:50,520
I actually think accountability and expectations was the area I was going to hit on.

226
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:52,880
So I think I totally agree with you.

227
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:58,960
As a manager, I think you need to find a way to hold people accountable and also make expectations

228
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,520
clear all the time.

229
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:06,760
Like focus on accountability and expectations, but accountability is a tricky one because

230
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:09,600
you don't want to be a dictator.

231
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:16,060
You want to be the type of manager that can suss out when performance is lacking because

232
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:20,400
somebody isn't trained up or doesn't know how to do something versus somebody is just

233
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:22,600
being lazy and taking you from a ride.

234
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:27,280
And you kind of have to have a different manager's hat for different situations in that regard.

235
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:31,040
So keep flexibility in mind when holding people accountable.

236
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:36,620
But if you don't, if you don't build that muscle, it will become harder and harder over

237
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:41,120
time and you will build a culture of unaccountability.

238
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,480
And that is going to spell disaster.

239
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:48,160
Like Mike was just saying, you'll hear guys come up with systems that are just ridiculous

240
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:53,800
to try to hold people accountable, like counting lines of code or commits.

241
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:57,880
And you know, that that's obviously not going to work, but you could probably guess what

242
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:59,360
that person was trying to get at, right?

243
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:03,840
They were, they were trying to come up with some sort of process and system to hold people

244
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:05,040
accountable.

245
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,040
That's universal.

246
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:10,640
And yeah, you can do that to some degree with project boards and, and sprints that have

247
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:12,980
specific tasks and goals and key results.

248
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:18,520
But I think the reality is a manager is always kind of being flexible and wears a slightly

249
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:20,920
different manager hat for each person they work with.

250
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:25,180
And that's why large teams can be very hard, very, very hard.

251
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:31,240
And why you will need people who work with you to help message, to help check in your,

252
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:37,240
you cannot do it all yourself in a worldwide large team in different time zones.

253
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:38,760
There's a lot you can do.

254
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:42,100
You could also consider, I hear something that's working really well for people that

255
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:46,080
are managing groups in different time zones is moving your meetings to a more async style

256
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:50,340
meeting where perhaps you're posting video updates to a channel.

257
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:53,880
And instead of everybody sitting in a meeting or a standup because the time zone situation

258
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:58,960
is so difficult, you come up with more interesting, clever ways to still have high touch communication,

259
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:01,400
but in a way that doesn't bog people down with meetings.

260
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:04,600
And as a manager, it's your opportunity to kind of come up with clever solutions for

261
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:05,600
that.

262
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:09,920
So focus on accountability with flexibility, focus on making sure that your communication

263
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:12,720
strategy is clear and that you have a way to manage that many people and keep them all

264
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:17,960
in sync across different time zones, perhaps async meeting styles instead of everybody

265
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:21,920
getting on a zoom call, you do individual updates and that kind of stuff.

266
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:25,360
And I think if you think in those terms, you're probably going to do all right.

267
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:28,000
You're probably going to do better than most developer managers.

268
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,300
And also I'll just say this too, is like, listen to your people.

269
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:34,480
If you know they're pushing something or if they think there's a direction that project

270
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:38,860
needs to go in, at least listen to them and have that conversation, Sean, because perhaps

271
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:42,900
they know more about a particular thing than you do, because although you sound like you

272
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:47,180
are a good developer, you've been doing it for 11 years, as time goes on, you're going

273
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:53,400
to be removed from the day to day into just like problems that the developers are solving.

274
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:56,280
You're going to be, as time goes on, more and more removed from that just naturally

275
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:57,640
by not doing it.

276
00:13:57,640 --> 00:14:02,280
And there will be a point where perhaps you need to catch yourself and say, you know,

277
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:05,680
I do know a lot about this, but maybe this individual, maybe she knows more about it

278
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:06,680
and I need to listen to her.

279
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:08,920
And you got to be that kind of manager as well.

280
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:09,960
Not an easy job.

281
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:13,600
Turns out it's a lot more work doing the management stuff or it's a different kind of work to

282
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,600
right?

283
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:18,480
Absolutely and that listening to other folks and but also, again, you can't listen to everybody,

284
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,480
right?

285
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:22,360
If you have a team of like five or six, you're going to have conflicting opinions and you

286
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:26,880
have to find a way to resolve those, particularly about like dumb stuff like linters.

287
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,160
It's always the dumb stuff.

288
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,160
It's always the dumb stuff.

289
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:30,160
Right.

290
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,160
Words.

291
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:32,160
You could just get two people who are...

292
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,160
Colors.

293
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:34,160
Yeah.

294
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:35,160
Oh, my God.

295
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:36,160
Yes.

296
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:38,480
You could tell we've both dealt a lot with that.

297
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,240
And that's where everybody always has the most input.

298
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:44,360
And so it's super frustrating because you just get bogged down in the nuance of stuff

299
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:47,560
that doesn't matter and it's just excruciating.

300
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:49,840
And so you got to navigate that as a manager as well.

301
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:50,840
Have fun, Sean.

302
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:54,600
It's going to be a blast.

303
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:55,600
Good luck.

304
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,600
Yeah.

305
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:57,600
Good luck with that.

306
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,600
Hey, you know what?

307
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:01,720
I just want to mention super quick meetup.com slash Jupiter broadcasting.

308
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:02,920
It's this week.

309
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:07,400
It's Friday the 20th in Denver at Pindustry.

310
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:11,320
We are asking that you just kind of start trickling in after four o'clock at Pindustry.

311
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,840
You'll find us there.

312
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:13,840
Linode's going to be there.

313
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:14,840
We're going to be giving away raspberry pies.

314
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:18,720
They're going to be giving away a bunch of Linode credit and other stuff.

315
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,520
Some friends from Linode will be there as well.

316
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:22,960
Some friends from System76 will be there.

317
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:25,960
A lot of the JB crew, but not all of the JB crew will be there.

318
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:28,020
And we always get a lot of coder love at these meetups.

319
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:33,520
So if you're a Coder Radio listener, you are 100% invited to Pindustry this Friday in Denver

320
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:38,040
at 4 p.m. local time or start trickling in after that.

321
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:39,040
This is it.

322
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:42,800
This is the big meetup, the one that we've been on the road for, and it's almost here.

323
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:46,800
It's very exciting, and we'd love to see it.

324
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,600
Linode.com slash Coder.

325
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,120
Yep, that's right.

326
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:54,280
Linode sponsors this here podcast, and we enthusiastically use Linode for all of our

327
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:55,280
hosting needs.

328
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:59,080
You know, I've built everything on Linode over the last couple of years, and I have

329
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:04,440
legitimately experienced like all the different options out there for hosting.

330
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:06,560
I have tried all kinds of things.

331
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:09,560
But what I like about Linode is the fundamentals.

332
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:11,020
They have really good performance.

333
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:12,240
They have a really good interface.

334
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:15,160
They have a really clear, easy to understand API.

335
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:17,920
And on top of that, they also have a dashboard that's, you know, that's great.

336
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:18,920
Like their interface is great.

337
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:22,940
But they have 11 data centers worldwide, and the connections between those data centers

338
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:23,940
is super fast.

339
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:27,080
So if you need multiple spots, you're covered there.

340
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:30,360
And then Linode itself, as a company, their fundamentals check out as well.

341
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:34,480
They are the largest independent cloud provider in the world, full stop.

342
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:35,480
Right there.

343
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:36,480
Right?

344
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:37,480
They're independently owned.

345
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:40,720
They're not backed by a VC that has some goal to dump on the market and then completely

346
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,920
take over the space and jack the prices up.

347
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:46,840
They've been doing this for 18 years, iterating on it, getting it better and better and better.

348
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:50,200
And now they have millions of customers, well, at least a million.

349
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:54,160
I actually haven't checked, but I think it's around a million customers and businesses

350
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,160
around the globe.

351
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:56,160
I mean, think about that.

352
00:16:56,160 --> 00:17:01,280
This is an independent company that started in cloud computing years before AWS was even,

353
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:03,880
you know, a glimmer in Bezos's eye.

354
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:08,260
And Linode has remained focused on providing great hosting since then.

355
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:12,880
They make cloud computing simple, affordable and accessible to all 30 to 50% cheaper than

356
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:15,000
the major cloud providers while being fast.

357
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,440
And it's not just me saying that, although I've personally experienced how fast they

358
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:19,440
are.

359
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:22,520
They've actually been reviewed and tested against the other cloud providers.

360
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:27,120
One of Linode's edges is they're using brand new AMD EPYC processors in their dedicated

361
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:28,120
CPU rigs.

362
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:32,080
They're using crazy fast SSDs and they are their own ISP.

363
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:36,540
So it's like every part in the stack has been optimized and it all comes together to give

364
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:37,920
Linode a performance edge.

365
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:40,500
I love their S3 compatible object storage.

366
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:44,920
Have you ever looked into how much software actually supports S3 storage and how much

367
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:49,640
backup software and how you can do configuration management and all kinds of stuff with object

368
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:50,640
storage?

369
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:51,640
Well, they've got it in spades.

370
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:53,320
I use it for my next cloud instance.

371
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:55,640
I use it for all kinds of backend file sharing.

372
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:56,640
It's great.

373
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:01,680
They have cloud firewalls, VLAN support, a powerful DNS manager and one click application

374
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:02,680
deployments.

375
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:05,280
If that's more your thing, if you're not so much of a DIYer, they can cover you there

376
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:07,080
too with their one click deployments.

377
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:10,700
So there's an open source product called Minio that I've been using for years.

378
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:15,800
It basically is, if you know, Doku, right, is an open source implementation of the Heroku

379
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:16,800
API.

380
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:21,400
Minio started out as an open source implementation of the S3 API.

381
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:26,600
Now they have a whole ML thing, but they still support the old, they maintain it.

382
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:28,440
But they have two sides to their business now.

383
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,260
Originally it was just a FOSS project.

384
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:35,120
Now there's like some, I don't know what they're doing with the commercial side, but for example,

385
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:40,400
if you import, this is my real world case, the Ruby S3 gem, but you want to self-host

386
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:45,880
your files, you just target the endpoint to your local server running Minio.

387
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:49,520
And from that point on, you don't ever have to think about, and that server could be a

388
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:53,320
Linode VPN, right, you don't ever have to think about that it's Minio.

389
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:58,040
You just use all the S3 classes, all the S3 utilities in the S3 gem.

390
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:01,560
Goes the same for the PIP package and Python and the Java jar and all that kind of stuff.

391
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:03,120
So yeah, that's a great project too.

392
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:05,080
It's interesting too to see them try to make it profitable.

393
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:09,480
And of course Linode has been supporting the Linux community and this year program, making

394
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:12,720
Coda radio possible and Jupiter Broadcasting's meetup as well.

395
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:16,640
They're really, their commitment to the community genuinely does run deep.

396
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:17,640
It's pretty great.

397
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:20,560
They're also dedicated to offering the best in virtualized cloud computing, which probably

398
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:21,760
matters a lot to you.

399
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:24,440
If it runs on Linux, it's going to run great on the node.

400
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:29,000
So sign up today, get $100 and 60 day credit on your new account and you support the show,

401
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,440
make it possible for us to keep giving away free independent content.

402
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:35,120
That's linode.com slash coder.

403
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:39,200
Go there to get $100 and support the show, linode.com slash coder.

404
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:43,200
All right, I'm attempting to kill processes.

405
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:48,280
Wes Payne has sent me several launch CTL commands to attempt to stop this NSC URL session.

406
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:49,720
It's still going like crazy though.

407
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:55,240
Just crack open some POS files and just go to town.

408
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:58,520
You know, I'm just, I'm kind of, I'm a little disappointed because we've been getting all

409
00:19:58,520 --> 00:19:59,520
these emails.

410
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:00,520
They're like, Oh, Max, great workstation, blah, blah, blah.

411
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:02,600
And it kind of, you know, I was like, okay, well I'll give it a go.

412
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:04,400
The listeners seem to sure like it an awful lot.

413
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:09,000
Maybe I, and here I am and I am just, I've thrown everything I can at this.

414
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:14,520
Only 3.9 megabytes a second on an LTE connection behind the building that's just so frustrating.

415
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:18,000
But let's talk about the stacked overflow developer survey because it's kind of become

416
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,480
a tradition on this show.

417
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:20,480
Yes.

418
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:21,480
How about this one?

419
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:23,040
Of course I had to start with this one.

420
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:26,720
They surveyed the respondents for operating systems and you guys probably know this, but

421
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:30,060
just as a recap, stack overflow does this every year.

422
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:35,320
They say this year they observed a significant evolution in the way developers are educating

423
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:36,680
themselves.

424
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:42,480
They say the younger coders are using online resources like videos and blogs.

425
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:47,960
In fact, they are more popular using videos and blogs is more popular than school and

426
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:50,400
books combined now in younger developers.

427
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:55,160
However, older developers, however that's defined more than 50% of them indicate they

428
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:59,800
still, uh, or sorry, a lot of them indicate that they are still just using good old traditional

429
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:02,040
books and traditional ways of learning.

430
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:03,040
Yep.

431
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:07,280
And 30% of the people that responded said they were new to coding less than a decade

432
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:13,280
and 35% have less than five years in the trade, 35% of less than five years, a lot of new

433
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:21,400
people and um, all respondents when they were asked said windows was the top OS at 45% Linux

434
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:33,360
number two at 25.32 and Mac OS number three at 25.19 and then WSL at 3.29% interesting

435
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:43,400
that WSL is broken out 3.29% for WSL and then BSD is at, is at 0.18%, 0.18 for BSD.

436
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:46,580
Oh man, that's bad.

437
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:51,440
That's sad when you flip the survey over though to professional developers.

438
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:54,920
So not just all respondents, but those who identify as a professional developer, I don't

439
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:56,920
even know what that means, but who knows?

440
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:58,280
Windows is still in the lead.

441
00:21:58,280 --> 00:21:59,880
Mac OS now comes in at second.

442
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:06,400
So it now has replaced Linux when you just focus on developers with a 30% indication

443
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:13,960
and then Linux comes in now at third at 25% WSL three and BSD remains slightly better

444
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:17,160
at 0.14% of people said they use BSD.

445
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:21,840
When I saw this, my thinking was the people who are professional developers are more likely

446
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:25,280
to be like the full time, you know, like, like me or, you know, just like people would

447
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,760
do it as their day job.

448
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:27,760
Right?

449
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:28,760
Yeah.

450
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:29,760
Yeah.

451
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:33,200
I think that Apple like joint venture stuff and the business support stuff, it's probably

452
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:38,160
kind of a lot of places it's like you can get the Dell or you can get the Mac book,

453
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:41,880
right with, in terms of the corporate it, you know, your standard issue.

454
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:47,040
It could be, if you were looking to at this survey for programming and scripting and markup

455
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:50,760
languages, I don't know, this might've hurt you because objective C is damn near bottom

456
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:56,440
of the list of ones people love 73% of respondents said they dreaded using objective C and a

457
00:22:56,440 --> 00:23:01,160
hundred percent of those people have bad taste.

458
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:06,080
C plus plus is smack dab in the middle, 50% love it, 50% hate it.

459
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:08,920
Java leans a little bit more towards the hate side.

460
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:11,880
Well, hmm. Yeah.

461
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:16,600
Can you guess what's at the top of the list that people just love by a huge margin?

462
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:17,720
I didn't do my homework.

463
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:18,720
Is it rust?

464
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,240
How did you guess?

465
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:21,240
That's right.

466
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:28,120
Well, it was either rust or Python, so.

467
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:29,120
People love rust.

468
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:30,120
I just.

469
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:31,120
They love rust.

470
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,120
They really do.

471
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:34,520
They just love it so much.

472
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:38,340
They love a compiler that kicks you squarely in the balls.

473
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:41,600
And Westpain will be happy to see that Clojure comes in at number two.

474
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:42,600
So.

475
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:43,600
Oh dear Lord.

476
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:46,340
I thank God we're not doing those challenges anymore.

477
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:48,720
Now this is also not just programming languages, right?

478
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,740
So TypeScript's on here.

479
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:55,680
So yeah, you know, I mean, yeah, I mean, yeah, I mean, it's kind of, it's a toy language.

480
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:56,680
Let's be honest.

481
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:57,680
I'm just kidding.

482
00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:03,540
I just feel like now I'm trying to get people to email it, you know, cause if they don't

483
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:05,320
write in, I'm like, all right, fine.

484
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:09,600
I'm going to, I'm going to, I'm going to poke you in the side until you write into the show.

485
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:16,080
AWS was the number one loved platform followed by Google.

486
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:20,280
Actually Google ties it up pretty much with Azure and DigitalOcean, Heroku's on there,

487
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:22,680
Oracle's on there.

488
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:23,680
Look at all that.

489
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:24,680
Wow, man.

490
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:26,320
A lot of stuff in there, but there you have it.

491
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:28,600
That's the new, that's the new developer survey.

492
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:32,960
I guess I was a little surprised to see Linux as high as it was in a way, especially on

493
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:35,880
the, on the all people respondents, on the all respondents.

494
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:36,880
Linux beat the Mac.

495
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:40,400
Well, this has been the trend for a couple of years now though, right?

496
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,260
Where Linux has been gaining share.

497
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:46,200
It just feels like if you, if you look at the emails we've gotten after the M1 announcement,

498
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:49,900
it felt like that, that trend was going to start sliding in the other direction.

499
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:54,920
I would like to see this and even the emails we get broken down by age because I have a

500
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:59,880
feeling your theory from last week is right that people who, you know, become moms or

501
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:04,760
dads at a certain age, just like run out of patience with some of the more finicky Linuxy

502
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:07,520
stuff and end up on the Mac.

503
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:10,520
Having said that, most of my guys use Papa Westal and it's fine.

504
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:12,520
In fact, I just ordered someone a Gazelle.

505
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:13,520
Oh, nice.

506
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:15,200
Do you want me to walk in there and grab it for you?

507
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,200
I'm right here.

508
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:17,200
It shipped.

509
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:20,360
I was going to ask you to actually, it already shipped though.

510
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:22,320
I'll grab you another launch instead.

511
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,360
Yeah, there is that.

512
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:26,760
I've definitely gotten that.

513
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:30,720
So we've done the Salt Lake City meetup and we've had four micro meetups where it's just

514
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:38,780
like a small group of people and universally it's like people are shifting some opinion

515
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:39,780
on this.

516
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:42,140
Not everybody is like switched or anything like that, but there's definitely some opinions

517
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:48,120
that are shifting and it does seem to be not to, not to like put too fine of a point on

518
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:54,640
it, but kind of seems like it's people that are near or at their or over their forties.

519
00:25:54,640 --> 00:26:00,280
They've got some kids, they've been working for a little while, a $1,300 laptop isn't

520
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:04,960
going to make or break them and they kind of just throw their hands up and that's definitely

521
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:11,240
been not a hundred percent, but it's been really common to see that on this road trip

522
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:13,040
for better or for worse.

523
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:14,200
Not everybody though.

524
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:18,640
So it's been a range of people that I've talked to and I'm kind of like I'm coming up with

525
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:22,440
a series of questions I'm asking people as these meetups go on to kind of get the information

526
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:26,600
out of like, well, what went wrong, when did you switch, why did you do it, you know, I'm

527
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:27,600
just asking.

528
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:31,520
It's really kind of all anecdotal, but I'll probably get 20, 30 responses from people

529
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,000
overall by the end of this trip.

530
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,800
So I'm starting to change my perspective on it.

531
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:40,160
And you know, the truth of the matter is the way I'm looking at it right now is this Mac

532
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:44,200
seems more finicky and it seems like more hassle than a Linux box because this Linux

533
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:49,440
box, so before it was downloading, now it is uploading.

534
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:53,300
And I don't know what NSURLSessionD is uploading, but it's uploading two megs a second, which

535
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:56,160
is about all I have again.

536
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:59,480
And I'm trying to do a live show, right?

537
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:00,480
It's so frustrating.

538
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:04,800
Do you have like a Charles proxy or like a, I think it's like Netcat or something to like

539
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:07,000
see what exactly it's doing.

540
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:12,340
Well, I did go into activity monitor and I opened up the process and I looked at the

541
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:16,960
open files in the process and it doesn't really tell me anything.

542
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,920
Like I see logs in here.

543
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:26,920
I see analytics.whitelist in here and I see some HTTPS connections from my host to probably

544
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:29,520
some iCloud server, just the IP address.

545
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:31,460
This is why Snow Leopard was better.

546
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:33,060
This is a disqualifier for me.

547
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:35,760
Is it the first time you've used it in a while?

548
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:40,880
No, I mean, no, I've used it on, I've been using it on this road trip and you know, so

549
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,240
it was just a couple, a couple of days ago.

550
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:43,240
When did I do LAN?

551
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:44,240
Yesterday.

552
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:45,240
I did LAN yesterday.

553
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:46,240
That's weird.

554
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:47,240
Okay.

555
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:48,240
Yeah.

556
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:49,240
That's a disqualifier for me.

557
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:50,240
I think it disqualifies.

558
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:51,240
I mean, I'm not sure.

559
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:55,560
I'm going to see if I can figure out how to, how, if I can tame this NSURL session D beast,

560
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:56,560
then it's not.

561
00:27:56,560 --> 00:28:00,280
But having something take up this much bandwidth when you're on the road is, ooh boy, I should

562
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:04,160
stop bitching about it, but it's, it's just like so quintessentially like an example of

563
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:06,040
how the Mac is not fully under your control.

564
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:07,040
Bitch away.

565
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:11,360
That's what the advertisers pay for.

566
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:13,420

I don't know about you, but I could always use another t-shirt, especially cause I always

582
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:16,080
spill stuff on myself and free t-shirts help with that pain.

586
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:41,360
over 450 different pieces of technology you likely already own.

587
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:44,600
I really liked this tweet by Steven Trotten-Smith.

588
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:47,000
He's a developer on the Apple platform.

589
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,080
He's created some pretty good apps.

590
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:52,040
One that I like a lot is called, I think it's called Broadcast or Broadcaster and it's just

591
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:57,480
a nice, clean, simple internet radio streaming app for the iPhone that does some smart buffering

592
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:59,200
and yeah, you might want to check it out.

593
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:04,680
So Steven Trotten-Smith on Twitter said, quote, the Mac is in the best place it has ever been.

594
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:10,200
Fresh off a CPU transition, a new design language, beautiful new hardware with two brand new

595
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:15,000
UI frameworks, universal apps and a popular new programming language.

596
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:20,680
If that's not enough to convince developers to make native apps, what is?

597
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:21,680
And I thought about it for a second.

598
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:23,760
I thought, damn, I think he's right.

599
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:33,000
Like are we seeing the last great push for native apps with new hardware, new design,

600
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,200
you know, the new design and what is a Big Sur, I can't remember, whatever the new UI

601
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:37,560
they did.

602
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:40,240
And of course, Swift getting more popular than ever.

603
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:43,560
They have the two UI frameworks to make it easy if you're already developing for iOS

604
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:46,280
to bring your applications to the Mac.

605
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:47,280
And they're all native.

606
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:48,280
They're all native.

607
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:53,160
Do you think Apple has lined everything up to actually convince developers to start focusing

608
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:55,520
on native apps and give up on things like Electron?

609
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:56,520
No, it doesn't make sense.

610
00:30:56,520 --> 00:31:02,760
I mean, if you're like a small indie, yeah, you know, the Mac market's surely big enough

611
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:09,500
to make very beautiful, very kind of polished native applications using Apple's latest frameworks,

612
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:11,520
you know, kind of running on the treadmill, right?

613
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:14,120
We've talked about that for years, more in the context of iOS.

614
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:15,120
Right.

615
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:18,820
And well, and I think to be fair to them, they have lined this up better than Microsoft,

616
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:21,440
which is traditionally very good at this kind of stuff.

617
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:25,320
But when you bring it all together, I think Apple has lined it up better than any other

618
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:26,320
platform.

619
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:28,240
And I could even see that sort of leading the way.

620
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:31,840
Other platform providers like Google and Microsoft looking at that going, let's start building

621
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:32,840
our own chips.

622
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:36,640
Let's start shoring this up and making this a good experience for native developers.

623
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:40,780
I mean, there's an easy Swift dig here, but I'm not going to make it.

624
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:45,000
I would have a hard time pitching to someone to a business that they should do a native

625
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,000
Mac.

626
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:51,140
I'd even have a hard time pitching they should do a native iOS app, although on the iPad

627
00:31:51,140 --> 00:31:54,720
now that things are somewhat loosened up, which I think we should talk about more in

628
00:31:54,720 --> 00:32:01,480
a couple of weeks, there is definitely more opportunity.

629
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:02,480
I don't buy it.

630
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:05,120
I mean, I want to buy it.

631
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:06,600
That's why I keep hemming and hawing here.

632
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:13,320
But yeah, the reality is for most businesses, maintaining native applications is a huge

633
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:14,760
pain in the ass.

634
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:19,160
You're almost better off with a PWA or some sort of web based solution.

635
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:24,900
You know, whether that be a flask or a fast API app returning Jinja, the templating engine

636
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:28,920
for Python, or just straight up Rails with ERB.

637
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:32,920
That way you have one thing to update, one thing to maintain, and you don't have these

638
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:33,920
problems.

639
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:37,880
And frankly, the PWA capabilities, especially if we're talking about desktop here, where

640
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:42,640
you don't have Apple's crazy restrictions on iOS Safari, although I did just hit a bug

641
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:46,440
on Safari for Mac I tweeted about, if you can follow me if you want to see my bitching

642
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:51,640
about how Apple decided to not cooperate where every other browser does.

643
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:55,780
I mean, I don't know, and I'm a guy who used to sell Mac applications, right?

644
00:32:55,780 --> 00:32:57,880
So like, I want this to be true.

645
00:32:57,880 --> 00:33:00,640
I think it is true.

646
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:08,640
I just don't know that, at least in the enterprise space, which is mostly where I live now, it

647
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:14,120
would ever again, make sense for me to sell someone a native Mac application as like a

648
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:15,960
custom development job.

649
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:20,640
And after I asked you the question, I started thinking too, like, it seems like the mobile

650
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,580
industry is just too large.

651
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:25,200
Mobile users are the number one target.

652
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:29,080
Oh, yeah, dude, on mobile Xcode file new project, right?

653
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:30,080
All day long.

654
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:31,080
Yeah.

655
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:33,520
It's always going to make the desktop kind of like a second class target, I think.

656
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:39,280
I think it's just the size of the desktop market has been eclipsed by a juicier, larger

657
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:40,280
market.

658
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:43,580
And I think that's just where the native apps are going to be now.

659
00:33:43,580 --> 00:33:45,960
When you have a native app, it's going to be in an app store.

660
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:49,040
And when you're downloading apps and you're loading them on your PC, on your freeloading

661
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:55,040
PC with no app store, or the app store you're not using, it's going to be like a web app

662
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:56,040
for a lot of them.

663
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:57,040
Yeah.

664
00:33:57,040 --> 00:34:00,620
And I remember like my old app for Mac Code Journal.

665
00:34:00,620 --> 00:34:04,360
One of the things I was completely unprepared for, but ended up being true was people wanting

666
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:07,520
to buy site licenses for it.

667
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:12,360
And this is back when the Mac App Store just had come out and did not support anything

668
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:15,240
close to an organization account.

669
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:16,240
I don't know.

670
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:17,240
I mean, maybe I'm wrong.

671
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:18,240
I'm sure I am wrong.

672
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:19,600
Obviously, game developers exist.

673
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:23,120
And I feel like when we say app, we're not talking about games.

674
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:28,520
But to me, the kind of, quote, productivity or developer tools software market is really

675
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:32,600
a B2B game, an enterprise sales game.

676
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:33,600
Yeah.

677
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:36,480
And like Aveth points out in the chat room, most users don't even know when it's not a

678
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:37,480
native app.

679
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:39,980
So that's a factor as well.

680
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:43,960
And I don't know if you've heard about what one password just did recently, but they just

681
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:49,540
released one password version eight and the Mac users are revolting because it's now it's

682
00:34:49,540 --> 00:34:53,280
gone from a native app and it is now an electron app.

683
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:56,000
But then don't worry, it's got a rust back end.

684
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:01,560
So the rust back end is native, but the user front end is electron.

685
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:04,040
And some users, you know, they don't care, right, obviously.

686
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:06,900
But there are a lot of Mac users who are like, well, screw this.

687
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:08,280
You just took away my pretty native app.

688
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:09,960
Well, but that makes a ton of sense, right?

689
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:16,120
Like we're doing C++ back ends with effectively JavaScript front ends.

690
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:20,640
And you know, for for one password and Microsoft is going to go this way with Office eventually

691
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:21,640
too.

692
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:26,680
But with one with one password, it means they now have a Linux version and a Windows version

693
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:28,980
and a Mac version that's all going to be in sync.

694
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:31,600
And I guess it doesn't matter that it's going to lose some users.

695
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:35,120
Some users will quit over this, but I bet long term they're not because where are they

696
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:36,120
going to go?

697
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:39,280
I guess they're using Safari as their browser.

698
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:41,920
Most of the other password managers aren't very good.

699
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:44,160
I like LastPass, but all right.

700
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:45,160
I liked Lice.

701
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:49,160
I switched just about, you know, I don't know, a year or two, I can't remember now, from

702
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:50,160
LastPass.

703
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:51,540
And I've been really happy with Bitwarden.

704
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:55,640
If if anybody wants to give Bitwarden a try, they've got it's open source, but they do

705
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:58,920
have a premium version if you want to host on their servers and stuff.

706
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:01,100
And I've liked Bitwarden a lot.

707
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:05,760
And so if people are looking for an alternative that, you know, is reasonable and seems to

708
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:08,800
have a good team behind it, I would recommend Bitwarden.

709
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:13,000
LastPass is not bad, too, but they've recently changed to some crazy scheme where you got

710
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:17,460
to pay a certain rate to be able to open up your password database on a desktop or a mobile.

711
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:20,740
And if you don't pay, you can only open it on mobile or you can only open on a desktop.

712
00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:22,480
It depends which one you open it on first.

713
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:23,480
Like what?

714
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:24,480
Okay.

715
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:25,480
That's not confusing.

716
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:29,200
I don't even want to tell you the stupid thing that I do, but I use iCloud everywhere.

717
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:31,000
Well, I mean, it works.

718
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,000
You know, it's simple.

719
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,000
It's built into the system.

720
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:38,320
And most of the stuff I need those passwords for, one, I've aggressively moved to 2FA

721
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:39,440
for everything.

722
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:42,520
So that kind of changes, you know.

723
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:47,040
I mean, the nice thing about having the iCloud password is that it's, you know, it's also

724
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:51,040
then it works with your fingerprint and your face ID stuff so you can authorize the password

725
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:52,760
filling with your fingerprint.

726
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:53,760
That's nice, actually.

727
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:54,760
Right.

728
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:55,760
Or the cops can just flash your phone at you.

729
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:56,760
Yeah, it's really good.

730
00:36:56,760 --> 00:37:01,160
I want to know why you're getting picked up by the cops and they need your passwords in

731
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:02,160
the first place.

732
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:03,160
What's going on over there?

733
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:04,160
Florida, man.

734
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:08,920
I sold them a Mac desktop app about five years ago and it doesn't work and they're mad.

735
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:10,720
So, see, full circle.

736
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:11,720
Oh, yeah.

737
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:12,720
Okay.

738
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:13,720
Yeah, there you go.

739
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:16,560
Hey, I want to say thank you to our QA members, Coder QA at CoderQA.co.

740
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:19,520
You have a Coderly that's been posted for this quarter.

741
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:20,520
Go there to join up.

742
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:23,760
You can get past Coderlys if you haven't yet, but it's really about supporting the show.

743
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:26,680
You get a limited ad feed as a thank you.

744
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:30,760
And you get to listen to Mike and I go on about stuff that's sort of like higher level

745
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:33,360
recap stuff in the quarter reports.

746
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:35,360
That's a CoderQA.co.

747
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:38,080
Mr. Dominic, is there anywhere you want to send people this week?

748
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:41,080
Go at Dumanuco on Twitter and we have a bunch.

749
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:47,880
We have two job openings at the Mad Botter right now, a junior Python developer and a

750
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:52,560
entry level QA engineer, but we're looking for someone who at least is somewhat familiar

751
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:53,560
with Python.

752
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:55,600
If you can't tell, we do a lot of Python.

753
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:56,640
There you go.

754
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:57,640
And where do they find that?

755
00:37:57,640 --> 00:38:00,920
I think this is a procurer slash the Mad Botter Inc.

756
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:01,920
Okay.

757
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:02,920
There you go.

758
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:04,200
Well, you can find me on Twitter.

759
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:05,200
I'm at Chris Ellis.

760
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:09,840
The network is at Jupiter Signal and this here podcast, yes, it does have a Twitter

761
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:14,080
handle which could be useful for like time changes or announcements, anything like that.

762
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:16,360
That's at Coder Radio Show.

763
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:20,360
And yeah, everything we talked about today and links and all that, that's at Coder.show

764
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:22,080
slash 427.

765
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:25,680
You're also going to find our contact form over there, our subscribe link and all that

766
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:27,960

We do this here show at 10 a.m. Pacific, what is that, 1 Eastern?

769
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:37,720
I don't know because I'm traveling, but you can get it all at JupiterBroadcasting.com

770
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:38,720
