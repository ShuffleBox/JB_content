00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,760
This is KOTOR Radio, episode 464 for May 2nd, 2022.

2
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:19,040
Hello good looking and welcome in to Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show, taking a

3
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:24,420
pragmatic look at the art and the business of software development and the world of technology.

4
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:29,160
My name is Chris and joining us, probably with a musical instrument in hand, it's our

5
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:30,640
host Mr. Dominic.

6
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:31,640
Hello Mike.

7
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:36,840
Hello and welcome to the very southern episode of KOTOR Radio.

8
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:40,000
Oh no, this is my fault.

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,440
I mentioned Kevin Spacey, now we're all Frank.

10
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:46,440
And I'm here for it, I'm here for it.

11
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:50,760
First of all, if I'm going to eat spare ribs, I'm going to do it before the restaurant opens

12
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:54,840
in an alley creepily wearing half a suit.

13
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:57,360
Right, I mean that's how you got to eat your barbecue, right?

14
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:01,960
And then when I take a girl on a date, if we're near a train, maybe you got to watch

15
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:02,960
out.

16
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:04,160
Don't go in the subway with Frank.

17
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:10,120
Although I should have read that Netflix contract quite a bit more carefully, quite a bit more.

18
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:14,520
Netflix might be knocking on the door of some of their original content actors and creators

19
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:17,800
because maybe they need to run the hits again, they're not doing so good my friend.

20
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:19,960
You know what, in America you can sue everybody.

21
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:23,480
I think we're about to witness peak streaming, we'll see.

22
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:27,040
Maybe the great streaming consolidation will happen.

23
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,000
I just want to interrupt here.

24
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,920
Someone heard my Kevin Spacey just now in the chat and literally said, bring back Jar Jar.

25
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,560
Oh no.

26
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:41,680
In 13 years, this is the first time anybody has ever asked for Jar Jar.

27
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:44,040
We didn't think it could get worse.

28
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:46,800
But if you some miss me, me some back bitches.

29
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:49,960
No we don't miss you.

30
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:54,120
Phantom Menace is better than the new prequels?

31
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:56,560
You know what, you might be right.

32
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:00,660
First of all, The Force Awakens is literally A New Hope with like a spit shine.

33
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:02,760
So that doesn't count.

34
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:03,760
Sorry.

35
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:04,760
Sorry.

36
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:08,780
Oh and Hayden Christensen is coming back because we can't help ourselves.

37
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:10,040
Let me ask you this though.

38
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:13,040
Okay, brace yourself because I think I got you here.

39
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:18,500
Isn't it more of an atrocity because Lucas was hands on with the prequels, whereas these

40
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:24,120
Disney bastardizations, they're like it's a whole new group of people, I mean it's some

41
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:27,280
people from LucasArts, but you know it's not it's not George.

42
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:32,800
But like the prequels were really bad and the acting and the writing was really really

43
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:36,060
bad and that's all on George's hands, right?

44
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:38,660
Like which is a bigger atrocity in my opinion.

45
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:39,660
It's worse.

46
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:41,600
I'm gonna tell you why it's worse.

47
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:45,360
See George Lucas is like a guy who was really really drunk and crashed his car and totaled

48
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,080
it.

49
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:52,960
Disney intentionally crashed the car stone sober for the insurance money for that sweet

50
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,960
sweet merchandising revenue.

51
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:55,960
That's probably true.

52
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,840
Plus it makes for some sweet theme parks.

53
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,480
I mean of course you need a Darth Vader for Gen Z.

54
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,960
I'm just saying like a look at what they did.

55
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:03,960
Who's Obi-Wan?

56
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:04,960
Um, Rey?

57
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:07,200
Kind of Luke I guess but like really Rey, right?

58
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:11,920
Oh and we have to add a super handsome dude who's a pilot because well didn't Han Solo

59
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:12,920
exist?

60
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:15,880
Yeah yeah he has to be like that certain kind of character too.

61
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:17,240
He's kind of roguish, right?

62
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,240
Exactly.

63
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:22,120
You know you know he's a good man but he's got some edges you know like like if you know

64
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:26,720
if your daughter brought him home you'd be like I don't know honey but damn he's so charming.

65
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:33,620
Let me throw another curveball at you because in the era of streaming a lot of classic legacy

66
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:36,200
I guess I don't know what to call them other than IP but I was trying to think of a better

67
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:40,480
word but you know what I'm talking about like your Star Trek's your Star Wars your Teenage

68
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:45,320
Mutant Ninja Turtles they've been brought back right like CBS All Access has like a

69
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:50,640
whole slate of Star Trek shows but they're all written by the same like team so all the

70
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:53,640
shows are kind of the same even though they're all different they're all different shows

71
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:57,220
but it's are all written by the same core writers and producers.

72
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:59,280
Do we have to bash Discovery again?

73
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:04,460
I mean I'm always I'm here for sure of course I mean that's easy but here's where I'm going

74
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:08,280
and I don't know if this is true or not but I'm wondering what you think.

75
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:14,760
Could it be that the problem is is that we are now watching content being created by

76
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,920
people that are younger than us?

77
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:20,040
So this is okay you have just opened a door.

78
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:25,400
There I say you have activated the spore drive and we're on the mycelial plane and I'm about

79
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,320
to dunk hard on Discovery.

80
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:29,280
Do you know what's wrong with Discovery?

81
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,280
What?

82
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:35,840
And I just finished watching all of Discovery and I thought I didn't like Voyager.

83
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:39,640
It makes Voyager look amazing and Voyager frankly isn't that bad.

84
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:42,400
Dude people hated Enterprise at the time.

85
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,760
You know what Enterprise is good.

86
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:47,680
It is taken to a whole nother level now and when you view it after watching Discovery

87
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,640
and Picard I'd seriously if you're a Star Trek fan.

88
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:55,240
If you're just curious about how how writing has changed, watch Picard or watch Discovery

89
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:58,880
and then go watch Enterprise and Enterprise was like the peak Star Trek production where

90
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:01,040
like the production was all normalized.

91
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,320
They had a whole machine behind it.

92
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:06,560
They had like these go-to character actors that played like pivotal roles like Jeffrey

93
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:11,440
Combs and Dorian.

94
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,440
He also plays a Ferengi.

95
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:16,880
I just watched the episode last night where he plays a Ferengi and it's just so great.

96
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:22,720
Even their weak episodes are better than the highlights of the season from Discovery.

97
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,760
So we're throwing out the doc at least for now.

98
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:26,760
Apparently yeah.

99
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,640
We're going with modern Star Trek.

100
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:30,640
So TNG doesn't count.

101
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:32,280
That's old Star Trek.

102
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:36,960
I just want to say I would say modern Star Trek starts with DS9 and Voyager which were

103
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:41,960
weirdly for folks who don't know like chronologically synchronized right like they're didn't they

104
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:46,000
air on opposite nights or something like they were they were direct competitors.

105
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,240
For our first couple of seasons of Voyager DS9 ran but I feel like the new era does start

106
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:55,000
with TNG but it just wasn't fully flushed out until like season six and seven.

107
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:00,360
Yeah I feel like most of TNG is basically better effects original Star Trek and then

108
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:04,880
DS9 it's really midway into DS9 where they start to get like the story continuity and

109
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:05,880
stuff like that.

110
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,800
I really I know people don't like DS9.

111
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:13,600
I actually really like DS9 and I've mentioned this before but I don't know I'm super down

112
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:17,960
with the idea that like what if you had to actually hold your goddamn ground right right

113
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:21,600
like you weren't just like flying away and having adventures that yeah.

114
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:25,480
And as a result they got some of the best guest stars exactly.

115
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:30,040
So the problem with Discovery is the most interesting character on the first season

116
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:33,280
of Discovery is Captain Lorca.

117
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:36,400
My wife says this every time we watch Discovery.

118
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:39,520
It's not that he's evil right it's not the spoilers I guess.

119
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,920
So I'll give you a beat one two.

120
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,300
There's your two beats.

121
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:46,660
If they didn't do the alternate dimension of bulls**t and just make him like a cartoon

122
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:53,160
character level villain in the next season how about an actual guy or gal it could be

123
00:06:53,160 --> 00:07:01,040
a gal it's not a gender thing it's it's whatever that was a Starfleet captain but kind of like

124
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:06,120
didn't buy into all the bulls**t right that kind of was like no we need to kill our enemies

125
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:09,120
because if I'm easy on them they kill my people.

126
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,440
Remember the Battle of the Binaries that's this whole thing right.

127
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:15,440
His whole argument before they make him a cartoon villain is but they murdered lots

128
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:19,120
of our people and they're super cool with killing women and children and civilians.

129
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:22,680
Yeah he was an interesting character he was a new spin on that role.

130
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:26,600
Honestly he's a more realistic like before they make him a cartoon character he's a lot

131
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:30,840
more like what like an actual military man would be like like no we gotta win.

132
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:34,560
Which would be time appropriate that would have been time appropriate back then.

133
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:38,900
But they couldn't help it because like we have to understand the people like the best

134
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:44,080
episode I think is the first season the Klingons are attacking the mining colony and you see

135
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:50,520
the man he's holding his child you know kids and everything and Lorca is just like no we're

136
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:57,440
getting there we're gonna dunk on them like the thirsty rigid head folks that they are.

137
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:02,000
And somehow we decided to have feelings again like this is Star Trek's fatal flaw to me

138
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,920
it believes in a reality that can't possibly exist and it is not the warp drive that's

139
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:08,920
the problem or the spore drive I hate Discovery.

140
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:13,260
If you watch the rest of Discovery like the emerald chain like that lady has a point right

141
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:18,440
like she's not wrong all the dilithium crystals are gone no one can do warp travel.

142
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:22,460
I love it you always identify with the villains it's so great.

143
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:27,680
No it's just like she's like dude let's make an alliance because we have to keep in line

144
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:34,380
if we don't keep it in line crazy pirates do crazy things and yeah they do.

145
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:37,320
Here's what I'm thinking and here's where I go with this.

146
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:42,540
So I think what it is is that the writers of these shows have a different set of values

147
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:47,480
so it reflects that in their writing and now I'm wondering as we talk about this does this

148
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:53,560
also apply to software like so let's just say for a moment that the average developer

149
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:58,820
of GNOME is like 25 27 maybe 30 years old.

150
00:08:58,820 --> 00:08:59,820
Is that true?

151
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:03,420
I don't know I don't think so but I have talked to several members of the GNOME project that

152
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:05,900
are young so they're like you know early 20s.

153
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:08,880
I mean we're not that much older.

154
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:12,740
It's a 20 year difference for me and so maybe there's just a different set of values and

155
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:14,260
10 for me but okay sure.

156
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:18,300
I'm wondering if that does play a factor in software development if what you know what

157
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:22,680
age you are what you value at that time what you focus on which may change over time better

158
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:26,700
or worse I'm not making a judgment call there but I wonder if that reflects just like we're

159
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:33,700
seeing it potentially reflected in Star Trek and in Star Wars do we see it in software

160
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:38,140
and is that maybe one of the problems we have in free software is we either have this issue

161
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:43,700
where it's a bunch of gray beards and once they age out nobody replaces them or we have

162
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:48,060
the opposite end of the spectrum where it's sort of like college kids or kids getting

163
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:52,840
out of high school which is great but also maybe not the best if they're the majority

164
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:53,840
of the project.

165
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:57,460
Well this is funny because you and I were having a private conversation earlier today

166
00:09:57,460 --> 00:10:01,420
and every once in a while I will mention on Twitter that I'm going to open a Cora Alice

167
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:06,000
or I'm going to try to and I get more hate for that than just saying I'm keeping it proprietary

168
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,780
to help you guys pay me.

169
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:12,500
Right and you know what it might be and I think this is what you're driving at I think

170
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:19,100
you just nailed it is it's like exposure bias because we are exposed to availability which

171
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:27,060
is Twitter, YouTube, things like Telegram, real-time chat rooms they're kind of a selective

172
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:32,860
group of people they're not necessarily representative of the broader spectrum of folks who have

173
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:38,780
a very busy life and don't have time to participate in an online community or don't have anything

174
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:43,100
to promote they don't have anything they want to let people know about so they literally

175
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:47,340
have no reason to engage in social media and can't be bothered to and so they don't get

176
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:49,940
their positions reflected properly in the conversation.

177
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:53,900
I'm gonna hit it a little harder though the folks being super negative and like mean to

178
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:58,540
each other also have very little or nothing of their own to promote and so there's no

179
00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:03,180
cost to them right like every time I do or say something stupid there's a cost to me

180
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:06,940
same for you right you've been everybody makes a mistake sure I mean folks don't know how

181
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:12,700
hard it is to do a live show every week it's easy to misspeak it's easy to say something

182
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:17,700
maybe where you assume that people are gonna take it with charity but uh I don't know if

183
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:21,060
you've ever been on reddit you can't always be up in your head either about well what

184
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:25,260
is the psychology of the person listening because then it just locks you up and it freezes

185
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:31,400
you up so it is it is a particularly challenging kind of work because you want to speak freely

186
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:37,060
so that way you can tell your you know your actual honest truth you can also be engaging

187
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:41,220
and at the same time if you're processing how are people gonna take this all the time

188
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:46,100
which you can't help but do but if you're doing that a lot you kind of ruin it you kind

189
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:50,260
of wreck the conversation and it kind of becomes this watered down discussion and that's a

190
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:57,140
tricky tricky thing and people can be upset because you know they look at situations differently

191
00:11:57,140 --> 00:12:00,060
anyways I didn't mean to derail you but I just wanted to kind of underscore like how

192
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:05,780
challenging that that is a challenging thing there yeah it's tough I mean we you know we've

193
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:09,940
gotten a lot of feedback you know this week some of it you know we've chosen to respond

194
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:16,340
to privately I mean I hadn't thought about it the way you had that maybe like I'm a little

195
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:22,300
younger than you right sorry your hair is better though so what do you care but like

196
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:29,260
we're not that far apart right maybe it is a generational thing that you know and who

197
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:35,580
knows right like maybe they're right I don't know I just you know to me I I came up in

198
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:42,220
that time when the big win if you were an engineer was to go talk to your manager or

199
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:46,780
the VP or whoever the director you know the companies of word structures and get them

200
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:51,860
to open source anything and even if that was like Apache or BSD open source even if they

201
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:58,060
were doing it for purely like to edge out a competitor like bad reasons that was a win

202
00:12:58,060 --> 00:13:02,860
you got a gold star here's your tux plushie and it didn't matter who you were right you

203
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:07,260
could be you know Planned Parenthood you could be the Catholic Church right if I'm trying

204
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:12,220
to go to extremes now it's kind of like well no but is the person who open sourced it in

205
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:16,420
some way evil I don't know I you know what there's a reason I'm gonna watch Star Trek

206
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:21,020
original series again and make myself feel better that's we should move on that's yeah

207
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:26,180
it's like it's TNG is like my security blanket I love it it's never goes wrong now DS 9 man

208
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:31,700
do you know why if Quark's bar ever existed I don't think I'd ever show up to the show

209
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:35,940
oh man I'd come down there I join you and we just do it from the bar in the holodeck

210
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:42,220
you just throw me in the holodeck actually would be down for that I could go for a holodeck

211
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:45,860
that's why maybe the VR was so appealing we're not gonna talk about our disappointment yet

212
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:52,260
are we no I was more like picturing us chilling in the bar you know having some drinks talking

213
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:56,100
some code or stuff I think that'd be pretty great I could drunk and at least talk to Cleons

214
00:13:56,100 --> 00:14:00,660
and see how that goes see yeah we'll see how long that last all right well now getting

215
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:08,300
into the show ask not what your podcast can boost for you but what you can boost for your

216
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:16,660
podcast snooze ejects boosted in with 2222 sets speaking of free software funding from

217
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:22,980
last episode did you guys know that the Mozilla Foundation is the 100% owner of a for-profit

218
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:26,520
corporation known as the Mozilla Corporation and did you know that the same person that

219
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:31,580
runs the foundation also runs the corporation and that the Linux Foundation has gotten into

220
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:37,340
selling NFTs on their hyper ledger while also selling their platinum membership which is

221
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:43,860
$500,000 a year to companies like Microsoft Meta Oracle VMware and others do you think

222
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:47,780
these types of foundations are bad for developers I can't help but notice the people who run

223
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:51,820
these foundations get rich and only a small handful of the people writing the software

224
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:56,260
make anything close to a livable wage I note here that this is a conversation that you

225
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:59,980
and I have been skirting around I think snooze eject kind of nails it right on the head in

226
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:04,940
an uncomfortable way that we didn't really want to say out loud curious and curiouser

227
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:09,260
I mean it does become concerning doesn't it yes that is definitely a diplomatic way to

228
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:13,980
put that yes I don't know what else to say about it though really you can't undo it I

229
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:16,900
don't think at this point you're not gonna unwind these foundations and in some way they

230
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:21,300
are at least paying for some stuff I just want to say for over a decade you and I have

231
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:26,060
been discussing funding software development and it's still a problem and I think that's

232
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:30,820
where maybe we should leave it I mean I know you're right and I know it's it's hopeless

233
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:34,380
but this is why I have been talking about the value for value model more and more even

234
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:38,580
though people hate it when I do but I think they need to hear this I think we have to

235
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:43,940
consider that foundations and Google and Amazon are not going to solve this problem and I

236
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:49,500
think we have to consider just building in and and and and creating this culture of a

237
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:54,740
mindset that if you get value from a free software project you exchange value in some

238
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:59,180
way back be it be documentation be it code be it monetary I mean I have another word

239
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:04,020
for that open core sure good that could be a way you could contribute core you could

240
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:08,840
contribute code back to the core you could help bug test it right you could have open

241
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:12,560
core can be very liberal right you think the beautiful thing about writing the license

242
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:15,980
is that you get to write the damn license I don't you can write any light it's like

243
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:19,380
any contract I think it's a culture problem I don't think it's a I don't think it's a

244
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:24,340
license problem I think it's a culture issue and I think I believe open source and free

245
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:29,480
software projects haven't been been selling their value they haven't been pitching they

246
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:33,700
don't they don't sell they don't sell that's basically they don't sell and they don't tell

247
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:39,980
users that we actually need this and I am also of the opinion that there really hasn't

248
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:44,420
been a good facility and means to do it and I think these boost type systems where you're

249
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:49,060
doing a peer-to-peer payment system where you can afford to send three dollars or two

250
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:53,140
dollars you can't even do that with the US dollar none of these payment systems make

251
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:58,520
it viable to send that kind of amount of money and so we have people who listen to this show

252
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:03,980
and they have turned on sat streaming in their podcasting 2.0 app and as they listen they

253
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:09,660
just send us a few sats in the background every few minutes and it ends up being maybe

254
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:13,020
55 cents for them at the end of the listening session or a dollar that you know whatever

255
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:19,380
they said it to and we could be doing that same exact thing we could be all of the technology

256
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:24,140
pipeline is there but we would still hit that cultural issue so we have to also fix that

257
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:28,220
it's something we have to bake in it's something we used to talk about more and it got away

258
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:33,460
from us and I think part in part because of these sort of centralizations that have occurred

259
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:37,860
and in part because of blowback that's occurred I mean I've been thinking about this a lot

260
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:42,280
it's been coming up a lot on the show I've also seen more free software projects embracing

261
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:47,700
things like matrix and mastodon for their coordination I even joined the podcasting

262
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:51,460
2.0 mastodon I'll put a link to that in the show notes just because you know I don't not

263
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:58,460
a big mastodon not a big social media person but it's sort of like a really niche focused

264
00:17:58,460 --> 00:18:03,060
communications platform where people are talking about the back end development that's happening

265
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:07,100
for podcasting 2.0 and the developers are communicating with other developers about

266
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:13,700
the things they're working on in this very vertical mastodon instance that might have

267
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:19,500
legs long term I don't know maybe not but it does feel like we've we've reached a tipping

268
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:25,220
point that is not healthy for small developers or developers of all these libraries that

269
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:29,800
kind of end up being the glue bits that you know turn colors on or can do something that

270
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:34,080
just is it nice to have that gets pulled in as a dependency and turns out you know tens

271
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:38,060
of thousands of projects are using that and that person's not making a dime and we have

272
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:42,820
the means we just don't have the will or the care to do it I think that's it not enough

273
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:47,500
people give a this is really not my role but I'm going to try to take down the negativity

274
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:53,940
oompa maybe there's a way forward I'm going to shut up about open core because it usually

275
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:58,980
lends us with a lot of bad emails but sometimes a compromise is better than nothing right

276
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:01,980
because I got to tell you with the and we're going to talk about Intel in a minute here

277
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:09,740
but with the M1 chips with Apple's just frankly Thanos level grip on independent developers

278
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:14,980
right now in terms of mobile but frankly the whole world right I think maybe we need to

279
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:20,980
make some compromises with values because the the alternative is these big listen the

280
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:26,300
Facebook VR store we had last week was horrific right fit what is it 50 percent they wanted

281
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:32,500
yeah basically it's it's unbelievable so if what you're doing isn't working you have to

282
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:37,220
stop and that's what I feel about frankly the Linux community at this point we're fighting

283
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:44,140
about stuff for no reason and I know and you know you and I both know a lot of folks who

284
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:48,860
are pretty deep into the community that are now quietly running M1 Mac pros and basically

285
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:53,180
not participating much not participating right they got good jobs or they they're doing their

286
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:57,740
businesses because they're just tired of the nonsense well this is an interesting email

287
00:19:57,740 --> 00:20:02,300
that came into the show that kind of reflects on this so Jimmy wrote in about the cycles

288
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:06,180
of centralization he says I like to listen on my walks and bike rides but I always forget

289
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:09,580
to send feedback maybe this will be great he says about the boost since it's right there

290
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:12,860
in the podcast app while I'm listening but he sent this in via the contact form he says

291
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:16,620
I know you guys have been talking a lot about decentralization in different contexts and

292
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:21,140
I wanted to add that I think this is just part of the oscillation of capitalism in general

293
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:25,280
it seems like industries have a tendency to centralize over time like gravity if you will

294
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:30,140
for a variety of reasons it's not just because a dominant player buys out others but also

295
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:35,060
because there is a certain economy of scale that lowers the price of products and services

296
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:39,560
also coincides with the lower barriers of entry for new users and customers and users

297
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:43,380
want the most with the least amount of effort and someone will always come around to offer

298
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:49,140
that which leads eventually to centralization and this routinely happens with technology

299
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:53,900
it'll even happen with cryptocurrencies eventually and you already do see it happen with companies

300
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:57,820
like coinbase and robin hood and cash app and stuff like that but he says technology

301
00:20:57,820 --> 00:21:01,620
will then oscillate back and something will break out to decentralize once again like

302
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:06,320
Batman and the Joker they're doomed to do this forever it's a feature not a bug we're

303
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:11,480
definitely in a centralization cycle right now and I think Jimmy kind of nails it maybe

304
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:16,580
some of these things we're talking about are gonna lead to to decentralizing more and maybe

305
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:23,060
we'll find a balance there it would be really interesting if all of this upset around Twitter

306
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:28,380
and the Elon purchase leads to Twitter becoming less relevant and then essentially we have

307
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:33,140
a decentralization of social media so then no one social media platform drives the media

308
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:37,480
narrative as much as we're seeing today that could be a great outcome it's essentially

309
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:41,980
Twitter becomes less relevant why do you think it'll become less relevant I could see it

310
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:46,900
happening simply because the folks behind the media companies are not going to take

311
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:51,340
a platform run by Elon they're not gonna run their whole slate of programming off of that

312
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:54,020
do you remember when we were watching the news and all of a sudden they just like started

313
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:57,980
putting up screenshots of Twitter all the time and it like it was weird right I think

314
00:21:57,980 --> 00:22:04,240
that fades away because Elon changes the general tone on the platform and the narrative I think

315
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:08,260
that means that they don't want to use it as a source of truth anymore it just seems

316
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:11,820
like it's a drug that's too easy to hit but we got to keep moving yeah you're right it

317
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:15,740
is it is very handy bossy right saying he says been listening for a few months love

318
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:19,000
the show I was wondering what your take is on Elon statement that free speech law should

319
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:23,540
apply to social media and what that means for the comment sections on places like websites

320
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:28,860
especially if it results in some sort of legislation do you think this will eventually have a trickle

321
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:33,620
down concern for small shops down the road once again love the show if kind of one of

322
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:37,460
the reactions to this is we start like you know following up on defamation and stuff

323
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:40,500
like that on social media like Twitter do you think that would spread to the rest of

324
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:49,280
the web yes but I have a probably surprising take on this I don't like a lot of what I

325
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:55,540
consider an overreaction to history in the moderation stuff like I really don't think

326
00:22:55,540 --> 00:23:01,020
you should go dig into someone's tweets or emails or whatever when they were like 18

327
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:06,580
or 17 or like a kid to them out of a job I sort of think we just all need to grow up

328
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:13,220
and like teenage boys in particular are kind of bad people and that's that's fine right

329
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:19,080
their kids kids are stupid Chris and I are both fathers we were pretty pretty they do

330
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:25,140
dumb things right that's why you have to protect children that's why they can't so like this

331
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:29,100
I hate this like witch hunt thing where we go back well when you were in college you

332
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:34,100
said this misogynist the thing I'm like well I don't know like Chris and I were lucky enough

333
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:39,620
that social media and for him it's even better was not a huge thing like it was just new

334
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:44,200
and I remember Facebook wasn't even at my school there are things I said in the really

335
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:49,660
early podcast like our cast a blast a podcast that we would never say or do now well right

336
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:56,260
like like I just want to say like teenage boys have some bad ideas because mostly they're

337
00:23:56,260 --> 00:24:02,700
joking and they're like immature so I I sort of I don't know how you can't you can't make

338
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:08,020
this a law you can't like legislate a free speech shield that no one can ever because

339
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:12,260
ultimately Twitter is a private corporation I think of it as clubs right if you're from

340
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:16,180
the north and I they have them down south but it seems to work differently here it's

341
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:20,340
a private club right if you're a member of the club there are certain standards of behavior

342
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:24,940
that they expect you to hold I have never been a member of one of these clubs because

343
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:30,740
I wasn't all right folks here's another Mike lesson in history stay a while stay a while

344
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:36,920
and listen part of living up north is like wasp exists if you don't know what that means

345
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:41,880
and if you are one you definitely know what that means and they don't like certain types

346
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:46,820
of people and it's surprising how expansive they are about not letting them into their

347
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:55,340
clubs and to me that's annoying it's been a source of irritation for me because I'm

348
00:24:55,340 --> 00:25:01,740
the way I am but I feel like a private company a private platform is a club ultimately and

349
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:07,600
if the owner of the club doesn't want you there well then he or she can throw you out

350
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:13,060
they could set the rules so again I hate that technology is so intertwined with this media

351
00:25:13,060 --> 00:25:17,640
crap now it's moderation crap because I would much rather be talking to you about cool python

352
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:23,580
packages but we we can't escape it I mean it affects my business it definitely affects

353
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:29,720
Chris's because advertising is a part of a whole mother he could speak to it more but

354
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:33,580
like you cannot piss off your advertisers and they're more sensitive than they've ever

355
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:38,220
been before not our specifically like the thing he's getting at with Elon is that the

356
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:41,540
big media brands will get mad because they don't like Elon and when they were pulled

357
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:45,460
the ad they were advertising from Twitter is that fair that is definitely one of the

358
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:51,260
concerns it seems to be yeah right so it's it's like I I don't know my my inner libertarian

359
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:57,180
is like yeah it's a private club you can throw people out but I can't imagine running my

360
00:25:57,180 --> 00:26:01,220
business the Mad Potter Inc without being able to use any social media because someone

361
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:05,380
didn't like that I'm like not super I think that's it I think that's the nut of it and

362
00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:09,780
I've been really struggling because I I really don't care but then I realized people view

363
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:15,700
this as like the platform they go to to express their position and now they're concerned that

364
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:19,420
ability is going to be taken away from them and other people go there because they feel

365
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:23,180
like they have to to be in order to even just reach a few hundred people I don't really

366
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:26,740
know I maybe there is something to it maybe it's more important than I realized or maybe

367
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:30,220
it's not maybe we're about to discover it's not that important at all and I feel like

368
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:34,340
that's the fork in the road we're at right now if you had to advertise to small and medium

369
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:39,340
businesses the idea of getting your company account or even your account banned on Twitter

370
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:47,220
or Facebook would be it's just not acceptable I mean it it is it is the most cost efficient

371
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:51,140
way to reach out to these folks all right well since we've already taken the show off

372
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:58,340
the rails completely I'm gonna go even deeper I've started a conversation that is really

373
00:26:58,340 --> 00:27:04,660
already exploding we're redoing everything online for Jupiter broadcasting us it's a

374
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:09,060
massive project I gotta have the community's help and that conversation kicked off in office

375
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:13,720
hours episode three office hours dot hair go there even if you just go there for the

376
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:19,420
links it's office how office hours dot hair slash three new website energy is the podcast

377
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:26,500
episode title we sat down with Alex Brent West myself just kind of outline some of the

378
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:30,620
ideas we have and then we put up a GitHub repo where we can start collecting ideas and

379
00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:34,580
it's just it's huge already and so I'd like to get the coder audience involved that seems

380
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:38,340
like an obvious step next and so I wanted to let everybody know I brought and bringing

381
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:42,780
you in behind the curtain for a moment that's happening right now it's a summer project

382
00:27:42,780 --> 00:27:48,180
our hosting provider let us know we have until the end of summer to get the F off the platform

383
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:52,700
so it's something we have a deadline we're serious about and we're kind of taking in

384
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:57,340
ideas and we've already gotten some ideas we hadn't even considered before so office

385
00:27:57,340 --> 00:28:02,380
hours dot here to check that out I am thinking things are about to get a little bit more

386
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:08,380
sketch Intel CEO Pat Gluster anticipates at the end of the chip shortages won't be until

387
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:15,380
2024 in fact he was originally saying 2023 but now it looks like things are even worse

388
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:21,260
I got a just a brief clip of him talking to Bloomberg about this issue overall though

389
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:27,660
the big story is around building up the semiconductor capacity and we had felt like 23 we start

390
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:33,020
to see that equilibrium now in no small part because of some of the equipment shortages

391
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:37,300
the equipment that goes into the fabs that we're building we're seeing those lead times

392
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:42,140
push out substantially and as a result we expect the overall semiconductor shortage

393
00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:50,180
to not be resolved until 2024 now as some of those capacities come online yeah and Apple

394
00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:55,260
in their earnings call a couple of days ago said they expect an eight billion dollar reduction

395
00:28:55,260 --> 00:29:00,720
in sales due to in large part the COVID-19 lockdowns in China that will reduce supply

396
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:08,260
chain and Tim Cook said they're considering spinning up more supply chain or more manufacturing

397
00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:11,780
but the supply chain issue would still remain an issue so even if they bring manufacturing

398
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:17,180
over to India he said they still can't get the bits they need to actually build the devices

399
00:29:17,180 --> 00:29:22,140
eight billion dollars by the way is like an entire business right it is all of like the

400
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:28,580
iPad sales for Apple well yeah I guess but it's a big chunk of change it's a lot of money

401
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:34,460
and here's what's even scarier is Intel didn't meet their expectations that's not good so

402
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:39,180
Intel stock is down but it's not too bad it's bounced back a little bit but the CEO in there

403
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:43,500
in that full clip that I'll have linked in the show notes part of what he says is gonna

404
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:49,020
make things work out and everything's gonna be rosy and we don't need to worry is that

405
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:55,800
he says they're expecting a large commercial purchase in the fall for like refreshing machines

406
00:29:55,800 --> 00:30:00,340
at businesses now that people are coming back to work and he expects a whole bunch of business

407
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:04,800
machines to be replaced and so he thinks that's gonna boost their sales a whole bunch may

408
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:10,900
happen but if it doesn't happen it looks like Intel could be set for some serious losses

409
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:14,620
I'm gonna avoid the political stuff because I think we've done enough of that here but

410
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:19,100
like it would be great if maybe things weren't built in one specific place right just saying

411
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:23,980
yeah but that that's that is what it is now right so that that's that ship sailed right

412
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:31,380
that happened in the 80s or late 80s really nice I you know it if I was buying a laptop

413
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:44,420
right now and my choices were Intel AMD one of the new AMD is right or Apple I would probably

414
00:30:44,420 --> 00:30:49,540
Intel would be my last choice I guess is how I should put it they're frankly not that competitive

415
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:52,900
but that's why I think they think this what the CEO says in that interview like the commercial

416
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:58,380
market now is their bread and butter the business machines people that I have work desktops

417
00:30:58,380 --> 00:31:04,220
run Windows I can see that Dell effectively Dell yeah your Dell's in your HP's right and

418
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:09,100
then you have gamers are probably buying rise in systems or some of the high-end Intel systems

419
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:12,500
but they're just not a huge percentage of their purchases and now you have Apple one

420
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:16,340
of the largest PC sellers is no longer using their chips and so they're focusing on commercial

421
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:21,200
well and the other news we don't have the notice is that Apple's Mac sales have skyrocketed

422
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:25,300
the reason Apple's reporting a shortfall is because they can't make enough of them in

423
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:29,900
fact I think they were the only PC manufacturer to show significant growth in the last quarter

424
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:35,340
yeah it's those M1 machines but it's not just Intel and Apple it's gonna be the whole industry

425
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:40,940
and you know at first we were back in 2021 we were told you know it'd be better it'd

426
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:45,860
be better mid 2022 then we got to 2022 or so well it looks like it's gonna be 2023 now

427
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:49,660
we're not even to mid 2022 and they say well now it's gonna be 2024 both Apple and Intel

428
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:56,740
are saying this isn't gonna be better until 2024 and I wonder if there is opportunity

429
00:31:56,740 --> 00:32:03,840
for developers in the midst of this chaos and I this could be way off but what if we

430
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:11,820
saw a bit of a kind of Cuban car moment happen with our technology where because we cannot

431
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:18,380
get our hands on the new stuff in this case it's supply chain issues but for the Cubans

432
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:23,540
you know it was an embargo and so they couldn't import new cars and so they had no choice

433
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:27,940
but to develop a car culture and repair them and keep them running and now they have some

434
00:32:27,940 --> 00:32:32,000
of the most beautiful classic cars in the world and they're like a specialty item that

435
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:37,460
that rich people import and I have an article about this that talks about how once that

436
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:44,540
US embargo was created and the banning of American cars and parts was in place Cuba

437
00:32:44,540 --> 00:32:51,020
just essentially did a huge DIY repair program what if we saw something like that happen

438
00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:55,220
again maybe not like full-fledged it's only gonna be for a few years but what if what

439
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:59,380
if like those kiosks in the mall start coming back that offer screen repair and battery

440
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:04,660
replacement and yeah it's not as easy but at least they can do it and you know maybe

441
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:09,260
maybe we start seeing more of that and people reuse stuff instead of get rid of it is that

442
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:14,280
an impossibility yeah I mean I think that's possible I don't think it's gonna be as widespread

443
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:19,940
as you'd like I mean the dirty little secret here is for most business users you know the

444
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:25,100
current processors are just fine yeah I mean we we have a story that I don't think we're

445
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:29,220
gonna dive into deeply this week but we'll do it next week about it's from Hacker News

446
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:33,940
why why are all these terminal development companies going to the cloud to the web and

447
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:40,200
the answer is well because the world has changed having a honking workstation is not that important

448
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:46,860
for most business users in fact most things are now over the network so I mean we mentioned

449
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:55,500
warp terminal the forgot his name Zach Zachary something but he's a formal Google Drive engineer

450
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:59,660
he's a he had a fancy title but you know his whole thing is he basically wants to take

451
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:07,440
the Google Docs experience to the terminal and that's I don't know I mean I'm currently

452
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:11,620
hiring something we're gonna talk about a little bit that I would prefer to hire on

453
00:34:11,620 --> 00:34:17,460
site but that seems almost impossible though my point is it makes less and less sense to

454
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:22,600
spend a lot of money on individual folks as computers than it does to spend on honking

455
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:27,440
frankly server equipment or cloud services that can synchronize our work between everybody

456
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:32,520
totally I could see cloud workstations become even more popular in this supply chain crunch

457
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:37,940
and what a great time to also save cost yeah and then also that really works a lot better

458
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:41,360
for work at home too because they can just open up that remote cloud terminal using a

459
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:48,580
client software at home and they have the same experience in security and for for InfoSec

460
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:52,740
if the person leaves the company or whatever no shows for three days you just disable their

461
00:34:52,740 --> 00:34:57,140
access that's it they have nothing I know we have some listeners that are using cloud

462
00:34:57,140 --> 00:35:00,760
desktops and they've been using them for a little bit so I'd love to know what your experience

463
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:05,560
has been and if you see this market growing coder dot show slash contact or send us in

464
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:10,280
a podcasting 2.0 boost and let us know what your experience has been and where you think

465
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:19,960
it's going lino.com slash coder go there to get $100 and 60 day credit on a new account

466
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:25,240
and you go there to support this here show Linode is fast reliable fantastic cloud hosting

467
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:28,640
you've got to go try it for your next project it's what I've used for the last couple of

468
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:33,560
years now and Linode has been rolling out MVME storage so the rigs are super fast they

469
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:38,320
have 11 data centers around the world and they're always optimizing for performance

470
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:43,660
and they have 30 to 50 percent lower prices than the big hyperscalers that want to lock

471
00:35:43,660 --> 00:35:49,060
you into their esoteric platforms and if you're gonna be at KubeCon EU say hi to Linode they

472
00:35:49,060 --> 00:35:55,460
got a booth there May 16th through the 20th in Spain man am I jealous of that if you're

473
00:35:55,460 --> 00:35:59,600
a performance hound you're gonna love Linode if you've never set up a server before you're

474
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:04,920
gonna be fine at Linode and if you've been racking and stacking boxes for 20 years you're

475
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:10,480
gonna love how much easier Linode just made your job they have great documentation their

476
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:15,740
API is clean and simple and the reality is there's a ton of tooling already built for

477
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:22,640
you to take advantage of libraries command line tools apps it's great Linode's been doing

478
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:27,980
this for nearly 19 years so they've built a passionate community and a dedicated following

479
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:35,380
some of your absolute favorite projects apps media companies the whole range they run on

480
00:36:35,380 --> 00:36:40,820
Linode Linode turns out is the secret sauce behind a ton of our favorite online companies

481
00:36:40,820 --> 00:36:44,320
not all of them talk about it all the time because you know it's part of their secret

482
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:50,480
we get it but we know oh we know and often you'll find people proudly talking about it

483
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:55,040
because when you've been a Linode customer you generally have great things to say and

484
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:59,800
one of the things I hear from coder listeners all the time is that nobody beats Linode support

485
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:07,000
so when you got great pricing great performance great support and it's a way to support independent

486
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:11,920
productions like this here podcast well that's a pretty good combination so go try it for

487
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:17,920
real go learn something go build something go try something and get that $100 Linode.com

488
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:24,080
slash coder stay a while and listen I've been waiting to hear a bit of a story from you

489
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:29,960
I I have a sense that you had a comedy of errors occur oh yes so we'll do this quick

490
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:34,960
because we're at the end of the show so we had a partnership uh or have I'm not gonna

491
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:41,120
exactly name names because I didn't get permission I got an email abruptly telling me that you

492
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:44,960
know basically go pound sound we were not interested in being in business with you this

493
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:49,200
was an Alice partnership oh lovely lovely if you're a longtime listener of the show

494
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:54,360
you can imagine how I would respond to that kind of thing not not well not well and you

495
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:58,800
know poor form on my part too it turned out that what had happened is that there was another

496
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:05,280
dude named Michael that they were in a partnership with no and the the yes the person had a medical

497
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:12,220
issue that I was dealing with and he had to be on leave for a week so his interim got

498
00:38:12,220 --> 00:38:19,320
confused and very awkwardly sent a check to the other company who the gentleman running

499
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:25,240
that company's name was Mike and fired us of course it was it wasn't they weren't a

500
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:31,020
client it wasn't a firing but it was like a dissolving our our relationship so this

501
00:38:31,020 --> 00:38:35,800
guy comes back and we had done nothing that we had agreed to do because obviously you

502
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:40,600
know I thought whatever happened happened and there was this very I can only describe

503
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:47,880
this this zoom call as the most cringe core thing I've ever had where basically like well

504
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:52,760
you freaked out what's going on I'm like well you know you guys you you didn't keep your

505
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:57,920
obligations and then you just ghosted us and then you came back and said and it just ended

506
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:04,400
up the two of them I thought wait huh they muted there was a misunderstanding he had

507
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:10,160
the wrong email there's another Michael at something yeah that is literally what happened

508
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:15,120
it's common there's a lot of Chris's out there too and it's made me think like we really

509
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:20,400
should have come up with some kind of ID verify in email yeah like maybe not mandatory but

510
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:24,040
really common practice would have been great well and I just want to say the email I got

511
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:30,840
was was was like hard it wasn't a hey man sorry things it was a frankly go-pound-sand

512
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:35,700
email somebody was surprised they just got a big bill and they were angry right and which

513
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:38,720
is weird because we didn't build them anything because we were partnering with them and doing

514
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:45,760
a rev share so I was kind of like what and then of course the natural response to so

515
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:49,920
scummy MBA types well unless I skim this mean but MBA types when they send you a mean email

516
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:53,960
will never answer your calls again they want it all documented but I tried like the next

517
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:58,460
morning because the email came in like midnight I'm like you know what I've been there I've

518
00:39:58,460 --> 00:40:03,060
sent the bad email I've sent the bad slack message maybe somebody's you know frankly

519
00:40:03,060 --> 00:40:09,080
in their cups let's just take a breath we'll call in the morning oh I couldn't even like

520
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:12,820
I was getting straight like you can tell when your numbers blocked because it just rings

521
00:40:12,820 --> 00:40:19,000
out and you always get the voicemail right and yeah it was it still continues to be awkward

522
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:23,320
so we should write it back and like hey go learn about GPG keys let's get this no I'm

523
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:27,800
kidding of course that's not gonna work I sent them Alice stickers actually because

524
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:35,960
I'm a dick tailscale.com slash coder go there to get a free personal account for up to 20

525
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:41,880
devices and of course you're supporting the show tailscale is a zero config VPN you installed

526
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:46,400
on any machine or device in minutes it'll take care of the firewall rules and I gotta

527
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:53,920
say it also manages that dreaded carrier double net some of us end up with hand on heart last

528
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:59,920
night before bedtime this was for me I'm an old man is about 9 30 p.m. and I realized

529
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:05,600
that I had just figured out how to fix something on one of the devices in the studio like it

530
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:11,760
just came to me and I was like oh god it's so obvious and you know the beautiful thing

531
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:19,040
is is on my iPad I have tailscale and I have the Termulus app and I have my tailscale IPS

532
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:25,800
for my different hosts already saved in there so I fired my iPad in you know half a second

533
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:32,760
and I'm connected even quicker to this host that's here at the studio and I'm parked out

534
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:39,000
in the woods at the foot of the Cascade Mountains on Verizon or AT&T or you know I don't know

535
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:43,520
brand I don't know which network I was on because I'm on this mobile setup I have but

536
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:50,560
either way I am natted up the wazoo and tailscale just works instantly you can quickly and easily

537
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:56,040
create a secure flat network between you your servers your computers your devices this is

538
00:41:56,040 --> 00:42:00,160
a way I've brought my different VPS systems together on their same network and I can actually

539
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:05,600
connect them to my systems that I have here at the studio there may be running in a VM

540
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:09,720
it's also how I keep connected to my family's computers and provide support I have a run

541
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:15,240
on everything from Raspberry Pi to iPads huge arch x86 boxes openSUSE and machines I mean

542
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:20,920
you name it and the devices they connect through your existing identity provider and there's

543
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:26,000
a lot of consumer options but you can easily also use a business option and work with multi-factor

544
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:31,560
authentication de-authorized devices as you need and all of this is protected with WireGuard's

545
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:36,640
noise protocol I knew WireGuard was going to change the game but tailscale has taken

546
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:40,920
this to the next level and they've just made a solution here that's changed the way I work

547
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:45,120
forever you got to try it for yourself and you can try it for free for up to 20 machines

548
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:52,080
and you go to tailscale.com slash coder free for up to 20 devices and you support the show

549
00:42:52,080 --> 00:43:02,920
tailscale.com slash coder this is a weird awkward situation a longtime free app used

550
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:08,960
by many in our community is looking to go subscription telegram is adding a premium

551
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:14,080
subscription according to current betas and we don't know the price yet because that information

552
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:19,760
is not in the beta builds but we do know it looks like as a perk you're going to get very

553
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:26,300
special stickers and you're going to get a special emoticon customizer and probably other

554
00:43:26,300 --> 00:43:34,240
things of which we do not know yet but here we are in 2022 and another app that's been

555
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:40,440
essentially supercharged by being free I got to imagine it's expensive because I've uploaded

556
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:44,960
like 400 megabyte video files to telegram and they take them right I mean the file storage

557
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:51,480
alone just based on having 2,000 users on our matrix server I can tell you it's astronomical

558
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:57,240
if they have you know millions and millions but here we are I just feels like another

559
00:43:57,240 --> 00:44:02,840
subscription are you serious like I love telegram and I use the crap out of it but oh my god

560
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:08,400
dude another subscription I'm gonna die I want to like cut back and like what I subscribe

561
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:14,040
to is like really considered stuff that really makes a difference stuff that makes a difference

562
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:21,040
in my life or or whoever I'm supporting and I just cannot get behind like arbitrary subscriptions

563
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:27,480
for all of this stuff what else can we do I don't know but there it is telegrams going

564
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:32,520
premium you don't care you're not a telegram user anymore are you no I don't use telegram

565
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:38,000
anymore that's how I feel that's how I feel because I know I'm gonna get it I'm gonna

566
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:42,960
be getting upselled 30 times a day eventually that's how it all it always goes this way

567
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:47,560
you know it always comes back to you how do we fund software development I swear to god

568
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:51,360
if they would just let me throw them a few sats you know once a day or something I'd

569
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:55,380
be happy all right just a little follow-up before we get to your hiring news we talked

570
00:44:55,380 --> 00:45:00,600
about this last week Apple has now shared a new developer update clarifying its App

571
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:04,580
Store improvement policies it's extending the amount of time it's giving developers

572
00:45:04,580 --> 00:45:09,820
to update their apps that have been updated in two years from 30 days to 90 days but here's

573
00:45:09,820 --> 00:45:15,880
the part that I do not like Apple says that apps that have not been updated within the

574
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:23,600
past three years and which do not meet a minimum threshold for downloads i.e. extremely few

575
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:28,800
or limited downloads in a rolling 12-month period are still subject to the policy and

576
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:34,340
those developers will get notices via email so I guess an apps value is determined by

577
00:45:34,340 --> 00:45:39,400
its downloads you know I could see where they were coming from but there's there was a good

578
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:45,080
conversation on the iOS dev I think or underscore dev there's two of them on reddit were game

579
00:45:45,080 --> 00:45:48,960
developers were kind of bitching like you guys don't understand we write the game we

580
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:55,880
update unity and it basically runs for years we and you know we their sales are so meager

581
00:45:55,880 --> 00:46:00,800
for the for most of them right it's a video game right they sell the you how many times

582
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:05,720
everybody is about to be forced to buy Sonic one two and three again because Sega's releasing

583
00:46:05,720 --> 00:46:11,880
them it's the same it's the same and I'm gonna be one of you so I don't this is not me dunking

584
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:17,440
but it's like this is a stupid policy if if the app works if the game works Apple should

585
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:22,360
just leave it on the store here's my angle like you can't have a both ways Apple if you

586
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:27,200
don't want a sideloading and I got a small team and you know we need an app for doing

587
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:31,380
business or maybe we're maybe when we're out in the field doing live stuff we have like

588
00:46:31,380 --> 00:46:38,140
a Jupiter broadcasting team app and it's got 10 users so you know okay well should I come

589
00:46:38,140 --> 00:46:41,440
up with some way to sideload that so we all enroll in some sort of developer program should

590
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:46,800
I should I force all of the volunteers of JB to to get enrolled in some sort of device

591
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:52,040
management system like what is my solution here other than to distribute in the App Store

592
00:46:52,040 --> 00:46:56,160
and now because I've built something and I've utilized the only distribution mechanism they'll

593
00:46:56,160 --> 00:47:00,800
let me use in any real meaning way meaningful way because I've utilized the only system

594
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:06,240
they've made available I'm now being punished for it like there are actually apps I mean

595
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:09,920
they probably should be pulled but there are apps that we've distributed like that just

596
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:14,560
want you know some quick app that we've created as a tool or a concept that we put in the

597
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:20,040
App Store we only internally you know had you know we told a few people about it wanted

598
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:24,620
to be able to tell randos so we wanted it public and you know that probably would not

599
00:47:24,620 --> 00:47:31,200
qualify it's probably been cold let the people sideload Apple make it a pain in the ass never

600
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:37,380
gonna happen all right well you know what is happening the mad botters hiring that's

601
00:47:37,380 --> 00:47:43,520
happening got several positions yes we are we have three positions yes typescript developer

602
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:48,320
lot of ionic lot of angular very mobile focus but you know desktop too right because the

603
00:47:48,320 --> 00:47:53,760
world is hard we have three positions a more senior Python developer a junior Python developer

604
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:58,360
and this typescript position all of them are preferred on site and plant city which I think

605
00:47:58,360 --> 00:48:03,360
is going to be the topic of next week's show Chris what do you think I'm down okay but

606
00:48:03,360 --> 00:48:08,960
there are remote options available with the caveats that we only have what do they call

607
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:13,280
them employment charters or that's not the right word but in the US you have to have

608
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:18,360
a license but you have to be registered as an employer in each state so right now we're

609
00:48:18,360 --> 00:48:22,480
only registered in New Jersey and Florida ah so they have to be a contractor if they're

610
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:26,520
remote if they're not in either of those states they would have we would have to work something

611
00:48:26,520 --> 00:48:31,320
else out yeah yeah yeah or we could open like if it's Georgia it's different because you're

612
00:48:31,320 --> 00:48:36,400
right here but yeah I want a job but I just want to get paid under the table for it is

613
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:43,160
that doable yeah it's very hard to do that anymore trust me I mean whoa no no so two

614
00:48:43,160 --> 00:48:49,680
Python roles we're very heavy on fast API and flask a lot of ginger to lot of ginger

615
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:54,880
too and the types of stuff is almost all angular all right we'll have a link to that in the

616
00:48:54,880 --> 00:49:01,320
notes at coder dot show slash 464 oh and a fancy new domain name because I was jealous

617
00:49:01,320 --> 00:49:06,680
of your office hours are you ready yeah are you ready totally ready forget the mad potter

618
00:49:06,680 --> 00:49:17,720
dot com what is that crap whoo so long t mb dot i n c t mb dot inc and inc in the ink

619
00:49:17,720 --> 00:49:21,680
that's that is that's legit you know it's legit that's how you do it dot hairs over

620
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:26,520
in clown town but that's that's getting to work I tried to buy the dot hair and it's

621
00:49:26,520 --> 00:49:30,920
weird it showed me a giffy of you yeah like flipping your luxurious locks that wouldn't

622
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:35,520
let me do it I got to be careful also hits the microphone makes a big noise I want to

623
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:39,880
say a special thank you to our members over at coder qa.co that's a way to give value

624
00:49:39,880 --> 00:49:45,400
back to the show on an ongoing basis and it really makes a difference it lets us be picky

625
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:50,180
you know I don't talk about it because it sounds like we're bragging but we get lots

626
00:49:50,180 --> 00:49:56,200
of offers every single week for all kinds of weird sponsorships or limited run things

627
00:49:56,200 --> 00:50:03,360
or fly-by-night operations or another really common one is people want to pay us to have

628
00:50:03,360 --> 00:50:09,320
like their marketing person on the show or something like that and our members give us

629
00:50:09,320 --> 00:50:13,720
the flexibility to say no to all that kind of stuff and as a thank you you get an ad

630
