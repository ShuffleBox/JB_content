00:00.000 --> 00:15.880
This is Kota Radio, episode 439, for November 8th, 2021.

00:15.880 --> 00:19.400
Hello old friend and welcome back to Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show, taking a

00:19.400 --> 00:25.500
pragmatic look at the art in the business, software development, and the world of technology.

00:25.500 --> 00:27.680
This episode is brought to you by Cloud Guru.

00:27.680 --> 00:33.040
You know they have that cloud playground, Azure AWS, or Google Cloud Sandboxes on ACG's

00:33.040 --> 00:34.460
credit card.

00:34.460 --> 00:35.620
Not yours.

00:39.720 --> 00:44.240
My name is Chris and joining us every single week is our Handsome as Hell host, hello Mr.

00:44.240 --> 00:45.240
Dominic.

00:45.240 --> 00:47.600
Well, how are you doing, you fine gentleman?

00:47.600 --> 00:48.600
What an introduction.

00:48.600 --> 00:49.600
I'm honored.

00:49.600 --> 00:52.160
Well, I mean, I recognize game.

00:52.160 --> 00:54.680
You know what I'm saying?

00:54.680 --> 00:55.680
Takes one to know one.

00:55.680 --> 00:57.060
I got butterflies today.

00:57.060 --> 00:59.000
I'm a little nervous.

00:59.000 --> 01:03.720
I woke up this morning and I had a shipping update notification.

01:03.720 --> 01:07.500
You know, so I ordered that MacBook Pro M1 Max.

01:07.500 --> 01:13.160
You know, I saved up my pennies, my Bitcoins, and I waited for them to rev the M1 platform

01:13.160 --> 01:16.560
and I ordered it and it said, oh, you're going to get it December 24th.

01:16.560 --> 01:18.480
And I thought, well, okay, that's fine.

01:18.480 --> 01:19.480
I'm in no rush.

01:19.480 --> 01:22.120
Then they updated it and said, you're going to get it November 24th.

01:22.120 --> 01:25.280
And I thought, oh, all right, great.

01:25.280 --> 01:31.380
And this morning the update came in and it says November 17th, which is like next week.

01:31.380 --> 01:32.880
That's way too soon.

01:32.880 --> 01:34.240
I am not ready for this.

01:34.240 --> 01:37.180
I am actually nervous.

01:37.180 --> 01:40.320
I'm not, I need to, first of all, I need to prepare the way I have not prepared the way

01:40.320 --> 01:41.320
at all for this.

01:41.320 --> 01:45.760
I have like a bunch of stuff I need to back up and archive off of my other machines.

01:45.760 --> 01:47.000
I need to do backups.

01:47.000 --> 01:49.360
I need to reorganize my entire desk.

01:49.360 --> 01:50.360
I got it.

01:50.360 --> 01:53.800
I just, I'm not ready for this because the other thing I am legitimately worried about

01:53.800 --> 02:00.360
is what if I really, really, really, really like it and then like it's the only machine

02:00.360 --> 02:01.360
I want to use.

02:01.360 --> 02:02.360
And what does that mean?

02:02.360 --> 02:03.360
And what does that make me?

02:03.360 --> 02:05.520
And I'm still going through a lot of it right now.

02:05.520 --> 02:08.280
And I thought I had like another few weeks to process this.

02:08.280 --> 02:11.520
And then I wake up and I see it's coming and I think I'm the first guy ever who wishes

02:11.520 --> 02:15.100
it was getting delayed and not accelerated.

02:15.100 --> 02:16.320
So that's me this morning.

02:16.320 --> 02:17.320
How are you?

02:17.320 --> 02:23.520
Well, I'm definitely better than you, although I did acquire Age of Empires IV.

02:23.520 --> 02:28.080
And I'm irritated that through all my parallel sorcery, I can't get that running because

02:28.080 --> 02:31.240
of DirectX 12.

02:31.240 --> 02:38.800
And apparently there's just so much crap in DirectX 12 that the VM folks can't make that

02:38.800 --> 02:39.800
work.

02:39.800 --> 02:45.600
And I think this is a great segue to our Python on Windows for 2021 thing because I can tell

02:45.600 --> 02:48.840
you that Age of Empires is a required part of my life.

02:48.840 --> 02:52.840
And if I can't get this running, that's going to be a problem.

02:52.840 --> 02:59.000
So I know the secret incantations you need to unlock the compatibility powers when they

02:59.000 --> 03:00.880
do become available.

03:00.880 --> 03:05.200
So what you have to do is you're going to want to keep an eye on ProtonDB.

03:05.200 --> 03:10.160
So when you see that that version of the game has a good rating on ProtonDB.

03:10.160 --> 03:12.520
Now if you're on Linux, you're pretty much done.

03:12.520 --> 03:18.120
If you're using the Mac, the next thing you got to watch for is Windows crossover office,

03:18.120 --> 03:22.080
say they support that or have the version of wine that has the current version of all

03:22.080 --> 03:23.280
the stuff you need.

03:23.280 --> 03:27.320
I have done a little bit of reading about this because I was curious, like, what am

03:27.320 --> 03:29.800
I going to do with all these GPU cores?

03:29.800 --> 03:31.200
I'd like to be able to play a video game.

03:31.200 --> 03:32.200
What a concept.

03:32.200 --> 03:35.720
And it turns out there's other things I might want to play than what's an Apple arcade.

03:35.720 --> 03:42.960
And so it seems as ludicrously stupid as it sounds, people are actually having good success

03:42.960 --> 03:51.760
to a degree with crossover office running x86 Windows games on the new machines.

03:51.760 --> 03:56.320
So if you want to do like seven layers of emulation and oh, sorry, not emulation.

03:56.320 --> 03:58.840
I was just going to say it's not an emulator.

03:58.840 --> 03:59.840
Wine is not an emulator.

03:59.840 --> 04:04.480
Yeah, it's a translation, although the x86 stuff will absolutely be emulation.

04:04.480 --> 04:07.140
So yeah, well, actually, maybe not.

04:07.140 --> 04:10.360
Maybe M1 does actually execute some of the I don't know.

04:10.360 --> 04:12.280
But either way, it's a lot of turtles.

04:12.280 --> 04:15.720
Okay, but I'm on a Intel Xeon.

04:15.720 --> 04:20.680
And the problem is actually that there is no direct translation for DirectX 12 into

04:20.680 --> 04:24.360
either Metal or OpenGL that exists in the world today.

04:24.360 --> 04:29.840
And if you go on the Parallels Forum, they're like, yeah, dude, what are you doing?

04:29.840 --> 04:31.960
Isn't this like the classic problem?

04:31.960 --> 04:36.280
Like now Apple is going to build some of the most competitive performance machines out

04:36.280 --> 04:37.840
there.

04:37.840 --> 04:42.700
And it's like when you're when you're investing in four grand in a laptop, it really should

04:42.700 --> 04:45.640
be able to do absolutely everything.

04:45.640 --> 04:52.520
Even if you only do some of those things occasionally, a tool at that price point should be comprehensive.

04:52.520 --> 04:57.140
And video games is something I expect to have an expensive computer with a bunch of GPU cores.

04:57.140 --> 04:58.720
So I don't know.

04:58.720 --> 05:02.760
I guess the only solution is as shops decided to start supporting the Mac.

05:02.760 --> 05:09.360
But it is very funny that we are now at a point where the situation is significantly

05:09.360 --> 05:13.800
better on Linux for gaming than it is the Mac.

05:13.800 --> 05:15.240
Especially with the M1 transition.

05:15.240 --> 05:19.400
I mean, so I'm reading on your suggestion, the ProtonDB entry for AOE4.

05:19.400 --> 05:21.360
It's not great.

05:21.360 --> 05:24.440
This definitely reminds me of back in the early aughts getting World of Warcraft to

05:24.440 --> 05:29.360
run on Ubuntu Brown Edition, whatever number that was, 8.10, 9.10, whatever.

05:29.360 --> 05:33.760
But apparently there is some sorcery, but the textures, I guess, still kind of aren't

05:33.760 --> 05:35.560
up to snuff.

05:35.560 --> 05:36.560
I don't know.

05:36.560 --> 05:40.160
I mean, I got to be honest with you, I don't play that many games anymore.

05:40.160 --> 05:43.680
Yeah, like right when I got divorced, I did a lot of gaming, then I like went back to

05:43.680 --> 05:44.680
the mean.

05:44.680 --> 05:48.840
Like Age of Empires is so core to my desire to conquer the world.

05:48.840 --> 05:53.400
I mean, to be Mark Zuckerberg, I mean, oh, God.

05:53.400 --> 05:56.040
It's just my, it's one of my favorite games, right?

05:56.040 --> 05:59.320
And this, I have seen very little of this.

05:59.320 --> 06:03.360
I accidentally logged into my Microsoft account and it was like, yo, dog, we have AOE4 and

06:03.360 --> 06:06.400
I was like, here's $60.

06:06.400 --> 06:09.440
That's pretty much me and the new Metroid games.

06:09.440 --> 06:14.160
Or if they do another Breath of the Wild based game with that same engine or something, it's

06:14.160 --> 06:16.840
an absolute automatic buy from me.

06:16.840 --> 06:19.240
That's where the Switch does scratch that itch.

06:19.240 --> 06:21.320
It's like the guaranteed I'm going to sit down.

06:21.320 --> 06:22.320
Switch is amazing.

06:22.320 --> 06:23.320
Mm-hmm.

06:23.320 --> 06:24.320
It's, and it works every time.

06:24.320 --> 06:26.640
You know, every now and then there's like a super quick update or whatever, but they're

06:26.640 --> 06:27.880
actually all pretty painless.

06:27.880 --> 06:29.840
You know, can we inside baseball?

06:29.840 --> 06:30.840
Yeah.

06:30.840 --> 06:34.920
One of the reasons I didn't get an M1 Mac Pro is one, I kind of knew about AOE4 coming

06:34.920 --> 06:39.360
out and I had a feeling I'd end up buying a Dell desktop.

06:39.360 --> 06:41.960
And two, OLED Switch.

06:41.960 --> 06:46.200
I have one of those crappy Switch minis because my kid has the good Switch.

06:46.200 --> 06:49.680
And I don't know about you, but my old man vision on that little crappy screen.

06:49.680 --> 06:50.840
Yeah, screen's no good.

06:50.840 --> 06:53.040
It's not what's up, especially for Breath of the Wild.

06:53.040 --> 06:54.040
Yeah.

06:54.040 --> 06:57.320
Like I'm at the stupid temple with that, I don't know, octopus water dude, he's kicking

06:57.320 --> 06:58.320
my ass.

06:58.320 --> 06:59.320
Uh-huh.

06:59.320 --> 07:00.680
Anyway, we're off the track here, but.

07:00.680 --> 07:01.680
Good game.

07:01.680 --> 07:03.720
The situation will improve with time.

07:03.720 --> 07:04.800
No doubt about it.

07:04.800 --> 07:10.720
As more M1s sell or M1 Pros and Maxes and as the Steam Deck comes out and more and more

07:10.720 --> 07:15.680
development shops target Proton, the situation will improve.

07:15.680 --> 07:17.720
But it does kind of stink still right now.

07:17.720 --> 07:23.920
I've attempted to make the situation a little better by subscribing to GeForce Now game

07:23.920 --> 07:24.920
streaming.

07:24.920 --> 07:26.220
It's a choice.

07:26.220 --> 07:32.660
My thought was instead of buying GPUs, I'll just subscribe to GeForce Now and they have

07:32.660 --> 07:35.080
like RTX and they have 3080s, right?

07:35.080 --> 07:36.080
It's Nvidia.

07:36.080 --> 07:38.560
So they've got all the hardware.

07:38.560 --> 07:40.360
You just run it on their systems.

07:40.360 --> 07:45.580
And for the games that they support, it's pretty nice and it will connect to your Steam

07:45.580 --> 07:49.000
library and your Epic accounts and it'll sync.

07:49.000 --> 07:53.200
And so if you've bought something in Steam and they have the streaming rights to it,

07:53.200 --> 07:54.800
you can play it through GeForce Now.

07:54.800 --> 07:57.960
You don't have to like buy it again like you might with Stadia.

07:57.960 --> 08:03.040
But the crux of the issue is most of the games I want to play right now, they don't have

08:03.040 --> 08:04.440
streaming rights to.

08:04.440 --> 08:07.960
So even though I own the game in Steam and I have a GeForce Now streaming account and

08:07.960 --> 08:11.440
now I have Starlink so I can actually play games at home, I can't actually play the games

08:11.440 --> 08:16.900
I want to play because those development shops don't want to license the streaming rights.

08:16.900 --> 08:21.520
The fact that Microsoft Studios makes Age of Empires and it's not on the thing I just

08:21.520 --> 08:27.040
subscribed to thinking I could stream it in Chrome on my fancy ass Mac, yeah.

08:27.040 --> 08:30.280
It's part of the service, but you can't stream it to be super clear.

08:30.280 --> 08:34.080
You have to download the XE.

08:34.080 --> 08:35.240
I hate that.

08:35.240 --> 08:39.120
You know the funny thing about gaming is like my neighbor recently said, my current neighbor,

08:39.120 --> 08:40.120
oh I don't game.

08:40.120 --> 08:41.120
I've never gamed.

08:41.120 --> 08:44.240
I tried Pac-Man when it first came out and I just didn't like it.

08:44.240 --> 08:45.240
It wasn't for me.

08:45.240 --> 08:46.840
Never picked up a video game afterwards.

08:46.840 --> 08:47.840
Not a gamer.

08:47.840 --> 08:48.840
Not interested.

08:48.840 --> 08:49.840
I said, oh really?

08:49.840 --> 08:51.440
So you don't ever play any mobile games?

08:51.440 --> 08:52.440
Oh, well.

08:52.440 --> 08:55.480
I love, you know, and she rattles off like two or three games that she loves.

08:55.480 --> 08:59.480
Yeah, she's like, of course everybody poops and therefore you're an Angry Birds or Jet

08:59.480 --> 09:00.480
Pack Joyride.

09:00.480 --> 09:01.480
I mean, come on.

09:01.480 --> 09:02.480
Yeah.

09:02.480 --> 09:09.120
But for me, it's like a lot of developers invest significantly in their work rig to

09:09.120 --> 09:12.320
make it powerful and fast and maybe have a big screen.

09:12.320 --> 09:16.180
And it's a lot of them actually make for really good gaming systems and I think it's a great

09:16.180 --> 09:22.320
way to burn off stress, to get your mind off things without going out and spending a bunch

09:22.320 --> 09:26.320
of money if you went out and bought dinner and went to a movie and went shopping or something.

09:26.320 --> 09:30.880
Like it's a pretty economical way to get your head right sometimes.

09:30.880 --> 09:34.720
So I don't know, I think people, you know, they shouldn't be so dismissive of it, but

09:34.720 --> 09:36.920
let's move on because there are worse things in the world.

09:36.920 --> 09:40.400
And one of the things we always talk about on the show recently, you really got to be

09:40.400 --> 09:44.640
careful if you're working on a side project that you're not using any of your employer's

09:44.640 --> 09:46.880
hardware, time, resources.

09:46.880 --> 09:51.960
We talked about that a lot, but Dane got shut down hard, even though he did everything right.

09:51.960 --> 09:57.360
He said, so I wanted to pass along, but sometimes even when you stick to your own personal hardware

09:57.360 --> 10:04.320
and time, even when you buy the new hardware just for the projects, some employers hiring

10:04.320 --> 10:10.720
contracts state that the company owns all code you produce, free time or not at all.

10:10.720 --> 10:15.400
He says, some many rather enterprise level companies state that they own all of the code

10:15.400 --> 10:21.280
you write while you're a salaried employee, regardless of the time of day or the hardware

10:21.280 --> 10:22.280
used.

10:22.280 --> 10:25.200
He says, sometimes you can talk with someone at these companies or file a request for a

10:25.200 --> 10:30.520
specific project to be excluded from the employer's reach, but it's a conversation and they could

10:30.520 --> 10:31.520
say no.

10:31.520 --> 10:35.220
I was bitten by this and I had to stop my project.

10:35.220 --> 10:39.320
These days, every side project is a public repository from the very beginning.

10:39.320 --> 10:44.560
While employers could still make claims, I at least have goodwill on my side.

10:44.560 --> 10:47.640
They can fork the repo and they'd look bad if they asked me to make it private or delete

10:47.640 --> 10:48.640
it.

10:48.640 --> 10:51.880
Of course, I suppose that's assuming people are even paying attention.

10:51.880 --> 10:54.680
I know it's kind of a downer thing to think about, but it's something people need to be

10:54.680 --> 10:57.640
really quite careful about.

10:57.640 --> 11:02.280
If you can, perhaps even have that conversation pretty early into the process of getting the

11:02.280 --> 11:03.280
job.

11:03.280 --> 11:06.440
I would like to continue to contribute to open source projects and make sure that they're

11:06.440 --> 11:07.980
comfortable with that.

11:07.980 --> 11:11.920
An equivalent thing that we have here is some of the guys that participate in the network

11:11.920 --> 11:17.360
that don't work for themselves, when they get new gigs, they'll have that conversation

11:17.360 --> 11:18.360
with their employer.

11:18.360 --> 11:23.040
Say, hey, I participate in these podcasts and they're kind of a big deal and I'm kind

11:23.040 --> 11:25.680
of a big internet celebrity, are you okay with me?

11:25.680 --> 11:27.640
I'm sure they say it just like that too.

11:27.640 --> 11:30.380
Are you okay with me continuing to do it?

11:30.380 --> 11:33.780
So everybody's on the same page and you always want to do that and try to get it documented

11:33.780 --> 11:37.840
and maybe even note it down and date that and save that.

11:37.840 --> 11:38.840
I don't know.

11:38.840 --> 11:42.280
Do you have any other like don't get your ass taken from you kind of wisdom for people

11:42.280 --> 11:43.280
to pass along?

11:43.280 --> 11:44.280
Yeah.

11:44.280 --> 11:47.840
As my reputation as a ruthless capitalist, I guess it's going to suffer now.

11:47.840 --> 11:52.320
I have never heard of you being able to screw with someone's off time project if they don't

11:52.320 --> 11:56.000
use your equipment, hardware, resources, blah, blah, blah.

11:56.000 --> 11:58.640
Nor can I imagine a case where you really want to.

11:58.640 --> 11:59.640
I get it.

11:59.640 --> 12:03.160
It's great to be able to steal someone's talent, I guess.

12:03.160 --> 12:04.160
Maybe that's too harsh.

12:04.160 --> 12:08.440
But well, first of all, I'm sure it really comes down to what made it into like whatever

12:08.440 --> 12:12.160
contract you signed when you came on board and how enforceable is that in your state?

12:12.160 --> 12:13.600
So that's always going to be a variable.

12:13.600 --> 12:14.600
Yeah.

12:14.600 --> 12:18.000
I mean, this feels like the kind of thing that maybe exists.

12:18.000 --> 12:19.000
I don't know.

12:19.000 --> 12:20.000
Not a lawyer.

12:20.000 --> 12:25.680
I don't want to delve into it too much, but I can't imagine this being like you, you know,

12:25.680 --> 12:29.520
you're on Dell's website, you're looking at an XPS workstation, it's roughly eighteen

12:29.520 --> 12:30.520
hundred dollars.

12:30.520 --> 12:32.040
That is an NVIDIA 12 gig GPU.

12:32.040 --> 12:33.040
That's not what I'm doing right now.

12:33.040 --> 12:35.400
No, of course not.

12:35.400 --> 12:37.040
And you know, you've written your own.

12:37.040 --> 12:40.560
Let's say you've written the app that's going to make you know, bring the Windows App Store

12:40.560 --> 12:42.840
to the forefront of the app stores.

12:42.840 --> 12:48.240
One I would suggest you put down the vape pen or the martini glass, whichever your drug

12:48.240 --> 12:50.400
of choice is.

12:50.400 --> 12:53.120
But how can your employer take that?

12:53.120 --> 12:57.800
And just I can say, like, I know I got a lot of crap and so did you a couple of months

12:57.800 --> 13:00.400
and a half ago, whatever it was.

13:00.400 --> 13:03.160
Even I think this is too evil.

13:03.160 --> 13:08.080
People you pay them for, however, you know, for goals and for when they the hours they

13:08.080 --> 13:10.920
work, you can't claim the rest of their life.

13:10.920 --> 13:13.880
That's that's crazy to me.

13:13.880 --> 13:15.880
Sorry, I've turned into a communist.

13:15.880 --> 13:16.880
It's over.

13:16.880 --> 13:21.520
Not only is it absolutely an overreach, but I am not surprised to learn that it's happening.

13:21.520 --> 13:26.440
I could even see some lawyer kind of corporety justification being their work may have been

13:26.440 --> 13:28.560
inspired by what they learned on the job.

13:28.560 --> 13:31.560
The skill set they learned on the job may have helped them or inspired them with the

13:31.560 --> 13:32.560
side project.

13:32.560 --> 13:34.160
So therefore, you know, blah, blah, blah.

13:34.160 --> 13:36.360
I could maybe see some sort of twisted logic like that.

13:36.360 --> 13:37.840
I'm not justifying it.

13:37.840 --> 13:40.800
Just these people are sick and twisted and they want everything.

13:40.800 --> 13:45.640
And so I could see that being why it's like we're super evil and we're totally OK with

13:45.640 --> 13:46.640
it.

13:46.640 --> 13:47.640
That's just what it sounds like to me.

13:47.640 --> 13:48.640
I'm sorry.

13:48.640 --> 13:49.640
And that's that's bad.

13:49.640 --> 13:50.640
I mean, yeah, this is a rabbit hole.

13:50.640 --> 13:51.640
Right.

13:51.640 --> 13:55.240
Because corporations have more and more power, pretty much have more power than governments

13:55.240 --> 14:00.000
in some cases, in some areas, and they will take it as far as they can.

14:00.000 --> 14:02.640
I mean, that's just always that's always how it's been.

14:02.640 --> 14:04.280
You got to have things documented.

14:04.280 --> 14:07.320
You got to be clear about things if you want to participate, if your employer does that.

14:07.320 --> 14:13.480
I mean, it's easy for me to say here, but also consider looking for another job.

14:13.480 --> 14:15.680
The market's pretty good right now.

14:15.680 --> 14:20.240
It's like, you know, you buy Bitcoin when the price drops and you hold when the price

14:20.240 --> 14:21.240
goes up.

14:21.240 --> 14:25.000
And, you know, you got to like watch the market, you know, just like you are keen with your

14:25.000 --> 14:28.100
crypto there, kid, be keen with the job market, too.

14:28.100 --> 14:30.000
And maybe I'm not saying Dan should move on.

14:30.000 --> 14:34.280
I'm sure he's very happy where he's at, but it is always something you should consider.

14:34.280 --> 14:38.080
We got a couple of like tips and app recommendations and stuff.

14:38.080 --> 14:43.040
Larry wrote in for visually impaired listeners, he says, I know you guys are a fan of Linux

14:43.040 --> 14:44.080
and Rust.

14:44.080 --> 14:50.400
He's a little unhappy with the state of screen readers on Linux, although I have heard that

14:50.400 --> 14:55.160
Orca on Gnome and Wayland is improving recently, he says, but it's falling behind, especially

14:55.160 --> 14:58.760
the stuff that you have on like Windows and Mac.

14:58.760 --> 15:02.960
But there's a project that he'd like to bring to our attention and I don't really know how

15:02.960 --> 15:09.520
to pronounce this one because it is spelled Y-G-G-D-R-A-S-I-L.

15:09.520 --> 15:11.240
I thought we talked about this in Slack.

15:11.240 --> 15:13.280
We are not reading from the Necronomicon.

15:13.280 --> 15:14.280
I know, right?

15:14.280 --> 15:15.720
On the air anymore.

15:15.720 --> 15:16.960
Remember what happened last time?

15:16.960 --> 15:18.040
My bad.

15:18.040 --> 15:20.240
But we'll make you feel better that it's written in Rust.

15:20.240 --> 15:24.960
I like my summoning the old ones to be memory safe, I do.

15:24.960 --> 15:25.960
Exactly.

15:25.960 --> 15:27.840
I will put a link to that in the show notes.

15:27.840 --> 15:28.840
Just like the new Pop!

15:28.840 --> 15:29.840
The West desktop environment.

15:29.840 --> 15:30.840
Boom, I got it in there.

15:30.840 --> 15:31.840
Oh, you did.

15:31.840 --> 15:32.840
Oh, wow.

15:32.840 --> 15:35.480
I thought we'd get through the whole episode and not bring it up.

15:35.480 --> 15:36.480
You think it's real?

15:36.480 --> 15:37.960
It is real, isn't it?

15:37.960 --> 15:38.960
It's real.

15:38.960 --> 15:44.040
I sent a whole list of questions off to Carl, but as of this morning, because this is Monday

15:44.040 --> 15:46.080
morning, he hasn't gotten back to me.

15:46.080 --> 15:47.480
And he's probably not going to.

15:47.480 --> 15:49.760
I kind of knew it was going to go this way, to be honest with you.

15:49.760 --> 15:55.680
In my Linux Unplugged predictions episode, I predicted they'd at least fork Gnome because

15:55.680 --> 15:58.800
they're building on top of it quite a bit and then the base changes out underneath them

15:58.800 --> 16:02.040
and then they have to rewrite everything and then they end up spending all their time doing

16:02.040 --> 16:03.400
that.

16:03.400 --> 16:08.600
But from scratch, written in Rust, I honestly could see it.

16:08.600 --> 16:12.720
You know, so I think the knee-jerk reaction to that story is, oh great, another desktop

16:12.720 --> 16:13.720
environment for Linux.

16:13.720 --> 16:17.320
I gotta say, the Hacker News comments were rough.

16:17.320 --> 16:22.020
You know, System76 sits in a very unique position that other free software desktop environments

16:22.020 --> 16:23.020
don't have.

16:23.020 --> 16:27.180
They have an extremely tight feedback loop with the people that they're selling hardware

16:27.180 --> 16:33.160
to that runs these environments and then they're providing ongoing support.

16:33.160 --> 16:36.880
So they have a real unique insight into how it's working for people, what works, what

16:36.880 --> 16:37.880
doesn't work.

16:37.880 --> 16:42.520
They have a much tighter feedback loop with actual customers that are paying for a product

16:42.520 --> 16:47.200
and using the thing they're creating than just about anybody does except for Apple and

16:47.200 --> 16:50.720
maybe Microsoft with the Surface and all the metrics they have in Windows.

16:50.720 --> 16:55.520
But like on the Linux side, I don't really think any other free desktop environment has

16:55.520 --> 16:59.280
that tight of a feedback loop with their end users.

16:59.280 --> 17:05.440
Really that kind of puts somebody in the perfect position to learn what isn't working and iterate

17:05.440 --> 17:06.440
quickly.

17:06.440 --> 17:10.760
I mean, I don't know, I could see something that's a desktop environment that's Rust based,

17:10.760 --> 17:17.280
maybe it sits on top of Mudder and has a bunch of GTK user land applications, essentially

17:17.280 --> 17:19.640
a modern Maté, perhaps.

17:19.640 --> 17:23.080
Oh, a modern Maté.

17:23.080 --> 17:25.480
Why you gotta slap them with your backhand like that?

17:25.480 --> 17:26.760
No, Maté is great.

17:26.760 --> 17:31.600
It's just, it's old school, you know, or a modern, or retake on Budgie desktop or, you

17:31.600 --> 17:32.600
know, whatever.

17:32.600 --> 17:34.120
I just want to throw it out there.

17:34.120 --> 17:37.900
Make Linux brown again.

17:37.900 --> 17:38.900
Bring it back.

17:38.900 --> 17:41.320
Now, there was some with the canonical guys.

17:41.320 --> 17:45.840
If you really want to do it, if you're going to have that fight, steal their old branding,

17:45.840 --> 17:50.680
brown to the core menu, brown taskbar, brown, right?

17:50.680 --> 17:54.220
There is aspects of this that remind me of when canonical just went, ah, screw it.

17:54.220 --> 17:55.220
We're doing Unity.

17:55.220 --> 17:56.220
We can't stand this.

17:56.220 --> 17:59.920
I think we're going to be covering this for three years.

17:59.920 --> 18:03.640
Well, the one thing that'll be interesting to see is if they can make a nice power user

18:03.640 --> 18:04.640
desktop.

18:04.640 --> 18:08.400
Like the thing I think they kind of proved out with Pop OS is they're pretty good at

18:08.400 --> 18:13.720
like sizing up a target audience and then building features for that target audience.

18:13.720 --> 18:18.200
And I could see them continuing to just sort of execute on that, like the key bindings

18:18.200 --> 18:23.160
for all the window management, the tiling, that kind of stuff, the performance modes.

18:23.160 --> 18:26.440
That's all stuff that they've added that kind of makes the Ubuntu desktop a little more

18:26.440 --> 18:29.000
out of the box power user friendly.

18:29.000 --> 18:33.200
Well, moving right along, like you said earlier, we do have some Python on Windows love here

18:33.200 --> 18:36.680
and maybe this will be useful for anyone else out there that's thinking about setting this

18:36.680 --> 18:37.680
up.

18:37.680 --> 18:41.400
Listener Chris P writes in and he created a guide that I thought was pretty dang good.

18:41.400 --> 18:42.520
So we wanted to give it a shout out.

18:42.520 --> 18:46.160
He says, I know you've had a few folks right in looking for help getting started with Python

18:46.160 --> 18:47.160
on Windows.

18:47.160 --> 18:51.480
I've seen a bunch of confusion swirling around of late with folks recommending various things,

18:51.480 --> 18:55.920
including WSL as a cure all, which it isn't.

18:55.920 --> 19:00.960
I mean, it is awesome, he says, but it's probably not the best way for a newbie to start coding

19:00.960 --> 19:02.040
in Python.

19:02.040 --> 19:04.720
So I wrote a blog post that I thought might help.

19:04.720 --> 19:08.680
Now we don't always feature these, so you don't have to spam us with your blog posts.

19:08.680 --> 19:11.760
But I thought that Listener Chris here did a great job.

19:11.760 --> 19:16.600
So I wanted to toss a link in the show notes because it's just recently been updated.

19:16.600 --> 19:21.560
So if you're looking for something that is current as of November 6, 2021 on getting

19:21.560 --> 19:24.880
started with Python on Windows, well, he's got it for you.

19:24.880 --> 19:27.700
And I will drop a link to this in the chat room if you're listening live and I'll put

19:27.700 --> 19:32.000
a link to it in the show notes for those of you listening after the fact, which is 99

19:32.000 --> 19:34.360
point nine eight percent of you.

19:34.360 --> 19:38.400
And I don't know, I just think that's kind of a kind of a nice little resource there.

19:38.400 --> 19:40.160
I don't suppose I have any comments on it.

19:40.160 --> 19:42.040
Yeah, no, I think that's great.

19:42.040 --> 19:46.560
If you're if you're living in Windows land or you're thinking of, let's say, your Windows

19:46.560 --> 19:51.400
curious, this is the I mean, this is a great resource, you know, and not even being a big

19:51.400 --> 19:52.400
Windows user anymore.

19:52.400 --> 19:55.920
I know enough that I could follow that and I think I could get it set up so that passes

19:55.920 --> 19:56.920
the bar.

19:56.920 --> 20:02.560
And then last but not least, continue to trend of recommendations from the audience.

20:02.560 --> 20:06.880
PowerShell on Linux DM recommended something that I think is pretty killer.

20:06.880 --> 20:13.520
So last week, I kind of just got really excited about Bumper, which is an app for the Mac.

20:13.520 --> 20:18.000
It replaces whatever you might have as your default browser as your default browser.

20:18.000 --> 20:24.140
So you set Bumper as your default browser on the Mac and then whenever you click a hyperlink

20:24.140 --> 20:30.680
anywhere in the OS, instead of launching a browser, it launches a super lightweight,

20:30.680 --> 20:35.500
very quick icon menu with icons of each browser you have.

20:35.500 --> 20:41.280
You select that icon, say Chrome, and then Bumper launches Chrome and sends Chrome the

20:41.280 --> 20:44.780
link and opens the page in Chrome or whatever browser you choose.

20:44.780 --> 20:48.560
And this is a great way for those of us that live the multi browser lifestyle to be really

20:48.560 --> 20:51.200
intentional about what browsers open what links.

20:51.200 --> 20:52.800
I love this.

20:52.800 --> 20:56.960
I would love for somebody to make this for Linux, I very much would love to have it.

20:56.960 --> 21:00.440
Well, DM says, hey, you can thank me later.

21:00.440 --> 21:03.120
They have this for Android, so we'll put a link to this in the show notes.

21:03.120 --> 21:09.160
It's called Better Open With and it lets you choose between the default or another app

21:09.160 --> 21:12.160
you may have installed on Android for like browsers or email.

21:12.160 --> 21:16.240
And I actually really like this because I think that the line on Android is like, never

21:16.240 --> 21:21.360
ask me again or ask me every time I do a thing, which I just don't like.

21:21.360 --> 21:23.520
And so Better Open With solves that.

21:23.520 --> 21:24.920
And this is a really great little app.

21:24.920 --> 21:28.560
So I will put a link to that in the show notes.

21:28.560 --> 21:32.200
We'd love to get your emails too or your links or recommendations for great apps that make

21:32.200 --> 21:37.160
any platform better to use, Windows, Linux, Mac OS, Android, iOS, let us know what you're

21:37.160 --> 21:38.160
doing.

21:38.160 --> 21:39.980
Go to coder.show slash contact.

21:39.980 --> 21:43.820
I'll give you an example of kind of what I was thinking about, thinking about things

21:43.820 --> 21:46.560
that make us a little more productive.

21:46.560 --> 21:53.960
I really recommend you go on Amazon and you buy yourself a pack of NFC tags.

21:53.960 --> 21:54.960
Have you tried this, Mike?

21:54.960 --> 21:55.960
These NFC tags?

21:55.960 --> 21:58.340
For customers, but not personally.

21:58.340 --> 22:02.540
So either Android or iOS, but of course I have a little more experience now with iOS,

22:02.540 --> 22:05.820
you can build actions based on these tags.

22:05.820 --> 22:11.120
So for example, here in the studio, I have an NFC tag that when I touch the tip of my

22:11.120 --> 22:14.480
phone and now in the later versions of iOS, it's all automatic.

22:14.480 --> 22:16.440
There's no prompting, no interaction.

22:16.440 --> 22:23.760
I tap the tip of my phone on this NFC tag and it changes my focus mode to recording

22:23.760 --> 22:27.420
and that does a whole bunch of stuff on the back end, even turns on lights in the studio

22:27.420 --> 22:28.560
and everything.

22:28.560 --> 22:32.080
And then when I leave, I have another NFC tag that I can tap and it turns that focus

22:32.080 --> 22:33.660
mode off.

22:33.660 --> 22:36.760
And I have something at night when I'm going to bed and because my phone charger is near

22:36.760 --> 22:41.840
the bed, I tap that NFC tag and it starts turning off the lights and you can do this

22:41.840 --> 22:46.760
with shortcuts on iOS using the automations tab or you can do it with things like Home

22:46.760 --> 22:47.760
Assistant.

22:47.760 --> 22:49.040
There's a few options out there.

22:49.040 --> 22:52.140
It's one of these little things that you can put these tags next to your charger or on

22:52.140 --> 22:58.840
your desk where if say your phone starts buzzing, you could have a do not disturb tag that you

22:58.840 --> 23:03.720
just pick your phone up, you tap this tag with it and now your device is no longer buzzing

23:03.720 --> 23:04.720
at you.

23:04.720 --> 23:07.740
You don't have to sit there and fiddle with unlocking it and pulling down a menu and anything

23:07.740 --> 23:08.880
like that.

23:08.880 --> 23:12.720
It's really kind of nice and it just moves things out a little bit.

23:12.720 --> 23:14.320
So that's a tip for you right there.

23:14.320 --> 23:15.640
Go get yourself some NFC tags.

23:15.640 --> 23:16.640
They're super cheap.

23:16.640 --> 23:17.640
They have nice ones.

23:17.640 --> 23:18.640
They have cheap ones.

23:18.640 --> 23:19.640
They all do the same.

23:19.640 --> 23:23.320
And if you have any other recommendations for software productivity or little tweaks

23:23.320 --> 23:25.840
to your work environment, I'd like to collect those.

23:25.840 --> 23:31.200
So go to coder.show slash contact and send them in.

23:31.200 --> 23:32.680
lino.com slash coder.

23:32.680 --> 23:36.800
Go there to get $100 in 60 day credit on a new account and you go there to support the

23:36.800 --> 23:37.800
show.

23:37.800 --> 23:38.800
Lock that into your memory banks.

23:38.800 --> 23:41.280
Go to lino.com slash coder.

23:41.280 --> 23:44.840
Then when you need to host something in the cloud, not only can you use the best provider

23:44.840 --> 23:47.120
to do it, but you can support the show.

23:47.120 --> 23:50.740
You know, Linode is our hosting provider for everything since we've gone independent.

23:50.740 --> 23:55.040
Every service, anything that faces the audience that we've built, anything that our team uses

23:55.040 --> 23:59.140
to collaborate, we've deployed it all on Linode.

23:59.140 --> 24:00.600
And there's a lot of reasons for that.

24:00.600 --> 24:04.640
First of all, the infrastructure is super solid, like we just don't have downtime.

24:04.640 --> 24:06.280
There's awesome performance.

24:06.280 --> 24:08.840
That is maybe number one for me.

24:08.840 --> 24:13.200
And I really have appreciated as time has gone on how we just focus on the project or

24:13.200 --> 24:18.460
the service we're trying to stand up and not on all the little details of infrastructure.

24:18.460 --> 24:19.800
That's what Linode nails.

24:19.800 --> 24:24.040
You get 11 data centers to choose from and every service level is backed by the best

24:24.040 --> 24:26.880
support in the business.

24:26.880 --> 24:31.480
And man, when that matters, it makes all the difference.

24:31.480 --> 24:35.280
You know, Linode has been focused on being the best at running things on Linux in the

24:35.280 --> 24:37.600
cloud since 2003.

24:37.600 --> 24:42.880
They've been at this for 18 years and they're independently funded and they got into it

24:42.880 --> 24:44.880
because of a passion for the technology.

24:44.880 --> 24:49.060
And you know, I can really relate with that and I suspect I don't have to tell you guys

24:49.060 --> 24:53.520
out there that it makes a difference when a company is actually passionate about the

24:53.520 --> 24:54.520
product they make.

24:54.520 --> 24:58.800
You know, it's not just a group of bean counters that got together and figured out how they

24:58.800 --> 25:03.000
could make a bunch of money in cloud and then launched a product that's backed by a bunch

25:03.000 --> 25:04.000
of VCs.

25:04.000 --> 25:11.120
They started because, well, they're geeks and they really liked this stuff and I think

25:11.120 --> 25:16.080
long term that gets baked into every decision a company makes.

25:16.080 --> 25:20.080
It's how they view the world, it's how they think about their product and when you zoom

25:20.080 --> 25:26.700
out over 18 years, all those little decisions add up and it makes something truly unique.

25:26.700 --> 25:28.140
So go try it out for yourself.

25:28.140 --> 25:33.040
That $100 means you actually can try it and go see what I've been talking about and support

25:33.040 --> 25:34.040
the show.

25:34.040 --> 25:35.040
Linode.com.

25:35.040 --> 25:43.520
I don't want to spend too much time on this, but all of the Apple press, there's so many

25:43.520 --> 25:48.560
podcasts, so many websites and blogs and full time professionals, all they do is talk about

25:48.560 --> 25:57.860
Apple and they're not talking about this horrendously cringy speech that Craig Federighi, everybody

25:57.860 --> 26:01.120
loves Craig Federighi in the Mac community, in the Apple community.

26:01.120 --> 26:08.800
He went out, did a talk about how bad sideloading is and I think because it was on LinkedIn,

26:08.800 --> 26:16.000
nobody really bothered to watch it, but I did and it's really, really rough.

26:16.000 --> 26:23.440
Essentially what's going on is Apple is taking issue with a new law that's in the works across

26:23.440 --> 26:24.640
the pond.

26:24.640 --> 26:30.320
It's called the Digital Markets Act and the Digital Markets Act requires the ability for

26:30.320 --> 26:36.120
phones to have sideloading apps and Craig, you don't like that too much.

26:36.120 --> 26:44.920
But today there is one provision of the DMA that I think deserves a little more consideration.

26:44.920 --> 26:49.700
Specifically I want to talk today about sideloading and why requiring it on iPhone would be a

26:49.700 --> 26:53.920
step backwards in our privacy and security journey.

26:53.920 --> 26:59.320
He then takes 10 minutes to make a really tortured analogy about the security of a house

26:59.320 --> 27:05.560
and allowing burglars to just come in and he says, we don't need this, these new provisions,

27:05.560 --> 27:07.800
we don't need it because Apple's been getting it right.

27:07.800 --> 27:10.720
Look how good we've been that proves we don't need sideloading.

27:10.720 --> 27:15.860
Long story short, iPhone security approach has worked, but you don't have to take my

27:15.860 --> 27:23.160
word for it because the security community regularly says things like this, quote, Apple's

27:23.160 --> 27:28.820
iOS devices are the most secure consumer hardware ever made.

27:28.820 --> 27:33.400
But let's look at some numbers because when we compare iOS to other platforms, a clear

27:33.400 --> 27:35.840
story emerges.

27:35.840 --> 27:41.600
Here's a graph showing third party data on malware infections by platform and you can

27:41.600 --> 27:45.040
see iPhone barely registers.

27:45.040 --> 27:49.680
But the level of attacks on other platforms is a different story.

27:49.680 --> 27:55.340
One security firm found more than 5 million attacks per month on its clients using another

27:55.340 --> 28:00.760
mobile platform, but there's never been this kind of widespread consumer malware attack

28:00.760 --> 28:04.600
on iOS, never.

28:04.600 --> 28:05.600
So what's the difference?

28:05.600 --> 28:14.440
Well, the single biggest reason is that other platforms allow sideloading, done, done, done.

28:14.440 --> 28:22.800
Yeah, sideloading is so dangerous because you see, even if it's off by default, people

28:22.800 --> 28:28.600
could be socially engineered into turning it on and that essentially makes us all vulnerable.

28:28.600 --> 28:32.760
And so he kind of brings it home back to this tortured house analogy he's been making the

28:32.760 --> 28:36.220
entire time and really makes the pitch.

28:36.220 --> 28:38.880
So now let's return back to our favorite house.

28:38.880 --> 28:41.040
As you remember, you made a choice.

28:41.040 --> 28:45.240
You wanted to protect your family, so you bought a really safe home with a really great

28:45.240 --> 28:50.800
security system and you're really glad you did because since you first moved in, the

28:50.800 --> 28:57.480
burglars have never been more creative or more plentiful and in the real world of cybersecurity,

28:57.480 --> 28:59.720
this couldn't be more true.

28:59.720 --> 29:04.920
Attackers are virtually dressing up as mailmen, building tunnels underground and trying to

29:04.920 --> 29:08.480
scale your backyard walls with grappling hooks.

29:08.480 --> 29:13.120
In this world, some of your neighbors are suffering repeated break-ins, but the home

29:13.120 --> 29:17.320
you have has kept you safe.

29:17.320 --> 29:23.560
But then that new law gets passed and in the noble pursuit of say more optimized package

29:23.560 --> 29:29.080
delivery, your town requires everyone to build an always unlocked side door on the ground

29:29.080 --> 29:30.860
floor of their homes.

29:30.860 --> 29:36.140
Now some of your neighbors, they love this idea, but you're not so sure because you know

29:36.140 --> 29:40.280
that once the side door is built, anyone can walk through it.

29:40.280 --> 29:46.680
The safe house that you chose now has a fatal flaw in its security system and burglars are

29:46.680 --> 29:49.880
really good at exploiting it.

29:49.880 --> 29:54.680
In a nutshell, sideloading is that unlocked side door.

29:54.680 --> 29:55.980
So there you go.

29:55.980 --> 30:00.040
That's Apple's position and they are doubling down so hard on this.

30:00.040 --> 30:02.760
That is not Apple's real position.

30:02.760 --> 30:06.880
So if you want the good app store coverage, you got to read the financial press like a

30:06.880 --> 30:12.560
market watch or Bloomberg because one of my favorite opinion pieces has been how much

30:12.560 --> 30:15.480
does Apple make on the app store?

30:15.480 --> 30:21.520
They're basically just quoting the epic lawyers and financial analyst, just mocking Tim Phil

30:21.520 --> 30:25.760
Schiller on the stand being like, I don't know if it's profitable.

30:25.760 --> 30:29.860
Well couldn't you infer that 30% of whatever number you admitted to as the revenue would

30:29.860 --> 30:30.860
be $20 billion.

30:30.860 --> 30:33.480
So you're saying 20 billion is not a profit.

30:33.480 --> 30:38.080
I don't know, pulling teeth they had to admit that the section of their business, which

30:38.080 --> 30:43.960
includes the app store is 70.1% profitable, but they refuse and they say not only do they

30:43.960 --> 30:50.720
refuse, they say they simply do not have the accounting controls in the company to know

30:50.720 --> 30:53.220
which percentage of that is in the app store.

30:53.220 --> 30:54.380
Can't be known.

30:54.380 --> 30:55.380
Can't be tracked.

30:55.380 --> 30:59.160
It can't be known because you don't want to know, because if there's any record from

30:59.160 --> 31:05.440
PricewaterhouseCoop or whoever their big five or big three accounting firm now is, that's

31:05.440 --> 31:07.360
like subpoenable, right?

31:07.360 --> 31:08.700
You don't want to know.

31:08.700 --> 31:09.700
It's laughable.

31:09.700 --> 31:15.120
Protecting a house, a very big house in Palo Alto with lots of shiny things.

31:15.120 --> 31:16.200
How cringe is it?

31:16.200 --> 31:17.440
How cringe is that?

31:17.440 --> 31:18.480
It's cringe.

31:18.480 --> 31:20.880
It's also cringe because it's like a web developer conference.

31:20.880 --> 31:21.880
Yeah.

31:21.880 --> 31:22.880
And he's the last one.

31:22.880 --> 31:24.960
And it's the whole way it's set up is super cringe.

31:24.960 --> 31:29.000
Like the audience at first doesn't really know to clap because the way it's set up sounds

31:29.000 --> 31:30.000
bad.

31:30.000 --> 31:31.700
It's 15 minutes of that.

31:31.700 --> 31:33.920
It's 15 minutes of that.

31:33.920 --> 31:39.240
And while I completely 100% agree with your take, their public position is going to be

31:39.240 --> 31:44.080
what Craig just said, and Craig's going to go on all of these different Apple friendly

31:44.080 --> 31:48.320
outlets and he's going to very earnestly say it's all about protecting.

31:48.320 --> 31:54.520
And their core argument, what it really boils down to is in the name of choice, you're going

31:54.520 --> 31:59.680
to strip away people's security and we offer choice, the choice to be secure.

31:59.680 --> 32:02.660
If you don't want that, go get an Android phone.

32:02.660 --> 32:06.760
So they claim that it's kind of like this reverse argument that in the name of choice,

32:06.760 --> 32:10.080
you're actually taking away choice because you're removing the choice for people to choose

32:10.080 --> 32:13.560
iOS as a platform designed the way they have it today.

32:13.560 --> 32:16.480
It's interesting that he picks side loaning because I think there is like an actual security

32:16.480 --> 32:18.120
argument there.

32:18.120 --> 32:22.240
But what he fails to mention in that whole cringe worthy LinkedIn speech at this web

32:22.240 --> 32:26.960
conference is like third party payment providers.

32:26.960 --> 32:31.000
Like the one that Stripe is making, I believe it's Stripe, maybe it's PayPal.

32:31.000 --> 32:37.420
One of them is making one for iOS that would avoid that 30% tax.

32:37.420 --> 32:41.460
This is where you can tell that their entire argument is basically bull right?

32:41.460 --> 32:44.460
Because they're trying to protect the 30% fee.

32:44.460 --> 32:49.680
You know what it is, it's because of this digital markets act and this digital markets

32:49.680 --> 32:53.400
act is going to enforce the ability to sideload on these platforms.

32:53.400 --> 32:55.980
So that's why they're hitting this so hard.

32:55.980 --> 33:00.160
See sideloading is great I think for them because it's hard.

33:00.160 --> 33:04.760
The thing I think that would be the real boon or rather the thing that would damage them

33:04.760 --> 33:10.760
is that they can't enforce using their AIP system and when I say can't enforce I mean

33:10.760 --> 33:13.460
you can't even say it must be an option.

33:13.460 --> 33:15.600
That would screw them over.

33:15.600 --> 33:19.280
When I listen to this whole thing all I learned is okay they see their future as a middleman

33:19.280 --> 33:23.760
for services and that's just too big a pie to give up.

33:23.760 --> 33:28.680
So you know in South Korea there was a judgment that came down that said Apple and Google

33:28.680 --> 33:34.800
must allow third-party payment systems and Google has responded and they've updated it

33:34.800 --> 33:38.080
now and you can use a third-party payment.

33:38.080 --> 33:41.040
You still publish your app to the Play Store.

33:41.040 --> 33:45.440
You put in your API information for the payment system and it comes up on what looks like

33:45.440 --> 33:50.840
a built-in Android payment screen like it looks completely legit but it's using the

33:50.840 --> 33:55.980
payment provider you choose and I don't know if I have the numbers right but Google is

33:55.980 --> 34:01.100
then putting like an 11% transaction charge on top of that so even though you're not going

34:01.100 --> 34:06.080
through their payment system they're still charging like a like a 10% or something like

34:06.080 --> 34:11.720
that cut to sell an app on Android if you go outside their system.

34:11.720 --> 34:15.760
Yeah because this is about money and being a middleman is one of the best businesses

34:15.760 --> 34:16.760
you can be in.

34:16.760 --> 34:17.760
Right.

34:17.760 --> 34:19.920
That's exactly it yeah.

34:19.920 --> 34:23.980
I just say prepare yourselves because I think Apple's gonna fight this one for the reasons

34:23.980 --> 34:29.680
you just said but saying the things that Craig just said like that's something that they

34:29.680 --> 34:34.080
have been working on for a while and Craig hit it as hard as he could he gave it the

34:34.080 --> 34:37.700
hardest sell he could and that's why when you watch it I do have a link in the show

34:37.700 --> 34:41.760
notes when you watch it it's even cringier when you see him sometimes.

34:41.760 --> 34:45.440
It's kind of unfortunate because I have to say I had a pretty good opinion of Craig Federighi

34:45.440 --> 34:50.200
before this and this really just shows he's a really good corporate actor.

34:50.200 --> 34:54.360
I mean I know he's also good you know apparently boss and technician all that kind of stuff

34:54.360 --> 34:58.440
but you watch that video and tell me he's not out there selling.

34:58.440 --> 34:59.440
It's really something.

34:59.440 --> 35:02.620
Well I mean they follow their incentives right like any other corporate executives.

35:02.620 --> 35:04.040
I don't know.

35:04.040 --> 35:09.320
They can't go tell Wall Street that they're not going to collect this fee.

35:09.320 --> 35:12.080
Maybe I'm too essentialist about it but.

35:12.080 --> 35:15.380
Well let's put on our and is it and rind or is it rind?

35:15.380 --> 35:16.380
And rant yeah.

35:16.380 --> 35:21.280
Here put on your capitals hat for a second like they've built this platform.

35:21.280 --> 35:26.720
You know they created this platform and now they have to keep the platform competitive

35:26.720 --> 35:31.560
and they have to keep investing in it like they have to make this money because you know

35:31.560 --> 35:33.240
that's how they're going to make money on the platform going forward.

35:33.240 --> 35:35.680
Now they've sold the hardware and they still have costs.

35:35.680 --> 35:37.200
I mean I don't I don't know.

35:37.200 --> 35:40.720
I could see actually the way Google is doing it in South Korea.

35:40.720 --> 35:43.400
I could see that being reasonable if it was like three percent.

35:43.400 --> 35:47.560
Yeah this will be in court for five years.

35:47.560 --> 35:49.320
Shortcut dot com slash coder.

35:49.320 --> 35:53.240
Have you ever really been happy with your project management tool?

35:53.240 --> 35:58.640
I mean most are either just too simple for a growing team or they're way too complex

35:58.640 --> 36:00.420
for anyone to actually want to use them.

36:00.420 --> 36:04.560
So someone has to constantly prod everyone to use the tool.

36:04.560 --> 36:07.040
Shortcut formerly known as clubhouse.

36:07.040 --> 36:08.080
They're different though.

36:08.080 --> 36:09.440
They're different because they're worse.

36:09.440 --> 36:10.440
Wait oh wait.

36:10.440 --> 36:11.440
No.

36:11.440 --> 36:12.440
No actually no.

36:12.440 --> 36:13.440
No really.

36:13.440 --> 36:14.440
It's quite better.

36:14.440 --> 36:18.400
Shortcut is project management built specifically for software teams and they're fast.

36:18.400 --> 36:19.400
It's intuitive.

36:19.400 --> 36:20.400
It's flexible.

36:20.400 --> 36:23.280
It's powerful and a lot of really nice positive adjectives that they've earned.

36:23.280 --> 36:24.280
Trust me.

36:24.280 --> 36:27.920
But let's look at some of their highlights so you can see what I'm talking about.

36:27.920 --> 36:29.840
Shortcuts got team based workflows.

36:29.840 --> 36:33.320
Individual teams can use shortcuts default workflows or customize them to match the way

36:33.320 --> 36:34.320
they work.

36:34.320 --> 36:38.480
They have organizational wide goals and roadmaps.

36:38.480 --> 36:42.060
You can work in these workflows and see how they're automatically tied to larger company

36:42.060 --> 36:43.060
goals.

36:43.060 --> 36:48.260
And it just takes one click to move from a roadmap to a team's work or even individual

36:48.260 --> 36:50.760
updates and vice versa.

36:50.760 --> 36:55.480
And has tight VCS integrations so if you use GitHub or GitLab or Bitbucket, Shortcut ties

36:55.480 --> 36:59.800
directly to those so you can update progress from the command line.

36:59.800 --> 37:03.760
And speaking of keyboard friendly interfaces well Shortcut sets the bar.

37:03.760 --> 37:07.840
In fact they have a power bar allowing you to do just virtually anything without touching

37:07.840 --> 37:08.840
your mouse.

37:08.840 --> 37:10.840
You can throw that thing in the trash.

37:10.840 --> 37:14.120
Oh and iterations planning.

37:14.120 --> 37:18.760
Set weekly priorities and then let Shortcut run the schedule for you with accompanying

37:18.760 --> 37:21.120
burn down charts and other reporting.

37:21.120 --> 37:23.520
So go give it a try and support the show.

37:23.520 --> 37:25.480
Shortcut.com slash coder.

37:25.480 --> 37:28.520
Again Shortcut.com slash coder.

37:28.520 --> 37:32.680
Shortcut formerly known as Clubhouse because you shouldn't have to project manage your

37:32.680 --> 37:34.120
project management.

37:34.120 --> 37:38.000
Shortcut.com slash coder.

37:38.000 --> 37:39.000
So now let's talk about.NET.

37:39.000 --> 37:40.960
I think you're going to like this a lot more.

37:40.960 --> 37:47.200
.NET 6 is out and I'm not even really in the.NET community and I'm pretty impressed by

37:47.200 --> 37:48.200
this release.

37:48.200 --> 37:49.200
Yeah.

37:49.200 --> 37:50.760
I mean there you know there's a lot going on here.

37:50.760 --> 37:54.960
There was a whole controversy about the live reload thing in VS Code.

37:54.960 --> 37:57.960
I think that's been covered to death and I don't think we need to cover it.

37:57.960 --> 38:02.720
But once again you know bottom line business incentives sometimes interfere with people's

38:02.720 --> 38:05.320
other goals.

38:05.320 --> 38:06.440
Hot Reload did make it though.

38:06.440 --> 38:07.440
It is in.

38:07.440 --> 38:10.960
It did make it and it was kind of a messy way it made it.

38:10.960 --> 38:18.400
Yeah so it's you know.NET 6 it's a lot of quality of life improvements for you you honorable

38:18.400 --> 38:21.960
C sharp developers working in the enterprise that will never be allowed to update it for

38:21.960 --> 38:22.960
two years.

38:22.960 --> 38:27.280
I don't there's nothing like there's the compile ahead of time stuff.

38:27.280 --> 38:31.160
I have lots of skeptical thoughts about that.

38:31.160 --> 38:35.560
And I say rightfully so they've kind of taken passes at this over the years although yeah

38:35.560 --> 38:37.440
you know now they say they've really gotten it.

38:37.440 --> 38:38.440
I think this is interesting.

38:38.440 --> 38:43.480
So ahead of time compilation it essentially gives you some performance in some areas you

38:43.480 --> 38:48.320
know reduce the startup time and things like that and the only downside is supposedly is

38:48.320 --> 38:51.240
that these different implementations have always had all these different compromises

38:51.240 --> 38:52.240
you've had to make.

38:52.240 --> 38:55.240
So I don't know anything about this but I was reading through on Twitter and it seems

38:55.240 --> 38:59.400
like there's several people that have been using this like several well-known developers

38:59.400 --> 39:03.240
that have been using this in their environments for months now already.

39:03.240 --> 39:09.480
In fact that theme is in several of the major features throughout.NET 6.

39:09.480 --> 39:12.720
Microsoft in their release notes really stresses the fact that they've been running this in

39:12.720 --> 39:18.480
production on Azure for months now but there's also like they've clearly worked with certain

39:18.480 --> 39:23.760
developers in the.NET community and given them like kind of like hands-on time to get

39:23.760 --> 39:27.000
them to start using.NET 6 a while ago.

39:27.000 --> 39:31.440
And so they've been using it for a while and that's that is a very it's it's really interesting

39:31.440 --> 39:36.800
how all in Microsoft is here in fact I recommend everybody read through the release notes because

39:36.800 --> 39:40.360
they're in there talking about like how they're tracking Debian releases and timing the release

39:40.360 --> 39:45.300
cadence with that and there's all kinds of like really deep thought through processes

39:45.300 --> 39:50.480
that they're doing in the community and there's a shout out in there too for Apple development

39:50.480 --> 39:54.840
support team that sent them some ARM Macs like months before their main release so that

39:54.840 --> 39:59.080
way they could get working on.NET 6 compatibility for the M1.

39:59.080 --> 40:05.800
In fact the whole ARM 64 support looks really good for Linux, Windows, and the Mac.

40:05.800 --> 40:08.680
It seems like this is a release that's firing in all cylinders.

40:08.680 --> 40:14.000
Yeah I'm trying I'm trying not to throw too much cold water on it.

40:14.000 --> 40:17.520
I don't know I was reading through all these announcements and I just realized in the last

40:17.520 --> 40:22.740
let's say five years C sharp has become such an just huge language.

40:22.740 --> 40:25.260
There's so many different ways to do things.

40:25.260 --> 40:28.600
One of the features that I would normally be excited about but I'm jaded is that this

40:28.600 --> 40:31.160
.NET single binary for all platforms.

40:31.160 --> 40:33.120
Oh yeah see I thought that was great.

40:33.120 --> 40:34.120
I don't believe it.

40:34.120 --> 40:36.340
There's gonna be a lot of restrictions on that.

40:36.340 --> 40:41.080
And also like I could tell you at TMB we're doing some Maui development now.

40:41.080 --> 40:42.080
It's very new.

40:42.080 --> 40:44.520
Man that's where I was gonna go next.

40:44.520 --> 40:50.880
Yeah Xamarin Forms because it's basically becoming Maui in some weird way is also kind

40:50.880 --> 40:55.780
of busted now which Xamarin Forms you could argue has been busted for ever.

40:55.780 --> 41:00.400
So I don't know I feel like you know.NET is a great development environment don't get

41:00.400 --> 41:03.440
me wrong but Microsoft keeps like this is the Holy Grail.

41:03.440 --> 41:04.560
It's not just Microsoft right.

41:04.560 --> 41:07.100
It's right once run everywhere.

41:07.100 --> 41:09.040
Java's been talking about this since the 90s.

41:09.040 --> 41:10.540
Everybody's wanted this.

41:10.540 --> 41:12.040
It's hard right.

41:12.040 --> 41:13.200
It's always gonna be hard.

41:13.200 --> 41:16.520
It's the reason I can't run Age of Empires 4 on my Mac.

41:16.520 --> 41:22.500
I don't necessarily think it's gonna be as beautiful as they would have you see in their

41:22.500 --> 41:27.660
somewhat odd very produced videos they've been producing over the last week.

41:27.660 --> 41:28.660
They sure are.

41:28.660 --> 41:31.980
I was actually because I was jumping around a little bit I was like whoa what is going

41:31.980 --> 41:32.980
on here.

41:32.980 --> 41:33.980
This is pretty interesting.

41:33.980 --> 41:39.040
I mean I appreciate the effort on the production myself but you're right it is massive and

41:39.040 --> 41:43.080
it's a bit overwhelming at this point and I can't really speak to the quality of any

41:43.080 --> 41:44.480
of these things.

41:44.480 --> 41:49.040
A lot of times with Microsoft it takes them three releases to kind of get it right and

41:49.040 --> 41:53.040
then depending on the product they either go horizontal for a while and then it takes

41:53.040 --> 41:55.240
them like another three releases to really get it right.

41:55.240 --> 41:58.280
And so I don't know where we are in that phase with Microsoft because I don't have hands

41:58.280 --> 41:59.880
on experience with this stuff.

41:59.880 --> 42:04.600
Sure but like this isn't just like a Windows SDK release or like the language stuff I think

42:04.600 --> 42:05.600
is fine.

42:05.600 --> 42:10.500
Like my preference for languages to be smaller and somewhat simpler is like back to my Objective

42:10.500 --> 42:12.380
C days and whatever.

42:12.380 --> 42:17.840
Even Python I'm like Python 3.10 it's kind of getting larger I don't know.

42:17.840 --> 42:21.320
The Maui stuff is it's like the holy grail.

42:21.320 --> 42:26.540
If they actually pull it off where you don't have to think about the platform or the desktop

42:26.540 --> 42:32.200
environment then they will have solved the problem a software engineering problem that

42:32.200 --> 42:36.480
has since been up till now unsolvable.

42:36.480 --> 42:41.880
The closest actual solution has been the web browser right the DOM but the DOM comes with

42:41.880 --> 42:46.520
a lot of tradeoffs even today and you know November of 2021.

42:46.520 --> 42:51.000
I'm skeptical because the claim is so big right.

42:51.000 --> 42:58.100
And also the other big feature they're pushing in VS 2022 the kind of AI code assistant thing.

42:58.100 --> 43:00.440
I don't like GitHub pilot.

43:00.440 --> 43:03.040
I don't want that built into my editor.

43:03.040 --> 43:08.240
I have lots of concerns about potential license violations if they regurgitate GPL code.

43:08.240 --> 43:13.560
It's just not the kind of thing I would rather just better IntelliSense via you know semantic

43:13.560 --> 43:18.520
just like the normal semantic crap that all these code completion things have been using

43:18.520 --> 43:23.080
forever not AI scanning open GitHub repos.

43:23.080 --> 43:24.080
That's my soapbox.

43:24.080 --> 43:25.760
I know people are excited about it.

43:25.760 --> 43:26.760
I follow you.

43:26.760 --> 43:30.000
Let me see if I can wow you about Maui though just for a second.

43:30.000 --> 43:31.000
Sure.

43:31.000 --> 43:34.680
Because I guess what I would do is I would try to present to you that perhaps the table

43:34.680 --> 43:39.760
is set differently now than all the promises since Java.

43:39.760 --> 43:45.440
Because if you think about the scope of what Maui is promising when you just think about

43:45.440 --> 43:51.120
how big of a job that is it almost seems impossible on its own right.

43:51.120 --> 43:55.880
But if there was any company that would just stick with it for a while and throw tons of

43:55.880 --> 44:01.040
resources at it and take on a crazy thing like that it would be Microsoft like Sun was

44:01.040 --> 44:03.160
never Sun was never in that position.

44:03.160 --> 44:04.160
No it wouldn't.

44:04.160 --> 44:05.160
Wait wait wait wait wait.

44:05.160 --> 44:08.800
They've owned Xamarin for how long now and Xamarin forms is still a wreck.

44:08.800 --> 44:09.800
I'm sorry.

44:09.800 --> 44:10.800
Right.

44:10.800 --> 44:11.800
No I know.

44:11.800 --> 44:12.800
I know.

44:12.800 --> 44:13.800
But here's the thing.

44:13.800 --> 44:14.800
Here's the thing.

44:14.800 --> 44:15.800
This time it's different.

44:15.800 --> 44:19.480
I think and of course this is the Linux hippie in me but this time it's different.

44:19.480 --> 44:20.480
It's open source.

44:20.480 --> 44:26.480
So even if Microsoft say Microsoft plows away at this for another five years and says you

44:26.480 --> 44:32.880
know what everything through edge now WebAssembly Microsoft active WebAssembly we're done with

44:32.880 --> 44:33.880
all this right.

44:33.880 --> 44:34.880
It's just crazy.

44:34.880 --> 44:35.880
It's open source.

44:35.880 --> 44:39.280
There's so much community momentum now that they'll never let it go.

44:39.280 --> 44:41.280
So it will never stop at this point.

44:41.280 --> 44:43.880
Maui is going to outlive you and I.

44:43.880 --> 44:44.880
Yeah.

44:44.880 --> 44:45.880
Well of course.

44:45.880 --> 44:48.000
I mean VB like ASP classic is still around.

44:48.000 --> 44:49.520
I'm not saying it's going to die.

44:49.520 --> 44:55.960
I'm just saying think about think about the task they are attempting to take here.

44:55.960 --> 44:57.600
Let's take your five year timeline.

44:57.600 --> 45:03.720
Let's say they're perfecting things on GNOME KDE you know all the whatever the GTK desktops

45:03.720 --> 45:06.480
and they're perfecting Aqua.

45:06.480 --> 45:11.680
Well I don't know man I was looking old in the tooth in five years will it still be Aqua.

45:11.680 --> 45:15.800
Windows made the deal with the devil to support everything forever.

45:15.800 --> 45:19.640
Trust me I was in the registry the other this morning it was terrible.

45:19.640 --> 45:22.960
The platforms aren't going to stay still.

45:22.960 --> 45:28.440
And I have done so much different development that I can tell you that even today Xamarin

45:28.440 --> 45:32.780
has significant problems on Android and I don't care what you say I don't care what

45:32.780 --> 45:38.080
third party library you want me to download you shouldn't have to write that Xamarin labs

45:38.080 --> 45:43.160
crap it should either be in Xamarin or it should frankly not exist.

45:43.160 --> 45:46.520
I was an early adopter of Xamarin when they were an independent company.

45:46.520 --> 45:50.280
It was beautiful on iOS that had nothing to do with them.

45:50.280 --> 45:54.400
That had everything to do with iOS was native code or rendering images.

45:54.400 --> 45:59.520
You could not have a list view with images in it like a table view on Android without

45:59.520 --> 46:02.680
it crashing either stuttering or on lower end phones just running out of memory and

46:02.680 --> 46:03.680
blowing up.

46:03.680 --> 46:07.400
And the answer was what they call at the time custom renders which is basically just give

46:07.400 --> 46:10.560
up the advantage of cross platform and write a native view.

46:10.560 --> 46:15.040
Which if you're going to do that do it in C++ and write everything native maintain your

46:15.040 --> 46:19.920
own little gooey library or just use the native gooey widgets right just you can call back

46:19.920 --> 46:24.160
into a C++ binary and actually have something that's good.

46:24.160 --> 46:27.760
So I think I see what you're saying you're saying not only is it just obvious that the

46:27.760 --> 46:35.320
task is too large of a scope and never going to be completed but history shows us that

46:35.320 --> 46:39.680
by the time they get somewhere all of the other platforms will be changing and they'll

46:39.680 --> 46:40.680
need to update.

46:40.680 --> 46:44.200
Well there'll be a new platform right there'll be a new platform.

46:44.200 --> 46:45.920
Constantly catching up constantly chasing.

46:45.920 --> 46:51.560
Of course this is a problem even with what I colloquially call Xamarin classic which

46:51.560 --> 46:55.960
was not with the form stuff for like they would always be especially right in the beginning

46:55.960 --> 47:00.160
when they were independent racing to catch up with the IOS features that would come out

47:00.160 --> 47:03.120
and there would be bugs and there would be issues and you'd have to patch and you'd be

47:03.120 --> 47:05.120
running a pre-release versions.

47:05.120 --> 47:10.480
I don't know I'm cautious sure so somebody says I think Xamarin is a good tool if you

47:10.480 --> 47:14.800
know that you have let's say I can give you a real world example we know we want to target

47:14.800 --> 47:19.240
Windows tablets and we may want to one day port to Android.

47:19.240 --> 47:23.240
That's a use case where as long as you know what you're doing you avoid the edge cases

47:23.240 --> 47:28.400
and Android but this idea that I'm going to write a single MSI or X here whatever the

47:28.400 --> 47:34.320
binary format is going to be or app image right that's just going to magically render

47:34.320 --> 47:39.200
these GUI elements correctly and look good and not feel like crap on all these different

47:39.200 --> 47:46.400
platforms including GTK Linux and mobile seems insane to me.

47:46.400 --> 47:50.400
I'd like to mention our friends at a cloud guru have a data preparation for Python course

47:50.400 --> 47:55.040
Python can absolutely be a powerful tool for data preparation why not learn how to properly

47:55.040 --> 47:56.040
use it.

47:56.040 --> 47:59.240
So in their course they'll quickly cover how to connect to various database types jump

47:59.240 --> 48:04.160
into using Panda Python packages for data preparation and they'll even look at examples

48:04.160 --> 48:10.440
for cleansing data visualizations exploration and of course pre-processing data for machine

48:10.440 --> 48:12.920
learning that is the air after all.

48:12.920 --> 48:15.840
So I have a link in the show notes or you can go to cloudguru.com and search for data

48:15.840 --> 48:21.560
preparation for Python again that's a cloudguru.com data preparation for Python or use the link

48:21.560 --> 48:24.800
in the show notes.

48:24.800 --> 48:30.240
We just kind of touched on it but we got to talk about it GitHub has a new CEO and really

48:30.240 --> 48:33.800
it seems to me although I don't know but it seems like a kind of a new corporate oversight

48:33.800 --> 48:40.600
structure as well so Nat Friedman is stepping down November 15th Thomas Domke is being promoted

48:40.600 --> 48:45.920
to CEO he was hired by Nat shortly after Microsoft bought GitHub.

48:45.920 --> 48:50.680
Domke will report to Julia Lewisohn Lewisohn was directly involved with that hot reload

48:50.680 --> 48:56.400
drama that we kind of just skated right around earlier and Lewisohn was recently promoted

48:56.400 --> 49:02.480
to president of Microsoft's developer division kind of a huge change now as a celebrity and

49:02.480 --> 49:09.160
so when he became CEO I think the developer community went okay all right well okay we

49:09.160 --> 49:14.600
got a buffer between Microsoft and GitHub and I don't know Domke Thomas but he himself

49:14.600 --> 49:18.840
says he's not really the visionary type he's just more of the heads down worker type.

49:18.840 --> 49:25.120
I kind of worry that without somebody who has a strong vision and a passion it could

49:25.120 --> 49:32.240
be pretty easy to get rolled over by by corporate control in the new structure not that I would

49:32.240 --> 49:36.200
have any experience with anything like this but you know that just seems like this leaves

49:36.200 --> 49:41.400
GitHub in a little bit more of a precarious position not saying the sky is falling but

49:41.400 --> 49:46.120
I'm left a little uneasy with this change what are your thoughts though maybe I'm wrong

49:46.120 --> 49:50.280
I don't know what do you want GitHub to be trustworthy reliable I want to be able to

49:50.280 --> 49:55.480
count on it like because so much of the community uses it I just don't want there to be any

49:55.480 --> 49:59.520
kind of bad bait and switches well there's going to be the stuff that we've already seen

49:59.520 --> 50:04.680
right somebody puts up a thing to rip DRM off or on region code DVDs or I don't remember

50:04.680 --> 50:10.160
what it was exactly but you know the arm CA whatever it is since the cease and desist

50:10.160 --> 50:14.000
and GitHub takes it down because Microsoft's an American company and has to you know honor

50:14.000 --> 50:18.840
US court rulings and co-pilots already a thing co-pilot I think is bad and shouldn't exist

50:18.840 --> 50:25.800
but that's my little pet peeve as I said before I actually am not super upset by what I see

50:25.800 --> 50:30.600
people complaining about the idea that they would tie it closer to Azure and VS code I

50:30.600 --> 50:36.040
really think that especially for junior developers you know Heroku was a game changer for Ruby

50:36.040 --> 50:41.120
developers learning what to do and then they adopted other platforms I don't necessarily

50:41.120 --> 50:46.160
think it's wrong if Microsoft wants to make a few you know a few nickels by saying here

50:46.160 --> 50:51.320
dog we see you have a Python app or Java app or whatever dotnet six app and here's a button

50:51.320 --> 50:55.360
we automatically did the configuration and we'll go ahead and spin up a lambda or whatever

50:55.360 --> 51:00.520
they call their functions they call it Microsoft Azure functions or even just a straight up

51:00.520 --> 51:07.600
Azure you know IAS or open to instance I guess I'm just not worried about that I worry about

51:07.600 --> 51:13.440
the IP implications of code pilot I worry about all the legal stuff with like you get

51:13.440 --> 51:20.640
in a lawsuit yeah I know I know but I'm I feel like that is a transitory risk boy I

51:20.640 --> 51:27.240
just feels like GitHub has become one of the key pillars of the internet and you know we've

51:27.240 --> 51:32.200
siloed up a lot of stuff into these islands and it feels like the GitHub islands it's

51:32.200 --> 51:37.000
one that you know you got to pass through for a lot of internet stuff now I don't know

51:37.000 --> 51:42.480
I like the idea of somebody that has a real solid personality I don't mean to be disrespectful

51:42.480 --> 51:46.600
to Domka I don't know what he's like at all I've seen some interviews and he seemed kind

51:46.600 --> 51:50.440
of you know like a nice guy I mean I just want to say and you know we have to deal with

51:50.440 --> 51:55.520
the world as it is and we live in a world of pseudo monopolies and Titans right so

51:55.520 --> 52:01.360
if somebody had to own GitHub I'm sure happiest Microsoft and not Oracle true I'm just saying

52:01.360 --> 52:06.140
right like or or frankly even like you know Amazon who we've seen what they do to their

52:06.140 --> 52:12.160
partners quote unquote on the marketplace I I don't know I mean even like Salesforce

52:12.160 --> 52:17.800
has been a reasonable steward of Heroku granted the prices are ridiculous but so this new

52:17.800 --> 52:24.000
corporate structure is such where Domka will report to Louis and and she's now the president

52:24.000 --> 52:28.800
of Microsoft developer division I did a little bit of reading on her it seems like she's

52:28.800 --> 52:34.480
been pretty integral to a lot of their open source stuff lately so I know her most recent

52:34.480 --> 52:39.280
things kind of being kind of being in the middle of the hot reload drama but it seems

52:39.280 --> 52:45.280
if you look beyond just that she was pretty key in the rollout of VS code and some of

52:45.280 --> 52:48.240
the other open source stuff could just take like a minute to talk about the hot reload

52:48.240 --> 52:53.480
thing because this is where I go back to being evil capitalist where dotnet wants to be flutter

52:53.480 --> 52:57.920
what well okay one if it's a feature you think is good that's fine but now I know I think

52:57.920 --> 53:01.320
it is actually a nice feature I think it's fine right I'm not it doesn't it's not something

53:01.320 --> 53:06.600
that would be like a deal breaker for me but why is it necessarily evil if Microsoft was

53:06.600 --> 53:11.240
like yeah man we sell this IDE for like I don't even remember what a visual studio license

53:11.240 --> 53:15.800
costs I remember paying like two grand for them in the past why would it be crazy that

53:15.800 --> 53:19.700
they would have features that are on their commercial product rather than just giving

53:19.700 --> 53:25.360
everything away why would that even be like a problem perhaps the mistake was including

53:25.360 --> 53:31.120
it at all and then taking it away yeah okay but in theory if there's another feature let's

53:31.120 --> 53:38.980
call let's call it you know convert your code into vb6 or whatever and that was a paid feature

53:38.980 --> 53:42.140
and you just had to pay for it why couldn't there be paid features and VS code well we've

53:42.140 --> 53:45.580
gone down that route before and we actually got a few emails that said oh that'll never

53:45.580 --> 53:50.440
happen for these reasons and then we got another email said it's already started so you go

53:50.440 --> 53:56.400
figure I don't really know because I didn't follow closely enough but I guess conceptually

53:56.400 --> 54:01.400
I don't necessarily disagree with you I think what people expect is if something if something's

54:01.400 --> 54:06.680
open source and you contribute it it's kind of in there I guess I have a hard time really

54:06.680 --> 54:10.900
kind of coming up with the complete picture because I just I simply didn't follow close

54:10.900 --> 54:16.480
enough it seems like the main mistake was taking it away giving and taking and then

54:16.480 --> 54:20.820
they really had no choice but to give it back yes you see I guess I'm just like really wanting

54:20.820 --> 54:25.040
them to make a lot of money off making developers more productive without actually like reading

54:25.040 --> 54:30.120
their code and like that's why I'm super down with the deploy to Azure button right I want

54:30.120 --> 54:35.240
there to be whatever you know the equivalent of Visual Studio Enterprise Edition of VS

54:35.240 --> 54:39.760
code even where it's like you pay 300 bucks a month or not a month but a year or five

54:39.760 --> 54:45.040
whatever the number has to be so that they can say okay we are going to make money off

54:45.040 --> 54:49.480
of selling you this product or giving it away as open source and then having kind of an

54:49.480 --> 54:54.280
open core model I know that's a dirty word like the thing that really and I know I keep

54:54.280 --> 54:59.040
hitting this that keeps me up at night is the code pilot stuff and then the new basically

54:59.040 --> 55:03.680
code pilot equivalent in via Visual Studio proper that's the stuff where we're gonna

55:03.680 --> 55:09.560
get into some really murky cases where I mean let's just put it out there if I write something

55:09.560 --> 55:15.720
that code pilot violates the GPL on am I screwed because I committed it I put it out there

55:15.720 --> 55:19.300
I guess technically wouldn't that liability hit me I would think so that would destroy

55:19.300 --> 55:23.140
my whole business right overnight you better be checking every line that thing writes for

55:23.140 --> 55:27.120
you it's not gonna save you much time that's the reason I won't use it right like that

55:27.120 --> 55:33.100
isn't that kind of stuff the true true value of GitHub for Microsoft like the amount of

55:33.100 --> 55:39.440
insights they get to development trends from from all aspects from people who are just

55:39.440 --> 55:45.520
fantastic developers to up-and-coming languages and open source projects the GitHub from like

55:45.520 --> 55:51.680
a data collection standpoint has got to be one of the most valuable sets of users on

55:51.680 --> 55:55.480
the internet especially for a company like Microsoft who's building tools that targets

55:55.480 --> 56:01.900
developers and and a hosting platform like it just seems almost almost invaluable amounts

56:01.900 --> 56:06.640
of data and we don't really talk about GitHub from that standpoint but co-pilot shows us

56:06.640 --> 56:12.120
in a very overt in our face way how they can use the information that's on their platform

56:12.120 --> 56:16.080
and we're not always gonna like it in fact we probably won't know like it and this is

56:16.080 --> 56:20.040
probably just the beginning because this is the real reason they must have bought it right

56:20.040 --> 56:23.920
I think there's lots of reasons I bought it see I give them some credit one of the many

56:23.920 --> 56:27.680
one of but I bet you it's if you put them all out there it's got to be on the list because

56:27.680 --> 56:34.200
this isn't getting this kind of insight into developers is intensely valuable and this

56:34.200 --> 56:39.040
is a great opportunity by the way for GitLab to email the show Chris at Jupiter broadcasting.com

56:39.040 --> 56:42.920
let's talk I was gonna say do some advertising on this podcast because you know people are

56:42.920 --> 56:47.140
gonna also be getting less and less comfortable with this arrangement oh I do I do wonder

56:47.140 --> 56:51.000
though as GitHub becomes more and more convenient particularly for small developers and small

56:51.000 --> 56:56.900
shops does the attractiveness of hope hosting a GitLab CE instance just kind of start to

56:56.900 --> 57:02.300
go down I don't know I don't think so I think there's gonna be it's both ways it's not a

57:02.300 --> 57:06.940
one or the other they'll be like a backlash yeah exactly exactly and it's getting easy

57:06.940 --> 57:13.280
like Linode's got like a one-click you know one click boom you got GitLab you definitely

57:13.280 --> 57:17.400
need to patch that one click one because there is an exploit that makes it rough do a non-invasive

57:17.400 --> 57:22.760
DDoS attack holy smokes get it patched yeah you always got to do your updates especially

57:22.760 --> 57:26.360
if the image hasn't been updated for a bit go do your updates now thankfully they are

57:26.360 --> 57:31.040
very quick updates because they mirror the repos because it's Ruby you know what I'll

57:31.040 --> 57:36.920
often do really myself is I'll start with the base system that's just like Ubuntu and

57:36.920 --> 57:41.840
Docker and then just go from there myself I prefer it that way I would just before we

57:41.840 --> 57:47.440
get out here I want to say thank you to our coder QA team our oh there will be some upgrades

57:47.440 --> 57:52.880
in the near future and if you go to coderqa.co right now and sign up you can you'll be locking

57:52.880 --> 57:58.360
in the price so you might want to join right now plus you get access to the coderly report

57:58.360 --> 58:02.360
which comes out every quarter you get the limited ad feed but of course your support

58:02.360 --> 58:09.920
in the show keeping us going make it happen help us pay for Drew's fine fine skills and

58:09.920 --> 58:15.440
you can find the show at Coder Radio Show on Twitter I'm at Chris LAS where do you want

58:15.440 --> 58:21.920
to send people Mr. Dominic go to alice.dev love it.dev should have had that forever

58:21.920 --> 58:27.480
ago his company's at the mad bot or inky is at Dumanuco the network is at Jupiter signal

58:27.480 --> 58:33.160
