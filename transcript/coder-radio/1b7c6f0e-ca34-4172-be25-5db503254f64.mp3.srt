00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
This is Koto Radio episode 463 for April 25th, 2022.

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Hello there friends and welcome into Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show.

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Taking a pragmatic look at the art and the business of software development and the world of technology.

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:31,000
My name is Chris and joining us every single week is our host, fighting the cold, Mr. Dominic. Hello Mike.

5
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Hello, hello, hello and thank you the Halls Corporation. I don't know you the cough drops.

6
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
They're the MVP this week of the show.

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
MVP because I did not have a voice this morning and yet I'm back in my soldier tones by three o'clock.

8
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Impressive. Well done. Yeah, we were preparing for the worst.

9
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
But you know, then Elon bought Twitter and so you said we have to do a show.

10
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:59,000
We have to do a show and also special thanks to coding because coding.

11
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I don't understand what the deal is, but oh, I'm sorry. Yes, of course, Pink Elephant.

12
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Yes, Chris, the Pink Elephant wants you to know that Postgres is in fact the best database.

13
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,000
OK, good. I'm glad he's visiting. I was worried he would visit.

14
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
If it's Janice, the Green Fairy coding the Pink Elephant.

15
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Yes, I don't really want to talk about this Elon stuff really, other than I think we got to just wait.

16
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
He didn't buy Twitter, though. I thought he backed out. No. Wait, what?

17
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Yep. Get out. We're recording on Monday.

18
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
And so by the time people are listening to this, this will be like totally established.

19
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:37,000
But as we're going on the air, there are reports that the deal has been finalized.

20
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,000
But he just said he was moving on. I woke up this morning, made my tea and Elon was moved.

21
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
He had a tweet. I'm moving on. I retweeted it. I think you should.

22
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Well, obviously, if you're right, he he definitely did not move on.

23
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:57,000
As we go on the air right now, CNBC is reporting that Twitter has accepted Elon Musk's buyout deal.

24
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
The Twitter board has accepted the billionaire's offer to buy a social media company and take it private.

25
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
The announcement ends a weeks-long saga of Musk trying to buy the company.

26
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,000
The Twitter board tried to fend off the takeover, but is now acquiescing.

27
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Fifty four dollars and twenty cents per share. Approximately forty four billion dollars.

28
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Because you got to get the 420 reference.

29
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Everybody's freaking out on Twitter because Elon Musk is being described as a free speech maximalist, right?

30
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
An absolutist is what they're saying.

31
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,000
But on the day that it became public, like back in April, that Elon was considering doing this,

32
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
he was actually being interviewed by a TED talk interviewer.

33
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:43,000
And this came up and I have a 40 second clip that I want to play where Elon makes it clear that it's not just going to be like a absolute free speech.

34
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:49,000
May I interrupt for a second? So, I think for some of our younger audience or folks who aren't so deep into this,

35
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,000
he's buying it, but I'm assuming he's buying it and he's making it a private corporation again, right?

36
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
You are correct.

37
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Okay, so what that means, and Chris, jump in if I'm off base here.

38
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Jupiter Broadcasting and the Mad Butter Inc. are both private.

39
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
It means Chris and I basically can do whatever the f*** we want.

40
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:10,000
No one can tell us anything. We don't have to report other than our taxes.

41
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:19,000
If we decide that the president of the company, for instance, needs a pink elephant statue, then that's a business expense.

42
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
We can do that, right? Legitimate.

43
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
This is kind of why WeWork got in trouble, right?

44
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Because Adam Neumann was like, I'm totally going to watch the show. It's great. We crashed.

45
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
So, Elon theoretically taking this private.

46
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I kind of don't believe you, although I'm looking at the CNN page that says he did it.

47
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,000
So I'm struggling. Yeah, I mean, I love this because you and I are a little different.

48
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I think it should be a free for all.

49
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I hate it because I just now I know we're going to be talking about Twitter for weeks and I hate talking about Twitter.

50
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
It's one of the reasons I stopped doing tech talk today is because so many of the damn stories were about Facebook and Twitter.

51
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
And I'm like, I just couldn't people getting drunk and tweeting. Yeah, I could not care less.

52
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
But it is interesting from like a free speech debate.

53
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I find that part absolutely fascinating.

54
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:09,000
And it's interesting how everybody's already gone to 11 and I'll play a little bit of this clip.

55
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
It's it's a longer interview, which I'll link the entire interview in the show notes.

56
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
It's Musk at a at a TED talk 2022 almost a month ago.

57
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Here is sort of like I think one of the key takeaways from this clip.

58
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Twitter has become kind of the de facto town square.

59
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:38,000
So it's just really important that people have the both the reality and the perception that they are able to speak freely within the bounds of the law.

60
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:50,000
And, you know, so one of the things that I believe Twitter should do is open source the algorithm and make any changes to people's tweets.

61
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:59,000
You know, if they're emphasized or de-emphasized, that action should be made apparent so anyone can see that that action has been taken.

62
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:08,000
So there's no sort of behind the scenes manipulation, either algorithmically or manually.

63
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Later in the interview, he also again states that it's free speech within the bounds of the law.

64
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:25,000
And then he also says that he feels like the algorithm should be open source like Linux, where there are eyes on it and it's a community that updates it and things like that.

65
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:37,000
And I think is a compelling idea is you could leave some of the auto moderation, the dialing down of people's tweets, but just be transparent about the behavior.

66
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:45,000
That seems like a decent middle ground, and it doesn't sound like some sort of free speech, absolutist, worst case scenario that a lot of people are painting this.

67
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:50,000
And I can't imagine either that he's really going to have much time after, you know, after the six months or nine months goes by.

68
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,000
He's got a lot of he's got a lot going on. His attention is going to fade. I don't think this is a big deal.

69
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Everybody's making it seem. I mean, can I ask the stupid question? Yeah.

70
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:07,000
So Twitter's problem is that super influential with three groups of people, right? Journalists. Number one. Yes.

71
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Tech guys and gas, of course. Number two. Yep. And day traders. I don't even know what you call them.

72
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Day traders seems like a derogatory, but, you know, just a newsy class, right?

73
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,000
You have journalists in there. You have market reporters in there. Analysts.

74
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Exactly. But like they're not making enough money for their size. Twitter as a corporation is a.

75
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I mean, this is not my original idea, but it's pretty clear to me that based on the reporting, they're kind of fat.

76
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Like they're super bloated. Like the best thing that could happen on Twitter is like vicious layoffs.

77
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I'm sorry, but as somebody sent us an email, you know, tech boss, bro radio being pissed off.

78
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:54,000
But you know what? Like corporations don't exist to employ people and Twitter.

79
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I'd fire half the moderation team. I would let it be a free for all. What's wrong with it being a free for all?

80
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I don't I don't get it. Like there are laws that say you can't incite harm.

81
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Right. If you follow the law, then I kind of think not much other than how do you solve the mob problem that can sometimes develop?

82
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Right. It does seem like moderation there, tamping those things down to prevent that rapid fire mob creation that happens.

83
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Maybe there's a mob. The mob is the lefty mob. When they say they need moderation, they mean against the right wing folks today.

84
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Although, you know, you know, give it 20 years. Everything swings. You know, this country is constantly 20 years. Twitter won't exist.

85
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Maybe it probably would be 20 either. Twitter is not a functional business. That's my whole problem with like all the pearl clutching on Twitter.

86
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:48,000
It doesn't matter if you have a right wing or a left wing or a communist, a fascist, whatever.

87
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:53,000
By the way, Elon Musk is not a fascist and Bernie Sanders is not really a communist.

88
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I just want to say, right, like the the language is just so overheated.

89
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Our disagreements are there are no more real communists in America that have any power and there are no more real fascists that have any power.

90
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:12,000
We've just moved the goalpost. And we throw these labels around people to essentially collapse them to a single variable.

91
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Well, no, to silence them. Well, because it's easy to disregard everything you say if I successfully label you as a communist or I successfully label you as far right wing or a racist.

92
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Right. If you if you say some dude is racist, he now has to spend all his energy defeating the charge of racism.

93
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Yeah, I have to say in in whole, although this is not a firm position, I'm always kind of willing to like consider things.

94
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:47,000
But it seems to me that when we try to suppress information, especially now with the invention of the Internet, it always seems to backfire and create the Streisand effect and information that they want to suppress.

95
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Like, I don't know, you know, anything. It could be something medical. It could be something political.

96
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:58,000
It could be, you know, something about a laptop. It could be something about a politician that wants to run for office.

97
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Anything that they try to suppress, it seems like it inevitably just catches wildfire.

98
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:08,000
And now there's platforms specifically designed to amplify the things that other platforms are trying to suppress.

99
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:17,000
And they've created a market that can thrive when they suppress things now. And I'm not sure I have ever actually seen it successfully work.

100
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:22,000
And it seems like the only thing I have seen work and it is not a consistent process.

101
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:30,000
It is not a clean process. It is not a 100 percent thing. But the only thing I have really seen work is self-education over time.

102
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Yes, it doesn't always work, but it's better than trying to hide information from people in terms of results, in my opinion.

103
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:43,000
But that would require, like, valuing all ideas equally, which we've decided can't be done because...

104
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Well, we've decided some ideas are more dangerous than others. And that is what a society does.

105
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:53,000
And I just don't think Twitter properly represents the dialogue. It's probably core of what you're saying here.

106
00:09:53,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I think Twitter has shifted at least six or seven basis points left. Seriously, than actual American culture.

107
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Hey, we should leave this.

108
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,000
No, yeah. Yeah, we should. But I can see what you're saying. But yeah, we'll move on. We'll get into the show.

109
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:14,000
It's just this is the kind of stuff that when somebody like Elon, who is a bajillionaire, comes in and just buys a massive tech platform...

110
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Sure, Elon, Mazel tov. Good work.

111
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Yeah. Well, this is what you get. This is what you get. Enjoy.

112
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Fire everybody. Can them. Get rid of the board. Just one more thing on this.

113
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:31,000
The eunuchs of the tech world are the Twitter board. Seriously, they've got nothing.

114
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:37,000
They don't use Twitter themselves. They don't have a f***ing thing. They don't know how to run a business.

115
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:42,000
They don't know how to make money, apparently, because Twitter, with all its users, is wildly undervalued.

116
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:47,000
This buyout wouldn't have been successful had they had money, right? They could have had other options. They would have had other...

117
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Or how about cojones? But I know that's not woke. You can't say cojones because that's gendered. But I completely disagree with you.

118
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I think Twitter's problem is it focused too much on the culture stuff and did not behave like a business.

119
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Facebook, evil motherf***ers over there, are making dollar over dollar.

120
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Dollar over dollar. Yeah.

121
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Ask not what your podcast can boost for you, but what you can boost for your podcast.

122
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Wow.

123
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I know.

124
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Nev sent us 2000 sats today and he said, so I would like to interject for a moment and comment that this podcast does not contain any mention of Gentoo nor Emacs.

125
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:35,000
As such, I publicly challenge the next person who sends some sats to Jupiter Broadcasting to install Gentoo Linux as a daily driver for a whole week.

126
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:43,000
If they can prove it, I will directly send them 5000 sats and I will also match an additional 5000 sats to Jupiter Broadcasting.

127
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Giving them the right to declare this in their next boost challenge.

128
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Oh, Nev is thrown down. If you would like 5000 free sats, you have to install Gentoo for a week and then send us, I don't know, send us a boost with some screenshots to prove it.

129
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I love this idea of people challenging themselves. Go for it.

130
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I have flashbacks to the coding challenge with Wes and I'm going to cry.

131
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
It does have that vibe.

132
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Gentoo seems like a very unusual ask.

133
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
I guess it wouldn't be a challenge if it wasn't challenging.

134
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
You know what? I respect it.

135
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
I haven't heard about Gentoo in a long time and you know what? Great.

136
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Four score and seven boosts to go.

137
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
All right, Jin for Matik writes in with 1000 sats three days ago.

138
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Hey guys, I just wanted to ask you about your thoughts about DNS on the blockchain.

139
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
It seems like a new direction to be considered.

140
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Have you heard about Namecoin or Unstoppable Domains?

141
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
These are completely independent of traditional DNS and ICANN.

142
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Brave and Opera browsers have recently natively integrated their resolution of these domain names.

143
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:45,000
When Firefox and Chrome follow, you won't have to renew or pay for a domain for an entire year every year.

144
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
What do you guys think about this?

145
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,000
A lot of this crypto stuff is like a parallel universe, man.

146
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:58,000
It's like a sidecar to the actual financial system or storage system like IPFS.

147
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Or in this case, they've come up with their own DNS system that has coins based on it.

148
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
I'm not a fan of it, but it is the concept.

149
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:12,000
The idea is to decentralize the DNS system with blockchain and then update browsers to check that versus a DNS server.

150
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:20,000
No, no, that's that's a horrific idea because your loading times would be like devastating.

151
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,000
You'd have to have like a lot of heavy caching, which would basically be a DNS server.

152
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Wouldn't the heavy caching just reproduce your ISPs?

153
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:35,000
I feel like that's like the worst thing ever. I mean, email, you're great, but that idea is bad.

154
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Yeah, I think. Although I will admit I have not dug deep enough. So this is my first pass.

155
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
I mean, why? What about ICANN?

156
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Well, the idea is to get rid of them, right?

157
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Isn't that the law, though?

158
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Right. But if you were to create the Internet today, would you centralize something as important like the name resolution to that group?

159
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
I certainly would because the FBI exists.

160
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Yeah, and they would force me to.

161
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:05,000
I don't understand how could you even do this without like going directly to federal prison?

162
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:18,000
OK, what about this? What about like what if this whole like, you know, trends around censorship and all of that continue and they're just there becomes like this growing alternative ecosystem of ways to browse the Internet that don't involve the traditional systems?

163
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Well, I mean, organized crime has always existed and it will always exist. But are you asking me to put my small business on a criminal network?

164
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Yeah, I don't think that's going to be very a very compelling argument, is it?

165
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Explain something to you about an agency that doesn't exist. Let's call it no such agency.

166
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:41,000
They're real and invested in capturing all your traffic and knowing who owns what sites.

167
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:46,000
They they care a lot. So maybe bad idea.

168
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:57,000
That's always the linchpin with a lot of these decentralized alternatives is is the interested parties, the quote unquote stakeholders that you are supplanting, are they going to allow this to happen?

169
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Right. Are they are they armed federal agents who will take you on a boat 10 miles off the coast of New Jersey and shoot you in the back of the head and say, well, hey, listen, I killed him off.

170
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
You know, he wasn't here.

171
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:21,000
And if your answer is, well, it's going to be a slow thing and inevitably they'll have no choice. Then my response to that is that probably means you're looking at a revolution or you're looking at 15, 20 years before it gets adopted.

172
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Right. I mean, it's that kind of thing is very, very slow or they have had it for 10 years already.

173
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:31,000
And you or they've already got a guy they got a guy in there already. That's like, you know, sabotaging or something.

174
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
And like they've done it before. Do it again.

175
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,000
That's what I would do if I were running an intelligence agency for the United States government.

176
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:43,000
I would absolutely have like a Web three crypto division and I'd just be having my guys.

177
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:48,000
I'm not convinced half the Web three guys on Twitter aren't just straight up bots or spies. Spooks.

178
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Right. I got to tell you, this is sideways, but some of the stuff I keep getting in my email seems very NSA adjacent.

179
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
That's a little NSA adjacent. I like that.

180
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:06,000
If you would like to send us a boost, go get a new podcast app at newpodcastapps.com or there's apps out there like the breeze wallet.

181
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,000
So you don't have to change your podcast app and you can send us a boost from the breeze wallet.

182
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,000
The way I do it is they have a podcasting section in that app. You add one feed, the one you want to boost.

183
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:19,000
You just go in there and send us a boost. There's also things out there like boost CLI.

184
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:27,000
The whole idea here and why I'm talking about this right now is the value for value model is something that I think could be applied to not only podcasts,

185
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:36,000
but also free software content. The value for value idea is is that if you get value from a show or maybe an open source application,

186
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:43,000
then you return value in some form. For most people, monetary value is probably the thing they have the most availability and time for.

187
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:49,000
But value could be something that's also maybe your talent. Perhaps you're good at something and you contribute that back to the show.

188
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Maybe you've got a great email or a take on something and you send that into the show or you give us a boost or maybe it's your time somehow.

189
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Maybe there's something that we need on the back end, like we have some website projects coming up this summer.

190
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:05,000
That's a way you can contribute value that is not necessarily monetary or you share the podcast with someone.

191
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:10,000
That's a way you can provide value that is necessarily your time or a talent or monetary.

192
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:15,000
But the idea of value for value is that if you get value from this podcast, you give value back.

193
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:20,000
That's why they're taking off and people love doing the boost. You can try it with a new podcast app.

194
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:29,000
But I could also see this model working for free software one day if you get something like a great media player or a Web app that helps you organize your home stuff.

195
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:35,000
And it's something you really enjoy and you get a lot of value from. We could return that value to free software developers.

196
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:40,000
So I think the value for value model is not something that only applies to content.

197
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:45,000
I think it could apply to software. And where I think the boost fit in is the lightning network is a payment network.

198
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:53,000
It's a peer to peer payment network. That's what it is. It allows you to send value across a peer to peer network directly without a middleman.

199
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,000
And that is something that we haven't had before.

200
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:02,000
We haven't had the ability to take value and send it to anyone and they can receive it on their end and convert it their local currency.

201
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:08,000
In the past, we've had to use things like PayPal or a wire transfer or an ACH transfer if that's possible.

202
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,000
It's been really complicated and it's been a huge barrier for free software developers.

203
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:22,000
It's early days. But if people like us don't try this stuff, if we don't push these things, if we don't drive over the potholes, who will?

204
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Somebody has to. We have to be the early adopters on some of this. So there's the pitch.

205
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,000
That's why we talk about the boosts and we'd love to have you join us. You can also send us an email.

206
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Those are also valuable. Coder dot show slash contact. And a guy named Ryan wrote in.

207
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:39,000
He says, I've tried sending a boost, but it said that the podcast wasn't part of the lightning network.

208
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:43,000
I'm using the Coder QA feed if that makes a difference. And it does, Ryan.

209
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Our member feeds do not support boosts at the moment because our membership provider doesn't integrate the podcasting 2.0 spec.

210
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:55,000
It's a whole bunch of other various RSS feed items. It's you know, you use a service, you use a platform.

211
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Sometimes it has limitations, right? I mean, that's a downside. But they also manage all of the user accounts, the processing, all of that, you know.

212
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,000
So that's the upside. Something we're thinking about, though.

213
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:09,000
He says, I was wondering if you guys could follow up on your VR office experience.

214
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:13,000
You had me all hot and bothered about getting an Oculus a couple of weeks ago, but it seems like maybe your interest has waned.

215
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Keep up the great work. I keep hitting edge cases, but maybe you should go first because I want to be a negative Nancy.

216
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,000
No, I mean, I don't have a super positive take.

217
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:29,000
I don't use the office thing as much now just because the resolution isn't quite there on a three hundred dollar headset.

218
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:36,000
However, I have been enjoying it for video content and for games, but I just haven't had a lot of time.

219
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:45,000
So it's still holding up in that regard. And I think what it's proved out to me and kind of where I've tapped the brakes a little bit is I like some of the concepts here.

220
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:52,000
The hardware needs to be another generation. And I don't I don't get full value out of this thing until there's a network effect.

221
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Like the day you and I are sitting in a VR room doing this show. Game changer.

222
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Or if West gets one. Right. But I don't want to ask all of my friends to go get something connected to meta.

223
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:11,000
And so I've tapped I've tapped the brakes and I'm waiting for other hardware solutions to come along and the resolutions to get a little bit better.

224
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:23,000
But in terms of casual content consumption and some video games are just they're like no other experience of the Star Wars games that I've played so far are like nothing else I've ever done.

225
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:28,000
And so when I get like 45 minutes to game, I've been grabbing the Oculus and not the switch recently.

226
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:37,000
But I have not been using it for work much. So can I tell you when, you know, 10,000 of our best friends?

227
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Yeah, I tried the office thing and I in the next 90 days will be opening a new location for the matter.

228
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Virtual office. No go. No go. Yes. So, yay. If you're a landlord in the Tampa area and would like to lease me some derelict factory or something, I'm I'm here for it.

229
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Yeah, it did not work for many of the reasons you stated mostly resolution.

230
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:10,000
People started complaining about motion sickness. Yeah, I could see that for some people.

231
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Yeah, you know, I know I was a big proponent of remote work. I have to say it's not the best.

232
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:24,000
It's difficult to mentor junior employees in a remote environment. No doubt. So, yeah, we're we're going back.

233
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Uncle Tim style. I don't disagree. I definitely notice every time any of the J.B.

234
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Cruz together, we get so much more done together than we do when we're apart.

235
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Yeah, I I could see the resolution getting better for the screen because really where the where the resolution gets me is the text.

236
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:44,000
The screens I bring into the virtual workspace via code looks like garbage.

237
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Right. That's yeah. And it's tricky when you now got high display, you know, nice monitors.

238
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:54,000
They're pretty common. And so you're putting on the Oculus and you're like you're going back.

239
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,000
You're going way back in terms of like screen resolution. Now you can make those suckers huge.

240
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:04,000
You could make them like 200 inch screens or whatever, because you're in a virtual environment. That's all fun.

241
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:10,000
But as far as the the text readability, it's pretty pretty bad unless you make it huge like that.

242
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:19,000
However, now several what couple of months into it, I'm still very impressed by the polish of the Oculus software and the entire user experience.

243
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:27,000
The setting your boundaries, this app store experience, the just the general interface, the little lounge area that they put you in is beautiful.

244
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Everybody that I've had tried out has always been very impressed.

245
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:38,000
But I suppose all in all, my experience with the Oculus has made me realize that when another device comes out, perhaps by a different vendor, I'll probably jump in.

246
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:44,000
I'll get it. Angel writes in high coders. I graduated from a computer engineering school, I guess a year ago.

247
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,000
I feel like I'm ready to move away from the usual support jobs I've been in for the last few years.

248
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:54,000
I'd like a programming entry level job. Do you have any advice on actually searching for jobs?

249
00:22:54,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Any actual job boards you recommend or tips, recruiting agencies? Should I steer away from those? Use them?

250
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,000
What are your thoughts? Do you have any hot tips for people looking for work?

251
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:11,000
I do. I do, actually. So recruiters are pimps. So I would stay away from them.

252
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:16,000
So this is hard, right? So, you know, there is a meeting of the minds that can happen.

253
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:25,000
There are many small businesses that want to hire you, but they don't have the resources and reach to be at the top of, let's say, ZipRecruiter, indeed.

254
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:31,000
You ever notice on ZipRecruiter, like the junior developer job, the salary range is like 60 grand?

255
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Like, it's crazy. Do you know why? Because there's hundreds of little businesses that pay 50 whatever, you know, 50, 55, 60.

256
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:48,000
And there's like a Microsoft campus in Tampa that pays 115. But you have to have gone to MIT.

257
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:58,000
So maybe try to find your local small business that it preferably, like, honestly, if somebody right now wrote into the mad bottom is like, I'm local.

258
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:04,000
I want a job. You know, I'll come into the office. Give me a shot. I would probably hire them.

259
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:11,000
We just went through a pretty rough period. A lot of that was due to remote stuff.

260
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:18,000
It's not easy for a small business to hire, retain and manage remote employees.

261
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Maybe that's my hot take. I know that's an unpopular opinion.

262
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:25,000
No, I think you're probably right, because generally it requires an employee success team.

263
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Right. And when the remote, you have to, like, do more.

264
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:36,000
And offer more opportunities to connect, hold a virtual get together on Fridays or something like that.

265
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Yeah. So I think my advice would be similar is check around in your local businesses.

266
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Think about the kind of business size that would be required to support the wage you need and then go do some door knocking.

267
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,000
It won't be the only strategy, but I think it's one to employ.

268
00:24:51,000 --> 00:25:03,000
I found that myself when I was in IT contracting right here in the little town that I have the studio now, I just picked up a couple of clients by, you know, kind of looking at this doctor's office is probably, you know, this big of a building.

269
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:09,000
They have about this many clients that can probably afford somebody. So I go and knock on the door and sure enough, I got the job.

270
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:18,000
So sometimes there is there is just sort of a, you know, go knock on doors approach you can take while also also taking advantage of things like real job boards and stuff.

271
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:26,000
But if you have recommendations for job boards that have worked for you or things like that, send us a boost and let us know or go to Coder dot show slash contact.

272
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:32,000
I'm pretty excited, though. I have a bit of an announcement. I got a new thing that I launched.

273
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:40,000
He's pregnant. I'm working on it. No, I'm not. I'm not. I did. I already birthed it. It's called Office Hours, Office Hours dot hair.

274
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:44,000
That's my new baby. It is a show for the Jupiter broadcasting community.

275
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:50,000
We're going to be talking about projects. This coming up episode, we'll be talking about things that are going on in the podcasting industry.

276
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:55,000
It'll be an outlet for me to get that all out of my system, be taking in feedback, responding to questions.

277
00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:01,000
It's essentially the office come into my office of a mumble room open on Tuesdays, every other Tuesday.

278
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:07,000
If you're listening to this, that Tuesday just happened. It'll be available for download at office hours dot hair.

279
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:14,000
And it's out. We have two episodes out already. The third one's being recorded as we as you and I are talking tomorrow.

280
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,000
But as people are listening to the download, it'll have been yesterday.

281
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:22,000
It'll probably be out in the feed soon. And if you get the all shows all shows feed, you always get all those goodies.

282
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Office hours dot hair.

283
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Linode dot com slash coder. Go there to get one hundred dollars in 60 day credit on a new account and you go there to support the show.

284
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Linode makes cloud computing simple, affordable and accessible. And it's fast. It's what I've used to deploy everything in the cloud for the last couple of years.

285
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Really, it's just the best. And now that they've been rolling out MVME storage, my rigs have gotten even faster.

286
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,000
I didn't even realize some of my rigs were getting upgraded.

287
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:57,000
And if you have any kind of application that benefits from high IOPS, you know, good disk throughput, MVME is a game changer for those applications,

288
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:05,000
in particular, like your databases, anything that's kind of transactional like that, they can operate much more efficiently with a faster MVME storage.

289
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:09,000
And Linode's got it going right. And there's there's systems there that are perfect for like a budget system.

290
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Maybe you just have a small Web site. Maybe it's a status page or a portfolio.

291
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,000
You can get something like five dollars a month. It's still got SSD hard drives.

292
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:22,000
It's still got a 40 gigabit connection to the Internet. They've got 11 data centers for you to choose from.

293
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,000
And if you're a performance hound, it just scales up.

294
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:32,000
I recently deployed a system with 48 CPU cores and 96 gigabytes of RAM.

295
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:37,000
It's awesome. And they've been doing this for like 19 years. So they've really refined this product.

296
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:40,000
It wasn't like a throw spaghetti at the wall kind of company.

297
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:47,000
They started doing this stuff because they were passionate about Linux and the new virtualization capabilities coming to Linux nearly 20 years ago.

298
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:51,000
They saw where that was going and they built an incredible company on top of that.

299
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:56,000
And now they just have the best cloud for developers and they back it all up with the best support in the business.

300
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:00,000
And I love being able to say that. It matters that I can say that.

301
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:04,000
And that's why they're willing to give you one hundred dollars so you can see it for yourself.

302
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:09,000
And it's a great chance to build something, learn something and support the show.

303
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:15,000
Linode.com slash Coder. Go get that one hundred dollars for 60 days on that new account and you support the show.

304
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:20,000
It's Linode.com slash Coder.

305
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:30,000
GitLab is kicking off all free accounts with more than five users starting June 22nd, 2022.

306
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:39,000
It does not apply to their paid SaaS and self-managed subscriptions, community programs like GitLab for Education or GitLab for Startups or GitLab for Open Source.

307
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:47,000
But if you're just a boring old user with a free plan, then they're kicking you off if you've got more than five users.

308
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:54,000
They're spinning this as an opportunity for GitLab to improve the SaaS efficiency of their offering.

309
00:28:54,000 --> 00:29:01,000
And they say they are introducing a five user limit per namespace on GitLab for the free tier.

310
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:04,000
Is this heresy? The audience is pretty upset.

311
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:11,000
I mean, life is complicated, right? GitLab needs to make more money on their free tier and they're not.

312
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
So that's why they're doing it.

313
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:16,000
At least they're not lying. I mean, they seem pretty clear about it.

314
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:27,000
I think it would be unfair to them if we didn't mention that their main competitor, GitHub, now no longer has to give a shit about their balance sheet because it's run by Microsoft.

315
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Yeah, it's tricky, huh?

316
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:35,000
So I don't really blame GitLab for this, but I do worry about the future of GitLab.

317
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Microsoft is in this weird place where they're such a big private public company, rather, that they don't really need to make money.

318
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
They basically take rent from so many places.

319
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:48,000
Right. GitHub is effectively a loss leader for Azure.

320
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:55,000
So I'm not sure what to say here, other than I'm super happy that GitLab is open source and I can run it.

321
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:59,000
I mean, I'm just saying lino.com slash coder. They got a one click GitLab deployment.

322
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,000
Right. Yeah.

323
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,000
This is the thing, though, and I don't know how we got here, Mike.

324
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:13,000
And I know you and I have hit our heads against this, but how the hell did we get to a point where people expect something like GitLab to just be infinitely free like this?

325
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:18,000
And the people that are upset, they're using GitLab for their work, man.

326
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,000
They're using GitLab for production stuff, but they're not paying for it.

327
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:28,000
Like, how did we get to this point that people are upset that the thing that they should be paying for is now the deal has changed a little bit?

328
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:36,000
And like, I'm the kind of guy that if I'm using a service for my business and I'm not paying for it, that's alarming to me.

329
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,000
I'm concerned when I'm not paying for something. Right.

330
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
That's like a red flag for me.

331
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:46,000
Makes sense. Yeah. No, I feel the same way. I mean, I just want to take you back in time.

332
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:54,000
Ten years ago, yes, we were doing the show over 10 years ago. The idea that like high quality spreadsheet software was free.

333
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
Right.

334
00:30:55,000 --> 00:31:02,000
Like people used to pay Corel and Microsoft and other companies for a spreadsheet or for a document editor.

335
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,000
Yeah.

336
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:08,000
And Google decided, no, that's free. And Microsoft has frankly made it effectively free.

337
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Do you remember StarOffice? That was a radical idea. And then OpenOffice came from Star.

338
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. That's way back.

339
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,000
Yeah, yeah.

340
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:21,000
Unfortunately, software has been commoditized aggressively.

341
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:27,000
And this is also one of the reasons why I think you and I have said more and more, if it's critical to your business and you can do it, self-host it.

342
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:32,000
Consider self-hosting. Now, it's not always the option because you got to have some expertise.

343
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:38,000
You got to maintain it. It takes time. So you're trading off paying somebody to do that for you versus hosting it yourself.

344
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:42,000
But ultimately, you also kind of have that insurance policy that they can't rug pull you.

345
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:47,000
That thing that you've built is going to run. Even if your provider shuts down, you could move it to another provider.

346
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:53,000
It's portable like that. It's not under their control. And, you know, sometimes that's the peace of mind you need for these sort of things.

347
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:56,000
You know, can I make an iron Lee Ball statement here?

348
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,000
Yeah.

349
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:02,000
The best thing I ever did was have the server facility in Plant City, Florida. We host everything.

350
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:07,000
And there's cloud backups or whatever. But you know what? I'm a heavy GitLab user, right?

351
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:11,000
My whole business effectively runs on GitLab and Trello and Slack, I guess.

352
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:20,000
But we can bitch about the Slack updates another time because it's like they write code to make it worse.

353
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:27,000
It's almost as if their enemies were writing the code for them, like, we'll slow it down and your notifications won't make sense.

354
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
Maybe they use an autopilot.

355
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:37,000
No, you know what I think they're doing, to be honest with you? I think they're so focused on mobile that they're just messing up the Mac client.

356
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:46,000
I could see that. You know, I was thinking this morning, I think probably because of this GitLab story as I was setting up the primary tooling I use here at the studio.

357
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:51,000
In the actual physical studio part, but also the little server setup that we have here.

358
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:58,000
None of it's really changed since 2018, early 2019. I mean, we've updated it, you know, kept the software up to date.

359
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:04,000
But because everything here is local and self-hosted, I have never had my tooling this static before.

360
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:10,000
Like just the core tooling I use to produce the shows has not changed for like three years or something like that.

361
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
That is really rare for me.

362
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:17,000
And I know that if all of this was like cloud apps that I was loading in web pages, that would not be the case.

363
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:24,000
Like the only thing we struggle with ever when we're recording are the web apps that we inevitably use to connect to each other.

364
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:28,000
And I think a big part is because we decided to build that infrastructure and host it and run it here.

365
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
And so we say when it changes.

366
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:36,000
But are we being a little tough on the audience? Because, you know, we say we built the infrastructure, but it wasn't easy, right?

367
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:43,000
It's like a spectrum, right? Because the stuff that is audience facing, that's all up on Linode.

368
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:49,000
So it's like we've sort of taken this sort of hybrid approach of some of our stuff is we self-host that.

369
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:55,000
And some of our stuff we either self-hosted on Linode or like in the case of our membership system, that's a service.

370
00:33:55,000 --> 00:34:02,000
And it kind of sort of like each time I weigh the pros and cons for that individual function.

371
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:10,000
And so we kind of, yeah, we have a balance. But when it comes to like just the core job of recording and producing these shows, that tooling has been rock solid.

372
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:14,000
It hasn't had to change. That's been nice because that's the core of the business.

373
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:19,000
I'm obviously doing the same thing, so.

374
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:23,000
TailScale.com slash coder. Go there to get a free personal account for up to 20 devices.

375
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:28,000
And of course, you support the show. TailScale is a next level zero config VPN.

376
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:34,000
It installs on any device you've got in minutes. It'll help you work with your firewall rules. It'll work behind a double net.

377
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:39,000
It'll let your devices connect directly to each other using WireGuard's noise protocol encryption,

378
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:45,000
building you a flat mesh network with the best VPN security in the business.

379
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:48,000
I started using TailScale to keep all of my family's computers connected.

380
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:54,000
I started with my son's computer that I put on my daughter's computers and just kind of put it on my wife's machine and my own.

381
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:59,000
The system just kind of grew from there. But then I quickly realized it was a game changer for my work.

382
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:04,000
And I do not say that lightly. This is like adding sync services or using Git.

383
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:08,000
Like it's a whole new level of tooling that has improved the way I work.

384
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:14,000
And now I can get so much more done on my phone, on my iPad, on my Raspberry Pis, on my servers.

385
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:18,000
They're all part of this flat WireGuard protected mesh network.

386
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:22,000
It's just fantastic. And it makes it so quick to pop onto a Web app or a dashboard

387
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:27,000
or check something that's secure behind our firewall. Just get the job done on the go.

388
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
And when I'm traveling, it was a lifesaver.

389
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:34,000
You guys know that I mentioned that while I was traveling, it totally opened up a whole new way for me to work.

390
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:39,000
So go try it out for free for up to 20 devices when you go to tailscale.com slash coder.

391
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:44,000
One of the best parts is that every device on that network gets a stable IP.

392
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:49,000
And if you put a DNS server in that network, you get magic DNS capabilities as well.

393
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:55,000
But the nice thing is I've now built out a list of bookmarks that are just my tail scale addresses for things.

394
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
And I just from whatever machine I'm at now,

395
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:01,000
I use the same IP to get to everything on the machines I've chose to set it up on.

396
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:06,000
And I love that tail scale supports my single sign on provider with its two factor authentication.

397
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:10,000
So you can easily enforce multi factor authentication for your users

398
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:14,000
and you can deauthorize employees or friends when you need to.

399
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
I love the ACL support as well.

400
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:20,000
It's letting Wes and I try out some super cool stuff with our different tail scale networks.

401
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:24,000
I use it every single day and I know it's going to be a game changer

402
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:27,000
and you're going to be impressed at how fast you can get it set up.

403
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:35,000
So go get started today for yourself and for up to 20 machines for free by visiting tailscale.com slash coder.

404
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:41,000
That's tailscale.com slash coder.

405
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:44,000
All right, Apple and Google are cleaning house.

406
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:48,000
Devs are pissed and sad all over the socials.

407
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,000
Prop top games wrote, I feel sick.

408
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:56,000
Apple just sent me an email saying they're removing my free game because it's more than two years old.

409
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
It's part of their app improvement system.

410
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
But this is just not cool.

411
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
Console games from 2000 are still available for sale.

412
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,000
This is unfair barrier to indie developers.

413
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:10,000
And then he adds, I'm sitting here on a Friday night working myself to the bone after my day job,

414
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:14,000
trying my best to scrape a living together for my indie game,

415
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:20,000
trying to keep up with Apple and Google and Unity and Xcode and Mac OS changes that happen so fast my head spins

416
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:24,000
while performing worse on older devices.

417
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:34,000
Google on November 1st will remove all apps that do not meet a certain API level within two years of the latest major Android OS release.

418
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:40,000
Google says it'll place limits on which users are able to discover or install them if they don't update their apps.

419
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:46,000
So both Apple and Google, right around the same time again, it's just so funny how that keeps happening,

420
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:50,000
have laid out new policies about their app store and they've begun enforcing them.

421
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:55,000
We've known about this for a little bit, but the reactions are kind of interesting.

422
00:37:55,000 --> 00:38:00,000
And essentially some developers are saying there is no reason for me to update my app.

423
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:04,000
I haven't needed to update my app in the last two years. It works just fine.

424
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:08,000
Why should I have to update my app? And they're pissed about it.

425
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:16,000
Yeah, it's tough. I mean, I understand that, you know, the app stores want to keep their catalog clean,

426
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:24,000
but in particular the Google case seems really rough to me because a lot of people are using a lot of old Google APIs

427
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:30,000
and that's, if you've ever done Android development, that's kind of the way it goes.

428
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:35,000
Have you seen most people in the real world Android phones? Most of them are, yeah, way old.

429
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:41,000
I know this is supposed to be an Apple story, but I find the Google position to be a little...

430
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,000
More aggressive?

431
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:48,000
Well, frankly, tone deaf to what the developers are doing, right? Like what reality looks like.

432
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:55,000
My hot take on this was the Google one is harder, right? Because if you've got to update your app to use a new set of APIs,

433
00:38:55,000 --> 00:39:00,000
that is going to take legitimate work depending on your app. But for the Apple one,

434
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:06,000
and people were chiming in on this protopop guy's Twitter feed, for the Apple one,

435
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:11,000
you could just kind of, you know, do a new build and in the change log just say,

436
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:18,000
updates and bug fixes and Apple accepts it. And then your app has been technically updated in the last two years

437
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:21,000
and it doesn't get pulled from the App Store. Other people in the thread also said,

438
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:25,000
hey, by the way, bro, like the energy usage of your app is kind of like redonkulous.

439
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:29,000
You know, if you just did a couple of small updates, you could really cut the energy usage down.

440
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:34,000
That kind of stuff was in the thread as well. But he just looks at it as, you know, it works good enough.

441
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
People are happy with it. Customers aren't complaining.

442
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:41,000
And now I got to update all this software because this guy hasn't updated anything probably in the last two years either,

443
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:48,000
it sounds like, based on the fact that he's bitching about Unity, Xcode and Mac OS all having to get updated.

444
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,000
I mean, I get it, right? But like at the same time, I don't.

445
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:56,000
You're the one that chose to get in the App Store game. This is sort of that racket.

446
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:00,000
And, you know, like you got to play that game and you can't have it both ways.

447
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:04,000
So I do understand and I definitely appreciate that it sucks when you're busy.

448
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:09,000
At the same time, I'm just sitting here going like, well, then maybe don't get in the App Store, bro.

449
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:12,000
Maybe you should have made it like a WebGL app or something. I don't know.

450
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:15,000
I hate it, but it's sort of that's the reality of that store.

451
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:20,000
It's like if you don't like the Walmart, you don't sell your product at Walmart.

452
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:23,000
And it means you miss out on a huge audience and that sucks.

453
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:28,000
But that's already been the reality of the commercial market for a long time.

454
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:34,000
The Google one is trickier, but maybe more defensible in some ways, I think.

455
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:39,000
Because updating those APIs is probably necessary, where the Apple one's just sort of checking a box.

456
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:42,000
So at least the Google one's actually producing results.

457
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:46,000
Well, you know what? I appreciate you doing a show when you're not feeling well.

458
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000

And it's Elon. It's Elon's fault.

479
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
Elon just, like, wrecks me.

480
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:54,000
Well, the good news is there's no chance we'll be talking about Twitter and Elon next week.

481
