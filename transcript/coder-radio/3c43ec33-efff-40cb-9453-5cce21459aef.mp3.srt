My name is Chris and sitting there in his podcasting position is our prominent host,

9
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:45,320
Mr. Dominic.

10
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:46,320
Hello, Mike.

11
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:47,320
What up, dogs?

12
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:48,320
Misa here.

13
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:51,400
Misa ready to throw bomb bombs at all your MacBooks?

14
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:53,400
Pew, pew, pew.

15
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:54,400
Oh, oh, man.

16
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:55,400
Oh, boy.

17
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:56,400
What did you do?

18
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:57,400
What did you do?

19
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:58,400
I topped you so hard.

20
00:00:58,400 --> 00:00:59,400
I- Okay.

21
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:03,720
Do you know on certain websites that means something that you don't?

22
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:04,720
Easy sale, right?

23
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:05,720
Easy.

24
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:06,720
Right.

25
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:07,720
Right.

26
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:08,720
I'll slow down there.

27
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:11,860
Um, you know, cause I know you've like, you've, you've spilled a couple silly cups of a small

28
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:13,200
beverages here and there.

29
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,200
Gin.

30
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,200
Yeah.

31
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,200
On a laptop.

32
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:20,080
Well, I decided that if I was going to outdo you, that I'd have to outdo you by about 17

33
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,080
gallons.

34
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:25,920
And, uh, over the weekend I spilled 17 gallons of water all over all of my electronics that

35
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:26,920
I have at home.

36
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:27,920
Um, gallons?

37
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:28,920
Gallons.

38
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:29,920
Yeah.

39
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:30,920
How?

40
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:31,920
How?

41
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,640
I was packing up for a little, a little trip, a little road trip.

42
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:38,960
And I went around the, the place and I picked up every electronics I have and I put it in

43
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,220
this cloth basket.

44
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:46,200
Every game controller, every like USB-C charging brick, every, uh, I had a couple of Amazon

45
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,400
firetables that I used to control my automation system.

46
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,520
I put those in there too cause they were loose.

47
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:51,520
Everything in there.

48
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:55,160
And then because I was going down the road, I put it in the sink and I didn't, I didn't

49
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:58,480
because I didn't want it to spill and then I, and then yada, yada, yada.

50
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,480
I got super distracted.

51
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:03,760
A couple of things came up at the last minute and I forgot to turn off my water pump.

52
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,760
Oh, okay.

53
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:10,800
I must've hit a bump and I have this super old like 2013 Mac book that has Arch Linux

54
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,360
on it and it's a heavy tank.

55
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,360
Of course it has Arch.

56
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,360
Yeah.

57
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,360
Yeah.

58
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,360
By the way, it has Arch.

59
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:22,400
And so that thing slid off the counter and hit the sink faucet and turned it on and I

60
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,880
didn't know cause I'm driving and no one else is in the rig with me.

61
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:29,600
And so I'm pulling in to get gas and I hear like the waves at the ocean.

62
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:30,920
I'm like, what?

63
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:34,740
And I look back behind me and my entire life goes slow-mo.

64
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:38,720
As I'm coming into the gas station, I'm kind of going downhill into the parking lot.

65
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:44,160
A wave of water comes rushing at me down the center of the RV and of course it spills into

66
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:49,360
the stairwell and it's just all of this water that had been collecting back there, pooling

67
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,160
up in my electronics.

68
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:56,120
I get back there, man, and the basket that I'd put everything in was a bathtub.

69
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,240
Everything's floating in there.

70
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,240
It was all gone.

71
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,240
I'm sorry.

72
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,240
That's like a lot of water.

73
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:06,660
And I had my Mac book, I snuck cause I brought my Mac book with me and I snuck that under

74
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:10,440
the countertop and that also got wrecked.

75
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:14,600
So the Mac book turned on the water and then it got water all over it and it's so that

76
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:18,920
got just, that actually interestingly enough is turning on and works.

77
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:22,480
I turned it on this morning after days of letting it dry and some water got under the

78
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:23,480
screen.

79
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:26,640
I can see some discoloration where the water got under the screen, but the machine's actually

80
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:27,640
working.

81
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:28,640
Well, you know why, right?

82
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:31,440
They had to, they had to fortify them after you bought a few.

83
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,440
Right.

84
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:34,360
I've been doing this for over a decade.

85
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,360
They're ready for me.

86
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:40,720
I go to the genius bar, they take the 19 year old out of the genius bar and they're like,

87
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,260
the guy's 45.

88
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:46,080
He looks at me and says, what do you got, son?

89
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,160
And I said, well, here's the deal.

90
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,760
I was at Burning Man.

91
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:57,680
Let me tell you something, let me tell you something, there's no way.

92
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:03,960
I mean like, okay, 17 gallons of water is enough to, no one's going to survive that,

93
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:04,960
right?

94
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:05,960
I spill a martini.

95
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:06,960
I'm sorry.

96
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:07,960
Yeah.

97
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,760
I'm a little pissed off right now.

98
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:13,840
I spill a martini and everybody's dunking on me on Twitter for being, you know, drunk

99
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:16,800
old Dean Martin spilling drinks on his laptop.

100
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:19,720
You you're like, no, no, not a drink.

101
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,640
How about 17 gallons of water?

102
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:22,640
Yep.

103
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:23,640
I mean, come on dude.

104
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:25,640
I was so upset.

105
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:28,560
And of course I was going out camping and I needed that water too.

106
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,040
So it meant the entire camping trip, we were like out of 20 gallons of water.

107
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:38,560
Oh, that was your, that was your reserve, dude, what are you doing?

108
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:42,760
I, you're never supposed to leave the pump on and you know, that laptop got left on the

109
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:44,160
counter cause we were in a big rush.

110
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,840
I was trying to get out to the woods so I could record a podcast, go figure.

111
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:51,480
And so I was rushing and I, I just, I made the, it's just the biggest mistake ever.

112
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:53,160
Oh, good times.

113
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:57,400
So yeah, 17 gallons, you have some catching up to do.

114
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,400
Do I though?

115
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:02,800
I mean, if we went back to, you know.

116
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,080
You may have me still beat on number of machines.

117
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:09,320
I just want to say this is a MacBook Air that I'm doing this show on because by the way,

118
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:13,200
if anybody mentions sound quality being better, it's cause I'm on Mac tonight, not Linux.

119
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:15,840
But I do have nice things to say about Cosmic later.

120
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,840
Oh, okay.

121
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:18,840
We'll get there.

122
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:19,840
We'll get there.

123
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:20,840
We'll get there.

124
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:21,840
That's what, that's what I tell all the women I sleep with.

125
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:22,840
But you know what?

126
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:23,840
It'll happen.

127
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:24,840
It'll happen.

128
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:29,520
It doesn't really matter because most programmers are going to lose their jobs anyways, at least

129
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:32,420
according to Maxi Contiere.

130
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:36,800
He says that, I'm almost sure that's not how you say his name, but I'm pretty sure I looked

131
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:37,800
it up.

132
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:38,800
I looked it up.

133
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:39,800
Contiere?

134
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:40,800
Yeah.

135
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:41,800
Okay buddy.

136
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:45,680
You didn't have to bring attention to his weird last name though.

137
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,400
I really did though.

138
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,400
You did.

139
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,400
You did.

140
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:53,580
Anyway, so Mr. Contiere says that instead of programming computers directly, we will

141
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:58,600
ask them to create the thing and they will do it for us, like in Star Trek.

142
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:02,920
And as such, computer engineers and computer scientists will essentially need to become

143
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:08,720
more like business engineers and business scientists and design the models of businesses

144
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,960
that will employ these computers that will do the programming for us.

145
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:12,960
I'm sorry.

146
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:13,960
Business scientists?

147
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:14,960
Mm-hmm.

148
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:15,960
Yeah.

149
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:16,960
Be a business scientist.

150
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,760
Don't you want to be a business scientist?

151
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,880
I think we are business scientists actually.

152
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:23,240
You and I right now.

153
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:24,240
Business?

154
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,080
It's weird because you're right, but I can't tell you why you're right.

155
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,360
Oh, I love those kind of.

156
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,440
That's beginning in three months.

157
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:35,360
So I actually agree with this guy's article, but I think he's kind of a D bag in a lot

158
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,360
of ways.

159
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:41,520
One, he compares C sharp to low-level languages.

160
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:45,460
C sharp is not a low-level language in any universe.

161
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:52,760
Let me introduce you to assembler or C and maybe C++.

162
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:54,440
It's not the same thing.

163
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:58,800
I think what he means is statically typed languages and he's kind of, and he's got a

164
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:03,520
master's in comp sci and I get what he's saying, like the structures, blah, blah, blah, the

165
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,820
computer, the compiler, whatever should do it for you.

166
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:11,320
But ultimately, I don't know, we have enough memory now that math doesn't matter until

167
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,320
it does.

168
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:14,800
And when it does, that's where you make money.

169
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:19,360
I'm in this weird position of I'm the one who put this in the show notes because I actually

170
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:22,140
agree with him to a point.

171
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:27,880
But I think his whole thing about like, we're just not going to dictate specs to a computer

172
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:30,440
and here's why.

173
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:35,920
My job of owning a software development company where we have products and we do consulting

174
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:39,480
is figuring out what the goddamn hell the customer wants.

175
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,480
No kidding.

176
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:45,640
If I can't figure that out, how am I going to dictate that in terms a computer can understand?

177
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:48,960
Well I think his thinking is that they'll be so intelligent.

178
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:52,320
And you know what's got him on this track, right, is that GitHub co-pilot.

179
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:53,720
That's what's got everybody thinking about this.

180
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:57,940
I have many thoughts on that, which is also why I put it in the notes.

181
00:07:57,940 --> 00:08:02,580
Some people are saying that, oh, it's a GPL violator because they trained it on GPL code,

182
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:07,920
but they're not making co-pilot itself available as a GPL product, which, yeah.

183
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:14,840
Before we swing into co-pilot, see, I'm leery about questioning this gentleman's argument

184
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:21,080
only because, you know, who am I, a guy with a middy full lit degree of hype?

185
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:26,000
But the hard part of my job is not writing code, which is where he and I agree, right?

186
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:31,480
The hard part is my customers change their minds all the goddamn time.

187
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:34,200
And they don't even really understand what they're asking for, and I'm not saying that

188
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,200
to be rude.

189
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,440
No, no, you're absolutely correct.

190
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:40,280
They don't do this kind of stuff on a day to day basis, so they don't even know how

191
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:42,360
to articulate the requirements.

192
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:47,720
And then to say nothing about, they always fail to understand the issues of scope creep

193
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:53,000
and changing goalposts mid-project, like it's natural human instinct.

194
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,480
We did an iPad presentation.

195
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:59,720
We did it in landscape because it's an iPad, and they were a media company.

196
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:02,760
I won't say the name because I don't know that I can.

197
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:03,760
Disney.

198
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,760
No, it's not Disney.

199
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:08,200
And then at the end of the presentation, they're like, that's awesome.

200
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,600
Great job, boys.

201
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:13,760
So what does it look like in portrait?

202
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:19,720
Now this is back in the iOS, like five days where there was no auto lit.

203
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:20,720
Right.

204
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:21,720
Yeah.

205
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:24,640
You never know what the customer wants.

206
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:25,640
Just like my car.

207
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:27,440
I would tattoo that on my ass.

208
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:32,320
I think maybe that's a continuous point is that you you will manage the business and

209
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:35,360
the relationships and then provide the input to the computer.

210
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,360
And then it will.

211
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,360
Right.

212
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:41,720
But my argument to that is you as the human putting the input to the computer do not actually

213
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,400
know what the customer really wants.

214
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:47,200
You don't know it until you ship them something and they tell you that they don't like it

215
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,440
whether there is something missing.

216
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:54,240
Then again, if the computer is doing the programming, if it has to refactor, well, at least it doesn't

217
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,600
cost a bunch of man hours.

218
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,160
Well, I mean, if the silence kill us all.

219
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,160
Great.

220
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:01,800
I mean, yeah, they're going to start developing for themselves is what's going to happen.

221
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:05,560
Can I get the cute Cylon starting here, starting with Copilot?

222
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:07,560
You know, they're going to use Copilot to do it.

223
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:09,480
You know, Copilot has those cute green ears.

224
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,480
Oh, geez.

225
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:16,120
OK, so what's this about it completing code with suggestions that include swearing?

226
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:22,080
Yeah, so it's sort of just took in a bunch of code on public repositories and the Doom

227
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:28,360
repository, the video game Doom for folks who are doing to now classic PC game.

228
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:31,680
It's great, although it sucks by today's standards.

229
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:36,000
Yeah, it just regurgitated the entire code.

230
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:41,280
So even the comments, yeah, even the comments for the copyright, I'm watching a video of

231
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:42,680
it as you talk about it.

232
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:48,080
And even just the the actual line for line copyright notice that was in the comments

233
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:51,000
of the code is recreated.

234
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,160
That's remarkable.

235
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:56,120
I would not expect it to be reproducing code at that at that level.

236
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,120
Really?

237
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,120
I would.

238
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:02,280
I mean, any anybody who's done ML understands that's just pattern matching, right?

239
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:05,720
And if there is an exact pattern, if you type in the exact function name, it's going to

240
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:07,480
give you the exact code back.

241
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:08,480
Right.

242
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:11,560
Yeah, I suppose I guess it does make sense on a technical level, but it just seems like

243
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:15,840
it's something they would have tried to avoid from a product level.

244
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:16,840
But how?

245
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:17,840
Yeah, maybe they can't.

246
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:18,840
Maybe they can't.

247
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:24,120
I mean, what's the mechanism to avoid that without, you know, the the people dunking

248
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:28,280
on this, the code that they regurgitated actually works.

249
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:33,840
Maybe it's, you know, out of style today, whatever best practices, but it works because

250
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:36,120
it works in 1991.

251
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:39,240
Have they waded into copyright territory issues here with this?

252
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,000
Like it seems I'm not an attorney.

253
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,640
It seems like a gray area.

254
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:47,240
I kind of was laughing earlier when when people were saying maybe it's a GPL violation.

255
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:52,280
But if it's actually if it's going to reproduce GPL code, oh, kids, no one gives a fuck about

256
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,280
the GPL.

257
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:55,280
But basically, that was the argument.

258
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:57,400
It was like, ah, don't be a big pain in the neck.

259
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,520
Nobody's going to like you if you go so extreme.

260
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:00,520
Let me ask you a question.

261
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:05,800
Who who has enough money is going to sue GitHub, i.e. Microsoft, for a GPL violation?

262
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:09,120
Nobody, because Microsoft pays the bills at the Linux Foundation now, right?

263
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,720
So that's why the GPL is a fucking joke.

264
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:14,680
And everybody should go to Apache or BSD.

265
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:16,400
Free software is ridiculous.

266
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,760
Such installments and asshole.

267
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:18,760
Let's just move on.

268
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:23,320
Well, Google may be starting their decline, according to Mike from Butte.

269
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:27,480
He says, I like your take on Google CEO taking time to make decisions.

270
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,940
However, I think I disagree.

271
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:31,960
Google is suffering from their own success.

272
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:36,540
Most successful companies go through this Xerox, IBM, Microsoft and now Google.

273
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:40,440
They start out small with laser vision focus and ninja like agility.

274
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:44,040
This is why Google was able to eat Microsoft's lunch back in the day.

275
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:47,200
It was large, arrogant, complacent, sluggish.

276
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,200
And they even drank their own Kool-Aid.

277
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:50,160
Are you describing my mom right now?

278
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:53,160
I think I was just describing Apple.

279
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:57,760
Oh, yeah, listen, you can insult my mom, but not Apple, buddy.

280
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:58,760
Come on.

281
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:01,640
Calm down, Grist.

282
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:03,940
Mike from Butte goes on to say, Google is at this point now.

283
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:07,480
They're spending more time protecting their kingdom than they are innovating.

284
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:11,280
Sure they're large now, but some company is going to come out of nowhere and make them

285
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:12,280
irrelevant overnight.

286
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:17,880
He says, look at Blackberry and what Apple did with the iPhone.

287
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:21,800
Sure, Google will probably be around for decades, but they're on their way out.

288
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:24,920
They're worth one trillion now, but they're already starting their decline.

289
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:26,420
Just my two cents.

290
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:28,720
Not a chance.

291
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:32,460
OK, so Google has monopoly power.

292
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:37,240
And if if we had a guy from Yelp on here, he'd tell us exactly how painful it is to

293
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:39,240
compete with Google.

294
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,280
It's not the same thing.

295
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:43,080
Blackberry did not have ecosystem control.

296
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:47,760
Google has ecosystem control, and that ecosystem is everybody who searches the Internet.

297
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:48,760
Right.

298
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:51,600
And don't forget, some of Google's properties are some of the most valuable ad real estate

299
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,600
in the world.

300
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:56,600
So if they want to promote Chrome there or another Google product, they have Google search

301
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:57,600
to advertise.

302
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:58,600
Chrome?

303
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,600
Who gives a fuck about Chrome?

304
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,600
How about just search ads?

305
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:01,600
Yeah.

306
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:09,520
Android is like somebody's pet project where he's NSFW, masturbating because he doesn't

307
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:13,340
like the iPhone, which, by the way, iPhone is better.

308
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:14,520
I guess I kind of agree.

309
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,600
It's like I think you kind of agree.

310
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:19,080
I think you're a closet Apple fan.

311
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:25,520
I like the idea that that Apple and Google and Amazon will only have so much time in

312
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:27,960
the sun and eventually they will be eclipsed.

313
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:28,960
Not possible.

314
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,520
I like that idea, though.

315
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:34,320
But Google has such a lock on the Internet advertising market.

316
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,320
I agree.

317
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:37,060
And don't forget infrastructure.

318
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:38,060
Just infrastructure, dude.

319
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:40,120
They're in DNS, they're in hosting.

320
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,120
Yeah, dude.

321
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:44,200
I know Google apps for business.

322
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:51,800
I mean, Chrome OS and the schools like they are the the the big five tech companies are

323
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:55,360
at a level and a scale like I don't think humanity has ever witnessed.

324
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,600
These are nation sized companies now.

325
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,880
No, they're not nations.

326
00:14:58,880 --> 00:14:59,880
They're superpowers.

327
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:06,280
Yeah, they're not like, you know, no disrespect to Nigeria, but they're not Nigeria, right?

328
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:11,400
They're USSR, Soviet or Soviet Union, the United States, right?

329
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:13,120
They are not little countries.

330
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,640
They are.

331
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:17,360
I'm sorry, but.

332
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:20,880
It's just it's the Brits might say it's bollocks.

333
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:21,880
It's nonsense.

334
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:22,880
Yeah.

335
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,360
Google has a lock on advertising.

336
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:28,560
I deleted my Facebook account recently or a while ago.

337
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:29,560
Three weeks ago.

338
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:30,560
Oh, congratulations.

339
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:31,560
Nope.

340
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:36,920
It also deleted my business Facebook page.

341
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:39,280
Or it suspended it.

342
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:44,980
My traffic to my business page has been down 82 percent.

343
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:46,020
That's not a made up number.

344
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:48,920
That's from Fathom, the analytics company we use.

345
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:50,520
Man, that is bad.

346
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:56,800
I now need to re activate my personal Facebook account, right, so that we can get in, turn

347
00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:01,440
the business page back on and start posting in for the business or else I lose the traffic

348
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,440
to the business.

349
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:08,400
And Chris, I know you know that traffic to your business page, that's I mean, that's

350
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:12,240
I think that's exactly the situation I have going on with my Facebook account and the

351
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:17,420
J.B. and I just haven't even wanted to try to figure out how to fix it because it means

352
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:21,160
spending more time on Facebook, you know, so it's like I've kept my account around,

353
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:25,800
but I I don't think I've posted anything in three years or something, but it's still there.

354
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:30,680
I deactivated mine for personal reasons, and I did not realize that that would also prevent

355
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:34,080
me from accessing my business account.

356
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:35,080
And that's.

357
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:38,880
Oh, boy, that's yeah, that stinks, man.

358
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,620
That's that's a hard lock, right?

359
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:41,620
That's yeah.

360
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:42,620
Yeah.

361
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:46,640
The other thing that the other thing that struck me just yesterday is it was the Fourth

362
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:53,360
of July yesterday and we were driving out to this diner that's out in out near the spot

363
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:58,000
we were staying in the woods and we looked it up on Google Maps and Google Maps said

364
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,280
the business was closed.

365
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:02,400
I said, that doesn't seem right.

366
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:04,240
They normally are open today.

367
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:08,720
And so we kept going and we show up and sure enough, they were still open.

368
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:14,520
And I thought to myself, like, how many people looked at Google Maps and it said this place

369
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:17,240
is closed and they just said, I will go somewhere else.

370
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:22,480
And this small, tiny little diner that's ran by a family that doesn't know anything about

371
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:26,760
their Google listing or Google Maps entry has no power over that.

372
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:31,380
No direct action they know what to take and Google is actively turning away perfectly

373
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:33,800
good customers, telling them that they're closed.

374
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:39,280
And it's an example of just how there can be some kind of malicious activity that they

375
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,200
don't ever intend.

376
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:44,480
It's not it's not it's not an intentional act on Google's part.

377
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:47,960
It's just something fell through the cracks and somebody isn't updating the right page

378
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:52,360
or has they haven't gotten they haven't claimed their business on Google yet or whatever it

379
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:57,240
is that Google makes them do so that way their hours can be displayed correctly and they're

380
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:59,080
not even aware of it.

381
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:03,360
And it just shows you like they they are at a level now where they are integrated to our

382
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:04,360
society.

383
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:11,440
Amazon, Google, Apple, social networks that I think we can't even really fully see.

384
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,960
Like it's just we're too in the forest.

385
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:15,560
So let's let's zoom out.

386
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:19,600
Nick Spites writes in with our last email and I will try to get to more emails are just

387
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:23,240
a little behind, but do keep sending them in because they're big part of the show.

388
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:27,640
But Nick Spites writes, I'm curious, what are your thoughts on what will the future

389
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:30,360
of development look like and what might be possible?

390
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:38,540
I know Chris is a Rust guy.

391
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:43,500
And of course, Mike is an Objective C Jedi, but I'm curious about what you think the future

392
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:45,280
is going to look like.

393
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:46,280
Will it be Rust?

394
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:47,500
Will it be Golang?

395
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:48,500
Something else?

396
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:49,880
Just curious what you think.

397
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:50,880
All in good fun.

398
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,460
Thanks, guys.

399
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:56,720
So if you were to future cast, Mr. Dominic, obviously it's Rust, right?

400
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:59,880
I mean, clearly all Rust.

401
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:02,760
As much as it hurts me, it's JavaScript or TypeScript.

402
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:04,840
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

403
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:05,840
I could see that.

404
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,040
Also, real time update.

405
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:12,040
I just reactivated my Facebook account and I feel like you had to do it, though.

406
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:13,040
You know, I'm sorry.

407
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:14,040
I just threw up on the floor.

408
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:16,560
I just want to say Senator Warren, are you paying attention?

409
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:22,960
I was forced to reactivate my Facebook account to continue running ads for my business.

410
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:32,040
Yeah, but yeah, big tech, totally just going to go away.

411
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,680
Linode.com slash coder.

412
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:37,440
Now, no matter what skill level you're at or what technology stack you use, you can

413
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:41,580
check out Linode and get something up and running and get your idea alive on the web

414
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:42,580
quick.

415
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:47,160
Linode has amazing 24-7 customer support by phone or by ticket.

416
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:51,240
And along with hundreds of guides and tutorials, you're likely going to get started.

417
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:53,920
And realistically, you're a member of our community.

418
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:57,860
So there are tons of Linode users hanging out in our community that can answer questions

419
00:19:57,860 --> 00:19:58,860
as well.

420
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:01,400
We have integrated Linode as part of our team.

421
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,760
They're like the infrastructure team here at J.P.

422
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:07,200
I mean, obviously it starts with us logging in and setting these things up, but you get

423
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:12,600
started and you can get access to things at just ridiculous speeds and at ridiculously

424
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:18,200
great prices, 35% to 50% less than what you're going to pay at the big cloud providers.

425
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:22,200
And there's some clever ways you can use Linode for multi-cloud setups as well.

426
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:27,080
Something we do here is we have a Nextcloud server here on the LAN that has a lot of our

427
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:29,360
offline archive assets.

428
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:34,520
And we can federate that with a Nextcloud server that's up on Linode that is our more

429
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:39,040
daily interactive things like the editing asset files and the projects that the editors

430
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:40,280
are working on.

431
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:44,600
That's up on a Linode that's fast for them and gives them centralized access.

432
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:49,240
And then as time goes on, we can age that stuff to our system here on our LAN.

433
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:53,500
So when we want to use cloud computing, there's a lot of different ways you can think of it.

434
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:57,200
And hybrid is a great option that you're hearing a lot as kind of like a hype option, especially

435
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,120
from the Red Hat and IBM camp.

436
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:03,540
But the reality is it just means using multiple data centers and multiple cloud providers

437
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:05,180
to get the best package.

438
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:08,400
And that's where I think Linode is extremely competitive.

439
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,840
They're very fast.

440
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,400
They are their own ISP.

441
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:13,740
They have 11 data centers around the world.

442
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:17,140
They have one click application deployments to get you up and running.

443
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:19,520
And of course, like I mentioned, they have that great support.

444
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:23,840
So if your production system ever has trouble, you know that you're getting the best support

445
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:24,840
in the business.

446
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:29,600
So go try it out and see what we've been talking about and support the Coder Radio program.

447
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:34,840
Go to linode.com slash coder, get $100 in 60 day credit on a new account and support

448
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:35,840
the show.

449
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:39,340
A great and quick use of Linux to be self hosting your own live stream setup.

450
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:40,880
That's something I've mentioned before.

451
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:45,520
And there is a product that you can one click deploy called own cast and it's like twitch

452
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:46,760
in a box.

453
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:50,440
So if you have a presentation you want to do, and you want to put it on your own website,

454
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:53,920
you want to provide your own experience, check out own cast.

455
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:56,260
You can deploy with one click on Linode.

456
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:59,400
And you can try it all out for free with that $100 60 day credit.

457
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:05,800
You go to linode.com slash coder, support the show and try it out.

458
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:10,620
Well I tried out Cosmic on Pop OS 2104.

459
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:15,720
After your hot and heavy take last week, I thought, okay, I got to try this out myself

460
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:18,960
and see what it's really like.

461
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:21,740
And there's some stuff I like about it.

462
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:25,160
But I do have, I do have a couple of issues.

463
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:27,000
Where would you like me to start?

464
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:31,740
I guess let's make it a sandwich, but backwards, what was your worst issue?

465
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:37,440
This is such a weird one, but first of all, I found it slightly unintuitive on how to deal

466
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,520
with fractional scaling.

467
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:46,360
I have a 1440p resolution laptop screen and I find that 200% high DPI mode is just, it's

468
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:49,160
way too little real estate.

469
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:51,200
Nothing really even fits on the screen.

470
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:55,360
And it really doesn't work well with tiling either because everything is so zoomed in

471
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:56,720
and so small.

472
00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:05,120
But the sweet spot on that 1440p Lenovo screen is 150%, which fractional scaling is just

473
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:08,040
a check box away, you turn that on.

474
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:13,840
But what I didn't know until I got some support from System76 is that I also then have to

475
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:19,280
disable the high DPI demon in order for it not to revert my settings every time the system

476
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:20,280
wakes up.

477
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:25,040
And it's just a little complicated and fiddly because it involved me going in and turning

478
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:29,680
something on and choosing a certain percentage and then I had to know to then disable something

479
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:30,680
else.

480
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:32,840
And it just wasn't, it wasn't implicitly clear to me.

481
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:37,280
And so that was a frustrating experience, but ultimately one that was a bit of my own

482
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:41,000
creation since I guess I had like some conflicting settings there.

483
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,840
And once I knew what to do, I was able to solve it.

484
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:47,040
Did you try the increased text size?

485
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:51,740
I don't have that turned on this time around just because I'm using the 150% fractional

486
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:54,540
scaling, but I typically do turn that on.

487
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:55,540
So do I.

488
00:23:55,540 --> 00:23:56,540
Yeah.

489
00:23:56,540 --> 00:23:57,600
That was my, I tweeted about it.

490
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:58,920
That was my like Achilles heel.

491
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:03,840
I couldn't read the goddamn font and I'm not that old guys.

492
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:07,420
Thank you for your help, Jeremy, but I am not that old.

493
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:12,400
That should be the default and get off my goddamn lawn.

494
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:18,900
The other thing that I found tricky about it is, and I can't unsee it, was the terminal

495
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:24,240
icon is slightly smaller than the other two icons around it and it's centered.

496
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:25,920
And I really can't unsee it once I've seen it.

497
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:29,780
I feel like that's a transparency pixel issue, right?

498
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:30,780
That's not.

499
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:34,040
It could be or just different weird shapes, but it just, it looks, it doesn't look even

500
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:38,080
and the only way to fix it is to change the whole system icon theme.

501
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:41,360
And that's just kind of unfortunate, but that's such a minor thing.

502
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:45,360
What I took away from it though is a couple of things they've added are like superior

503
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:50,920
to other Godome setups, their launcher and the ability to turn their tiling window extension

504
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:51,920
on and off.

505
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:55,680
I really like that because there are certain times I want tiling windows and there's other

506
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:58,200
times I don't want tiling windows.

507
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:03,160
So that kind of stuff made me, I just sort of was grateful that somebody is building

508
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:05,400
power user features for Linux desktop.

509
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:10,620
Like it's just, I think it's not that it's not user, new user friendly, but it's clearly

510
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:14,840
like the more power user you are, the faster you can move around because there's lots of

511
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:20,200
keyboard shortcuts and gesture support and the tiling window manager stuff.

512
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:24,920
It really seems to like kind of optimize for pro users, but yet try to be approachable

513
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:26,120
for new users.

514
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:30,280
And I have been waiting for somebody to do that because I feel like too often in Linux,

515
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:32,920
we cater to this mythical new user.

516
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:39,480
And so we create these interfaces that are very limited and that is not what's happening

517
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:40,480
here.

518
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:44,120
They've managed to strike a balance between making something approachable, but power users

519
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:45,440
sort of optimize for it.

520
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:51,120
And that I like a lot, not a fan of two bars, having a doc all along the bottom and having

521
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:55,480
a top bar is way too much of my vertical screen real estate eaten up.

522
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:57,540
So the doc had to go on the left hand side.

523
00:25:57,540 --> 00:25:59,140
They make that easy to do.

524
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:03,040
But what I would love to see is that top bar gets integrated into their doc and just one

525
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:05,600
bar, let's just go all in one bar.

526
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:07,760
That way I can get the most vertical space possible.

527
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:11,040
I know that's a pretty big change for GNOME, but I'd like to see that.

528
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:17,280
I mean, I was pretty happy with Cosmic, but for them calling me, you were coming in hot

529
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:18,280
and heavy a little bit.

530
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:24,640
I mean, not even a little like I was a little annoyed like, OK, listen, I really, really

531
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,200
want my desktop to be stable.

532
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:28,160
Yeah, you ended up reloading, didn't you?

533
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:29,160
I did reload.

534
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:32,640
I think something crazy happened in the upgrade.

535
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:36,720
And when I reloaded, it somehow magically worked, although I think maybe maybe Jeremy

536
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,000
hacked me.

537
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
Whatever.

538
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,120
It's cool.

539
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:41,120
We're friends.

540
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:43,880
So you were going from the previous pop to the new pop.

541
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:46,640
And then this time you just went clean install, right?

542
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:49,880
I was going from non cosmic to cosmic.

543
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:52,280
I think this is a good release.

544
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:54,000
I like where they're going.

545
00:26:54,000 --> 00:27:01,520
My pet peeve is I want keyboard shortcuts for, you know, quarter scaling, just like

546
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,080
magnet dot app on Mac.

547
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:04,080
Right.

548
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:06,680
I really don't want to have to move it, you know, click, click, click.

549
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:10,920
Yeah, they could use magnet dot app as a template for how all functionality should work with

550
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:11,920
the tiling.

551
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:12,920
Why don't you steal it?

552
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:13,920
I mean, Apple did it.

553
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:15,920
Yeah, I know, right?

554
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:17,400
I think so.

555
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:18,400
I agree.

556
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:23,680
Like the tiling stuff, honestly, after using Windows 11, it feels like what I like about

557
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:28,320
the way Windows 11 does it is you can tile per window so you don't have to.

558
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:32,000
It's not just tilings all on or tilings all off.

559
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:37,140
It's you can hover over the maximize button on Windows 11 or that that region.

560
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:41,440
And this really nice visual guide that gives you a visual layout of how the applications

561
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:43,840
will snap comes up.

562
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:45,160
You choose that.

563
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:48,120
The window then moves to the position you selected.

564
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:53,080
And then in the empty space, it goes into an expose mode where it shows you every window

565
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:54,120
available.

566
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:56,200
You click the one you want.

567
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:58,640
It does a smooth transition.

568
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:01,040
And then those two windows are bonded together.

569
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:06,080
And then if you click between the center of those two windows and you resize, they resize

570
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:09,520
together on Cosmic.

571
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:10,960
This does not happen.

572
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,980
First of all, it's just all tiling on all the time.

573
00:28:12,980 --> 00:28:14,160
And so everything gets tiled.

574
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:18,840
And sometimes you end up in a situation where like a settings window pops up and it's tiny

575
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:22,000
and you eventually build up a list of exceptions, but it takes a while.

576
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:26,680
But then additionally, the like the moving of the windows is jerky because of GNOME Shell.

577
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:32,440
So if you resize Chrome, it Chrome resizes and then a second later, the application,

578
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:36,600
the other application pops over and you see it draw on there like an old Windows box might

579
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:37,600
have.

580
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:39,040
And it's not smooth like it is in Windows 11.

581
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:43,720
And that's the problem is I just switched from Windows 11 for the weekend to Cosmic

582
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:44,920
and Pop OS.

583
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:47,480
And you loved it and you loved it.

584
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:53,360
Well, I felt like the way they're doing tiling windows in Windows 11 is really clever.

585
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:56,200
It's like per window instead of always on or always off.

586
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:57,200
Come on.

587
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:58,200
You twitched a little.

588
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:59,200
No, I'm actually otherwise.

589
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:01,600
Otherwise, I'm it's I'm plenty happy to be done using Windows.

590
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:02,600
Are you?

591
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:04,360
I for for five minutes.

592
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:05,360
For five minutes.

593
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:10,040
I was like, you know, this is nice because I have WSL and I could play a lot more games.

594
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:12,600
And then I kept using it.

595
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:15,200
And the reality is, it's still Windows.

596
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:18,760
Yeah, that's why I felt it's not as good as Mac.

597
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:21,760
Yeah, exactly.

598
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,040
But you got a new Thalia.

599
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:25,280
Oh, my new Thalia is amazing.

600
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:29,520
OK, so things I've bitched about in the Thalia is before and I'm just going to go over here.

601
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:30,520
The fan noise.

602
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:31,520
Gone.

603
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:32,520
Fantastic.

604
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:33,520
Really?

605
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:37,000
And I got the one with the black, the black color finish on the wood.

606
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Is it nearby?

607
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,760
You know, I want to hear it.

608
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:43,880
I have a full house, so I had to go into my bedroom to Chris.

609
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:45,240
My personal life is a goddamn mess.

610
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:46,240
You know that.

611
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:49,440
So you got a whole team of people over trying to put it together right now.

612
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,440
Is that you're telling me?

613
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:55,320
No, I got a whole team of people trying to do summer school and move us to New Jersey.

614
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:57,120
Oh, man, that's going to be crazy.

615
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:00,880
Dude, next couple of weeks, Kota radio listeners, Mike's going home.

616
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,880
He's going home.

617
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,680
There you go.

618
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:08,360
Yes, you're going back to the to the motherland.

619
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:13,880
We are going back to the Soviet Republic of New Jersey with Comrade Mercy.

620
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:14,880
The taxes.

621
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:18,160
My income goes down 10 percent the minute I cross the line.

622
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:19,160
This terrible.

623
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:20,880
Oh, man.

624
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:23,400
But the Thalia was great.

625
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:25,000
I don't even know what to say.

626
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:30,960
And I and I have to say, I was a bit of a how do you say this in English, bitch on Twitter

627
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:36,040
because I had a bug and I was too lazy to reinstall it first before tweeting because

628
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:37,040
you know.

629
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:38,040
Why not?

630
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:42,280
You've been podcasting for 13 years.

631
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:45,120
You don't flash USB drives without bitching first.

632
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:46,120
Put them on blast.

633
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:47,120
Put them on blast.

634
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:54,800
Listen, Marco Armit, bitches about a font, I'm just saying, like my patience, very high.

635
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:58,040
I got a lot of responses from the folks over there.

636
00:30:58,040 --> 00:31:02,920
And yeah, turns out it was a bad it was a bad copy of the image.

637
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:04,240
Well, or the upgrade.

638
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:05,240
Yeah.

639
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:06,240
Either way.

640
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,240
Oh, this is the new one.

641
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:08,240
Right.

642
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:09,240
Something happened in the.

643
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:10,240
No, no, no.

644
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:11,240
The upgrade.

645
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:12,240
No, no.

646
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:13,240
The new one came with the old OS.

647
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:14,240
That's the one I upgraded.

648
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:17,160
The old one that I upgraded is fine.

649
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:18,160
Yeah.

650
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:19,160
The upgrade gamble.

651
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:20,160
You never know.

652
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:24,360
I suppose you should always wipe and pave or you could just run Mac OS snow leopard.

653
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:27,720
Did you see the snow leopard available for download or something like that?

654
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:29,400
Wait, wait, wait.

655
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:33,960
What Apple's made a couple of old classic Mac OS is available for download.

656
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:34,960
Can I have a link?

657
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:38,040
I don't think you can install it on any new machine.

658
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:40,920
It's not like they've made an M1 version of it.

659
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:44,760
I will hunt on eBay to find a machine.

660
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:49,040
I'll use my blood to revive the battery with the return to New Jersey.

661
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:52,940
That means we should probably warn people that the live shows may vary in time.

662
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:56,580
So they're going to have to stay flexi with us and watch the calendar and we'll probably

663
00:31:56,580 --> 00:32:00,200
end up at recording once you're done moving at a new showtime.

664
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:02,800
Yes, I think it's the old showtime, though.

665
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:03,800
Yeah.

666
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:05,800
And also, why are we apologizing to them?

667
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:08,240
You know, they secretly run Mac OS anyway.

668
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:09,400
Yeah, that's probably true.

669
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:11,200
And you know, you know, most of them don't.

670
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,520
They don't even turn in live.

671
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:13,520
Like everybody listens.

672
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:19,080
They're like on overcast being like, ooh, Marco's colors are better than Apple podcast.

673
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:21,920
I don't know how they find us on the podcast apps.

674
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:23,000
I really don't.

675
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,280
Because Marco blocks it because he wants to f**k us over.

676
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:28,320
No, that's Apple that's blocking us.

677
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:29,320
Maybe they're working together.

678
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:33,320
Chris, you and I are just getting hate banged by all the Apple people.

679
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:37,160
Although the 20 hour battery life, I just can't give up.

680
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:41,520
You know who doesn't hate bang us, our members at coderqa.co.

681
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:43,160
They take care of us over there.

682
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:48,080
They support the show, they get a limited ad feed, and they get that coderly report,

683
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:51,240
which we're going to be working on new and soon, although everything's a little crazy

684
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:52,240
with Mike moving.

685
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:57,320
But coderly, coderly, the quarterly, there, I got it.

686
00:32:57,320 --> 00:33:02,040
The quarterly, coderly, ha, will be out soon-ish.

687
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:04,440
We do one each quarter for our members.

688
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:05,440
And I got a couple ideas.

689
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:08,840
I got a couple topic ideas so we can chat off air about that.

690
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:15,200
But you can become a member and support the show at coderqa.co and we appreciate that.

691
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:20,080
I'm at Chris LAS, the network is at Jupiter Signal, and the show is at Coder Radio Show

692
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:21,480
on the Twitter.

693
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:25,000
Links to what we talked about today, coder.show slash 421.

694
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,680
Over there you'll find our contact form, we'd love to hear from you, it's a big part of

695
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:28,720
the show.

696
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:33,760
Also our RSS feed, so that way you can subscribe and you just get the show automatically, regardless

697
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:37,360
of when we do it live or what moving's happening or nothing's.

698
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:42,120
Also if you would like to risk it, you can do that at jblive.tv and we'll put those times

699
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:45,080
over at jupiterbroadcasting.com slash calendar.

700
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:46,960
We'll make it available for you on the wild side.

701
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:50,680
Thanks so much for joining us on this week's episode of the Coder Radio program and we'll

702
00:33:50,680 --> 00:34:04,480
see you right back here next week.
