00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,240
This is KOTORadio, episode 417 for June 7th, Twenty-Twenty-One.

2
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:17,240
Well hey there, good looking!

3
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:20,800
Welcome into Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show, taking a pragmatic look at the

4
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:26,280
art and the business of software development, and the entire world of technology.

5
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:28,000
This episode is brought to you by a Cloud Guru.

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,820
You know a Cloud Guru has that Cloud playground, Azure, AWS, or Google's Cloud sandboxes on

7
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:35,320
ACG's credit card, and not yours.

8
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:38,340
That's right, you can get certified, you can get hired, and you can go hands-on and get

9
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:41,480
learning at acloudguru.com.

10
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:46,320
My name is Chris, and taking notes from today's keynote, it's our host, Mr. Dominic.

11
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:47,320
Hello, Mike.

12
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:48,920
I don't think we're going to fool them with that one.

13
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:49,920
No.

14
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:50,920
You're lucky I watched the keynote.

15
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:51,920
Yeah.

16
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:52,920
I know, right?

17
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:55,620
Yeah, I was impressed you were watching the keynote, actually.

18
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:58,680
And you know, I thought maybe, because we've got so much to talk about, we don't even need

19
00:00:58,680 --> 00:00:59,680
to talk about WWDC today.

20
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:00,680
You know?

21
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:01,680
We don't need it.

22
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:02,680
I'm fine with that.

23
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:03,680
Yeah.

24
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:05,480
Yeah, I got the launch keyboard right here.

25
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:06,480
You know what I'm saying?

26
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:07,480
Me too.

27
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:08,480
You got your launch?

28
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:12,160
Yeah, but what caps did you go with?

29
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:13,160
Or switches, I should say.

30
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:15,920
Yeah, I used the Royals, the quieter ones, I believe, right?

31
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:16,920
Yeah.

32
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:17,920
Which are quiet-ish.

33
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:24,880
Here, I'll give you a little demo.

34
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:25,880
Quiet-ish.

35
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:26,880
You know?

36
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:27,880
Oh, you don't need to give me a demo.

37
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:34,740
I, too, have launched a $285 keyboard.

38
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:35,740
Is it worth it?

39
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:36,740
Right off there, off the top.

40
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:37,740
What do you think?

41
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:38,740
I think, yes.

42
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:41,600
Now, it is an expensive keyboard.

43
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,360
No two ways about that.

44
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,960
But I'm extremely happy with it.

45
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:49,080
I mean, I've been using it primarily on Mac OS.

46
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:53,760
And the fact that they added a pinwheel effect for me is just glorious.

47
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:59,760
So yes, the beach ball of doom when Xcode, you know, does its thing.

48
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:05,840
Well, you know, the reality is it is a really nice typing experience.

49
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,440
I installed it in the studio here.

50
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:14,040
And I'm replacing the keyboard I talked about before, my Keychron K3, which was a nice $85

51
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,600
mechanical keyboard.

52
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:20,200
And Wes Payne can attest, because he has to sit in here with me in the studio, I could

53
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:24,220
never really get a good typing rhythm down with my Keytron.

54
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:27,400
It just was like not quite lining up with my hands.

55
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:30,140
And I fly on the launch.

56
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:31,520
And this is Wes's observation.

57
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:33,420
He brought it up to me yesterday.

58
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:36,800
He's like, you are typing faster than I have ever seen you type.

59
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,760
As long as he's known me, he mentioned.

60
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:41,560
And I really am just flying on this keyboard.

61
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,660
Now, I don't know exactly what they've done.

62
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:46,840
Maybe it's some of the sizing, the way things are laid out, the feel.

63
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:49,640
Maybe it's like 100 things that are all coming together.

64
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:52,360
But it is really a great typing experience.

65
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:54,000
It has a lot of really clever features.

66
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I'm going to deep dive into some of the software features you can modify and the layers you

67
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,820
can set up in Linux Unplugged this week.

68
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:05,640
But needless to say, I was skeptical that the price would be justified.

69
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:06,800
I will be honest.

70
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,280
I knew I would like it.

71
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:12,800
I had a pretty good idea that they knew what they were doing, because I've talked to them

72
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,200
over the years.

73
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:18,800
And I've kind of seen eye to eye with them on their philosophy about building this thing.

74
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:24,820
But I was legitimately worried that $285 was just kind of unjustifiable.

75
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:25,820
It's not cheap.

76
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:27,120
I think it's clearly worth it.

77
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:31,560
This is one of those cases where I put on my Marco Armin ATP t-shirt, which I have in

78
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,720
both blue and purple.

79
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:36,320
And I really do.

80
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:38,960
And in fact, I just ordered a pint glass from them.

81
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:43,560
And by the way, how do you justify such expensive beer glasses?

82
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,560
Me?

83
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,560
My glasses?

84
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:46,560
Mine are more cheap.

85
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,560
What are you talking about?

86
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,560
No, I'm talking about them.

87
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,200
I wrote in that they love when we troll ATP.

88
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,200
So there you go.

89
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,200
Oh, yeah, yeah.

90
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,200
Yeah, they got a they got a merch store.

91
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,200
So we can troll them.

92
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,280
Just just a little feedback.

93
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:58,440
So the robe situation, June, right?

94
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,440
It's happening.

95
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:00,440
All right.

96
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:01,440
People were tweeting at me.

97
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:02,440
It is.

98
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,440
Oh, I know.

99
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:04,440
I know.

100
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:05,440
People tweet like we didn't just do an update last week.

101
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,440
I felt like we did.

102
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:07,440
All right.

103
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:08,440
We did.

104
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:09,440
It was the first email out of the gate last week.

105
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:14,120
But but but maybe just for brevity, so you don't have to go back and listen.

106
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:16,120
Small batches are shipping out throughout this whole month.

107
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:20,880
And if everything stays on track by the end of June, everyone should have their robes.

108
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:24,720
I wouldn't be surprised if that slides a little bit because it just comes down to material

109
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:25,720
shortages.

110
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,640
But yeah, they are going out.

111
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:29,100
So do send us some pictures.

112
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:30,520
The first people to start getting their robes.

113
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:31,740
I want pictures.

114
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:36,000
And if you have a launch keyboard and you can hold it like a like a sword in your robe,

115
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
that would be great.

116
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
That would be amazing.

117
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,600
Anyways, we'll have more thoughts on the launch because it is an investment.

118
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,260
But no doubt about it.

119
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:45,520
The only thing I wish I could buy more of them.

120
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,520
I like it so much.

121
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:47,800
I wish I could afford more of them.

122
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:48,960
That's the only thing.

123
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:52,080
But I absolutely do feel like it was worth the money I spent.

124
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:56,160
And I have more thoughts, including I bought a thirty dollar mechanical keyboard to just

125
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:00,240
see what what is the difference, you know, of like one hundred and two hundred dollars

126
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,240
and change.

127
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:04,200
And I'll do that comparison later as well.

128
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:10,180
But honestly, there is a lot to get into for WWDC and right off the top, you know, big

129
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:12,760
elephant in the room, nada on the hardware.

130
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:18,240
No hardware announced, no M2, no 40 cores, no MacBook Pros.

131
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,560
Yeah, a lot of people were pissed.

132
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,560
A lot of you.

133
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,400
That was I was super surprised.

134
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,760
I thought the big win here was going to be the MacBook Pro.

135
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:31,560
For me, the tell was when WWDC keynote started and the Apple store was still online.

136
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:34,240
I knew right then and there I knew it.

137
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,240
Oh, dude.

138
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,440
Good call.

139
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:39,760
We did get a lot of platform feature updates.

140
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:45,880
And I watched this event from the perspective of a 20 year desktop Linux user.

141
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:51,160
And so I watch this stuff come in and I kind of compare it to what we have in the free

142
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,560
software community.

143
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:56,780
And then also, you know what, against Android and Windows and all that kind of stuff.

144
00:05:56,780 --> 00:05:59,960
And there's a few things that I think are fluff that we're just going to completely

145
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:04,560
avoid and we're going to just focus on things that I think are interesting, that Mike thinks

146
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:09,480
are interesting or our new technical innovations or our new big platform statements by Apple.

147
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:13,240
And so that means there's a lot in here, like the SharePlay API, which actually looks really

148
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,240
clever.

149
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,240
But I just don't have a lot to say about it.

150
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,480
You know, it's something we're going to have to test.

151
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:21,280
FaceTime coming to the Web and Android.

152
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,480
I mean, I guess that's kind of noteworthy.

153
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:26,880
Just one pandemic late on that one.

154
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:29,360
And of course, there was that big announcement up on stage.

155
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,320
We're going to take it all the way.

156
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:36,200
We're going to the standards bodies starting tomorrow and we're going to make FaceTime

157
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:38,440
an open industry standard.

158
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:39,760
Oh, my bad.

159
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:40,760
Sorry.

160
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:41,760
That was from a previous keynote.

161
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:47,840
No accident there, a little production there, but it is good to finally see it on the Web,

162
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:48,840
I suppose.

163
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:52,440
But let's talk about stuff that I think really matters and that's going to kind of start

164
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:57,820
for me with personally what matters to me and then we'll expand out, I think, to general

165
00:06:57,820 --> 00:06:58,820
industry.

166
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:00,600
And of course, the stuff that's going to matter to developers.

167
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:05,600
But right off the top, iOS is introducing something that Android tried in 2017 and is

168
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:10,400
now classifying notifications across a range of from passive to critical.

169
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:14,960
So you've got like Yelp recommendations and just general app spam.

170
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,440
That's a passive.

171
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:21,560
Active would be breaking news, team score, stocks, time sensitive, like a package delivery

172
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:22,560
is another category.

173
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,560
And then the last one is critical.

174
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:31,200
So like an amber alert style kind of alert and low, medium and high kind of settings.

175
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:36,680
There's four levels total that will be used together to, I guess, allow the operating

176
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:40,840
system to try to surface to the user the priority of notifications.

177
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:41,840
Is this what we wanted?

178
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:44,840
Is this what you expected for notification overhaul?

179
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:50,400
No, because I don't think it's going to work, which I this is one of those cases where I

180
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,800
feel really bad saying that because I want it to work.

181
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:53,800
Oh, for sure.

182
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:54,800
Yeah.

183
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:55,800
Yeah.

184
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:59,320
But I don't think this is going to work for the same reason it didn't work on Android.

185
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:03,160
You know why it's not going to work, Mike, is because it depends on the developers classifying

186
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,560
these notifications.

187
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:08,000
And they're all going to say their stuff is time sensitive or critical.

188
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,240
They're all going to abuse the system and then it'll be up to app review to policy it

189
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,440
and police it.

190
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:18,320
And it's just going to be slow and tedious and not nearly as functional as if they just

191
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:20,760
let the user go in and define a notification.

192
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:24,960
Like maybe the first time a notification comes up right then and there, I could push in on

193
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:28,820
it and define this type of notification and the operating system would remember it there

194
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:29,820
forward.

195
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:31,240
That would probably solve it over time.

196
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:38,200
Yeah, but just the sheer amount of manual labor you just signed app review up for.

197
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:43,840
Well, it's going to one way or another, they're going to have to enforce this new notification

198
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:46,040
classification.

199
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:49,960
You either make the users do it or you make the developers do it in the app review, police

200
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:50,960
it.

201
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:55,640
But here's why I really want it to be successful, because I'm going to just admit right off

202
00:08:55,640 --> 00:09:03,460
the top, they announced a feature that is platform wide that if they correctly implement,

203
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:07,480
I will switch to a Mac desktop for everything.

204
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:10,400
And I'm not kidding because it would change my life.

205
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:12,440
And it was this focus feature.

206
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:16,760
While an important part of finding focus is about reducing distraction from others, it's

207
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:20,700
also about drawing boundaries for yourself.

208
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:25,280
There may be periods in your day when you want to be totally focused on work, or maybe

209
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:28,720
you just want to be fully present with your family at dinner.

210
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:35,260
In these moments, you can use do not disturb or strike more of a balance with focus.

211
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:39,620
Focus is a new way to match your device to your current mindset.

212
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:43,760
With focus, all you have to do is choose what you want to focus on.

213
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:47,560
You can carve out time in your day for work or your personal life.

214
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:52,620
When setting up a focus, we use on device intelligence about your past activity to suggest

215
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:56,260
apps and people to allow notifications from.

216
00:09:56,260 --> 00:10:00,880
So if you're at work, you could choose to only be notified by coworkers or apps like

217
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:03,400
mail, calendar or slack.

218
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:07,400
You can even dedicate a page on your home screen to match your focus and organize your

219
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:13,080
apps and widgets in a way that reduces temptations by making only your work apps visible.

220
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:17,980
For your personal life, we'll suggest being notified only by friends and family or apps

221
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:19,680
like Calm.

222
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:23,840
And for a home screen to match, you can have your favorite entertainment apps like YouTube

223
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:27,080
or widgets for keeping up with your friends and family.

224
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:31,940
We'll even intelligently suggest using a focus based on your context, using different signals

225
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:34,560
like location or time of day.

226
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:37,500
Of course, you can create a custom focus too.

227
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:43,240
And when you use a focus on one device, it automatically sets on all your other devices.

228
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:48,560
That's huge, including the watch and the tablet and the damn phone.

229
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:53,880
I can tell you it is such it is such an annoying thing when I sit down to record or maybe I'm

230
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:58,720
an old man and I try to take a nap and I silence something or I set a status somewhere.

231
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:02,900
And the one or two devices I forget are the ones that always wake me up or always notify

232
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:04,720
me or interrupt the recording.

233
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:08,540
And then also to help with ADD in general, that could be fantastic.

234
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:14,880
And then ultimately, the use case that I would use this for on day one is when I am flying

235
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:22,640
my mother effing drone, that is the precise moment that everyone I know starts to contact

236
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:23,640
me.

237
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:27,500
And it could be like, so if I try to lock down Slack and Telegram and Discord, it'll

238
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:30,680
be all of a sudden Gmail smart alerts start coming up.

239
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:34,480
It doesn't matter what I'm doing, it doesn't matter who is just I will start getting all

240
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,800
of the notifications while I'm flying my drone.

241
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:40,600
And of course, on this stupid little iPhone mini, it takes up such a huge portion of the

242
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:44,740
screen that it actually obstructs my view of flying my drone.

243
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:49,760
And there have been times where maybe I was flying my drone for 20 minutes and I received

244
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:54,120
815 notifications and it's outrageous.

245
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:59,600
And even if I have the phone in D&D mode, I still get the drop down notifications unless

246
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:06,320
I completely disable them, I still get the drop downs and focus mode would take care

247
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,320
of that.

248
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:12,120
And on top of that, they're making a damn API available for third party messaging apps

249
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:17,960
like Telegram and Slack that can see my system wide status and reflect in those apps when

250
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,700
I'm in D&D mode.

251
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:21,040
That would change my life.

252
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:28,720
Yeah, I mean, I did not really take this seriously, but in the somewhat questionable case for

253
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:29,720
this actually works.

254
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:32,160
Yeah, yeah, it has to work.

255
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:37,840
But if I could just get a focus mode where only one or two people could even break through,

256
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:40,520
that would be massive for me.

257
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:46,880
And the idea that that would sink across the desktop, the watch, the tablet and the phone.

258
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:52,400
Oh, man, man, oh, man, that would be the ultimate for me because right now I have so many different

259
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:54,200
disparate OSes and devices.

260
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,600
It is a manual process for all of them.

261
00:12:56,600 --> 00:13:00,880
And that is the kind of workflow improvement, these kinds of things that would just really

262
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:05,880
entice me to switch over to the platform and say, I love you, Linux desktop, but this improves

263
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:07,440
my life.

264
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,680
And that to me is a big one.

265
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:14,520
I find it hard to believe you would really consider leaving the desktop.

266
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:19,360
Not completely, but as a daily driver, if they start to add features that allow me to

267
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:23,120
avoid notifications when I am in the middle of recording or in the middle of flying or

268
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:28,300
in the middle of editing, which is something I am almost always doing, oh, my God, it would

269
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:29,300
change my life.

270
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:33,320
It really is a source of stress and frustration for me, especially when I'm up there flying.

271
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:38,760
And it is so frustrating and stressful for me that I actually start to become religious

272
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:43,080
and suspect that there may be some kind of divine intervention going on just to screw

273
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:48,640
with me because I simply can't comprehend how else it is possible that I get so many

274
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:53,040
notifications and I hear from so many different people every time I'm flying my drone or every

275
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:56,920
time I'm trying to record and people that have worked with me for a while know I could

276
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:57,920
go all day.

277
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:58,920
No notifications.

278
00:13:58,920 --> 00:13:59,920
I sit down to record.

279
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:00,920
That's when they all come in.

280
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:04,680
And of course, it's on the one device that I didn't silence that particular time.

281
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:06,740
Oh, it gets me so fired up.

282
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:11,320
It really is it is like slow torture every single day of my life.

283
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:13,320
I hate notifications.

284
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:18,740
And because every application is constantly adding its own messaging platform, some days

285
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:22,940
just miraculously apps auto update and now they have a messaging feature and now I'm

286
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:24,720
getting notifications from them.

287
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:29,840
And that and as soon as there is a way for humans to contact me on a platform, I start

288
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:33,000
getting notifications.

289
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Gets me worked up.

290
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
God damn, dude.

291
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
All right.

292
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
I don't know.

293
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:42,200
So maybe maybe if it could if they could make that better, I might I might consider switching.

294
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:46,300
But I know what you and I were talking about before the big event was they really needed

295
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:48,520
to improve the iPad situation.

296
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:54,400
Oh, dude, dude, you have to go first because this is going to be another another rant.

297
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:59,840
So I think the area that was needed most obvious addressing was all of it.

298
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:00,840
Yeah.

299
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:02,720
I mean, it really all needed so much work.

300
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:03,720
Multitasking was one of them.

301
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:06,720
I don't even know if I could say it was the majority of where the work needed to be.

302
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:09,880
But we did see some updates in multitasking.

303
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:13,360
There is now a new multitasking menu.

304
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:18,640
In iPadOS 15, there's a new control that appears at the top of your apps.

305
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:21,480
Tapping on it reveals the multitasking menu.

306
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:26,280
From here, I can take an app full screen or work with two apps at the same time by creating

307
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:28,520
a split view or slide over.

308
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:32,840
I'll tap on the split view icon and the app slides to the edge of the screen, giving me

309
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:36,760
quick access to my home screen where I can select from any of my apps.

310
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:41,580
Essentially, they're taking the multitasking gestures and functionality that were obtuse

311
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:47,120
and hard to remember, and they're exposing them with a visual menu pop up that is now

312
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:52,920
going to be persistent, that that gives you actual like little indicators of where you're

313
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:55,560
actually going to be putting the app when you hit that button.

314
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:58,800
And then they're now combining that with a new shelf.

315
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:02,720
The new multi window shelf gives you quick access to all the open windows for that app.

316
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:07,080
So now you can have Safari with multiple tabs and multiple windows or any app.

317
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:12,280
You can have multiple windows for the apps now, and those windows will live in the shelf.

318
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:14,880
And then you can get to that at the bottom of the screen.

319
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:20,560
You know, when I'm on my iPad, I often think, you know what this needs?

320
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:26,160
This needs a shelf, like to put some some knickknacks on, you know, a couple like bobble

321
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:29,940
head guys, a couple, maybe some Donald Knuth books, right?

322
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:30,940
That's what this needs.

323
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:33,920
So you've already got your application switcher at the bottom of your screen.

324
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,600
Then you've got the dock at the bottom of the screen.

325
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,920
So clearly you needed a shelf at the bottom of the screen, too.

326
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:38,920
I'm not joking.

327
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:39,920
I think this is genius.

328
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:40,920
Really?

329
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:43,640
Oh, my next big product is a shelf.

330
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:44,640
Yeah.

331
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:45,640
For what?

332
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:46,640
For Linux?

333
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:47,640
For whatever it needs to be.

334
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:50,360
I mean, bring the shelf to Windows.

335
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:52,800
Listen, you bring me an application.

336
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:56,400
I will shelfify it, trademark pending on shelfify.

337
00:16:56,400 --> 00:17:01,400
They also added new keyboard navigation and shortcuts across the whole OS multitask.

338
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:09,160
It is good to see that iPad OS 14 is going to run on all the same iPads that 14 does.

339
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:12,960
So 15 and 14 run on the same set of iPads.

340
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:18,340
And I don't know, it just doesn't feel like enough to call this a pro platform still.

341
00:17:18,340 --> 00:17:21,440
Nothing really changed with how it handles external storage.

342
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:25,040
There's still no quote unquote pro way to load my own apps.

343
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:28,260
The multitasking features are going to have to be a wait and see.

344
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:31,200
There's no announced external monitor improvements.

345
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:35,320
We really just have a new set of iPad controls that are unique to the iPad that don't really

346
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:36,720
scale beyond that.

347
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:42,080
And it seems to me like iPad OS continues to be an excuse to take just baby steps.

348
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:45,600
You know, like a lot of the things they added to the iPad this year was stuff that the iPhone

349
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,640
got last year, like app library.

350
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:48,680
What are you talking about?

351
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:50,920
This is like Atlas spanning the world.

352
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:52,040
It's a shelf, man.

353
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:54,960
It's what you needed.

354
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,640
Linode dot com slash coder.

355
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:00,560
Go there to get one hundred dollars in credit and of course, support the show.

356
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:05,800
That's one hundred dollars in credit for 60 days on your new account.

357
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:07,840
Linode is our hosting provider of choice.

358
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:12,580
Everything, everything we've built in the last few years has been built on Linode.

359
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:16,080
Their infrastructure is solid, it's fast, it's flexible.

360
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:20,260
It lets you focus on your project and not the infrastructure.

361
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:25,760
Their pricing is extremely competitive, 30 to 50 percent cheaper than what you're going

362
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,960
to find at other big cloud providers.

363
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:29,240
But they're independently owned.

364
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:31,880
So you know that they have a long term plan.

365
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:36,160
They've been around since 2003 and they're not just like a fly by night that's been jacked

366
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:38,160
up with some VC funding.

367
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:40,440
You get 11 data centers to choose from.

368
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:42,860
Every single one of them is screaming fast.

369
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:47,000
Every service level, regardless if it's a five dollar rig or or maybe you've got some

370
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:53,280
fancy high end CPU or GPU compute rig where you're going to get the same great support.

371
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:57,680
Every single server comes with their 24 seven phone or ticket support.

372
00:18:57,680 --> 00:19:01,100
And every step of the way since 2003, Linode has asked themselves how they can make the

373
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:03,240
service better.

374
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:07,920
They've built on features that make a lot of sense like object storage or of course,

375
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:13,200
load balancers, centralized logging tools, Kubernetes and Terraform support.

376
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:19,040
All of those come together to make Linode super expandable and scalable to large business

377
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:23,280
needs, but totally approachable to a complete beginner, maybe somebody who just wants to

378
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:27,880
learn or maybe has a great idea and they just want to give it a spot on the Internet.

379
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:29,960
Start by going to Linode.com slash coder.

380
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:32,080
Get that one hundred dollars, 60 day credit.

381
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:34,360
And then you really have something to work with.

382
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:35,880
Try out Linode's dashboard.

383
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:37,900
See what their load balancers can do.

384
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:43,680
See how great it is for a small team or a large team to have access to these powerful

385
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:44,680
tools.

386
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:48,480
And unlike entry level hosting service providers that lock you into their platform, Linode

387
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:52,440
is going to give you full back end access to customize and control your server to fit

388
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:54,800
your needs when you need it.

389
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:56,500
So go to Linode.com slash coder.

390
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:57,500
Go there.

391
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:59,700
Get that one hundred dollars, 60 day credit towards your new account.

392
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:07,800
And of course, you support the Coder Radio program, Linode.com slash coder.

393
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:11,760
Well, Siri got some nice improvements and I'm not even kidding.

394
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:17,640
Y'all can shut up about Siri and just listen.

395
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:19,480
Offline voice processing.

396
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:20,480
Game changer.

397
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:21,480
Hang on.

398
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:22,480
Just listen.

399
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:23,480
Come on.

400
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:24,480
Come on.

401
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:25,480
Hey.

402
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:26,480
You have a sound clip for it.

403
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:27,480
Hey.

404
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:28,480
Oh, you're right.

405
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:29,480
Stay a while and listen.

406
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:30,480
There you go.

407
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,480
This is very solid for me.

408
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:36,480
I use Siri a lot to control my home assistant install at home and offline speech recognition

409
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:40,600
was like the real limiting factor for all of us because we like to go up in the hills

410
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:41,740
and stuff.

411
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:45,300
And on top of that, the new Siri voices are so much better than all the other smart tubes

412
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:49,640
that the new voices they rolled out are creepy good.

413
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:52,700
Siri gets a lot of crap, but I think it's better than the other assistants.

414
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:57,080
And now with local processing finally coming for a lot of basic voice commands, it's going

415
00:20:57,080 --> 00:21:00,720
to be fast as hell and work without Internet connection.

416
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:01,720
That's what's up.

417
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,240
I am very happy about this.

418
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:07,620
We cut every time they said HomePod mini and didn't even mention the HomePod, but I'll

419
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:08,620
take it.

420
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:09,620
I know.

421
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:10,620
I'm with you on that now.

422
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:11,620
Yeah.

423
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:13,320
I actually been thinking about trying to buy one more.

424
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:16,640
But then after watching the keynote today, Apple pretended like they never even made

425
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:17,640
the HomePod.

426
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:19,440
We don't know who you are, child.

427
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:20,440
Monterey.

428
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:27,760
Mac OS Monterey is here and got a name and they're calling it Mac OS 12, too.

429
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:31,760
So they are iterating the number now like they do with every iOS release.

430
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:34,800
They're now iterating every Mac OS release.

431
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:39,760
There was a feature that they kind of demoed during the Mac segment that people in the

432
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:42,800
chat room during the keynote thought you were really going to like.

433
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:45,040
It's called universal control.

434
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:46,640
This is really powerful.

435
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:51,760
With universal control, I can even drag and drop files between my devices.

436
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:57,680
I'm just going to take this drawing I finished on my iPad and drop it on the keynote on my

437
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:58,680
Mac.

438
00:21:58,680 --> 00:21:59,680
Awesome.

439
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:05,360
For our pros out there, universal control works with more than two devices.

440
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:09,160
So let's add this iMac into the mix.

441
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:15,880
Now I can use the trackpad on my MacBook to control my iMac as well.

442
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:16,880
What do you think?

443
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:23,400
One mouse on one device control multiple different Apple devices and you can drag and drop application

444
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:27,380
or a data application data between them.

445
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:28,480
Kind of a cool feature.

446
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,160
That's like synergy.

447
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:31,160
Yeah, I think it's pretty cool.

448
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:33,720
I mean, it's not earth shattering for my workflows.

449
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:37,080
Really I'm not going to use it, but I think it's cool.

450
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:41,220
I could see like more design type, you know, graphical people really having a good time

451
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:42,220
with it.

452
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:43,220
Yeah.

453
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:46,160
Or those situations where maybe you got to sign a document so you could send something

454
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:49,880
over to the iPad real quick, sign it there and then send it back to the Mac.

455
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:50,880
True.

456
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:51,880
True.

457
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:52,880
Yeah, it's cool.

458
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:56,600
It's not like I don't know if I would call it revolutionary or whatever you just said.

459
00:22:56,600 --> 00:23:02,240
It's an interesting payoff to adding mouse and trackpad support to the iPad and now they

460
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,240
can do this.

461
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:04,240
That's interesting.

462
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:09,240
It must require the same iCloud account and proximity to each other.

463
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:11,600
Some of these events, they haven't gone into more details yet.

464
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:13,160
Some we do have details about, some we don't.

465
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:16,360
And that one is a little obtuse.

466
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:22,320
And also now the Mac can be an AirPlay destination and shortcuts on the Mac are going to be the

467
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:23,320
new...

468
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:24,320
Automator.

469
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:25,600
Future of automation, they said.

470
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:26,600
Yeah.

471
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:27,600
The multi-year transition.

472
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:30,760
Again, this is where I think our developer audience is like, well, why can't I just write

473
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:33,760
a Python script or something, right?

474
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:38,040
But I think a lot of more like non-dev power users will actually like that.

475
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:42,920
Once it matures enough that it's, how can I say it?

476
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:45,240
Not trivial in what it can do.

477
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:49,420
And it needs to be widely adopted too, like Adobe would need to, and Microsoft would need

478
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:50,420
to adopt this.

479
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:55,300
Then it could be actually useful for larger selections of people.

480
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:59,600
It will also come, they said, with a large, rich library of pre-built shortcuts just for

481
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:00,600
the Mac.

482
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:03,760
Kind of implying to me that the iOS shortcuts will not work on the Mac.

483
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:08,020
And then they noted this, but just really quickly, they are introducing a low power

484
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:15,120
mode on the Mac, which is compatible with early 2016 and later MacBook Pros, and I assume

485
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,880
M1 MacBook Pros.

486
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:21,520
And according to Apple, low power mode on the Mac will reduce the system clock speed

487
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:25,040
and display brightness in order to extend your battery life even further.

488
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:28,120
I would imagine it also disables turbo boost.

489
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:32,100
Seems like if you've already got ridiculous battery life on the M1, and then you turn

490
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:37,200
on low power mode, what are you going to get, two days out of the thing?

491
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,320
You know, I will not criticize this one.

492
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:43,000
There is, remember, we're going to be back out in the world again doing conferences and

493
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
seeing clients.

494
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Oh, I think it's great.

495
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,520
Yeah, there's never enough battery life.

496
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:48,520
Just keep it up.

497
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:50,480
I think this is a baby step low power mode though.

498
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:55,320
I mean, again, I'm looking at this from a perspective of a Linux user thinking, I do

499
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:58,800
this now with TLP, but it's a very manual process.

500
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:04,200
But what would be nice with low power mode is kind of some kind of feedback system where

501
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:09,480
Dropbox could be told to stop syncing or whatever, you know, Slack and different apps.

502
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:11,760
Oh, no, no, that's easy.

503
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:16,800
You know, your applications directory, RMR, you know, whatever it is, Dropbox.app, yeah.

504
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:17,800
Heyo.

505
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:21,200
I mean, overall, pretty minor update to Mac OS.

506
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:25,600
Looks like most machines older than 2015 are not going to be supported with Monterey, with

507
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,840
the exception of the Trashcan.

508
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:29,000
So there you go.

509
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:33,440
Synced focus mode really could be the biggest feature for me, for Mac OS.

510
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:38,360
But there is some goodies in here for developers, including lots of new APIs.

511
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:41,980
They kind of made a point that they sort of have an API to go with every single thing

512
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:45,920
they announced today, which that's good to see.

513
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:50,040
One API that stuck out to me is the thing where you can scan an object and create an

514
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:51,040
AR 3D model.

515
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:54,360
I'm assuming they're using the same and I didn't get to dig into this because I ran

516
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:57,400
out of time, but I'm assuming they're using the same model class.

517
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:59,560
They use, you know, an AR kit, right?

518
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:01,560
I'm sure this is just an extension of AR kit.

519
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:02,560
Yep, you're right.

520
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:04,960
That is actually cool.

521
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:07,120
Two years ago, I had a project we were doing.

522
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:12,000
We had these like giant ass handheld like guns, quote unquote, but think about like

523
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,320
giant scanners at like Walmart.

524
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:20,680
And what they were is they 3D scanned objects and we were having to programmatically create

525
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:24,560
color OBJ files out of them or color STLs, I can't remember which.

526
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:27,520
But this is when I was doing a bunch of rust.

527
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:32,320
I talked about it briefly and the dream was, could we hack away to do this on iOS?

528
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:38,320
At the time, we just couldn't get the fidelity, but if this works as it seems, as they're

529
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:44,040
claiming it does, that's going to open up a lot of cool doors for like importing real

530
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:48,000
world AR models without having to spend a fortune because these scanners like five grand

531
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,000
a piece or something.

532
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:53,540
Yeah, in the state of the union, they demoed scanning a pastry and one of the things they've

533
00:26:53,540 --> 00:26:59,320
done that is not as easy as it sounds is they've also enabled scanning the top and the bottom

534
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:04,360
with figuring out the background to make it consistent so you can get a complete scanning

535
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:05,360
of the object.

536
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:09,380
And of course, they're using the LIDAR sensor to do all the depth sensing and all that kind

537
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:10,380
of stuff as well.

538
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:15,440
So basically, if you get something in decent lighting, you can get a very accurate, very

539
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:21,060
high resolution 3D model, even kind of like the feedback software they're using to show

540
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:24,680
you the progress of the scan is getting pretty high end.

541
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:28,460
So the AR stuff has gotten really advanced.

542
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:32,720
It's got to be building to something, but whatever it's building to was not even hinted

543
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:35,040
at in the keynote today.

544
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:38,180
No, time is still a factor here.

545
00:27:38,180 --> 00:27:43,640
The other, I think, big developer thing, although to their credit, by making it open source,

546
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:50,800
they also kind of kneecap themselves, Swift is getting some very big concurrency improvements

547
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:54,080
and a really nicer version of async await.

548
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:57,960
And if that means nothing to you, then you're not a Swift developer.

549
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:03,440
But Swift, it's one of those cases where like C sharp, for example, where all that async

550
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:09,440
await stuff really kind of got its mainstream footing, it was just like donking on Swift,

551
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:12,640
which I'm of course thrilled to see at any point.

552
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:13,640
It's good.

553
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:16,120
I mean, if you're working day to day in Swift, this is something you want to save you a bunch

554
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:21,120
of pain in the ass handling concurrency stuff that's annoying and fraught with bugs.

555
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:26,080
I did find their claim that, what was it, the thousand top apps or something are made

556
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:27,120
in Swift.

557
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:28,120
What does that mean?

558
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:34,160
Object capture and all of the APIs we've talked about today are built on this Swift programming

559
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:35,920
language.

560
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:41,000
Swift has made a huge impact on our app ecosystem and today, the majority of the top thousand

561
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,140
apps are built using Swift.

562
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:47,240
The majority of the top thousand apps are built with using Swift.

563
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:50,260
Objective C totally got the HomePod treatment.

564
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:51,260
Big time.

565
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:56,120
You know, they were all about, anytime they could mention something was built in Swift,

566
00:28:56,120 --> 00:29:00,040
which is anything they've recently built, they would mention it was built in Swift.

567
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:02,280
They wanted you to know it.

568
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:08,080
And Swift Playgrounds was pitched now as the way to make apps for the iPad.

569
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:10,240
I got a brief clip for that, too.

570
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:14,820
Swift Playgrounds is a great way to learn to code through a series of Apple design lesson

571
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:18,160
plans that are interactive and fun.

572
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:23,880
This year, we're taking it even further by adding the ability to build apps on iPad.

573
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:27,680
You build these apps with Swift UI, which makes development easy.

574
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:31,440
The code you write is immediately reflected in the live preview of your app.

575
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:34,720
This new project type even works with Xcode on Mac.

576
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:39,640
Swift Playgrounds now supports improved code completion, so you can just start typing and

577
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:42,160
quickly add the suggestion to your code.

578
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:46,800
You also have access to the whole library of UI components and the documentation to

579
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:47,800
go with it.

580
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:51,240
And if you're new to app development, you can go right to the App Store.

581
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:55,000
You can build an app on the iPad and submit it to the App Store.

582
00:29:55,000 --> 00:30:00,520
And they are now claiming it's an avenue to make apps on the iPad, on iOS.

583
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:01,520
Yeah.

584
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:02,520
I mean, so a couple of things.

585
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:04,040
Just taking a quick jump back.

586
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:08,840
I'm still going to challenge that Swift claim, only because technically when you build like

587
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:14,080
an Ionic or a Xamarin app, there's some Swift running around in their Objective-C, right?

588
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:15,360
So I don't know.

589
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:17,000
I mean, are they pure Swift?

590
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,000
Whatever.

591
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,000
That's just me hitting Swift.

592
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Right.

593
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,880
I don't think this is for professional developers, this iPad thing, right?

594
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:23,880
No.

595
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:24,880
No.

596
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:25,880
This is for like Dylan and Reese and whatever.

597
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:26,880
Yes.

598
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:28,600
Ostensibly, that's how they're pitching it.

599
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:32,840
But what I think it really is, and I think they showed their cards in this keynote, is

600
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:41,000
it is their baby steps to getting Xcode and Swift application development on iOS.

601
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:47,080
And because they don't have the resources or the team dedication or maybe the mandate

602
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:53,400
to just build a full-fledged Xcode for iOS, they seem to be instead taking the iMovie

603
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:59,000
to Final Cut approach where they are doing baby steps as something that's just casual

604
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,000
guys.

605
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,640
It's just for casual people.

606
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:08,760
And then one day, you know, it's WWDC, maybe it's 2025, and they announce Xcode for iOS,

607
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:11,880
which is just a souped up version of Swift Playgrounds.

608
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:17,240
And oh, by the way, it lets you write Swift applications and build them right here on

609
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:18,240
iOS.

610
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:19,240
That's got to be where they're going with this.

611
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:20,240
Yeah.

612
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:25,600
This whole thing, just in general, the whole presentation left me wondering, does macOS

613
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:29,440
have five years of like main focus?

614
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:32,320
And maybe it's not even the main focus now, right?

615
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:38,840
But will we seriously have, maybe not devs, but professional business people, folks like

616
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:42,800
that, like legitimately working full time on iPads?

617
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:46,760
Well, Xcode Cloud could make that a little bit easier.

618
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:52,280
That was something they announced that pretty, pretty significantly, like they get dedicated

619
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:54,600
a lot of time to Xcode Cloud.

620
00:31:54,600 --> 00:32:00,360
And then in the State of the Union, they dedicated 15 minutes to Xcode Cloud.

621
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:02,920
And here's the short version of the announcement.

622
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:06,720
There's something else we're doing this year, and it's going to take app development to

623
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,480
the next level.

624
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:12,940
It integrates the cloud with our developer tools in a powerful new way.

625
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:16,040
And it's called Xcode Cloud.

626
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:21,840
Today, creating an app requires multiple steps, building, testing, and delivery, and a number

627
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:23,680
of different tools.

628
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:28,280
Xcode Cloud simplifies the workflow by bringing everything together.

629
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:33,080
So as an individual developer, you can focus your energy on being creative and development

630
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:36,160
teams can collaborate more effectively.

631
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:37,840
Here's how it works.

632
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:42,560
When you commit a change to your code, Xcode Cloud can automatically build the app.

633
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:46,280
Because it's built in the cloud, your Mac is free for other tasks.

634
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:51,320
And for teams, everyone can see if the change introduces errors so everyone can find and

635
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:54,000
fix issues faster.

636
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:58,500
Then Xcode Cloud runs your automated tests in parallel, so they complete in a fraction

637
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:04,680
of the time, even as they simulate running on every kind of Apple device and platform.

638
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:10,120
The test results are displayed in Xcode, so you can easily see what worked and fix what

639
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:11,120
didn't.

640
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:16,440
Finally, once the app passes all its tests, Xcode Cloud can automatically distribute it

641
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:21,200
to the testers on your team, and even external beta testers with TestFlight.

642
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:25,680
Hey, with TestFlight, and they also announced TestFlight is coming to the Mac, which I think

643
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:26,680
you called.

644
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:31,740
What do you think with Xcode Cloud, maybe that's how they bring full application development

645
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:32,740
to the iPad?

646
00:33:32,740 --> 00:33:36,040
Yeah, I mean, that would be a good way to get around some of the limitations of iOS,

647
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:40,920
although I do wonder if they actually would have iPad with those limitations, but hey.

648
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:45,080
Ironically, you still need a Mac to use this right now because it requires Xcode to use

649
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:46,080
Xcode Cloud.

650
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:51,360
You manage Xcode Cloud using the local Xcode 13 on your Mac.

651
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:54,600
Yeah, but this is, I mean, you could see where this is going, right?

652
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:55,600
Oh, yeah.

653
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,240
They're just being cautious as they always are.

654
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:58,240
Yeah.

655
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:59,720
Like I sort of had a different take than you, I guess.

656
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:04,080
I was thinking that, oh, wow, Apple finally discovered continuous integration.

657
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:08,200
And like all developers who discover testing and continuous integration for the first time,

658
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:09,200
they're zealots.

659
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:10,200
Yeah.

660
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:12,360
I also noticed they intend to charge for this service.

661
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:20,160
And if their pricing scheme is as it is for most of their products and services, I'm going

662
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:26,680
to stick very happily with my GitLab pipelines because it's free and on my own hardware.

663
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:28,840
Well, consider this.

664
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:30,240
Here's going to be Apple's angle.

665
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:31,240
Riddle me this, Batman.

666
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:32,240
Go ahead.

667
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:37,600
Number one, if you're paying for any Mac mini colo hosting, so that way you could do the

668
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:43,240
code signing on non-Macs, you can now cancel that because this is going to do code signing

669
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:44,360
in the cloud.

670
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:49,800
Also, if you are buying extra devices for compatibility testing, you can stop buying

671
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:55,200
those thousand dollar devices because this will run in parallel across all supported

672
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:56,240
Apple devices.

673
00:34:56,240 --> 00:35:01,960
They will simulate every Apple device in the cloud and test it and give you results back

674
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:02,960
in xCloud.

675
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:06,520
So you can save money on buying iDevices.

676
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:11,160
And because they're doing the compiling in the cloud, you can now start buying cheap

677
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:15,820
Macs that don't have high end processors in them because the cloud's doing the build and

678
00:35:15,820 --> 00:35:19,240
your iOS devices will be able to do the build in the cloud.

679
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:21,400
So you can buy cheaper iOS devices.

680
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:25,580
So you add it up over the next five to 10 years and you're actually saving thousands

681
00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:28,400
of dollars potentially by using xCode Cloud.

682
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:34,760
Yeah, and I should be fair that my whole GitLab pipelines example is problematic for iOS development,

683
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:35,760
right?

684
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:37,580
Or at least for native iOS development.

685
00:35:37,580 --> 00:35:42,160
The trick is going to be tying in whatever kind of pipeline you have now into this because

686
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:45,080
this will be how you distribute it to your Apple users who are going to test it on the

687
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:46,080
Apple platforms.

688
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:47,080
Likely.

689
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:48,080
All right.

690
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:49,080
All right.

691
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:50,080
You're changing my mind a little bit.

692
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:52,920
I guess it depends on like how ridiculous the pricing is going to be for this.

693
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:53,920
Yeah, we'll see.

694
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:59,820
So it's a limited beta right now and they're letting some developers in for free and they're

695
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:03,760
going to have full pricing and other details this fall.

696
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:07,040
But right now it sounds like a slow rollout to me.

697
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:11,520
Imagine if this service actually developed into something useful and it meant in a few

698
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:15,820
years from now you could be kicking off builds, doing code signing and distributing testers

699
00:36:15,820 --> 00:36:17,920
from a Linux desktop.

700
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:21,840
Maybe or maybe you don't even need a Mac anymore, like you could manage all that stuff from

701
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:25,440
some sort of X cloud for your iPad and you don't even need a Mac desktop.

702
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:29,680
Well, I got to tell you, if they really end up deprecating the Mac, I think that's going

703
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:33,900
to be an interesting opportunity for that awesome, awesome Linux distribution known

704
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:37,480
as Windows 10.

705
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:39,560
Datadog.com slash Coder Radio.

706
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:44,220
Now you can analyze code level performance across your environment and troubleshoot issues

707
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:47,280
faster than ever with Datadog.

708
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:51,560
Datadog has so many features that enable you and your team to communicate and analyze your

709
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:53,440
entire infrastructure quickly.

710
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:55,400
I love their continuous profiler.

711
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:59,720
It automatically collects profiles from your production servers all the time so you can

712
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:03,460
analyze any of your data quickly with minimal overhead.

713
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:07,720
You get a unified picture of your environment by correlating your code performance with

714
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:12,920
your other monitoring data like server, metal performance, application performance, network

715
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:17,460
performance, all brought into live, beautiful dashboards.

716
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:21,600
You got to go to Datadog.com slash Coder Radio just to see these dashboards and they have

717
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:26,780
over 450 integrations with different enterprise level applications so you can bring tracing

718
00:37:26,780 --> 00:37:31,520
and log management and continuous profiler to those products in the Datadog platform

719
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:32,520
as well.

720
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:37,060
Datadog really gives you the tools so you can pinpoint root causes of issues faster

721
00:37:37,060 --> 00:37:41,280
than ever and communicate them with your entire team visually.

722
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:44,840
And of course, they have a bunch of smart alerts and all kinds of features that help

723
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:48,160
you reach more uptime and availability than ever.

728
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:14,480
That's a great deal and you can get started at Datadog.com slash Coder Radio.

729
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:19,180
So there was a few changes in App Store policy and of course, there was some things that

730
00:38:19,180 --> 00:38:20,180
were Sherlocked.

731
00:38:20,180 --> 00:38:23,140
I think maybe we should wrap up with some of that in our thoughts.

732
00:38:23,140 --> 00:38:27,120
They are giving developers the ability to do A-B testing of icons and screenshots, blah,

733
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:28,300
blah, blah, blah.

734
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:29,560
Who really cares?

735
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:35,100
What really matters is the updated contracts and policies and app review guidelines that

736
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:40,460
now state that developers who need to can appeal an app rejection when they believe

737
00:38:40,460 --> 00:38:45,860
their app was rejected due to unfair treatment by the app review team, including political

738
00:38:45,860 --> 00:38:48,640
bias or other forms of bias.

739
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:52,960
What could go wrong?

740
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:57,500
Apple just basically threw their entire review team under the bus because everyone's going

741
00:38:57,500 --> 00:39:01,480
to claim some kind of bias now when their app gets removed.

742
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:02,480
Some kind of bias, yeah.

743
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:06,840
It's going to be, it's going to be, well, I'm a Mets fan, you're a Yankees fan.

744
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:11,700
So obviously you can't, yeah, this is terrible, I don't, I don't understand.

745
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:16,320
I mean, it was obvious, I think going in that they weren't going to do anything for developers

746
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:21,620
only because they have how many lawsuits going on right now and the threat of federal regulations.

747
00:39:21,620 --> 00:39:25,380
They would be admitting fault almost if they, if they would be admitting, it would be crazy.

748
00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:28,700
I mean, I'm sure they're, they're head of legal counsel would like slapped Tim Cook

749
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:29,700
in the face, right?

750
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:31,580
Like, what are you doing?

751
00:39:31,580 --> 00:39:32,580
It's weird, right?

752
00:39:32,580 --> 00:39:35,380
Cause years ago I would come on here and rant and be like super radical about like the App

753
00:39:35,380 --> 00:39:36,380
Store.

754
00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:39,940
And then I'm like, how about you just allow people another payment processing method?

755
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:40,940
Yeah.

756
00:39:40,940 --> 00:39:44,060
And like, I think, I think that's, and I think that's reasonable and probably the most you'd

757
00:39:44,060 --> 00:39:45,580
ever get.

758
00:39:45,580 --> 00:39:51,900
So I don't know, having said that as a dev myself who may or may not have something coming,

759
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:55,720
coming on an iOS in a few months, I'm still going to use their payment processing cause

760
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:56,720
it's so easy.

761
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:58,860
Well, yeah, I would, you would use both, right?

762
00:39:58,860 --> 00:39:59,860
You could use Stripe.

763
00:39:59,860 --> 00:40:04,020
I think they could reasonably require you to use both, right?

764
00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:09,100
The other big thing, just on requirements, any app that allows account creation must

765
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:11,660
now within the app allow account deletion.

766
00:40:11,660 --> 00:40:12,660
Yeah.

767
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:16,160
That's, that's, that's a thing.

768
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:21,260
There's a lot of businesses and a lot of developers who are not going to be particularly happy

769
00:40:21,260 --> 00:40:22,260
about that.

770
00:40:22,260 --> 00:40:23,260
Yeah.

771
00:40:23,260 --> 00:40:25,980
Maybe not in these like small guys like me who, fine, you want to delete your account,

772
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:26,980
go ahead.

773
00:40:26,980 --> 00:40:30,740
But like, you know, you're, let's not call them social media companies of the world.

774
00:40:30,740 --> 00:40:31,740
Yeah.

775
00:40:31,740 --> 00:40:36,660
So developers can now report other developers that they think are, you know, doing something

776
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:37,660
wrong.

777
00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:38,660
That's amazing.

778
00:40:38,660 --> 00:40:39,660
Yeah.

779
00:40:39,660 --> 00:40:41,140
That's not, that's, that's not going to get abused.

780
00:40:41,140 --> 00:40:45,360
There's also new rules that say your identity information needs to be accurate and up to

781
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:48,740
date at all times, or else they can pull your app.

782
00:40:48,740 --> 00:40:52,980
And also Apple clarified that they can determine if your app does not provide adequate quote

783
00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:57,220
utility, it may not be accepted on the app store at all.

784
00:40:57,220 --> 00:40:59,380
So that was already a rule though.

785
00:40:59,380 --> 00:41:00,380
Yeah.

786
00:41:00,380 --> 00:41:03,660
And Apple clarified that further to make it more explicit.

787
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:04,660
I never thought that.

788
00:41:04,660 --> 00:41:08,020
I mean, that rule was kind of like, I just love that they just determined the utility

789
00:41:08,020 --> 00:41:12,540
of an app, but yet fart apps and millions of flashlight apps make it on the app store.

790
00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:13,540
I guess you're right.

791
00:41:13,540 --> 00:41:17,120
I mean, I used to do apps for like restaurants way back in the day and it was always like

792
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:21,700
problematic because they really just wanted you to be able to like look at their menu

793
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:23,980
and call them.

794
00:41:23,980 --> 00:41:26,940
This is before the days of DoorDash and all that stuff.

795
00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:29,500
Those probably wouldn't and shouldn't pass the utility test.

796
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:30,820
I would think.

797
00:41:30,820 --> 00:41:31,820
Sherlocked.

798
00:41:31,820 --> 00:41:33,740
Well, we got a big one.

799
00:41:33,740 --> 00:41:35,920
Here's a big category.

800
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:40,660
Authenticator apps like Authy and Google Authenticator got Sherlocked because iOS 15 includes a built-in

801
00:41:40,660 --> 00:41:44,340
password authenticator with autofill for tokens.

802
00:41:44,340 --> 00:41:46,880
So those have been Sherlocked.

803
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:53,100
The Exif metadata app that was called, I can't remember the name, I can't remember the name,

804
00:41:53,100 --> 00:41:54,940
but it was Apple Sherlocked that app.

805
00:41:54,940 --> 00:41:57,020
It was pretty well known app.

806
00:41:57,020 --> 00:42:05,380
And most casual VPNs have been Sherlocked because Apple is building in private relay into iCloud

807
00:42:05,380 --> 00:42:10,260
and Safari that is probably just going to get used by most people that are just worried

808
00:42:10,260 --> 00:42:12,140
about the typical coffee shop traffic.

809
00:42:12,140 --> 00:42:15,100
I mean, those are just some of the apps I noticed they got Sherlocked.

810
00:42:15,100 --> 00:42:18,620
But when you go on Twitter and you search for Sherlocked, there's a lot more developers

811
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:24,020
that are moaning about their apps getting consumed into iOS 15.

812
00:42:24,020 --> 00:42:25,020
Yeah.

813
00:42:25,020 --> 00:42:29,100
This is, I mean, I put something snarky on it before.

814
00:42:29,100 --> 00:42:33,740
This felt like Apple was really interested in one third party developer in particular.

815
00:42:33,740 --> 00:42:38,660
Unity got a mention, you know, some engines got a mention up on stage, but there was hardly

816
00:42:38,660 --> 00:42:42,460
any featuring of third party developers at all or their apps.

817
00:42:42,460 --> 00:42:43,460
It was awkward.

818
00:42:43,460 --> 00:42:45,540
It was all about Apple.

819
00:42:45,540 --> 00:42:50,660
I know it's their keynote, but traditionally there is app demos and they're, you know,

820
00:42:50,660 --> 00:42:54,780
not always great, but it seems like this video format would actually be the perfect format

821
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:58,460
to do an app demo by a third party developer because you could cut it down and make them

822
00:42:58,460 --> 00:43:00,660
take multiple takes to actually make it interesting.

823
00:43:00,660 --> 00:43:01,660
Yeah.

824
00:43:01,660 --> 00:43:04,940
And they just completely just didn't even bother, even though a lot of the COVID restrictions

825
00:43:04,940 --> 00:43:10,020
have loosened up and now they have people in the same room together in the videos.

826
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:11,020
They still didn't bother.

827
00:43:11,020 --> 00:43:12,980
It was all Apple.

828
00:43:12,980 --> 00:43:13,980
You know what, Mike?

829
00:43:13,980 --> 00:43:19,100
None of it really deserved a nearly two hour keynote or an hour and 50 minute, whatever

830
00:43:19,100 --> 00:43:20,100
it was.

831
00:43:20,100 --> 00:43:24,860
All of the stuff that got announced could just be WWDC videos.

832
00:43:24,860 --> 00:43:27,100
There really wasn't any blow away features.

833
00:43:27,100 --> 00:43:28,100
The pacing was weird.

834
00:43:28,100 --> 00:43:32,020
They spend a bizarre amount of time on health, and I guess they've kind of decided they don't

835
00:43:32,020 --> 00:43:37,340
need to go so silly with the transitions anymore because the kind of overall production of

836
00:43:37,340 --> 00:43:40,620
the video was toned way down as well.

837
00:43:40,620 --> 00:43:42,900
It wasn't as much of a spectacle to watch.

838
00:43:42,900 --> 00:43:47,660
So not only was it not very compelling announcements, we didn't cover a lot of them because they

839
00:43:47,660 --> 00:43:51,280
just aren't very compelling or useful to our audience in our estimation.

840
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:55,580
And then on top of it, the production quality didn't seem as good as it was, and it seems

841
00:43:55,580 --> 00:43:57,540
somewhat self obsessed.

842
00:43:57,540 --> 00:44:03,940
So do you think that's a reflection on their general feeling about third party developers?

843
00:44:03,940 --> 00:44:12,100
I think you could interpret it that way, but I suspect a more simpler cause is what is

844
00:44:12,100 --> 00:44:13,740
really at play here.

845
00:44:13,740 --> 00:44:21,940
I think, and Apple made inference to this, these virtual keynotes are getting so many

846
00:44:21,940 --> 00:44:24,060
more views.

847
00:44:24,060 --> 00:44:27,880
I think they said something that was like a hundred and something million views.

848
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:35,780
We're talking just like way beyond the crowd that they used to focus at WWDC in the past.

849
00:44:35,780 --> 00:44:40,780
And I think that means they've gone to more of a general public pitch, and they're not

850
00:44:40,780 --> 00:44:46,500
niching down on the geeky stuff as much, so that means less time talking about developers,

851
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:51,260
less time talking about how APIs are going to work, and more time talking about platform

852
00:44:51,260 --> 00:44:57,020
features and software features that are appealing to more people, just because of the broad

853
00:44:57,020 --> 00:45:00,500
scope of people that are watching these keynotes now.

854
00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:05,580
The State of the Union kind of covered the same stuff, but much more technical, and it

855
00:45:05,580 --> 00:45:07,460
started with Xcode.

856
00:45:07,460 --> 00:45:12,540
I kind of didn't feel like this was really a developer conference, and I don't know what

857
00:45:12,540 --> 00:45:13,540
to make of that.

858
00:45:13,540 --> 00:45:17,660
Like part of me is like, well, I'm sure they had other plans, but all the legal problems,

859
00:45:17,660 --> 00:45:20,540
they may be just like, you know.

860
00:45:20,540 --> 00:45:25,020
And maybe they had hardware plans, but the chip shortage, it's slowing them down a little

861
00:45:25,020 --> 00:45:26,020
bit.

862
00:45:26,020 --> 00:45:29,420
Yeah, I read somebody had a take, I think it was maybe Miguel de Acasa, that was super

863
00:45:29,420 --> 00:45:31,460
interesting to me.

864
00:45:31,460 --> 00:45:36,080
Maybe they didn't release any new hardware because they couldn't hit the, or rather breach

865
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:39,180
the 16 gig barrier on the M1 right now.

866
00:45:39,180 --> 00:45:40,180
That'd be interesting.

867
00:45:40,180 --> 00:45:45,380
There's a lot of leaks about the new Apple silicon that's in the works.

868
00:45:45,380 --> 00:45:50,820
So I don't know, I bet they got to have something in the works already.

869
00:45:50,820 --> 00:45:52,620
It just isn't ready yet.

870
00:45:52,620 --> 00:45:57,580
Either way, this is why you don't get so worked up about the rumors.

871
00:45:57,580 --> 00:46:03,460
You and I, we talk about what's out or what's announced more than we ever talk about like

872
00:46:03,460 --> 00:46:08,780
the specific nitty gritty rumors in most cases because it just sometimes never materializes.

873
00:46:08,780 --> 00:46:13,060
And when you're buying for the Apple platform, you just got to, you got to plan for what's

874
00:46:13,060 --> 00:46:17,640
available today and you shouldn't buy something hoping that it'll do something it doesn't

875
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:18,640
do today.

876
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:23,540
Like people that bought the iPad M1, the new iPad pro, hoping that Apple was going to do

877
00:46:23,540 --> 00:46:26,660
something to justify 16 gigs of RAM in that thing.

878
00:46:26,660 --> 00:46:28,660
I don't think they answered that.

879
00:46:28,660 --> 00:46:32,420
I think you, if you bought your iPad pro hoping that it was going to get more useful with

880
00:46:32,420 --> 00:46:40,380
iOS 15, it got moderately more useful, but you didn't get $500 more useful, right?

881
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:44,220
And so that's, that's the, that's the gotcha with the Apple platform is you got to kind

882
00:46:44,220 --> 00:46:46,620
of plan for what they've, what they've announced today.

883
00:46:46,620 --> 00:46:49,860
And you know, some of the new features and some of the new things they won't even tell

884
00:46:49,860 --> 00:46:52,500
you until they introduce the new hardware that supports them.

885
00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:53,660
So what do you, what do you think?

886
00:46:53,660 --> 00:46:56,500
Is this a win or a loss for Apple in WWDC?

887
00:46:56,500 --> 00:46:59,460
I mean, it's a boring WWDC.

888
00:46:59,460 --> 00:47:04,900
It's a nice platform update for users as the Linux observer looking in at this event.

889
00:47:04,900 --> 00:47:10,440
I say to myself, I'd really like, really like my free software platforms to have something

890
00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:11,820
like share play.

891
00:47:11,820 --> 00:47:14,860
I'd really like to have something like the focus mode.

892
00:47:14,860 --> 00:47:18,740
I think it would be pretty great to have some of these features built into my OS that have

893
00:47:18,740 --> 00:47:19,740
been Sherlocked.

894
00:47:19,740 --> 00:47:21,120
I have to be honest with you.

895
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:22,660
Some of this stuff is nice.

896
00:47:22,660 --> 00:47:27,260
The synergy KVM across multiple devices thing.

897
00:47:27,260 --> 00:47:30,380
I think it'd be so cool if plasma built that in.

898
00:47:30,380 --> 00:47:34,540
It seems like a killer feature for plasma desktop, but there's nobody really driving

899
00:47:34,540 --> 00:47:35,780
that kind of stuff.

900
00:47:35,780 --> 00:47:41,060
And ultimately the Siri changes with offline transcription and offline voice recognition

901
00:47:41,060 --> 00:47:44,860
are going to be things that I use on a daily basis when I'm traveling with my family.

902
00:47:44,860 --> 00:47:49,260
So this stuff for me, it makes the Apple platform more appealing to me.

903
00:47:49,260 --> 00:47:55,740
There just isn't hardware right now that kind of fits my use case that, you know, I'm, I'm,

904
00:47:55,740 --> 00:48:01,380
I'm not always pushing my machines, but when I do push them, I want something that's more

905
00:48:01,380 --> 00:48:03,500
capable than what Apple currently offers.

906
00:48:03,500 --> 00:48:06,020
And they didn't solve that problem for me today.

907
00:48:06,020 --> 00:48:07,500
So I saved myself some money.

908
00:48:07,500 --> 00:48:12,820
I don't buy any hardware and I, I remain a satisfied Linux user today, but looking over

909
00:48:12,820 --> 00:48:17,580
my shoulder going, God, some of that stuff, I mean, like I got into earlier in the show

910
00:48:17,580 --> 00:48:20,180
could really make a quality of life improvement for me.

911
00:48:20,180 --> 00:48:22,760
The betas are going out right now for developers.

912
00:48:22,760 --> 00:48:27,540
If you are signed up and you've paid the hundred dollars, well, you get rewarded by getting

913
00:48:27,540 --> 00:48:29,820
access to the betas right now.

914
00:48:29,820 --> 00:48:34,100
And then the public gets a free betas next month.

915
00:48:34,100 --> 00:48:39,020
And then the final versions will release in the fall and we'll have links to a bunch of

916
00:48:39,020 --> 00:48:41,780
this stuff in the show notes if you guys want to read more.

917
00:48:41,780 --> 00:48:44,380
But what about you, Mr. Dominic, does it change anything for you?

918
00:48:44,380 --> 00:48:46,740
Does it make you want to make an app?

919
00:48:46,740 --> 00:48:49,420
Does it make you a satisfied Apple user?

920
00:48:49,420 --> 00:48:50,420
No changes.

921
00:48:50,420 --> 00:48:54,220
You're kind of swaying me on that, on that notification stuff.

922
00:48:54,220 --> 00:48:57,860
If that actually works, I'm a little, I'm still skeptical, but I see your point.

923
00:48:57,860 --> 00:48:58,860
Yeah.

924
00:48:58,860 --> 00:48:59,860
Yeah.

925
00:48:59,860 --> 00:49:06,500
I, I have some long-term concerns about the future of Mac OS relative to iPad, but that

926
00:49:06,500 --> 00:49:09,060
always seems like it's five years out and who knows, right?

927
00:49:09,060 --> 00:49:10,060
Yeah.

928
00:49:10,060 --> 00:49:13,460
And they're moving the iPad so slow that if it is coming for the Mac, you're going to

929
00:49:13,460 --> 00:49:17,220
see it two, three years ahead of time because it's going to take them that long just to

930
00:49:17,220 --> 00:49:19,900
finally finish the job.

931
00:49:19,900 --> 00:49:21,300
That's really sad.

932
00:49:21,300 --> 00:49:26,260
You know, I mean, they build these, I mean the display and the M1 chip and that tiny

933
00:49:26,260 --> 00:49:31,460
little iPad and they really just did nothing to really take advantage of it.

934
00:49:31,460 --> 00:49:32,460
We'll see.

935
00:49:32,460 --> 00:49:33,460
Maybe I'm wrong.

936
00:49:33,460 --> 00:49:35,220
Maybe I should try out the multitasking stuff.

937
00:49:35,220 --> 00:49:36,520
Thanks to our QA team.
