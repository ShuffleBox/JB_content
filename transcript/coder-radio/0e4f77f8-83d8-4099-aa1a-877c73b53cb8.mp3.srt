00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
This is Koda Radio, episode 355 for April 29th, 2019.

2
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Hello, and welcome to Koda Radio, Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show that takes a pragmatic look at the art and business, software development, and related technologies.

3
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
My name is Wes, and I'm joined once again by Mr. Michael Dominic. Welcome to the show.

4
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Well, a wubba dub dub and a hippity hop. Happy Koda Radio to you, Mr. Payne.

5
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Oh, I'm always happy to be there. And you know, I'm glad I'm here today because we got a lot to talk about.

6
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
This is a thick, juicy beyond burger of a show.

7
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:12,000
And you know, a lot of the stuff that we find actually, well, sure, sometimes we find it, you know, whatever Mike drags into the show.

8
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Oh, but many of those things, well, actually, they come from you, our wonderful audience.

9
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:24,000
If you go to our website, Koda.show, Koda.show slash contact, there's a contact form.

10
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,000
You just write it in. You can be anonymous if you want. You can tell us your name. Let us know what you think.

11
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
It just helps us make a better show. And sometimes it gives us great stuff to talk about.

12
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:40,000
So I was thinking today, let's start off with some feedback. All right, so this one's, this one's for me.

13
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Tom wrote in to talk about in a recent episode, we were talking about Chrome OS and Windows. Actually, it was 353 a week with WSL.

14
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
When Mike, you were telling me all about your recent adventures over in the subsystem.

15
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:00,000
And we were kind of pondering things about like, what does this mean for desktop Linux? And what about Chrome OS?

16
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:09,000
And Tom wrote in, Wes, it hurt me when you said that there is little difference between Windows and Chrome OS.

17
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:17,000
He breaks it down for us. Chrome OS is open source versus closed Windows. Free versus paid.

18
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,000
An open standards based platform, meaning the web here, versus proprietary.

19
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:29,000
No bloatware versus tons of bloat. And no ads versus some small ads in Windows.

20
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Small.

21
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Small, yeah. That's up to the observer perhaps.

22
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Yeah.

23
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
And your DPI.

24
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Spam is in the eye of the beholder. But keep going.

25
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:48,000
And finally, Chrome OS is Linux. So although Google's version comes with telemetry, just like Windows, Tom notes,

26
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:56,000
people are free to avoid that by building their own. So we have things like Cloud Ready, which is excellent, in my opinion.

27
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
And you know what? I think I think Tom's pretty much spot on here.

28
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:06,000
There are ways in which I think about them in the same context, just in that they come from this big company and have been bundled and stuff.

29
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,000
And, you know, you might not necessarily be able to build the exact version that gets configured and shipped on your machine.

30
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:18,000
But there are still a lot of differences as platforms, especially when you compare it to the closed world of Windows.

31
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,000
And while they both might let you run Linux apps, they're obviously doing it in a very different way.

32
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Sure. I mean, Wes, this was directed at you, so...

33
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Chime in. Come on. The water's fine.

34
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Can I say a pox on both your houses?

35
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I think you just did.

36
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Yeah. I more agree with you, Wes, than I do the writer. But yeah, you both suck.

37
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Just go buy like a XPS or like a Galago or something. I don't know if you want to run Linux, run Linux.

38
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I've never, you can ask Chris, in years of this show, I've always been kind of like skeptical of Chrome OS,

39
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:07,000
especially when they added the sort of ability to run and... Was it Android apps or Linux apps first? I can't remember.

40
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Android, then like regular...

41
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
It was Android, then like devs, right?

42
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I believe so, yeah.

43
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
But it's basically dev packages, right?

44
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I mean, they are just running Linux applications. You know, I haven't actually played around with how the packaging works.

45
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:27,000
So full disclosure here, I'm very ignorant of Chrome OS. I had a sales guy who I bought a Chromebook when they first came out.

46
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Like, we're talking six years ago, seven years ago. Crap, we're talking like eight years ago.

47
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:44,000
And he had it for two months, and then I just like bought him a Surface because it just wasn't good enough, right?

48
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Yeah, it just wasn't meeting your needs. Overly restricted, maybe?

49
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Yeah, like he needed... I hate to use the 90s term, but he needed multimedia functionality that at the time,

50
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:02,000
remember, we're going back like seven to eight years here, wasn't exactly possible.

51
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I will give Chrome OS one thing in the demos I've seen, it is a lot better than it used to be, right?

52
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Just as web apps are better than they used to be.

53
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:20,000
But I don't know what to say, Wes. I mean, at your shop over there, are they running a lot of Chrome OS?

54
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:30,000
No, not that I'm aware of. It seems like its main inroads have just been in education, schools, maybe some sort of enterprise-like casual handout use.

55
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Yeah, at the Mad Botter, we're Linux and Mac, and we obviously have Windows partitions for testing, compatibility.

56
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:49,000
We do sell some software on Windows, but I am not a Chrome customer. I am not a Chrome OS user.

57
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:55,000
It's hard for me to kind of weigh in intelligently.

58
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:03,000
If you had a Chromebook that was suitably powerful and had a nice Google-maintained system, nice and clean, you just showed up and it works,

59
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:10,000
you open the laptop, you know that they're handling most of the stuff, and you can install all your favorite desktop, you know,

60
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:16,000
electron Linux applications, and you can have a real development environment. Would you use it?

61
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I mean, if that's the case, sure. But isn't that just like Pop OS? Isn't that just another version of Ubuntu now?

62
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I guess I'm missing something.

63
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I think the worry is not the personal aspect, I think, is the nature of this.

64
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Because, yes, personally, just running Linux, I love that. That's a great comment that you made.

65
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
No, I'm not trying to be a troll.

66
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:45,000
No, no, no, I like it. I just mean it may be that the end users, that's not â€“ yes, it is an option,

67
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:52,000
but they're going to get the choice of a Windows and Chromebook or maybe a Mac in their day-to-day lives.

68
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Sure.

69
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I think that's where a lot of the hope around Chrome OS is coming from is like,

70
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:02,000
hey, look, it is Linux, and it's becoming kind of like more real Linux, even if it's not perfect.

71
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:07,000
So, I mean, to answer your question in a, I guess, like a fuller way,

72
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I have never been shy about spending money on computers.

73
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Listen to the back catalog, right, folks?

74
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:22,000
So I would never buy a Chromebook because I just wouldn't, right?

75
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Like, I don't know, I really will buy whatever the sexy new XPS or System76 Linux laptop is.

76
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Or if I need a Mac, I will buy a brand new Mac Mini.

77
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
All right, let me break it down.

78
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Other than education, I don't understand the Chromebook as a product.

79
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Given that if I have people who aren't doing dev or engineering, Windows-based laptops are so cheap.

80
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:53,000
In fact, if I buy a Windows laptop and I throw a XFCE, by the way,

81
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
please listen to Choose Linux on Jupyter Broadcasting.

82
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,000
No one forced me to do this, by the way, this is voluntary.

83
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:06,000
It turns out that XFCE, which for those who don't know is a Linux desktop environment,

84
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:12,000
uses basically no memory and is super fast on shitty hardware you can buy in Best Buy.

85
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
So like for me, for my purposes as a guy who runs a dev shop,

86
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,000
if I have a sales guy or a customer service rep,

87
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:25,000
and if he or she doesn't want to run Windows because he wants to be part of the...

88
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
And I've had this happen, Wes, where they don't want to be the odd man out.

89
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Does that kind of make sense?

90
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Yeah, I mean, there's just social pressures there.

91
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,000
We are a Mac and Linux shop, right?

92
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:42,000
And each of us have a Mac and Linux machine, but for one hardcore Mac guy.

93
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:49,000
But like, I don't know, I would just like buy him a HP or a Dell at Best Buy

94
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,000
and like slap Ubuntu XFCE edition on that.

95
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:58,000
And like, I guess, educate me,

96
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:05,000
where would Chrome OS come into this conversation that I'm not understanding?

97
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I mean, I think it would mostly probably be for larger organizations

98
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
where you had a lot of overhead, you know,

99
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
where you did need some of those enterprise controls

100
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
to manage rollouts and submissions.

101
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
And so that's what I see a lot of this debate.

102
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Like personally, in my own life, I'm actually thinking about buying one just to play with it

103
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
because the tech is interesting behind it, but I don't really need it.

104
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
And I don't see myself using it just because I am comfortable

105
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,000
with the administrative overhead of regular operating systems.

106
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:36,000
But if you're the IT guy and you don't need like 50 different people all trying to do their own

107
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
and attempting to manage security updates

108
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
on the various developer laptops that they have,

109
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,000
maybe that gets you a little scared if you're from a sysadmin background.

110
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
That, I think, is a lot of the Google play here.

111
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Is this like an enterprise play, basically?

112
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I mean, there's definitely that angle, yeah.

113
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
And that's the same in the schools because you can, you know, you get it out,

114
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
they'll get you set up, and then the IT staff can administer it

115
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
and make sure that they're wiped.

116
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
And there's the security aspect of, you know, it's more sandboxed

117
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
and it's hard to install the things you want maybe,

118
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
but as a result, people just aren't going to break them.

119
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Fair enough.

120
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Well, we spent 10 minutes on Chrome OS just now,

121
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
which I think is 11 minutes more than we should.

122
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Way more, yeah.

123
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:19,000
For the record, Mike remains questionable about Chrome OS.

124
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I liked your comment, though.

125
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:25,000
You brought up your willingness, let's say willingness, to buy new hardware.

126
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:31,000
That is, I think, one of the reasons that we should move on to this next feedback topic.

127
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Let me brace for impact then.

128
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Yeah, hardware, it comes up sometimes.

129
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Andy writes in to us, in a recent episode,

130
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,000
you guys were talking about some people on Reddit, I'll put that in scare quotes,

131
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,000
really hate when there are discussions about hardware.

132
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
And that it's probably just, you know, one person with two accounts.

133
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Now, I'm not that person, but I also dislike you guys talking about hardware.

134
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,000
In fact, about a year or two ago, it seemed like half of every second episode

135
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,000
or about 25% of the show was about hardware.

136
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
I very nearly removed the show from my podcast app.

137
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,000
But, well, I didn't have anything better to replace it.

138
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
What I like about this is he next writes,

139
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
the hosts of the show are interesting to listen to.

140
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Unfortunately, that only goes so far when the content itself doesn't interest me.

141
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,000
To be clear, I don't expect you to change anything as I'm just one person.

142
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
If you have more listeners that enjoy what you're talking about,

143
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
well, then it doesn't make sense to stop.

144
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I'm just letting you know, here's one in that other column.

145
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Thank you for the generally entertaining show.

146
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Yeah, so this is a point, Wes, where you can do arbitration,

147
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
and Chris can't defend himself,

148
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
but I think I'm going to defend myself and Chris a little bit here.

149
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
So this show is old, Wes, right?

150
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Like, you know, you're new to it.

151
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Yeah, this is episode 355.

152
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
And as podcasts go, you know, and I've been the host of the show for a long time,

153
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I would argue, before I hit his actual points,

154
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:08,000
that one of the main Achilles' heel of Coderradio is that it's Coderradio,

155
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:13,000
not Linux coding radio or like iOS development radio.

156
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:18,000
So it's so broad that you always end up covering a lot of things.

157
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Like we just did last episode, we talked about what?

158
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Erlang, Clojure, I think I threw an F sharp reference somewhere, right?

159
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
You sure did.

160
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
And before that we talked about Rust,

161
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:33,000
and before that I think I talked about Swift maybe a few weeks ago.

162
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
So the hardware stuff has been a back and forth.

163
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,000
What I will say is I think there's a balance.

164
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,000
For instance, this eGPU, you know, I'm using an eGPU for a job right now.

165
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I have had a lot of people reach out to me on Twitter or via email

166
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
asking details about the eGPU.

167
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:56,000
I definitely get the, you know, which Linux distro are you running

168
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
or are you running Mac or Linux this week?

169
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
I get it.

170
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:03,000
It kind of doesn't matter for the context of the show.

171
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
But it's definitely a hard balance, right?

172
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Like the analogy I like to make is if this was carpentry radio,

173
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
you know, you'd like a carpenter, right?

174
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
It would be totally appropriate to talk about, well,

175
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
do you like Black & Decker or do you like Craftsman tools?

176
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
And why?

177
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
It's my opinion that that's an appropriate conversation to have.

178
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Yeah, right.

179
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
I mean, they're parts of your trade.

180
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
It's not the direct work and it's not a show about making hammers.

181
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
But, well, you're using a hammer.

182
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
So I would argue a different point.

183
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:36,000
So, okay, whether I'm running an XPS 13 or a Dordor Pro, I get it.

184
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
It's just like a vendor difference.

185
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:43,000
But how about if I switch from, let's say, OpenStack to Kubernetes?

186
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Well, that's worth talking about, right?

187
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Yeah, I would say so.

188
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,000
And that would be the title of the show.

189
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
So at that point, I'm going to just leave that analogy with you and say,

190
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Wes, you are the only innocent man here.

191
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:01,000
You're the only non-convicted hardware addict here.

192
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Judge me and Chris for the last six years.

193
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Go ahead.

194
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Judge, jury, executioner.

195
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
All right.

196
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Well, in my previous existence as a Just Coder Radio fan.

197
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Well, and you did host another show, though, right?

198
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Yeah, yeah, absolutely.

199
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,000
But just thinking about it from that perspective, I think it was just,

200
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
you know, it happened to be, too, the nature of the host.

201
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,000
So not only is it something that you need to use for your job

202
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
and spend time thinking about because you're a craftsman

203
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
and you want to work with good tools,

204
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
and those tools do affect your ability to get work done.

205
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
So you talk about it.

206
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Secondly, you're just flat out cursed.

207
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
So you just break everything that comes into contact with you.

208
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,000
So that also has led to just being hardware talking about like a little bit more.

209
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
I buy laptops seemingly once a decade.

210
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
So, you know, that shifts things,

211
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:53,000
although maybe that might change in the future now that you're influencing me.

212
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Well, a little defense here.

213
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:59,000
I also, because of the type of work I do, particularly in the aerospace industry,

214
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
I get hardware where I do the work on the hardware

215
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,000
and then have to ship it back.

216
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Right, so there's just a lot of transient hardware flowing through your life.

217
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Yeah, there's a lot of churn, right.

218
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,000
I would also say it was a topic that I enjoyed listening to you and Chris talk about

219
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
because you came at it from different perspectives,

220
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000
but it was an area that you could really meet in the middle.

221
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
From his perspectives using hardware for one purpose

222
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
and watching the industry for a long time

223
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
and yours from another angle.

224
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
So it was a fun way to interconnect and sort of talk about this stuff

225
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
in a little, not just from a consumer angle.

226
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
I guess that's the point that I liked

227
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
because we're just talking about things that we're using from day to day life.

228
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Okay, that's fine. That's less relevant.

229
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,000
But if it's tooling that you use to get your job done,

230
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,000
to do development, to do programming or anything in that area,

231
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
I think it just makes sense.

232
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Yeah, I would add, I mean, we went into a cursory explanation about three weeks ago

233
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:02,000
that at some point we have to talk again about eGPUs

234
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:08,000
because all of mine and Chris' agonizing over my potential ideal workstation,

235
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,000
I might not give this eGPU back, Wes.

236
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,000
I might just say I spilled a martini on it.

237
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Everybody would believe that, right?

238
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Yeah, absolutely.

239
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Honestly, I am shocked at how good Thunderbolt supported.

240
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
I know I'm taking a tangent, but indulge me, it's Cesar.

241
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
I am shocked, or two weeks from it,

242
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:33,000
how good eGPU support is on a modern Linux kernel.

243
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:38,000
This is awesome.

244
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
I am not a big gamer.

245
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:46,000
I've gone into the telegram, into the IRC a few times to ask for a gamer.

246
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,000
I'll play a casual 2D game, right?

247
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:57,000
But for ML programming, for just compiling big pieces of lots of code,

248
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:06,000
oh my God, if you are a developer who just spent $2,000 and up on a laptop

249
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,000
and you're annoyed you don't have a dedicated graphics card,

250
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:14,000
honestly, and I'll drop it here, consider an eGPU.

251
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Because when you're at your office, you're at your home office,

252
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:23,000
in my case I work from home, you plug it in via Thunderbolt, it's great.

253
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,000
But if you need to be on the road, you just run on the Intel,

254
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:31,000
the graphics processor, and you have your battery life

255
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
to do your PowerPoint or whatever you're doing.

256
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,000
In my case, it's whatever the healthy LibreOffice version of PowerPoint is.

257
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
But presentations?

258
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Impress?

259
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Whatever.

260
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,000
It's the built-in one to pop OS.

261
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
It's great.

262
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
And I do think it's important, right?

263
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Particularly because we have a bent towards independent software developers.

264
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:55,000
If you're a one-man band, you don't want to have to spend,

265
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:59,000
and frankly, we've had a history of covering Mac development and iOS development,

266
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:04,000
you don't want to spend $7,000 on a Mac Pro,

267
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,000
which is what I'm guessing they're going to cost in June.

268
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
We'll find out in a few months.

269
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:14,000
And then another $2,500 on the MacBook Pro to carry.

270
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Wouldn't it be nice if you could just buy the MacBook Pro,

271
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:23,000
or if you're not a Mac guy, buy the XPS or the Darter or whatever,

272
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
but get the best of both worlds?

273
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Is that insane, Wes?

274
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:31,000
No, honestly, it sounds kind of like the perfect unicorn situation.

275
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Because I have this OWC eGPU enclosure here.

276
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,000
I can pop out the Radeon Sapphire card I have in

277
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
if a better one comes out in a year,

278
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
and all I have to pay for is the card.

279
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
The enclosure still works.

280
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
You just swap them out, and suddenly it's like buying a nicer computer

281
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
with a better graphics card.

282
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
It's the whole new world, right?

283
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
I have to say, I was telling my wife,

284
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,000
and to say that her eyes glazed over is a wild understatement,

285
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,000
because apparently she found this boring.

286
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,000
But I don't need to spend money on computers now.

287
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
I have good enough computers,

288
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
but maybe I could buy a nicer monitor, right?

289
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:14,000
And then in a year I'd buy a nicer card to go into the eGPU container.

290
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
I forgot the word, the eGPU dock.

291
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
No.

292
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Case.

293
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
The hell they call them, Wes.

294
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
I was just going to let you try to figure it out,

295
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
because I was enjoying it.

296
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,000
I can't remember, but let's just call it the eGPU container.

297
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Enclosure.

298
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Enclosure, thank you.

299
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
And wow, I have a new computer.

300
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
But when I'm on the road and I'm giving a presentation,

301
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,000
I still have my beautiful eight hours of battery life.

302
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Right.

303
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
I don't know.

304
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
And we'll drop the hardware thing from here,

305
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
but yeah, we're going to cover eGPU stuff,

306
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
because I think it's a game changer,

307
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
especially for independent guys like me.

308
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,000
And Wes, I think it's a game changer for you,

309
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
because you're amazing,

310
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,000
and we need you rendered in the highest detail possible.

311
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Yeah, absolutely.

312
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
I mean, you've been making all those face swaps

313
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
between me and Jar Jar,

314
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,000
and that just takes a lot of time to compute.

315
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:05,000
I made the face swap between Chris and Darth Maul,

316
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
although nothing happened.

317
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
It was kind of weird.

318
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Eerily the same.

319
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Anyway, you're right.

320
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
It's time to move on from that.

321
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Thank you for writing in, Andy.

322
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,000
I appreciate that your feedback was nuanced.

323
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Well, we always appreciate the feedback, right?

324
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Keep writing in.

325
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Yeah, absolutely do.

326
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
And I like that you took it into account

327
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
that people like different things,

328
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
and that's just how it is.

329
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
We think a lot about it too.

330
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,000
So for something completely different,

331
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Mike, you've been trying to get us to include this in the show

332
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
for like a hot minute,

333
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
and I was like, what is this?

334
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
I'm not really caught up.

335
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Now's the time.

336
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
I'm really confused.

337
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:45,000
As someone who ends up running things like Qt, the framework,

338
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
I'm running the Plasma desktop.

339
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,000
So it's in my every day.

340
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,000
I've never really understood the dual licensing

341
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,000
and how the licensing requirements work.

342
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:01,000
So, Wes, you have the benefit of, again,

343
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,000
all these topics you are not involved in directly.

344
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
I am unburdened and innocent.

345
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,000
There is an application known as Gryphon,

346
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
which I'm sure you know,

347
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
a little company called the Mad Botter.

348
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
I love it.

349
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:20,000
It is a radar display system for fighter and now bomber jets, FYI.

350
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
There was a version of it written in Qt,

351
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:27,000
and then a wonderful young man named Mike called the Qt company in Boston

352
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
and said, hey, we'd like a license.

353
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
What can we do here?

354
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:35,000
We think we're okay with the GPL, but, you know, I'd like to talk,

355
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,000
and if we're not, let's, you know, before I sold anything,

356
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
I'm going to be super clear.

357
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,000
So would my lawyer, before we sold anything.

358
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,000
And the cute people, the gentleman I spoke to was basically like,

359
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:51,000
no, you need a proprietary license, and it's a lot of money.

360
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:57,000
So we RMFR'd the entire project, and then we sponsored.

361
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Wait, the entire project?

362
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
The entire source code base, yeah.

363
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Wow.

364
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Yeah, we sponsored Avalonia,

365
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:09,000
which is the cross-platform.NET open source toolkit,

366
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,000
and rewrote the entire thing in.NET with Windows support first,

367
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,000
and then eventually we added Linux support in about a month.

368
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:19,000
So this was a major derailment for not only the project, but the company.

369
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:26,000
This was a tens of thousand dollar loss for me personally, for my RAM.

370
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Turns out, and so funny, a listener of the show sent this video to me,

371
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:36,000
and in fact, he makes IoT boards, and we're going to be evaluating them soon.

372
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:40,000
There's been so much confusion for the cute company about the licensing

373
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,000
that they've made a very helpful, very detailed video on it.

374
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,000
I've watched the whole thing three times.

375
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
It's their attorney.

376
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
It's a video made by attorneys.

377
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,000
And this is like a 57-minute video, so that's a lot.

378
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Yeah, this is going into theoretical cases and legalities

379
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:02,000
of using the GPL and the LGPL and proprietary software.

380
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,000
I don't want to get in a fight about proprietary software.

381
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Just right now, the way my business is, I just have to.

382
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Everything's proprietary.

383
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Proprietary software is not ethical.

384
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,000
One day you'll have that last cheeseburger.

385
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Right, but yeah, you're making software,

386
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,000
and I'm sure if your customers were like, let's make it open source.

387
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Okay, cool.

388
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Then I would go with it.

389
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:31,000
And I will say we contribute back as much as our customers allow us to,

390
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
which I know is like a lame defense,

391
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,000
but unfortunately that's the way contracts are in.

392
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
I don't want to get into it too much.

393
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Yeah, you're running a business.

394
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
You've got bills to pay.

395
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
We'll move on.

396
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
We're a consulting.

397
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
We're a dev shop.

398
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
We are at the mercy of our customers.

399
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Yeah.

400
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Well, it turns out that our exact use case was completely okay under the GPL.

401
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Oh, really?

402
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Regardless of what the person you talked to at the organization told you.

403
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
As long as they could upgrade the version of Q

404
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:02,000
and put another Q binary in the place of the Q we were giving them,

405
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
then we're fine.

406
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Really?

407
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:10,000
So this is kind of a, because we got a lot of feedback on this, Wes.

408
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
We got a lot of feedback on this Q stuff.

409
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:16,000
If you are considering Q for a project, check out this video.

410
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,000
I have to say it hasn't changed my position

411
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:24,000
only because in the intervening time I now have a major project written on.NET.

412
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
I've joined the.NET Foundation.

413
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,000
We've open sourced.NET code.

414
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,000
You found a new home.

415
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
I sort of got married, right?

416
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
We're doing a lot of.NET work.

417
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:42,000
I can't deny that I would have preferred to have originally shipped this in Q,

418
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:49,000
but when the rep tells you that you'll be in violation of the license,

419
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,000
you don't do it, right?

420
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,000
That's just, that's life.

421
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Right.

422
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
That's just a bad idea.

423
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:02,000
We see this all the time, any kind of lack of clarity in licensing,

424
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
it's not a good risk that you can take.

425
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
You're just asking for a lawsuit down the road.

426
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
Right.

427
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:11,000
And for a little company like the Mad Botter, we would be destroyed by that.

428
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,000
It would be bang.

429
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
It would kill us.

430
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:19,000
Reflecting back on it now that you're here and on the other side of this little debacle,

431
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
did you like the?

432
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:25,000
Licensing aside, what was the difference like?

433
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
You had to switch all kinds of stuff.

434
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
You know what?

435
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,000
I liked Q.

436
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:34,000
As an experienced Objective-C developer, which I have to mention in every show,

437
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:38,000
C++ is very comfortable for me to work in, but I have to be honest with you.

438
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
I'm going to answer a different question.

439
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,000
I should have listened to the JB community.

440
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Yeah, that's just always true.

441
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:48,000
They were, and you can scroll up in Telegram, they were hollering at me that,

442
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,000
you are not violating the license.

443
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Go ahead and ship.

444
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
Don't worry about it.

445
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,000
And you know what, they were absolutely correct.

446
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:01,000
Now, they did not offer to pay your legal bills if they were wrong, but it's good advice.

447
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:07,000
The GPL is, I got to tell you, the GPL is a tough document to really understand, right?

448
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Especially the V3 version with the TiVo.

449
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Yeah, anti-TiVoization stuff.

450
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
What is TiVoization, right?

451
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:18,000
If I showed them a demo on a computer that I own, is that like TiVoization?

452
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,000
It's all crazy.

453
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:27,000
I would say that, it's funny, the things I like about Q are not the things the salesman wants to sell you on.

454
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,000
So, yeah, just maybe expand a little bit on that last point.

455
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,000
So, the things you like versus what they're actually trying to make money on?

456
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Sure.

457
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:40,000
So, a lot of effort has gone into not have you write into C++ for Q.

458
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:44,000
And I'm not talking about QML, which is for those who don't know QML.

459
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
QML is like their markup language.

460
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,000
It can do some logic, but think of it like...

461
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:52,000
It's like presentation versus code, kind of, right?

462
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Yeah, think about Android XML.

463
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:58,000
You can do some stuff, but not...

464
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:04,000
You're not going to write your whole app in QML if your app is as complicated as the radar display, for sure.

465
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
Right, yeah, absolutely.

466
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,000
But there's a Python extension to Q that we actually covered on the show.

467
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
There's JavaScript extensions.

468
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:16,000
So, adding more bindings, adding more ways to use Q without having to use C++.

469
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,000
I think there's a Java one, but I'm not entirely...

470
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:24,000
I think that might be a community project, not an officially blessed one.

471
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,000
But I liked it because it was C++, right?

472
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:31,000
And that, you know, for my business as a dev shop, just saying,

473
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:37,000
okay, we all have to work in C++ would really simplify everything that I'm doing.

474
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Yeah, and I imagine that that's not an uncommon choice

475
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:44,000
in some of the areas that you're playing with in aerospace or aeronautics.

476
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:48,000
Finally, yeah. I mean, we kind of gloss over this, but we build web systems all the time.

477
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:53,000
But our niche is really aerospace.

478
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:56,000
I'm still surprised we don't talk about Ada more often.

479
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
We could.

480
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,000
That's for another show.

481
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:04,000
I don't know how to do that in a 45-minute format.

482
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
Oh, man, we should, actually.

483
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Ada was one of the first languages I studied in my own computer science education.

484
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
I tell you what, then.

485
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:14,000
My birthday's in June. We can have a Mike's Birthday episode,

486
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
and you and I can go 13 rounds on Ada.

487
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Yeah, I'm looking forward to it.

488
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
All right.

489
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,000
But obviously, so like, okay, so since Wes brought it up,

490
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:26,000
in the aerospace industry, there's a few standards, right?

491
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:30,000
There is old stuff. I call it Ada.

492
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:35,000
There's like down to the hardware C, C++, which is where I kind of need to be.

493
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:38,000
There's.NET. There's like a lot of.NET.

494
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,000
Oh, really?

495
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Yeah, there's a lot of.NET.

496
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:46,000
There's some Java on the back-of-office stuff, but very rare.

497
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:50,000
To be honest, you're looking at C++ and.NET and some Ada,

498
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:54,000
but that's like, Ada's its own thing.

499
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,000
Maybe a better way to say it is you have embedded,

500
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,000
you have application, and then you have back-of-office.

501
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
Yes, that makes sense.

502
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:07,000
The beautiful thing about Q was it could have been the embedded, the application,

503
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:10,000
and the Rails could have still been the back-of-office, right?

504
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,000
So you could have just knocked out those other two parts.

505
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:16,000
You've already thrown everything else out,

506
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,000
which from a hiring and management perspective

507
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,000
would have made my life tremendously easier.

508
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:26,000
So now, because of the licensing, I'll call it confusion,

509
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:33,000
what's happened is embedded is Rust in one case,

510
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
but also.NET,

511
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:40,000
because it turns out Microsoft will throw money at any problem you put in front of them.

512
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,000
Wait, really? I didn't know you could do embedded with.NET.

513
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:47,000
You can do near-native performance C-sharp and F-sharp.

514
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:50,000
And is that still with garbage collection in that,

515
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,000
or is it a more minimal runtime?

516
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
That's a simple question.

517
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
Yes, you do have garbage collection,

518
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:01,000
but not the normal garbage collection you have on...

519
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:04,000
Different algorithms, a different garbage collector targeted for that.

520
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:07,000
You also don't have the entire.NET ecosystem to work with.

521
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
There's a NuGet, right?

522
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:12,000
You can't pull in a NuGet package and be like,

523
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,000
oh, great, it's very constrained.

524
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:20,000
But if you use a constrained subset of the language and dependencies then?

525
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
And frankly, I've been unfair.

526
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,000
When I said C-sharp, yes, it's possible,

527
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
but I really mean F-sharp.

528
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
We do F-sharp.

529
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
I love that.

530
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:35,000
Performance-wise, you're already paying a penalty for having the CLR,

531
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:38,000
which for those who don't know is the Common Language Runtime,

532
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:43,000
which if you're a Java developer, you have the JVM between Java.

533
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:46,000
Google it if you don't know.

534
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:50,000
And we do some.NET applications.

535
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,000
A lot of, like, Gryphon itself is a.NET application.

536
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
And we do some line-of-business apps,

537
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:59,000
which could easily be written in.NET instead of Rails, right?

538
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:02,000
But it didn't.

539
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Like, that's where we are now.

540
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,000
So the only differences between what I've just described

541
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
and what we're doing is our back-of-office is Rails

542
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:12,000
for reasons that we have our own stuff that works in Rails,

543
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
and it's great.

544
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:19,000
I don't understand, and maybe this is where Wes can help a little bit,

545
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:25,000
why there's so much complication around the licensing of Q.

546
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:28,000
I mean, even ignoring all the stuff I said about the CLR for.NET,

547
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,000
ignore the technical details, which is weird for a show called Code Radio.

548
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:34,000
The fact that you can't call a Qt rep

549
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:38,000
and get a straight answer on something feels like a problem.

550
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,000
Like, I don't know, I'm from New Jersey, right?

551
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:44,000
If I ask you a question and you don't answer my questioning,

552
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:49,000
like, I think it's because you want the right to sue me later.

553
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
Right, yeah, that makes sense.

554
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:54,000
So Wes, I don't know, I just threw a lot of data out.

555
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
What do you think?

556
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:00,000
I can certainly understand why it would be attractive at C++,

557
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:04,000
and even outside of that, there's plenty of bindings for things.

558
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:09,000
I can see why the base fee might be a lot,

559
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:13,000
because obviously it's all also GPL,

560
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:16,000
so they have to have some sort of revenue stream.

561
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,000
And that is why your point makes so much more sense,

562
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:23,000
because why their whole thing should be to make it super simple,

563
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
so that if you want to pay the money

564
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:29,000
or even think that you might want to pay the money to negotiate with them,

565
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
that should be clear and easy to do,

566
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:34,000
because otherwise you're just going to be confused.

567
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,000
If you can't get a clear answer

568
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:38,000
when you have a complicated dual licensing sort of thing,

569
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
and you see it all the time on Hacker News or anything else

570
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,000
for some new open core sort of system

571
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:46,000
or all these various in-betweens on different open source styles

572
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
of business running,

573
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
and someone asks some questions about like,

574
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
is this covered by the licensing?

575
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
And someone immediately pops in the comments and goes,

576
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
oh, here, DM me. Let's talk about this offline.

577
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,000
We'll get you all the information you need.

578
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:00,000
Now, do we know how those conversations go all the time?

579
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,000
Absolutely not.

580
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:04,000
But you got to hope and assume that the majority of them

581
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,000
are better than what you described.

582
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
Yeah, and you know, in defense of Q,

583
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:12,000
like the gentleman who I was talking to

584
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
has reached out to me several times.

585
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:17,000
They are not happy that we went to.NET,

586
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:21,000
and to say they're not happy is a giant understatement.

587
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:25,000
They feel that basically, you know,

588
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
the rep didn't understand our technical case,

589
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
and it turns out we could have done it the whole time,

590
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
blah, blah, blah, right?

591
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,000
Yeah.

592
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:37,000
It's, you know, I am not the biggest,

593
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,000
and we should move on,

594
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,000
but I'm not the biggest GPL hippie on the network, right?

595
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:46,000
Like I'm, you know, originally I was the iOS and Mac guy here.

596
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:50,000
If you think that having GPL software in industry is good,

597
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:55,000
you can't have this constant threat of legal action,

598
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:59,000
because, you know, a lot of the big applications

599
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
that you think about are written

600
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:04,000
by small subcontracting companies like mine.

601
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
And I'm not trying to like make this Mike's bitching hour,

602
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:10,000
but like it just is the case that, you know,

603
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,000
I have employees, right?

604
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
Like I can't use technology

605
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:18,000
that I think that I will be sued for.

606
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
Does that?

607
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,000
Oh, yeah, that's just absolutely.

608
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,000
It's not just you.

609
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
It's not you as an individual person.

610
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,000
You have a whole organization.

611
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,000
Right.

612
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,000
Like my employees have kids.

613
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:30,000
Like there's a whole, like, you know,

614
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:34,000
so I'm in this weird place where, again,

615
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,000
I think.NET is great.

616
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
I'm a member of the.NET Foundation.

617
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:41,000
I support financially.NET projects.

618
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:44,000
I would have preferred to use Qt,

619
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:48,000
but because of the legal risk, I didn't.

620
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:51,000
And, you know, I'm not, quote,

621
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
a member of the open source community.

622
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,000
I don't think I am.

623
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
That's Chris's thing and maybe your thing.

624
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:03,000
But I think you all should think about that before you,

625
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:06,000
I don't know, like we have the RMS stingers, right?

626
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,000
We have the RMS sound bites.

627
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
And it's like, well, the answer to that

628
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
is I'm just not going to use it.

629
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,000
Right.

630
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
If it's so difficult or off-putting, then.

631
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,000
Or scary.

632
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,000
If you can't give me a straight answer,

633
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:19,000
are you going to sue me or are you not?

634
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,000
Yeah.

635
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
I like that because it is like people do think it's great.

636
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,000
Right.

637
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
I mean, Qt is popular for partly, I think,

638
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
because, you know, it's easy to get started.

639
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
All the advantages that come from open source.

640
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,000
But you're right.

641
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,000
Many businesses find the GPL to be toxic.

642
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
And I think just some of this uncertainty

643
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,000
is often the reason why,

644
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
even if you get past the philosophy,

645
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,000
even if you're like, yeah, you're right.

646
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
I do want to give back.

647
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
Well, you were trying.

648
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,000
Well, we would contribute back.

649
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:48,000
Like, the sick part is we have contributed back to.NET projects.

650
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
We've contributed back to Rust projects.

651
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:55,000
Only because I could not justify the legal risk of using Qt

652
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
is why we didn't do it.

653
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,000
Hmm.

654
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,000
That makes a lot of sense.

655
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,000
That's an interesting case study.

656
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
And I think something we'll have to watch.

657
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
I'm kind of happy about it,

658
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
just because I think it did mean it gave you,

659
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,000
it forced you to do a little bit more Rust.

660
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:12,000
And that has led to a lot of great content for this show

661
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
and our next story today.

662
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,000
You know, Wes, I'd like to put a pin in this if I can.

663
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
Oh, please do.

664
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,000
Rust is moving fast.

665
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
So by the time this airs,

666
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
I'm sure there'll be five more versions.

667
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:30,000
But in Rust version 1.33.0, it adds pinning.

668
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
Wes, are you familiar with pinning?

669
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:36,000
I mean, I think in the general case, but not for Rust.

670
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
So tell me about this.

671
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:42,000
So I'm going to, again, this is a 45-minute radio show,

672
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:46,000
so you can pin a certain, let's say, object,

673
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,000
which do not throw things at me, Rust people.

674
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
You know, let's say data structure.

675
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,000
Yeah, that's a better term.

676
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
And so just to clarify,

677
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
this is a Rust-specific thing called pinning,

678
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
not related to dependencies

679
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,000
or, like, the other things I might think about.

680
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,000
You know, this is in the language,

681
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,000
but you have to be on Rust 1.33 or up, right?

682
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:10,000
So basically, you have a pin type and an unpin marker trait,

683
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
which there's a lot of words there.

684
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:16,000
So basically, the object, actually, they use object.

685
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
I'm surprised they use object and not data structure.

686
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,000
That's very interesting to me in the documentation.

687
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:24,000
Basically, making something a pin

688
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:27,000
means it will not move in physical memory.

689
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
So let's get our oscilloscopes

690
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:33,000
and let's get down into our RAM, boys and girls.

691
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:37,000
Literally, the object that you have created as a pin

692
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:40,000
is not going to move on the physical RAM.

693
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,000
That's in a simplified version of what's happening here.

694
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
Yes, I know there's different cases for swap.

695
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:48,000
Please don't email in, but yeah.

696
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,000
Right, right.

697
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
Yeah, the different levels of memory

698
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
and the abstractions that you're specifically writing towards.

699
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
So why did this stand out to you?

700
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
I mean, I can see how it might be useful,

701
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
but even as this blog post said,

702
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,000
you know, they say,

703
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,000
this feature will largely be used by library authors.

704
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
And that makes me wonder, what are you doing with it?

705
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
Nothing yet.

706
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:11,000
But, and bringing it back to.NET.

707
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:14,000
So.NET introduced async await,

708
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
which is an easy way to do concurrency

709
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
where the code looks procedural,

710
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
but actually like spins up a million threads

711
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
and does whatever the hell it needs to do.

712
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
You might use this for long running operations,

713
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
for network calls,

714
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:29,000
or if you've ever worked with BLE,

715
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
you probably use it a lot because Bluetooth low energy

716
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:35,000
is surprisingly not reliable.

717
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,000
No, not at all.

718
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,000
Not at all.

719
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
And we've seen that pattern, right?

720
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
.NET developed it, or fleshed out at least that implementation.

721
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
Yeah, Microsoft came up with it.

722
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
But we've seen it move.

723
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
Yeah, like you can do it in JavaScript,

724
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,000
you can do it in Python.

725
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,000
Java has it now, actually.

726
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,000
Yeah.

727
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
For some weird version of it.

728
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
So this is the first step, or maybe not the first,

729
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
but this is a step towards async await and Rust,

730
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
which you may think, okay, why do we want that?

731
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:02,000
And then Rust, that's usually used as a lower level language.

732
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,000
But think about it.

733
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
Do you want to write all these cases,

734
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
or do you want to have something, you know,

735
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
that in six months when you come back to read the code,

736
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
it's a lot simpler to understand?

737
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
Yeah, it's a nice option, right?

738
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
Maybe in some hot inner loop somewhere,

739
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:18,000
you can't use it, or you need to roll your own locking

740
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
and threading and all that.

741
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
But if you don't have to, right,

742
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
because basically this stuff all generates

743
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:27,000
these complicated state machines and callbacks

744
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:30,000
I don't want to write that.

745
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
Well, right, it's going to be like.NET

746
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
where there's a bunch of crazy cases where async await

747
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
makes no sense and you have to write everything yourself

748
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
just like you used to.

749
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:42,000
But for, you know, 90% of the cases, this is the answer.

750
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:45,000
And it seems like it could be especially useful in Rust as,

751
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
you know, it's already lower level,

752
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
so if this can make something just a little bit easier,

753
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:52,000
as you said, to come back to understand and to work on again,

754
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,000
I'm all for it.

755
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
Yeah, I think it's a great addition.

756
00:39:55,000 --> 00:40:01,000
I'm very curious to see how Rust is going to implement async await,

757
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
and I think, you know, we're just going to have to wait for that.

758
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:09,000
But I have lots of questions about how that's going to work,

759
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:12,000
particularly in an embedded context.

760
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:15,000
Yes, you might have a lot of concerns about how that works.

761
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
Yeah, and maybe it just won't, right?

762
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
But, you know, we'll see.

763
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,000
Interesting.

764
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,000
That's certainly an evolving story.

765
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:24,000
And, you know, as you said, Rust is moving fast.

766
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
That might be a feature.

767
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:29,000
That might just be the next thing that I really have to just bite the bullet

768
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
and dig more into Rust.

769
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,000
That's right.

770
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:35,000
So I hear you're writing this new hot language from Microsoft twice.

771
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
What's going on here?

772
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,000
Yeah, Rust.

773
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
That's so old and busted, Mike.

774
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
I'm writing BOSQ.

775
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
I don't know if we decided how to pronounce it.

776
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:49,000
B-O-S-Q-U-E.

777
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:53,000
And it was just announced this previous week.

778
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:58,000
It derives from a combination of TypeScript-inspired syntax and types,

779
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:04,000
plus some ML, meaning the ML family of languages, not machine learning,

780
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:07,000
and Node and JavaScript-inspired semantics.

781
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:10,000
And the words of my cousin Teal, your words mean nothing to me.

782
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:14,000
Basically, it seems like, and we should be clear off the top, as they say,

783
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:19,000
as the project lead himself says, this is a research project.

784
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
It's not meant to be your new production language.

785
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:25,000
It's just something Microsoft's playing with as ways to start exploring

786
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:28,000
how to make programming better.

787
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
And that actually seems to be one of their big pushes here,

788
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:37,000
because they're almost preaching it as a new way to approach programming.

789
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
So there's a paper that's out by Mark Maron,

790
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:44,000
and he calls it out right at the top, regularized programming.

791
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:47,000
And the comparison is to the old style of what was called

792
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:50,000
structured programming, right?

793
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:53,000
You know, I don't love the way it looks,

794
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:56,000
but I think there are a lot of interesting ideas here.

795
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:01,000
And I think in the spirit of a lot of people that I find inspiring,

796
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:04,000
I think that regardless of the specifics of this implementation,

797
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:07,000
which we can talk more about because there are some interesting concepts in here,

798
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:10,000
I think the main goal of trying to reduce complexity

799
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:16,000
and making and designing languages with that as one of the primary

800
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:20,000
motivating factors is very much something I like.

801
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
I have been reading, I've read through the GitHub,

802
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
I've read both the articles we have in the show notes.

803
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
What is new about this language?

804
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:31,000
I mean, it's taking the ideas and the concepts in terms of, you know,

805
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:36,000
methodological concepts of strong typing and those of functional programming

806
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:39,000
and just basically merging them together.

807
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:44,000
Like, what am I missing, right?

808
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
Yeah, you're right.

809
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:49,000
I think it can be said that much of the stuff that's in here,

810
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
I don't know about what other languages are doing,

811
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:54,000
like one of the features is this typed string sort of thing,

812
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:57,000
where just like a way to declare types of strings

813
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:00,000
and lift some of the identification into the type system.

814
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
Strings are terrible, yes.

815
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:05,000
Right, and we often end up just programming with a whole bunch of strings

816
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
we pass around.

817
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
But you are right, that much of this stuff,

818
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:15,000
and I guess they almost say it themselves, that is flowing out of research,

819
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
out of other things that have already been implemented

820
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:20,000
or are seen in other languages and communities.

821
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:24,000
Like, you know, there are no explicit looping constructs in Bosque.

822
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
I like that, I think that's good,

823
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,000
but there are plenty of other languages that lack that.

824
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:32,000
Okay, but like there's also like, I don't know,

825
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:36,000
you can like do a map over things, right?

826
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:40,000
Like, isn't that just going to become the poor man's loop,

827
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
or am I just being overly cynical here?

828
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:47,000
Well, sure, but when you, and in the simple cases, it already is.

829
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
But even when you just have math, right,

830
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
you've already de-complected something,

831
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:55,000
because in the simple case, sure, a loop is basically just the same thing,

832
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:58,000
you're iterating over each item and then doing something,

833
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
but it can get more complicated,

834
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
because you have an arbitrary scope inside there

835
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:05,000
that you can just keep your own state, you can mess with stuff.

836
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:09,000
It is not fundamentally tied to a mapping over one thing.

837
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:12,000
And so I think that's the level that they're trying to get at here,

838
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:15,000
is to say like, yes, you understand this,

839
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
yes, these are equivalent in terms of theory,

840
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:23,000
but this is a more ergonomic and safer way to model this program or this problem.

841
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:26,000
And we think these should be the default tools available to you,

842
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:29,000
not these older imperative style.

843
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:32,000
Right, I agree with that.

844
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:36,000
But like, Microsoft already has F Sharp.

845
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:39,000
And TypeScript.

846
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:42,000
I have lots of problems with TypeScript.

847
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
You know I don't like TypeScript, right,

848
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:47,000
but you should just learn ECMAScript and be done with it.

849
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:54,000
But like, one of my hobby horses is that people writing these crazy algorithms in C Sharp

850
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:57,000
and doing these like low-level projects

851
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:01,000
where they need data integrity and all this kind of fun stuff

852
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:04,000
ought to really be using F Sharp.

853
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
And they're not.

854
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:10,000
So, I mean, anything that's invented is great.

855
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
I don't want to like take away from that.

856
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:17,000
But F Sharp solves many of these problems.

857
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:21,000
Maybe not in the same way, like the whole scoping thing, fair enough.

858
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:24,000
But I don't know.

859
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:27,000
If I were the Microsoft language team, I might,

860
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:31,000
like, you know this, Wes, it's my hobby horse, right,

861
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:35,000
.NET developers who aren't data scientists,

862
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:38,000
because data scientists love F Sharp,

863
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:41,000
need to pay more attention to F Sharp.

864
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:44,000
It's just, it's a really good language.

865
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:49,000
And it solves many of the problems that BOSK,

866
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:52,000
is that what we decided, BOSK or BOSK?

867
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:55,000
We're just going to use both, and we'll see what happens.

868
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
Like, claims to solve, and I'm not like,

869
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
this is definitely an achievement.

870
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:04,000
But, I mean, F Sharp.org guys, it's great, trust me.

871
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:08,000
Like, it's, it'll change your life.

872
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
No, I mean, you are right.

873
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:14,000
And I've seen some commentary kind of wondering,

874
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
like, is this just some sort of power grab?

875
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:20,000
These ideas don't look new, just like you were saying, right?

876
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
And so it depends on how much you read.

877
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:23,000
Are these claims?

878
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,000
This exists in another Microsoft language.

879
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:26,000
It's called F Sharp.

880
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,000
Like, sorry to interrupt,

881
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:30,000
but that's my entire criticism of this, right?

882
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:33,000
Like, we should make F Sharp better,

883
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:36,000
because it's already awesome.

884
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:39,000
You know, I think that is reasonable.

885
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:42,000
Thank you.

886
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:45,000
I will say, I do believe that there's value

887
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
in further exploring this stuff.

888
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:48,000
Oh, yeah, no, no.

889
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
I'm not saying we shouldn't have new languages.

890
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,000
I'm just saying like,

891
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
maybe that energy is being spent here,

892
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
but not necessarily like you're saying.

893
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:58,000
Like, we could be evangelizing more for F Sharp

894
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:01,000
and talking about F Sharp with some of the time

895
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
that we're using right now, even here.

896
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:04,000
Right.

897
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
So let me make an argument by parallel, right?

898
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
When Canonical did a bunch of crack

899
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,000
and decided to make Unity.

900
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
I remember the days.

901
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:14,000
That was a bad idea that did not work out.

902
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:15,000
I mean, I think some people,

903
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:18,000
Unity 7 lovers would perhaps disagree,

904
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,000
but you're right.

905
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:20,000
I mean, they're no longer doing it.

906
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:21,000
Right.

907
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
But you could re-implement the Unity style in Gnome

908
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
very easily via extensions.

909
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,000
And I'm sorry, non-Linux users,

910
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,000
but go down this road with me.

911
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,000
There is a limited amount

912
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:34,000
of deep engineering expertise to be used.

913
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:38,000
Like, these are literally concepts that like,

914
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
when I talk to C Sharp developers

915
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
who are like doing large data things

916
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:43,000
or like mathematical processing,

917
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
they're like, oh,.NET sucks.

918
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
I'm like, actually, no.

919
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:48,000
It's C Sharp.

920
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,000
It just isn't meant for this, right?

921
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
C Sharp is an object-oriented language

922
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,000
that is meant to build you

923
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:55,000
a pretty battleship-grade web application.

924
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
And these days, you know, a server app,

925
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:00,000
if you want to do ASP core.

926
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
Or even back in the day, ASP.NET.

927
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,000
Right.

928
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,000
But it's not necessarily there to do your, like,

929
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
high-level data processing pipelines.

930
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:08,000
Mm-hmm.

931
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,000
Right.

932
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:10,000
There is a solution.

933
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:13,000
And the beautiful thing about.NET

934
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:16,000
and the CLR is you can mix F Sharp and C Sharp.

935
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:19,000
You can have an entire module in F Sharp

936
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:22,000
that just, like, does all of that.

937
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:25,000
So, like, if Bosque, I'm calling it Bosque,

938
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:30,000
I just made a decision, is better, fabulous, right?

939
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
Like, I am not, I am all, you know what?

940
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,000
I'm using Rust.

941
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:36,000
It's hard to be more hipster than Rust.

942
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:40,000
But it's weird to me that the same company,

943
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,000
like, you know what?

944
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:42,000
JetBrains has Kotlin.

945
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:45,000
They're not, like, competing with themselves, right?

946
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
Mm, yeah.

947
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:51,000
So, like, where does F Sharp and Bosque begin?

948
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,000
Like, from what I've read on the GitHub page

949
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:57,000
and the commits, Bosque is maybe a more pure implementation,

950
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:00,000
where F Sharp is kind of in this weird space

951
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
of having to be married to, like,

952
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
we have to be compatible with the CLR and C Sharp

953
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:05,000
and blah, blah, blah.

954
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:06,000
Yeah, so I think there is that.

955
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:09,000
Like, it is, you know, they've built it on top.

956
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:12,000
I think it's implemented mostly in TypeScript right now.

957
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
So it's built on a different runtime,

958
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:15,000
which is kind of interesting.

959
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:19,000
Also, I would assume that Bosque in particular

960
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:22,000
probably doesn't run hardly anywhere in the future.

961
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
Like, I don't know that it will go anywhere.

962
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:27,000
I bet we will see some ideas filter into F Sharp.

963
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,000
I mean, that's a damn shame, though.

964
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
Like, you know what?

965
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:34,000
If I'm a shill, I'm an F Sharp shill, right?

966
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:37,000
Like, I don't want Bosque to die.

967
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:40,000
I would love Bosque to become one of these languages

968
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
that compiles into WebAssembly.

969
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:43,000
Is that crazy?

970
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,000
No, no, I mean, I think actually,

971
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:48,000
I think that's on something that they're interested in.

972
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
So it is, I think it's just an interesting,

973
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
I mean, just that we hadn't talked about this at all

974
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:53,000
and that you had these thoughts

975
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:56,000
and we've had such disparate views here.

976
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
If this, even if this isn't the thing,

977
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
you know, isn't the next playground,

978
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:03,000
clearly people care about this stuff

979
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,000
and maybe that's enough, right?

980
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,000
Like, so Vocal Point,

981
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
and they've already had a lot of issues opened up

982
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,000
on the GitHub project kind of reflecting on that.

983
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:10,000
How are we going to do, right?

984
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,000
There was questions about

985
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:15,000
how might this language handle asynchronous programming?

986
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:18,000
So there's lots to be left there.

987
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:19,000
I don't know.

988
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:22,000
I think it is trying to still find the right fit of,

989
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
you know, how do we combine all of these new ideas

990
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
that different languages have

991
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
and what does it look like to have all of them in one place?

992
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:32,000
And can that be simple, functional, and pleasant to you?

993
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,000
No, I think it's great.

994
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
I mean, Wes, can I make a crazy prediction

995
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,000
that we'll cover in a year from now?

996
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:38,000
Yes, you can.

997
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
I think what's going to happen

998
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
is that functional programming

999
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,000
is actually going to become the default.

1000
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
I sure hope you're right.

1001
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
You know, I think last week,

1002
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
we talked about Dr. Armstrong, right?

1003
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:51,000
The creator of Erlang.

1004
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,000
And he had a paper, what is it?

1005
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,000
OO Sucks, right?

1006
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:56,000
Is that right?

1007
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:59,000
Yeah, there's one of his older blog articles.

1008
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:02,000
I think he's right, actually.

1009
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:05,000
The more complicated applications I've had to write,

1010
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,000
the less and less I've wanted to architect things

1011
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
in an object-oriented way.

1012
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:12,000
I really do believe that if you're a young developer,

1013
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,000
because we get this email all the time,

1014
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
learn an OO language like Java or C Sharp

1015
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
just to be marketable to...

1016
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
You've got to be conversant with these

1017
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,000
because they are the dominant rare time.

1018
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:25,000
Well, there's hundreds of millions of lines of code in them, right?

1019
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,000
You're going to touch them.

1020
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,000
The future, you know what?

1021
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:32,000
Ring the bell, Wes. Ring it.

1022
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,000
Wes was right.

1023
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
It's going to be functional.

1024
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
Things like Clojure, things like Rust,

1025
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,000
things like Haskell, F Sharp.

1026
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,000
I have to throw my F Sharp in there

1027
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,000
because I'm defending it to my bloody death.

1028
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,000
That's the future.

1029
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,000
I can't tell you.

1030
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,000
I write tons of code for clients.

1031
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
I write tons of code for myself.

1032
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,000
Tons of open source.

1033
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:58,000
And for me, personally, at this juncture in my life,

1034
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:01,000
it's always the functional code that's most interesting

1035
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,000
because it's the algorithmic code.

1036
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:07,000
It's either doing the crazy 3D file processing

1037
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:10,000
or it's doing the, you know,

1038
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:14,000
like the new ML project coming on in a few weeks.

1039
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
Like, I don't know.

1040
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
OO is for Goobies.

1041
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:22,000
Send your hitmail to wes at jupiterbroadcasting.com.

1042
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
Well, and then even there, I think...

1043
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:25,000
You're right.

1044
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:28,000
I mean, it does pair well with there things like...

1045
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
It just has existed there for a long time.

1046
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:33,000
And there are good parts about a lot of the standards

1047
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
that get associated with object-oriented programming.

1048
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:38,000
I think, you know, the push towards polymorphism

1049
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:39,000
has been really good.

1050
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:42,000
And that generally has made programming better.

1051
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:45,000
And we have better ways to do abstractions.

1052
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,000
So I think we've learned, right?

1053
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:50,000
We've taken stuff like type classes or traits

1054
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:53,000
and been able to have that sort of stuff a la carte

1055
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,000
without having these imposed hierarchies

1056
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:58,000
and this rigid style.

1057
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:02,000
I also think you're right that frequently you can find...

1058
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:07,000
While it may be foreign and look just overly terse,

1059
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:10,000
you can get a really good coupling of the problem domain

1060
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
and then the code that's used to represent it

1061
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:13,000
when you've abstracted it well

1062
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
and you're using some of these functional paradigms

1063
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
because more and more it does look like

1064
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:20,000
just a data pipeline process.

1065
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:23,000
And you can understand in decomposed steps

1066
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,000
because composition is so important

1067
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:26,000
in functional programming.

1068
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
It's then easy to decompose

1069
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
and understand what each step is doing.

1070
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:33,000
Compare that with like a whole bunch of different objects

1071
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,000
all pulling strings on each other.

1072
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000
It's just madness.

1073
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,000
Well, no, I think you're completely right, though.

1074
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,000
I mean, in terms of functional being better architected.

1075
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:42,000
But I think we should move on

1076
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:43,000
because I feel like we're getting...

1077
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,000
You know what, Wes?

1078
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,000
My beard...

1079
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:48,000
Do we even want to say...

1080
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:49,000
I don't want to say this on the air.

1081
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:50,000
You know, I'm going to say it anyway.

1082
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
I have gray in my beard now.

1083
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:55,000
Ooh, you're so distinguished, Mr. Dunham.

1084
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:56,000
No, you know what it is?

1085
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
I'm a has-been, just like Objective-C,

1086
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:01,000
which is still the one language to rule them all,

1087
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,000
one language to bind them all, one language...

1088
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
Never mind.

1089
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:06,000
What about...

1090
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,000
You know what I hate?

1091
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:11,000
Other than Swift developers, of course.

1092
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000
What do you hate, Mike?

1093
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:14,000
Do you know?

1094
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:15,000
Thank you.

1095
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:19,000
I hate when I accidentally commit my AWS secrets

1096
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:22,000
into my damn GitLab account.

1097
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
Yeah, don't we all?

1098
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:25,000
It's a B.

1099
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:28,000
Yeah, I saw this thing out from AWS Labs,

1100
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:31,000
which is part of the AWS's open source work.

1101
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,000
Yes, it exists, if you didn't know that.

1102
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,000
Actually, they do a fair bit

1103
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,000
that you just don't always hear about it.

1104
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:38,000
I thought they hated Linux.

1105
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:39,000
Wait a minute.

1106
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:40,000
I thought they just forked everything

1107
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
and just went on their own.

1108
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
Yeah, unless you follow their developer blogs,

1109
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:47,000
it can be sometimes hard to notice all the open source work.

1110
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,000
But they employ so many people

1111
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:53,000
and obviously are built on so much open source technology.

1112
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:56,000
You kind of just have to end up giving back.

1113
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
I've played with a couple other sort of solutions for this,

1114
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:59,000
like what's it called?

1115
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
I think Truffle Hound is one

1116
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:04,000
that basically just looks for high entropy strings

1117
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:07,000
in your repositories and alerts you to them.

1118
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:10,000
Git Secrets is a little bit different

1119
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
and it does have some sort of configuration

1120
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:16,000
so that it, by default, understands AWS.

1121
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:19,000
So if you're a big AWS user and you really...

1122
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:20,000
One of the first things,

1123
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
especially when you're setting up in an AWS environment,

1124
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:23,000
you've got to like,

1125
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
all right, I go figure out my different credentials

1126
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,000
and I've got to get my system provisioned and set up

1127
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:28,000
so it can talk to AWS

1128
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
and then run against the staging environment.

1129
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:31,000
But I need those credentials over here,

1130
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,000
but I really then need the production credentials

1131
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,000
when I switch to broad and how do I do that?

1132
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:36,000
And it shouldn't be in the repo.

1133
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,000
And especially maybe you're working with multiple teams

1134
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:41,000
or some sort of contracting company you've hired.

1135
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:42,000
Just a mistake.

1136
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:43,000
And if you've ever had to go back

1137
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,000
and clean up secrets out of a repository,

1138
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:46,000
secrets are annoying.

1139
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:49,000
I have not used Git Secrets,

1140
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:50,000
but I just thought it was neat

1141
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
that there was a semi-first-party solution

1142
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:53,000
from Amazon for this.

1143
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,000
I don't know how easy it would be to make this work

1144
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:59,000
for secrets for other cloud providers or other projects.

1145
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:00,000
Maybe go give it a try.

1146
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
Or, dear audience member,

1147
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
perhaps you have a preferred solution for this.

1148
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000
You've already got it integrated with your CI system

1149
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
because you're just that cool.

1150
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:11,000
Let us know, coder.show slash contact.

1151
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:15,000
Now, Mike, I know you, being the generous soul that you are,

1152
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:18,000
well, you've got something of a contest going on, don't you?

1153
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:22,000
Yeah, so I would prefer that my son not die in floods

1154
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:25,000
or, you know, like, you know, arid landscapes.

1155
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,000
I'm going to second you on that one.

1156
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:28,000
Thank you.

1157
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:31,000
And this extends to everybody's children, right?

1158
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,000
Sons, daughters, whatever.

1159
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:37,000
So we at the Mad Botter are sponsoring a little competition.

1160
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,000
Now, you have till the end of May.

1161
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:43,000
If you are a high school or middle school student

1162
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,000
or indeed you know one, please share the info.

1163
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:50,000
Write up with a technical diagram and a project synopsis

1164
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:54,000
your plan to combat global warming using Linux.

1165
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
Now, the using Linux part is important.

1166
00:56:56,000 --> 00:57:00,000
Has to be using Linux and preferably open source software,

1167
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
but the condition is using Linux.

1168
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:06,000
We're going to pick one winner from the high school bracket

1169
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,000
and the middle school bracket,

1170
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:11,000
and each winner is going to get a Dart or Pro from System76.

1171
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,000
This is on my dime.

1172
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:17,000
You know, I think we're going to do these about once a quarter for kids.

1173
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:20,000
We will be verifying that you are actually a high school student

1174
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,000
or a middle school student, of course.

1175
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:26,000
But, you know, if you're listening, think outside the box, right?

1176
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:29,000
Because Wes and I talked a lot about, what did we talk about?

1177
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:32,000
F sharp today and a few other languages.

1178
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:36,000
Don't think that you have to be married to what we've talked about.

1179
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:41,000
I'm sure Wes would agree that it's preferable for you to kind of

1180
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:44,000
just let it go, right? Just think outside, you know.

1181
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:47,000
Yeah, that's one of the advantages of things like this is, you know,

1182
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,000
we're old and stuck in our ways.

1183
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:52,000
We're old and stuck in our ways and, you know,

1184
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:55,000
oftentimes can't see the best solution for something,

1185
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,000
and it takes out of the box ideas,

1186
00:57:57,000 --> 00:58:01,000
things that might seem just unintuitive or wrong or broken

1187
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:04,000
that end up really shedding light on something.

1188
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:07,000
Right, and this is definitely my, you know, this is my own initiative.

1189
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:09,000
This is a team B thing.

1190
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:13,000
I did email and talked about it privately in Tampa a few weeks ago

1191
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:16,000
and say, well, should I do this Linux Academy course?

1192
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:19,000
Linux Academy, there's no preference, right?

1193
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:22,000
If you're a member, if you're not, whatever you want to do.

1194
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:25,000
If your thing is a completely, you know, hell,

1195
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:29,000
if you can solve global warming with real basic, go on.

1196
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:32,000
And I have a friend named Brian who you should talk to,

1197
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:35,000
who we're not friends, but it'd be fun.

1198
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:37,000
Too soon?

1199
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,000
No, amazing. Amazing.

1200
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:42,000
Well, Mike, this is real generous of you,

1201
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:45,000
and I'm excited to see what comes out.

1202
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,000
You know what I figured, Wes?

1203
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:50,000
Instead of pouring gin into laptops,

1204
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:53,000
I should just give them to kids who might save my life.

1205
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:56,000
And that means more gin for you.

1206
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:59,000
And more sales for System76, who, by the way,

1207
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:03,000
keeps sending me nasty messages about you being prettier than me.

1208
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,000
We'll have to have a conversation offline.

1209
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,000
We sure will.

1210
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,000
Well, if you want to go find out more, of course,

1211
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:13,000
you can find that stuff in our show notes, coder.show slash 355.

1212
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:16,000
Or, well, you can just follow Mike's wonderful company,

1213
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:20,000
The Mad Botter Inc. on Twitter there at TheMadBotterInc.

1214
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:23,000
Mike, you're on Twitter too? What's your handle?

1215
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:25,000
At Dimenuco.

1216
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:28,000
I'm there as well. I'm at Westpane.

1217
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:31,000
You can also find, well, the whole darn network

1218
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:34,000
and with, you know, links to all the other hoots that are on there too,

1219
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:40,000
at Jupiter Signal or just head on over to JupiterBroadcasting.com.

1220
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,000
That's going to be it for us today.

1221
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:45,000
But if you want more, you'll find the whole catalog there

1222
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:49,000
and you'll find the calendar where you can come join us here

1223
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:52,000
for the live show every Monday.

1224
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:55,000
Thank you so much for joining. We'll see you then.

1225
00:59:55,000 --> 01:00:05,000
I'll see you next time.

1226
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:45,000
.
