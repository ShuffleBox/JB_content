00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
This is KOTOR Radio, episode 479 for August 15th, 2022.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:20,320
Hey, good buddy, welcome back to Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show, taking a pragmatic look

3
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:24,920
at the art and the business of software development and the world of technology.

4
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:29,960
My name is Chris, and joining us fighting his old IRC client, it's our host, Mr. Dominic.

5
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:30,960
Hello, Mike.

6
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:36,240
She's an oldie, but she got me all the way across Route 66, all the way to Orleans, down

7
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:37,800
to Tampa Way.

8
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:41,600
That addium, it's old, reliable, just not working right now.

9
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:42,600
It's working right now.

10
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:47,920
So, I reopen it, it's like you already identified, I'm like, I know, thank you.

11
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:51,720
IRC's old, it's old, it is.

12
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:57,960
I think what happens, I didn't use this computer since last week's show, and all of my stuff

13
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:59,280
is just popping up.

14
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,280
You're not logged in.

15
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:01,280
You're logged in.

16
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,280
You're not logged in.

17
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:03,280
It's like, yes.

18
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:06,840
Now that we have the star power of Michael Dominic on our Matrix server, we might as

19
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:08,860
well just migrate our chat over to Matrix soon.

20
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:09,860
You know what I mean?

21
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:11,800
We should, as soon as I authorize this machine.

22
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:12,800
Yeah.

23
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:16,760
Oh, I've been trying out Fluffy Chat, by the way, which is a pretty decent Matrix client

24
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:17,760
as well.

25
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:18,760
Ooh, Fluffy.

26
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:19,760
Yeah.

27
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:24,120
We'll have to run it by the union though, because it's already turned around on us.

28
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:25,120
What was this?

29
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:28,420
A month before having a mascot has completely derailed the show?

30
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:29,660
It may be over after this.

31
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:30,660
It may be over.

32
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:35,320
At Coder Radio Show, from the official Coder Radio mascot, they write, I want to remind

33
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:38,160
you both that we have strict labor laws in Europe.

34
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:41,800
I don't think denying a mascot its vacation is legal.

35
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:46,200
I consider founding the first podcast mascot union to make sure the podcast mascot's rights

36
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,360
are respected and not eradicated.

37
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,360
This is a threat.

38
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:54,140
If we don't act, this is a threat, and they will launch a union, a Coder Radio union,

39
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:55,680
and then you know where that leads.

40
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,280
The show's costs are going to explode.

41
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:00,160
It's not going to be profitable to do the show.

42
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:01,160
We're going to have to end the show.

43
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:05,640
Well, luckily, I called an old friend from the state department and she had an interesting

44
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:06,640
thing to say.

45
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,640
How quick are you on your soundboard?

46
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:09,800
F*** the EU.

47
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:12,640
But we do love Egon, our Coder Radio mascot.

48
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:16,840
Yeah, but Newlin's going to come over there and clear things up, I would expect.

49
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,240
But don't worry, she'll bring sandwiches.

50
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:21,640
She's definitely not personally responsible for anything that's going on right now.

51
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:23,720
No, definitely not directly responsible.

52
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:24,720
No.

53
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:28,080
You know, the thing about the Coder Radio mascot though, I thought maybe we could just

54
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:31,520
buy him off with some air time, you know, because air time is valuable.

55
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:34,080
So maybe if we just spent, you know what I'm saying, we'll just bribe him with some air

56
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,080
time.

57
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:36,080
We'll see.

58
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,080
It's treacherous though, friends.

59
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:40,840
If the if the show isn't here next week, it's because the union took us out.

60
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:43,400
That's what we get for agreeing to a mascot.

61
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,400
All right.

62
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,920
We got some feedback into the show and I thought we'd cover all bits of it.

63
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:52,800
Some of it I replied to directly, but I wanted to read a frustrated commuters feedback.

64
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,920
Listening to last episode, I think there's a huge issue in the ideas about what the workplace

65
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:01,360
is supposed to be and why the prospect of being in the office is so absurd.

66
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:06,280
I live in the greater Sacramento area, but whereas I live in the lower west due to proximity

67
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:10,860
to my family, most jobs are in the northeast.

68
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:14,320
And as such, I have about an hour commute each way.

69
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:20,080
I just started a job at a nationwide retailer and we do projects in stores across the country.

70
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:23,880
I'll never touch a physical machine or a server as they're located in retail stores

71
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,420
in the US and Canada.

72
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:30,480
My direct supervisor recently received a special exemption to move to Tennessee and works completely

73
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:31,480
remote.

74
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:35,560
But I am required to be in the office eight hours a day, three days a week for now.

75
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:41,200
But they say full time is on the horizon and we have an always on camera to validate.

76
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:44,200
What's worse, I am not allowed to sign something to skip lunch.

77
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:46,920
I have to clock out for an hour at least.

78
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:50,380
And that means in my previous job, I gave them eight hours of my time per day.

79
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:55,880
But now I have to give this company essentially eleven hours of my day and spend more money

80
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:56,880
on fuel.

81
00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:01,240
I'm just less inclined to fit in with this culture working remotely, maybe.

82
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:03,280
But I'm not there to make friends.

83
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,140
This isn't a social club or a barbecue.

84
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:09,800
If I'm meeting the expectations, then the culture fit shouldn't matter.

85
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:12,940
The insistence on going back to the office is just unnecessary.

86
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:16,720
It's often insulting as the people with the authority get the exceptions to keep enjoying

87
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:21,120
the comforts of a remote workplace that they had during the pandemic, whereas rubes are

88
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,680
now arguably paying the tax to sit in their AC.

89
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:28,200
At the end of the day, I just can't help those three extra hours a day don't do anything

90
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:30,820
to make me want to fit into the workplace.

91
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:33,640
They just make me ponder my next contract.

92
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:35,560
Frustrated commuter.

93
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:38,240
Could you imagine the always on camera stuff?

94
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,800
How awful that's getting now?

95
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,880
Yeah, no, no, I don't.

96
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:46,200
That's I really don't think that that's appropriate task of anybody.

97
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,960
Like part of me says, well, go get a new job, man.

98
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:49,160
If you don't like it, get a new job.

99
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:51,360
Like that's how you vote with your you know, with your feet.

100
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:55,400
But then I also understand it's not as always easy as that, depending on your industry and

101
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:59,160
your work and, you know, financial situation.

102
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:03,760
And the disturbing thing is, is The New York Times put out a pretty good piece just yesterday

103
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:06,520
about the rise of worker productivity scores.

104
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:13,600
And they're using all these automated tools, cameras, keyboard monitors, mouse monitors,

105
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:19,400
input on the screen monitors, and they're then generating scores for the like manager

106
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:23,320
to review them, to get an idea of like how hard they're working to basically collect

107
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:25,400
data on what they're doing.

108
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:31,360
And this New York Times article lays out like how it started at lower wage workers.

109
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,220
But now it's lawyers, nurses.

110
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:38,640
They talk about a hospice care provider who got one point for calling the family.

111
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:42,240
She got another productivity point for like each patient she saw.

112
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:45,760
They also have some quotes from some of the makers of this monitoring software saying

113
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:48,280
that, you know, our data points aren't super accurate.

114
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:52,560
They still need refinement and probably shouldn't be used for judging people's overall performance.

115
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,680
And yet clearly it's happening.

116
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:57,520
I mean, United Health seems like one of the bigger ones they talk on here, but they mentioned

117
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:04,600
three or four different companies that are doing this with cameras, with activity monitoring.

118
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:12,720
And they also talk about the rise of mouse jigglers, ads on TikTok and Instagram where

119
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:17,180
you buy a mouse jiggler that you put on your desk and you set your mouse in the jiggler

120
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:21,100
which randomizes input to make it look like you're busy.

121
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:22,960
And they're selling like hotcakes right now.

122
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:23,960
So okay.

123
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:24,960
Right.

124
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:31,380
This is where I'm somehow meditating on our mascots, shall we say pinko commie ways.

125
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:36,920
And maybe I have been listening to some Ace of Base, so there's some Euro pop involved.

126
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:41,500
But also like my evil capitalist is like, you can certainly demand that people come

127
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:42,500
to the office.

128
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:43,500
I think it's stupid.

129
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:47,500
Like we talked about last week, if you're a small company like ours, right.

130
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:53,000
But like this middle ground of I'm going to spy on you in your home, I just feel like

131
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,560
that's, if you distrust the people that work for you that much, they shouldn't work for

132
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,560
you.

133
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:03,040
And speaking from the position of like small teams and small organizations where it's,

134
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:05,200
you know how it is, Chris, it gets super personal, right?

135
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:08,080
Like somebody has a kid, it's a big deal, right?

136
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:15,360
Like it's, you know, I just, I can't imagine, I mean, I think we both know how I would react,

137
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:20,960
but I can't even imagine asking someone to do that without feeling like a complete scumbag.

138
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:23,040
Here's some of the justification.

139
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:29,640
They say it gives them solid metrics and what they say, new found clarity.

140
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:34,800
The New York Times goes on to write, derelict workers can be rooted out, industrious ones

141
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:41,360
can be rewarded, quote, it is a way to really just focus on the results, end quote, rather

142
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,380
than the impressions.

143
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:48,520
So it's just this kind of spin of like, well, but the good employees get rewarded and it's

144
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:53,400
only really the bad employees that get worked out, which the good employees appreciate too,

145
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,920
so everyone wins.

146
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:58,680
So basically the same justification of stack ranking.

147
00:07:58,680 --> 00:07:59,680
Yeah.

148
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:00,680
And OKRs.

149
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:04,800
I mean, it's stack ranking plus taping you, I guess.

150
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:05,800
Yeah.

151
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:06,800
God.

152
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,800
You know what this is?

153
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,320
I got, I got some bacon for you, buddy.

154
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:10,320
Yeah.

155
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,880
You ready?

156
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:18,840
This is all a ploy by big hard drive to just sell more local storage because everybody's

157
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:21,720
going to the cloud and they want to sell these hard drives.

158
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:23,080
They've got, you know, these huge trucks.

159
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:27,580
So big storage is colluding with software developers.

160
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:30,080
It's Western Digital and Seagate.

161
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:33,040
They got to sell big enterprise storage because you imagine like if you're monitoring all

162
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:38,800
your employees, actually, let's be real, that's probably a cloud service, too.

163
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:40,240
There's some SaaS vendor.

164
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:44,600
So, you know, no offense, but there's some kids somewhere thinking, these guys are idiots.

165
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:49,240
I'm going to make this SaaS right now or I just, yeah, it's making me physically ill.

166
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,240
I understand.

167
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,240
All right.

168
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:53,280
Let's talk about something that gets people fired up.

169
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:54,280
GitHub versus GitLab.

170
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:59,800
And I want to make it clear that the GoToRadio program always recommends if you can host

171
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:03,960
your own infrastructure, then nobody can just disable you or do weird stuff.

172
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:04,960
Whatever.

173
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:10,200
Well, yeah, I mean, I think we're coming to a new understanding.

174
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,440
I think we're coming to a new middle ground.

175
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:15,960
And Josh writes in, hey, guys, just finished 478.

176
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:19,480
And I wanted to hype up GitHub over GitLab.

177
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:22,680
One thing I love about GitHub is its VS code integration.

178
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:25,920
If I get a bug report, I can view the report on the website.

179
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:31,880
And by pressing my period, a web version of the VS code opens up with that repo pre-imported.

180
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:36,620
I do a minor change, I push it out, and it's instantly updated without me ever leaving

181
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:38,040
the repo web page.

182
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,040
That's pretty great.

183
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:41,000
I wanted to add my three cents.

184
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Josh.

185
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:47,640
Yeah, I think the other thing that we kind of dance around, but is huge.

186
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:52,160
If you want to do an open source project, ironically, it's going to be more successful

187
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:56,320
on GitHub than on GitLab, in my opinion.

188
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,640
It's a network effect.

189
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:58,640
Simple as that.

190
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:01,340
You know, we're doing the new JB website.

191
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:05,760
And I think the fact that it's on GitHub has been a huge part of the success we're seeing

192
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:06,760
with the project.

193
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:11,600
Yeah, there's also the even like more grubby practical side of if you're someone pretty

194
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:16,960
new in your career and looking to really make some aggressive jumps in your career.

195
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,680
Recruiters now know about GitHub.

196
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:20,960
And so do internal hiring managers.

197
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:24,840
So if you have a nice beefy GitHub profile, that's going to go a long way.

198
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:25,840
Good point.

199
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:26,840
All right.

200
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:27,840
We also got an email from Stoff.

201
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:28,840
It was long.

202
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:32,860
I think I'll link it in the show notes because it's about tabs or spaces, which you brought

203
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:34,240
upon us.

204
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,880
But I did pull a little bit of it.

205
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:41,560
He wrote, essentially, tabs are idealistic and would win any argument not based on real

206
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:44,600
world, quote, not caring of humans.

207
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,660
But in reality, spaces win.

208
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:51,280
But how many spaces is the better question?

209
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:54,280
I wonder what the audience would say about two spaces.

210
00:10:54,280 --> 00:11:01,880
So, yeah, I'll put a link to this in the show notes and you guys can read the whole thing.

211
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:08,640
He says an ideal world tabs, but in the real world spaces, and he just suggests two spaces.

212
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:13,580
So we'll have a link to his whole email if you want to nerd out and see why he thinks

213
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:17,000
two spaces is the one true way to go.

214
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,920
Well, then you can let us know what you think.

215
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:23,880
I will say most beautiful feature in Python, you don't have a goddamn choice.

216
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:28,720
Reminder, meetups are coming next month.

217
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:31,840
Right about this time that you're listening, things are going to be just getting started

218
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:33,420
in Southern Oregon.

219
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:39,800
So just super quick, Southern Oregon, September 20th, Northern California, September 23rd,

220
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:45,520
JPL, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, September 29th, Southern California meetup around the

221
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:51,640
JPL area, September 30th, and then October 7th, a Portland area meetup.

222
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:53,560
It's a lot of meetups.

223
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:58,120
Along the way, we'll be stashing some geocaches with swag in them, and then we'll give hints

224
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:02,200
on the show where you can find the geocache, and then we'll also have swag on board JOOPS

225
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:04,960
we'll be bringing to the meetups and all of that.

226
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:10,660
So details are at meetup.com slash Jupiter Broadcasting, and I also invite you to join

227
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:19,360
us in our matrix room, bit.ly slash West Coast Crew, where we're chatting about details,

228
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:23,880
getting tips from locals, and then we'll also use that area for future meetups as well.

229
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:25,280
There's a lot going on.

230
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:27,480
I'll put a link to all of that in the show notes.

231
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:34,200
If you're in the Western area of the United States, we'd love to see you.

232
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,400
Linode dot com slash coder.

233
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:40,200
That's where you go to get a hundred dollars for 60 days on a new account, and it's a great

234
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,920
way to support the show.

235
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:47,240
Linode offers just the best options for developers and businesses that don't need or want the

236
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:52,080
complexities of hyperscalers and don't need all their endless options.

237
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:56,720
And yeah, there's also budget VPS providers out there, but I just wouldn't mess with that

238
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:00,720
stuff, not if it's something that matters, not if it's something that's for my business

239
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:04,440
or my data is important or my availability is important or support's important if I ever

240
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:05,440
get stuck.

241
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:10,120
There's a lot of reasons to choose Linode, but their nearly 19 year track record has

242
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,760
got to be one of them.

243
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:16,840
Incredible uptime over that 19 years, always innovating on making the network faster and

244
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:17,840
more capacity.

245
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:21,800
They've got 11 data centers around the world for you to choose from, and then a bunch of

246
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:27,720
really nice backend features that are just implemented nice and easily, like object storage,

247
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:31,280
backups, simple snapshots, an API that goes for days.

248
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:32,340
You can do all kinds of stuff.

249
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:36,760
My favorite little hot tip is put the Linode command line client on your box and do a snapshot

250
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:39,880
right there on your box before you make any changes.

251
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:43,960
There's so many things though I love about Linode besides just the performance, the great

252
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:44,960
support.

253
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:48,800
There's also a huge community, and tons of my friends from open source projects around

254
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,160
the world are using Linode.

255
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:55,440
Linode sponsors a lot of the infrastructure for open source.

256
00:13:55,440 --> 00:14:00,160
And of course, Linode is making it possible for us to go on our west coast road tour this

257
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,400
year to meet up with a whole bunch of you.

258
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:06,480
So if you're in the area, make sure you come see us because we'll have some Linode swag

259
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,320
on board that we're giving away.

260
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:11,840
And I've been told it's very cool brand new swag.

261
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:15,420
But on top of that, it's just the best place to run something on Linux.

262
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:20,380
Don't get locked into those esoteric hyperscalers, don't get fooled by the budget VPS providers

263
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:22,560
who will inevitably disappoint you.

264
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,000
Go get the real thing.

265
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,800
The folks that have been building for 19 years and only getting better and better as they

266
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:28,800
do it.

267
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,680
And why not get $100 while you try it?

268
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:35,800
Support the show and get 100 bucks to try out Linode when you go to linode.com slash

269
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:37,360
coder.

270
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,360
One more time.

271
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:43,040
It's linode.com slash coder.

272
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:48,360
We may finally see a light at the end of the electron tunnel.

273
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:51,760
I'm not saying electrons dead.

274
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:56,280
But this might be a critical flaw that they can never solve.

275
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:59,400
And maybe in a decade, it'll force people off of electron.

276
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,400
I don't know.

277
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,960
But you know, it's black hat season.

278
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:06,160
So we're hearing about lots of exploits and researchers have found remote code execution

279
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:12,600
vulnerabilities in basically all of the major electron based applications, Discord, teams,

280
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:14,440
Slack, you name it, right?

281
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:15,760
Surprise, surprise.

282
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,400
And here's the core flaw.

283
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:20,640
These particular issues they found have been patched.

284
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:22,560
Some of these they found like a year ago.

285
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:28,640
But the fundamental issue is, surprise, surprise, they write in the research, quote, this occurs

286
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:32,180
because of the way ElectronJS is designed.

287
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:38,560
And in the fundamental design issue within the framework, ElectronJS and Chromium that

288
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:44,760
they've branched is always behind the main normal Chrome browser, i.e.

289
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:51,700
Electron is always two or three months behind any upstream fix in Chromium at best.

290
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:57,800
Then you have applications like Discord that are actually shipping a version of Electron

291
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:00,200
that's been end of life for a while.

292
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:04,520
And they're just like patching it like animals to keep it running.

293
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:08,080
And they just will never be able to solve this problem because this is just the nature

294
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:09,560
of the way this project works.

295
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:11,440
It's downstream of Chromium.

296
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:17,520
And they've changed it significantly enough that there is inherently a delay between when

297
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:21,200
the bug fix goes out in Chromium and when it goes in your Electron app.

298
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:24,320
And you know, the Discord developers, they try to jump in and say, look, when we found

299
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:28,520
out about these vulnerabilities, we had it patched within like 42 hours.

300
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:29,520
Like look at us.

301
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:33,240
But you know, like, OK, you got one of probably hundreds of vulnerabilities.

302
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:37,360
And it seems to me this is just inherent with Electron apps.

303
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,360
There's no way around it.

304
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:40,280
So not only is it not a great experience.

305
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:44,400
Not only are we still not seeing the performance and memory usage that we'd like to see, it's

306
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:45,520
still an issue.

307
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:47,520
But now you have this fundamental way it's designed.

308
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:50,160
It seems like this is always going to be a security issue.

309
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:55,480
Do you think long term this could force people's hand to move to something else?

310
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:57,600
Microsoft's working on Electron replacement.

311
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,000
Don't know if it wouldn't have these problems.

312
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:05,120
But if you could port, if you could move, if you think about the technologies being

313
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:09,940
used here, it actually should be fundamentally possible to rip out the Chromium stuff from

314
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:12,320
Electron and put something else in there.

315
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:13,320
Yeah.

316
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:18,160
So, OK, one, this is not going to stop people from using Electron.

317
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:23,120
You're sacrificing a lot to use Electron to gain development speed and cross-platformness.

318
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:28,520
I would definitely caution the dunking on Electron, especially from my Linux community,

319
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:30,880
because you wouldn't have the applications without it.

320
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:36,840
And that's just probably true of a lot of Mac applications, too, at this juncture now.

321
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:42,300
With that all said, you could have we don't have it in the notes for this week, but there

322
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:49,280
is a big post by the Dino team on how they're kind of probably moving further from Node

323
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:50,280
for reasons.

324
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:51,280
Right.

325
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:52,280
We don't need to super go into it.

326
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:57,440
It's not not a framework that I use a lot, but I could see something like that where,

327
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:03,960
you know, whatever the Electron replacement is, is effectively a compatibility thing,

328
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:08,400
and then eventually replaces it a good example of this on the mobile side, if you're doing

329
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:14,920
cross-platform is Cordova, which is well deprecated and something like Capacitor, which does have

330
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:20,740
Cordova backwards compatibility, i.e. you can use Cordova plugins.

331
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:22,420
I don't know.

332
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:24,960
And I'm usually like not Microsoft bacony.

333
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:31,540
I am not sure that a Microsoft Electron replacement would necessarily be as different as maybe

334
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:36,720
it sounds, because it would certainly be like an edge base, which is itself Chromium based.

335
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:40,960
Now maybe edge and Chrome are going to diverge.

336
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:43,440
That's certainly possible, right?

337
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:48,380
Again, I just don't see this not being a problem based on anything that's architected like

338
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:55,920
this, where you are modifying a very large, very complex upstream project, and you simply

339
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:56,920
can't keep up.

340
00:18:56,920 --> 00:19:01,460
I mean, if anybody who's done mobile dev for a long time knows that all these cross-platform

341
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:06,360
frameworks are beautiful, except like if you really, really want to be there day one and

342
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:10,340
have like the hottest new Apple thing to try to get featured on the store, that becomes

343
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:14,680
real touch and go in Dicey, and it goes the same for security stuff, right?

344
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:20,600
When your project that you're dependent on is following at a lagging pace, not through

345
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:25,520
any fault of their own, but through just the way stuff works, a upstream project, you're

346
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:27,600
always going to have these things.

347
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:34,160
And I don't think the value proposition that Electron or something Electron-like brings

348
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:38,620
is ever going to be defeated at this juncture.

349
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:42,540
Certainly not if the alternative is everything is either literally, I mean, I think the more

350
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:48,120
likely scenario is people just run their web apps in actual Chrome, right, or edge, and

351
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,120
maybe Safari.

352
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:54,120
I mean, I prefer the Electron wrappers because I like the native notifications on both Mac

353
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:55,120
and GNOME.

354
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:57,760
And I like having it its own process, its own window.

355
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:02,280
Right, because, you know, Squadcast likes to just take down your Chrome window, right?

356
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:05,280
We use apps that like break browsers sometimes.

357
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:10,400
That's what the developer and researcher of these flaws said, quote, if you're paranoid,

358
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:15,120
I recommend using the website itself because then you have the protection of the latest

359
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,120
Chromium.

360
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:19,600
Also, it's sandboxing and all of that, which is much larger than Electron.

361
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:23,160
So you could use a lot of these apps just in the browser and not use the Electron app

362
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:26,000
and benefit from the more updated security in the browser itself.

363
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:30,960
Yeah, I mean, I, you know, it would be not the worst idea.

364
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:33,960
I just like my little Slack, you know, doc icon, right?

365
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:36,720
I like to be able to, you know, tap around to the different applications.

366
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:39,960
Well, and maybe this is something the operating system should be solving.

367
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:44,080
You know, I think of like Fedora Silverblue and NixOS, which are immutable.

368
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:48,720
And so even if, you know, the browser or the or Electron app just goes crazy and starts

369
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:53,360
trashing your system, at best it could read your home directory, but it couldn't really

370
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:55,160
make any permanent changes to the system.

371
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:58,840
It couldn't install itself and run in the background after you reboot, it'd be gone.

372
00:20:58,840 --> 00:20:59,840
Right?

373
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:00,840
Yeah.

374
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:05,200
I mean, but how many years that people just run Flash and it didn't matter, right?

375
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,200
And it was super obscure.

376
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:11,640
I'm just saying the value prop from like you're an enterprise IT manager, you need to hire

377
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:16,280
some dev shop or some contractor to write you an application.

378
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:19,000
I mean, I would be more than happy to write you three.

379
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,320
It'd be great.

380
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,600
That sounds fun.

381
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:26,360
The only thing I'll say maybe in defense of Microsoft having an alternative is they have

382
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:29,360
done a hell of a job with VS Code.

383
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:30,920
And Edge is pretty impressive.

384
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:33,440
It's my day-to-day browser when I'm on POP.

385
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:39,220
So I don't know, maybe their alternative would, what a world.

386
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:43,620
So now your development tool chain is basically VS Code and your target environment becomes

387
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:45,120
a Microsoft based framework.

388
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,120
Yeah.

389
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:47,120
And then you go run it on Azure.

390
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:51,160
I was going to say, are we having flashbacks yet?

391
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:54,680
Funny how all these roads lead to Azure.

392
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:56,480
I wonder what the audience thinks.

393
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:59,560
Here's what you said Flash, it's exactly what it made me think of.

394
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:03,840
So let us know, coder.show slash contact or send us in a boost.

395
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:06,280
I feel like this is its Flash moment.

396
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:13,000
The very beginning of what took a decade is we started discovering fundamental issues

397
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:17,160
that were obvious in some cases, but we just hadn't realized or in other cases we didn't

398
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:18,160
know.

399
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:20,520
We start discovering these just, oh man, there's no fixing this.

400
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:22,760
Oh man, another one, there's no fixing this.

401
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:24,320
And it took a decade of that.

402
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:29,200
And at the end of that decade and a lot of help from Steve Jobs, we finally freed ourselves

403
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,200
from Flash.

404
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:31,200
Yes.

405
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:37,240
When Uncle Steve took his double barrel shotgun and took old Flashy out behind the shed.

406
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:41,360
Nobody wrote those blog posts or whatever, the open letter, whatever he called them.

407
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:47,880
It's in terms of a tech CEO who could write in plain language and make you kind of understand

408
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:50,560
their position.

409
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:55,760
That Steve Jobs note on Flash, I think is, I don't think any other CEO in tech right

410
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:58,840
now does something, anything like that.

411
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:02,660
Musk does his own newer version, which really seems to piss people off, but Jobs did too

412
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:03,660
I suppose.

413
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:08,920
Yeah, but like, I don't know, Musk has not eliminated a basically web development standard.

414
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:12,000
So I will say Flash, I had mixed feelings on what died.

415
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:17,120
Adobe Air, which is probably the closer like analogy to Electron, and if you know what

416
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:21,640
Adobe Air is, I am very sorry, really, really deserved to die.

417
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:23,200
Oh yeah.

418
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,720
Silverlight, that sure was a hot distraction.

419
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:27,200
That was a hot mess.

420
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:31,780
And remember running Netflix on Linux was, oh, you have to download this really shady

421
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:33,360
mono version of Silverlight.

422
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:35,160
Yeah, that was so bad, man.

423
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:36,680
That was such a bad time.

424
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:40,640
And you can't have 1080p because something, something codex, right?

425
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:41,640
Like yeah.

426
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:46,720
And it just felt like Microsoft wanted a piece of that hot Flash action, and so they created

427
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:47,880
Silverlight.

428
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:51,280
I feel like you just said Microsoft wanted to go through menopause.

429
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:56,600
All right, I want to talk about something before we move on that I thought would be

430
00:23:56,600 --> 00:24:00,560
one story when it first broke, and this happened last week after the show.

431
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:05,040
And then by the time we sat down to record, I have a totally different position on this

432
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:06,040
story.

433
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:10,040
Telegram went to war last week, and you and I both use Telegram a bit.

434
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:16,880
The founder of Telegram took to his channel and just blasted the App Store review, saying

435
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:22,300
that Apple is holding back technology that will, quote, revolutionize how people express

436
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:24,160
themselves in messaging.

437
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:29,160
He goes on to say, quote, it has been stuck in Apple's review for two weeks without explanation

438
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:31,400
or feedback provided by Apple.

439
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:37,240
Turns out there was some feedback, but he, he didn't disclose that at the time, but anyways,

440
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:43,620
he goes on to say, quote, if Telegram, one of the top 10 most popular apps globally,

441
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:49,200
is receiving this treatment, one can only imagine the difficulties expressed by smaller

442
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,200
app developers.

443
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:52,520
Wait a minute, where have I heard this before?

444
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:58,640
It's not just demoralizing, it causes direct financial losses to hundreds of thousands

445
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:01,920
of mobile apps globally.

446
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:04,680
And he just put Apple on blast, right?

447
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:05,760
So why did he go to war?

448
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:06,880
What was it they were holding back?

449
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:07,880
What was this new?

450
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:10,120
They were censoring his ideological beliefs.

451
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:11,120
Nope, nope.

452
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:12,320
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

453
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:15,880
They were demanding monies he was making outside of the App Store.

454
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:20,840
The new revolutionary technology he was shipping was 3D emojis, and they were based on the

455
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:27,200
Apple trademark emojis, and according to the App Store guideline 5.2.5, third-party developers

456
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:32,640
cannot create apps that are confusingly similar to Apple's existing product, and in that guideline,

457
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:37,760
Apple implicitly makes it clear you cannot replicate the Apple emoji design.

458
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:40,320
And so that's why they were holding it up.

459
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:42,200
So there's two very funny things here.

460
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:49,300
One, there was some lawyer at Apple who was like, hang on, I love emoji, and we are defending

461
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:52,240
this IP to the death.

462
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:58,160
And then this guy, who I like Telegram, good product, is also like risking his own product

463
00:25:58,160 --> 00:25:59,880
because of emoji.

464
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:03,120
Can't you just like use the Unicode ones?

465
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:04,120
Or is it because they're 3D?

466
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:10,040
Yeah, they had to, I guess, create new ones, but I, for me, it's the arrogance of saying

467
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:13,920
this is a revolutionary new feature and how dare Apple, blah, blah, blah, blah, and it

468
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:16,400
turns out to be animated emojis.

469
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:21,520
And this, by the way, is part of a bigger story where Telegram is rolling out premium

470
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:27,160
features, but the premium features they're rolling out suck, they're dumb, and nobody

471
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:29,360
wants them, and it's wild.

472
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:31,440
I've never really seen anything like this go down.

473
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:32,880
Chris, this is a safe space.

474
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,840
Tell us what you really think.

475
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:41,260
If Telegram would have implemented status, so I could say I'm recording, or I'm away,

476
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:46,320
or I'm traveling, I'm driving right now, kind of like you can do in Slack, if they would

477
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:50,240
have implemented that in Telegram as a member feature, I'd pay nine bucks a month for that

478
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,240
right there.

479
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:52,880
You can't use Telegram, right?

480
00:26:52,880 --> 00:27:00,760
Instead, it's like stupid pictures and stickers and 3D emojis and just stuff that nobody wants,

481
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:05,760
and I've really kind of been impressed because I've read different Telegram groups, I've

482
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:11,160
read different Reddit posts on this, I've read different threads on reply comments like

483
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:17,800
this article on 9to5Mac, and universally, universally, it's clear that the Telegram

484
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:20,560
user base doesn't want any of this.

485
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:22,560
It's all just stupid.

486
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:27,000
It's a fascinating thing to watch, an app fall like this, because first they wanted

487
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:30,360
to do some stupid crypto ICO scam.

488
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:33,160
I was going to say, wasn't there like a weird crypto thing?

489
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:37,200
That was a horrible idea and would have taken the app in a terrible direction, but because

490
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:41,320
of regulatory concerns, they bailed on that because they got a big old warning on that,

491
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:46,880
and so then they pivoted to membership, but the member features are so lame that nobody's

492
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:51,080
going to sign up for this thing, and the cost to run this Telegram service, the storage

493
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:55,520
alone, is astronomical.

494
00:27:55,520 --> 00:28:01,280
I'm told it's millions and millions and millions and millions of dollars a month, so I've never

495
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:07,660
really witnessed an app blow this bad in a while, and then to also at the same time go

496
00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:15,060
to war with Apple over an obvious violation of their App Store guideline is essentially

497
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:21,000
punching the person who feeds you in the face, because Telegram is nothing if it's not on

498
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,720
iOS or on Android.

499
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:30,500
It is absolutely totally dependent on these two major duopolies, and he's going off saying

500
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:34,640
that they're holding back revolutionary new communications technology when it turns out

501
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:38,920
he was ripping off their emojis, which maybe, you know, maybe should Apple be defending

502
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:39,920
that?

503
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:40,920
I don't know, but the guidelines, they make it clear.

504
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:43,640
They specifically mention the emojis.

505
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:47,360
You know, I'm always happy to dunk on the App Store review team.

506
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:51,060
In this case, I'm like, ah, no, right?

507
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:52,060
It's silly.

508
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:56,160
I hate, like, K, K, oof, Kaepovic in the chat?

509
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:57,160
KP.

510
00:28:57,160 --> 00:29:01,120
KP is saying in the chat, you know, basically they gave away most of the goods for free.

511
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:03,600
I have a feeling that's kind of what's happening here.

512
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:06,880
They need to monetize a bit more, and it's just real hard to do that.

513
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:10,920
Well, I think it's clear it's hard to add new features, because instead what they're

514
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:15,680
doing is they're giving you lipstick, and I want, like, new functionality.

515
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:16,960
I want to pay for functionality.

516
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:21,060
Like I said, one simple idea, status.

517
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:22,060
Let me set a status.

518
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:24,160
That's all I'm asking for.

519
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:25,160
Let me set my status.

520
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:27,760
I could see how that's simple to say and hard to implement.

521
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:29,240
I bet there's all, yeah.

522
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:31,120
Right, but that's why it's worth paying for.

523
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:32,560
It's tough to make money on the App Store.

524
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:37,000
I don't know, I feel like we've been, like, I like the indignation, but then the fact

525
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,560
that it's about emoji, I'm kind of, you know.

526
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:45,280
I guess this is my theme today, but I'm looking at this, I'm thinking, you look at his hostile

527
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:51,640
relationship with the teat that feeds him, and you look at this totally boondockled membership

528
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:57,460
rollout, and I think Telegram's going to have ads soon, Telegram's going downhill.

529
00:29:57,460 --> 00:29:58,960
It's time to leave, baby.

530
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:02,640
Switch to Matrix, because I think Telegram, it's not tomorrow, but I think it's going

531
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:03,640
to turn to crap.

532
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:10,800
Or, you know, maybe IRC will just be the cockroach that survives and everything.

533
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:13,080
Tailscale.com slash coder.

534
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:17,040
My favorite part in the show right here when I get to tell you about Tailscale.

535
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:20,140
Honestly, Tailscale, Tailscale, Tailscale.

536
00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:23,120
It's so great, I wish we could do every show about it.

537
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:28,600
It's a zero-config VPN that installs on any device, regardless of architecture or platform,

538
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:32,500
takes care of your firewall rules, takes care of your double-nats if you got some.

539
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:40,480
You can quickly and easily create a flat mesh VPN protected by WireGuard's noise protocol.

540
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:45,160
So you get the best VPN encryption in the business with the ease of management that

541
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:47,480
Tailscale brings on top of that.

542
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:49,020
It's the combination of these two things.

543
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:53,560
It's like, Tailscale is taking VPNs out of the uncanny valley.

544
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:58,240
You know, they're doing that last 10% that the rest of the world needed, and now I am

545
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:02,800
seeing announcement after announcement of different projects that are integrated in

546
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:03,800
Tailscale support.

547
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:08,600
So you can put applications, individual applications and services, on your Tailscale network.

548
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:13,480
It's so incredible because Tailscale is just this solution that, on its surface, seems

549
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:15,080
immensely simple.

550
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:20,160
But on the back end, they do a lot of really creative magic to make a mesh VPN network

551
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:23,520
that just works all the time, and doesn't do silly routing when you're accidentally

552
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:26,000
sending the wrong traffic over that VPN.

553
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:30,320
And they introduce nice features like Tailscale Send, which is basically like AirDrop for

554
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:32,320
your entire Tailscale network.

555
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:36,160
And they've recently rolled out Tailscale SSH, which allows you to establish connections

556
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:40,700
between your devices in your Tailscale network, authorized by the Tailscale controls, which

557
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:41,700
are great.

558
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:42,700
You can manage SSH.

559
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:44,480
Well, you don't have to manage SSH keys.

560
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:45,920
That's kind of the thing.

561
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:51,360
Tailscale manages the SSH keys, and then it authenticates your SSH connection using WireGuard.

562
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:55,640
Yes, like my two favorite things come together in Tailscale.

563
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:58,000
There was a time before I synced my files, right?

564
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,400
There was a time before I had broadband.

565
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:04,160
There was a time before I had decent portability in a laptop.

566
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:08,400
And now I'm going to look back and remember a time before I had Tailscale.

567
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:10,380
That's the kind of game changer.

568
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:13,320
That's the kind of workflow improvement you get with Tailscale.

569
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:17,400
So the fact that you can go to tailscale.com slash coda right now, and try it for free

570
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:21,800
up to 20 devices while you support the show, I don't know, kind of feels like peak awesome

571
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:22,960
to me.

572
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:26,900
This is one of those moments where a new technology comes around, and podcasting is around, and

573
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:31,080
we all get to kind of just be in the same spot at the same time, and I'm very excited

574
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:32,240
to watch this company go.

575
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:35,000
And I very much recommend you try out Tailscale.

576
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,080
I think you're going to be blown away.

577
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:38,500
You'll never switch to any other VPN.

578
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:39,500
This is it.

579
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:40,500
You're done now.

580
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:41,760
You've got yourself a flat mesh network.

581
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:43,000
You're welcome.

582
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,800
Tailscale.com slash coder.

583
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:50,780
All right, well, here's where Apple's activity gets a little sketch.

584
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:53,720
Here's a little mob boss to me.

585
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:59,140
Reports are coming out from the Wall Street Journal that Apple contacted Facebook and

586
00:32:59,140 --> 00:33:02,960
wanted a little bit of cuts from some of their new services they were rolling out.

587
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:07,560
They wanted a little taste back in 2016, like the promoted posts in Facebook.

588
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:10,160
I just want to wet my beak, Mark.

589
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:11,800
Just my beak, okay?

590
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:13,160
It was interesting the way they did it.

591
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:16,920
They say like, you know, we feel like we should be getting our 30% from this.

592
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:19,400
Of course, Facebook pushes back on that.

593
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:28,120
And it created what seems like this really sour relationship between Apple and Facebook.

594
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:32,680
Yeah, I mean, sure.

595
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:35,680
Nobody likes getting shaken down, even, you know, the bad guys.

596
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:38,880
I've just, I don't know.

597
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:44,380
Is it not pretty clear that in a slowing growth environment, Apple and most other big multinationals

598
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:47,160
goal is to extract more revenue per user?

599
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:50,160
So they wanted a share of the promoted ad sales.

600
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:51,520
That okay, it doesn't surprise us.

601
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:54,960
But to help put it in perspective, because you and I have talked about this so much that

602
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:59,700
we're completely just it's all it's all sort of a hodgepodge now.

603
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:03,240
But Ben Thompson did a decent little timeline in Sir Techery, which I'll have a link to

604
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:04,240
in the show notes.

605
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:06,400
But I grabbed a little bit of audio from his podcast.

606
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:10,020
Apple had discussions with Facebook between 2016 and 2018.

607
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:13,000
Apple had similar discussions with another ad supported company sometime before June

608
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,360
2020.

609
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:18,720
Apple systematically moved against consumer SaaS apps in 2019 and early 2020, halting

610
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:21,520
updates unless they incorporated an app purchase.

611
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:25,240
Apple blocked hay updates in May 2020 due to the lack of an app purchase.

612
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:27,760
Apple announced AT&T in June 2020.

613
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:32,800
One more relevant date, Apple unveiled its services narrative in January 2016.

614
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:37,200
Taken as a whole, it is very hard to come up with any explanation beyond the obvious.

615
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:40,360
Apple embarked on an aggressive campaign to boost its app store revenue.

616
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:44,060
It started by looking for money from Facebook, the most obvious place to start giving Facebook

617
00:34:44,060 --> 00:34:46,340
symbiotic relationship with the app store.

618
00:34:46,340 --> 00:34:49,920
It extended that campaign to other ad supported apps, then started cracking down on consumer

619
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:50,920
SaaS companies.

620
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:55,080
Finally, it announced AT&T that kneecapped the entire ad supported app economy.

621
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:59,600
So we remember when the AT&T stuff, the app tracking stuff landed.

622
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:05,480
And now we have seen it's put huge, huge dampers on the sales of Facebook and others, billions

623
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:06,480
of dollars.

624
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:10,520
It's cost them billions of dollars, for better or for worse, who cares, right?

625
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:12,240
But here's the interesting element.

626
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:17,600
Bloomberg is reporting, Mark Gurman is reporting, that Apple is testing adding ads into maps,

627
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:20,520
books, and podcast apps built into iOS.

628
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:28,320
Mark, Mark, my son, that's such a nice ad generated business you have there.

629
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:32,760
It'd be a shame if the platform vendor, I don't know, did their own ads, you know?

630
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:37,280
Why don't you pay me a 30% and I am making sure this doesn't happen to you?

631
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:39,080
Here's why this matters.

632
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:43,200
This is, I think, a super strong signal and we have lots of links in the show notes.

633
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:48,920
This is super strong signal about the iPhone sales collapse thesis that we had on the show

634
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:50,060
a while ago.

635
00:35:50,060 --> 00:35:56,880
And that is, if the economy slows and luxury devices like iPhone sales begin to slow, Apple

636
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:59,520
will have to seek revenue from other places.

637
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:04,040
Apple is very careful in how they monitor the economy and they monitor sales and how

638
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:05,600
they project all of this.

639
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:07,400
And I'm sure they recognize this.

640
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:11,120
In 2016, they announced their intention to focus on services.

641
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:15,880
That's when they begin to shake down companies like Meta and Netflix and Amazon and small

642
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:17,900
developers that we don't get to hear from.

643
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:19,680
That's when the shakedowns begin to occur.

644
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:25,000
They extract the maximum amount of revenue from people between 2016 and 2020.

645
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:29,480
Then they launch the app tracking stuff that kills the revenue tracking for companies like

646
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:30,480
Facebook and Google.

647
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:31,480
Good.

648
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:32,480
I don't care.

649
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:37,280
Now, they're announcing, well, now they're not announcing, now they're testing doing

650
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:38,800
their own ad platform.

651
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:43,680
So they took away a huge part of the app ecosystem that developers use to monetize their apps

652
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:45,340
because that's what we're talking about.

653
00:36:45,340 --> 00:36:47,600
That's what this tracking technology is used for.

654
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:52,880
It's used to put ads in the apps to monetize the app to pay for development.

655
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:53,880
That's what it's for.

656
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:57,000
Sometimes it's Facebook and sometimes it's a small developer.

657
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:01,840
Apple took that ecosystem away and now they're beginning to sell their own alternative and

658
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:05,600
they're going to begin baking it into their own apps because the iPhone sales are going

659
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:10,880
down and so they're going to monetize existing iPhone users by blasting ads in their face.

660
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:15,420
I'm sure Apple will do it probably better than most, but the reality is they have first

661
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:20,660
party access to that data so they can mine the results to do accurate ad serving and

662
00:37:20,660 --> 00:37:26,320
they're in a position to profit from a situation that they created.

663
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:31,440
Now I think we have a pretty clear timeline of how all of this has gone down and it's

664
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:33,160
hook, line, and sinker.

665
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:35,080
This has been their motive all along.

666
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:40,240
All of the smokescreen about privacy, it's all just been to sell this thing, to put them

667
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:44,280
in this position, to be essentially their own dominant ad supplier.

668
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:46,900
They don't want to give that action to anybody else.

669
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:47,960
It's a power move really.

670
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:54,600
They hobbled the ecosystem, they got everybody, basically they just bulldozed all of the real

671
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:59,600
estate and now they're building their own Apple city on it and they already have people

672
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:00,600
coming in.

673
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:08,840
It's a remarkably savvy move, but it feels a little evil because they are using the pretense

674
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:14,160
of protecting their users and Apple doing the best thing for their customers and privacy

675
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:15,160
first.

676
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:19,920
They're using that pretense to essentially do all of this and I find that gross.

677
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:24,080
I didn't buy an iPhone to have ads in my apps.

678
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:28,360
If I wanted that, I would have got an Android phone and I think ultimately, even if they're

679
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:31,800
done in a subtle, clean way or whatever they're going to say.

680
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:34,440
The tasteful way, is this the playboy of ads that we're going?

681
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:35,440
Right.

682
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:37,080
Yeah, they're going to do tasteful ads.

683
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:43,920
Even if it's tasteful ads, it's still an $1,100 phone that has ads now.

684
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:49,920
The transaction of $1,100 every year, every two years or every five years or whatever,

685
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:55,520
that should be enough, but Apple is such a huge monster corporation now that they can't

686
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:56,520
stop there.

687
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:59,080
They can't stop and just sell you the hardware like that was the old deal.

688
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:03,280
The old deal was Apple sells the hardware and then they don't have to worry about monetizing

689
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:04,280
you after the fact.

690
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:06,020
That's not true anymore.

691
00:39:06,020 --> 00:39:07,020
They're too big.

692
00:39:07,020 --> 00:39:08,020
They're too rich.

693
00:39:08,020 --> 00:39:11,520
They need more revenue and you're not making enough money to buy iPhones anymore, so they

694
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:16,480
got to figure out another way to do it and that they've seen coming since 2016.

695
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:19,800
They've been arranging all of this and if you don't think Apple is capable of that,

696
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:22,320
I think you're underselling how savvy they can be.

697
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:25,760
Gracie, Gracie, Gracie, my cousin, let me explain to you.

698
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:29,320
I don't know which mob I'm supposed to be in now, but I like this voice and we're going

699
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:31,320
to use it for a minute.

700
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:37,040
You see, we have a Mr. Gigi Ping and a Mr. Joe Biden and they have what they call recession

701
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:38,240
and they put me in box.

702
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:44,780
I'm Russian now apparently and in box I need up to the right revenue at all times.

703
00:39:44,780 --> 00:39:50,840
So now I screw Mark Zuckerberg, which really, come on, look at that beautiful face.

704
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:52,760
How could you resist?

705
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:54,120
And I take all the ad money.

706
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:56,680
What is wrong with this in Soviet Russia?

707
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:58,720
We do this like on Tuesday, right?

708
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:03,160
And I suppose if you're uploading a video on YouTube, you're using Google's ad platform

709
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:07,040
and if you're on Android, you're likely going to use Google's ad platform.

710
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:10,960
So it's just sort of what all the other platforms are doing.

711
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:15,360
Is this like not the same as just saying you can't have streaming game services because

712
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:17,760
we want to screw them out of 30 percent individually?

713
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:20,200
So I mean, it's the exact same move.

714
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:24,000
It's just well, there was part of me when I read this and again, we'll have the links

715
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,120
to the Wall Street Journal and the others in the show notes.

716
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:31,880
I read this and I thought, so Facebook aka Meta back in 2016 and 2017.

717
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:32,880
It's still Facebook.

718
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:33,880
Let's not give them that.

719
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:34,880
They pushed back, right?

720
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:38,560
And they're like, no, we're not going to give you a 30 percent cut of our promoted Facebook

721
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:39,560
post.

722
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:40,560
That's crazy.

723
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:43,880
And I think in a way, this was Apple's response.

724
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:48,040
All right, well, then we'll just crush your market on our devices, right?

725
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:52,440
They're like, you either give us a cut or we're going to crush your market.

726
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:57,160
The most valuable per user, you know, group of people you could possibly find.

727
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:58,160
Yeah, it sucks.

728
00:40:58,160 --> 00:40:59,560
I mean, I don't know.

729
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:01,680
I kind of wish everybody would lose here.

730
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:02,680
Right.

731
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:03,680
It's possible.

732
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:06,480
Well, ultimately, you got to wonder, I mean, how does this play out?

733
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:07,480
Right.

734
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:10,960
I mean, Apple will get skewered for building it.

735
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:12,040
They'll get skewered.

736
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:13,920
But Google is going to be more scummy.

737
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:14,920
Facebook's just awful.

738
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:19,940
I mean, the truth is, they are going to be fine.

739
00:41:19,940 --> 00:41:21,240
This is going to work to a point.

740
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:26,260
And if their ads are subtle enough, the only thing maybe is just the hardcore strong arming

741
00:41:26,260 --> 00:41:27,260
they do.

742
00:41:27,260 --> 00:41:28,840
They could get some regulation.

743
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:31,080
But that's only from the mascot in the EU.

744
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:34,240
That's never going to happen here.

745
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:35,240
That's true.

746
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:36,240
Maybe the EU will save us.

747
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:40,520
Oh, God, I can't believe I'm saying that.

748
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:42,800
Okay, I just can't.

749
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:43,800
I don't know.

750
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:44,800
I just can't even with this.

751
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:48,520
Again, the Stratechery post that I'll have linked in the notes was really good.

752
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:55,940
I wish that the M1 chips and I wish that the iPhone hardware and I wish that iOS wasn't

753
00:41:55,940 --> 00:41:59,400
better than all of the Android stuff.

754
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:03,520
I wish it wasn't the case because I'd love to just put these mother effers in my rearview

755
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:08,560
mirror and just laugh as they make these mistakes because I can clearly see where this is going.

756
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:10,600
It's obvious where this is headed.

757
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:13,280
It's been obvious since 2016 when they announced services.

758
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:17,120
And I said it in the Dakota Radio the week they announced it that this is where it was

759
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:19,240
going back in 2016.

760
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:20,580
It's been obvious the entire time.

761
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:26,080
But what we have now is we have the leaked emails and calls that shows us they actually

762
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:29,200
did try to get a piece of the action.

763
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:32,400
And when they didn't get their piece of the action, well, they played hardball and they

764
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:33,400
ran them out of town.

765
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:35,200
And now they're building in their spot.

766
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:36,200
We just...

767
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:37,200
Wow.

768
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:39,760
I mean, I'm pretty sure that's basically what happens if anything gets big enough on the

769
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:40,760
App Store.

770
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:41,760
Right?

771
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:42,760
First, they come to you with a smile.

772
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:44,680
There's another Bob movie reference.

773
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:49,160
And then they, you know, they put a dead fish in your bed or a horse head or whichever you

774
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:50,160
prefer.

775
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:51,160
I mean, you know what it makes that?

776
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:52,160
It makes Sherlocking quaint.

777
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:54,400
It was like quaint when Apple would Sherlock you.

778
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:57,800
Oh, Sherlocking was like accidental killing of third party utilities.

779
00:42:57,800 --> 00:42:58,800
This...

780
00:42:58,800 --> 00:42:59,800
Or maybe not.

781
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:00,800
Yeah.

782
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:01,800
Now they will just devastate a market for you.

783
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:05,280
They'll just bulldoze the entire thing.

784
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:08,360
You could say they're the new Microsoft in a lot of ways.

785
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:09,360
Boost to Graham.

786
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:10,360
All right.

787
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:11,360
Well, I got to...

788
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:12,360
We got to turn things around.

789
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:14,120
So thank you everybody who sends in a boost.

790
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:19,640
We're doing 2000 sats and above to get read on the show, but we read 100 percent of them.

791
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:23,400
And Zurno sent in a boost with 2020 sats.

792
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:25,480
He says, I fixed my username now.

793
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:27,720
I was Magenta Eagle last time.

794
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:31,180
And he's got a note for anybody who wants to troll Mike in the future because he made

795
00:43:31,180 --> 00:43:33,120
this mistake and he's passing it along.

796
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:37,240
Make sure you realize and understand Mike's licensing preferences first.

797
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:39,520
Otherwise, he may just end up agreeing with you.

798
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:40,520
Ha ha.

799
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:41,520
You got him.

800
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:44,000
You didn't even mean to and you got him.

801
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,680
We got a double boost from Zurno, too.

802
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:51,080
Could you take a moment away from relevant languages and talk about how the original

803
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:56,040
roller coaster tycoon was 99 percent x86 assembly?

804
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:57,960
Who says assembly is not relevant?

805
00:43:57,960 --> 00:43:59,920
I am a ROM fan.

806
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:06,200
So I have like a bunch of Super Nintendo and SNES or NES ROMs and they're so small.

807
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:08,720
They're so tiny.

808
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:12,880
It's incredible how how fun those games are like Super Mario World in just such a tiny

809
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:14,080
amount of space.

810
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:16,440
Some really good YouTube watching it.

811
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:21,040
There's some videos that talk about the crazy ass tricks that developers had to pull off

812
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:23,760
to get stuff running on boxes that low end.

813
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:26,600
It's it's a really good read if you're if you're into it.

814
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:27,600
All right.

815
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:33,120
We got a boost from wooden 501 coming in hot with the blue 3000 sats.

816
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:38,400
Can we talk about GitHub's absolutely trash, nonexistent ability to organize your repos?

817
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:41,900
I don't want a massive flat list of repos that I have to search through via typing or

818
00:44:41,900 --> 00:44:46,880
scrolling every time I want to find that one repo, I need to take a look at it real quick.

819
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:50,880
That is the sole reason I decided to use the free GitLab service instead of GitHub for

820
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:52,920
my personal projects.

821
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:55,880
I also have a little bit of complaints about the organization.

822
00:44:55,880 --> 00:44:59,840
Yeah, this feels this has always been a problem at GitHub why they don't have a way to group

823
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:04,320
your repos by like, you know, customer overarching project.

824
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:08,800
I have to think there's something deep in the data model there where they just screwed

825
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:13,280
themselves into a corner, because effectively their version of this is organizations.

826
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:17,160
But like you might have one organization where you let's say manage I don't know all your

827
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:21,720
clients as code, right and you would want subgroups.

828
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:26,160
Yeah, that's it's just bad.

829
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:33,760
The handsome and happy to hear listening Dave Jones, the pod sage boost in 5000 sats.

830
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:35,440
Great work on the work from home discussion.

831
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:36,440
I loved it.

832
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:37,440
Well, thank you pod sage.

833
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:38,840
I'm glad you're listening.

834
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:40,680
Marcel boosts in with 3030 sats.

835
00:45:40,680 --> 00:45:42,160
Oh, you know what?

836
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:43,160
That's the dirty 30s.

837
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:45,480
Yeah, that's the Kool-Aid man.

838
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:48,160
I forgot to boost in about why I use vim.

839
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:50,360
And nobody's mentioned it modal editing.

840
00:45:50,360 --> 00:45:51,360
It's killer.

841
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:56,240
I get the same language services vs code, but it's extensible when I need it.

842
00:45:56,240 --> 00:46:02,560
I made a command to convert do I latex code using do I to dib.org.

843
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:03,560
It saved me so much time.

844
00:46:03,560 --> 00:46:07,760
You know what he had he actually used it for hundreds of articles he said you're not going

845
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:09,400
to find it in the app store though.

846
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:11,680
Also tabs fight me.

847
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:13,400
Yeah, all right.

848
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:16,840
Good news is that's our only vim boost as far as I know, right?

849
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:18,560
We also got a few more emails in.

850
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:22,200
I'm just responding to people directly now on that particular topic.

851
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:31,000
I think everybody will understand why we got 8000 sats from mollusk.

852
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:34,000
He says have either of you tried out the nim programming language?

853
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:39,760
I think it's actually pretty nice as a nice bounce of features borrowed from other languages.

854
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:46,000
I went to go look it up on the stack exchange developer ranking thing, you know, and not

855
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:47,400
even on the list.

856
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:52,540
But nim is a general purpose, multi paradigm, statically typed, compiled systems programming

857
00:46:52,540 --> 00:46:53,540
language.

858
00:46:53,540 --> 00:46:58,960
It was created to be as fast as C, as expressive as Python, and as extensible as Lisp.

859
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:05,160
It started 14 years ago and obviously influenced by Python, Rust, even C++ and others.

860
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:06,160
It looks very Pythonic.

861
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:07,160
Yes.

862
00:47:07,160 --> 00:47:08,160
Oh, yeah.

863
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:10,800
Did you just make that up?

864
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:11,800
That's awesome.

865
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:14,920
No, I've read it in some I think I read it in one of those Manning books or I made it

866
00:47:14,920 --> 00:47:15,920
up.

867
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:16,920
I'm taking credit.

868
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:17,920
I think you should.

869
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:18,920
That's mine now.

870
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:19,920
Yeah.

871
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:22,520
Noob Steve boosted him with 4444 sats.

872
00:47:22,520 --> 00:47:23,520
I'm with Mike.

873
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:26,280
Hashtag free Oona best email of the week.

874
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:28,120
Yeah, that I agree with.

875
00:47:28,120 --> 00:47:33,240
I'm hoping that's going to be a, you know, a multi episode arc, but not too long.

876
00:47:33,240 --> 00:47:35,400
Also, I love the Orville and Discovery.

877
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:36,400
I know I'm a nerd.

878
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:39,640
I'm just happy to see new side new sci fi, even if it is flawed.

879
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:43,880
I completely agree with your assessment, though, about Seth, even though I do love his humor.

880
00:47:43,880 --> 00:47:47,760
Yeah, I don't think he makes a great captain was basically my I think if he wasn't rich

881
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:51,800
and famous and responsible, he actually follows up with exactly that point.

882
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:52,800
Wow.

883
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:53,800
Oh, yeah, he does.

884
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:54,800
You're right.

885
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:55,800
He's Yeah, sorry.

886
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:56,800
Double boost.

887
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:57,800
You're right.

888
00:47:57,800 --> 00:47:58,800
I agree with it.

889
00:47:58,800 --> 00:47:59,800
His humor.

890
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:00,800
He's definitely not the best actor.

891
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:02,720
And I agree with your assessment of Discovery.

892
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:05,360
It was exceptionally hard for me to swallow the whole mushroom thing.

893
00:48:05,360 --> 00:48:06,360
Oh, yeah.

894
00:48:06,360 --> 00:48:07,360
OK.

895
00:48:07,360 --> 00:48:08,360
All right.

896
00:48:08,360 --> 00:48:11,960
Also, Paul Stamets is also the guy that's like famous for being a big mushroom guy.

897
00:48:11,960 --> 00:48:14,320
So they named the engineer after the real Paul Stamets.

898
00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:18,760
But that's kind of weird that, you know, I don't know, kind of takes me out of it sometimes.

899
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:21,320
But like me, he says he watches it because it's Trek.

900
00:48:21,320 --> 00:48:24,160
Oh, he's also a member who boosts as well.

901
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:25,160
Wow.

902
00:48:25,160 --> 00:48:26,720
That that is awesome.

903
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:31,320
Trev Dev, who has been behind on podcasts but is staying current on Coder Radio because

904
00:48:31,320 --> 00:48:32,840
he boosts other shows I listen to.

905
00:48:32,840 --> 00:48:39,680
So I know he's been falling behind, but listening every single week with ten thousand sacks.

906
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:42,440
He says I will make one argument for tabs.

907
00:48:42,440 --> 00:48:46,560
Tabs make it so that people with accessibility like vision issues are able to set the tab

908
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:50,240
with as a smaller size.

909
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:54,440
This way, they are able to do all of the code with large font sizes and not have to reformat

910
00:48:54,440 --> 00:48:56,640
every buffer they work on twice.

911
00:48:56,640 --> 00:49:00,400
Everyone else can just use the tab size of four to eight columns and carry on.

912
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:02,960
Other than that, who gives a fark?

913
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:05,960
Do whatever the project or language standards call for.

914
00:49:05,960 --> 00:49:07,240
Very reasonable.

915
00:49:07,240 --> 00:49:09,260
That's a very reasonable idea.

916
00:49:09,260 --> 00:49:11,920
Lower third Chiron boosts in with a row of ducks.

917
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:12,920
Thank you kindly.

918
00:49:12,920 --> 00:49:16,320
Two hundred and twenty two thousand, two hundred and twenty two sacks.

919
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:19,780
Just boosting to say that I love the chat about Star Trek when it comes to discovery.

920
00:49:19,780 --> 00:49:22,280
It's a real Mario and Luigi situation.

921
00:49:22,280 --> 00:49:23,280
I don't know what that.

922
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:24,280
I don't know.

923
00:49:24,280 --> 00:49:25,280
I don't know.

924
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:26,280
He says it all the time.

925
00:49:26,280 --> 00:49:27,680
Star Trek is Star Trek after all.

926
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:28,680
Keep up the good work.

927
00:49:28,680 --> 00:49:29,680
Yeah.

928
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:30,680
Yeah.

929
00:49:30,680 --> 00:49:32,520
Follow up on whatever the hell that means.

930
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:33,760
I'm going to use it, though.

931
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:36,640
Yeah, that's a real Mario and Luigi situation.

932
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:39,260
You just don't even know.

933
00:49:39,260 --> 00:49:40,920
It sounds like something, though, doesn't it?

934
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:42,720
It sounds very mean.

935
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:43,720
Yeah.

936
00:49:43,720 --> 00:49:44,720
OK.

937
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:45,800
Thornton, Maryland, boosted in.

938
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:47,600
This old duck still got it.

939
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:49,040
With a row of ducks.

940
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:51,080
Two thousand, two hundred and twenty two sacks.

941
00:49:51,080 --> 00:49:54,880
We all know environment concerns are about controlling people and not really about the

942
00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:55,880
environment.

943
00:49:55,880 --> 00:50:01,400
And keep keeping people at home isn't part of the agenda, I guess.

944
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:05,280
Also, apps are sold on the Steam Linux platform, but it's just mostly games pointing out that

945
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:08,040
there is an app store, a universal app store for Linux.

946
00:50:08,040 --> 00:50:10,160
They do have some apps on Steam for Linux.

947
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:11,160
Yeah, I don't know.

948
00:50:11,160 --> 00:50:14,960
I don't know if I agree with the sentiment about I think if you were really if it was

949
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:17,880
controlling people was really about the environment, they would be keeping them home.

950
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:20,000
That's the only thing about their thorn that I don't know if I agree.

951
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,240
I think that's that's the thing.

952
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:26,480
Mr. Quackers boosted in with a row of ducks, our last boost of the week.

953
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:28,880
Two thousand, two hundred and twenty two sacks.

954
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:29,880
Quacka Wacka.

955
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:30,880
It's a treasure.

956
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:31,880
Yippee.

957
00:50:31,880 --> 00:50:35,440
Says I'm not a very good programmer, but I've been learning Rust for about two years and

958
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:37,520
it's been very fun to learn.

959
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:41,000
But actually writing code with it has been a huge challenge.

960
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:42,000
Ah, yes.

961
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:43,000
And not fun.

962
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:44,880
I'm sorry to hear that Quackers.

963
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:49,680
He goes on to say, for the project I'm working on, I finally gave up and I learned to go.

964
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:50,680
Interesting choice.

965
00:50:50,680 --> 00:50:55,280
Twenty years and I feel I'm at the level I was after two years of Rust.

966
00:50:55,280 --> 00:51:01,320
I miss Rust compiler errors and cargo, but otherwise I've been so much happier.

967
00:51:01,320 --> 00:51:03,400
I think we've heard that sentiment from the audience, too.

968
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:04,400
Well, good.

969
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:05,400
Yeah.

970
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:06,400
Rust is super strict.

971
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:07,400
Right.

972
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:10,520
So if that's not for you, then, yeah, go is a good alternative.

973
00:51:10,520 --> 00:51:14,960
And if you really want to go cray cray, just go C plus plus and give up on reality and

974
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:15,960
time and space.

975
00:51:15,960 --> 00:51:20,040
Hey, remember that assemblies out there to a couple of call outs.

976
00:51:20,040 --> 00:51:25,880
Golden Dragon boosted in just under the 2000 sat limit to just give some nano love.

977
00:51:25,880 --> 00:51:29,680
And we also got a thousand stats from old Trecker who said, I love me some strange new

978
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:32,040
worlds, but I must say it.

979
00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:34,720
Auroville New Horizons is the best Trek show.

980
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:35,960
What is happening?

981
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:40,480
I can't even I can't even you cannot objectively watch the Orville in strange new worlds and

982
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:42,760
tell me the Orville is a better show.

983
00:51:42,760 --> 00:51:44,080
It's so bonk bonk on the nose.

984
00:51:44,080 --> 00:51:47,680
I do think sometimes the effects are pretty good.

985
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:49,080
Come on, guys.

986
00:51:49,080 --> 00:51:50,280
Come on.

987
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:55,160
Orville just feels it's like a really super well done Trek fan series.

988
00:51:55,160 --> 00:51:58,800
Speaking of the fans, should we mention the discussion we were having?

989
00:51:58,800 --> 00:51:59,800
Yeah.

990
00:51:59,800 --> 00:52:00,800
Which one?

991
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:01,800
Tell me.

992
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:04,600
Switching back to a noon time on the eastern time zone.

993
00:52:04,600 --> 00:52:05,600
Oh, right.

994
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:06,600
Thank you.

995
00:52:06,600 --> 00:52:10,240
We last week we tried out doing Coder earlier at 9 a.m.

996
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:11,240
Pacific, was it?

997
00:52:11,240 --> 00:52:12,240
Yeah.

998
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:13,240
Noon Eastern.

999
00:52:13,240 --> 00:52:14,240
And then noon Eastern.

1000
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:15,240
Yeah.

1001
00:52:15,240 --> 00:52:17,320
And I think we had a pretty good attendance in the chat room.

1002
00:52:17,320 --> 00:52:22,100
And so we wanted to put it out there as just a bit of feedback from you guys were asking

1003
00:52:22,100 --> 00:52:23,100
for it.

1004
00:52:23,100 --> 00:52:24,640
Would you like us to do a little bit earlier?

1005
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:28,400
Because I think we both could accommodate that.

1006
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:32,560
And if it's better for people's lifetimes and we can get even more live folks, that'd

1007
00:52:32,560 --> 00:52:33,560
be great.

1008
00:52:33,560 --> 00:52:38,600
So you can go to Coder dot show slash contact or you can boost in your ideas, messages,

1009
00:52:38,600 --> 00:52:41,760
feedback with a new podcast app at new podcast apps dot com.

1010
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:45,020
And of course, you can always join us live and just tell us stuff real time, give us

1011
00:52:45,020 --> 00:52:49,040
real time feedback in that chat room, which we got going on right now or hit us up on

1012
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:50,040
that matrix server.

1013
00:52:50,040 --> 00:52:51,040
Yeah.

1014
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:52,040
Oh, right.

1015
00:52:52,040 --> 00:52:53,040
Geez, you're on it today, dude.

1016
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:57,640
We have we also have a Coder Radio feedback in general discussion rooms, two different

1017
00:52:57,640 --> 00:53:00,600
Coder rooms on our matrix server.

1018
00:53:00,600 --> 00:53:02,480
And the conversation is great in there as well.

1019
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:04,440
And that's a great place to give us feedback as well.

1020
00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:07,640
And you don't got to worry about what Telegram's doing.

1021
00:53:07,640 --> 00:53:11,040
Now, OK.

1022
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:13,600
Also big thank you to our Coder QA team out there.

1023
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:15,240
You guys keep us independent.

1024
00:53:15,240 --> 00:53:18,700
You keep us focused on our audience and you let us be choosy about the advertisers we

1025
00:53:18,700 --> 00:53:19,720
work with.

1026
00:53:19,720 --> 00:53:22,460
Those are fundamentals that make the show what it is.

1027
00:53:22,460 --> 00:53:25,280
So thank you for your support at Coder QA dot co.

1028
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:26,280
The Coderly is up there.

1029
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:27,760
We put one up every quarter.

1030
00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:31,420
And of course, you also get an ad free version of the show as a thank you.

1031
00:53:31,420 --> 00:53:34,920
And you know, I don't know, Coder QA dot co.

1032
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:35,920
Thank you.

1033
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:36,920
Thank you, members.

1034
00:53:36,920 --> 00:53:37,920
We're working on a bat line.

1035
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:39,160
We're working on new features for that as well.

1036
00:53:39,160 --> 00:53:43,560
But website and road trip are my current priorities outside of the regular show production.

1037
00:53:43,560 --> 00:53:45,120
And then we'll be checking stuff off.

1038
00:53:45,120 --> 00:53:48,440
And don't forget to go check out that new website and give us your feedback.

1039
00:53:48,440 --> 00:53:52,120
New URL, new dot Jupiter Broadcasting dot com.

1040
00:53:52,120 --> 00:53:56,680
And then we have a Jupiter Broadcasting com GitHub repo where you can open up issues and

1041
00:53:56,680 --> 00:53:58,360
do poll requests and whatnot.

1042
00:53:58,360 --> 00:54:02,720
But go try out the new website and tell us your feedback because it's just a few weeks

1043
00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:04,720
away from going live.

1044
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:07,840
One of the things I've been doing and our crew has been doing and maybe you could start

1045
00:54:07,840 --> 00:54:12,140
doing out there, dear audiences, maybe start using it as your regular way to get the podcast

1046
00:54:12,140 --> 00:54:13,360
to tune into the live stream.

1047
00:54:13,360 --> 00:54:17,320
You can go to new dot Jupiter Broadcasting dot com and play around with everything.

1048
00:54:17,320 --> 00:54:20,120
Find the issues and let us know what's going on so we can get it all fixed up before we

1049
00:54:20,120 --> 00:54:21,800
flip that into production.

1050
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:27,160
Mr. Dominic, is there anywhere you want to send the peeps before we just add to Manu

1051
00:54:27,160 --> 00:54:31,800
co on Twitter and Alice dot to have you got to check out that Alice dot dev guys, you

1052
00:54:31,800 --> 00:54:32,800
got to go check it out.

1053
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:34,120
Well, we mentioned the live time.

1054
00:54:34,120 --> 00:54:36,280
We'd love to have you join us on a Monday for right now.

1055
00:54:36,280 --> 00:54:37,880
It's noon Pacific, three p.m. Eastern.

1056
00:54:37,880 --> 00:54:41,720
But based on your feedback, we might move that up a few notches.

1057
00:54:41,720 --> 00:54:44,600
You can find the show on the Twitter's at Coder Radio show.

1058
00:54:44,600 --> 00:54:45,600

1059
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:47,360
I'm also on the matrix.

Chris LAS.

1061
00:54:48,360 --> 00:54:49,360
Funny how that works.

1062
00:54:49,360 --> 00:54:50,360
Huh?

1063
00:54:50,360 --> 00:54:51,360
