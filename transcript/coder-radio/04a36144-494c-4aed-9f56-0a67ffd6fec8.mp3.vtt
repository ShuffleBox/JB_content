00:00.000 --> 00:15.760
This is KOTORadio, episode 410 for April 20th, 2021.

00:15.760 --> 00:19.840
Hello one, hello all, welcome in to KOTORadio, Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show taking

00:19.840 --> 00:25.280
a pragmatic look at the art and business of software development and the world of technology.

00:25.280 --> 00:26.920
This episode is brought to you by Cloud Guru.

00:26.920 --> 00:32.360
You know, Cloud Guru has Cloud Playground, Azure, AWS, and Google's infrastructure in

00:32.360 --> 00:35.600
their sandboxes on their credit card, not yours.

00:35.600 --> 00:36.600
Sweet.

00:36.600 --> 00:40.240

00:40.240 --> 00:45.480
My name is Chris and picking out his orange iMac, it is our host, Mr. Dominic.

00:45.480 --> 00:46.480
Hello Mike.

00:46.480 --> 00:48.360
So say we all.

00:48.360 --> 00:50.440
You're really on this BSG thing.

00:50.440 --> 00:55.440
Can I tell you, those of you who closely follow me and perhaps former members of my family

00:55.440 --> 01:01.480
on Twitter know that the old Mike has been having a bad time and yeah, Chris just laughs.

01:01.480 --> 01:04.480
You found a happy place in BSG, you know, is that what you're telling me?

01:04.480 --> 01:08.640
No, I'm in love with the president and I don't mean Sleepy Joe.

01:08.640 --> 01:13.280
I mean president Laura, Airlock, Rosalind, right?

01:13.280 --> 01:14.280
President Rosalind.

01:14.280 --> 01:15.280
You know what?

01:15.280 --> 01:16.280
I got bad news about Rosalind though, bro.

01:16.280 --> 01:20.480
She's got, she's got, well, I don't want to spoil it for you, but you better brace yourself

01:20.480 --> 01:21.480
for some bad news.

01:21.480 --> 01:22.480
Oh no.

01:22.480 --> 01:24.360
Is she a Cylon too?

01:24.360 --> 01:26.080
Have you not seen the end of BSG?

01:26.080 --> 01:29.920
Yeah, I've seen the end where it's like a huge disappointment.

01:29.920 --> 01:31.520
I'm not sure I would say that.

01:31.520 --> 01:35.800
You could describe it as a collapse of a television show in front of our eyes.

01:35.800 --> 01:39.680
Somebody let the writers get a little too up their ass about it, but no, absolutely.

01:39.680 --> 01:40.680
I completely agree.

01:40.680 --> 01:45.000
I think it, I think, I think the ending of BSG is a travesty, especially when you could

01:45.000 --> 01:49.800
remember that it started with that mini series that was so fricking epic.

01:49.800 --> 01:55.920
So okay, you know what, f**k Apple, let's just go into BSG today.

01:55.920 --> 02:03.840
The core concept of BSG was there are some humans left from 12 colonies, right?

02:03.840 --> 02:08.520
We're together so far and there's a magical 13th colony that we're worried about, right?

02:08.520 --> 02:10.240
Like we don't know about the 13th colony.

02:10.240 --> 02:11.240
Earth is amazing.

02:11.240 --> 02:13.720
We don't know about Earth, right?

02:13.720 --> 02:22.520
But my love, and I really hope to be my second wife, Madame President Rosalyn, always has

02:22.520 --> 02:25.460
a whiteboard behind her of the remaining survivors.

02:25.460 --> 02:29.720
And that number tends to go in the, how can we put this?

02:29.720 --> 02:32.840
If you were in the Robin Hood app, that number would be read all the time.

02:32.840 --> 02:35.280
It's in a bad direction, for sure.

02:35.280 --> 02:36.280
You know what?

02:36.280 --> 02:41.040
They're a little militant and I won't say fascist, but maybe a fash, no, they're straight

02:41.040 --> 02:42.040
up fascist, right?

02:42.040 --> 02:43.840
I mean, they are fascist.

02:43.840 --> 02:45.320
Well you're in for a ride, my friend.

02:45.320 --> 02:46.760
You are in for a ride with her.

02:46.760 --> 02:52.880
So I got to tell you, I want to have a brief conversation about Gaius Baltar and why he

02:52.880 --> 02:54.960
should be hung by his balls.

02:54.960 --> 02:59.640
This is relevant, you know, because people, this is what people are talking about today.

02:59.640 --> 03:03.040
This is what people are talking about in 2021.

03:03.040 --> 03:04.600
Mike has discovered the 90s.

03:04.600 --> 03:09.120
Hey man, I'm the guy over here watching Seinfeld, so have at it, because at least yours is newer

03:09.120 --> 03:10.120
than mine.

03:10.120 --> 03:16.120
So I just find something about a beautiful redhead who's totally willing to kill like

03:16.120 --> 03:17.120
everybody.

03:17.120 --> 03:18.800
I mean, if you haven't seen Battlestar, like.

03:18.800 --> 03:20.400
You should watch Voyager then.

03:20.400 --> 03:21.400
You might like Janeway.

03:21.400 --> 03:24.720
I do like Janeway, but Janeway is a little too like girl power there.

03:24.720 --> 03:27.560
Roslin's like, it's not that I'm a girl, I just want to kill everybody.

03:27.560 --> 03:28.560
She's just like die.

03:28.560 --> 03:31.220
Janeway is just really motivated by coffee.

03:31.220 --> 03:33.580
That's really what, that's, that's, that's the thing about Janeway.

03:33.580 --> 03:38.880
She does seem to have some addiction issues, which again, I totally sympathize with.

03:38.880 --> 03:40.400
Well, good news for you.

03:40.400 --> 03:44.240
You didn't have to spend money on a Thaleo because nobody wrote in claiming that they're

03:44.240 --> 03:47.400
making an independent living with desktop Linux yet.

03:47.400 --> 03:49.960
Yes, I like making bets that I know I'm going to win.

03:49.960 --> 03:52.560
Yeah, yeah, you got that one, right?

03:52.560 --> 03:56.400
Although I think we both thought the Discord would end up selling to Microsoft and just

03:56.400 --> 04:01.520
breaking as we start recording today, Microsoft and Discord have broken off their talks and

04:01.520 --> 04:04.400
Discord has announced they're going to go the IPO route.

04:04.400 --> 04:05.400
So that's ended.

04:05.400 --> 04:06.400
I thought that would happen.

04:06.400 --> 04:08.600
I'm going to explain Discord to me.

04:08.600 --> 04:12.100
It's slack for, for casual people.

04:12.100 --> 04:15.440
It's like, it's like gamified up a little bit slack, a little, little more casual, a

04:15.440 --> 04:17.580
little more community and gaming oriented.

04:17.580 --> 04:18.580
So no spreadsheets.

04:18.580 --> 04:19.580
Yeah.

04:19.580 --> 04:24.380
More consumer focused features like Twitch integration and, and other things like Reddit

04:24.380 --> 04:26.880
integration right out of the box, that kind of stuff.

04:26.880 --> 04:27.880
You know, I like it.

04:27.880 --> 04:29.360
It's just, I don't know.

04:29.360 --> 04:33.860
It's just, I'm not a huge fan of yet one more communications platform controlled by one central

04:33.860 --> 04:34.860
group of people.

04:34.860 --> 04:36.960
So I haven't really gone crazy with it.

04:36.960 --> 04:40.480
There is a Jupiter broadcasting discord, but it's kind of on pause while I figure out what

04:40.480 --> 04:41.840
I'm doing with matrix.

04:41.840 --> 04:44.020
And why is this better than IRC?

04:44.020 --> 04:49.840
The same reason slack is, you know, you get besides just your previews and more rich text

04:49.840 --> 04:55.120
chat and emojis and you know, gotta have your animated GIFs, but you got voice chat and

04:55.120 --> 04:58.520
video calls and there's other features and there's a good permissions model.

04:58.520 --> 05:02.840
And of course getting it spun up and started is super crazy easy to get your own server

05:02.840 --> 05:03.840
going.

05:03.840 --> 05:04.840
It's like just a couple of clicks.

05:04.840 --> 05:10.560
It's like, for example, actually, I know several projects that are just using discord now to,

05:10.560 --> 05:16.520
to coordinate their, their project work, like the Ubuntu mate distribution uses discord

05:16.520 --> 05:18.800
because it's cheap, you know, it's free for them.

05:18.800 --> 05:23.760
I think in most cases and I'm sorry, but mate, Ubuntu, I don't know.

05:23.760 --> 05:24.760
Yeah.

05:24.760 --> 05:25.760
Yeah.

05:25.760 --> 05:26.760
Yeah.

05:26.760 --> 05:27.760
I know.

05:27.760 --> 05:28.760
Uh, and uh, it works, you know, and the young people love it.

05:28.760 --> 05:29.760
That's the other thing.

05:29.760 --> 05:32.480
A lot of, not a lot of network effect kids these days, Mike, they love it.

05:32.480 --> 05:38.360
I bet they also like, you know, freedom of expression and shiny iPads with liquid.

05:38.360 --> 05:39.360
What is it?

05:39.360 --> 05:44.520
Liquid, uh, liquid retina, HDR, XDR, double micro mini led.

05:44.520 --> 05:47.080
Craig Federico, you're just making shit up now, aren't you?

05:47.080 --> 05:48.080
They totally are.

05:48.080 --> 05:52.520
Uh, so yeah, we are recording on Tuesday this week because we wanted to give you our sort

05:52.520 --> 05:56.840
of instant reaction to the apple news and event and find out if either one of us bought

05:56.840 --> 05:57.840
anything.

05:57.840 --> 06:00.040
Uh, but before we do, we do have like just a couple of emails.

06:00.040 --> 06:03.120
Maybe we'll just do that since, you know, feedback's a huge part of this show.

06:03.120 --> 06:07.080
Daniel writes in and he's just kind of throwing down, he says, hit me up, Mike.

06:07.080 --> 06:08.080
I've had enough.

06:08.080 --> 06:11.000
I'm going to fix your genome shell wallpaper problem.

06:11.000 --> 06:13.800
We had a couple of people write in, they don't know what we're referring to.

06:13.800 --> 06:16.960
I guess they, you know, they need to listen to the whole back catalog obviously.

06:16.960 --> 06:18.560
Oh, gather round children.

06:18.560 --> 06:20.440
Wait, hold on.

06:20.440 --> 06:21.680
You know what you just did, right?

06:21.680 --> 06:24.560
You just gave me, you just gave me an opportunity there.

06:24.560 --> 06:26.360
Stay a while and listen.

06:26.360 --> 06:28.800
Ah, my, my uncle.

06:28.800 --> 06:35.120
So, uh, gnomus functional is, uh, for all, you know, intensive purposes, functionally

06:35.120 --> 06:40.040
broken because the extensions can crash the entire shell.

06:40.040 --> 06:41.040
That's the problem.

06:41.040 --> 06:44.200
You had that happen with an extension that literally was just rotating your background

06:44.200 --> 06:45.200
wallpaper.

06:45.200 --> 06:46.200
But it's just me, right?

06:46.200 --> 06:49.520
It's, I mean, thousands of people have had this happen, maybe tens of thousands.

06:49.520 --> 06:51.400
I'm sure tens of thousands.

06:51.400 --> 06:52.860
I think it's gotten better.

06:52.860 --> 06:56.680
So some people are not as familiar with the problem as they used to be when you first

06:56.680 --> 06:57.680
ran into it.

06:57.680 --> 07:04.000
Um, I would say something being about add architecture choices, but I won't, right?

07:04.000 --> 07:08.200
It's architecturally nothing's changed so it can totally still happen, but this problem

07:08.200 --> 07:09.200
still exists.

07:09.200 --> 07:12.520
If you have an unstable extension, it will crash your entire shell.

07:12.520 --> 07:18.640
That's why the guys over at system 76, the folks over at system 76 are using typescript

07:18.640 --> 07:20.600
and rust to build everything they're doing.

07:20.600 --> 07:21.600
Yeah.

07:21.600 --> 07:22.800
They're coming out with their own shell, right?

07:22.800 --> 07:25.320
Isn't it a cosmic cosmic?

07:25.320 --> 07:26.320
Thank you.

07:26.320 --> 07:27.320
Yeah.

07:27.320 --> 07:28.320
That's interesting.

07:28.320 --> 07:33.200
I mean, I think, I mean, it's easy to say it on a, on a lame podcast where we only love

07:33.200 --> 07:35.280
Apple and we hit all our operating systems.

07:35.280 --> 07:36.280
There you go.

07:36.280 --> 07:37.280
YouTube.

07:37.280 --> 07:38.280
There you go.

07:38.280 --> 07:39.640
I gave it to you.

07:39.640 --> 07:46.040
But in theory, if you could silo off the extension processes from the actual shell, that would

07:46.040 --> 07:47.360
basically solve the problem.

07:47.360 --> 07:48.360
Yeah.

07:48.360 --> 07:51.600
Like even just if it just killed all extensions, but the rest of the shell kept going.

07:51.600 --> 07:54.280
Well, you can't kill all extensions though, right?

07:54.280 --> 07:59.640
Because most of genome shell is actually extensions.

07:59.640 --> 08:00.640
Good point.

08:00.640 --> 08:06.160
Think about pop OS, all of pop OS is basically like your solution would be each extension

08:06.160 --> 08:07.160
has its own process.

08:07.160 --> 08:09.920
Well, I would actually pose a question.

08:09.920 --> 08:14.840
What is the failure case that putting high res images, switching on a monitor, like a

08:14.840 --> 08:21.120
five K monitor crashes the extension, which therefore crashes genome shell when pop OS,

08:21.120 --> 08:25.960
all of their stuff or not all, but a lot of their stuff right now, I know they're doing

08:25.960 --> 08:27.720
cosmic, but right now are basically good.

08:27.720 --> 08:29.080
No extensions.

08:29.080 --> 08:30.420
Cosmic will be as well.

08:30.420 --> 08:31.880
Cosmic is a series of extensions.

08:31.880 --> 08:35.960
It's effectively extensions, but that does not bring down your system.

08:35.960 --> 08:40.800
If like moving a window, using their magical keyboard stuff, you know, they're, you know,

08:40.800 --> 08:41.800
their title.

08:41.800 --> 08:47.480
This is the dichotomy of the free and open source desktop is it all comes down to experience

08:47.480 --> 08:49.620
of the developer code quality.

08:49.620 --> 08:53.280
You know, they're building things with standards and a certain practice and the style of testing

08:53.280 --> 08:57.960
that they're doing in house and not every extension developer is doing anything near

08:57.960 --> 08:58.960
that.

08:58.960 --> 08:59.960
Okay.

08:59.960 --> 09:03.120
And because of the architecture of the shell, it can become a problem, right?

09:03.120 --> 09:06.840
I guess I would be more merciful to the extension developers that the Arctic architecture of

09:06.840 --> 09:12.840
the shell makes it very easy to make very stupid mistakes, but yeah, I wish I had a

09:12.840 --> 09:15.560
good explanation because it still bothers me as well.

09:15.560 --> 09:20.280
So I think they're aware of the problem because I had a conversation with Neil McGovern, who

09:20.280 --> 09:27.160
is the executive director of the Gnome Foundation, and they're kind of tackling it in like pieces

09:27.160 --> 09:28.160
that they can.

09:28.160 --> 09:33.360
So with Gnome 40, they broke off input into its own process now, and that's a big deal

09:33.360 --> 09:37.080
because Linux can be a little weird when you got a lot of disk IO going on and then all

09:37.080 --> 09:39.180
of a sudden you got some network IO or something.

09:39.180 --> 09:43.800
You can get a stuttery mouse or keyboard and they've solved that by breaking that off onto

09:43.800 --> 09:44.960
its own process.

09:44.960 --> 09:48.240
I asked him about extensions, but I just really couldn't get a firm commitment from him on

09:48.240 --> 09:49.480
it.

09:49.480 --> 09:51.640
It just kind of was like, yeah, it's something we need to look into, but we think there's

09:51.640 --> 09:52.880
a lot of ways to address that.

09:52.880 --> 09:54.520
Yeah, no, I think it's a hard problem.

09:54.520 --> 09:57.360
I mean, honestly, it's technical debt in a lot of ways.

09:57.360 --> 10:02.200
Yeah, I was, you know, but Wes made a good point, you know, as he always does, damn it.

10:02.200 --> 10:03.200
A little hippie.

10:03.200 --> 10:04.200
I'm so jeezed.

10:04.200 --> 10:06.680
No, he's always made it just.

10:06.680 --> 10:07.680
Wes was right.

10:07.680 --> 10:09.600
If he would write it in Clojure, it would be better.

10:09.600 --> 10:16.320
No, he was pointing out that this type of market, like the users of the Linux desktop,

10:16.320 --> 10:18.800
there's an advantage to making it something approachable.

10:18.800 --> 10:24.120
You know, when it's JavaScript you're working with and these extensions can change a lot

10:24.120 --> 10:29.080
of things, like that is kind of what the demographic of the Linux desktop wants.

10:29.080 --> 10:32.640
To them, that flexibility sometimes is a premium feature.

10:32.640 --> 10:33.640
Right.

10:33.640 --> 10:35.040
So people who like their software not to work.

10:35.040 --> 10:36.040
No, I get that.

10:36.040 --> 10:37.040
Well, okay.

10:37.040 --> 10:38.040
All right.

10:38.040 --> 10:39.040
All right.

10:39.040 --> 10:40.040
All right.

10:40.040 --> 10:44.360
So Shem wrote in along the topic of JavaScript but on the server, and he wants to make the

10:44.360 --> 10:49.920
point to you that essentially boils down to that JavaScript is great on the server if

10:49.920 --> 10:51.760
it's for something you don't care about.

10:51.760 --> 10:53.280
He says, I was listening to 407.

10:53.280 --> 10:54.280
I know.

10:54.280 --> 10:55.280
Yeah.

10:55.280 --> 10:56.280
Okay.

10:56.280 --> 10:58.880
Well, meth is great for people I don't care about either, but keep going.

10:58.880 --> 11:02.200
And so you guys were talking about JavaScript on the server and Mike had his rant about

11:02.200 --> 11:03.200
the child.

11:03.200 --> 11:05.200
I would say reasoned argument like Jordan Peterson.

11:05.200 --> 11:06.200
Let's keep going.

11:06.200 --> 11:07.200
Okay.

11:07.200 --> 11:10.920
So that is at his reasoned argument about JavaScript and TypeScript.

11:10.920 --> 11:14.880
While I agree with most of Mike's point about JavaScript and it is pretty terrible on the

11:14.880 --> 11:17.400
server, I think you missed one aspect.

11:17.400 --> 11:22.000
A lot of people will reach for JavaScript or Python or Ruby because they're dynamic

11:22.000 --> 11:26.640
and you can prototype quickly, which means you can get a working back end up and running

11:26.640 --> 11:28.120
without much fuss.

11:28.120 --> 11:30.480
However, we see companies like GitHub.

11:30.480 --> 11:34.880
They use these languages and as they scale, they start to buckle as you get to larger

11:34.880 --> 11:38.980
code bases and you get tricky and trickier requirements and edge cases.

11:38.980 --> 11:42.800
But if you're just building a small site that doesn't need any fancy back end, maybe it

11:42.800 --> 11:48.400
won't ever get much traffic, then JavaScript or TypeScript or node or Dino will be fine.

11:48.400 --> 11:53.000
But I think too many people pick it without realizing the limitations that you're placing

11:53.000 --> 11:55.400
on yourself with that choice.

11:55.400 --> 11:56.560
Thanks for the entertaining chatter.

11:56.560 --> 11:57.560
Keep it up.

11:57.560 --> 11:58.560
What do you think of that?

11:58.560 --> 12:02.040
Like, it's not so bad for prototyping, especially if you're never really going to put it in

12:02.040 --> 12:04.080
much of any kind of production.

12:04.080 --> 12:06.200
Now now will you allow it?

12:06.200 --> 12:10.640
I mean, I guess if I were in the Air Force and I had to really not crash my plane, I

12:10.640 --> 12:15.200
might take amphetamines.

12:15.200 --> 12:17.160
But I definitely wouldn't make that as a life choice.

12:17.160 --> 12:20.000
Yeah, you don't want to fall asleep and crash the airplane.

12:20.000 --> 12:22.520
We got a lot of different feedback around tooling again.

12:22.520 --> 12:25.000
We got some on the subreddit, too.

12:25.000 --> 12:28.400
Some people feel like we like I went too hard on Linux last week.

12:28.400 --> 12:29.920
I thought we had a parlor page.

12:29.920 --> 12:30.920
Yeah, we need to do that.

12:30.920 --> 12:32.760
I don't know how you do that, but they're back, baby.

12:32.760 --> 12:34.440
So I guess we better get it started.

12:34.440 --> 12:36.760
Maybe you know, maybe it'll go big.

12:36.760 --> 12:41.380
And I want to talk about how the topic of Mac and Linux and Windows has come up again

12:41.380 --> 12:42.380
in the show a lot.

12:42.380 --> 12:47.360
And it seems to kind of be a reoccurring theme and something to keep in mind on this show,

12:47.360 --> 12:48.360
specifically this one.

12:48.360 --> 12:50.020
Really, this is going to be a big one.

12:50.020 --> 12:51.100
It's not Linux radio.

12:51.100 --> 12:52.380
It is Coder radio.

12:52.380 --> 12:57.120
And the tooling that we use to do the work has always been a big part of the conversation

12:57.120 --> 12:58.360
on the show.

12:58.360 --> 13:00.560
And you know, it's going through a lot of changes right now.

13:00.560 --> 13:03.480
We've got a lot happening with Gnome Shell, like we just touched on.

13:03.480 --> 13:09.020
Obviously, the M1 platform and Apple's tooling around that is shaking things up a lot there.

13:09.020 --> 13:12.500
And then you have Windows making big investments in WSL.

13:12.500 --> 13:14.840
And then there's the whole hardware side of things, right?

13:14.840 --> 13:18.500
As far as like laptops and desktops and monitors and keyboards, like it's just kind of been

13:18.500 --> 13:19.800
a thing again.

13:19.800 --> 13:23.520
And a lot of that conversation is being driven by the feedback that we get into the show

13:23.520 --> 13:26.600
at coder.show slash contact.

13:26.600 --> 13:30.180
We really do appreciate everybody giving us their feedback on their take on all of this.

13:30.180 --> 13:34.080
But to be clear, and I think I'm pretty confident in speaking for you on this one, Mike.

13:34.080 --> 13:36.200
But correct me if I'm wrong.

13:36.200 --> 13:40.500
We don't care what OS you use or what computer you use.

13:40.500 --> 13:41.500
I care.

13:41.500 --> 13:42.500
You should all use Snow Leopard.

13:42.500 --> 13:43.500
Okay.

13:43.500 --> 13:44.500
Well, there's that.

13:44.500 --> 13:45.640
We just want you to get your work done.

13:45.640 --> 13:47.560
You know, wear a robe and get your work done.

13:47.560 --> 13:48.560
That's all we care about.

13:48.560 --> 13:49.560
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

13:49.560 --> 13:50.560
Whoa.

13:50.560 --> 13:51.560
Okay.

13:51.560 --> 13:52.560
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

13:52.560 --> 13:54.800
What was that last bit there?

13:54.800 --> 13:55.800
Just something about a robe.

13:55.800 --> 13:57.920
You know, I'm just saying.

13:57.920 --> 13:58.920
Where is my robe?

13:58.920 --> 14:03.200
It's probably not going to be until like the 11th or 12th that you're going to probably

14:03.200 --> 14:04.200
start seeing it.

14:04.200 --> 14:05.200
Uh-huh.

14:05.200 --> 14:07.840
See, you opened the robe door, but now the door is open.

14:07.840 --> 14:13.160
So when is the Coder Radio Limited Edition Totally Objective-C Developer Rope coming

14:13.160 --> 14:14.160
out?

14:14.160 --> 14:16.720
Oh, perhaps a special edition.

14:16.720 --> 14:18.280
We should collab on this.

14:18.280 --> 14:23.600
Yeah, you know what happened was as we were sorting out international stuffs, we totally

14:23.600 --> 14:26.560
missed the window of manufacturing.

14:26.560 --> 14:30.560
And I had to go with, of course, like a super fancy black one and all that.

14:30.560 --> 14:32.560
And you understand what you did wrong, right?

14:32.560 --> 14:35.280
You didn't listen to Madam Victoria Newman.

14:35.280 --> 14:36.280
Yep.

14:36.280 --> 14:37.280
Her wisdom.

14:37.280 --> 14:38.280
Come on, give it to me.

14:38.280 --> 14:39.280
Give me the unfiltered soundbite.

14:39.280 --> 14:40.280
I don't know.

14:40.280 --> 14:41.280
Can I play that on the show?

14:41.280 --> 14:42.280
You know what I'm saying?

14:42.280 --> 14:43.280
Yeah, do it.

14:43.280 --> 14:44.280
Do it.

14:44.280 --> 14:45.280
Do it.

14:45.280 --> 14:46.280
I don't even know if I have it anymore.

14:46.280 --> 14:47.280
Hold on.

14:47.280 --> 14:48.280
I got to check.

14:48.280 --> 14:51.920
I might have gotten rid of it because, you know, it has a swear word in it.

14:51.920 --> 14:52.920
Oh, my God.

14:52.920 --> 14:54.520
Nasty words on Coder Radio.

14:54.520 --> 14:55.520
That's never happened before.

14:55.520 --> 14:56.520
We've never gotten caught.

14:56.520 --> 14:57.520
There's a swear word in it.

14:57.520 --> 14:58.520
Let's see.

14:58.520 --> 14:59.520
What kind do I have in here?

14:59.520 --> 15:00.520
I bet you I could find it pretty quick.

15:00.520 --> 15:01.800
Actually, you know what I should do?

15:01.800 --> 15:06.200
I should put this on our soundboard because it's come up twice now.

15:06.200 --> 15:08.360
Because my deep seated hatred for the EU just.

15:08.360 --> 15:09.360
All right.

15:09.360 --> 15:10.360
Here you go.

15:10.360 --> 15:11.360
This wasn't.

15:11.360 --> 15:12.360
I wasn't going to do it.

15:12.360 --> 15:13.360
But this is for you.

15:13.360 --> 15:14.360
F*** the EU.

15:14.360 --> 15:15.360
And you know what?

15:15.360 --> 15:16.360
F*** them good.

15:16.360 --> 15:17.640
That's all I can say.

15:17.640 --> 15:22.400
Now, my thoughts are that, you know, whatever works for you, whatever machine that you can

15:22.400 --> 15:24.220
get the job done with, that's fine.

15:24.220 --> 15:26.600
Whatever gets you in your groove, good on you.

15:26.600 --> 15:31.040
Alex wrote in, he said, gentlemen, I've been listening to the show for years and I've also

15:31.040 --> 15:35.640
been using Linux and various distributions as my primary desktop for 11 years.

15:35.640 --> 15:37.640
I don't really ever have the intention of getting a Mac.

15:37.640 --> 15:39.200
Doesn't really matter how fast they get.

15:39.200 --> 15:44.300
The one time I had used it for work and I had to build an iOS app, I found the ability,

15:44.300 --> 15:47.780
the inability to control the operating system frustrating.

15:47.780 --> 15:48.780
It's not about features.

15:48.780 --> 15:51.840
It's about how Apple treats and disrespects its users.

15:51.840 --> 15:54.360
That's the entire point of Linux and open source software.

15:54.360 --> 15:57.320
Frankly, I just wrote all that because I'm tired of hearing about the topic while I'm

15:57.320 --> 16:00.280
over here just getting my work done on my Linux device.

16:00.280 --> 16:05.840
It's weird because by writing into the show about the topic, you have therefore precipitated

16:05.840 --> 16:06.920
this talk.

16:06.920 --> 16:07.920
The topic.

16:07.920 --> 16:11.840
Yeah, I do find myself, I go through cycles where I obsess a little bit about my tooling

16:11.840 --> 16:15.080
and then I go for a year or two and I don't think about it very much and then I obsess

16:15.080 --> 16:17.880
again very much about my tooling.

16:17.880 --> 16:23.240
When I, my heart started pounding during the Apple event when they got to the Mac section

16:23.240 --> 16:26.620
because I was really, all right, you know what?

16:26.620 --> 16:33.240
I'll tell you what, we'll save that first, linode.com slash coder.

16:33.240 --> 16:37.600
Go there to get a $100 60 day credit towards a new account and of course you support the

16:37.600 --> 16:38.600
show.

16:38.600 --> 16:40.280
That's linode.com slash coder.

16:40.280 --> 16:42.680
I host it all on Linode.

16:42.680 --> 16:46.680
I just spun up a new mail server, Wes and I, I mean, let's be honest, it was Wes and

16:46.680 --> 16:47.680
I.

16:47.680 --> 16:48.680
It was a new server.

16:48.680 --> 16:49.680
I hated it.

16:49.680 --> 16:55.120
And then I reflashed the existing Linode from Ubuntu 1804 to CentOS Stream 8 and what was

16:55.120 --> 16:59.360
fantastic about it is I was able to keep the same IP address and all of that stuff.

16:59.360 --> 17:03.520
So all of the MX records and DNS that we had set up didn't have to be redone.

17:03.520 --> 17:06.840
I just wiped it and put a new OS on there from one of their images.

17:06.840 --> 17:10.760
They have all the distros you could possibly want and I wanted to try out CentOS Stream

17:10.760 --> 17:15.280
because I think it's actually going to be a pretty good server distro, but they also

17:15.280 --> 17:19.280
work with Kubernetes and Terraform if you want to do infrastructure by code.

17:19.280 --> 17:23.040
They have S3 compatible object storage, which is fantastic.

17:23.040 --> 17:27.040
When you wrap your head around the use cases of storage in the cloud that doesn't have

17:27.040 --> 17:32.280
to have a server standing in front of it that you can make public or private, oh man, it's

17:32.280 --> 17:33.280
a game changer.

17:33.280 --> 17:36.660
It's a game changer for just like config backups, it's a game changer for distributing files

17:36.660 --> 17:40.260
to clients, it's a game changer for static websites.

17:40.260 --> 17:44.520
That's definitely one of the best use cases is you can have a site up and going and available

17:44.520 --> 17:51.040
using Linode object storage with just a little HTML and CSS and it's crazy snappy fast.

17:51.040 --> 17:54.880
It's a great way to do like a resume or a list of something or build your own custom

17:54.880 --> 17:55.880
homepage.

17:55.880 --> 17:59.680
There's so many different ways to use Linode too because they have like $5 a month rigs,

17:59.680 --> 18:04.680
they've got custom CPU rigs that are super fast with AMD EPYC processors, and of course

18:04.680 --> 18:08.280
they have plans that'll just mix and match all of that as you need it.

18:08.280 --> 18:12.360
They have one-click application deployments, they have tons of great documentation, 11

18:12.360 --> 18:13.360
data centers around the world.

18:13.360 --> 18:17.680
I mean, I could go on and on about the reasons why I love using Linode, not to mention they're

18:17.680 --> 18:22.320
an independent company that is dedicated to offering the best virtualized cloud computing.

18:22.320 --> 18:25.360
Essentially, if it runs on Linux, it's gonna run on Linode.

18:25.360 --> 18:30.200
Go deploy for test or production and really try out all the different features with that

18:30.200 --> 18:31.200
$100 credit.

18:31.200 --> 18:32.240
You can really try it out.

18:32.240 --> 18:36.200
So go to linode.com slash coder, you go there, that lets them know, hey, I heard about it

18:36.200 --> 18:37.340
on Coder Radio.

18:37.340 --> 18:40.780
You go there just to say thanks for supporting the show and check out their services.

18:40.780 --> 18:43.160
That's a great way to keep the Coder Radio program going.

18:43.160 --> 18:48.520
Go to linode.com slash coder, get that $100 60-day credit for your new account and you

18:48.520 --> 18:53.400
support the show, linode.com slash coder.

18:53.400 --> 18:58.360
So did you have the opportunity to watch this Apple event today, the spring event, spring

18:58.360 --> 19:00.720
into spring or whatever it was?

19:00.720 --> 19:02.640
I did watch parts of it.

19:02.640 --> 19:11.420
I did have to disappear for a bit, but I have to tell you that a purple iMac is not something

19:11.420 --> 19:13.080
I would turn down.

19:13.080 --> 19:17.320
So I question the screen size, but all right, let's get to this.

19:17.320 --> 19:18.840
So I streamed it.

19:18.840 --> 19:25.400
I got here this morning early and essentially I've been essentially making content since

19:25.400 --> 19:28.560
8.30 AM and it's 6 PM right now.

19:28.560 --> 19:32.720
So we did a little hangout and watched it and I recorded that on jupiter.tube.

19:32.720 --> 19:34.080
We'll have a link in the show notes.

19:34.080 --> 19:35.400
It starts about 24 minutes in.

19:35.400 --> 19:41.040
If you'd like to watch it with our reactions, super quick rundown for those of you who can't

19:41.040 --> 19:44.920
be bothered to watch it, don't really care, but would like to be informed for the sake

19:44.920 --> 19:45.920
of conversation.

19:45.920 --> 19:48.560
So the people with lives, yes.

19:48.560 --> 19:52.320
Apple finally launched AirTags, their Bluetooth locator for items.

19:52.320 --> 19:56.400
They also announced a purple version of the iPhone 12, not a new iPhone, but just a new

19:56.400 --> 19:57.400
color.

19:57.400 --> 19:58.400
Oh, there's a purple iPhone.

19:58.400 --> 19:59.400
Hang on.

19:59.400 --> 20:00.400
I gotta go.

20:00.400 --> 20:01.400
It looks good too.

20:01.400 --> 20:02.400
There's a paid service for podcasts.

20:02.400 --> 20:08.800
There is a new 4k Apple TV with a much improved Siri remote, which is compatible with previous

20:08.800 --> 20:13.720
Apple TVs and the big ticket, two big ticket items really, but the first big ticket item

20:13.720 --> 20:20.240
is the redesigned iMac with an M1 chip and the new iPad Pro with an M1 chip.

20:20.240 --> 20:21.560
So let's just break some of this down.

20:21.560 --> 20:25.000
I have the least to say about the podcast subs because it's the least that I know about

20:25.000 --> 20:26.000
right now.

20:26.000 --> 20:27.600
I actually wanted to talk to you about that.

20:27.600 --> 20:28.960
That was the one that really got me.

20:28.960 --> 20:29.960
Well, let's do it.

20:29.960 --> 20:32.000
But no, if you have no comments on it, then you're good.

20:32.000 --> 20:33.560
I mean, I just have to look into it.

20:33.560 --> 20:34.800
So here's what I do know.

20:34.800 --> 20:37.280
It's that 15 to 30% cut ratio.

20:37.280 --> 20:41.220
So for the first year, Apple takes 30%, then it's 15% after that.

20:41.220 --> 20:47.120
They won't require creators to exclusively publish for Apple, but they want you to make

20:47.120 --> 20:51.560
some distinguishing features and you do have to use their tools to publish the member only

20:51.560 --> 20:52.560
item.

20:52.560 --> 20:53.560
Okay.

20:53.560 --> 20:55.320
So they're commoditizing their compliments again, right?

20:55.320 --> 20:58.200
You'll have to use their app and they're going to have a new way to promote podcasts.

20:58.200 --> 21:02.160
All of that leaves me a little concerned, but it doesn't concern me nearly as much as

21:02.160 --> 21:03.960
Spotify does at this point.

21:03.960 --> 21:04.960
Really?

21:04.960 --> 21:07.120
So I thought you'd be here on fire about this one.

21:07.120 --> 21:11.520
I don't love it, but it looks by all intents and purposes, like if it was something the

21:11.520 --> 21:13.040
audience wanted, I would do.

21:13.040 --> 21:17.040
I don't necessarily think that's going to be the case with the J.B. audience, even though

21:17.040 --> 21:20.680
even though I'd say about 25% of our listeners are using Apple podcasts.

21:20.680 --> 21:25.240
Well, no, I just say in general for like the podcasting market, like I thought this would

21:25.240 --> 21:27.960
be something that you would find just bad.

21:27.960 --> 21:33.840
Well, I mean, Spotify, I mean, what they're doing, I mean, I've always found confusing.

21:33.840 --> 21:39.040
It's kind of weird, but this seems like Apple being like, it's better on an iPhone, right?

21:39.040 --> 21:40.200
I don't know.

21:40.200 --> 21:41.200
Yeah, that is true.

21:41.200 --> 21:43.200
It would limit it to iPhone users.

21:43.200 --> 21:46.680
If I were doing an Apple podcast, I could see it.

21:46.680 --> 21:47.880
Maybe boiler alert.

21:47.880 --> 21:50.280
I guarantee ATP is going to do all of this.

21:50.280 --> 21:51.280
You think so?

21:51.280 --> 21:52.280
Yeah.

21:52.280 --> 21:55.680
Why not throw shade at rich millionaires who got lucky because Yahoo is dumb and buys things

21:55.680 --> 21:56.680
they shouldn't.

21:56.680 --> 22:01.540
If your audience was really heavy, like if we had a 60% audience using Apple podcasts,

22:01.540 --> 22:03.840
it might be worth considering.

22:03.840 --> 22:05.440
I think there's a lot of overhead though.

22:05.440 --> 22:08.180
If you want to be featured, there's a lot of there, like you got to do the special kind

22:08.180 --> 22:09.800
of artwork and stuff like that.

22:09.800 --> 22:12.480
But isn't that like part of being in the Apple ecosystem?

22:12.480 --> 22:13.480
Yeah, definitely.

22:13.480 --> 22:14.480
Like really?

22:14.480 --> 22:15.480
Yeah.

22:15.480 --> 22:16.480
It's the same for apps.

22:16.480 --> 22:17.480
Yep.

22:17.480 --> 22:18.480
Absolutely.

22:18.480 --> 22:19.480
Yeah.

22:19.480 --> 22:23.120
This feels like the application of podcasts and soundboard that drew you soundboard that

22:23.120 --> 22:24.240
because you're going to need it.

22:24.240 --> 22:25.320
Oh my God.

22:25.320 --> 22:30.160
I will keep an eye out on that one in particular and I'm so I'm sort of reserving judgment

22:30.160 --> 22:32.240
until further review.

22:32.240 --> 22:36.960
I think the thing that I do like seeing initially is that they're not forcing the content to

22:36.960 --> 22:39.160
be exclusive to Apple.

22:39.160 --> 22:42.400
That seems encouraging because you could take that same content and make it available.

22:42.400 --> 22:44.160
How we make it available to current members.

22:44.160 --> 22:46.520
Again, it's IE6 though.

22:46.520 --> 22:51.800
If there are things that don't work, if you're not an Apple, then I don't know.

22:51.800 --> 22:55.100
I feel like we're always playing the same songs here and maybe it's because we're old

22:55.100 --> 22:56.680
and sad and whatever.

22:56.680 --> 23:00.560
But this is what you get when they turn to a services company is a is a gradual expansion

23:00.560 --> 23:01.840
of what they can monetize.

23:01.840 --> 23:07.900
I am the Apple fanboy on this network, which geez, you guys could have done a lot better

23:07.900 --> 23:13.040
in terms of like actual fanboys of Apple, but like they make beautiful hardware, which

23:13.040 --> 23:17.480
they deprecate mercilessly with the M1 chip after you spend five thousand.

23:17.480 --> 23:21.140
I'm sorry, I get upset.

23:21.140 --> 23:22.140
It's true.

23:22.140 --> 23:23.880
But they do make beautiful hardware.

23:23.880 --> 23:27.000
Honestly, I'm staring at my iMac Pro.

23:27.000 --> 23:31.100
I won't say with hatred, but let's just say the disappointment of a mother who is visiting

23:31.100 --> 23:34.760
her son in prison because he was convicted of rape.

23:34.760 --> 23:38.080
It's pathetic that my MacBook Air can run circles around this machine.

23:38.080 --> 23:41.520
But again, I mean, I forgot what I was talking about.

23:41.520 --> 23:43.320
I just want to smash this thing in the floor.

23:43.320 --> 23:47.680
Yeah, your MacBook Air doesn't have fans.

23:47.680 --> 23:48.680
That's even better.

23:48.680 --> 23:53.880
You're just like, oh, and I sometimes forget to charge it for two or three days and it's

23:53.880 --> 23:55.160
just like fine.

23:55.160 --> 24:00.160
OK, so we probably don't have much to talk about the Apple TV 4K.

24:00.160 --> 24:01.640
They added the H12 CPU.

24:01.640 --> 24:03.480
So yeah, underpowered still for games.

24:03.480 --> 24:04.840
It's kind of disappointing.

24:04.840 --> 24:08.080
If anybody is playing games on Apple TV, they need psychiatric help.

24:08.080 --> 24:10.240
I want to talk to you about purple iMacs.

24:10.240 --> 24:12.280
OK, I want one.

24:12.280 --> 24:18.080
So no, no, no, no qualms about the lack of M1X or anything, huh?

24:18.080 --> 24:19.080
It's purple.

24:19.080 --> 24:20.080
Yeah.

24:20.080 --> 24:21.080
Yeah.

24:21.080 --> 24:22.080
Yeah, that's true.

24:22.080 --> 24:24.360
I mean, this piece of shit here is space gray.

24:24.360 --> 24:26.680
Why would it by the way, why would anything be space gray?

24:26.680 --> 24:27.680
Why don't just call it gray?

24:27.680 --> 24:30.240
They didn't do any space gray because they're not.

24:30.240 --> 24:32.120
None of these are, quote unquote, professional machines.

24:32.120 --> 24:35.920
They're saving the space gray for the professional machine now because they know it's a piece

24:35.920 --> 24:37.360
of garbage.

24:37.360 --> 24:39.760
Anything that space grain and I'm like, yeah, I'm talking to use the ons.

24:39.760 --> 24:40.760
You suck.

24:40.760 --> 24:43.920
They're still selling the Intel, a couple of the Intel iMacs, and one of them still

24:43.920 --> 24:47.160
has a spinning rest hard drive in it for the fusion drive.

24:47.160 --> 24:48.320
I'm obviously joking.

24:48.320 --> 24:49.560
The iMac Pro is a great machine.

24:49.560 --> 24:53.840
I can probably use this for a year or two until I spill something, some liquid that's

24:53.840 --> 24:55.840
definitely not alcoholic into it.

24:55.840 --> 24:56.840
Right.

24:56.840 --> 24:59.560
My lawyer would be very pleased with that statement.

24:59.560 --> 25:05.480
What I will say is the fact that they're selling thousand dollar machines with spinning this.

25:05.480 --> 25:08.160
I mean, it's just embarrassing to be clear.

25:08.160 --> 25:09.400
It's not the M1 machines.

25:09.400 --> 25:10.840
It's the old Intel machines.

25:10.840 --> 25:11.840
But yeah, I agree.

25:11.840 --> 25:12.840
I know.

25:12.840 --> 25:13.840
But like, come on.

25:13.840 --> 25:17.880
Honestly, I think it's pretty pathetic that these new iMacs are coming with a base eight

25:17.880 --> 25:19.400
gigs of RAM.

25:19.400 --> 25:23.000
And nowhere on their website does it say how much RAM these iMacs will take.

25:23.000 --> 25:28.920
So before the show, I called up an Apple sales engineer and got quotes for the show that

25:28.920 --> 25:36.520
they will offer an eight core with 16 gigs of RAM, up to 16 gigs of RAM max, 16 gigs,

25:36.520 --> 25:38.920
two terabytes of storage, 16 gigs of RAM max.

25:38.920 --> 25:40.060
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

25:40.060 --> 25:42.160
These new iMacs max out at 16?

25:42.160 --> 25:43.440
You got it.

25:43.440 --> 25:46.440
Same limitations that the Mini and the Air have and the Mac.

25:46.440 --> 25:53.520
OK, so long time ago and long time ago and months ago, we were talking about the M1 limitations

25:53.520 --> 25:57.360
and one of them was the RAM limitation of 16, right?

25:57.360 --> 25:58.360
Yep.

25:58.360 --> 25:59.360
Do we really think they're struggling?

25:59.360 --> 26:03.040
I mean, I feel like that's a limitation they could have overcome.

26:03.040 --> 26:06.800
But I don't want to say I'm Mac Pro.

26:06.800 --> 26:07.800
I'm sorry.

26:07.800 --> 26:10.240
You have 32 gigs of RAM like a true computer.

26:10.240 --> 26:15.960
I was checking on one of my systems today and I looked and I was using 20, 22, 24 gigs

26:15.960 --> 26:20.800
of my 32 gigs of RAM and I was like, oh, oh, no, I have a spreadsheet that.

26:20.800 --> 26:27.740
So by the way, if you work at Microsoft and you're an Excel programmer on the Mac team,

26:27.740 --> 26:31.800
you need to think about what you've done to my computer.

26:31.800 --> 26:37.320
You sit down, pour yourself a drink and just say, is this what I don't know why running

26:37.320 --> 26:40.920
my payroll tax calculations like maxes out my CPUs?

26:40.920 --> 26:44.600
Yeah, I don't have that many people anymore.

26:44.600 --> 26:45.880
I'm a starving artist.

26:45.880 --> 26:49.880
I'm like Da Vinci, except I'm not, you know, old.

26:49.880 --> 26:51.760
What, you got a vape pen there?

26:51.760 --> 26:53.800
I think you're nuts.

26:53.800 --> 26:56.240
Chris, go fork yourself.

26:56.240 --> 26:57.440
All right.

26:57.440 --> 27:00.720
So listen, 16 gigs is it's just not enough.

27:00.720 --> 27:01.880
And but here's the other thing.

27:01.880 --> 27:04.560
I know it's silly to say it, but because they didn't make a space gray one, this is how

27:04.560 --> 27:05.560
Apple works.

27:05.560 --> 27:07.260
That means this isn't for the professionals.

27:07.260 --> 27:11.360
They're going to replace the 27 inch probably at WWDC or in September.

27:11.360 --> 27:12.960
You know what this is for?

27:12.960 --> 27:14.200
I'll be a jerk.

27:14.200 --> 27:18.300
This is for the digital agency where we're hip and we're branding and you buy the one

27:18.300 --> 27:21.360
that matches the colors of your branding for the receptionist.

27:21.360 --> 27:22.800
Or it's the family computer.

27:22.800 --> 27:25.560
You know, there's some families that still have one computer that they all share that

27:25.560 --> 27:26.560
it could be that.

27:26.560 --> 27:27.560
Yeah.

27:27.560 --> 27:29.140
My son has a Thalia just saying, but keep going.

27:29.140 --> 27:34.160
Did you notice how heavy they went on advertising features like continuity and handoff that

27:34.160 --> 27:35.400
have been around for years?

27:35.400 --> 27:40.120
I mean, I often sell things I built years ago as new features, but I need money.

27:40.120 --> 27:45.600
I think Apple has clearly identified iPhone users that have Windows machines as the target

27:45.600 --> 27:46.840
for these IMAX.

27:46.840 --> 27:49.640
That is 100 percent who these IMAX are for.

27:49.640 --> 27:54.160
And when you go on the IMAX product page today, the bottom half, the whole deal, the rest

27:54.160 --> 27:58.240
of half of the page is really about handoff features and stuff that's been in Mac OS and

27:58.240 --> 27:59.520
iOS for many, many years.

27:59.520 --> 28:01.560
What do you think of the new keyboard?

28:01.560 --> 28:03.760
I like that they put the fingerprint reader in there.

28:03.760 --> 28:05.240
It better be comfortable to type on.

28:05.240 --> 28:09.360
If they may if they've made another lemon keyboard, that's just going to be an unforgivable.

28:09.360 --> 28:11.880
Well, I think it's going to be the magic keyboard, right?

28:11.880 --> 28:13.420
It's got to be a facelift.

28:13.420 --> 28:16.520
Have you ever done any purchases on the computer with Apple Pay?

28:16.520 --> 28:22.040
I've done many, many, many inebriated purchases with Apple Pay.

28:22.040 --> 28:24.200
It's a way, way quicker system.

28:24.200 --> 28:25.520
I like it a lot.

28:25.520 --> 28:29.520
I'll sometimes if I'm in the middle of buying something and I'm on the Mac, which when did

28:29.520 --> 28:30.520
this just recently happen?

28:30.520 --> 28:31.520
This scenario.

28:31.520 --> 28:32.520
Oh, oh, yeah.

28:32.520 --> 28:37.120
I mean, I decided I'd subscribe to Ben Thompson's Dither podcast and I stopped what I was doing

28:37.120 --> 28:42.400
and I went over to the Mac and opened up and opened up Safari and did the transaction in

28:42.400 --> 28:46.120
Safari just so that way I could use Apple Pay because it's so much quicker.

28:46.120 --> 28:47.120
It's so convenient.

28:47.120 --> 28:50.160
It's stupid because it takes care of like all the shipping info, all the name.

28:50.160 --> 28:53.640
You have to fill out all the damn fields and all the payment information.

28:53.640 --> 28:55.760
It just does all of it for you.

28:55.760 --> 28:57.000
It's really slick.

28:57.000 --> 29:01.760
And so having that stuff built in, having the user switching based on your fingerprint

29:01.760 --> 29:05.880
is a slick feature and again, makes it great for the family machine, too.

29:05.880 --> 29:06.880
Okay.

29:06.880 --> 29:09.440
Yeah, I mean, I'm not buying one.

29:09.440 --> 29:11.320
Well, then my cast was.

29:11.320 --> 29:17.000
I thought to myself, if Apple does something with the Mac in this episode, that's an iMac,

29:17.000 --> 29:20.940
I might end up getting one because I have been thinking about just setting up a workstation

29:20.940 --> 29:23.860
here at the studio and that would be perfect.

29:23.860 --> 29:27.440
But I'm not going to do a machine that can only do 16 gigs of RAM.

29:27.440 --> 29:31.600
So because this is an Apple show today, right?

29:31.600 --> 29:35.040
Am I the only one who likes the new AirPods Max?

29:35.040 --> 29:36.200
Do you have a pair?

29:36.200 --> 29:39.720
No, I'm using whatever weird German headphones who gave me.

29:39.720 --> 29:42.680
But if I had the money to burn, I'd certainly try them.

29:42.680 --> 29:43.680
I used to have money.

29:43.680 --> 29:45.840
Oh, wait, this is going in that direction.

29:45.840 --> 29:54.080
One of the things that I have found as a dad who has some ADD that sometimes, sometimes,

29:54.080 --> 29:57.640
you know, it's like ADD gets this fun, cute wrap.

29:57.640 --> 30:03.040
But one of the negative sides of people who actually have something, some sort of attention

30:03.040 --> 30:08.680
deficit disorder is it also means sometimes you lose governance over your own thoughts.

30:08.680 --> 30:12.400
You lose governance over what's on your mind and what you're paying attention to.

30:12.400 --> 30:17.160
And when you have a noisy household, it sometimes robs you of your ability to even think of

30:17.160 --> 30:22.320
a notion or a concept for a few minutes and it gets frustrating and it gets, it gets mentally

30:22.320 --> 30:29.040
tiring as your brain is constantly trying to grasp on to something and it creates a

30:29.040 --> 30:32.960
frustration and a grumpiness and it creates a tiredness.

30:32.960 --> 30:37.080
And what I have found is that, and this is really pronounced for me because I have three

30:37.080 --> 30:43.540
kids and I, like an animal, have chosen to live in a very tiny space.

30:43.540 --> 30:50.640
And so sound isolating headphones have been a game changer for me where I can put something

30:50.640 --> 30:56.660
on and even if I can just bring the volume down 80%, it's like regaining a little bit

30:56.660 --> 30:58.400
of my sanity.

30:58.400 --> 31:02.120
If I, I'm still waiting for like reviews and I've heard they have good sound isolation,

31:02.120 --> 31:06.400
but I can't really get a feel for how they do with like human voice and, and people noise.

31:06.400 --> 31:11.600
But it's just outside my price range for something like that because I have, I have ones that

31:11.600 --> 31:16.000
work well enough now, but if they were superior in that regard, I'd be pretty tempted.

31:16.000 --> 31:21.060
So I'm in this weird place where I live, like my main problem in life is that zoom is hell

31:21.060 --> 31:24.480
and should be outlawed by the Geneva convention.

31:24.480 --> 31:25.680
I'm sorry, I just had a flashback.

31:25.680 --> 31:26.680
What was I saying?

31:26.680 --> 31:30.960
You're thinking you could use this as like a reliable set of zoom headphones that aren't

31:30.960 --> 31:31.960
gamer edition.

31:31.960 --> 31:32.960
Right.

31:32.960 --> 31:35.880
That are always paired to my Mac and I can just pick them up and be like, okay, what

31:35.880 --> 31:36.880
is your complaint?

31:36.880 --> 31:37.880
Right.

31:37.880 --> 31:41.600
But don't you think the little ear air pod ones would probably be better for that job?

31:41.600 --> 31:42.600
Well that's the problem.

31:42.600 --> 31:47.000
The AirPods have actually, like I have the old, old, old AirPods, the original versions.

31:47.000 --> 31:48.000
Yeah.

31:48.000 --> 31:49.000
And you know what?

31:49.000 --> 31:50.000
They're overpriced.

31:50.000 --> 31:51.440
The sound quality is not great.

31:51.440 --> 31:52.440
Yeah.

31:52.440 --> 31:53.440
But you know what?

31:53.440 --> 31:54.440
God damn it.

31:54.440 --> 31:55.440
They've been doing the job for years.

31:55.440 --> 31:56.440
Yeah.

31:56.440 --> 32:00.080
I have definitely had the problem where I've run them down when I've had a lot of meetings

32:00.080 --> 32:04.240
in one day and then I'm doing this game where like I'm popping one in the case for a little

32:04.240 --> 32:06.120
bit and I'm like swapping them back and forth.

32:06.120 --> 32:07.120
Yeah.

32:07.120 --> 32:08.560
I've had, yeah, I've had that after a while.

32:08.560 --> 32:09.560
To me, they're like adium.

32:09.560 --> 32:15.360
You know, they've got some troubles, but you know, we should apologize to the Coderadio

32:15.360 --> 32:16.840
kids.

32:16.840 --> 32:22.160
There is a decade plus of backstory here on just everything we're talking about.

32:22.160 --> 32:23.160
That's true.

32:23.160 --> 32:26.600
Also, is it me or the new iMacs look like next products?

32:26.600 --> 32:28.800
There's a surprising lack of branding on the front too.

32:28.800 --> 32:33.040
When I saw them, they looked like those, no, but design, they looked like those computers

32:33.040 --> 32:36.960
you see on TV where they tape over the logo and it's just generic computer.

32:36.960 --> 32:41.360
You know, it's like a Mac under there, but they've taped over the Apple logo, you know,

32:41.360 --> 32:44.760
that's what they look like and they really don't have much less chin than your iMac

32:44.760 --> 32:45.760
pro does today.

32:45.760 --> 32:50.880
No, it looks very, I'm sorry, but it looks very nineties Apple slash next.

32:50.880 --> 32:54.040
I think what's going to sell some of these though for some people is I think these are

32:54.040 --> 32:55.040
fanless.

32:55.040 --> 32:56.040
I'm not positive.

32:56.040 --> 32:58.320
They might not be, they might be a small fan in there, but I bet you they're very quiet.

32:58.320 --> 33:04.400
One though, if I ran a company, let's call it blue ocean or let's say green, green grass

33:04.400 --> 33:13.560
or pink, nevermind, let's just move on, silver, silver surfer, yellow, silver fox.

33:13.560 --> 33:14.560
Come on.

33:14.560 --> 33:15.560
I know you, that's what you ought to call it.

33:15.560 --> 33:20.680
Let me tell you some, if you want to have a special about cougars, I'm ready and able

33:20.680 --> 33:23.640
and I'm, you're going to get a little gray, you know, in there, you're going to all of

33:23.640 --> 33:27.160
a sudden you're just starting to look all dignified and no, no, no, you don't understand.

33:27.160 --> 33:32.960
And I, listen, I'm in my thirties and I have been undercover doing this operation for you.

33:32.960 --> 33:35.120
Yeah, and I can report back.

33:35.120 --> 33:36.760
This might be an unfiltered episode though.

33:36.760 --> 33:37.760
Yeah.

33:37.760 --> 33:39.760
Are you sharing like some breaking news with us?

33:39.760 --> 33:43.520
This is CNN breaking news.

33:43.520 --> 33:44.520
Yes.

33:44.520 --> 33:45.520
Code radio listeners.

33:45.520 --> 33:49.280
And I do apologize to the angry dads and moms who email us.

33:49.280 --> 33:51.360
Mike does love women 10 years older than him.

33:51.360 --> 33:57.360
So at least if you are not 44, this is, this is the episode where we really learned that

33:57.360 --> 34:00.720
Mike definitely has a thing for president president Roslyn for sure.

34:00.720 --> 34:06.680
I can't explain, you know what, Jar Jar, Jar Jar, my man, you're great.

34:06.680 --> 34:09.520
You sort of suck cause you're incompetent.

34:09.520 --> 34:11.120
Madam president.

34:11.120 --> 34:12.120
I love you.

34:12.120 --> 34:14.000
You better brace yourself for some heartbreak, my friend.

34:14.000 --> 34:16.360
I just saying you got some, you got some VSG to watch.

34:16.360 --> 34:17.360
I'm only halfway through.

34:17.360 --> 34:18.360
Why?

34:18.360 --> 34:19.360
No, she's got to win.

34:19.360 --> 34:20.360
Oh yeah.

34:20.360 --> 34:21.360
I don't.

34:21.360 --> 34:24.260
Beltar is like, Oh, I'm going to be president because I'm Beltar and I'm an asshole.

34:24.260 --> 34:26.160
He is such a jerk.

34:26.160 --> 34:27.720
I just want to choke that guy.

34:27.720 --> 34:30.040
Like I just, and I don't want to do it like quickly.

34:30.040 --> 34:32.160
I just want to watch him suffer.

34:32.160 --> 34:33.160
We should move on.

34:33.160 --> 34:38.320
So what are the odds on you buying one of these IMAX zero, zero, zero.

34:38.320 --> 34:42.040
I run VMs all day, every day, but you're, you're making it work with the eye with that

34:42.040 --> 34:46.360
there air air, which has doubled the memory of one of these IMAX.

34:46.360 --> 34:47.360
Your pro does.

34:47.360 --> 34:48.360
Oh yeah.

34:48.360 --> 34:49.360
Yeah.

34:49.360 --> 34:50.360
Okay.

34:50.360 --> 34:51.360
That's where you're doing it.

34:51.360 --> 34:52.360
I see.

34:52.360 --> 34:53.360
Not, not my pro.

34:53.360 --> 34:54.360
My, uh, my, uh, my, even my air has 16.

34:54.360 --> 34:55.360
Yeah.

34:55.360 --> 34:56.360
Well you can get these with 16, these IMAX, but that's it.

34:56.360 --> 34:57.360
No more than 16.

34:57.360 --> 34:58.360
That's it.

34:58.360 --> 34:59.360
I don't know.

34:59.360 --> 35:04.840
I mean, you know what, as much as I dunk on the IMAX pro, it's the undersecretary of almost,

35:04.840 --> 35:05.840
okay.

35:05.840 --> 35:06.840
I don't know.

35:06.840 --> 35:08.200
Like it's a good machine.

35:08.200 --> 35:13.360
It's better than, yeah, it's just loud and kind of hot.

35:13.360 --> 35:16.900
You and that IMAX have been through the war and back and you know, it's had your back

35:16.900 --> 35:21.480
many times, but if you're honest with yourself, it's just not quite been the same since it

35:21.480 --> 35:24.800
had the spider in its screen and it had to be taken out to get cleaned.

35:24.800 --> 35:28.160
It's never quite been the same, but that's all right.

35:28.160 --> 35:29.160
You still love it.

35:29.160 --> 35:38.280
I just want to say the CIMAC has never left me loyal to the end.

35:38.280 --> 35:40.400
Datadog.com slash coder radio.

35:40.400 --> 35:43.680
This is a tool that's going to solve some problems and to help you visualize and communicate

35:43.680 --> 35:47.720
with your team, analyze code level performance across your environment and troubleshoot issues

35:47.720 --> 35:50.200
faster with Datadog.

35:50.200 --> 35:53.840
Datadog has this thing called the continuous profile and it automatically collects profiles

35:53.840 --> 35:57.800
from your production servers all the time, and then you can go back and analyze your

35:57.800 --> 36:02.080
data quickly with minimal overhead and get a unified picture of your environment by correlating

36:02.080 --> 36:07.480
code performance metrics with other monitoring data in real time in their dashboards and

36:07.480 --> 36:10.480
their dashboards are gorgeous.

36:10.480 --> 36:11.480
You got to go check that out.

36:11.480 --> 36:14.760
Just go to datadog.com slash coder radio for that.

36:14.760 --> 36:16.760
But what they do is they bring it all together with integrations.

36:16.760 --> 36:18.720
You can plug into other applications and APIs.

36:18.720 --> 36:23.380
Of course, they got tracing across the entire application stack, log management, that continuous

36:23.380 --> 36:28.360
profiler I mentioned, and it brings it all together in one platform.

36:28.360 --> 36:29.640
One platform.

36:29.640 --> 36:31.200
One place.

36:31.200 --> 36:35.680
Datadog enables you to pinpoint the root cause of issues faster than ever.

36:35.680 --> 36:42.000
So go try Datadog out for free for 14 days by visiting datadog.com slash coder radio.

36:42.000 --> 36:43.000
Here's the deal.

36:43.000 --> 36:45.680
It's been a while since there's been events with swag.

36:45.680 --> 36:49.480
So for a limited time, if you start a trial and create one dashboard, you'll get a free

36:49.480 --> 36:54.680
Datadog t-shirt, but you got to go to datadog.com slash coder radio.

36:54.680 --> 36:59.320
That's datadog.com slash coder radio.

36:59.320 --> 37:04.360
You know what surprised me the most from the event was the iPad Pro.

37:04.360 --> 37:07.160
I love the way Apple leaned into this.

37:07.160 --> 37:11.480
I don't know if you saw this, but this was the best part of the event when Mission Impossible

37:11.480 --> 37:15.400
style they have a burglar come in, you know, they go down a duct, they're down on a wire

37:15.400 --> 37:20.280
pass lasers, he breaks in, he steals the M1 CPU and then he busts into another room and

37:20.280 --> 37:25.560
he puts it in the iPad, he closes the case and then the camera pans around and the burglar

37:25.560 --> 37:32.640
pulls off the mask and it's Tim Cook and then they say, we've added an M1 to the iPad and

37:32.640 --> 37:37.320
they just went all in on just putting the best chip they've got in the iPad now.

37:37.320 --> 37:38.320
Okay.

37:38.320 --> 37:44.120
I mean, but I don't give a crap unless they're going to change the app store guidelines.

37:44.120 --> 37:45.120
It doesn't matter.

37:45.120 --> 37:49.360
It really doesn't, you know, so they got eight core CPU in there.

37:49.360 --> 37:54.380
They're saying it's 50% improvements over just the last one and they put Thunderbolt

37:54.380 --> 37:56.400
in this thing, which is brilliant.

37:56.400 --> 37:59.680
It has proper external display, but you're not allowed to use it.

37:59.680 --> 38:04.880
It has all this nice stuff, faster storage, two terabytes, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

38:04.880 --> 38:09.480
And I'm sitting here going, okay, great, but give me the OS and the applications that can

38:09.480 --> 38:13.660
take advantage of any of this or just stop reviewing apps for functionality and allow

38:13.660 --> 38:16.120
any non malware app in.

38:16.120 --> 38:21.640
And then this very powerful, by the way, it was powerful two years ago when Lana Del Rey,

38:21.640 --> 38:27.400
oh, by the way, Lana Del Rey, lovely, did her little presentation, right?

38:27.400 --> 38:29.420
The problem has not been the hardware.

38:29.420 --> 38:34.120
The problem is their insane policies, why they want to gimp the iPad.

38:34.120 --> 38:37.920
I mean, I think it's worse than that though, because I think the OS also is limited in

38:37.920 --> 38:39.840
a lot of ways, especially on the iPad.

38:39.840 --> 38:46.520
There are sneaky, hacky, old school Mac OS and the next step things in iPad OS.

38:46.520 --> 38:51.780
So spoiler alert, it's all basically next step OS with lipstick on it.

38:51.780 --> 38:52.920
That's why we love it.

38:52.920 --> 38:54.920
I say that in air quotes, right?

38:54.920 --> 38:57.120
But Apple won't let you put that in the app store.

38:57.120 --> 39:02.040
I feel like what we might be in the middle of is part two of this story.

39:02.040 --> 39:07.840
I mean, why do you bother even putting 16 gig, Mike, Mike, six, this thing can get up

39:07.840 --> 39:12.040
to 16 gigs of RAM in an iPad, Mike.

39:12.040 --> 39:17.100
If you spec at a 12.9 inch iPad all the way out with 5g and 16 gigs of RAM and two terabytes

39:17.100 --> 39:23.560
of storage, and I am definitely not doing that right now, but yeah, keep going $2,400.

39:23.560 --> 39:25.560
That's how much an iPad would cost spec'd out.

39:25.560 --> 39:27.480
That's just like one week of running a meth lab.

39:27.480 --> 39:33.060
It actually is more expensive than the highest tier M1 MacBook pro and the MacBook air with

39:33.060 --> 39:34.420
all the available upgrades.

39:34.420 --> 39:35.760
It's more expensive than that.

39:35.760 --> 39:36.760
All right, fair boy.

39:36.760 --> 39:39.880
Then let me ask you, let me, let's turn this around on you.

39:39.880 --> 39:45.200
Why don't they just let the iPad loose just so you know what iPad apps and you could separate

39:45.200 --> 39:52.360
them from iPhone apps are in fact full computer applications and right, cause it's iPad OS.

39:52.360 --> 39:53.600
It's a different OS too.

39:53.600 --> 39:54.600
It's really not.

39:54.600 --> 39:58.520
But I know, I know, but I'm playing, you know, I'm playing along, but like should just have

39:58.520 --> 39:59.760
like, you know what?

39:59.760 --> 40:03.080
If you're dumb enough to download something stupid, then right, right.

40:03.080 --> 40:05.280
Well, and like I said, I think it was just last week.

40:05.280 --> 40:09.040
It's like just turn on that gatekeeper crap that they have on the Mac and do notarization

40:09.040 --> 40:11.320
and problem solved on the iPad.

40:11.320 --> 40:12.360
I don't think we're going to get that.

40:12.360 --> 40:13.360
I think that's ridiculous.

40:13.360 --> 40:18.320
It's never going to happen, but this is so clearly part one of a two part story for the

40:18.320 --> 40:19.320
iPad.

40:19.320 --> 40:20.320
Okay.

40:20.320 --> 40:21.320
What's part two?

40:21.320 --> 40:22.600
Part two is WWDC and iOS 15 on the iPad.

40:22.600 --> 40:24.120
No, but what, what is part two?

40:24.120 --> 40:25.520
Like in your, okay.

40:25.520 --> 40:34.240
So the, the problem I have been covetching about Mazel Tov is not the hardware or even

40:34.240 --> 40:39.600
the APIs, but Apple's insane policies for the iPad.

40:39.600 --> 40:40.600
It's got to be both.

40:40.600 --> 40:43.880
It's got to be a change of policies, a change in app store.

40:43.880 --> 40:44.880
Range of policy.

40:44.880 --> 40:45.880
Yep.

40:45.880 --> 40:46.880
Yep.

40:46.880 --> 40:47.880
And, or no, no, I'm sorry.

40:47.880 --> 40:49.720
An update in policies and update.

40:49.720 --> 40:50.720
Dude, you're high.

40:50.720 --> 40:51.720
Like, come on.

40:51.720 --> 40:57.280
No, no way that they're not going to let developers, like what they need to do is let developers

40:57.280 --> 41:00.740
treat the iPad as it were a windows and you can write any application you want and sell

41:00.740 --> 41:02.280
it the way you want to.

41:02.280 --> 41:03.280
I don't know.

41:03.280 --> 41:04.280
I don't know if that's going to go that far.

41:04.280 --> 41:06.960
I think there'll be some concession in regards to apps.

41:06.960 --> 41:11.560
It'll be something dumb like interapp operability and then we're going to find out a year later

41:11.560 --> 41:15.200
that other developers who are big names have had that before.

41:15.200 --> 41:19.080
Just like the 15% thing where it turns out Netflix and Amazon had that for two years.

41:19.080 --> 41:23.720
I think that's exactly, that's, that's the line I'm thinking combined with maybe windowing

41:23.720 --> 41:29.640
in iPad OS or something like that to change how you can manage multiple applications because.

41:29.640 --> 41:30.920
I'm going to push back on windowing.

41:30.920 --> 41:36.120
I think the iPad is the perfect device for pop OS slash magnet on Mac OS tiling.

41:36.120 --> 41:37.120
Yeah, tiling.

41:37.120 --> 41:38.120
Yeah, absolutely.

41:38.120 --> 41:42.500
Or they could even come up and I think they've prototyped a tabbing type where you basically

41:42.500 --> 41:46.400
have tabs and you know, that's maybe up on the corner or a pull down tab screen and you

41:46.400 --> 41:50.360
can tab between your apps and I don't know what they would do there, but something where

41:50.360 --> 41:54.600
you could move information between screens easier, stuff like that.

41:54.600 --> 41:57.960
It just seems like they have to know that they've added a keyboard, a mouse, 16 gigs

41:57.960 --> 42:03.920
of RAM, two terabytes of storage, and this crazy ass pro XDR type display they have on

42:03.920 --> 42:04.920
the iPad pro.

42:04.920 --> 42:08.600
None of it really makes sense unless the iPad can do more.

42:08.600 --> 42:12.380
There's no reason to spend $2,400 on this machine unless it can do more.

42:12.380 --> 42:13.720
Let me just undercut my whole argument.

42:13.720 --> 42:16.060
I'm going to buy one of these and I'm going to try to build the app I've been dreaming

42:16.060 --> 42:23.380
about for two decades and when it gets rejected, my God, we're going to have some content Chris.

42:23.380 --> 42:27.660
Developer Steve Troughton Smith on Twitter says putting M1 in the iPad without a software

42:27.660 --> 42:32.160
story to explain why it needs the extra hardware and features and power offered by M1 like

42:32.160 --> 42:37.440
Thunderbolt really feels like foreshadowing, implying foreshadowing for WWDC.

42:37.440 --> 42:38.440
You know what?

42:38.440 --> 42:41.240
I got to tell you, I'm all in an iPad.

42:41.240 --> 42:42.240
Okay.

42:42.240 --> 42:44.280
Old Coder Radio listeners, you know, I believe in tablet computing.

42:44.280 --> 42:45.280
Yep.

42:45.280 --> 42:46.840
I lost a lot of money.

42:46.840 --> 42:48.880
Well you went with the windows Metro.

42:48.880 --> 42:49.880
Who me?

42:49.880 --> 42:50.880
Windows eight man.

42:50.880 --> 42:51.880
Yeah, you, you did.

42:51.880 --> 42:54.560
You got all in on the Microsoft hype, brah.

42:54.560 --> 42:58.880
See they went, they went around this same route, but Apple is doing it in a, they start

42:58.880 --> 43:03.400
with the basic tablet and they've built up a pencil and now they've added a keyboard

43:03.400 --> 43:04.400
and now they've.

43:04.400 --> 43:08.040
Can I just say that like the Microsoft problem was the hardware was crap and it didn't last

43:08.040 --> 43:09.280
long enough.

43:09.280 --> 43:11.760
And the Apple problem is the hardware is amazing.

43:11.760 --> 43:12.760
Yeah.

43:12.760 --> 43:13.760
Right?

43:13.760 --> 43:16.720
Like, and they're just like jerks about how you could monetize your business.

43:16.720 --> 43:17.720
Yeah.

43:17.720 --> 43:18.720
And the OS is limited too.

43:18.720 --> 43:20.120
You know, it's a double whammy for sure.

43:20.120 --> 43:21.120
Yeah.

43:21.120 --> 43:22.120
The API is our tie.

43:22.120 --> 43:26.880
I personally think if you know enough about objective C and if you don't, you deserve

43:26.880 --> 43:30.960
to be lined up and shot, but that's, what was I going with this?

43:30.960 --> 43:34.400
Just a classic story there.

43:34.400 --> 43:35.400
I wonder.

43:35.400 --> 43:36.400
So here's my thought, Mike.

43:36.400 --> 43:37.400
I've had gay bars.

43:37.400 --> 43:38.400
Yes.

43:38.400 --> 43:42.060
No, no, that's not where I was going, but you know, you never know.

43:42.060 --> 43:43.060
What are you high?

43:43.060 --> 43:47.060
But what I was, if this thing has thunderbolt and now they're claiming to add proper external

43:47.060 --> 43:48.280
monitor support.

43:48.280 --> 43:49.280
Go for it.

43:49.280 --> 43:50.280
I want to hear it.

43:50.280 --> 43:51.280
I love where you're going.

43:51.280 --> 43:58.460
But could you get a stand and take a thunderbolt dock with say a wired keyboard and audio interface

43:58.460 --> 44:02.960
and ethernet port and display port with a monitor hooked up to it and plug that in doing

44:02.960 --> 44:08.360
power pass through, plug that into the iPad and get a full monitor keyboard mouse.

44:08.360 --> 44:11.160
I think if you can't, it's retarded to have thunderbolt.

44:11.160 --> 44:12.160
Yeah.

44:12.160 --> 44:13.160
Yeah.

44:13.160 --> 44:14.440
It has thunderbolt has to be doing more than just storage.

44:14.440 --> 44:15.440
Yeah.

44:15.440 --> 44:16.440
That has to work.

44:16.440 --> 44:17.720
I mean, come on.

44:17.720 --> 44:19.260
No one on an iPad.

44:19.260 --> 44:20.880
No one needs that much data transfer.

44:20.880 --> 44:21.880
I'm sorry.

44:21.880 --> 44:22.880
Yeah.

44:22.880 --> 44:23.880
What are you going to do?

44:23.880 --> 44:27.600
Especially because of how locked down the file transfer API is iOS, which by the way,

44:27.600 --> 44:33.400
I was going to run a fantastic blue ray backup program to the iPad backup.

44:33.400 --> 44:38.520
Oh, that would be sweet, but you can't do it because they don't allow that.

44:38.520 --> 44:42.520
If I did not have an iPad pro today, I'd be picking up the 12.9 inch iPad.

44:42.520 --> 44:47.280
I would not be speccing it out like crazy, but I'm definitely not on the checkout screen.

44:47.280 --> 44:49.200
Let me tell you what I'm not doing.

44:49.200 --> 44:50.200
Okay.

44:50.200 --> 44:51.200
What are you going to not do?

44:51.200 --> 44:52.200
Yeah.

44:52.200 --> 44:57.240
I'm not going to personalize this one and say Chris's hair is fantastic that I'm just

44:57.240 --> 44:59.680
not going to definitely not doing that right.

44:59.680 --> 45:00.680
Okay.

45:00.680 --> 45:01.680
I didn't just upgrade it to 250.

45:01.680 --> 45:02.680
Sure.

45:02.680 --> 45:03.680
Sure.

45:03.680 --> 45:04.680
$1,200.

45:04.680 --> 45:05.680
Whoa.

45:05.680 --> 45:06.680
$1,200 to go to 256.

45:06.680 --> 45:07.680
Yeah.

45:07.680 --> 45:08.680
That's a lot of money.

45:08.680 --> 45:13.120
Are you looking at, is that the old one too, or is that the new one?

45:13.120 --> 45:14.120
New one.

45:14.120 --> 45:15.120
Oh my God.

45:15.120 --> 45:18.040
The base model is almost 1100, 1099.

45:18.040 --> 45:19.160
It's a lot.

45:19.160 --> 45:20.160
That's a lot.

45:20.160 --> 45:21.160
It's just so much.

45:21.160 --> 45:22.160
It's more than a computer.

45:22.160 --> 45:23.440
So it really has to be doing more.

45:23.440 --> 45:25.360
And this doesn't even have an LTE chip.

45:25.360 --> 45:26.360
Oh.

45:26.360 --> 45:27.360
I know.

45:27.360 --> 45:28.920
And the LTE is very, very useful.

45:28.920 --> 45:30.680
I have found that to be very true.

45:30.680 --> 45:32.800
And they charge a lot of money for that.

45:32.800 --> 45:34.320
I don't know about that.

45:34.320 --> 45:40.440
If I didn't have a perfectly functional iPad that is perfectly fast, I might be tempted,

45:40.440 --> 45:41.440
but it's just the cost.

45:41.440 --> 45:42.440
It's just outrageous.

45:42.440 --> 45:43.680
My kid dropped mine and broke it.

45:43.680 --> 45:49.000
So I'm in the market, but damn, that's a lot of money.

45:49.000 --> 45:55.080
So do you think we're going to get a more pro line of iMac, like a 27 inch iMac at WWDC

45:55.080 --> 45:56.080
with an MX1?

45:56.080 --> 45:57.080
Yeah.

45:57.080 --> 45:58.080
I think we are.

45:58.080 --> 45:59.080
Because you know what?

45:59.080 --> 46:03.760
Because they made it 24 inches and I think they're going to start using size, screen

46:03.760 --> 46:07.680
size as a demarcation in RAM.

46:07.680 --> 46:08.680
I'm thinking that too.

46:08.680 --> 46:09.680
RAM.

46:09.680 --> 46:13.520
Anything that does more than 16 gig is more engineered at professionals and it'll probably

46:13.520 --> 46:19.120
be space gray, you know, boring colors for professionals as they like to do.

46:19.120 --> 46:24.320
I also just as a total aside, because I can't help myself, I also wonder because the iPad

46:24.320 --> 46:29.080
Pro has the M1 and these new iMacs have the M1, if Hector Martin and his team over at

46:29.080 --> 46:33.440
Ashi Linux are successful and we're getting Linux working on the M1, it should be functional

46:33.440 --> 46:39.840
on all of the machines that Apple announced today, which is pretty cool.

46:39.840 --> 46:45.680
They're getting the initial boot support merged in kernel 5.13, which is the next kernel after

46:45.680 --> 46:50.320
the one that comes out this weekend, and including a brand new bootloader to help manage kind

46:50.320 --> 46:52.120
of Apple's unique boot environment.

46:52.120 --> 46:54.600
And that's all getting merged into kernel 5.13.

46:54.600 --> 46:58.560
5.12 comes out this weekend, so it's really not that far away.

46:58.560 --> 47:03.600
And then once they get that working, it's just drivers development, but I forget her

47:03.600 --> 47:09.580
name, but this software developer who is working on GPU support for Linux has already got like

47:09.580 --> 47:17.080
the full OpenGL style cube spinning on Linux on the M1 GPU.

47:17.080 --> 47:20.480
They've got basic 3D instructions working already.

47:20.480 --> 47:25.800
So they're making really good progress, and it appears that the M1 hardware loads some

47:25.800 --> 47:30.760
of the firmware blobs necessary to initialize that hardware outside and independent of the

47:30.760 --> 47:34.520
OS, so some of that stuff just comes up when the machine comes up and they don't have to

47:34.520 --> 47:38.720
fool with it at all in Linux, which is saving them some time.

47:38.720 --> 47:40.700
And now it's just figuring out the driver fundamentals.

47:40.700 --> 47:45.740
But you know, the fact that they're drawing a cube and can spin it on the M1, that's a

47:45.740 --> 47:46.740
big step.

47:46.740 --> 47:47.740
They can do it.

47:47.740 --> 47:49.740
Yeah, that's a big step.

47:49.740 --> 47:54.340
If that happens, if they get to a point where they say you can get the desktop running and

47:54.340 --> 47:59.100
you can use a web browser or something like that, I will buy whatever M1 is on the market

47:59.100 --> 48:01.560
at the time, even if it's not an M1X.

48:01.560 --> 48:02.560
That'll be the moment.

48:02.560 --> 48:07.080
Drew, just, you know, you know what to do.

48:07.080 --> 48:09.060
Run the market if it runs Linux.

48:09.060 --> 48:13.020
Until then, they're going to have to do something more impressive to get me to switch.

48:13.020 --> 48:17.460
Not that I don't think the M1 has plenty of performance, but if I'm going to make that

48:17.460 --> 48:21.920
kind of transition, it's got to be something that will last me years because of the prices

48:21.920 --> 48:23.480
of these machines.

48:23.480 --> 48:24.480
So we shall see.

48:24.480 --> 48:28.700
I think it's going to be maybe WWDC, maybe September.

48:28.700 --> 48:34.740
My last thoughts are, like always, Apple is a step above everyone else in video production

48:34.740 --> 48:35.740
quality.

48:35.740 --> 48:40.480
Apple felt a little different for this event, but they nailed it right on the hour mark,

48:40.480 --> 48:44.180
right as my recorder was hitting an hour, they were wrapping it up.

48:44.180 --> 48:48.500
And they really outdid themselves once again with all of the transitions.

48:48.500 --> 48:52.980
And I like this new thing that's happening on YouTube where there are a couple of creators

48:52.980 --> 48:56.460
who have just taken all of the transitions and put that in a video.

48:56.460 --> 48:58.620
I'll have one of those linked in the show notes.

48:58.620 --> 49:01.980
And even if you don't watch the rest of the event, it's worth watching the transitions

49:01.980 --> 49:04.620
because they do a hell of a video production on these.

49:04.620 --> 49:06.660
And so we'll have that linked in the show notes.

49:06.660 --> 49:12.260
And then our commentary of the live event itself with the whole thing with minimal commentary,

49:12.260 --> 49:16.380
that'll be linked in the show notes and it starts about 24 minutes in.

49:16.380 --> 49:17.980
They really do a fantastic job though.

49:17.980 --> 49:23.300
So if you are even somewhat curious and want something you could watch for an hour, it's

49:23.300 --> 49:26.940
worth checking out because they do a hell of a job and you get a little more information

49:26.940 --> 49:27.940
in there.

49:27.940 --> 49:33.100
So we survived an event without either one of us going broke.

49:33.100 --> 49:36.820
And overall, I think probably pretty good stuff.

49:36.820 --> 49:41.480
The theme that I keep coming away with here is that Apple has a real hit on their hands

49:41.480 --> 49:45.260
with this M1 stuff, so much so that they just went full in on calling it that in the iPad

49:45.260 --> 49:46.260
too.

49:46.260 --> 49:52.640
And I have seen a lot of interest from general people out there in the world following this

49:52.640 --> 49:55.500
stuff that just like tech in a way they haven't seen for a while.

49:55.500 --> 49:59.300
And it still plays into my fear that it's going to be appealing to a lot of techies.

49:59.300 --> 50:06.180
Some long term friends I know, Mike, one of them, I guess, was the developer of a desktop

50:06.180 --> 50:11.900
environment that people in the audience would know of, has just walked away from burnout

50:11.900 --> 50:13.860
and bought himself a MacBook Air.

50:13.860 --> 50:17.120
Well, of course, because he deserves to have a life and be happy.

50:17.120 --> 50:19.100
That's what happens to Linux developers.

50:19.100 --> 50:21.900
It's anecdotal, but I keep hearing stories from people.

50:21.900 --> 50:22.980
No, I don't think it is.

50:22.980 --> 50:26.500
I think, you know what, I'm sorry.

50:26.500 --> 50:29.660
You can't develop a Linux desktop environment and be happy.

50:29.660 --> 50:30.660
You just can't.

50:30.660 --> 50:32.220
It's a challenge for sure.

50:32.220 --> 50:35.300
I like how you were like, I can't say yes to that.

50:35.300 --> 50:38.140
I heard from somebody after I mean, I heard from a few people that like you guys are way

50:38.140 --> 50:43.100
off, but I heard from people that are actually creating apps and or a desktop environment.

50:43.100 --> 50:46.140
And I heard basically you spot on and it's really burning me out.

50:46.140 --> 50:51.060
I heard from one individual who I won't share their name said that there are just glaring

50:51.060 --> 50:54.780
technical issues in the Linux desktop that we're not addressing and people that are not

50:54.780 --> 50:56.860
acknowledging it are not helping.

50:56.860 --> 50:58.740
They're harming the desktop.

50:58.740 --> 51:04.620
Well, first of all, and forgive me, Master Chris, this is Coder radio, not Linux radio,

51:04.620 --> 51:05.620
right?

51:05.620 --> 51:06.620
I don't give a crap about Linux.

51:06.620 --> 51:07.620
I mean, I like Linux.

51:07.620 --> 51:09.420
I'm very friendly with the system.

51:09.420 --> 51:12.940
Seventy six people competition makes everyone better.

51:12.940 --> 51:14.980
And I'm just I'll put my cards on the table.

51:14.980 --> 51:20.260
I think right now Apple is winning because this M1 chip is an ace, right?

51:20.260 --> 51:22.660
This is it's the ace of Trump.

51:22.660 --> 51:28.340
It takes every trick and that is a card playing term, not what you idiots think it is.

51:28.340 --> 51:34.380
But that doesn't mean that like Dell or Seventy six or what's that stupid Linux vendor you

51:34.380 --> 51:35.380
like?

51:35.380 --> 51:36.380
Wow.

51:36.380 --> 51:37.980
They'll never advertise on this show.

51:37.980 --> 51:38.980
Purism.

51:38.980 --> 51:39.980
You're thinking of purism.

51:39.980 --> 51:40.980
Purism.

51:40.980 --> 51:41.980
Yeah, that's the one I think is incompetent.

51:41.980 --> 51:42.980
Yeah.

51:42.980 --> 51:48.180
Because you guys are morons and you believe in false, which is a waste of time.

51:48.180 --> 51:49.180
Wow.

51:49.180 --> 51:50.180
Is this BSD radio?

51:50.180 --> 51:51.820
Because it feels a lot like it.

51:51.820 --> 51:56.060
Chopping bombs, chopping bombs, pow, pow.

51:56.060 --> 51:57.340
Resoft, there's a waste of time.

51:57.340 --> 51:58.340
It should all be BSD.

51:58.340 --> 51:59.340
Woo.

51:59.340 --> 52:00.340
There.

52:00.340 --> 52:01.340
Ooh la la.

52:01.340 --> 52:02.340
We're done.

52:02.340 --> 52:03.340
Free BSD.

52:03.340 --> 52:04.340
Thank you.

52:04.340 --> 52:05.340
Thank you very much.

52:05.340 --> 52:06.340
Good night, everybody.

52:06.340 --> 52:07.340
Yes.

52:07.340 --> 52:08.780
No, I think they have done a tremendous job.

52:08.780 --> 52:11.780
I think they are being very competitive and if we're being honest, they've brought the

52:11.780 --> 52:12.780
fight.

52:12.780 --> 52:13.780
I've thought about this too recently.

52:13.780 --> 52:19.740
You know, isn't GNOME 40's adoption of a horizontal workspace layout kind of an acknowledgement

52:19.740 --> 52:23.460
that Apple was right when they implemented a horizontal workspace layout?

52:23.460 --> 52:24.460
Shh.

52:24.460 --> 52:25.460
Do not tell.

52:25.460 --> 52:27.580
No, you can't say that to them.

52:27.580 --> 52:28.580
That's uncomfortable.

52:28.580 --> 52:29.580
Okay.

52:29.580 --> 52:30.580
Okay.

52:30.580 --> 52:32.260
Why are you trying to trigger the neckbeards?

52:32.260 --> 52:33.340
No, no, no.

52:33.340 --> 52:38.060
I'm just trying to point out, I'm just trying to point out that there is room for improvement,

52:38.060 --> 52:42.100
but I think I completely, totally respect and appreciate the position of people who

52:42.100 --> 52:43.980
wrote it and said, I don't care, man.

52:43.980 --> 52:46.080
I just, you know, I want my Honda Accord.

52:46.080 --> 52:47.420
I want to get in my Honda Accord.

52:47.420 --> 52:50.780
I want it to drive me to work so I can get my job done and I want to drive me home and

52:50.780 --> 52:52.060
I don't want to spend a bunch.

52:52.060 --> 52:53.060
That's right.

52:53.060 --> 52:55.660
Cause Fonda rolls a Honda and she's got back.

52:55.660 --> 52:57.220
I agree.

52:57.220 --> 52:58.340
You know it, boy.

52:58.340 --> 52:59.340
You know it.

52:59.340 --> 53:01.020
Mr. Dominic, do you have anything you want to plug this week?

53:01.020 --> 53:05.700
I guess if somebody is making more than $75,000 a year on making a Linux desktop application,

53:05.700 --> 53:06.700
let us know.

53:06.700 --> 53:07.700
There might be a Thaleo in it for you.

53:07.700 --> 53:09.140
Is the bet still on or is it over now?

53:09.140 --> 53:13.140
I mean, I'm willing to keep that bet forever because I know I'm never going to lose, but

53:13.140 --> 53:14.140
what do I win?

53:14.140 --> 53:15.140
Hang on.

53:15.140 --> 53:16.140
What do you win?

53:16.140 --> 53:17.140
At some point I have to win something.

53:17.140 --> 53:18.140
Maybe.

53:18.140 --> 53:19.140
Oh, okay.

53:19.140 --> 53:20.140
Okay.

53:20.140 --> 53:21.140
What?

53:21.140 --> 53:22.140
I have something here.

53:22.140 --> 53:23.140
Okay.

53:23.140 --> 53:24.140
What?

53:24.140 --> 53:27.860
If the robes actually ship, which I know they will, you're amazing.

53:27.860 --> 53:32.020
I'm thinking smoking jackets, Coder Radio only smoking jackets.

53:32.020 --> 53:33.780
Oh, that'd be good.

53:33.780 --> 53:34.780
That'd be good.

53:34.780 --> 53:38.340
And I will do the operations on it this time and I will take all the pain.

53:38.340 --> 53:40.540
Man, I thought you were going to say something about Seuss.

53:40.540 --> 53:43.860
I seriously thought you were going to be like, you have to run Seuss for a week or?

53:43.860 --> 53:44.860
Nope.

53:44.860 --> 53:45.860
No Seuss.

53:45.860 --> 53:46.860
No Seuss.

53:46.860 --> 53:47.860
Okay.

53:47.860 --> 53:48.860
Please stop saying Seuss.

53:48.860 --> 53:53.660
They keep emailing and texting me and I just, I have to have a life.

53:53.660 --> 53:54.660
I'm sorry.

53:54.660 --> 53:55.660
That's right.

53:55.660 --> 53:58.700
Seuss, but Coder Radio smoking jackets.

53:58.700 --> 54:06.460
If the ropes ship and if a hundred people tweet us seriously and say, we want smoking

54:06.460 --> 54:07.460
jackets.

54:07.460 --> 54:09.380
And then if we can pull that off.

54:09.380 --> 54:11.940
After the robe thing, you're going to try to make smoking jackets a thing.

54:11.940 --> 54:12.940
Oh man.

54:12.940 --> 54:15.380
Yeah, but you're not going to love the way I make these smoking jackets, but we're going

54:15.380 --> 54:16.380
to do it.

54:16.380 --> 54:23.820
It sounds like you're going to use some sort of forced labor.

54:23.820 --> 54:24.820
You're not denying it.

54:24.820 --> 54:26.140
So it's probably true.

54:26.140 --> 54:27.140
All right.

54:27.140 --> 54:28.140
Well, very good.

54:28.140 --> 54:32.740
Also, thank you to our members, Coder QA team out there making the show possible.

54:32.740 --> 54:34.540

54:53.340 --> 54:54.860
His company is at the Mad Botter Inc.

54:54.860 --> 54:59.980
I am at Chris LAS and the whole dang network.

54:59.980 --> 55:03.620

55:22.860 --> 55:23.860
It's all done.

55:23.860 --> 55:24.860
Cleared the tubes.
