00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
This is Coder Radio, episode 460 for April 4th, 2022.

00:15.000 --> 00:19.000
Well, hello there! You look nice today and welcome into Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show,

00:19.000 --> 00:25.000
taking a pragmatic look at the art and the business of software development and the world of technology.

00:25.000 --> 00:31.000
My name is Chris, and Mike's taking the week off, I think, to hunt iguanas.

00:31.000 --> 00:36.000
I hear it's a big problem down there, in the house and outside of the house.

00:36.000 --> 00:39.000
But I'm not sure. I don't ask for details.

00:39.000 --> 00:45.000
So this episode, right on the 460, turned out to be a great one to reflect, to go back.

00:45.000 --> 00:47.000
And I was looking through the backlog and I was thinking,

00:47.000 --> 00:51.000
I know there's a couple of episodes I wanted to replay for you guys.

00:51.000 --> 00:57.000
And it turns out, one of them aired exactly this week, one year ago.

00:57.000 --> 01:03.000
And in this episode, we chat about the new Supreme Court ruling in the Google versus Oracle copyright fight

01:03.000 --> 01:09.000
that had finally landed, like there was some finality to that after talking about it for a decade.

01:09.000 --> 01:10.000
And we had a moment with that.

01:10.000 --> 01:14.000
But there's a couple of other things in there, like we speculate about future hardware advances

01:14.000 --> 01:19.000
and what might make us buy or switch to those hardware advances when they land.

01:19.000 --> 01:21.000
And it turns out, I think we nailed it.

01:21.000 --> 01:26.000
And then the other thing that's in here that's noteworthy is we have a discussion around Libidwaita,

01:26.000 --> 01:29.000
which we'll talk about in the show more.

01:29.000 --> 01:32.000
But it's actually just shipping this week and last week.

01:32.000 --> 01:36.000
And for most people, they're not actually going to get their hands on GNOME 42

01:36.000 --> 01:43.000
until they install a distribution with it, like Tumbleweed or Fedora or Ubuntu 2204.

01:43.000 --> 01:46.000
And so it's wild because we're talking about what Libidwaita does.

01:46.000 --> 01:53.000
And then the year in between that episode, 408, and this one, 460,

01:53.000 --> 01:57.000
was a year of fierce debate within the Linux community.

01:57.000 --> 02:00.000
So I think it's fascinating to reflect on that conversation.

02:00.000 --> 02:01.000
Plus, you know what?

02:01.000 --> 02:03.000
Part of me misses talking about HomePods and robes.

02:03.000 --> 02:05.000
So that was a lot of fun, too.

02:05.000 --> 02:06.000
So I hope you enjoy.

02:10.000 --> 02:12.000
I want to know if it's true or not.

02:12.000 --> 02:14.000
Did you buy another HomePod?

02:14.000 --> 02:16.000
No, because I couldn't goddamn find one.

02:16.000 --> 02:18.000
What made you decide to buy a third HomePod?

02:18.000 --> 02:19.000
Two, I get.

02:19.000 --> 02:23.000
Three, well, might as well get four at that point and have another stereo pair.

02:23.000 --> 02:24.000
You know what?

02:24.000 --> 02:27.000
The HomePod is just significantly better than the Sonos.

02:27.000 --> 02:28.000
It is, isn't it?

02:28.000 --> 02:30.000
If you have iOS devices.

02:30.000 --> 02:31.000
Yeah, that is true.

02:31.000 --> 02:32.000
All right.

02:32.000 --> 02:33.000
Well, I just thought I'd have to find out.

02:33.000 --> 02:34.000
I had to because I'm trying to.

02:34.000 --> 02:39.000
Now, the trouble is I'm at the point where why don't they make the HomePod anymore

02:39.000 --> 02:43.000
and maybe lower the price to a more sane level?

02:43.000 --> 02:45.000
Because I would totally buy.

02:45.000 --> 02:49.000
I mean, honestly, if I had a multi-level residence or like a place with a basement,

02:49.000 --> 02:52.000
I could be good for five or six HomePods.

02:53.000 --> 02:54.000
All right.

02:54.000 --> 02:55.000
Now, listen.

02:55.000 --> 02:57.000
Stay a while and listen.

02:57.000 --> 02:59.000
Oh, Decker, there you are.

02:59.000 --> 03:00.000
I know.

03:00.000 --> 03:01.000
It's nice, isn't it?

03:01.000 --> 03:02.000
You got to work him in every now and then.

03:02.000 --> 03:03.000
I have a robe update.

03:03.000 --> 03:06.000
I have a very exciting robe update.

03:06.000 --> 03:11.000
So I thought maybe I'd talk a little bit about this because this was an area that I think

03:11.000 --> 03:14.000
is interesting from a small business standpoint and managing your small business.

03:14.000 --> 03:16.000
So I'll come back to that.

03:16.000 --> 03:26.000
But quickly, the update is domestic and US orders should start arriving around May 19th, May 20th.

03:26.000 --> 03:31.000
We didn't quite make the window and the materials got used and had to be reordered

03:31.000 --> 03:36.000
because of some of the issues that held up the order, which are related to international troubles.

03:36.000 --> 03:38.000
Now, international orders stand by.

03:38.000 --> 03:40.000
I'll have more news for you next week.

03:40.000 --> 03:42.000
We're still trying our best to work that out.

03:42.000 --> 03:47.000
I may have bad news, but either way, we'll get in touch with you as we try to sort that.

03:47.000 --> 03:49.000
Boy, a lot of lessons learned.

03:49.000 --> 03:56.000
I have rethought a lot of things, and I'm also very excited that we actually have like a ship date

03:56.000 --> 03:59.000
or an arrival date, perhaps, for the robes.

03:59.000 --> 04:05.000
But I feel like as a business, I'm rethinking my entire strategy around swag.

04:05.000 --> 04:09.000
And I think what, when I look back at this as sort of like a post-mortem,

04:09.000 --> 04:17.000
I think one of the primary problems I had was I was attempting to do something that was really,

04:17.000 --> 04:21.000
really outside the norm for like my first thing.

04:21.000 --> 04:28.000
And additionally, I couldn't work with a shop that like shipping internationally was like the thing they did

04:28.000 --> 04:32.000
because of how unique this particular thing was.

04:32.000 --> 04:39.000
So they were a domestic operation who generally would like just send like 100 or 200 units to me,

04:39.000 --> 04:42.000
and then I would ship them out to everybody around the world.

04:42.000 --> 04:45.000
That's generally the type of customer they have.

04:45.000 --> 04:50.000
And instead, I was trying to get them to send it everywhere in the world, which they can do,

04:50.000 --> 04:52.000
but it's not their core competency.

04:52.000 --> 04:57.000
And as a result of that, I didn't appreciate how much that would matter.

04:57.000 --> 05:05.000
But I understand that it seems like for the kind of thing I want to do and to ship internationally at reasonable rates,

05:05.000 --> 05:09.000
because some of these rates to like anybody who lived in Germany,

05:09.000 --> 05:14.000
the original pricing we were working with was $150 of shipping per robe.

05:14.000 --> 05:15.000
Holy crap.

05:15.000 --> 05:16.000
Yeah.

05:16.000 --> 05:21.000
The cheapest international shipping we had was $95.

05:21.000 --> 05:33.000
So it was a range between $95 and almost $200 with the exception of Canada, which is like $85.

05:33.000 --> 05:36.000
So now we're trying to sort that out.

05:36.000 --> 05:43.000
And it was clear to me what would really work a lot better for an operation like JB who operates out of the States

05:43.000 --> 05:47.000
but has a worldwide audience that represents a significant portion of its audience.

05:47.000 --> 05:53.000
I have to build up some sort of operation where we're printing the shipping labels and slapping them on boxes

05:53.000 --> 05:58.000
and boxing them up here and then dropping them off at the post office and they're shipping them off.

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
And I'm just not there yet.

06:00.000 --> 06:03.000
So I try to get another company to do that part for me.

06:03.000 --> 06:12.000
And the way they operate is the way the type of drop shipping they do is they need all the shipping information

06:12.000 --> 06:18.000
and get every robe's destination and then come back with a quote.

06:18.000 --> 06:23.000
And then, of course, there's tons of back and forth and trying to find alternative fulfillment places

06:23.000 --> 06:27.000
and all that kind of stuff, which is where we're at right now for the international.

06:27.000 --> 06:34.000
But the domestic orders, what we decided to do was break those off into their own original order set

06:34.000 --> 06:39.000
from the original supplier and just get those out and going while we sort out the rest of it.

06:39.000 --> 06:43.000
I mean, I learned a lot and I think I've internalized a new strategy for the company

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
and how we're going to learn how to do this.

06:45.000 --> 06:48.000
I can't just start selling swag.

06:48.000 --> 06:54.000
I can't just turn on a switch and all of a sudden I'm like, you know, stocking swag and boxing swag and shipping swag.

06:54.000 --> 06:55.000
First of all, it sounds like hell.

06:55.000 --> 06:57.000
And second of all, I have no idea what I'm doing.

06:57.000 --> 06:59.000
And third of all, I have no inventory.

06:59.000 --> 07:05.000
I have to figure out how to get that skill set while not bankrupting the company

07:05.000 --> 07:10.000
because this could go really simple where I pre-order a hundred robes for a second batch,

07:10.000 --> 07:14.000
stock them here at the studio, and then never get them shipped out or never get it.

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
There's so many ways I could screw this up.

07:16.000 --> 07:22.000
So I have to build institutional knowledge while not screwing the pooch

07:22.000 --> 07:26.000
and keeping the train on the tracks while we try to build up this new aspect of the business.

07:26.000 --> 07:31.000
But I feel like my lessons learned here are if I want to be serious about how to do this,

07:31.000 --> 07:36.000
I'm going to have to be kind of responsible for at least like maybe what I would do.

07:36.000 --> 07:37.000
I guess I'll put it this way.

07:37.000 --> 07:44.000
If I were going to do this again, I would take pre-orders and I would just order 200 robes.

07:44.000 --> 07:48.000
And then once 200 robes were sold, that's as many as we had.

07:48.000 --> 07:50.000
We could do a second batch if we wanted.

07:50.000 --> 07:57.000
And then I would box them up and ship them out myself with like a label printer

07:57.000 --> 08:02.000
and like, you know, on a specific day, a couple of us are here at the studio,

08:02.000 --> 08:05.000
boxing things up, loading the car and sending it out a couple of times a week.

08:05.000 --> 08:07.000
And that's what I would do this time around.

08:07.000 --> 08:11.000
And then, you know, and then maybe open up another 200 orders or something.

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
But I'm just not there yet.

08:13.000 --> 08:14.000
Or don't do it at all.

08:14.000 --> 08:15.000
Right.

08:15.000 --> 08:16.000
Robes were a stupid idea.

08:16.000 --> 08:17.000
Yep. Yep.

08:17.000 --> 08:19.000
You shouldn't have done them.

08:19.000 --> 08:20.000
Nope. Nope.

08:20.000 --> 08:21.000
I warned you.

08:21.000 --> 08:29.000
I felt like a good challenge would force me to dive deep into this and like I'd have to solve it in route.

08:29.000 --> 08:30.000
And that might be true.

08:30.000 --> 08:33.000
Unless we got Reese and Dylan and Abigail, right?

08:33.000 --> 08:34.000
Your daughter.

08:34.000 --> 08:36.000
Are you talking about you're talking about a ham slice in the channel?

08:36.000 --> 08:37.000
No. Yeah.

08:37.000 --> 08:40.000
We just enslaved the kids and make them box all the ropes up.

08:40.000 --> 08:42.000
Oh, yeah. I'm totally going to enlist the kids.

08:42.000 --> 08:43.000
Oh, yeah, for sure.

08:43.000 --> 08:45.000
Like, I mean, I have a 14 year old brother.

08:45.000 --> 08:46.000
He just turned 14.

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
I'm totally cool with child labor.

08:48.000 --> 08:49.000
I just make it fun somehow.

08:49.000 --> 08:53.000
I'd figure out a way, you know, play some music, make a game out of it.

08:53.000 --> 08:54.000
We need to learn.

08:54.000 --> 08:55.000
No, no, no, no, no.

08:55.000 --> 08:59.000
Listen, my first job was a janitor when I was in high school.

08:59.000 --> 09:03.000
And for all my young men in the audience, you think girls are neat and clean.

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
Clean a ladies room.

09:05.000 --> 09:07.000
It will change your life.

09:07.000 --> 09:09.000
Should have done something much simpler.

09:09.000 --> 09:10.000
Like a T-shirt.

09:10.000 --> 09:11.000
That would have been easy.

09:11.000 --> 09:12.000
Could have done a lot of T-shirts.

09:12.000 --> 09:13.000
T-shirts suck.

09:13.000 --> 09:14.000
They do suck.

09:14.000 --> 09:15.000
That was what it was.

09:15.000 --> 09:17.000
I'm so bored of typical swag.

09:17.000 --> 09:19.000
Let me just fix your problem for you.

09:19.000 --> 09:23.000
Do the Coder radio beer glass like a Stein kind of thing.

09:23.000 --> 09:24.000
That's an internet.

09:24.000 --> 09:25.000
Yeah, OK.

09:25.000 --> 09:27.000
I was even being like lazier than that.

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
But if we can pull off a Stein, that's even better.

09:29.000 --> 09:33.000
That's kind of like 400 saying, you know, I mean, I'm just saying they're hippies anyway.

09:33.000 --> 09:34.000
What are they going to care?

09:34.000 --> 09:35.000
That's true.

09:35.000 --> 09:36.000
What do they even know over there?

09:36.000 --> 09:37.000
Nothing.

09:37.000 --> 09:42.000
I have been actually legitimately looking for like a supplier of of mugs or cups that have

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
like a ring around the bottom that prevent tipping.

09:44.000 --> 09:48.000
I mean, if you get an actual Stein with a hinge on it, that'd be pretty cool.

09:48.000 --> 09:49.000
And that would be cool.

09:49.000 --> 09:52.000
But I feel like that's going to have the same problem as the ropes.

09:52.000 --> 09:53.000
I don't know.

09:53.000 --> 09:54.000
Yeah.

09:54.000 --> 09:57.000
And plus plus shipping something breakable like that probably isn't a good first.

09:57.000 --> 09:58.000
Yeah.

09:58.000 --> 09:59.000
Yeah.

09:59.000 --> 10:00.000
OK.

10:00.000 --> 10:01.000
All right.

10:01.000 --> 10:02.000
All right.

10:02.000 --> 10:03.000
Fine.

10:03.000 --> 10:04.000
Fine.

10:04.000 --> 10:05.000
Fine.

10:05.000 --> 10:06.000
I don't want to dare.

10:06.000 --> 10:07.000
I dare.

10:07.000 --> 10:08.000
I touch the luck monks of feudal Linux observance.

10:08.000 --> 10:09.000
Right.

10:09.000 --> 10:12.000
How about this Coder radio martini glass?

10:12.000 --> 10:13.000
That's right on brand.

10:13.000 --> 10:14.000
That's actually very on brand.

10:14.000 --> 10:15.000
I'm just going to say.

10:15.000 --> 10:16.000
Yeah.

10:16.000 --> 10:17.000
Yeah.

10:17.000 --> 10:18.000
That sounds great.

10:18.000 --> 10:22.000
And I can tell you, I do mad butter martini glasses and that is not very hard.

10:22.000 --> 10:23.000
So.

10:23.000 --> 10:24.000
All right.

10:24.000 --> 10:25.000
All right.

10:25.000 --> 10:26.000
I'm filing that one away.

10:26.000 --> 10:27.000
Mm hmm.

10:27.000 --> 10:28.000
OK.

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
I can see I was trying to think of like some something to put inside the glass to like

10:30.000 --> 10:31.000
a stir or something.

10:31.000 --> 10:32.000
I don't know.

10:32.000 --> 10:33.000
But anyway, so thank you, everybody.

10:33.000 --> 10:37.440
I'm going to get these ropes figured out and then I'm going to make some like lessons learned

10:37.440 --> 10:39.440
plans that I'll share with everybody.

10:39.440 --> 10:42.000
I want from a business standpoint to do in the future.

10:42.000 --> 10:44.200
But that's the rope update for now.

10:44.200 --> 10:48.800
It's just it's been way more than I expected, although I did.

10:48.800 --> 10:52.000
I do totally acknowledge I brought it all on myself.

10:52.000 --> 10:53.400
I do this to myself.

10:53.400 --> 10:55.000
It is completely my fault.

10:55.000 --> 10:56.280
I acknowledge that.

10:56.280 --> 11:00.020
But I am excited to say Robe Bros in the US, you'll be receiving your be receiving your

11:00.020 --> 11:01.280
robe soon.

11:01.280 --> 11:07.160
Those of you internationally, you'll be hearing from us either with bad news or an alternative

11:07.160 --> 11:12.840
source or perhaps perhaps we will be just absolutely forced to do a round two.

11:12.840 --> 11:13.840
I don't know.

11:13.840 --> 11:14.840
I don't know.

11:14.840 --> 11:15.840
I mean, maybe maybe more robes will be demanded.

11:15.840 --> 11:16.840
You know, we get a lot of emails in.

11:16.840 --> 11:19.560
I feel like you're just making an excuse to do more robes.

11:19.560 --> 11:24.520
I think this whole like with you just saying you're going to do more robes.

11:24.520 --> 11:27.160
Personally, I kind of want to be done with the robe.

11:27.160 --> 11:28.880
It's been a lot.

11:28.880 --> 11:30.720
I don't believe you.

11:30.720 --> 11:33.160
And here's what's going to happen.

11:33.160 --> 11:37.280
In June, I'm going to start selling mad botter swag on here because you know what?

11:37.280 --> 11:38.280
I deliver.

11:38.280 --> 11:39.280
Do you know why I deliver?

11:39.280 --> 11:41.000
I only sell glass and t shirts.

11:41.000 --> 11:42.000
Yeah, I know.

11:42.000 --> 11:45.120
You know, a shot glass would be easier to would have been a lot easier shot glass would

11:45.120 --> 11:46.120
have been a lot easier.

11:46.120 --> 11:48.800
Look at Java Jax, the Coder Radio sippy cup.

11:48.800 --> 11:50.160
I have been looking.

11:50.160 --> 11:51.680
I've been looking something spill proof.

11:51.680 --> 11:52.680
But you know what?

11:52.680 --> 11:55.720
A lot of the things that they sell as like rebrandable swag.

11:55.720 --> 12:00.800
I seem like they're targeted adults for some reason and not children.

12:00.800 --> 12:03.760
I mean, I feel there was no need for hate speech, but maybe we should just move on to

12:03.760 --> 12:05.920
the actual show.

12:05.920 --> 12:09.480
I think what we need is an artist and sippy cup created by the audience that we could

12:09.480 --> 12:12.160
mass produce or maybe only make a couple limited.

12:12.160 --> 12:16.800
You know, the only person qualified to create a sippy cup in the world is me because I will

12:16.800 --> 12:18.160
find every flaw.

12:18.160 --> 12:19.520
There you go.

12:19.520 --> 12:20.680
You could be a good product tester.

12:20.680 --> 12:23.480
Oh, and then I think the other thing I'm going to do in the future, although I haven't worked

12:23.480 --> 12:27.960
out the details on this yet either, is I think I'm going to figure out a way that members

12:27.960 --> 12:32.600
of our shows can get discounts when they buy any of the merch that we do.

12:32.600 --> 12:34.240
Why the hell don't we have new stickers?

12:34.240 --> 12:35.240
Yeah.

12:35.240 --> 12:36.240
And stickers, too.

12:36.240 --> 12:39.280
I think stickers are I think if I'm going to be able to ship robes, I could ship stickers

12:39.280 --> 12:40.280
too.

12:40.280 --> 12:45.480
Dude, I can ship stickers and I'm usually like depressed or hungover or like wiping

12:45.480 --> 12:46.480
somebody's butt.

12:46.480 --> 12:47.480
I mean, come on.

12:47.480 --> 12:52.680
Well, stay tuned because stickers have been a topic of conversation recently.

12:52.680 --> 12:53.880
Now let's get into the email.

12:53.880 --> 12:54.880
We got a lot.

12:54.880 --> 12:57.200
We had a spicy inbox this week.

12:57.200 --> 13:02.040
Not all of them made it onto the air, but James S. writes in with an idea that I have

13:02.040 --> 13:04.240
a feeling you're going to think is terrific.

13:04.240 --> 13:06.640
He says, Hey, guys, I love the show.

13:06.640 --> 13:10.040
The talk about the new Apple Silicon performance in the context of development, though, has

13:10.040 --> 13:11.640
triggered me slightly.

13:11.640 --> 13:17.680
I've long felt that developers should be working deliberately on low to mid range hardware

13:17.680 --> 13:22.520
because otherwise it's just too easy to hide bad code behind a fast CPU.

13:22.520 --> 13:25.120
The majority of end users don't run the latest and greatest.

13:25.120 --> 13:26.820
They have older hardware.

13:26.820 --> 13:33.240
What do you think of this idea that if a developer has tons of RAM and a fast CPU, they almost

13:33.240 --> 13:38.040
always write code that feels fine on their system, but crawls on hardware that the typical

13:38.040 --> 13:39.640
end user actually has?

13:39.640 --> 13:42.700
James, I'm sure you're a lovely person and I think you're great.

13:42.700 --> 13:43.960
Thank you for listening to the show.

13:43.960 --> 13:45.920
Your idea is stupid.

13:45.920 --> 13:51.340
What a developer should do is have a good computer with a gimped VMs for testing.

13:51.340 --> 13:54.200
So the VMs should be intentionally weak to test.

13:54.200 --> 14:00.440
For instance, on my Mac, my Mac Pro, I have good Windows VM for dev and a very crappy

14:00.440 --> 14:02.000
Windows VM for testing.

14:02.000 --> 14:06.960
And it's like a third of the RAM and a third of the GPU, you know, like, you know, it's

14:06.960 --> 14:10.080
VMware, so the allocation, I'm sorry, it's parallels.

14:10.080 --> 14:11.640
I actually keep saying VMware.

14:11.640 --> 14:12.880
I don't use VMware.

14:12.880 --> 14:13.880
Okay.

14:13.880 --> 14:16.000
I think I like VMware better on the Mac.

14:16.000 --> 14:22.240
I agree with your point, James, that for testing, you should use a slightly weaker hardware

14:22.240 --> 14:24.280
or significantly weaker hardware.

14:24.280 --> 14:30.440
I honestly think a good workstation with different virtual machines for different use cases is

14:30.440 --> 14:31.740
the best way.

14:31.740 --> 14:36.240
So again, I, Chris, I agree with this point that like when I'm testing Windows software

14:36.240 --> 14:40.720
or any other kind of software, like Linux, whatever, my VMs for testing have like the

14:40.720 --> 14:42.320
minimal specs.

14:42.320 --> 14:46.760
I don't want to have like five machines because that would be great, great.

14:46.760 --> 14:48.720
I like your answer a little bit better than yours.

14:48.720 --> 14:55.080
My answer was I think most developers keep a lot of their older hardware around.

14:55.080 --> 14:56.080
Not me.

14:56.080 --> 14:57.080
I pour marketing into it.

14:57.080 --> 14:58.080
Well, yeah.

14:58.080 --> 14:59.080
Yeah, for sure.

14:59.080 --> 15:02.280
But I think some developers have like probably a couple of iterations of machines around

15:02.280 --> 15:06.400
so they can use that for this thing called Q&A where they could actually test it on the

15:06.400 --> 15:08.280
older hardware directly.

15:08.280 --> 15:12.440
I am not a fan of limiting any developer's productivity.

15:12.440 --> 15:17.280
Like if you get in the flow and you are having one of those beautiful moments, I feel like

15:17.280 --> 15:21.160
the machine should be as fricking fast as possible to let you rip.

15:21.160 --> 15:23.880
Like I buy my guys the best machines we can afford.

15:23.880 --> 15:24.880
Amen.

15:24.880 --> 15:27.640
It's the only area where I don't economize in the business.

15:27.640 --> 15:28.640
I don't.

15:28.640 --> 15:29.640
You know what?

15:29.640 --> 15:30.640
Like what?

15:30.640 --> 15:34.960
What's the stupidly dumb, expensive machine that the asshole who works for me tricked

15:34.960 --> 15:38.480
me into buying for him from System76, the Oryx?

15:38.480 --> 15:40.240
Oh, that big laptop.

15:40.240 --> 15:41.240
You got the big one.

15:41.240 --> 15:42.240
Yeah.

15:42.240 --> 15:43.240
Yeah.

15:43.240 --> 15:44.240
He's got three monitors.

15:44.240 --> 15:45.240
So I'm like, this is not what was intended.

15:45.240 --> 15:47.640
I know, but I have two, I have a giant GPU.

15:47.640 --> 15:48.640
Like you don't need a GPU.

15:48.640 --> 15:51.600
He's like, I know, but you bought it anyway, you stupid bastard.

15:51.600 --> 15:55.840
Hey, man, you want smooth window manager animations.

15:55.840 --> 15:56.840
Let's be honest.

15:56.840 --> 15:57.840
That stuff matters.

15:57.840 --> 16:01.320
It still crashes if he runs an extension.

16:01.320 --> 16:02.320
That's too soon.

16:02.320 --> 16:03.320
It's too soon.

16:03.320 --> 16:06.640
I actually have big news on that front later in the show.

16:06.640 --> 16:07.640
You're pregnant.

16:07.640 --> 16:11.440
No, in the genome shell related world that I want to get your take on.

16:11.440 --> 16:13.880
But I think VMs are a good answer too.

16:13.880 --> 16:14.880
But trolling aside, right?

16:14.880 --> 16:18.360
The question is, if you're a company, right?

16:18.360 --> 16:23.320
If you're like someone like me where you have, you employ devs, it makes sense to buy them

16:23.320 --> 16:28.320
a higher spec machine than have them test in virtual machines that are intentionally

16:28.320 --> 16:29.320
slow.

16:29.320 --> 16:34.720
If you're like one guy, though, obviously keep your old machines back and just test

16:34.720 --> 16:35.720
on those, right?

16:35.720 --> 16:40.120
You don't need to buy a crazy iMac Pro that will be obsolete by your MacBook Air within

16:40.120 --> 16:42.000
two years because Apple's evil.

16:42.000 --> 16:43.360
What was I talking about?

16:43.360 --> 16:47.960
Ron writes in, he says, hey, talking about Apple's gross dear code of radio, there are

16:47.960 --> 16:50.080
two kinds of people who use Apple.

16:50.080 --> 16:55.160
Number one, the technologically illiterate and number two, the insecure.

16:55.160 --> 17:00.080
Group one is terrified of computers and group two is terrified of coffee shop laptop shaming.

17:00.080 --> 17:02.880
Let's debunk some Apple fanboy myths.

17:02.880 --> 17:07.480
Now, I don't know if Ron's trolling us because he spelled fanboy with an I, which I think,

17:07.480 --> 17:09.280
I don't know if he's trying to be.

17:09.280 --> 17:15.920
Yeah, he writes, the last time I spent 20 hours away from a power source was never.

17:15.920 --> 17:18.320
So implying you don't need long battery life.

17:18.320 --> 17:20.680
Well, I have definitely done that, but keep going.

17:20.680 --> 17:21.680
Yeah, I know.

17:21.680 --> 17:26.120
And it's like if you've ever gone to an event, do you speak at conferences ever?

17:26.120 --> 17:27.120
Yeah.

17:27.120 --> 17:31.480
A conference like the battery life, especially when you get to that stupid moment where you

17:31.480 --> 17:35.520
realize you didn't charge, you left your laptop in your bag overnight.

17:35.520 --> 17:36.960
You get there to do the talk.

17:36.960 --> 17:38.040
You didn't plug it in.

17:38.040 --> 17:44.420
And because Apple only lets you have a couple of USB-C ports, you're really in a tight spot.

17:44.420 --> 17:47.900
But battery life matters a lot for me, too, because I spend a lot of weekends completely

17:47.900 --> 17:51.840
off grid where I am only generating power that comes from the sun.

17:51.840 --> 17:54.520
And sometimes in the Pacific Northwest, there's not a lot of sun.

17:54.520 --> 17:55.520
Right.

17:55.520 --> 17:56.520
And I'm usually on a Coke bender.

17:56.520 --> 17:57.520
So, yeah.

17:57.520 --> 17:58.520
Right.

17:58.520 --> 17:59.520
Of course.

17:59.520 --> 18:00.520
And who's going to bother plugging in when you're on a bender?

18:00.520 --> 18:03.880
He says, syncing digital content across devices has never been easier.

18:03.880 --> 18:05.520
iCloud isn't needed.

18:05.520 --> 18:09.780
He set up next cloud in 10 minutes.

18:09.780 --> 18:11.080
No, no, no.

18:11.080 --> 18:12.080
Ten minutes.

18:12.080 --> 18:13.500
He had next cloud going in 10 minutes.

18:13.500 --> 18:15.880
You were wrong when you said next cloud, but keep going.

18:15.880 --> 18:20.520
I mean, this is this is a common thing that I think it's hard for our community to understand.

18:20.520 --> 18:24.300
A lot of people have no interest in doing that, even if they have the technical capability

18:24.300 --> 18:25.300
of doing it.

18:25.300 --> 18:26.300
They don't care.

18:26.300 --> 18:27.300
Yeah.

18:27.300 --> 18:31.900
He says staying productive during renders is not about hoping things get faster on the

18:31.900 --> 18:32.900
M1.

18:32.900 --> 18:33.900
It's about organizing your workflow.

18:33.900 --> 18:39.060
a custom PC used for content creation will scorch any Mac in existence.

18:39.260 --> 18:42.300
Wrong stop custom PC. Yeah, wrong.

18:42.500 --> 18:46.580
Right. Because most people are not buying custom and not customizing their PCs.

18:46.780 --> 18:50.700
Yeah. So what's funny is so what I think guys like Ron kind of they don't look

18:50.900 --> 18:55.580
at the actual market and go, oh, like there must be a reason

18:55.780 --> 19:00.660
why a guy like Marques Brownlee buys the Mac Pro.

19:00.860 --> 19:03.340
Right. Because, I mean, I'm sure he doesn't like burning money.

19:03.340 --> 19:04.420
He'd rather probably buy that.

19:04.420 --> 19:06.540
He'd rather spend that money on the next Tesla.

19:06.740 --> 19:07.860
He's you know, why?

19:08.060 --> 19:10.180
So why are they buying that Mac Pro?

19:10.380 --> 19:13.060
And the reality is Final Cut.

19:13.260 --> 19:14.380
It's Final Cut.

19:14.580 --> 19:18.540
It's if you ask them, they will tell you it's because of Final Cut Pro 10.

19:18.580 --> 19:19.900
Well, this is a developer show.

19:20.100 --> 19:25.380
The reason I buy only System 76 and Macs for my guys is because I know out

19:25.380 --> 19:28.580
of the box with either of those machines, they can get up and running.

19:28.700 --> 19:30.940
Right. My biggest expense is payable.

19:30.940 --> 19:33.820
And then additionally, like if one of those guys leaves and you want to move

19:33.820 --> 19:37.100
that machine to somebody else, do you want to move them some weird custom built PC?

19:37.300 --> 19:41.980
Or do you know I want to wipe it and put Pop OS, whatever, or Mac OS, whatever.

19:41.980 --> 19:43.460
And then you scale that up for, like,

19:43.460 --> 19:46.380
any company that has, like, an IT department with a bunch of employees.

19:46.580 --> 19:48.900
It's just not scalable to do custom PCs.

19:49.100 --> 19:52.460
The custom PCs are, I mean, bully for you.

19:52.660 --> 19:54.380
No, that's great, seriously, for you.

19:54.580 --> 19:59.140
But when you have, like, if I was just a solo shop, honestly,

19:59.140 --> 20:00.860
I probably would have a custom PC.

20:01.060 --> 20:07.460
There's still a group of individuals out there who think that what's selling Apple

20:07.660 --> 20:11.260
and why Apple is one of the most valuable companies in the world is because

20:11.460 --> 20:15.060
of marketing and fanboys, and I don't really need to dwell on it.

20:15.060 --> 20:16.060
I don't think it's I mean,

20:16.260 --> 20:19.260
I think it's worth realizing that sometimes we can have real blinders

20:19.260 --> 20:21.020
on to what seems to drive the market.

20:21.220 --> 20:24.500
What seems to really drive the market seems to be battery life and performance.

20:24.700 --> 20:27.540
And I would say visual appeal.

20:27.540 --> 20:29.740
And then it's something that we don't

20:29.940 --> 20:33.220
quite grok as a community is the entire package, right?

20:33.420 --> 20:34.060
It's a product.

20:34.260 --> 20:40.900
The cloud services and the fancy Apple sales, everything is part of an entire

20:41.100 --> 20:43.500
product when you roll your own next cloud.

20:43.700 --> 20:44.500
That's awesome.

20:44.700 --> 20:45.380
And I have two.

20:45.580 --> 20:47.620
I have two next cloud servers.

20:47.820 --> 20:48.340
It's great.

20:48.540 --> 20:51.420
The reality is, though, that's not a whole product.

20:51.620 --> 20:53.020
You built a custom PC.

20:53.220 --> 20:57.220
You loaded your own Linux on there and built it up just the way you like it.

20:57.220 --> 21:02.780
And then you set up next cloud to do your sinking and you did it all on your own.

21:02.980 --> 21:04.420
And that's fantastic.

21:04.620 --> 21:08.780
I host a show with Alex called Self Hosted because I love that stuff.

21:08.980 --> 21:11.940
But I have to be aware that the vast,

21:12.140 --> 21:17.460
vast majority of the market, like the significant total vast majority

21:17.460 --> 21:19.180
of the market, doesn't do that kind of stuff.

21:19.380 --> 21:21.940
And so they need a solution that works well for them.

21:22.140 --> 21:26.980
And the better and faster that solution is, the overall more people are there.

21:26.980 --> 21:28.580
Technology experience is improved.

21:28.780 --> 21:33.500
It's easy to dismiss this stuff, but I think it actually it deserves important

21:33.700 --> 21:37.100
consideration and then then the next questions start to become like,

21:37.300 --> 21:39.660
well, how do I make money on this reality?

21:39.660 --> 21:41.820
Like, if I want to have a business and software development,

21:42.020 --> 21:45.180
and this is the reality of the market, how do I make money on it?

21:45.380 --> 21:47.900
I think that's a fair question to ask, too.

21:48.100 --> 21:49.220
But maybe it's not.

21:49.220 --> 21:51.980
Maybe your question is, and I'm not saying it is for everybody,

21:51.980 --> 21:54.700
but I'm saying often in the context of the show, that's how we talk about it.

21:54.700 --> 21:56.540
Maybe it's just how can I have fun with it?

21:56.540 --> 21:59.020
And Ron, that might be the area you're in.

21:59.220 --> 22:02.780
And you can be wired to a wall and you never have to go anywhere mobile,

22:02.980 --> 22:06.980
and you can spend the time to set up next cloud and configure your Android

22:06.980 --> 22:10.300
client to sync with your KDE desktop and, man, more power to you.

22:10.300 --> 22:13.020
I wish I had more time to do that stuff because I love doing that stuff, too.

22:13.220 --> 22:16.820
But you and I, my friend, we are a rare breed,

22:17.020 --> 22:21.740
and we may be even fewer and fewer in some ways, at least compared to the overall

22:21.940 --> 22:25.420
growth of the mobile and technology market.

22:25.420 --> 22:27.220
Next one comes in from Alex.

22:27.420 --> 22:30.900
Now, for him, the Linux desktop just isn't worth the hassle.

22:31.100 --> 22:32.740
He says, first of all, love the show.

22:32.740 --> 22:33.740
You guys are great.

22:33.740 --> 22:37.300
He goes on to compliment us for a bit, but I'm going to skip over that.

22:37.300 --> 22:38.900
But I really appreciate it. Thank you, Alex.

22:39.100 --> 22:40.700
It's not you. It's me.

22:40.700 --> 22:41.700
Yes, I got it.

22:41.700 --> 22:43.740
He says you're great, and I just don't want to talk about it.

22:43.740 --> 22:45.340
You know, like we focus on it too much.

22:45.540 --> 22:49.940
Now, he says, some time ago you asked people to tell you about their work set up.

22:49.940 --> 22:51.740
Remember when we came back, we did that for a little bit.

22:51.740 --> 22:55.340
He says he proudly wrote in about his high-end Dell 7 series,

22:55.540 --> 22:58.540
7000 series laptop running Ubuntu 1804 and i3.

22:58.740 --> 23:01.340
The thing is, I really wanted this set up to work.

23:01.540 --> 23:06.060
My employer insists on using some commercial VPN software as well as some

23:06.060 --> 23:09.860
other office software that only runs on Windows, but I had it working for a bit.

23:10.060 --> 23:13.500
I felt kind of like the hacker movie version of a developer spinning up new

23:13.500 --> 23:17.140
borderless terminals and i3 and switching workspaces all while never really

23:17.340 --> 23:19.540
leaving the keyboard. I felt productive.

23:19.540 --> 23:22.740
But then one day when going to our support desk, trying to get some Linux

23:22.940 --> 23:26.140
corner case fixed, the staff member most knowledgeable on Linux was out.

23:26.340 --> 23:29.140
And I had a full day of work ahead of me.

23:29.340 --> 23:33.740
So the solution they provided me was a used Mac.

23:33.940 --> 23:39.540
What I got was a late 2020 Mac Pro fully decked out i7, 32 gigs of RAM,

23:39.740 --> 23:40.940
1TB SSD.

23:41.140 --> 23:43.940
And the amazing thing is, it doesn't really seem to get all that hot.

23:43.940 --> 23:46.340
I don't really hear the fans to the point where they're audible,

23:46.540 --> 23:48.540
even when running Docker or VMs.

23:48.540 --> 23:51.540
I did disable Turbo Boost, but here's the kicker.

23:51.740 --> 23:56.140
Docker for Mac works amazing on this Intel Mac.

23:56.340 --> 24:00.740
And I just brew install all the GNU core utilities and just eat the annoyance

24:00.940 --> 24:05.540
of some of the brew limitations and not really looking back.

24:05.740 --> 24:07.740
The setup is working really well for me.

24:07.940 --> 24:12.340
And he goes on to mention how he had some problems with gaming,

24:12.540 --> 24:14.940
but he decided, you know, really for that, maybe I should just set up

24:15.140 --> 24:15.740
a Windows 10 box.

24:15.740 --> 24:19.540
In conclusion, I'm kind of embarrassed to say that I've ended up

24:19.740 --> 24:21.340
leaving desktop Linux behind.

24:21.540 --> 24:23.940
It, of course, is the only answer for server side work.

24:24.140 --> 24:29.340
But my dumb terminal interface to it is, well, a shiny, expensive,

24:29.540 --> 24:33.340
but effective gray slab from the guys in Cupertino.

24:33.540 --> 24:35.540
Alex, that's hard for me to hear,

24:35.740 --> 24:39.740
I have to say, as somebody who's been using desktop Linux for a very long time.

24:39.940 --> 24:43.740
I know you have a religious objection to computers that actually work.

24:43.740 --> 24:45.940
But yeah, this is this is why max.

24:46.140 --> 24:48.940
This is why there will be no year of the links desktop, right?

24:49.140 --> 24:51.940
You don't see a lot of people doing blog posts and YouTube videos about

24:52.140 --> 24:53.340
switching away from Linux, right?

24:53.540 --> 24:58.540
You see a lot of blog posts and hacker news stories about switching to Linux.

24:58.740 --> 25:01.340
Let me tell you how many of them to the blog post about switching back.

25:01.540 --> 25:03.340
I mean, I'm on an iMac Pro right now.

25:03.540 --> 25:05.940
Sometimes you see it, but you don't see a lot.

25:06.140 --> 25:08.140
But I've done several blog posts.

25:08.340 --> 25:09.740
I'm on an iMac Pro, right?

25:09.740 --> 25:14.540
Just I just hate I hate hearing this.

25:14.740 --> 25:16.740
I really do. I hate I hate hearing this.

25:16.940 --> 25:20.740
So I mean, I can tell you, I also have hated hearing a lot of things

25:20.940 --> 25:24.140
over the last, let's say, six months and it doesn't get better.

25:24.340 --> 25:27.340
So the M1 Pro is coming out in June.

25:27.540 --> 25:29.340
Oh, too soon.

25:29.540 --> 25:34.540
Yeah, if they had a if they had a 16 core, if they had a 16 core M1 with 32

25:34.540 --> 25:41.740
gigs of RAM and two terabyte SSD and 27 inch plus screen, that'd be

25:41.940 --> 25:42.740
pretty tempting.

25:42.940 --> 25:46.140
The only other like shoe or whatever the term is I need to kind of drop

25:46.340 --> 25:52.340
would be if I even got like a whiff that like the Linux M1 support was

25:52.540 --> 25:54.940
getting dialed in and it was like, you know, within the next year,

25:55.140 --> 25:56.340
it's going to be working for sure.

25:56.540 --> 26:00.540
I think I'd probably pull the trigger, but it doesn't mean I just have

26:00.740 --> 26:02.340
that be one of many machines that I have.

26:02.340 --> 26:04.340
No, let's backpedal. Yes, of course.

26:04.540 --> 26:08.740
No, no, it's just the reality is the reality is I need something mobile

26:08.940 --> 26:11.940
and I still need lots of Linux and it's not going to do those things for

26:12.140 --> 26:13.740
me because I'm not going to get a MacBook from them.

26:13.940 --> 26:15.940
All right. All right. All right.

26:16.140 --> 26:17.340
So it's just be one of many.

26:17.540 --> 26:18.740
But I'm not. We'll see.

26:18.940 --> 26:19.740
We'll see.

26:19.940 --> 26:22.340
I think Apple is going to stick with the M1 for the remainder of the

26:22.540 --> 26:24.340
year, and I'm not really interested in the M1 now.

26:24.540 --> 26:27.140
Now I feel like I got to hold out for something better, too.

26:27.340 --> 26:29.140
So that's what I'm hunkering down for.

26:29.140 --> 26:32.740
The Fisher doth protest too much. Maybe it.

26:32.940 --> 26:33.940
I am in a weird place with it.

26:34.140 --> 26:35.340
I'll tell you that I can feel it.

26:35.540 --> 26:37.740
It feels weird that I don't like it.

26:37.940 --> 26:39.340
I'm uncomfortable with it.

26:39.540 --> 26:43.140
And then the other thing that's hard is the lines between Gnome Shell

26:43.340 --> 26:46.940
and Mac OS are even blurrier than ever because now Gnome Shell has

26:47.140 --> 26:51.340
gone to horizontal workspace layouts and they have the same gesture

26:51.540 --> 26:52.740
as Mac OS to get to it.

26:52.940 --> 26:54.340
It's just one less finger.

26:54.540 --> 26:57.740
It's a three finger gesture instead of a four finger and they move

26:57.740 --> 27:01.940
the dock down to the bottom now and the whole thing's feeling a lot

27:02.140 --> 27:04.340
like the two the two interfaces are colliding.

27:04.540 --> 27:06.340
It's we've been here before, Sam.

27:06.540 --> 27:07.740
Yeah, it's a weird overlap.

27:07.940 --> 27:08.940
Scott writes in though.

27:09.140 --> 27:11.740
He says, hey, I changed my mind for JavaScript on the server.

27:11.940 --> 27:16.740
I once like Mike was just not having JavaScript on the server.

27:16.940 --> 27:20.540
I thought I should always stay in the browser on the client side.

27:20.740 --> 27:22.540
Just use it minimally.

27:22.740 --> 27:26.740
But my mind changed once I learned about server side rendering and

27:26.740 --> 27:27.740
it all clicked.

27:27.940 --> 27:31.340
This allows the server to build the fundamentals of a web page and

27:31.540 --> 27:32.740
then just send the browser.

27:32.940 --> 27:36.540
Oh, this is not new at all.

27:36.740 --> 27:39.540
Well, he says it's nice because in the browser gets this nice little

27:39.740 --> 27:41.540
thing that can just display really super quick.

27:41.740 --> 27:44.740
Any additional logic can be any minimal logic can be done on the

27:44.940 --> 27:47.340
client, but the server does the bulk of the work.

27:47.540 --> 27:50.140
He says it doesn't necessarily negate the idea of flask having an

27:50.340 --> 27:52.540
API for jazz code and then load additional resources.

27:52.740 --> 27:55.740
But he thinks it might be worth considering when you consider

27:55.740 --> 27:57.340
server side rendering.

27:57.540 --> 27:58.540
You're not having it, though.

27:58.740 --> 28:01.540
It's not that I'm not having it is that this has existed for a very

28:01.740 --> 28:02.540
long time.

28:02.740 --> 28:04.140
It's not a new idea.

28:04.340 --> 28:08.140
And this is how everything like ERB and flask and ginger.

28:08.340 --> 28:11.940
I guess ginger would be the last version of ERB.

28:12.140 --> 28:13.340
It's how it all works.

28:13.540 --> 28:17.940
The server side builds the page and puts it down to the shithole

28:18.140 --> 28:19.140
that is the web.

28:19.340 --> 28:24.540
I mean, JavaScript is a language that should not exist.

28:24.540 --> 28:26.740
I have written large things in JavaScript.

28:26.940 --> 28:30.540
I have had to just delete them and I've lost tens of thousands of

28:30.740 --> 28:31.140
dollars.

28:31.340 --> 28:32.540
You need a better language.

28:32.740 --> 28:35.140
Well, I can't argue with you.

28:35.340 --> 28:37.740
I'm not going to be I'm not I'm not going to die on this hill for

28:37.940 --> 28:38.740
this one.

28:38.940 --> 28:40.740
It's I get what you're saying, man.

28:40.940 --> 28:46.740
Like it's convenient for what you're doing, but it's it's not good.

28:46.940 --> 28:48.740
Like it's just cheese.

28:48.940 --> 28:51.340
You know, I'm not going to go into the history of server side rendering,

28:51.540 --> 28:53.340
but not a new idea.

28:53.340 --> 28:55.540
And it doesn't need to be JavaScript.

28:55.740 --> 29:00.340
JavaScript is deeply compromised language.

29:00.540 --> 29:07.940
We could say it's not a pure language that has a fundamental philosophy,

29:08.140 --> 29:10.340
elegance, purity.

29:10.540 --> 29:17.540
We could say, you know, say qua machismo, even I'm just off the top

29:17.740 --> 29:18.140
of my head.

29:18.340 --> 29:19.340
I'm thinking of a language.

29:19.540 --> 29:22.140
You're my criteria and that might be objective.

29:22.140 --> 29:25.140
See, obviously be a good language.

29:25.340 --> 29:27.140
JavaScript is a bad language.

29:27.340 --> 29:31.540
I think the fat cat proposes we ban JavaScript from the chat.

29:31.740 --> 29:35.540
Promise you can't ban JavaScript just like you can't cure herpes.

29:35.740 --> 29:38.540
It just won't go away.

29:38.740 --> 29:41.540
He said and then Java Jack says JavaScript is what happens when there's

29:41.740 --> 29:43.940
no competition in browser languages.

29:44.140 --> 29:46.540
Spicy chat room tonight.

29:46.740 --> 29:47.940
Koda Radio happy hour.

29:48.140 --> 29:48.540
I am sorry.

29:48.740 --> 29:51.740
I did start it tonight with my moaning before the show.

29:51.740 --> 29:53.940
Yes, you know, that's why you got to show up live.

29:54.140 --> 29:59.540
So that way you can catch the moaning at jblive.tv on a Monday.

29:59.740 --> 30:01.940
Talescale.com slash coder.

30:02.140 --> 30:04.940
I am so excited to welcome Talescale to the show.

30:05.140 --> 30:09.540
You can go to talescale.com slash coder and get a free account for up to 20

30:09.740 --> 30:11.940
devices and you support the show.

30:12.140 --> 30:15.340
If you don't know, Talescale is a zero config VPN.

30:15.540 --> 30:17.540
It installs on any device in minutes.

30:17.740 --> 30:20.740
You can manage your firewall rules simply your DNS, your networking, all of

30:20.740 --> 30:22.140
it very straightforward.

30:22.340 --> 30:23.340
I have it on the iPad.

30:23.540 --> 30:24.140
I have it on my phone.

30:24.340 --> 30:25.340
I have it on the Android device.

30:25.540 --> 30:27.540
I've got it on a Raspberry Pi running Linux.

30:27.740 --> 30:29.740
I've got it on lots of VMS.

30:29.940 --> 30:29.940
Now.

30:30.140 --> 30:33.140
I've also been using this to connect my VMS together when I have some on

30:33.340 --> 30:35.540
my laptop and on my desktop.

30:35.740 --> 30:38.940
You can really just connect anything together into a mesh network using

30:39.140 --> 30:41.340
WireGuard's noise protocol encryption.

30:41.540 --> 30:46.140
So you're building a mesh network with the best VPN security out there

30:46.340 --> 30:50.140
in the business and I leave it on all the time as an always on interface.

30:50.140 --> 30:54.740
So now I essentially have a flat network between a series of my machines

30:54.940 --> 30:57.340
and I've been able to set up bookmarks that point to their IP.

30:57.540 --> 31:01.340
And if you throw a DNS server into that network, Talescale will work with

31:01.540 --> 31:04.340
that and then you're starting to get name resolution over this private

31:04.540 --> 31:06.940
flat WireGuard based mesh network.

31:07.140 --> 31:10.540
I mean, it doesn't even matter if you're behind a firewall or carrier

31:10.740 --> 31:12.940
grade NAT because I have to do that all the time.

31:13.140 --> 31:16.340
This has changed how I access my information and it's also changing

31:16.540 --> 31:17.540
how I do documentation.

31:17.540 --> 31:20.540
Now that I know I can always get access to these Markdown files that I

31:20.740 --> 31:22.940
have in my Raspberry Pi Linux box at home.

31:23.140 --> 31:27.340
I know that that's a good source to get and store information from.

31:27.540 --> 31:28.740
It's really great.

31:28.940 --> 31:32.340
And because it runs on all these devices and it's so quick to set up,

31:32.540 --> 31:34.540
you don't have to think about it much.

31:34.740 --> 31:36.540
You can get going in a couple of minutes.

31:36.740 --> 31:39.340
They support whatever single sign on vendor you'd like to use if you

31:39.540 --> 31:40.340
want to go that route.

31:40.540 --> 31:43.540
So maybe you have like a corporate Google account or a personal account

31:43.740 --> 31:45.340
or whatever you however you do that.

31:45.340 --> 31:49.340
What's great about that system is if you want to use two factor authentication

31:49.540 --> 31:51.140
tailscales going to support that as well.

31:51.340 --> 31:54.140
So when you install the client, which happens in seconds, you get a URL,

31:54.340 --> 31:56.940
you associate it with your account and you're done.

31:57.140 --> 31:58.940
The network's established.

31:59.140 --> 32:00.340
It is so fast.

32:00.540 --> 32:05.740
It is so simple to get a WireGuard grade mesh network set up in seconds.

32:05.940 --> 32:07.340
So go try it for yourself.

32:07.540 --> 32:12.540
See what I'm talking about and get 20 machines free on that network.

32:12.540 --> 32:15.340
When you go to tailscale.com slash coder.

32:15.540 --> 32:18.140
It's a great way to support the show and it's a great way to start with

32:18.340 --> 32:21.540
something that I think will change how you work.

32:21.740 --> 32:23.540
You're never going back after you get tailscale.

32:23.740 --> 32:26.740
Tailscale.com slash coder.

32:28.940 --> 32:29.340
All right.

32:29.540 --> 32:30.940
Now it's time to talk about it.

32:31.140 --> 32:34.940
The Supreme Court has ruled in Google's favor in the copyright dispute

32:35.140 --> 32:40.540
with Oracle over the use of the I think it was like eleven thousand

32:40.540 --> 32:42.540
lines of code or something.

32:44.740 --> 32:48.940
Yeah, it takes back to 2010 when Oracle bought the Java.

32:49.140 --> 32:52.340
What about sun but sun and then Java came along with it.

32:52.540 --> 32:54.540
I looked back at our archives.

32:54.740 --> 32:58.540
This is the story that's been covering for.

32:58.740 --> 32:59.740
Oh, yeah.

32:59.940 --> 33:03.140
Remember Oracle claimed that they that Google owed them eight point

33:03.340 --> 33:07.540
eight billion dollars and four hundred seventy five million and lost

33:07.540 --> 33:12.940
potential licensing revenue and then in 2016 a jury found that Google's

33:13.140 --> 33:17.340
use of that structure and sequence and organization of Java APIs was

33:17.540 --> 33:17.940
fair use.

33:18.140 --> 33:20.540
But then the Court of Appeals and the Federal Circuit overturned that

33:20.740 --> 33:23.740
decision into Oracle's favor and it just went back and forth.

33:23.940 --> 33:24.740
What felt like forever.

33:24.940 --> 33:27.940
And to be fair, I was initially on Oracle side because Google literally

33:28.140 --> 33:31.340
copy pasted some of the headers and everything.

33:31.540 --> 33:34.740
But not that they couldn't use the API, but they should pay some damages

33:34.740 --> 33:37.540
for literally copy pasta, right?

33:37.740 --> 33:37.940
Come on.

33:38.140 --> 33:38.540
Yeah, it was.

33:38.740 --> 33:41.740
And the thing I think that we thought was pretty damning was the emails

33:41.940 --> 33:44.740
from the executives that kind of just said we're going to do this and

33:44.940 --> 33:47.540
we're either going to have to license it or fight them in court one day.

33:47.740 --> 33:51.740
Well, if you remember and I did my research today, I actually did my job

33:51.940 --> 33:54.740
today, Chris, you should pat me on the back.

33:54.940 --> 33:55.540
Thank you just for you.

33:55.740 --> 33:56.540
I rang the bell.

33:56.740 --> 33:59.340
They could have used C sharp for free, but because they hated Microsoft,

33:59.540 --> 34:00.140
they wouldn't do it.

34:00.340 --> 34:00.740
Right?

34:00.940 --> 34:01.140
Yeah.

34:01.340 --> 34:02.140
There was the sense back then.

34:02.340 --> 34:02.940
I mean, you're right.

34:02.940 --> 34:06.140
Yeah, there was the sense back then, I mean, you remember back then when

34:06.340 --> 34:08.540
they were first starting Android, like the sense was that the whole

34:08.740 --> 34:10.740
world of these devices were going to run on Java.

34:10.940 --> 34:12.140
Well, hang on.

34:12.340 --> 34:18.340
If we're going back, there's only one gentleman that can help us.

34:18.540 --> 34:18.940
Perfect.

34:19.140 --> 34:21.340
I was thinking Deckard Cain, but you went a different direction.

34:21.540 --> 34:23.740
Oh, oh, you mean you like you want to go?

34:23.940 --> 34:24.940
You want to share that?

34:25.140 --> 34:26.140
That's that's story time.

34:26.340 --> 34:28.540
Stay a while and listen.

34:28.540 --> 34:32.740
Back in the day, Microsoft was actually a scary company.

34:32.940 --> 34:36.740
But now they're a little hippie company that runs Azure.

34:36.940 --> 34:39.940
But they used to put companies out of business.

34:40.140 --> 34:42.740
Yeah, kids, Microsoft was actually scary at one point.

34:42.940 --> 34:43.140
Yeah.

34:43.340 --> 34:46.340
And I guess there was also this feeling at Google that like Microsoft

34:46.540 --> 34:47.740
was the big bad guy.

34:47.940 --> 34:50.540
The world was going to run all these like I remember Blu-ray players

34:50.740 --> 34:51.740
back then were running Java.

34:51.940 --> 34:53.740
Like everything was going to be Java based.

34:53.940 --> 34:55.940
Everything that Microsoft did was bad.

34:55.940 --> 35:01.740
And I think that they figured we'll swoop up a huge amount of developers

35:01.940 --> 35:03.340
who can already target our platform.

35:03.540 --> 35:06.540
That'll get us in the race against Apple as fast as possible.

35:06.740 --> 35:08.140
From India that are cheap, yes.

35:08.340 --> 35:10.740
But yeah, you and I both thought, boy, Oracle could win this,

35:10.940 --> 35:12.540
but it would be bad if they did.

35:12.740 --> 35:16.340
And I actually thought there was a good shot that Oracle was going to win

35:16.540 --> 35:19.340
and I couldn't really comprehend what the knock on effects of that would be.

35:19.540 --> 35:21.140
But so it's on tape, right?

35:21.340 --> 35:25.340
Like I was pretty pissed about this because I felt like just stealing Java.

35:25.340 --> 35:29.140
But they didn't really see the problem was Google was kind of right,

35:29.340 --> 35:33.140
but I didn't like what they were doing because this is going to sound

35:33.340 --> 35:38.140
super old-manish, but Objective-C at the time requiring memory management

35:38.340 --> 35:41.940
allowed me just to charge a lot of money that made me very happy.

35:42.140 --> 35:45.740
It seemed like they knew there was some questionable activity to it.

35:45.940 --> 35:48.740
Like they kind of had a sense that maybe they were in a gray area.

35:48.940 --> 35:51.140
Well, in their emails, they knew.

35:51.340 --> 35:54.140
What we have here is kind of like a half decision, though,

35:54.140 --> 35:57.940
because the question is, are APIs copyrightable?

35:58.140 --> 35:59.940
That's been skirted by the court here.

36:00.140 --> 36:06.540
They focused on fair use and they didn't really establish the copyright precedent.

36:06.740 --> 36:10.740
It's like the case establishes a precedent that if you're copying an API

36:10.940 --> 36:13.940
and its primary purpose is matching interface so the developers can

36:14.140 --> 36:18.140
reimplement it, you're in fair use territory, which it doesn't really

36:18.340 --> 36:20.540
answer the primary question of the copyright violation.

36:20.540 --> 36:26.740
So I have a service that copies the API for AWS S3.

36:26.940 --> 36:29.940
Yeah, I have not talked about this on the show because...

36:30.140 --> 36:31.140
Oh, you mean you really do?

36:31.340 --> 36:31.940
I really do.

36:32.140 --> 36:33.140
Oh, OK. That's theoretical.

36:33.340 --> 36:36.140
I've seen Bezos' pecker, let's say.

36:36.340 --> 36:37.740
Thank you, Reddit.

36:37.940 --> 36:41.940
And I'm pretty sure he would slam that right up my bum.

36:42.140 --> 36:42.740
No, you can.

36:42.940 --> 36:43.740
I mean, you can.

36:43.940 --> 36:45.340
You can. I run an object storage.

36:45.540 --> 36:46.340
Right now. Right.

36:46.540 --> 36:49.740
Like, I could have the exact same programmable interface

36:49.740 --> 36:52.540
and my whole thing I do with this is go to people that are spending

36:52.740 --> 36:56.140
a lot of money on S3 so we can set you up in our data center.

36:56.340 --> 37:01.540
Literally, you change the API keys, you change the endpoint, the secret key,

37:01.740 --> 37:07.740
all that nonsense, and bam, you're saving thousands of dollars a year.

37:07.940 --> 37:10.940
Yeah, and it can also, like in some cases, yeah, you work with a smaller

37:11.140 --> 37:13.540
business that can be more hands-on, that can be more attentive.

37:13.740 --> 37:14.140
Right.

37:14.340 --> 37:18.940
And we can offer you added custom benefits, like whatever crazy stuff you need.

37:18.940 --> 37:22.540
So, like, I'm spiritually on the side of Oracle with this,

37:22.740 --> 37:25.540
but I felt like Google was so brazen in how they did it.

37:25.740 --> 37:28.140
I mean, we listened to the back catalog, folks.

37:28.340 --> 37:30.740
I was pretty rough on Google.

37:30.940 --> 37:33.540
And Chris was, I mean, Chris at Microsoft was great,

37:33.740 --> 37:36.140
and we should all run Windows Vista at the time.

37:36.340 --> 37:37.140
So I don't know.

37:37.340 --> 37:39.340
I mean, like, and I did that, like every episode.

37:39.340 --> 37:39.940
It was weird.

37:40.140 --> 37:45.540
I just want to say YouTube, Google, I'm sorry, Windows Action Show.

37:45.740 --> 37:46.540
Yeah.

37:46.540 --> 37:51.540
Joking aside, I feel like I sort of this is anticlimactic in a way, right?

37:51.740 --> 37:52.740
It doesn't matter.

37:52.940 --> 37:53.740
Nothing happened.

37:53.940 --> 37:56.340
Yeah, I mean, it well, it matters.

37:56.540 --> 38:01.340
I think it matters in that if the had gone, if it had gone the other way,

38:01.540 --> 38:08.140
then then it meant that implementing an identical API who would be there

38:08.340 --> 38:11.940
could have said they could have set precedent that that is a copyrightable,

38:12.140 --> 38:14.740
like court case that you could you could pursue.

38:14.740 --> 38:18.140
You're talking about when I was 19, I tried to open Mercury Broadcasting.

38:18.340 --> 38:20.340
Oh, you know what I mean?

38:20.540 --> 38:24.940
Like if if if Oracle had won, it would have set a precedent that other companies

38:25.140 --> 38:27.740
could have sued other individuals who've re implemented their APIs.

38:27.940 --> 38:28.540
Well, hang on.

38:28.740 --> 38:34.140
If Oracle had won, then Minio as a as an open source project would fail.

38:34.340 --> 38:39.140
And as a company, Oracle database, which was a clone of IBM database,

38:39.340 --> 38:43.940
right from the interface layer, would itself be invalid because let's

38:43.940 --> 38:46.140
let's Deckard Cain style.

38:46.340 --> 38:47.140
Go back here.

38:47.340 --> 38:52.940
Oracle's original business was being a clone of IBM's proprietary databases,

38:53.140 --> 38:54.340
but a little cheaper.

38:54.540 --> 38:55.940
Yeah, I hadn't thought it.

38:55.940 --> 38:56.340
You're right.

38:56.340 --> 38:57.340
I hadn't thought about that in a while.

38:57.540 --> 39:00.540
But I mean, this this is the quarter soon calling the prostitute before.

39:00.740 --> 39:02.540
I mean, this is not right.

39:02.740 --> 39:08.340
Yeah, it is kind of you know, but I guess companies change, I suppose.

39:08.540 --> 39:09.740
But there is some irony in that.

39:09.940 --> 39:10.540
It's very simple.

39:10.740 --> 39:13.340
When you're small, you have to work outside the law because

39:13.340 --> 39:16.140
you have nothing to lose when you're big.

39:16.340 --> 39:20.340
Like, by the way, we don't talk about this on this show because unfiltered

39:20.540 --> 39:25.540
exists, but Facebook suggesting Internet regulations is like the Nazis

39:25.740 --> 39:27.940
suggesting housing regulations.

39:28.140 --> 39:28.940
It's just not good.

39:29.140 --> 39:30.140
You don't want it.

39:30.340 --> 39:32.540
Yeah, they have lobbyists, so they can that's it.

39:32.540 --> 39:33.140
That's a direct.

39:33.140 --> 39:34.140
That's something they can shape.

39:34.340 --> 39:39.340
When I think about my feelings over the last nearly a decade of this

39:39.340 --> 39:44.540
thing, I think a piece of me wanted Google to have to pay some

39:44.740 --> 39:47.540
penance for the stunt they pulled with Android.

39:47.740 --> 39:50.540
I can't ever forgive them for Android.

39:50.740 --> 39:54.540
It is a bastardization of Linux that is horrible.

39:54.740 --> 39:58.140
And they made so many decisions in the name of adoption.

39:58.340 --> 39:59.140
It just doesn't work.

39:59.340 --> 40:02.540
Well, you go back to remember they were going with something that

40:02.740 --> 40:06.540
was cursor driven until they saw the iPhone event and then they

40:06.740 --> 40:08.740
switched to their Moonshot project, which was touch driven.

40:08.740 --> 40:12.140
But Android, when it first shipped, you could still dig out the cursor.

40:12.340 --> 40:14.140
It was very much still very touch focused.

40:14.340 --> 40:15.340
How about Project Butter?

40:15.540 --> 40:15.940
Right.

40:16.140 --> 40:16.740
All the time.

40:16.940 --> 40:18.540
All the times they had to address the performance.

40:18.740 --> 40:22.840
They slapped together this system that was horribly unoptimized.

40:23.040 --> 40:25.740
I mean, the early versions of Android were really bad because it

40:25.940 --> 40:27.940
was not native code running on these.

40:28.140 --> 40:28.340
Yeah.

40:28.540 --> 40:31.940
So folks who are younger won't remember these ARM processors on

40:32.140 --> 40:34.040
mobile were back in the day.

40:34.240 --> 40:34.840
They were terrible.

40:35.040 --> 40:35.540
Really bad.

40:35.740 --> 40:36.040
Yeah.

40:36.240 --> 40:36.540
Yeah.

40:36.540 --> 40:39.340
The reason iPhone programming was hard and I got to make lots of

40:39.540 --> 40:41.740
money doing it because you had no memory.

40:41.940 --> 40:43.840
It was terrible.

40:44.040 --> 40:49.440
Loading images in a list view or UI scroll view, if you will, was

40:49.640 --> 40:53.040
actually like you people had different strategies and there were

40:53.240 --> 40:55.540
I'm sure you can find them on Reddit.

40:55.740 --> 40:59.440
There were blog posts debating what is the right way to load images

40:59.640 --> 41:02.740
on iOS because you didn't have the memory to do it.

41:02.940 --> 41:04.240
Come on, you know, this is true.

41:04.440 --> 41:04.840
Oh, yeah.

41:04.840 --> 41:09.040
And it was so much worse on Android because and then you'll recall

41:09.240 --> 41:12.340
I don't need to recap history, but the incredible compromises they

41:12.540 --> 41:16.140
made with carriers to to get great sweetheart deals with the carriers

41:16.340 --> 41:19.740
to compete with the iPhone like allowing carriers to bastardize

41:19.940 --> 41:24.040
up the firmware is with their crappy apps and tracking that they

41:24.240 --> 41:28.340
crossed all these lines in the name of adoption that I felt like

41:28.540 --> 41:33.240
created a product that didn't learn anything from the Windows PC

41:33.240 --> 41:37.840
OEM era that makes shipping updates easy and fast and secure and

41:38.040 --> 41:42.840
we ended up with an OS that's now in reality in the pockets of

41:43.040 --> 41:47.440
millions of consumers with out-of-date Linux kernels out-of-date

41:47.640 --> 41:50.840
Bluetooth stacks tons of vulnerabilities vendors who stopped

41:51.040 --> 41:54.840
patching because they didn't have some driver licensing deal that

41:55.040 --> 41:58.340
went beyond two years so they couldn't supply updates past that.

41:58.540 --> 42:02.640
And so now it just gets no fixes and it just sits there open on

42:02.640 --> 42:07.640
the Internet every single day and there are millions of them and

42:07.840 --> 42:14.340
then you bring in all of the crap around this that this Oracle suit

42:14.540 --> 42:19.440
which was another example of Google cutting corners to try to get

42:19.640 --> 42:22.740
fast quick adoption to slam something into the market.

42:22.940 --> 42:26.640
So then that way they could get all of these hardware manufacturers

42:26.840 --> 42:30.840
to switch over to their crappy platform and have a horrible fight

42:30.840 --> 42:33.640
race to the bottom LG by the way just announced this week.

42:33.840 --> 42:35.740
They're out of the smartphone business entirely.

42:35.940 --> 42:40.240
That's all Google Ed Google dumped an operating system on the market

42:40.440 --> 42:42.840
that drove the value down that created a race to the bottom that

42:43.040 --> 42:47.240
created manufacturers to make these horrible deals these tour

42:47.440 --> 42:50.640
totally unsupported phones and now the market is a wash in them

42:50.840 --> 42:54.840
and what makes me sick about it is it's all on the back of Linux

42:55.040 --> 42:58.140
Linux is at the core of all of these and it's a bastardization of

42:58.140 --> 43:01.640
what is a beautiful operating system that could deliver a secure

43:01.840 --> 43:06.940
free user experience and instead has been perverted by Google for

43:07.140 --> 43:11.240
this use all while getting their backs patted by the open source

43:11.440 --> 43:15.840
community loving them every step of the way for their open source

43:16.040 --> 43:20.040
stance and their open source support and their summer of code.

43:20.240 --> 43:23.540
And so we never question the almighty Google even though they've

43:23.740 --> 43:27.040
taken the beautiful platform that is Linux and they've weaponized

43:27.040 --> 43:32.540
it as a tracking platform as and now not intentionally an exploit

43:32.740 --> 43:35.240
paradise and it's all on the back of Linux and I hate it.

43:35.440 --> 43:39.540
I turned it into slow the fact that they spent years trying to

43:39.740 --> 43:41.340
perfect a goddamn scroll view.

43:42.340 --> 43:46.240
I'm sorry, but no, I know it seems like a mean mean but that is

43:46.440 --> 43:47.340
a stupid problem.

43:47.540 --> 43:49.640
Yeah, it's just been a bad product and they're there.

43:49.840 --> 43:52.640
You know what they're by the time they finally get a fairly decent

43:52.840 --> 43:55.340
which is I mean, it's not it's pretty it's in a pretty good state

43:55.340 --> 43:58.640
now, you know, I enjoy my pixel but it's still not as good as

43:58.840 --> 44:01.640
iOS, you know, if somebody comes to me with it with a business

44:01.840 --> 44:02.640
ID and they have an Android.

44:02.840 --> 44:06.140
I just ignore you just decide right there.

44:06.340 --> 44:07.340
Oh, they got an Android wear watch.

44:07.540 --> 44:09.640
I won't let them in the door and I'm not even joking.

44:09.840 --> 44:11.140
I've read VC posts.

44:11.340 --> 44:13.740
People say if a founder comes to me as an Android.

44:13.940 --> 44:16.640
Nope, I don't know how I feel about that.

44:16.840 --> 44:19.240
It's about taste and you can look that up.

44:19.440 --> 44:21.840
I feel like they've done a better job with Chrome OS that was

44:22.040 --> 44:22.940
just brought up by the chat room.

44:22.940 --> 44:26.740
I feel like that's been better managed by Google Chrome OS.

44:26.940 --> 44:28.940
You know what the good mobile OS was?

44:29.140 --> 44:30.240
Yeah web OS.

44:30.440 --> 44:33.240
Well, yes web OS but no boys was never going to happen.

44:33.440 --> 44:34.440
Windows Phone 8.

44:34.640 --> 44:36.140
No, it had a registry dude.

44:36.340 --> 44:37.240
It's out right there.

44:37.440 --> 44:39.840
If it has a registry, it's not on my it's not going in my pocket.

44:40.040 --> 44:40.840
This is not happening.

44:41.040 --> 44:44.040
Yeah, but web OS was actually the good one and come on.

44:44.240 --> 44:44.740
It was from HP.

44:44.940 --> 44:50.140
It was never going to happen for some reason the Google YouTube

44:50.140 --> 44:53.940
YouTube algorithm thingy decided to show me commercials of the

44:54.140 --> 44:56.040
compact I pack from that era.

44:56.240 --> 45:00.840
So the late 90s, I guess in my feet and for whatever reason it

45:01.040 --> 45:03.940
was right and I watched it and man, I had one of those.

45:04.140 --> 45:05.940
I actually really liked it.

45:06.140 --> 45:08.440
If you were in that ecosystem and you had like the exchange

45:08.640 --> 45:09.040
integration.

45:09.240 --> 45:10.740
It was it was pretty cool.

45:10.940 --> 45:14.240
Just want to say I was a Windows 95 power user.

45:14.440 --> 45:14.840
Oh, yeah.

45:15.040 --> 45:16.940
Did you actually you know, you got to get the plus pack then

45:17.140 --> 45:18.440
so that way you get the themes and stuff.

45:18.440 --> 45:21.840
Oh, no, I upgraded from 3.1 and then and then you had to get

45:22.040 --> 45:24.340
the Windows 95 like OSR 2 or whatever.

45:24.540 --> 45:26.540
It was where they added USB support.

45:26.740 --> 45:27.440
I couldn't do it.

45:27.640 --> 45:31.240
I was on Windows and I but then I got a gateway.

45:31.440 --> 45:32.040
Oh, yeah.

45:32.240 --> 45:33.140
Cow Box.

45:33.340 --> 45:33.640
Yep.

45:33.840 --> 45:37.740
Walk in the Casbah, but then I upgraded to Windows 98.

45:37.940 --> 45:38.440
What's wrong?

45:38.640 --> 45:39.240
Maybe it was great.

45:39.440 --> 45:39.940
Didn't work.

45:40.140 --> 45:41.040
It was slow.

45:41.340 --> 45:41.840
Oh, yeah.

45:42.040 --> 45:43.240
You definitely felt it back then.

45:43.440 --> 45:45.740
Felt it, especially on low-end systems.

45:45.740 --> 45:48.840
You you and my systems were low.

45:49.040 --> 45:50.340
Yeah, you felt the pain.

45:50.540 --> 45:51.640
Yeah, you really felt it.

45:51.840 --> 45:52.240
Mm hmm.

45:52.440 --> 45:54.140
Yeah, it was one of those things where like we were, you know,

45:54.340 --> 45:55.840
reminds me of the email we got earlier in the show.

45:56.040 --> 45:58.740
It's like you have no idea back then.

45:58.940 --> 45:59.840
I mean, it sold new machines.

46:00.040 --> 46:02.040
People would just buy it back then when a new Windows would

46:02.240 --> 46:02.740
come out.

46:02.940 --> 46:05.140
That's when people just buy entirely new PCs with Windows

46:05.340 --> 46:05.940
preloaded on it.

46:06.140 --> 46:09.340
Then I sort of skipped Vista because I wasn't crazy.

46:09.940 --> 46:11.140
Then I went to seven.

46:11.340 --> 46:14.740
Then I went to Mac and Linux and I'm not going to talk about

46:14.740 --> 46:16.840
the machine I'm on now because people will send me hate mail.

46:17.040 --> 46:18.340
Well, besides, you got to replace that thing.

46:18.540 --> 46:21.140
Anyway, it's got those dirty x86 processors in it, right?

46:21.340 --> 46:23.140
I've done some benchmarks on my MacBook Air.

46:23.340 --> 46:24.340
It's not great.

46:24.540 --> 46:25.040
Yeah.

46:25.440 --> 46:25.940
Oh, yeah.

46:26.140 --> 46:26.640
Oh, good.

46:26.840 --> 46:28.340
Let's do a little anti-m1 for a moment.

46:28.540 --> 46:30.140
So the iMac Pro crushed it, huh?

46:30.340 --> 46:31.740
No, no, no.

46:31.940 --> 46:33.440
Oh, no, that's not what happened.

46:33.640 --> 46:34.340
Oh, damn it.

46:34.540 --> 46:36.840
It's the iMac Pro has beautiful screen.

46:37.040 --> 46:37.540
Uh-huh.

46:37.740 --> 46:38.240
Yeah.

46:38.640 --> 46:40.540
But did it beat it on the CPU test?

46:40.740 --> 46:41.940
Tell me it beat the M1.

46:42.140 --> 46:44.440
It's my special little computer and I love it.

46:44.440 --> 46:45.540
I love it very much.

46:45.740 --> 46:48.440
You're not answering the question, which I think means that it didn't.

46:48.640 --> 46:50.140
Oh, I didn't need to hear that.

46:50.340 --> 46:52.640
Unless the GPU becomes involved.

46:52.840 --> 46:53.640
Ah, yeah, sure.

46:53.840 --> 46:54.740
The air is faster.

46:54.940 --> 46:56.340
Pour one out for the x86.

47:00.540 --> 47:04.540
Honestly, if I was Intel CEO right now, I would not be making snarky

47:04.740 --> 47:07.640
commercials with Justin Long.

47:08.140 --> 47:09.440
I would be at the bar crying.

47:09.940 --> 47:11.340
That might be my character flaw.

47:11.340 --> 47:16.240
Maybe you can do both, you know, but he is the CEO of Intel.

47:16.440 --> 47:17.140
You can probably do both.

47:17.340 --> 47:18.540
But do you need Justin Long?

47:18.740 --> 47:20.840
I mean, no, no, it does.

47:21.040 --> 47:21.840
It's bad too, right?

47:22.040 --> 47:26.240
Because the funny thing is, is like you're so he's essentially getting

47:26.440 --> 47:29.340
on products that still are shipping with Intel processors in them.

47:29.540 --> 47:31.440
Like they still I mean the whole thing's like they're making funny.

47:31.640 --> 47:33.540
They're making fun of MacBooks, but they're still MacBooks selling

47:33.740 --> 47:34.540
with Intel processors.

47:35.240 --> 47:36.340
It was an awkward moment.

47:36.740 --> 47:40.540
Like I just want to say making an advertising campaign campaign dunking

47:40.540 --> 47:44.140
on one of your biggest customers seems super stupid to me.

47:44.340 --> 47:45.540
I don't know.

47:45.740 --> 47:46.540
Yeah, yeah.

47:46.940 --> 47:47.440
What do we know?

47:50.040 --> 47:51.740
Linode.com slash coder.

47:51.940 --> 47:54.740
Receive a $100 safety day credit towards your new account.

47:54.940 --> 47:58.740
Yeah, a hundred dollars, a hundred dollars and you support the show.

47:58.940 --> 47:59.840
Linode is awesome.

48:00.040 --> 48:03.140
It's powerful and you can simplify your cloud infrastructure with Linode's

48:03.340 --> 48:06.440
great prices and modern Linux virtual machines and tools to develop,

48:06.440 --> 48:10.740
deploy and scale applications faster and easier than ever.

48:10.940 --> 48:13.140
And what I love about Linode is they are independent.

48:13.340 --> 48:17.740
They've been around since 2003 and they are in full control.

48:17.940 --> 48:19.240
They set their own ISP up.

48:19.440 --> 48:20.340
They run their data centers.

48:20.540 --> 48:21.940
They have 11 of them around the world.

48:22.140 --> 48:26.740
Super fast connections, super fast native SSDs and of course 40 gigabit

48:26.940 --> 48:28.840
connections coming into each one of those machines.

48:29.140 --> 48:31.540
Linode can really help your ideas come to life on the web too.

48:31.740 --> 48:34.740
If you want to set up a personal portfolio, maybe you want to put

48:34.740 --> 48:36.940
a resume online that looks nice or a status pager.

48:37.340 --> 48:40.040
Maybe you want to host the backend infrastructure for your community's

48:40.240 --> 48:44.240
chat platform or something even else that, heck, I don't really know

48:44.440 --> 48:46.740
because I'm not you, but I know Linode can do it.

48:46.940 --> 48:50.440
They have a full range of systems, dedicated CPUs, dedicated GPUs,

48:50.740 --> 48:52.140
$5 a month systems.

48:52.340 --> 48:56.540
They're great and they're 30 to 50% cheaper than the big shops like

48:56.740 --> 48:59.240
Azure or that AWS you may have heard of.

48:59.440 --> 49:02.340
And they have features similar like S3 compatible object storage,

49:02.340 --> 49:06.440
cloud firewalls, simple one-click application deployment and a lot more.

49:06.640 --> 49:09.440
So you should probably just go check it out for yourself and see why

49:09.640 --> 49:11.840
they are our cloud hosting provider of choice.

49:12.040 --> 49:15.840
Everything we've built and all of the things we have continued to build,

49:16.040 --> 49:18.040
it's just really gotten pretty awesome.

49:18.240 --> 49:20.240
I should do a machine count at some point.

49:20.440 --> 49:24.040
We run it all on Linode and you can too, linode.com slash coder.

49:24.240 --> 49:27.040
I found them a few years ago, started as just something I was doing

49:27.240 --> 49:30.940
on my own as a personal thing and now I use them for everything.

49:30.940 --> 49:34.440
And you can too and you can support the show while getting that $100 credit

49:34.640 --> 49:37.240
at linode.com slash coder.

49:39.440 --> 49:43.640
Are you going over to the WWDC website right now to make your plans

49:43.840 --> 49:45.440
because it's been announced.

49:45.640 --> 49:48.040
We now know it's going to be virtual again this year.

49:48.240 --> 49:53.040
They are leaning in hard on the Craig Federighi staring at his laptop

49:53.240 --> 49:57.040
in a weird way and they've announced it'll be June 7th to the 11th

49:57.040 --> 50:02.440
for the all online program open to everybody free at no cost.

50:02.640 --> 50:08.340
And even if you're not a Apple developer or even interested in any

50:08.540 --> 50:11.440
particular thing from Apple, it's kind of fascinating to watch this

50:11.640 --> 50:15.340
from a production standpoint because boy howdy if these aren't just

50:15.540 --> 50:19.040
the peak of virtual conference production like nobody does it like

50:19.240 --> 50:19.740
these guys do.

50:19.940 --> 50:23.940
They also this year are doing a Swift student challenge and they're

50:24.140 --> 50:25.240
going to have additional details on that.

50:25.240 --> 50:30.440
So teaching the young ones the Swift it's a big focus at WWDC got to

50:30.640 --> 50:31.540
get the young ones learned up.

50:31.740 --> 50:34.540
I guess if you hate children, that might be a thing you would do.

50:34.740 --> 50:40.540
No, but I mean, I obviously would love someone to look at me like

50:40.740 --> 50:43.440
Craig Federighi looks at the MacBook Air.

50:43.640 --> 50:45.040
I mean, who doesn't want that?

50:45.240 --> 50:48.840
And yes, I'm going to WWDC and no, I don't think there's going to be

50:49.040 --> 50:51.440
AR glasses because battery life.

50:51.640 --> 50:54.840
This is the shit about the Apple community.

50:54.840 --> 51:02.740
That is so annoying the incessant yammering on about like VR goggles

51:02.940 --> 51:07.240
or AR or will Apple build a car like get over yourselves like who

51:07.440 --> 51:11.240
just wait and see what they ship like this is the like the community.

51:11.440 --> 51:16.040
There's so much Palace intrigue type stories and rumor mill and

51:16.240 --> 51:18.640
they have a giant processor transition they're doing.

51:18.840 --> 51:20.340
Yeah, they are not shipping.

51:20.340 --> 51:25.040
And first of all, the glasses have a particular problem of the boundaries

51:25.240 --> 51:26.540
of physics with battery life.

51:26.740 --> 51:31.540
Now, unless they have some amazing battery technology, which honestly,

51:31.740 --> 51:35.240
if they have it, they should license it to everybody because that

51:35.440 --> 51:36.240
would change humanity.

51:36.440 --> 51:37.640
Really?

51:37.840 --> 51:40.140
Yeah, let's share it share with the world, right?

51:40.340 --> 51:40.840
Seriously.

51:41.040 --> 51:44.240
No, I'm not being addicted to get such battery capacity in such a

51:44.440 --> 51:49.240
small package would be a significant leap in like actual battery

51:49.240 --> 51:50.240
physics, right?

51:50.440 --> 51:53.840
Actual like the science of storing energy that would be different.

51:54.040 --> 51:58.540
Like they would be dunking on Elon Musk like he was the, you know,

51:58.740 --> 52:01.140
junior University basketball team in their shack.

52:01.340 --> 52:04.640
But if we return to reality, they don't have that.

52:04.840 --> 52:07.040
There's not going to be air glasses.

52:07.240 --> 52:09.840
So it's so annoying.

52:10.040 --> 52:13.640
If you think if this isn't just the way they shouldn't just do this

52:13.840 --> 52:16.440
because I'll tell you what, man, you get a lot more information

52:16.440 --> 52:19.340
this way because you don't have to pay a thousand dollars to go.

52:19.540 --> 52:22.340
It makes a way more accessible to people that are considering getting

52:22.540 --> 52:23.040
in development.

52:23.240 --> 52:26.840
It makes a way more accessible to children specifically who could

52:27.040 --> 52:29.240
never get access to this stuff because they sometimes, you know,

52:29.440 --> 52:31.040
they're not old enough to have credit cards and whatnot.

52:31.240 --> 52:36.340
I think like there is a big net benefit to make this open to all

52:36.540 --> 52:42.540
and instead of this like this like exclusive only like 2,000 people

52:42.540 --> 52:46.240
to 4,000 people can make it there and it's a thousand dollar ticket

52:46.440 --> 52:48.440
and the price is only going to go up because there's less and less

52:48.640 --> 52:49.240
space available.

52:49.440 --> 52:52.340
I appreciate the value of those in-person events.

52:52.540 --> 52:56.440
You know me, I really understand the value, but this seems like

52:56.640 --> 53:01.240
a net improvement for everyone because even a casual like me can

53:01.440 --> 53:04.340
attend these and I can feel more informed and I like to have the

53:04.540 --> 53:05.540
technical details of things.

53:05.740 --> 53:08.740
I am conflicted as a dev.

53:08.740 --> 53:13.740
I feel like the online format is better, but as a sales guy or like

53:13.940 --> 53:17.040
a business owner, I guess which is really a glorified sales guy,

53:17.240 --> 53:17.340
right?

53:17.540 --> 53:21.640
There's something about the conference like pub scene, you know,

53:21.840 --> 53:23.340
the hall track, right?

53:23.540 --> 53:28.040
Having said that, WWDC, I mean, I don't want to be too negative.

53:28.240 --> 53:31.140
If there's a good API that I think I could build a cool app on,

53:31.340 --> 53:31.840
I'm going to do it.

53:32.040 --> 53:32.840
Absolutely.

53:33.040 --> 53:35.240
Right, look, and I'm going to watch this whole thing and I'm going

53:35.440 --> 53:36.540
to be on the hunt for something like that.

53:36.540 --> 53:41.240
But my entire problem, like I'm a, you know, you know, this Chris,

53:41.440 --> 53:45.540
I'm a huge iPad believer, but the problems are Apple's policies,

53:45.740 --> 53:46.540
not the technology.

53:46.740 --> 53:49.240
I mean, I don't want to say I'm not going to build something on

53:49.440 --> 53:53.040
iOS because obviously, you know me, I get excited and I do something

53:53.240 --> 53:54.740
and then I don't ship it because I'm crazy.

53:54.940 --> 53:58.540
Coderbytes is not coming because of trademark reasons, by the way.

53:58.740 --> 54:00.040
So it will be something else.

54:00.240 --> 54:02.940
Oh, man, we'll get another.

54:03.140 --> 54:04.840
I'm sure there'll be another name out there that'll work.

54:04.840 --> 54:07.240
It's going to be a coder balls.

54:07.440 --> 54:09.140
Inappropriate past.

54:09.340 --> 54:12.140
Mike was wise, you know, past Mike was much calmer.

54:12.340 --> 54:15.640
No, but I mean, are you excited for WWC?

54:15.840 --> 54:16.940
I mean, I kind of don't give a crap.

54:17.140 --> 54:17.840
No, I actually am.

54:18.040 --> 54:18.640
I am.

54:18.840 --> 54:19.640
This is home pods.

54:19.840 --> 54:23.440
It's the cumulative radiation from all those home pods.

54:23.640 --> 54:27.640
Okay, no, it's not the home pods, but I think they I think they're

54:27.840 --> 54:28.140
delivering.

54:28.340 --> 54:30.940
I think the iOS platform is looking better than ever.

54:31.140 --> 54:32.740
I find it fascinating.

54:32.740 --> 54:36.740
The last couple of WWDCs, we've seen them allow some major changes to

54:36.940 --> 54:38.140
iOS we hadn't seen in the past.

54:38.340 --> 54:40.040
I think the M1 platform is going to get iterated on.

54:40.240 --> 54:41.940
That'll be interesting.

54:42.140 --> 54:44.540
And then I think they'll probably send me into some sort of existential

54:44.740 --> 54:48.840
crisis and panic when I worry that Linux users will leave us all.

54:49.040 --> 54:51.440
But, you know, I've calmed down.

54:51.640 --> 54:52.040
I've calmed down.

54:52.240 --> 54:56.240
I think I think there is a good a good portion of Linux users out there

54:56.440 --> 54:59.240
who will never be swayed by the shinies of Apple, regardless of what they do.

54:59.440 --> 55:01.940
And I have good news for those of us on the platform.

55:01.940 --> 55:05.440
Mike, this has been sorely needed.

55:05.640 --> 55:11.440
A library that essentially plays a role in just defining the visual language

55:11.640 --> 55:12.640
of a GNOME application.

55:12.840 --> 55:14.540
You want to make a GNOME application.

55:14.740 --> 55:18.640
You can use Lib Adwaitia to now do that.

55:18.840 --> 55:21.140
Sort of like elementary OS's Granite.

55:21.340 --> 55:25.040
This is going to be something that's available to all GTK developers.

55:25.240 --> 55:27.740
It'll track specific releases with GNOME.

55:27.940 --> 55:31.240
So you can target like a GNOME 40 look or a GNOME 42 look.

55:31.240 --> 55:35.840
And they'll include guidelines as well as code and the idea will be a

55:36.040 --> 55:39.540
library that kind of grows over time that gives developers an ability to

55:39.740 --> 55:43.840
get some of the basics of a standard GNOME application without having

55:44.040 --> 55:46.840
to lay out every single button themselves and decide where it all goes.

55:47.040 --> 55:50.140
It's like the missing library that the desktop environment needed to

55:50.340 --> 55:52.140
get application developers started quicker.

55:52.340 --> 55:54.240
Yeah, here I come.

55:54.440 --> 55:58.140
I bring my nice little thing and I say, look, Daddy, they finally did it.

55:58.140 --> 56:01.240
They fixed a complaint of yours and you give me nothing.

56:01.440 --> 56:06.640
You smack it out of my hand and you just tell me to piss off.

56:06.840 --> 56:09.440
Well, let me ask you, how many users are going to pay for that software

56:09.640 --> 56:10.540
you built with that library?

56:10.740 --> 56:11.940
Oh, well, OK.

56:12.140 --> 56:13.240
I mean, there's, you know.

56:13.440 --> 56:13.740
Yeah.

56:13.940 --> 56:14.440
OK, all right.

56:14.640 --> 56:18.840
I admit I acknowledge the payment thing's a little tricky, but I grant you.

56:19.040 --> 56:20.640
Tricky? It's tricky.

56:20.840 --> 56:22.440
I would call it the battle.

56:22.640 --> 56:24.040
What battle?

56:24.240 --> 56:26.240
Hang on. The sixth day? No, hang on.

56:26.240 --> 56:28.840
But what was the complete route?

56:29.040 --> 56:31.040
Oh, the Alamo.

56:31.240 --> 56:33.640
Yeah, actually, the Alamo, they held up for a while.

56:33.840 --> 56:34.140
Hang on.

56:34.340 --> 56:36.540
Well, a lot of apps do and then they finally fall.

56:36.740 --> 56:37.440
That does happen.

56:37.640 --> 56:39.440
Oh, it's France and World War Two.

56:39.640 --> 56:40.440
Write down.

56:40.640 --> 56:41.640
Sorry, French people.

56:41.840 --> 56:42.240
I'm not sorry.

56:42.440 --> 56:43.140
My stepfather's French.

56:43.340 --> 56:43.540
So.

56:48.340 --> 56:50.640
Oh, Mike of the past.

56:50.840 --> 56:52.240
So that was a lot of fun.

56:52.240 --> 56:56.840
I listened to that whole episode with you and was making a few notes of a couple

56:56.840 --> 56:57.840
of things I want to follow up on.

56:58.040 --> 57:03.240
But if anything crossed your mind, go to coder.show contact and send it in.

57:03.440 --> 57:04.440
What should we follow up on?

57:04.640 --> 57:05.240
Let us know.

57:05.440 --> 57:07.240
Also, I want to thank our members.

57:07.440 --> 57:09.240
Coder QA dot co.

57:09.440 --> 57:11.840
If you want to become a member, a new Coderly is nigh.

57:12.040 --> 57:14.040
You support the show, you get a limited ad feed.

57:14.240 --> 57:16.440
It's just a great way to know that you're helping keep the show independent.

57:16.640 --> 57:20.240
I say, you know, if you got something you enjoy listening to, it's nice knowing

57:20.240 --> 57:22.240
that you're helping keep it that way.

57:22.440 --> 57:26.440
You can also support the entire network and get access to the features for all

57:26.640 --> 57:29.640
of the network shows at Jupiter Party.

57:29.840 --> 57:33.040
And also a big thank you to everybody who sends the show a boost.

57:33.240 --> 57:36.040
We didn't get a chance to read them this week or at least read them on air.

57:36.240 --> 57:39.440
But we do actually read them every single time you send them in.

57:39.640 --> 57:42.640
If you'd like to send us a boost and see how much fun it is, get a new podcast

57:42.840 --> 57:46.940
app at new podcast apps dot com and then send us a boost.

57:47.140 --> 57:48.940
If you don't have any stats yet, something like strike.

57:48.940 --> 57:50.640
It's a great way to do that.

57:50.840 --> 57:51.840
You can find Mike on Twitter.

57:52.040 --> 57:54.940
He's at Dumanuco and his company is at the Mad Botter Inc.

57:55.140 --> 57:56.140
You can follow me over there.

57:56.340 --> 57:57.640
Yeah, I'm over there.

57:57.840 --> 57:59.240
I mostly just reply.

57:59.440 --> 58:00.440
I don't really tweet much.

58:00.640 --> 58:01.240
Maybe that's a good thing.

58:01.440 --> 58:02.040
Maybe it's not.

58:02.240 --> 58:04.740
I don't seem to get rewarded by the Twitter algorithm for it, though.

58:04.940 --> 58:07.840
At Chris Elias, though, if you want to engage in that shenanigans, this year

58:08.040 --> 58:12.640
podcast at Coder Radio Show and the network is at Jupiter Signal and the

58:12.840 --> 58:13.840
links to what we talked about today.

58:14.040 --> 58:17.840
That's going to be over at Coder dot show slash four six zero.

58:17.840 --> 58:21.040
Don't forget, Talescale is on board now at the Coder Radio program.

58:21.240 --> 58:24.440
Go get yourself a super secure mesh network.

58:24.640 --> 58:26.840
That's a Talescale dot com slash Coder.

58:27.040 --> 58:30.040
And of course, a big thank you to Linode for their continued support.

58:30.240 --> 58:33.940
