00:00.000 --> 00:11.280
This is KOTORadio, episode 477 for August 1st, 2022.

00:11.280 --> 00:19.760
Hey, good buddy, welcome back to Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show, taking a pragmatic look

00:19.760 --> 00:25.040
at the art and the business of software development and the world of technology.

00:25.040 --> 00:30.160
My name is Chris, and joining us every single week with his laser pointer, it's our host,

00:30.160 --> 00:31.160
Mr. Dominic.

00:31.160 --> 00:32.160
Hello, Mike.

00:32.160 --> 00:37.400
Salutations, hear ye, hear ye, from ye olde Renfer edition of KOTORadio.

00:37.400 --> 00:44.000
I'm going to admit something to you, didn't actually know it was August until that exact

00:44.000 --> 00:45.480
moment when I read the date.

00:45.480 --> 00:49.020
I looked down at the date, and I just realized it was August.

00:49.020 --> 00:52.200
As always, folks, we're at our normal peak performance.

00:52.200 --> 00:55.120
Programs are operational, but barely just so.

00:55.120 --> 00:57.160
Oh, man, it's just every day, right?

00:57.160 --> 00:58.280
It's just, what does it matter?

00:58.280 --> 01:00.840
Every day's a workday, so it doesn't really matter, I suppose.

01:00.840 --> 01:02.840
Seven days a week, all air day, all day.

01:02.840 --> 01:04.680
I got something kind of special for you.

01:04.680 --> 01:08.720
So we've been doing the video stream of the shows now over at Jupiter.Tube, and we've

01:08.720 --> 01:14.200
been kind of coming up with music to kick the shows off with as the stream opens up.

01:14.200 --> 01:19.060
DeckBot wrote in a suggestion, and it was a good suggestion, but I wanted to take it

01:19.060 --> 01:20.060
a bit further.

01:20.060 --> 01:21.480
I wanted to make it even better.

01:21.480 --> 01:24.360
I wanted to make it something special to the show.

01:24.360 --> 01:29.600
So I'm going to play a hit, and I want you to tell me if you can identify when and where

01:29.600 --> 01:30.760
this hit comes from.

01:30.760 --> 01:32.280
I grabbed this for you.

01:32.280 --> 01:35.720
That's your one and only hint, is I went out and I got this for you based on DeckBot's

01:35.720 --> 01:36.720
email.

01:36.720 --> 01:59.240
All right, ring any bells?

01:59.240 --> 02:00.240
It weirdly does.

02:00.240 --> 02:01.240
It's for me.

02:01.240 --> 02:02.240
It's for you.

02:02.240 --> 02:05.920
How does it make you feel when you hear it?

02:05.920 --> 02:06.920
I kind of like it.

02:06.920 --> 02:07.920
I'm kind of into it.

02:07.920 --> 02:08.920
Yeah?

02:08.920 --> 02:11.840
It reminds you of better times?

02:11.840 --> 02:12.840
Is it the 90s?

02:12.840 --> 02:13.840
Is it?

02:13.840 --> 02:14.840
Hmm.

02:14.840 --> 02:17.000
I feel like I'm walking into a trap.

02:17.000 --> 02:20.560
My Admiral Ackbar sensors are blaring right now.

02:20.560 --> 02:21.560
I don't know.

02:21.560 --> 02:22.560
What is it?

02:22.560 --> 02:25.640
It is the opening video to Snow Leopard after a fresh install.

02:25.640 --> 02:26.640
Damn it.

02:26.640 --> 02:27.640
I knew it.

02:27.640 --> 02:28.640
Oh, I knew it was something.

02:28.640 --> 02:31.280
I was like, I sound so familiar and I feel so happy.

02:31.280 --> 02:34.360
I just thought maybe it was like a Jar Jar thing, like there was some Jar Jar skit I

02:34.360 --> 02:36.160
didn't know about.

02:36.160 --> 02:37.160
Yeah, that's the back.

02:37.160 --> 02:38.560
That's the little music they'd play.

02:38.560 --> 02:41.200
You know, when that video come up in all the different languages and they'd welcome you

02:41.200 --> 02:42.200
to the desktop.

02:42.200 --> 02:43.200
That's right.

02:43.200 --> 02:44.200
It's terrible now.

02:44.200 --> 02:48.120
I just had to pay them back today, but yeah, yeah, no, today they don't care.

02:48.120 --> 02:49.120
Now they're like, yeah, whatever.

02:49.120 --> 02:50.120
They don't care about it.

02:50.120 --> 02:51.120
You don't need a fancy video.

02:51.120 --> 02:52.120
Screw you.

02:52.120 --> 02:53.120
But back then, you know, that was a big deal.

02:53.120 --> 02:57.740
In fact, you could even, a machine could even play video was a big deal back then.

02:57.740 --> 02:58.740
What does your machine have?

02:58.740 --> 02:59.740
Video.

02:59.740 --> 03:00.740
What?

03:00.740 --> 03:02.920
Yeah, I can do it.

03:02.920 --> 03:05.040
All right, Jacob wrote into the show.

03:05.040 --> 03:09.500
In a recent episode, you guys were talking about WSL, I work for a very large retailer

03:09.500 --> 03:14.880
with a large IT department and a mature set of practices, especially about what machines

03:14.880 --> 03:16.640
and operating systems they use.

03:16.640 --> 03:18.840
Linux machines are not on the list.

03:18.840 --> 03:21.220
Macs and PCs.

03:21.220 --> 03:22.220
That's it.

03:22.220 --> 03:25.520
For the Mac based people, having access to a good terminal is no problem.

03:25.520 --> 03:28.140
I've introduced them to warp, thanks Mike.

03:28.140 --> 03:32.400
For the PC folks, well, things are a bit more challenging.

03:32.400 --> 03:36.300
We've had a scenario where two of our engineers were unable to run the scripts they needed

03:36.300 --> 03:40.160
to because they didn't have some of the tools native to Linux or Mac.

03:40.160 --> 03:46.800
So they installed WSL and after a quick restart and a quick app to get, they were up and running.

03:46.800 --> 03:49.180
This was super efficient.

03:49.180 --> 03:54.960
We didn't have to request a Linux box from IT and get to wait for the ticket to be solved.

03:54.960 --> 03:59.400
We didn't have to wait for a Linux VM to get spun up for us.

03:59.400 --> 04:04.160
WSL's technique of enabling a Linux within our enterprise solution that just fits allowed

04:04.160 --> 04:10.460
us to quickly meet our needs without triggering any of the security configs on the machine.

04:10.460 --> 04:18.000
From my experience, WSL has the space and makes our workflow a lot more efficient.

04:18.000 --> 04:23.120
The whole IT angle, right, of needing to provision a machine or even provision a VM.

04:23.120 --> 04:24.640
And with WSL, you could just check a box.

04:24.640 --> 04:28.120
Now you've got to have certain privileges to get that installed, but assuming you have

04:28.120 --> 04:35.140
those, yeah, that's the secret success right there is that WSL will end up having more

04:35.140 --> 04:41.160
dark matter developers using it than all of the Linux desktop users combined.

04:41.160 --> 04:43.160
Just that one category of user.

04:43.160 --> 04:46.560
And the question is, and this is the flamework question, are they Linux users?

04:46.560 --> 04:48.480
I'm going to go ahead and say kind of.

04:48.480 --> 04:55.820
I mean, I kind of feel like you have to say yes if you agree that by using the Linux kernel

04:55.820 --> 04:59.920
to do this, which they are with WSL, then they're Linux users.

04:59.920 --> 05:04.080
But then that also means Android users are Linux users by that same definition.

05:04.080 --> 05:07.880
Do you agree that all Android users are Linux users?

05:07.880 --> 05:08.880
No.

05:08.880 --> 05:10.400
I mean, so it's funny, right?

05:10.400 --> 05:15.520
Because the WSL guys are literally going to be pulling from either, you know, Debian packages

05:15.520 --> 05:19.560
or if they're using, what was it, the one I use, Penguin, right?

05:19.560 --> 05:24.360
Which is, I think, although they have flavors now, they have a fedora flavor, but it's Debian

05:24.360 --> 05:25.360
based.

05:25.360 --> 05:30.240
And their day-to-day workflow right in Windows terminal, which is effectively going to be

05:30.240 --> 05:37.160
a bass or Z shell, is a lot closer to a desktop Linux users than a desktop Windows user.

05:37.160 --> 05:40.880
If they're doing like web dev and I can feel the hatred flowing, I just got like a wave

05:40.880 --> 05:43.080
of anger in the universe at me.

05:43.080 --> 05:50.440
So you think it's like part technology stack, but also part of what you're doing?

05:50.440 --> 05:52.200
Like are you using the system?

05:52.200 --> 05:53.200
Yeah.

05:53.200 --> 05:57.080
See, this one, I don't even know how valuable of a question this is, right?

05:57.080 --> 05:58.080
Yeah, yeah.

05:58.080 --> 06:02.920
But this becomes a weird question because of somebody who, let's take our good friend

06:02.920 --> 06:04.160
Alan Jude, right?

06:04.160 --> 06:09.000
If somebody who, not to pick on Alan, but you know, lives in a Windows 7 machine, but

06:09.000 --> 06:13.960
basically works on Unix C servers all day, every day in terminal, or even someone like

06:13.960 --> 06:19.240
me who, okay, spends a lot of time working on a Mac machine, but uses the Mac machine

06:19.240 --> 06:24.680
to SSH into Linux boxes almost all day and write code for Linux machines.

06:24.680 --> 06:27.200
And you know, is that not like working in Linux?

06:27.200 --> 06:28.200
I don't know.

06:28.200 --> 06:29.200
Right.

06:29.200 --> 06:30.840
And Alan is producing code for FreeBSD.

06:30.840 --> 06:31.840
For FreeBSD.

06:31.840 --> 06:32.840
Yep.

06:32.840 --> 06:33.840
Yep.

06:33.840 --> 06:34.840
Because the devil.

06:34.840 --> 06:35.840
Yes.

06:35.840 --> 06:36.840
But I don't know.

06:36.840 --> 06:39.960
I mean, maybe you would say they're not like gooey Linux users, but you know, we've been

06:39.960 --> 06:41.600
talking about this a long time.

06:41.600 --> 06:43.880
The value of Linux is really the kernel.

06:43.880 --> 06:44.880
Yeah.

06:44.880 --> 06:46.980
I'd say it's the platform to run things on.

06:46.980 --> 06:51.040
Like it's a general compute platform, and you can move that to your Windows platform,

06:51.040 --> 06:52.040
I suppose.

06:52.040 --> 06:53.040
All right.

06:53.040 --> 06:55.440
Well, let's switch over to the other side.

06:55.440 --> 06:58.720
Travis writes in, and this is an interesting one.

06:58.720 --> 07:00.000
Hey guys, question.

07:00.000 --> 07:06.760
I want to do an Apple research project, which is an expansion of a current small scale official

07:06.760 --> 07:12.120
IRB certified research on the secondary traumatic stress disorder for healthcare workers.

07:12.120 --> 07:15.500
So it's sort of like PTSD, but for healthcare workers.

07:15.500 --> 07:20.240
And Travis wants to do a study using the Apple research kit, which uses a bunch of metrics

07:20.240 --> 07:24.920
from the watch to monitor things like heart rate and blood oxygen level and steps and

07:24.920 --> 07:26.640
all of that kind of stuff.

07:26.640 --> 07:28.120
Travis already has this ongoing.

07:28.120 --> 07:32.840
He says, when I go to the Apple website and I dig around with the email correspondence

07:32.840 --> 07:36.760
I have so far, it seems like they want me to bring my own app dev team to the table

07:36.760 --> 07:39.160
to create this project.

07:39.160 --> 07:44.240
Currently I'm heading up one of the larger studies on STSD that I know of at least, involving

07:44.240 --> 07:48.280
three different departments of one level, one trauma center in Virginia.

07:48.280 --> 07:51.880
I am to use this study to get funding for and head up a larger study using the Apple

07:51.880 --> 07:57.800
research kit to make this the largest study on STSD in the world to date.

07:57.800 --> 08:02.160
My angle is that with Apple research, I can incorporate not only survey results, but data

08:02.160 --> 08:05.600
from iPhones and metrics from Apple watches to create what I believe could be a pivotal

08:05.600 --> 08:09.880
study that includes heart rate, O2 steps, and other measurable data from phones and

08:09.880 --> 08:12.680
watches to give a complete picture.

08:12.680 --> 08:18.040
Now, I am an emergency nurse by trade and I know very little about coding or who I should

08:18.040 --> 08:23.960
talk to, but I know that this is a huge unspoken issue in the healthcare system.

08:23.960 --> 08:28.520
I'm looking for ideas from you guys in the know on who can code such an idea into reality.

08:28.520 --> 08:34.700
If my grant funding is enough, I think I could hire alice.dev to do this project.

08:34.700 --> 08:36.400
Or maybe I could do the research project myself.

08:36.400 --> 08:37.400
I have so many questions.

08:37.400 --> 08:39.040
I'd love to know your initial thoughts.

08:39.040 --> 08:40.040
Thanks for your time on the matter.

08:40.040 --> 08:47.720
P.S. long time listener since last, and I just think sincerely, Travis, what a fascinating

08:47.720 --> 08:48.720
idea.

08:48.720 --> 08:52.880
And for those of you curious, I put a link to some of the research kit information in

08:52.880 --> 08:57.160
the show notes, including the open source research kit project that Apple released a

08:57.160 --> 09:01.840
while ago, which is a framework introduced by Apple to let researchers and developers

09:01.840 --> 09:04.260
create apps for medical research.

09:04.260 --> 09:07.280
And it's called surprisingly research kit.

09:07.280 --> 09:08.960
What do you think, Mr. Dominic?

09:08.960 --> 09:11.560
I mean, that's a that's a that's a juicy email, right?

09:11.560 --> 09:16.080
Well, you know, I haven't looked at research kit quite a lot, but it's very interesting

09:16.080 --> 09:19.040
how Apple has been able to kind of leverage.

09:19.040 --> 09:24.280
There are just let's be honest, gargantuan smog, the dragon like horde of medical data

09:24.280 --> 09:28.040
to empower, frankly, researchers.

09:28.040 --> 09:32.280
I would say, man, if you can start this on your own and kind of bootstrap it, that's

09:32.280 --> 09:34.000
the way to go.

09:34.000 --> 09:36.840
See where you get it.

09:36.840 --> 09:41.080
Really having looked at the frameworks before the show today, I can say this is kind of

09:41.080 --> 09:46.320
I know we like to beat up on Apple sometimes, but given these kind of, you know, libraries

09:46.320 --> 09:49.320
and frameworks away is a huge deal.

09:49.320 --> 09:51.560
And, you know, go for it.

09:51.560 --> 09:53.520
You probably know a lot more about this than I do.

09:53.520 --> 09:55.040
So I completely agree.

09:55.040 --> 10:00.360
And Apple is always adding more sensors to that watch.

10:00.360 --> 10:01.360
You know what I mean?

10:01.360 --> 10:02.860
Like, it's just going to get better.

10:02.860 --> 10:05.520
This is just going to get more powerful.

10:05.520 --> 10:11.760
And so far, it seems like the privacy works like the way they've built this.

10:11.760 --> 10:13.580
It seems like everybody's OK with it.

10:13.580 --> 10:15.280
There hasn't been a catastrophe yet.

10:15.280 --> 10:17.360
But Travis, it's a great idea.

10:17.360 --> 10:21.540
And one of the things that I thought was interesting about your email, Travis, is I hadn't really

10:21.540 --> 10:26.320
thought about this, but of course, to somebody that's completely outside this field, you

10:26.320 --> 10:29.000
would almost think that Apple supplies the developers, right?

10:29.000 --> 10:34.560
Because it's their watch, their research kit, and they are the richest company in the world.

10:34.560 --> 10:39.200
Like, you would almost kind of just assume that Apple has developers ready to go, that

10:39.200 --> 10:43.480
you contact Apple, and then they assign a handful of developers to your project.

10:43.480 --> 10:45.520
But that's, nope, nope.

10:45.520 --> 10:46.960
You do all the work.

10:46.960 --> 10:50.400
You do all the things to make the watch super valuable.

10:50.400 --> 10:52.640
And then Apple takes 30%.

10:52.640 --> 10:54.640
That's how that works, Travis.

10:54.640 --> 10:55.640
Yeah.

10:55.640 --> 10:59.440
In this case, I think you can defend that a little better.

10:59.440 --> 11:05.080
Because just the idea, for instance, that I can monitor my heart rate, am I going AFib

11:05.080 --> 11:11.400
or anything like that, on my wrist for, what did this watch cost me, like $400 to $500?

11:11.400 --> 11:13.160
That's pretty significant, right?

11:13.160 --> 11:15.400
Just the amount of engineering that had to go into this.

11:15.400 --> 11:20.040
And the fact that it doesn't look like a potato helps, means I'll actually wear it.

11:20.040 --> 11:22.480
It also means a lot of people are getting a free Apple Watch, because a big part of

11:22.480 --> 11:27.720
these studies, because of course, you can't just limit it to Apple customers, a big part

11:27.720 --> 11:32.360
of these studies is giving out the base watch, but I mean, it's free Apple Watch for a lot

11:32.360 --> 11:33.360
of people.

11:33.360 --> 11:34.360
Yay.

11:34.360 --> 11:35.360
Apple Watch party.

11:35.360 --> 11:36.360
Yeah.

11:36.360 --> 11:37.360
Get your free Apple Watch.

11:37.360 --> 11:38.360
We're just going to monitor everything.

11:38.360 --> 11:39.360
All right.

11:39.360 --> 11:40.360
Matthew's got our last email of the day.

11:40.360 --> 11:43.480
Now, we did get a couple more emails that will be in the next episode, don't worry.

11:43.480 --> 11:47.280
And please do keep sending in your questions, coder.show slash contact.

11:47.280 --> 11:51.740
I would like to build up a bit of a backlog, just so that we have a pool to pull from.

11:51.740 --> 11:53.720
So Matthew's got our last one of the day here.

11:53.720 --> 11:59.880
He says, hey y'all, I've been looking at GitOps and other newer DevOps techniques and tooling.

11:59.880 --> 12:05.700
Curious what your thoughts are and approaches are on DevOps and or GitOps specifically.

12:05.700 --> 12:09.640
It's not as exciting as other aspects of development, but I feel it impacts developer happiness

12:09.640 --> 12:12.040
and productivity quite a lot.

12:12.040 --> 12:13.440
Thanks.

12:13.440 --> 12:17.960
And for those of you who don't know, GitOps is essentially a framework that takes DevOps

12:17.960 --> 12:23.640
best practices, which could be used for application development, such as version control, collaboration,

12:23.640 --> 12:28.760
compliance, tooling, all of that, and applies it to infrastructure automation.

12:28.760 --> 12:33.000
So taking some of the best of development practices and applying it to infrastructure

12:33.000 --> 12:34.000
management.

12:34.000 --> 12:40.000
Now, I know you have a moderate, a modest infrastructure at the Mad Botter, but I'm

12:40.000 --> 12:43.720
sure you probably thought a little bit about deploying things and keeping things manageable.

12:43.720 --> 12:45.020
What are your thoughts in this area?

12:45.020 --> 12:49.760
It's an active conversation, because as things have changed, the self-hosting model is starting

12:49.760 --> 12:51.840
to make less sense for us.

12:51.840 --> 12:53.080
Oh, tell me more.

12:53.080 --> 13:00.680
Well, it's coming down to a former sponsor keeps raising their hosting prices on me.

13:00.680 --> 13:03.880
And a certain Microsoft-owned platform called GitHub, I don't know if you've ever heard

13:03.880 --> 13:08.560
of them, they're a little indie rail shop, keeps lowering their prices.

13:08.560 --> 13:12.800
It just so happens that many of the tools and places we want to deploy to have these

13:12.800 --> 13:18.120
really neat like pre-configured GitHub actions that you could just bam, now we can deploy

13:18.120 --> 13:23.440
for the technologies that we primarily use, which would be Python and to a lesser degree

13:23.440 --> 13:25.120
Rails.

13:25.120 --> 13:32.360
So that is becoming more attractive because I did the math, actually last week, we would

13:32.360 --> 13:37.800
cut our hosting bill in half because of just the implied backups that GitHub themselves

13:37.800 --> 13:41.400
do that we're now manually doing all the time, right?

13:41.400 --> 13:42.400
Interesting.

13:42.400 --> 13:43.400
Yeah.

13:43.400 --> 13:48.960
So the question becomes, okay, our GitLab pipelines, what does moving them to GitHub

13:48.960 --> 13:50.960
look like?

13:50.960 --> 13:56.520
And for the things we care about that we currently do continuous deployment, continuous integration

13:56.520 --> 13:59.560
on, is that level of effort worth it?

13:59.560 --> 14:02.800
And I'm pretty sure the answer is just yes.

14:02.800 --> 14:06.480
So you know what?

14:06.480 --> 14:08.320
The logic here is we're small.

14:08.320 --> 14:12.200
The more we spend on hosting, the kind of the worse off we are.

14:12.200 --> 14:17.960
And also it's a big responsibility to host your own GitLab server.

14:17.960 --> 14:20.760
It's not hard, but over time, you know, there's more updates.

14:20.760 --> 14:25.520
There's just more stuff to do when GitHub is just so damn cheap now.

14:25.520 --> 14:30.360
And however you think of Microsoft, because I know some people have some feelings around

14:30.360 --> 14:36.660
this, GitHub has effectively become the de facto standard for most pieces of, you know,

14:36.660 --> 14:41.200
every ID, every deployment, every platform as a service or infrastructure as a service

14:41.200 --> 14:44.040
has a little GitHub button to just connect to.

14:44.040 --> 14:51.740
And basically does like, let's say 60% of the deployment work, which now this is good

14:51.740 --> 14:52.740
for us.

14:52.740 --> 14:53.740
We lower our costs.

14:53.740 --> 14:57.280
It's also good for our customers because, you know, they're not paying us for a time

14:57.280 --> 15:00.860
that we don't need to be doing hand deployments in those cases.

15:00.860 --> 15:05.040
So I'd say ongoing conversation is the right way to put it here too.

15:05.040 --> 15:11.000
First of all, we're rebuilding our website and the entire website workflow, we are moving

15:11.000 --> 15:14.040
to essentially GitHub and GitHub actions.

15:14.040 --> 15:19.440
So when you want to update a page at jupyterbroadcasting.net, which is our current development site, you

15:19.440 --> 15:23.880
go modify a page on GitHub, you check it in and, you know, you make all your changes and

15:23.880 --> 15:29.360
then a GitHub action runs and actually renders that static website and redeploys it.

15:29.360 --> 15:34.600
We're kind of thinking about that too from a Nix OS standpoint, because as time goes

15:34.600 --> 15:39.680
on, we've built out more and more infrastructure as we've leaned more and more into self hosting.

15:39.680 --> 15:43.900
And now we kind of have a mix of CentOS.

15:43.900 --> 15:45.840
We have Ubuntu, of course.

15:45.840 --> 15:48.820
We have several different versions of Ubuntu.

15:48.820 --> 15:50.320
We have some SUSE in there.

15:50.320 --> 15:51.320
Wait, wait, wait.

15:51.320 --> 15:52.320
What was that last one?

15:52.320 --> 15:53.320
Some Lizard OS.

15:53.320 --> 15:54.320
I've never heard of it before.

15:54.320 --> 15:55.320
Lizard people arise.

15:55.320 --> 15:56.320
Yeah.

15:56.320 --> 15:57.320
F Atlantis.

15:57.320 --> 16:02.920
And it's like, OK, this is getting a little bit ridiculous because some systems we have

16:02.920 --> 16:03.920
a we have a standard.

16:03.920 --> 16:07.040
So like all the SSH keys are on there and all the accounts are created.

16:07.040 --> 16:10.720
Everybody has the right UIDs and all that kind of stuff and other systems we have nothing

16:10.720 --> 16:11.720
like that.

16:11.720 --> 16:16.120
And it's just like, oh, this is the box where we don't have any of those standards.

16:16.120 --> 16:17.840
Can anybody help me get logged into this box?

16:17.840 --> 16:21.360
It's got to wait 15 minutes so that the one person who does have a log in can get you

16:21.360 --> 16:22.360
in.

16:22.360 --> 16:23.760
And that kind of like no more of that.

16:23.760 --> 16:24.760
Right.

16:24.760 --> 16:28.000
You know, Jimbo's on the toilet so nobody can get their stuff because the only guy who

16:28.000 --> 16:30.200
is SSH key is actually on the box.

16:30.200 --> 16:34.800
Or you can have a situation where it's like the one day a year where I am completely AFK

16:34.800 --> 16:38.560
or Wes is completely AFK and it's like, oh, well, now this thing doesn't work like.

16:38.560 --> 16:41.200
It's like, OK, we can't do that anymore.

16:41.200 --> 16:45.720
And the nice thing I like about Nix is that it's all defined in a configuration file.

16:45.720 --> 16:47.080
It's really powerful that way.

16:47.080 --> 16:49.400
And that configuration file, of course, you can check in to get.

16:49.400 --> 16:54.200
And so you can actually track your changes via get to your OS level configuration and

16:54.200 --> 16:55.200
deployments.

16:55.200 --> 16:56.600
And that seems super powerful to me.

16:56.600 --> 16:57.600
Yeah.

16:57.600 --> 16:58.600
You should also explain, right?

16:58.600 --> 16:59.960
Nix is basically a CI tool.

16:59.960 --> 17:00.960
Yeah.

17:00.960 --> 17:01.960
For OS.

17:01.960 --> 17:05.320
It's applied to an OS and that is fantastic.

17:05.320 --> 17:06.320
I love that.

17:06.320 --> 17:07.320
Right.

17:07.320 --> 17:11.680
I mean, the big thing about get ops in general, even away from GitHub or GitLab is kind of

17:11.680 --> 17:15.280
pushes it super hard to the only your source of truth.

17:15.280 --> 17:16.280
Right.

17:16.280 --> 17:18.000
The thing you trust is that remote Git repo.

17:18.000 --> 17:19.000
So origin.

17:19.000 --> 17:20.000
Right.

17:20.000 --> 17:24.560
So your your main branch or whatever it is, very much like an extension of I don't know

17:24.560 --> 17:26.760
if this is a popular thing people blog about anymore.

17:26.760 --> 17:27.760
But get flow.

17:27.760 --> 17:28.760
Are you familiar with that, Chris?

17:28.760 --> 17:29.760
Get flow.

17:29.760 --> 17:30.760
Get flow.

17:30.760 --> 17:31.760
It rings a bell.

17:31.760 --> 17:32.760
Yeah.

17:32.760 --> 17:36.640
It's like a methodology for naming and branching and tagging releases where basic I mean, there's

17:36.640 --> 17:39.780
all everybody has their own little snowflake version of it.

17:39.780 --> 17:46.640
But basically, like your main branch is usually production, then you'll have like, you know,

17:46.640 --> 17:52.840
staging, customer facing staging, internal dev, where literally the code flows up.

17:52.840 --> 17:56.760
And it's always you always have a way to go back, right?

17:56.760 --> 17:57.760
And people get fancy.

17:57.760 --> 18:00.440
They like to depends on what kind of thing you're doing, right?

18:00.440 --> 18:03.720
If you're doing binaries, you can actually like tag versions that are like the build

18:03.720 --> 18:04.720
binary.

18:04.720 --> 18:09.320
And again, if you're on GitHub, you can literally just put the binary on your page if it's something

18:09.320 --> 18:11.680
you're giving away for free and be like, here, just download the binary.

18:11.680 --> 18:12.680
Don't bother me.

18:12.680 --> 18:16.600
Oh, and then CodePilot can use your code to suggest insane things.

18:16.600 --> 18:18.040
Just quick CodePilot diversion.

18:18.040 --> 18:20.560
I got it to do something crazy today.

18:20.560 --> 18:21.560
Tell me about it.

18:21.560 --> 18:24.260
So I'm mixing C++ and Rust in a Python project.

18:24.260 --> 18:25.260
It's called Alice.

18:25.260 --> 18:26.380
I don't know if you've ever heard of it.

18:26.380 --> 18:31.160
And apparently because I wanted to just try something and I did like the inline consume

18:31.160 --> 18:37.040
this as C++ thing, I saw the little, you know, in VS code, like you see the little dude with

18:37.040 --> 18:39.440
his goggles on the bottom, right?

18:39.440 --> 18:40.600
I think his head spun.

18:40.600 --> 18:46.160
He was like, what the heck is this madness?

18:46.160 --> 18:50.720
So then it started suggesting really weird, what I think is game dev C++ to me.

18:50.720 --> 18:52.620
Oh, you're getting the game dev stuff now?

18:52.620 --> 18:53.760
I don't know what happened.

18:53.760 --> 18:55.400
It was like, it is not a game, right?

18:55.400 --> 19:00.280
It was just, I wanted to speed something up that's taking too long and it just, yeah.

19:00.280 --> 19:02.780
Watch out, you might get a little Carmack in there.

19:02.780 --> 19:04.680
And I paid for it for a year.

19:04.680 --> 19:07.400
Well then, I look forward to future updates.

19:07.400 --> 19:09.280
I'll tell you what.

19:09.280 --> 19:13.000
It's like my hilarious companion that I turn off because it keeps suggesting stupid things

19:13.000 --> 19:14.000
to me.

19:14.000 --> 19:15.000
All right.

19:15.000 --> 19:17.980
Speaking of things that aren't stupid, the London meetup is nigh.

19:17.980 --> 19:20.960
It is just a few days away as this episode will come out.

19:20.960 --> 19:23.440
It is Friday, August 5th in London.

19:23.440 --> 19:26.120
Details at meetup.com slash Jupiter broadcasting.

19:26.120 --> 19:29.360
And of course, over there, we also have the West Coast meetups posted.

19:29.360 --> 19:31.560
All that is coming up soon.

19:31.560 --> 19:35.620
And my last thing I'll just say about this, so we don't go on and on, is that if you are

19:35.620 --> 19:40.660
on the West Coast, we could use some location experts for our meetups.

19:40.660 --> 19:46.420
And we have a matrix room dedicated to just the West Coast, and that is at bit.ly slash

19:46.420 --> 19:50.720
West Coast crew.

19:50.720 --> 19:56.320
Linode dot com slash coder, go there to get $100 in 60 day credit on a new account, and

19:56.320 --> 19:57.600
you go there to support the show.

19:57.600 --> 19:59.740
It's a great way to support the show.

19:59.740 --> 20:00.740
What is Linode?

20:00.740 --> 20:03.800
Fast, reliable, cloud hosting.

20:03.800 --> 20:04.880
You just got to go try it.

20:04.880 --> 20:08.400
That's why you're going to get a hundred bucks and you're going to go kick the tires yourself.

20:08.400 --> 20:13.280
Linode is always improving the infrastructure, they've got 11 data centers around the world,

20:13.280 --> 20:16.600
and they've always been reinvesting in that infrastructure, staying ahead of all of the

20:16.600 --> 20:18.200
other cloud providers.

20:18.200 --> 20:19.920
And you can measure it.

20:19.920 --> 20:22.140
You can benchmark the systems and you can see it.

20:22.140 --> 20:27.320
I have tried the various different hyperscalers out there and Linode competitors, and Linode

20:27.320 --> 20:29.740
is always above the rest.

20:29.740 --> 20:31.840
They own their own internet links.

20:31.840 --> 20:33.660
They're constantly upgrading their hardware.

20:33.660 --> 20:38.360
They've been refining this for nearly 19 years to build the best experience to run applications

20:38.360 --> 20:40.720
on Linux in the cloud.

20:40.720 --> 20:42.240
You got to go try it for your next project.

20:42.240 --> 20:43.240
I mean it.

20:43.240 --> 20:44.940
You really have to see what they can do.

20:44.940 --> 20:48.080
And of course, Linode is about investing in the community.

20:48.080 --> 20:49.080
They were just at scale.

20:49.080 --> 20:52.520
I heard from a lot of you out there that got to see Linode and got some cool Linode swag

20:52.520 --> 20:57.120
at scale, and they're making our West Coast road trip possible this year.

20:57.120 --> 21:02.540
So we can do meetups all up and down the West Coast and get down to JPL and have that tour.

21:02.540 --> 21:06.240
Linode invests in the community because they're part of the Linux community.

21:06.240 --> 21:07.520
They've been around forever.

21:07.520 --> 21:10.860
That's how I found them originally, was at a Linux fest.

21:10.860 --> 21:15.820
And now I use them for everything we deploy that our staff needs to use, our team, but

21:15.820 --> 21:18.600
also our community, anything customer facing.

21:18.600 --> 21:19.600
It's on Linode.

21:19.600 --> 21:22.080
They have better pricing than the major hyperscalers out there.

21:22.080 --> 21:27.160
They have a better interface, better documentation, and leagues better support.

21:27.160 --> 21:30.440
Whole different category.

21:30.440 --> 21:32.240
Nobody else touches Linode on the support.

21:32.240 --> 21:34.560
And when that matters, it really matters.

21:34.560 --> 21:35.920
So go try it.

21:35.920 --> 21:36.920
Go see what you can do.

21:36.920 --> 21:37.920
Go build something.

21:37.920 --> 21:38.920
Go learn something.

21:38.920 --> 21:39.920
Go do a one click deployment.

21:39.920 --> 21:42.960
Just go get that hundred bucks and support the show.

21:42.960 --> 21:44.740
Linode.com slash coder.

21:44.740 --> 21:45.800
That's where you go to sign up.

21:45.800 --> 21:46.800
Try it out.

21:46.800 --> 21:49.000
Join the show and get a hundred bucks.

21:49.000 --> 21:53.800
Linode.com slash coder.

21:53.800 --> 21:54.800
All right.

21:54.800 --> 22:01.120
Let's get a little spicy with Clojure here because apparently Clojure has a hole and

22:01.120 --> 22:03.160
it's a rails shaped hole.

22:03.160 --> 22:06.200
There's a hole in the Clojure tonight.

22:06.200 --> 22:07.200
Yeah.

22:07.200 --> 22:11.880
There's a compiler error of fear and sorrow.

22:11.880 --> 22:17.640
Clojure developers are just staring down a foggy railway, just lost.

22:17.640 --> 22:22.560
They're in a 90s Soul Asylum video, like wandering children down a runaway train.

22:22.560 --> 22:24.360
With that weird filter on it.

22:24.360 --> 22:26.680
Is that black and white or is it just muted colors?

22:26.680 --> 22:27.680
I can't quite tell.

22:27.680 --> 22:28.920
It was VH1.

22:28.920 --> 22:29.920
Thank you very much.

22:29.920 --> 22:30.920
Everything had a filter.

22:30.920 --> 22:33.520
Or no, that was MTV, wasn't it?

22:33.520 --> 22:34.520
Yeah.

22:34.520 --> 22:35.520
So Clojure.

22:35.520 --> 22:36.760
I don't know if you've ever heard of this language.

22:36.760 --> 22:38.320
I have some weirdos like it.

22:38.320 --> 22:39.320
Wes was so dog.

22:39.320 --> 22:40.320
Yeah.

22:40.320 --> 22:41.320
Some people I know.

22:41.320 --> 22:42.320
Some guy.

22:42.320 --> 22:43.320
Whatever.

22:43.320 --> 22:44.320
He's always challenging me with weird languages.

22:44.320 --> 22:45.400
That was a lot of fun.

22:45.400 --> 22:49.520
You should listen back if you never had the, what was it like seven months for Wes tortured

22:49.520 --> 22:52.960
me with weird programming languages that weren't Objective C.

22:52.960 --> 22:55.040
It turns out if you try hard enough, you can.

22:55.040 --> 22:57.360
There he is.

22:57.360 --> 23:02.960
So yeah, Clojure has a problem according to the author of this post, Janet Carr.

23:02.960 --> 23:05.160
And I tend to agree with her.

23:05.160 --> 23:07.680
You know, Ruby was kind of obscure until Rails came out.

23:07.680 --> 23:09.280
Thank you DHH.

23:09.280 --> 23:13.760
Clojure does not have a Rails and it has a weird succession of potential web development

23:13.760 --> 23:19.200
frameworks and suitors for this kind of application.

23:19.200 --> 23:24.120
But no one has come out on top, which I will never repeat this in front of Wes, is a damn

23:24.120 --> 23:27.080
shame because Clojure has got some really interesting ideas in it.

23:27.080 --> 23:28.080
Yeah.

23:28.080 --> 23:32.840
Now is the idea maybe with Clojure that you're not supposed to need something like Rails,

23:32.840 --> 23:37.820
that they're going to solve this stuff lower level, you build what you need on top of that.

23:37.820 --> 23:39.640
And you know, you don't need a Rails with Clojure.

23:39.640 --> 23:41.520
There's two ways to look at it.

23:41.520 --> 23:44.560
Like what do we mean when we say a Rails for Clojure?

23:44.560 --> 23:46.120
The way you read that is exactly correct.

23:46.120 --> 23:50.280
It's you know, something super abstract, high level that's easy and quick for development

23:50.280 --> 23:53.800
and you know, people can get into the language a lot easier.

23:53.800 --> 23:56.880
Or you could say, no, it's not the style of Rails.

23:56.880 --> 24:01.400
It's just like a de facto standard, which for a long time Rails was and in my opinion

24:01.400 --> 24:02.400
still is for Ruby.

24:02.400 --> 24:06.360
Because when you have a standard, right, when there's a de facto standard framework, what

24:06.360 --> 24:13.120
happens is all, many, not all, but most of the library developers keep that framework

24:13.120 --> 24:17.120
in mind, compatibility and convenience for that framework in mind when they develop their

24:17.120 --> 24:22.560
library such that again, just like the Ruby ecosystem, the ecosystem ends up coagulating

24:22.560 --> 24:28.000
around that framework and it's usually pretty easy to pull in any gem and make it work with

24:28.000 --> 24:29.000
your Rails app.

24:29.000 --> 24:30.720
Yeah, there's no denying that.

24:30.720 --> 24:33.960
And you've seen the ecosystem around that.

24:33.960 --> 24:40.280
You know, I think if you were to get Wes drunk, maybe one late night and you got him going

24:40.280 --> 24:44.080
about closure, I think he'd probably talk about luminous, I think is how you say it,

24:44.080 --> 24:47.960
which kind of promises to be the missing Rails.

24:47.960 --> 24:50.240
But how could anything be Rails at this point?

24:50.240 --> 24:51.240
Nothing.

24:51.240 --> 24:53.320
Like when you say Rails, what are you really saying?

24:53.320 --> 24:57.640
Are you just trying to like invoke like an idea or are you actually trying to say you're

24:57.640 --> 25:00.160
going to compete with everything that Rails does now?

25:00.160 --> 25:03.760
Yeah, I would also argue, right, like with TurboLinks and some of, in fact, we should

25:03.760 --> 25:08.040
probably revisit Rails, it's been a long time, but with some of the TurboLinks stuff, I mean,

25:08.040 --> 25:11.000
if you look at the Hey app, it's crazy.

25:11.000 --> 25:13.520
Rails is so different from what Rails used to be.

25:13.520 --> 25:17.320
If you're using some of the newer hotness, like it would be very interesting to take

25:17.320 --> 25:23.040
like a Rails 3 and a Rails 7 kind of the best practices and development methodologies, particularly

25:23.040 --> 25:28.280
for a full stack website and say, yeah, this is kind of different and all hell active record

25:28.280 --> 25:30.800
still better than SQL Alchemy.

25:30.800 --> 25:34.680
Well, I'll drop a couple of links in the show notes.

25:34.680 --> 25:37.480
I feel like, you know, one of these days, what we've got to do is track down that Wes

25:37.480 --> 25:41.040
Payne and get him on here and get him to explain himself how he could still defend something

25:41.040 --> 25:42.040
like this.

25:42.040 --> 25:44.280
I'm going to challenge Wes Payne.

25:44.280 --> 25:50.960
Wes, if you're listening, you pick a language and I'll pick a language and we'll do a challenge.

25:50.960 --> 25:58.080
But this challenge, we have to build a tiny, tiny app that pulls some Jupyter broadcasting

25:58.080 --> 26:02.840
public GitHub page, maybe for the website and just like looks at the commits or something.

26:02.840 --> 26:04.120
We'll think about it.

26:04.120 --> 26:05.120
I like it.

26:05.120 --> 26:06.840
Yes, it is hammer time.

26:06.840 --> 26:10.040
I think that soundboard clip is consent, right?

26:10.040 --> 26:11.960
I think that's implied consent right there.

26:11.960 --> 26:14.920
So you've been hanging out with Dick Cheney again, huh?

26:14.920 --> 26:17.320
Or that's a little more Harvey Weinstein, let's be honest.

26:17.320 --> 26:18.320
Yeah, right.

26:18.320 --> 26:21.560
No, when I go duck hunting, I'll let you know.

26:21.560 --> 26:26.720
I know that you had a little bit of a skirmish this weekend.

26:26.720 --> 26:30.400
And I'm it's kind of I feel like you're out there doing some field testing for the show.

26:30.400 --> 26:33.840
And now you can report back on the great migration.

26:33.840 --> 26:42.500
I got a little bit of let's say sass, but a little, you know, Apple guy saying, why

26:42.500 --> 26:44.320
do you pay for machines all the time?

26:44.320 --> 26:45.840
You know, you get a new machine.

26:45.840 --> 26:47.100
You don't need to do that.

26:47.100 --> 26:49.180
Use migration system is flawless.

26:49.180 --> 26:52.780
So do you normally when you get a new laptop, it's like, OK, so walk me through.

26:52.780 --> 26:57.680
So you spill your drink, you get rid of your laptop, you buy a brand new machine just coincidentally

26:57.680 --> 26:59.400
as a new hardware lands.

26:59.400 --> 27:01.000
And then do you start from a fresh install?

27:01.000 --> 27:04.320
Well, if we're going to start from the beginning, first, I dance around Buffalo Bill style.

27:04.320 --> 27:05.320
OK, good, good.

27:05.320 --> 27:06.600
I'm glad we know that now.

27:06.600 --> 27:07.600
Good.

27:07.600 --> 27:12.120
Then I inevitably drop the laptop in a pit with a small poodle of some sort.

27:12.120 --> 27:13.120
Oops.

27:13.120 --> 27:14.120
Oops.

27:14.120 --> 27:16.560
But I have never actually used migration assistant before.

27:16.560 --> 27:22.720
So my usual process is I get pull my damn bash RC that I always forget is seashell now.

27:22.720 --> 27:27.960
So I have to edit it every single time and I still haven't pushed it up for some reason.

27:27.960 --> 27:31.440
And yeah, that's just Mike being lazy.

27:31.440 --> 27:33.640
And I you know, you know the drill, right?

27:33.640 --> 27:36.700
You got to install Xcode, the command line tools.

27:36.700 --> 27:40.180
Then you realize you don't have the headers for Postgres or something.

27:40.180 --> 27:44.880
It's both tedious, but at the same time, it's like you're only building back what you need

27:44.880 --> 27:47.780
and you're going with the freshest versions of everything.

27:47.780 --> 27:51.200
And maybe this is the build where you try a different video player or something.

27:51.200 --> 27:52.200
Right.

27:52.200 --> 27:54.480
So the disadvantage is to not just copying whole hog.

27:54.480 --> 27:58.600
But the disadvantage is really that Xcode step because it's just awful.

27:58.600 --> 28:00.380
It's just slow and terrible.

28:00.380 --> 28:05.240
So you know, I was getting some flack about this that it's flawless and it even works

28:05.240 --> 28:07.180
across ARM and Intel.

28:07.180 --> 28:08.560
That's pretty impressive.

28:08.560 --> 28:09.560
Cross architectures.

28:09.560 --> 28:10.560
Damn.

28:10.560 --> 28:11.560
Yes.

28:11.560 --> 28:12.560
Lies are often impressive.

28:12.560 --> 28:13.560
Yes.

28:13.560 --> 28:16.380
I feel like I have a couple of bridges to sell you.

28:16.380 --> 28:20.600
So it did appear to work and it did take like an hour and a half.

28:20.600 --> 28:24.520
But it very foolishly and I don't understand why they don't do this because they could

28:24.520 --> 28:27.800
certainly add this to the program because you have to actually launch like a little

28:27.800 --> 28:34.720
migration assistant application where it's like, hey, buddy, that's a different CPU architecture.

28:34.720 --> 28:37.560
So no.

28:37.560 --> 28:41.920
Or we're not going to copy over your homebrew stuff or your command line stuff and leave

28:41.920 --> 28:46.720
you leave your system in this insane state where you couldn't totally like chill and

28:46.720 --> 28:47.720
so forth.

28:47.720 --> 28:50.060
Like if you just like chill in the gooey, you're probably fine.

28:50.060 --> 28:54.200
The minute you open terminal, it's just going to scream in agony.

28:54.200 --> 28:55.200
Yeah.

28:55.200 --> 28:57.800
So it sounds like it would move some things, but not other things.

28:57.800 --> 28:59.320
And it would just be a total hodgepodge.

28:59.320 --> 29:04.480
Well, it's not just that it does move them and it moves most of them, but it doesn't

29:04.480 --> 29:08.600
check what architecture your stuff is compiled for.

29:08.600 --> 29:14.920
And like really common stuff like homebrew homebrew, fun fact, saves in a different location

29:14.920 --> 29:17.080
on ARM CPU machines.

29:17.080 --> 29:22.480
It saves it's like slash ops homebrew where I might get this wrong, but it's like slash

29:22.480 --> 29:27.000
library slash something on Intel.

29:27.000 --> 29:28.000
It's user local bin.

29:28.000 --> 29:33.200
So you're telling me the migration tool that Apple ships in the most recent versions of

29:33.200 --> 29:39.440
Mac OS, which support both Intel and ARM, doesn't differentiate on that stuff.

29:39.440 --> 29:40.980
What is ARM code?

29:40.980 --> 29:46.000
Even though you can get info and it's in the metadata of the application, it's in the metadata

29:46.000 --> 29:48.080
right there available to the system.

29:48.080 --> 29:49.080
Right.

29:49.080 --> 29:51.160
And I'm not suggesting it should do like program by program.

29:51.160 --> 29:52.160
I'm suggesting.

29:52.160 --> 29:53.160
Oh, I am.

29:53.160 --> 29:54.160
Don't you think, dude?

29:54.160 --> 29:55.160
Oh, don't you think?

29:55.160 --> 29:59.520
I feel like once you plug a machine of the other architecture into the, you know, other

29:59.520 --> 30:02.920
architecture, it should be like, hey, man, just there should be like a warning, right?

30:02.920 --> 30:05.220
Hey, man, this is going to be wild.

30:05.220 --> 30:08.400
Or like, hey, would you like to do just the universal applications?

30:08.400 --> 30:12.040
Which by the way, that means you don't get these three app for applications and these,

30:12.040 --> 30:13.040
you know, whatever.

30:13.040 --> 30:17.840
Or, you know, like would you like to bring over the Intel stuff because like you're crapping

30:17.840 --> 30:22.240
up basically a brand new Mac with a ton of stuff that's going to have to run under Rosetta.

30:22.240 --> 30:25.360
Well, this is not a brand new Mac, but yeah, but you get my point, right?

30:25.360 --> 30:27.880
Somebody bought a new M2 or whatever, sits down.

30:27.880 --> 30:28.880
Yeah.

30:28.880 --> 30:29.880
So you get screwed both ways.

30:29.880 --> 30:35.420
If you go Intel to ARM, you unnecessarily run everything in Rosetta, which is dumb.

30:35.420 --> 30:40.320
But if you go, what I did is I went ARM to Intel and it just copies ARM binaries over

30:40.320 --> 30:42.440
and they're just busted.

30:42.440 --> 30:44.120
I can't even believe this.

30:44.120 --> 30:50.000
Like, I mean, this sounds like something out of a beta tool, like an alpha tool that just

30:50.000 --> 30:54.440
hasn't been like updated by the community for the new architecture support.

30:54.440 --> 30:57.760
Not from like the manufacturer of the OS and the hardware.

30:57.760 --> 30:58.760
It was pretty bad.

30:58.760 --> 31:02.520
I spent about an hour trying to hammer out like these insane terminal errors.

31:02.520 --> 31:04.660
And then I'm like, you know what?

31:04.660 --> 31:07.400
System preferences, erase all settings and content.

31:07.400 --> 31:13.120
And I just did it, I paved it by hand and I did the, you know, my normal set up process.

31:13.120 --> 31:14.360
Oh, man.

31:14.360 --> 31:15.360
It's so funny, right?

31:15.360 --> 31:19.600
Because we're in this state where the M1 and the M2 hardware, it's just some of the best

31:19.600 --> 31:20.600
hardware out there.

31:20.600 --> 31:23.200
It really is in terms of power and performance.

31:23.200 --> 31:33.880
I just had my first experience with some really advanced, very expensive audio repair plugins.

31:33.880 --> 31:41.080
And they've always been single threaded on x86 machines and on Intel Macs, you know,

31:41.080 --> 31:43.720
but on like Linux under wine, just anywhere we've used it.

31:43.720 --> 31:50.000
And it just takes forever, like an hour long track just would take at least an hour to

31:50.000 --> 31:51.000
render and process.

31:51.000 --> 31:54.200
When you're trying to edit, that's just brutal.

31:54.200 --> 31:58.160
And this weekend I was helping out a friend and I was like, well, I'll try this.

31:58.160 --> 32:03.160
I've got this on this Mac, I'll try it here on this, on the, you know, the MacBook Pro

32:03.160 --> 32:06.520
with the Ultra M1 Ultra in it.

32:06.520 --> 32:15.760
And when it lit up all the cores and it did an hour long audio in, I don't know, 20 seconds,

32:15.760 --> 32:22.360
it was the first time I saw that, that like huge leap in something that I have used for

32:22.360 --> 32:25.880
a decade that's always taken like basically it's a one to one ratio.

32:25.880 --> 32:29.560
Whatever the length of the file I was rendering out was, you know, that was just how long

32:29.560 --> 32:30.720
I was going to wait.

32:30.720 --> 32:33.600
You know, for the first time ever, I saw it.

32:33.600 --> 32:38.580
And the great thing about it was, is this was in a pinch on the go.

32:38.580 --> 32:41.980
And you know, I only had like 20% battery left because I hadn't had the machine plugged

32:41.980 --> 32:43.740
in for like a week.

32:43.740 --> 32:46.600
And it used like 2% battery to do all of that.

32:46.600 --> 32:48.640
And that was a that was like, wow, that's great.

32:48.640 --> 32:49.640
That is really great.

32:49.640 --> 32:58.920
But I have to say, I remain unenthused with Mac OS, like the amount of tweaking here and

32:58.920 --> 33:03.480
there and little tool that does like this one or two things that cost me at least five

33:03.480 --> 33:10.120
or 10 bucks and all that little stuff you got to do to make Mac OS a fully functional

33:10.120 --> 33:11.120
workstation.

33:11.120 --> 33:15.700
If you're honest with yourself, it's more work than setting up the plasma desktop or

33:15.700 --> 33:17.080
the GNOME desktop.

33:17.080 --> 33:22.600
So on the OS side, or just like this kind of stuff, the migration stuff, that isn't

33:22.600 --> 33:24.280
a premium experience.

33:24.280 --> 33:29.200
You're buying a premium machine, supposedly has a custom OS built by the hardware vendor,

33:29.200 --> 33:33.760
yet the migration assistant seems to be clueless about the architecture of the applications.

33:33.760 --> 33:35.040
That's actually hilarious.

33:35.040 --> 33:37.920
That's that's a worse experience than you get on the free desktop.

33:37.920 --> 33:39.720
Like that kind of stuff.

33:39.720 --> 33:40.720
That drives me crazy.

33:40.720 --> 33:46.700
But another area that I find sort of user hostile is Apple remains still completely

33:46.700 --> 33:52.440
insufficient in the tools that they give their end users to manage their file system and

33:52.440 --> 33:53.440
their data.

33:53.440 --> 33:58.320
And when you have photos and you have your Xcode projects on there or your media library

33:58.320 --> 34:02.280
projects, that stuff is priceless.

34:02.280 --> 34:09.560
And APFS has capabilities and tools that are not exposed to the end user in any meaningful

34:09.560 --> 34:11.280
way at all.

34:11.280 --> 34:16.360
And I just find it completely just unacceptable because Apple of the past went out of their

34:16.360 --> 34:21.080
way to integrate this ridiculous time machine effect where you could go to any folder on

34:21.080 --> 34:25.360
your Mac and you get a stupid button and you go into a stupid space effect and then you

34:25.360 --> 34:27.400
could fly through time.

34:27.400 --> 34:30.600
But it visually made sense to restore data.

34:30.600 --> 34:34.920
And now Apple has built in snapshot capabilities into the file system and they don't expose

34:34.920 --> 34:39.020
any of that stuff to the user time machine remains barely adequate at best.

34:39.020 --> 34:44.020
And Mac OS requires tons of little utilities and fixes to make it actually usable.

34:44.020 --> 34:47.560
So it's like the hardware has just completely outstretched the software.

34:47.560 --> 34:52.600
I don't know if you saw this, but the latest Linux kernel was just released this weekend

34:52.600 --> 34:54.120
right on time.

34:54.120 --> 35:00.080
And Linus announced that this was the first Linux kernel that's ever been released from

35:00.080 --> 35:01.280
an ARM Mac.

35:01.280 --> 35:05.000
He's running Asahi Linux now on his ARM Mac.

35:05.000 --> 35:09.520
And that's Linus's setup now to run Linux.

35:09.520 --> 35:11.600
I don't know if it's a MacBook Air, probably.

35:11.600 --> 35:13.560
That seems to be his favorite machine or what.

35:13.560 --> 35:22.280
But Linus Torvalds is using Apple hardware and he just released 5.19 from an ARM 64 machine

35:22.280 --> 35:25.480
and he felt like it was worth noting in the release announcement.

35:25.480 --> 35:26.800
I mean, that's beautiful.

35:26.800 --> 35:34.320
I think that's, yeah, Reddit must be aflame.

35:34.320 --> 35:36.280
Tailscale.com slash coder.

35:36.280 --> 35:39.520
Go there to get a free personal account for up to 20 devices.

35:39.520 --> 35:43.880
And of course, you support the show when you go to tailscale.com slash coder.

35:43.880 --> 35:45.040
Come here, traveler.

35:45.040 --> 35:49.840
Let me give you a secret weapon that will help you on your travels because Tailscale

35:49.840 --> 35:54.520
is that zero config VPN you have been looking for.

35:54.520 --> 35:57.060
It installs on any device in minutes.

35:57.060 --> 35:58.560
It manages firewall rules.

35:58.560 --> 36:00.120
It handles that double net situation.

36:00.120 --> 36:05.380
If you're in that situation, you can quickly and easily create a flat network protected

36:05.380 --> 36:07.880
by WireGuard's noise protocol.

36:07.880 --> 36:12.240
That whatever desktop OS you're on, you can get tools to manage that super simply.

36:12.240 --> 36:15.960
Plus it has a great command line that also makes it really easy to bring things up and

36:15.960 --> 36:17.100
down.

36:17.100 --> 36:20.880
If you've got five devices, you can probably get everything online in five minutes.

36:20.880 --> 36:22.000
It's that easy.

36:22.000 --> 36:23.880
I've got it on my Raspberry Pis.

36:23.880 --> 36:25.160
I've got it on my mobile devices.

36:25.160 --> 36:26.680
I've got it on my x86 boxes.

36:26.680 --> 36:28.120
I've got it on my family's computers.

36:28.120 --> 36:29.360
I've got it on my virtual machines.

36:29.360 --> 36:31.160
I've got it on my VPS's.

36:31.160 --> 36:35.640
It brings everything together into one flat network and then I get static IPs.

36:35.640 --> 36:39.840
So now I've got a static IP for the devices I use the most often for those web dashboards

36:39.840 --> 36:43.880
I need to get access to or those machines I need to SSH into or that box I got a remote

36:43.880 --> 36:45.400
desktop to.

36:45.400 --> 36:51.100
It's all one flat network now and it's changed everything for me and it literally made the

36:51.100 --> 36:54.200
show possible while I was traveling a few months ago.

36:54.200 --> 36:58.900
And one of the best parts about it is that it handles that mobile NAT that you get when

36:58.900 --> 37:03.020
you're on like a cell phone connection which can really screw things up for certain types

37:03.020 --> 37:06.160
of applications just intelligently handles that.

37:06.160 --> 37:10.800
It also just brilliantly handles the routing so your data doesn't get sent to the wrong

37:10.800 --> 37:15.560
area like you know some VPN's might route everything through the VPN connection.

37:15.560 --> 37:17.820
Tailscale don't do that.

37:17.820 --> 37:21.440
They're always always intelligent about the way they handle the traffic.

37:21.440 --> 37:22.440
Just love that.

37:22.440 --> 37:23.440
And why?

37:23.440 --> 37:24.440
Why I love it?

37:24.440 --> 37:25.440
Because I can leave it on.

37:25.440 --> 37:27.480
That means I can always leave tailscale connected.

37:27.480 --> 37:32.720
So that means that mesh wire guard protected network is always available to me.

37:32.720 --> 37:35.380
And they can sign in through your existing identity provider.

37:35.380 --> 37:38.560
So if you're a small business or something you know if you got or maybe it's like maybe

37:38.560 --> 37:42.480
you just like to do things through a single sign on you want to have some two factor authentication.

37:42.480 --> 37:44.000
I don't know what you do.

37:44.000 --> 37:45.440
Tailscale will support that too.

37:45.440 --> 37:46.700
So go try it out.

37:46.700 --> 37:51.180
Go get the always on VPN that really works with GUI's for the platforms you use.

37:51.180 --> 37:54.240
Super DNS friendly and dead simple to set up.

37:54.240 --> 37:57.620
Those are just some of the reasons I use tailscale every single day.

37:57.620 --> 38:03.640
So try it now for yourself for free up to 20 devices at tailscale.com slash coder.

38:03.640 --> 38:08.400
That's tailscale.com slash coder.

38:08.400 --> 38:09.400
All right.

38:09.400 --> 38:14.740
Apparently we have the secrets to become a successful software engineer.

38:14.740 --> 38:17.520
Are you we are we sure we want to just give it away for free.

38:17.520 --> 38:20.480
I mean maybe we should like have some sort of online course they have to sign up for

38:20.480 --> 38:21.480
us.

38:21.480 --> 38:23.920
Manning Press isn't giving it away for free ever.

38:23.920 --> 38:24.920
It's against the rules.

38:24.920 --> 38:25.920
Oh no.

38:25.920 --> 38:31.600
So you know we always get the hey I'm starting out emails you know what should I look into

38:31.600 --> 38:33.840
any books any courses.

38:33.840 --> 38:35.760
And because I'm an old man I love books.

38:35.760 --> 38:40.840
I don't particularly care for video courses.

38:40.840 --> 38:47.040
So I used to and still do recommend Mike underlies coder to developer but that it's a great book.

38:47.040 --> 38:48.300
I think you should read it.

38:48.300 --> 38:50.440
It's also super dated.

38:50.440 --> 38:55.920
There's some stuff in there that that will seem somewhat comical given the way one the

38:55.920 --> 39:01.200
world has changed but remote work and to just the types of technologies that the vast majority

39:01.200 --> 39:06.120
of you are probably interested in but still full of good advice.

39:06.120 --> 39:14.400
However however many press unashamed goes for the mantle with Fernando D'Alio.

39:14.400 --> 39:15.400
I hope I said that right.

39:15.400 --> 39:20.240
I don't know if he's Italian but I gave it the Italian G.L. thing anyway.

39:20.240 --> 39:22.680
So hopefully I said that right.

39:22.680 --> 39:27.120
Fernando published skills of a successful software engineer which weirdly had another

39:27.120 --> 39:29.720
title at some point too.

39:29.720 --> 39:36.680
It is like coder to developer but written after you know within the last five years.

39:36.680 --> 39:37.680
OK.

39:37.680 --> 39:38.680
Super good.

39:38.680 --> 39:44.340
A lot of good advice doesn't focus on any particular technologies or languages but it

39:44.340 --> 39:49.800
covers things like TV a lot about how to successfully work remotely particularly 100 percent remote

39:49.800 --> 39:55.680
which I think a lot of people should probably read and kind of the basics of like you know

39:55.680 --> 40:02.160
don't be a jackass but it's targeted very much for beginning junior developers and I

40:02.160 --> 40:06.920
kind of goes through the different concerns that might be hard for you to see at that

40:06.920 --> 40:11.520
level the other your managers or the more senior people in your team might have tips

40:11.520 --> 40:16.240
for how to continually improve your skills and literally do continuous improvement.

40:16.240 --> 40:20.040
So again we were just talking about get offs right stuff like that.

40:20.040 --> 40:25.320
I can't say I agree with 100 percent of everything in the book but it's worth reading.

40:25.320 --> 40:26.360
It's five stars for me.

40:26.360 --> 40:27.360
It's a must must buy.

40:27.360 --> 40:28.360
All right.

40:28.360 --> 40:32.260
Well of course we'll have a link at coder dot show slash four seven seven.

40:32.260 --> 40:37.400
And then we got one more here code to developer tools and strategies for delivering your software.

40:37.400 --> 40:40.880
And this one they got a Kindle version.

40:40.880 --> 40:44.440
And now it is time for the boost.

40:44.440 --> 40:45.440
Let's do it.

40:45.440 --> 40:50.560
A Chiron I'm going to say came in with a row of duckeroos duck D.U.K.

40:50.560 --> 40:55.520
duck loaded with talent two thousand two hundred and twenty two stats been listening since

40:55.520 --> 40:56.760
episode one.

40:56.760 --> 40:58.860
And here's my first boost.

40:58.860 --> 41:04.240
I'd be interested to hear your thoughts on things like solid pods and the semantic web

41:04.240 --> 41:08.520
as a means of building a truly decentralized Internet.

41:08.520 --> 41:09.520
What's up Richard Hendricks.

41:09.520 --> 41:14.540
Yeah I feel like I totally would love to see a truly decentralized Internet but I don't

41:14.540 --> 41:20.120
know if I've seen anything that's going to compels me to say there's going to be traction.

41:20.120 --> 41:27.340
And we do have an announcement to make in regards to the show and the boosts swigs writes

41:27.340 --> 41:33.640
in with our last cheap boost for the show three hundred stats.

41:33.640 --> 41:37.160
After today we're going to set the limit to two thousand stats to get into the show just

41:37.160 --> 41:39.540
to keep it tight because we got to keep you know we want to make it nice and tight here

41:39.540 --> 41:41.140
on the show don't take too long.

41:41.140 --> 41:44.240
But swigs you get the last one because I hadn't made the announcement yet and I think it's

41:44.240 --> 41:45.240
perfect.

41:45.240 --> 41:48.640
I'm glad actually because swigs writes I've been listening to Jupiter broadcasting for

41:48.640 --> 41:50.480
the better part of a year now.

41:50.480 --> 41:56.060
I finally broke down and installed the fountain app and it's actually really nice to be able

41:56.060 --> 41:59.660
to contribute to the podcast of my choice in such an easy manner because it just puts

41:59.660 --> 42:01.440
the button right there while you're listening.

42:01.440 --> 42:05.960
Side note I run sailfish OS on a Sony Xperia 10 man the people who have experience love

42:05.960 --> 42:06.960
him.

42:06.960 --> 42:08.920
He says the fountain app works great as expected.

42:08.920 --> 42:13.280
Thanks for the content and keep up the podcasting 2.0 fight.

42:13.280 --> 42:14.320
Thank you sir.

42:14.320 --> 42:15.320
Thank you very much.

42:15.320 --> 42:16.320
Appreciate you.

42:16.320 --> 42:17.320
All right.

42:17.320 --> 42:22.240
Optimus Gray who's also watching live right now boosted in with a big set of grandpa ducks

42:22.240 --> 42:26.480
twenty two thousand two hundred and twenty two stats.

42:26.480 --> 42:27.480
Thank you very much.

42:27.480 --> 42:28.960
And here's something for your trouble.

42:28.960 --> 42:29.960
All right.

42:29.960 --> 42:32.160
I feel like this is where we're going to get in trouble in this episode Mike.

42:32.160 --> 42:33.160
But here we go.

42:33.160 --> 42:38.080
He says I know you guys are not the lawyers this is not lawyer radio but I have been tasked

42:38.080 --> 42:42.720
with coming up with the open source alternatives and tools for dependencies we currently use.

42:42.720 --> 42:46.480
Where is a good source on what types of licenses can be used in the corporate world.

42:46.480 --> 42:49.320
You know as simple BSD or versus open core.

42:49.320 --> 42:51.720
What are all the differences and where should I go.

42:51.720 --> 42:56.160
So there's a question right there like do you have anywhere you send people.

42:56.160 --> 43:00.280
I've got a link that I'm going to put in the show notes that is like a look from a legal

43:00.280 --> 43:04.280
level and they have a visual matrix breakdown of the different licenses but I'm curious

43:04.280 --> 43:08.200
what you would do like if you were going to go research if this is legal.

43:08.200 --> 43:09.200
Is this risky.

43:09.200 --> 43:12.040
You know like there's got to be somewhere you start right.

43:12.040 --> 43:19.160
I mean I have a pretty super conservative thing if it's not Apache BSD or MIT I don't

43:19.160 --> 43:20.160
use it.

43:20.160 --> 43:21.720
Yeah that's kind of the safe way to do it I suppose.

43:21.720 --> 43:22.720
Yeah.

43:22.720 --> 43:24.880
So I'm sure I'll definitely take a look at your chart.

43:24.880 --> 43:28.320
Yeah and let us know what you think out there audience because I think that is a question

43:28.320 --> 43:30.520
that we've never 100 percent answered on the show.

43:30.520 --> 43:33.480
But I do have a link in the show notes and maybe we can start there.

43:33.480 --> 43:34.480
I love this.

43:34.480 --> 43:40.460
This next username wine bat boosted in with 5000 sats boost after the last couple of episodes

43:40.460 --> 43:44.280
it may be in it may be time to start the flutter challenge.

43:44.280 --> 43:49.320
Maybe bring West and maybe I mean that's so time consuming that's what the thing about

43:49.320 --> 43:50.320
the challenges.

43:50.320 --> 43:53.480
Yeah the challenges are tough especially like if it's going to be a gooey thing that's even

43:53.480 --> 43:57.960
harder and we should keep it on the back we should do something.

43:57.960 --> 44:01.920
I don't you know flutter we hear a lot about flutter but I'm not sure if that's the flutter

44:01.920 --> 44:08.040
folks and right and if you are you know are there a lot of them listening or are we just

44:08.040 --> 44:10.720
hearing from the are they super vocal.

44:10.720 --> 44:11.720
Right.

44:11.720 --> 44:14.840
Yeah you know but that's what we said about rust early on too.

44:14.840 --> 44:16.840
And it's all Jeremy Soller.

44:16.840 --> 44:19.640
All right Trump to have boosted.

44:19.640 --> 44:20.640
Hello Trump.

44:20.640 --> 44:21.640
Good to see you again.

44:21.640 --> 44:24.800
2048 sats coming in hot with the blues.

44:24.800 --> 44:28.200
He's followed up to a question I asked last week when he said that you know Microsoft

44:28.200 --> 44:31.400
is trying to extinguish Linux I said do you really think they're trying to extinguish

44:31.400 --> 44:32.400
it.

44:32.400 --> 44:38.440
And I guess what I mean by extinguish is make Linux as irrelevant as possible.

44:38.440 --> 44:42.400
OK not long ago working primarily with FOSS was not easy to convince people to do.

44:42.400 --> 44:43.400
I agree.

44:43.400 --> 44:47.640
He goes on to say Microsoft sees the competitive nature of free software today.

44:47.640 --> 44:52.260
They'll keep fluffing us up buying our platforms buying our talent and taking over as much

44:52.260 --> 44:55.160
as they need to keep the Linux desktop from being competitive.

44:55.160 --> 45:00.320
The cloud maybe at the end of the day they need to convince managers and bean counters

45:00.320 --> 45:03.720
that their solution is better.

45:03.720 --> 45:04.720
Yeah that might be it.

45:04.720 --> 45:05.720
I don't know.

45:05.720 --> 45:06.720
Yeah I don't know.

45:06.720 --> 45:11.320
See I think nobody thinks about desktop Linux more than desktop Linux people.

45:11.320 --> 45:12.400
I'm sorry.

45:12.400 --> 45:17.640
And I love my devil one and my my pop OS and all that but I think Microsoft is just happy

45:17.640 --> 45:21.200
to make a ton of money on Azure using Linux and they're cool with that right.

45:21.200 --> 45:24.920
I know that using word is doing a lot of work in that sense but I agree.

45:24.920 --> 45:29.320
And if you want to if you want to use the GNOME desktop and you want to write all of

45:29.320 --> 45:33.120
your code in GNOME text and then you know upload it.

45:33.120 --> 45:37.760
No one no one wants to write all of their but they don't care right as long as you're

45:37.760 --> 45:41.560
running on Azure services or maybe you're using VS code they don't care.

45:41.560 --> 45:44.800
I don't even think they really care about VS code it's all just to get you up to Azure

45:44.800 --> 45:48.840
like that's it's we did we predict this like three years ago or four years ago.

45:48.840 --> 45:51.040
It's just it's all about Azure.

45:51.040 --> 45:52.560
All roads lead to Azure.

45:52.560 --> 45:57.240
The only thing that the only influence desktop Linux has had not only but the biggest one

45:57.240 --> 46:01.760
is Katie is naming conventions every time I go to a store and see a giant K I'm like

46:01.760 --> 46:07.880
is that a Linux product or the GNOME stuff that you know the G at it like it's not kibble

46:07.880 --> 46:10.840
it's K kibble I don't even know why my poor dog.

46:10.840 --> 46:15.820
And here's why here's why I'm pretty confident in this assessment is because in this assessment

46:15.820 --> 46:19.720
Microsoft makes money with Linux is successful or Windows is successful.

46:19.720 --> 46:22.880
They don't need Linux to fail to make money in this area.

46:22.880 --> 46:26.000
I'm pretty sure they make more money on Azure now too.

46:26.000 --> 46:27.000
All right.

46:27.000 --> 46:31.480
Noob Steve comes in with a big grandpa roll of tux twenty two thousand two hundred and

46:31.480 --> 46:32.480
twenty two sacks.

46:32.480 --> 46:33.480
Thank you very much.

46:33.480 --> 46:35.720
And here's something for your trouble.

46:35.720 --> 46:41.400
Long time listener first time boost first written in before but I'm the dude who retired

46:41.400 --> 46:44.160
from the Navy and is hoping to move into dev work.

46:44.160 --> 46:45.160
I've got two questions.

46:45.160 --> 46:46.160
Oh great.

46:46.160 --> 46:51.920
Noob Steve says first I hear this and other podcasts how much everyone just seems to love

46:51.920 --> 46:53.800
rust how awesome it is.

46:53.800 --> 46:56.320
If that's the case why are there no jobs for it.

46:56.320 --> 47:00.280
I'd love to learn it but it definitely needs to focus on what's going to get me a job at

47:00.280 --> 47:02.380
least in the next two years.

47:02.380 --> 47:03.800
That's a fair assessment right there.

47:03.800 --> 47:04.800
Yeah.

47:04.800 --> 47:08.700
So everybody loves rust because rust is technically very good.

47:08.700 --> 47:11.800
Lawyers don't hire for a lot of rust because rust is technically very good and very hard

47:11.800 --> 47:16.760
to develop in if you don't want to spend lots of money on very senior developers.

47:16.760 --> 47:18.880
That's a great observation right there.

47:18.880 --> 47:21.240
And you know what it is is a lot of senior developers who've been in these positions

47:21.240 --> 47:23.120
forever are just rewriting their tools and rust.

47:23.120 --> 47:24.120
They've already got the jobs.

47:24.120 --> 47:28.920
And a lot of like the more vocal rust people are people who've been doing C plus plus for

47:28.920 --> 47:31.520
a long time and are just tired of getting bitten.

47:31.520 --> 47:32.520
But right.

47:32.520 --> 47:38.680
It's I mean maybe again if you're a new person who's like diving into rust as your first

47:38.680 --> 47:41.640
language I got protect you.

47:41.640 --> 47:42.800
God bless you.

47:42.800 --> 47:44.000
Good luck.

47:44.000 --> 47:45.000
But I don't know.

47:45.000 --> 47:50.020
Like if you're looking for quantity of jobs anything Webby Python can do basically anything

47:50.020 --> 47:53.000
because we've all decided that we'll just we're Google.

47:53.000 --> 47:55.520
Every problem can be solved with a Python script.

47:55.520 --> 48:00.240
And unfortunately especially with your Navy background well not unfortunately but it depends

48:00.240 --> 48:05.880
on how much of a Linux zealot you are got that baby especially with that military background.

48:05.880 --> 48:11.340
As long as you got a nice honorable discharge there are tons of contractors who will totally

48:11.340 --> 48:13.560
hire you to do C sharp.

48:13.560 --> 48:15.040
I agree with everything.

48:15.040 --> 48:18.720
Plus one to all of that and don't feel bad about it either noob Steve because you know

48:18.720 --> 48:23.200
say you go down the dot net path you go you know heavy with the web development stuff

48:23.200 --> 48:25.640
it could be you know three four years five years.

48:25.640 --> 48:27.080
It doesn't mean you don't pick something up.

48:27.080 --> 48:29.920
In the meantime you don't start a side hobby you don't start learning something else you

48:29.920 --> 48:33.560
don't transition to something else you just got to get that ball rolling.

48:33.560 --> 48:39.760
Also being a veteran or soon to be a soon to be veteran that puts you for that particular

48:39.760 --> 48:44.360
and maybe you don't want to do the military contract knows that puts you in a basically

48:44.360 --> 48:47.120
automatically ahead of anybody else.

48:47.120 --> 48:52.560
Even if you go work for a smaller and contractor there's tons of them around they're always

48:52.560 --> 48:53.560
hiring dot net.

48:53.560 --> 48:54.560
Yeah that's a great point.

48:54.560 --> 48:56.000
That's probably the easiest path.

48:56.000 --> 48:58.880
Keep us posted noob Steve and he actually rounds it out we're just about done he rounds

48:58.880 --> 49:05.320
it out with a double boost with a double grandpa's another grandpa's.

49:05.320 --> 49:08.240
All right my other question is maybe a little controversial.

49:08.240 --> 49:12.040
I'm not looking to start a flame war but I just actually want to understand why the hell

49:12.040 --> 49:16.880
would anyone want to use Vim or Emacs when there's tools like VS code and JetBrains.

49:16.880 --> 49:21.200
I have a student license so I get JetBrains cheap but I couldn't imagine using anything

49:21.200 --> 49:23.040
but JetBrains and VS code.

49:23.040 --> 49:24.400
What am I missing?

49:24.400 --> 49:27.440
Is there some kind of amazing functionality I'm overlooking?

49:27.440 --> 49:32.600
Me trying to quit Vim is the best way to seed your encryption by the way.

49:32.600 --> 49:35.380
Part of me agrees with noob Steve I'd like to hear the audience's answer though I'd like

49:35.380 --> 49:38.320
people to let us know boost in and let us know what you think.

49:38.320 --> 49:40.840
And Steve I'm just going to double down on my dot net.

49:40.840 --> 49:45.640
Check out Visual Studio you will you will love it or JetBrains project writer or just

49:45.640 --> 49:48.400
be sharper in Visual Studio you'll be very happy.

49:48.400 --> 49:50.480
I don't know people are purists right?

49:50.480 --> 49:56.280
I mean I use Vim for some stuff but I have been seduced by the ways of VS code.

49:56.280 --> 50:03.760
I'm eager to try JetBrains not Blains brains it's not some sort of strange plane.

50:03.760 --> 50:05.680
What is it fleet?

50:05.680 --> 50:06.680
Project fleet?

50:06.680 --> 50:12.880
I've been playing around with Zed I don't know I mean why do people like Emacs and Vim?

50:12.880 --> 50:18.640
Because one it's a nice alpha nerd flex and two a lot of the first of all Emacs a lot

50:18.640 --> 50:21.600
of the Emacs guys are just like BSD greybeards.

50:21.600 --> 50:24.960
There must be some core functionality though there must be right?

50:24.960 --> 50:29.040
Well I've seen especially Emacs Emacs setups where you could just like like their email

50:29.040 --> 50:31.640
client is an Emacs right they just live in Emacs.

50:31.640 --> 50:38.800
So that yeah I don't know work with whatever makes you happy except TextMate 2 is better.

50:38.800 --> 50:41.800
Magenta Eagle comes in with our last boost and it's a hot one.

50:41.800 --> 50:43.120
Coming in hot with the boost.

50:43.120 --> 50:50.840
We might go to admit that the best language is C and not C sharp and not that other dead

50:50.840 --> 50:53.600
language I think I think he's talking about objective C.

50:53.600 --> 50:54.600
What?

50:54.600 --> 50:55.600
Dead.

50:55.600 --> 50:57.680
Death is only the beginning.

50:57.680 --> 51:04.840
Coming in with the opinions also coming in with a 420 sat follow-up MIT is greater than

51:04.840 --> 51:05.840
GPL.

51:05.840 --> 51:06.840
You redeemed yourself sir.

51:06.840 --> 51:10.040
I thought you'd like that.

51:10.040 --> 51:15.520
No again like we used to cover dotnet a lot when I was I was doing a lot of the you know

51:15.520 --> 51:20.280
the exam Xamarin Samarian whatever the hell you call it stuff C sharp is really good right

51:20.280 --> 51:24.840
I would say it's Java but better although Java's copied a lot of their features too

51:24.840 --> 51:30.960
so it's really good objective C is better but it lost because.

51:30.960 --> 51:31.960
Apple decided.

51:31.960 --> 51:33.720
War crimes.

51:33.720 --> 51:38.960
Apple yes Apple does the king he doth decree that the brackets will be dropped.

51:38.960 --> 51:45.600
Although about several times a year I doth get a call they need my ancient wisdom my

51:45.600 --> 51:51.320
pre-arch ancient wisdom go to the hills someone one of the ancient ones hey do you know this

51:51.320 --> 51:58.380
Michael Dominic Mike Dominic it's not a name I've heard to obi-wan right no not a name

51:58.380 --> 52:04.040
I've heard in many years I was was a friend of your father's until he died I just talked

52:04.040 --> 52:08.800
to my dad last night he became a swift developer he's dead inside.

52:08.800 --> 52:13.040
Yes no C sharp is great and I think you should call Noob Steve and you guys should both download

52:13.040 --> 52:20.680
Visual Studio boom all right we got a few thank you boosts coming into 50 sats from

52:20.680 --> 52:29.640
user 48 30 100 sats from Ibuki who's his thanks for 96 from our and then my goodness how about

52:29.640 --> 52:35.100
this another 2048 sats from Noob Steve because he just loves us which makes him the baller

52:35.100 --> 52:43.880
of the episode he's on it go try out fountain FM if you want to send us a boost I have my

52:43.880 --> 52:47.980
referral link in the show notes I don't get money from it but I think it ties you to my

52:47.980 --> 52:53.400
account because I will post clips from time to time from the JB shows and that's part

52:53.400 --> 52:56.880
of what makes fountain neat is they have a whole clip discovery system so you can find

52:56.880 --> 53:00.640
new podcasts all the time so I'll put a link to that in the show notes or go to new podcast

53:00.640 --> 53:05.040
apps calm if you'd like to get a new podcast app that is podcasting tune it up compatible

or you can grab breeze be our easy dot technology and of course you can always send us in your

53:10.760 --> 53:15.440
emails over at coder dot show slash contact we got the contact form over there and we

53:15.440 --> 53:19.860
love hearing from you it is a big part of this show so write it in however you'd like

53:19.860 --> 53:25.500
to mr. Dominic is there anywhere you want to send the good people go to Alice dot Dev

53:25.500 --> 53:29.880
and add to Manuka on Twitter that's what I would do that's the pro move what did you

53:29.880 --> 53:34.160
say coder completionist right that's the that's right that's the coder completionist so is

53:34.160 --> 53:39.320
the membership thank you to our members our QA crowd over at coder QA dot go the new coder

53:39.320 --> 53:44.480
Lee is out I've been getting really good feedback on that coder Lee so big thank you to to Alex

53:44.480 --> 53:49.020
giga Texel who helped us with that been getting a lot of feedback on that people have loved

53:49.020 --> 53:52.940
that coder Lee so if you remember you can find it in your downloads area or it's also

53:52.940 --> 53:57.360
in your ad free feed we make an ad free feed for this show available to our members at

53:57.360 --> 54:01.360
coder QA dot co and when the coder Lee comes out we publish in that feed and then it's

54:01.360 --> 54:05.920
also if you go to your memorable dashboard it's available as a standalone download as

54:05.920 --> 54:11.520
