Big congratulations, right, to the folks over at Oracle.

00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,440
Oh, no, no, no, no.

23
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:03,440
Oh, no, no.

24
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:04,440
I got this.

25
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:05,440
F*** you, Larry Ellison.

26
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:06,440
Yeah.

27
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:10,600
It is definitely a victory day for the folks over at Google.

28
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:13,800
We kid that it's a boy.

29
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:18,320
This is a story that has been like 10 years in the making, right?

30
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:19,320
Just about.

31
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:24,000
And finally came to a conclusion today, but I'm left with questions.

32
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
God.

33
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,880
Oh, can we just take the win for once?

34
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,920
Can we just take the God damn win?

35
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:31,880
I didn't think it was going to happen, but we'll get there first.

36
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:34,440
I want to know if it's true or not.

37
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:35,560
Did you buy another HomePod?

38
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:37,940
No, because I couldn't goddamn find one.

39
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:39,680
What made you decide to buy a third HomePod?

40
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,040
Two, I get.

41
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:45,080
Three, well, might as well get four at that point and have another stereo pair.

42
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:46,080
You know what?

43
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:48,720
The HomePod is just significantly better than the Sonos.

44
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:49,720
It is, isn't it?

45
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:51,000
If you have iOS devices.

46
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,280
Yeah, that is true.

47
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,280
All right.

48
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,280
Well, I just thought I'd have to find out.

49
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:59,000
I had to because I'm trying to now the trouble is, like, I'm at the point where I don't

50
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,440
they make the HomePod anymore and maybe lower the price to a more, you know, sane level

51
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:09,480
because I would totally buy I mean, honestly, if I had a multilevel residence or like a

52
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:13,840
place with a basement, I could be good for five or six HomePods.

53
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:18,320
All right, now listen, stay a while and listen.

54
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:20,040
Oh, Decker game.

55
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,040
There you are.

56
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,040
I know.

57
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:23,040
It's nice, isn't it?

58
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,040
You got to work him in every now and then.

59
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:25,040
I have a robe update.

60
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,640
I have a very exciting robe update.

61
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:32,720
So I thought maybe I'd talk a little bit about this because this was an area that I think

62
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:36,380
is interesting from a small business standpoint and managing your small business.

63
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:37,640
So I'll come back to that.

64
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:46,760
But quickly, the update is domestic and US orders should start arriving around May 19th,

65
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:48,160
May 20th.

66
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:53,640
We didn't quite make the window and the materials got used and had to be reordered because of

67
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:57,640
some of the issues that held up the order, which are related to international troubles.

68
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:00,080
Now, international orders stand by.

69
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,800
I'll have more news for you next week.

70
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,360
We're still trying our best to work that out.

71
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:07,920
I may have bad news, but either way, we'll get in touch with you as we try to sort that

72
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:08,920
boy.

73
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:10,640
A lot of lessons learned.

74
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:16,560
I have rethought a lot of things and I'm also very excited that we actually have a like

75
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,840
a ship date or an arrival date, perhaps for the robes.

76
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:26,940
But I feel like as a business, I'm rethinking my entire strategy around swag.

77
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:30,760
And I think what, when I look back at this as sort of like a post-mortem, I think one

78
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:39,340
of the primary problems I had was I was attempting to do something that was really, really outside

79
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:42,760
the norm for like my first thing.

80
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:48,600
And additionally, I couldn't work with a shop that like shipping internationally was like

81
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:53,240
the thing they did because of how unique this particular thing was.

82
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:58,560
And so they were a domestic operation who generally would like just send like a hundred

83
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,000
or 200 units to me.

84
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,860
And then I would ship them out to everybody around the world.

85
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:06,440
That's generally the type of customer they have.

86
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:10,920
And instead I was trying to get them to send it everywhere in the world, which they can

87
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:13,180
do, but it's not their core competency.

88
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:18,180
And as a result of that, I didn't appreciate how much that would matter.

89
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:24,600
But now I understand that it seems like for the kind of thing I want to do and to ship

90
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:29,880
internationally at reasonable rates, because some of these rates to like anybody who lived

91
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:36,120
in Germany, the original pricing we were working with was $150 of shipping per robe.

92
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,120
Holy crap.

93
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,120
Yeah.

94
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:42,940
The cheapest international shipping we had was $95.

95
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:52,120
So it was a range between $95 and almost $200 with the exception of Canada, which is like

96
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:56,720
$85.

97
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,160
So now we're trying to sort that out.

98
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:03,800
And it was clear to me what would really work a lot better for an operation like JB who

99
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:07,680
operates out of the States, but has a worldwide audience that represents a significant portion

100
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,760
of its audience.

101
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:13,960
I have to build up some sort of operation where we're printing the shipping labels and

102
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:18,040
slapping them on boxes and boxing them up here and then dropping them off at the post

103
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:20,280
office and they're shipping them off.

104
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:22,180
And I'm just not there yet.

105
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:24,960
So I try to get another company to do that part for me.

106
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:31,780
And the way they operate it is the way the type of drop shipping they do is they need

107
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:38,520
all the shipping information and get every robe's destination and then come back with

108
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:39,520
a quote.

109
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:43,960
And then of course there's tons of back and forth and trying to find alternative fulfillment

110
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:48,620
places and all that kind of stuff, which is where we're at right now for the international.

111
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:54,940
But the domestic orders, what we decided to do was break those off into their own original

112
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:59,920
order set from the original supplier and just get those out and going while we sort out

113
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:00,920
the rest of it.

114
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:05,520
I mean, I learned a lot and I think I've internalized a new strategy for the company and how we're

115
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,220
going to learn how to do this.

116
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:09,640
I can't just start selling swag.

117
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:13,720
I can't just turn on a switch and all of a sudden I'm like, you know, stocking swag

118
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:16,520
and boxing swag and shipping swag.

119
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:17,520
First of all, it sounds like hell.

120
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,000
And second of all, I have no idea what I'm doing.

121
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,040
And third of all, I have no inventory.

122
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:28,080
I have to figure out how to get that skill set while not bankrupting the company because

123
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:32,580
things could go really simple where like I pre-order a hundred robes for a second patch,

124
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:36,000
stock them here at the studio and then never get them shipped out or never get, you know,

125
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,960
like I could just so many ways I could screw this up.

126
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:44,480
So I have to build institutional knowledge while not screwing the pooch and keeping the

127
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:48,360
train on the tracks while we try to build up this new aspect of the business.

128
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:53,000
But I feel like my lessons learned here are if I want to be serious about how to do this,

129
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,360
I'm going to have to be kind of responsible for at least, at least like, like maybe what

130
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,240
I would do, I guess I'll say it, put it this way.

131
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:04,460
If I were going to do this again, I would take pre-orders and I would like make, I would

132
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:05,960
just order 200 robes.

133
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:09,680
And then once 200 robes were sold, that's as many as we had.

134
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:13,840
We could do a second batch if we wanted, but I would, and then I would box them up and

135
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:22,680
ship them out myself with like a label printer and like, you know, on a specific day, a couple

136
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:26,360
of us are here at the studio boxing things up, loading the car and sending it out a couple

137
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,360
of times a week.

138
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,600
And that's what I would do this time around.

139
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:33,360
And then, you know, and then maybe open up another 200 orders or something, but I'm just

140
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,360
not there yet.

141
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:36,360
Or don't do it at all.

142
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,360
Right.

143
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,360
Robes were a stupid idea.

144
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,360
Yep.

145
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,360
Yep.

146
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,360
You shouldn't have done them.

147
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,360
Nope.

148
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,360
Nope.

149
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,360
I warned you.

150
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:48,400
I was, I felt like a good challenge would, would force me to dive deep into this and

151
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,880
like I'd have to solve it in route.

152
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:52,360
And that might be true.

153
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:55,040
Unless we got Reese and Dylan and Abigail, right?

154
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:58,160
Their daughter, are you talking about, you're talking about a ham slice in the channel?

155
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,160
No, yeah.

156
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:01,480
We just enslaved the kids and make them box all the ropes.

157
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:02,480
Oh yeah.

158
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,720
I'm totally going to enlist the kids.

159
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:04,720
Oh yeah.

160
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:05,720
For sure.

161
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:06,720
Like, I mean, I have a 14 year old brother.

162
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,720
He just turned 14.

163
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,720
Um, I'm totally cool with child labor.

164
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:10,880
I just make it fun somehow.

165
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:15,160
I'd figure out a way, you know, play some music, make a game out of it.

166
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,160
We need to learn.

167
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,740
No, no, no, no, no, no, listen.

168
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:20,920
My first job was a janitor when I was in high school.

169
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:25,400
And uh, for all my young men in the audience, you think girls are neat and clean, clean

170
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,160
a ladies room.

171
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:29,280
It will change your life.

172
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,080
Should have done something much simpler.

173
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:32,080
Like a t-shirt.

174
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,080
That'd have been easy.

175
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,080
Could have done a lot of t-shirts.

176
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,080
T-shirts suck.

177
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,080
They do suck.

178
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,080
That was what it was.

179
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,880
I'm so bored of typical swag.

180
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,960
Let me just fix your problem for you.

181
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:44,420
Do the coder radio beer glass.

182
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:45,600
Like a Stein kind of thing.

183
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,600
That's an internet.

184
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:47,600
Yeah.

185
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,600
Okay.

186
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,880
I was even being like lazier than that, but if we can pull off a Stein, that's even better.

187
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:51,880
Yeah.

188
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:52,880
That's kind of love 400 thing, you know?

189
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:53,960
I mean, I'm just saying.

190
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:54,960
They're hippies anyway.

191
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:55,960
What are they going to care?

192
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:56,960
That's true.

193
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:57,960
What do they even know over there?

194
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:58,960
Nothing.

195
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:03,840
I have been actually legitimately looking for like a supplier of, of mugs or cups that

196
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:06,280
have like a ring around the bottom that prevent tipping.

197
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:10,400
I mean, if you could get an actual Stein with a hinge on it, that'd be pretty cool.

198
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:11,400
That would be cool.

199
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,520
But I feel like that's going to have the same problem as the ropes.

200
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:14,520
I don't know.

201
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:15,520
Yeah.

202
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:19,320
And plus, plus shipping something breakable like that probably isn't a good first, uh,

203
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,320
yeah.

204
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,320
Okay.

205
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,320
All right.

206
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,320
All right.

207
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,320
Fine.

208
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,320
Fine.

209
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,320
Fine.

210
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,320
I don't want to dare.

211
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,320
I dare.

212
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,320
I touch the luck monks of feudal Linux observance.

213
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,320
Right.

214
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:33,560
How about this quarter radio martini glass?

215
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:34,560
That's right.

216
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:35,560
On brand.

217
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:36,560
That's actually very on brand.

218
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:37,560
I'm just going to say.

219
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:38,560
Yeah.

220
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:39,560
Yeah.

221
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:40,560
That sounds great.

222
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:43,240
And I can tell you, I do mad butter or martini glasses and that is not very hard.

223
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:44,240
So.

224
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,240
Hmm.

225
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,240
All right.

226
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,240
All right.

227
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:48,240
I'm filing that one away.

228
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,240
Okay.

229
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,240
I could see it.

230
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,160
I could see the glass too, like a stir or something.

231
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,160
I don't know.

232
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:54,280
But anyway, so thank you everybody.

233
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:58,400
I am going to get these robes figured out and then I'm going to make some like lessons

234
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,880
learned plans that they'll share with everybody.

235
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:04,680
I went from a business standpoint, I'm going to do in the future, but that's the robe update

236
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:05,680
for now.

237
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:12,040
It's just, it's been way more than I expected, although, uh, I did, I do totally acknowledge

238
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:13,440
I brought it all on myself.

239
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,880
I do this to myself.

240
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,480
It is completely my fault.

241
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:17,760
I acknowledge that.

242
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:21,480
I am excited to say robe, Rose in the U S you'll be receiving, you'll be receiving your

243
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:22,760
robe soon.

244
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:28,640
Those of you internationally, you'll be hearing from us either with bad news or, uh, an alternative

245
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:34,320
source or perhaps, perhaps we will be just absolutely forced to do a round two.

246
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,320
I don't know.

247
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,320
I don't know.

248
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,320
I mean, maybe, maybe more robes will be demanded.

249
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,320
You know, we get a lot of emails in.

250
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:41,040
I feel like you're just making an excuse to do more robes.

251
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:46,040
I think this whole, like you just saying you're going to do more robes.

252
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:48,640
Personally, I kind of want to be done with the robe.

253
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:49,640
It's been a lot.

254
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:52,200
I don't believe you.

255
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:55,160
And here's what's going to happen in June.

256
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:59,560
I'm going to start selling mad botter swag on here because you know what I deliver, you

257
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:00,560
know why I deliver?

258
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,160
I only sell glass and t-shirts.

259
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,160
Yep.

260
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:04,160
I know.

261
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,600
You know, a shot glass would be easier to, would have been a lot easier shot glass would

262
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,600
have been a lot easier.

263
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,240
Look at Java jacks, the coder radio sippy cup.

264
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:13,760
I have been looking, I've been looking something spill proof, but you know what?

265
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:18,560
A lot of the things that they sell as like a rebrandable swag seem like they're targeted

266
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:22,280
adults for some reason and not children.

267
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:25,200
I mean, I feel there was no need for hate speech, but maybe we should just move on to

268
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,360
the actual show.

269
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:30,960
I think what we need is an artist and sippy cup created by the audience that we could

270
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:33,600
mass produce or maybe only make a couple limited.

271
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,600
You know what?

272
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:38,680
The only person qualified to create a sippy cup in the world is me because I will find

273
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:39,680
every flaw.

274
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:40,980
There you go.

275
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:42,200
You could be a good product tester.

276
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,960
Oh, and then I think the other thing I'm going to do in the future, although I haven't worked

277
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:49,440
out the details on this yet either, is I think I'm going to figure out a way that members

278
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:54,080
of our shows can get discounts when they buy any of the merch that we do.

279
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,760
Why the hell don't we have new stickers?

280
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:56,760
Yeah.

281
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:57,760
And stickers too.

282
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:00,760
I think stickers are, I think if I'm going to be able to ship robes, I could ship stickers

283
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:01,760
too.

284
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:07,000
Dude, I can ship stickers and I'm usually like depressed or hungover or like wiping

285
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
somebody's butt.

286
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I mean, come on.

287
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:14,200
Well, stay tuned because stickers have been a topic of conversation recently.

288
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:18,080
Before we move on, because we have lots of email to get to, I want to mention that our

289
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:23,660
friends at a Cloud Guru have a PowerShell core for Linux admins course that I thought

290
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:26,480
would be particularly useful for our audience.

291
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:30,120
Now this is an intermediate level course, so you might need to know a little bit of

292
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:33,680
basics around Linux, but it's really about the concepts of using PowerShell core with

293
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:39,620
Linux, everything from like getting it installed on a Linux box to using commandlets and using

294
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:44,920
Visual Studio code, and then you get into some of the more advanced components as well.

295
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:49,320
And by the end of it, you've got a like working Docker install and SQL server running in there

296
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:52,220
and you're managing Azure resources with PowerShell.

297
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:56,000
If you're curious about their PowerShell core for Linux admins course, we will have a link

298
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:01,960
in the show notes at coder.show slash four zero eight.

299
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:03,160
Now let's get into the email.

300
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:04,160
We got a lot.

301
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,480
We had a spicy inbox this week.

302
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:11,280
Not all of them made it onto the air, but James S. writes in with an idea that I have

303
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:13,500
a feeling you're going to think is terrific.

304
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,900
He says, Hey guys, I love the show.

305
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:19,800
The talk about the new Apple Silicon performance in the context of development though has triggered

306
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:20,920
me slightly.

307
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:26,960
I've long felt that developers should be working deliberately on low to mid range hardware

308
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:31,800
because otherwise it's just too easy to hide bad code behind a fast CPU.

309
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:34,400
The majority of end users don't run the latest and greatest.

310
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:36,080
They have older hardware.

311
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:42,520
What do you think of this idea that if a developer has tons of RAM and a fast CPU, they almost

312
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:47,320
always write code that feels fine on their system, but crawls on hardware that the typical

313
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:48,920
end user actually has?

314
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:51,960
James, I'm sure you're a lovely person and I think you're great.

315
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,240
Thank you for listening to the show.

316
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:55,200
Your idea is stupid.

317
00:13:55,200 --> 00:14:00,620
What a developer should do is have a good computer with a gimped VMs for testing.

318
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:03,440
So the VMs should be intentionally weak to test.

319
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:09,720
For instance, on my Mac, my Mac pro, I have good windows VM for dev and a very crappy

320
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:11,240
windows VM for testing.

321
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:16,120
And it's like a third of the RAM and a third of the GPU, you know, allocate, you know,

322
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:19,360
it's VMware, something the allocation, I'm sorry, it's parallels.

323
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,920
I actually keep saying VMware.

324
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:22,240
I don't use VMware.

325
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,240
Okay.

326
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:25,280
I think I like VMware better on the Mac.

327
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:31,520
I agree with your point, James, that for testing, you should use a slightly weaker hardware

328
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:33,560
or significantly weaker hardware.

329
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:39,720
I honestly think a good workstation with different virtual machines for different use cases is

330
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:41,000
the best way.

331
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:45,680
So again, Chris, I agree with this point that like when I'm testing windows software or

332
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:51,600
any other kind of software, like Linux, whatever, my VMs for testing have like the minimal specs.

333
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:56,080
I don't want to have like five machines because that would be great.

334
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:58,000
I like your answer a little bit better than yours.

335
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:04,360
My answer was I think most developers keep a lot of their older hardware around.

336
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:05,360
Not me.

337
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:06,360
I pour marketing.

338
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:07,360
Well, yeah.

339
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,360
Yeah, for sure.

340
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:11,540
But I think some developers have like probably a couple of iterations of machines around

341
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:15,680
so they can use that for this thing called Q&A where they could actually test it on the

342
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,560
older hardware directly.

343
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:21,720
I am not a fan of limiting any developer's productivity.

344
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:26,560
Like if you get in the flow and you are having one of those beautiful moments, I feel like

345
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:30,440
the machine should be as fricking fast as possible to let you rip.

346
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:33,040
Like I buy my guys the best machines we can afford.

347
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,040
Amen.

348
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:36,920
It's the only area where I don't economize in the business.

349
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:37,920
I don't.

350
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:38,920
You know what?

351
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:39,920
Like what?

352
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:44,240
What's the stupidly dumb expensive machine that the asshole who works for me tricked

353
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:47,880
me into buying for him from System76, the Oryx.

354
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:49,520
Oh, that big laptop.

355
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:50,520
You got the big one.

356
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:51,520
Yeah.

357
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:52,520
Yeah.

358
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:53,520
He's got three monitors.

359
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:54,520
So I'm like, this is not what was intended.

360
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:55,520
He's like, I know, but I have two.

361
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:56,880
I have a giant GPU.

362
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:57,880
Like you don't need a GPU.

363
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:00,920
He's like, I know, but you're part of it anyway, you stupid bastard.

364
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:05,080
Hey, man, you want smooth window manager animations.

365
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,200
Let's be honest.

366
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,200
That stuff matters.

367
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:10,560
It still crashes if he runs an extension.

368
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:11,560
That's too soon.

369
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:12,560
It's too soon.

370
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:15,880
I actually have big news on that front later in the show.

371
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:16,880
You're pregnant.

372
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:17,880
No.

373
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:20,680
In the genome shell related world that I want to get your take on.

374
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:24,000
But I think I think VMs are a good answer to the trolling aside, right?

375
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,600
Like the question is, if you're a company, right?

376
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:32,560
If you're like someone like me where you have you employ devs, it makes sense to buy them

377
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:37,560
a higher spec machine than have them test in virtual machines that are intentionally

378
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:38,560
slow.

379
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:43,960
If you're like one guy, though, obviously keep your old machines back and just test

380
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:44,960
on those.

381
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:45,960
Right.

382
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:49,360
You don't need to buy a crazy iMac Pro that will be obsolete by your MacBook Air within

383
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,240
two years because Apple's evil.

384
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:52,600
What was I talking about?

385
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:57,200
Ron writes in, he says, hey, talking about Apple's gross, Dear Coder Radio, there are

386
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:59,300
two kinds of people who use Apple.

387
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:04,400
Number one, the technologically illiterate and number two, the insecure.

388
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:09,320
Group one is terrified of computers and group two is terrified of coffee shop laptop shaming.

389
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:12,200
Let's debunk some Apple fanboy myths.

390
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:16,680
Now, I don't know if Ron's trolling us because he spelled fanboy with an I, which I think

391
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:18,440
I don't know if he's trying to be.

392
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:25,720
Yeah, he writes the last time I spent 20 hours away from a power source was never so implying

393
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:27,520
you don't need long battery life.

394
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,920
Well, I have I've definitely done that, but keep going.

395
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:30,920
Yeah, I know.

396
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:33,480
And it's like if you've ever gone to an event.

397
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:35,360
Do you speak at conferences ever?

398
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:40,480
Yeah, a conference like the battery life, especially when you get to that stupid moment

399
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:44,760
where you realize you didn't charge, you left your laptop in your bag overnight.

400
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:46,200
You get there to do the talk.

401
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,260
You didn't plug it in.

402
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:53,680
And because Apple only lets you have a couple of USB-C ports, you're really in a tight spot.

403
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:57,140
But battery life matters a lot for me, too, because I spend a lot of weekends completely

404
00:17:57,140 --> 00:18:01,080
off grid where I am only generating power that comes from the sun.

405
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:04,080
Sometimes in the Pacific Northwest, there's not a lot of sun.

406
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:05,680
And I'm usually on a Coke bender.

407
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:06,680
So, yeah, right.

408
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:07,680
Of course.

409
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:09,680
And who's going to bother plugging in when you're on a bender?

410
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:13,080
He says syncing digital content across devices has never been easier.

411
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:14,760
I cloud isn't needed.

412
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:17,120
He set up next cloud in ten minutes.

413
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:20,920
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

414
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:21,920
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

415
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:22,920
Ten minutes.

416
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:23,920
He had next cloud going in ten minutes.

417
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:24,920
You were wrong when you said next cloud, but keep going.

418
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:29,760
I mean, this is this is a common thing that I think is hard for our community to understand.

419
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:33,560
A lot of people have no interest in doing that, even if they have the technical capability

420
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:34,560
of doing it.

421
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:35,560
They don't care.

422
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:36,560
Yeah.

423
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:40,880
He says staying productive during renders is not about hoping things get faster on the

424
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:41,880
M1.

425
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:42,880
It's about organizing your workflow.

426
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:48,320
My custom PC used for content creation will scorch any Mac in existence.

427
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,320
Wrong.

428
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:50,320
Stop.

429
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:51,320
Custom PC.

430
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:52,320
Yeah.

431
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:53,320
Wrong.

432
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:54,320
Right.

433
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:55,320
Because most people are not buying custom.

434
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:56,320
They're not customizing their PCs.

435
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:57,320
Yeah.

436
00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:02,920
So what I think guys like Ron kind of they don't look at the actual market and go, oh,

437
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:09,560
like there must be a reason why a guy like Marques Brownlee buys the Mac Pro.

438
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:10,560
Right.

439
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:12,680
Because, I mean, I'm sure he doesn't like burning money.

440
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:13,760
He'd rather probably buy that.

441
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:16,240
He'd rather spend that money on the next Tesla.

442
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,240
He's you know, why?

443
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:19,960
So why are they buying that Mac Pro?

444
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:22,760
And the reality is Final Cut.

445
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:24,080
It's Final Cut.

446
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,300
It's if you ask them, they will tell you.

447
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:27,680
It's because of Final Cut Pro 10.

448
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:29,440
Well, this is a developer show.

449
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:35,480
The reason I buy only System 76 and Macs for my guys is because I know out of the box with

450
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:38,120
either of those machines, they can get up and running.

451
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:39,120
Right.

452
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,560
My biggest expense is pay.

453
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:43,440
And then additionally, like if one of those guys leaves and you want to move that machine

454
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:47,200
to somebody else, do you want to move them some weird custom built PC or do you?

455
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:51,560
No, I want to wipe it and put Pop OS whatever or Mac OS whatever.

456
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:54,880
And then you scale that up for like any company that has like an IT department with a bunch

457
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:55,880
of employees.

458
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:58,920
It's just not scalable to do custom PCs.

459
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:01,760
The custom PCs are, I mean, bully for you.

460
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:02,760
No, that's great.

461
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:04,120
Seriously for you.

462
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:09,640
But when you have like if I was just a solo shop, honestly, I probably would have a custom

463
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:10,840
PC.

464
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:17,760
There's still a group of individuals out there who think that what's selling Apple and why

465
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:21,920
Apple is one of the most valuable companies in the world is because of marketing and fan

466
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:22,920
boys.

467
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:24,360
And I don't really need to dwell on it.

468
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:27,800
I don't think it's, I mean, but I think it's worth realizing that sometimes we can have

469
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:30,940
real blinders on to what seems to drive the market.

470
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:35,840
What seems to really drive the market seems to be battery life and performance and I would

471
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:37,120
say visual appeal.

472
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:42,160
And then it's something that we don't quite grok as a community is the entire package,

473
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:43,160
right?

474
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,160
It's a product.

475
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:51,240
The cloud services and the fancy Apple sales, everything is part of an entire product.

476
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:53,920
When you roll your own next cloud, that's awesome.

477
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:57,000
And I have two, I have two next cloud servers.

478
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
It's great.

479
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,880
The reality is though, that's not a whole product.

480
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:05,760
You built a custom PC, you loaded your own Linux on there and built it up just the way

481
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:06,980
you like it.

482
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:12,800
And then you set up next cloud to do your syncing and you did it all on your own.

483
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:13,800
And that's fantastic.

484
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:18,520
I host a show with Alex called Self Hosted because I love that stuff.

485
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:24,840
But I have to be aware that the vast, vast majority of the market, like the significant

486
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:29,120
total vast majority of the market doesn't do that kind of stuff.

487
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:31,640
And so they need a solution that works well for them.

488
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:36,860
And the better and faster that solution is, the overall more people are, their technology

489
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:38,420
experience is improved.

490
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:43,640
It's easy to dismiss this stuff, but I think it actually, it deserves important consideration.

491
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:49,080
And then the next questions start to become like, well, how do I make money on this reality?

492
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:52,400
Like if I want to have a business in software development and this is the reality of the

493
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,480
market, how do I make money on it?

494
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:58,640
I think that's a fair question to ask too, but maybe it's not.

495
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:01,920
Maybe your question is, and I'm not saying it is for everybody, but I'm saying often

496
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:04,200
in the context of the show, that's how we talk about it.

497
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:06,520
Maybe it's just, how can I have fun with it?

498
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:10,800
And Ron, that might be the area you're in and you can be wired to a wall and you never

499
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:15,840
have to go anywhere mobile and you can spend the time to set up Nextcloud and configure

500
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:19,560
your Android client to sync with your KDE desktop and man, more power to you.

501
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:23,060
I wish I had more time to do that stuff because I love doing that stuff too.

502
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:28,880
But you and I, my friend, we are a rare breed and we may be even fewer and fewer in some

503
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:35,200
ways, at least compared to the overall growth of the mobile and technology market.

504
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,600
Next one comes in from Alex.

505
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:40,360
Now for him, the Linux desktop just isn't worth the hassle.

506
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:42,240
He says, first of all, love the show.

507
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:43,240
You guys are great.

508
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:47,080
He goes on to compliment us for a bit, but I'm going to skip over that, but I really

509
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:48,080
appreciate it.

510
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:49,080
Thank you, Alex.

511
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:50,080
It's not you.

512
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:51,080
It's me.

513
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:52,080
Yes, I got it.

514
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:53,080
He says, you're great.

515
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:54,080
And I just don't want to talk about it.

516
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:55,080
You know, like we focus on it too much.

517
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:56,080
Geez.

518
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:57,080
No.

519
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:59,280
He says, some time ago you asked people to tell you about their work setups.

520
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:01,440
Remember when we came back, we did that for a little bit.

521
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:06,120
He says he proudly wrote in about his high end Dell 7 series, 7000 series laptop running

522
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:08,440
Ubuntu 1804 and i3.

523
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:11,140
The thing is I really wanted this setup to work.

524
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:15,920
My employer insists on using some commercial VPN software as well as some other office

525
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:19,600
software that only runs on windows, but I had it working for a bit.

526
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:23,140
I felt kind of like the hacker movie version of a developer spitting up new borderless

527
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:27,600
terminals and i3 and switching workspaces all while never really leaving the keyboard.

528
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:32,000
I felt productive, but then one day when going to our support desk, trying to get some Linux

529
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:37,860
corner case fixed, the staff member most knowledgeable on Linux was out and I had a full day of work

530
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:38,960
ahead of me.

531
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:44,120
So the solution they provided me was a used Mac.

532
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:51,020
What I got was a late 2020 Mac Pro fully decked out, i7, 32 gigs of RAM, one terabyte SSD.

533
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:53,720
And the amazing thing is it doesn't really seem to get all that hot and I don't really

534
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:58,120
hear the fans to the point where they're audible, even when running Docker or VMs.

535
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:04,680
I did disable turbo boost, but here's the kicker, Docker for Mac works amazing on this

536
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:06,000
Intel Mac.

537
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:11,080
And I just brew install all the GNU core utilities and just eat the annoyance of some of the

538
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:12,080
brew limitations.

539
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:18,160
And I'm not really looking back, the setups working really well for me.

540
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:22,440
And he goes on to mention how he had some problems with gaming, but he decided, you

541
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:25,000
know, really for that, maybe I should just set up a windows 10 box.

542
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:30,040
In conclusion, I'm kind of embarrassed to say that I've ended up leaving desktop Linux

543
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:31,040
behind.

544
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:35,460
It of course is the only answer for server side work, but my dumb terminal interface

545
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:43,960
to it is, well, a shiny, expensive, but effective gray slab from the guys in Cupertino, Alex.

546
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:48,120
That's hard for me to hear, I have to say, as somebody who's been using desktop Linux

547
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:49,120
for a very long time.

548
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:55,020
I know you have a religious objection to computers that actually work, but yeah, this is why

549
00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:58,720
Max, this is why there will be no year of Linux desktop, right?

550
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:02,160
You don't see a lot of people doing blog posts and YouTube videos about switching away from

551
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:03,160
Linux, right?

552
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:07,880
There's a lot of blog posts and hacker news stories about switching to Linux.

553
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:10,800
Let me tell you, how many of them do the blog posts about switching back?

554
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:13,640
I mean, I'm on an iMac Pro right now.

555
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:17,600
Sometimes you see it, but you don't see a lot, but I've done several of those blog posts

556
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,560
and I'm on an iMac Pro, right?

557
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:23,000
Just, I just hate, I hate hearing this.

558
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,400
I really do.

559
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,400
I hate hearing this.

560
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:31,080
So I mean, I can tell you, I also have hated hearing a lot of things over the last, let's

561
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:33,840
say six months and it doesn't get better.

562
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:36,960
So the M1 Pro is coming out in June.

563
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:37,960
Oh, geez.

564
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:38,960
Too soon?

565
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:39,960
Yeah.

566
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:45,720
If they had a, if they had a 16 core, if they had a 16 core M1 with 32 gigs of RAM and two

567
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:52,400
terabyte SSD and 27 inch plus screen, that'd be pretty tempting.

568
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:56,640
The only other like shoe or whatever the term is I'd need to kind of drop would be if I

569
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:02,800
even got like a whiff that like the Linux M1 support was getting dialed in and it was

570
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:06,280
like, you know, within the next year it's going to be working for sure.

571
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:10,080
I think I'd probably pull the trigger, but I, it doesn't mean I, there'd be, I just have,

572
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:11,800
that'd be one of many machines that I have.

573
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:12,800
Oh, let's backpedal.

574
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:13,800
Yes, of course.

575
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:14,800
No, no.

576
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:19,220
It's just the reality is the reality is I'd need something mobile and I still need lots

577
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:22,600
of Linux and it's not going to do those things for me cause I'm not going to get a Mac book

578
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:23,600
from them.

579
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:24,600
All right.

580
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:25,600
All right.

581
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:26,600
All right.

582
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:27,600
All right.

583
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:28,600
There's many, but I'm not, we'll see.

584
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:29,600
We'll see.

585
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:32,480
I think Apple is going to stick with the M1 for the remainder of the year and I'm not

586
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:33,920
really interested in the M1 now.

587
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:36,900
Now I feel like I got to hold out for something better too.

588
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:38,920
So that's what I'm hunkering down for.

589
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:41,580
The Fisher doth protest too much.

590
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:43,440
Maybe it, I am in a weird place with it.

591
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:44,440
I'll tell you that.

592
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:45,440
I can feel it.

593
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:46,440
It feels weird.

594
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:47,440
I don't like it.

595
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,040
I'm uncomfortable with it.

596
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:54,320
And then the other thing that's hard is the lines between GNOME Shell and Mac OS are even

597
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:59,440
blurrier than ever because now GNOME Shell has gone to horizontal workspace layouts and

598
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:02,560
they have the same gesture as Mac OS to get to it.

599
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:04,120
It's just one less finger.

600
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:08,160
It's a three finger gesture instead of a four finger and they move the dock down to the

601
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:14,120
bottom now and the whole thing's feeling a lot like the two, the two interfaces are colliding.

602
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:16,080
It's we've been here before, Sam.

603
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:17,080
Yeah.

604
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:18,080
It's a weird overlap.

605
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:19,080
Scott writes in though.

606
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:21,560
He says, Hey, I changed my mind for JavaScript on the server.

607
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:26,640
I once like Mike was just not having JavaScript on the server.

608
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:30,680
I thought I should always stay in the browser on the client side.

609
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:32,680
Just use it minimally.

610
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:37,740
But my mind changed once I learned about server side rendering and it all clicked.

611
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:42,440
This allows the server to build the fundamentals of a webpage and then just send the browser.

612
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:46,760
Oh, this is not new Scott, this is not new at all.

613
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:50,000
Well he says it's nice cause in the browser gets this nice little thing that it can just

614
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,720
display really super quick.

615
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:55,320
Any additional logic can be, any minimal logic can be done on the client, but the server

616
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:56,640
does the bulk of the work.

617
00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:01,040
He says it doesn't necessarily negate the idea of flask having an API for jazz code

618
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:04,840
and then load additional resources, but he thinks it might be worth considering when

619
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:06,720
you consider server side rendering.

620
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,200
You're not having it though.

621
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:12,560
It's not that I'm not having it, it's that this has existed for a very long time.

622
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:19,200
It's not a new idea and this is how everything like ERB and flask and ginger or I guess ginger

623
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:22,160
would be the flask version of ERB.

624
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:23,160
It's how it all works.

625
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:29,120
The server side builds the page and puts it down to the shithole that is the web.

626
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:34,520
I mean, JavaScript is a language that should not exist.

627
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:36,960
I have written large things in JavaScript.

628
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:41,360
I have had to just delete them and I've lost tens of thousands of dollars.

629
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:42,360
You need a better language.

630
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:45,320
Well, I can't argue with you.

631
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:49,000
I'm not going to be, I'm not, I'm not going to die on this hill for this one.

632
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:55,680
It's I get what you're saying, man, like it's convenient for what you're doing, but it's,

633
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:56,680
it's not good.

634
00:28:56,680 --> 00:29:00,680
Like it's, it's just, geez, you know, I'm not even going to go into the history of server

635
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:06,400
side rendering, but it's not a new idea and it doesn't need to be JavaScript.

636
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:11,660
JavaScript is deeply compromised language we could say.

637
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:21,280
It's not a pure language that has a fundamental philosophy, elegance, purity.

638
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:27,800
We could say, you know, say qua machismo, even I'm just off the top of my head.

639
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:34,000
I'm thinking of a language, your, my criteria, and that might be objective C obviously be

640
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
a good language.

641
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,160
JavaScript is a bad language.

642
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:43,280
I think the fat cat proposes we ban JavaScript from the chat, promise you can't ban JavaScript

643
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:45,720
just like you can't cure herpes.

644
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:48,600
It just won't go away.

645
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:52,360
He said, and then Java Jack says JavaScript is what happens when there's no competition

646
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:56,640
in browser languages, spicy chat room tonight.

647
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:57,800
Coder radio happy hour.

648
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:58,800
I am sorry.

649
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:02,360
I did start it tonight, but my moaning before the show, yes.

650
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:06,360
You know, that's why you got to show up live so that way you can catch the moaning at jblive.tv

651
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:13,040
on a Monday, lino.com slash coder, receive a $100 safety day credit towards your new

652
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:14,040
account.

653
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:16,480
Yeah, a hundred dollars, a hundred dollars.

654
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:17,920
And you support the show.

655
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:18,920
Linode is awesome.

656
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:19,920
It's powerful.

657
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:23,560
And you can simplify your cloud infrastructure with Linode's great prices and modern Linux

658
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:29,000
virtual machines and tools to develop, deploy and scale applications faster and easier than

659
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
ever.

660
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,920
And what I love about Linode is they are independent.

661
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:36,480
We've been around since 2003 and they are in full control.

662
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:38,040
They set their own ISP up.

663
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:39,120
They run their data centers.

664
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:40,840
They have 11 of them around the world.

665
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:45,880
Super fast connections, super fast native SSDs, and of course, 40 gigabit connections

666
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:48,040
coming into each one of those machines.

667
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:50,300
Linode can really help your ideas come to life on the web too.

668
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:54,320
If you want to set up a personal portfolio, maybe you want to put a resume online that

669
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:56,360
looks nice or a status pager.

670
00:30:56,360 --> 00:31:00,020
Maybe you want to host the backend infrastructure for your community's chat platform or something

671
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:05,160
even else that, heck, I don't really know because I'm not you, but I know Linode can

672
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:06,160
do it.

673
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:11,240
They have a full range of systems, dedicated CPUs, dedicated GPUs, $5 a month systems.

674
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:17,400
They're great and they're 30 to 50% cheaper than the big shops like Azure or that AWS

675
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:18,400
you may have heard of.

676
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:22,640
And they have features similar like S3 compatible object storage, cloud firewalls, simple one-click

677
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:25,320
application deployment, and a lot more.

678
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:29,200
So you should probably just go check it out for yourself and see why they are our cloud

679
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:31,320
hosting provider of choice.

680
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:35,260
Everything we've built and all of the things we have continued to build, it's just really

681
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:37,240
gotten pretty, pretty awesome.

682
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:39,060
I should do a machine count at some point.

683
00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:43,320
We run it all on Linode and you can too, linode.com slash coder.

684
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:47,240
I found them a few years ago, started as just something I was doing on my own as a personal

685
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:52,060
thing and now I use them for everything and you can too and you can support the show while

686
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:58,160
getting that $100 credit at linode.com slash coder.

687
00:31:58,160 --> 00:32:00,280
All right, now it's time to talk about it.

688
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:05,160
The Supreme Court has ruled in Google's favor in the copyright dispute with Oracle over

689
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:12,720
the use of the, I think it was like 11,000 lines of code or something.

690
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:20,840
Yeah, it takes back to 2010 when Oracle bought the Java, well bought Sun, and then Java came

691
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:21,840
along with it.

692
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:23,880
I looked back at our archives.

693
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:27,680
This is the story that we've been covering for.

694
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:36,480
Oh yeah, remember Oracle claimed that Google owed them $8.8 billion and $475 million in

695
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:43,440
lost potential licensing revenue and then in 2016 a jury found that Google's use of

696
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:47,960
that structure and sequence and organization of Java APIs was fair use but then the Court

697
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:52,440
of Appeals and the Federal Circuit overturned that decision into Oracle's favor and it just

698
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:54,440
went back and forth what felt like forever.

699
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:58,360
And to be fair, I was initially on Oracle's side because Google literally copy pasted

700
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:01,160
some of the headers and everything.

701
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:04,800
But not that they couldn't use the API but that they should pay some damages for literally

702
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:05,800
copy pasta.

703
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:06,800
Right.

704
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:07,800
Come on.

705
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:11,040
Yeah, it was and the thing I think that we thought was pretty damning was the emails

706
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:14,560
from the executives that kind of just said we're going to do this and we're either going

707
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:17,560
to have to license it or fight them in court one day.

708
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:22,000
If you remember and I did my research today, I actually did my job today, Chris, you should

709
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000
pat me on the back.

710
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,000
Thank you.

711
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,000
Just for you.

712
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,000
I rang the bell.

713
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,080
They could have used C sharp for free, but because they hated Microsoft, they wouldn't

714
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:30,080
do it.

715
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:31,080
Right?

716
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:32,080
Yeah.

717
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:33,080
And there was the sense back then.

718
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:35,080
I mean, you remember back then when they were first starting Android, like the sense was

719
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:38,200
that the whole world of these devices were going to run on Java.

720
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:39,520
Well, hang on.

721
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:43,960
If we're going back, there's only one gentleman that can help us.

722
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:46,200
Perfect.

723
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:48,920
I was thinking Deckard Cain, but you went a different direction.

724
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:51,160
Oh, oh, you mean you like you want to go.

725
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:52,160
You want to share.

726
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:53,800
So that's that's that's story time.

727
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:56,120
Stay a while and listen.

728
00:33:56,120 --> 00:34:01,920
Back in the day, Microsoft was actually a scary company, but now they're a little hippie

729
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:06,720
company that runs Azure, but they used to put companies out of business.

730
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:10,000
Yeah, kids, Microsoft was actually scary at one point.

731
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,000
Yeah.

732
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:14,480
And I guess there was also this feeling at Google that like Microsoft was the big bad

733
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:15,480
guy.

734
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:18,360
The world was going to run all these like I remember Blu-ray players back then were

735
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:19,360
running Java.

736
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:21,620
Like everything was going to be Java based.

737
00:34:21,620 --> 00:34:23,520
Everything that Microsoft did was bad.

738
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:29,240
And I think that they figured, well, we'll we'll we'll swoop up a huge amount of developers

739
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:31,280
who can already target our platform.

740
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:34,200
That'll get us in the race against Apple as fast as possible.

741
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:35,880
From India that are cheap, yes.

742
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:39,600
But yeah, you and I both thought, boy, Oracle could win this, but it would be bad if they

743
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:40,600
did.

744
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:44,120
And I actually thought there was a good shot that Oracle was going to win.

745
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:47,240
I couldn't really comprehend what the knock on effects of that would be.

746
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:48,880
But so it's on tape, right?

747
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:54,920
Like I was pretty pissed about this because I felt like just stealing Java.

748
00:34:54,920 --> 00:35:00,360
The problem was Google was kind of right, but I didn't like what they were doing because

749
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:05,320
this is going to sound super old managed, but Objective C at the time requiring memory

750
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:10,240
management allowed me just to charge a lot of money that made me very happy.

751
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:13,800
It seemed like they knew there was some questionable activity to it.

752
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:16,560
Like they kind of had a sense that maybe they were in a gray area.

753
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:19,960
Well, in their emails, they knew.

754
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:26,320
What we have here is kind of like a half decision, though, because the question is are APIs copyrightable?

755
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:28,080
That's been skirted by the court here.

756
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:34,860
They focused on fair use and they didn't really establish the copyright precedent.

757
00:35:34,860 --> 00:35:39,240
It's like the case establishes a precedent that if you're copying an API and its primary

758
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:44,240
purpose is matching interface so the developers can re-implement it, you're in fair use territory,

759
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:48,600
which it doesn't really answer the primary question of the copyright violation.

760
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:55,160
So I have a service that copies the API for AWS S3.

761
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:57,240
I have not talked about this on the show because.

762
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:58,960
Oh, you mean you really do?

763
00:35:58,960 --> 00:35:59,960
I really do.

764
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:00,960
For real.

765
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:01,960
Oh, okay.

766
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:02,960
That's theoretical.

767
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:04,400
I've seen Bezos' pecker, let's say.

768
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:05,880
Thank you, Reddit.

769
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:09,080
And I'm pretty sure he would slam that right up my bum.

770
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:12,000
No, you can, I mean, you can.

771
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,280
I run an object storage.

772
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:14,400
Right now, right?

773
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:19,400
I could have the exact same programmable interface and my whole thing I do with this is go to

774
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:24,400
people that are spending a lot of money on S3 so we can set you up in our data center.

775
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:31,200
Literally, you change the API keys, you change the endpoint, the secret key, all that nonsense

776
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:35,560
and bam, you're saving thousands of dollars a year.

777
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:39,080
Yeah, and it can also, like in some cases, yeah, you work with a smaller business that

778
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:42,240
can be more hands-on, that can be more attentive.

779
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:47,280
And we can offer you added custom benefits, like whatever crazy stuff you need.

780
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:52,960
So like I'm spiritually on the side of Oracle with this, but I felt like Google was so brazen

781
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:53,960
in how they did it.

782
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:56,520
I mean, we listened to the back catalog, folks.

783
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:59,080
I was pretty rough on Google.

784
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:03,480
And Chris was, I mean, Chris said Microsoft was great and we should all run Windows Vista

785
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:04,480
at the time.

786
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:05,480
So I don't know.

787
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:08,080
I mean, like, and I did that like every episode, it was weird.

788
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:13,040
I just want to say YouTube, Google, I'm sorry, Windows Action Show.

789
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:19,600
Yeah, joking aside, I feel like I sort of, this is anti-climactic in a way, right?

790
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:21,160
It doesn't matter.

791
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:22,160
Nothing happened.

792
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:24,440
Yeah, I mean, well, it matters.

793
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:32,840
I think it matters in that if it had gone the other way, then it meant that implementing

794
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:41,560
an identical API could have set precedent that that is a copyrightable court case that

795
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:42,560
you could pursue.

796
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:43,560
What are you talking about?

797
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:46,040
When I was 19, I tried to open Mercury Broadcasting.

798
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:52,400
But you know what I mean, like if Oracle had won, it would have set a precedent that other

799
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:55,560
companies could have sued other individuals who have re-implemented their APIs.

800
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:56,560
Well, hang on.

801
00:37:56,560 --> 00:38:03,880
If Oracle had won, then Minio as an open source project would fail, and as a company.

802
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:08,600
Oracle database, which was a clone of IBM database right from the interface layer, would

803
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:11,120
itself be invalid.

804
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:15,440
Because let's Deckard Cain style go back here.

805
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:21,600
Oracle's original business was being a clone of IBM's proprietary databases, but a little

806
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:22,600
cheaper.

807
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:23,600
Yeah, I hadn't thought it.

808
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:24,600
You're right.

809
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:25,600
I hadn't thought about that in a while.

810
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:28,240
This is the courtesan calling the prostitute a whore.

811
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:29,800
I mean, this is not right.

812
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:36,200
Yeah, it is kind of, you know, but I guess companies change, I suppose.

813
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:37,520
But there is some irony in that.

814
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:38,520
It's very simple.

815
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:42,720
When you're small, you have to work outside the law because you have nothing to lose.

816
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:47,360
When you're big, like by the way, we don't talk about this on this show because Unfilter

817
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:48,360
exists.

818
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:55,320
But Facebook suggesting internet regulations is like the Nazis suggesting housing regulations.

819
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:56,760
It's just not good.

820
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:57,760
You don't want it.

821
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:58,760
Yeah, they have lobbyists.

822
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:01,880
So that's something they can shape.

823
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:08,040
When I think about my feelings over the last nearly a decade of this thing, I think a piece

824
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:15,720
of me wanted Google to have to pay some penance for the stunt they pulled with Android.

825
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:17,880
I can't ever forgive them for Android.

826
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:22,320
It is a bastardization of Linux that is horrible.

827
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:25,440
And they made so many decisions in the name of adoption.

828
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:26,440
It just doesn't work.

829
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:31,600
Well, you go back to, remember, they were going with something that was cursor driven

830
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:35,200
until they saw the iPhone event and then they switched to their Moonshot project, which

831
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:36,200
was touch driven.

832
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:39,420
But Android, when it first shipped, you could still dig out the cursor.

833
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:41,520
It was very much still very touch focused.

834
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:42,840
How about Project Butter?

835
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:43,840
Right.

836
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:46,080
All the time, all the times they had to address the performance.

837
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:50,080
They slapped together this system that was horribly unoptimized.

838
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:54,360
I mean, the early versions of Android were really bad because it was not native code

839
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:55,900
running on these.

840
00:39:55,900 --> 00:40:01,040
So folks who are younger won't remember these ARM processors on mobile were back in the

841
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:02,040
day.

842
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:03,040
They were terrible.

843
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:04,040
Really bad.

844
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:05,040
Yeah.

845
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:06,040
Yeah.

846
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:08,040
The reason iPhone programming was hard and I got to make lots of money doing it is because

847
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:10,240
you had no memory.

848
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:12,160
It was terrible.

849
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:18,140
Loading images in a list view or UI scroll view, if you will, was actually like you.

850
00:40:18,140 --> 00:40:23,300
People had different strategies and I'm sure you can find them on Reddit.

851
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:28,120
There were blog posts debating what is the right way to load images on iOS because you

852
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:30,480
didn't have the memory to do it.

853
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:31,480
Come on.

854
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:32,480
You know this is true.

855
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:33,480
Oh yeah.

856
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:34,720
And it was so much worse on Android.

857
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:39,660
And then you'll recall, I don't need to recap history, but the incredible compromises they

858
00:40:39,660 --> 00:40:43,960
made with carriers to get great sweetheart deals with the carriers to compete with the

859
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:49,520
iPhone, like allowing carriers to bastardize up the firmwares with their crappy apps and

860
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:56,360
tracking that they crossed all these lines in the name of adoption that I felt like created

861
00:40:56,360 --> 00:41:02,720
a product that didn't learn anything from the Windows PC OEM era that makes shipping

862
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:05,040
updates easy and fast and secure.

863
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:12,120
And we ended up with an OS that's now in reality in the pockets of millions of consumers with

864
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:17,680
out of date Linux kernels, out of date Bluetooth stacks, tons of vulnerabilities, vendors who

865
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:22,600
stopped patching because they didn't have some driver licensing deal that went beyond

866
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:25,640
two years so they couldn't supply updates past that.

867
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:31,080
And so now it just gets no fixes and it just sits there open on the internet every single

868
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:32,080
day.

869
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:34,860
And there are millions of them.

870
00:41:34,860 --> 00:41:42,640
And then you bring in all of the crap around this that this Oracle suit, which was another

871
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:49,000
example of Google cutting corners to try to get fast, quick adoption to slam something

872
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,000
into the market.

873
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:54,800
So then that way they could get all of these hardware manufacturers to switch over to their

874
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:59,000
crappy platform and have a horrible fight race to the bottom.

875
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:03,840
LG, by the way, just announced this week they're out of the smartphone business entirely.

876
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:05,280
That's all Google had.

877
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:09,040
Google dumped an operating system on the market that drove the value down, that created a

878
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:14,720
race to the bottom, that created manufacturers to make these horrible deals, these totally

879
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:18,220
unsupported phones, and now the market is awash in them.

880
00:42:18,220 --> 00:42:22,240
And what makes me sick about it is it's all on the back of Linux.

881
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:26,480
Linux is at the core of all of these and it's a bastardization of what is a beautiful operating

882
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:32,880
system that could deliver a secure, free user experience and instead has been perverted

883
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:39,360
by Google for this use, all while getting their backs patted by the open source community,

884
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:45,720
loving them every step of the way for their open source stance and their open source support

885
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:47,620
and their summer of code.

886
00:42:47,620 --> 00:42:52,240
And so we never questioned the almighty Google, even though they've taken the beautiful platform

887
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:59,400
that is Linux and they've weaponized it as a tracking platform as, and now not intentionally,

888
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:00,840
an exploit paradise.

889
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:02,960
But it's all on the back of Linux and I hate it.

890
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:07,880
They've turned it into slow, the fact that they spent years trying to perfect a goddamn

891
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:08,880
scroll view.

892
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:14,820
I'm sorry, but no, I know it seems like I'm being mean, but that is a stupid problem to

893
00:43:14,820 --> 00:43:15,820
have.

894
00:43:15,820 --> 00:43:16,820
Yeah, it's just been a bad product.

895
00:43:16,820 --> 00:43:22,300
And you know what, by the time they finally get it fairly decent, which it's in a pretty

896
00:43:22,300 --> 00:43:26,840
good state now, I enjoy my Pixel, but it's still not as good as iOS.

897
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:30,240
You know what, if somebody comes to me with a business ID and they have an Android, I

898
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:32,800
just ignore them.

899
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:33,800
You just decide right there.

900
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:34,920
Oh, they got an Android wear watch.

901
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:35,920
I won't let them in the door.

902
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:37,200
And I'm not even joking.

903
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:38,960
I've read VC posts.

904
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:44,080
People say if a founder comes to me as an Android, no, I don't know how I feel about

905
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:45,080
that.

906
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:46,960
It's about taste and you can look that up.

907
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:50,080
I feel like they've done a better job with Chrome OS that was just brought up by the

908
00:43:50,080 --> 00:43:51,080
chat room.

909
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:56,000
I feel like that's been better managed by Google from OS, you know what the good mobile

910
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,000
OS was?

911
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:58,000
Yeah.

912
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,000
Web OS.

913
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,080
Web OS was never going to happen.

914
00:44:01,080 --> 00:44:02,080
Windows Phone 8.

915
00:44:02,080 --> 00:44:03,920
No, it had a registry, dude.

916
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:05,020
It's out right there.

917
00:44:05,020 --> 00:44:07,680
If it has a registry, it's not on my, it's not going in my pocket.

918
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:08,680
This is not happening.

919
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:11,720
Yeah, but web OS was actually the good one and come on.

920
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:12,720
It was from HP.

921
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:15,800
It was never going to happen.

922
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:21,000
For some reason, the Google YouTube algorithm thingy decided to show me commercials of the

923
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:24,280
Compaq iPack from that era.

924
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:28,400
So the late nineties, I guess, in my feed and for whatever reason it was right and I

925
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:31,400
watched it and man, I had one of those.

926
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:33,080
I actually really liked it.

927
00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:36,760
If you were in that ecosystem and you had like the exchange integration, it was, it

928
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:37,760
was pretty cool.

929
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:41,320
I just want to say I was a Windows 95 power user.

930
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:42,320
Oh yeah.

931
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:44,720
Did you actually, you know, you gotta get the plus pack then so that way you get the

932
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:45,720
themes and stuff.

933
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:47,880
Oh no, I upgraded from 3.1.

934
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:52,000
And then, and then you had to get the Windows 95 like OSR 2 or whatever it was where they

935
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,560
added USB support.

936
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:55,080
I couldn't do it.

937
00:44:55,080 --> 00:44:57,320
I was on Windows 95.

938
00:44:57,320 --> 00:44:58,520
But then I got a gateway.

939
00:44:58,520 --> 00:44:59,520
Oh yeah.

940
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:00,520
Cowbox.

941
00:45:00,520 --> 00:45:01,520
Yep.

942
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:02,840
Fuckin' the CAS bar.

943
00:45:02,840 --> 00:45:05,320
But then I upgraded to Windows 98.

944
00:45:05,320 --> 00:45:06,320
What's wrong?

945
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:07,320
Maybe it was great.

946
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:08,320
Didn't work?

947
00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:09,320
It was slow.

948
00:45:09,320 --> 00:45:10,320
Oh yeah.

949
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:11,320
You definitely felt it back then.

950
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:12,320
Felt it.

951
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:13,320
Especially on low end systems.

952
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:15,920
You, you and my systems were low.

953
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:16,920
Yeah.

954
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:17,920
You felt the pain.

955
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:18,920
Yeah, you really felt it.

956
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:19,920
Mm hmm.

957
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:20,920
Yeah.

958
00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:22,600
It was one of those things where like we were, you know, reminds me of the email we got earlier

959
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:23,600
in the show.

960
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:25,880
It's like you have no idea back then.

961
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:27,300
I mean, it sold new machines.

962
00:45:27,300 --> 00:45:30,240
People would just buy it back then when a new Windows would come out.

963
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:33,440
That's when people just buy entirely new PCs with Windows preloaded on it.

964
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:37,280
Then I sort of skipped Vista because I wasn't crazy.

965
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:38,720
Then I went to seven.

966
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:41,080
Then I went to Mac and Linux.

967
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:44,120
And I'm not going to talk about the machine I'm on now because people will send me hate

968
00:45:44,120 --> 00:45:45,120
mail.

969
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:46,120
Well, besides, you got to replace that thing anyway.

970
00:45:46,120 --> 00:45:48,600
It's got those dirty x86 processors in it, right?

971
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:50,840
I've done some benchmarks on my MacBook Air.

972
00:45:50,840 --> 00:45:51,840
It's not great.

973
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:52,840
Yeah.

974
00:45:52,840 --> 00:45:53,840
Oh yeah.

975
00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:54,840
Oh good.

976
00:45:54,840 --> 00:45:56,120
Let's do a little anti-M1 for a moment.

977
00:45:56,120 --> 00:45:58,000
So the iMac Pro crushed it, huh?

978
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,000
No, no, no.

979
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,080
Oh, no, that's not what happened.

980
00:46:01,080 --> 00:46:02,200
Oh, damn it.

981
00:46:02,200 --> 00:46:04,960
It's the iMac Pro has a beautiful screen.

982
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:05,960
Uh-huh.

983
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:06,960
Yeah.

984
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:08,280
But did it beat it on the CPU test?

985
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:09,760
Tell me it beat the M1.

986
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:12,840
It's my special little computer and I love it very much.

987
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:15,440
You're not answering the question, which I think means that it didn't.

988
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:17,480
Oh, I didn't need to hear that.

989
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:19,640
Unless the GPU becomes involved.

990
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:20,900
Ah, yeah, sure.

991
00:46:20,900 --> 00:46:22,080
The air is faster.

992
00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:27,880
Number one out for the x86.

993
00:46:27,880 --> 00:46:34,240
Honestly if I was Intel CEO right now, I would not be making snarky commercials with Justin

994
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:35,240
Long.

995
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:37,120
I would be at the bar crying.

996
00:46:37,120 --> 00:46:41,120
That might be my character flaw.

997
00:46:41,120 --> 00:46:43,360
Maybe you can do both, you know, but he is the CEO of Intel.

998
00:46:43,360 --> 00:46:44,360
You can probably do both.

999
00:46:44,360 --> 00:46:45,680
But do you need Justin Long?

1000
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:46,680
I mean.

1001
00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:47,680
No.

1002
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:48,680
No, it does.

1003
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:49,680
It's bad too, right?

1004
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:54,280
I mean, the funny thing is, is like you're so he's he's essentially getting on products

1005
00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:57,840
that still are shipping with Intel processors and like they still I mean the whole thing's

1006
00:46:57,840 --> 00:46:58,840
like they're making funny.

1007
00:46:58,840 --> 00:47:02,400
They're making fun of MacBooks, but they're still MacBooks selling with Intel processors.

1008
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:03,400
It was an awkward moment.

1009
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:08,520
Like I just want to say making an advertising campaign campaign dunking on one of your biggest

1010
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:11,440
customers seems super stupid to me.

1011
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:12,920
I don't know.

1012
00:47:12,920 --> 00:47:13,920
Yeah.

1013
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:14,920
Yeah.

1014
00:47:14,920 --> 00:47:16,400
What do we know?

1015
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:18,320
Datadog.com slash coder radio.

1016
00:47:18,320 --> 00:47:19,320
You know what?

1017
00:47:19,320 --> 00:47:23,740
Get your code level performance, get it across your entire environment, the whole stack and

1018
00:47:23,740 --> 00:47:27,160
troubleshoot issues faster with Datadog.

1019
00:47:27,160 --> 00:47:30,240
Datadog's continuous profiler does something amazing.

1020
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:34,200
It automatically collects profiles from your production servers and your applications all

1021
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:39,400
the time so you can analyze any data from any source at any point in time quickly with

1022
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:46,400
minimal overhead and then pop, get it a whole unified picture with their beautiful dashboards

1023
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:50,160
correlated with code performance metrics and other monitoring data from your servers in

1024
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:53,560
these real time beautiful dashboards.

1025
00:47:53,560 --> 00:47:58,040
You got to go to datadog.com slash coder radio to see these dashboards and when you're there,

1026
00:47:58,040 --> 00:48:03,880
you sign up for a 14 day free trial and you will get a free t-shirt after you create one

1027
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:05,560
of those beautiful dashboards.

1028
00:48:05,560 --> 00:48:11,700
You get the dashboard beauty and the t-shirt, but you got to go to datadog.com slash coder

1029
00:48:11,700 --> 00:48:12,800
radio for that.

1030
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:17,880
See the log management, the tracing, that continuous profiler in action and see how

1031
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:21,200
great it is to bring it all into one platform.

1032
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:26,480
Datadog enables you to pinpoint the root cause of issues faster than ever and it's a tool

1033
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:28,400
to help you communicate.

1034
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:30,460
Go try Datadog's products for free.

1035
00:48:30,460 --> 00:48:35,600
Get that 14 day trial by visiting datadog.com slash coder radio and for a limited time,

1036
00:48:35,600 --> 00:48:40,080
if you start a trial and you create that one dashboard, you'll get that free Datadog t-shirt

1037
00:48:40,080 --> 00:48:42,640
free swag.

1038
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:48,860
Are you going over to the WWDC website right now to make your plans because it's been announced.

1039
00:48:48,860 --> 00:48:51,760
We now know it's going to be virtual again this year.

1040
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:57,880
They are leaning in hard on the Craig Federighi staring at his laptop in a weird way and they've

1041
00:48:57,880 --> 00:49:04,040
announced it'll be June 7th to the 11th for the all online program open to everybody free

1042
00:49:04,040 --> 00:49:11,520
at no cost and even if you're not a Apple developer or even interested in any particular

1043
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:15,560
thing from Apple, it's kind of fascinating to watch this from a production standpoint

1044
00:49:15,560 --> 00:49:20,600
because boy howdy, if these aren't just the peak of virtual conference production, like

1045
00:49:20,600 --> 00:49:23,060
nobody does it like these guys do.

1046
00:49:23,060 --> 00:49:27,140
They also this year are doing a Swift student challenge and they're going to have additional

1047
00:49:27,140 --> 00:49:28,140
details on that.

1048
00:49:28,140 --> 00:49:33,080
So teaching the young ones the Swift, it's a big focus at WWDC.

1049
00:49:33,080 --> 00:49:34,440
Gotta get the young ones learned up.

1050
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:38,040
I guess if you hate children, that might be a thing you would do.

1051
00:49:38,040 --> 00:49:45,320
No, but I mean, I obviously would love someone to look at me like Craig Federighi looks at

1052
00:49:45,320 --> 00:49:46,320
the MacBook Air.

1053
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:48,680
I mean, who doesn't want that?

1054
00:49:48,680 --> 00:49:53,560
And yes, I'm going to WWDC and no, I don't think there's going to be AR glasses because

1055
00:49:53,560 --> 00:49:55,960
battery life.

1056
00:49:55,960 --> 00:50:00,000
This is the shit about the Apple community that is so annoying.

1057
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:08,180
The incessant yammering on about like VR goggles or AR or will Apple build a car?

1058
00:50:08,180 --> 00:50:09,560
Like get over yourselves.

1059
00:50:09,560 --> 00:50:12,260
Like who just wait and see what they ship.

1060
00:50:12,260 --> 00:50:14,060
Like this is like the community.

1061
00:50:14,060 --> 00:50:20,120
There's so much palace intrigue type stories and rumor mill and they have a giant processor

1062
00:50:20,120 --> 00:50:21,440
transition they're doing.

1063
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:23,280
Yeah, they are not shipping.

1064
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:28,760
And first of all, the glasses have a particular problem of the boundaries of physics with

1065
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:29,760
battery life.

1066
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:35,720
And unless they have some amazing battery technology, which honestly, if they have it,

1067
00:50:35,720 --> 00:50:39,520
they should license it to everybody because that would change humanity.

1068
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:40,520
Really?

1069
00:50:40,520 --> 00:50:41,520
Yeah.

1070
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:42,520
Let's share it.

1071
00:50:42,520 --> 00:50:43,520
Share it with the world, right?

1072
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:44,520
Seriously.

1073
00:50:44,520 --> 00:50:45,520
No, no, no.

1074
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:49,520
I'm not being a dick to get such battery capacity in such a small package would be a significant

1075
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:53,240
leap in like actual battery physics, right?

1076
00:50:53,240 --> 00:50:57,280
Actual like the science of storing energy that would be different, like they would be

1077
00:50:57,280 --> 00:51:03,200
dunking on Elon Musk like he was the, you know, junior university basketball team in

1078
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:04,360
their shack.

1079
00:51:04,360 --> 00:51:08,200
But if we return to reality, they don't have that.

1080
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:10,980
There's not going to be air glasses.

1081
00:51:10,980 --> 00:51:13,360
So it's so annoying.

1082
00:51:13,360 --> 00:51:16,720
If you think if this isn't just the way they shouldn't just do this, because I'll tell

1083
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:21,320
you what, man, you get a lot more information this way because you don't have to pay a thousand

1084
00:51:21,320 --> 00:51:22,480
dollars to go.

1085
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:25,880
It makes it way more accessible to people that are considering getting in development.

1086
00:51:25,880 --> 00:51:30,400
It makes it way more accessible to children specifically who could never get access to

1087
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:33,200
this stuff because they sometimes, you know, they're not old enough to have credit cards

1088
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:34,200
and whatnot.

1089
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:40,080
I think like there is a big net benefit to make this open to all.

1090
00:51:40,080 --> 00:51:46,240
And instead of this, like this, like exclusive, only like two thousand people to four thousand

1091
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:47,840
people can make it there.

1092
00:51:47,840 --> 00:51:50,640
And it's a thousand dollar ticket and the price is only going to go up because there's

1093
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:52,840
less and less space available.

1094
00:51:52,840 --> 00:51:55,500
I appreciate the value of those in-person events.

1095
00:51:55,500 --> 00:51:58,400
You know me, I really understand the value.

1096
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:03,880
But this seems like a net improvement for everyone because even a casual like me can

1097
00:52:03,880 --> 00:52:08,120
attend these and I can feel more informed and I like to have the technical details of

1098
00:52:08,120 --> 00:52:09,120
things.

1099
00:52:09,120 --> 00:52:10,980
I am conflicted.

1100
00:52:10,980 --> 00:52:14,500
As a dev, I feel like the online format is better.

1101
00:52:14,500 --> 00:52:19,600
But as a sales guy or like a business owner, I guess, which is really a glorified sales

1102
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:20,800
guy, right?

1103
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:26,920
There's something about the conference, like pub scene, you know, the hall track, right?

1104
00:52:26,920 --> 00:52:31,160
Having said that, WWDC, I mean, I don't want to be too negative.

1105
00:52:31,160 --> 00:52:35,400
If there's a good API that I think I could build a cool app on, I'm going to do it.

1106
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:36,400
Absolutely.

1107
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:37,400
Right.

1108
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:38,960
And I'm going to walk this whole thing and I'm going to be on the hunt for something

1109
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:40,080
like that.

1110
00:52:40,080 --> 00:52:46,320
But my entire problem, like I'm a, you know, you know this, Chris, I'm a huge iPad believer.

1111
00:52:46,320 --> 00:52:49,280
But the problems are Apple's policies, not the technology.

1112
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:53,280
I mean, I don't want to say I'm not going to build something on iOS because obviously

1113
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:58,600
you know me, I get excited and I do something and then I don't ship it because I'm crazy.

1114
00:52:58,600 --> 00:53:01,680
Coder bytes is not coming because of trademark reasons, by the way.

1115
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:03,320
So it will be something else.

1116
00:53:03,320 --> 00:53:04,320
Oh, man.

1117
00:53:04,320 --> 00:53:05,680
We'll get another.

1118
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:08,140
I'm sure there'll be another name out there that'll work.

1119
00:53:08,140 --> 00:53:12,160
It's going to be a coder balls inappropriate.

1120
00:53:12,160 --> 00:53:15,360
Past Mike was wise, you know, past Mike was much calmer.

1121
00:53:15,360 --> 00:53:18,680
No, but I mean, are you excited for WWDC?

1122
00:53:18,680 --> 00:53:19,920
I mean, I kind of don't give a crap.

1123
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:20,920
No, I actually am.

1124
00:53:20,920 --> 00:53:21,920
I am.

1125
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:22,920
It's the home pods.

1126
00:53:22,920 --> 00:53:26,480
It's the it's the it's the cumulative radiation from all those home pods.

1127
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:28,840
OK, no, it's not the home pods.

1128
00:53:28,840 --> 00:53:31,120
But I think they I think they're delivering.

1129
00:53:31,120 --> 00:53:34,400
I think the iOS platform is looking better than ever.

1130
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:35,840
I find it fascinating.

1131
00:53:35,840 --> 00:53:40,960
The last couple of WWDCs we've seen them allow some major changes to iOS we hadn't seen in

1132
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:41,960
the past.

1133
00:53:41,960 --> 00:53:43,360
I think the M1 platform is going to get iterated on.

1134
00:53:43,360 --> 00:53:45,280
That'll be interesting.

1135
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:48,660
And then I think they'll probably send me into some sort of existential crisis and panic

1136
00:53:48,660 --> 00:53:52,200
when I worry that Linux users will leave us all.

1137
00:53:52,200 --> 00:53:54,640
But you know, I've I've calmed down.

1138
00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:55,640
I've calmed down.

1139
00:53:55,640 --> 00:53:59,960
I think I think there is a good a good portion of Linux users out there who will never be

1140
00:53:59,960 --> 00:54:02,640
swayed by the shinies of Apple, regardless of what they do.

1141
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:06,520
And I have good news for those of us on the platform, Mike.

1142
00:54:06,520 --> 00:54:13,760
This has been sorely needed, a library that essentially plays a role in just defining

1143
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:16,020
the visual language of a GNOME application.

1144
00:54:16,020 --> 00:54:18,120
You want to make a GNOME application.

1145
00:54:18,120 --> 00:54:24,840
You can use Lib Adwaitia to now do that, sort of like elementary OS's Granite.

1146
00:54:24,840 --> 00:54:28,760
This is going to be something that's available to all GTK developers.

1147
00:54:28,760 --> 00:54:31,120
It'll track specific releases with GNOME.

1148
00:54:31,120 --> 00:54:36,320
So you can target like a GNOME 40 look or a GNOME 42 look, and they'll include guidelines

1149
00:54:36,320 --> 00:54:37,880
as well as code.

1150
00:54:37,880 --> 00:54:42,080
And the idea will be a library that kind of grows over time that gives developers an ability

1151
00:54:42,080 --> 00:54:47,380
to get some of the basics of a standard GNOME application without having to lay out every

1152
00:54:47,380 --> 00:54:49,840
single button themselves and decide where it all goes.

1153
00:54:49,840 --> 00:54:54,240
It's like the missing library that the desktop environment needed to get application developers

1154
00:54:54,240 --> 00:54:55,240
started quicker.

1155
00:54:55,240 --> 00:54:56,240
Yay.

1156
00:54:56,240 --> 00:54:57,240
Here I come.

1157
00:54:57,240 --> 00:55:00,960
I bring my nice little thing and I say, look, Daddy, they finally did it.

1158
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:02,720
They fixed the complaint of yours.

1159
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:04,360
And you give me nothing.

1160
00:55:04,360 --> 00:55:09,680
You you smack it out of my hand and you just tell me to piss off.

1161
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:12,840
Well, let me ask you, how many users are going to pay for that software you built with that

1162
00:55:12,840 --> 00:55:13,840
library?

1163
00:55:13,840 --> 00:55:14,840
Oh, well, OK.

1164
00:55:14,840 --> 00:55:15,840
I mean, there's, you know.

1165
00:55:15,840 --> 00:55:16,840
Yeah.

1166
00:55:16,840 --> 00:55:17,840
OK.

1167
00:55:17,840 --> 00:55:18,840
All right.

1168
00:55:18,840 --> 00:55:19,840
I admit I acknowledge the payment.

1169
00:55:19,840 --> 00:55:20,840
Things a little tricky.

1170
00:55:20,840 --> 00:55:21,840
I grant.

1171
00:55:21,840 --> 00:55:22,840
Tricky.

1172
00:55:22,840 --> 00:55:23,840
It's tricky.

1173
00:55:23,840 --> 00:55:25,400
I would call it the battle.

1174
00:55:25,400 --> 00:55:26,400
Hmm.

1175
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:27,400
Look, battle.

1176
00:55:27,400 --> 00:55:28,400
Hang on.

1177
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:29,400
The six day now.

1178
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:30,400
Hmm.

1179
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:31,400
Hang on.

1180
00:55:31,400 --> 00:55:32,400
What was the complete route?

1181
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:33,400
Oh, the Alamo.

1182
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:34,400
Oh, yeah.

1183
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:36,440
Actually, the Alamo, they held up for a while.

1184
00:55:36,440 --> 00:55:37,440
Hang on.

1185
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:39,560
Well, a lot of apps do and then they finally fall.

1186
00:55:39,560 --> 00:55:40,560
That does happen.

1187
00:55:40,560 --> 00:55:42,560
Oh, it's France in World War Two.

1188
00:55:42,560 --> 00:55:43,560
Right down.

1189
00:55:43,560 --> 00:55:44,560
Sorry, French people.

1190
00:55:44,560 --> 00:55:45,560
I'm not sorry.

1191
00:55:45,560 --> 00:55:46,560
My stepfather is French.

1192
00:55:46,560 --> 00:55:50,640
So you know what we need is we need somebody, somebody to help me prove Mike wrong.

1193
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:54,980
If you're if you're writing Linux applications for the desktop right now and you're making

1194
00:55:54,980 --> 00:55:56,040
profits off from it.

1195
00:55:56,040 --> 00:56:00,360
I bought a Linux developers company for less than a month of my current rep.

1196
00:56:00,360 --> 00:56:01,360
So.

1197
00:56:01,360 --> 00:56:02,360
So.

1198
00:56:02,360 --> 00:56:03,360
So tell me.

1199
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:04,360
I want to.

1200
00:56:04,360 --> 00:56:05,360
I want to.

1201
00:56:05,360 --> 00:56:06,360
We're talking desktop Linux here.

1202
00:56:06,360 --> 00:56:07,360
Yeah.

1203
00:56:07,360 --> 00:56:08,360
Somebody making a desktop Linux app.

1204
00:56:08,360 --> 00:56:09,360
Remail it and tell us.

1205
00:56:09,360 --> 00:56:13,400
I'm a desktop Linux developer and you are making more than seventy five thousand dollars

1206
00:56:13,400 --> 00:56:18,560
a year selling exclusive only selling exclusive desktop Linux apps.

1207
00:56:18,560 --> 00:56:19,560
Only.

1208
00:56:19,560 --> 00:56:20,560
Why would you limit yourself?

1209
00:56:20,560 --> 00:56:21,560
Why not make yourself?

1210
00:56:21,560 --> 00:56:26,040
I mean, what if I think Linux has to represent a significant portion of revenue, but to limit

1211
00:56:26,040 --> 00:56:27,040
it to only seems.

1212
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:28,040
No, no, no, no.

1213
00:56:28,040 --> 00:56:32,320
You got to make at least seventy five thousand on desktop Linux apps.

1214
00:56:32,320 --> 00:56:33,320
I will.

1215
00:56:33,320 --> 00:56:36,120
And I'm doing this publicly on tape to challenge right now.

1216
00:56:36,120 --> 00:56:41,920
I and the Mad about our ink will sell you or not sell you, give you a Thalia from system

1217
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:47,680
seventy six brand new for you and a quarter radio robe if Chris can get off his ass and

1218
00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:49,060
actually ship them.

1219
00:56:49,060 --> 00:56:54,320
And if you can't do that, we'll give you stickers and a poster because I guarantee that no one

1220
00:56:54,320 --> 00:56:55,320
exists.

1221
00:56:55,320 --> 00:57:00,120
And when I say developer, I mean, an independent developer, a small team, not you.

1222
00:57:00,120 --> 00:57:04,560
You can't say, hey, I work at Red Hat and I listen to the show and ha ha ha or, you

1223
00:57:04,560 --> 00:57:06,560
know, my sister brothers.

1224
00:57:06,560 --> 00:57:10,880
I want an indie indie developer selling an app.

1225
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:12,440
I don't care what it is.

1226
00:57:12,440 --> 00:57:16,720
And then if OK, so if you win, you essentially don't have to give away Thalia.

1227
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:19,920
But if you lose, you got to ship somebody a computer.

1228
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:24,120
But if I if I lose, what are you going to give them, Chris?

1229
00:57:24,120 --> 00:57:27,160
J.B. should support the Linux developer community.

1230
00:57:27,160 --> 00:57:28,160
Right.

1231
00:57:28,160 --> 00:57:32,760
The Mad Vodder is already in maybe like a swag box of like retro swag or something.

1232
00:57:32,760 --> 00:57:37,160
Maybe in the Mad Vodder partner, I'll I'll buy you the very expensive computer and he'll

1233
00:57:37,160 --> 00:57:38,560
give you some stickers.

1234
00:57:38,560 --> 00:57:39,560
That sounds about right.

1235
00:57:39,560 --> 00:57:40,560
No, no, no.

1236
00:57:40,560 --> 00:57:41,560
It'll be a high value.

1237
00:57:41,560 --> 00:57:43,880
It'll be is the highest value I can fit in the box.

1238
00:57:43,880 --> 00:57:45,760
I just don't know which size box it is yet.

1239
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:47,400
Highest value thing he has is the rope.

1240
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:48,400
Those ropes are.

1241
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:49,400
Yes.

1242
00:57:49,400 --> 00:57:51,920
Basically, they should be sewn in gold at this point.

1243
00:57:51,920 --> 00:57:55,320
I just I know we did this at the beginning of the show.

1244
00:57:55,320 --> 00:57:56,320
What were you thinking?

1245
00:57:56,320 --> 00:58:02,120
And I thought I thought it was a challenge to myself and also saying, come on, right

1246
00:58:02,120 --> 00:58:03,120
into the show.

1247
00:58:03,120 --> 00:58:04,720
You know that this can't be done.

1248
00:58:04,720 --> 00:58:05,720
I think it's.

1249
00:58:05,720 --> 00:58:06,720
Yeah, I think it is.

1250
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:08,040
I I God, I would love to.

1251
00:58:08,040 --> 00:58:09,040
I would.

1252
00:58:09,040 --> 00:58:10,040
What?

1253
00:58:10,040 --> 00:58:14,880
OK, if I recall, I actually hired a desktop Linux developer for less than my current rent.

1254
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:19,200
You know, we need to do is we've got to like set like a limit because what if like three

1255
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:20,200
dudes right in?

1256
00:58:20,200 --> 00:58:21,200
No, just one.

1257
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:22,200
The first one who does it?

1258
00:58:22,200 --> 00:58:23,200
No, no, no.

1259
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:24,200
It's first to the finish.

1260
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:25,200
But you're not even worried about that.

1261
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:26,200
That's not going to be a problem.

1262
00:58:26,200 --> 00:58:27,580
It's not going to happen.

1263
00:58:27,580 --> 00:58:30,280
And I want to see receipts where to sell them.

1264
00:58:30,280 --> 00:58:32,240
And it can't be like steam, right?

1265
00:58:32,240 --> 00:58:37,000
It has to be verifiable Linux desktop sales.

1266
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:42,840
So Ubuntu Software Center, hang on, I'm going to go laugh my ass off on you.

1267
00:58:42,840 --> 00:58:44,320
Elementary what about the Elementary App Center?

1268
00:58:44,320 --> 00:58:49,360
I'm a big fan of Cassidy and Daniel, but nobody's making seventy five thousand dollars.

1269
00:58:49,360 --> 00:58:53,480
OK, you can also not be Cassidy and Daniel because I'm sure they have.

1270
00:58:53,480 --> 00:58:54,660
But all right.

1271
00:58:54,660 --> 00:58:56,920
You may not be the platform vendor yourself.

1272
00:58:56,920 --> 00:59:00,400
Coder dot show slash contact for that.

1273
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:04,680
Last Mike's mess hall Christmas.

1274
00:59:04,680 --> 00:59:07,760
I got I mean, I got you know, I got I got a lot of gear.

1275
00:59:07,760 --> 00:59:10,480
I should just start throwing that stuff in boxes.

1276
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:16,680
So if you'd like to help support whatever this is, you can become a Coder QA team member.

1277
00:59:16,680 --> 00:59:18,280
Coder QA dot go.

1278
00:59:18,280 --> 00:59:19,280
You support the show.

1279
00:59:19,280 --> 00:59:22,680
You get a limited ad feed and we have a Coderly that will be coming soon.

1280
00:59:22,680 --> 00:59:27,640
So if you haven't signed up yet, you can get it when it releases, go to Coder QA dot co.

1281
00:59:27,640 --> 00:59:30,960
And then when the Coderly is recorded and posted, you'll automatically get it in your

1282
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:33,200
feed along with the limited ad feed.

1283
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:36,800
Or you can download it manually to we also post available for manuals downloads there

1284
00:59:36,800 --> 00:59:37,800
for them.

1285
00:59:37,800 --> 00:59:39,600
Coder QA because we love our members.

1286
00:59:39,600 --> 00:59:41,960
So thank you, everybody over there.

1287
00:59:41,960 --> 00:59:46,520
Boy, if you want to win a Thalia and you make five thousand dollars or more by selling software

1288
00:59:46,520 --> 00:59:49,840
on the Linux desktop, go to Coder dot show slash contact or you just like to give us

1289
00:59:49,840 --> 00:59:50,840
feedback.

1290
00:59:50,840 --> 00:59:53,600
We're seventy five thousand, not five thousand.

1291
00:59:53,600 --> 00:59:55,440
OK, yeah, right.

1292
00:59:55,440 --> 00:59:59,520
It's a big difference, like a big difference.

1293
00:59:59,520 --> 01:00:00,520
It's a real bit.

1294
01:00:00,520 --> 01:00:06,640
So like it's rogue Amoeba versus some assholes selling a counting thing that he sold, if

1295
01:00:06,640 --> 01:00:08,760
I recall, five hundred dollars worth of licenses.

1296
01:00:08,760 --> 01:00:10,000
Yeah, you can find Mike.

1297
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:11,520
He's at Dumanuco on the Twitters.

1298
01:00:11,520 --> 01:00:13,360
His company is at the Mad Botter Inc.

1299
01:00:13,360 --> 01:00:14,880
I'm there to Chris LAS.

1300
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:17,080
I don't tweet much, but I try to respond.

1301
01:00:17,080 --> 01:00:20,760
The network is that Jupiter signal where you can get announcements and news and same with

1302
01:00:20,760 --> 01:00:22,880
the show at Coder Radio show.

1303
01:00:22,880 --> 01:00:25,200
How about that?

1304
01:00:25,200 --> 01:00:28,880
Links to what we talked about today are Coder dot show slash four oh eight over there.

1305
01:00:28,880 --> 01:00:33,720
You're going to find that contact form as well as our RSS feed links, really kind of

1306
01:00:33,720 --> 01:00:36,440
all the resources, all the resources.

1307
01:00:36,440 --> 01:00:40,520
And then you go to Jupiter Broadcasting Dotcom and holy smokes, there's like a whole bunch

1308
01:00:40,520 --> 01:00:46,200
of other shows, including Linux Unplugged 400, which landed this week.

1309
01:00:46,200 --> 01:00:47,480
That's pretty great, too.

1310
01:00:47,480 --> 01:00:48,480
You could join us live.

1311
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:53,700
That's Coder Happy Hour at five p.m. Pacific, eight p.m. Eastern at JBLive.TV, and we'd
