00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,880
This is KOTORadio episode 328 for October 5th 2018.

2
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:35,440
Hi everyone and welcome to KOTORadio, Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show,

3
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:41,120
taking a pragmatic look at the art and business of software development and its related technologies

4
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:46,080
and you might say subjects. My name is Chris here in the beautiful Pacific Northwest and joining us

5
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:52,240
every single week is our host, the man who is established in a secret headquarters spying on

6
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:59,280
the large corporations of Florida. It's Mr. Dominic. Hello Mike. Hello and I'm editing

7
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:04,400
my Bash RC live baby. Oh yeah? Oh yeah, this is the time to do it right now during the intro.

8
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,480
It's the right time. It's just the right time. It's the only time. I love it. I love it. There's

9
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:12,960
been there's been many projects completed during the show. You never know. Sometimes you just get

10
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:18,160
an inspiration. You might be in the middle of podcasting. Let's see, hair.cs, okay.

11
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:25,120
We're together on a Friday edition of the show. A rare treat because we often do the show earlier

12
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:29,200
in the week but it didn't work out. You and I were so passionate. We said we got to do this. We got

13
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:34,000
to get together. You were traveling like a maniac. How did all of that go? How did all your travel go?

14
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,520
Did it all turn out okay? Always good. In two weeks, I'm going to Texas. Oh really? Whereabouts

15
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:47,360
in Texas? San Antonio. In a couple of weeks, let's see, I'm going to meet BSD which I think is the

16
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:53,200
19th and the 20th or the 20th. I think maybe it's the 20th and 21st. Anyways, it's coming up in just

17
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:57,440
a couple of weekends. It'll be a weekend thing so it might impact that Monday but we'll figure that

18
00:01:57,440 --> 00:02:01,520
out. Yeah, Texas is a good time to go right now because it is getting gray and cold. Although

19
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:05,840
you're in Florida so what the hell do you know? Anyways, we got a great show. Mike's been testing

20
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:10,640
the testing and we're going to talk about those testing results. Also a little bit about automated

21
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:15,440
build systems and if we get to we have some extended hoopla but why don't we start out with

22
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:20,480
some feedback and follow up like we do to warm up here on the show. And this one I thought was a

23
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:25,440
good one just to address. It's because it's been a while and this is from a listener in Russia. He

24
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:29,280
says, hello Chris and Mike. I'm a longtime listener of the show. Appreciate what you do

25
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
and I like getting the weekly insights of not just the general topics but the things around

26
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:40,800
software development and its related technology. Now, JB did help me after five years of wanting

27
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:46,480
to switch to finally become a happy C++ developer and double my income. So I have a short question

28
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:50,640
that I'm hoping you'll answer. I've listened to the show for a long time but I don't think I've

29
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:56,880
ever heard the definition of what a dark matter developer is. Now, I never hear it but I hear you

30
00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:02,960
mention it a lot so I was hoping you would explain what it is. What do these mysterious devs actually

31
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:07,840
do? He has an idea but he wanted to hear what is our definition when you toss around the dark

32
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:12,880
matter devs. He says, I got a feeling that those are people working in corporations on narrow

33
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:16,960
projects, never expected to leave their office and the projects are generally intended for internal

34
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:23,040
use only. Well, you got that in one. Yeah, that's good right there. That's what we believe here.

35
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:28,080
Our premise on the show is that is the vast majority of the software development industry

36
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:32,640
is developers that are employed or contracted to work for a company that are building software for

37
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:37,840
that company to use internally either as tools to process something or for staff to interact with.

38
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:45,840
And those developers generally don't get to change and jump languages or toolkits or any fad.

39
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:51,120
They don't get the fad hop, I guess is what I'm trying to say. They tool away at a job for a long

40
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:56,800
time and it's a respectable trade if you think about it because there is a certain refining to

41
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:03,200
that process. But they don't really get all of the fame and the glam and the glitz or whatever.

42
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,480
You know what I'm trying to say? They don't get all the attention in the tech press.

43
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:10,960
Yeah, they're often not working on, let's say, the newest technologies. They're usually

44
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:16,880
maintaining some, God forbid, access application for 15 years.

45
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:21,760
Yeah, struggling with some technical debt and they're generally not the people that the keynotes

46
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:29,440
are directed at when Google or Microsoft goes up on stage. But what's funny is they're typically

47
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:33,920
the customer base that's actually keeping those companies financed and buying their products and

48
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:40,000
licensing their software and using their services. But they're targeting future customers. Yeah, so

49
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,360
that's essentially what the Dark Matter Dev is. And it probably is a good idea that we define it

50
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:47,920
every now and then. Once every couple of three years or something. Every three years, whether

51
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:52,720
we need it or not. So I had two items of follow up with you because you know how I like to stalk you.

52
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:58,320
And I noticed, number one, that it appears perhaps you got the Galago going. So congratulations. Good

53
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:03,760
job. Thank you. Is the screen working? It's working? There's a minor pink blotch

54
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:07,360
on the screen, but it's very small and it only appears when the background is dark.

55
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:11,760
And it just so happens to be on the right side of the screen, which means, you know,

56
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:18,240
the way editors format code. I don't really care. OK, so it's usable. That's good. And it's decent

57
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:23,840
hardware still. So all right. So the other follow up is so I think I get it. I get the sense that

58
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:28,320
Buccaneer or I guess no, I'm sorry. It's the Mad Botter Inc. Now I got to keep these things straight.

59
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:32,800
I'm also got to remember that I'm part of Linux Academy. Like there's a lot. There's a lot going

60
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:38,800
on, man. So the Mad Botter seems to be putting some feelers out there for some new hires.

61
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:45,200
I saw you tweet about that. And I noticed, too, that you were mentioning how some of the people

62
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:51,360
that were responding or interpreting Linux command line experience as the subset. And I think I'm

63
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:57,280
getting this right as experience with the subsystem on Windows. What's with it? Is this is this a

64
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:03,440
younger type of applicant? Like what's happening? So I just filled my more senior developer

65
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:08,560
position. So the remaining position that I'm interviewing for is the calling a customer

66
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:15,760
champion. It's a key way kind of customer service type role. So these are more junior people looking

67
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:19,840
to kind of break into the industry. So QA when they're probably not dealing with a customer

68
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:26,480
support issue. It kind of. Exactly. Exactly. Mostly I'm interviewing young folks out of USF,

69
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:31,760
which is a local. You sound like such an old man when you say young folks. I know. You know what,

70
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:41,760
old man? You're just as bad. Old guy radio. Yeah. And. Like, because I enjoy torturing junior people,

71
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:50,160
I make them run Linux. It's a good test of their hardiness. This is a test of your spirit,

72
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:56,960
son. No, it's more because I want them to know how to write scripts and not use wizards for

73
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:01,360
everything. And more importantly, I know how to give them a bash script that does something so

74
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:08,160
helpful. And I've been asking on these interviews, so tell me about like, you know,

75
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:13,040
scripting on a Linux environment. Do you know Python is another very popular thing I'm hearing

76
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:18,720
about. So one thing is a lot of these folks aren't really doing bash scripting per se.

77
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:25,040
They're writing their little utility stuff in Python. But the and this isn't all,

78
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:31,200
but this is a surprising plurality of these young people. When they say when I say Linux,

79
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:34,480
I asked what distro and they say, well, what do you mean? I just use the subsystem.

80
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:43,760
And my jaw dropped the first seven times I heard. Oh, I think the reason this is happening

81
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:50,160
is because we have a very large Microsoft campus like right here. And they are like basically like

82
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:54,240
major sponsors of most of the tech events and the student stuffs and the hackathons and all that

83
00:07:54,240 --> 00:08:01,040
good stuff. And I know they're very, very active on campus. So my assumption is that it's just

84
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:06,400
proximity and Microsoft gives free Azure candy to kids like it's giving candy to kids. I have

85
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:10,640
two thoughts on that. So it's funny because Joe just asked this question in the user air. I think

86
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:14,880
it's forty nine that I was just on air dot show slash forty nine where I also went into detail

87
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:19,200
about my whole medical thing, the whole triptych Texas and getting surgery.

88
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:26,160
But he said, is Windows 10 going to be the biggest competition for desktop Linux now?

89
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:30,640
And the premise is and I think it's a good one. Of course, we all argued with him. But the premise is

90
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:36,880
that it's good enough to do some of this stuff and where students in the past would have been

91
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:42,880
spinning up a VM to do part of the class inside of VM. They're doing it now in the subsystem.

92
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:50,240
The subsystem is replacing VMs and that keeps you closer to Windows. You're not having to go

93
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:54,560
through the Ubuntu installer and you're not seeing the Ubuntu desktop with the with their

94
00:08:54,560 --> 00:09:00,400
Nome theme and all. There's no browser. It's like inside the desktop environment. It's all just

95
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:07,600
the command line sitting right on top of Windows 10. And he made that he made the his position

96
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:12,960
essentially was is that over time that negates the need when you look at Chromebooks and you

97
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:17,360
look at Windows 10, that negates the need for desktop Linux. And we all, of course, argued with

98
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:21,600
it. But now here you are telling me the very thing that he was concerned about. Damn it.

99
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:26,800
And it doesn't surprise me, to be honest, because it's it's a pain in the ass to really think about

100
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:34,000
it, install some virtual software. So is it? Do you go with VirtualBox? Do you do you try to use

101
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:39,280
like Windows 10 Pro and have Hyper-V? Is it a requirement of the class that you license something

102
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:43,280
or are you trying to do something economical for the students? And the subsystem just solves all

103
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:50,880
that. It's sort of sad, but it's sort of. It's sort of, I think, long term, it just sort of all

104
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:56,000
works itself out in the wash because at the same time, they're learning some skills on bash.

105
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:01,600
They're maybe learning the differences between the DIR command and the LS command.

106
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:06,400
So it's still a valuable experience that could be translated to physical Linux,

107
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:10,880
full Linux installation down the road. So I wouldn't totally discount it, but it does,

108
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:14,400
to me, seem to signal that maybe Joe was right about being concerned about a new trend.

109
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:16,640
I always hate it when Joe's right.

110
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:22,800
What's weird is another thing I, you know, let's say four years ago was seeing people

111
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:26,960
come in for interviews and almost everybody, I would say, what's your preferred environment,

112
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:30,080
you know, Linux, Windows or Mac? And like 90 percent would just say Mac.

113
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,040
Mac, yeah.

114
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,800
I'm seeing almost like no MacBooks.

115
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:38,080
That's got to be part and parcel to your location because I still see quite a bit

116
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:44,240
of MacBooks out there. But, you know, at Linux Academy, they have a choose your own OS policy.

117
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:51,280
And initially people were choosing MacBooks and it's transitioned to Linux machines. And now it's

118
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:54,800
like, well, what do we get? Dells? Do we get ThinkPads? Like now there's confusion around

119
00:10:54,800 --> 00:11:01,600
all of that. And I think it is there are like ebbs and flows. The Red Hat CEO this morning tweeted

120
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:08,320
that tech is a style of fashion, not like in the Apple Watch iPhone style, but like in how things

121
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:13,920
do come into fad and then they last for a while and then we swing to another fad. And he was

122
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:17,600
making the case that, you know, the last swing was cloud. Everything's going to the cloud.

123
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:21,760
We're all cloud. And now it's all now the conversation has swung to hybrid between

124
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:27,600
physical and cloud is clearly the future. And now we're now that's the new fad for

125
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:33,600
server deployments. And the same thing is, I think, true with workstation operating systems.

126
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:38,640
And these different OS's get more competitive. You have Ubuntu coming back into Gnome,

127
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:43,920
sending all of their fixes upstream and building two really solid LTS is in a row. Actually,

128
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:51,600
all of them from 1204 to 1404 to 1604 and now 1804, they had their issues here and there.

129
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:57,360
But in totality, especially by their point one releases, they were really solid,

130
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:02,880
rock solid LTS is. And so that's a lot of momentum. And I think it's caused some swing

131
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:06,480
back the other direction when you also combine it with the availability of better hardware.

132
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:12,960
But that I think also shifts by region. Depending on where you go, you have a much

133
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:17,680
higher MacBook population. Like so for I'm almost done by the time you go to when you

134
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:23,680
go to Southeast Linux Fest down there in Charlotte, North Carolina, they're all ThinkPads.

135
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:27,200
Everybody that goes there for the most part, except for the presenters,

136
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:30,080
are on ThinkPads. That's just sort of the culture in that area.

137
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:38,080
That's a little weird. I thought the ThinkPad thing was like an old school sort of Linux

138
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:43,200
spirit thing. You know, I just got to ThinkPad, right? I mean, I know you did. That's why I did

139
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:51,200
that. I think it's, you know, there is something to not having a metal machine. So the MacBook that

140
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:57,840
I had was metal and the XPS 13. So my work machine was this MacBook, the first TouchBar edition I got

141
00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:02,800
when my other MacBook died for Final Cut. And, you know, as I stopped editing video, I sort of

142
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:08,080
used that MacBook less and less. And I increased my usage of the XPS 13. I started traveling with

143
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:13,360
the XPS 13. And it was a great little machine, but I was delicate with it. Not only did I had

144
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:17,840
I busted it by dropping it and the plastic had broken and it was sort of delicate in that way,

145
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:22,960
but I also felt because it was metal and dentable and scratchable, I needed to be more careful with

146
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:28,080
it. And so I would be very, very sort of delicate with it. But with the ThinkPad, I really don't

147
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:32,880
have those concerns. It feels really much more like a workman's tool or a work lady's tool. Like

148
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:38,320
it's something I throw in the bag. I've already put stickers all over it. Like, you know, I didn't

149
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:44,800
know if I could never could really violate the aluminum of the XPS 13. But with the ThinkPad,

150
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:50,320
it just looks like every other plastic ThinkPad. So I don't care. And I just, you know, decorated

151
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:55,920
the way I like and now it feels personalized. There's something to your work tools being

152
00:13:55,920 --> 00:14:01,920
durable and not being these pieces of jewelry. I'm telling you, there's something to it. You

153
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:07,440
know, remember when Apple used to make rubber MacBooks? I wish they still did. Yeah. All right.

154
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:10,720
Well, moving on. That's not what we're here to. Well, actually, in a way, it's a good time to

155
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:14,960
transition into talking about this particular problem. So nominally, we're going to be talking

156
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:21,840
about building and QA and all of the integration processes there. And you did a little more digging,

157
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:26,880
I believe, into automated builds for iOS without a Mac. And it looks like you've collected some

158
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:33,680
resources. I know we've talked a little bit about Mac and cloud in the past, but I'm curious to see

159
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:37,360
your thoughts on App Center and other services that are out there. Where are we at on this,

160
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:43,440
Mr. Dominic? Yeah. So I ended up, you know, I got that MacBook for my trip, but I'm going to be

161
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:51,040
returning it because I just don't want it. So and I would like my money back. So I'm going to

162
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:57,280
go back. So I ended up getting a tweet before the last show we did from a listener named Emily,

163
00:14:57,280 --> 00:15:02,320
who suggested I check out Mac and cloud, which I did briefly look at, but I felt it was a little

164
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:07,680
too much of a hassle. I also subsequently got a tweet, I believe, from someone actually an

165
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:12,800
evangelist at Microsoft saying, hey, Dodo, you can totally do this in App Center. The catch is your

166
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:18,960
first builds for iOS have to be done on a physical Mac and then App Center can take it from there.

167
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:25,440
Oh, really? That's interesting. That is interesting because this scratches a few

168
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:31,120
itches. One, like we didn't even mention it, but I'm currently on elementary at this very moment.

169
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:34,720
Good for you. I think that is the desktop environment for you, especially Juno. I don't

170
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:39,760
know. Are you using Juno? I'm on Juno. Good, good. I really think that's they got good app.

171
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:43,440
The apps that they have are really good and solid. It's a clean environment. I think it's

172
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:47,040
gotten a really bad rap for trying to be a Mac clone. It's not that at all. It's just they're

173
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:53,840
trying to make a great UI and a great environment. It's one of my favorites. Sorry, now that I said

174
00:15:53,840 --> 00:16:02,240
all that, do you like it? I do like it. I don't know when it finally comes time to upgrade to

175
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:11,040
a new tower. It would probably be either elementary or pop. I think it would be if I

176
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:15,920
buy a Dell tower, it will be elementary because I don't love stock Ubuntu at the moment, even though

177
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:21,520
pop is very close to it. And if I buy a 76 one, I will be lazy and just keep pop. The thing about

178
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:28,160
elementary OS is just I love its terminal. They have the best notification system on desktop Linux

179
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:35,600
and they're building this really complete guide for developers to follow to create applications

180
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:39,840
for the platform. Then they have the app center where they have a monetized system where it's pay

181
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:44,480
what you want. So developers can actually get paid for creating these applications.

182
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:48,400
And there's some neat ones in there that are unique and specific in a way. There's other ways

183
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:52,800
to get them. But in a sense, if you want the complete experience, they're unique to that

184
00:16:52,800 --> 00:17:00,960
distro. And it's so solid. They have this release approach where it's not date based, it's open bug

185
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:05,440
based. And they just burn through all the issues until they have them sufficiently closed. And then

186
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:11,920
that's when the next release gets cut. And I think that's why it's been so reliable for my son. He's

187
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:18,240
been on it for almost three years now. The same install, my son on the same install, doing updates,

188
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:25,200
installing Minecraft software. And it has been rock solid for him. And if you like GTK applications,

189
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:30,640
which are gorgeous, it's a great way to run GTK applications on a desktop that is better

190
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:35,280
architected than Gnome 3 Shell is. Anyways, that's my end of my pitch. I just think it's one I've

191
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:38,800
been wanting you to try for a long time, but I just haven't been wanting. If you've been happy

192
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:43,280
with pop or stock Ubuntu, I didn't want to push. Because you can go crazy hop in distros.

193
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:47,520
Distro hopping. Well, I will say that my distro hopping days are probably done.

194
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:53,040
Yeah, good. And I think we are going to be in a situation of, as long as I'm like,

195
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:58,960
frogging around with this machine, it'll be elementary. And then whatever the, don't call

196
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:07,760
it a Mac Pro alternative machine ends up being, will probably be by their pop or elementary.

197
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:12,400
I can't see myself using stock Ubuntu at this point. Okay, so going back to Visual Studio

198
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:18,000
App Center and code signing for iOS. So you get it signed and built once on a Mac. And then from

199
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:24,800
then on, you use the App Center to do the deployments to the store and to actually build

200
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:29,040
and sign it? Can you explain? This doesn't make sense to me. Right, but it's not just

201
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:35,200
deployments to the store either. You can also use the App Center to, how can I put this,

202
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:40,400
to do hockey app or test flight deployments to let's say customers or testers or anything like

203
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:47,360
that. Which is kind of a big deal because it also can handle collecting the customer's UUID for

204
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:53,600
their iPhones, which if you're using a hockey app is a tremendous pain in the ass. This has got to

205
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:58,320
be pretty enticing to you. Are you giving this serious consideration? Yeah, I'm giving us some

206
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:02,480
thought. And the reason being, one thing I've been considering doing for a while now is automated

207
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:08,240
testing out of GitLab. So basically you would merge a branch, pull it somehow, create a binary,

208
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:15,280
and run a bunch of automated UI tests and other kinds of just basically scripted tests. And

209
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:22,160
that's always been something that's relatively easy on the web and incredibly annoying on mobile

210
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:28,160
just because of the whole Mike's machine ends up being the build machine. And if Mike is busy,

211
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:35,680
he doesn't want to sit there and run tests. So yeah, this is a, it's kind of a big change.

212
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:40,960
One, because you don't need to lug around a MacBook. And I think even though the idea of

213
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:45,360
just having a Mac mini somewhere hooked to a router was attractive, I think ultimately having

214
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:53,360
this in the cloud is going to be more convenient. And the case of tests that I'm thinking of running

215
00:19:53,360 --> 00:20:00,560
are fairly easy to automate. Things like, are you missing assets? Are elements on the screen

216
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:06,400
not lined up correctly? Things like that. Obviously Crashers and your basic heartbeat tests.

217
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:15,280
But again, doing that manually is super time consuming. And I can already see the snarky

218
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:23,360
YouTube comments coming, Mike discovers TDD. No, this is the stitching together of a new,

219
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:29,440
I hate to use the term, but new cloud-based pipeline that, I mean, this is something Microsoft

220
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:35,520
I think is just at the beginning of doing. What we are seeing today is going to be so more advanced

221
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:42,880
by 2025. It's going to be obvious by that point. But if you look at how quick Microsoft is moving

222
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:47,440
on their integration with GitHub, I've never really seen this company move this fast. Just

223
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:52,320
as an example, if you go to docs.microsoft.com, now the entire comment system has been replaced

224
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:57,680
with GitHub comments. You sign in with your GitHub account, and then they have open issues

225
00:20:57,680 --> 00:21:03,760
and closed issues in the comment section. They are integrating this stuff into Microsoft's pipeline

226
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:10,160
very, very quickly. And there's going to be a clear future where it's all connected together

227
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:15,200
very easily. And they're there now, but I mean, by 2025, this is going to be one of the tightest

228
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:20,480
pipelines and developer resources out there. This is going to be great. And I could see why it'd be

229
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:24,480
enticing now, even where they're just getting started. And here's the other crazy thing,

230
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:29,040
and this wouldn't necessarily work for you because you don't want a Windows desktop,

231
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:38,720
but this week Microsoft also announced Surface All Access, which is $24.99 a month for a Surface.

232
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:43,520
And so it's Surface as a service, and they're actually going to be, I think, probably looking

233
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:48,000
at it, that's how they're going to account for it as a service. So you get a book, you choose your

234
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,600
favorite bundle, there's different bundles to pick from, and of course, they will change the price.

235
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:57,040
So the price can go up to $150 per month if you wanted to say, get the Surface Studio iMac

236
00:21:57,040 --> 00:22:02,000
replacement, that'd be 150 bucks a month. Or if you wanted like the Surface laptop bundle,

237
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:09,120
it's 46 bucks a month. But along with that, you get Dell support for some reason, Dell preferred

238
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:14,640
supports, like Dell's top class support, and you get a subscription to Office 365. And you could

239
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:18,240
see how they could easily spin this out in a developer's program, where you could also get

240
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:24,560
access to Azure or certain aspects of Azure or access to the pipeline of some particular use.

241
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:31,040
This is, to me, the perfect solution if I was working in this ecosystem. I'm actually a pretty

242
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:35,280
big fan of the iPhone upgrade program, because the iPhone is just as useful as, actually,

243
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:39,280
it's more useful than most of my computers. And so it's something that I'm interested in keeping

244
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:43,920
up to date. And I also am interested in getting a new camera, because there's lots of uses for that.

245
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:48,000
And so for me, it's actually pretty good as a subscription. And my laptop hardware and your

246
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:53,520
laptop hardware also tends to get replaced about once a year, or for you, if you want to get a

247
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:57,760
new camera, about once a year, or for you, even twice or three times a year, or four times a year.

248
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:04,720
And so when you bundle these things with this top tier support warranty, and they'll replace it if

249
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:10,000
you damage it, and you can get a new one when they release a new one, and you get bundled access to

250
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:15,440
some of the services you might be using already in the cloud, they've got a really competitive

251
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:20,160
offering for developers who don't have a ton of capital, who can't drop $3,000 on high-end

252
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:24,960
hardware, but can afford $35 a month. Of course, a lot of people listening are going to go,

253
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:29,680
oh my God, don't do that. You're financing a laptop. It's depreciating every day.

254
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:34,720
But for some people, that is an arrangement that works. And when they have the ability now

255
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:40,800
to bring all of this stuff together, Azure, and GitHub, and Surface as a Service, that's easy to

256
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:45,920
say, that's a pretty competitive offering, especially since the Surface hardware, from all

257
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:53,200
of that, is pretty decent. I don't know, man. Microsoft is just at the starting gates right now.

258
00:23:54,640 --> 00:24:00,720
So not to jump back too far, but to our conversation about the Windows subsystem for

259
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:06,720
Linux, one of the more common things I'm seeing these students do is they're writing Python on

260
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:10,480
Windows, which just blows my mind. Yeah, it's a thing.

261
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:18,080
And like, yeah, it's creepy how good the iOS Apple development tools are from Microsoft.

262
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,560
Yeah. And I'm running them on Linux.

263
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:27,200
That is a funny thing. It's worth just spending a moment with, because it's

264
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:34,080
not how things used to be. See, it is something to reflect on and go, wow, holy shit. This is

265
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:40,400
really something. They really have moved so fast for a company their size, this is extremely

266
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:44,240
nimble movement. It doesn't seem like it from the outside, but some of these things have been in

267
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:51,120
development for years, like five-year timelines. And so they're moving. Wow. Well, so I guess

268
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:55,200
this would probably be a good time to start talking about QA in general, your testing of

269
00:24:55,200 --> 00:25:02,960
the testing, because you've had some, let's say, on-again, off-again experiences in this area in

270
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:08,560
the past? Yeah, so longtime listeners will know that I've drank and then thrown up the

271
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:20,560
Kool-Aid on the automated testing more than once. So this is going to be a unpopular, not cool hip

272
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:22,880
perspective on this problem. Ooh, those are my favorite.

273
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:30,000
I do not believe that there is actually a virtue in having 100% test coverage.

274
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:36,880
Okay. Because it's just not that hard to test certain things with the power of vision. And

275
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:43,200
I also don't believe, as some people have wrote lengthy blogs about, that you can basically

276
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:47,920
eliminate human testers via automated testing. Oh yeah.

277
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:52,400
I also remember, Chris, let's talk about the late 90s for a moment, the early 2000s.

278
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:57,200
There used to be entire teams of QA testers at companies.

279
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,560
Oh yeah. Oh yeah.

280
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:03,920
Yeah. Yeah. And now a team that builds an app is like two or three people, right? So it's-

281
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:09,360
Yeah. I would say in some cases, the QA was one of the large areas, not larger than support,

282
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:13,040
but there were more QA testers than there were developers. That's for sure.

283
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:19,200
Oh, for sure. Right. And the QA people, it was a really formalized process. I don't know how deep

284
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:24,400
you went into it, but they had binders of QA scripts you had to follow. Yeah. And the best

285
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:29,920
ones, there was usually someone there who was very persnickety about following the process.

286
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:34,480
We have to follow the process. And because I was there as PC support, if something was preventing

287
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:39,360
the process from going in its order, it was no good. And that was a big deal. And this room I'm

288
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:46,480
talking about, for a company that had, I mean, three or four developers plus a contractor and

289
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:52,880
maybe two contractors, they had a dozen QA in this one business that I was a contractor for,

290
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:56,480
for two years. And the entire time, the QA department was an area they kept staffed.

291
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:59,840
It was a bit challenging to keep it staffed though. That's for sure. A lot of turnover.

292
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:04,960
Well, that was the thing though, right? The QA department was basically the stepping stone to

293
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:10,640
becoming a programmer developer at a company. And this was, geez, that had been going on since the

294
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:15,120
dawn of the industry, I think. I mean, these of us is old enough. Yeah. You look back at projects

295
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:21,120
and the way they're structured, there was generally, I think a huge, well, comparatively to

296
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:27,120
now, a huge commitment to QA that I guess to now just seems crazy. It seems like a huge staff cost

297
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:35,440
that nobody would ever do. Well, that's the thing. I kind of think you do need QA.

298
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:42,480
I've thought this for a long time, as we know. And I, again, get your YouTube comments ready.

299
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:48,720
I actually questioned the wisdom of having developers be QA and having yourself rely

300
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:54,320
completely, and I said completely, on automated, let's say, TDD testing. And we'll get into that

301
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:57,520
because all different kinds of testing you could be doing in terms of automated testing.

302
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:04,720
Because I would love to hear from anyone in the audience who works somewhere or has done

303
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:11,200
a project themselves where it was never necessary to just run the app or whatever it is on an actual

304
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:19,280
device and physically walk through the different screens or different user flows, regardless of how

305
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:25,280
much automated testing you do or don't have. So the premise I'm rejecting is that I do not believe,

306
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:31,040
again, I do not believe 100% test coverage will necessarily pay for itself.

307
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:37,520
Let me see if I'm following you. Number one, it's hard to be your own editor. You write up

308
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:40,480
something and you have somebody else read it and they'll have tons of editing suggestions.

309
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:46,640
It's UI design is a lot like that. It's easy to overlook things that are just natural to you

310
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:52,640
because you understand how it all works. So having somebody with a user's perspective and a clean,

311
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:57,440
fresh perspective can catch things that would otherwise just have seemed obvious to you.

312
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:01,120
So there's that aspect of it that I think you're trying to get at. But the other thing about it is

313
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:09,680
100% automated testing would really require dedicated time to build new testing settings

314
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:16,480
and systems all the time. But you think about what it would require to be able to fully automate

315
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:24,560
all of that. It would either be a massive amount of pre-planning and an incredible amount of

316
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:29,360
organization required to do it right, or it'd have to be an evolving thing that you're calling

317
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:34,480
constantly adjusting and changing, which would be a big attention and time suck. So it seems like

318
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:40,000
there's a balance there that you're saying maybe could be struck that it is worth having automated

319
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:45,360
testing, but there is a balance where you will become consumed by managing the automated testing

320
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:53,120
system. Am I following? Yeah, I would also argue that it's not just the cost of automating the

321
00:29:53,120 --> 00:30:00,000
test system. There's an economic thing where QA testers are generally junior and inexpensive,

322
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:06,960
and intermediate to senior devs are generally going to be your highest cost, which means you're

323
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:10,880
probably going to be very incentivized to try to build that time if you're in a type of business

324
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:20,720
like I am. Okay. I'm not convinced that that is actually providing real value. Again,

325
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:25,280
I'm not convinced that 100% coverage. I am not asserting that automated tests don't make sense

326
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:31,280
at all. In fact, I think they do make sense. I just don't think being religious about 100%

327
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:38,320
coverage is ultimately worthwhile. Yeah, I'm not going to argue that. I agree.

328
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:43,600
Yeah. Well, it is kind of the whole position. I've been dipping my little toe back into this pool,

329
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:47,680
and there's some very strange binary thing that's happening.

330
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:52,800
My question to people has been, okay, so how much automated testing are you doing? We're doing some,

331
00:30:53,760 --> 00:31:01,760
but we're not writing tests to make sure the title of the page in iOS is correct,

332
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:09,360
because we can just look. What I'm getting, particularly in developer forms, is just

333
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:12,880
you're not doing testing unless you have 100% coverage.

334
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:17,360
Which seems, that's like saying you're not using Linux unless you're completely false or GPO.

335
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:21,520
Yeah, it's almost getting to a religious degree. It's a belief system. You will test.

336
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:28,240
And then there's, if those are the RMSs, there's the, I don't know how you go past RMS, but

337
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:31,920
there's the people who say you have to write your tests first.

338
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:36,560
Right. Which sounds like complete madness to me.

339
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:42,880
You know, I have been involved in a couple of conversations where the room of people that were

340
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:48,080
building the thing, all of them seem to have collective buy-in on the idea that they could

341
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:52,080
push it through a completely automated test system, a 100% automated test.

342
00:31:52,880 --> 00:32:00,160
And I never saw it completely work. It's funny, F-R-R-O-L in the chat room says,

343
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:06,160
it's the 80-20 rule. 80% of use comes from 20% of the tests. And I would say that was the

344
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:12,400
experience I walked away from, mainly from one particular group where I was involved in the

345
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:18,720
conversation where I saw them concoct the idea. But I've also observed it from several, actually

346
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:21,840
from several open source projects as well as clients, now that I think about it, where this

347
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:26,400
mentality has crept in. And generally, I've seen it work. I've seen it work.

348
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:30,240
As well as clients, now that I think about it, where this mentality has crept in and generally

349
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:35,920
seems to have just become a never-ending quest. And I really, in my personal experience,

350
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:39,440
it was about 20% of the tests. And they were the obvious ones that, of course,

351
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:42,800
you'd want to check for, watch for regressions, make sure the damn thing doesn't crash,

352
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:46,160
that kind of stuff. Well, it's like anything,

353
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:50,160
the way I've taken it so far is like your mission-critical business logic,

354
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:55,360
which in the type of software I tend to be writing now, is like transmitting data,

355
00:32:55,360 --> 00:33:01,680
doing calculation, doing conversions from like annoyingly small binary formats from the 80s.

356
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:05,200
But that's all stuff that's easy to test because you can have a test script that like

357
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:09,200
has a known input that you know what the output should be and just simply

358
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:14,480
write a test that puts the input in and make sure as you get the correct output.

359
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:25,040
But anything, I can give you a great example. I was talking to someone who was like testing

360
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:32,720
CSS, which not only did I think was not possible, seems kind of crazy.

361
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:34,800
Because how do you actually accomplish that?

362
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:43,840
How do robots pick music? It's a design thing. It's a look and feel thing.

363
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:49,120
And the answer to this question, by the way, is he went through extraordinary efforts to

364
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:53,920
make that happen. And even then, I would argue, and the argument I did make to him was that I

365
00:33:53,920 --> 00:34:00,000
think your whole setup here is going to be super fragile. Like what happens if a browser, let's

366
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:05,600
not call it Chrome, decides they want to change something, then do all your tests immediately

367
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:14,320
fail? And his answer was probably. Yeah. And then back to work. That is exactly the thing.

368
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:21,440
It's a rat race. What's the expression? You're chasing, you're following the leader constantly

369
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:26,960
with that kind of testing. I strongly believe, and I should save this for a predictions episode,

370
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:30,560
but I strongly believe when I was talking about Microsoft, now they're just getting started,

371
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:36,160
this is an area they're going to expand on. And it's going to be one of those things that when

372
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:41,760
you're all in and you're all connected up to their stuff, it's going to be extremely enticing to use

373
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:46,560
because they'll automate a ton of this stuff. This is the next big area. I have heard a couple of

374
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:52,000
open source projects that are thinking about building a service like this that is a full QA

375
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:57,280
platform. And there are ones out there, but if a company like Microsoft could bring it all together

376
00:34:58,080 --> 00:35:03,840
with Azure and the ability to spin up virtual machines and test all kinds of applications

377
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:11,440
from desktop applications all the way up to remote services and the full range, they could take it

378
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:16,960
right from GitHub, they could build it, they could test it, and then they could go to the App Center

379
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:21,680
and they could create the builds for iOS for you. The whole pipeline is there. There's just a few

380
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:26,800
pieces they need to do some of the additional testing and to really make it easy to build those

381
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:30,320
tests for the developers, to make that super accessible. There has to be work done there.

382
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:35,120
But you know that's got to be a direction they're going to go in. So maybe this is my preemptive

383
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:41,840
2019, end of 2019, 2020 prediction. Yeah, I would even piggyback on that. You know, now that I'm

384
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:48,320
exploring this again for mobile apps, there is like a very common set of tests I would argue

385
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:53,680
that you need for just about every iOS and Android app if you're going to do this. Why can't when I

386
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:57,840
load up a built app center, Microsoft just simply say, hey, we have this suite of tests that we

387
00:35:57,840 --> 00:36:03,200
recommend you let us run and don't worry, you don't have to do anything. You know, so last week,

388
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:09,440
Google announced that when you deploy a container on Google Cloud, any kind of like Docker container

389
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:16,480
or anything like that, their system will now begin to analyze the system files and look at it to make

390
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:23,200
sure there's no like Monero crypto miner in there. They're initiating a set of QA checks already for

391
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:29,280
deployments on Google Cloud. And if you think about it, behind the scenes, they're already doing

392
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:33,840
tons of QA stuff when you spin up a machine scripts that check to make sure services available.

393
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:38,640
It is just going to be an expansion of that to a degree like internally for them. They probably

394
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:43,040
already have infrastructure they can build on to make these services possible. And that's exactly

395
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:48,800
even if it just starts at does it crash? Does the UI load? Could they perhaps maybe even simulate

396
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:54,560
network conditions, create a simulated cellular network, create simulated degradation and packet

397
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:59,200
loss? I think they could. And they could probably do it very simply compared to what you have to do

398
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:03,280
to try to simulate that same thing on actual hardware. Of course, I guess they'd be a simulator.

399
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:07,440
Anyways, I'm getting ahead of myself, but I think it's obvious where they're going to go. And it's

400
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:12,000
going to be really interesting to see if that happens. How does the developer market react?

401
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:16,480
And how much are they willing to shift to a Microsoft based tool chain? And maybe they're

402
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:20,720
like you and they're doing that from Linux or they're doing it from Windows 10, or maybe even a

403
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:28,320
Mac or God forbid, a Chromebook. And no, no, no, I don't do that. And Microsoft's acquisition of

404
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:36,720
GitHub was just you think about it was pretty clever. Yeah, and also a little scary, but yeah,

405
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:41,280
it's going to be you know what else is. OK, so just like off the top of your head, you got to

406
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:46,960
answer quick. Don't think about it. So get ready. What company is scarier, Microsoft or Amazon?

407
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:52,160
Amazon. Yeah, 100% right? Like 100% way. So I would rather like put all my stuff on Microsoft.

408
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:56,560
Yeah, oh, for sure. Yeah. When it comes to like data storage and stuff. So I know what Microsoft

409
00:37:56,560 --> 00:38:02,080
wants, right? Yeah, I, I have been trying to make a case for a while on the show and I don't think

410
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:07,600
I've gotten a lot of traction. But I'm going to bring it up one more time. I think there is gold

411
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:15,520
in them, their hills of the echo. And the the different types of use cases that you're going to

412
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:20,720
use now for the echo, I think expand the options for developers to create skills that eventually

413
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:25,280
can be monetized. And this is not a commercial. I actually have really kind of stopped using. I

414
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:31,200
have one here in the studio, but kind of stopped using echo tube. So I'm not I'm not here to sell.

415
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:37,120
This is just my personal opinion. They just launched, I think a couple of weeks ago, a dozen

416
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:42,880
different types of echoes. You've all heard about the microwave one. There's even the Billy, the

417
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:47,760
bass, that rubber bass that sings on the wall. They've even made it. Are you kidding me? 100%

418
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:51,840
serious. There's now an echo in that thing. Yeah, they made an echo of God. And the thing the worst

419
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:57,120
two products together and the lips move with the voice of the bass. Yeah, they've they've done that.

420
00:38:57,120 --> 00:39:01,280
But they've also done a couple other really neat ones, including a much better video version one,

421
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:06,320
but one that's built into a clock, like a wall clock. I think that's pretty clever. And they're

422
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:11,440
also now testing one that goes in the car, which I've experimented with back when I just I just

423
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:15,760
brought a my fi and a device with me. And I just tried to have the echo in the car just to see what

424
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:25,040
that'd be like. And I think they are going to just hit this harder than Google or Apple can,

425
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:31,200
because this is Amazon putting a store in your home. And it ties in with the security products

426
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:36,000
that they've also announced. So all the devices work together, the echoes go into monitoring mode

427
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,920
when you when you when you set your house alarm. And of course, they can tie it in with deliveries

428
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:44,320
and down the road to tie in with other services that they launched like groceries. So the grocery

429
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:50,640
delivery will come and the system will recognize them. This is a massive importance for Amazon,

430
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:55,840
way beyond anything that Apple or Google can appreciate. Google obviously is a close number two

431
00:39:55,840 --> 00:40:01,040
with search and all the services that voice commands tie in with obviously, but I think for

432
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:07,440
Amazon, this is better than opening a store in every town. This is opening a store in every home.

433
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:14,560
And I I watched now as they continue to expand their developer monetization program, where if

434
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:19,920
you get a successful skill, they're watching and they're starting to cut people checks. That's not

435
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:24,960
a sustainable system, but I think that is an indicator that Amazon intends for this to be a

436
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:30,160
way for people to make money. And until all of the pieces are in place, writing checks is how

437
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:35,280
they're doing it. There are other ways of tying in with services. It's a great way to sell services,

438
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:40,480
especially if you have or if you're already creating like audio content that would work

439
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:45,200
really well on the echo. So there's other ways to monetize, but I feel like there are golden in

440
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:51,600
their hills and for for Amazon, they're expanding this thing and it just is just very competitively.

441
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:57,040
They've announced a bunch of different devices. Did I did I did I get did I reach you at all with

442
00:40:57,040 --> 00:41:04,000
that pitch? I mean, you reach me with the pitch every time, but then there's the problem of you

443
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:08,880
only get paid if Uncle Jeff decides to send you a check. Well, it's not necessarily like I'd be

444
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:14,160
willing to pay to have somebody create a really comprehensive skill for Jupiter broadcasting.

445
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:18,560
Like there you could come to me with a certain like quote and I you know, I'd be like, okay,

446
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:22,560
that's what we're talking about. Actually, like so there like there's there's several ways to monetize

447
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:27,520
this. If you look at all of the podcasts that are out there, all the radio stations, everybody wants

448
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:34,160
you to be able to call up their thing on it on a scale. There's even an angle for you with the

449
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:38,480
mad botter. You could have you could have mad botter tips and things like that that are pre

450
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:44,400
recorded sessions that you've done, maybe 1520 MP3 files that sit on a droplet. And then when

451
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:50,080
somebody says, hey, echo, give me a mad botter tip, it plays one of your tips. I'm just, you know,

452
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:54,880
obviously that'd be a weird example. But there is I think there's more use cases than people realize

453
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:59,680
because not a lot of people have these. And once you get them, you realize there's a lot of

454
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:04,800
potential. All right. It's actually not the worst idea ever. You know, I mean, there's a lot of

455
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:09,360
businesses that would like I could even see Linux Academy would want something like this like a

456
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:14,240
like a you know, a Linux Academy educational tip. Like there's a lot of use cases here. Wait, I've

457
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:20,400
got it. Hey, big mouth Billy bass. Yeah. Play Jupiter broadcast Linux Academy. Yeah. Say I did

458
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:25,120
it again. No, no. It's podcasts are still labeled as Jupiter broadcast. So I don't know what we'll

459
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:29,760
do there. Eventually I might change it. It seems like Linux Academy is a stronger brand with larger

460
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:36,320
industry recognition. But the podcast could be like the premium podcasts from Linux Academy. Yeah,

461
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:45,360
we're a premium brand. We're pretty. Yeah. I mean, I really want to believe in it. Right. This is a

462
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:52,160
okay. Like, so I have to confess, I have written an Alexa skill. And because uncle Jeff makes it

463
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:58,640
so easy to just automatically create a skill with AWS Lambda. It is really, really easy to get sucked

464
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:05,120
back into the AWS ecosystem. Yes. Oh, for sure. Yeah. Like it's shocking. Like what they have done

465
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:10,160
is I could make a skill. I can make a skill with my son. Like you can sit down and they have a lot

466
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:14,720
of different systems now that make it like click and drag even. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

467
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:19,920
And drag even. Yeah. I mean, I did it before that when you had to like coding like node,

468
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:24,000
but you could, you didn't have to care, right? You could just do it in a Lambda and just basically

469
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:28,240
write your functions that respond to certain things. Um, and you have to have like a default,

470
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:35,120
you know, sorry, I don't understand you kind of function. I just don't know.

471
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:42,480
See, I guess I don't know other than like making skills for other people.

472
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:46,240
Yeah. Um, I, I think in, I think in your space, content creation,

473
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:49,360
particularly audio content, it's awesome. Right. I think that makes a ton of sense,

474
00:43:50,080 --> 00:43:54,560
but how far could, how, how much would a different kind of business really be willing to invest in

475
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:59,840
Alexa skill? Yeah. You know, it's, I think the that's funny. I think, uh, F R O L in the chat

476
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:04,800
room nailed it is this is what I've been feeling is where my angst on this comes from is if

477
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:09,440
developers don't start making these things better, I don't think they're taken off. I mean, more than

478
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:14,400
they really have, but he writes in the chat room, he says, are those tubes like tablet several years

479
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:19,920
ago? Promising, but not flying. Well, I'm still, yeah, I kind of feel like I'll give, I give the

480
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:26,640
home pod, uh, a, a special mention here because it went from really basic course. You will, of course

481
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:34,560
I did. It went from really basic. In fact, in its core, it is still very basic, but holy hell,

482
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:40,320
the shortcuts work with the home pod. Holy hell, man. Like I, you know, I'm listening to a show

483
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:46,560
all the way home. I get home, I walk in the RV, I say, Hey, home pod resume overcast. And

484
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:50,960
the things were never on the same network. They were never talking until I obviously got home

485
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:56,560
and it just on the home pod. Now it just immediately resumes playing my podcast exactly

486
00:44:56,560 --> 00:45:03,280
where I was now on the nice audio of the home pod. I also had to do was turn that macro or I'm sorry,

487
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:08,640
shortcut on, on my iPhone some point a couple of days ago and that crap just works. So now I'm,

488
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:13,680
I've got, okay, okay. You ready for this? This is, this is some real crap here. This is so,

489
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:19,520
I take a drink before you tell me. Yeah. Yeah. Cause you're gonna, now this is not as applicable

490
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:23,840
to you because your home does not go down the road, but you, this would work well if you had

491
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:29,200
your phone in your car, but this is particularly applicable to me because we go down the road and

492
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:34,000
we actually listen to our music on the home pod because it's louder than the RV is built in

493
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:40,240
stereo system, which is not what do you do when we're driving the RV? We have the home pod plugged

494
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:44,800
in still. We have, we have electricity in the RV when we're driving and we actually listen to our

495
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:50,960
music and our podcasts on the home pod because it's louder than the RV stereo system. So I mentioned

496
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:55,440
this just for context. So you'll understand why this skill is pretty important. So this is a

497
00:45:55,440 --> 00:46:01,440
shortcut that I have. I wasn't, it wasn't my idea, but I definitely built it. So if I say,

498
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:07,760
Hey, home pod, I'm getting pulled over. It pauses the music or the podcast. It turns on,

499
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:13,200
do not disturb on all of my iOS devices. It turns off their brightness on my phone.

500
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:18,720
It gets the current location. It sends that to my fiance Hadia and it tells her I'm currently

501
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:23,280
getting pulled over. This is my current location. While my screen is off on my iPhone,

502
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:28,880
it turns on the front facing camera in high quality mode, saves that to a photo album.

503
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:33,280
And also then sends it to me in a message when everything's done. And then when I tell it,

504
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:37,920
everything's done and we're over, it takes me out of do not disturb mode, turns my brightness back

505
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:43,280
on. And it saves, uh, that video that it recorded to iCloud and Dropbox.

506
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:52,240
So the whole pod went from really basic to now I can do some super fancy stuff.

507
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:57,040
And that same command works on my iPhone too. So I can use it while I'm driving in the car.

508
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:03,920
So, you know, I'm amazed there's not a commercial with that feature because that actually, no,

509
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:08,880
seriously that I was completely unaware. It could control your other devices like that. That's now,

510
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:13,440
is that a third party developer or is that a integrated? That's a shortcut. It's a shortcut

511
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:18,080
and you just have to have, so it has to be a setting that you can change via iCloud. Um,

512
00:47:18,080 --> 00:47:23,360
yeah. And it's pretty cool. And it's, it's a, you can, if you search for it in the shortcuts gallery,

513
00:47:23,360 --> 00:47:28,000
there's one that I use as a template. It's something it's called police. So I changed

514
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:31,040
mine to I'm getting pulled over because that's the command. I just, that's stuck in my head

515
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:35,040
because that's what I'm thinking when I'm getting pulled over, right? What else are you going to

516
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:39,840
think? And just even having it silence and turn off screen brightness. Oh, that's really cool.

517
00:47:39,840 --> 00:47:44,560
And so the cop doesn't think you're like texting while driving. Right. Um, and so I think these

518
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:48,000
personal assistants shouldn't be called personal assistants cause I don't know what the hell is

519
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:52,480
personal about them. It really drives me crazy that you can't, I think there's a feature that

520
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:58,080
would put an echo on every single business person's desk. Every desk in the United States

521
00:47:58,080 --> 00:48:02,640
would have an echo on it. If they could come up with a couple of real actual personal assistance

522
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:08,240
features. If, when you and I need to reschedule the show, I could say, Hey, echo schedule a

523
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:14,640
recording with Mike on Thursday or Friday. And then it would never talk to you. It would never

524
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:20,160
bother you. It would never send you a message. It would contact your echo or some intermediary API,

525
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:24,800
some service. It would check your calendar. You'd see what time you have available and

526
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:29,280
match it up with the time that I have available. And it would set a mutual meeting, then notify us.

527
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:34,080
And maybe that notification would come via the echo or something that shows up on your phone or

528
00:48:34,080 --> 00:48:38,640
just a regular old calendar invite and it would be done. And we wouldn't have to have this back

529
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:44,000
and forth in Slack. It would all just happen because these personal assistants did that.

530
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:48,000
And there's a lot of stuff like that. Like why can't I ask this thing to send a grocery list

531
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:52,240
somewhere? You can create lists, but then you have to open up another app. Like they're not

532
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:57,120
personal assistants. They're automation devices. And if you think of them as that,

533
00:48:57,120 --> 00:49:00,240
then I think they're a little more useful. So this is where I think the problem is,

534
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:07,680
right? So if I wanted to develop some cool automation software for just, let's just say,

535
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:13,280
the echo, right? I would definitely do it specifically for Big Mouth Billy Bass though.

536
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:18,720
Because of all these stupid walled gardens, like these stupid barriers to like,

537
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:23,120
I am completely sure that there's all kinds of ways that integrating with the HomePod sucks if

538
00:49:23,120 --> 00:49:28,560
you are not like a native iOS app. Yeah. And perhaps my Apple, like all that stuff

539
00:49:28,560 --> 00:49:34,960
doesn't work if my phone's not on the land. Right. So it would be great. Let's just,

540
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:39,840
cause the ideal architecture would probably be you write some software that runs on a server.

541
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:47,040
Could be a DO droplet. You then have these different endpoints. One could be for,

542
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:54,560
you know, assistants such as Siri and echo. The other could be just like, almost like how the

543
00:49:54,560 --> 00:49:58,320
Android instant apps kind of work, which is like renders down a page. Hell, it could just be a

544
00:49:58,320 --> 00:50:04,080
webpage for mobile devices. And that, I mean, this is how Slack bots and bots in general work. And

545
00:50:04,080 --> 00:50:09,760
the other would be just a JSON endpoint for, you know, your slacks, your Microsoft teams,

546
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:16,400
hip chats. But Apple won't allow it. Google has their own hangups about Google assistant. Although

547
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:20,240
I think it's funny that no one who talks about this stuff really talks about Google assistant

548
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:27,360
too much, which is interesting to me. Yeah. And Amazon, I think is actually the most flexible

549
00:50:27,360 --> 00:50:28,480
for developers here. Yes.

550
00:50:29,840 --> 00:50:34,240
But no one wants, with good reason, none of the other companies want to be in bed with Jeff Bezos.

551
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:41,440
I hear he's a selfish lover. So I, like, I love it. The use case you gave is great. Like that is

552
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:46,960
my ideal. I could just say, you know, Hey, Java Duke. And if you get the reference, you're old,

553
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:53,200
go, I don't know, tell you what happens all the time, right? I'm coming back from Orlando or

554
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:57,440
something and I'm stuck on I4. Just the same case, right? Tell Chris, I'm going to be 20 minutes late.

555
00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:02,160
That can be a shortcut now. You know, that, that is the thing is if you're on iOS.

556
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:07,600
If I have a native iOS app, if I have a home pod, you're asking a lot of buy-in.

557
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:13,680
I know. I know. And the thing is, is at different times, not necessarily the most competitive,

558
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:18,800
you know, like tech def without question, the echo can do more, especially when you

559
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:24,080
consider the skills in the ecosystem. And so in a lot of ways, Google assistant is better

560
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:29,360
contextual conversations than any of the assistants are. And it in a way can do with it. Yeah. Yeah.

561
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:36,160
Yeah. It's to me, it's just either, I think it's either, I don't know, it feels like they're almost

562
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:40,320
going to be successful just because they play music and you can tell them to skip songs and

563
00:51:40,320 --> 00:51:45,600
turn things up and down. Like that is the minimum viable product of all of these speakers. And

564
00:51:45,600 --> 00:51:50,560
because the costs are coming down, they're all just getting smart anyways. And so this ecosystem

565
00:51:50,560 --> 00:51:55,280
is sort of building on the momentum of people wanting decent sounding speakers that they can

566
00:51:55,280 --> 00:52:00,000
control easily. And okay, if I can set a timer, that's kind of handy too while I'm cooking,

567
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:04,720
like that's the momentum that these things are running on, not all of their fancy AI and assistant

568
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:10,400
stuff, but we will reach a point where they're just ambient. They're everywhere. I mean,

569
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:15,840
if you think about a household that has a couple of iOS devices and iPad and iPhone and a watch or

570
00:52:15,840 --> 00:52:20,000
a home pod, that's a lot of Siri mics everywhere in the house. If you think about a place that has

571
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:25,040
a couple of echo dots, it's a lot of Alexa mic, uh, cancel, sorry. That's a lot of-

572
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:26,480
The panacea dream come true.

573
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:32,400
It really is. Ooh, yeah. And so then there is all of a sudden by the very nature, a market.

574
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:35,760
And over time that market will start to get more sophisticated. I think,

575
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:40,880
I think, I think, I don't know. We'll see. It's, they seem to be selling a crap ton of them.

576
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:45,760
All three, Amazon, Google, and, and, uh, and, uh, Apple. But the only one that doesn't seem

577
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:50,560
to be selling that super well that I've seen is the Cortana one. But even Microsoft's in the game,

578
00:52:50,560 --> 00:52:51,920
that's the one nobody ever talks about.

579
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:56,480
Microsoft is actually, uh, integrating Cortana on the Xbox with Alexa.

580
00:52:56,480 --> 00:52:58,640
Yeah. That's actually, I don't know if you're joking,

581
00:52:58,640 --> 00:53:00,320
but that is actually something they're doing is you can-

582
00:53:00,320 --> 00:53:03,440
No, I'm not joking. Yeah, yeah, no. They, yeah.

583
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:06,960
That's so weird. All right. Well, we, I know people hate it when we talk LadyTube,

584
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:09,440
so we should probably wrap it up there. But I just still think it's,

585
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:13,920
you look at the last couple of weeks, uh, and now with iOS 12 and the HomePod, you have,

586
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:17,360
you have some incredible capabilities all of a sudden overnight that the HomePod could do.

587
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:21,440
And, uh, Google Assistant is going to be calling people and scheduling. You know,

588
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:24,880
if anybody's going to get there, it's going to be Google with that scheduling thing that I want.

589
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:28,400
It's going to be over the phone though. It's going to call people and be a robot talking to

590
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:32,800
them and just get stuff scheduled that way. Hello, Dave. I would like a dinner reservation.

591
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:36,080
Yeah. Well, Mr. Dominic, is there anything you want to mention or plug or any links to

592
00:53:36,080 --> 00:53:40,400
send people to before we get out of here? Uh, go check out themadbotter.com. And as

593
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:43,920
always, if you want to run some C-Sharp on Linux, I'm your man.

594
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:45,840
There you go. That feels dirty every time.

595
00:53:45,840 --> 00:53:48,960
I don't know, man. It's going to get more and more popular, more and more in demand.

596
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:52,800
All right. Well, we'll wrap it up there. I'm at chrislas. Grab the links we talked to
