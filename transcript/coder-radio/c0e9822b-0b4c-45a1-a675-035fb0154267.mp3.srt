00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
This is Coder Radio, episode 343 for February 4th, 2019.

2
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,840
Hello, and welcome to Coder Radio, Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show that's digging

3
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:42,760
in, taking a pragmatic look at the art and business of software development.

4
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:48,280
My name is Wes, and I'm joined once again by our favorite, Mr. Michael Dominic.

5
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:50,120
Good afternoon, Wes.

6
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:51,120
How are you?

7
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,480
I am doing good.

8
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,280
Sounds like maybe just a little bit better than you.

9
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:58,200
Although over here in the Pacific Northwest, we've had something of a snow day.

10
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,200
I know.

11
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,560
We're up there in the Arctic.

12
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:02,280
Now, I do have a quick question.

13
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:03,280
Oh, yeah.

14
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:04,280
Go on.

15
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:07,800
Were there any rail accidents near you or Chris?

16
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:08,800
I don't think so.

17
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:09,800
No.

18
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:12,080
I mean, as far as I know, trains are running on time.

19
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:13,080
I see.

20
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:17,920
I'm on the hunt for Bruce Willis.

21
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:18,920
Let's hear more.

22
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:19,920
How's your hunt going?

23
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:20,920
What are you armed with?

24
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:24,080
I am armed with bones that shatter easily.

25
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:30,160
I am armed with a wheelchair and a comic book art gallery that somehow stays in business

26
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:33,360
with no actual marketable products.

27
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,880
Oh, Mr. Glass.

28
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:36,880
That's right.

29
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,880
We should have known, Wes, because of the children.

30
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:39,880
All right.

31
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:43,600
Well, let me trade a question right back at you, Mr. Dominic.

32
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:47,620
Well, what I observed since last time we spoke, there's been a lot of hubbub, a lot of people

33
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:49,920
enjoying your enjoyment of Rust.

34
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,880
How's it going over there?

35
00:01:51,880 --> 00:02:00,660
You know, Rust is kind of like what I imagined joining the Jedi Order would be like.

36
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:02,080
It's magical.

37
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:04,280
It's scary.

38
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:06,920
It sometimes doesn't make sense.

39
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:09,820
So does that mean they – when I saw you bought the Rust book, does that mean they

40
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:13,140
send you like a nice Jedi robe that you get to wear while you're studying?

41
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:17,600
So for every hundred lines of Rust you write that actually is quote-unquote correct, safe

42
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:22,200
and compiles, you – yeah, you get one more inch in your robe.

43
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:25,920
It's almost like a lab coat.

44
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:29,640
If you're familiar with the Clone Wars, you're like one of those Jedi who doesn't

45
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:32,600
talk, kind of just silently judges –

46
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:33,600
Yeah.

47
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,600
Yeah.

48
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:35,600
Silently judges the other Jedi.

49
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:40,880
Well, have you made any little test programs that you're particularly proud of or looked

50
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:42,760
at any community projects?

51
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:45,340
I have looked at some community projects.

52
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:49,200
Some of the Rust embedded stuff has been pretty interesting.

53
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:56,120
Now is it a community project if it's meant to more efficiently deliver Jar Jar Binks

54
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,600
clips to Chris?

55
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,960
Oh yeah, of course.

56
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:05,360
That's an important thing and I'm pretty sure his feed is not yet entirely saturated.

57
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:08,240
I think there's like – there's room for more Jar Jar.

58
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:11,400
I just, you know, throwing it out there.

59
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,280
Always room for more Jar Jar.

60
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:18,320
So if I can do that and use less memory and therefore get more Jar Jar in it, that seems

61
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:19,320
right.

62
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:20,320
Yeah.

63
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:23,720
I did notice someone started playing with implementing Python in Rust and that seems

64
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:24,720
like kind of a fun project.

65
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:25,720
Yes.

66
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:30,040
I always find that, you know, writing interpreters or compilers or other things, it's different

67
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:32,480
than – you know, a lot of the day-to-day programming you might do is kind of just,

68
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,000
at least these days, tying different APIs together.

69
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,640
You install a couple libraries, you connect up to some external services or write to disk

70
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:41,720
or start a database and when you're writing – you know, when you're playing with implementing

71
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:44,960
languages, you kind of flex different parts of the language.

72
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:45,960
Yeah.

73
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,560
I was taking a look at that project on GitHub.

74
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:51,320
I did not understand like why I would want that.

75
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:55,960
But it seems like just somebody is kind of, you know, for their education, kind of write

76
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:56,960
edification.

77
00:03:56,960 --> 00:04:01,320
It definitely goes to show the power of Rust though, that you can write a pretty performant

78
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:07,320
Python interpreter in Rust and it's not the craziest thing in the world, to be honest

79
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,320
with you.

80
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:12,120
Actually, it's not a terrible Python interpreter.

81
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,120
Yeah.

82
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:17,720
That's another nice thing is it can be helpful when you're learning a language to, you know,

83
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,280
find projects that are at the right scale.

84
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:22,320
It can be pretty intimidating if you're just learning the idioms to dive into a big code

85
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,320
base.

86
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:25,220
But if you can find something, you know, someone's just started with, they're still fleshing

87
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:29,240
out parts, but it's big enough to have some like real code in it.

88
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,240
Yeah.

89
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,240
Definitely.

90
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:35,040
I mean, I certainly wouldn't recommend if anybody is coming on this Rust journey with

91
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:40,000
me that they write a Python interpreter, right, as their learning project.

92
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:49,960
It's definitely a good example of, I won't say ease, but the relative, compared to like

93
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:57,260
a C, and maybe I will say ease, the relative ease compared to like an old C language.

94
00:04:57,260 --> 00:04:59,200
Ease versus power, I guess, if that makes sense, Wes.

95
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,480
I feel like I'm a little at C here, but.

96
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,960
No, no, of course.

97
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:07,080
But yeah, it is that ease versus power is, I think, the perfect way to describe it.

98
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,480
Yeah, it's fine.

99
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:11,320
I mean, it's gonna, I am in the beginning of this journey, right?

100
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:16,680
So it's gonna take me certainly some time before I'm anywhere near a proficient developer

101
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:17,680
in Rust.

102
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:21,840
How much, I mean, what have your, has the compiler been, are you having a good relationship

103
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,740
with the compiler or a little bit testy?

104
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:30,560
So I have restricted myself to try to do things the quote unquote good Rust way, meaning thou

105
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:33,160
shall not use that unsafe keyword.

106
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:35,560
Yes, right, exactly.

107
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:36,560
Leave that to the masters.

108
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:42,760
Yeah, it's, if I have a good relationship, it reminds me of Catholic school.

109
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:49,360
My knuckles are very much sore from being smacked with the, you know, ruler of the compiler

110
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:53,700
being like, nope, can't do it, nope.

111
00:05:53,700 --> 00:06:01,520
But it's forcing me to think in ways I don't normally think about code, which I am hoping

112
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:06,000
will, even if I don't end up using a ton of Rust in production, will make me a better

113
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,800
developer overall in, for example, Ruby or, you know, C sharp.

114
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:11,800
Sure.

115
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:15,920
I saw some commentary on Hacker News earlier this week of someone posting a Swift program

116
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:20,920
that had some threading and value types involved and there was some confusion over like how

117
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:24,600
when mutation was happening, well, what exactly was happening and someone rigged up like a

118
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:29,680
basically conceptually the same version in Rust and then showed the compiler output from

119
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:34,760
Rust saying like, this represents potential unsoundness in your code and indeed it did,

120
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:35,760
right?

121
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:36,760
That was the whole point.

122
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:39,880
So it's nice that you can actually get, you know, if you go through the steps in the work,

123
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:41,920
there's some real huge benefits.

124
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:45,120
Yeah, Rust makes you do the work, right?

125
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:49,840
There's, I mean, sure you could throw the unsafe keyboard, but let's just pretend you're

126
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,680
not going to do that.

127
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:57,760
This sounds so kind of jerky, but Rust makes you actually think about what you're developing

128
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:02,080
before you develop it, I guess is what I would say.

129
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,080
I love that.

130
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:08,400
You know, a popular saying is hammock time, you know, and for a lot of programs, not all.

131
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,600
Sometimes you just need to like get in there, kind of hack some stuff together and figure

132
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,600
it out.

133
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,600
But the design phase is important.

134
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:15,000
You want to make sure you're actually doing something that makes sense and that you've

135
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,640
thought through how the data flows through your program.

136
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:19,200
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

137
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,200
Sure.

138
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,200
Come on now.

139
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,200
Let's not be silly.

140
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,200
Oh, wait.

141
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,200
This is Coder Radio.

142
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,480
Are we going to write documentation to you next?

143
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,480
I mean...

144
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,920
We'll see.

145
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:28,920
Maybe next year, Mike.

146
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,480
We should all have something to strive for.

147
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:34,640
We'll celebrate Coder Radio 400 with one page of documentation.

148
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:35,680
Okay.

149
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:41,600
So speaking of development best practices or worst practices, I don't do much development

150
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:48,160
over in the land of Apple, iOS, the App Store, but I know you do and boy, howdy, there was

151
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,120
some big drama last week.

152
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:52,080
Well, do you have my bell?

153
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,520
Oh, I wish.

154
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:54,520
I wish.

155
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:55,520
No, I don't do that.

156
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:56,520
You wish.

157
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:57,520
Well, I'm going to do it.

158
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:58,520
Ding, ding.

159
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:01,560
For years, I was right.

160
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:02,880
But we won't even get to it.

161
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:07,360
I think we have to walk our Linuxy friends down the Apple path here for a moment.

162
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,360
Yes, I think so, right?

163
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,360
Because there's a lot going on.

164
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,760
There's a special type of certificate.

165
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:14,080
There's kind of a long history from these other companies using the certificate.

166
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,080
So could you...

167
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:16,080
Can you break it down for us?

168
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,080
Yeah.

169
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:22,160
So long-time listeners will know that I have been complaining about code signing since

170
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:26,080
the T-Rex ruled Washington state.

171
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,760
Now in Florida, he still does.

172
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,720
We call him out on the alligator if he's still in charge.

173
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:30,720
Oh, yeah.

174
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,720
Right.

175
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:39,360
The code signing I was talking about was for the App Store or for development deployments.

176
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:43,120
We are going to talk about code signing in a completely different context today.

177
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:48,040
We're going to talk about sideloading apps, which I know shouldn't be allowed, but kind

178
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:51,600
of is, via internal enterprise apps.

179
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:56,000
In Android, there's a little switch you can flick that says, okay, I'm willing to damage

180
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,480
my system maybe, and I'm allowing myself to install third-party APKs.

181
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,480
But you don't...

182
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:03,840
Or if you're running Android, you've already damaged your system.

183
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:04,840
Yes.

184
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,520
I'm willing to further damage my system.

185
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:07,520
But on iOS, right?

186
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:08,520
There is...

187
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:09,680
Sure, there's some stuff like test flight.

188
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:13,480
There's other methods that you can beta test or get a little bit of code for personal use

189
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:18,760
to run, but not for larger deployments.

190
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:21,820
Other than the App Store, there's about three other ways to do this.

191
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:26,080
One is test flight, which you're allowed to do 1,000 devices, which for a lot of people

192
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,440
is just all they need to ever do.

193
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:34,080
The third is what used to be test flight, but like now is people use hockey app.

194
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:38,200
The problem with that is you can sideload apps in an ad hoc way, but you only get 100

195
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:44,160
of each device type, which sounds like a lot, but actually really, really is not.

196
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,920
So it's hard to live in that world anymore.

197
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:52,440
The third is what's called an enterprise ad hoc certificate, the enterprise certificate

198
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:55,080
for short.

199
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:58,880
That is basically what you're describing, Wes.

200
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:04,240
The difference is instead of on Android where you say allow untrusted sources, you actually

201
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:07,040
do it per organization.

202
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:11,320
So for instance, you could do Jupyter Broadcasting or Linux Academy.

203
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:15,800
I am sure has an enterprise certificate running around somewhere if they have iPad apps that

204
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:16,800
they care about.

205
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:22,060
To be clear, when we say iPad apps, we mean internal iPad apps, right?

206
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:26,160
So these are things that probably are not going to be on the App Store, or they could

207
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,960
be alpha or beta versions.

208
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:31,880
I know nothing about the Linux Academy iPad app, but I'm just going to make something

209
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:32,880
up.

210
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,440
Let's say it's at version 2.2.

211
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:39,880
It wouldn't be insane for them to give me and Wes version 2.3 on our iPads because we're

212
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:42,400
hosts of shows here, right?

213
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:44,160
Just to test and see if everything's fine.

214
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,160
I see, right?

215
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:50,360
It kind of reminds me of some enterprises have their own TLS certificates or root certificates

216
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:53,600
that they have pre-installed the machine so that you have trust on the local domain.

217
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,600
So kind of the same thing.

218
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,600
Well, that's exactly what they are.

219
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,600
They're root certificates for iOS.

220
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:57,600
Got it.

221
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:02,080
And then so whatever for your device will trust those and it's meant to be used, right?

222
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:06,060
And I think it's stipulated in their policies that it's meant to be used for internal applications

223
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:07,560
that aren't for wider deployment.

224
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:08,880
Yeah, it is.

225
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:16,600
The two acceptable uses are you are QAing a 2B public version of an existing app.

226
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:22,280
Again, that's my version 2.3 example of a theoretical Linux Academy app.

227
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:27,160
Or you are indeed, just using this internally, a great example.

228
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:30,740
We could have a Jar Jar Binks Send Chris a meme app.

229
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:31,740
That's a dumb example.

230
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:37,600
Facebook employees evidently don't know how to order burritos and they had a custom app

231
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,160
for that that they used internally.

232
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,160
Right.

233
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:42,160
Yeah.

234
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:45,520
I know like some other uses that people were talking about as like internal like navigation

235
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:50,080
and map apps or getting hailing rides from between different campus locations.

236
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:54,560
Another great example, Google Chelsea years ago when I was up there, they had a bunch

237
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:59,960
of custom iOS apps if you like or in a rush and really, really want coffee, like stuff

238
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:07,520
like that because the support staff, you could be taking care of via a number of different

239
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:08,520
apps.

240
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:09,520
You could book all kinds of things, right?

241
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:13,560
It's not super important, but like laundry or whatever.

242
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:18,760
Well, because Facebook is evil, I don't even know what to say.

243
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:23,640
I mean, there's a whole rabbit hole there of privacy implications, weird incentives

244
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:25,800
and the whole thing.

245
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:32,600
They decided to pay teenagers and other folks, but mostly teenagers, $20 to install their

246
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:35,040
root enterprise certificate on their phone.

247
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:42,240
These teenagers were not employees of Facebook, so that in itself is a gross violation of

248
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,240
the developer agreement.

249
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:46,840
Quote, unquote, Facebook research, it was the name of the app.

250
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:47,840
Yeah, boy.

251
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,800
Yeah, but it's a lot more complicated than that, right?

252
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:54,800
So it used to be called something with an O that they bought from an Israeli firm.

253
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,720
It was rejected from the app store.

254
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,160
It was actually booted from the app store.

255
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,160
Oh, right.

256
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:02,400
This is like, it'll set up a VPN that sends all their stuff through Facebook's data centers

257
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,400
and lets them do research.

258
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:04,520
That's the whole thing though.

259
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:07,520
It's like root access to the phone.

260
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:11,200
So text messages, the whole kit and kaboom.

261
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,200
Wow.

262
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:18,920
So Facebook thought they would be cute by changing the info up, P-list data for the

263
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:25,120
app, giving it a different name, and then basically paying people to install the enterprise.

264
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,120
I love that, the P-list.

265
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,120
Right?

266
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:31,080
You pull up that little editor, tweak a couple of config values, save it back out there.

267
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,080
That's all it did.

268
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:34,080
Change the name, change the logo.

269
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,080
Amazing.

270
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:43,560
So Apple evidently was informed by a tech journalist that, hey, did you not notice this?

271
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:48,640
And Uncle Tim said, I did not notice that, but I'm pretty unhappy about it.

272
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:55,160
So Apple, with the click of a button or the stroke of a keyboard, one assumes it was a

273
00:13:55,160 --> 00:14:02,240
magic keyboard, that's what I did there, revoked Facebook's root enterprise certificate.

274
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:06,280
Now that might not sound terrible.

275
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:08,240
It's pretty terrible.

276
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:14,000
So what that does is anytime a non-app store app published by Facebook tries to authenticate

277
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:19,520
with Apple's signing servers, it can't, and therefore all those apps immediately stop

278
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:20,520
functioning.

279
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:21,520
Wow.

280
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:22,520
Right.

281
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:27,720
So this is where it sort of starts to get very interesting, because there is like, obviously,

282
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:30,300
as we talked about, Facebook is kind of evil.

283
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:31,840
No one liked what they were doing with this app.

284
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:35,080
They had clearly violated the policies of Apple.

285
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:37,960
On the flip side, I've seen a lot of people making points that like, you know, if you

286
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:43,000
abuse or don't follow the terms of APIs that you request from Google or Facebook and get

287
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,400
keys for, they will happily turn those off for you, no problem.

288
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:49,960
So in some sense, Apple's doing that same thing, and the reaction makes sense in that

289
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:50,960
light.

290
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:54,720
But it kind of also reveals something about the entire ecosystem.

291
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:58,140
Well, there's so many different ways you could take this, right?

292
00:14:58,140 --> 00:15:03,800
One is like what Facebook was doing is kind of gross and icky, and like, you know, for

293
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:10,240
example, their method of getting parental consent was a check bot that says, do you

294
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,240
have parental consent?

295
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:12,240
Are you kidding me?

296
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,240
Wow.

297
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:14,240
No, I'm deadly serious.

298
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,240
That's insane.

299
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:20,600
So that's like, that's, there's no better word than icky here.

300
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:27,400
Having said that, my pet pony for years now has been, you know, I mean, if you listen

301
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:32,000
to the show from a long time ago, hey guys, Apple has a tremendous ability to pick winners

302
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,880
and losers on their platform.

303
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:39,880
And when they turned off Facebook's certificate, not only this, I would consider a malware

304
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:45,000
app because frankly, it's, Facebook has really tried to say it's people knew what they were

305
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
doing, but it's malware, right?

306
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
This is malware.

307
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:57,040
It crippled Facebook for a day, like, you want a burrito?

308
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,040
Better be on Android.

309
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:01,720
You want to, you want to hail a shuttle?

310
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:02,720
Better be on Android.

311
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:05,480
That was kind of the funniest part of the fallout here, right?

312
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:11,000
Is that they had this totally for some other reason and then it impacted the day-to-day

313
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,320
operations of these campuses.

314
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,460
They really had come to rely on these.

315
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:19,680
Are you a developer on one of the Facebook apps that wants to test a subsequent version

316
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:22,760
or even a non-release, but perhaps alternative version, right?

317
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:25,760
Maybe you're doing A-B testing.

318
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:26,760
Sorry.

319
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:27,760
Wow.

320
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:30,120
The root certificates revoked.

321
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:33,560
So this is crippling.

322
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:35,840
By the way, Google had a similar program going on.

323
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:38,680
They were doing a little bit of screen scraping in their version of the app.

324
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:43,520
The interesting thing though is Google immediately apologized and then Apple hit them, but brought

325
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:45,800
them back.

326
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:52,960
Facebook kind of tried to defend themselves in a way that was, again, icky.

327
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:53,960
So I don't know, Wes.

328
00:16:53,960 --> 00:17:01,880
I mean, this is kind of like Godzilla and Mothra fighting and I feel like the only people

329
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:04,320
really losing is downtown Tokyo.

330
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:05,320
Yeah.

331
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:11,480
There is a lot of fallout and there's some kind of questions I had around, I mean, I

332
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:15,200
was looking at some of the requirements to get one of these enterprise certificates and

333
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,680
actually they're not crazy unreasonable.

334
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:21,480
There's a bunch of like, you have to be a legal entity associated with this business

335
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:22,480
and blah, blah, blah.

336
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:23,480
You need a DMV number.

337
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:24,480
You need EIN number.

338
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,720
But it doesn't seem like it's shut out people.

339
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:30,360
Like if you had a business that had a reasonable use case for that, it seems like maybe they

340
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:31,360
would consider giving you one.

341
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:32,360
One of these certificates.

342
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:33,360
Okay.

343
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,360
Right.

344
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:36,240
So that was one aspect I was kind of concerned of because if it is only like, are you a serious

345
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,720
big enterprise?

346
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:40,080
No, you don't need to be.

347
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:43,880
You just need to be a business that exists and by the way, business can be a sole proprietorship.

348
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:44,880
Right.

349
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:45,880
Yeah.

350
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:46,880
Oh yeah.

351
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:47,880
Sure.

352
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:48,880
It could be a dude.

353
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:49,880
Yeah.

354
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:50,880
That makes sense.

355
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:53,360
So the other part, right, that is scary is it's not even the fact that they immediately

356
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:54,360
stopped working.

357
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:58,280
It could be one thing of like, okay, you can't install any new apps that they released using

358
00:17:58,280 --> 00:17:59,280
this certificate.

359
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,280
Okay.

360
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:01,280
That makes a lot of sense.

361
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,280
Yeah.

362
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:05,280
But that you would like in time alter the state of my device.

363
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:07,020
It's kind of like with the Tesla stuff, right?

364
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:10,600
Changing the range, adjusting battery settings on the fly remotely.

365
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:12,680
It's kind of scary.

366
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:15,680
So this is the band hammer.

367
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:20,040
It is my understanding of this and I have tried to dig into the documentation to see

368
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:22,720
exactly how this works.

369
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:27,920
For years, I have thought that it was kind of an ET phone home system where your custom

370
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:32,640
enterprise app would call the Apple server just to make sure it was okay.

371
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:39,360
That might happen on install, but what it looks like Apple actually did was push and

372
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:46,720
say from the Apple servers to all these devices, this certificate is revoked.

373
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:50,520
Therefore, the apps cannot run.

374
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:54,120
Which is like, I don't know.

375
00:18:54,120 --> 00:19:00,600
I know that's kind of a pedantic difference whether the apps phone home ask for permission

376
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:05,320
or the server actually pushing into the devices, but I kind of don't think it is.

377
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:13,120
If you slow down and think about it, say Apple from Cupertino just like push some whatever,

378
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:17,120
some JSON or however the hell they do this to all these iOS devices.

379
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:20,180
You know it's JSON or worse, it's XML.

380
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:23,360
It's probably a P list.

381
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:29,600
The P list of death and just nuked a bunch of apps.

382
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:39,800
So they theoretically, and like it's not theoretical, they in fact have this power over everybody

383
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:44,320
and they just like never chosen to use it before.

384
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,520
I was a little taken aback by that.

385
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:48,160
Yeah, right.

386
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,240
That is true.

387
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:52,840
They have had this power the whole time and it's one of those – it's kind of like a

388
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:56,440
lot of stuff in the privacy world where a lot of people kind of more in the know who

389
00:19:56,440 --> 00:20:01,400
are already concerned about privacy sat back and said, everyone else, yeah, you see what

390
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,680
we've been complaining about and talking about all the time.

391
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:05,240
It's not just theoretical.

392
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:12,000
Yeah, I mean in a lot of ways, I wish it had happened to somebody who wasn't quite so

393
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:18,360
icky as Facebook because I think we'd be having a better conversation about, well,

394
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:24,100
even the manufacturer and platform vendor of my device and mobile operating system can

395
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:29,880
simply decide that they don't like the software I'm running on it and like break that, right?

396
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:32,580
They can break that.

397
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:33,580
Is that good?

398
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:37,040
Like in this case, they have a lot of like moral indignation because like what Facebook

399
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:41,280
was doing was like unbelievably gross.

400
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:46,020
But let's just like – I hate to sound like a Facebook apologist because I actually think

401
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:49,480
like this is a company who can't go out of business fast enough.

402
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:50,480
Sorry, guys.

403
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:53,320
They used to try to recruit me all the time.

404
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:57,360
Yeah, I mean they make some interesting technology and they certainly seem to pay well but I

405
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:00,240
don't know if you could support what they're doing.

406
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,240
I don't know.

407
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:02,240
They're like skinning kittens, right?

408
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,240
Like –

409
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:04,240
Yeah, right.

410
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:07,620
It doesn't matter if you write that cool new block device driver that's super interesting

411
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:09,720
technically if at the end you're supporting that.

412
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:13,720
Like somebody at Facebook thought this was a good idea, right?

413
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:18,920
Like you know, I have ranted and raved about being annoyed with like App Store rulings

414
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:25,940
and stuff like that but I have never thought to like massively sideload any of my apps

415
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:29,880
to steal people's data or because I was unhappy with an App Store ruling.

416
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:33,320
Like I have been unhappy with feedback from the App Store.

417
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:38,360
I have felt at times that they were like capricious or like worse than that arbitrary.

418
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:42,840
Like one time they bitched about something because they felt the logo or the color was

419
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:44,520
not too close to something that Apple made.

420
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:45,520
Oh, wow.

421
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:46,520
Yeah.

422
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:50,640
But like you know, I may have like raged and we didn't even have Slack at the time for

423
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:56,140
JB but raged in IRC or Telegram or whatever but like then I you know, woke up the next

424
00:21:56,140 --> 00:22:00,000
morning and was an adult and you know, just comply –

425
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,520
Moved on with your business, yeah.

426
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:03,600
Right.

427
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:11,640
I didn't like try to make this crazy end run around the developer agreement which I

428
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:17,360
know I don't like that Apple has this power but I'm a little scared that if they didn't,

429
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:19,520
what would folks like Facebook be doing unchecked?

430
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:20,520
Right.

431
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:25,680
So that was going to be my next question here is it seems like part of iOS and the App Store

432
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:28,200
success has been that tight control.

433
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:32,120
I mean there's the one side of it with like a really well-defined SDK and visual design

434
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:36,840
targets and that whole thing but the other side of it is like they police the App Store,

435
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:40,520
they try to enforce privacy respect and restrictions.

436
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:45,560
There is a hard hand and I guess like the upside of that is instead of an open platform

437
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:50,840
you have something that you can kind of expect works and is of a certain quality.

438
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:54,080
And maybe that's not true but that's what a lot of – that's what a lot of happy iPhone

439
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:59,020
users who are also let's say, desktop Linux users on their workstation say, you know,

440
00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:00,020
they have a device that simply just works.

441
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:01,020
Are we talking about Chris again?

442
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:04,480
I'm not going to – I don't want to name names, let's just say there's certain prominent

443
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:05,480
members of the community.

444
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:08,440
Let's just say a guy who is a fisher of men perhaps?

445
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:09,440
Perhaps.

446
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:10,440
Okay.

447
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:13,640
So dirty little secret, let's open the kimono here.

448
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:20,040
There are a lot of unscrupulous iOS developers who are doing things very similar to this

449
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:23,520
with enterprise certificates.

450
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:27,120
This is not that uncommon.

451
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:32,920
I am not one of them because I – just like it's too much work.

452
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:38,800
You know, the risk doesn't – the reward doesn't warrant the risk kind of thing.

453
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:50,560
But there is an entire marketplace of I guess we would call them like gray market iOS software

454
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:53,200
that are using these enterprise certificates inappropriately.

455
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:58,360
The reason you haven't heard about like a crazy banhammer is because Apple, while it's

456
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:04,420
against their policy, you know, is not going to like swing the banhammer on some kid who

457
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:06,320
decided to write a Mario emulator.

458
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,320
Right.

459
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:10,640
In some ways it has to be like public enough or in their interest enough for them to actually

460
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,360
go use their magic powers.

461
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:13,360
Right.

462
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:17,320
And like let's not – you know, it's not St. Uncle Tim here.

463
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:19,840
He's been dunking on Mark Zuckerberg's Facebook for months now.

464
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:20,840
Right.

465
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:21,840
And there's been all kinds of –

466
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:22,840
For a reason.

467
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:23,840
Right.

468
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:24,840
Yeah.

469
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:25,840
Their fight there.

470
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:26,840
I mean, their longstanding fight with Flash.

471
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:27,840
Their longstanding fight – I mean, they don't seem to like progressive web apps.

472
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:28,840
There's all kinds of stuff they don't like.

473
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:29,840
Two major newspapers.

474
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:30,840
Right.

475
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:31,840
Yes.

476
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:32,840
So I don't know.

477
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:33,840
I mean, you're a girl.

478
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:34,840
What do you think?

479
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:40,020
I mean, I know you don't work on these restricted platforms like I do, but you know, I kind

480
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:43,680
of feel like it's – I don't know what I think to be honest with you about this.

481
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:44,680
Like I don't know if I'm happy.

482
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:45,680
I don't know if I'm sad.

483
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:47,800
I'm a little tired because they're acting like children.

484
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:48,800
How do you feel?

485
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:49,800
I know you're a freedom penguin.

486
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:50,800
Yeah.

487
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:51,800
I'm a little torn.

488
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:57,960
I first started off – boy, like years ago I was doing like Windows and Mac.

489
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:02,120
Macs have been a part – actually, I think a Mac was one of my – besides a Joss PC,

490
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:06,880
doing Crystal Quest on a Mac was one of my first major computing experiences.

491
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:07,880
Learned to type on a Mac.

492
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:11,080
So it's been a long time using Apple stuff and I started off in the mobile phone world

493
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:12,700
on an iPhone.

494
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:16,240
Back then, jailbreaking was still a bit easier and kind of still a thing.

495
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,240
So it was a different experience.

496
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:18,240
More went out for Geohop.

497
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:19,240
Yeah, right?

498
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:20,240
Woo!

499
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:25,840
So I've also – and I've also just seen on – after switching to Android, Android's

500
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:27,240
mostly fine for what I need to do.

501
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:30,440
There are times where the camera app is like laggy and I kind of question what I'm doing

502
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:31,600
with my life.

503
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:35,960
But the other times, it works pretty reliably and I'm reasonably satisfied with it.

504
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:42,440
But I already have the apps I need and the Play Store is just a mess by any metric that

505
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:43,440
you want to choose.

506
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:44,840
You have no guarantees of quality.

507
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:46,400
The reviews don't mean anything.

508
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:51,200
I mean, there are some of those things on the App Store too, but there's a certain

509
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,360
amount of – I don't love their policies.

510
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:59,400
It's always been a weird walled garden and that just bothers me philosophically.

511
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:02,680
But at this point, I'm – I was also someone who used to root his phone all the time and

512
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:06,900
I was still like – I like the idea that I have the right to do that if I want to.

513
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:07,900
But I don't, right?

514
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:09,160
Like I don't right now.

515
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:13,700
So there is that other aspect of like, well, I want to have even a switch to like use my

516
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:17,680
own certificate as a – without having to apply, like to be able to get a personal use

517
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:22,000
only certificate kind of like TestFlight but with less arbitrary server side restrictions.

518
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,660
That would set my mind at ease, but I wouldn't – the thing is I don't think I would actually

519
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:26,660
do it.

520
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:30,000
Maybe if I was like testing out a new VPN or like really developing software maybe,

521
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:34,440
but right now as a phone user, it just actually – I don't think it would affect my day-to-day

522
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:35,440
life.

523
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:36,440
Yeah.

524
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:41,160
I mean, I used to – by the way, the thing about having your own personal certificate,

525
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:42,160
you can do that.

526
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:43,160
Oh, can you?

527
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:44,160
You can just plug your phone in a text code.

528
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:45,160
Oh, right.

529
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:46,160
Right.

530
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:47,160
Of course.

531
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:53,040
So I used to – this is where Mike admits to violating the terms of service.

532
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:57,320
I used to like root my phone and install Cydia – I don't know if you're familiar with

533
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:58,320
it.

534
00:26:58,320 --> 00:26:59,320
I'm sure you're familiar with Cydia, right?

535
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:00,320
Oh, yeah.

536
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:01,320
Yeah.

537
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:04,720
I can either confirm nor deny if I've played Pokemon Red, Blue, and Yellow on an iPhone.

538
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:05,720
I have done the same thing.

539
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:06,720
Yes.

540
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:07,720
That's one of the reasons I did it, right?

541
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:09,960
I want Pokemon on the go.

542
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:16,280
So – but at some point, it's like too much of a hassle because every time they rev iOS,

543
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:18,520
all that crap breaks.

544
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:20,800
So I don't do it anymore.

545
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:23,960
Yeah.

546
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:32,440
I think I guess I agree with you with like the one caveat of – you know, Apple is awfully

547
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:38,240
paternalistic for my taste about how they handle like their – quote, unquote, their

548
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:39,240
users.

549
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:41,400
But I don't know, man.

550
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:43,240
There really are foxes in this henhouse, right?

551
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:50,080
Like Facebook is, in this case, just a bad actor and it is a good thing that someone

552
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:53,520
was there to, you know, fight off the wolves.

553
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:54,520
I'm mixing my animal metaphors.

554
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:55,520
But you get what I'm saying, right?

555
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,520
Yeah.

556
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:57,520
Sure do.

557
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:58,520
Like there was a shepherd to fight off the wolves.

558
00:27:58,520 --> 00:27:59,520
Right.

559
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:02,440
We have seen these like otherwise big supposedly at least one-time reputable companies willing

560
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:05,360
to install apps that record you all the time.

561
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:06,760
There's not a lot of limits.

562
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:09,960
And while let's say Android has gotten a little bit better about permissions and be

563
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:14,200
able to set those things, it's still pretty difficult for your average home user to understand

564
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:18,260
each individual app permissions and what they've just agreed to.

565
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:19,260
So how do you –

566
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:20,260
Yeah.

567
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:21,260
Yeah.

568
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:22,260
So can I tinfoil ahead?

569
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:23,260
Can I borrow Chris' tinfoil?

570
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:24,260
Oh, yeah.

571
00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:29,720
You got to crinkle it up real good though to maximize the reflection of those dangerous

572
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:30,720
frameworks.

573
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:33,040
I guess reflect the gamma rays.

574
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:34,040
Oh, yeah.

575
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:42,160
If this is what they were doing on iOS where there was a guardian at the gate so to speak,

576
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:47,520
I'm horrified to find out what they're actually doing on Android.

577
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:55,160
I think someone should get a proxy like Charles Proxy or one of those Wireshark where you

578
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:56,160
just watch the traffic.

579
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:57,160
Right.

580
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:58,160
Man in the middle of your phone and go like watch whatever is happening.

581
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:03,600
Man in the middle of your phone and see because I have a – this is – the opinions of

582
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:07,360
Mike do not necessarily reflect the opinions of Jupiter Broadcasting or Linux Academy.

583
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:12,880
But I have a suspicion that those apps are pretty chatty.

584
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:19,440
I'm just – there is one for Android and they have lots of apps on Android.

585
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:24,820
I know from experience that if I have a native Android app, I can do all kinds of crazy shit

586
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:27,240
with that person's phone.

587
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:28,720
No one can stop me.

588
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:29,720
Yeah.

589
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:31,600
That is well said.

590
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:37,160
The other part that was funny about this whole event is just how much of a weird sort of

591
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:41,480
mind game, psychological mind game it ended up being because they revoked the certificates

592
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:42,800
but just for a little bit.

593
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:44,800
They weren't saying like, nope, you're done with these things.

594
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:48,400
They still – they were like, well, I guess maybe – I'm curious one hand what you think

595
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:53,200
of like the pressures on Apple to not revoke those permanently or at least for a longer

596
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:57,880
time and the fact that like in a couple of days or one day or whatever the timeframe

597
00:29:57,880 --> 00:30:02,800
was back in business and like, yes, they've been checked, Google as you mentioned apologized.

598
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:03,800
But do you think that would work?

599
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:07,880
Like if they – if you violated it, they ran the ban hammer against you, would you

600
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:10,880
get it back so quick?

601
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:15,580
So there have been cases like that where a small dev shop has violated this policy and

602
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:20,440
not only do they revoke your certificates, they actually delete your dev account.

603
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:24,760
So the irony here is everybody – yeah, everybody is saying how hard Apple has been on Facebook

604
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:27,360
and Google.

605
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:31,120
This was a very light punishment relative to what they would have done to a smaller

606
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,120
player.

607
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:34,680
Yeah, like the fact that I had some internal blowback, okay, that was a little bit extra

608
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:39,360
but otherwise, it's kind of a slap on the wrist for them knowingly violating some policies.

609
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:45,960
So if Apple finds that you're doing something they don't like and there's a prominent

610
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:52,320
developer who makes an app called Dash who we were going to have on the show but then

611
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:59,000
he got in trouble with Apple and didn't want to go anywhere, they revoked his account.

612
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:03,200
And the answer to that problem is open a new corporation and reapply and change your name

613
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:12,320
and – they don't – how can I say this without being incendiary?

614
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:13,320
Just be incendiary.

615
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:14,320
You got this.

616
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:15,320
I'll just be incendiary, right?

617
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:19,280
They're not afraid to crush ants, right?

618
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:20,280
So let's take the case.

619
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:23,120
Let's just say I did what Facebook did.

620
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:27,560
I am not asserting that I did, I'm just hypothetically.

621
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:32,480
Not only would they revoke all my certificates immediately, they would actually throw me

622
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:37,320
out of the developer program and delete my account and I would have to open a new company

623
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:39,320
to get a new account.

624
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:40,320
Wow.

625
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:41,320
Yeah.

626
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:42,320
Right?

627
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:43,320
Yeah.

628
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:46,320
It wouldn't just be restored automatically, it wouldn't just kind of come back because

629
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:47,320
as you said –

630
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:48,320
No.

631
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:49,320
They wouldn't even talk to you.

632
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:54,320
What they do is they send you a form letter.

633
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:59,320
See, it's weird how lenient they were because this – and of course, you understand why

634
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:03,080
because deleting a dev account would also remove Facebook from iOS, right?

635
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:09,560
Which is crazy that they can't do that and I'm sure Facebook would sue for antitrust

636
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:20,580
or whatever or anti-competitive stuff but yeah, hypothetically, Westpain Technologies

637
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:26,760
would no longer be an iOS development company if you did the same thing and you were an

638
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:27,760
iOS developer.

639
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:34,040
The other elephant in this room here is that it's not like we have 10 different platforms

640
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:36,840
that people run mobile apps on, I mean, unless you're still using Blackberry.

641
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:37,840
Right?

642
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:38,840
Windows Phone for Life.

643
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:39,840
Windows Phone for Life.

644
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:42,680
Hey, there's plenty to love there.

645
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:50,040
But it means because so many people, especially sort of like relatively affluent or people

646
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:55,040
in big C-level people, there's just a lot of people choose to use that platform so they

647
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:58,800
have this inherent control just based on that choice.

648
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:00,680
And people who own like five homebots.

649
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:01,680
Yeah.

650
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:02,680
Mm-hmm.

651
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:03,680
Mm-hmm.

652
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:04,680
Okay.

653
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:05,680
Well, that's a lot of –

654
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:06,680
Apple sadness.

655
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:10,640
That's a lot of Apple sadness and unfortunately, I mean, I don't think anything's going to

656
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:14,880
change so it's kind of an interesting moment to take a beat and reflect on like what are

657
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:18,680
the realities of the market that we're all kind of playing in here and it's kind of

658
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:21,720
not what we think but I don't – personally, I don't expect anything to change anytime

659
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:22,720
soon.

660
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:23,720
I don't think it's going to change.

661
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:27,360
I think it's interesting how accepting as a community developers have become of these

662
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:34,520
closed – like closed and aggressively managed ecosystems but that's just, again, my hobby

663
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:35,520
horse.

664
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:38,280
Well, you guys can all let us know.

665
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:44,560
Head on over to coder.show, coder.show slash 343 for this episode specifically.

666
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:48,960
That also reminds me, maybe you're an Apple developer, maybe you have a Mac.

667
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:53,000
Well, some of our new shows, especially Choose Linux, that show we talked about and have

668
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:56,640
been talking about because it's just so darn good, well, they've been trending over

669
00:33:56,640 --> 00:34:02,320
on iTunes so if you lovely viewers and listeners out there happen to have an iTunes account,

670
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:06,240
please go, you know, leave a star rating or a view, go subscribe to it there.

671
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:07,940
I know you probably get things otherwise.

672
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:11,920
Not that many of us actually use iTunes for that purpose but it really does help people

673
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:12,920
find that.

679
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:40,780
Now Mike, I wanted to get a little more technical today since we've kind of spent things up

680
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:43,280
in high level at the start of the show.

681
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:46,320
I've been hearing a lot of buzz and I'm really curious what you think because I'm kind of

682
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:51,760
an outsider here but I've been hearing a lot of buzz about C Sharp 8.0 and some of the

683
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:56,120
stuff around nullable reference types and I kind of needed – I would like you to explain

684
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:57,760
what's going on there.

685
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:58,760
You know what?

686
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:00,240
I wish I understood.

687
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:06,880
There is a lot of buzz slash rage slash don't go on Reddit about C Sharp 8.

688
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:07,880
Well, that's just good advice.

689
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:08,880
Right.

690
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:09,880
Go on 4chan.

691
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:10,880
It's much better.

692
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:14,600
So C Sharp 8 and we mentioned this a few weeks ago is adding nullable types, right?

693
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:19,840
Nullable reference types, which is loosely like Swift Optionals.

694
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:27,360
I'm not going to dig into the exact details of how it works but basically, yay, right?

695
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:29,760
You have nullables.

696
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:32,420
That's great.

697
00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:36,600
Now that I'm doing a little bit of Rust and I'm kind of – I was doing a little Swift

698
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:38,000
before that.

699
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:44,000
I am starting to see the value of quote-unquote safety via things like nullables and optionals

700
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,000
and all that good stuff.

701
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:48,260
You're kind of – you're diving off just a little bit taking a sample of the functional

702
00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:49,800
programming deep end.

703
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:50,800
Exactly.

704
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:51,800
Exactly.

705
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:59,760
C Sharp has always been a little different in that there is just like so much existing

706
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:00,760
legacy code.

707
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:01,760
Yeah.

708
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:02,760
How long has it been around now?

709
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:07,520
Like there's a huge amount of legacy in that language.

710
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:13,080
This is a gross generalization but it is also the case that is widely used for line of business

711
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:16,040
applications that have been running forever.

712
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:21,560
So turning on the – so there's an option – let me just slow down.

713
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:30,280
There's an option in the C Sharp A compiler to – not require but to mark not handling

714
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:33,200
nullable cases as a warning.

715
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:34,640
Not an error but a warning.

716
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:39,600
Well, the issue with that is many corporations and many organizations, development organizations

717
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:45,080
in the.NET world, in their linters treat warnings like errors, right?

718
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:46,920
So you actually can't like commit or do anything.

719
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:47,920
Oh, yeah.

720
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:48,920
That will break your CI.

721
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:49,920
You won't be able to merge.

722
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:50,920
Right.

723
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:57,520
And the problem is like if you have C Sharp code from really anything that's not Greenfield,

724
00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:03,280
you're going to have like a million of these warnings.

725
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:09,520
There is some philosophical argument about if nullables are a good or bad thing.

726
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:15,240
Well, I do think they make your code slop – like look more like spaghetti-ish and –

727
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:18,120
You end up with a lot more like just sort of check-in stuff, right?

728
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:22,120
You end up counting from these nullables which is good because that's kind of what they're

729
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:23,120
trying to help you prevent, right?

730
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:25,520
It's missing the case when something can be null.

731
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:29,480
But there's probably lots of also cases where it didn't really matter and now you have just

732
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:30,480
extra stuff.

733
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:31,480
Yeah.

734
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:34,860
I mean when I first saw this in Swift, I was kind of like, okay, do I really need to do

735
00:37:34,860 --> 00:37:35,860
all this work?

736
00:37:35,860 --> 00:37:41,840
But you know what, I'm coming around to it only because code bases always get larger.

737
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:48,600
They always get more complex and while it's a little more of a hassle upfront, I see the

738
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:51,600
wisdom in making sure checking all these cases.

739
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:55,440
Again, that's what nullables are for.

740
00:37:55,440 --> 00:38:03,700
So I mean unless you can think of a good counter argument, I don't know that we want to dive

741
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:09,320
into the should you care about coding this way because I think the answer is yes, right?

742
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:14,360
In fact, other languages are starting to adopt this and I think in two years, everybody is

743
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:19,040
going to be doing something like again, what Swift calls optionals or nullables here.

744
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:20,040
Yeah.

745
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:21,640
I think there's a couple issues going on.

746
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:27,200
One is the case of like real optionality like missing data versus an empty key versus like

747
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:31,440
do we have this or do we know nothing about it and how do you handle extensibility and

748
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:33,920
sort of naturally extending and growing stuff?

749
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:37,640
And then there's the other case, like null seems like a special case, right?

750
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:40,360
The billion dollar mistake.

751
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:42,560
And I think there are styles of programming.

752
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:46,480
Basically, I think one way or another, you really do need to think about it.

753
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:51,440
And we talked about a little bit, one strategy is nil punning where you kind of assign stuff

754
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:52,500
so that nil makes sense.

755
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:56,440
So instead of getting like a null pointer exception when you try to take the head of

756
00:38:56,440 --> 00:39:00,740
some list that's actually nil, well, you get some reasonable value, probably nil again,

757
00:39:00,740 --> 00:39:02,860
but you get some reasonable value back.

758
00:39:02,860 --> 00:39:05,980
So that's one less static style.

759
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:08,780
There's also sort of stuff where you have like lots of upfront verification and then

760
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:13,100
pass stuff through or just having, you know, like not having nulls at all and figuring

761
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:14,580
out how to make that work.

762
00:39:14,580 --> 00:39:18,400
But I think what we don't want to see is big, complicated programs like you're talking about

763
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:22,620
that have maybe evolved over five, 10 years and you don't really know, right?

764
00:39:22,620 --> 00:39:23,620
There is no help.

765
00:39:23,620 --> 00:39:24,620
There's no annotations.

766
00:39:24,620 --> 00:39:26,880
There's nothing to tell you like what are the possible values?

767
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:31,300
And when nil is, I think a huge part of the problem is that nil isn't really a value.

768
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:34,700
It doesn't play in any of the interfaces that you might want it to, even if that could be

769
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:35,900
implemented and make sense.

770
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:39,460
So you end up with this value that just sort of like shows up and you can't work with and

771
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:41,680
ends up biting you at runtime.

772
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:42,680
So you're right.

773
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:47,140
Like I think this is especially a good case to be like, can we account for this?

774
00:39:47,140 --> 00:39:52,200
Is it easy enough to just say like, sometimes this is nil, compiler, help me not to forget

775
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:53,200
that.

776
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:57,580
There are a couple of places where this could be nil and make sure I handle it reasonably.

777
00:39:57,580 --> 00:40:01,900
Where I think you have to be careful and you're kind of hitting on is there are probably types

778
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:07,240
of programs or certain code bases where maybe that's overkill or there's another style that

779
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:09,240
could do the same without the verbosity.

780
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:13,080
Like I think we kind of get confused sometimes when we talk about programming.

781
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:15,140
Not everything is an enterprise C sharp app.

782
00:40:15,140 --> 00:40:17,240
Some are and like you should do it that way.

783
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:21,880
And there are other programs that maybe they're a script or like a small 200 line program

784
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:23,840
and you don't need it.

785
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:28,600
Or just like a Xamarin consumer app that you know if it crashes, it crashes, right?

786
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:34,000
I would add one thing though like I'm a little sympathetic to the naysayers here if only

787
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
for one reason.

788
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:43,440
The last three revisions, so let's say starting at C sharp six have really changed C sharp

789
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:44,440
I feel.

790
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:46,040
And they've done it in an additive way.

791
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:50,920
So like you could be boring and not use any of the new quote unquote cool stuff.

792
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:55,720
But I think it was six, maybe it was five for the addition of lambdas.

793
00:40:55,720 --> 00:41:03,240
Things more of this F sharp-y functional you know, say my name, say my name, my name is

794
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:07,000
Haskell kind of stuff is creeping in.

795
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:13,440
And I could definitely see how you know what, I'm sympathetic because I remember when like

796
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:18,960
Swift came in against Objective-C and like somebody's moving your cheese, right?

797
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:21,280
You don't really like it.

798
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:23,240
It's hard especially in a day-to-day productive language, right?

799
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:25,880
Where you're like, oh my gosh, what are all these new abstractions I suddenly have to

800
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:26,880
learn?

801
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:32,120
Well, and I would say this nullable stuff is even like more in your face because like

802
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:37,240
if you chose not to use like lambdas for instance, you would just not do that, right?

803
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:39,920
Like totally works to do it the old way.

804
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:45,920
If your boss or some hotshot on your team turns this flag on, you are going to see these

805
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:49,600
warnings and you are going to have to address them.

806
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:51,680
So I get it.

807
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:57,760
I keep wondering like how much more stuff can Microsoft Voltron onto C sharp.

808
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:58,760
Yes, right.

809
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:03,680
And the answer is they see a feature in their language and they basically just go for it.

810
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:05,880
So you were talking about a little bit there and you kind of alluded to it, but there's

811
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:08,540
been pushback in the community, right?

812
00:42:08,540 --> 00:42:10,760
Like there's not everyone's happy about it.

813
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:14,600
Yeah, there's been a lot of pushback.

814
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:21,240
I have spent a lot of time this week or last week rather trying to read some of the account

815
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:22,240
arguments.

816
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:24,440
I was really trying to find one that I thought was like good, like a good blog post.

817
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:31,360
I didn't find any that I found particularly compelling.

818
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:35,280
I think some of them were just like, I'm mad because I don't like change, right?

819
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:36,280
Like that's bad.

820
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:37,280
You're always going to have that.

821
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:38,280
Yeah.

822
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:39,280
Right.

823
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:40,280
I think that's a stupid argument.

824
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:47,000
One I did find that was interesting was like C sharp was meant to be a better Java, a OO

825
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:51,000
language and now we're bolting on all this functional programming stuff to it.

826
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:56,320
I actually think that that's still not a great argument, but I see where it comes from.

827
00:42:56,320 --> 00:43:00,280
It comes from like an idea of like, you know what, Haskell is a functional programming

828
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:04,600
language and Haskell is what it is, right?

829
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:10,440
So if you wanted a pure OO language, you could just use Ruby.

830
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:11,440
You sure could.

831
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:12,440
You sure could.

832
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:13,440
I'm just telling you.

833
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:14,440
Everything is an object.

834
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:15,440
It's great.

835
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:21,080
I don't even know how to say this, but emotionally I get it.

836
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:26,840
I understand that argument, but intellectually from an engineering perspective, I actually

837
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:29,840
still think it's stupid and stupid in the nicest way possible, right?

838
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:38,880
Like it's C sharp is one of these languages that I think in our entire industry, C sharp

839
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:40,480
actually has a unique place.

840
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:41,480
Oh yeah.

841
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:44,560
Go into that a little bit more because what keeps coming into my mind and they're both

842
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:48,400
very different, but like obviously the closest thing is Java, which has also evolved with

843
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:52,040
Lambdas and streams and all that and then at the same time, another language that keeps

844
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:55,520
evolving and growing things is JavaScript.

845
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:58,660
So where does C sharp fall in all this?

846
00:43:58,660 --> 00:44:04,960
So in my mind, C sharp is being asked if we just like, let's just think about it for a

847
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:05,960
minute.

848
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:10,400
High quality desktop applications for professionals, games, right?

849
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:13,480
Via Unity, mono game, all that fun stuff.

850
00:44:13,480 --> 00:44:19,440
You know, enterprise software, web applications via ASP.net and.NET Core and all that, an

851
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:26,920
entire like pantheon of Microsoft web technologies, embedded via.NET, embedded via Microsoft

852
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:34,280
or what is it now called, Azure IoT, Windows embedded, Windows C, like there is a million

853
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:35,280
domains.

854
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:41,340
Like you can really program an Arduino board in C sharp and you can also write like a little,

855
00:44:41,340 --> 00:44:43,800
you know, flashlight app for iOS.

856
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:47,600
So again, mobile would be another universal.

857
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:48,600
Absolutely.

858
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:54,760
And what I think is happening is that you know what?

859
00:44:54,760 --> 00:45:00,280
If I had to be stranded on a desert island and only know one programming language, it

860
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:04,080
would not be crazy for that language to be C sharp because you can basically do everything

861
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:07,960
if you know the APIs and the frameworks.

862
00:45:07,960 --> 00:45:12,800
But you're asking a lot of one language.

863
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:13,800
I see what you're saying.

864
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:16,800
There's sort of a, there's a trade off here of like, okay, well C sharp has been great

865
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:21,000
and lots of good software and bad, but lots of good software has been developed with it.

866
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:25,960
Is the legacy of having that worth trying to graph this stuff versus like everyone just

867
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:29,600
moved to F sharp or Swift or whatever, you know, new language that kind of takes that

868
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:32,880
place that's learned from all these things.

869
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:35,960
What's funny is like our industry hasn't actually been around that long.

870
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:39,020
You know, if you think about like whenever the fifties and we, so we've only been through

871
00:45:39,020 --> 00:45:40,560
a couple of these cycles.

872
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:41,960
I don't think we really know what it means.

873
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:46,580
Like Java, maybe in one universe someone would have expected to have faded away, but no,

874
00:45:46,580 --> 00:45:48,880
it's continued and it's changed and it's grafted.

875
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:52,480
So by and large still runs the old stuff.

876
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:53,480
Yeah.

877
00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:57,560
I mean, it's, I mean, Java is another weird case.

878
00:45:57,560 --> 00:46:01,760
I think, I think Java actually should have been where C sharp is, but because of weird

879
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:02,760
Oracle stuff.

880
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:03,760
Right.

881
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:04,760
Yeah.

882
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:05,760
Oh boy.

883
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:06,760
Right.

884
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:07,760
So we just ignore that.

885
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:08,760
Like I think about Ruby a little bit here, right?

886
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:16,340
Where it is theoretically possible for me to program an IOT board in Ruby, right?

887
00:46:16,340 --> 00:46:19,480
Like there are libraries that will let me do that.

888
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:23,560
I can certainly, and I have written my, my, some of my utility scripts for like just like

889
00:46:23,560 --> 00:46:25,760
day-to-day stuff are in Ruby.

890
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:26,760
Same.

891
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:31,080
That's not the optimal use for Ruby, right?

892
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:36,100
And no one's claiming that Ruby should be this, you know, one size fits all programming

893
00:46:36,100 --> 00:46:37,760
language for a million different things, right?

894
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:44,520
For mobile apps to, you know, AAA games where C sharp, Microsoft is actually trying to do

895
00:46:44,520 --> 00:46:45,520
that, right?

896
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:47,200
This is the one language to rule them all.

897
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:48,200
Yeah, you're right.

898
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:51,520
I mean, cause it does kind of like, it plays, especially with some of the, like the link

899
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:55,200
stuff, you can kind of write like high level data pipeline processing, but at the same

900
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:57,680
time,.NET is a surprisingly static runtime environment.

901
00:46:57,680 --> 00:47:01,700
So you can have, you know, like a pretty lean low latency GC that you're running with.

902
00:47:01,700 --> 00:47:03,400
You can run in small environments.

903
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:07,120
Well, and there's all kinds of adapters for lower level stuff, right?

904
00:47:07,120 --> 00:47:10,320
I mean, if you really want to get really into the dark side, you can call into the old windows

905
00:47:10,320 --> 00:47:11,320
com.

906
00:47:11,320 --> 00:47:12,320
Oh, is that?

907
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:13,320
Oh man.

908
00:47:13,320 --> 00:47:14,320
Wow.

909
00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:15,320
Yeah.

910
00:47:15,320 --> 00:47:19,280
I mean, the way you would do that is several showers after I'm pretty sure you just cry

911
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:20,280
yourself asleep.

912
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:21,280
It's fine.

913
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:22,280
Right.

914
00:47:22,280 --> 00:47:23,280
The tears, they're cleansing, cleansing.

915
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:27,360
I don't know how we got to the com API thing.

916
00:47:27,360 --> 00:47:28,360
I think we hit a wall.

917
00:47:28,360 --> 00:47:29,360
I think so.

918
00:47:29,360 --> 00:47:30,360
Yeah.

919
00:47:30,360 --> 00:47:31,480
I mean, I'm glad to hear that you're for it.

920
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:34,760
I mean, it's kind of also reminds me of some of the transitions shops went through with

921
00:47:34,760 --> 00:47:40,080
like deploying Scala, um, in like Java shops where you could kind of use it as like a,

922
00:47:40,080 --> 00:47:43,040
you know, just a better, a better Java with some fancy stuff.

923
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:46,720
But then you have some people maybe on your team that really go off the deep end and explore

924
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:51,120
cats or other, you know, other super functional libraries doing lenses and getting super Haskell

925
00:47:51,120 --> 00:47:52,120
about it.

926
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:56,240
And it does seem like in a team environment where both of those languages shine, you have

927
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:59,280
to be, you have to be really aware of, you know, what are, what are the standards other

928
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:03,800
people are going to reasonably be able to use and learn and where's the, where's the

929
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:07,000
curve change on the value to safety sort of thing, right?

930
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:10,280
Cause you do want safe apps, you want safe code, but especially in a business environment

931
00:48:10,280 --> 00:48:14,320
at the end of the day, like it's got to be safe enough to work reasonably well.

932
00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:16,280
Perfect ends up never shipping.

933
00:48:16,280 --> 00:48:17,280
Yeah.

934
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:22,800
It'll be interesting to follow this is in rust and it automatically ships.

935
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:23,800
Right.

936
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:24,800
Yeah, exactly.

937
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:25,800
Once it compiles, you just, you just ship it and it's, it's done.

938
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:27,000
You know, it's perfect.

939
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,600
If it compile, listen, if it compiles, it's perfect.

940
00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:30,600
Isn't that the rust model?

941
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:31,600
I believe so.

942
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:32,600
Haskell, Haskell as well.

943
00:48:32,600 --> 00:48:33,600
Yeah.

944
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:34,600
Right.

945
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:37,080
And if it compiles, the compiler has got your back so you don't have to worry about it.

946
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:38,080
That's right.

947
00:48:38,080 --> 00:48:39,080
Uh, well this'll be fascinating.

948
00:48:39,080 --> 00:48:43,800
And I like, I mean, it seems like the, the industry can't help but continue to be pulled

949
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:47,160
in this direction, both from the dynamic and the static side.

950
00:48:47,160 --> 00:48:50,120
We're exploring more of this stuff and where does it end?

951
00:48:50,120 --> 00:48:51,120
Where does it stop?

952
00:48:51,120 --> 00:48:56,280
I guess I'll just have to keep listening to Coder radio to find out.

953
00:48:56,280 --> 00:49:01,280
It's easy to do though, because you just head on over to coder.show, go to slash three 43

954
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:02,600
if you want to find this episode.

955
00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:07,760
Otherwise you can find our entire backlog, head on over to Jupiter broadcasting.com to

We've just got our second episode with the new co-host Jim.

962
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:30,920
So go check that out if you want to get some clarification about what's happening over

963
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:34,880
in the world of open ZFS and Linux and you can find me on Twitter.

964
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:35,880
I'm at Westpane.

965
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:38,320
Mike, I believe you're there too.

966
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:40,880
Yep, at Jim Monoco on Twitter.

967
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:41,880
Beautiful.

968
00:49:41,880 --> 00:50:09,960
Thank you everyone for joining us and we'll see you next week.
