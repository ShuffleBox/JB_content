00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
This is Koda Radio, episode 365 for July 8th, 2019.

00:30.000 --> 00:38.560
Hello, and welcome to Koda Radio, Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show that takes

00:38.560 --> 00:47.240
a pragmatic look at the art and business of software development and related technologies.

00:47.240 --> 00:53.480
My name is Wes, and I'm very pleased to be joined by that fire-cracking Florvidian who's

00:53.480 --> 00:57.680
had one too many fireworks this time around, Mr. Michael Dominic.

00:57.680 --> 00:58.680
Hi, Mike.

00:58.680 --> 01:00.240
Get off my lawn!

01:00.240 --> 01:01.240
I know.

01:01.240 --> 01:06.600
I transitioned from being a, you know, like a fun-loving lad in my youth who liked blowing

01:06.600 --> 01:07.600
things up, frankly.

01:07.600 --> 01:08.600
Yeah.

01:08.600 --> 01:12.600
And now I'm a dog owner, so it's just about the worst thing in the world.

01:12.600 --> 01:17.400
I think we've got one other person who snuck in in the nick of time.

01:17.400 --> 01:18.400
Mr. Chris Vischer.

01:18.400 --> 01:19.400
Hello, Chris.

01:19.400 --> 01:20.400
Hey, guys.

01:20.400 --> 01:21.400
Thanks for having me back.

01:21.400 --> 01:22.400
Oh, we wouldn't be without you.

01:22.400 --> 01:24.920
I kind of am a little relieved that I'm not the only one.

01:24.920 --> 01:26.720
I had the same transition.

01:26.720 --> 01:28.760
Like this year, I was like, oh, can we just not?

01:28.760 --> 01:29.760
Yep.

01:29.760 --> 01:30.760
It's just, yeah, it's kind of a futz.

01:30.760 --> 01:32.880
Honestly, I prefer just the professional shows.

01:32.880 --> 01:34.720
You know, you can go there if you want to see it.

01:34.720 --> 01:36.840
It's usually away from most of the housing.

01:36.840 --> 01:38.560
I could even go with another compromise.

01:38.560 --> 01:45.240
How about we just all agree from like 8 p.m. to midnight, you have that on the 4th of July,

01:45.240 --> 01:46.880
and we'll just all prepare for that.

01:46.880 --> 01:50.760
It's like the day before, and today we're recording on the 8th, and my neighbors are

01:50.760 --> 01:52.720
still setting off fireworks.

01:52.720 --> 01:53.720
Still going strong.

01:53.720 --> 01:57.160
I'm kind of like, okay, how about we just compromise, meet somewhere in the middle here?

01:57.160 --> 01:58.160
That's all.

01:58.160 --> 01:59.160
I'm such an old man.

01:59.160 --> 02:03.320
I looked up how to do some CSS fireworks, so that's another tech-powered solution.

02:03.320 --> 02:04.840
Just don't blow anything up.

02:04.840 --> 02:05.840
Use the computer.

02:05.840 --> 02:10.040
I just wanted to go out to the neighborhood kids and say, this is the blink tag.

02:10.040 --> 02:11.320
Knock yourselves out.

02:11.320 --> 02:12.320
You know what?

02:12.320 --> 02:14.600
It is the real-life version of the blink tag, isn't it?

02:14.600 --> 02:15.600
It really is, right?

02:15.600 --> 02:16.600
Good call.

02:16.600 --> 02:18.560
I think that's exactly it.

02:18.560 --> 02:22.960
Okay, now, I feel a little fronted here, because every time I come on the show, you guys put

02:22.960 --> 02:27.840
Mac news stories in the doc, and I didn't do any of this.

02:27.840 --> 02:29.280
I will back you up on this.

02:29.280 --> 02:31.480
It just happens, and we've talked about it enough.

02:31.480 --> 02:32.480
It was Joe.

02:32.480 --> 02:34.860
We want to follow up on stories that we cover, right?

02:34.860 --> 02:35.860
It just makes sense.

02:35.860 --> 02:36.860
It's our instinct.

02:36.860 --> 02:39.840
I think Alan, Jude, and Joe are conspiring against me to get the audience to think that

02:39.840 --> 02:42.920
I'm the Mac guy on the show, is what it is.

02:42.920 --> 02:44.400
You guys are just complicit.

02:44.400 --> 02:49.600
Despite overseeing the Linux-ification, that's hard to say, but regardless, you made that

02:49.600 --> 02:51.160
happen here in the studio, right?

02:51.160 --> 02:53.200
And there's hardly a Mac to be seen.

02:53.200 --> 02:56.360
I prefer the term freeing the studio, Wes.

02:56.360 --> 02:57.920
Oh, freeing the studio.

02:57.920 --> 02:58.920
Oh.

02:58.920 --> 02:59.920
Oh, God.

02:59.920 --> 03:02.160
It was more about philosophy than functionality.

03:02.160 --> 03:03.160
Burn!

03:03.160 --> 03:04.160
Nice!

03:04.160 --> 03:07.440
Wow, I am really impressed how you turned that around on me.

03:07.440 --> 03:08.720
Dang it.

03:08.720 --> 03:15.120
Okay, well, yeah, so I think the big hoopla story that kind of leads into this thing that

03:15.120 --> 03:20.520
I was sort of implying is, A, it's now, as you guys talked about, on the record, that

03:20.520 --> 03:22.800
Johnny Ive is officially on the way out.

03:22.800 --> 03:23.800
See ya!

03:23.800 --> 03:29.480
B, we've had that Wall Street Journal article that said that Cook wasn't involved, and then

03:29.480 --> 03:32.480
we had Tim Cook make this super strong response.

03:32.480 --> 03:34.520
Oh, yeah, that was a little awkward.

03:34.520 --> 03:39.080
And now, there is what seems to me, at least having followed this for a while, so this

03:39.080 --> 03:43.920
is where I get this kind of feeling, is a very intentionally leaked story.

03:43.920 --> 03:48.380
Because now we have multiple sources that are claiming that the new MacBook Pro later

03:48.380 --> 03:52.880
this year will have a totally new keyboard mechanism.

03:52.880 --> 03:56.280
And when you start seeing these kinds of leaks, and I'm curious to know Mike's take on this,

03:56.280 --> 04:01.520
it kind of feels like an intentional leak by Apple to set a narrative after this Ive

04:01.520 --> 04:02.520
announcement.

04:02.520 --> 04:07.920
Wait, wait, are you suggesting that they would conveniently try to imply that the crappy

04:07.920 --> 04:13.240
keyboard that was way too thin to be useful was the responsibility of a very controversial

04:13.240 --> 04:17.080
and famous designer, who that now he's leaving, we can have a good keyboard?

04:17.080 --> 04:18.480
Is that what you're trying to say?

04:18.480 --> 04:21.320
I mean, it kind of seems that way, Mike.

04:21.320 --> 04:22.520
It kind of seems that way.

04:22.520 --> 04:30.200
It wasn't it interesting how Tim Cook, very Clark Kent-esque, flew around the media saying,

04:30.200 --> 04:32.920
I make all these decisions.

04:32.920 --> 04:34.080
And now we have a good keyboard.

04:34.080 --> 04:38.800
Yeah, I mean, you know, this is some Floridian Gator Bacon.

04:38.800 --> 04:40.440
I don't think Johnny Ive cares.

04:40.440 --> 04:42.800
I think he's a knight and rich.

04:42.800 --> 04:43.800
Yeah, it's true.

04:43.800 --> 04:47.040
I mean, he comes out of this fine in every situation.

04:47.040 --> 04:53.080
But if anybody's ever shipped a product, particularly physical products, there's just no way this

04:53.080 --> 04:54.080
just happened, right?

04:54.080 --> 04:55.080
Oh, yeah, right.

04:55.080 --> 04:58.040
I mean, it's got to be in the works for a long time.

04:58.040 --> 04:59.400
Oh, no doubt about it.

04:59.400 --> 05:00.400
No doubt.

05:00.400 --> 05:05.720
I think it's been, I think the Ive transition has been in the works since Apple Park wrapped

05:05.720 --> 05:06.720
up.

05:06.720 --> 05:07.720
That's my estimation.

05:07.720 --> 05:10.680
If you look back at some of the way they've been communicating about Ive's role and the

05:10.680 --> 05:14.360
promotion that he got around then and all of that, it kind of all equals to the beginning

05:14.360 --> 05:16.720
of a transition.

05:16.720 --> 05:22.720
And I would say there was no winning here for Apple, because if Tim Cook was hyper-involved

05:22.720 --> 05:27.640
and trying to be involved in every single design decision, something tells me Johnny

05:27.640 --> 05:29.760
Ive wouldn't like that either.

05:29.760 --> 05:34.240
So it's either he's not involved enough, or he's too involved, and I don't think there

05:34.240 --> 05:38.200
was ever going to be a happy medium because it's just my sense of the personality types

05:38.200 --> 05:39.200
at work here.

05:39.200 --> 05:44.040
And Apple's trying to combat the narrative that I perhaps way too hard hit last week

05:44.040 --> 05:48.480
that Tim Cook really is effectively an operations guy, right?

05:48.480 --> 05:53.840
Because I don't know why, we've all three of us talked about this for a long time on

05:53.840 --> 05:57.920
different shows in this show, but for some reason the big tech companies love the idea

05:57.920 --> 06:00.720
of the CEO as like the god king coming down and –

06:00.720 --> 06:01.720
Right.

06:01.720 --> 06:02.720
The tyrant.

06:02.720 --> 06:03.720
Yeah.

06:03.720 --> 06:04.720
Yes.

06:04.720 --> 06:05.720
I think it's silly.

06:05.720 --> 06:08.880
I would actually be more impressed if they came down and said, my name is Tim Cook.

06:08.880 --> 06:12.000
I am one of the best operations people in the world.

06:12.000 --> 06:16.320
So I just hired the best programmers and designers to do that for me.

06:16.320 --> 06:17.320
But they can't say that.

06:17.320 --> 06:18.320
I don't know.

06:18.320 --> 06:19.320
That's what I would say.

06:19.320 --> 06:20.320
It seems like a pretty reasonable approach.

06:20.320 --> 06:23.120
And how other industries do it, right?

06:23.120 --> 06:24.920
I mean, you're there to operate the business.

06:24.920 --> 06:26.800
The ones that aren't media darling industries.

06:26.800 --> 06:29.280
Although, I mean, Apple does things a little differently, right?

06:29.280 --> 06:34.600
And their history has been kind of written by these big design changes.

06:34.600 --> 06:35.960
It was not business as usual.

06:35.960 --> 06:41.080
I think we also have to be fair, they're sort of the architect of the celebrity CEO for

06:41.080 --> 06:42.080
the tech industry.

06:42.080 --> 06:43.080
Yeah.

06:43.080 --> 06:44.080
He's not the first celebrity CEO.

06:44.080 --> 06:45.080
I mean, hello, Edison.

06:45.080 --> 06:46.080
Hello, Mark Shuttleworth.

06:46.080 --> 06:47.080
Yeah.

06:47.080 --> 06:52.440
But, you know, for that Silicon Valley area, he sort of is the architect – architect,

06:52.440 --> 06:53.440
whatever I'm trying to say.

06:53.440 --> 06:55.640
We're talking about Ken Metcalf, right?

06:55.640 --> 06:57.720
No, of course not.

06:57.720 --> 06:59.720
I'm talking about Wozniak.

06:59.720 --> 07:04.560
It seems only kind of fair that people still view them in that light.

07:04.560 --> 07:08.240
But it's not the reality of a company of their scale.

07:08.240 --> 07:15.480
When you look at the people on the team, like Craig Federighi and Phil Schiller, and I would

07:15.480 --> 07:19.440
have probably cited Ive before, they seem like exceptionally talented individuals who

07:19.440 --> 07:22.680
have been at the company for a very long time.

07:22.680 --> 07:25.720
And recently, they've been featured more and more on podcasts.

07:25.720 --> 07:31.300
I've actually gotten a chance to hear them in a less structured, less promotional setting.

07:31.300 --> 07:32.300
And they're very intelligent individuals.

07:32.300 --> 07:35.880
I don't know if you've had that same assessment, Mike, but it seems like, for example, Craig

07:35.880 --> 07:37.800
Federighi really knows his shit.

07:37.800 --> 07:38.800
Of course, right?

07:38.800 --> 07:42.280
I mean, for all our trolling on this show, which, by the way, is supposed to be entertainment

07:42.280 --> 07:43.580
too, right?

07:43.580 --> 07:48.520
You don't become a director of insert department here at Apple without being a very smart,

07:48.520 --> 07:49.520
very capable person.

07:49.520 --> 07:50.520
Yeah.

07:50.520 --> 07:51.520
That was too nice.

07:51.520 --> 07:54.080
Yeah, I just expected some further vitriol there.

07:54.080 --> 07:55.080
No, no.

07:55.080 --> 07:56.080
All right.

07:56.080 --> 07:59.760
So to the topic on point here that really matters to the audience is, depending on who

07:59.760 --> 08:05.880
you follow, some people would argue that the MacBook Pro is one of the premier developer

08:05.880 --> 08:08.320
systems, especially if you're in Xcode.

08:08.320 --> 08:11.600
It's one of your only options, really, if you want to be a mobile developer.

08:11.600 --> 08:13.880
Or if you want to do HomePod development.

08:13.880 --> 08:17.960
Still now, if you go work for some big tech company, more than likely, you're getting

08:17.960 --> 08:19.480
a MacBook, right, on your first day.

08:19.480 --> 08:24.080
So the potential ramifications here are a new MacBook Pro with a larger screen that

08:24.080 --> 08:28.960
is, let's just say, in theory, for the sake of this conversation, designed by that new

08:28.960 --> 08:34.520
or help design led by that new Pro team, the same team that had influence on the iMac Pro,

08:34.520 --> 08:37.440
the new Mac Mini, and the Mac Pro.

08:37.440 --> 08:42.040
Let's say they've also been involved in a Mac Pro for professionals, like the King Mac

08:42.040 --> 08:43.040
Pro.

08:43.040 --> 08:44.040
They're going to have to call it...

08:44.040 --> 08:45.040
They can't call it Mac Pro Plus or whatever.

08:45.040 --> 08:46.040
Maybe they will.

08:46.040 --> 08:47.040
Is it like a Mac Pro Pro?

08:47.040 --> 08:48.040
Wait.

08:48.040 --> 08:49.040
Maybe they'll call it...

08:49.040 --> 08:50.040
What do they call the...

08:50.040 --> 08:51.040
Is it X...

08:51.040 --> 08:52.040
What do they call the larger iPhone?

08:52.040 --> 08:53.040
Is it just plus and still?

08:53.040 --> 08:54.040
XL.

08:54.040 --> 08:55.040
It's XL.

08:55.040 --> 08:56.040
Maybe that's...

08:56.040 --> 08:57.040
Maybe they'll call it the MacBook XL.

08:57.040 --> 08:58.040
I mean, I don't know.

08:58.040 --> 08:59.040
I could see it.

08:59.040 --> 09:00.040
Yeah.

09:00.040 --> 09:01.040
Or they'll just call it the MacBook 16-inch.

09:01.040 --> 09:04.040
And it'll just be implied that the 16-inch version is more powerful.

09:04.040 --> 09:05.040
Of course.

09:05.040 --> 09:06.040
Right.

09:06.040 --> 09:07.720
And the rumor here is that it switches to...

09:07.720 --> 09:09.520
Actually the rumor is they're going to start with a MacBook Air.

09:09.520 --> 09:13.440
But I just like for the purposes of conversation, let's say they launch a MacBook Pro larger

09:13.440 --> 09:14.440
screen.

09:14.440 --> 09:15.440
This one even has an SD card reader.

09:15.440 --> 09:16.440
It's got a new keyboard.

09:16.440 --> 09:21.040
It's still all USB-C, but it's got lots of USB-C. They're all Thunderbolt 3 ports.

09:21.040 --> 09:22.240
It's got this bigger screen.

09:22.240 --> 09:23.580
It's got a great keyboard.

09:23.580 --> 09:25.760
Let's just for the sake of argument say it's like the T480's keyboard.

09:25.760 --> 09:26.760
It's quite nice.

09:26.760 --> 09:27.760
Okay.

09:27.760 --> 09:29.560
Have they solved the problem?

09:29.560 --> 09:30.560
Is the criticism...

09:30.560 --> 09:31.720
Is all the criticism done?

09:31.720 --> 09:33.560
Is the conversation dead at that point?

09:33.560 --> 09:34.560
Or is there more?

09:34.560 --> 09:35.560
Is there like a software layer?

09:35.560 --> 09:36.560
Right?

09:36.560 --> 09:38.000
I mean, you've got Peru there.

09:38.000 --> 09:41.320
You're probably developing for Linux, at least if you're doing the enterprise side

09:41.320 --> 09:42.320
of things.

09:42.320 --> 09:43.520
It depends on what you mean, right?

09:43.520 --> 09:46.880
Are you defining the problem as like the 20-something percent failure rate?

09:46.880 --> 09:49.120
Because yeah, if you fix that, you fix that, right?

09:49.120 --> 09:52.620
Well also it's just that they're extremely uncomfortable to type on, especially when

09:52.620 --> 09:53.620
you're typing a lot.

09:53.620 --> 09:55.600
At least for me, maybe because I'm an old typist.

09:55.600 --> 09:56.880
I mean, I've been typing for...

09:56.880 --> 09:57.880
Yeah, they hurt.

09:57.880 --> 09:58.880
Oh, they hurt.

09:58.880 --> 09:59.880
Oh no, it hurts.

09:59.880 --> 10:00.880
Yeah.

10:00.880 --> 10:01.880
Yeah.

10:01.880 --> 10:05.840
But if they could make it a competitive product like that again, they may solve the criticism.

10:05.840 --> 10:08.920
Now ironically, this particular rumor that we have linked in the show notes is about

10:08.920 --> 10:10.080
the MacBook Air.

10:10.080 --> 10:13.280
The 16-inch won't even get the keyboard this year is what it suggests.

10:13.280 --> 10:14.760
The 16-inch that hasn't even been announced yet.

10:14.760 --> 10:20.120
I mean, my issue as a buyer of these devices has always been that this is your most expensive

10:20.120 --> 10:23.720
laptop and it is also your most unreliable.

10:23.720 --> 10:24.720
Unreliable?

10:24.720 --> 10:25.720
What do you mean?

10:25.720 --> 10:27.080
Well, no, it's not...

10:27.080 --> 10:28.440
This is not me asserting this, right?

10:28.440 --> 10:29.440
This is...

10:29.440 --> 10:30.440
People have...

10:30.440 --> 10:31.440
Not Consumer Reports.

10:31.440 --> 10:32.440
There's a...

10:32.440 --> 10:34.040
Is it Anandtech?

10:34.040 --> 10:35.040
Who does the...

10:35.040 --> 10:37.680
What they think the return rates and defect rates are on all the Apple products?

10:37.680 --> 10:39.160
Oh, the people that try to...

10:39.160 --> 10:40.160
Yeah.

10:40.160 --> 10:41.160
Yeah, it is 20-something percent.

10:41.160 --> 10:46.960
And for a laptop that is minimum gonna be $2,000 unless you're buying a base model and

10:46.960 --> 10:51.000
probably for someone who has heavier needs, 3,000.

10:51.000 --> 10:52.000
I don't know.

10:52.000 --> 10:53.920
Even if it's just 21%, right?

10:53.920 --> 10:56.000
That's not an acceptable failure rate in my opinion.

10:56.000 --> 10:57.000
Boy, that would be...

10:57.000 --> 10:58.000
No, no, that would be...

10:58.000 --> 11:00.080
If that's true, if that number is true, that would be...

11:00.080 --> 11:01.640
I mean, there's no way it could be that high.

11:01.640 --> 11:05.120
Well, I mean, the Wall Street Journal did an entire piece on it, right?

11:05.120 --> 11:06.120
It's not...

11:06.120 --> 11:07.120
This isn't...

11:07.120 --> 11:08.120
I mean, I know they're bad.

11:08.120 --> 11:09.120
I agree with you there.

11:09.120 --> 11:10.120
And they should be a lot better.

11:10.120 --> 11:15.220
I feel like I am that guy who always says, oh, the solution to Android's shortcomings

11:15.220 --> 11:16.400
is just to flash it with lineage.

11:16.400 --> 11:18.400
I'm gonna be that guy for a moment, but...

11:18.400 --> 11:19.760
Lay it on us.

11:19.760 --> 11:24.680
Apple seems to be moving in the direction of supporting macOS more and more under virtualization

11:24.680 --> 11:28.160
to the extent that they're even adding Vert.io drivers to...

11:28.160 --> 11:29.680
Isn't that interesting?

11:29.680 --> 11:33.280
Not even just to Catalina, but they're bringing those Vert.io drivers to the...

11:33.280 --> 11:35.640
What's the current version of macOS?

11:35.640 --> 11:36.640
Mojave?

11:36.640 --> 11:41.280
Yes, they're bringing them to Mojave even, in the latest releases of Mojave.

11:41.280 --> 11:42.280
Wow.

11:42.280 --> 11:45.520
Now, these Vert.io drivers are what allow an operating system to have drivers that are

11:45.520 --> 11:47.160
aware it's being virtualized.

11:47.160 --> 11:48.720
It's optimized for virtualization.

11:48.720 --> 11:51.360
Yeah, it communicates intelligently with the hypervisor.

11:51.360 --> 11:53.320
And that's not an accident.

11:53.320 --> 11:54.320
Those don't just accidentally...

11:54.320 --> 11:55.320
Whoopsie, Vert.io.

11:55.320 --> 11:56.320
Mm-hmm.

11:56.320 --> 12:01.240
And Windows 10 also works really great under virtualization.

12:01.240 --> 12:06.760
And when you use an AMD card with PCI pass-through, you can have full GPU acceleration for both

12:06.760 --> 12:07.760
of these...

12:07.760 --> 12:12.200
You can't do it at the same time, but you can load a VM and have full GPU pass-through

12:12.200 --> 12:17.400
for either OS on any hardware you want that supports virtualization.

12:17.400 --> 12:19.000
Which is a lot these days.

12:19.000 --> 12:20.160
And I think it's time...

12:20.160 --> 12:21.960
We were just having a pre-show conversation.

12:21.960 --> 12:27.760
We have here at the studio and also on our VPSs, we have divorced, as many of you probably

12:27.760 --> 12:29.680
have, the applications from the operating system.

12:29.680 --> 12:33.540
Well, now we can divorce the operating system from the hardware.

12:33.540 --> 12:34.540
It's all available to us.

12:34.540 --> 12:36.680
It just takes a little extra setup, but you do it once, right?

12:36.680 --> 12:40.720
Well, you do it once, and then you've got it all configured and ready to go, right?

12:40.720 --> 12:45.280
If you are someone like me who mostly is now developing server-side software, and frankly,

12:45.280 --> 12:51.040
some Windows desktop, mostly server-side running on Ubuntu, Linux, or SUSE, why would I not

12:51.040 --> 12:56.240
just VM, Mac OS, Catalina for when I need it, and literally buy the nicest laptop with

12:56.240 --> 12:58.560
the best eGPU that I could possibly afford?

12:58.560 --> 13:00.140
Would you spend most of your time there?

13:00.140 --> 13:01.140
Would you be switching around?

13:01.140 --> 13:03.080
Because you still got your question of where are you spending...

13:03.080 --> 13:04.200
It's not super portable.

13:04.200 --> 13:06.080
That's the biggest downside I find.

13:06.080 --> 13:08.960
However, there are ways to do...

13:08.960 --> 13:13.960
And this is an area I don't really know much about, but on modern, like our laptops, your

13:13.960 --> 13:18.000
laptop right there, supports virtualizing the GPU.

13:18.000 --> 13:23.720
So you can actually carve out your Intel GPU as a dedicated GPU to the VMs all in that

13:23.720 --> 13:24.720
laptop.

13:24.720 --> 13:25.720
You just only have Intel graphics.

13:25.720 --> 13:28.040
There's a bunch of caveats with that, I thought.

13:28.040 --> 13:29.240
Isn't it like dependent on which...

13:29.240 --> 13:32.120
It doesn't matter really, but which one you have and which kind of virtualization.

13:32.120 --> 13:33.120
Yeah.

13:33.120 --> 13:36.200
I mean, all of this stuff is pretty hardware-specific, and you've got to know which flags to look

13:36.200 --> 13:40.360
through and match up the CPU and the motherboard and how all that works.

13:40.360 --> 13:44.520
Like I say, it takes a little bit of work, but then you have sort of the stability and

13:44.520 --> 13:47.240
reliability of virtualization under those operating systems, too.

13:47.240 --> 13:51.680
So then you gain things like snapshots before an update, before all those kinds of things.

13:51.680 --> 13:54.720
So you actually bring a level of stability to your development environment that you don't

13:54.720 --> 13:57.240
have when it's running on native hardware.

13:57.240 --> 14:00.040
Like I said, at the top of this, I'm going to be the guy that says, solve all your Android

14:00.040 --> 14:01.320
problems by running lineage.

14:01.320 --> 14:05.440
It's not really an option for everybody, but I think maybe it's more of an option than

14:05.440 --> 14:06.440
people realize.

14:06.440 --> 14:10.040
Because I'm on a laptop, I didn't think it was possible.

14:10.040 --> 14:11.680
And it's game changer.

14:11.680 --> 14:13.240
Especially if like, yeah, like your mic, right?

14:13.240 --> 14:16.240
Maybe you just need to run it as a build server for Xcode or something.

14:16.240 --> 14:20.320
You just need to get stuff signed and through there, and otherwise you can develop wherever

14:20.320 --> 14:21.320
you want.

14:21.320 --> 14:27.960
I guess what it really comes down to is, is the Macintosh hardware and the Mac OS operating

14:27.960 --> 14:32.480
system, is it important to you that you are in that ecosystem?

14:32.480 --> 14:35.840
And maybe, is it a statement?

14:35.840 --> 14:37.620
Is it a status symbol product?

14:37.620 --> 14:43.200
Or is the Mac OS and its applications simply a tool in which you use to get your job done?

14:43.200 --> 14:47.080
And maybe, depending on what answer you have for that, maybe that tells you what route

14:47.080 --> 14:48.080
to take.

14:48.080 --> 14:50.720
Now, can I run the ball forward about five years, though?

14:50.720 --> 14:51.840
Well, let's do it.

14:51.840 --> 14:57.080
This all makes sense, and this all works because Windows, Mac OS, and Linux are all effectively

14:57.080 --> 14:59.560
Windows, I'm sorry, Intel systems, right?

14:59.560 --> 15:00.960
They're x86, x64.

15:00.960 --> 15:03.760
Yeah, we're all running on the same chips.

15:03.760 --> 15:08.200
What happens when Uncle Tim throws down the gauntlet and says, and ARM?

15:08.200 --> 15:10.060
That's what I mean.

15:10.060 --> 15:11.200
That comes a lot harder, right?

15:11.200 --> 15:13.320
The virtualization, the overhead.

15:13.320 --> 15:19.000
I think everything changes, unless there's ARM hardware out there that can, yeah, I think

15:19.000 --> 15:20.000
everything changes.

15:20.000 --> 15:24.080
But at that point, too, you got to figure a lot of your application workflow would change,

15:24.080 --> 15:25.080
too.

15:25.080 --> 15:29.880
And you may actually want an x86 version of Mac OS around for compatibility reasons for

15:29.880 --> 15:30.920
a really long time.

15:30.920 --> 15:34.440
And again, virtualization would really be a good use case there.

15:34.440 --> 15:36.000
That would be a fascinating transition.

15:36.000 --> 15:37.560
Yeah, it will be.

15:37.560 --> 15:39.440
It's going to be painful, I think, for a lot of people.

15:39.440 --> 15:45.400
And maybe it's another reason not to invest in multi-thousand-dollar Mac products when

15:45.400 --> 15:47.080
they could be at the end of a line.

15:47.080 --> 15:48.880
You mean a $47,000 Mac Pro.

15:48.880 --> 15:50.200
Right, I mean, look at that, right?

15:50.200 --> 15:53.440
I mean, even if you could come up with another screen that is still high resolution that

15:53.440 --> 15:57.200
can connect to that thing, and there are not a lot of options there, you're still looking

15:57.200 --> 16:01.560
at probably a base $6,000 out the door for the machine once you get it configured, even

16:01.560 --> 16:02.700
adequately.

16:02.700 --> 16:07.520
Or you could put all of that money into a custom-built PC or a machine you buy that

16:07.520 --> 16:08.520
could get you a lot more.

16:08.520 --> 16:11.840
And then you virtualize, and that could get you stability in a way you hadn't really considered

16:11.840 --> 16:12.840
before.

16:12.840 --> 16:17.200
And the trend line for Mac OS has been to support virtualization more and more.

16:17.200 --> 16:22.020
It started like five years ago with licensing changes, and the support for it has just accelerated

16:22.020 --> 16:23.080
since then.

16:23.080 --> 16:28.000
Not to troll, but what if you could have a user land with like a high software compatibility

16:28.000 --> 16:32.080
and a desktop environment used by millions, and a kernel from a different OS that you

16:32.080 --> 16:35.800
can work natively in?

16:35.800 --> 16:39.520
You kind of trolled last week.

16:39.520 --> 16:44.400
I am curious, though, because you mentioned you were doing VS code and having that nice

16:44.400 --> 16:45.400
integration.

16:45.400 --> 16:46.400
I mean, how serious are you?

16:46.400 --> 16:47.680
Are you actually liking it that much?

16:47.680 --> 16:48.680
Is it working for your needs?

16:48.680 --> 16:51.400
Do you feel like you're effectively targeting Linux this way?

16:51.400 --> 16:53.040
I have deployed software.

16:53.040 --> 16:57.040
I have built binaries, a few of them that I've needed.

16:57.040 --> 17:02.440
Now, we're mostly talking about server-side software I'm developing, so it's been perfectly

17:02.440 --> 17:03.440
fine.

17:03.440 --> 17:09.520
But for me, and this is dumb, is that like the WSL stuff is very being worked on.

17:09.520 --> 17:11.360
I'm also using that new fancy terminal.

17:11.360 --> 17:14.040
Oh, I have not tried that yet.

17:14.040 --> 17:17.840
Which thanks to the listener Sean McBride gave me some pointers on how to set that up

17:17.840 --> 17:20.400
because the documentation is not great yet.

17:20.400 --> 17:29.040
I mean, as far as doing Ruby and doing some.NET Core, it's just fine.

17:29.040 --> 17:30.880
I am interested to see what happens.

17:30.880 --> 17:33.960
Like I have a cute project that I just need to pull down and take a look at something

17:33.960 --> 17:35.480
for somebody.

17:35.480 --> 17:37.760
What happens if I try to run that in WSL?

17:37.760 --> 17:40.080
I think the answer is it's just going to fail.

17:40.080 --> 17:44.600
I have to say, if you are a web developer who also needs to touch...

17:44.600 --> 17:48.080
You know, it's almost the old Microsoft argument, right?

17:48.080 --> 17:50.480
I'm sorry, the old MacBook argument.

17:50.480 --> 17:54.440
If you are a web developer who occasionally needs like Xcode for like signing a Cordova

17:54.440 --> 17:56.760
or a PhoneGap app, this is great, right?

17:56.760 --> 18:00.400
I do have Windows applications in the field, in the market.

18:00.400 --> 18:04.680
The vast majority of the software I write is being deployed, like I said, to SUSE and

18:04.680 --> 18:05.680
Ubuntu servers.

18:05.680 --> 18:06.680
So that's...

18:06.680 --> 18:07.680
Yeah, don't even get me started.

18:07.680 --> 18:08.680
I know.

18:08.680 --> 18:09.680
I know.

18:09.680 --> 18:14.240
We don't want to disparage.

18:14.240 --> 18:18.640
Legitimately though, real talk, what about the paper cuts of running Windows?

18:18.640 --> 18:22.400
You know, like the fact that the start menu has got all over it, the fact that the Windows

18:22.400 --> 18:27.840
updates process takes a decade, the fact that it's a mishmash of UI, all those things.

18:27.840 --> 18:28.840
Okay.

18:28.840 --> 18:32.040
So I'm waiting on writing the review of this with the experiences.

18:32.040 --> 18:33.640
I did intentionally...

18:33.640 --> 18:38.320
I am intentionally using hardware that is 100% Linux compatible, just in case I want

18:38.320 --> 18:39.320
to slap Pop!

18:39.320 --> 18:40.800
OS or elementary or something on this.

18:40.800 --> 18:41.800
Nice.

18:41.800 --> 18:42.800
Yeah, okay.

18:42.800 --> 18:47.720
It is amazing to me how unpleasant the Windows kind of just setting up your machine experience

18:47.720 --> 18:48.720
still is these days.

18:48.720 --> 18:49.720
Yeah.

18:49.720 --> 18:52.380
Like I had to delete Candy Crush.

18:52.380 --> 18:53.640
That's ridiculous to me.

18:53.640 --> 18:58.120
Yeah, or how fiddly you have to get with the power saving settings and the update settings.

18:58.120 --> 18:59.120
It's not hard.

18:59.120 --> 19:04.520
It's just it's lots of fiddly settings that you spend a lot of time overall changing.

19:04.520 --> 19:05.520
It's like using plasma.

19:05.520 --> 19:06.520
No, I can't.

19:06.520 --> 19:09.520
It's kind of fair in a way, actually.

19:09.520 --> 19:12.480
I mean, it's all going to be about trade-offs, right?

19:12.480 --> 19:16.720
Like I know plenty of people who I've tried to evangelize desktop Linux to who are Mac

19:16.720 --> 19:18.800
people and they're like, are you kidding me?

19:18.800 --> 19:19.800
Right?

19:19.800 --> 19:23.960
Like I would never do that, you know.

19:23.960 --> 19:28.480
I would say that if you're a comfortable desktop Linux user, are you probably going to switch

19:28.480 --> 19:30.040
to Windows 10?

19:30.040 --> 19:32.520
Not unless you already needed Windows, right?

19:32.520 --> 19:34.600
Am I a hundred percent on Windows 10?

19:34.600 --> 19:36.040
I am for now.

19:36.040 --> 19:38.000
Do I think it will last?

19:38.000 --> 19:41.440
Well, it used to be the case and this is Mike's old man hat.

19:41.440 --> 19:47.520
The last time I seriously, seriously ran Windows other than for like a four month job was I

19:47.520 --> 19:52.440
think it was Windows, God, I don't even know the word, eight, eight, Windows eight.

19:52.440 --> 19:56.560
It has been my experience that Windows machines tend to slow down after a while.

19:56.560 --> 19:57.560
Oh yeah.

19:57.560 --> 19:58.840
The Windows slow down creep.

19:58.840 --> 19:59.840
We all know that.

19:59.840 --> 20:00.840
Yeah.

20:00.840 --> 20:01.840
So if that starts to happen, I will probably get frustrated.

20:01.840 --> 20:05.120
You know how I get like, you know, pour a beer into it or something.

20:05.120 --> 20:07.060
But I want to be careful how I phrase this.

20:07.060 --> 20:11.640
I don't think the Linux community should view WSL as a threat.

20:11.640 --> 20:13.480
I really actually think it's an opportunity, right?

20:13.480 --> 20:15.200
It is a sign that Linux is one.

20:15.200 --> 20:20.060
Now maybe it's bad if you happen to be a Dome developer, right?

20:20.060 --> 20:22.760
Or the elementary OS team or pop OS team.

20:22.760 --> 20:23.760
Yeah.

20:23.760 --> 20:24.760
You know what, Mike, is you're talking about this.

20:24.760 --> 20:29.600
You know what I realized is this is, um, it is a sign of success, just like wine was a

20:29.600 --> 20:31.920
sign of success for Windows.

20:31.920 --> 20:32.920
People want it, right?

20:32.920 --> 20:36.600
That's why Microsoft's investing real time and energy and dev hours into it.

20:36.600 --> 20:37.600
Okay.

20:37.600 --> 20:38.600
Can I come at this from another angle then?

20:38.600 --> 20:44.640
So what deficiency is Windows 10 as a desktop addressing that you have found say in a day

20:44.640 --> 20:47.560
to day pop OS or modern Ubuntu install?

20:47.560 --> 20:51.240
Well, that's an unfair question, right, because I have four Windows applications currently

20:51.240 --> 20:52.240
in the field.

20:52.240 --> 20:53.240
So the deficiency is,

20:53.240 --> 20:57.120
I mean, aside from that, like I'm wondering, is it, is it app, is the, is application compatibility

20:57.120 --> 21:00.820
truly a differentiator for you at this point?

21:00.820 --> 21:04.520
Is there things that Windows 10 is doing better that make you think, gosh, even when I'm not

21:04.520 --> 21:08.800
managing Windows applications that I'm shipping, there's reasons to stay here.

21:08.800 --> 21:10.120
Actually that is a great question.

21:10.120 --> 21:14.400
It turns out that my software application compatibility, other than working on these

21:14.400 --> 21:21.360
native Windows apps, is better on Windows and Linux than it is on Mac.

21:21.360 --> 21:25.780
Because anything I wanted to use, whether it be entertainment or work, there is either

21:25.780 --> 21:31.640
a Linux equivalency, right, or indeed it's a Linux tool that I couldn't use on Windows

21:31.640 --> 21:35.820
before, or that I had to install via homebrew for Mac.

21:35.820 --> 21:41.880
Or if it's a game, it can run near natively with Lutris on Linux.

21:41.880 --> 21:46.520
On Mac, I actually have, like for instance, I am addicted to Magic the Gathering Arena.

21:46.520 --> 21:47.520
Great game.

21:47.520 --> 21:51.760
For those who don't know, it's, in fact, a former host here, Jason, used to play it all

21:51.760 --> 21:53.600
the time, right?

21:53.600 --> 21:57.940
That ran flawlessly on Pop OS.

21:57.940 --> 22:01.680
Doesn't run at all on Mac without some pretty deep wine hackery.

22:01.680 --> 22:02.680
Oh.

22:02.680 --> 22:05.620
Same thing with my MMO of choice, Star Trek Online.

22:05.620 --> 22:06.620
I play it.

22:06.620 --> 22:07.620
Oh, dude, yes.

22:07.620 --> 22:08.620
I play it on Linux.

22:08.620 --> 22:12.680
In fact, I don't play it at all under Windows, and you can't even get it to run on Mac OS.

22:12.680 --> 22:15.560
Even with that crossover and wine and all of those things, it's just not happening on

22:15.560 --> 22:16.560
Mac OS.

22:16.560 --> 22:20.480
So, I mean, for me, and I know this is kind of a sideways way to answer your question,

22:20.480 --> 22:25.740
this experience has shown me, when I eventually settle down again, I'm probably going to distro

22:25.740 --> 22:28.360
hop a little on Linux or stick with Windows 10.

22:28.360 --> 22:35.500
We're probably dual boot, but Mac, you know what, at this point in 2019, I really don't

22:35.500 --> 22:39.760
think it's, I don't think you should need to compromise with your operating system,

22:39.760 --> 22:45.320
which I know sounds like, you know, not nice, but Pop OS is really nice.

22:45.320 --> 22:46.320
Elementary is really nice.

22:46.320 --> 22:47.320
Right?

22:47.320 --> 22:48.320
Ubuntu is nice.

22:48.320 --> 22:49.400
Now, I follow you.

22:49.400 --> 22:54.680
This is the end result of Linux essentially becoming, in a way, a runtime.

22:54.680 --> 22:58.840
And then, like I just said earlier, divorcing the applications from the operating system

22:58.840 --> 23:03.920
or making it possible to run Windows applications on Linux and Linux application on Windows,

23:03.920 --> 23:09.000
all of a sudden, the desktop, assuming you're not subscribed to any particular philosophy,

23:09.000 --> 23:14.560
is a lot more fluid and it matters, in some ways, a lot less even.

23:14.560 --> 23:15.560
Right.

23:15.560 --> 23:20.680
I mean, like, Mac added all that, you know, Exive stuff just to partially to help facilitate

23:20.680 --> 23:22.520
running Docker containers in a VM there.

23:22.520 --> 23:25.600
I run Docker on Mac OS and it runs just fine.

23:25.600 --> 23:27.640
It's got a, there's a nice GUI for it and everything.

23:27.640 --> 23:28.640
It's the craziest thing.

23:28.640 --> 23:29.640
Where do you get that GUI on Linux?

23:29.640 --> 23:30.640
Yeah, right?

23:30.640 --> 23:31.640
It's crazy.

23:31.640 --> 23:33.760
It comes with Docker Compose right there.

23:33.760 --> 23:34.760
Yeah.

23:34.760 --> 23:35.760
Yeah.

23:35.760 --> 23:36.760
I know.

23:36.760 --> 23:39.280
So, I guess my point is that it's just becoming less and less relevant.

23:39.280 --> 23:40.280
Less and less.

23:40.280 --> 23:43.400
And then, when you containerize the applications up in flat packs or snaps, it's at a whole

23:43.400 --> 23:44.400
other level.

23:44.400 --> 23:45.400
Well, let me ask you.

23:45.400 --> 23:49.100
I know we're harping on this, but you guys are, I mean, would it be wrong for me to call

23:49.100 --> 23:50.760
you freedom terrorists?

23:50.760 --> 23:51.760
No.

23:51.760 --> 23:52.760
I would think, yes.

23:52.760 --> 23:57.240
Sort of like, I mean, more like, it's more like a love and peace kind of vibe going on.

23:57.240 --> 24:00.320
Less of like a Greenpeace, you know, bomb something going on.

24:00.320 --> 24:01.320
Okay.

24:01.320 --> 24:02.720
Can I state department spend that then?

24:02.720 --> 24:03.720
Yeah.

24:03.720 --> 24:04.720
Freedom fighters.

24:04.720 --> 24:05.720
Warriors.

24:05.720 --> 24:06.720
Sure.

24:06.720 --> 24:07.720
Revolutionaries.

24:07.720 --> 24:10.960
See, it's less aggressive though, but we're on the path to righteousness.

24:10.960 --> 24:13.880
We're freedom recommenders.

24:13.880 --> 24:14.880
Have you heard about freedom?

24:14.880 --> 24:18.520
Do you have a moment?

24:18.520 --> 24:19.520
Are you free?

24:19.520 --> 24:20.520
Wait.

24:20.520 --> 24:21.520
Are you freedom Jehovah's Witnesses?

24:21.520 --> 24:22.520
Is that what?

24:22.520 --> 24:27.260
I mean, don't you guys feel that you, like, honestly, JB should just be taking a victory

24:27.260 --> 24:28.800
lap here, right?

24:28.800 --> 24:29.800
You won.

24:29.800 --> 24:33.480
We may have bet on the right horse, I suppose.

24:33.480 --> 24:40.240
So, what JB originally sought out to be was really a podcast network about the desktop

24:40.240 --> 24:41.240
of Linux, which-

24:41.240 --> 24:43.200
Oh, well, never mind.

24:43.200 --> 24:44.200
Yeah.

24:44.200 --> 24:48.200
But, you know, things change and evolve, and the network is changing and evolving.

24:48.200 --> 24:53.800
We still cover that probably disproportionately to the actual market size, but it's what we're

24:53.800 --> 24:55.400
all into.

24:55.400 --> 24:59.800
And we are very lucky that more and more of the workloads have come to Linux.

24:59.800 --> 25:03.600
So, that has been very fortunate because people want to know what's going on with it now.

25:03.600 --> 25:04.600
Yeah.

25:04.600 --> 25:06.800
There's a certain spirit of it, I think, that's distilled in the desktop.

25:06.800 --> 25:10.660
I mean, in some ways it is separate, but many of the communities that make both software

25:10.660 --> 25:11.660
co-mingle.

25:11.660 --> 25:14.520
Well, I would say there's honor in fighting a losing battle.

25:14.520 --> 25:16.800
And speaking of losing battles, Wes, how's that Objective-C?

25:16.800 --> 25:20.560
Oh, Mike, I knew you were going to ask about this.

25:20.560 --> 25:22.320
I love these challenges so much.

25:22.320 --> 25:23.320
Oh, yeah.

25:23.320 --> 25:24.320
Okay.

25:24.320 --> 25:28.920
So, you set me on a very different path to the world of Objective-C. And, okay, so I'll

25:28.920 --> 25:33.440
be honest, I didn't go down the complicated route of setting up a Mac OS VM.

25:33.440 --> 25:41.000
Now, that might be something worth trying in the future, but you encouraged me to explore

25:41.000 --> 25:43.920
what other options existed.

25:43.920 --> 25:45.760
And it's been really interesting.

25:45.760 --> 25:49.880
I mean, you know I'm interested in programming languages and Objective-C kind of has some,

25:49.880 --> 25:51.680
I mean, it's been around for a long time.

25:51.680 --> 25:56.760
So, it's got some interesting origins, especially the connection to Smalltalk.

25:56.760 --> 26:03.680
But because I was using the GNU step environment, it kind of felt like a history lesson.

26:03.680 --> 26:07.440
It felt like I was studying a dead language in some ways.

26:07.440 --> 26:08.440
The GNU step?

26:08.440 --> 26:09.440
So, I looked into...

26:09.440 --> 26:13.760
If you want to get a modern GNU step live environment, I believe it was last updated

26:13.760 --> 26:14.760
in 2017.

26:14.760 --> 26:15.760
So, yeah.

26:15.760 --> 26:16.760
I looked into that.

26:16.760 --> 26:20.720
Yeah, but it's packaged up like the, you know, the compiler and the runtimes and stuff, packaged

26:20.720 --> 26:21.720
up in Debian, no problem.

26:21.720 --> 26:23.840
So, I was able to pull those down.

26:23.840 --> 26:24.840
Got a couple of things compiling.

26:24.840 --> 26:29.240
You know, I did Hello World, and as Mike asked, I was playing around with some of the message

26:29.240 --> 26:34.280
passing and stuff, which is, I mean, honestly, I can see why Mike loves Objective-C.

26:34.280 --> 26:38.760
Now, for me, it was kind of a low level, going back to a little lower level of software in

26:38.760 --> 26:39.760
a little bit.

26:39.760 --> 26:42.160
Well, it is, what, 30 years old, isn't it?

26:42.160 --> 26:43.160
Yeah.

26:43.160 --> 26:49.880
But comparing it to C++, as was kind of done at the time, it's remarkably simple.

26:49.880 --> 26:53.680
So, you know, even for needing to have a bunch of sort of inherent complexity, because it

26:53.680 --> 26:58.480
is lower level, you know, it is targeting sort of complicated environments and doing

26:58.480 --> 27:02.960
so in an older style, and running closer to the metal, it's still, I mean, it's still

27:02.960 --> 27:05.080
surprisingly civilized, I would say.

27:05.080 --> 27:06.160
And would you agree with me, Mike?

27:06.160 --> 27:07.920
Is that kind of what you feel about it?

27:07.920 --> 27:13.160
I'm sorry, I'm tearing up because it warms my heart that it's 2019, and I somehow got

27:13.160 --> 27:14.160
someone to do Objective-C.

27:14.160 --> 27:20.600
You know, I find it kind of ironic even that it became popular because of the iPhone, which

27:20.600 --> 27:21.600
is such a modern device.

27:21.600 --> 27:22.600
It's so weird.

27:22.600 --> 27:26.960
It's such a, it's that whole story, and the fact that Java on Android, it's such a...

27:26.960 --> 27:29.160
Those are not, it's not how I would have predicted it going.

27:29.160 --> 27:30.160
Right, you wouldn't think so.

27:30.160 --> 27:31.160
At all.

27:31.160 --> 27:34.680
So it's interesting because one, I actually, I didn't say anything to you while you were

27:34.680 --> 27:35.920
doing it.

27:35.920 --> 27:40.880
I did not expect you to go the GNU step route, because that's actually the harder path.

27:40.880 --> 27:43.520
You could have been helping me this whole time, Mr. Dominic.

27:43.520 --> 27:47.080
Well, no, it's, well, the option was also set up a Mac VM, which I don't know how hard

27:47.080 --> 27:48.080
or easy that would be, right?

27:48.080 --> 27:49.080
So...

27:49.080 --> 27:53.440
Honestly, I do kind of want to, I need one of those anyway, not need, but it would be

27:53.440 --> 27:54.440
fun to have.

27:54.440 --> 27:55.440
I've hackintoshed in the past.

27:55.440 --> 27:56.440
So that's in my book.

27:56.440 --> 27:57.440
Well, I get mine finalized.

27:57.440 --> 27:58.440
Oh, yeah.

27:58.440 --> 27:59.440
Yeah.

27:59.440 --> 28:03.620
I agree with everything you said, and I would even wonder if you could expound more on the,

28:03.620 --> 28:05.000
it felt like going back in time.

28:05.000 --> 28:12.160
Because I actually think Objective-C is a language that is unabashedly from the early

28:12.160 --> 28:13.160
90s.

28:13.160 --> 28:17.360
And I know it was older than that, but really, that's when, yes, you know, there were updates

28:17.360 --> 28:21.880
later on when the iPhone came out, but it's core, it's concepts, the way it thinks about

28:21.880 --> 28:22.880
programming, right?

28:22.880 --> 28:25.960
It's direct ancestor is Smalltalk, right?

28:25.960 --> 28:29.440
It's like Smalltalk and C++, kind of.

28:29.440 --> 28:36.360
But basically, it says that we are object-oriented, but we are a small language, right?

28:36.360 --> 28:38.680
I mean, how did you feel about just the size of the language?

28:38.680 --> 28:42.080
Yeah, it doesn't, you know, it's not super weighed down by a ton of stuff.

28:42.080 --> 28:46.360
And obviously, you know, you get more of that if you're targeting, you know, the Mac ecosystem

28:46.360 --> 28:48.680
and using a bunch of their libraries on top.

28:48.680 --> 28:53.440
But yeah, you know, C was, I think, the first programming language that, like, you could

28:53.440 --> 28:57.080
really count if we don't count Visual Basic Sex, which I don't think we should.

28:57.080 --> 28:58.080
What about Real Basic?

28:58.080 --> 29:01.280
Half counts, half counts.

29:01.280 --> 29:03.760
So it did, you know, it was kind of nice.

29:03.760 --> 29:07.760
All of my more recent, you know, low-level experiments have been playing around with

29:07.760 --> 29:14.640
Rust or I have done some C++ a few years ago, and I don't have a strong desire to go back.

29:14.640 --> 29:15.640
Interesting.

29:15.640 --> 29:19.560
I think I could handle Objective-C. I mean, these days, you know, it probably be, it would

29:19.560 --> 29:25.560
probably be Swift, but it was an interesting contrast because using the message-passing

29:25.560 --> 29:30.280
system it's, and you know, and some of the inheritance from Smalltalk, even for being

29:30.280 --> 29:34.200
a low-level compiled language, it's surprisingly dynamic.

29:34.200 --> 29:37.720
And I think you miss out on a lot of that, for better and for worse.

29:37.720 --> 29:42.120
I mean, there are lots of good things about the extra, you know, static-ness and safety

29:42.120 --> 29:48.360
of Swift, but it's an interesting throwback or, you know, it has such a unique place in

29:48.360 --> 29:52.920
the landscape of programming language design, and I think it's interesting how popular it

29:52.920 --> 29:55.120
got from kind of obscure origins.

29:55.120 --> 29:58.240
I have a couple of questions for you.

29:58.240 --> 30:03.240
So the second question I'll do first, how cool is it that you can go like back in time

30:03.240 --> 30:08.040
with some of this stuff and not, like GnuStep is fairly well-preserved, but not everything

30:08.040 --> 30:09.040
is.

30:09.040 --> 30:11.400
Like, we need to do better at preserving these things and having ways to stand these up.

30:11.400 --> 30:15.520
Well, yeah, I mean, I know like with Smalltalk there's similar things where you can get some

30:15.520 --> 30:19.760
of the images and get them to run, and there's even, I forget the name of it, but there's

30:19.760 --> 30:22.400
some like modern distributions of it.

30:22.400 --> 30:26.920
It is interesting though, because you have different eras of computing, and you can contrast

30:26.920 --> 30:30.880
that with, say, looking back at Android versions, which is like impossible, because so much

30:30.880 --> 30:34.640
of it is online that you just can't really preserve that environment, so it's nice when

30:34.640 --> 30:38.640
you have some of these older languages because they weren't, they just weren't connected

30:38.640 --> 30:39.640
systems, right?

30:39.640 --> 30:40.640
It's all standalone.

30:40.640 --> 30:46.360
As long as you have the source material, and because it was added as part of the GNU project,

30:46.360 --> 30:48.680
you know, that's free, so it's preserved.

30:48.680 --> 30:54.120
It would be so cool if there was like some archive.org style project that would create

30:54.120 --> 30:58.960
like maybe a Linux environment VM snapshot of something in time and then make it available,

30:58.960 --> 31:02.480
and you could just start up the entire environment from that time or something.

31:02.480 --> 31:06.040
Maybe like a little interactive thing you could go through and maybe explore what made

31:06.040 --> 31:08.560
that language unique or explore that environment.

31:08.560 --> 31:14.680
Okay, so my first question was, as somebody who's got no experience at this, object-oriented

31:14.680 --> 31:22.280
seems like it would get very complex after a while, like is that, can you, am I wrong?

31:22.280 --> 31:25.560
Seems like, it seems like for something simple, no problem, you can keep the whole thing in

31:25.560 --> 31:30.160
your head, but you start to get to something that's fairly, even somewhat complicated,

31:30.160 --> 31:33.680
it seems like it would just become a massive thing to keep track of that you wouldn't be

31:33.680 --> 31:35.120
able to keep it all in your head.

31:35.120 --> 31:36.120
That's why FP exists.

31:36.120 --> 31:37.120
What is FP?

31:37.120 --> 31:41.240
Yeah, it sounds like, it sounds like you should stay tuned for the next episode of Coderradio,

31:41.240 --> 31:45.320
Chris, because we're going to have a little conversation about functional programming

31:45.320 --> 31:50.160
and object-oriented programming and how they fit together and maybe how to combine the

31:50.160 --> 31:51.160
paradigms a bit.

31:51.160 --> 31:52.160
I like that.

31:52.160 --> 31:53.160
Hey guys, good idea.

31:53.160 --> 31:54.160
Well played.

31:54.160 --> 31:55.160
Well played.

31:55.160 --> 31:59.440
Interestingly, I think Objective-C is kind of neat because like, again, comparing it

31:59.440 --> 32:04.480
to C++, the message passing style is just, it just feels a little simpler.

32:04.480 --> 32:08.960
So I can see that aiding, and then there's just lots of, you know, you get design patterns

32:08.960 --> 32:13.920
and paradigms that one applies for certain abstractions to try to, you know, detangle

32:13.920 --> 32:14.920
some of that mess.

32:14.920 --> 32:19.720
So do you think for a junior developer, there would be any value in saying, you know what,

32:19.720 --> 32:24.560
just for like a weekend, stand up a good new step environment on your arch distro, because

32:24.560 --> 32:28.840
that's what you all seem to run and, you know, go back in time?

32:28.840 --> 32:30.920
I mean, I got Debian 10 on here.

32:30.920 --> 32:31.920
I'm on Debian.

32:31.920 --> 32:32.920
Oh, Debian.

32:32.920 --> 32:36.000
You know what, you're on the cutting edge, man, Debian.

32:36.000 --> 32:37.640
Debian 10 just came out this weekend.

32:37.640 --> 32:38.640
I know.

32:38.640 --> 32:39.640
See?

32:39.640 --> 32:40.640
Damn it, they got me again.

32:40.640 --> 32:41.640
That's amazing.

32:41.640 --> 32:42.640
Hey, I'm running Windows.

32:42.640 --> 32:43.640
Come on.

32:43.640 --> 32:48.760
You know, I would say if they're interested in doing iOS development, yeah, maybe.

32:48.760 --> 32:51.800
Like it could be interesting from that perspective as a way to get the toe in the water.

32:51.800 --> 32:56.800
If you're just interested from like the historical language stuff, maybe it's better to just

32:56.800 --> 32:58.560
play with Smalltalk directly.

32:58.560 --> 32:59.560
Interesting.

32:59.560 --> 33:00.560
Okay.

33:00.560 --> 33:02.280
But I mean, it's easy enough.

33:02.280 --> 33:05.000
No, I don't think I wouldn't dissuade someone from doing it.

33:05.000 --> 33:07.000
I certainly enjoyed it.

33:07.000 --> 33:08.000
And it might be worthwhile.

33:08.000 --> 33:11.760
I mean, I guess even with Swift, it's good to know a little objectivity, right?

33:11.760 --> 33:13.160
Just enough to read it, let's say.

33:13.160 --> 33:15.400
Oh, I think that's definitely the case.

33:15.400 --> 33:16.400
Yeah.

33:16.400 --> 33:17.900
That's not going away anytime soon.

33:17.900 --> 33:20.480
You're working on a project that's been around for a little bit.

33:20.480 --> 33:23.080
Arm six, arm transition.

33:23.080 --> 33:27.800
You know, I was also pretty impressed with, I mean, one, it was a stark reminder of the

33:27.800 --> 33:32.200
weird history Apple's had with the open source community and some of the license battles

33:32.200 --> 33:37.600
and the transition away from GPL software as they distribute it and LLVM and its rise

33:37.600 --> 33:38.600
to fame.

33:38.600 --> 33:41.280
Like all of that happens in the Objective-C history as well, right?

33:41.280 --> 33:43.000
It's part and parcel of that.

33:43.000 --> 33:44.000
Yep.

33:44.000 --> 33:45.040
It's tied to Apple's history.

33:45.040 --> 33:47.080
So it's fun to look at that way, too.

33:47.080 --> 33:50.880
It's the same reason you can't have a good version of Bash on Mac.

33:50.880 --> 33:57.400
All right, well, do we know what Mike's challenge is going to be?

33:57.400 --> 33:58.400
Oh, no.

33:58.400 --> 33:59.720
Oh, yes, we do.

33:59.720 --> 34:02.580
Now just a little public service announcement.

34:02.580 --> 34:05.580
Next week's episode, because of travel, will be prerecorded.

34:05.580 --> 34:08.760
So the challenge will be taking a week off.

34:08.760 --> 34:09.760
That's right.

34:09.760 --> 34:10.760
So there'll be a break there because-

34:10.760 --> 34:11.760
Yeah, Mike's going to get a little extra time.

34:11.760 --> 34:14.280
Yeah, we're about to record next week's episode in just a little bit.

34:14.280 --> 34:16.160
Oh, I won't be here, but they are.

34:16.160 --> 34:17.760
Yeah, it'll be.

34:17.760 --> 34:20.480
Actually I think it's going to fit in just fine.

34:20.480 --> 34:25.960
As you'll see, this is perhaps overdue, but Mike, you got me with Objective-C. So I'm

34:25.960 --> 34:30.720
going to give you something close to my own heart, Clojure is your choice this week.

34:30.720 --> 34:31.720
Fair enough.

34:31.720 --> 34:32.720
I did this to myself.

34:32.720 --> 34:33.720
Okay.

34:33.720 --> 34:34.720
Yeah.

34:34.720 --> 34:35.720
Yeah.

34:35.720 --> 34:38.920
So do you want me to give you some starting resources or should I leave you to fend in

34:38.920 --> 34:40.360
the fields of Google?

34:40.360 --> 34:41.360
You know what?

34:41.360 --> 34:44.800
Leave me in the woods because I want to see someone who doesn't know Clojure, where do

34:44.800 --> 34:45.800
they go?

34:45.800 --> 34:46.800
Okay.

34:46.800 --> 34:50.320
Yeah, actually I'm going to be interested to see what you find.

34:50.320 --> 34:52.680
You might come across to Westpain Talk if you look hard enough.

34:52.680 --> 34:54.960
Oh, now I'll be looking for it.

34:54.960 --> 34:59.120
I love it.

34:59.120 --> 35:05.120
You both held on to these particular choices much longer than I expected, kept your powder

35:05.120 --> 35:06.120
dry for a while.

35:06.120 --> 35:07.780
It's all about the slow play.

35:07.780 --> 35:08.780
This is the peak now.

35:08.780 --> 35:12.160
Now you're just going to be throwing random things at each other.

35:12.160 --> 35:15.080
Now we're going to go for the most annoying language as possible after this, I think.

35:15.080 --> 35:16.680
How about the old-scat language?

35:16.680 --> 35:20.200
Oh yeah, I mean brain could be included as well.

35:20.200 --> 35:21.200
That's a classic.

35:21.200 --> 35:22.200
Wonderful.

35:22.200 --> 35:25.040
Hey guys, I always appreciate letting me hang out for a bit.

35:25.040 --> 35:26.040
It's always nice.

35:26.040 --> 35:27.040
Oh, it's fun.

35:27.040 --> 35:28.040
Thank you for joining us.

35:28.040 --> 35:29.040
Oh no, you quit it.

35:29.040 --> 35:31.520
Did you know that we have a great website where people can get all kinds of resources?

35:31.520 --> 35:32.520
I think it's coder.show.

35:32.520 --> 35:38.400
Coder.show, you can find our RSS feed, you can find ways to contact us, and you can find

35:38.400 --> 35:43.360
the whole back catalog of Coder Radio episodes, and I mean, there's a whole bunch of them,

35:43.360 --> 35:44.360
so go start listening.

35:44.360 --> 35:47.040
You know, we should take a moment too, Mike, if you've got things going on, anything you

35:47.040 --> 35:51.400
want to mention or send the listeners, take a moment because we've got a space right here

35:51.400 --> 35:53.000
just for you to let them know about it.

35:53.000 --> 35:54.000
Oh, beautiful.

35:54.000 --> 35:57.080
Check out at Team Unico on Twitter and check out themadbotter.com.

35:57.080 --> 36:02.080
We're going to have some cool stuff in about, well I guess since we're doing a time delay,

36:02.080 --> 36:03.080
four weeks.

36:03.080 --> 36:04.080
Oh.

36:04.080 --> 36:07.880
It's better just to follow and see what happens over there.

36:07.880 --> 36:09.000
Then you know, yeah.

36:09.000 --> 36:12.400
But you can always bookmark it, just check back in a couple of weeks.

36:12.400 --> 36:13.400
Easily done.

36:13.400 --> 36:17.440
I'll plug, see what do I want, I'll plug at Chris Elias, and also, I'm going to plug

36:17.440 --> 36:19.000
user air.

36:19.000 --> 36:20.280
Such a good show.

36:20.280 --> 36:22.600
That is like, such a good show.

36:22.600 --> 36:26.440
Go check out the most recent episode, and then if you like it, go check out the back

36:26.440 --> 36:27.440
catalog.

36:27.440 --> 36:29.080
But oh man, such a good show.

36:29.080 --> 36:30.920
So we don't give it enough attention.

36:30.920 --> 36:31.920
It's great, yeah.

36:31.920 --> 36:34.920
And it's a fun diversion, it's a little different than a lot of the other shows on the network,

36:34.920 --> 36:38.280
so if you're tired of hearing about tech news, go get some real life news.

36:38.280 --> 36:39.280
Error.show.

36:39.280 --> 36:41.760
I'm on Twitter too, I'm at WestPain.

36:41.760 --> 36:42.760
What?

36:42.760 --> 36:43.760
Really?

36:43.760 --> 36:46.000
I'm going to go plug your show, Linux Action News.

36:46.000 --> 36:51.200
I really enjoyed this week's episode, especially your well-reasoned breakdown of this whole

36:51.200 --> 36:53.200
DNS over HTTPS debacle.

36:53.200 --> 36:55.200
Oh, Mozilla's an evil Mozilla.

36:55.200 --> 36:58.520
Some told me we're going to talk more about this topic.

36:58.520 --> 36:59.520
Yeah, yeah.

36:59.520 --> 37:04.600
Yeah, Internet the Mozilla villain is really all kind of just way out there, and so it

37:04.600 --> 37:08.720
really all comes down to something that you wouldn't expect, and I think people are like

37:08.720 --> 37:11.680
now realizing there's something kind of big coming down the pipe too.

37:11.680 --> 37:13.400
Yeah, that was a fascinating episode.

37:13.400 --> 37:14.400
Thank you, LinuxActionNews.com.

37:14.400 --> 37:19.680
Hey, you can find all the other shows over at jupiterpodcasting.com.

37:19.680 --> 37:49.480
Thank you all for joining us, and we'll see you next week.
