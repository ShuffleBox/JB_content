00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,720
This is KOTORadio, episode 426 for August 9th, 2021.

2
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:20,600
Hello friends and welcome into Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show, taking a pragmatic look

3
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:24,460
at the art and the business of software development and the world of technology.

4
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:26,320
This episode is brought to you by Cloud Guru.

5
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:31,520
You know, Cloud Guru has got that cloud playground, Azure, AWS, and Google Cloud Sandboxes on

6
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:33,000
ACG's credit card.

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Not yours.

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,240
Get certified, get hired, get learning at a CloudGuru.com.

9
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:43,280
My name is Chris and joining us, ready to podcast like the pro he is, with tea in hand,

10
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,320
it's our host, Mr. Dominic.

11
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:46,320
Hello Mike.

12
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,440
Happy tea time, Chris, although it's way too early.

13
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:49,440
Happy tea time.

14
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:50,440
It's kind of.

15
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:52,800
It's our unofficial KOTOR tea time, one o'clock.

16
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:53,920
Oh, what a mess, dude.

17
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:58,400
It's such a mess because we just got the new, the new show time and then I hit the road.

18
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:01,800
So now it's a, it's a totally different time for me because I'm in mountain time.

19
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,260
It's a totally different time for you.

20
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:04,840
You're in Eastern time.

21
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:08,260
The whole thing I thought was going to come crashing down because I thought we turned

22
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:12,520
into a bus of super spreaders about five days ago, four days ago.

23
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:15,560
I thought the whole crew was going to come down with the Rona.

24
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:17,400
Oh crap.

25
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:22,900
So we're getting, we're getting into Idaho and my son comes down with a fever and it's

26
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:24,280
not looking good.

27
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:27,860
He's down for the count and we're thinking, what else could this be?

28
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:31,600
And if he's got it, then maybe other other people in on board have it.

29
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:35,020
Like we're going to have to cancel the meetup and we start strategizing.

30
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:39,320
We get to, we get to Idaho and we start thinking, well, maybe we turn around and or maybe we

31
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:43,840
wait here and we isolate and see if we're sick and cancel the first meetup in Salt Lake

32
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:44,840
city.

33
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:47,580
You know, we're trying to strategize the entire thing because like now we've got Corona on

34
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:49,060
board, right?

35
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:52,400
And a couple of days go by and uh, we haven't seen anybody.

36
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,600
We're not sure like what to do.

37
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:56,880
So we just kind of had, oh, there was a windstorm too, so we had to stay put anyways.

38
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:02,040
So that worked out and we wake up the next morning and my son's feeling different.

39
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:06,240
Like if the fever has broken, he's, he's not really feeling so exhausted anymore, but he's

40
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,920
got this big lump on his face.

41
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:11,960
I'm looking at this lump and I'm going, wait a minute here.

42
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:15,520
And we start replaying like history, you know, you start going back through your brain archive

43
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:22,160
and I realized like four or five days ago, whenever we left, he chipped his tooth on a,

44
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:26,760
on a sucker on a hard candy and I bet he cracked it and got an infection.

45
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:30,960
So we took him into urgent care and sure enough, it was an infected tooth that had caused the

46
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:34,680
fever and him not feeling well and we got him on some antibiotics and he's just doing

47
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:39,440
great now, but it wasn't, it wasn't the Rona at all, but I had a total COVID panic because

48
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:42,400
I thought, what if, you know, what if we go to the meetup and we've got COVID or something

49
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:46,960
because we're trying to be careful, obviously we're all taking extra precautions and we

50
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:50,520
thought, you know, something had gotten us either anyways, but it turned out just to

51
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:53,720
be a cracked tooth and he's on the mend.

52
00:02:53,720 --> 00:03:00,400
That's been my week, not to mention driving and working.

53
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,720
And you remain in Florida.

54
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:04,920
So I remain in the sunshine state.

55
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:09,000
Well, Mr. Dominic, with all that aside, what do you say, should we get in some feedback?

56
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,600
Let's hear what the screaming gnome users have to say.

57
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,240
Oh, too soon.

58
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:18,020
Actually, I think we, I think we made it clear this week, David writes in and he really just,

59
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:22,440
he has the key to using Linux, he says is boring old hardware.

60
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:26,280
He says, Linux hardware is a lot better years after it's come out.

61
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:30,760
It seems a vendor sell Linux with some initial options, but in my experience, the support

62
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:32,040
doesn't tend to be that great.

63
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,720
It isn't refined yet.

64
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:37,880
It seems much better to install something like an LTS Ubuntu or some other reliable

65
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:41,960
distro on hardware that's frankly had some time to simmer.

66
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:46,080
I haven't purchased Linux as an option from a vendor since I prefer to install Linux on

67
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,080
my own.

68
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:50,240
More recently, I purchased a brand new T-series ThinkPad.

69
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:54,680
At release, Kubuntu's install was broken and Mate just wasn't stable.

70
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:58,880
I switched things up and let things sit for a while and after revisiting it a little while

71
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:02,480
later, I was pleasantly surprised how refined it was.

72
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:06,920
The deciding factor of Linux desktop quality seems to be the open source projects familiarity

73
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:08,320
with the hardware.

74
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:12,760
The oldest popular machines always enjoy the best support, while the latest models typically

75
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:17,520
have bugs, bad defaults, and or drivers that just don't work well.

76
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:21,840
I know Mike doesn't like to touch his workstations and just wants to order a product from the

77
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:27,080
manufacturer, but with the way support actually happens on Linux, it seems like he'd be better

78
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:33,240
served reinstalling his own OS from the downloaded ISO after the hardware has gotten a bit older.

79
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:38,640
This has always been the mainstream way desktop Linux is deployed and it's a first class citizen

80
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:39,640
there.

81
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:43,240
And while regulations from the vendor is new and not nearly as popular, at least today

82
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:48,600
it seems you get a second class experience when it comes to Linux hardware support.

83
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:52,480
But the older devices work great, love the show, keep it up, David.

84
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:57,200
So he's saying stop buying new hardware and buy a used machine and put Linux on it.

85
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:00,200
But I love new hardware.

86
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,200
I know I thought that too.

87
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:03,880
It's like, well, that sounds kind of boring, right?

88
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:04,880
Yeah.

89
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:10,360
Plus, like, I mean, you got a job to do, you want something fast and powerful, right?

90
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,360
Yes.

91
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,360
And with no fan.

92
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:18,360
That hurts right now because my laptop is working hard and you know it.

93
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,480
You know it.

94
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:24,440
Hey, so I went to the Salt Lake City meetup and it went great.

95
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:25,440
And guess what?

96
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,800
A lot of Koda Radio love there.

97
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,720
Several people mentioned it was their favorite podcast.

98
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:36,760
There was some serious Salt Lake City love and so everybody says hi and they missed you.

99
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:41,680
And I think there were more iPhones and Mac users there than Linux and Android devices.

100
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:45,360
Yeah, I think JB is really a Mac network now, just saying.

101
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,240
But that meetup, there was a lot there.

102
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,440
It was a good mix, though.

103
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:53,180
We had some engineers, we had some security analysts, but it was pretty cool.

104
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:58,060
It was a great chance to just reconnect with folks and hear what they like about the shows,

105
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:00,360
how they found the shows, all that kind of stuff.

106
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:03,200
And Koda Radio was well-repped.

107
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:06,720
The next meetup is going to be in Denver on August 20th.

108
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,440
That's all linked up at meetup.com slash Jupiter Broadcasting.

109
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:12,440
It's going to be a big event there.

110
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:15,520
So go check out the meetup page and see if you can make it.

111
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:18,060
It's going to be like a big deal.

112
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:19,060
It's going to be fun.

113
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:22,080
We're going to have giveaways, Raspberry Pi's, swag.

114
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,080
It's going to be huge.

115
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:27,560
Linode's going to have people there that are like spoiling everybody.

116
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:32,200
So meetup.com slash Jupiter Broadcasting.

117
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,820
Linode.com slash Koder.

118
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:37,240
Go there to get $100 and 60 day credit on a new account.

119
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,640
And of course, you support the show.

120
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:44,020
I host all of my servers on Linode and I think you'd like them to Linode is independently

121
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:49,560
owned and they've been redefining how great cloud computing can be for 18 years.

122
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,940
You'll learn a few things in that time.

123
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:57,280
This road trip I'm on right now to reunite with the audience and with the JB team.

124
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:03,560
It's being powered by Linode in every sense of the word and my business runs on Linode.

125
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:06,700
That's how much I trust them and that's why I can recommend them.

126
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:11,740
They have 11 data centers around the world, award winning customer support and a dashboard

127
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:16,720
to manage everything that sets the bar in the industry.

128
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:19,800
But let's be real, I also love them because they're fast.

129
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,200
I mean, that matters.

130
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:25,760
Performance is a big factor in my choice here and their servers, their network connections,

131
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:30,880
even just deploying a server, creating a snapshot, upgrading the memory in one of my boxes.

132
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:36,200
It all happens really fast and with clear status and feedback as to what is happening

133
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:40,840
while you're doing the action so you know exactly what's going on.

134
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:46,480
Recently we deployed our live tracker so you can see the progress of our road trip at colonytracker.live.

135
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:49,380
And yeah, all of that runs on top of Linode.

136
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:52,600
It was straightforward to set it up and start using and they loved it.

137
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,820
In fact, Linode got so on board.

138
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:57,320
They helped make some artwork for the page and all of it.

139
00:07:57,320 --> 00:08:00,720
So go check out colonytracker.live if you haven't seen that yet.

140
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:05,800
That website is running on Linode and then that embedded map is running on own tracks,

141
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:09,800
which we have running on a Linode all on open source software.

142
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,520
How great is that?

143
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:14,420
Anytime we're deploying something for ourselves and production behind the scenes that the

144
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:18,820
audience never sees or stuff that is going to be facing to the audience, we always deploy

145
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:19,820
that on Linode.

146
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:24,080
Now we have for over two years now and it's really the best choice out there when you

147
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:29,120
combine the support, the performance, the dashboard, the data center locations, the

148
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:32,560
fact that they're independently owned and not getting jerked around by different VC

149
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:33,560
funding.

150
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:37,080
It's really nice to know my business is with somebody who's been around for 18 years and

151
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,760
knows what they're doing.

152
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:42,240
I could go on and on about Linode and why I think it's so fantastic and why I think

153
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,320
it's so great.

154
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:46,080
But the thing that they've done to make it easier for our audience to try it out for

155
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:50,400
yourselves and just get some experience is they've created that $100 credit.

156
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:53,080
So you can go to linode.com slash coder.

157
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:58,480
You get $100 in credit on a new account for 60 days and you can go experiment with stuff.

158
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:03,040
Go see why we use them, why we choose them over and over again for yourselves.

159
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:08,200
Plus it's an opportunity to learn something, an opportunity to test something and an opportunity

160
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:11,780
to support independent content like the Coder radio program.

161
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:12,780
How great is that?

162
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:15,440
It's a check in the box all the way down kind of thing.

163
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:21,240
So go to linode.com slash coder, get $100 support the show and kick the tires.

164
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:26,140
It's linode.com slash coder.

165
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:31,320
The internet is freaking out this week because Apple has announced it plans to scan images

166
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:35,320
in children's iMessage and in iCloud.

167
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:40,240
Kind of two separate functions, but they were announced at the same time.

168
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:45,600
And everybody says this is an era of censorship and monitoring that Apple is just rolling

169
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,600
out.

170
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:51,680
So it seems the slippery slope argument here is once you build a technology that can identify

171
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:55,960
types of images, it doesn't take long until governments come knocking on your door like

172
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:59,560
China or Russia and say, add these hashes to your mix.

173
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:04,240
Well, we were briefly talking about this in our Slack and what was my first reaction?

174
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:07,160
Wait till Beijing gets their little paws on this one, right?

175
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:12,560
Like this is, remember the old DRM arguments from the nineties, Chris, let's take the time

176
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:13,560
machine.

177
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:14,560
Sure.

178
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:15,560
It seems so reasonable, right?

179
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:21,840
Like these small indie developers were making their little games, their shareware, whatever,

180
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:24,520
productivity software, whatever, whatever have you.

181
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:26,760
And it just seems like a little bit of protection, right?

182
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:27,760
So like, let's get some keys.

183
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,720
Oh, but you know, you own the disc, man.

184
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:30,720
You got the disc, you got the game.

185
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:31,720
That's it.

186
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:33,680
You just need the product key.

187
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:34,680
And it activates once.

188
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:37,840
Well now we have, most things are basically always online.

189
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:44,240
In fact, I just got an Xbox series S, the little one, the digital only one.

190
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:47,200
And this slapped me in the face, literally the night I got it.

191
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:52,720
My router happened to decide to poop the bed and all the games I had spent all day downloading,

192
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:56,640
I wanted to try Assassin's Creed, whatever the current one is.

193
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:01,480
And sure enough, after like 30, 40 minutes, whatever it was with no internet connection,

194
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:03,880
bam, no, you're done.

195
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:06,360
My point being, you know, the intentions were good, right?

196
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:09,180
Right in the beginning, we'll have these product keys, you know, help developers.

197
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:11,560
The intentions are obviously good with this, right?

198
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:13,240
Child abuse is bad.

199
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:15,020
Should not be a thing.

200
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:19,440
Anything that can be done to stop it is good, but you have to understand that once you enable

201
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:25,760
this kind of surveillance functionality, have you ever heard of, I don't know, Prism, right?

202
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:28,560
Any of these Snowden S things where it was like, oh, we're just gonna stop terrorists

203
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:31,560
and now we're sort of listening in on everybody's phone calls.

204
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:37,000
Yeah, the way this is gonna work is there's an organization called CSAM that is essentially

205
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:41,280
set up to prevent child exploitation and they are generating a series of fingerprints and

206
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:45,640
hashes that Apple will subscribe to and then try to match and ID those.

207
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:48,680
And there's two different systems in place and one I don't really have actually much

208
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:52,920
problem with, and I think it's been completely misrepresented online, and that's the iMessage

209
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,360
functionality.

210
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:56,840
This has kind of been blown way out of proportion.

211
00:11:56,840 --> 00:12:02,500
The iMessage scanning only happens on iCloud accounts and iPhone accounts that are part

212
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:05,880
of a family plan and 12 years of age.

213
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:09,160
Above 12 years of age and still part of a family plan, there is some functionality,

214
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:10,160
but it's different.

215
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:15,440
12 years of age and below, it's looking for those fingerprints in the iMessage pictures,

216
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:20,160
it could be SMS or iMessage, and then it sends a push notification to the parent.

217
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,760
It doesn't notify Apple when something is found.

218
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:27,200
And that actually seems like kind of a reasonable implementation because my kids have got iOS

219
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:30,800
devices, and I absolutely don't want them doing anything like that, and as long as I'm

220
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:34,400
notified and it doesn't report it to anybody, I think that's actually a pretty reasonable

221
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,400
system.

222
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,400
It's also opt-in.

223
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:39,200
It's not on by default.

224
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:45,840
If you're above 12 years old and you're part of a family plan, I don't know if maybe it's

225
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:49,160
like it drops the notification to the parents, but it still blocks the image or something.

226
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:51,400
I can't remember because I didn't look into that part of it.

227
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:56,380
Then there's the iCloud part where it's scanning it, and if you opt into iCloud photo library,

228
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:59,520
they're going to be looking for these fingerprints throughout your iCloud photo library.

229
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:04,520
If they find something that matches a fingerprint, it notifies a person, like somebody in the

230
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:09,960
department at Apple who then has to review a low-resolution image to verify if it's child

231
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:13,560
porn or not and then alert the authorities after that.

232
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:17,120
And I guess there's even like a threshold because there could be some possible false

233
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:21,560
IDs, so it's like if you get triggered a few times, like nothing happens.

234
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:27,560
It takes several triggerings of this algorithm before it actually alerts somebody.

235
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:32,360
And I think if you look at what Apple has planned here, it's totally fine, really.

236
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:34,000
That implementation is pretty reasonable.

237
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
It is 100% the slippery slope argument.

238
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:44,400
And I think the more... I can kind of believe Apple if they say that we are going to refuse

239
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:47,600
government demands to expand the photo scanning beyond the CSAM.

240
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:51,280
We will refuse that, they've said that a couple of times.

241
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:54,960
I could believe that if one of these two scenarios is true.

242
00:13:54,960 --> 00:14:00,440
If this is Apple's Hail Mary move to prevent having to build in back doors to all of their

243
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:05,360
software for law enforcement, if they can say, look, your argument that you need encryption

244
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:10,400
back doors into everything we do to save the children is null and void now because we've

245
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:12,040
built this technology.

246
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:15,660
And we're going to scan these images just like Facebook does in Facebook Messenger.

247
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:17,400
And we're going to participate in that same program.

248
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:19,420
So now you don't need a back door key.

249
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:23,760
If that's why they're doing this, I can kind of believe them that they won't have scope

250
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,600
creep.

251
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:30,920
But perhaps another alternative reason they could be doing this is because some sort of

252
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:35,160
optimistic woke culture has told them they can save the children in the world by doing

253
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:39,880
this and it is with full unbridled optimism and cooperation with CSAM that they're going

254
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,440
to save the children.

255
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:46,160
And if they actually think that's the reason they're doing this, if there isn't some devious

256
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:49,400
other motivation that they're not talking about being like, we want to prevent the FBI

257
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:50,520
from getting back doors.

258
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:54,340
If it's instead this unbridled optimism that they're presenting publicly, then it's totally

259
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:55,520
going to get fucked with.

260
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:56,520
No doubt about it.

261
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:57,720
It's totally going to get screwed with.

262
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:02,440
If it's the first one and they're trying to do a ninja move to prevent back doors, I'm

263
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,440
on board.

264
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,440
But we will never know.

265
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:05,440
We'll never know.

266
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,880
And so you just wish it never had come up.

267
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:11,480
You just wish they'd never opened this Pandora's box and they're not going to be able to put

268
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:12,480
this away.

269
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:15,980
I guess I don't understand how you think that little judo move would work because every

270
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:21,960
time, you know, let's say since, I don't know, the early aughts, right, we've had an encroachment

271
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:27,640
on privacy by any government, it's always been, okay, we're going to do this, but nothing

272
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:28,640
more.

273
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:29,640
Right?

274
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:30,640
Remember kids, it's just metadata.

275
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:32,160
Well, it turns out not so much.

276
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,160
All right.

277
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:34,160
I'm just.

278
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,160
I agree.

279
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:36,480
I think that's most likely what's going to happen.

280
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:41,120
I think if you look at the history of Apple and their battle over the San Bernardino iPhone,

281
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:46,520
the little pivot they had to do back in 2008 around encrypting backups because the FBI asked

282
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:50,760
them not to have a link about that in the show notes, they've been very strategic in

283
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:53,500
how they're dealing with law enforcement and the access they get.

284
00:15:53,500 --> 00:16:00,040
And that encroachment on privacy is often done at the rally call of save the children.

285
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:05,880
And the director of the FBI, the last couple of directors of the FBI have been tested,

286
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:10,180
have been testifying saying, we have to get access to encrypted chat to save the children.

287
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:15,400
We have to save the children or else pornography will spread through encrypted chat.

288
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:20,580
And if that is the lever that they are trying to use to open Apple's back door, this could

289
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:24,240
be their cover up for their ass and well, you don't need that now because we've we've

290
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:29,080
solved that problem for you using technology and algorithms.

291
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,600
So don't worry about it.

292
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,480
The algorithm is on it now.

293
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:37,680
And they'll tell the FBI to, you know, sod off now because they've got this built in

294
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:41,520
and that they're now they're their reason for needing backdoor encryption is null and

295
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:42,520
void.

296
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:43,520
Oh, I wouldn't.

297
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:49,040
The FBI in this case or whatever law enforcement entity just say, OK, let me wait a year until

298
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:51,920
there's some weird exception that Apple screwed up on.

299
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:57,320
And then I'm going to go, you know, on Fox News, CNN, MSNBC and be, you know, banging

300
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,320
the drum again.

301
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:01,900
I mean, I know that's and also they're going to yell terrorism.

302
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:03,880
They have to stop, you know, to stop the terrorism.

303
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:09,560
It's interesting that Apple has kept this very focused on law enforcement when the more

304
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:13,760
interesting question is like intelligence services, which I understand some countries,

305
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:19,080
well, probably this one, too, is a little bit of a thin line, right?

306
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:24,640
Because they're saying what someone who intends to take you and put you on trial can do.

307
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,960
What about someone who has no intention of ever putting you on trial?

308
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:27,960
Right.

309
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:31,160
It's just like literally, I don't know, spying on every phone call.

310
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:32,960
That could never happen, though, Mike.

311
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,720
We've never seen examples of that.

312
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:35,720
Come on, Mike.

313
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:36,720
You've read too many Tom Clancy novels.

314
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:37,720
What do you do?

315
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:41,840
Oh, no, I think you're right.

316
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:50,120
And I think Apple, I think Apple loses their privacy crown with this, because the way average

317
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:55,240
people will see this is, well, for Apple to do this, they have to be looking at my photos.

318
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:57,600
They're not going to understand the difference of like hashing things.

319
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:00,880
And they're losing that argument now.

320
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:05,680
Apple's privacy argument is now it's private, except for we're looking at it.

321
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:07,880
So you have your your judo theory.

322
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:10,880
I have my China's the biggest market in the world.

323
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:15,360
It's going to be the big smart in the world for certainly our lifetime.

324
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:19,360
Apple needs to probably appease Beijing.

325
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:23,640
I don't know if anybody listening follows the news, but Hong Kong protests, they just

326
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:30,520
got slapped down pretty, pretty hard using things like digital surveillance and just

327
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:32,440
a ton of tear gas.

328
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:38,000
So I can't see this not having wider implications other than CSAM, right?

329
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,120
I understand like that's the main thing, and that's the thing they're talking about.

330
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:46,160
But you know, if you can, if you can do images of child abuse, which again, no one should

331
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,160
condone that, right?

332
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:50,600
Like, go after those guys as hard as you can.

333
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:56,000
But, you know, you can go to jail for like, posting a Winnie the Pooh meme in China, because

334
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,240
like somebody said, the president of China looks like Winnie the Pooh.

335
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:01,920
Why wouldn't Winnie the Pooh be part of this in China?

336
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:04,960
Well, there goes Koder in China, they were screwed.

337
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,680
Now we're done in that market.

338
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:08,640
Yeah, I agree with you, man.

339
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:11,360
I think that's exactly what will happen.

340
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:18,040
The only kind of real world use case we have here is Apple does not make FaceTime available

341
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:23,240
in Saudi Arabia, because Saudi Arabia demands that all audio and video calls be unencrypted.

342
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:27,600
And so Apple just opted to make Fight FaceTime unavailable in Saudi Arabia, Saudi Arabia,

343
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:28,600
though.

344
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:31,000
I mean, it like, it's not China.

345
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Yeah, right.

346
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,440
It's not the biggest market in the world.

347
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:35,440
Yeah.

348
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,440
Right.

349
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:41,600
And that really is and and you you see Apple and their drive for that stock price and that

350
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,560
drive for revenue.

351
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:48,320
There's just no way Tim Cook can say no to the Chinese market and keep his job.

352
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,040
Uncle Tim is chasing that dragon hard.

353
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:54,380
Yeah, I wonder I really it's really hard to know the motivation here.

354
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:58,820
And this is going to be one of those problems where if this begins to slide, because here's

355
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:03,920
the other thing is we're assuming that CSAM organization is untouchable, and that they

356
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:08,960
couldn't be corrupted and that images couldn't be or hashes couldn't be injected from that

357
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:09,960
side.

358
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:10,960
Right?

359
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:14,480
It's not only are we being asked to have faith that Apple won't have scope creep with this

360
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:20,720
feature set, but we're being asked to have faith in this CSAM organization who is organizing

361
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,340
all of this.

362
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:28,080
And then there's also the man, how do they say it's like the neck Mac, that's NC MEC

363
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:32,200
database, which is where a lot of this actually lives, these fingerprints actually live.

364
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:36,860
So there's actually two other organizations outside of Apple that are involved with all

365
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:38,040
of this.

366
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:43,760
And then we have to trust that the governments that Apple operates in won't be constantly

367
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:44,760
putting pressure on them.

368
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:51,680
So you have CSAM, which stands for child sexual abuse material, which is, you know, awful,

369
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:52,680
no doubt about it.

370
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:58,960
And then you have Nick Mac, NC MEC, the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children.

371
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:01,240
It's both of those organizations.

372
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:05,240
They are both founded and funded by the US government.

373
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:09,680
So it is possible that organizations that are founded and funded by the US government

374
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:14,800
could then be influenced by the White House and you could get a president, maybe it's

375
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:19,020
another president in a few years that gets in there, that puts pressure, political pressure

376
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:24,400
on this group to add new types of imagery that society now considers to be offensive

377
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,660
and dangerous.

378
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:28,520
And that goalpost is constantly shifting.

379
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:35,720
And so you could see just over time how something like this, even if Apple never, ever wavered

380
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:41,040
on their commitments, you could see how maybe the other groups might over time because things

381
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:42,040
change.

382
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:45,080
So this is my whole bottom line on all this security stuff.

383
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:49,080
Like you're saying, you could have a different guy in charge or gal in charge later.

384
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:52,200
It's not enough for these companies to say that they won't.

385
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:55,640
They have to be saying, and it has to be in fact true, that they can't.

386
00:21:55,640 --> 00:22:00,420
Not that I won't do it because you can trust me, it's I cannot do it even if I wanted to.

387
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:06,720
Even if I woke up and had just like the burning desire out of the best of intentions, I literally

388
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:07,720
can't do it.

389
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:11,060
That's the only way you have any kind of digital privacy.

390
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:14,720
And there are serious downsides to that.

391
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:19,360
That's why there are legitimate cases where it would be a lot easier for law enforcement

392
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:23,880
and other entities to just have nothing be encrypted.

393
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:27,680
It will cost lives if everything's end to end encrypted.

394
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:30,320
But this is going to be problematic too.

395
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:36,200
And where I think this is going to go in five years is going to be weirdly some sort of

396
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:41,440
pseudo corporate slash government marriage surveillance state.

397
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,680
This is the tinfoil hat edition of Coder Radio.

398
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:49,640
You know, there's other cloud providers that are already doing this exact scanning right

399
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:50,640
now.

400
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:53,520
I mentioned Facebook and there are others.

401
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:57,520
That's why it kind of sucks that this has been not properly explained.

402
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:02,400
Like I think out of all of this, the most reasonable thing that Apple is doing is that

403
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:07,960
iMessage filtering that happens on device for children's accounts that just notifies

404
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:08,960
parents.

405
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,040
That's sensible.

406
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:15,480
I think a lot of people could get on board with that and it's pretty minimal impact.

407
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:18,800
It's the cloud based scanning that really sucks.

408
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:24,560
The people are conflating this and saying that it's anyone who uses iMessage, they're

409
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:27,440
saying it's on by default, that it's going to be checking everybody.

410
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:33,780
Like the coverage of this has really been unusually inaccurate and unusually bad.

411
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:37,480
And that sucks because this is such a nuanced issue here.

412
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:42,120
And there's really two or three things Apple is announcing at once that's all getting conflated

413
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:43,120
together.

414
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:47,020
And generally they're a lot better at messaging this kind of stuff.

415
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:48,220
They really kind of blew it.

416
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:51,520
And you wonder if they're going to have to go up on stage and try to spin this in the

417
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:55,080
most Apple way possible when they announce the next hardware or whatever.

418
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:56,840
You mean like with the Sarah McLachlan song?

419
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:57,840
Yeah.

420
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:02,640
And slow like slow fades of children that have been saved from like try from trafficking,

421
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:05,240
you know, just really hit those emotional buttons.

422
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:10,000
And then then Tim Cook comes up on stage with hands folded together and like the in like

423
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:15,960
that triangle shape that he does and shaking them up and down, you know, at Apple, we care.

424
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:18,080
You can see it now.

425
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:19,080
The thoughtful triangle.

426
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:20,080
Yes.

427
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:21,080
Yes.

428
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:22,080
Yes.

429
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,080
The thoughtful triangle.

430
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:25,760
Oh, somebody title suggests that that is that is it.

431
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:26,760
Oh, man.

432
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:28,800
OK, well, I mean, all we can do is wait.

433
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:29,800
It's going to happen.

434
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:31,480
It's landing in iOS 15.

435
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:33,640
The stakes here are incredibly high.

436
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:35,760
Apple could blow this so bad.

437
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:40,800
And going back to that, the misreporting, I think the really unfortunate side effect

438
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:45,520
of that is Apple will lean on what people are misinformed.

439
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:49,220
They don't understand the nuances and Apple will be right about that.

440
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:53,920
And that will be their go to defense over and over and over again.

441
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:56,640
And you look at things like the Washington Post.

442
00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:01,020
They just blew this story so, so bad.

443
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:05,840
Their opening paragraph is just complete and total crap, complete crap.

444
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:07,760
And it's it just gets worse from there.

445
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:13,400
And that's that's that's a damn shame, because this is a fundamental shift in privacy and

446
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:19,440
hyperbole isn't going to help us get to the pros and cons of this.

447
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:22,480
And ultimately, I don't think it's going to move the needle for anybody.

448
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,720
I don't think it's going to stop anybody from using iOS.

449
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:29,760
I don't think it's going to stop anybody from using iMessage or iCloud photo library.

450
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:34,320
I think the only thing this will ultimately do is take a little pressure off Apple to

451
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:38,360
build in backdoors, which is why I go back to that one possible explanation, because

452
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:43,520
if you look at the outcome of this is when Apple turns this sucker on, they're probably

453
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:46,560
going to find a bunch of kiddie porn in people's iPhone library.

454
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:49,960
And all of a sudden, they're going to have a whole group of people in their offices looking

455
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:51,100
at naked kids.

456
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:54,120
That's the reality of this change, which is in itself illegal.

457
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:58,400
But now they're going to point to this in antitrust hearings in encryption, backdoor

458
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:02,080
hearings, and they're going to say, look at Apple, we care, we're doing this.

459
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:05,740
And that, I think, is ultimately going to be the biggest result of this is there some

460
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:08,000
staff are going to look at more naked pictures of kids.

461
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,200
Some people are going to get in trouble, a couple of people, because let's be honest,

462
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:14,120
who's dumb enough to put that crap in my photo library to begin with.

463
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:17,120
And they're going to have now an argument to use to push back against the government

464
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:19,640
of various countries.

465
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:20,640
That's the net result of this.

466
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:25,600
Oh, oh, and of course, they lose part of their branding as the as a privacy first company

467
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,800
who designs things in a way that you can't be snooped on.

468
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:28,800
They've just losing that now.

469
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:30,260
And they're going to lose it anyway.

470
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:31,260
It was coming, wasn't it?

471
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:33,120
You could feel it coming with their push towards services.

472
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:37,680
I don't know, I in in some way, I feel like I'm tilting at windmills a little bit here,

473
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:41,320
because I don't know that we're ever going back.

474
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:42,980
But everything's a service now.

475
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:46,880
Everything's a subscription, which means that you need data on your users.

476
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:50,640
You know, even in the most innocent cases, it's built in now.

477
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:51,640
It's built in.

478
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:52,640
It's part of them.

479
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:54,960
These aren't really devices with software.

480
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:59,280
These are portals to an ecosystem of services.

481
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:01,600
And honestly, basically a lifestyle, right?

482
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:04,320
I think about I have home pods now.

483
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,960
Thanks a lot, Chris.

484
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:12,240
No, it would be so painful for me to extricate myself from the I life.

485
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:13,840
Because it's all tied together.

486
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,680
And how is it tied together?

487
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:21,280
All the services to have all the data on my account and my purchases and my preferences.

488
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:26,480
It realized like where I live when I moved to this house from a couple towns over.

489
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:30,640
And I did not have to tell iOS that they just figured it out.

490
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:34,800
When I was at the Salt Lake City meetup, it the conversation went like this, I'm always,

491
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:37,800
you know, asking and trying to get a feel and the conversation goes just like this.

492
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:41,480
It goes, I know I'm actually I'm on a Mac now.

493
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:42,480
And they always hang their head in shame.

494
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:46,360
Yeah, I got a Mac, you know, I mean, my servers are still all Linux, my servers, my servers

495
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:47,360
are all still Linux.

496
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:48,360
But

497
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:49,360
my servers to SUSE.

498
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:51,360
Well, that's actually Ubuntu.

499
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:52,360
Yeah.

500
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:53,360
Oh, man.

501
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:55,400
Ah, yes.

502
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:58,200
And and I think it's it in every conversation.

503
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:04,080
It's the stuff you and I touched on weeks ago in the show is, you know, the late 30s,

504
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:08,400
early 40s, to late 40s, for just about most of the people that were there, with a few

505
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:14,480
exceptions, kids, for a lot of them, and a full time job.

506
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:16,520
And they just felt like life got busy.

507
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:18,120
And I just kind of fell into this.

508
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:20,280
And it's just working for me.

509
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:23,760
And they I guess, you know, they feel like they've lost a bit of their geek cred.

510
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:27,720
And I, I feel like we should, we should try to push back against I don't feel like anybody

511
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:32,160
should feel ashamed of what tool they choose to do their job, you know, and I, I feel bad

512
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:34,200
that they felt a little shame admitting it to me.

513
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:36,800
But you know, I'm trying to be cool about it, because I understand.

514
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:42,040
If you've ever used SSH, compared to the general population of the world, you are a geek.

515
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:43,960
Don't worry.

516
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:47,040
Even if you've used it in something weird on Windows, like putty or whatever, right,

517
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:48,040
you're fine.

518
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:49,040
I love it.

519
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:50,040
Apologies to Windows users.

520
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:54,160
I think I may have said the wrong application name because I don't use Windows because you

521
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:57,800
know, obviously, that's not real.

549
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:43,320
So Zoom, your favorite video conferencing company in the world, has to pay out $85 million

550
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:50,000
for lying about end-to-end encryption and sending user data to Facebook and Google.

551
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:55,640
So this is like a claim that happened because essentially Zoom has like all this language

552
00:30:55,640 --> 00:31:02,000
around we don't share your data, and the calls are end-to-end encrypted, and Zoom takes privacy

553
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,120
seriously and adequately protects users' personal information.

554
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:08,740
These are quotes from like their privacy policy and their EULA and stuff like that.

555
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:15,560
And then it turned out that because Zoom had implemented the Facebook SDK and Google's

556
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:20,920
Firebase SDK, they were sending everything off to Facebook and Google.

557
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:25,920
Quite a bit of data, it seems, even before the user had accepted the EULA and privacy

558
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:26,920
statement.

559
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:28,440
Oh, that's brutal.

560
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:33,600
So there is a real dev story here about maybe you want to check out what your dependencies

561
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:34,600
are actually doing.

562
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:39,320
You know, when you install a CocoaPod or whatever, a PIP package or RubyGem, you want to maybe

563
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:42,520
just check out what's going on there.

564
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:46,160
I wonder, like, do you think they even knew everybody that was just like sitting there

565
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:47,160
implementing that SDK?

566
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:48,160
Do you think?

567
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:49,360
I mean, they must have known, right?

568
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:52,440
They must have known that it was sending off analytics to both Facebook and Google.

569
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:56,720
Well, like did the developers who just like needed the Facebook SDK to hit whatever, you

570
00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:02,680
know, Jira card they were working on know anything about what the legal department was

571
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:03,680
doing, right?

572
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:08,940
They had a KPI, right, a key performance indicator of integrating like Facebook and like once

573
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:12,960
you get Facebook integrated, we've reached one of our goals for our OKR.

574
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:17,000
Oh, man, that's exactly why.

575
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,720
And of course, you got to get Firebase in there, too, because you need all the data.

576
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:21,320
You can't just have Facebook stuff.

577
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:24,440
Oh, what is this, like a corporate conferencing tool?

578
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:27,000
But of course, the lawyers are going to get their cut.

579
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,000
You know, they're going to get their cut.

580
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:32,480
The lawyers, they're going to get 25 to 15 bucks per person.

581
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:37,680
They're basically it works out like the lawyers get millions of dollars, like up to 25 percent

582
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:38,680
of the 85 million.

583
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:39,680
That's what the lawyers will take.

584
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:43,480
And then they also have two hundred thousand dollars of expenses that get reimbursed on

585
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:44,480
top of that.

586
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:49,040
So the lawyers are really working this case and they're going to make out great and users

587
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:53,600
are going to get like maybe five, eight bucks if if you were a user during this time.

588
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:59,040
I just like that, you know, the sword that they fell on was importing the Facebook SDK.

589
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:01,320
I know that is hilarious.

590
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:06,840
The judge also ordered Google and Facebook to delete any of the data they collected.

591
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:09,320
But there's no enforcement mechanism there.

592
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:14,040
And does it matter if they've already sold ads based on that data?

593
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:15,040
Right.

594
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:16,920
If they've already used it to identify things about you.

595
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:17,920
Right.

596
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:21,160
And if they've used it to feed their their ever growing algorithmic engines, does it?

597
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:25,840
I mean, I'm sure they never want to delete data, but do they care that much at this point?

598
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:26,840
Right.

599
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:28,840
But at this point, the machine has probably learned.

600
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:32,800
So it's like, OK, the beast has consumed your data.

601
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:38,800
And I mean, if I was Facebook and I was and we see story after story about just how voraciously

602
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:43,800
data hungry they are and about how how far they're willing to go to get data, you know,

603
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:47,620
there's no way they're letting that that that kind of analytics come in from Zoom and they're

604
00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:49,380
not doing something with it.

605
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:52,080
They're absolutely consuming it and taking action on that.

606
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:54,560
And same with Google, they'd be negligent not to.

607
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:57,760
So this whole thing feels so slap on the wrist.

608
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:58,760
Eighty five million bucks.

609
00:33:58,760 --> 00:33:59,920
Sure, that sucks.

610
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:03,060
But I bet Zoom would pay that again in the heartbeat to have the kind of user growth

611
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:04,880
they did during the peak of the pandemic.

612
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:05,880
It was worth it.

613
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:06,880
It's a speeding ticket.

614
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:08,940
It is a speeding ticket.

615
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:11,040
It really, really is.

616
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:13,760
And we'll just keep all plugging away at using Zoom.

617
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:14,920
I have a hot tip for you, though.

618
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:20,040
If you use Zoom on Linux, use the flat pack version and then they can't monitor all the

619
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:25,200
processes on your PC and what active windows you're using, which is a creepy thing that

620
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:30,000
Zoom can report to those that are running the meeting if they have a pro Zoom account

621
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,440
or enterprise Zoom account or whatever.

622
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:36,380
They can get analytics on how long the window was active versus how long the meeting was.

623
00:34:36,380 --> 00:34:41,280
And they can get analytics on all of the other processes running on your Mac or Windows machine.

624
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:44,920
So creepy and gross.

625
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:45,920
That's ridiculous.

626
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:46,920
Yeah.

627
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:49,440
And then there was just a story that one of the call centers that Apple works with, which

628
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:53,840
is like this large call center that handles a ton of companies, but because one of them

629
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:55,800
is Apple, it made a headline.

630
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:59,120
They're based out of, I think it was Chicago, I can't remember.

631
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:02,940
But they now have cameras on all the time policy while you're at work.

632
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:06,760
Even if you're working from home, your webcam must be on so that way they can watch what

633
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:11,900
you're doing and monitor for odd activity, I guess.

634
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:13,520
So it just gets weirder and weirder.

635
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:15,080
So is this our surveillance edition?

636
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:17,840
I mean, we've really got a theme.

637
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:20,400
I guess.

638
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:21,480
It's like there's a...

639
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:22,480
Corporate America is sliding.

640
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:25,840
Well, if you want to work from home, then we're going to up the monitoring.

641
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:27,920
And it's like they're freaking out.

642
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:29,120
We have to have butts in chairs.

643
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:34,560
And if we can't physically monitor butts in chairs, we'll virtually monitor butts in seats.

644
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:37,000
So you better get your employee monitoring set up.

645
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,000
No.

646
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,660
You're falling behind.

647
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:44,680
You need like a heads up display, maybe like a butt sensor so you know literally when butts

648
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:45,680
are in seats.

649
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:48,040
What if they have a standing desk?

650
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:49,040
Could you imagine?

651
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:51,880
Well, then you get a pressure pad.

652
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:52,880
Obviously.

653
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:57,760
Well, she's definitely working, but it appears she's doing jumping jacks, too.

654
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:00,920
I don't understand.

655
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:06,880
Maybe I could train the dog to stand on the pressure plate, you know.

656
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:09,960
I just want to take a moment and mention for all of you out there that are ready to get

657
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:14,320
certified and you're looking at the Linux Engineer Exam 201, our friends at a Cloud

658
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:16,080
Guru have a course for you.

659
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:21,000
This course has been designed to cover all of the objectives for the LPIC-2 201 exam.

660
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:24,240
We will have a link in the show notes or you can go to cloudguru.com.

661
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:28,880
It begins with capacity planning and includes utilities and concepts for measuring resource

662
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:33,040
usage, predicting future resource needs, all of the kind of thinking you're going to need

663
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:34,160
for the exam.

664
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:39,620
Once you've completed that course, you'll be prepared to sit and pass LPIC-2 201 exam.

665
00:36:39,620 --> 00:36:44,020
So go try it out, see what you can learn and maybe even get certified.

666
00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:47,960
It's all at a cloudguru.com and we'll have a link in the show notes.

667
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:52,080
Wow, this has been another depressing episode of Coder Radio.

668
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:55,200
Maybe next week we'll go back to the internet of the 90s.

669
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:56,200
That'd be fun.

670
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:57,200
We should do some nostalgia soon.

671
00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:01,940
You know, we do have a new Coderly report posted for our Coder QA members.

672
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:05,080
And if you're not a Coder QA member yet and you want to support the show, keep us going,

673
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:09,440
keep us independent and you get access to the Coderly report every quarter.

674
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:10,480
There's a new Coderly.

675
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:11,480
So go grab that.

676
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:17,000
It's a bit germane to part of our topics today and that's at coderqa.co.

677
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:20,320
Mr. Dominic, is there anything you want to mention or plug or tell the people to go check

678
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:21,840
out before we get out of here?

679
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:22,840
Nope.

680
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:24,200
Just follow me at Timon Nugent on Twitter.

681
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:25,200
That's really easy.

682
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:26,200
You could also follow me.

683
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:28,040
I'm at Chris LAS, the podcast network.

684
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:29,680
Well, I'm glad you asked.

685
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:33,520
That's at Jupiter Signal and the show is at Coder Radio Show.

686
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:35,140
And that's handy for announcements and stuff.

687
00:37:35,140 --> 00:37:36,140
You never know.

688
00:37:36,140 --> 00:37:39,040
I guess things could be, you know, shifting or whatever while I'm on the road.

689
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:44,440
I think the next Coder Radio, I'm not positive, but I think the next one will either be in

690
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:48,080
Denver or just outside of the Denver area.

691
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:49,560
And then it is meet up time.

692
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:50,560
Awesome.

693
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:51,560
I know.

694
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:52,560
Pretty stoked.

695
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:55,920
I'm going to go to System 76, see if I can I spy how they build that launch keyboard.

696
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:58,080
Maybe walk out of there with a couple of Thaleos under my arms.

697
00:37:58,080 --> 00:37:59,080
I'll never notice.

698
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:02,680
I'll bring my big jacket.

699
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:04,460
Links to what we talked about today.

700
00:38:04,460 --> 00:38:07,080

701
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:08,880

702
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:09,880

703
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:10,880
It's a big part of the show.

704
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:11,880
Go send us your feedback.

705
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:13,900

You can subscribe and you can send the show to somebody.

707
00:38:16,180 --> 00:38:17,320
That's always real nice.

708
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:24,880
And then join us for Coder Radio live on Mondays at 10 a.m. Pacific, noon, Eastern.

709
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:26,280
Time math is hard right now.

710
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:29,840
I'm in the mountains, but I'd love to have you join us live at jblife.tv.

711
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:30,840
