00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:43,200
My name is Chris and joining us like the podcasting master he is, it's our host, Mr. Dominic.

9
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,200
Hello Mike.

10
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:45,200
What's up, Chris official?

11
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,160
We are going home.

12
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:53,000
I missed you, you know, I missed you because we took a week off so I could travel and I

13
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
get the itches, you know?

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,480
So I got to like, I got to like ping you and slack and stuff just to get like my fix.

15
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:58,480
Right.

16
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:01,240
You kind of watch the Phantom Menace and private browsing mode so nobody else knows.

17
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:02,240
I get it.

18
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:03,240
Yeah.

19
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:06,120
And then I just, I just send you like a, like a audio recording of my breathing while I

20
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:10,400
watch the movie, not the audio of the movie, just my breathing, you know, so you have that

21
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,880
because I want you to have that.

22
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:12,880
That's amazing.

23
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:16,200
Hey, I apologize if I sound like, but I'm in Idaho, you know, it can't be helped because

24
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:17,200
I'm in Idaho.

25
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,200
So I'm not in the studio.

26
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,200
I'm in Idaho.

27
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,200
I'm in quarter lane.

28
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,840
You ever been to quarter lane, Idaho?

29
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:22,840
It's beautiful.

30
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:24,080
It's the only client claim that I have.

31
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:28,340
I tell you what, it's like a, it's like a, it's like a part of Washington and a little

32
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:31,080
bit of Texas and Montana all mixed into one spot here.

33
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:32,340
It's actually kind of pleasant.

34
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:36,320
Are you on a classified mission for Lady Choups?

35
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,080
Yeah.

36
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:42,400
Secret podcasting business, obviously, you know, as always, I got secret podcasting biz.

37
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:45,400
On Her Majesty's podcasting service, right?

38
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,640
This is my return West.

39
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:52,720
I'm heading back West, back to Seattle and stopped here for a couple of days and been

40
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:56,840
getting some business done and I've been like fighting stupid technical issues.

41
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:03,680
Well, actually, let me tell you something, man, on my way out here, like just mechanical

42
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:08,360
issue after mechanical issue, I've, I've paid nearly a thousand dollars in emergency repairs

43
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:10,480
just on the drive out here, right?

44
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:11,480
Not Lady Choups.

45
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:12,480
Yeah.

46
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,480
Yeah.

47
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:14,480
Yeah.

48
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,480
Yeah.

49
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:16,480
It's almost like these RVs break down all the time or something.

50
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,480
I don't know how to explain it.

51
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:21,480
Actually, I am legitimately struggling with a design flaw.

52
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:25,120
You know, you know, you, you know, sometimes like you get down the road like a few years

53
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:29,240
in a project and you discover there's a fundamental design flaw that really can't be fixed.

54
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,240
Nope.

55
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,240
That's never happened to me.

56
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:33,720
And unless you can prove it, my lawyers will tell you no.

57
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:34,720
Yeah.

58
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:35,720
Yeah.

59
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:38,000
And so the way this thing works is it has these slides that go out for the kitchen in

60
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,920
the living room and it gives you like a miraculous amount of space inside a vehicle.

61
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:45,880
But when those slides break, you're immobilized.

62
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:47,760
And so the engine can be in great shape.

63
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,920
You can have tires, great suspension, you can have solar power.

64
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:53,720
You can be an off-grid machine, but if your slides break, you're just screwed.

65
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:54,980
And so that kept happening to us.

66
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:58,840
But the highlight of the trip really was, as I suspect the kid and the wife might've

67
00:02:58,840 --> 00:02:59,840
gotten COVID.

68
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:00,840
I'm not sure.

69
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,680
Cause obviously how can I tell without getting them tested?

70
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:03,680
Oh God.

71
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:04,680
Yeah.

72
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:05,680
Yeah.

73
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,680
They both got sick, came down with the symptoms.

74
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:09,960
The wife and I have been vaccinated, so I don't know how she would have gotten it, but

75
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:18,080
she, you know, the stuffy nose, cough, lost a taste, you know, just checking off the fatigue.

76
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:22,600
Her and the boy have the same exact symptoms, but nobody else has gotten it.

77
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:26,920
So we're of course doing the whole like quarantine thing now.

78
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:30,200
I'm sure I speak for all the listeners here, but wish you guys well.

79
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,200
That's awful.

80
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,200
Thank you.

81
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,360
So far I haven't, I don't seem to have any symptoms.

82
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:36,520
I don't seem, Oh man, tell you what.

83
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:40,440
So, but you know, there's been nice things too, family time and all that, you know, so

84
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:42,800
it's like, so now the kids are gone, right?

85
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:46,960
They've left with their mom and you know, while the kids are here and it gets towards

86
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:50,080
the end of the trip, I'm like, Oh man, it's going to be so nice when it's just a DNI and

87
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,640
it's going to be quiet and we won't have any kids.

88
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:57,440
And then legitimately the moment the kids leave, I'm like, Oh, I miss the kids.

89
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:01,080
What kind of, what kind of screwed up, like I torture myself like, Oh, I can't wait for

90
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,120
quiet time.

91
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,120
And then I get it.

92
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,120
And I'm like, Oh, I miss the kids.

93
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:06,740
And I never, I never am happy.

94
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:08,520
Nobody told me this was the deal with fatherhood.

95
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,520
I have the same experience.

96
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:14,200
My kid has been with grandma for approximately eight hours and I'm like a meth fiend, jonesing

97
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,200
right now.

98
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:21,160
And it's like, I've been waiting for this for like a week and then it gets here actually

99
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,160
more than a week.

100
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,160
Right.

101
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,160
I've been for two weeks.

102
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,160
I've been waiting and then it gets here.

103
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,160
I'm like, Oh, I just, I don't know.

104
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:30,480
So anyways, I'm here in Coeur d'Alene now self quarantining in my RV symptom list so

105
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:38,160
far and I just have a few more days to wait out and then I'll be back on my way again.

106
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,160
So let's do some emails.

107
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,720
I hope it's not about robes.

108
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,720
Yeah.

109
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:44,520
So drew writes in, he said, I hadn't heard much about the robe.

110
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:47,560
God damn it.

111
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:51,240
I know we were off and so I didn't mention the robe and it's just, I'm curious about

112
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,240
it.

113
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:56,240
I'd like it a robe update because you know, he wants his, he wants his quarter.

114
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:02,480
So some, some very, very thankfully and very frustrating stuff in here and you know, it

115
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:04,440
is what it is with this damn thing.

116
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:06,800
But some people have received their robes and that's incredible.

117
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,960
So that's the, that's the positive side and I'll start with that.

118
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:13,400
The positive thing is some robes have gone out.

119
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:17,660
The negative thing is only small batches at a time are going out and it's going to be

120
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:23,120
that way probably until the end of June if their current estimates are correct.

121
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:31,160
And it is 100% my fault because I delayed trying to solve the international shipping.

122
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:38,160
I pushed the manufacturing back into a international global supply chain shut down.

123
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:42,720
And if you could not believe it, after all of the other troubles I had with this robe,

124
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:47,180
we are now dealing with a supply chain shortage for the raw materials to actually make the

125
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:48,180
robe itself.

126
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:51,440
Because of course I had to pick a fancy material.

127
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:55,040
I had to pick something nice and comfortable that would last.

128
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:58,880
And so I were listening to ATP and Marko, yes, I understand.

129
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:03,440
I got all fancy, you know, I got my fancy, fancy robe.

130
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:07,400
And now of course that's in a material shortage.

131
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:10,400
So they get a little bit, they can make a few and they send them out and they say it's

132
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:14,560
going to be done by the end of June, but I am actually pretty skeptical of that man.

133
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,560
Oh man.

134
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:19,120
And if I, you know what I, and now what I would do is I would order all of the robes

135
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:22,540
and have them shipped to the studio and then I would either ship them out from the studio

136
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:23,540
or do fulfillment.

137
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:27,920
Like I could do this robe again in, in two weeks and it'd be done.

138
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:31,680
It'd be open up the orders, take the orders for a week and then the next week they ship

139
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,680
out.

140
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:36,640
Because what I would do now is I would just buy a batch of them and I would stock them

141
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:39,300
and I would take care of the shipping aspects.

142
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:44,000
And I, I made such a mistake with this one, but I realized how else would I have ever

143
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,060
figured this stuff out?

144
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:48,160
The system I have now is like dialed in.

145
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,360
I'm actually pretty proud of it.

146
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:55,500
Learned a lot of lessons, but this damn effing robe is still not done.

147
00:06:55,500 --> 00:07:00,080
And it legitimately feels like when you're going through a rough patch in life and then

148
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:03,540
you're like, when this robe is done and ship and I'm on the other side of this thing, it's

149
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:07,440
going to feel like I've come through something like I've gone through a phase of life.

150
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:10,600
I cannot believe all of the issues.

151
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,440
And this delay was totally my fault.

152
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:18,320
I knew, I knew before I ever opened my dumb, stupid mouth on air, I knew I shouldn't commit

153
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:22,600
to international orders because I didn't know that I just, it was an unknown, but I thought

154
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:26,000
to myself, I thought, how hard can it be?

155
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,600
I can figure this out.

156
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,600
I'll figure it out.

157
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,600
I'm a clever guy.

158
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,120
How hard can it be?

159
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:36,260
And then a pandemic happened and I had me being Mr. Clever trying to delay and trying

160
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:37,800
to get the international shipping figured out.

161
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:40,940
So it wasn't eighty five effing dollars a robe.

162
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:43,700
That delay pushed it right into this whole supply chain shortage thing.

163
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:50,700
And if it's just not one damn thing after another with this robe, I'm so done with it.

164
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:51,720
So it's close, though.

165
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:52,720
It's close.

166
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:53,720
I haven't received mine yet.

167
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,960
So there you go.

168
00:07:55,960 --> 00:08:00,080
It's legitimately not like even like a first come first serve order thing.

169
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,000
I don't even know the order they're sending them out in.

170
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,280
And, huh, and you know what happens when you have something that gets delayed like this

171
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:11,840
for this long, people move, they move because months have gone by.

172
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:16,600
And so now we have to like try to catch orders in flight and update their shipping address

173
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:20,360
when people move, which, by the way, if you're moving and want to ship to a different address,

174
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:23,720
email me Chris at Jupiter broadcasting dot com, because I'm going to put a batch in for

175
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:26,080
a couple of order updates in a couple of days.

176
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,600
So if you want to get yours in when you're hearing this, let me know.

177
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:31,000
But yeah, so there you go, Drew.

178
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,460
That is the latest.

179
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:35,320
So if you are email me and you haven't gotten yours yet, then you aren't one of the first

180
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,500
that have gotten theirs.

181
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:37,500
But don't worry.

182
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:41,100
Neither am I.

183
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:42,100
Never again.

184
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:43,480
I know what I'll do.

185
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:45,640
And I like the company we're working with still.

186
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:46,780
Coffee cups.

187
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:47,780
Just do coffee.

188
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:48,780
Well, I mean, I could do it.

189
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:49,780
I just would anything, anything.

190
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:53,000
I would just do it differently than the key thing is.

191
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,440
And I don't want to throw any particular company under the bus here.

192
00:08:55,440 --> 00:09:02,360
But the key core like total mistake I made is trying to get the manufacturer to work

193
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:06,560
directly with another shipping company or do the drop shipment themselves instead of

194
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,800
just getting me all of the product.

195
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:13,460
I tried to have it go directly from manufacturing to the customer, and that was a bad idea.

196
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:17,560
It seemed like the simplest route because it seemed like a dumb idea to like have me

197
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:19,840
involved as a middleman managing the shipping.

198
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:23,940
But clearly, clearly that would have been better because now what we've implemented

199
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:27,920
with Jupiter Garage has been so smooth.

200
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,440
It's so efficient.

201
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:32,400
It's just so much better that it's obvious that's the way I should have gone from the

202
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,400
beginning.

203
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:36,080
But I guess I just I wouldn't have known until I tried.

204
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:39,560
And now I just want to have to have a drink when I think about the road.

205
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:41,820
I just want to drink.

206
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:42,820
One day I will.

207
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:45,400
I'll be sipping my whiskey and wearing nothing but a robe.

208
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:50,480
But in the meantime, Simon writes, Hi, guys, you know, recently, Mike literally described

209
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:55,760
Chrome OS and this is in regards to like a Linux vendor that could save us from the integrated

210
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:56,760
Apple experience.

211
00:09:56,760 --> 00:10:01,960
He said Mike described Chrome OS and Chromebooks in Episode 414, a Linux distro and OS that

212
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:05,360
is tightly integrated with the hardware and doesn't care about including proprietary

213
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,360
blobs.

214
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:10,120
Google will eventually cut the right deals with the right OEMs who are working on something

215
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,800
approaching the M1.

216
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:15,200
It'll be a little while, but I think we'll see a device running Linux that compete with

217
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:19,240
Apple and maybe it'll just be on price, but maybe it'll also be performance.

218
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:24,100
The GPL extremists will find a way to complain about it, but at least there will be something

219
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:26,740
to compete with Apple.

220
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:27,740
Maybe I don't know.

221
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:29,220
What do you think?

222
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:32,640
Is Google Chromebook's going to save us now?

223
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:33,640
Just now.

224
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:34,640
Yeah, I think you're probably right.

225
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:38,640
I would I mean, I think the issue I had and this is the case I tried to make in the episode

226
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:42,920
is I mean, yes, Apple has impressive hardware, blah, blah, blah.

227
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:45,620
The software gets updated and modified to support the hardware.

228
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:47,840
That's great and matters, blah, blah, blah.

229
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:54,160
But I think I think it's more about the companies and I think it's the culture in the companies.

230
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,920
And I think that's why nobody's catching up with Apple.

231
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:59,760
It's not a matter of a technical deal with Samsung to make a crazy great ARM processor

232
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:03,960
to go in a Chromebook that then gets sold at Best Buy because that's been the strategy

233
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:04,960
all along.

234
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:09,080
It's that these companies don't have the follow through and the actual ability to do the end

235
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:11,920
to end deals and software and integration necessary.

236
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:17,000
Yeah, I think it's just not going to happen because, yeah, I mean, you're right.

237
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,960
Yeah, it's just not going to happen.

238
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:22,500
Jimmy writes and he says, you know, gentlemen, I wanted to share a thought on Chris's comment

239
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:26,340
about Apple's edge when designing hardware and software together with the performance

240
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:30,860
improvements seemingly like they're unstoppable force these days.

241
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:33,800
And I want to just pause right here if you're just catching if you're just catching up.

242
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:37,880
Mike and I have been discussing recently that we think the reason why Apple keeps coming

243
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:42,120
up so much in the emails and in the news and in our conversations is because they're really

244
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:46,360
pulling ahead right now in a way that kind of seems unstoppable in terms of performance

245
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:48,040
and software integration.

246
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:52,900
And one of the things we talked about as an example is in the M1 architecture now they

247
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:56,760
have the big little set up where you have the high powered cores, the fast cores and

248
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:58,600
you have the high efficiency cores.

249
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:01,880
And when they rolled those out, Mac OS immediately supported that.

250
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:05,400
And one of the things that contributes to fantastic battery life apparently on these

251
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:10,500
M1 is a lot of the background tasks, you know, scheduled jobs and operating system maintenance.

252
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:14,960
The OS has been designed to put lower priority tasks on the lower efficiency or I should

253
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:18,600
say the higher efficiency cores, the cores that save power.

254
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:22,440
And that was a that was a good example of hardware rolls out, everything just supports

255
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:24,200
it, performance is incredible.

256
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:29,280
And it's an example of sort of this focused focused attack mode that Apple goes into when

257
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:30,660
developing these products.

258
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:35,140
But Jimmy says it reminded him of a recent episode on Sam Harris's podcast.

259
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:41,060
Him and a guest talked about loose cultures and ordered cultures and how they respond

260
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:43,440
to threats, change and a myriad of other topics.

261
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:46,880
The connection he's making here is that Apple is effectively an ordered culture when it

262
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:51,600
comes to products, which geopolitically is much like China.

263
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:56,100
China's strength is that it can act with efficiency, building hospitals in weeks and really own

264
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:57,920
the messaging and the process.

265
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:03,220
This is a benefit of their ordered culture, but it comes at the cost of certain liberties

266
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:04,840
within society.

267
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:09,800
Apple can own the entire process as well as set the rules of the game, which we're going

268
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:13,360
to see in the epic case, sort of a similar comparison.

269
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:19,480
Meanwhile, the X86 and AMD and the non Apple armed devices, their culture is much more

270
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:23,960
fragmented into loose Confederacy or groups that can't really operate at the efficiency

271
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:27,640
of Apple, particularly with hardware, software integration.

272
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:31,960
This kind of reminds me, Jimmy says, of the United States and how efficient they are at

273
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:33,680
responding to anything, really.

274
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:39,080
The Confederacy allows great and terrible ideas to equally flourish.

275
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:43,640
So it'll always be behind in some regards to consumer hardware because of this.

276
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:48,000
Add to this, Apple's ordered structure lends itself to a strong brand because it doesn't

277
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,600
have to share that with anyone else.

278
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:53,960
What brand does the non Apple world have with consumer hardware?

279
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:56,640
Where's the leadership in that Confederacy?

280
00:13:56,640 --> 00:14:00,780
It's fragmented and it cannot compete with Apple right now.

281
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:03,480
So he's saying, and I'm curious to know your take on this.

282
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:07,480
What Jimmy is saying is it's essentially just the structure of these groups.

283
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:09,720
And so for a while, Apple is going to run away with it.

284
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:13,240
They're going to they're going to push forward and they're going to lap the hardware industry

285
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:16,800
and the software integration industry and iOS devices will remain super fast because

286
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:17,800
of this.

287
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:18,800
And now MacBooks will, too.

288
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:23,280
And there's nothing the X86 world can do because of the way it's structured right now.

289
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:24,600
That seems pretty bleak, Mike.

290
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:25,600
It's pretty bleak.

291
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:31,260
I mean, it also has a lot to do with like decisions Intel made years ago that no one

292
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:33,960
could have foreseen as being bad, but we're kind of bad, right?

293
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:35,800
They kind of back themselves into a corner.

294
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:40,400
I don't remember what episode it was, but John Siracusa on ATP had a great breakdown

295
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:44,860
of how Intel accidentally backed themselves into a corner.

296
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:52,040
Now one thing I think that's maybe a little parochial, but he misses in this email is

297
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:57,300
Apple just has infinite money effectively to do whatever they want, right?

298
00:14:57,300 --> 00:15:02,920
So Apple does not need to sell these processors to anyone at a profit.

299
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:06,440
And I don't know if you know this, Chris, but Apple's profit margin on all their products

300
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:13,680
is a I believe it's called fat with a pH, especially those dongles, right?

301
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:19,000
They can sort of just take the pain where, let's say, Intel or Qualcomm kind of have

302
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
to sell.

303
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,080
You know, that's a that's a volume versus margin business, right?

304
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:29,080
So and they're licensing fees at each stage that cut into the other person's profits for

305
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:30,080
that particular product.

306
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:34,640
You know, I go back to like, you know, you just dismissed it out of hand.

307
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:40,760
But that that modular laptop that uses the USBC interconnects to let you sort of assemble

308
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:43,040
your own machine with your own ports.

309
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:47,640
And I just I keep like Alexi wrote in and Alexi's like it's just at the end of the day,

310
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:50,580
it's never going to matter because they don't let you repair the machines.

311
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:52,560
And that's just a hard line for him.

312
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:59,820
He says, I know you guys like your iPad Pros and Florida man likes his M1.

313
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:04,020
But what would it take for you to give up on these platforms to him?

314
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:05,440
It's like that's just a line he won't cross.

315
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,440
He's like, so you're never going to let you repair it.

316
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,200
They don't respect your rights.

317
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:11,120
How is that not just a full stop right there?

318
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:15,480
Alexi says, just stop giving Apple your money.

319
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:19,560
I just I think that's how a lot of people feel out there in the audience is that's a

320
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:24,760
line that's just too far like that's the ultimate sin is baking all of the parts in and never

321
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:29,480
letting you, you know, upgrade the hard drive or replace a hard drive or replace a battery.

322
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:30,480
Okay.

323
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,240
But the problem is that's exactly what I want.

324
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,240
Right.

325
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:34,240
I mean, I can't speak for you.

326
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:40,720
But, you know, if, you know, Dell or system 76, you know, I preferred Linux vendor, made

327
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:45,240
me the equivalent of an iMac Pro that was an all in one that had a goddamn camera and

328
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:50,880
good microphone in the screen that I didn't have to worry about switching audio inputs.

329
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:51,880
I would do it.

330
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:52,880
Right.

331
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:53,880
That's kind of what I want.

332
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,240
I don't want to have to hook up a webcam.

333
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:56,540
I don't want to run cable.

334
00:16:56,540 --> 00:17:03,640
I don't want I mean, my hatred of fan noise as well recorded right to repair.

335
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:04,640
I mean, I know.

336
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:05,640
Yeah, sure.

337
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:06,640
In theory.

338
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:07,640
But I don't repair anything.

339
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:08,640
I just pour gin on it and throw it out.

340
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:13,700
So I think the success of laptops in the consumer market and in the business market has kind

341
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:20,080
of shown that there is not a huge, huge general drive of these kinds of repair abilities.

342
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:26,400
I think most people treat these as dispensable appliances, as maybe as reprehensive and non

343
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,720
sustainable as that is.

344
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:29,600
They just treat them as replaceable appliances.

345
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:33,680
You know, Alexi went on to say that right to repair matters more because of just the

346
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:37,460
significant failure rates of Mac devices.

347
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:43,120
He goes on a lot about the you know, the M ones are failing and the hard drives are bad.

348
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:47,760
I see these kinds of things go around a lot on the Internet, but I think it comes down

349
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:48,760
to scale.

350
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:54,520
Like when you sell millions of a product and then thousands have issues and those thousands

351
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:58,200
take to the Internet to complain, it sends a skewed perspective.

352
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:02,420
And I I really hate that it sounds like I'm defending Apple here because I think it should

353
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:03,420
be repairable.

354
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:04,420
It is kind of a line for me.

355
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:09,000
And that's why every Mac I've ever bought has been after much consternation and really

356
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,600
weighing the pros and cons of that tool or not.

357
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:12,800
So it does bother me.

358
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:17,040
And that's why I do tend to lean towards devices that give me access to swap those parts out.

359
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:21,240
But even my trusty X1 carbon here now has a soldered in hard drive.

360
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:25,200
I have I'm holding it right here in my hands, you can you can hear the solid plastic that

361
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,200
nice plastic.

362
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,200
Right.

363
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,920
My Windows box is an X1 carbon now.

364
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:30,920
Yeah.

365
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:34,560
And I don't know about the Windows version, but the Linux version has soldered down storage.

366
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:35,560
Go figure.

367
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:36,560
So, yeah, me.

368
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:43,220
So now my ThinkPad has soldered storage and a built in battery, too, that I can't remove.

369
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:45,920
And so it just seems to be going across the entire industry.

370
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:50,040
It's perhaps maybe it's like an old man thing like it's something that early computer users

371
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:52,960
expect, Mike, and new computer users maybe don't even think of it.

372
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:53,960
I see.

373
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:54,960
I feel like it's the opposite.

374
00:18:54,960 --> 00:19:00,840
Like, you know, I know I was kind of slightly slagging off Alexi here, but when I was younger,

375
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:03,440
I actually would have been right there with them.

376
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:07,360
It's now that I'm like a boring dad that I'm kind of like, I just don't care.

377
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:08,360
Right.

378
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:12,520
If it breaks, I want to drive it 20 minutes to the store and have them give me a new one.

379
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:14,120
And we've heard that a lot.

380
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:18,960
Like I you know, I got old and busy and now I just don't build PCs anymore and I don't

381
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:21,480
really want to troubleshoot them when I get home.

382
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:24,080
You know, when we see people that talk about why they've switched.

383
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:27,640
I have a real world case, you know, I'm in the market for a flight simulation machine

384
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:32,200
again and I have that old Thaleo, you know, and it was built for when I bought it.

385
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:33,200
I don't know.

386
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:36,920
Was it three years ago, two years ago now, whenever it was.

387
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:41,000
But the problem is to upgrade it to the GPU I need, I would need to replace the power

388
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,840
supply, which is not impossible.

389
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:44,840
Right in a Thaleo.

390
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:46,600
That's like very doable.

391
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:49,720
But that's just something I'm like, do I really want to do that?

392
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:50,720
Well, now it's a project.

393
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:51,720
It's not.

394
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:53,040
You could do it, but it's a project now.

395
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:55,480
It's already running our legacy version of our software.

396
00:19:55,480 --> 00:20:00,760
So it's like, you know, it wouldn't hurt to have to, especially because I kind of got

397
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:04,360
my landlord at the office in Plant City to pick up the power bill.

398
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:08,360
He's going to regret that.

399
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:09,360
Mining time.

400
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:10,360
I can't.

401
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:11,360
I can't.

402
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,720
It's a shame about Dogecoin, by the way.

403
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:15,680
Man, crypto in general is just taking it.

404
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:16,680
Thank you.

405
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:17,680
Thanks, Elon.

406
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:18,680
Thanks, buddy.

407
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:19,680
Thanks.

408
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:20,680
That was that was nice.

409
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:21,680
But I don't know.

410
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:26,360
Anyway, let's talk about better things such as Linode.

411
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:27,920
Linode.com slash coder.

412
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:31,880
Go there to get one hundred dollars in credit for 60 days on your new account and you support

413
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:32,880
the show.

414
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,220
Go see why they are hosting provider.

415
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:36,880
We use Linode for everything we deploy now.

416
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:39,280
I have been for the last couple of years.

417
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:44,240
Linode's infrastructure is solid, it's flexible and you can focus on your project, not the

418
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:48,540
infrastructure details that you don't really have time to worry about anyways.

419
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:51,680
And they have eleven data centers to choose from and every service level is backed by

420
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:52,680
the best.

421
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:56,240
I mean, really, guys, the best customer service in the business.

422
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,040
I love their dedication to that.

423
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:00,360
You know, Linode started way back in 2003.

424
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:02,340
I like to mention that because it matters.

425
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:03,680
It's not just a trivial fact.

426
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:07,560
That's before AWS, before Azure, before the quote unquote big clouds.

427
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:10,880
They knew what they were doing back then and they focused on one thing and they just got

428
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,160
it right.

429
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:15,440
Couple of months ago, I set up a sync thing server just to make life easier.

430
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,360
It's a five dollar Linode.

431
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:22,220
Five dollars and it runs sync thing and I also use it as an SSH jump host.

432
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:26,920
It's nice knowing that I have something out in the cloud to help me manage my sync thing

433
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:27,920
instance.

434
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:30,600
It just moves data around faster.

435
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:35,020
They got crazy fast systems, crazy fast networks, and I use Linode for everything from the back

436
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:40,160
end for download services or encoding services for the podcast, simple things like moving

437
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:42,160
data around and jump hosts.

438
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:46,080
I love the fact that they have cloud firewalls, they have node balancers, and they have one

439
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:49,460
click application deployments if you just want to get something up and going quick.

440
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:54,560
I tend to build from scratch because I want like a minimum viable box, right?

441
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:57,240
And they have some of those for you to one click deploy as well.

442
00:21:57,240 --> 00:22:01,680
And that's the great thing is the range of options for pros or beginners is all there

443
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:05,320
with Linode and they make it all very accessible with their dashboard.

444
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:07,580
So head over to linode.com slash coder.

445
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:10,560
Get that $100 in credit and try it out.

446
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:11,560
Go build a system.

447
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:16,320
Perhaps it could be the perfect place for your next application or a great way to learn.

448
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:19,380
There's a lot of ways to host something and a lot of various companies that will do it

449
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:20,600
for you.

450
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:29,800
Go see why we always choose Linode over and over linode.com slash coder.

451
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:36,440
So last week, Microsoft build went down and I went to just read the reviews and the press

452
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:40,640
and the take on it, and it was so fricking negative.

453
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:44,640
I have never seen this much of hate for a build event.

454
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:48,200
So I wanted to get your take on it because I'm betting you loved it.

455
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:51,680
I mean, I sort of think it was the best Linux conference ever.

456
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:52,680
Oh, wow.

457
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:53,680
Oh, wow.

458
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:55,800
You know, maybe you're right.

459
00:22:55,800 --> 00:23:00,520
You know what's wild is so, of course, you know, Saatchi Nadella, he gets up there during

460
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:02,280
such a keynote.

461
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:07,600
He talked about Linux more than he talked about Windows as pandemic as this is.

462
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:12,820
He was timed and the entirety that he spent in the keynote talking about Windows was one

463
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:14,360
minute and five seconds.

464
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:17,400
And I grabbed it for you because I really want to talk about what he says on the other

465
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:18,400
side.

466
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:22,260
Across all the opportunities I've highlighted today, Windows is implicit.

467
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:24,240
It's never been more important.

468
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:29,940
Windows 10 is used by more than one point three billion people to work, learn, connect

469
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:35,680
and play, and it all starts with Windows as a dev box.

470
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:39,720
Windows brings together all your developer and collaboration tools in one place.

471
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:44,640
It lets you choose the hardware you want, works with Linux and Windows environments

472
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:47,780
as one and has a modern terminal.

473
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:54,360
And soon we will share one of the most significant updates of Windows of the past decade to unlock

474
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:57,480
greater economic opportunity for developers and creators.

475
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:01,440
I've been self hosting it over the past several months and I'm incredibly excited about the

476
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,640
next generation of Windows.

477
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:05,800
Our promise to you is this.

478
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:10,960
We will create more opportunity for every Windows developer today and welcome every

479
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:17,280
creator who is looking for the most innovative, new, open platform to build and distribute

480
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:19,240
and monetize applications.

481
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:22,400
We look forward to sharing more very soon.

482
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:25,380
Unlock greater economic opportunity for developers.

483
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:31,040
He said that once and then he said again later, we will create more opportunity for every

484
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:32,600
Windows developer today.

485
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:34,680
OK, I have so much here.

486
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:37,000
Do you want me to start with the negative or the positive?

487
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Maybe we start with the negative and we'll end it on, you know, nice little ended on

488
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
a high note thing.

489
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:45,280
If I was a pure dot net client side developer, I would be afraid.

490
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:50,840
I would be very afraid because all this Maui stuff, this dot net six stuff like I've been

491
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:54,600
looking into it and I listened to the sessions.

492
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:58,920
This sounds an awful lot like the dream of Metro that never happened, right?

493
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:04,120
Like dot net is going to be a high level platform to cross all the all the clients.

494
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:08,240
And also there's a great post and I wish I had put in the show notes and I'll I'll shoot

495
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:13,360
it to you in slack later from the you know, Rufus, the ISO flashing application.

496
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:14,360
Sure.

497
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:17,600
Yeah, there is a GitHub issue where someone was kind of giving him a rough time about

498
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:22,660
not making it a UWP app and he goes into great detail about why he can't and as someone who

499
00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:28,640
routinely ships UWP to clients because they want it, there are limitations in UWP.

500
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:33,920
It's not nearly as strict as iPad OS or here's a dirty secret kids.

501
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:39,080
It's just iOS or, you know, you know, iOS in general.

502
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:42,480
But it has some some constraints.

503
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:46,440
It's getting to the point of I'll give you a perfect example that you have in the show

504
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:47,440
notes.

505
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:48,440
Webview two.

506
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:51,600
Do you know what the difference between Webview two and the regular Webview is?

507
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:52,800
No, I don't think so.

508
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:59,720
OK, I will tell you one is backed by Chromium, but not available in most modern browsers.

509
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:08,160
And one is backed by I believe it's old I.E. Oh, oh, and unless you're on a very specific

510
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:12,960
version called the Win UI three, as you have in the notes, you cannot use Webview two.

511
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:17,400
And this literally bit me in the ass about a week and a half ago, right after we recorded

512
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:18,400
last week's show.

513
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:19,400
Oh, really?

514
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:24,440
Yeah, when I thought I was operating, I had to do an embedded Webview in a it's a it's

515
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:26,360
a Windows app, but it's like a tablet kiosk thing.

516
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:28,400
So like nobody knows it's Windows.

517
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,840
But I'm like, son of a bitch, why doesn't this work?

518
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:34,960
And the answer was because that particular JavaScript feature I was the DOM feature I

519
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:38,800
was trying to access did not work in I.E., but the version of Windows they were running

520
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:44,380
and the SDK I was hitting was not Webview two, even though I thought it was so boy,

521
00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:50,160
that feels just like a classic Microsoft Windows, like Jerry versus the Microsoft Java runtime

522
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:51,760
like the whole thing all over again.

523
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:52,760
Oh, hang on.

524
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:53,760
I'm still swinging here.

525
00:26:53,760 --> 00:27:04,560
So Project Reunion, one great name that says we forked up basically UWP, WPF, Winforms,

526
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:10,160
Xamarin or as Chris calls it, Xamarin, are all going to come together into some sort

527
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:12,960
of strange Voltron of hell.

528
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:13,960
Finally.

529
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:16,720
So this is basically admitting defeat, right?

530
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,600
This is we have too many objectives.

531
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:24,440
Oh, and let's not forget my hero, Steven Sanofsky, who, by the way, I will die on this hill,

532
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:31,760
was correct in his assertion that C++ development on Windows is the right way to do it.

533
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:35,720
Send your hitmail to Alan at Jupiter Broadcasting Dotcom.

534
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:40,960
And for all their love, for all their selling you on this, can we call it crap?

535
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:41,960
Can we do that now?

536
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:42,960
I think so.

537
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,480
We're making a good case why it is crap.

538
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:49,920
For all the selling on this crap that hasn't worked since some moron lost $40,000 on Windows

539
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:50,920
phone.

540
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:51,920
Don't know who that could be.

541
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:52,920
I mean, I don't know.

542
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:53,920
What did they announce right afterwards?

543
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:57,120
Linux gooey apps on WSL.

544
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:00,160
How do you feel, client side Windows developers?

545
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:01,160
How does that feel?

546
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:02,160
Does it hurt?

547
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:03,400
Did you cry a little?

548
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:05,620
It seems people did not like it very much.

549
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:08,520
People were not very happy about that.

550
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:11,240
All for odds, less than thrilled.

551
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:13,360
Yeah, hmm.

552
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:14,880
I mean, they're promising, though.

553
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:19,320
They're promising a very, very positive and potentially lucrative future, though, now

554
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:21,720
that they got all the rest figured out and they got everything dialed in.

555
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:26,840
Now the next version of Windows 10 or whatever is going to be called is, you know, Windows

556
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:27,840
Sun Valley.

557
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:29,320
It's going to be rocking for developers.

558
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:31,240
I mean, what do you suppose he's inferring?

559
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:34,600
I think what they're going for, right, is and I've had some good experience, too, because

560
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:38,480
I mean, shout out to the folks that I think they call themselves WhiteFounder now, but

561
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:44,880
the Penguin WSL distro for Windows 10, like Windows as a host OS for your development

562
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:48,360
box is actually kind of good now.

563
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:55,640
I mean, it's not pop OS good or, you know, I mean, nothing is M1 good, so sorry, Alexi.

564
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:57,480
But I think that's what he means.

565
00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:02,320
But honestly, you're going to be deploying to Linux because it's a superior server operating

566
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:05,360
system and Windows licenses are a waste of time on the server.

567
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:06,360
True, true.

568
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:09,000
Oh, and let's not talk about that at all.

569
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:13,960
Windows 10 was released July 29th, 2015, and they have a Windows focused event coming up

570
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:19,760
this year in June where they are supposedly going to reveal more of this new overhauled

571
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:26,320
Windows with, I guess, some some visual updates that are taking elements from the now defunct

572
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:31,240
Windows 10 X and going to integrate it into the whatever the next version of Windows is.

573
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:37,200
Satya says it'll be the biggest update to Windows in a decade, and no one cares, really,

574
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:42,080
you know, it's like, OK, I'm sorry, a butterfly flew by and I forgot what you said.

575
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:43,080
I know.

576
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:44,080
I wonder.

577
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:45,080
I wonder what they could do.

578
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:49,640
I mean, he really laid it on thick that it's going to be about making developers and creators

579
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:53,200
that use those two two things in one sentence.

580
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:57,240
Developers and creators are going to be able to make more money on Windows is basically

581
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:58,240
what it sounds like.

582
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:00,600
I don't know about that.

583
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:01,880
I guess we will see.

584
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:06,380
Also, they've released their I guess they will be releasing a developer kit.

585
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:07,380
It's coming this summer.

586
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:11,720
I think there's a few people that have it in beta, a ARM developer kit for Windows,

587
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:16,600
which is it looks like a new take on doing Windows on ARM that may actually work this

588
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:17,600
time.

589
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,060
But I even hesitate to even say that.

590
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:21,480
But it's it's a Snapdragon developer kit.

591
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:23,480
So it's coming from Sam or Qualcomm.

592
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:27,640
It's coming with a Qualcomm processor in it, not Samsung Qualcomm processor in it.

593
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:34,240
And it'll be the you know, the platform that people will use for the next version of Windows

594
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,400
on ARM.

595
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:42,360
I I try to I try to be interested, but I just I guess I just I feel like this this has shipped

596
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:47,120
like it seems like Windows is clearly the x86 general computing platform for desktop

597
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:48,120
and

598
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:49,120
All right.

599
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:52,200
So in certain spaces, this is kind of a thing.

600
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:54,120
I was a little excited about the Qualcomm.

601
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:55,600
Oh, is it OK now?

602
00:30:55,600 --> 00:31:00,480
But there's very specific spaces and where I can use like an embedded Linux or like it

603
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:02,080
used to be Debian embedded.

604
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:06,960
Now actually folks at least that I'm that hire me are moving on to Ubuntu because canonicals

605
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:09,740
like fork the desktop.

606
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:10,960
How about the enterprise?

607
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:12,800
And that seems to be going well for them.

608
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:16,520
So business and notice I'm censoring myself all the good place.

609
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:21,320
Drew actually took me to the woodshed and he had his his fraternity paddle.

610
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:27,160
So wow, you know, he must have if he did that, if he took time out of moving, you know, most

611
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:28,160
of it.

612
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:30,200
Well, he put the holes in it to make it really aerodynamic.

613
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:32,200
You got to get a nice thing.

614
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:34,600
It was almost like a million like Thor was sending me.

615
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:37,980
So yeah, he's got a strong, you know, he's got strong forearms, you know, you wouldn't

616
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:38,980
expect it.

617
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:40,340
But he's got those Nordic genes, too.

618
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:43,500
So I feel like they're I don't know, like, is he the last son of Asgard?

619
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:47,180
I'm not saying that, but I think people in the IRC should start talking about that.

620
00:31:47,180 --> 00:31:49,920
So I know we wonder, I know we do.

621
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:54,660
Apple wonders if Microsoft is using Epic in this legal battle.

622
00:31:54,660 --> 00:31:59,720
This is a little juicy nugget that came out in a filing that Apple made asking the judge

623
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:06,720
to make, quote, an adverse credibility finding against Lori Wright, an Xbox executive in

624
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:07,720
there.

625
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:09,020
Apple kind of lays it all out.

626
00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:13,440
It's essentially this thing saying you got to disqualify this witness because they have

627
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:19,760
a axe to grind and they claim that a reasonable observer might wonder whether Epic is serving

628
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:24,300
as a stalking horse for Microsoft, Microsoft.

629
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:25,780
This is a quote from Apple.

630
00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:30,740
Microsoft shield itself from meaningful discovery in this litigation by not appearing as a party

631
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:33,640
or sending a corporate representative to testify.

632
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:39,740
But Apple claims as many witnesses associated with Microsoft testified as did witnesses

633
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:40,900
associated with Epic.

634
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:48,080
In other words, nearly as many Microsoft employees testified as actual Epic employees testified.

635
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:53,380
And Apple complains that Microsoft intentionally withheld internal communications and discussions

636
00:32:53,380 --> 00:32:56,820
with Epic that were requested for the trial.

637
00:32:56,820 --> 00:33:00,740
And Apple says such internal communications were particularly relevant in light of Microsoft's

638
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:05,620
relationship with at least five epic witnesses and the potential that Microsoft is using

639
00:33:05,620 --> 00:33:13,540
Epic as a proxy plaintiff in litigation that it refuses to prosecute in its own name.

640
00:33:13,540 --> 00:33:14,940
They're claiming proxy war.

641
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:15,940
Yeah.

642
00:33:15,940 --> 00:33:16,940
We're in Vietnam again.

643
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:17,940
Isn't this wild?

644
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:18,940
Yeah.

645
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:19,940
Does it kind of make sense?

646
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:20,940
I don't know.

647
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:21,940
I mean, not really.

648
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:24,740
Apple is a pretty sober company when it comes to this legal stuff.

649
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:28,020
I don't I mean, I don't think they just randomly make this up.

650
00:33:28,020 --> 00:33:29,020
All right.

651
00:33:29,020 --> 00:33:30,020
Then what does Microsoft gain?

652
00:33:30,020 --> 00:33:32,300
Well, the office subscriptions on iOS.

653
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:34,620
I mean, the obvious thing, of course.

654
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:35,620
Well, yeah.

655
00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:39,960
And when you look at it from the from the view of it was like Xbox employees that were

656
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:47,220
testifying, maybe Microsoft sees the iOS platform as taking, you know, playtime away from the

657
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:48,220
Xbox.

658
00:33:48,220 --> 00:33:50,220
I'm not sure.

659
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:55,160
Maybe they feel like they have to break Apple's monopoly on on, you know, the App Store payment

660
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:58,380
system in order to bring their own services and be competitive.

661
00:33:58,380 --> 00:34:04,380
I mean, X Cloud would be like the obvious answer, but I don't know, man.

662
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:07,260
Doesn't it seem like a bit much to you?

663
00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:08,260
I don't know.

664
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:09,260
I don't know.

665
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:11,420
I mean, yes.

666
00:34:11,420 --> 00:34:16,220
But the fact that so many Microsoft employees did testify and there was some other Microsoft

667
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:20,020
connections that came out earlier that kind of were a little iffy.

668
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:22,200
It does make one wonder.

669
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:26,380
It kind of made me think if this is true, it's like the bad old Microsoft of days yore

670
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:27,380
that is back.

671
00:34:27,380 --> 00:34:31,300
But doing it on the DL, you know, that's what it suggests to me.

672
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:32,300
If it's true.

673
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:33,840
To what end?

674
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:37,340
Like X Cloud makes just a ton of sense to me.

675
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:39,900
Yeah, but I don't know.

676
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:45,080
I mean, I try to follow the business side of these companies and granted as much as

677
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:50,420
people say I'm a shill because I like WSL, I I'm not I don't follow Microsoft quite

678
00:34:50,420 --> 00:34:51,420
that closely.

679
00:34:51,420 --> 00:34:57,200
But my impression is that like it's all about Azure and like Xbox is just not like they're

680
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:59,020
not going to war over Xbox.

681
00:34:59,020 --> 00:35:01,660
I'm sorry, but it's I wouldn't think so.

682
00:35:01,660 --> 00:35:05,740
Then again, you know, if Apple acts like a vacuum in the tech space, sucking all the

683
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:08,860
air out of the room, maybe Microsoft feels like they got to take them down a notch or

684
00:35:08,860 --> 00:35:11,380
two to make some money in a segment.

685
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:14,460
But I would like anybody to take them down a notch or two.

686
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:17,700
Like, Chris, can we just like fly Lady Joops into there?

687
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:22,500
The funny thing about this epic trial, everybody, everybody talked about what a rock star team

688
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:24,460
the epic lawyers were.

689
00:35:24,460 --> 00:35:26,220
And so I tuned in a couple of times.

690
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:27,460
They got rolled.

691
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:29,580
They were clowns, man.

692
00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:32,940
They said like they sounded unprofessional.

693
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:37,880
They even sometimes like didn't appropriately address the judge and got a correction, like

694
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:39,820
basic court decorum stuff.

695
00:35:39,820 --> 00:35:41,900
And then they didn't seem very organized.

696
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:46,220
And then at the very beginning of the trial, they tried to pull all these crazy delay tactics

697
00:35:46,220 --> 00:35:50,020
and they tried to make all of these extra exceptions because of covid that basically

698
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:54,900
Apple's legal team just argued were just B.S. and the judge agreed.

699
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:56,420
And it was pathetic.

700
00:35:56,420 --> 00:35:57,900
And everybody's talking about a rock star team.

701
00:35:57,900 --> 00:35:58,900
They are.

702
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:02,460
And so I wonder the only thing I could think of is like, what does Microsoft have to lose

703
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:03,460
here?

704
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:04,460
Right.

705
00:36:04,460 --> 00:36:07,500
Like they they give the insurgents a little bit of ammo and communication utilities and

706
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:09,420
say, go on, go fight the empire.

707
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:12,540
But I would I would definitely suggest a different term than insurgents.

708
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:15,820
But, OK, you just keep rolling the way you know what I mean?

709
00:36:15,820 --> 00:36:19,500
Like, you know what I'm saying, though, it's like maybe to them it's such a low cost to

710
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:24,260
just, you know, send off a few employees and maybe give them a little legal advice or dedicate

711
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:26,800
a few lawyers of Microsoft's team to them.

712
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:30,780
It's such a small cost to help them go up against the big empire that's sucking all

713
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:32,780
of the money out of the system.

714
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:37,500
It's possible it's possible or it's a it's a clever legal legal trick by Apple's team

715
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:41,100
to just like, I don't know, just make everybody look somewhere else.

716
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:43,100
One of those seems a lot more likely than the others.

717
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:49,940
But I think we're because we're dangerously close to rolling into my my WBC predictions

718
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:54,940
because it's closely related, but oh.

719
00:36:54,940 --> 00:36:59,400

742
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:23,000
So WWDC is next week.

743
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,320
It's on Monday.

744
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:27,820
The keynote will be at 10 a.m. Pacific time, Monday, June 7th.

745
00:38:27,820 --> 00:38:31,380
And I am planning to do a mystery science leader style watch along where I give light

746
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:32,380
commentary.

747
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:34,700
I may or may not do that.

748
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:35,700
Sometimes it doesn't work out.

749
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:38,540
But I'm right now I'm planning to JBLive.TV to do that Monday at 10 a.m.

750
00:38:38,540 --> 00:38:39,540
Pacific.

751
00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:40,540
All right.

752
00:38:40,540 --> 00:38:44,060
So we know we're going to get we know we know we're going to get software updates.

753
00:38:44,060 --> 00:38:46,540
We're going to get Apple boasting about how incredible they are.

754
00:38:46,540 --> 00:38:50,500
But so I'm wondering if you thought of anything or you expect anything that we haven't really,

755
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:53,940
you know, seen out there floating around or what is not just common to expect from an

756
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:55,100
event like this?

757
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:56,100
Not to flip the script on you.

758
00:38:56,100 --> 00:39:00,420
I want to say what I wrote a whole blog post on Dominic M.com and I haven't blogged in

759
00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:01,580
some time.

760
00:39:01,580 --> 00:39:03,620
I'm getting back to the real world now.

761
00:39:03,620 --> 00:39:06,180
And I have a sexy new design on my website, by the way.

762
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:07,180
So check it out.

763
00:39:07,180 --> 00:39:08,180
Oh, I'm going to go check it out.

764
00:39:08,180 --> 00:39:10,260
It's very the Mad Botter branded.

765
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:12,980
So I'm going to say what we're not going to get.

766
00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:16,980
I don't think we're getting AR glasses, AR meaning augmented reality for folks who aren't

767
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:17,980
in the know.

768
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:18,980
All right.

769
00:39:18,980 --> 00:39:19,980
I'm with you on this.

770
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:25,780
We're not getting major concessions on developer freedom in terms of, you know, not having

771
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:31,580
to be approved by Apple, Apple's cut updates, trials, things like that.

772
00:39:31,580 --> 00:39:33,420
I think it's basic.

773
00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:36,340
There might be like some small gesture, but we're not getting anything.

774
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:37,580
And I think that's all table stakes.

775
00:39:37,580 --> 00:39:41,500
And unless Chris, unless you think I'm crazy, I think we should just jump away from that.

776
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:45,720
I mean, I think it's so awkward if they don't address some of this stuff that's come out

777
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:48,260
around this space, especially during the epic trial.

778
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:49,260
OK.

779
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:50,500
So what do you think they would do then?

780
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:55,460
I wonder if they would if they don't go all in on talking about how much money they make

781
00:39:55,460 --> 00:39:58,940
for developers and the amount of new developers they've created.

782
00:39:58,940 --> 00:40:00,580
Well, they do that every year.

783
00:40:00,580 --> 00:40:04,380
I'm talking about something actionable, like a change in policy.

784
00:40:04,380 --> 00:40:05,820
I guess I kind of agree.

785
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:09,420
I could I could I'm thinking about the commentary afterwards and I could see people going, oh,

786
00:40:09,420 --> 00:40:11,660
they didn't even they didn't even address it.

787
00:40:11,660 --> 00:40:12,660
They're so arrogant.

788
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:13,900
They didn't even touch on it.

789
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:14,900
Like I could see that.

790
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:16,100
So I think I'm with you.

791
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:17,720
They're not even going to make a concession.

792
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:20,460
Like even though they should, it's like, you know, they're not going to.

793
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:23,460
They're not going to introduce sideloading and they're not going to introduce alternative

794
00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:24,460
payments.

795
00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:25,880
That's not going to happen.

796
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:32,340
So my longest shot bet as a concession to developers is going to be iPad, OS, which

797
00:40:32,340 --> 00:40:34,460
I mean, I hate that they call it iPad.

798
00:40:34,460 --> 00:40:40,580
It's it's goddammit, it's iOS interprocess enablement, which is my kind of PC way of

799
00:40:40,580 --> 00:40:47,100
saying basically, you know, just like we have in Unix and Windows and basically everything

800
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:51,380
interprocess communications, i.e. apps can talk to each other in an unfettered way at

801
00:40:51,380 --> 00:40:52,380
the developer level.

802
00:40:52,380 --> 00:40:53,460
Oh, that'd be good.

803
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:57,980
Not using crazy ass URL schemes, which I know they have and someone will write in.

804
00:40:57,980 --> 00:41:04,380
I feel like this is my longest shot prediction because it does enable a certain kind of,

805
00:41:04,380 --> 00:41:08,820
you know, I'm Microsoft and I have this suite of apps and they all talk to each other directly

806
00:41:08,820 --> 00:41:10,820
rather than through a server.

807
00:41:10,820 --> 00:41:12,400
But that would be awesome for users.

808
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:18,860
That would definitely enable a bunch of, quote, you know, production power user workflows.

809
00:41:18,860 --> 00:41:20,100
They've got to do something here.

810
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:22,140
They've got to because of the new iPad Pro hardware.

811
00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:27,420
If they do something here and mark it down, people who are going to troll me, I will do

812
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:32,660
an iPad app if they do this, because this is one of the main things holding me back.

813
00:41:32,660 --> 00:41:35,740
And it's one of the main things holding back the purchase of a more powerful iPad.

814
00:41:35,740 --> 00:41:42,060
I have a 2018 iPad Pro and I have I mean, I'm sure an M1 with a fancy ass screen.

815
00:41:42,060 --> 00:41:43,060
Sure.

816
00:41:43,060 --> 00:41:44,060
I ordered one of those.

817
00:41:44,060 --> 00:41:46,180
I should have it in a few weeks and I will be reviewing.

818
00:41:46,180 --> 00:41:47,620
Yeah, the new iPad Pro.

819
00:41:47,620 --> 00:41:48,620
I ordered the 11 inch.

820
00:41:48,620 --> 00:41:52,260
Yeah, I mean, you've got to be assuming that because I even I even read, although I don't

821
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:55,380
know if it's true because I only read it from one source, that iOS can even take advantage

822
00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:57,780
of 16 gigs of RAM that they're shipping these things.

823
00:41:57,780 --> 00:42:02,620
If you get the depending on how you configure it with 16 gigs of RAM, that iOS only addresses

824
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:03,620
like I guess less than that.

825
00:42:03,620 --> 00:42:07,700
I don't know if it's true or not, but if these kinds of limitations are there, but like the

826
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:12,780
inner process communication and memory limitations, it's just obvious they're going to do something

827
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:13,780
with it.

828
00:42:13,780 --> 00:42:15,180
But what and will it be enough?

829
00:42:15,180 --> 00:42:16,180
That's really the question.

830
00:42:16,180 --> 00:42:17,180
All right.

831
00:42:17,180 --> 00:42:18,180
My position.

832
00:42:18,180 --> 00:42:21,260
I mean, we've been doing these shows since never mind.

833
00:42:21,260 --> 00:42:23,580
We're going to feel old for a while.

834
00:42:23,580 --> 00:42:24,580
Yeah.

835
00:42:24,580 --> 00:42:27,980
And my whole thing about iPad has always been it is not a hardware limitation.

836
00:42:27,980 --> 00:42:30,860
It's a policy and software limitation.

837
00:42:30,860 --> 00:42:35,700
But this year, I don't know, with the epic trial, with just the massive amount of power

838
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:40,580
they're putting in these iPads now, I did buy one on spec thinking, damn it, I want

839
00:42:40,580 --> 00:42:41,580
my Star Trek tablet.

840
00:42:41,580 --> 00:42:43,580
That's all I want.

841
00:42:43,580 --> 00:42:44,580
Yeah.

842
00:42:44,580 --> 00:42:45,580
Yeah.

843
00:42:45,580 --> 00:42:46,580
Yeah.

844
00:42:46,580 --> 00:42:51,660
I mean, if they made it powerful enough, I if anything would happen to my 2018 iPad

845
00:42:51,660 --> 00:42:52,700
Pro, I would replace it.

846
00:42:52,700 --> 00:42:54,860
And I admit it as a happy Linux user.

847
00:42:54,860 --> 00:42:58,580
I admit that I use the shit out of my iPad Pro when I'm traveling.

848
00:42:58,580 --> 00:43:03,180
It is such a killer mobile work machine and I have used it every single day of this trip.

849
00:43:03,180 --> 00:43:04,540
And it's a monster.

850
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:08,500
And also now over time, finally, I've got a couple of games on the thing that I actually

851
00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:09,540
enjoy, too.

852
00:43:09,540 --> 00:43:13,160
So for me, it is one of my best productivity machines.

853
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:14,160
It's always reliable.

854
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:15,160
It's always fast.

855
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:18,300
It has its own dedicated Internet connection, which is great sometimes like I'm using it

856
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:19,700
right now.

857
00:43:19,700 --> 00:43:23,780
I am using it right now as I I have a touch screen mixer control.

858
00:43:23,780 --> 00:43:29,780
I am I am using wire guard on the iPad to connect back to the Jupiter Broadcasting Studio

859
00:43:29,780 --> 00:43:34,580
in Seattle, and I am physically moving the sliders on the mixer using a touch screen

860
00:43:34,580 --> 00:43:35,860
control on my iPad.

861
00:43:35,860 --> 00:43:39,420
And I just have it here on a stand in front of me that's above my local mixer.

862
00:43:39,420 --> 00:43:43,260
So I have the remote studio mixer on my screen and I have my local mixer.

863
00:43:43,260 --> 00:43:45,400
And it's it's great for that kind of stuff.

864
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:48,140
And I don't want a machine there because I need something that fits in a little stupid

865
00:43:48,140 --> 00:43:49,140
stand and it's silent.

866
00:43:49,140 --> 00:43:53,620
And so, you know, they're making a good tool, but it's just not good enough yet.

867
00:43:53,620 --> 00:43:56,060
So, God, man, I mean, it's a long shot.

868
00:43:56,060 --> 00:44:00,860
What you're talking about, they'd essentially have to create some sort of messaging bus

869
00:44:00,860 --> 00:44:05,940
that would be some kind of blessed messaging system that Apple allows.

870
00:44:05,940 --> 00:44:10,240
And I bet it even then be like a limited set of what you could actually use this bus for.

871
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:12,580
But it's just BSD under the hoods, man.

872
00:44:12,580 --> 00:44:16,060
This already exists like they just have to not block it.

873
00:44:16,060 --> 00:44:17,060
I know.

874
00:44:17,060 --> 00:44:19,300
So I'm so that was my long shot.

875
00:44:19,300 --> 00:44:21,460
My easy shot is Swift concurrency.

876
00:44:21,460 --> 00:44:24,760
Now it's easy because I follow Swift evolution.

877
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:27,380
And I'm not going to go too deep into this because I know our audience doesn't really

878
00:44:27,380 --> 00:44:28,780
give a crap about Swift.

879
00:44:28,780 --> 00:44:32,500
And frankly, you shouldn't because Objective C is in every way a better language.

880
00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:36,140
And if you're too stupid to understand how to handle memory, you deserve not to be a

881
00:44:36,140 --> 00:44:37,140
programmer.

882
00:44:37,140 --> 00:44:38,140
So you're burned.

883
00:44:38,140 --> 00:44:42,260
Basically, it simplifies dealing with concurrency slash we used to call it threading in the

884
00:44:42,260 --> 00:44:43,260
battle days.

885
00:44:43,260 --> 00:44:45,340
But we don't call it that anymore because reasons.

886
00:44:45,340 --> 00:44:47,900
All right, moving on.

887
00:44:47,900 --> 00:44:53,180
Swift UI is greater than combine and by this I am stealing a little bit from Casey List.

888
00:44:53,180 --> 00:44:54,980
I think combine is in trouble.

889
00:44:54,980 --> 00:45:02,820
I you know, if you follow the releases over the last year in 2020 when combine was released

890
00:45:02,820 --> 00:45:08,220
in 2019, Swift UI is definitely the favored child.

891
00:45:08,220 --> 00:45:10,300
And yes, yeah, I agree.

892
00:45:10,300 --> 00:45:17,320
And I understand that combine does work with Swift UI some, but that's not necessary.

893
00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:23,900
If I was a pure iOS developer and I'm going to talk about that in a minute, I would not

894
00:45:23,900 --> 00:45:25,660
be betting on combine right now.

895
00:45:25,660 --> 00:45:27,940
I would be Swift UI all the way.

896
00:45:27,940 --> 00:45:29,500
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

897
00:45:29,500 --> 00:45:30,500
I think you're right.

898
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:33,980
And also, I know this sounds silly, especially after what you just said about Swift.

899
00:45:33,980 --> 00:45:38,720
But I think when the Internet sees and developers that are coming into the ecosystem see Swift

900
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:42,500
attached to something, they're just going to be that that branding alone is what's going

901
00:45:42,500 --> 00:45:43,500
to draw them.

902
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:44,500
Just branding.

903
00:45:44,500 --> 00:45:46,060
I know it seems silly, but that works.

904
00:45:46,060 --> 00:45:50,340
Yeah, it's also Swift UI is like very, very webby.

905
00:45:50,340 --> 00:45:52,580
No, I don't mean that as an insult.

906
00:45:52,580 --> 00:45:57,220
If you're familiar at all with like web development stuff, it kind of makes more sense.

907
00:45:57,220 --> 00:46:02,980
Now combine, if you're familiar with React, Reactive, whatever, ReactJS, Reactive, CocoRx,

908
00:46:02,980 --> 00:46:04,940
whatever the hell they call it, fine.

909
00:46:04,940 --> 00:46:09,260
But there are more people who are used to like web development, like regular sane web

910
00:46:09,260 --> 00:46:12,800
development than there are with reactive programming, right?

911
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:16,260
My opinions on reactive programming are well documented on this program.

912
00:46:16,260 --> 00:46:19,340
So we don't need to go into that.

913
00:46:19,340 --> 00:46:22,340
I think your biggest bet here is the iPad stuff.

914
00:46:22,340 --> 00:46:24,040
I think you're right, though.

915
00:46:24,040 --> 00:46:28,680
But do you think this is going to with the with Swift UI and sort of this this obvious

916
00:46:28,680 --> 00:46:33,260
favorite child thing, there's no material result up on stage from Apple.

917
00:46:33,260 --> 00:46:35,940
It just sort of it just sort of becomes the way it is.

918
00:46:35,940 --> 00:46:38,620
I'm going to smooth out some of the rough edges on Swift UI.

919
00:46:38,620 --> 00:46:43,100
I mean, for me, like I have a weird perspective on this, right, because for me, the question

920
00:46:43,100 --> 00:46:49,100
is, is it worth it this summer to spend my time pounding out amongst all the client work

921
00:46:49,100 --> 00:46:53,580
I have to do a native iPad or iOS app?

922
00:46:53,580 --> 00:46:59,860
And that requires something, right, some sort of new API that I think I have a unique take

923
00:46:59,860 --> 00:47:00,860
on.

924
00:47:00,860 --> 00:47:01,860
Right.

925
00:47:01,860 --> 00:47:04,580
Some something new that you could take advantage of that wasn't available before that would

926
00:47:04,580 --> 00:47:07,620
be interesting and compelling to customers.

927
00:47:07,620 --> 00:47:08,620
Right.

928
00:47:08,620 --> 00:47:12,460
That that warrants the risk and the time and the possibility of Apple just saying no, right?

929
00:47:12,460 --> 00:47:15,100
Like, I don't really care if there's going to be new Mac pros.

930
00:47:15,100 --> 00:47:16,100
I don't know.

931
00:47:16,100 --> 00:47:17,100
I think that's all fine.

932
00:47:17,100 --> 00:47:18,100
Really?

933
00:47:18,100 --> 00:47:19,100
I was wondering.

934
00:47:19,100 --> 00:47:21,620
Yeah, it seems like if not in June, then in the fall.

935
00:47:21,620 --> 00:47:22,620
Right.

936
00:47:22,620 --> 00:47:23,620
It's going to happen.

937
00:47:23,620 --> 00:47:24,620
Do you know what I do care about, though?

938
00:47:24,620 --> 00:47:25,620
Hmm.

939
00:47:25,620 --> 00:47:26,620
What's that?

940
00:47:26,620 --> 00:47:29,420
A configurable keyboard.

941
00:47:29,420 --> 00:47:30,820
System Seventy six dot com.

942
00:47:30,820 --> 00:47:33,340
The new launch keyboard is here.

943
00:47:33,340 --> 00:47:36,180
Go design and buy yours today.

944
00:47:36,180 --> 00:47:37,760
System Seventy six dot com.

945
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:42,900
The launch configurable keyboard is engineered to be comfortable, fully customizable and

946
00:47:42,900 --> 00:47:45,820
make your workflow even more efficient.

947
00:47:45,820 --> 00:47:50,980
It has a huge amount of customization options to make it flexible to your needs.

948
00:47:50,980 --> 00:47:53,780
This is the Cadillac of keyboards.

949
00:47:53,780 --> 00:47:55,460
You've wanted something nice in your life.

950
00:47:55,460 --> 00:47:58,900
And let's be honest, you got to touch your keyboard all the time.

951
00:47:58,900 --> 00:48:02,420
It's something you're physically interacting with and it's something you're looking at

952
00:48:02,420 --> 00:48:03,420
all the time.

953
00:48:03,420 --> 00:48:07,180
And putting something special on that desk is going to make all of the difference.

954
00:48:07,180 --> 00:48:11,340
And then, of course, you're taking control back into your hands with the launch keyboard.

955
00:48:11,340 --> 00:48:15,760
You can configure multiple layers to your liking and the launch has three cap sizes

956
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:18,420
that give you a lot of configuration options.

957
00:48:18,420 --> 00:48:23,260
I went for the slightly quieter key caps on my keyboard, which is going to be arriving

958
00:48:23,260 --> 00:48:25,620
soon and I can't wait to tell you guys about it.

959
00:48:25,620 --> 00:48:29,760
But one of the things I'm looking forward to do with my launch once I get it is use

960
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:34,340
it as an editing tool to take advantage of some of the layers and they have this beautiful

961
00:48:34,340 --> 00:48:38,280
piece of software they've designed that allows you to adjust the hardware functions.

962
00:48:38,280 --> 00:48:42,620
And then it saves that back to the keyboard and you can then go plug in another machine

963
00:48:42,620 --> 00:48:46,100
and all that stuff you set up via software is in the keyboard firmware.

964
00:48:46,100 --> 00:48:47,860
I love that.

965
00:48:47,860 --> 00:48:53,680
And in addition to just being a fantastic keyboard, it's also a super fast USB hub with

966
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:55,820
USB-C ports and USB-A ports.

967
00:48:55,820 --> 00:49:00,220
You can transfer like a terabyte of video footage in 15 minutes through the keyboard

968
00:49:00,220 --> 00:49:01,220
hub.

969
00:49:01,220 --> 00:49:05,700
That's going to be so useful in the studio because the PC that I have is way, way, way,

970
00:49:05,700 --> 00:49:06,700
way far away.

971
00:49:06,700 --> 00:49:11,100
Like, I got to get all these extender cables when I want to hook up USB devices and now,

972
00:49:11,100 --> 00:49:13,500
now I'm just going to plug them right into the keyboard.

973
00:49:13,500 --> 00:49:17,100
Yeah, this is going to be my studio keyboard and I can't wait.

974
00:49:17,100 --> 00:49:21,980
It's handcrafted in Denver and it's made with love by the System76 team and that's pretty

975
00:49:21,980 --> 00:49:22,980
special too.

976
00:49:22,980 --> 00:49:26,500
So go check out the launch and see if you want to get one for yourself.

977
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:30,500
It's a beautiful keyboard and it's built like nothing you've ever seen before.

978
00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:36,700
Go check it out at System76.com and a huge congratulations to System76 for the launch

979
00:49:36,700 --> 00:49:41,640
of the launch System76.com.

980
00:49:41,640 --> 00:49:44,980
You know, Mike, as I am on the road right now, I'm already kind of planning the next

981
00:49:44,980 --> 00:49:51,900
road trip and I think if I can get joops all fixed up and ready to go in time in mid-ish

982
00:49:51,900 --> 00:49:56,500
early, mid-early August timeframe, I think I'm going to make a trip to Denver and I am

983
00:49:56,500 --> 00:50:01,140
tempted to do a meetup like a, like a get a JB meetup that we haven't done in forever

984
00:50:01,140 --> 00:50:03,360
because of the pandemic.

985
00:50:03,360 --> 00:50:07,860
And also I'm hoping to go see Drew, editor of the show and Mr. Cheese Bacon also is going

986
00:50:07,860 --> 00:50:10,200
to be in the Denver area very soon.

987
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:13,380
And I'm hoping to get out to System76 and go see how they build the launch keyboard.

988
00:50:13,380 --> 00:50:16,460
Though I haven't actually mentioned that yet.

989
00:50:16,460 --> 00:50:20,300
So I'm hoping it's going to be quite a cool Denver trip in like the August timeframe.

990
00:50:20,300 --> 00:50:25,340
So I wanted to let people know that if you're going to be in the area, I'm probably, I'm

991
00:50:25,340 --> 00:50:27,660
probably going to make more official announcements soon.

992
00:50:27,660 --> 00:50:29,660
So this is just like an early, hey, heads up.

993
00:50:29,660 --> 00:50:34,940
If you're in the Denver area, like, Oh, I don't know the week of the 16th, we can maybe

994
00:50:34,940 --> 00:50:36,580
do a meetup around then or something.

995
00:50:36,580 --> 00:50:40,900
So let me know, send me an email if that is your thing and I'll start putting something

996
00:50:40,900 --> 00:50:43,660
together and I'll probably eventually make an official meetup post about it and let you

997
00:50:43,660 --> 00:50:47,060
know here on the show, you know, you and the kitchen fly out, come hang out with Drew and

998
00:50:47,060 --> 00:50:48,060
I.

999
00:50:48,060 --> 00:50:49,060
Sounds like fun.

1000
00:50:49,060 --> 00:50:50,060
You know, just wear masks the entire time.

1001
00:50:50,060 --> 00:50:51,060
That's the only thing.

1002
00:50:51,060 --> 00:50:52,940
It's like, I don't know how the kid would do with that.

1003
00:50:52,940 --> 00:50:54,220
The kids, you know, they're all right.

1004
00:50:54,220 --> 00:50:55,220
My kids are right with it.

1005
00:50:55,220 --> 00:50:58,340
Like when we go into a store, several hour flight, I'm not so sure.

1006
00:50:58,340 --> 00:50:59,340
Yeah.

1007
00:50:59,340 --> 00:51:00,340
My Reese is basically bang.

1008
00:51:00,340 --> 00:51:01,780
He, you know, no one cared.

1009
00:51:01,780 --> 00:51:06,340
He said, Oh, I put on the mask or a welcome good.

1010
00:51:06,340 --> 00:51:07,340
That makes it easier.

1011
00:51:07,340 --> 00:51:08,340
Yeah.

1012
00:51:08,340 --> 00:51:09,340
I try to have fun with it.

1013
00:51:09,340 --> 00:51:10,340
It does make it easier.

1014
00:51:10,340 --> 00:51:12,460
I mean, he did snap in half the Batman stuffed animal I gave him.

1015
00:51:12,460 --> 00:51:14,820
He kind of put it over his knee, but I will let that go.

1016
00:51:14,820 --> 00:51:17,980
Just make sure he doesn't go around saying he was born in the dark cause then you know

1017
00:51:17,980 --> 00:51:18,980
he's turning.

1018
00:51:18,980 --> 00:51:23,180
He did say something about liberating black gate prison, but I just sort of took his juice

1019
00:51:23,180 --> 00:51:24,180
box away.

1020
00:51:24,180 --> 00:51:25,180
I don't know.

1021
00:51:25,180 --> 00:51:26,180
There you go.

1022
00:51:26,180 --> 00:51:27,180
Yeah.

1023
00:51:27,180 --> 00:51:28,300
You get them off the juice and they they'll do a lot better.

1024
00:51:28,300 --> 00:51:32,580
My kids, my damn kids snuck out and got themselves candy for the road trip.

1025
00:51:32,580 --> 00:51:35,500
You know, cause now they're old enough where they can, they can do that.

1026
00:51:35,500 --> 00:51:41,580
And a boy, boy, Oh boy, is that a bad combination is three sugar high kids in a, in an RV going

1027
00:51:41,580 --> 00:51:42,580
down the road.

1028
00:51:42,580 --> 00:51:43,580
Let me tell you.

1029
00:51:43,580 --> 00:51:44,580
Oh yeah.

1030
00:51:44,580 --> 00:51:45,580
I aggressively limit the sugar.

1031
00:51:45,580 --> 00:51:46,580
Yeah.

1032
00:51:46,580 --> 00:51:47,580
Yeah.

1033
00:51:47,580 --> 00:51:48,580
Yeah.

1034
00:51:48,580 --> 00:51:49,580
Yeah.

1035
00:51:49,580 --> 00:51:50,580
Yeah.

1036
00:51:50,580 --> 00:51:51,580
I'm like, no, I've, I've been there.

1037
00:51:51,580 --> 00:51:52,580
I know it does.

1038
00:51:52,580 --> 00:51:53,580
I know it does.

1039
00:51:53,580 --> 00:51:54,980
You can go find our sponsor, a cloud guru on social media.

1040
00:51:54,980 --> 00:51:55,980
Did you know?

1041
00:51:55,980 --> 00:51:56,980
Go check them out.

1042
00:51:56,980 --> 00:51:57,980
Thanks to a cloud guru.

1043
00:51:57,980 --> 00:52:02,660
Just go over to slash a cloud guru anywhere that's basically a social media site and follow

1044
00:52:02,660 --> 00:52:03,660
them there.

1045
00:52:03,660 --> 00:52:04,780
You can follow Mike on Twitter.

1046
00:52:04,780 --> 00:52:07,940
He's at Dumanuku and his company is at the mad botter ink.

1047
00:52:07,940 --> 00:52:08,940
I'm there too.

1048
00:52:08,940 --> 00:52:11,660
I don't tweet a lot, but I'll, I'll reply to you.

1049
00:52:11,660 --> 00:52:15,340
I do try to reply to you and I do try to read it, but I'm just not a big tweeter, but I'm

1050
00:52:15,340 --> 00:52:16,420
over there on the Twitters.

1051
00:52:16,420 --> 00:52:21,980
I'm at Chris LAS and yeah, as you guessed it, the show has a Twitter too.

1052
00:52:21,980 --> 00:52:22,980
That's real simple.

1053
00:52:22,980 --> 00:52:23,980

1060
00:52:38,100 --> 00:52:39,100
You can't subscribe.

1061
00:52:39,100 --> 00:52:40,100

Mr. Thomas, is there anything you want to mention before we go?

00:52:51,620 --> 00:52:52,620
No.

1068
00:52:52,620 --> 00:52:56,360
If you need any Python development done, let me know we're C++ because apparently that's

1069
00:52:56,360 --> 00:52:57,360
what I do now.

1070
00:52:57,360 --> 00:52:58,360
