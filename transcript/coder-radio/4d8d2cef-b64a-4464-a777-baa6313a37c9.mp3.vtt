This is Koto Radio, episode 394 for December 28th, 2020.

00:15.000 --> 00:18.000
Hello, friend, and welcome into Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show,

00:18.000 --> 00:24.000
taking a pragmatic look at the art and business of software development and the world of technology.

00:24.000 --> 00:26.000
This episode is brought to you by a cloud guru.

00:26.000 --> 00:33.000
You know, a cloud guru now includes Cloud Playground, Azure, AWS, or Google Sandboxes on their credit card, not yours.

00:33.000 --> 00:37.000

00:37.000 --> 00:45.000
My name is Chris, and joining us, maintaining podcast order on his East Coast base, it is our host, Mr. Dominic.

00:45.000 --> 00:46.000
Hello, Mike.

00:46.000 --> 00:48.000
Wesa back.

00:48.000 --> 00:50.000
Okay, I just got to breathe for a second.

00:50.000 --> 00:51.000
Just breathe.

00:51.000 --> 00:54.000
I prepared for this.

00:54.000 --> 00:57.000
I took a lot of counseling, and yet, I'm still having the Jar Jar attack.

00:57.000 --> 01:02.000
I've actually been getting into Star Wars kind of big time again because, like a lot of other people,

01:02.000 --> 01:10.000
I've been watching Mandalorian and just finished it, and I thought it was really good.

01:10.000 --> 01:13.000
And it kind of makes me want to care more about Star Wars than I do.

01:13.000 --> 01:16.000
So I'm almost getting there with you, but...

01:16.000 --> 01:19.000
I have not watched the Mandalorian or any of the new Star Wars movies.

01:19.000 --> 01:21.000
I just enjoy Jar Jar.

01:21.000 --> 01:22.000
Yeah, I know. That's what's weird about it.

01:22.000 --> 01:24.000
That's what's so weird about it.

01:24.000 --> 01:27.000
Basically, if Jar Jar is not in it, you don't watch it.

01:27.000 --> 01:29.000
That is an accurate statement, yes.

01:29.000 --> 01:34.000
Yeah, I don't even know what to say about that.

01:34.000 --> 01:35.000
I don't even know what to say.

01:35.000 --> 01:38.000
So why don't we just sort of sidestep that?

01:38.000 --> 01:43.000
And I'm kind of curious right off the top of the show because you teased me, but you didn't say what.

01:43.000 --> 01:49.000
You said you were having smart home woes today, and hearing your woes seems like a great way to start the show.

01:49.000 --> 01:53.000
Isn't that what we've been doing for like many years, 12 years or something?

01:53.000 --> 01:54.000
It's been a long time.

01:54.000 --> 02:02.000
So I rented this house, and it comes with a smart house.

02:02.000 --> 02:06.000
Really, it's a smart thermostat and steroids that can do a few other things.

02:06.000 --> 02:10.000
But it really wants me to give it access to the Wi-Fi.

02:10.000 --> 02:12.000
And I'm like, hmm, no name smart home.

02:12.000 --> 02:16.000
I don't think I want to give you full access to a network.

02:16.000 --> 02:17.000
I think that's bad.

02:17.000 --> 02:23.000
I will just, like a Neanderthal, use the thermostat with my grubby little, you know, the digits on your hand.

02:23.000 --> 02:24.000
What do you call them, fingers?

02:24.000 --> 02:26.000
And what, you walk over to it?

02:26.000 --> 02:27.000
Yeah.

02:27.000 --> 02:28.000
Huh.

02:28.000 --> 02:29.000
That sounds exhausting.

02:29.000 --> 02:34.000
Because I don't want to give it Wi-Fi access and use their app and talk to the app and whatever.

02:34.000 --> 02:37.000
I have been fighting the good fight for two weeks.

02:37.000 --> 02:40.000
Now, I'm also the father of a four-year-old.

02:40.000 --> 02:44.000
And I don't know if you know, but Elsa's all the rage, right?

02:44.000 --> 02:45.000
You have young kids.

02:45.000 --> 02:46.000
You know Elsa.

02:46.000 --> 02:47.000
Oh, yeah.

02:47.000 --> 02:51.000
Turns out my thermostat is the HAL 9000 version of Elsa.

02:51.000 --> 02:52.000
I set the temperature.

02:52.000 --> 02:53.000
It's like 73.

02:53.000 --> 02:55.000
We're having a good time.

02:55.000 --> 02:56.000
Nice day.

02:56.000 --> 02:58.000
Played a little hi-ho cheerio.

02:58.000 --> 03:00.000
Whatever.

03:00.000 --> 03:06.000
Two o'clock in the morning, Elsa 9000 is like, okay, here we go.

03:06.000 --> 03:07.000
61.

03:07.000 --> 03:09.000
Deal with that.

03:09.000 --> 03:11.000
And I wake up shaking.

03:11.000 --> 03:14.000
Like I'm, I literally like, oh my God, did I get like COVID again?

03:14.000 --> 03:15.000
Like, what the hell?

03:15.000 --> 03:17.000
Am I dying?

03:17.000 --> 03:20.000
And no, I go to the thermostat and it's frozen.

03:20.000 --> 03:23.000
Like it's down to 61.

03:23.000 --> 03:25.000
I manually reset it.

03:25.000 --> 03:26.000
Think I'm good.

03:26.000 --> 03:27.000
Okay.

03:27.000 --> 03:28.000
Next night.

03:28.000 --> 03:29.000
Here we are again.

03:29.000 --> 03:31.000
We're singing Let It Go, Let It Go.

03:31.000 --> 03:32.000
Oh, no.

03:32.000 --> 03:41.000
After digging into some of the jankiest PHP forums that I've seen in a long time.

03:41.000 --> 03:42.000
What is it?

03:42.000 --> 03:43.000
PHP BB?

03:43.000 --> 03:45.000
Is that what I'm thinking of?

03:45.000 --> 03:46.000
Oh yeah.

03:46.000 --> 03:50.000
I found out that the reason this is happening is the previous tenant of this house must

03:50.000 --> 03:55.000
have put a program in to the home system to lower the temperature at two o'clock in the

03:55.000 --> 03:56.000
morning to 61.

03:56.000 --> 03:59.000
They're one of those folks who likes to sleep in the real cold, even if you got to kick

03:59.000 --> 04:00.000
in the AC.

04:00.000 --> 04:01.000
Right.

04:01.000 --> 04:03.000
I don't mind it a little bit chillier at night.

04:03.000 --> 04:08.000
You know, I like to go at 67 myself, maybe 65 at the absolute lowest, but like 60, 59,

04:08.000 --> 04:09.000
61.

04:09.000 --> 04:12.000
That's just, especially if you got kids, it's just way too low.

04:12.000 --> 04:14.000
Well, the other thing is, of course, it wakes the kid up.

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
So it's like, Oh, Jesus Christ.

04:16.000 --> 04:17.000
He's complaining.

04:17.000 --> 04:18.000
He's cold.

04:18.000 --> 04:19.000
Like, all right.

04:19.000 --> 04:24.000
So there is no physical way on this actual device to delete anybody's preset programs.

04:24.000 --> 04:26.000
You got to get it on the wifi and you got to get the app.

04:26.000 --> 04:28.000
You got to get her on the wifi.

04:28.000 --> 04:30.000
I hate that so much.

04:30.000 --> 04:31.000
And I, so I finally caved.

04:31.000 --> 04:33.000
I downloaded their stupid app.

04:33.000 --> 04:38.000
I gave it the wifi information and a number of issues I've been having were explained

04:38.000 --> 04:39.000
to me.

04:39.000 --> 04:43.000
For instance, why did it seem like the house locked me out by itself as though there were

04:43.000 --> 04:45.000
a poltergeist?

04:45.000 --> 04:47.000
Because the previous tenant had said it to lock after 10 minutes.

04:47.000 --> 04:49.000
If the doors weren't locked, that's really smart.

04:49.000 --> 04:51.000
That's a smart home right there.

04:51.000 --> 04:53.000
That's like a haunted house.

04:53.000 --> 04:57.000
So I am very unhappy with this one.

04:57.000 --> 05:01.000
I don't think a random thermostat, which is a little more than the thermostat in this

05:01.000 --> 05:04.000
case, but should have unfettered access to a wifi network.

05:04.000 --> 05:06.000
Isn't it interesting how it's always the damn thermostat.

05:06.000 --> 05:10.000
They're like, let's put an entire computer in the thermostat.

05:10.000 --> 05:11.000
What could go wrong?

05:11.000 --> 05:12.000
And that'll be the hub.

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
Like, what is the logic to this?

05:14.000 --> 05:15.000
You know what?

05:15.000 --> 05:19.000
Put a raspberry pie in the closet, make it user serviceable and call it good.

05:19.000 --> 05:23.000
And if you're going to have a smart thermostat, that should be one of the nodes of your smart

05:23.000 --> 05:24.000
network, but it shouldn't be the hub.

05:24.000 --> 05:25.000
It is.

05:25.000 --> 05:27.000
In this case, it's the hub.

05:27.000 --> 05:29.000
And it doesn't have like a screen.

05:29.000 --> 05:30.000
Right.

05:30.000 --> 05:33.000
I could see if there was like a tablet like mounted to a wall and it's like, dude, you

05:33.000 --> 05:34.000
can just run the whole thing here.

05:34.000 --> 05:39.000
That would be a perfectly legitimate way to like make an inset tablet mount.

05:39.000 --> 05:43.000
That's yeah, that just handles all of this with an updated user interface.

05:43.000 --> 05:45.000
It could run up into touch, right?

05:45.000 --> 05:46.000
Sure, sure.

05:46.000 --> 05:48.000
But no, we have to download an iOS app.

05:48.000 --> 05:52.000
That is how some apps you say, I wonder if this has been updated in a while.

05:52.000 --> 05:54.000
Yeah, there is no doubt.

05:54.000 --> 05:55.000
There is no doubt.

05:55.000 --> 05:58.000
Doesn't fit the screen ratio or whatever.

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
It's not used to the higher resolution screen.

06:00.000 --> 06:02.000
So there's a couple of blurry images.

06:02.000 --> 06:03.000
I'm like, this is great.

06:03.000 --> 06:04.000
This is what I want.

06:04.000 --> 06:05.000
Yep.

06:05.000 --> 06:09.000
So I ended up deleting all the presets, all the smart features, and then deleting the

06:09.000 --> 06:12.000
app again, removing the Wi-Fi information.

06:12.000 --> 06:17.000
And I have literally forcibly downgraded this house to a dumb house.

06:17.000 --> 06:22.000
I have an automation system that runs and manages all of the heating in Lady Joops,

06:22.000 --> 06:26.000
which is exceptionally useful in an RV in the winter because it's hard to keep those

06:26.000 --> 06:27.000
things comfortable.

06:27.000 --> 06:31.000
Two nights ago, I start tossing and turning for about an hour, and then I finally get

06:31.000 --> 06:36.000
up and wake up and realize I've been tossing and turning, and I realize I'm just way too

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
hot, like way too hot.

06:38.000 --> 06:39.000
What is going on?

06:39.000 --> 06:43.000
I pull out my phone and I look at the temperature sensor on my home assistant system, and it

06:43.000 --> 06:46.000
says, yeah, your bedroom's almost 80 degrees Fahrenheit.

06:46.000 --> 06:49.000
And I like it, you know, 67-ish.

06:49.000 --> 06:55.000
And what had happened is the sensor had detected that the temperature had gone up, and the

06:55.000 --> 06:59.000
system has an automation that's supposed to fire off to turn off the heaters, but that

06:59.000 --> 07:04.000
automation for some reason, because software, never fired, and the heater just kept going

07:04.000 --> 07:10.000
and going and going until I woke up, and at 4 a.m. I'm sitting there rebooting my home

07:10.000 --> 07:13.000
assistant system so that when the automations start working again.

07:13.000 --> 07:15.000
And I mostly love home assistants.

07:15.000 --> 07:20.000
In fact, I'd say I'm in a long-term relationship with home assistant as a project, but, you

07:20.000 --> 07:26.000
know, those kinds of things happen, especially on a big Python app.

07:26.000 --> 07:28.000
It is a huge Python app.

07:28.000 --> 07:32.000
And I don't know why, but sometimes those automations just don't, they stop firing,

07:32.000 --> 07:37.000
and some condition isn't met, and it results in, I had the opposite.

07:37.000 --> 07:39.000
I got way too damn hot.

07:39.000 --> 07:45.000
And I was like, damn it, I just need to fail-safe for all this stuff.

07:45.000 --> 07:46.000
I do have good news for you.

07:46.000 --> 07:48.000
Maybe I can solve another problem for you, though.

07:48.000 --> 07:49.000
What's the good news?

07:49.000 --> 07:53.000
A lot of people, at least a couple, wrote in, they wanted you to know about Variety,

07:53.000 --> 08:01.000
which is a pan and zoom image slideshow background setter that uses Python and integrates

08:01.000 --> 08:06.000
in with your desktop to change your background on your desktop from, you know, like a slideshow

08:06.000 --> 08:07.000
or whatever.

08:07.000 --> 08:10.000
It does a bunch of stuff without an extension.

08:10.000 --> 08:12.000
No extension required.

08:12.000 --> 08:19.000
It also has a standalone app, but I seem to recall it has a GUI, too, when I used it.

08:19.000 --> 08:21.000
So that's there as well.

08:21.000 --> 08:25.000
But I think the takeaway here for you, Mike, they really wanted you to know, no extension required.

08:25.000 --> 08:28.000
And there is a PPA and other packages to get it going.

08:28.000 --> 08:30.000
You say you might give Variety a go.

08:30.000 --> 08:31.000
I tried it before, and I liked it.

08:31.000 --> 08:32.000
I'm going to give that a go.

08:32.000 --> 08:34.000
Yeah, no extensions, because extensions.

08:34.000 --> 08:35.000
Extension's bad.

08:35.000 --> 08:36.000
Bad.

08:36.000 --> 08:39.000
Or you know what's funny about Plasma Desktop?

08:39.000 --> 08:40.000
Oh, here we go.

08:40.000 --> 08:45.000
Is it has multiple different types of slideshow and download images from the internet options

08:45.000 --> 08:47.000
just built into the desktop environment.

08:47.000 --> 08:52.000
No extension or modification required, it's just built into the wallpaper settings.

08:52.000 --> 08:53.000
All right.

08:53.000 --> 08:56.000
So if you're playing the Coderadio drinking game, that's Chris trying to get me on KDE

08:56.000 --> 08:58.000
every week, all the time.

08:58.000 --> 08:59.000
No, I'm done.

08:59.000 --> 09:00.000
I'm done.

09:00.000 --> 09:01.000
I'm done.

09:01.000 --> 09:02.000
I'm done.

09:02.000 --> 09:03.000
It is just interesting, right?

09:03.000 --> 09:04.000
All right.

09:04.000 --> 09:05.000
Moving on.

09:05.000 --> 09:06.000
Moving on.

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
Ross writes in, because remember we were asking, remember, Mike, we were asking for people's

09:08.000 --> 09:09.000
work from home setups?

09:09.000 --> 09:10.000
I remember.

09:10.000 --> 09:11.000
You remember.

09:11.000 --> 09:15.000
He says, hey, gang, I thought I'd contact you regarding the improvements I've made.

09:15.000 --> 09:19.000
I didn't have a work from home setup before the pandemic as we were all nine to five,

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000
Monday to Friday in the office.

09:21.000 --> 09:23.000
So I actually had to start from scratch.

09:23.000 --> 09:29.000
I won't go into great detail apart from the fact that I get to use my 1994 gray badge

09:29.000 --> 09:32.000
Model M every day now.

09:32.000 --> 09:33.000
Yes.

09:33.000 --> 09:38.000
One thing that I've invested in that I haven't heard discussed on the show is a decent rug

09:38.000 --> 09:39.000
for your feet.

09:39.000 --> 09:44.000
I initially went with a faux sheepskin rug, but it didn't have enough coverage for the

09:44.000 --> 09:45.000
floor.

09:45.000 --> 09:48.000
So I purchased this sucker and it is sensational.

09:48.000 --> 09:51.000
And he links us to a sheepskin, a white sheepskin Ikea rug.

09:51.000 --> 09:53.000
In fact, he's a bit of an Ikea warrior.

09:53.000 --> 09:58.000
He says, besides being super comfy, it also works as decent floor protection for the carpet

09:58.000 --> 10:01.000
underneath my new Ikea seat.

10:01.000 --> 10:06.000
The chair itself was difficult to track down and restock dates kept changing.

10:06.000 --> 10:12.000
So I wrote a PowerShell script to query Ikea's API and to notify me when the chair finally

10:12.000 --> 10:13.000
was back in stock.

10:13.000 --> 10:14.000
Love the show.

10:14.000 --> 10:18.000
Merry Christmas and Happy New Year to you both.

10:18.000 --> 10:19.000
I love that.

10:19.000 --> 10:22.000
The little is it in stock PowerShell script.

10:22.000 --> 10:23.000
That's choice.

10:23.000 --> 10:27.000
That email was almost perfect, except it didn't mention rust.

10:27.000 --> 10:28.000
Right.

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
You know, I just want to say you mentioned Christmas.

10:30.000 --> 10:31.000
You know, Merry Christmas to you.

10:31.000 --> 10:32.000
True.

10:32.000 --> 10:33.000
Yes.

10:33.000 --> 10:39.000
I think this year technology had a measurable like negative impact on Christmas morning.

10:39.000 --> 10:44.000
Both Apple and Nintendo were having major service issues that made just simple basic

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
stuff not work properly.

10:46.000 --> 10:49.000
And, you know, it's frustrating because there's all this excitement for a new device and you

10:49.000 --> 10:52.000
go to configure it and their servers are down.

10:52.000 --> 10:55.000
So you can't like log into your account or change payment info.

10:55.000 --> 11:00.000
It's just not good enough this year, guys, not good enough.

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
Alan writes in with more work from home hacks.

11:02.000 --> 11:06.000
He says, in episode 392, you asked for workspace improvement ideas.

11:06.000 --> 11:09.000
I have a configurable metallic mesh shelf.

11:09.000 --> 11:11.000
Now you guys have seen these before.

11:11.000 --> 11:14.000
They're the ones with sort of the almost rod looking poles.

11:14.000 --> 11:18.000
And then you slip down the shelf over it and they have a mesh.

11:18.000 --> 11:21.000
He says, I have it next to my desk for stuff that I use most of the time.

11:21.000 --> 11:26.000
Like if I have to stash a mouse or keyboard or something like right there, maybe a USB hub.

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
I needed a place for all that random stuff.

11:28.000 --> 11:31.000
So I bought a few kit shelves like that one and stacked them next to each other and on

11:31.000 --> 11:35.000
top of each other so that things I need to reach out for more often are in the middle

11:35.000 --> 11:37.000
and the rest are at the bottom and the top.

11:37.000 --> 11:42.000
The metallic mesh is nice in a sense because I can put a laptop on there while charging

11:42.000 --> 11:45.000
and I don't have to worry about it heating up.

11:45.000 --> 11:48.000
The mesh actually helps with airflow.

11:48.000 --> 11:51.000
Also, I thought this would be interesting to you.

11:51.000 --> 11:54.000
He says he uses two identical headsets.

11:54.000 --> 11:57.000
So get your brain noodle around this.

11:57.000 --> 12:02.000
He says, then I don't have to worry whether they have enough juice for the next meeting all the time.

12:02.000 --> 12:05.000
One of them is at the desk and the other one is charging.

12:05.000 --> 12:09.000
Both pairs being identical means that during use, I don't have to fumble around for batteries

12:09.000 --> 12:14.000
that might be placed in different places on the headset or in varying functionality,

12:14.000 --> 12:18.000
which I sometimes did when they were not identical since it's been a game changer.

12:18.000 --> 12:25.000
And he also said he is, after testing a lot of different setups, a one single big monitor kind of guy.

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
It's just made things a lot easier.

12:27.000 --> 12:28.000
Yep, that's where I am now too.

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
I have a 27 inch Dell.

12:30.000 --> 12:35.000
Somebody had asked for the model number and I naturally forgot to look it up.

12:35.000 --> 12:36.000
Oh, right.

12:36.000 --> 12:37.000
Yeah, we did get asked.

12:37.000 --> 12:39.000
I have Asus 1440p screens.

12:39.000 --> 12:41.000
I don't know what their model number is.

12:41.000 --> 12:42.000
I like them.

12:42.000 --> 12:45.000
There's something attractive about multi monitor, but I think the single monitor setup,

12:45.000 --> 12:50.000
especially when running a certain windowing environment that shall not be named,

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
you seem to have less issues.

12:52.000 --> 12:57.000
Also, when you're on a laptop, what really sucks is when you have multiple screens and then you disconnect

12:57.000 --> 13:01.000
and then everything has to get like moved back to one screen.

13:01.000 --> 13:02.000
It's always such a hot mess.

13:02.000 --> 13:05.000
So there's that detractor from it too.

13:05.000 --> 13:10.000
But yeah, it really has been challenging in the past when I have different crazy multi monitor setups.

13:10.000 --> 13:17.000
I love it so dang much, but I do think long term I'll be doing the single large monitor thing.

13:17.000 --> 13:20.000
I may even like a little bit of a curve to my screen.

13:20.000 --> 13:22.000
Call me an animal, but I just...

13:22.000 --> 13:23.000
Yeah, you are an animal.

13:23.000 --> 13:24.000
That would make me crazy.

13:24.000 --> 13:25.000
Really?

13:25.000 --> 13:27.000
What if it's like a big screen, like a 32 inch screen?

13:27.000 --> 13:29.000
It just kind of curves in at the edges a little bit.

13:29.000 --> 13:30.000
I don't know.

13:30.000 --> 13:31.000
I just can't see it.

13:31.000 --> 13:34.000
I think also I'm kind of waiting for the right monitor.

13:34.000 --> 13:37.000
Something that maybe is a bit of a Thunderbolt dock in a way.

13:37.000 --> 13:43.000
Maybe it's even 144 Hertz ideally and at least 27 inches.

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
I'd love it to be a 5K resolution.

13:45.000 --> 13:47.000
I think that'd be a real sweet spot.

13:47.000 --> 13:48.000
We'll see.

13:48.000 --> 13:51.000
Yeah, the 5K on Linux is kind of tough though, right?

13:51.000 --> 13:54.000
Yeah, not impossible with some desktops, but yeah.

13:54.000 --> 13:58.000
What some desktop environments are going to now is you just kind of have a fractional scalar.

13:58.000 --> 14:00.000
You can just do, do, do, do, do, do scale that thing way up.

14:00.000 --> 14:05.000
Some can go beyond 200%, but I don't know exactly.

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
4K is not bad now.

14:07.000 --> 14:10.000
I still think 2K is the sweet spot.

14:10.000 --> 14:16.000
So we're talking about kind of higher end machines, but we did get an email into the show this week from Thomas about low end machines.

14:16.000 --> 14:22.000
He says, I wanted to add my story to your discussion about people keeping old laptops that are running and keeping them going for work.

14:22.000 --> 14:26.000
I'm a freelance Linux sysadmin and I've been a Dell faithful for many years.

14:26.000 --> 14:31.000
I have trusty steeds that include the D430, the Latitude 13, the E4300, the E6.

14:31.000 --> 14:32.000
Anyways, he goes on.

14:32.000 --> 14:40.000
He lists all of them, but then he gets to at the end of that list, he says, and the XPS 13 9370.

14:40.000 --> 14:49.000
When my Latitude mysteriously fried itself suddenly this July, I was knee deep in a rollout of some new infrastructure on a project and I couldn't stop for a fallen comrade.

14:49.000 --> 14:51.000
So I grabbed the next best laptop I had lying around.

14:51.000 --> 14:59.000
I sometimes buy surplus hardware and resell on eBay, which happened to be an HP EliteBook 8460P from 2011.

14:59.000 --> 15:02.000
I scrounged together 16 gigs of RAM and an SSD.

15:02.000 --> 15:05.000
I installed KDE Neon and I was up and going again within three hours.

15:05.000 --> 15:11.000
I invested fifty dollars in a quad core i7 CPU to replace the dual core it had.

15:11.000 --> 15:15.000
I found out that you can just actually swap the CPU on that model, which was pretty sweet.

15:15.000 --> 15:17.000
But here's what's weird.

15:17.000 --> 15:20.000
Five months on and I'm still using it.

15:20.000 --> 15:27.000
I've not gone back to my repaired XPS 13, mostly because the keyboard in the EliteBook is an absolute joy to type on in the 4K screen.

15:27.000 --> 15:34.000
To your point earlier, Mike, he says the 4K screen is still a faff when connecting to non high DPI screens through a Thunderbolt 3 dock.

15:34.000 --> 15:37.000
Sometimes there's so many acronyms in there.

15:37.000 --> 15:41.000
He goes on to say downsides of the EliteBook are, of course, the screen and the weight are maybe not as great as they could be.

15:41.000 --> 15:45.000
The keyboard backlights mediocre and the battery life is pretty poor.

15:45.000 --> 15:49.000
But I think I could actually continue working on this old thing.

15:49.000 --> 15:55.000
I'm only upgrading to a new laptop eventually because 16 gigs of RAM is a little tight.

15:55.000 --> 16:02.000
But I was just really blown away at how amazing this nine year old machine and how well it has held up.

16:02.000 --> 16:05.000
Thanks for the great show. Thanks, Thomas.

16:05.000 --> 16:12.000
Oh, man, having a laptop die when you're in the middle of a rollout as worst case stuff right there.

16:12.000 --> 16:13.000
Best thing ever.

16:13.000 --> 16:18.000
Throwing together an old machine. I have absolutely been there, been there, done that, you know.

16:18.000 --> 16:23.000
But he mentioned the XPS 13. I think that's a have you seen these XPS 13?

16:23.000 --> 16:26.000
I haven't seen the newest ones in the wild. No, but they look pretty good.

16:26.000 --> 16:29.000
Guess what? I just got into the studio. I have a box right here.

16:29.000 --> 16:31.000
I actually haven't opened it yet, so I'm going to open it right here on the show.

16:31.000 --> 16:36.000
It's a Dell box. And based on the size, I'm guessing in this box is an XPS 13.

16:36.000 --> 16:40.000
A review unit here for the show. Oh, it's a white one, too.

16:40.000 --> 16:45.000
Look at this. Oh, this is a nice box. And it comes with the power adapter in the box, too.

16:45.000 --> 16:50.000
That's nice. Look at this thing. Wow. Wow.

16:50.000 --> 16:56.000
I've never seen the white XPS before in person. They are pretty.

16:56.000 --> 17:01.000
This is really nice. It's cold still because it was outside, you know, and it's cold outside.

17:01.000 --> 17:04.000
So the metal or whatever it is is still cold to the touch.

17:04.000 --> 17:11.000
Wow. It's a matte white. And it's and actually I think I would describe this as beautiful

17:11.000 --> 17:19.000
because the Dell logo and the XPS logo on the bottom are reflective, like polished metal, aluminum, I guess.

17:19.000 --> 17:25.000
Oh, it fired right up when I opened up the keyboard and the backlight because I'm doing this in the evening.

17:25.000 --> 17:31.000
The backlight is significant. It kind of has a bloom look to it. It's also really pretty.

17:31.000 --> 17:34.000
This has the i5 in it, it looks like.

17:34.000 --> 17:39.000
So Dell had mentioned they were going to send me a budget development machine to review on the show.

17:39.000 --> 17:44.000
And I think this is it. So my first impressions are pretty good.

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
Is this a Linux model or?

17:46.000 --> 17:49.000
Yeah, it's their Linux developer laptop.

17:49.000 --> 17:53.000
And this one comes pre-installed with Ubuntu, which is booting up right now.

17:53.000 --> 17:54.000
Oh, there it is.

17:54.000 --> 17:56.000
Oh, I feel so British right now.

17:56.000 --> 17:59.000
Yeah. Yes, I accept it. OK.

17:59.000 --> 18:03.000
It's got to be. Actually, this is a 1080p screen. It's just really nice.

18:03.000 --> 18:05.000
But it's the 1080p screen. It looks like not the 4K,

18:05.000 --> 18:11.000
which may be actually a good way to save money and still get something that really looks good.

18:11.000 --> 18:14.000
Well, you're getting a better battery life with a 1080p screen, too.

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
The 4K is going to draw a lot more power.

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
You know what I really like about this is the weighting.

18:18.000 --> 18:21.000
It sits right here on the edge of my table and it sits there balanced.

18:21.000 --> 18:23.000
I really like that.

18:23.000 --> 18:26.000
You know, I'd say like only 15 percent of the laptops on the table.

18:26.000 --> 18:29.000
But the way the weighting works with the screen and whatnot, it sits there.

18:29.000 --> 18:32.000
You know what? I'll use this for a week and then I'll report back.

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
All right. You heard it here first. Next week.

18:34.000 --> 18:37.000
Yeah. Yeah. If it's ready. XPS 13.

18:37.000 --> 18:41.000
And I don't really know much more yet at this point, but I'll have all the details,

18:41.000 --> 18:44.000
configuration information and all of that.

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
Shipped fully charged, too.

18:46.000 --> 18:50.000
This is it's really stunning looking because the bottom is like a brushed aluminum,

18:50.000 --> 18:55.000
like a chamfered edges even like the old iPhone 5S or whatever.

18:55.000 --> 18:58.000
And then the top is this matte white.

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
Sturdy feeling.

19:00.000 --> 19:07.000
So I'll let you know, you know, because, Thomas, I'm sure you and others use these Dells as production machines.

19:07.000 --> 19:12.000
All right. So, Mike, and I don't think it was you, wrote in with an age old question.

19:12.000 --> 19:17.000
He says, Hi, guys. Long time listener of the show and I'm on team hashtag Robbros.

19:17.000 --> 19:20.000
Robbros also includes ladies.

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
God damn it. It's so good, man.

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
You know, and I've been hearing on other shows and stuff.

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
It's leaked into other shows. People excited. Amazing.

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
I think we should try to have a product by 400.

19:28.000 --> 19:32.000
We don't have a lot of time. You know, isn't this 390? What is this?

19:32.000 --> 19:33.000
394.

19:33.000 --> 19:34.000
Well, six weeks. OK.

19:34.000 --> 19:40.000
I don't know. I still haven't got a strong lead on somebody who can who can stitch and sell.

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
I don't know what to do about that.

19:42.000 --> 19:46.000
I feel like quality custom robe vendors is like a hard thing to find.

19:46.000 --> 19:49.000
Yeah, but this is a this is an important product.

19:49.000 --> 19:51.000
And there's robe ready consumers, Mike.

19:51.000 --> 19:52.000
You know, these people are robe ready.

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
They're getting out of the shower. They're freezing.

19:54.000 --> 19:55.000
They need a robe.

19:55.000 --> 19:59.000
And we have episode 400 feels like a milestone, like, you know, something special.

19:59.000 --> 20:01.000
And what better than a robe?

20:01.000 --> 20:04.000
Right? Doesn't 400 say robe, Mike?

20:04.000 --> 20:05.000
You know what? I would wear it.

20:05.000 --> 20:13.000
Yeah. I mean, I've been wearing the minimum viable robe and it's told it showed me that it increases my comfort level even when just walking around the studio.

20:13.000 --> 20:15.000
So and sometimes I feel like I have a cape.

20:15.000 --> 20:17.000
I actually have pants on like a heathen.

20:17.000 --> 20:20.000
Yeah. Well, pants is sometimes mandatory.

20:20.000 --> 20:24.000
I'm not going to I don't want to besmooch anybody for wearing pants.

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
But if you can if you can wear a robe, you should.

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
Right. So pants are no pants.

20:28.000 --> 20:29.000
You can sometimes wear a robe with pants on, too.

20:29.000 --> 20:32.000
I do it, too. I just don't tell people about it.

20:32.000 --> 20:41.000
All right. So listener Mike says, I'd love to hear your take on when to adopt a new code framework and when to migrate from an old framework to the new one.

20:41.000 --> 20:45.000
He's always he's always kind of gone old man when it comes to development.

20:45.000 --> 20:50.000
He doesn't really like going with the new and shiny, even though he sees it flood his Twitter feeds every day.

20:50.000 --> 20:55.000
But he says, sometimes I will build something with an older framework, but then I'll put it into production.

20:55.000 --> 20:58.000
And then I kind of worry about it getting outdated too quickly.

20:58.000 --> 21:01.000
About five years ago, I went to build the new PHP application.

21:01.000 --> 21:03.000
Larval was still the new kid on the block.

21:03.000 --> 21:08.000
So I built it on code igniter since it was proven with history.

21:08.000 --> 21:11.000
That app ended up becoming the base for our SAS platform.

21:11.000 --> 21:14.000
It now sells well over a million users.

21:14.000 --> 21:20.000
And in that five years, code igniter has fallen by the wayside and larval has emerged as the king.

21:20.000 --> 21:30.000
Although my code igniter app still works fine, I find myself wanting to start the daunting task of putting it over to larval or something more modern for the community support.

21:30.000 --> 21:34.000
But also so we can hire developers, get security fixes, et cetera.

21:34.000 --> 21:38.000
So I'm curious from seasoned developers like yourselves who have seen frameworks come and go.

21:38.000 --> 21:43.000
What is your rule of thumb on adopting new frameworks and when do you upgrade from the old ones?

21:43.000 --> 21:44.000
Jesus.

21:44.000 --> 21:49.000
And you know, somebody who's just moved his shop to Python, I mean, you can kind of think of it in that context too.

21:49.000 --> 21:51.000
It's like, when do you make a shift like that?

21:51.000 --> 21:52.000
When is it the right time?

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
Yeah, it's a tough call.

21:54.000 --> 21:57.000
I mean, so there's so many ways to look at this, right?

21:57.000 --> 22:07.000
There's the business way of it might in fact be easier to sell the new hotness, but is it necessarily going to be stable enough?

22:07.000 --> 22:10.000
Is it going to, you know, last?

22:10.000 --> 22:18.000
Right. Having said that, using older frameworks, there's just a lot more support out there, especially if you have experience in the framework.

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
Let's say you've been doing Rails for a long time.

22:20.000 --> 22:31.000
You can get things done in Rails very quickly because you have the expertise and there's a giant community of Rails developers who would love the stack overflow points for answering your question, right?

22:31.000 --> 22:38.000
But you can get caught in the rut of being a one trick pony and kind of having the world move on from you.

22:38.000 --> 22:44.000
I sort of tend to be conservative, as longtime listeners will know.

22:44.000 --> 22:52.000
Or if I do try something new, it'll be in what I'm trying to do, not how I'm trying to do it in terms of like dependencies.

22:52.000 --> 23:01.000
Having said that, I really have been enjoying working with like a lighter framework like Flask and being able to kind of bootstrap up lighter, like compared to Rails or Django, right?

23:01.000 --> 23:08.000
And being able to bootstrap up, you know, the specific solution that I need.

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
I don't know if that's something I'd recommend for everybody.

23:10.000 --> 23:17.000
I mean, I think that's more of a preference thing and that, like, as time has gone on, the products I get continue to become stranger.

23:17.000 --> 23:21.000
So it's just they need more custom stuff.

23:21.000 --> 23:23.000
All right. I'll give you a perfect example.

23:23.000 --> 23:29.000
A couple of years ago, we were doing the show, Node.js was going to kill Rails, was going to kill Django, was going to kill everything.

23:29.000 --> 23:31.000
Then there was a lot of Node.js code written, right?

23:31.000 --> 23:32.000
Yeah.

23:32.000 --> 23:33.000
But that didn't happen.

23:33.000 --> 23:34.000
Right.

23:34.000 --> 23:43.000
And I would say Python is actually, like, and Python is far from new and Flask and I could say maybe Masonite's kind of a newer framework.

23:43.000 --> 23:47.000
But, you know, sometimes these things are just fads.

23:47.000 --> 23:50.000
And I'm not saying Node was a fad because there's lots of stuff written in Node.

23:50.000 --> 23:51.000
There's a hype train.

23:51.000 --> 23:53.000
There's a hype train, right?

23:53.000 --> 23:59.000
And sometimes, like, you can get an idea that, okay, something has seen a lot of adoption just based on the amount of hype around something.

23:59.000 --> 24:05.000
But that hype can make you feel like maybe you've made a mistake by not jumping on board.

24:05.000 --> 24:13.000
Like, when Bitcoin starts getting $25,000 or $27,000, all of a sudden all of this hype about Bitcoin builds back up again.

24:13.000 --> 24:14.000
Right.

24:14.000 --> 24:15.000
Yeah.

24:15.000 --> 24:17.000
I think actually Listener Mike hit the sweet spot.

24:17.000 --> 24:23.000
So he got five years and, you know, sold to a million customers. That's pretty damn successful.

24:23.000 --> 24:28.000
And that is, I think, success in every measurable way.

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
I don't think he should feel bad about his decision at all.

24:30.000 --> 24:33.000
He made a good choice with the options at the time.

24:33.000 --> 24:39.000
Sometimes you don't get to build at the right time and you just got to choose the platform that works best for you.

24:39.000 --> 24:44.000
And now you are probably at a point where it's time to start looking at migrating.

24:44.000 --> 24:45.000
Try something.

24:45.000 --> 24:46.000
Yeah.

24:46.000 --> 24:53.000
I think one thing I will say is just like a perfect negative example here is when Swift came out for about a year,

24:53.000 --> 24:54.000
there was all this hype around it.

24:54.000 --> 24:57.000
And I even financially supported the Vapor framework.

24:57.000 --> 24:59.000
And there's nothing wrong with Vapor, great team, great people.

24:59.000 --> 25:05.000
But remember IBM had this whole thing where they were going to make like Swift like it was going to kill Java in the enterprise, right?

25:05.000 --> 25:07.000
Yeah, they were going to make it the enterprise language.

25:07.000 --> 25:08.000
That did not happen.

25:08.000 --> 25:09.000
Right.

25:09.000 --> 25:13.000
There is virtually no server side Swift work being done anymore by anybody.

25:13.000 --> 25:16.000
You know, that's just a case of it was straight up hype.

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
Doesn't mean Swift's a bad language.

25:18.000 --> 25:19.000
Oh, my God.

25:19.000 --> 25:21.000
What did I just say?

25:21.000 --> 25:25.000
It just means that sometimes you need a reason to change.

25:25.000 --> 25:26.000
Right.

25:26.000 --> 25:33.000
You can't just change because it's Tuesday and like unless you're doing rust and then it's the right choice.

25:33.000 --> 25:34.000
Right.

25:34.000 --> 25:35.000
Of course.

25:35.000 --> 25:36.000
Right.

25:36.000 --> 25:40.000
I think listener Mike should be patting himself on the back, not beating him up like he seems to be doing.

25:40.000 --> 25:41.000
Yeah.

25:41.000 --> 25:42.000
You had that many users that worked.

25:42.000 --> 25:43.000
Yeah.

25:43.000 --> 25:46.000
Mike Sinem in the chat is saying whatever Mike supports go the other way.

25:46.000 --> 25:47.000
He's not wrong, actually.

25:47.000 --> 25:52.000
I have a bad track record of I just want to say Windows Metro.

25:52.000 --> 25:53.000
Lost a lot of money on that one.

25:53.000 --> 25:54.000
Yeah.

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
Well, the bad ones stand out, you know.

25:56.000 --> 25:57.000
Yeah.

25:57.000 --> 25:58.000
There's a lot of good calls, too.

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
Every now and then we find a clip of him and play him.

26:00.000 --> 26:03.000
iOS in 2008 was a great call, right?

26:03.000 --> 26:04.000
Yeah.

26:04.000 --> 26:05.000
Yeah.

26:05.000 --> 26:06.000
Yeah.

26:06.000 --> 26:16.000
And, you know, I do feel like my particular personality and maybe yours, too, is I almost never appreciate a win.

26:16.000 --> 26:19.000
I just kind of like I immediately move to the next problem.

26:19.000 --> 26:23.000
I'm always focused on making something better or fixing problems.

26:23.000 --> 26:26.000
And it's just like, okay, well, that's been done.

26:26.000 --> 26:27.000
Now we've got to get to the next thing.

26:27.000 --> 26:30.000
And I don't really ever stop and like celebrate a victory.

26:30.000 --> 26:34.000
And I think that's probably to my deficit, I would imagine.

26:34.000 --> 26:37.000
Yeah, I would say we both tend to focus on the negative for sure.

26:37.000 --> 26:45.000
And I think there's a bit of a self-employed kind of mentality where you've always got to be like pushing forward and fixing stuff.

26:45.000 --> 26:46.000
So it's tricky.

26:46.000 --> 26:49.000
It is tricky to get that stuff just right.

26:49.000 --> 26:53.000
But we'd love to hear your thoughts, your feedback, your work from home improvements.

26:53.000 --> 26:55.000
Coder.show slash contact.

26:55.000 --> 26:56.000
Go there.

26:56.000 --> 26:57.000
Send in an email.

26:57.000 --> 27:02.000
Your feedback is a huge part of the show and we love getting it.

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000
Linode.com slash coder.

27:04.000 --> 27:10.000
Go there to get a $100 60-day credit towards a new account and you go there to support the show.

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
Linode is our cloud server provider.

27:12.000 --> 27:13.000
Their prices are great.

27:13.000 --> 27:16.000
And with that $100 credit, you can do a lot.

27:16.000 --> 27:24.000
They started in 2003 as one of the first companies in cloud computing, three years before AWS and other big providers tried to come along.

27:24.000 --> 27:27.000
And they're independently owned and founded on love for Linux.

27:27.000 --> 27:29.000
They love open source technologies.

27:29.000 --> 27:34.000
That's where they saw things were going and they started the company so many years ago and they support the community around them.

27:34.000 --> 27:42.000
Projects like Kubuntu, events like All Things Open and Linux Fest Northwest, and media like our podcast and others.

27:42.000 --> 27:43.000
It's pretty great.

27:43.000 --> 27:52.000
So that's why when you go to linode.com slash coder, you're not only getting a $100 60-day credit to try out Linode's awesome cloud servers or object storage,

27:52.000 --> 27:55.000
but you are also supporting the Coder radio program and Jupiter broadcasting.

27:55.000 --> 27:57.000
Linode.com slash coder.

27:57.000 --> 28:00.000
We host all of our servers over there.

28:00.000 --> 28:04.000
And I was pretty impressed, of course, and I've shared those stories with you.

28:04.000 --> 28:08.000
But recently I've started getting notes from the audience.

28:08.000 --> 28:11.000
I love one that I got recently from listener Jeff.

28:11.000 --> 28:16.000
He set up this next cloud server and everybody started using it and depending on it.

28:16.000 --> 28:20.000
And he realized he needed to migrate it to a faster, more performant box.

28:20.000 --> 28:24.000
And he didn't really know what was the right path to go.

28:24.000 --> 28:29.000
He had a local quad core box with 16 gigs of RAM.

28:29.000 --> 28:33.000
And he thought that would be enough, but it turned out to be insufficient.

28:33.000 --> 28:40.000
And through a process of creating Linode's, trying out the database migration and the software migration,

28:40.000 --> 28:43.000
following tutorials that Linode has on their website,

28:43.000 --> 28:47.000
he was able to work the process out and get his next cloud instance migrated.

28:47.000 --> 28:57.000
And he says, PS, you were right, Chris, the cheapest single cord Linode was still faster than my quad core 16 gig local machine.

28:57.000 --> 29:00.000
I mean, that's what I'm talking about.

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
Linode's great for learning and it's great for production.

29:02.000 --> 29:06.000
If you're a small business or you're an enterprise that needs infrastructure,

29:06.000 --> 29:09.000
you'd be surprised what runs on Linode, a lot of the web.

29:09.000 --> 29:11.000
So go to Linode.com slash coder.

29:11.000 --> 29:17.000
Get that $100, 60 day credit towards your new account and make it possible for independent media to be free.

29:17.000 --> 29:19.000
Linode.com slash coder.

29:21.000 --> 29:23.000
So it is the 28th.

29:23.000 --> 29:26.000
I mean, this is like end of the year as it gets for us right here.

29:26.000 --> 29:30.000
And we thought we'd maybe do something a little different.

29:30.000 --> 29:36.000
Flip the script moment, because I think it's pretty easy to complain about how many subscription services there are.

29:36.000 --> 29:42.000
It's really easy to complain about the price, about how all these things want to nickel and dime you.

29:42.000 --> 29:48.000
But we thought we'd take a moment on the show to talk about the software as a service that we happily pay for.

29:48.000 --> 29:55.000
You know, looking back at the year, what's money well spent as far as a subscription goes in our mind?

29:55.000 --> 30:02.000
Let's talk about the positives of it a little bit, because you could argue there's sometimes some really good use cases for subscription revenue.

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
We have value add that we add through a subscription.

30:04.000 --> 30:05.000
It's not all bad.

30:05.000 --> 30:11.000
I think it's obviously a little out of control, especially when it comes to all of the damn apps on the iOS store.

30:11.000 --> 30:13.000
But that's another topic.

30:13.000 --> 30:17.000
Yeah, I thought maybe we to kind of focus more from a business perspective.

30:17.000 --> 30:19.000
We can throw some personal ones, too. That's fine.

30:19.000 --> 30:20.000
I got a few of those. Sure.

30:20.000 --> 30:23.000
But I think one that we probably both have in common is Google Apps.

30:23.000 --> 30:24.000
Yeah. Yeah.

30:24.000 --> 30:27.000
I run my whole business on Google Apps for ever.

30:27.000 --> 30:33.000
So I don't don't use much beyond email, so I don't feel like I'm getting the complete value.

30:33.000 --> 30:38.000
I use drive a little bit for some offsite storage backup stuff for encrypted stuff.

30:38.000 --> 30:40.000
But I don't really use docs much.

30:40.000 --> 30:44.000
I actually use docs on my personal account more because I just have momentum there.

30:44.000 --> 30:47.000
It's really just for well hosted email.

30:47.000 --> 30:50.000
No, I use the whole their whole like office suite docs.

30:50.000 --> 30:54.000
The only one I can maybe complain about a little is their version of PowerPoint.

30:54.000 --> 30:58.000
But it's fine if you just accept that it's not PowerPoint.

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
Oh, yeah. I see on your list to fireside.

31:00.000 --> 31:01.000
We both use fireside.

31:01.000 --> 31:06.000
Yeah. Podcast hosting platform that written by Dan Benjamin that we think is pretty great.

31:06.000 --> 31:09.000
I was a little surprised to see Dropbox on yours.

31:09.000 --> 31:12.000
I got to be honest with you.

31:12.000 --> 31:19.000
It vexes me so it vexes me because I managed to get what happened is I managed to get the cost down pretty low.

31:19.000 --> 31:24.000
And so then it sort of backburned the project is what happened.

31:24.000 --> 31:28.000
Basically, it's like, OK, that solves enough problems at that price point.

31:28.000 --> 31:35.000
But I just this last weekend was looking at C file again between C file and C thing.

31:35.000 --> 31:38.000
I think I could probably get away with finally getting rid of Dropbox.

31:38.000 --> 31:44.000
But it's like that in Creative Cloud have a lot of historical momentum.

31:44.000 --> 31:49.000
Like I also pay for Creative Cloud, even though I run Linux.

31:49.000 --> 31:51.000
Yeah. Yeah.

31:51.000 --> 31:53.000
Because you get assets and whatnot. Right.

31:53.000 --> 31:55.000
That or you work with people temporarily that use it.

31:55.000 --> 32:02.000
You work with people who like to send you PSDs and you and I have found that that is not just like, you know, have a Windows VM or like.

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
Yeah. Yep. Yep. Yep.

32:04.000 --> 32:08.000
Yeah. I have a MacBook in the studio that if I have to it's got the Creative Cloud client.

32:08.000 --> 32:15.000
And because I use it so rarely about once a month, maybe maybe a little bit more depending on like if we have a project going on or something.

32:15.000 --> 32:18.000
It's it's like clunky to get started and whatnot.

32:18.000 --> 32:21.000
It's one of those things that you don't often need it. But when you need it, you need it now.

32:21.000 --> 32:23.000
And of course, there's a lot of historical stuff.

32:23.000 --> 32:31.000
And I've tried converting some of them to like open formats and stuff and things have gotten messed up and it just has not been ideal.

32:31.000 --> 32:33.000
What about some of your other subscriptions that have been worth it for you?

32:33.000 --> 32:46.000
So one of the big changes I made about two years ago that is actually finally in 2020 started bearing fruit was I went from using Google Sheets for accounting to actually getting QuickBooks online.

32:46.000 --> 32:58.000
Which is kind of a big step because it's like it's one of those pieces of Web software. It's a sass that is huge and you have to learn it and you have to like I literally was watching.

32:58.000 --> 33:02.000
Not cheap either. It's not cheap either. And I was like watching YouTube. It's like getting Salesforce, right?

33:02.000 --> 33:08.000
Like it can do a lot of stuff for you, but you're going to work the way it tells you to work.

33:08.000 --> 33:10.000
So that's a big one for me.

33:10.000 --> 33:16.000
They also bought, because they're evil, TSheets, which is a timesheet tracking thing.

33:16.000 --> 33:20.000
Obviously, it's a dev shop. That's kind of important to us, right?

33:20.000 --> 33:27.000
So I like them. I will complain a little bit and I know we're not supposed to, but I'm going to do it anyway.

33:27.000 --> 33:28.000
It's my nature.

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
No, that's all right. I'll out.

33:30.000 --> 33:35.000
TSheets had native apps when they were independent and they even had like a pretty good Electron app for Linux.

33:35.000 --> 33:36.000
Oh, yeah.

33:36.000 --> 33:39.000
Went into it, who wants QuickBooks, bought them.

33:39.000 --> 33:42.000
They really want you to use it on your phone.

33:42.000 --> 33:50.000
And I miss having the thing in my my top right bar that tells me how long I've been working on a task or a project.

33:50.000 --> 33:56.000
Yeah, because if I see that I'm going over what the estimate was or if I'm going to if I just not feel like I'm making enough,

33:56.000 --> 34:02.000
that's a good early warning where I can reach out to the customer and say, listen, we might have had a little bit of a, you know,

34:02.000 --> 34:10.000
a under bit here or just a, you know, this is more complex or whatever. Having it on your phone, you know,

34:10.000 --> 34:17.000
if it's your timesheet program and you're working at a computer, I feel like that needs to be on the computer.

34:17.000 --> 34:19.000
And I know I sound like an old man, but.

34:19.000 --> 34:22.000
No, I completely, completely agree. In fact, I had a similar.

34:22.000 --> 34:31.000
So what we're using right now, although I don't know if it's going to change, the problem with QuickBooks is the cost is high.

34:31.000 --> 34:42.000
The lock in feels high, but it has essentially every accountant in the states in their back pocket, like they all just want QuickBooks.

34:42.000 --> 34:45.000
Every account I've ever worked with is like, oh, well, do you have QuickBooks online?

34:45.000 --> 34:48.000
You can just delegate me a log in and I can get this sorted for you.

34:48.000 --> 34:53.000
No, I don't have. But I do use FreshBooks for invoicing.

34:53.000 --> 35:02.000
They were a sponsor a lifetime ago, and I've been a user since. And FreshBooks has kind of a modern take on invoicing.

35:02.000 --> 35:05.000
And they also have a time tracking app that you can do it through the Web.

35:05.000 --> 35:13.000
Yeah, kind of. It's not great. So I ended up for time tracking when I was working at for podcast consulting.

35:13.000 --> 35:19.000
What I did is just a dedicated iPad that I would take my notes on in one pane and then the other pane was the time tracking stuff.

35:19.000 --> 35:26.000
And it's just it's just it irks. It's irksome because you really just want it right on the main interface that you're doing the work at.

35:26.000 --> 35:31.000
And you can put your notes in there and it just be a lot better. But I've been paying for FreshBooks forever.

35:31.000 --> 35:35.000
I even have like a grandfathered in account that's I think a better deal than you can get now.

35:35.000 --> 35:40.000
It's so funny. FreshBooks was the alternative I was going to go with, but my accountant is 77.

35:40.000 --> 35:43.000
He's like, what is this crap? Yeah. Right. Yeah.

35:43.000 --> 35:50.000
Some people definitely it's gotten more it's got more well-known, but like QuickBooks is just institutional.

35:50.000 --> 35:56.000
Yeah, but they charge you. Yeah. For that. And anyway, we are not complaining.

35:56.000 --> 36:00.000
So let me do another positive one. Trello. Yeah. OK. OK.

36:00.000 --> 36:10.000
I am surprised. And so plug, plug, plug, rabbi integrates a fellow can automate your managing of your crazy ass Trello boards like I got rid of base camp.

36:10.000 --> 36:16.000
I got I long time listeners will know I've tried every project management tool known to man.

36:16.000 --> 36:19.000
Just a little bit of automation via the rabbit. Sorry for the ad.

36:19.000 --> 36:24.000
And Trello has actually been the most elegant, simple to use solution.

36:24.000 --> 36:28.000
And because Trello was so dirt simple, all my customers use it.

36:28.000 --> 36:33.000
One of the big problems we had was that we would like get these fancy.

36:33.000 --> 36:37.000
There was an there's an open source one whose name I can't remember, but it's like a super base camp.

36:37.000 --> 36:42.000
And customers would just get frustrated and like not use it and end up just emailing you stuff anyway.

36:42.000 --> 36:51.000
Then you always had to like track things down. Yeah. Trello does seem to have a high, high user appeal, especially to a broader range of users.

36:51.000 --> 36:54.000
Absolutely. You'll probably Trello from my cold dead hands.

36:54.000 --> 37:06.000
And the irony of this is way back in the day, about a decade ago, I hired an employee who was complaining that we should have been using Trello and I may have scolded him.

37:06.000 --> 37:12.000
So I think I recall that conversation leaking into the conversation on air and hearing a little bit about that.

37:12.000 --> 37:16.000
You know, also the thing is, it's not just like the Kanban card style thing.

37:16.000 --> 37:23.000
It's like the whole Trello package, including some of the silly stuff that I would just consider frills.

37:23.000 --> 37:29.000
I have noticed like my wife will sit down and make these really nice looking boards.

37:29.000 --> 37:38.000
And to her, it's sort of like that cultivating it is a way for her to kind of put energy into it in a way where she's thinking about it, but she's not directly working on it.

37:38.000 --> 37:42.000
That makes a ton of sense. So give me one of yours. You did a fresh book. So what's next?

37:42.000 --> 37:46.000
Yeah. Well, so, you know, you got me on the drop box. I got to admit it.

37:46.000 --> 37:55.000
Something else that we pay for, although it's pretty reduced now, is Alphonic, which is an online audio processing service.

37:55.000 --> 38:00.000
It's really kind of nice. It's quite handy. It's kind of magic, black magic kind of audio processing.

38:00.000 --> 38:07.000
Not probably as great as something like a guy like Drew could do on his own, but like somebody who just wants some basic audio cleanup, Alphonic is great for that.

38:07.000 --> 38:12.000
So it's one of our like Hail Mary approaches to like a real bad interview or something like that.

38:12.000 --> 38:15.000
And you pay for hours of processing on their servers.

38:15.000 --> 38:21.000
So I think I think I buy like 10 hours a month or something like that.

38:21.000 --> 38:27.000
It's just on the cusp of not needing it, to be honest with you. But every now and then it comes in and sort of saves the day.

38:27.000 --> 38:29.000
And it kind of justifies itself for like another three months.

38:29.000 --> 38:32.000
So it can automatically take in the audio file and just.

38:32.000 --> 38:39.000
Yeah. Yeah. So, you know, I recently an example is we can actually hear it in production like three weeks ago or a month.

38:39.000 --> 38:42.000
I had Michael Arbelong from Ferronix on Linux Action News.

38:42.000 --> 38:44.000
Oh, cool. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

38:44.000 --> 38:50.000
And Michael, God bless him. He he has a data center in his basement where he does a lot of his benchmarking.

38:50.000 --> 38:55.000
And as you probably are aware, data centers, they're loud, a lot of fan noise in the data center.

38:55.000 --> 38:59.000
And he took he took the call in the data center.

38:59.000 --> 39:04.000
So it was it was an intense white wish noise in the background.

39:04.000 --> 39:07.000
But I ran it through Alphonic for processing.

39:07.000 --> 39:13.000
And, you know, sure enough, if it didn't just clean it right out, you wouldn't even really know he's in the data center at all.

39:13.000 --> 39:16.000
And, you know, I didn't I didn't didn't really have to do anything.

39:16.000 --> 39:18.000
I just ran it through the processing. All right.

39:18.000 --> 39:26.000
Yeah, it's nice for, you know, podcasters that are in a rush that, you know, can't call on Drew to save the day.

39:26.000 --> 39:29.000
It's great for that kind of stuff. I'm going to give you one that you don't like.

39:29.000 --> 39:35.000
OK, Slack. Yeah, I just I just can't bring myself to pay for Slack.

39:35.000 --> 39:37.000
You know, I was thinking of leaving Slack.

39:37.000 --> 39:41.000
I think I was looking at Mattermost, if I'm not mistaken, the open source alternative.

39:41.000 --> 39:47.000
Sure. But just the hassle and frankly, the years of like institutional information that's in our slack.

39:47.000 --> 39:53.000
That, you know, all my employees know how to use it much to my chagrin.

39:53.000 --> 39:56.000
We now have a customer who we're in a shared workspace with.

39:56.000 --> 39:59.000
But if you want to get me started on shared workspaces, that's it.

39:59.000 --> 40:05.000
Is it no good? Because that is the that is the thing that keeps coming up that makes me getting closer and closer to paying for it.

40:05.000 --> 40:15.000
It does what you want it to do, but it makes your slack interface when you have multiple teams and then shared workspaces very complex.

40:15.000 --> 40:21.000
And there's a it's almost like notification. It's like a notification bullet hell.

40:21.000 --> 40:31.000
But I pay for it because it's probably I would say it's even more important than G Suite or even with it for the way I run my business now.

40:31.000 --> 40:37.000
Wow. Yeah. Though I do think their pricing is a little rough on small businesses.

40:37.000 --> 40:44.000
I would agree that real time chat is is probably more important than email for my business, at least for internal communication.

40:44.000 --> 40:47.000
OK. And we do that on Slack right now.

40:47.000 --> 40:56.000
But, you know, my primary driver is just simply I don't I don't want to ask everyone else that works with us to install yet another app.

40:56.000 --> 40:58.000
They all already have slack. Well, that's the other thing.

40:58.000 --> 41:05.000
People even like non techie people all know how to use slack, even if they're from even if their organization uses teams.

41:05.000 --> 41:09.000
Right. It's the same. I mean, it's close.

41:09.000 --> 41:16.000
I just now that especially now that they're going to be owned by Salesforce and the fact that matter most is so easy to set up.

41:16.000 --> 41:21.000
I mean, I could toss it on a Linode in literally I mean probably under 10 minutes.

41:21.000 --> 41:25.000
You could have an entire thing ready to go in production with a URL and everything.

41:25.000 --> 41:29.000
Yeah, I know. I know. I know. I know. But I'm just you know, my point is like that.

41:29.000 --> 41:33.000
But for me, that is a real pause. That is something I would be willing to do.

41:33.000 --> 41:43.000
And then there's Matrix, which is still rough, but could ultimately be like like the ultimate slack one day.

41:43.000 --> 41:51.000
Just it's so hard to pay for it when those options are just right there, especially when it's twelve dollars a user.

41:51.000 --> 41:55.000
That makes it hundreds of dollars a month, a month to pay for.

41:55.000 --> 41:58.000
Yeah, I know, because I'm currently paying that bill. Right.

41:58.000 --> 42:03.000
Like, oh, it's a lot of money, but I will just back to positivity.

42:03.000 --> 42:12.000
It is so vital to my business that actually a couple hundred bucks a month versus, you know, not having it.

42:12.000 --> 42:16.000
It ended up being a no brainer. I'm almost there myself. I am almost there.

42:16.000 --> 42:20.000
It's just it's hard. It's really it's really hard.

42:20.000 --> 42:24.000
And of course, it's cross team slacking that is pushing this now.

42:24.000 --> 42:27.000
I wish that didn't exist. The cross team stuff is where things start getting wacky.

42:27.000 --> 42:34.000
Huh. Maybe. I was just going to realize I should probably mention that we pay for Squadcast, which is the tool that you and I are using here.

42:34.000 --> 42:37.000
But that keeps crashing. Yeah.

42:37.000 --> 42:42.000
It's crashed like it's going to make Drew work extra hard this week because he's got to stitch it so far, like three files together.

42:42.000 --> 42:48.000
So, yeah, I don't know. But we do use we do use Squadcast for a lot of our remote.

42:48.000 --> 42:52.000
It's a WebRTC audio app that offers local recording.

42:52.000 --> 42:57.000
I'll just say I have way too many app subscriptions for for things like Overcast, Airmail.

42:57.000 --> 43:03.000
Yeah, same. Yeah. I actually opted to go for the Apple one thing, too.

43:03.000 --> 43:07.000
Really? Yeah. That's that'll be my ending shame.

43:07.000 --> 43:15.000
And I'm happily paying for it because I'm actually paying less than I was before because I have a family plan with like five family members or whatever it is.

43:15.000 --> 43:23.000
And they all have upgraded storage because all these devices need more than the pittance that Apple gives you.

43:23.000 --> 43:28.000
And Apple music. Yep. And the wife and daughter love the Apple fitness.

43:28.000 --> 43:31.000
So makes sense. Yeah.

43:31.000 --> 43:38.000
So I actually I ended up saving like ten bucks a month or something like that.

43:38.000 --> 43:40.000
What about you? What's your what's your guilty?

43:40.000 --> 43:45.000
I mean, I don't know if it's guilty, but the obvious one is I have the JetBrains ultimate.

43:45.000 --> 43:48.000
It's a subscription to all of their products. Oh, yeah.

43:48.000 --> 43:54.000
And I have it for each one of my employees as well. So that's a that's a that's a nice chunk every month.

43:54.000 --> 44:01.000
While you're all in V.S. Code. Well, that's the problem as we're doing more pipe. I'm like, oh, yeah.

44:01.000 --> 44:04.000
I mean, they've got some great products like so I can understand wanting to keep it.

44:04.000 --> 44:12.000
But at the same time, if V.S. Code and plugins are meeting 90, 95 percent of your need, what are you going to do there?

44:12.000 --> 44:18.000
I will say the Ruby stuff in V.S. Code is not nearly as good as the Python stuff.

44:18.000 --> 44:25.000
So Ruby mine is still especially with some of these larger legacy projects or even just non legacy larger projects that are more complex.

44:25.000 --> 44:30.000
The some of the intelligent refactoring and stuff like that is really nice to have.

44:30.000 --> 44:35.000
I don't know. The V.S. Code ecosystem is pretty dynamic right now.

44:35.000 --> 44:42.000
Right. I could see like the Rubocop integration, which for those who don't know, Rubocop is a static analyzer for Ruby.

44:42.000 --> 44:50.000
It's right. Joke on Robocop. It's really good in V.S. Code and it's actually less buggy than it is in Ruby mine.

44:50.000 --> 44:56.000
So it's getting there. And the Python stuff, V.S. Code just runs circles around PyCharm.

44:56.000 --> 45:01.000
I mean, it's just bad if you're using PyLance.

45:01.000 --> 45:03.000
PyLance. I was trying to remember the name of it. That's what it was.

45:03.000 --> 45:08.000
PyLance. The only thing that PyCharm keeps is the IntelliJ refactorings.

45:08.000 --> 45:15.000
You know, that's one of those things that V.S. Code is going to get very. You can feel it, right? Like it's coming. It's just not done.

45:15.000 --> 45:22.000
So, you know, I will mention that our Coderly for Q4 is now out.

45:22.000 --> 45:30.000
It is in the limited ad feed and it's also available as a standalone download in your CoderQA membership dashboard.

45:30.000 --> 45:37.000
And in that CoderQA, Coderly, Mike talks more about some of the business reasons for the Python switch.

45:37.000 --> 45:41.000
I think that is actually a very fascinating conversation.

45:41.000 --> 45:48.000
So if you are one of our CoderQA members or you want to become one, go to CoderQA.co and you support the show.

45:48.000 --> 45:53.000
You get that limited ad feed and those Coderly reports and Q4 is fresh.

45:53.000 --> 45:58.000
Just went out today as we record this. Of course, by the time this is available for download, it will have been out for a couple of days.

45:58.000 --> 46:04.000
So you may have already heard it and you can find it at CoderQA.co and then in the download section or just in the limited ad feeds.

46:04.000 --> 46:08.000
If you subscribe to that, which is one of your member perks, it'll just show up in there.

46:08.000 --> 46:15.000
Hey, before we blast out of here, I was just reading through the Stack Overflow Developer Survey for 2020.

46:15.000 --> 46:21.000
We read these every year and they say in here a consistent rise over the last five years.

46:21.000 --> 46:26.000
Python fell from second last year to third this year on the list of most loved technologies.

46:26.000 --> 46:31.000
So you're getting in just at the right time. As usual. Right. X&M had a good point.

46:31.000 --> 46:35.000
Yeah. Yeah. No, I actually think you're getting in a great time.

46:35.000 --> 46:39.000
I tease. But, you know, what beat it out was TypeScript.

46:39.000 --> 46:44.000
Rust held the top spot for the most loved technology for the fifth year in a row.

46:44.000 --> 46:46.000
And what's not to love?

46:46.000 --> 46:56.000
What's not to love? When you look at platforms, surprise, surprise, Linux is the number one platform by 55%.

46:56.000 --> 46:58.000
A monothelium.

46:58.000 --> 47:01.000
I mean, obviously these are developers, but my God.

47:01.000 --> 47:04.000
I mean, no wonder why Dell's making laptops like this.

47:04.000 --> 47:08.000
Windows was the second platform at 53%.

47:08.000 --> 47:14.000
But then get this. You know what beat out AWS, Android, Mac OS?

47:14.000 --> 47:18.000
Just Docker with 35%, the third largest used platform, Docker.

47:18.000 --> 47:19.000
I didn't kind of get that.

47:19.000 --> 47:21.000
Because they're probably running it on AWS.

47:21.000 --> 47:23.000
Right. It's like you're not just like. Yeah.

47:23.000 --> 47:26.000
And like you're comparing Windows and Linux to Docker.

47:26.000 --> 47:32.000
Yeah. Well, I think what they were talking about was probably the platforms that they're targeting for applications.

47:32.000 --> 47:35.000
I'd have to see the question on this one. I wish they showed that.

47:35.000 --> 47:41.000
But even if you're targeting Docker, you're still probably targeting some variant of Debian or if you're smart, SUSE.

47:41.000 --> 47:45.000
Well, what I thought was strange is WordPress.

47:45.000 --> 47:48.000
I guess a WordPress plugin developer, perhaps.

47:48.000 --> 47:50.000
Well, I think there's a lot. Yeah, there's a lot of that.

47:50.000 --> 47:51.000
There's a lot of that, right?

47:51.000 --> 47:52.000
Yeah.

47:52.000 --> 48:00.000
Heroku at 11%, Slack apps integrations, 7%, Raspberry Pi, 14.9% above WordPress and Azure.

48:00.000 --> 48:01.000
Or Azure.

48:01.000 --> 48:02.000
Yeah.

48:02.000 --> 48:07.000
I mean, I think they're actually doing pretty well, but it doesn't seem to really show in this thing.

48:07.000 --> 48:08.000
I think they're doing well.

48:08.000 --> 48:12.000
I think the problem is they tend to be slightly more expensive when you run out of credits.

48:12.000 --> 48:13.000
Oh, yeah.

48:13.000 --> 48:19.000
And like, you know, to plug a sponsor, what you can do with $100 on Leno versus what you can do with $100 on Azure.

48:19.000 --> 48:20.000
A couple other interesting notes.

48:20.000 --> 48:25.000
More than 75% of developers work overtime at least occasionally.

48:25.000 --> 48:26.000
I know.

48:26.000 --> 48:27.000
One to two days per quarter.

48:27.000 --> 48:31.000
25% work overtime one to two days per week or more.

48:31.000 --> 48:32.000
Yeah.

48:32.000 --> 48:33.000
Oh, boy.

48:33.000 --> 48:34.000
Hmm.

48:34.000 --> 48:39.000
Yeah, it's always interesting to read through these, but we will link to the overview,

48:39.000 --> 48:43.000
and then you can dig into the different technology stacks and platforms that they ask everybody about.

48:43.000 --> 48:48.000
Mine are always the favorite, like most popular, this and whatnot, but they cover all kinds of stuff,

48:48.000 --> 48:57.000
including, you know, web frameworks, which I'll leave for that as an exercise in the show notes if you want to go check that out.

48:57.000 --> 49:00.000
Also, why don't you go check out our sponsor, Cloud Guru, on social media.

49:00.000 --> 49:06.000
You can find them at just slash a Cloud Guru on YouTube, Twitter, Facebook, all of the sites.

49:06.000 --> 49:07.000
It's really simple.

49:07.000 --> 49:08.000
It's just slash a Cloud Guru.

49:08.000 --> 49:09.000
You can find Mike on Twitter.

49:09.000 --> 49:10.000
He's at Dumanuku.

49:10.000 --> 49:13.000
His company is at the Mad Botter Inc.

49:13.000 --> 49:15.000
Is there anything else you want to plug, Mr. Dominic?

49:15.000 --> 49:18.000
No, just follow the show and apparently prepare for some robes.

49:18.000 --> 49:19.000
Yeah.

49:19.000 --> 49:21.000
Yeah, the show is at Coder Radio Show.

49:21.000 --> 49:29.000
Our website is coder.show, and you can get links for everything we talked about today at coder.show slash 394.

49:29.000 --> 49:32.000
Over there, you'll also see the subscribe page if you want RSS feeds.

49:32.000 --> 49:38.000
And why don't you join us for the Coder Happy Hour live Monday, 5 p.m. Pacific, 8 p.m. Eastern.

49:38.000 --> 49:45.000
Today, I was playing Cyberpunk 2077 via Stadia, and you'll have to show up live to see how that goes.

49:45.000 --> 49:46.000
It's pretty interesting.

49:46.000 --> 49:49.000
And then usually a little bit into it, Mike joins me and we start up the show.

49:49.000 --> 49:50.000
That's right.

49:50.000 --> 49:55.000
It's the Coder Happy Hour Mondays, 5 p.m. Pacific, 8 p.m. Eastern.

49:55.000 --> 49:56.000
That's it.

49:56.000 --> 49:58.000
That's our business for this episode.

49:58.000 --> 50:00.000
So come out, come on out, hang out with us on Mondays.

50:00.000 --> 50:02.000
Otherwise, get the show at coder.show.

50:02.000 --> 50:03.000
That's everything.

50:03.000 --> 50:04.000
That's all I got for you.

50:04.000 --> 50:07.000
Thanks so much for tuning this week's episode of the Coder Radio program.

50:07.000 --> 50:28.000
And my friends, we will see you right back here next week.
